I HAVE the honour, to inform you that during the past few months repeated messages have been received through the medium of the Imperial Commissioner, Sadigh-es-Sultaneh, to the effect that the Persian Government desires the prompt removal of the company’s lauch and barges on the Upper Karim River, and as these are still necessary to the company’s transport operations, I have protested strongly, and Mr. Brown, the company’s agent in Tehran, has been in communication with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the subject. Last month I was advised by our agents at Mohammerah that the launch in question would have to be shortly replaced by a new one, as she was practically worn out owing to the extremely heavy nature of the work she had performed and to damage received on the way out from this country. Apprehending that the instalment of a new launch in replacement of the present one may further complicate and reopen a question which, in the opinion of Mr. Brown writing on the 6 th ultimo, would probably be allowed to drop, I wrote to him on the 22 nd ultimo asking him to obtain His Britannic Majesty’s Minister’s views on the subject. I have now received his cabled reply as follows :— “ Referring to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, British Minister, Tehran, apprehending great difficulties, suggested sounding treasurer-general. Latter informs me he has been requested by Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran, to go thoroughly into everything concerning Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) and deal with it. Treasurer-general informs me he will go through everything with me and settle all points definitely, and nothing will be allowed to stand in way to delay Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) giving Persian Government royalties. He is strongly of opinion there will not be objections new steam-launch, but will give definite decision within a week.” It is essentially necessary that the company should be in a position to carry their own material on the Upper Karim, instead of being dependent upon the vagaries of launches belonging to the Muin and others, who have at times as much (or more) general cargo as they can carry, and I trust that the final decision of the treasurer- general will be a favourable one.

That His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran states that he will not fail to press the Persian Government for the removal of Kerim Khan as soon as they have recovered some vestige of their authority in the district in question, but that, owing to the rebellious Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh being now in full possession of the Kermanshah district, nothing can be done for the present ; and 3 . That His Majesty’s Minister deprecates any pecuniary arrangement such as was suggested in my letter of the 20th June last, being come to with Kerim Khan ; and that Sir Edward Grey concurs with the above views.

Sir, Foreign Office, September 2, 1911. / WITH reference to yonr letter of the 3rd ultimo and previous correspondence L relative to the situation at Kasr-i-Shiiin, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to \ inform you that he has received the report of His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah on his visit to that place. I am to state that Mr. Wilson came to the conclusion that the complete removal of Kerim Khan from the district was desirable on many grounds, and that any attempt on his part to come to an amicable settlement of your company’s dispute would make it difficult for Ilis Majesty’s Legation to make the demand he recommends. For this reason Mr. Wilson, with the full concurrence of Mr. Soane, the company’s agent at Kasr-i-Shirin, decided not to visit Kerim Khan. In forwarding the report His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran states that he will not fail to press the Persian Government for the removal of Kherim Khan as soon as they have recovered some vestige of their authority in the district in question. At present Daoud Khan, who is all powerful at Kasr-i-Shirin, and who, Mr. Wilson thinks, might not be averse to the ejection of Kerim Khan, is with the rebellious Prince Salar-ed- Dowleh now in full possession of Kermanshah. Consequently there is nothing to be done for the present. Sir G. Barclay also refers to the proposal made by your company in your letter of the 20th June, to the effect that they should come to some pecuniary arrangement with Kerim Khan, and give notice to the Persian Government that the amount would be deducted from the royalty payable under article 10 of the concession. A somewhat similar proposal made by your company with reference to the Sheikh of Mohammerah was, as you are aware, deprecated by Sir G. Barclay (see the letter from this Office of the 19th January last), and he is of opinion that, in the present case the Persian Government would strongly protest against such a step which would obviously create a precedent, leading perhaps to the ultimate absorption of their share of the profits. They would be inspired by mistrust of the company whose work they could easily find means of hindering within the letter of their convention (e.g., by insisting on the exclusion of Hindu labour). Moreover, if the Government had recourse to arbitration it could easily be proved that their failure to control Kerim Khan at the present juncture is due to force majeure and not to the negligence of the central authority. In Sir G. Barclay’s opinion it would be desirable to defer any act such as that proposed by your company to emergencies where their interests were seriously threatened on an important scale and where the factors were really under the control of the central Government. I am to add that Sir E. Grey concurs in the view expressed by Sir G. Barclay on this point. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.e Property His Britannic Majesty’s Groverranealj PERSIA.

It will be observed that Mr. Wilson came to the conclusion that the complete removal of Kerim Khan from the district was desirable on many grounds, and that any j attempt on his part to come to an amicable settlement of the oil company’s dispute ' would make it difficult for us to make the demand he recommends. For this reason Mr. Wilson, with the full concurrence of Mr. Soane, the company’s agent at Kasr-i- j Shirin, decided not to visit Kerim Khan. I will not fail to press the Persian Government for the removal of Kerim Khan as soon as the central Government has recovered some vestige of its authority in the district in question. At present Daoud Khan, who is all powerful at Kasr-i-Shirin, and who, Mr. Wilson thinks, might not be averse to the ejection of Kerim Khan, is with the rebellious Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh, who is in full possession of Kermanshah. Consequently there is nothing to be done for the present. I take this opportunity of referring to your despatch No. 75 of the 4th July, in which you request my views on a proposal made by the oil company in their letter of the 20th June to the effect that they should come to some pecuniary arrangement with Kerim Khan and give notice to the Persian Government that the amount would be deducted from the royalty payable under article 10 of the concession. A somewhat similar proposal was made by the oil company with reference to the Sheikh of Mohammerah and deprecated in my telegram No. 9 of the 9th January. The Persian Government would doubtless strongly protest against such a step, which would obviously create a precedent leading perhaps to the ultimate swallowing up of their share of the profits. Their mistrust of the company would be increased, and they could easily find means of hindering the work of the company within the letter of their convention (e.g., insisting on the exclusion of Hindoo labour). Moreover, if the Govern ment had recourse to arbitration, it could easily be proved that their failure to control Kerim Khan at the present juncture is due to force majeure and not to the negligence of the central Government. In my opinion it would be desirable to defer any arbitrary act such as that proposed by the company to emergencies where the company’s interests were seriously threatened on an important scale and where the factors were really under the control of the central Government. I need hardly point out how a violation on the part of the oil company of specific undertakings embodied in its concession would react on the chances of other British companies obtaining industrial concessions from the Persian Government on the basis of a partition of profits.

[2141 ee—19]2 Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Lieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. Sir, July 7, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that in pursuance of a suggestion of Mr. McDouall of which His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran approved, that I should interview Kerim Khan Bajilan Temir in connection with difficulties which have existed for some time between him and the local agent of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Kasr-i-Shirin, 1 proceeded to the latter place from Kermanshah, arriving on the 7 th July. It seems desirable that I should submit a report in some detail on the existing situation as I found it, after recapitulating briefly the causes that gave rise to the present troubles. I am encouraged to do so by the fact that the continued activity of the oil company in these regions appears to me to be intimately bound up with the general question of a railway between Bagdad and Kermanshah (regarding which I am submitting a separate report) as well as of the Turco-Persian frontier, Kasr-i-Shirin lying well within the ancient province of Zohab, which the Turks confidently hope, it is believed, to regain as a result of their present negotiations with Persia. 2 . On arrival of Mr. Soane, in March 1911, to recommence work on the Kasr-i- Shirin oil-field, Kerim Khan, who was then, as now, in possession of the district, evinced great reluctance to permit any resumption of work by the company ; by an agreement of 1905 with the latter, he had been granted the right to remove oil until such date as the company should send a European or commence work of any kind. This privilege was worth about 1 , 000 /. a-year to him ; he was naturally unwilling to see a sudden cessation of his income from this source and has pursued a policy of consistent opposition ever since, with the result that it is only recently that the company has been able to regain a hold on its property. 4. His hostility,however,has in no way abated, nor are the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the only sufferers : he has for months past been levying road taxes upon all animals on the Bagdad-Kermanshah road, which have recently reached the unprecedented figure of 4 krans per animal in either direction loaded or unloaded. This sum is arrived at as follows :— Uakk, Kuarsurani, road guards .. .. .. Krans. 1 Ilakk, Wuguhat, grazing fees on Crown estates* .. # . 1 Hakk, Maliyat, revenue contribution • • • • 1 Hakk-i-Hukuk, supplementary .. • • • • .. 1 Total .. .. • • .. 4 5. He has always been careful to evince no personal animosity to the company’s agent, with whom he has remained on ostensibly friendly terms. He has invariably asserted that the frequent hostile acts of his adherents against the company were committed without his knowledge or consent, though there is ample proof that on almost every occasion he has been the actual instigator. 6 . Ever since his apparent break, on the 12 th June, with Daoud Khan Kalhur, Sardar Muzaffer, by whose favour only he continues to hold office, he has retired as far as possible from public life, and has refused to grant interview to the company’s officials, customs director, or local merchants. Whilst abstaining from overt acts of hostility against the company, he has redoubled his tyranny towards the townspeople and the customs officials. On the 16th June two customs menials were stabbed by his men, and no reparation has been made. 7. Under these circumstances it seems unlikely that a visit from me would alter the situation to the company’s benefit, and might conceivably have the opposite eflect, and I therefore decided, with the full concurrence of Mr. Soane, not to visit Kerim Khan. I felt that it would not be easy for me to come to an amicable settlement of the oil company’s difficulties, even were such possible, without in some degree palliating his misdeeds in other directions; in any case a resumption of friendly relations at this juncture would make it difficult for us to take the action suggested in paragraph 8 , which is desirable on grounds independent cf the oil company’s affairs. The company are now considering the advisability of extending or terminating their activities in the district, and in view of the immediate improvement of the * Lessees of Crown grazing- lands are entitled to collect at Kasr-i-Shirin only 6 shahis for each three leasts should they have fanned this tax, but not otherwise. Last year the farmer was a private individual.3 situation that w ould follow the resumption of work on a larger scale, it seemed undesirable for me to take any action at the present moment, which might operate, even temporarily, to their detriment. 8. In his despatch No. 70 of the 3rd July, 1911, to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister forwarding Mr. Soane’s letter of the 29th June, Mr. McDouall expressed his opinion that the total removal from Kasr-i-Shinn of Kerim Khan was the only remedy for us to seek. With this view I venture to express my complete concurrence with the proviso that he should be exiled not only from that town but from the Bajilan country.* 9. There is good reason to believe that an order to effect such removal addressed by the Persian Government to Daoud Khan, might not be unwelcome to the latter, who might be relieved to see Kerim Khan ejected, though for personal reasons he seems to feel himself unable to do so on his own initiative. Such removal should be followed by the reinstatement of Sher Khan, Samsam-ul-Mamahk, the present Government nominee, with whom Daoud Khan has recently effected a reconciliation, and whose conduct when in charge of this district has been uniformly satisfactory. 10. Were it deemed desirable to make such a representation there is no doubt that the customs would be very glad to put forward a similar request, a suitable opportunity may be afforded by the expected arrival at Kermanshah of the new Governor General Sardar Mutazid with a considerable force. 11. lam informed by Mr. Soane that there is much talk in Turkish official circles regarding the desirability of regaining the province of Zohab for the Ottoman Empire, and the furkish consul at Kermanshah was recently endeavouring to utilise the anarchy existing, numerous cases of oppression of Turkish subjects as an excuse for introducing lurkish troops, thus very possibly raising the whole frontier question in a way most inconvenient to us and Persia. 1 hese facts would seem to strengthen the case for Kerim Khan’s early removal. 12. I have sent a copy of the letter to His Majesty’s Minister and to Mr. McDouall. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, on Special Duty. \ r Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul McDouall to Sir G. Barclay. (No. 70.) Sir, Kermanshah, July 3, 1911. IN continuation of my telegram No. 34 dated the 24th June, 1911. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. Soane regarding the relations at present existing between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Kerim Khan, which appear to show a temporary improvement. 2. As mentioned in my diary of the 19th June, information locally obtained confirms Mr. Soane’s view that Kerim Khan has already lost the active support of Daoud Khan, but the latter is not likely to remove him until he has recovered the maliyat. 3. There appears to be a probability that Daoud Khan will later on give the governorship of Kasr to Sher Khan Sinjabi Samsam-ul-Mamalik, the nominee of the Persian Government for the post, whose previous record gives us every reason to hope that his return would put an end to the company’s difficulties with Kerim Khan as well as to the disorders now prevalent in the district. 4. I fully concur with Mr. Soane’s view that the removal of Kerim Khan is the only true solution of the difficulty; I may add that action in this direction by the Persian Government would give scarcely less satisfaction to the provincial director of customs than to the company, as Kerim Khan constantly interferes with the customs administration in Kasr, and only recently two customs employes were stabbed by his men. I have, &amp;c. w.

Dear Mr. McDouall, June 29, 1911. - I WIRED you yesterday asking you not to come down, if you were contemplating doinsr so, until you heard from me. _ T i n + 1 did this as the position here at present is not very bad. I have managed to quiet Kerim Khan down a great deal, and the salt business, which was serious enough at first, has changed complexion somewhat. Originally he was making salt only within the fence of No. 1 well, but now he has taken a great bulk of his works outside, and probably 80 per cent, of the total salt is outside, apart from which he has withdrawn opposition to my people making salt themselves, which they do, so that, though the fact remains that he has, and is trespassing to evict him from the No 1 fence at present would in no way secure to us the salt monopoly, and as soon as your back was turned would probably result m renewed opposition in other The market, of course, I cannot touch as long as 80_per cent, is made by another at no cost (he pays no wages to his people) ; nor can I raise any objection to his ma mg salt on his own land. . , .,i i _ _ , So far as oil goes, there are now no buyers in Kasr ; even he withdrew co\ert opposition, and this is because he has impoverished the place so much. The question at the moment, therefore, is not so much Kerim Khan s behav lour, it is the existence of Kerim Khan here, and the bad influence inseparable from his existence in power. The only remedy to seek now is, I think, the removal ol Kerim Khan, not any arrangement with him, for he would keep to no arrangement once your back was turned so long as he remains. Nor would any persons do business for fear of extortion ; and this position is not only in regard to the company s business, but is true of all business here. -.it- j At the present time I am on ostensibly friendly terms with him, and things aie going^smoot^hly^enou^h. ^ to point to Daoud - s withdrawal of support from him and I am prepared to wait a little while to see what will happen to him, specially if you will, as heretofore, give me all information you can regarding t ie P 0sltl0n * [Unsigned.] oAl /sv3 'fjl y ^ No. 1964 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 30th July (received 7th August) 1911. ,&gt; ^ k l 1 5 Fp6m--L!BUTENANT.C0L0NEL P.

He has always been careful to evince no personal animosity to the Com pany’s Agents, with whom he has remained on ostensibly friendly terms; he has invariably asserted that the frequent hostile acts of his adherents were committed without his knowledge or consent, though there is ample proof that on almost every occasion he has been the actual instigator. 6 . Ever since his apparent break, on June 12 th, with Daud Khan Kalhor, Sardar Muzaffar, by whose favour only he continues to hold office, he has retired as far as possible from public life, and has refused to grant interviews to the Company’s officials, Custom’s Director, or local merchants. Whilst abstaining from overt acts of hostility against the Company, he has redoubled his tyranny towards the townspeople and the Customs officials. On i 6 th June two Customs’ menials were stabbed by his men and no reparation has been made. 7 . Under these circumstances, it seemed unlikely that a visit from me would alter the situation to the Company’s benefit, and might conceivably have the opposite effect, and I therefore decided, with the full concurrence of Mr. Soane, not to visit Karim Khan. I felt that it wmuld not be easy for me to come to an amicable settlement of the Oil Company’s difficulties, even were such possible, without in some degree palliating his misdeeds in other directions: in any case, a resumption of friendly relations at this juncture would make it difficult for us to take the action which I have suggested in paragraph 8 , which is desirable on grounds quite independent of the Oil Company’s affairs. The Company are now considering the advisability of extending or terminating their activities in this district, and, in view of the immediate improvement in the situation that would follow the resumption of work on a largef scale, it seemed undesirable for me to take any action at the present moment which might operate, even temporarily, to their detriment. 8 . In his despatch, No. 34 , of the 3 rd July iqi i , to His Majesty’s Minister forwarding a copy of Mr. Soane’s letter of 29 th June, Mr. Consul McDouall ex pressed his opinion that the total removal from Kasr i-Shirin of Karim Khan was the only remedy for us to seek. With this view 1 venture to express my complete concurrence, with the proviso that he should be exiled not only from that town, but from the Bajilan country.* 9 . There is good reason to believe that an order to effect such removal addressed by the Persian Government to Daud Khan might not be unwelcome to the latter, who might be relieved to see Karim Khan ejected, though, for personal reasons, he seems to feel himself unable to do so of his own initiative. Such removal should be followed by the reinstatement of Shir Khan Sanjabi, Samsam- ul-Mamalik, the present' Government nominee, with whom Daud Khan has recently effected a reconciliation and whose conduct when in charge of this dis trict has been uniformly satisfactory. 10 . Were it deemed desirable to make such a representation, there is no doubt that Customs would be very glad to put forward a similar request: a suitable opportunity may be afforded by the expected arrival at Kermanshah of the new Governor-General, Sardar M’utazid, with a considerable force. 11 . I am informed by Mr. Soane that there is much talk in Turkish official circles regarding the desirability of regaining the province of Zuhab for the Ottoman Empire, and the Turkish Consul at Kermanshah was recently endeavour ing to utilize the anarchy existing here, and numerous cases of oppression ^ on Turkish subjects, as an excuse for introducing Turkish troops, thus very possibly raising the whole frontier question in a way most inconvenient to us and to Persia. These facts would seem to strengthen the case for Karim Khan’s early removal. 13. I have sent a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and to Mr. McDouall. • The Bajilan country may be said to be bounded by Kasr-i-Shirin, Dar-i-Diwan, Zuhab, Sirwan R. and - Aghdagh mountains, the two latter forming the locally recognized Turkishirontier.

The temporary placing of some empty barrels on the Harmashir River while we were laying the pipe line under the river to keep the pipes in position while being screwed, was reported to the central Government as the “ building of a bridge. 1 ’ 2. The wearing of numbered brass badges (to distinguish one from the other) by the dozen or so Kurds who act as day watchman and peons at Abbadan was reported to the central Government as the placing of a number of men “ in uniform,” thus suggesting that they were being employed as soldiers. 3. A number of misleading reports have been made as to our use of flags, e.g., it was reported that two flags which were placed on the bank of the river near Fao by a steamer which was engaged in buoying the river were placed there by us. As the communication of such incorrect and misleading information to your Government causes a good deal of trouble and annoyance to both them and us, I shall be obliged if you will request your Government to remove this official from Mohammerah at the earliest possible date.

The companies in question were, as I think you are aware, formed to “ work oil in the Bakhtiari country ” in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the khans, and as the oil produced by them cannot obviously, for commercial reasons, be refined in that country, these companies must (like 99 out of 100 of the oil companies in other parts of the world), sell their oil in its crude state to whoever will buy it. To enable these companies to get the best prices possible for their crude, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are, at great cost, laying a pipe-line from the Bakhtiari country to the coast, and are erecting a refinery on the coast; and when the time comes for fixing the price which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are to pay the other companies for their crude, that price will, of course, be fixed at a fair rate, based upon the prices ruling for crude in other parts of the world. If the oil obtained by the companies is abundant in quantity, as we have every reason to suppose it will be, the price paid by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the producing companies should give the latter a very satisfactory profit, and it is obviously to the interests of the company that the Shah and the khans, who are shareholders in these companies, should receive as good an interest as possible on their shares.

I now enclose copy of a despatch from Mr. Banking forwardino- a copy of the agreement in question together with his observations on it and the negotiations which led to its conclusion. _ „ Mr. Banking in the twentieth paragraph of his despatch points out the need ot erecting at once the boundary pillars mentioned in the agreement, for until this is done it will be difficult to bring home to the Bakhtiari khans any cases of trespass on the part of their rayots. I concur in Mr. Banking’s recommendation, and hope that the company may be urged to undertake the work immediately. The conclusion of this agreement reflects in my opinion great credit on Mr. Banking, who seems to have conducted these difficult negotiations with much skill, and I venture to hope that his action may be considered to merit an expression ot your approval. IN continuation of my telegram No. 9, dated the 3rd May, 1911, from the oil-fields, I have the honour to forward herewith, for your Excellency’s information, a copy in Persian, together with a rough translation of same, of the agreement arrived at between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Bakhtiari khans regarding the land acquisition question. ^ . Before dealing with the agreement itself it may not be devoid of interest to briefly review the main features of the negotiations, which culminated in its signature. On the 6th February, 1911, before leaving Ahwaz, Mr. Greenway. managing director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, handed me a memorandum regarding the land question, in which he says that the company is willing to pay up to 23J- tomans per jarib for the lands of Maidan-i-Nafthek, Maidan-i-Naphtun, Tembi pumping station, pipe-line, and road, and on this basis a maximum sum was worked oup up to which limit Dr. Young, the company’s representative, wus empowered to act. Unfortunately, however, when computing this maximum sum, the company had no idea as to the correct area of the lands they wished to take up, and having very much underestimated it, a maximum was arrived at which was absolutely inadequate to meet the case. Just before the negotiations Dr. Young, after consultation with Mr. Lamb, the managing agent of Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co., Mohammerah, and myself telegraphed to London asking for a higher limit, which was fixed at 18 000/. . . On my arrival at the oil-field on the 13th April, prior to the arrival of the Bakhtiari khans, the situation which I found was one of disgraceful unprepared ness, owing, I have not the slightest doubt, to proper orders not having been issued by those who^e dut&gt; it was to issue orders as to what was required in the way of maps, &amp;c. The map of the road, of which frequent mention has been made, was not ready, and is not even ready to the present day, except in the form of a traverse in pencil, tiacings of the maps of the lands to be acquired were not available, and the only areas which were [2105 c — 12 ] PEBSIA.

Ahwaz, May 7, 1911.ready, when I asked for the areas of the maidans, &amp;c., to be acquired, were those of Maidan-i-Naphtun ; the remainder I was only able to get by going myself to the surveyor’s tent and sitting beside him while he worked them out. . 1 he Bakhtiari khans arrived at the oil-field on the 17th April, and, after riding round the boundaries of the tract of land which the company wished by acquire, which in itself took two mornings and an afternoon to do, the negotiations were commenced. 1 may here say, en passant, that even I had no idea of the immensity of the tract which the company wished to acquire till I went round the boundaries of the two maidans myself, the perimeter of which I am given to understand is about 25 miles. dhe Bakhtiari khans commenced by stating that the company could take up just as much or as little as it liked, and of the lands taken up cultivated was to be paid for at the rate of 50 tomans per jarib, and hill tracts at the rate of 5 tomans per jarib, which rates, when applied to the area of land required by the company, produces a total sum, in round numbers, of 63,000L Every possible argument was used, but the khans refused to abandon their contention that all flat lands were of equal value, and must therefore be paid for at one rate, and on reference to the company’s surveyor, Mr. Scott, late survey department, India, it appeared that the lands classed as new fallow were those which the llyat were in the habit of cultivating every alternate year, while even those lands classed by us as old fallow, had been cultivated within quite recent years, and in some cases areas shown as “ old fallow ” in last year’s survey were under crop this year. As regards the hill tracts the khans were equally firm; their contention being that these tracts were of value to the llyat as grazing ground, and that there was nothing in the Preece agreement saying that these lands were to be given free. They said that they were perfectly ready to give the land if the company required it as laid down in the agreement, but that if the company took up this land to the exclusion of the llyat they must pay for it. Unfortunately, it is perfectly true that the word “ free ” does not appear in this connection, and further, that the word in the Persian text, translated in the English by the word ‘‘give,’ does not imply “free gift’—this contention, however, regarding payment for hill tracts was resisted to the utmost. The question of payment for hill tracts proved the knotty point, and ultimately caused the breakdown of negotiations ; nor was it possible to get round the difficulty by not taking up any hill tracts, this being undesirable from one point of view and impossible from another, that is to say, undesirable, because these hill tracts are oil-hearing land, and impossible on account of the topographical configuration of the ground. On the 23rd April the maximum limit granted to Dr. Young was reached and ipso facto the negotiations broke down. r Ihe Bakhtiari khans refused to accept the maximum-limit-sum —18,000/.— as a lump sum payment, or even any lump sum, stating that any payment made must he at a rate per jarib. When negotiations broke down the khans had been beaten down to 25 tomans per jarib for all flat lands, and 5 tomans per jarib for hill tracts, which rates produce a total sum of 38,000/. for the total area required. On the breakdown of negotiations the khans made plans to leave the oil-field as soon as possible, i.e., on the 26th April, being under invitation to a tent-pegging display on the afternoon of the 25th April; however, as it was inadvisable, for fear of future trouble, that the khans should leave the oil-field without some definite under standing one way or the other having been come to, that same evening—the 23rd— I made an opportunity of speaking to the Sardar Muhtesham alone after dinner at the field manager’s house, and persuaded him to stay pending a reference to London, and further used my influence with him with a view to getting him to acquiesce to a price of 20 tomans per jarib for cultivated land, and 3 tomans per jarib for hill tracts, after deducting two-thirds of the area of the said hill tracts. This proposition I used my utmost endeavours to get the Sardar to accept, having a specific purpose in view. The reason being this, the total hill area, less two-thirds, is almost equivrdent to the area of the cultivation. Having once got the Sardar Muhtesham to consider the question, and having got him to promise to try and get the Sardar-i-Bahadur to likewise consider it, ! put another proposition to him, which was to fix a price of 23 tomans on all cultivated lands and throw out the grazing and hill tracts, which proposition, however, the Sardar refused to give me any promise, even to consider, without first consulting the Sardar-i- Bahadur.The proposition would have worked out to slightly over 22,000/. for the area required by the company. Next morning, when I was accompanying the khans on a visit to the Tembi ^Dumping station, they formally agreed to stay, and to transact any other outstanding business, pending receipt of an answer from Messrs, the directors in London. The next occasion when the land question was reverted to was on the 27th April, when the khans said that they had thought the matter over and that the very low r est they could accept would be 24,000/. That same evening Dr. Young informed me that if I could get the khans to accept 22,000/., if possible in instalments, lie empowered me to close. The next day the khans were visited, and after some discussion the Sardar Muhtesham agreed to accept the sum offered on one condition, viz., 20,000/. was to be paid for the land acquired, and 2,000/. was to be paid to himself and the Sardar-i- Bahadur, as the agents and negotiators for the sale of said lands. The Sardar-i- Bahadur agreed to the proposition in this form, and the question of price was closed. As regards the question of payments by instalments, at that meeting and at one that same afternoon they refused, but agreed next morning, when 1 went to see them, to take payment of the 15,000/, (he., 20,000/. less 5,000/. paid last year) in two instalments, one of 10,000/. on the 1st June, and the second, of 5,000/. on the 1st September. Now as regards the agreement. Let us first examine what has been acquired and the price paid for it. 6131‘38 acres, or over 9^- square miles of territory have been acquired for the sum of 20,000/., which sum, if applied to this total area produces a rate of 3Z, 4s. per acre, or 51‘2 krans per jarib, or if it be applied only to land under crop and new fallow in the area, produces a rate of 16/. 2s. per acre, that is to say 18s. per acre less than the last recourse limit (17/, per acre), given by Mr. Greenway, which for greater secrecy he had not had typed in the body of his memorandum, mentioned above, but had written in at the end in German in his own handwriting. As a matter of fact the company has acquired more than 9J- square miles of territory, for road extensions and diversions were not computed when making up the area statements, but are embraced by the agreement; and in my opinion the company has got a bargain, the value of which it will recognise in future years. When drawing up the agreement, it was attempted to fix some rate applicable to future transactions, but this the khans steadfastly refused to do, so the point had to be dropped. Under the agreement the company obtains full proprietary rights, within its own boundaries, with full right to make use of such water power, &amp;c., as may be there- within, and moreover the Bakhtiari khans hold themselves responsible in case of other claimants to the said lands arising. Other points will be found by reference to the agreement itself, which has been made as comprehensive and solid as it is possible to make it. One point I would press on the notice of the oil company, and that is that the boundary pillars, mentioned in the agreement, be erected with the utmost speed, for, in my opinion till this is done, the company cannot injustice hold the Bakhtiari khans responsible for any trespass on the part of their rayots, for the Lurs will always have the ready answer that there were no pillars, and that they did not know where the boundary lay. # . On the 1 st May, prior to the signature of the agreement, the marginally noted head-men of the sub-tribes* having their habitat in the lands now the property of the company, were called up and in the presence of the company’s representatives and myself were warned that they would have to vacate and of the severe consequences entailed by tresspass on or interference with the company’s lands. At the same time (1) an order to all the tribes (rough translation attached herewith), (2) an order to the inhabitants of Batwand (rough translation attached herewith), (3) an undertaking from the khans regarding their responsibility in the event of the Kili seyyids claiming ownership of the M.asjid Suleiman (Maidan-i-Naphtun) lands (rough translation attached herewith), (4) an order to Agha Hyder of the Babrsat sub-tribe from the khans, and also his undertaking vis-d-vis the company countersigned by the khans, were all obtained from the khans and handed to the company’s representative, Doctor Young. It should be noted that Agha Hyder has been appointed sole head of the guards, and it is to be hoped that this appointment may make for the more satisfactory working of the guarding arrangements. * Agha Hyder, of the Babrsat sub-tribe, and Sheikh Waes of the Alaswand, Abdul Karim of the Sheheni, Agha Sultan and Mashti Hassan of the Nasir sub-tribes. [2105 C— 12 ] B 24 In conclusion, I would express my deep sense of gratitute to Mr. G. B. Scott, late survey department, Government of India, surveyor to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the invaluable assistance he has rendered me during the course of negotiations by his intelligent foresight and ready and willing execution of all requests in connection^ with maps, area statements, &amp;c., required, and for his untiring energy in getting- completed by the end of negotiations maps, which were absolutely necessary and which were uncommenced at the beginning. I would likewise express my thanks to Dr. Young, for all the assis*ance which he has rendered me, and I would here state that in my opinion he has^ rendered the company a signal service during these negotiations, the value of which will be apparent in years to come. It is interesting to note that the fields manager, in conversation with me, stated that he thought 50,000£. would not have been an excessive sum to pay for the lands now acquired, and as a relative matter of prices stated that a few years ago 27 acres of oil land, were sold for 500,000/,. in Baku. During the course of negotiations I learnt that the Bakhtiari khans had been in communication with all sorts of persons, Ilussians, and others, regarding the relative price of oil-bearing lands. Incidently, I learnt that they had been in communication with Edward Kitabji, who had impressed on them that it was the invariable rule in such transactions that the owner of the land had to be satisfied, whatever price he like 1 to ask. Be it said to the credit of the Sardurs that during these negotiations they behaved themselves like gentlemen, although, as I expected, they had been well tutored by Yussuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujtehed. Considering the fact that they are orientals and were selling the property in which the company had sunk 1,500,001)/. and which they know the company must buy and could not retreat from, I consider that they behaved with great forbearance and better than some western owners might have done under similar circumstances, when in such a strong position with regard to the sale. Throughout the negotiations, though firm in matters in which they considered their rights were affected, the khan’s general attitude was a very just one, though I have not the slightest doubt, from what I know of their characters and from what I observed during the course of negotiations, that had not a settlement been arrived at, that subsequent trouble was to be expected, if not even a foregone conclusion. Considering the whole case I tru^t that the present settlement meets with your Excellency’s approval and will be considered a just one both to the Bakhtiari khans and also to Messrs, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I have, &amp;c. J. BANKING, Lieutenant, LA., Assistant Resident, Ahwaz. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Land Agreement with the Bakhtiari Khans. (Translation.)

In view of Rifaat Pasha’s attitude on the subject Sir G.

Sir G. Lowther instances, in support of his view, a recent case in which repre sentations of his own have remained without effect, another in which the responsible editor of a Salonica newspaper, who had been charged by the Russian consul-general at that port with making a most violent attack against the Russian Government, was acquitted, amidst an outburst of popular applause, and a third, in which the official instructed to proceed against certain journals at Monastir guilty of publishing anti- foreign articles was murdered there in broad daylight in the open street before he could take any action. In view of these considerations Sir E. Grey has expressed to Sir G.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 150 of the 30th May last, relative to an attack in a Bussorah newspaper on the employes of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I have the honour to report that the article, of which a translation is enclosed in your despatch, had already been sent to me by His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah. I mentioned the matter at the time in conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but his Excellency merely replied that too much importance need not be given to an irresponsible press, and it appeared to me unnecessary to press the matter further, for it is practically impossible to get any satisfaction in these questions, and the probable result of any attempt to do so is a repetition of the offence in a more aggravated form. The fact is that, except in the capital, the Government has very little power of control over the press, as is shown by the fact that my representations concerning the open letter to His Majesty the King, referred to in my despatch No. 378 of the 15th June, 1910, remained without result, and by the failure of the action recently brought by the Russian consul-general in Salonica against the responsible editor of the “ Silah,” a Salonica journal, for a most violent attack on the Russian Government. The editor was acquitted, and the verdict was made the occasion of an outburst of popular applause. An extract from the “ Jeune Turc ” of the 6 th instant, giving the grounds for the verdict, is enclosed herewith. Another significant incident occurred on the 4th instant at Monastir, where various local journals have been publishing inflammatory and anti-foreign articles. Instructions were sent to the Public Prosecutor of that town to proceed against these papers, but before he could take any action he was assassinated in the open street in broad daylight.

REFERRING to my letter of the 19th instant, I beg to give below copy of a telegram which I have just received from our agent at Kasr-i-Shirin, Mr. E. B. Soane :— “Kerim Khan violently preventing onr people from selling produce (of wells). The Persian Government is openly defied by him ; therefore I have no support. 1 am maintaining firm attitude. I may be able to make temporary arrangements. Until Kerim Khan removed I can sell little oil in Kasr-i-Shirin district. His object is to eject us and regain possession of oil and salt.” The reference to salt is explained by the fact that the crude petroleum from our wells at Chiah Sonkh contains a proportion of brine, which is evaporated, and the salt produced sold as well as the oil. As the position that our agent is in is a serious one, 1 shall be glad if Sir Edward Grey can see his way to taking early action in the matter. I have, &amp;c. C. GREENWAY. [2020 /— 2 ]1SU [This Doeameat is the Property of His Britanmc Majesty's Government] 1 AM in receipt of your favour of \he 16th instant, and regret to learn that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran considers that it would be unwise to appoint a British consular officer at Kasr-i-Shirin unless he were protected by a strong escort.. I would point out that this decision leaves our agent, Mr. E. B. Soane, who is now at Kasr-i-Shirin in charge of the company’s property, in a very jeopardous position, and my board will be much obliged if Sir Edward Grey will consider what steps should be taken in the circumstances, both for the protection of our agent, and also to ensure the due fulfilment by the Persian Government of their obligations under our concession to safeguard our property and employes, and to ensure to us free and unrestricted right to work the wells opened by us at Kasr-i-Shirin. Notwithstanding the assurance given to me by the Regent when I interviewed him in Tehran “that prompt measures would be taken to deal with the rebel,” it is clear from what is reported in your letter, and also from recent advices from Mr. Soane, that no practical steps have been taken by the Persian Government to compel Kerim Khan to recognise their authority, but that, on the other hand, they have, through Daoud Khan, appointed him as Governor of Kasr-i-Shirin, in which position he is, it is reported, perpetrating various acts of cruelty and extortion on the inhabitants of that town, and has, by posting his horsemen on the hills around Chiah Sourkh (where he is located), endeavoured to cut off Mr. Soane’s food and other supplies with a A'iew r to compelling him to retire from the company’s property. This is a position which calls for some immediate and determined action on the part of the Persian Government, and my board would be much obliged for any help which His Majesty’s Government can give in the matter. When in Tehran I suggested to Sir George Barclay that a possible solution of the difficulty might be to appoint Mr. Soane as British consular agent (without pay) at Kasr-i-Shirin, should such a course be practicable and Mr. Soane be acceptable to lbs Majesty’s Government in that capacity, because Kerim Khan would, I thought (judging from the conversations I had with him at Chiah Sourkh), not venture to put any obstacles in the Avay of an individual holding a recognised official position under the British Government. Mr. Soane, I may mention, was cpiite confident that, fortified by i this official position, he would have no difficulty in securing peaceable possession of the ! company’s properties from Kerim Khan, with whom his open relations are quite friendly, t Apparently, however, Sir George does not consider this course advisable, at any rate not without providing the consular officer, whoever he might be, with a strong escort. The only other course that appears to be open is to call upon the Persian Government to immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in order to compel Kerim Khan to allow us to resume possession of the wells and other property belonging to the company at Chiah Sourkh and to carry on our work there undisturbed, and to give them notice that pending these steps being taken they Avill be held responsible for the safety of Mr. Soane and of the company’s property, and also for the value of any oil which in the meantime may be removed from the wells by Kerim Khan. In view of the seriousness of the position, my board will be much obliged if Sir Edward Grey will cause a telegram to be sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran asking him to call upon the Persian Government to take immediate steps for the protection of the company’s agent and property at Chiah Sourkh, either on the lines indicated above or in such other way as Sir George Barclay may consider most advisable.

The charge in question is, I am informed, quite unfounded, and as such attacks are not only prejudicial to our company but are also calculated to arouse racial antagonisms, and thereby to jeopardise the lives of our employes and other English subjects resident in the Persian Gulf and in Mesopotamia, my board will be much obliged if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs can cause an enquiry to be made into the matter through His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah. And should it be found, as they are confident will be the case, that the charge in question is quite groundless, my board trust that some steps will be taken to ensure the punishment of, and a public retractation being made by, the editor and (or) publisher of the above paper.

IN all the books and pamphlets written by noble wise men they advise Orientals to keep clear of the interference of foreigners, and warn them, and especially the Arab sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, against the evil consequences of it, but unfortunately this good advice is disregarded and the warnings are in vain. So far are they from having paid any attention that the influence of the foreigner has extended to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and the English have obtained a concession for exporting oil from Abadan and have arrived and built their houses there as though it were a British colony, and have begun to spend large sums of money and give large presents. And this has been done without the Government of Mohammerah paying any attention to it. Does it not know that its silence is injurious to its interests and leads to English influence spreading and to their dominating the country ? What happened at Dibai is not far from us. Oh, people ! the foreigners, and especially the English, if they enter your country they will corrupt it and debase your honour. Oh, people ! if the foreigners interfere in your affairs they will slaughter your children and shame your women. Oh, people ! awake from your inattention and rouse yourselves from your sleep and be prudent m your affairs, and do not allow the foreigners to interfere with you in any way, for their interference means corruption and perversion.

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 8 .) (No. 62.) Sir, Tehran, April 25, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch No. 57 of the 19th April respecting the establish ment of an unpaid British vice-consulate at Kasr-i-Shirin, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah forecasting probable difficulties in the way of the oil company’s resumption of work on the wells in the neighbourhood. I have also received a telegram from Mr. Consul McDouall, stating in reply to my enquiries that he considered that the appointment of a vice-consul at Kasr-i-Shirin would be advisable, but that there was no suitable person available on the spot, and that naturally no one could be sent to occupy an unpaid post. Mr. Greenway had suggested to me that Mr. Soane, who represents the oil company at Kasr-i-Shirin, should himself be appointed unpaid vice-consul, and that his previous misconduct in Persia (see my telegram No. 882 of the 17th November, 1908) might now well be condoned. After further enquiry, however, I am of opinion that Mr. Soane’s past character renders it difficult for me to recommend him for an official post, and I also think, in view of Mr. McDouall’s statement in the last paragraph of his despatch No. 31 to the effect that the Persian Government have no authority whatever in the district, it would be unwise to institute a British consular officer at Kasr-i-Shirin unless he were protected by a strong escort. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Consul McDouall to Sir G. Bai'day. (No. 31.) Sir, Kermanshah, April 11, 1911. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Mr. Soane, representing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, arrived at the wells at Chia Surkh on the 26th March and proceeded to engage labour. Next day no one would come to work, and said that Karim Khan had threatened to kill anyone who worked for the company. Mr. Soane asks me to note tliis, or mention it to you, as there will probably be more serious opposition later. It therefore appears advisable to give the particulars of the company’s relations with Karim Khan from correspondence in the consular archives. In July 1905 the company left off work at Chia Surkh, and stored there their materials and tools while work was being carried on in Arabistan. They at that time made an agreement with Karim Khan, Shuja-es-Sultan, the local bajlan chief, by which he undertook to provide guards for the workshops and wells at a monthly payment of 80 tomans, and, further, he undertook to accept responsibility for the safe custody of the company’s property, and to pay the annual tax of 400 tomans to the Persian Government, and in return he was allowed to collect for his personal use all the oil coming out of wells Nos. 1 and 2. This agreement to be terminated by the recommencement of work by the company. In accordance with this agreement Karim Khan has from that time collected and sold all the oil and salt from the wells, which is said to bring him in about 200 tomans per mensem. The town of Qasr and surrounding villages are entirely supplied from these wells with oil, which Karim Khan distills for sale. I understand that the company now propose to make a short pipe-line from Chia Surkh to Qasr-i-Shirin, and refine the oil there for local sale and transport to Kerman shah and neighbourhood. This resumption of work means a great loss to Karim Khan, and he may be [2020 /i— 10 ] j yjmammmmmamtJaEgm 9 pxoccted to oppose it. The Persian Government is at present without any p op r representative in that district, except the customs director, and has no aothoi tj whatever there.

I am inclined to share his opinion if a suitable person of British nationality could be found to undertake the duties of British vice-consul at Kasr-i-Shirin without remuneration. I am consulting His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah in regard to Mr. Greenway’s proposal, and if he should report favourably I shall have the honour of addressing you a further despatch on the subject, and, in the meantime, I enclose copy of a despatch which 1 have received from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah shortly after Mr. Greenway’s visit.

I HAVE the honour to report that the state of affairs at Kasr-i-Shirin, as shown in to-dav’s and last week’s diaries, is that the Provincial Government of Kermanshah has no authority there, and the continued presence of the new Turkish consul for Kermanshah there causes a suspicion of Turkish intrigue. Mr. Soane, who left for Kasr on the 22 nd to take charge of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s affairs there, has promised to send me reliable information as to the situation, as that obtained here is not to be depended on beyond a certain point. Kasr-i-Shirin is situated in the Buluk of Zohab, which was conquered from the Turks some ninety years ago by Mohamed Ali Mirza, Prince Governor ofj Kermanshah, but has never been ceded by treaty, and, in fact, is ackowledged to be Turkish by the treaty of Erzeroum. The Persians have exercised full sovereignty there since its conquest, and the important frontier custom-house of Kasr has existed for a long time. Though in the Russian sphere British interests there are at present paramount, both as all goods from Bagdad, of which most are British, pass through that custom house in bond, and as the oil wells of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are in that buluk. The company has machinery there to the value of 30,000?., and will probably in the near future start supplying this province with that oil, and the wells will be important as soon as railways are constructed in Western Persia.

Sir G. Barclay was disposed to share this opinion, and consulted His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah with a view to ascertain whether a suitable person of British nationality could be found to undertake the duties of the post without remuneration. Mr. Macdonall telegraphed, in reply, that he considered such an appointment advisable, but that no suitable person was available on the spot to occupy the post, while it was naturally impossible, as.it was unpaid, to send anybody from elsewhere for the purpose. Mr. Macdonall’s telegram was followed by a despatch, dated the 11 th April, describing the circumstances in which Mr. Soane, the representative of your company, had begun work at Kasr-i-Shirin, and the relations which have existed in the past between the latter and Karim Khan, Shuja-es-Sultan, the local Bajlan chief, who accepted responsibility, under certain conditions, for the custody of the company’s property during the suspension of their operations in that region. The cessation of this arrangement, through the resumption of work by the company, causes great loss to Karim Khan, who may be expected to oppose it, while the Persian Government are at present without any proper representative in the district except the director of customs, and have no authority there whatever. The Prince governor has acquiesced in the appointment by Daud Khan of Karim Khan as Governor of Kasr-i-Shirin, and has no force to oppose Daud Khan. In view of the circumstances, especially the absence of authority in the district. Sir G.

[1804 u—1] BThese appointments occasioned an access of jealously in Haji Ah kuh khan, mainly against his brother, the Samsam-es-Sultaneh This was much accentuated by the Prime Minister showing him the letter above referred to. He got himselt made v Sardar Assad, the title of his late brother, and utilized his stay in Pelimn to , get the Government to address themselves to him with regard to various affairs o the tribes, and so worked to undermine the power and authority of the two 0 ,nets. - The supreme Government were not slow to note their chance of hieakin a t power of the Bakhtiari Khans, and are continually addressing messages and letters to him with regard to tribal affairs, and so widening the breach between the two parties. . These parties are now made up m the following way : SamsTm-es-Saltaneh, Eel Khane .. SI.ahab-es-Saltaneh, Kel Beggi. Savtmi-ul-M ulk • Moin-i-Humayum Ali Ad bar Khan Morteza Kuli Khan M unazem-ul-Mulk Brother of Haji Ali Kuli Khan. Brother of Shahab-es-Saltaneh. Ditto. Ditto Son of Samsam-es-Sa’taneh. Second son of late Sirdar Assad. Against these are arranged : — Haji Ali Kuli Khan Salar Alfa luizad-es-Sultan Mantazam-ed-Dowleh .. Sirdar Assad. His brother. Ditto. Eldest son of late Sirdar Assad. Han Ali Kuli Khan is a man who is absolutely eaten up with conceit, his hoHef in himself and in his capacity to govern the tribes has always been very great. His Ion' sojourn in Tehran and his friendship with the Amm-es-Sultan, the late rime Minister, together with a short visit to Europe in 1901, gives him advantages not possessed by the other Khans according to his own ideas, and thus generally the private “I*” is pushed very much too prominently before the public eye. lo hear him talk, one would think that he alone is capable of governing the tribes. It is true that he is to a certain extent more clever than the two Chiefs, but ne discounts all tins bv smoking opium and drinking arrack, &amp;c., very heavily, and goes to bed drunk almost every night of his life, so that it is often very late in the day before he is equal to work and even then he is not over keen about it. It struck me that his sentiments towards us had become considerably modified, and were not nearly as pronounced as they were. I would point out here that he was the deux ex machma as regaids the Ahwaz-Isfahan Bead. To account for this cooling off, I learn that, when in Tehran he became very great friends with theBussian Colonel of Cossacks. Any way, I found him not only obstructive as regards the Naphtha Agreement, but also in various other ways, and had not the Eel Khane and Eel Beggi insisted upon his coming to an arrangement with me on the subject, the matter would have fallen through altogether. As it was, after having come to a definite arrangement with me, he at the last tried to frighten the above Chiefs into declining to sign the Agreement. Haji Ali Kuli Khan had received the Shah’s permission to visit Europe, but he now declines to avail himself of it, preferring to remain in Chahar Mehal during the winter, and generally inconveniencing the Chiefs and probably setting the whole of the tribes by the ears. I pointed out to him and to his brother, the Salar Aria, what a disastrous course he was following, and that he was surely going the way to completely wreck the prosperity of themselves and the tribes ; he saw ail that quite clearly* but his brother and his cousin were incapable, and they must be upset. These two Chiefs, the Eel Khane and Eel Beggi see quite clearly the rocks ahead on which Haii Ali Kuli Khan is trying to drive them. They want to avoid them it thev can, and with this idea they are both about to pay Tehran a visit so as to show themselves to the Shah and the Prime Minister and also to try and undo some of the harm done them by Tlaji Ali Kuli Khan. This proceeding to Tehran is a matter of very grave offence to Haji Ali Kuli Khan and his brothers. Equally the Eel Khane and Eel Beggi, knowing that Haji Ali Kuli Khan has many powerful friends in Tehran, are very fearful that some trick may be played them and that they may he3 kept in Tehran as hostages. But notwithstanding these fears, they are going to start, in about a month’s time for the capital. As I have already had the honour to point out, it Avas owing to their insistence that the Agreement for the exploitation of naphtha was carried out. They fully realized how it would enhance their position in the south-west and would draw the bonds between the Bakhtiari tribes and 11 is Majesty’s Government closer, secure them from undue interference by the supreme Government and carry on the policy which has been quietly developed during the last few years. Altogether, a more far- seeing and truer line of policy for themselves and the benefit of the tribes than that of Haji Ali Kuli Khan, which will throw the tribes hack into a state of anarchy and lawlessness similar to what they were in after his father’s murder. Under these circumstances I would venture to respectfully suggest that His Majesty’s Legation should give these Chiefs, when in Tehran, all the moral and material support they can, should they require it, with a view of keeping the tribes in their present state of contentment and prosperity, even if it is necessary to the exiling of Haji Ali Kuli Khan. This line will materially help the well-being of the Ahwaz- Isfahan Road and the operations of the Concessions Syndicate for the exploitation of naphtha. (Signed) J. R. PREECE. November 24, 1905. •■&lt;4. Report on the Ahwaz-Isfahan Road. During the last two years robberies on the Ahwaz—Isfahan Road by men from the Kuhgelu tribe have been somewhat frequent, and although the Bakhtiari Khans have complained of these robberies, the Central Government have done nothing. All the Khans asked for was an order from the Central Government allowing them, in accordance with their original concession, to follow up and capture the robbers where ever they were found. Without such an order they seem alraid to act, as the Kuhgelus are a tribe of Ears, and this would have brought them into conflict with the Governor-General of Ears, the Shoa-es-Saltaneh, the second son of the Shah. As these robberies were allowed to go unpunished last year and the previous year, the Kuhgelus have become more daring and several robberies of considerable magnitude have occurred during this summer, so that the Bakhtiari Chiefs are beyond measure incensed at the state of affairs ; to add to their discontent, the Government ignores their complaints, put forward through His Majesty’s Legation, hut wires to them that the Legation are complaining of them and the robberies oi Messrs. Lynch’s goods and why do they not pay up, that they must do so at once, and that a Commissioner is on his way to investigate the cases, thus completely reversing the situation. As I told you in my telegram No. 40 of the 22 nd October, the Khans unless they obtain redress, and are allowed to pursue the robbers, propose to declare the road unsafe and shut it up for caravan traffic. Such was what Haji Ali Kuli Khan told me more than once was their intention, but just before leaving Chahar Mehal, Samsam-es-Saltaneh, the Eel Khane, said he did not approve of such a drastic measure and that he would try to stop the robberies by increasing the £&lt; tufangchis ” on the road. 1 may point out here that the question of the Kuhgelus now assumes an additional importance as the Concessions Syndicate will commence work near Ram Hormuz, only some 8 miles from their country. These robberies rendered the Khans most sensitive on the road question in every way. It is a matter of much regret to me that, with reference to the 3,000 tomans, which they had agreed to give Messrs. Lynch Brothers to repair the road, there seems to have been a double mistake. In the first place, Messrs. Lynch’s letter, inclosed in Legation despatch No. 12 of the 3 rd May, 1905, owing to my going on leave, appears not to have been communicated to the Khans. Then, when the Khans offered to Messrs. Lynch’s agent this amount, he declined to receive it. I have tried to persuade the Khans to pay the 3,000 tomans in the coming year, plus the 1,000 tomans lor 1906, but they decline to entertain the idea, nor will they now pay in even the 1,000 tomans, as they say they can repair the road themselves at a much less cost than would be incurred by Messrs. Lynch. I informed them that the road w r as now r managed by the Persian i ransport Company and had three Directors to look after it, Mr. Lynch being one °1 the Directors. I had been asked at home by Mr. Lynch and Colonel Picot to see if itLU Lllvy Ivilcl lio, wi v O i j i • i. i- F 4-1 explained that, owing to the way they utilized the road to take their taxes out ot the tribes, and the inextricable way this and the levying of the road tax was mixed up, it was quite impossible to entertain the idea that to sell the road was to sell themse ves, and was not to be thought of. , , „ ^ . . . , , , • i j. At the present moment the general outlook for this road is not too bright, but things will go on in the same old way if the robberies by the Kuhgelus are stoppe^ouid . t h that in the future Haji Mi Kuli Khan comes out as Eel Khane, I can only suggest that Colonel Picot, who is a very great friend o his, and stands very well with him, should go out to the Bakhtiari country and see him. It is more than probable that he may succeed in making a satisfactory arrangement with him lor the well-being of the road. November 24, 1905. (Signed) J. B. PREECE. Telegram from the Atabeg to Sirdar Assad. According to what the British Legation state, besides the robbery which took place some time ago on the Bakhtiari Road, and of which a copy of the things robbed was sent to you by the Foreign Office, and which you have not recovered yet, again, lately, a few'loads of cloth and loaf sugar, and a sum of money in cash, &amp;c., have been robbed by the Kuhgelu tribes on the Bakhtiari Road, and you have not taken any steps at all to recover them. This matter has been brought to the notice ot I is Majesty, and has made His Majesty very angry, and he has ordered that I should te you that, notwithstanding the strict orders which have always been given about . ic security of the road, and especially when you were taking leave, why should the road be so insecure? Then what is the use of you, who are the Eel Ivham of the Bakhtiari tribes, and very powerful, and who are responsible to the Government f it is clear, when the security of the road is in your charge, it they come horn any other place and district and commit robberies, you have to be called to account, ami how is it possible that you should not know who the thieves and robbers are and from which tribe they have been ? In any case, your duty is to lolhm and captui e them and take back the things stolen, and not co fold your hands and bring forward the excuse that the robbers have come from other districts, and that it has no con nection with your administration, and so to neglect your work and be the cause of complaints. Anyhow, according to His Majesty’s orders, a special Commissionei has been sent from here. After the arrival of the Commissionei, you mus accor * 11 -y . * the copy which the Foreign Office will send you, give him the value o the things m full; and afterwards also, if any robbery is to occur, whether the robbcis be horn the Kuhgelu tribes or other places, you have to tollow them up, and when you follow their track to the end of your district, you have to stop your horsemen there and immediately inform us who the robbers are, and to which tribe they belong, and w mi e they have gone. After you inform us, instructions will be given without delay for following and capturing them. And, according to this arrangement, if another time I hear anything about the disorder of that place, or it any complaint be made by &gt; British Legation on this subject, you will be severely called to account and seriously responsible. According to His Majesty’s orders, the value of the things robbed up to date is to be paid without excuses. The Special Commissioner has been appointed and sent to take the compensation as soon as possible and to inform us. Telegram from the Aiabeg to Sirdar Assad. According to what the British Legation say and from information received, two oads of cloth and two loads of loaf sugar belonging to Lynch and Co., and some ot le thffits belonging to muleteers, their value being 2,865 tomans have been robbed between Sarkhan and Dupulan ; also sixteen mules and four donkeys, and a quunti yof merchandize, have been robbed at Pul Amarat. According to His Majesty’s orders, it has been decided that the local authorities are responsible for robberies, whether the robber belong to the district or come from other places and commit a , robbery. The duty of the local authorities is to capture them and to take back the s v , robbed tilings. Therefore, without fail, recover either what has been taken or else v^heir value, and speedily give them to their owners, and inform me of the result as ; soon as possible. Report on the Negotiations with the Chiefs of the Bakhtiari Tribes for the Exploitation of Naphtha in their Country. When I returned to Isfahan from leave, on the 28th September, I already learnt J, that the state of affairs prevailing among the Bakhtiari Chiefs was very different to what I had left it in the spring of the year, and it became evident to me that it would prove no easy job to induce them to accept terms to open up their country to the exploring parties of the Syndicate for the exploitation of naphtha which would he at all acceptable to the Company. When I got to Shalamzar, the village of the Eel Khane, Samsam-es-Saltaneh, I found all the Khans assembled there, with the exception of the Haji Ali Kuli Khan. Unfortunately, owing to the illness of the Moin-i-Humayum and his wife, the Shahab-es-Saltaneh had to leave next day for Ardal. The lady died before he got there. w* The Shahab-es-Saltaneh’s absence from the conferences was a great loss to me, as he is my great friend and the one on whom I mainly relied for support. However, I had two long talks with the Samsam-es-Saltaneh and the Shahab-es-Saltaneh, and had the question of boring for naphtha well in train with them before the latter had to leave. Had I only had to deal with these two Chiefs I should have arranged the whole thing in two or three days, very much on the lines sanctioned by the Company ; but in the evening Haji Ali Kuli Khan appeared on the scene like a whirlwind, and swept all the previous arrangements away. He was elected their spokesman, and all the arrangements afterwards made were done with him. He commenced by agreeing to the money terms, but only for guards, &amp;c., stating that the Chiefs would not lease a yard of their country for money, but that they must be partners in the concern. He then began talking of 20 per cent, of the profits and suchlike nonsense. It was a very difficult matter keeping one’s temper with him—especially for me, as I was extremely ill—as his manner was extremely offensive. He particularly was objectionable over the watch and gun which, owing to the kindness of Lord Lansdowne, I had presented to the Eel Khane and Eel Beggi on the part of His Majesty’s Government, and which had been accepted with much effusion by those persons ; but the Haji dilated on the i point that the Chiefs of the Bakhtiari were able to buy such things for themselves, and that he had arranged with Sir Arthur Hardinge that for the future such presents * should not be given; that if His Majesty’s Government wished to do the Khans honour they might send them decorations. They would he appreciated and Tvould have some use—not like those which had. been distributed wholesale in Tehran among a worthless lot of people, who could never be of any use to His Majesty’s Government, like the Bakhtiari might be. This subject was referred to again and again in the various talks I had with the Haji. However, to return to the question of agreement. I pointed out to him that his proposal was absurd, and that last year only 10 per cent, had been asked for. After a discussion lasting over four days and a removal from Shalamzar to , Janagun, their proposals were at last reduced to the limited money terms and 5 per cent, of fully paid up ordinary shares of all shares issued in any Companies created to work naphtha in the Bakhtiari country. They have great faith in the capacity of their oil-bearing country; they think that Baku will be nothing to it in comparison. They continually dwelt on this point. They describe the oil-belt as being about lOO miles long by about from 8 miles to 12 miles broad, running in a north-westerly direction from east of Bam Hormuz to north-east of Shuster. There is one place known as Maidan-i-Man Kaftan (the plain of much naphtha) to the east of Shuster, which is full of naphtha according to them. However, we had got to a working agreement, which was wired home for acceptance. The terms seemed to me to be fairly good ones, and very much better than I ever expected to get at one time. The reply was a long time in coming, and I was continually working at the Chiefs, telling them that I did not think that their proposal would be agreed to. [1804 w-— 1 ] Ca During this time also the two Chiefs i-^hip'he mutt^me that, out of consideration for me and to ^centua e th insis { ing on a limit of ^ to some arrangement, so that when Mr D Arcy s repiy ea , shares, the Hadji was in a he at first proposed to take 5 per cent. of.. ^ On learning the refusal of the term &gt; v.„i„ nce i SSU ed.

Ultimately, at my suggestion, they 'greett to ac&lt;^ i without any limit, and at that figure the agreemen getting such good I may frankly say that T am beyond mea^e^surpmed at^ ^ ssrxi rri Br«r s j - - *»— were most embarrassing at times. th wbo i e a ff alr wa s After I sent off my wire proposing the 3 P“ ,f ^ ceptin „ t i ie Agreement, nearly upset.

But while instructing Lieutenant Ranking m this sense, I have informed him that I am unable to agree with his interpretation of article 2 of the agreement between Mr. D’Arcv and the khans m 190o, and have explained that that agreement had reference solely to oil m the Bakhtiari country and that article 2 clearly refers to shares in companies formed for the working of oil m that country, of which I understand there are now two in existence, \iz., the hist Exploitation Company and the Bakhtiari Oil Company. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1 . Consul Ranking to Sir G. Barclay. (No. 76.) k lr ’ Camp, Ispahan, August 4, 1909. L\ accordance with your Excellency’s telegram No. 26 on the subject of the oil shares due to the Bakhtiari khans, I have the honour to submit the following observa tions :— 1. It would appear from the clause in the agreement between Mr. W. K. D’Arcy and the khans, an extract of which is attached herewith, that such remuneration, outside an increase of guard money, as is due to the khans is to be calculated not on t e capital of any one company or companies, but on the number of ordinary shares issued and fully paid up. 2 . I would beg to point out that it most distinctly states in this clause that “ 3 per cent, of all the ordinary shares issued,” &amp;c., shall be given; and, further, that no allocation of shares has been made to the various companies whereby the oil company could justify the allotment to the khans of a smaller number of shares as being the ’ of so many shares appertaining to such and such companies working in Bakhtiari country, instead of 3 per cent, on the total of shares issued (600,000) and Lilly paid up, as is apparently their due. 3. That there is no stated connection between the words u after formation of one or more companies to work oil in the Bakhtiari country ” and the words “ 3 per cent, of all the ordinary shares issued.” It appears that the intention, at the time when the agreement was made, was to give the khans 3 per cent, of the total number of ordinary shares issued, otherwise some determinatory expression, such as “ appertaining to the companies working in akhtiari country,” would have been inserted after the word “ issued,” thereby clearly .“g number of shares due to the khans to 3 per cent, of those appertaining to Lie company or companies working in the Bakhtiari country. [2451 7 —2]To sum up, then, it would appear that the Khans have a quite justifiable argument, based on the wording of the share clause of the agreement, in claiming 3 per cent, of the total number of shares issued. £- I have not as yet communicated with the manager of the Anglo-Persian Ct^ ' Company on this subject, but await your Excellency’s further decision on the subjeci, which I have the honour to request that you will communicate to me by telegram.

This would be deplorable because if the affairs of the Company are to be pros perous those relations must be good. Moreover, Rankins and Wilson would find themselves in a very false position towards the representatives of the Company which would hardly be fair to them. (2) That nothing was actually proved against the Company so that we had no right to assume their guilt to the ex tent we should have had we adopted your suggestion.Viie therefore merely asked them for a statement, which, now that we have got it, seems satisfactory at least on paper. There doubtless remain ways in which the Com pany, if so minded, may swindle the Khans in practice, e*g« by diverting into some other channel the profits which, by rights, should be counted to the two Com panies in which the Khans have shares, but I do not see how any precautions which we may take now can possibly guard against such a contingency. You will doubtless let us know in due course whether you and Ranking are satisfied with the Com pany 1 s statement.:opy- FOREIGN OFFICE, Septembar fO 1909 (35286/09).

In the absence of Maxwell, I answer your letter 'private and confidential' of the 20th about the position of the Bakhtiari Khans with regard to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The despatch promised by Barclay (see Max well's letter of August 5th) reached us by post on August 20th and I send you a copy herewith as well as a copy of a private letter to Mallet on the same sub jectsubject which accompanied it. You will see that Barclay is in pardonable doubt as to what the interpretation of the prospectus, read in connexion with D'Arcy’s agreement with the Khans, really is, since Preece’s language to Churchill does not appear to square with that of Reynolds to the Serdar Muhtashem (though the apparent meaning of the latter may not be the real meaning and may only be due to lack of precision in the mode of expression.) Ranking, as you will observe, agrees with Lori- mer in believing that the Company desire to evade their obligations tov/ards the Khans. Barclay wishes us to put Lorimer's and Ranking's despatches before the Company, but there appear to us to be two good reasons against literally adopting thisthis course:- tirst, that they practically accuse the Company of sharp practice so that, if we com municated them to the Company it might look as though we assumed that this accusation was true, which would he unfair to the Company: and, second, that such a step could hardly fail to embitter the relations of the Company and of their representatives on the spot with the writers of the despatches which would be unfair to the latter and would, moreover, hamper them in their v/ork of looking after the company’s interests. If the business is to run smoothly out there the re lations of the Consul with the Company’s representa tives ought to be the best. In these circumstances we have decided simply to telltell the Company there appears to he some douht as to the exact position of the Khans with regard to the companies to he formed and to ask for an authoritative statement on the subject.

The o-^neral impression conveyed to the irhsns by this letter was that the Anglo—Persian Oil Coy intended only to Pive them 3$ of shares calculated on the capital of the Bakhtiari Oil Coy,that is to say on £300,000.which they very correctly worked out to 9,000 £1 shares. Moreover this would anpear to be the intention of the A.P.O.Coy,otherwise why did they not simply say that the capital of tie A.P.O.Coy was 2,000,000 £.?

ITow the total number of ordinary shares issued was 600,000.- 3^ of which is 18,000 £1 shares or exactly double^the A.P.O.Coy's letter to the Khans led them to believe was their due.

My Dear Mallet:- My despatches Nos. 89 and 148. You will notice that Lorimer is not the only man who fears that the oil people are doing the Khans in the eye. Lorimer you will remember feared that the Companies which are to extract oil from the Bakhtiari territory, which under existing arrangements will apparently be the only ones in which the Khans are given a share, will not be the most remunerative ones. At first I was inclined to agree with him that the Anglo Persian Oil Company was hard on the Khans in that they were to be given no shares in it, for that Company, which is for the purpose of working a concession to 'search for, develop, carry away and sell petroleum, etc.' will presumably make profits on the handling and refining of oil extracted from the districts covered by the First Exploitation Company and the Bakhtiari Oil Com pany, as well as on the handling etc., of oil from elsewhereelsewhere. Preece however has written us so positively that there has been no idea of evading the Khan’s rights that I felt hound to advise toning down my re marks in my Mo. 148 if you wrote to the Company and in deed I think the Company could possibly make out a good case for only paying the Khans their y/c allotment of shares in Companies working in Bakhtiari territory. Now Ranking raises another point which 1 think is pretty certainly based on a misapprehension due to the clumsy wording of Reynold's letter to the Serdar Muhta- sham of May 28th, 1909. I hope you will see your way to put both Lorimer's and Ranking's despatches before the Company. They may think it worth while conciliating the Khans by a liberal interpretation of the agreement and give them a small allotment in the big Company. Yours ever, \ (Signed) G. Barclay.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govermnp.nt.] PERSIA. [August 20.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [31382] No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Auqust 20.) (No. 148.) ‘ y V y ' Gulahek, July 29, 1909. IN my despatch No. 89 of the 28th April I forwarded copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz on the subject of the shares to be allotted to the Bakhtiari khans of several companies to be formed for the exploitation of the oil-fields of Arabistan. In this despatch Captain Lorimer expressed his fears lest the interests of the khans might be ignored, and at the time I vras inclined to think that there might be some ground for his fears. Subsequently I had the opportunity of perusing a private letter from Mr. Preece to a friend in Tehran (extract enclosed), which left me in some doubt as to whether my first impression was correct, and after a further study of the prospectus of the newly-formed Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and of the agreement with the Bakhtiaris, I dispatched my private telegram to Sir C. Hardinge of the 28th May. The question of the treatment of the khans by the company has now again been raised in a despatch from Mr. Banking, copy of which I have the honour to enclose herewith. In this despatch Mr. Ranking gives extracts of a letter addressed by Mr. G. B. Reynolds, general manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to the Sardar Muhtasham, the terms of which are far from clear, and are certainly open to an interpretation differing from that given in Mr. Preece’s letter. I have, in reply, instructed Mr. Ranking to point out to the manager of the company the misleading impression conveyed to the khans by his letter to the Sardar, but it might also be well to suggest to the company that, in order to prevent future misunderstanding, it should be made perfectly clear to the khans how they stand as regards the different companies. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Ranking to Sir G. Barclay. (Confidential.) Sir, Camp Ispahan, July 18, 1909. I HAVE the honour to address your Excellency on the subject of the shares due to the Bakhtiari khans from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. During my recent tour through the Bakhtiari country I obtained information that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had written to the khans with regard to the shares due to them under agreement. A translated extract of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s letter, inasmuch as it deals with the question of shares, is given below. Extract of a Letter in Persian, and signed by Mr. G. B. Reynolds, General Manager Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to the Sardar Muhtasham, dated May 28, 1909. “ (Compliments.) “ In accordance with a letter No. 328, dated the 22nd April, 1909, from my directors, telling me to give you the following information, I would inform you that a company has been floated under the name ‘ Anglo-Persian Oil,’ and a second under the name ‘ Bakhtiari II [? Oil] Company,’ which latter will work in the Bakhtiari country. “ In accordance with the agreement made with their Excellencies the Bakhtiari chiefs, the latter will receive 3 per cent, of shares from these companies. That is to say, that their Excellencies the khans will receive 3 per cent, calculated on the capital of all companies which may work in the Bakhtiari country. [2377 u —3]“ The capital of the Bakhtiari II [? Oil] Company is 300,000/., and the price of each share is 1 /.” The general impression conveyed to the khans by this letter was that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company intended only to give them 3 per cent, of shares calculated a 11 e capital of the Bakhtiari Oil Company, that is to say, on 300,000/., whic y - y correctly worked out to 9,000 1/. shares. Moreover, this wonld appeal to be the intention of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, otherwise why did they not simply say that the capital of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was 2,000,000/. . The paragraph dealing with the allotment of shares to the Bakhtians and Imperial Majesty the Shah reads as follows in the prospectus issued by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company :— “In the first-named company (the First Exploitation Company Limited^ Kb I mperial Majesty the Shah of Persia and other persons hold 50,000 inUy-pant shares, and in the second-named company (Bakhtiari Oil Company, Limited), as we a ‘ ^ other company that extracts oil from their territories, the chiefs of the Bakhtiari peop will be entitled to 3 per cent, of the shares fully paid which percentage will, so far as the original capital of the two companies is concerned, be provided by this con p t y. The clause in the original agreement with the Bakhtiari khans with regard to the allotment of shares reads as follows: ‘‘Extractfrom Agreement between Mr.W. K. D'Arey and the Concessions Syndicate ' (Limited) on 9 fhe one side, hereinafter called the First Party, and the Bakhtiari khans on the other, hereinafter called the Second Party. “ Further also, after the formation of one or more companies to work oil m the Bakhtiari Oil Company, and after the oil has passed through the pipes, the first party undertakes to give^to^the second party 3 per cent, of all the ordinary shares issued, which shares must be fully paid up.” Now it appears that the above clause in the agreement admits of a quibble ; that is to say from the oil company’s point of view, it may be argued that the woidmg “ after the formation of one or more companies to work oil in the Bakhtiari country, the first party undertakes to give to the second party 3 per cent, of all the ordinary shares issued ” means that 3 per cent, of the ordinary shares appertaining to this company alone are to be given. On the other hand, it may be argued, from the khan s point of view, that the wording “ after the formation of one or more companies to work 01 m the Bakhtiari country, and after the oil has passed through the pipes, js nu y chronological, and fixes a time when the shares must be given and that hence the rest of the paragraph in question, namely, “ the first party undertakes to give to the second party 3 per cent, of all the ordinary shares issued, entitles them to 3 pei cent, of the total number of ordinary shares issued by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Now the total number of ordinary shares issued was 000,000, o per cent, of whic is 18,000 1/. shares, or exactly double what the Anglo-1 ersian Company s letter to t e khans led them to believe was their due. ^ , At present the Bakhtiari khans are too much taken up with the part they are playing in the national movement to be able to devote any thought to their own affairs, but a time must surely come when, sooner or later, they will be able to attend to their own affairs, and then one of them, more clear-headed than the rest, may see the other interpretation of the share clause in the agreement, or they may be put up to it by people more accustomed to deal with such matters than themselves If such were to happen, i.e .,the khans, having been allotted 3 per cent, on 300,000/. by the oil company, were afterwards either to think, or have put into their heads, that they have not been fairly treated, it would have both a most deleterious effect on all the company s future dealings and negotiations with the khans, and, the Bakhtiaris finding it difficult to differentiate between the oil company and Messrs. Lynch Brothers in every respect, it would react also to the latter company’s great detriment m then relations with the ^ Further, as the oil company, together with Messrs. Lynch Brothers, represent to the Bakhtiari khans the honesty and integrity of British commerce and trade, it won be deplorable that either the khans should have the slightest grounds for thinkingrv th Ti!r Ve8 C j eate ?. out of their j ust du es, or that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, after quibbling ami making a stand, should have to give in with a bad grace. t would be better for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, having originally made an finn e nno eU, 'rr Uch u , dmlts °. f ^ qu* 131116 . to give the Bakhtiari khans their 3 per cent, on 600,000 ordinary shares with a show of generosity rather than endanger ( 1 ) their future prospects of amicable relations with the khans, more especially as the Indian oil guard khan^ f fTOm th6 0 il i e ^ S; (2) the preSl3nt S 0 °d frame of mind of the khans towards the oil company; and (3) the successful working of the new guarding arrangement Such being the case I would beg to request your Excellency’s decision on the exact meaning to be attached to the share clause ; and secondly, if your Excellency is of opinion that the 3 per cent, shoidd be calculated on 000,000/. that 1 may be permitted to obtain information either directly from the oil company’s’ repre sentative in Ahwaz, or through His Majesty’s Legation, what the actual intentions of the oil company are, so that the whole question maybe settled before the ultimate allotment ot shares.

To take in their order the points noticed by Wilson in his letter to Cox:- We do not see that we need complain of the fact that, by the memorandum of association, the operations of the Company are not limited to Persia. Passing to the prospectus Itself, it is doubtless a somewhat highly coloured document which presentspresents the prospects of the enterprise in the best possible light, a tendency which is characteristic of prospectuses in general. Wilson, I see, practi cally accuses the Company of downright misrepresenta tion, but even talcing the case at its worst, it is not clear what action we can usefully take as regards the points which he numbers 1 to 9 . we are m no way responsible for the proceedings of the Company which is a private concern entirely beyond our control in which the public must invest or not as they please. Judging by the merits of the enterprise so far as they are able to ascertain them. It appears to as that our o nl y obligation In con- nsxlon with the Company is to give it our political support in the transaction of Its business In Persia. AsAs to the fom which that eupport should take, the Company Itself must he the host judge as regards wha. measures will contribute to the success of Its enter prise, Since it has agents on the spot to advise it. The same observations appear to apply to points 12 to 14 and to the paragraphs (unnumbered) at the end of Wilson's letter, as regards which we do not think that we have any ground for Interference. With regard however to points 10 and 11 the case appears to he different. If the Bakhtlarl Khans are Using unfairly treated and If advantage is being taken of their Ignorance of business, we have not only the right but the duty to Intervene for their protection, hot lees on moral than on political grounds, since their—their friendship i B important to us from a general point of view. So long ago as April 28tli Barclay .rote a des patch enclosing reports from Longer and Wilson In »hlch accusations practically Identical nth those no. in question .ere orought against the Company. i send you for your Infomatlon a copy of this despatch from which you nil see that Barclay strongly advo cates an appeal to the sense of fairness of the Com- pany on the subject. However, on May 28th, while the despatch was stll on Its way, Barclay telegraphed privately to Hardlnge that he believed that It .as based on a mlsapprehenslor and that the Interests of the Khans were properly recognized.recognized. He therefore begged that, if a letter »aa written to the Company, his remarks might be toned down. In consequence of this telegram no action was taken on the despatch .hen It was received on June 7th. As two more successive bags have no. arrived from Tehran without an, further report on the subject, we telegraphed on august 3rd. to ask Barclay whether «e are to expect another Despatch and he has Replied that should .each us by post about August 17th. He adds that his private telegrm of May 28th was based on a le.ter from Preece, according to which the Khans' interests had been properly respected. He has now received a further despatch from the Consul at Sh.az, whichwhich he is forwarding to us, that a letter from the Manager from which it would seem to the Khans Is open to misconstruction as regards the number and or the shares to which they are entitled. natureWhether this may or may not warrant excluding the 7^°“ in all companies making a profit from the od before it is P ut dl’cSon least before it is exported from Persia, is perhaps open to quest , ; , , Tin favour of the syndicate, it would seem to me necessary to be P^ared to t^ steps to secure a fair consideration of the rights of the ^“ k ^ technical matters not qualified to effectively watch over their own interests m tec Sfiir TStii 1^7.“= LSKSiK. t*&gt; of tk j s ®xtase the first company would only be nominally a business concern, and its shares, including the 3 per cent, of them given to the khans, would bear little or no interest, and have a very low market value. settled but it 4 .

LORIMER, Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant Wilson to Consul Lorimer. ,, , t Maidan Minaftun, February 10, 1909. y fwENT to’HaftShahidun with Reynolds yesterday, he was hoping to find an ell show there of which he had heard, but we could not find it. in the course ot conversation he told me that he considered it highly probable, if not certain, that when ?Wew compam or companies are floated to work the Bakhtiari oil, one company will be floated to obtain oil in the Bakhtiari country, and another to construct the pip Rn^refinerLs^ and 1 torefine the oil, &amp;c. The first named will simply sell oil to he second He spoke of this arrangement as designed to prevent the Bakhtians ha\ mg in reality 3 ner cent of the ordinary shares issued for the whole concern, as such a figure^was^ absurdly 'large. The khLs would get 3 per cent, of the ordinary shares of tbp first-named company, but nothing in the second-named company. . When I expressed some doubt as to the legality of such an arrangemen , m view of the agreement with the Bakhtiari, he said that he himself was fully convinced that they were within their legal and moral rights m making such an h ^ rr ^^ e ? ' M or ^ MacCrorie tells me that the companies will probably be floated m . ) thereabouts^ ^ n ( as numbered by you) of the agreement between D’Arcy and the khans I should say that, at first sight, the khans would seem to be entitled to 3 ner cent of all the ordinary shares issued by all the various companies floated i connS with BTktiari oil,'in the same way that the Pers.au Government get 10 per cent, of the net profits of all companies formed to work oil in 1 ersia. Of course this view may be erroneous, but I mention the matter to you in order that, should you desire to do so, you may hear Reynolds on 'f - Cop/. TEHRAN, April 28th 1909. i Eo.8^ |(21105) Sir:- -i** V'' . y°- 1 nave t,he ilon °ur to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz respecting the alleged in tention of one Oil Syndicate to make over to the Bakhtiari Qians, in pursuance of their agreement with them, 3% of the ordinary shares of one only of the several Companies which are to be formed for the exploitation of the oil fields in Arab- is^an. That this is in very fact the intention of the Syndi cate appears to me evident from a perusal of the prospectus issued by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a copy of which is in my possession. Captain Lorimer justly remarks that 'the Khans are not \ qualilied effectively to watch over their own interests in technical matters of business of which they have no under- standing”. Should the promoters of the Anglo-Persian Cil Company seek to ta,:e advantage of this ignorance by an arrangement wnich, even if in accordance with the letter, cynically dis- ^ ' regards Edward Grey, Bart.disregards the spirit of their written agreement with the Khans, they will only have themselves to thank if the latter when they eventually discover the evasion practised upon them, do all they can to obstruct the conduct of mining oper ations. It will be within the recollection of Ur. d’Arcy at least, that during the period when experimental boring operations were being conducted and at moments when the prospects oi the ultimate success of the enterprise w r ere anything but cheerful, this Legation lias more than once strenuously advocated resistance to demands, almost amounting to blackmail, made upon the Syndicate by the Chiefs. The Chiefs then had the whip-hand: now it has passed to the Syndicate and I trust it is not too late to appeal to their sense of fairness to afford in this matter to the Khans generous treatment, which is so obviously in the interests of all concerned.

Its present rate is a^out 300 barrels and the general opinion is that it is not choked but giving out. (6) Boverton Redv/ood’Report is misleading, e.g. fa) only one well is spouting, not several (b) it is not in any way proved that further profitable oil fields exist, though it is probable. 5S£i The petroleum indications near Bebahan are fanciful. The Southern one has never been visited, and depends upon an un verified report, and on the v el1ef of ?'r. Reynolds that Zaitun on the map means oil, that is to say kerosene ! ! Its real name is Saidun, I am not at all certain that the Shiraz 'indications” are not frauds also, I do not think they rest on ocular evidence. 10. The Bakhtyari Khans who are entitled to 3 £ of the shares of any company or companies formed to work oil in their terin a 'Bakhtyari Oil Company’' a eubsidiary concern all the chares in which are held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. There is no guarantee of interest on thece shares, and moreover the 'Bakhtyari Oil Company’' is apparently restricted to opera tions in territory other than Ma id an T.Tinuftun, the only paying spot at present, or likely to be for some years to come. The ’’one square mile” worked by the 1st Exploitation Company will anparently consist of bits of land here and there selected at will to the detriment perhaps of the latter Company. 11. The pipe line is to be erected by the inglo-Persian Oil pk Company and the profits of this and^refinery will p-o to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company alone. The Bakhtyarie will have no share of 3 T in the capital spent on these works. 12. The cost of pipe line etc., is put down at £ 300,000 ; local opinion of engineers is much nearer £ 8,00,000. 13. There seems no reason to think that the Admiralty will be anxious to obtain oil-fuel from a Company whose supply is derived from a pipe line 130 miles long through a foreign and perhaps hostile country. 14.14. It is estimated that the pip© lino, refinery etc. , v.i^l te erected in less than 3 years. I think they will he lucky to complete it in five years. TIo commencement has yet been made or will he made till next cold weather. To sum up, the prospectus is one remarkable for what it does not say, and for its extremely optimistic tone - a tone which I cannot myself consider justified at present. Oil was first struck on 26th T;ay 1908 and since then practically nothing has been done. 4 more wells have been sunk, but stopped in each case ae soon as a smell of oil was reached, in order to prevent waste. Mamatain has been abandoned for the time being. T o steps have been taken to survey the ground traversed by the pipe ^ine which for 30 miles is very rocky and difficult. The Chief Engineer of the Company has not even been over it, though he might have gone. Until the winter, no steps can now be taken in this direction owing to the heat. negotiations are in progress regarding a refinery citeat Abbadan, but the ground selected and the approaches to it from the TTorth, have never been visited by an engineer of toe Company. In both cases the Company has relied mainly on my own maps and reports. Fhe t'anaper, Hr. Reynolds, is now off on 6 months’ leave, leaving a rtuhordinate without any freedom of action, in charge, and we may assume that heyond boring 3 or 4 more wells nothing will be done till next year. Meanwhile, time flies and in 1961 the '’ompany’s concession lapses, and plant, pipe line. rights,etc., fall into the hands of Persia without any compensation. Yours sincerely, (Sd) A. T. Wilson.

It may also be advisable to form hereafter other subsidiary Companies to develo^ t! ^ portions of so large a territory. 1 ^ L ’ ler The Concession, in addition to granting the above privileges, also grants (a) freedom from all taxes and import d t' on all material necessary for the working and development of the deposits and for the construction of the pipe lines • T) fr d 163 from all imposts and taxes on all products exported; (c) the exclusive right to lay pipe lines from the oil fields'^ up'10°^ Persian Gulf, as also the necessary distributing branches ; (D) the right to acquire free of cost all uncultivated lands belonmna \ the State which maybe necessary for the construction of the Company’s works ; (e) the right to acquire at fair and current rates'’ ° cultivated lands belonging to the State and, with the consent of the proprietors, on such conditions as may be mutually arranmT other land and buildings (excluding holy places) that may be required. The Imperial Government of Persia binds itself to take afl the necessary measures to enable the Company to carry out the objects of the Concession, to ensure the safety of the Comom ’ plant and to protect the representatives of the Company. Under an agreement with the Chiefs of the Bakhtiari people tliv undertake to provide guards to protect all the employes and property of the Companies within the Bakhtiari territories and to indemnify the Companies against all robbery loss or damage, if any should occur in those territories. As consideration for all the above privileges, the Company is to pay to the Persian Government 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of all companies that may be formed to work the concession, and the Bakhtiari Chiefs are to be paid £3000 per annum, plus 3 per cent of the shares rf any company formed to work the oil in their territory. The Company has furthermore to pay to the Persian Government the sum of 2000 tomans (about £350) per annum as against the rent for three hand dug wells which have hitherto been let at this rental to native producers, and to pay a sum of £1000 per annum to the Imperial Commissioner appointed by the Persian Government I his Company is not formed for the purpose of purchasing a concession over lands with oil indications only which mav or may not justify the hopes to which they give rise, after the expenditure at the Shareholders’ risk of large sums of monev It is formed to acquire oil fields which have been proved highly petroliferous at the expense and risk of the Concessionaire and of The Burmah Oil Company, Limited, and is not a mere venture, but an undertaking with the established basis of productive Oilfields wXHTn nHlo TTT 6 neC f S T y f m T S for transporting and refining the petroleum already found and for sinking further nflh In ° ther wor d s the Company mstead of risking its money on speculative operations during the next few years repays the cost of the highly successful operations of the past few years. 7 ■ ’ p } ne cosc concession covers the whole of the area coloured green on the accompanying map, which is referred to in Sir Boverton character ITTttZTh 7 Z' ’ of the L™ 8 ' Em P ire . and '= “'V'. «&lt;&gt;» only as regards the favourable te * 1 t , ’ b 1 , lso In res P ect of the immense extent of petroliferous territory which it embraces.

It is common knowledge that the British Navy has hitherto been hampered in its desire to bstitute Oil for Coal by the difficulty of ensuring regular supplies when they are most wanted—in time of war—and that it has S onsequently lon°- been desirous of seeing other sources of supply opened up. Hitherto Burma (where the Admiralty has Contracts vith The Burmah Oil Company, Limited) has been practically the only source of supplies in regular quantities in the British nominions The outlet of this Company’s Pipe lines, though not in the British Dominions, will be at the Head of the Persian Gulf and so under British control. The development of these fields is therefore calculated to be of immense benefit to the British Navy, and substantial contracts for Oil Fuel may be confidently looked for from the Admiralty as soon as the Company’s works are in’ a sufficiently forward state to enable it to enter into them. . , . 0 The Burmah Oil Company, Limited, of 175, West George Street, Glasgow, purchased Mr. D’Arcy s interests in the Concession, &amp;c., and the Shares of the First Exploitation Company, Limited (so far as not previously acquired by the Concessions Syndicate, Limited) m consideration of 170 000 Ordinary Shares of the Burmah Oil Company, Limited, credited as fully paid, representing at the market price of thedavanoroximately £900,000, in addition to the sum hereinafter mentioned, being the cash expended by Mr. D’Arcy in connection with the Concession.

Preference Share dividend for a period of lice years. The Burmah Oil Company has undertaken this obligation in order that the Preference Shareholders may receive a half-yearly dividend from the outset instead of waiting until the refinerief, plant and pipe line have been erected and are in full working order It ^ * ha ‘*= 7 /“^ completed in less than three years, but the guarantee covers a period of five years.
