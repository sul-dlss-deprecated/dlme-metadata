They ravaged the whole country indiscriminately for several years, and it was 'Ahmad, then commander ot t jC the fortress Sohar, who succeeded in expelling them a.d. | 1741. In recognition of his eminent services, the people j elected him ruler of the country. The second book con tains the history of his reign and that of his descendants 1 from a .d. 1741 as far as 1804. The first two books were composed during the reign of Sa'id b. Sultan (that is, before 1856), and dedicated to a nephew of this prince, Sayyid Hamid b. Salim b. Sultan. The third book was composed after the death of Sa'id '(19th Oc tober, 1856), whose history it contains. But it was not finished by the author himself, because at the end there is a note, dated 12th December, a.d. 1857, stating that it was finished by one Hamid b. Muhammad b. Razik, whilst the name of the original author is Salil. Accordingly Salil must have died between 19th October, 1856, and 12th December, 1857, and his work was finished by a relative of his, as we shall see hereafter. Mr. Badger calls the author, on the authority of his MS., Salil-bin-Razik. But this is a mistake for Salil b. Muham mad b. Razik. The author speaks in several places of his father and grandfather, who held successively the post of clerk of customs at Maskat, and played a not insignificant part in the history of Oman (?\ pp. 135, 148, 153, 158, 165, 204, 216, 222); his grandfather he calls Razik b. Bakhit, his father Muhammad b.-Razik. Hence it seems evident that that Hamid b. Muhammad b. Razik, mentioned in the note on p. 370, who continued and finished the work of Salil was his brother. Originally the ruler of Oman was called 'Imam. He was the religious and political head of the people and freely elected—according to the 'tenets of the 'Ibadiyya creed— but 'with a strong preference to the ruling family over strangers, and with a strong preference in favour of the son, not necessarily the eldest, of the last 'Imam over the other members of his family.' This title has become obsolete since the death of Sa'id b. 'Ahmad (between 1811 and 1821). During his actual rule, from a.d. 17 75 -17 79, he made himself so odious to his people that his son Hamid found it easy to insinuate himself with the people of Oman, and gradually obtain possession of all the forts, including Maskat. Hamid was acknowledged by all the chiefs; he resided at Maskat, and governed the country as an independent chief till his death in 1792. He re tained his former title ' Sayyid,' which means ' Prince of the royal house,' as all his successors have done up to the present time. Meanwhile his father Sa'id, the legitimate 'Imam, lived in retirement without having any influence on the affairs of the country, at Alrastak, and died unnoticed, between 1811 and 1821. By his death the 'Imama became vacant, but it has not been filled again. The 'Imama was superseded by the Siyada j the name being changed, the office remaining the same. Mr. Badger has doubtless rendered an important service to the history of the East ^by translating this work of Salil. With the exception of a portion of ' the opening book, which consists mainly of genealogies of the Arab tribes of Yemen r and a few irrelevant episodes and laudatory poems,' he hasare and the appendices; ' Un the litle ot imam, ' The ' Ibadiyy a,' ' An Account of the Murder of 'Ali,' will be found very useful for the general reader, though they scarcely contain anything that Is new to the professed scholar. For the benefit of those who find it tedious to wade through the monotonous account of the Arab chronicler, Mr. Badger has composed a history of Oman of his own, based upon , Salil's work. And this part ('Introduction and Analysis') is particularly valuable, because he has added an account of the latest history of the country from 1856 till 1870. For this task he was eminently fitted, being acquaint'ed hot only with the ^country, -but also with several of its leading men, for all which 'interesting matter we may refer to the ' Editor's Preface.' Not knowing the Arabic original whence this translation was made, we cannot judge whether it is accurate or not; but we can say this much, that it is very readable. Regard ing the numerous geographical names, the pronunciation of which was not always certain, we should have advised the translator to give not only his mode of reading them, but also the Arabic forms, as he found* them in his MS, In doubtful cases this would have greatly facilitated any attempt at emendation. A very valuable portion of his work, which contains such a store of positively new information, is that referring to the relations between the Wahhabis and Oman, which will have to be carefully perused by the future his torian ot A\ ahhabiism. Lastly, we may mention that Mr. Badger frequently criticizes the ' brilliant pages' (as he calls them) of Palgrave's Central and Eastern Arabia. He proves that all the assertions which Palgrave makes regard ing Oman are just ' a tissue of fallacies from beginning to en( ' notwithstanding which he loads the author with compliments! Ed.

Shortly after the death of the Seyyid Said-bin- Sultan, the sovereign of 'Oman and its East African dependencies, who died a.d . 1856, war became immi nent between his two sons, the late Seyyid Thu- wainy, who had succeeded to the Principality of'Oman, and the late Seyyid Majid, who claimed Zanzibar, the neighbouring islands, and the Arab settlements on the adjacent mainland. Actual hostilities were prevented by the friendly intervention of the Govern ment of Bombay, and the rival brothers eventually agreed to submit their differences to the arbitration of Lord Canning, then Viceroy of India, and to abide by his decision. As a preliminary measure, a Com mission, composed of Brigadier, now Sir William Coghlan, K.C.B., and myself, was appointed to report on the matters in dispute, a duty which involved per sonal interviews with the Seyyids both at Mdskat and Zanzibar. It was while so engaged at the for mer place, in 1860, that the Seyyid Thuwainy pre sented me with the original manuscript of this History. The work embraces the annals of 'Oman from the rise of Islam down to a very recent period, and is, I believe, unique in the continuity and fulness of itseditor's preface. narrative. The native records from which the earlier portions are compiled, if they ever came within their reach, have never, to my knowledge, been utilized by foreign authors either in the East or West. More over, the dearth of information from other sources respecting Oman in bygone ages is extraordinary. The most eminent Arabian historians, such as Abul- feda, el-Beladzory, et-Tabary, el-Makin,Ibn-Khaldun, and others, contribute little beyond incidental notices of the country, either before or during its dependence on the Eastern Khalifate. Of its subsequent progress under an indigenous Imamate they afford us no glimpses whatever. It is not surprising, therefore, that European scho lars have hitherto failed to supply the deficiency. Although the Portuguese held Maskat and several other towns on the coast for a century and a half, yet their annalists, as usual, throw scarcely a ray of light even upon the contemporary government of Oman, and we are indebted to the famous Carsten Niebuhr, who visited Maskat in 1765, for the first retrospective insight into the political condition of the 'Omanis. His resume of its antecedent history from the commencement of the sixteenth century, beyond which it does not extend, is substantially authentic, and surpasses in general accuracy the in dependent researches of subsequent writers. The Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv, for 18.%, comprise several papers on 'Om4n, past and present: one prepared by the late Colonel Robert Taylor in 1818, entitled Kxtracts from BrieJ Notes containing his-editor s preface. torical and other Information respecting the Province of Oman, opens with an account of the early immi gration of the Arab tribes from ^ emen and Nejd; but the process of extraction which the Brief Xotes appear to have undergone has deprived them of any real value which they may have possessed as a con tribution to the ancient history of Oman. The same Extracts, in a very diluted form, with a few glosses designed to be explanatory but positively erroneous, re-appear in the same volume of the Selections, dated four years later, under the signature of Mr. Francis Warden, Member of Council at Bombay. In 1835-6, Lieutenant J. Tl. Wellsted of the Indian Navy visited a considerable portion of Oman, and has given us in his Travels in Arabia the only trustworthy deli neation which we possess of the geography of the interior. Unfortunately, W ellsted s acquaintance even with colloquial Arabic was very limited, and he frankly avows that the difficulties which he had to encounter in the attempt to draw up an historical account of the province were insurmountable. The brilliant pages of Mr. William Gifford Palgrave s Central and Eastern Arabia supply the latest addi tion to our scanty knowledge of Oman and the 'Omanis. Well-read in Oriental literature, tho roughly conversant with Arab customs, a shrew d ob server and an accomplished writer, it i.s to bo regretted that his experience of the Principality v. as confined to a short sojourn at two or three towns on the coast. Equally is it to be deplored that, with such qualifications, he had no authentic records at beditor's preface. hand to aid him in compiling his comprehensive sketch of its history. He candidly tells us that he recounts the tale as he heard it from the inhabitants, and therefore it is no disparagement to him person- ally to say, that it is a tissue of fallacies from begin ning to end, proved to be such by the whole tenour of this work, the general authenticity of which is ad mitted by the intelligent of all parties in 'Oman. Respecting the Principality during the last half century, especially in its relations with the neigh bouring Arab tribes and also with the Wahhabis of Nejd, the volume of the Selections above referred to contains much miscellaneous information, communi cated to the Indian Government by successive Resi dents in the Persian Oulf. Some of these papers are admirable as records of current events alono- the coast, but they are either conspicuously meagre or decidedly misleading as regards the domestic con cerns and institutions of the country. For instance it is impossible to learn from the entire collection what were the functions and prerogatives of the Imamate; and until within the last ten years the order of succession to the sovereignty over 'Omdn was still a« moot point with our politicals, which required to be determined by special investigation. Even the native nomenclature is generally so dis torted that it is frequently impossible to identify the transliteration with the original. In this respect the latest oflicial dispatches are even worse than those of an earlier date, and betray an utter ignorance of the elements of the Arabic language.editor's preface. The course which I have taken with the author's narrative is this :—In the first place, I have omitted the opening Book, which upon examination was found to consist mainly of elaborate genealogies of the Arab tribes of Yemen, interspersed with occasional sketches of their migrations and subsequent settlements, copied for the most part from sources familiar to European Orientalists. From these genealogies, how ever, I have carefully culled every notice relating to the origin of the tribes now occupying 'Oman, and have availed myself of them in the Introduction to connect the period at which the author sets out with the antecedent history of the country, as far back as documentary evidence carries us. With the exception of the above named omission and a few irrelevant episodes and laudatory poems, I have given a translation of the whole work. Many readers will probably be wearied with the details ot petty wars and intestine broils, which constitute the main feature of the narrative ; on the other hand, however, it is only by a close study of a people, as they describe themselves, that a trustworthy appre ciation of their modes of thinking and acting, ol their social economy, and of their way of conducting them selves towards other people can be formed. Inci dental remarks and coincidences in connection with such matters, however trifling they may at first sight appear, on reflection are frequently found to shed light by which we are enabled to solve satisfactorily more important questions. To the true inquiiei with a political or historical object, particulars of theeditor's preface. r kind referred to are always valuable, for on them alone, in Lord Bacon's phrase, can he safely proceed to generals. Nevertheless, to assist those who prefer reading Oriental history relieved of its native tedious- ness, I have compiled in the Introduction to the translation a tolerably full analysis of the original, together with the conclusions which a careful colla tion of the different portions of it has enabled me to arrive at. In the next place, I have availed myself of all the materials within reach, both ancient and modern, to corroborate, modify, or illustrate the author's state ments. These will be found in the foot-notes ; and I have thrown into Appendices three dissertations, also a genealogical table of the ruling Al-Bu-Sa'id f dynasty, and a Postscript, in which the Persian Gulf terminus of the Eastern trade, prior to the capture of the Island of Hormuz by the Portuguese, is discussed. The first Appendix, on the Im^mate, will, I flatter myself, dispel the many fallacies which are still en tertained respecting that institution as it existed in Oman. The second, on the Ihadhiycih, contains a more satisfactory account of their creed than any hitherto published, and will serve to correct Mr, Pal- grave's serious misconceptions of their origin and doctrines. I am indebted to my esteemed friend, ' Frederick Ayrton, Esq., of Cairo, for having procured for me, from an authentic source, a summary de scription of their peculiar tenets. The document is the more valuable owing to the rare mention of the sect even by standard Muslim schoolmen and divines.editor's preface. I am under obligation to the same gentleman for the comprehensive narrative given in Appendix C, ot the Murder of the KhaUfah 'Aly-ihn-Ahi-Talih, Muham mad's Cousin arid Son-in-law, the event above all others in the history of Islam which gave rise to the primitive Khawdrij, or Schismatics, of whom the Ibad- hiyah are an offshoot. A right conception of these several topics is so indispensable to a clear nndei- standing of the politico-religious system of the 'Omanis, that the reader is advised to peruse the first three Appendices before taking up the narrative. I have endeavoured as far as possible to identify the localities occurring in the author-s narrative ; but our very limited knowledge of the geography of the interior has obliged me to pass over, without com ment, very many of which even the names are new to us. It is remarkable, and by no means creditable to the British Government in India, that notwith standing our intimate political and commercial rela tions with 'Oman for the last century, we know actually less of that country, beyond the coast, than Ave do of the Lake districts of Central Africa. Well- sted's is the only map of the province which we pos sess drawn up from personal obseivation , and al though he has incorporated into it two separate land journeys made by his companion. Lieutenant W hite- lock, from Bark ah to el-Masnaah and fiom Sliin t is across the promontory to Sharjah, it afloids littlt 01 no certain indication of the numerous towns and vil lages beyond the restricted routes of the travelleis. Its value, however, as a guide to the relative positioneditor's preface. of important places mentioned in these annals is con- sideial )le, and tlie latter liave enabled me to make some additions to the native nomenclature of the pro vincial subdivisions. I have also revised Wellsted's vei^ impeifeet spelling 1 of the Arabic names through out, and have comprised in the revision the littoral of the I ersian Gulf and the parts adjacent included in the map accompanying' this work. Some improve ment in that respect over the ' Chart of the Persian Gulf/' constructed by Captain Brucks of the Honour able Company's Marine, was made in the chart pub lished by the Admiralty in 1860, which embodies the more recent surveys by Commander C. G. Constable and Lieutenant A. W. Stiffe, both of the Indian Navy; but a great many of the names remain uncorrected, which if pronounced as transliterated into English would not be recognized by the Arabs. It is to be regretted that the Admiralty have omitted the names in the Arabic characters, which in Brucks's chart are printed together with the English. The 'view of Maskat on the map is from a photograph by the late Surgeon Welsh, who was attached to the Maskat-Zanzibar Commission. A few words respecting the translation : the Arabic copy from which it is made is written in a legible hand and in an easy style, which I have striven to preserve. The general absence, however, of vowel-points has rendered it very difficult to ascer tain the correct pronunciation of names, especially those of obscure localities. The original is undoubt edly the work of Salil-ibn-Razik, but several addi-editor's preface. tions appear to have been made to it by a different hand—notably the proem to the Biography of the late Seyyid Sa'id—which I am inclined to attri bute to the Muhammad-ibn-Ilazik, probably the author's brother, mentioned in the first colophon at the end of the volume. The concluding colophon gives the name of the transcriber, who has been very careless about dates. As a recognized transliteration of the Arabic into Roman characters is still a desideratum, I have eschewed any attempt at etymological exactness in that respect, and have simply endeavoured to convey the correct sound of the original as nearly as possible, without resorting to expedients unfamiliar to the general reader. I give to the consonants the same power as in English ; to the vowels the same sound generally as in Italian : a as in far; e as in beg; i as in pit; o as in store; u as lunar. The diphthongs ai and ei, like the ie in pie and the ei in vein respec tively. The vocal sound of ow in hoiv I express by au; when doubled in the same word, by aww, as in Tawwam. The Arabic suffix when used to denote an ordi nary or gentilic adjective I have represented by y, which somewhat in the same way constitutes the formative of many of our English adjectives, e.g., windy from wind, stormy from storm, etc. This ter minal y should be pronounced with a ringing Italian i sound. The acute accent ( y ) over a vowel denotes the syl lable to be accentuated ; attention to this expedienteditor's preface. will prevent such mispronunciations as Maskat in stead of Maskat. The circumflex ( A ) over a vowel prolongs it: i is equivalent to ee, u to oo. The apostrophe before a vowel is intended to express the guttural 'ain ; before a consonant the ellipsis of a preceding vowel. I have retained the prefix demonstrative article el wherever it exists as a substantive compound of the designation. Inattention to this peculiarity on the part of Europeans has frequently led to their being misunderstood by the Arabs. As no Arab would say el-Maskat or el-'Aden with the article, so neither would he say Rastak or Bahrein without it. a The word Al before a proper name is not the Ara bic article, but a noun signifying family or progeny, a e.g., Al- Wahibah, the Family of Wahibah. Bin, son, is an ellipsis for Ihn ; thus. Said-bin-Ahmed, Sa'id the son of Ahmed. Benu, the plural of Ihn, prefixed to a proper name, means the children or descendants of the person indicated, and is morever equivalent to our tribe or clan. Bu, father, an ellipsis for dim, is sometimes prefixed to the name of a man's son, and applied to the father instead of his own, (see notes, p. 156), and sometimes apparently when the pedigree is not well ascertained, or not supposed to be eminent beyond the iiame given, which I conceive to be the case as regards the reigning dynasty of 'Oman, the Al-Bu-Sa'id, the Family of the Father of Sa'id. G. P. B.INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS. Ancient Western geograpliers afford very slight inform ation respecting 'Oman. 1 Ptolemy's account of the Eastern Coast of Arabia contains little more than a list of names, and his map is meagre and distorted. He mentions a Moscha partus in latitude 14 deg. N., one degree and a half to the westward of his Syagros extrema, and an Omanum Emporium in lat. 19 deg. 45 min. These localities are also mentioned by the author of the Periplus, who says: 'Adjoining to Sudgros there is a bay which runs deep into the mainland [of] Omana, 600 stadia in width; after which there are high mountainous rocks, steep to and inhabited by a [wild] lacc that live in caverns and hollows of the cliils. Ihis appeal- ance of the coast continues for 500 stadia more, at the termina tion of which lies a harbour called Moscha, much frequented on account of the Sachalitic 2 incense which is imported there.' 3 According to this statement, Sudgros was at one end of the bay and Moscha, at the other , 1,100 stadia farther north, or rather north-east, the two places being separated by the mainland of Omana. As the Syagros extrema ot I tolemy and the Sudgros of the Periplus undoubtedly represent the 1 The natives usually pronounce the word ' 'Aman,'' and Palgrave says that ' 'Oman ' is ' our customary European misnomer; but he is wrong. Ibn-Batuta, it is true, writes it ' 'Amman;' but the author of the Mardsid-il-'IttilcC, and Arab lexicographers generally, vocalize the name thus: ' 'Oman,' with a dhdmmah over the first letter. 2 Obviously a Greek form of the Arabic literally, belonging to the coast,—a designation still commonly applied by the Arabs to the residents on the east coast of Africa. 3 Vincent's Coriimerce and Navigation of the Ancients, vol. ii. p. •&gt;44. h11 introduction modern Ras-Fartak, it is clear that the Moscha of neither can be Maskat/ which is at least 480 miles to the north of that cape. There is no port answering to Ptolemy's Moscha where he locates it; but the MoscIlcl of the Periplus may stand foi Bunder-Res At, with which Mr. H. J. Carter identifies it.'* Dean \ incent was puzzled at the occurrence of the names Omanum and Omana on that part of the coast. Mr. Carter, also, who describes a remarkable natural division in the bay of el-Kamar 3 the two mountainous tracts there being se parated by forty miles of low land—is not surprised that the noithern district should bear a specific designation, but in asmuch as the territory now called 'Oman lies so much faithci north, he is at a loss to account for the ancient name so low down on the coast. Ihis difficulty disappears when we come to the old Oriental geographers, who make 'Oman conterminous with lladhramaut, just as Ptolemy makes his Syagros Extrema the northern boundary of his Adramittarum regio. So el-'Idrisy'and next to the land of Hadhramaut, on the east, is the land of Shajar, in which are the Mahrah tribes. Next to the land of Mahrah is the country of 'Oman, which adjoins it on the north.' 4 Oman, then, according to this statement, extended as far south as lat. 16 deg. or 17 deg. N. Following the same authority, it was bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean, on the north by the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, and on the west by the province of el-Yamamah, and therefore comprehended the territory of el-Bahrein, on the mainland ; hence its boundary in that direction may be fixed approxi mately at longitude 60 deg. 30 min.

Between Sur and lliis-el-Mdhjamah is a distance of five days by land and two days by sea. Kas-el-Mahjamah is a lofty mountain on the coast, and at Kas -el-M{ihjamah there are pearl- fisheries. From Kalhat by the shore to the town of Sohar is a distance of two hundred miles, and close to it, on the shore, is the village of Damar. And from Maskat to Sohar, which are both flourishing towns, is four hundred and fifty miles. 1 he town of Sohar is on the coast of the Persian sea, and it is the most ancient of the towns of 'Om&amp;n. In olden times the China ships used to sail from thence, but they ceased to do so. The cause of their discontinuing to sail from the town of Oman was this : In the middle of the sea of Persia, which is before Maskat, is an island called the Island of Kish [or Kaish] ; it is a square island, twelve miles wide, and twelve miles long. From Sohar to this island is two days' run. This island is opposite to the land of el-Yemen, separated from it by a day's run; and on the coast of Kerman are et-Taiz and Shatt. Opposite to Sohar, on the mainland, at a distance of two days, are two neighbouring districts, near to which is a Wadi, called AN adi-el- Falh [Falj, (?) the common designation of a stream or aqueduct in Oman]. One is called Sa'al and the other el-'Afr; they are a couple of small but flourishing districts, with palm-trees, cultivation, fruit, and dates. J hey are about equal in size, and they procure water from the stream of el- Falh [el-Falj]; and the country in which they are situated is called Jezwa [Nezwa?]. And at about half a day is the town of Manj [Manh?]; it is a small town, and below it is the mountain called Sharm, with date- trees and springs of water, and it is situated on the banks of the stream of el-Falh [el-Falj]. And from Manj [Manh] to Sirr of 'Oman, west ward, is two days' journey. It is situated at the foot of Jebel-Sharm, where the stream of el-Falh [el-l* alj] takes its rise. It is a huge stream, and on it are villages and continuous dwellings, until it falls into the sea near Julfarah. Most of the inhabitants of 'Oman are Khawtirij [schismatics]. Between Nejd and the country of 'Oman is an extensive desert. From Sohar to the territory of el-Bahrein is a journey of about twenty days. Adjoining the land of 'Oman to the west and towards the north is the land of el-Yamamah, one of the towns of which is llajar, now in ruins.' It seems strange, at first sight, thatel-Tdrisy should give to the main land opposite the island of Kaish, (Kishm,) on the south, the name of 'Yemen;' but several of the old Arabian geographers included the whole of 'Oman within that province. D'Herbelot notices this fact in his Bibliotheca Oriental is, under the heading of ' laman.' Ibn-Batutaiv introduction than any of the old Arabian geographers, but, as the extract will show, his information, especially with regard to the relative position of places in this part of Arabia, is most inaccurate. ^Oman, as a principality, was sometimes co-extensive with the aforesaid limits, sometimes it comprised more and sometimes less territory, the boundaries within their Jurisdic tion depending in a great measure upon the personal character of the native rulers and the success or failure of their policy towards the turbulent outlying tribes. At the present day the principality of ^Oman extends, on the east, from Eas-el- Iladd to Cape Musandim, 1 but a very small portion of the western coast now recognizes its authority. Westward, inland, it may be said to stretch as far as the great Arabian desert. Its sovereign dependencies on the coast of Mekran are Guadel and Sharbar, and it farms the littoral from Ras- Jashk to Bnnder-el-'Abbas—part of the ancient Caramania —together with the islands of Hormftz and el-Kishm, 2 from the Shah of Persia. The islands of Zanzibar, Pemba, and Monfia, with their dependencies on the east coast of Africa, from Cape Delgado to Mukdishu, (Magadoxo), constituted a part of the 'Oman state up to 1861, when they were formed into a separate principality under Majid, a younger son of the late Seyyid Said. But according to local native geography'Oman is merely one of five districts into which the principality is subdivided. styles the sea near and south of the island of el-Bahrein the ' sea of Yemen.' (See Lee's Translation, p. 65.) The name ' el-Bahrein' literally, the Two Seas—probably owes its origin to the notion that two seas, namely, that of Yemen or 'Omftn, and that of Fars or Kerman, met in that locality. The designation is not unlike that of the tSwos Sida\a(r&lt;ros of Acts, xxvii. 41. 1 So spelt in the Arabic of Brucks's chart of the Persian Gulf. 2 El-Tdrisy calls this island ' Kish,' or ' Kaish ;' the author of this History vocalizes it ' el-Kilsum and Palgrave makes it ' Djishm.' The more familiar designation is retained above.and analysis. v A glance at the map will show that a range of mountains traverses the province from south-east to north, nearly parallel to the coast, throwing off in its course northward a branch or arm which extends to Ras-el-Khaimah, on the Persian Gulf. The lowland on the eastern shore is called el- Batinah, or the Inner; the opposite side of the mountain range, between latitude 23 deg. 50 min. and 24 deg. 50 min., goes by the name of ezh-Zhdhirah, or the Outer; es-Sirr 1 is the designation given by the Arabs and Julfdrah by the Persians to the littoral on the west of the promontory, and to its extension, westward, as far as longitude 53 deg., in cluding the ports of the Benu-Yas. The midland district, from about the latitude of Makniyat on the north to Semed on the south, and conterminous with el-Batinah on the east and the desert on the west, is the district of 'Oman proper; and adjoining 'Omun on the south and south-east is Ja'aldn. Sometimes a different nomenclature is adopted, and the territory comprised within the upper districts of ezh-Zha- hirah, es-Sirr, and Riius-el-Jebel —the rocky promontory— is styled esh-Shamdl, or the North; the north-eastern portion of ^Oman proper, including the towns of Nezwa and Behla, esh-Sharldyyah, or the East; and the district of ezh-Zhahii-ah as far as el-Bereimy, and westward even as far as Nejd, el- GharUyyah, or the West. By keeping this terminology in mind the reader will be the better able to comprehend the geographical and other details contained in the following History, from which it has been mainly compiled. It is to be regretted that the same authority affords scarcely any information respecting the original colonization oPOman by the Arabs. The opening part of the work, which at first sight promised to supply special notices on the subject, was found on further examination to consist of elaborate genealogies of the el-Azd tribes of Yemen and their renown in olden time, with a few intimations here and 1 Sometimes es-Sirr is used, laxly, as synonymous with ezh-Zhaliirah; see p. 157.vi introduction there tliat certain families of that stock settled in 'Oman. Strange to say, it makes no direct reference whatever to the immigration of the el-Yaarubah, whose presence in 'Oman at a very early period is attested by concurrent tradition, and who supplied a succession of Imams to the country from a.d . 1624-1741, when they were superseded by the existing dynasty of the Al-Bu-Said. Yaarub, the descendant of Kahtan, (Joktan), is alleged to have reigned over the whole of lemen, including 'Oman, about 754 years before the Christian era. He was succeeded by his son Jashjub, and then by his grandson 'Abd-Shams-Saba, who had two sons, Himyar and Kahlan, whose descendants undoubtedly inter mingled, although those of the former became mostly Hadhr, that is, resident in towns and villages, those of the latter, Bcdu, or dwellers in plains and deserts. It is uncertain whether his brother Kahlan, or his son Wathil, or his grand son Shammir succeeded Himyar, but as Wathil is distinctly stated to have ruled over 'Oman we are justified in assuming the existence of the el-Yaarubah in that country. Shammir, on the other hand, is recorded to have recognized the au thority of the Persians. ^This last indication,' remarks M. Caussin de Perceval, suggests the idea that Shammir lived during the great monarchy of Cyrus, about 536 B.C.'; 1 it also corroborates the local tradition of the early domination of the Persians over 'Oman, from which they were subse quently expelled by the aid of other immigrants from Yemen. These consisted of a number of the tribe of el-Azd, a descendant of Kahlan,—and therefore of the same stock as the el-Yaarubah,—who originally occupied the territory of Mareb, and dispersed over different parts of Arabia at the period of the rupture of the famous dyke there, about a.d. 120. Those under Nasr, the son of el-Azd, went into 'Oman, and 1 Histoire des Arabes avant VIslamisme, etc., vol. i. p. 56. The editor is indebted to the same learned work for several of the preceding and subsequent notices respecting the early history of 'Oman.and analysis. VU wore afterwards known as 'the el-Azd of ^Oraan. Seventy years later, another branch of the family settled in el-Bahrein, on the mainland, under Malik-bin-Fahm, a descendant of el- Azd, who took up his residence at el-Anbar, near el-Hirah, in the , Irak-'Araby,and founded the kingdom of the Tanukhites, on the west of the Euphrates. The original historians con sulted by the eminent French writer just quoted leave it doubtful whether these Azdites emigrated from Batn-Marr, in the territory of Mekkah, where they had formed a settle ment about a.d . 180, 1 or whether they were a detachment of those who had located themselves in 'Oman upwards of half a century before. Be that as it may, our author states that the government of the latter country was held by this Malik- bin-Fahm, el-Azdy, and by his descendants; from which we may infer that ^Oinan was probably comprised, at first, within the dominions of the el-Hirah sovereigns, and became independent subsequently under the resident princes ol the same family. The historian llamza records that M$lik-bin- Fahm was accidently killed by his son Sulaimah, who theie- upon fled into ^Oman, where he left a large progeny, which existed a long time after the rise of Islam. ihis casual notice tends to confirm the inference that there was an in timate relationship between the el-Azd of 'Oman and tho^u of the 'Irak-'Araby. Other so-called Azdite' families appear to have migrated into 'Oman from Nejd, but at what period it is difficult to ascertain. Under the head of 'the el-Azd, the descendants of Khatamah,' our author enumerates several branches of them as being settled in that country. But Khatamah was not, strictly speaking, an Azdite. He was the son ot Anmar, the son of Nizar,' the son of Maadd, the son of Adnan, 1 Ahmed-bin-Yahya, el-Beladzory, mentions this settlement of the el- Azd, and their subsequent migration into 'Oman, in his B'uttih-d-Biddan, p. 16. Edited by Goeje, Lugd., 1866. 2 Hence the relationship between the KhatAmah Azdites and the Nizii- riyyah of 'Oman ; see p. 3, note 1.via 1nt110ducti0n the alleged descendant of'Abir, 1 (the patriarch Eber), through Ishmael; whereas the el-Azd claim descent from'Abir through his son Kahtan, (Joktan). 'Anmar settled in the mountainous district of Yemen, where his sons Khatamah and Bajilah having intermarried with two families descended from Kah- lan, the progenitor of el-Azd, their progeny were regarded as Azdites. They subsequently migrated into Nejd, and are named among the Arab hordes who ravaged the Persian ter ritories during the minority of Sapor II., a.d . 310-330. Sapor landed an army some years after at el-Katif, pursued the Arabs into el-Hajar, and nearly exterminated them. 2 Among the branches of these Azdites whom our author locates in 'Oman are the Safir, Sahban, Batl, 'Arabah, Said, Rashid, Akhzam,Wahib, and Main; also, the Benu-VSamit, Hadiyah, and Ashraf, The names of several of these tribes occur in the following History. Under the title of the ' Dispersion of Tai, the son {i .e. the descendant] of el-Azd/' the author indicates the source of other immigrations into 'Oman. His conceit of the Azdites, however, has led him into a genealogical error, for Tai, though descended from Kahlan, did not belong to the family of el-Azd, but to that of'Odad. Tai, the descendant of 'Odad, begat el-Ghauth, who begat 'Amr, who begat Aswadan, whose name was Nebhan. The Benu-Nebhan, as we shall see hereafter, held the sovereignty over 'Oman for two or three centuries. As the tribe of their progenitor, Tai, left Yemen about a. d . 250, and settled in the north of Nejd, in the mountains of Aja and Salma, 3 it is highly probable that the Benu-Nebhan came into 'Oman from that district. 1 'Abir is generally held by the Arabs to be the same person as Hud, who is mentioned in the Kuran ^rat-el-AaWdf, 63-70) as having been sent to the tribe of 'Aus, the son of Aram, the son of Sem, the son of Noah, to reclaim them from idolatry. 2 Histoire des Arabes, vol. i. pp. 186, 190 ; ii. pp. 48, 49. 1 This fact, recorded by our author, is corroborated by several original authorities quoted in the Histoire des Arabes, vol. i. p. 103.and analysis. IX Among other families of the same stock mentioned by our author as existing in ^Oman is that of Haniy,—sometimes written Hana or Hina,—the brother of Nebhan, 1 His descendants are indiscriminately styled the Benu-Hinah^ el- Hinawiyyah, el-Hinawy, and el-Hinay, (the Hinavi of English writers), and constitute the majority of the Bedu inhabitants of'Oman proper. They have always exercised considerable influence in the country, and in more recent times have come to be regarded as representing one of the two great parties —the other being the el-Ghafiry—into which the population is generally said to be divided. Several of the earlier Imams are recorded to have belonged to the el-Yahmad, but no particulars are given of their pedigi'ee beyond the statement that they were Azdites. As just remarked, the principal rivals of the el-Hinay— and it may be added of the Azdites generally—are the Benu-Grhafir, respecting whose descent our author is abso lutely silent. This may be accounted for on the ground that his avowed object was to write a laudatory history of the el-Azd of 'Oman, and that it was undertaken at the request of a member of the ruling dynasty, which claims to belong to that family. The cognomen ' Ghafir ' afforded me no clue to the parentage of the 'Omany tribes bearing that name, and I am still at a loss to account for its deriva tion ; but the fact that they ai-e also styled Benu-Xasr'' indicated the probability that they form part of the posterity of Nasr-bin-Mo'awiyah—born about a.d . 315—one of the sons of Hawazin, the son of Kais-'Ailau, the son of Modhar, the son of Maadd, the son of 'Adnan, and consequently of Ishmaelitic (?) not of Kahtany origin, as Palgrave makes them. 2 This presumption is confirmed by the intimate rela- 1 M. Caussin de Perceval mentions the Benu-IIaniy and the Benu- Nebhan, the descendants of 'Amr bin Ghauth, as among the most con siderable of the Tai tribes. Hist, des Arabts, vol. ii. p. 606. 2 Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii. p. 256.x introduction tions subsisting between the Benu-Ghafir and the Jow&amp;shira, the latter being generally considered as an offshoot of the former. Now, Mo'awiyah had two sons. Nasi- and Josham, who became the heads of two tribes, called after them the Benu-Nasr and the lienu-Josham. 1 I3oth are frequently mentioned, mostly together, in the early annals of Islam, and they appear to have resided in the territory near Mekkah till about a.d . 590, when we read of them in Nejd. 2 This date corroborates the local tradition of their having come into 'Oman several centuries after the Azdites, by whom they were regarded as interlopers. They settled in es-Sirr and ezh-Zhahirah, two districts still mainly occupied by their descendants, and in the early part of the eighteenth century they had become powerful enough to secure the election of a chief of their tribe, Muhammad-bin-Nasir, to the Imamate. The foregoing is the best account which I have been able to compile respecting the genealogy of the principal tribes of 'Oman and their original immigration into that country. In process of time other tribes followed them—chiefly from Nejd—and these gave birth to numerous branches which have assumed distinctive names, and it is now almost impossible to ascertain the correct parentage of each. Occasional addi tional information on the subject will be found in foot-notes appended to the text of the ensuing History, One fact, however, admits of scarcely any doubt, namelv, that the Yemeny Azdites were the predominant tribe in 1 ' Jowashim would be an equivalent plural, as I conceive it to be the correct form. Some, however, soften it into 'Jow&amp;nim,' whilst others again, and among them our author, following the usage of the Persian Gulf Arabs, write it 'Kawasim.' 2 Hist, des Arabes, vol. i. pp. 307, 309; ii. 537; iii. 245, 258. 3 1 lie ignorance of Arabic and Arab genealogy occasionally manifested by some of our Indian officials is strikingly illustraterl by the following extract from a paper on the 'Joasmees,' published in the Bombay Clovern- ment Selections, No. xxiv. p. 300.—'The Joasmees are a race of Arabs descended from the inhabitants of Nujd, and named Beni Nasir, as being on the left hand side of the Caaba, and called also Beni Ghafree.'aki) analysis. xi 'Oman up to the end of the sixth century/ when Chosroes Parwiz sent a large army into Yemen under Wahraz, who subdued that country, and also annexed el-Mahrah, Ha- dhrarnaut, 'Oman, and el-Bahrein to the Persian dominions. Those provinces, however, did not continue long under a foreign yoke, for about a.d . 630, Muhammad, who by that time had consolidated his power by the subjugation of Temen and Ncjd, dispatched one 'Arm* on an embassy to two brothers, Jaifar and 'Abd, the sons of Julanda, of the el- Azd tribe, who then ruled over 'Oman. He summoned them to embrace Islam, which they appear to have readily adopted, by accepting as divine the mission of Muhammad and aban doning their idolatry. Among the many insurrections which broke out on the accession of Abu-Bekr, Muhammad's successor, was that of Oman, where an Azdite named Dhu-'t- Taj-Lakit, who prior to Islam had sought to supplant prince Julanda, set himself up to be a prophet, and having gained many partisans obliged the Muslims and their chiefs, Jaifar and 'Abd, to take refuge in the mountains. Hadhramaut, el-Mahrah, and el-Bahrein revolting about the same time, Abu-Bekr dispatched several of his generals against them. 'Ikrimah, who had been engaged on similar service in el- Yamamah, having formed a junction with'Arfajah-bin-Hartha- mah, a Himyarite, and Hudhaifah-bin-M uhsin, an Azdite, proceeded towards a locality called Rijam. 3 The Muslim commanders having apprised Jaifar and 'Abd of their presence, the latter left their mountain retreat and, together with their followers, took up a position at bohar, where 'Ikrimah and his colleagues soon joined them. Dzu'-t-laj- Lakit, on the other hand, massed his adherents at Daba, 0 1 El-Beladzory, speaking of a period not long anterior to Islam, says: ' The el-Azd were the principal inhabitants of Om&amp;n, but there was a large population besides them.'

For the position of the place see note 1, p. -4.xii introduction then the pi'incipal town and market of the province. Abu- Bekr's g-enerals having succeeded in detaching several of the el-Azd tribes in and around Sohar and Daba from the pre tender, they started for the latter place and attacked the enemy. During the engagement, which was carried on with equal bravery on both sides, the Muslims were un expectedly reinforced by a large body of the Benu-'Abdu-M- Kais from el-Bahrein, and by the Azdite tribe, the Benu- Najiah. Ten thousand rebels perished on the field, and the town of Daba, together with its inhabitants and accumu lated wealth, became the prey of the conquerors. The fifth part of the booty and the same quota of the prisoners being the legal share of the Khalifah, 'Arfajah set out for Mekkah with eight hundred captives,—men, women, and children,— while Hudhaifah remained behind to extinguish all traces of the rebellion throughout 'Oman. 1 A passage in the Futuh-el-Bulddn* records that in a.h. 15 =a.d . 636,'Omar, Abu-Bekr's successor, appointed'Othman- bin-Abi-'l-'Asy governor over el-Bahrein and 'Oman, from whence the latter dispatched an expedition against Sind. It may fairly be assumed, therefore, that ^Oman was subject to the Arabian Khalifate at that date, which further brings down the history of the country to within a few years of the period at which our author takes it up, namely, during the reign of the Khalifah Mo'awiyah, ( a.h . 41-60 = a.d . 6(31-680), the first of the Omeyyah dynasty; nevertheless, he expressly states at the outset that the authority of the Khalifahs was merely nominal over 'Oman until the accession of ^Abdu-T- Malik-bin-Marwan, a.h . 65 = a.d . 684, when el-Hajjaj, the famous governor of el-'Irak, determined to reduce it. The first attempts made by his generals were bravely resisted by 1 See el-Beladzory's Futdh-el-Bulddn, p. 76.

Xlll the 'Oinanis, headed by their chiefs, the two brothers Suleiman and Said, lineal descendants of the Azdite Julanda already mentioned, who repeatedly drove back the invaders. A subsequent expedition, consisting of a sea and land force of 40,000 men led by Mujjaah, one of el-Hajjaj's most experienced commanders, met with a similar fate, but, re turning a second time with 5,000 cavalry, Mujjaah took possession of the country and treated it as a vanquished province. Thereupon el-Hajjaj placed it under a governor of his own selection, with subordinates to collect the revenue, responsible indirectly to the superior authority of the Khali- fate. Suleiman and Said escaped the vengeance of the conquerors and emigrated to the ' landot the Zanj, taking their families and a number of their tribe with them. 1 As a rule the appointments to 5 Oman were vested in the lieutenant over el-'Irak, subject to the approval of tlio Khalifah. In course of time, natives were promoted to collectorships, and eventually the office ol Wdli, or Governoi, was conferred on Janah-bin- ; Abbadah, ot the el-Hmay tribe. Taking advantage of this concession the people proceeded, about a.d. 751, to elect a sovereign of their own in the person of Julanda-bin-Mas'ud, who is styled the ' first of the right ful Imams of'Oman.' 2 Their previous rulers do not appear 1 This, as far as I know, is the most reliable record which we possess of the first emigration of the 'Omany Arabs to the east coast of Africa. It serves also to elucidate and correct Dr. Krapf's account of the first set tlements of these Arabs in that quarter, which, he says, 'were made in various points of the East African coast in the year 740 by the Emosaids, or adherents of Said, a grandson of Ali, the Prophet s cousin and son-in- law. Said, proclaimed caliph by the rebels, was defeated and slain, on which his adherents had to seek safety in flight; and it was in East Africa that they found refuge.' Travels and Missionary Labours, p. 522. Eor ' Said, the grandson of Ali,' a mythical personage, read ' Sa'id, the descendant of Julanda.' Emosaids I take to stand for Wmmu- So'ld; the People of Sa'id. 2 For the full import of this title see Appendix A.XIV INTUODUCTION to have borne any distinctive title. 1 Religious influence seems to have stimulated this effort to throw off a foreign yoke, for the record of it is coupled with the remark that the IhddhiyaJr had become the predominant sect in ^Oman. 1 he same motives probably led them to change or to confer a fresh title upon their sovereigns. The Khalifah, or Successor to Muhammad, is, par excellence, the Imam or Pontiff of all Muslims; but it is a cardinal doctrine of the Ibadhiyah to deny that ^Aly or his successors were legitimate repre sentatives of the Prophet. In fact, they do not believe in the theological dogma of Succession, or spiritual descent, holding, on the contrary, that the Imam should be the elect of the people, who are justified in deposing him, if adjudged guilty of malfeasance either in secular or religious matters. Jul an da's reign was cut short by an abortive expedition dispatched against 'Oman by the Khalifah es-Saffah, a.d. /49-/54; but in the contest which took place between the two armies -Julanda was slain. Thereupon followed an interregnum of several years, during which the country was a 1 I am not quite certain on this point. From a sentence in page 2, ■where Suleiman and Sa'id, the sons of 'Abbad-bin-el-JuMnda, are styled 'of the lineage of its [Oman's] Sultans,' it may be inferred that 'Sultan' was the designation previously borne by the rulers of that country. On the other hand, the term bears the common signification of ruler, or lord, and may be taken in that sense in this passage. Abulfeda uses it for the first time, in its restricted meaning, in his account of Rukn-ed-Daulah, the Khalifah el-Muti'-b'Illah's nominal deputy over Fars, who, he says, bestowed upon his nephew 'Imad-ed-Daulah, the title of ' Sultau,' placing him at the same time— a h . 338= a,d. 919 upon his throne. But according to the generality of oriental authors the title was not directly applied to any Eastern prince till a.h , 393= a,d . 1002, when Mahmud-el-Ghazny dignified Khalf-bin-Ahmed, the governor of Sejistan, with it. It soon superseded the designation of Amir, or el-Amir,which had before been used in the same sense, was subsequently assumed by the Mamluks in Egypt, and is still used by the Ottoman emperor. See D'Herbelot, under Solthan. I may add that this title is also given to many petty chiefs in Yemen, who in other parts of Arabia would be styled Sheikhs. 2 For a detailed account of this sect see Appendix B,and analysis. xv prey to 'Tyrants'—local chiefs who perpetrated all kinds of excesses. Then 'the learned elders of the people assembled at Nezwa, 1 under the presidency of Musa-bin-Abi-Jabir, and they agreed to confer the Imamate upon Muharamad- bin-'Affiin,' (p. 10). This is the first intimation given of the mode in which the election was conducted, and the great influence of the presiding member in such cases is illustrated by the instance referred to, for he succeeded by his own personal machinations in setting aside the choice of the nobles and conferring the dignity on another individual, namely, el-Warith-bin-Kaab. During el-Warith's tenure of office another ineffectual attempt was made by the Khalifah Harun-er-Eashid, a.d . 789-809, to reconquer 'Oman. Ghassan, Warith's successor, was distinguished for having put an end to the incursions of a formidable band of pirates who infested those seas in vessels called Bawdrij, coming from the mouths of the Indus (note, p. 12). 'Abdu-'l-Mulik, who succeeded him, becoming too infirm to carry on the administration, a mutiny arose among the soldiery, which led to the appointment of a regent. The annals of the next reign, that of el-Muhenna, a.d . 840-851, represent el-Mahrah as being tributary to 'Oman, for the people of that province were adjudged to bring their camels once a-year and walk them round a pillar which the Imam caused to be erected at Nezwa for that purpose. The object of this ordinance was two-fold: first, as a public recognition of their dependence on the part of the owners; and, secondly, 1 Nezwa appears to have been the capital, at this period, of the territory wliich recognized the authority of the Imam ; neverthe less, several of the succeeding Imams kept to their native towns. In course of time er- Rastak became the seat of the sovereigns, and remained so until the regency of Ilamed-bin-Sa'id, about a.d . 1779, who removed to Mdskat, which has been the principal residence of the ruling Seyyids ever since. For an account of Nezwa, see Wellsted's Travels in Arabia, vol. i. pp. 119-126. lie describes the fort there as being, ' in the estimation of all the surrounding country,' impregnable. I his is probably the fort mentioned at p. 88, as having been built by Sultan-bin-Seif, at a cost of ' lacs of gold and silver.'xvi introduction in order that the amount of cattle-tithe due from them to the Imam might be correctly estimated. 1 On the death of el-Muhenna, who had vigorously repressed a rising of the Benu-Julanda,—the tribe of the old rulers,— revolt became rife, and numerous parties were formed, all aiming at the sovereign power. No less than sixteen boot less councils were convened to put an end to the growing disorders. During this state of anarchy some of the mal contents applied for assistance to el-Muatadhid-b'Illah, the Abbaside Khalifah at Baghdad— a . d . 892-902—by whose orders Muhammad-bin-Nur, his governor over el-Bahrein, invaded 'Oman by land with a force of twenty-five thousand men, including one thousand cavalry, half of whom were clad in coats of mail, levied principally from the en-Nizar and the Benu-Tai. So great was the consternation created by the impending attack, that many families left 'Oman for Hormuz, el-Basrah, and Shiraz. After capturing el-Bereimy and the district of es-Sirr, Muhammad-bin-Nur inarched to Nezwa, which 'Azzan, the ruling Imam, had evacuated, but pursuing him to S^med-esh-Shan, a battle was fought there in which ^Azzan was slain, and the conqueror sent his head as a trophy to the Khalifah. 1 El-Mahrah had ceased to recognize the suzerainty of 'Om&amp;n for centuries, when the late Seyyid Sa'id, by a stretch of authority for which lie was too glad to secure our countenance, made over the Curia-Muria islands, on the coast of that province, then tributary to the sheikhs of the Benu-Khalfan, at Marbat, to the British crown. The deed of con veyance was as follows; 'In the name of Almighty God! From the humble Sa'id-bin-Sultan to all whom it may concern, Muslims and others. Captain Freemantle having come to me from the great Queen, asking from me the Islands of Khalfan, [namely.] el-Hallaniyyah, es- Saudah, el-IIasekiyyah, el-Kubliyyah, and Jaruduah, I hereby give to her imperial Majesty the Sovereign of England, her Majesty Queen Victoria, the said islands, and to her children after her. I give them absolutely, on my own behalf, and on behalf of my children after me, of my own free will, and without any drawback on my part. Be this known to all who may peruse this document.

XVU Muhammad-bin-Nilr took up liis residence at Nezwa, but it was not long before one of the chiefs of the el-Hinay summoned the tribes to expel him the country. They had nearly effected their object^ having driven him as far as the sea-coast at es-Sib, when a strong mounted reinforcement, two men riding on each camel, coming to the aid of the refugees, a battle was fought in which the ^Omanis were defeated with great loss. Thereupon Muhammad-bin-Nur re-occupied Nezwa, and ruled with a rod of iron: ' he cut off the hands and ears, and scooped out the eyes of the nobles, inflicted unheard-of outrages upon the inhabitants, destroyed the watercourses, burnt the books, and utterly desolated the country.' On leaving for el-Bahrein he ap pointed one el-Bujairah as his deputy over ^Oman, who shortly after fell a victim to the vengeance of the infuriated people. No less than seven Imams were successively elected and deposed within a space of about thirty years after this occurrence. The narrative leads to the inference that the 'Omanis took advantage of the serious disturbances raised by the el-Karamitah 1 at this period throughout the Muslim empire to re-assert their independence; but their efforts were too feeble to prevent the ' Sultan of Baghdad' 2 from 1 For a brief notice of this sect see note, p. 27 ; also Appendix B, pp. 587-390. 2 In two foot-notes, pp. 26, 33, I have supposed that the Khalifah was indicated by this title. It is quite true, as there remarked, that the religious scruples of the Ibadhiyah author frequently restrain him from giving the designation of Khalifah to the orthodox Muslim sovereigns ; nevertheless, subsequent reflection leads me to think that by the ' Sultan of Baghdad' the Amir-el-OmarS, is intended. The date of the narrative in which it occurs, namely, subsequent to the death of el-Mua'tddhid, a.h . 289= a.d . 902, confirms that idea, for the latter title was first given to Abu-Bekr-ibn-er-Kaik by the Khalifah er-R&amp;dhi-b'Illah, a.h . 324 =a.d . 935. Besides the entire management of the finances, the office comprised the administration of all military affairs, and the Amir-el- Omara frequently headed the army in person. In course of time the influence of these Commanders-in-Chief became paramount in the dXVill introduction visiting the country ever and anon, presumably 'witli a strong force, to levy the tribute. On these occasions the Imam resigned his authority, and did not resume it until the departure of the Collectors. The el-Karamitah do not appear to have succeeded in subjugating ^Oman, for according to Nowairy a detachment of six hundred men, dispatched on an expedition into that country by Abu-Said, the leader of the el-Bahrein branch of the sect, was cut off to a man. Subsequently, the 'Sultan of Baghdad' again invaded 'Oman, and held it with two military camps, one in the province of es-Sirr and the other at el-'Atik. 1 Nevertheless, the people continued to have Imams of their own, and in the case of Rashid-bin-el-Walid (p. 31) we have an in teresting account of his election and inauguration. Four of the principal chiefs met together in the house of the candidate, who was required to assent to certain conditions submitted to him. That assent given, the chiefs went forth to the people, who had assembled from all parts of 'Oman to take part in the ceremony, and made known to them the result of their deliberations. The president of the council then stood up and solemnly proclaimed him Imam. After empire, and the Khalifahs were reduced to mere puppets in their hands. See D'llerbelot's Bihliotheque Orientale under Emir and Radhi Billah. 1 El-'Atik occurs in et-T^bary's account of the ' Day of Armath' as the name of a river, lleiskius, in his Annotations on Abulfeda, vol. i. p. 47, quotes the following from el-Mas'udy respecting its locality:— ' The water of the Euphrates used to extend to the territory of el- Hirah, and its canal exists up to this time, and is called el-'Atik. Thereon took place the conflict between the Muslims and Rustam, namely, the battle of el-Kadisiyyah, It empties into the Abyssinian sea. At that time the sea was in the place called en-Najaf.

The reign of Rflshid-bin-el-Walid, which began so aus piciously, ended in disaster. Intrigue and insubordination broke out among his subjects, who once more invited the Khalifah to intervene in their intestine quarrels. Nezwa was again occupied by his army, and an imprudent attack upon them led to the overthrow of the Imam Rashid and his adhe rents. Rashid eventually made his submission to the Khali- fah's representatives in the country, who held it until the increasing commotions in the Muslim empire, which had led to its rapid disintegration, prevented the Abbaside sove reigns from dispatching reinforcements into 'Oman. This took place about a.d . 1000, after which we read of no further interference of the Khali fahs in the affairs of 1 hat province. 1 For upwards of a century afterwards the ^Omanis reverted to their old system of government, and five successive Imams, who appear to have resided principally at Nezwa, were elected. An interregnum of 260 years followed, during which the Benu-Nebhan tribe acquired the ascendancy, and established a dynasty of Mdliks, or Kings, 2 who ruled over 1 For half a century at least prior to that date the Arabian Khalifate had been shorn of its authority and dignity by the numerous Amirs who had set up independent rule over almost all the provinces of the empire, (see note, p. 34). At the outset, these princes paid some sort of homage to the reigning Khalifah, but in course of time they came to regard him only as the great Imam or Sovereign Pontiff of Islam, who had nothing more to do than to lead in the services of the Mosque and to decide certain points of right. It is true that once and again the Khalifahs re-asserted their independence of the Amirs, nevertheless their power began to decline perceptibly from the reign of er-Radhi-b'Illah, a.h . 325 = a.d . 936, until Baghdad was captured and the Khalifate abolished by the Moghuls under Iluliiku-Khan, a.d . 1258, after it had been held by the el-'Abbas dynasty for about 523 years. 2 From a remark by the author at p. 52 it would seem that some ofI 1 I xx introduction a groat part of the interior until the reestablishment of the Iraamatej a.d . 1429, and continued to exercise considerable influence in the country up to the accession of the Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid, a.d . 1664. Prior to the sway of the Benu-Nebhan the Imams were chosen from different families of the el-Azd stock; only one instance is recorded of lineal succession (p. 51), although such succession appears to have been the rule in the case of the sovereigns of the Julanda dynasty. The change which subsequently took place in that respect was probably coeval with the prevalence of the Ibadhiyah doctrines, which in culcated that the Imam should be the elect of the people. During the government of the Benu-Nebhan, a.d . 1154 — 1406, ^Oman was twice invaded from Persia, once by the u people of Shiraz ,'a.d. 1265, and again a few years later by the Amir Mahmud-bin-Ahmed, el-Kusy, from Hormuz, on the mainland of Kerman, the seat of a petty principality, of Arab origin, which for the time being was subverted by the Moghuls, but was subsequently reestablished on the island of Jerun, 1 or Zarun, since called Hormuz. The date of these invasions, taken in conjunction with a passage from Marco Polo's travels about the same time, (note, p. 3 7),renders it tolerably certain that they occurred on the accession of Abaka, the son of Hulaku-Khan; 2 and although the invaders were repelled on the later occasion, nevertheless, as we shall see presently, the ' Kings of HormAz' continued to claim jurisdiction over the seaboard of 'Oman up to the beginning of the sixteenth centurj'-. The few detached notices given by the author of the rule of the Benu-Nebhan are of little interest. Their sovereigns appear to have resided either at Makniyat or Behla, and one these Maliks attained the dignity of Imam ; but the passage is of doubt ful import. 1 Abulfeda in his Takwim-el-Bulddn writes it ' Zarun.' 2 Ibn-Wardy says that Hulaku-KhtLn died on the 19th of Rabia'-el- Akhir, a.h . 663 = 8th February, 1265. INand analysis, xxi of tliem is recorded to have introduced the mango-tree into the country, which still continues to flourish there. Frequent feuds broke out between them and their kinsmen the el- Hinay, and their tyranny eventually led the people to restore the Imamate in the el-Azd family. This took place about a.d . 1435, at which period the Benu-Nebhan had suffered some severe reverses, and much of their property was con fiscated (p. 49); but their power was not altogether broken, since two members of their tribe and one of the el-Hinay became Imams subsequently, (p. 52). It was not till a.d . 1624, when Nasir-bin'Murshid,the first of the el-Yaarubah dynasty, was elected at er-Eastak, which thenceforward became the inland capital, that their influence was finally suppressed. 1 The el-Yaarubah, as already stated, were the first settlers in 'Oman from Yemen. Like the el-Azd, they were of Kahtany origin, but belonged to an older bi'anch of that stock. Nasir-bin-Murshid's pedigree (p. 53) makes him first a Ya'aruhy, then an 'Arahy, or pure Arab (see note, id?), then a Himyary, and an Azdy. Strictly speaking, he could not have been both, because Himyar and el-Azd were brothers, who each became the head of numerous families, bearing the distinctive name of their progenitor; but as these families subsequently intermingled, and it was not certain, perhaps, from which Nasir lineally descended, the double parentage is ascribed to him. Lastly, he is called a Yemeny, which describes the local origin of his race. The phrase, 'the upright Ibadhy,' appended to his pedigree, indicates the particular creed which he professed, just as a member of one of the four orthodox Muslim sects would be styled either a Hdnafy, a Sbafay, a Maliky, or a Hanbaly. 2 1 From that time forward even the name Benu-Nebhan ceases to occur in the annals of 'Oman. I can only account for this fact by the suppo sition that after a long period of rivalry they eventually coalesced with their relatives, the el-Hinay, under which designation the amalgamated tribes still exercise considerable influence in the country. 2 English readers unaccustomed to the oriental style should be ap-xx11 introduction At the period of NAsir-bin-Murshid's election some of the inland towns and forts were in the hands of independent chiefs, styled Maliks/^ (p. 64) j others were possessed by the inhabitants in common, who appear to have formed petty municipal or village republics. Er-Eastak and Nakhl were held by the relatives of Nasir; Tawwam or el-Bereimy, and one town in ezh-Zhahirah, by the Hilalis, proving that the Maaddic tribes (see note, p. 58) had already gained a strong footing in that part of'Oman; Behla, which had been a mili- taiy post under the Khalifahs, and one of the capitals of the Benu-Nebhan, was in the hands of the Benu-Hinay. Lawa, (note, p. 02), seems to have been the only port on the eastern coast subject to the 'Omanis, the remainder being still held by the Portuguese, Albuquerque having seized them, a.d . 1508, at which time they were undoubtedly tributary to the Malik of Hormuz. 1 Julfar, on the western coast of the promontory, was occupied by 'Persians' from Hormuz, prised that the author, when describing a person of rank, first gives his name and family descent, then his gentilic extraction, mentioning the sub-tribe before the parent stock, and lastly the place of his birth. ^Ihus in the case of 'Omar, (p. 48), his progenitors are enumerated through five generations ; then he is called ' el-Yahmady,' i. e. of the sub-tribe of el-Yahmad; then ' el-Azdy,' of the el-Azd stock; and then ' el- Kharusy, Kharus being his native place. It is only in special cases, however, that all these particulars are supplied ; the more common prac tice is to give a man's name, as the son of so-and-so, his gentilic de scent, and his birthplace. The two Imams mentioned at p. 25 are in stances of this abbreviated style. This appears to be clear from the narrative of Faria y Sousa, accord ing to which Alfonso de Albuquerque after leaving Socotra went to Kalhat, 'a beautiful and strong place in the kingdom of Ormuz,' where he was well received, and entered into a treaty of peace with the governor. At Karyat, ten miles farther north, being ill received, he stormed the place. The governor of Mdskat made a treaty of peace with him, but while his boats were ashore for water, ' two thousand men who had arrived to defend the town from Ormuz' opened fire upon him, which led him to capture the place. And at Sohar the inhabitants engaged to pay him ' the same tribute which used to be given to the King of Ormuz.' See Kerr's Voyages and Travels, vol. vi. pp. 102-3.and analysis. XX111 and also by tlie Portuguese, eacli liaving a separate fort and garrison there. Nasir's energy and perseverance, backed by his own tribe and seconded by the people generally, who were anxious to rid themselves of the tyranny of their petty Maliks, soon placed him in possession of all the inland towns and posts. He met with some opposition at eVAkr, of Nezwa, from the Benu-Abi-Said 1 and also from the Benu-Hinay; but his more formidable antagonists were the Benu-Hilal, of ezh- Zhahirah, headed by one Nasir-bin-Katan, whose head quarters were at el-Hasa, (see note 1, p. 70,) and who en tered into an alliance against the Imam with the Benu- Hinay. Nasir^s successes indirectly brought him into antagonism with the Portuguese, who very naturally regarded his grow ing popularity with disfavour, if not with alarm. They held the defences at the principal stations on the coast with strong garrisons, 2 but the lesser ports were left in the hands of the inhabitants, subject to an annual tribute. Be yond a general supervision they appear to have allowed the native local authorities to administer their own laws, and, strange to say, we read of no efforts on the part of the Por tuguese clergy to make proselytes to Christianity in these parts. Their policy was undoubtedly most conciliatory, but surrounded as they were by inimical tribes they were obliged to have recourse to a precarious and hazardous strategy. Divide et Imp era was the course which their isolated position almost forced upon them, and, while they had only petty rival chiefs to deal with, their influence sufficed to maintain the balance of power in their own favour. But a more for midable competitor now appeared on the scene, and as against him their ordinary tactics precipitated their com plete overthi'ow. 1 Probably the same tribe as that of the existing dynasty, the Al-Bu- Sa'id, which succeeded the el-Ya'arubah, 2 At Sur, Karyat, Maskat, el-Matrah, and Sohar on the eastern coast.XXIV INTRODUCTION The immediate cause of dissension between the two par ties arose out of certain occurrences at Lawa, a small town near the coast, about fifteen miles north of Sohar. On Nasir's accession the fort there was held by a friendly ally, who was subsequently murdered, and the place fell into the hands of two brothers of the el-Hilaly tribe, 1 one of whom joined a number of other malcontent chiefs who had souo-ht O refuge with the Portuguese at Sohar. The latter readily espoused their cause and abetted them in their opposition to the Imam, supplying them with arms and ammunition to carry on hostilities against him. Despite this cooperation, however, the rebels were obliged to surrender Lawa, and emboldened by success the Imfim Nasir forthwith dispatched a large army to attack the Christians at Maskat and el- Matrah. The conflict which ensued resulted in the cession to the ''Omanis of several outposts at the former place, as also all the buildings and land which the Portuguese held at Sohar, with the exception of the castle j and, further, they agreed to pay tribute to the Imam for their continued occupation of Maskat. N.isir-bin-Murshid's next expedition was directed against Julfar, the modern Ras-el-Khaimah, on the western coast, then held jointly by the 'Persians' of Hormuz and the Portuguese. After capturing that place he ordered a fort to be built on the seashore near Sohar, in order to keep a check upon the manoeuvres of the Portuguese and the dis affected native chiefs who were harboured there. An abor tive attack was made at the same time on the Sohar castle, 2 1 Owing evidently to mistranscription, there is great confusion in the names of the principal persons concerned in these occurrences at I^awa, as given at pp. 63, 64. Muhammad-bin-Jufair, in the thirteenth line of the former page, is called ' el-Jabry,' whereas being brother to Seif- bin-Muhammad, el-IIilaly, he also must have belonged to the same tribe. Again, in the fifth line of p. 64, the same Seif-bin-Muhanunad is desig nated u el-Ilin&amp;y,' instead of u el-IIilaly.' These inaccuracies escaped my notice at the time. Ihe castle of Soh&amp;r occupies a small rising ground within the city;and analysis. xxv which was bravely defended by the Christians, who, how ever, were unable to prevent the prosecution of the new fort, which was completed under the protection of a strong guard. The Portuguese at Maskat having refused to pay the stipulated tribute, the Imam dispatched an army against them to enforce it. At el-Matrah his commander-in-chief was waited upon by a deputation from the Christians soliciting peace, and eventually an agreement was entered into whereby the latter engaged to pay the tribute regularly in future; to surrender certain military posts at el-Mdtrah ; to permit all those who repaired to the coast to trade freely ; to abstain from hostilities against the Imam ; and to make over to him all the external fortifications of Maskat. These concessions, however, did not prevent the Imam from attacking the Christians at Sur and Karyat, from both which places he succeeded in expelling them. The close of Nasir-bin-Murshid's career was disturbed by fresh troubles in ezh-Zhahirah, instigated and fostered by Nasir-bin-Katan, el-Hilaly, who, foiled in his attempt against el-Bereimy, marched with an army towards tne south. He was met at all points by the Imam, who succeeded in put ting down the rebellion, and at his death, which occurred a.d . 1649, he was master of the whole province, with thu exception of the towers and fortifications of el-Matrah and Maskat, and the castle of Sohar. The fiction recorded by his annalist as ' a well-known fact,^ that ' not an individual, great or small,' died a natural death during his reign of twenty-six years, was unnecessary to establish his renown as one of the most famous rulers of 'Oman, for he consoli- its entrance is by a bridge, passing over a moat, and leading to a largo inner gate; on the walls of the keep are placed a few small pieces of artillery, culverines in antiquated phrase, and full-grown cannon stand ranged before the entrance...

He was frugal even to parsimony in his mode of life, and bis reputation for piety was, there can be no doubt, the main source of his popularity with the superstitious tribes who still regard him as having been endowed with preternatural virtues. Nasir was succeeded by his cousin. Sultan-bin-Seif, who immediately after his election set out from er-Rastak with a large army, determined to drive the Portuguese out of Maskat. He encamped near the neighbouring town of el- Matrah, from whence he made frequent sallies on the enemy's outposts; but the Christians were everywhere on the alert and repulsed the assailants at all points. This desultory warfare might have been prolonged indefinitely had it not been for the treachery of a Banian, named Narutem, who appears to have held the post of general agent to the Por tuguese, and whose daughter the Commandant, Pareira, in sisted on making his wife. Narutem, having succeeded in postponing the proposed marriage for a year, hit upon a plan for frustrating it altogether. He first induced the Commandant to empty the water-tanks in the two forts, clear out the provision-stores and remove the gunpowder, under the plea that the siege might be protracted, and that, therefore, timely precautions should be taken to obtain fresh supplies in lieu of the old, and then wrote confidentially to the Imam apprising him of what he had done, urging him to attack the place on a Sunday, when the garrison would be off duty and engaged in merry-making. Taking advan tage of this information, the Imam led his army over the intervening heights on the day named, and first assaulted the town walls, ' none of the Portuguese opposing them but such as were reeling drunk, incapable of firing or using their muskets, beyond striking with them at random.' From the town they proceeded to the two forts, the guns ofand analysis. XXVll which were useless, Narfltera having tampered with the ammunition, and after a hand-to-hand struggle both were captured. A ' famous warrior named Cabreta' made a desperate effort to turn the fortune of the day by rushing into the town with a small band of followers, but he was overpowered by numbers, who pelted him with rotten eggs, and dispatched him with spears. Thus, writes the pious annalist, did ' God rid the Muslims of him and his poly theist companions.' The date of the capture of Maskat from the Portuguese has never been correctly ascertained; unfortunately, our author also omits to record it. Judging from the chronology of other events which transpired during the reign of Sultan- bin-Seif, (see note, p. 89), I have fixed it between 1G51-2. Two Portuguese men-of-war continuing to hover about the coast near Maskat, a body of mercenaries was obtained f 'to whom death was sweeter than wine to the lips of the wine- bibber,' who attacked them in small boats and destroyed them, killinor the crews. Fired with these successes in o 'Oman, the Imam organized a Jihad, and carried the war into the enemy^s country. He attacked Diu and Darmin, on the coast of Guzerat, to the great consternation of the Por tuguese, carrying away an immense booty, including all the gold and silver vessels and images belonging to the churches. Relieved from all fear of invasion from abroad, he turned his attention to home affairs, and it is specially recorded of him that he fostered trade and sent agents into different coun tries to obtain a supply of arms, horses, etc., for which a strong demand had sprung up among his subjects. He spent twelve years and 'lacs of gold and silver' in building the famous fortress at Nezwa, and died, deplored by the people, on the 11th of November, 1668, according to my correction of the obviously erroneous date given by the author or the transcriber. He was buried, like his prede cessor, at Nezwa.XXVIU INTRODUCTION Sultan was succeeded by Lis son Belarab-bin-Sultan, wlio is stated to have been a great patron of learning, having founded and endowed a college at Yabrin, where also he took up his residence. His reign, which opened auspi ciously, was soon disturbed by the rivalry of his brother Seif, who secured many adherents from among the more devout Fakihs and Sheikhs of 'Oman,—the parti-prdtre, as such would be called in Christian France,—and a succes sion of hostilities ensued between the partisans of the two brothers, which obtained for Belarab the sobriquet of the ' Butcher,' and for Seif that of the ' Scourge of the Arabs.' It does not appear which was the elder, nor upon what ground there was a division of opinion among the people as to which of them had a greater claim to the Imamate. Belarab, however, was eventually driven to take refuge in his fort at Yabrin, where he expired—at his own request, as the author avers. On his death, Seif succeeded to the sovereignty, and inaugurated his reign by expelling the Portuguese, about a.d . 1698, from Mombasah, the island of Pemba, Kilwah, and other places on the east coast of Africa, where the Arabs of 'Oman had formed set tlements as early as the seventh century, (see ante, p. xiii). Seif had a large navy at his command ; one of the ships is stated to have carried eighty large guns, ' each gun measuring three spans at the breech/'—in circumference, it may be presumed. His more useful and reproductive works were the repairing of several of the principal canals, 1 1 These canals or water-courses, called Faluj, (in the singular, Falj,) exist in every direction throughout the interior. Describing them, AVell- sted says that the oases and towns of 'Oman generally 'owe their fertility to the happy manner in which the inhabitants have availed themselves of conducting water to them, a mode, as far as I know, peculiar to this country, and at an expense of labour and skill more Chinese than Arabian. The greater part of the surface of the land being destitute of running streams on the surface, the Arabs have sought in elevated places for springs or fountains beneath it; by what means they discover theseand analysis. xxix and the planting of some thousands of date and cocoa-nut trees in different parts of the country. He died at er- Ilastak on the 4th of October, 1711. Sultan-bin-Seif, the second of that name, succeeded his father, and removed from er-Rastak to el-Hazm, where he built a strong fort. His warlike achievements appear to have been confined to the Persian Gulf, where he encoun tered the Persians at many points, and wrested from them the island of el-Bahrein, 1 (p. 94), which they had occu- I know not, but it seems confined to a peculiar class of men who go about the country for the purpose, and I saw several which had been sunk to the depth of forty feet. A channel from this fountain-head is then, with a very slight descent, bored in the direction in which it is to be conveyed, leaving apertures at regular distances to afford light and air to those who are occasionally sent to keep it clean. In this manner the water is frequently conducted for a distance of six or eight miles, and an unlimited supply is thus obtained. These channels are about four feet broad and two feet deep, and contain a clear rapid stream. Few of the large towns or oases but had four or five of these rivulets or feleji running into them. The isolated spots to which water is thus conveyed possess a soil so fertile, that nearly every grain, fruit, or vege table, common to India, Arabia, or Persia, is produced almost spon taneously ; and the tales of the oases will be no longer regarded as an exaggeration, since a single step conveys the traveller from the glare and sand of the desert into a fertile tract, watered by a hundred rills, teeming with the most luxuriant vegetation.' Travels in Arabia, vol. i. pp. 92-94. These canals, which Wellsted thought peculiar to 'Oman are common in Persia, where they are called kariz or kahriz. Mr. Perkins thus describes the process of making them :— u A well is sunk upon a descending plain till water is found, and a canal cut from the bottom, under ground, descending just enough to convey its water along. A few yards from the first a second well is dug, that the earth, in cut ting the subterranean passage, maybe drawn out; and the same process is repeated till the spring is conveyed to the surface and made to irrigate tlie adjacent fields. The rapidity with which these wells are dug is astonishing. Two men—one at the top with a small hand windlass and a leather bucket to draw up the soil, and the other below with an iron prong like a tusk, furnished with a short handle to dig it up, and a huge iron spoon with which to fill the bucket—will work down twenty or twenty-five feet per day.' Residence in Persia, p. 426. Andover, U. S , 1843. 1 Although the author simply states that he captured ' el-Bahrein,'xxx introduction pied on the expulsion of the Portuguese and the garrison of their tributary the ' King' of Hormilz from the latter island by Shah-'Abbas, a.d, 1622^ aided by a fleet belonging to the East India Company. On the demise of Sultan, after a short reign of seven years, great dissensions arose among the inhabitants about a successor. The 'illiterate/^ or popular party, were for electiug his son Seif, then a boy; the 'intelligent and pious' supported Seif's elder brother, Muhenna, on the ground that ' the Imamate of a child was not proper in any way : such an Imam could not lead in prayer, how then could he preside over a state, conduct the administration, have at his disposal the wealth, and blood, and revenues of the country? Neither would it be lawful for him to be placed in charge of the wealth of God, or the property of orphans and absentees ; for, possessing no power over himself, how could he exercise authority over others?' (p. 99). The sheikh 'Adiy-bin-Suleiman, however, who appears to have been the most influential personage at the time, fearing a revolt if he ran counter to the wishes of the majority, appeased the threatening multitude by a verbal equivocation. He proclaimed Seif-bin-Sultan to be their Amdrn, a word from the same root as Imam, but with a different signification, (see note 1, p. 8). Shortly after, Muhenna the elder brother was introduced into the fort by stealth, when the Imamate was conferred upon him by the chiefs, a.d. 1718. Muhenna began his administration by abolishing the custom dues at Maskat and other drawbacks upon trade; and the country was in a highly prosperous condition. His reign was cut short by a joint conspiracy of his own tribe, the el-Yaarubah, and the citizens of er-Rastak, who invited Yaarub-bin-JBelarab-bin-Sultan, his second cousin, to sup- it is clear from a subsequent part of the narrative that the island now called by that name, and not the district on the mainland opposite, which aforetime had borne the same desdgnation, is indicated.and analysis. xxxi plant him. Yaarub succeeded in obtaining possession of M&amp;skat, which had now become one of the most important places in the principality ; and Muhenna perceiving that he was utterly unable to cope with him,—the people generally remaining deaf to his appeals for assistance,—shut himself up in the castle of er-Rastak, where he was besieged by the opposite party. Relying on a protnise of amnesty from Yaarub, he left the castle, whereby ' he virtually abdicated the Imamate but was subsequently seized, together with his companions, by Yaarub's men, and treacherously mur dered in prison, a.d . 1720, after a reign of less than two years. Yaarub did not lay claim to the Imamate, ' for that be longed of right to his cousin, Seif-bin-Su]tan/ , who had already been elected ; but being under age was deemed 'incapable of carrying on the administration.' He assumed the regency, however, and was shortly after raised to the Imamate by a council of chiefs, under the presidency of the Kadhi ^Adiy-bin-Suleiman. The considerations on which this act is justified afford an insight into the peculiar ad mixture of civil law and religious dogma which then pre vailed among the ^Omanis. ' The Kadhi' declared \aarub assoiled from the guilt of rebellion, and discharged him from making restitution for the wrongs he had perpe trated, on the ground that e&lt; repentance acquits the peni tent,' (p. 102). Yaarub had not been long in power when a reaction took place against him and in favour of the youthful Seif-bin- Sultan, who was then residing at Nezwa, under the guar dianship of his uncle, Belarab-bin-Nasir. At the earnest solicitation of the malcontents, Belarab left Nezwa and proceeded to enlist the sympathies of the ti'ibes in favour of his nephew. He gained over the Benu-Hinah, or el- Hinay, by suitable concessions, and with their aid succeeded in expelling Yaarub's Wali from the important city of er-xxxu introduction Rastak. He also gained over the Walis of Mdskat and other towns to his cause, and eventually obliged his rival to take refuge in the fortress of Nezwa. In the meantime, the Kadhi ^Adiy-bin-Suleiman, who had been the principal agent in YaaruVs election, repaired to er-Rastak, where he was seized and murdered, together with another Kadhi, who had probably acted as his colleague, and the bodies of both ' were dragged through the streets like dead cattle.' , On the intervention of several chiefs, Yaarub consented to evacuate Nezwa, on condition of being allowed to retire to the fort of Yabrin, and there to remain unmolested. These terms having been agreed to, a salute was fired from the castle of Nezwa, proclaiming a second time the Imamate of Seif-bin-Sultan. We now enter upon an entirely new phase of Omany his tory. Belarab-bin-Nasir having been appointed regent on behalf of his nephew, the chiefs of the tribes and towns came to congratulate him. Among them came Muhammad- bin-Nasir, of the Benu-Ghafir, (see ante, pp.ix,x), apparently as a representative of the northern tribes generally, who up to this period seem to have recognized the authority of the Imams. Stung to the quick by his sinister reception, he left the capital in anger, and forthwith entered into a cor respondence with Yaarub, the deposed Imam, and the in habitants of Behla to revolt against Belarab. A series of conflicts ensued between the two parties and their respective confederates, which resulted in the surrender of er-Rastak to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, who also obtained possession of the person of the young Imam, Seif-bin-Sultan, and his principal adherents, whom he detained as hostages, and thereafter obliged them to march in his suite wherever he went. No sooner had his army been admitted into er- Rastak, than they began plundering it, committing all kinds of outrages upon the inhabitants, who were driven to seek shelter in the neighbouring mountains, where one hundredand analysis. XXX1U women and children perished of thirst in a cave. They also took many captives and sent them out of the country to be sold as slaves. While at er-Rastak, Muhammad's dispos able force was augmented by a contingent of 6,500 men, levied chiefly from Julfar and es-Sirr. Conspicuous among these were the followers of Esihmah-bin-Matar, who spoke a jargon which the ^Omanis did not understand, (see note, p. 111). In the meantime, Yaarub, who had been put forward as the head of the insurrection, died at Nezwa. This event raised Muhammad-bin-Nasir to a still more conspicuous position, and in a short time he became master of all the strongholds of 'Oman, with the exception of Maskat and Barkah. The former place was still in the hands of the el-Yaarubah, but the Benu-Hinah expelled them. At this juncture Khalf-bin-Mubarak, or Nasir, nicknamed 'the Short,' a prominent chief of the el-Hinay, hearing that Mu hammad-bin-Nasir threatened Barkah, threw himself into that fort, and ordered Muhammad's messenger, who had been sent to demand its surrender, to be put to death. Bent on revenge, Muhammad divided his army into five troops and marched to el-Masnaah, a village on the coast twelve miles to the south-east of es-Suwaik, where he pitched his camp. Scouts were sent out to reconnoitre, and after some skirmishes with the outposts of the enemy, and a fight on their own private account between two chiefs who had espoused opposite sides in the contest, and who seized this opportunity to settle an old-standing grudge, Muhammad- bin-Nasir moved upon Barkah with his main force, one troop of which—that of Rahmah-bin-Matar—possessed 'guns, which were drawn over the ground/' Khali's people were obliged to retire into the fort, where their assailants lay siege to them, and a detachment was sent to invest es-Sib, between Barkah and Mdskat, Khalf himselt managing to effect his escape to the latter place. /XXXIV INTRODUCTION Provisions failing the besiegers, Muhammad-bin-Nasir returned with them to er-Rastak, where he was attacked with small-pox. On his recovery he proceeded to ezh- Zhahirah, taking Seif-bin-Sultan, the young Imam, and his suite of the el-Yaurubah with him, and leaving Belarab-bin- Nasir, the late regent, bound there. A successful compaign against the tribes and forts opposed to him in that district enabled him to dismiss many of his auxiliaries. While Muhammad-bin-Nasir was absent on the above expedition, Khalf-bin-Mubarak, el-Hinay, 'the Short,' col lected an army and attacked er-Rastak, which he captured, receiving the submission of the inhabitants. He then went to Nakhl, which was surrendered to him; and in the mean time one of his staunch allies seized Sohar. These achieve ments on the part of his rival made Muhammad anxious to reach er-Rastak, but he deemed it prudent to secure the fort of Yabrm 1 on the way thither, and while he was be sieging that stronghold Khalf invested el-Hazm. Having recalled some of his auxiliaries Muhammad fell upon the investing force and dispersed them, but not feeling strong enough to attack er-Rastak he visited ezh-Zhahirah again, where several of the towns had rebelled against his autho rity. Having settled matters there he returned to Nezwa and spent six months in recruiting his army; after which he made repeated inroads into the districts of the Benu- Hinah, who on their part had called in the assistance of their allies from all quarters. Muhammad, however, proved too strong for them, and he succeeded eventually in driving Khalf as far south as Ibra, where he was welcomed at first by the el-Harth, but the invaders proceeding to cut down their date-trees,— one of the common usages of war among 1 The late Colonel Taylor refers to Muhammad-bin-Nasir under the name of ' Mahomet-Ghafari, Prince of Jabrin.'

XXXV the tribes of 'Oman,—they secured themselves from further molestation by dismissing the refugee, who thereupon made his way to M^skat. On Muhammad-bin-Nasir's return to Nezwa he assembled the learned together and placed his resignation in their hands, declaring that he was tired of continuing the contest. The people, however, fearing the vengeance of Khalf, begged him to assume the sovereignty. On receiving their solemn promise of allegiance, he acceded to their request, and was elected Imam on the 2nd of Oc tober, 1724. On the following Friday he read himself in, as it were, by leading in the public prayers at Nezwa. The state of affairs at this period was as follows :—the el-Ghafiry and their allies had so far prevailed against the el-Yaarubah, the el-Hinay, and the other Yemeny tribes, that they now saw one of their number elevated to the highest dignity over 'Oman. Their representative, Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, the newly-elected Imam, was master of Nezwa and most of ezh-Zhahirah, and he held in his power the person of the young Imam, Seif-bin-Sultan, and his principal partisans among the el-Yaarubah, whom he con ducted to Yabrin, where he took up his residence. Khalf, on the other hand, the leader of the lienu-IIinah, and Mu hammad's most formidable rival, together with those of the el-Yaarubah who were disposed to make common cause with him, had possession of Maskat, Barkah, es-Sib, and Sohar, the most important places on the coast, and also the inland capital, er-Rastak. Muhammad-bin-Nasir soon found that his election to the Imamate exasperated rather than allayed the antagonism of his opponents. He was obliged to appeal once more to the northern tribes for assistance, and marched with a large army to Sohar, which tendered its submission at once; but the castle held out against him. In the meantime, Khalf- bin-Mubarak, his old rival, w T as on the alert, watching tor every opportunity to checkmate his manoeuvres. Hopelessxxxvi introduction of being a match for him in open fight, Khalf resorted to a stratagem, as crafty as it proved successful. Rightly gauging the temper of Muhammad's allies and the necessity imposed upon the new Imam of administering justice with the strictest impartiality, he bribed a Persian agriculturist at Sohar to bring a charge of trespassing on his fields against two men of each of the three principal northern tribes, the Benu-Yas, the Benu-Naim, and the Benu-Kutb. Muhammad listened to the complaint in person, and offered to indemnify the plaintiff; but the latter, acting on KhalPs su oo es ^o n ,&gt; refused the award, and loudly demanded 'jus tice.' Thereupon the chiefs of the alleged culprits came forward and solemnly asserted the innocence of the accused; but in spite of their intervention the men were ordered to be bastinadoed, an indignity which the northern tribes re sented by quitting the camp the same night and returning homeward, leaving Muhammad with his 'Omany levies only to encounter Khalf, who shortly after appeared in the field against him. In the engagement which followed Khalf was slain and his adherents routed. Pursuing his advantage Muhammad made for the castle, where a detachment of the garrison was drawn up to oppose his entrance. During the struggle which ensued he was shot dead by a musket-ball fired from the walls of the fortress. I or the space of three days the fate of their respective leaders was kept secret from their antagonists by both parties ; but when it could no longer be concealed Mu hammad's levies returned home, and the garrison at Sohar forthwith recognized Seif-bin-Sultan—who, it will be re membered, was always made to accompany Muhammad-bin- Nasir, and admitted him into the castle. From thence he pi oceeded to er-Kastak, where the people tendered him their allegiance, and then to Nezwa, where the Kadhi set him up once more as Imam,—he being now of full age, a.d 1728.and analysis. xxxvn Hardly had Seif-bin-Sultau been restored to his former dignity when Belarab-bin-Hitnyar—who appears to have been a cousin of his—was elected Imam by a portion of the inhabitants of ezh-Zhahirah. Finding, after two or three unsuccessful attempts, that he was unable to cope with his antagonist, Seif sent to Mekran and engaged a body of Beloochees, 1 who were all armed with muskets, to cooperate with him. These having been placed under the command of his brother, Belarab-bin-Sultan, were subse- quently cut off, almost to a man, in an engagement with Belarab-bin-Himyar. On hearing of this fresh disaster Seif resorted as a last expedient to Nadir-Shah, of Persia, who readily promised to assist him. In the meantime, how ever, and in order to test the pluck of the ; Omany sove reign,—so runs the story,—he sent him a viciously restive horse, on the understanding that his engagement would only hold good if Seif showed himself capable of riding the animal. The trial came off in the valley behind Maskat, and the young Imam acquitted himsell to the astonishment of the Shtih's messenger and the bystanders generally by coursing the horse several times round the valley, until it finally leapt over the town wall, breaking its legs, the rider falling on his feet uninjured. At this period, when Seif-bin-Sultan is recorded to have lost every friend on whom he could rely for counsel, some of his officers recommended Ahmed-bin-Said, of the Al-Bu- Said family, as a brave man, and one in every way worthy of his confidence. What Ahmed's antecedents were en titling him to such a reputation we are left to conjecture. Judging from our author's narrative, he was engaged in trade, and it was on the way to Maskat, whither he was going on 1 This is the first recorded instance of mercenaries having been ob tained from Mekran for service in 'Oman. The experiment gradually grew into a custom, and the Beloochees in the pay of succeeding Imams and Seyyids have generally been conspicuous for their bravery and fidelity.■ ■; ''I ' i I Mu . a XXXVlll INTRODUCTION business, that an accidental meeting took place between him and the Imam, who was travelling in the opposite direction towards er-Rastak. Seif subsequently sent him to execute some commissions for him at el-Hasa, and eventually made him Wali, or Governor, over the important town of Sohar. Ahmed's administration soon won for him the esteem of the inhabitants, and his judicious and liberal policy towards the northern tribes generally, including those of ezh-Zha- hirah, made him highly popular with those troublesome neighbours, who flocked to him in crowds. Whether or not this course was prompted by ulterior ambitious views it is difficult to say, but SeiPs suspicions were aroused and he summoned him to Maskat, having given secret orders for his imprisonment in the Eastern fort as soon as he arrived. Ahmed obeyed and reached Maskat, accompanied by one attendant only; but being luckily apprised by the author's grandfather of the fate which awaited him, he re turned forthwith to Sohar, much to the Imam's chagrin, w T ho vented his rage upon the officers who had been in structed to seize him, and also upon the person who had warned him of his danger. Baffled in this attempt Seif fitted out a fleet of four ships of war, and anchoring before Sohar dispatched a messenger to summon Ahmed to his presence. The latter accordingly embarked in a small boat, but on nearing the vessel where the Imam was, some of the slaves on watch beckoned him to return. Taking the friendly hint he rowed back to land, and paid no further attention to the Imam's communications. Shortly after, through the intervention of several of the chiefs, a recon ciliation was effected between Seif and Ahmed, the latter consenting to leave his eldest son Hilal in the hands of the former, as a pledge of his loyalty. On the reported arrival of the Persians at Bunder-Fakkan, 10th March, 1787, the Imam restored Hilal to his father, and proceeded himself to es-Sir,—which I identify with Abu-Zhaby, the Abothubbeeand analysis. xxxix of our charts, on the western side of the promontory,— whither the Persian vessels had sailed in the interval. The arrival of the Persians and the part which Seif-bin- Sultan took in soliciting their aid form the subject of an indignant protest addressed anonymously to the latter by one of the notables of 'Oman. After setting forth that his present confederates were actuated solely by lust of con quest, the writer proceeds to impress upon the Imam what will be the disastrous results of their success; asks by what right he placed the Muslims in jeopardy of being ruled over by a people obnoxious to the Divine curse; reminds him of the capture of the island of el-Bahrein by these same liber tines, and the excesses which they perpetrated there; and winds up with a fervid peroration, enjoining the Imam to forego so unholy an alliance, and to rely on integrity and piety to sustain the justness of his cause. On joining the Persians at es-Sir, Seif proceeded with them towards ezh-Zhahirah, where they were met, in May, 1736, by the rival Imam, Belarab-bin-Himyar, who had col lected a large force to oppose the invaders. An engagement between the two armies resulted in the utter rout of the 'Omanis and the advance of the Persians to el-Bereimy, which they occupied, and from whence they marched inland as far as 'Obra, slaughtering the inhabitants indiscrimi nately, hurling children headlong from bridges, and seizing many women, whom they sent to Shiraz to be sold as slaves, returning subsequently to es-Sir. Seif, seeing reason to be dissatisfied with their conduct towards himself, sepa rated from them, and after making peace with several of the towns on the way reached Maskat in safety. Having been joined by reinforcements from Shiraz the Persians again advanced into the interior, and after receiving the submission of the tribes of ezh-Zhahirah marched to Behla, which place they seized and garrisoned, and then went on to Nezwa, capturing that town also, Belarab-bin-xl introduction Hirayar, who had occupied it, fleeing at their approach ; but the fort held out against them. The same barbarities cha racterized their proceedings here also. From Nezwa they marched to Azka, and from thence towards the sea-coast, turning off in the direction of Maskat, which they seized and occupied, with the exception of the two principal forts. These they besieged until the 15th of May, 1738, and then set out for Barkah, whither Seif-bin-Sultan had preceded them with his ships, and from whence he had gone inland to ezh-Zhahirah, leaving a garrison of the el-Maawal there to defend the forts. At a meeting between him and Belarab-bin-Himyar, the latter was induced by 'the Benu- Ghafir, his chief supporters, to resign his Imamate to Seif, ' in order to heal their divisions and rivalries, and that both might join against the common enemy, the Persians.' The Persians before Barkah were unable to capture the foi'ts, and their countrymen stationed at Behla, hearing no thing of them, sent a detachment of one hundred horse to inquire what they were doing. These were cut off on the road by the ^Omanis, who, emboldened by success, attacked their garrison at Behla and expelled them, allowing them to depart with their arms and chattels. The Imam Seif-bin- Sultan furnished them with an escort to Sohar, which was being invested at that time by their comrades; but Ahmed- bin-Said sallying out killed most of them and imprisoned the remainder in the castle, where they died. These re verses induced the Persians to quit Barkah for es-Sir, from whence a portion of them returned to their own country, so that 'Oman was rid of them, with the exception of the force which was besieging Sohar. The garrisons generally were now in favour of Seif-bin-Sultan ; nevertheless, the sheikhs of some of the principal towns took this oppor tunity of virtually deposing him, by raising a competitor to the Imamate in the person of Sultan-bin-Murshid, one of the el-Yaarubah; but whether related or not to the rulingand analysis. xli family is not stated. Concurrent tradition describes Seif- bin-Sultan as a profligate and debauchee, and his character may have rendered him unpopular with the more religious portion of the community. The new Imam was installed in the mosque at Nakhl, a.d . 1738. Sultan-bin-Murshid's first efforts were directed against Seif-bin-Sultan, whom he hunted from one place to another until he drove him from Maskat, taking possession of that town. Seif once more resorted to the Persians at es-Sir, and promised to give them Sohar in perpetuity, if they suc ceeded in re-establishing him in the Imamate. They ac cordingly invested the latter place by sea and land, and also detached a large force against the forts of Maskat, which they eventually captured, and the fort at el-Matrah and other defences besides. Seif-bin-Sultan, disappointed at finding that his foreigu allies were not disposed to make over their conquests to him, quitted them by stealth for el- Hazm, and on entering that fortress remarked to one of his officers: ff This is my castle and my grave. I am become an eyesore to every one, and the quiet of death will be pre ferable to any happiness which dominion has afforded me.' The Persians continued the siege of Sohar for nine months with an army said to have amounted to 00,000 men, their land forces discharging as many as 3,000 cannon-shot at the fort every day,—the reader may make whatever allow ance he pleases for exaggeration in these numbers,—while Ahmed-bin-Said sallied out repeatedly, killing, as the author naively remarks, as many of the enemy as he could. The Imam Sultan-bin-Murshid on the other hand, hearing of the capture of Maskat and el-Matrah by the Persians, levied a large force from er-Rastak, ezh-Zhahirah, and the Wadi of the Benu-Ghafir, and marched with them towards the coast. On the way all these levies abandoned him, with the excep tion of two hundred men, thirty of whom belonged to his own people, the el-Yaarubah. Advancing with this little 9xlii introduction band towards Sohar he encountered a Persian cavalry out- post, and drove them back upon the main body of the be siegers. This skirmish was soon followed by a regular en- gagement, in which the Persian commander, Kelb-^Aly/ and a hundred of his followers were slain. On the Imam^s side the loss was still greater : all the el-Yaarubah perished on the field and fifty men besides, and the Imam himself was mortally wounded. He managed, however, to make his way into the castle of Sohar, where he died in the course of three days. Intelligence of his death having been com municated to Seif-bin-Sultan at el-Hazm, he also succumbed to the weight of his misfortunes and expired shortly after. The obstinate defence of Sohar by Ahmed-bin-Said, coupled with the death of their ally, Seif-bin-Sultan, led the Persians to propose a reconciliation with the former, on condition of their being allowed to depart unmolested, carry ing their arms and stores with them. These terms having been agreed to, a like proposal was made on behalf of the garrison at Mdskat. To this Ahmed gave an evasive answer, de signed nevertheless to convey an impression in the affirma tive. Thereupon Taky-Khan, the Persian commander-in- chief, embarked with his troops for Bunder-el-^Abbas, and shortly after Ahmed started with 2,000 men for Barkah, which place surrendered to him at discretion. Next, in order to withdraw the trade and supplies from Maskat, he set up a customs-office there, which fully realized his expec tations, for ships from all parts frequented it, and the Persians at Maskat were driven to great straits for pro visions. Under these circumstances they dispatched one Majid-bin-Sultan, a near relative of the late Imam Seif-bin- Sultan, with a communication to the Shah, apprising him of their critical position and suggesting that the messenger should be sent back with a letter authorizing them to de liver up all the posts which they held to him. Majid ac- 1 Or, 'Aly's Dog ; I take this to be an opprobrious epithet and not the real name of the Persian commander.and analysis. xliii complished the mission entrusted to him, but being wrecked off Sohar on the way back, Ahmed obtained possession of the Shah's letter, taking advantage of which he forthwith dispatched one of his officers to Mdskat with the letter and four hundred men, and instructed him to take over the fortifications from the Persians. The latter believing that he was acting for Majid delivered up all the fortresses into his hands, which he immediately garrisoned with his own men. Ahmed's next manoeuvre casts an indelible stigma on his memory, and can only be palliated on the ground that treachery was practically recognized as justifiable strategy by both parties, and that the atrocities of the invaders richly deserved the retribution which was meted out to them. The Persians were invited to Barkah, where great preparations were made to entertain them prior to their final departure. The people's goods and chattels were placed under contri bution to provide for the feast, and seething caldrons of meat and dishes of sweetmeats were borne to the unwelcome guests amidst murmurs of indignation uttered by the ^Orna- nis against Ahmed for his hospitality to the hated foreigners, who in their opinion deserved a very different treatment. While the rank and file were being regaled in their tents, fifty of the principal officers, by special invitation, sat down to a grand banquet with Ahmed in the fort. While so en gaged the public crier proclaimed: ' Any one who has a grudge against the Persians may now take his revenge \' The result, as might have been expected, was an indiscri minate slaughter of the hapless Persians, until Ahmed in terposed to arrest it; but those who escaped were reserved for a still more terrible fate. They were embarked in ships, professedly to be conveyed to Bunder-el-'Abbas, but the sailors—acting there can be little doubt on superior instruc tions—set fire to the ships not far from Barkah, escaping to laud themselves, leaving the wretched Persians to be burnt• I i 'i &lt; -If l.ll If •it. It-' xliv introduction or drowned, Ahmed crowned his treachery by putting to death all the officers who had been his guests in the fort. Relieved from the presence of a foreign enemy, the power and prestige of the el-Yaarubah broken, and with many strong claims upon the gratitude of the ^Omanis for his bravery and patriotism, Ahmed^s succession to the supremo power was almost a matter of course. After making a triumphant tour through the principal towns, where he was received with the greatest enthusiasm, he was eventually elected Irmim by a council of the chiefs assembled at er- Rastak. The transfer of the government from the el- Yaarubah to Ahmed-bin-Said, the first of a new dynasty, after the former had held it for one hundred and seventeen years,—including the short reign of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry,—took place a.d . 1 741. After Ahmed's accession to the Imamate it was less diffi cult than it might otherwise have been to discover that several preternatural omens had foreshadowed his future greatness. The record of these phenomena preserved by our author may be regarded as illustrative of the supersti tious temper of the ^Omanis, a temper by no means confined to the followers of Islam, but more or less prevalent where- ever religion is dissociated from science and reason. Be sides, some extraordinary sanctions were probably looked for to warrant the election of one who, as far as this history discloses—and it was specially written to extol him and his descendants—belonged to a class having no pretension to such a distinction. His pedigree is as brief as it could well be ; he is simply 'es-Saidy, el-Azdy, el-'Omany,' that is, of the family of Said, of the stock of the el-Azd, 1 settled in 'Oman. If, as I conjecture, the Al-Bu-Said are identical 1 Mr, Palgrave erroneously describes Ahmed-bin-Sa'id as 'of the Ghafaree family,' Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. ii. p. 256. The Benu- Ghafir, as shown at pp. ix, x, were of Ma'addicnot of Kahtanic descent. Moreover, they have always been at variance with the el-Azd in 'Oman.and analysis. xlv with the Benu-Said,—even that name only occurs once in these annals prior to the appearance of Ahmed,—they re sided at el-^Akr, a suburb of Nezwa, and are described as being the most prominent among the inhabitants of that locality. Ahmed's early career as a merchant^ and the part which he subsequently took in public affairs until his eleva tion to the Imamate, have already been narrated in the pre ceding pages. His first care on assuming the reins of government was to draw up a set of rules for the financial, judicial, and fiscal departments of the administration, over which he placed nominees of his own selection. A superintendent was ap pointed to take charge of the navy, but military affairs he retained under his own immediate control. Having pro bably learnt by personal experience that the feudal levies were not always to be depended upon, he established a small standing army consisting of 1,100 African slaves and 1,000 free soldiers, with which he garrisoned the citadel at er-Rastak, providing each with a fine camel or horse. He also paid more attention to outward pomp than seems to have been usual with his predecessors, for ' whenever he marched from one place to another four banners attached to staffs, the heads of two of which were of gold and the other two of silver, were borne in his retinue, and he never moved about without being accompanied by a number of Kadhis, scholars, and notables, and a party of executioners,—a brave set of fellows.' His dominions extended from the end of Jaalan on the south to el-Bereimy in ezh-Zhahirah on the north, including the country to the eastward of those two points as far as the sea-coast. Ahmed had not been long in power before the Nizariyyah and other disaffected tribes incited Belarab-bin-Himyar, of the el-Yaarubah, the ex-Imam who had abdicated in favour of his late cousin Seif-bin-Sultan, (pp. xl, 143), to rebel against him. At this time Ahmed was absent on an expeditionxlvi introduction against the people of es-Sir, at el-Bithnah, who had threat ened to invade Sohar. Many were killed on both sides without any decisive result. On the way back the Imam left his army by stealth and took up his abode in the hut of an old woman at Yankal,—a place apparently not far from Sohar,—allowing his camel with its trappings to go loose. (His object was to ascertain what would be the effect of his disappearance upon the malcontent chiefs.) The stratagem was perfectly successful, for a rumour of his death having got abroad, Belarab-bin-Himyar took the field with 20,000 men and invested Nezwa. Apprised of these proceedings by the reports brought to him by the old woman, Ahmed set out by night for Sohar, and having levied all the loyal tribes attacked the insurgents and utterly routed them. Among the slain was Belarab-bin-Himyar. It was probably not long after this engagement that, according to the late Captain (afterwards Colonel) Taylor, Ahmed married a daughter of one of the ex-princes of the el-Yaarubah, thereby ' connecting his own family with the most illus trious persons in his dominions.' 1 Ahmed's next expedition was undertaken at the earnest solicitation of the people of el-Basrah, which place had been captured by the Persians. Taking with him a fleet of ten men-of-war and a force of 10,000 men in smaller vessels, he first broke the iron chain which the Persians had stretched across the Shatt-el-'Arab by driving his ship the er-Rah- mdny against it, and then after a hand-to-hand fight with the invaders utterly routed them. In recognition of his services on that occasion the Ottoman Sultan awarded the ruler of 'Oman a yearly gratuity, or pension, which the author states was paid regularly by the governor of el-Bas rah up to the time of the Imam's grandson, the late Seyyid Said. Not long after, Ahmed dispatched an envoy in his ship 1 Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. p. 7.and analysis. the er-Rahmdny to Mangalore to inquire why the usual sup plies of rice had not reached 'Oman from that quarter. Tippoo-Sahib, who appears to have been acting at the time for his father Haidar-'Aly, the Moghul Emperor Shah 'Alam's lieutenant in the Carnatic, received the envoy most courteously, and informed him that the non-arrival of the ships was owing to the depredations of a band of pirates who had established themselves on the Malabar coast. Thereupon the envoy, having been furnished with a pilot by the local authorities, attacked the pirates' stronghold and killed their chief, much to the delight of the people of Man- galore, who loaded the envoy with presents for himself and for the Imam. Haidar-'Aly, who in the narrative is styled the Nawwab's, that is, the Emperor's Malik, subsequently sent an ambassador to the Imam Ahmed at er-Kastak in structed to conclude an offensive and defensive alliance with him on the part of the Emperor. The treaty was duly exe cuted and a site for a house was allotted to his representa tive at Maskat. The house still goes by the name of tho Nawwab's. I conceive that the hostilities which arose between the Imam and Nasir-bin-Muhammad, of the el-Ghafiry tribe, (pp. 181—186), follow next in order. The author states at p. 181 that they occurred ten years before the war between the Imam and his two sons, and ten years after the war be tween him and Belarab-bin-Himyar, which has already been noticed. 1 Muhammad-bin-Nasir had been governor over the island of el-Bahrein under Sultan-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby. On its capture by the Persians, during the reign of Seif-bin- Sultan, he held out for some time in the fort of 'Arada, but eventually came to terms with the invaders and then went 1 By an oversight, at the end of p. 181 and the beginning of the page following, the war between the Imam and his two sons, Seif and Sul tan, is represented as having taken place ten years before, instead of ten years after, his war with Bela'rab-bin-Himyar.I ; mm xlviii introduction ] jit; f' If! ■; '.'f: to settle in ezh-Zbahirah, where he soon acquired consider able influence over the tribes of that district, and espoused the cause of the Imam so warmly that the latter gave him his daughter in marriage. Shortly after, however, he excited the tribes to rebel, and applied to Ibn-Rahmah, el-IIawaly, the most prominent chief of the tribes on the northern coast, to cooperate with him. The Imam on his part raised large levies throughout 'Oman, and enlisted a considerable num ber of Belooch and Zidgal mercenaries from Mekran to oppose him. After a severe fight, in which the Imam's troops were thoroughly beaten, a reconciliation was effected between the contending parties, and the treaty of peace was renewed by Seif-bin-Nasir on the death of his father, Mu hammad. It is evident from these transactions that the power of the el-Ghafiry was still predominant in ezh-Zhahirah, and that the Imam's sovereignty in that quarter was little more than nominal. Ahmed was not more successful in his efforts to crush the el-Yaarubah, who were still in possession of two strong fortresses in 'Oman. That of Nakhl was held on his be half by Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, whom he un justly accused of abetting his sons Seif and Sultan in their attempts to seduce his subjects from their allegiance, and of supplying them with troops, which enabled them to seize the important fort at Barkah. Refusing to accept Muham mad-bin-Suleiman's explanations, Ahmed collected a large native force, which he supplemented with levies from Mek ran, and attacked Nakhl; but Muhammad, who in the mean time had called in the aid of the Benu-Naim and Kutb from the north, fell on the assailants and utterly routed them, which obliged the Imam to conclude an ignominious peace with his adversary. A subsequent attack made upon the fortress of el-Hazm, which was also in the hands of the el- Yaarubah, resulted in a similar disaster. From this period the tribes on the northern coast, who were now generallyAND analysis. xlix appealed to by one or other of the contending parties in 'Oman, exercised a preponderating influence in the affliirs of that country. The rebellion of Seif and Sultan, his fourth and fifth sons, was the next misfortune which befell the Imam Ahmed, lie had forgiven their treacherous seizure of the fort at Barkah, but now they took possession of the eastern and western fortresses commanding the harbour of Maskat, and set their father's authority at defiance. Through the intervention of the Kadhis at Maskat a reconciliation was effected between the father and his sons, and it was eventually agreed that the former should hold the western and the latter the east ern fort. A year after, Seif and Sultan seized their elder brother Said and confined him in their fort, and on their refusing to surrender him the father marched with an army from er-Rastak and opened fire upon them from the western fort. During this unnatural contest, which appears to have been carried on with great animosity as well as bravery on both sides, one of the Imam's servants who happened to be in the eastern fort effected his escape, taking Said with him, whom he delivered over safely to his father. Is everthcless, the war was carried on between the two parties more briskly than ever, and it was only when the two rebellious sons heard that Ibn-Rahmah, el-llawaly, had invested er-Rastak with 30,000 of the northern Arabs, that, fearing lest his successes might prove fatal to their own claims, they made overtures of peace, which were generously accepted by theii father. On hearing of their reconciliation the northern Arabs retired into their own territory. After a reign of thirty-four years Ahmed died at er- Rastak in January, 1775. It is not easy to form a correct estimate of his qualities as an administrator. Ilis earlier successes, especially those against the Persian invaders, to which he owed his elevation to the Imamate, rallied round him most of the tribes, who for a time jusily regarded him h1 introduction as the saviour of their common country ; but the jealousy of the el-Yaarubah whom he had supplanted, and the rest less ambition of the el-Ghafiry, soon led them to aspire once more for the supremacy. His ellbrts to coerce the latter, who could now always rely on the support of their kinsmen, the el-Kawasim and the petty tribes in alliance with them, such as the Benu-Naim and Kutb and the esh-Shuwamis, generally ended in a compromise decidedly in their favour. In fact, the independent tribes on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf acquired an ascendency during this reign which made them a standing menace to the tranquillity of ; Oman. Another fertile source of discord, and consequently of national weakness, is attributable to the change in the mode of succession, which appears to have been tacitly sanctioned at this period. Originally, and for at least nine hundred years, the Imam was elected for his personal merits, irre spective of family descent; hence his sons, if he left any, had no more claim to the Imamate than any other citizen. After the supremacy had fallen into the hands of the el- Yaarubah, and during the continuance of that dynasty, these principles underwent a modification. The 'Omanis still started from the same point: the Imam was elected, but a strong preference was given to the ruling family over all others, and to a son—not necessarily the eldest—of the last Imam over the other members of his family. In the case of Ahmed-bin-Said, el-Bu-Saidy, who succeeded the last of the el-Yaarubah, there was a return to the old system ; but it is evident that under him the popular feeling became once more inclined to lineal succession, with a bias in favour of the eldest male issue. Had the prior right of primo geniture been affirmed and sanctioned by competent autho rity, it is probable that 'Oman might have been spared many of those intestine wars for the supremacy which arose even during Ahmed^s lifetime, and which in a greater or less degree have been the bane of the country ever since. TheAND ANALYSIS. li rebellion of Seif and Sultan, his fourth and fifth sons, which embittered the end of his reign, originated in their ambi tion to supplant their brothers, whose claims might per chance be preferred to theirs. The manner in which they sought to avert such a contingency was by seducing the people from their allegiance to their father, and by securing beforehand the fortifications of Maskat, which by this time had eclipsed er-Rastak in importance, and become the most lucrative possession in the kingdom. A collateral evil to that just noticed sprang up almost simultaneously. The Imam had to provide for his sons, the ' Seyyids,' or Princes, as they now began to be styled, and in doing so generally gave them a town, with its usual defences, by way of appanage. The practice thus initiated gradually developed into a system, and the Seyyids thereafter claimed it as a prerogative that some portion of the terri tories of the state should be allotted to their separate juris diction and support. The gift nominally involved feudal obedience on the part of the recipient, and was liable to be revoked; but it was not always feasible either to exact the submission of a prince of the blood or to dispossess him when once he had established himself in his petty domain and formed alliances with neighbouring tribes. 1 he subsequent annals of 'Oman are replete with accounts of ever-recurring feuds between the sovereign for the time being and rival Seyyids arising mainly from this source. Ahmed left seven sons, namely,— Also three daughters, whose names the author reserves, iC for propriety's sake.' 1 The chiefs and people had wished 1 One of them, whom the author styles the ' Imam s daughter, played a conspicuous part in the political affairs of the country up to the regency of the late Seyyid Sa id. 1. mm. 2.

He went to Gnzerat in search of surgical advice and died there, leaving his son -'Aly behind him in 'Oman. The electors then chose Said, Ahmed's second son, to be Imam, and after his installation all the fortresses were made over to him, with the exception of el-Hazm, Nakhl, and Yabrin, which were still held by the el-Yaaru- bah and the Benu-Ghafir. He made his next brother, Kais, governor of Sohar, and one Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, be longing to an influential family of the Al-Bu-Said, his Wakil or representative at Maskat. 1 He resided himself at er-Ilastak, the inland capital. The new Imam invaded the district of es-Sir and slew many of the Benu-Ghafir,—that is the sum total of his re corded exploits. His indolence and extortion soon made him obnoxious to the people, who twice essayed to depose him and to raise his brother Kais to the Imamate. Both attempts having failed, his son Hamed determined to super sede him, and by a course of the most consummate deceit and treachery eventually succeeded in obtaining posses sion of the fortresses at Maskat from Muhammad-bin-Khal- fan, together with the general administration of the country, which his father was induced to surrender into his hands. The Seyyid Hamed, who took up his residence at Maskat, was now the virtual ruler of 'Oman ; nevertheless, his father 1 Francklin touched at Maskat on his way from Bengal to Persia in January, 1789, and was well received by this official, whom he styles ' Sheick Khulfaun, the Vakeel.' The Imam, he says, lived in great splendour at a place two days' journey inland. He mentions that several ' Gentoo' merchants resided at Maskat, for the convenience of trade; also a broker on behalf of the English East India Company, ' but the Government will not admit (though often urged to it) of any European factory being established.' Pinkerton's Voyages and Travels, vol. ix. p. 237.AND ANALYSIS. liii continued to retain the title of Imam till his death, which occurred during the reign of the late Seyyid Said, the son of Sultan, the Imam Said's brother, who succeeded Haraed. While the Imam Said lived it would have been incompatible with the religious system of the Ibadhiyah, unless he had been previously deposed, to appoint another to that dignity; hence those who administered the government during his lifetime were simply styled ' Seyyids/ The question why the title of ' Imam' was not resumed after his death is discussed in the article on the Imamate given in Appen dix A. Very few noteworthy events * occuiTed during the ten years of H^med's regency. He was on friendly terms with the el-Yaarubah, and does not appear to have been molested by the Benu-Ghafir, although he succeeded in capturing el- Hazm from one of their allies, which he then made over to the Benu-Hinah, or el-Hiuay. He added a tower to the western fortress commanding the harbour at Maskat, and built two detached forts at Kiwa and Barkah. Some mis understanding having arisen betwixt him and his uncle Seif, which led to the departure of the latter for the east coast of Africa, probably with a hostile intent against his nephew's authority in that quarter, Hamed followed him to Lamu; but finding that Seif had died there he returned to 'Oman, when his uncle Sultan began to retaliate upon him by stirring up the Nizariyyah of Semail to rebel. A reconciliation was eventually effected between uncle and nephew, and they continued on friendly terms ever after, although Ildmed lived in great dread of Sultan's superior prowess and in fluence. Hdmed was making preparations for a warlike ex pedition on a grand scale when he was seized with small pox at Maskat, where he was joined by his father, the Imam Said, from er-Rastak, on the night of whose arrival the new cr-Rahmdny frigate was burnt in the harbour. He died on the 18th of March, 1702, and was buried in the central Wadi, behind Maskat.liv introduction On the death of his son Hamed, the Imam Said resumed his authority, and made his son Ahmed governor of Maskat and his nephew ^Aly-bin-Hilal governor of Barkah. He himself returned to er-Rastak, where he led a life of indo lence, and allowed his son, brothers, and nephews to carry out their separate aims with little or no interference on his part. The sequel will show how by treachery, craft, and bravery Sultan overcame all other competitors and even tually succeeded to the regency, the nominal Imamate still continuing to be held by his elder brother, Said-bin-el-Imam- Ahmed. Sultan's first step was to get possession of Barkah, then in the hands of his nephew 'Aly, whom he induced to set out for er-Eastak, professedly to make peace between him and the Imam. During 'Aly's absence he managed to seize the fort, killing one of the garrison in cold blood with his own hand, after which he summoned several of the tribes and marched towards Maskat. When these proceedings were reported to the Imam he forthwith dispatched 'Aly with directions to aid his son Ahmed to resist the meditated attack. The two cousins were ill prepared for resistance, the majority of the population were in favour of Sultan, and a traitor who commanded one of the gates having ad mitted the invaders within the walls Sultan soon became master of all the fortifications. In order to throw his elder brother Kais, who held el-Matrah and apparently Sohar also, off his guard, he wrote to tell him that he had taken Mas kat for him, and advised him to prevent their brother Said from interfering. Kais took the bait and sent to inform the Imam that if he moved to the relief of Maskat he would march against er-Rastak. A reconciliation was subsequently effected between the rivals on the following conditions :—Said the Imam was to hold the eastern and Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil, the western fort, and in the event of either of the brothersAND ANALYSIS. Iv breaking the peace he was to transfer it to the other. He was also to act as Wali, while Sultan was to have the re venues of Maskat to expend on the army and navy and the defence of the eastern fort. On one of his subsequent visits to Maskat Sultan sent for the commandant of the eastern fort, and by threatening his life induced him to surrender the fort. Following out his former artful policy, he wrote to tell his brother Kais that he was acting on his behalf, and again urged him to restrain any action on the part of their brother, the Imam. Left free to carry out his ambitious aims. Sultan's next object was ♦ to secure the western fort. Taking with him a company of the Al-Wahibah to Mdskat, he gave out that he was attacked with small-pox. On hearing this rumour Muhammad-bin- Khalfan, accompanied by his father and one of his brothers, went to pay him a visit of condolence. When they rose to depart Sultan ordered the former to be arrested, and did not release him until he had surrendered the western fort into his hands. Not satisfied with these successes he next attacked el-Matrah, the appanage of his brother Kais, and took the fort there also. A coalition was then formed between Kais, his brother the Imam, and Muhammad-bin-Khalfan to arrest Sultan's further encroachments, and together they levied a force said to have amounted to 60,000 men. Sultan, by lighting fires on the hills, first deceived the enemy into believing that he had an overpowering force with him, and then managed to detach Kais from his allies by promising to give him the forts of Badbad and Semiiil; but on Kais's arrival at the former place the garrison, by Sultan's orders, opened fire upon him. Thereupon Kais returned to Sohar and the Imam Said to er-Rastak, leaving Sultan master of the situa tion. The people of 'Oman, the esh-Sharkiyyah, and those of Jaalan now recognized him as their ruler. He was not formally elected, neither was he proclaimed Imam, for that] v i introduction dignity was still nominally held by his brother Said at er- Rastak. It was probably about this time that the East India Com pany entered into political relations with thornier of 'Oman. The first treaty on record was made with Sultan, and is dated the 12th of August, 1798. Its object was to secure his alliance against the suspected designs of the French and the commercial rivalry of the Dutch in that quarter, and to obtain his sanction for the establishment of a British factory and garrison at Gombroon, since known as Bunder- el- ; Abbas. The second, which is dated 18th January, 1800, and signed on the part of the company by John Malcolm, Envoy,' provides that an ' English gentleman of respecta bility, on the part of the Honourable Company, shall always reside at the port of Maskat, and be an agent through whom all the intercourse between the states shall be conducted. In these documents Sultan is styled 'Imaum,' as well by his own as by the British representative. I can only ac count for this fact on the supposition that both parties be lieved him to be virtually possessed of the implied autho rity ; but it is certain, nevertheless, that the title is never given to him in the author's narrative of his regency. Ho is uniformly referred to as ' the Seyyid Sultan. After seizing the coast towns of es-Suwaik and el-Mas- naah from his brother Said, Sultan turned his thoughts to foreign conquest, and captured Shahbar (Charbar) on the coast of Mekran, and the islands of el-Kishm and Ilormuz from the Benu-Main. He also took the island of el-Bahrein from the el-'Uttub tribe, who had invaded and occupied it a few years previously. In this instance he appears to have acted in concert with the aboriginal inhabitants, whom the author styles ' Shiaahs,' probably because most of them, owing to the repeated occupation of the island by the Persians, belonged to that sect. The el-'Uttub, however, i See Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. pp. 248-250,AND ANALYSIS. Ivii succeeded shortly after in expelling Siilim, Sultan's eldest son, whom he had made governor over the place, together with all his adherents. They then fell on the inhabitants, ' seized their property, killed a great many of them, obliged numbers to flee into other countries, and treated those who remained on the island with every species of outrage and indignity.' The Benu-Naim and Kutb, and their confederates the Benu-Yas, tribes occupying the northern littoral, now threat ened Sohar, then in the hands of Kais, who thereupon in voked the assistance of his brother Sultan. On the arrival of the latter, however, fearing lest his cooperation might be purchased at the expense of his own position at Sohar, Kais attempted to buy off the invaders. This offer having been rejected, the army of the two brothers attacked the Arabs at a place called ed-Dabbagh, and utterly routed them. A new and far more formidable enemy now appeared on the horizon of 'Oman. Muhammad -ibn-'Abdu-'l-WaVhab, the famous apostle of the sect still called by his name, was dead, as was also Suud II, his first patron and the successful defender and propagator of his doctrines throughout ISejd. ' Before he died,' writes Mr. Palgrave, ' he saw his autho rity acknowledged from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the frontiers of Mecca...But Saood, no less cautious than enterprising, carefully avoided any encroachment on the limits of the great powers in contact with his new empire. The supremacy of Persia in Bahrein, and its protectorate in Kateef, were respected by the Nejdean; Ebn-Saeed, 1 the monarch or sultan of Oman, could complain of no aggres sion, nor had the sacred frontiers of the Meccan Haram been as yet violated, or any risk incurred of Turkish and Egyptian animosity.' On his death, about a.d . IbOO, he 1 Su'ud reigned during the Imamates of Ahmed-bin-Sa'id and his son Sa'id-bin-Ahmed, not u Ebn-Sa'eod,' as here stated.Iviii INTUODUCTION was succeeded by his son ^Abdu-'l-'Aziz, who, ' restless aud bold, but much less prudent than his father, at once turned his arms against the east, stormed Kateef, where he made great slaughter of the inhabitants, occupied Bahrein and the adjacent islands of the Persian Gulf, attacked the eastern coast or Barr-Faris, which he detached irrecover ably from Persian rule, and lastly, assailed the kingdom of 'Oman.' 1 The first intimation of his designs against the latter country was a summons to submission, conveyed through a book or pamphlet, ascribed to Muhammad-ibn- ^Abdu-'l-Wahhab, setting forth the peculiar doctrines of the Wahhabis, a copy of which appears to have been sent to all the local governors. This was followed up by the dispatch of seven hundred cavalry under el-Harik, a Nubian slave, who succeeded in reducing most of the northern tribes, including those of ezh-Zhahirah, from all of whom ho levied Zakdt, making el-Bereimy his head-quarters, from whence also he made frequent inroads into el-Batinah. Moreover, the el- ^Uttub of el-Bahrein are said to have conformed to the new creed, and entered into an alliance with the Wahhabis, under whose countenance and support they took to piracy on the sea, ' seizing every ship that fell in their way.' 'Oman proper, however, was so little disconcerted by these en croachments, that Sultan engaged in a conflict with the el- Ghafiry, who still held Yabrin, in consequence of his brother- in-law, who belonged to that tribe, having refused to transfer to him the property of his deceased wife. This incidental notice shows that the regent, following the example of his father, the Imam Ahmed, (p. 183), had endeavoured to strengthen his position by a matrimonial alliance with his most powerful rivals in 'Oman. The attempt on his part to coerce them was unsuccessful, for although he managed by one of his usual stratagems to get a brasier, during the absence of the garrison, to disable a gun of formidable dimensions which 1 Cent, and East. Arabia, jOiLAi, p. 39. 2 Id., p. 40.AND ANALYSIS. lix defended the fort of Yabrin, the fort itself, deemed impreg nable, held out against him. In spite, however, of the petty wars to which this imprudent enterprise gave rise between the el-Ghafiry and the allies of the Al-Bu-Said, Sultan deemed the country sufficiently tranquil to permit his per formance of the Hijj. He accordingly set out for Mekkah, a.d . 1803, accompanied by a train of 'Omany notables. During his absence, his nephew Bedr, the son of his de ceased brother Seif, conspired with Majid-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil at Maskat, to seize the eastern fort; but the slave in command refusing their admittance, Bedr fled first to 'Aj- man, where he was hospitably entertained by the sheikh of the Benu-Naim, and from thence to ed-Dir'iyyah, the capital of 'Abdu-VAziz, where he took up his abode. - This step, as Sultan remarked on his return, boded no good to the people of 'Oman. One of the conspirators was seized, starved to death in the western fort, and then thrown into the sea. Sultan's fears were soon realized, for a party of the Nejd cavalry, accompanied by levies from their allies in ezh-Zha- hirah, shortly after attacked es-Suwaik,—next to Sohar the largest town on the coast above Maskat,—and nearly exter minated the force sent to repel them, including their com mander, Muhammad-bin-H&amp;med. It became evident now that the Wahhabis were bent on further conquest, and that nothing less than a combined effort on the part of the 'Oma- nis could arrest their onward progress. In this emergency Sultan took counsel of the el-1 aaruby governor of Nakhl, who advised him to assemble all the chiefs of Oman to a conference on the subject. The council, which was held at Barkah, was attended by Sultan's brothers, 1 alib and Mu hammad, two of his nephews, Ahmed the son of the reigning Imam, and other prominent members of the Al-Bu-baid, besides several representatives of the el-\ aarubah and other 'Omany tribes. Sultan opened the proceedings by brieflyhi! ■W m il: i. Ix introduction describing the critical situation of the country, and then called upon those present to express their opinion as to the policy which should be adopted. ' If you fancy,' said one of his nephews in reply, after the address had been repeated a second time, ' that, since the death of Muhammad-bin- Hamed, el-Wahiby, and his followers, there are none left in ^Oinan brave enough to contend against these Nejdy enemies, our opinion differs from yours, for there can be no doubt that ^Oman still possesses men who are stronger than they are, more numerous, and more indomitable in war. We are not dispirited on account of the Wahhabis, or any other possible enemies, for we have hearts in our breasts ready to encounter them, and the swords are on our shoulders with which we are ready to smite them. Blood is man's only dye, and war, like the manna and quails, is as food to us. But words are vain unless followed by deeds ; therefore let the Wahhabis and their allies prepare for the overthrow which awaits them.' This patriotic sentiment having been concurred in by all present, a resolution was adopted for a general levy of the tribes, who were to assemble as soon as practicable at el-Khaburah, from whence Sultan marched some time after at the head of twelve thousand men. El- Harik, on hearing of their approach, suddenly broke up his encampment at el-Auhy, not far from Sohar, and set out for el-Bereimy, from whence he returned to Nejd. The re treat of the Wahhabis led to a reconciliation between the el-'Uttub and Sultan, and relieved 'Oman for a time from any apprehension of a new invasion from Nejd. Sultan took advantage of this interval of peace to visit el-Basrah, in order to receive the annual gratuity awarded to the ruler of 'Oman, in recognition of the services ren dered to that city when it was besieged by the Persians, (pp. 169, 170). On the way back, and while off Linjah on the Persian mainland, he left his frigate and embarked on board the ship's yacht, apparently intending to go to Bun-and analysis. Ixi der-el-'Abbas, through Clarence's Strait. About midnight he was hailed by three boats belonging to the esh-Shuaihiy- yin, a tribe occupying the country near Cape Musandim, who were on the look out for him. Boldly accepting their challenge to fight, it was agreed that the engagement should be deferred till daylight, and both parties accordingly lay to for the night. During the contest, which began at dawn the following morning. Sultan is said to have performed prodigies of valour, and his opponents were in the act of moving off, when one of their number shot him with a musket, killing him on the spot. This encounter occurred on the 20th of November, 1804. The crew of the yacht, after being plundered by the pirates, conveyed the body to Linjah, where it was buried ; after which they sailed for Mdskat, but when off Barkah one of Sultan's slaves swam to shore and communicated the intelligence to his master's family at el-Fulaij, their country residence. Those present on the occasion were the Seyyidah, Sultan's sister, and his sons, Salim and Siiid. The two latter immediately set out for Maskat, which by this time had wholly eclipsed er-Ras- tak as the capital of the kingdom, and quietly took posses sion of its fortifications. The news of their father's death caused universal sorrow throughout 'Oman, and convulsed the entire population with sadness.' The position of the principal parties in the country at this period was as follows:—the Imam Said was still alive at er-Ilastak, seemingly deprived of any authority beyond that town ; Kais, Sultan's brother, held Sohar ; Muhammad, another brother, was master of es-Suwaik ; their nephews, Ahmed and 'Aly, were waiting upon events ; Bedr, another nephew, who had taken refuge with 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, the Wahhaby Amir, was either in Nejd or on his way back to 'Oman; the powerful Khalfan family were ready to seize any opportunity for regaining their former position ; the el- Yaarubah at Nakhl and the el-Ghafiry at Yabrin still held&gt;. . Ixil introduction those important fortresses, and were virtually independent; the other ^Oniany tribes, as we shall see presently, were di vided in their allegiance, some siding with Salim and Said, others with their uncle Kais, whilst others again aimed at if'!*;.] !!'f If 11 iji.'ii ji self-government, or were prepared to sell their support to the highest bidder. The Wahhabis of Nejd garrisoned el- Bereimy, from whence they overawed the population of ezh- Zhahirah, and also the Arabs on the northern coast. During the regency of the Seyyid Sultan, Sharbar, on the coast of Mekran, had been annexed to 'Oman. He also captured the islands of el-Kishm and Hormuz from the el- Mam Arabs, and Linjah, on the southern mainland of Persia, appears to have recognized his supremacy. From the tenor of the treaty made with him by the Honourable East India Company, (see p. Ivi), it is clear that he held Gombroon, now Bunder-el-'Abbas, and exercised sovereign rights there. With regard to 'Omany conquests on the east coast of Africa, it is to be regretted that, thus far, our author . supplies but very meagre information. We know, how ever, from other sources, that the island of Zanzibar sub mitted to an expedition dispatched by the Imam Said-bin- Ahmed, Sultan's brother, a.d. 1 784, prior to the regency of Sultan. Mombasah, on the coast, had thrown off its alle giance to 'Oman during the administration of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, and it appears that Hamed, whom Sultan succeeded in the regency, was bent on recovering it; but it was not finally annexed until the reign of the late Seyyid Said, who captured it, together with the other ports and islands in that quarter, which at present form the indepen dent Zanzibar principality. On the death of Sultan, his two sons, Salim and Said, ruled conjointly, although, owing to the influence of the Seyyidah, their aunt, who appears to have taken a promi nent part in public affairs, Salim acquiesced in the prece dence of his younger brother. The Imamate being still v!' Is. I mand analysis. Ixiii occupied by their uncle Said, neither of them could aspire to the dignity of Imam; but that distinction had evidently lost much of its importance since their cousin Hamed and their father Sultan had exercised supreme civil and political authority, as regents, with the less imposing title of ' Sey- yids.' Knowing, however, that with several rivals to oppose them, and so many factions in the country, a general elec tion, even to the regency, was impracticable, the two brothers lost no time in summoning to Maskat such of the chiefs as were friendly to their claims. These having so lemnly engaged to aid the Seyyid Said against all who should oppose his rule, the new regent forthwith assumed the reins of government. The author devotes a separate chapter to a short bio graphy of the Seyyid Salim, who appears to have lived on the most affectionate terms with his brother, and to have cooperated heartily with him in all his undertakings. His character was a singular mixture of bravery and cowardice, tolerance and fanaticism, piety and superstition, combined with social qualities of extreme gentleness and urbanity. The most interesting part of the chapter is the narrative of a learned exile from el-Hasa, who had been summoned, to gether with several of his fellow-townsmen, to appear before 'Abdul-^l-'Aziz, the Wahhaby Amir, at ed-Dir'iyyah. His account of Wahhabeeism, albeit coming from a hostile wit ness, brings out into prominent relief the one grand idea which pervades the system. Muhammad-ibn-^Abdu-'l-Wah- hab, its founder, was not an innovator but a reformer, whose aim was the restoration of Islam to its primitive purity and simplicity, by insisting that its fundamental dogma, ' there is no deity but God,' absolutely forbade all veneration to man,—prophet or apostle, living or dead,—however highly distinguished by the Divine favour. 1 There can be no doubt 1 Contrasting the practice of Islam in these days with the pure Deism inculcated by the Kur&amp;n, Sir John Malcolm justly remarks:— u TheIxiv introduction that beyond this utter exclusion of human merit, the formula, as originally proclaimed by Muhammad, implied the doctrine of the absolute sovereignty of God in a sense which reduced all created beings to a mass of unconditional passiveness. 1 The great Wahhaby appears to have grasped this theory, but it is highly probable that his efforts to explain it only added to its abstruseness,thereby giving some colour to the charge bi'ought against his writings by the orthodox, that they con sisted chiefly of ' sophisms and speculations/' It is equally reasonable to suppose that a very limited number of his dis ciples were capable of appreciating the more recondite views which his power of abstraction enabled him individually to entertain of the nature and attributes of the Supreme Being. Less difficult of general comprehension, however, was that part of his system which denounced all honours paid to saints and tombs as heretical innovations, detracting from the wor ship due solely to the Creator, and therefore to be regarded and dealt with as idolatrous. To say nothing of Pagans and Christians, whom all Muslims hold to be Polytheists, the followers of the Prophet of Arabia have relaxed from the principles of their religion, and have granted a species of adoration not only to him and his immediate descendants, but to a number of learned or pious men, who have been canonized as saints. The feelings of gratitude and veneration which the conduct of individuals first created has grown—by excessive indulgence and by the ardour of passions excited by contrary opinions—into sacred reverence and devotion. Their very garments have become relics of inestimable value; and in the course of time the same properties have been assigned to them as are supposed to have be longed to their possessors.' From this common progress of superstition hardly one of the numerous sects into which the Muhammedan religion is divided can be deemed exempt. By way of illustration, the author in an appended note refers to the 'incredible veneration paid to the early martyrs and confessors by their pious contemporaries' as having been the cause of many evils in the Christian Church. The parallel holds good still. History of Persia, vol. ii, pp. 377-8. 1 See page 248. For a splendid dissertation on the full import of the symbol of Islam, see I'algrave's Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. i. pp. 365-373.and analysis. Ixv doctrine thus revived placed Sunnis and Shiaahs, Ibadhiyah and Rafidhis alike in the same category, and moreover sanc tioned their being dealt with as such, despite their negation of any deity save one by a strict adherence to the orthodox formula. Hence it was that ' they legalized the despoiling of the Muslims, taking their wives in marriage before they are legally divorced from their husbands, and without observ ing the 'Iddah, and also the enslavement of their children,' (pp. 246-6). All these outrages, from the Wahhaby stand point, were solemn duties imposed upon them by their obli gations to God and Islam, which they could not forego with out risking their own salvation. It is quite conceivable that Muhammad-ibn-'Abdu-' 1 -Wahhab was personally uninflu enced in his fanaticism by any motives of temporal interest; but there can be little doubt that the majority of his fol lowers were actuated as much by the license which his doc trines warranted, as by zeal for what they were taught to consider the true faith. Wahhabeeism, in fact, apart from certain speculative notions respecting the Supreme Being, —in the main perfectly in accordance with the theology of the Kuran,—may be defined as a politico-religious confede racy, which legalizes the indiscriminate plunder and thraldom of all peoples beyond its own pale. This description of its most prominent characteristics is fully borne out by the in tolerant proceedings of its adherents, not only in Nejd, but wherever they succeeded in establishing their ascendancy. Incidentally, the Exile's narrative makes us acquainted with a novel pretension of the Wahhabis, who profess to be in possession of certain portions of the Kuran which the Khalifah 'Othman, out of envy, as they allege, omitted from the original version—compiled during the Khalifate of Abu- Bekr—when he caused a copy of the same to be taken which, by his authority, was made to supersede all other exemplars then extant (p. 252). It is very unlikely that this assertion rests upon any reliable basis, and the suspicion which it casts hIxvi introduction upon the existing canon is probably a mere artifice to per plex or to seduce the orthodox. The fact that the alleged abscissions are communicated only to members of the con federation and to converts seems to favour this hypothesis. The repeated invasions of 'Oman by the Wahhabis during the administration of the Seyyid Said, whereby they reduced the principality to the verge of ruin, withdrawing eventually from the country only on condition that an annual tribute, in the shape of Zakdt, or obligatory alms for pious purposes, should be paid to their Amir, will be noticed in the sequel. For the present we must revert to the Seyyid Said, whom we left at Maskat, just after his partial election to the regency. He had not been long in power when a conspiracy was formed against him, mainly at the instigation of Muhammad- bin-Khalfan, the ex-Wakil of Maskat, the ostensible object of which was to raise the Seyyid Kais, of Sohar, Said's uncle, to the regency. Both parties lost no time in summoning their respective adherents and allies for the approaching con test. The Al-Bu-Said sided generally with Kais, as did also his brothers, the Imam Said of er-Rastak, and Muhammad of Su- waik, and other members of the Seyyid family. The Seyyid Said applied for assistance to Muhenna-bin-Muhammad, the head of the el-Yaarubah, who, besides promising his own co operation, dispatched his brothers to enlist the el-Ghafiry and the northern Arabs in the same cause. But before the expected levies arrived Kais had moved forward with his army, seized el-Khaburah and es-Slb, and driven the enemy's outposts into Maskat. In this emergency the Seyyid Salim took ship to Barkah and returned with Muhenna-el-Yaaruby, who had already thrown fifty of his men into the fort of Barkah, and now brought one hundred men to aid in the defence of Maskat, the entire management of which appears to have been confided to him. After posting the different contingents which subsequently arrived so as to command the heights and other approaches, Muhenna assembled aAND ANALYSIS. Ixvii council of the chiefs, at which it was resolved that a recon ciliation should be attempted between Kais and his nephews Salim and Said, on these conditions :—Kais was to retain the two forts which he had already captured, and to receive besides a monthly allowance of 2,000 dollars. This offer having been rejected by Kais, hostilities were resumed, the assailants making frequent raids in the vicinity of the town, the besieged occasionally issuing forth to repulse them. A messenger was now dispatched by the Seyyidah to Bedr- bin-Seif, who was then in Katar (see note, p. 237), soliciting his presence. He immediately set' out for Maskat, and on his arrival the two Seyyids and the Seyyidah surrendered the entire management of affairs into his hands. Bedr then took up his residence in the fort at Barkah, where he was soon after joined by large levies from the tribes of ezh-Zhahirah, who, as already mentioned, were mostly under Wahhaby influence, and therefore more disposed to cooperate with Bedr, whose Wahhaby proclivities were notorious. However, he lost no time in forwarding these reinforcements to Muhenna to aid in the defence of Mdskat. The arrival at Barkah of 7,000 of the Nizariyyah, under the command of Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, ostensibly to support Bedr and his cousins, induced Kais to propose a reconciliation with his nephews. It was accordingly agreed that he should continue to hold the forts of es-Sib and el- Khaburah, but should withdraw from el Mdtrah and return to Sohar. This amicable arrangement was greatly promoted by Muhenna, who appears to have acted with exemplary loyalty to the cause which he had espoused. Moreover, having been apprised that a secret understanding existed between the el-Ghafiry auxiliaries and their kinsmen the el- Kawasim to seize Maskat, in the event of the former being admitted into that town, he was most anxious to get rid of their presence. The fact that the Seyyids Salim and Said felt bound, in dispensing with their services, to send theinIxviii INTRODUCTION 40,000 dollars and other rich presents, shows that the el- Ghafiry tribes were practically independent. Muhenna's devotion to the Seyyids Salim and Said had excited the jealousy of their elder cousin, Bedr, who, as we have seen, had been entrusted with the administration of affairs in their behalf. Despairing of compassing his ends in any other way, he employed an assassin to murder him in his own castle, after his return to Nakhl. 1 recedents without number justified the atrocity, and the law was powerless against a prince of the blood, Iwen his cousins were obliged to dissemble their resentment against the murderer of their most disinterested champion, whose re moval encouraged Kais to recommence hostilities against his nephews. After capturing the town of Maskat and overrunning the neighbourhood, he was induced, chielly through the intervention of his sister, the Seyyidah, to withdraw to Sohar, but not before he had stipulated for the cession to him of the fort of el-Matrah, and a monthly sti pend of one thousand dollars. The peace thus concluded, however, was of short duration. Instigated by an influential member of the Al-Bu-Said family, the three cousins, Bedr, Salim, and Said, decided to make war upon their uncle Kais. Among the numerous levies which they raised on this occasion were contingents sent by the Wahhabis, the Benu-Yas and other northern Arabs, and also by the brothers of the reigning Imam, Said-bin-Ahmed, their uncle. They also forwarded a large sum of money to secure the cooperation of the el-Ghanry tribe. Kais com menced hostilities by a vigorous attack on Maskat, which was ably defended by Bedr and his auxiliaries, but notwith standing that he had been reinforced by seven hundred of the Benu-^Uttub he was unable to gain any advantage over the assailants. The Seyyid Said, on the other hand, was joined at Barkah by 12,000 men from ezh-Zhahirah, under the command of Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry. Marchingand analysis. Ixix with these he first captured es-Sib and then Badbad, from whence he wrote to Bedr, expostulating with him on his in activity. Bedr, in the meantime, having received additional reinforcements from the Wahhabis, the Benu-'Uttub, and the Benu-Yas, began to act on the offensive, and succeeded in dislodging the enemy from the posts which they had occu pied in the vicinity of Maskat. As he was further preparing to storm el-Matrah, Kais sued for peace, and a reconcilia tion was negotiated between the nephews and their uncle, on condition that the latter should surrender el-Matrah to them. On the return of Kais to Sdhar, the Seyyid Said dis missed his northern auxiliaries, presenting Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, their principal leader, with another sum of 40,000 dollars for his services. Not long after, hostilities were renewed against Kais, chiefly at the instigation of his nephew Bedr. This time it was agreed that Behla, the principal stronghold in 'Oman proper, then held by Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, Kais's brother and firm ally, should be the first point of attack. The el- Yaarubah of Nakhl were accordingly directed to march upon the place, Bedr and his cousins supplying them with arms and ammunition, and summoning their adherents among the neighbouring tribes to cooperate with them. Bedr himself proceeded to el-Khaburah, then held by Kais, where he was joined by the Arabs of the coast, and also by Hamid-bin- Nasir, el-Ghafiry, whose aid had again been invoked, and who came accompanied by a number of Wahhabis and a general levy of the Nizariyyah of ezh-Zhahirah. Hamid, how ever, secretly deprecated Bedr^s success against his uncle, fearing that he might acquire thereby a dangerous predomi nance over 'Oman, especially as the Wahhabis were devoted to his interests. He accordingly suggested that an effort should be made, in the first iustance, to induce Kais to sur render the coveted fortress, and having obtained Bedr's con sent to the proposal he set out for Sohar, with most of hisIxx introduction followers, leaving only the Benu-Kelban contingent at el- Khaburah. During his absence an affray, which ended in bloodshed, took place in the encampment, between the el- Harth and the el-Janibah. As the latter had come with Hamid, and were worsted in the encounter, he recalled his confederates from before el-Khaburah, and returned to his district in high dudgeon. The failure of the Seyyid Said's attempt against el- Khaburah was counterbalanced by the acquisition of the fortress of Behla, which his uncle Muhammed, for the sake of promoting peace, voluntarily made over to his former ally, Mdlik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby. Malik placed it in the temporary charge of Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, another chief of the same tribe, while he went to his A\aliship at iSaklil ; but, on his return, Muhammad-bin-Suleiman refused to admit him into the fort, and retained possession of it himself, professedly on behalf of the Seyyid Said. Kais, on the other hand, made a demonstration against Yabnn and Nezwa, but was foiled by Hamid-bin-Nasir. In order to put an end to the intes tine feuds in that quarter, Muhammad-bin-el-Imam eventu ally surrendered Nezwa to his nephew, the Seyyid Said. The Seyyid Said's suspicions of the designs of his cousin Bedr, and more especially the intimate relations which he had established with the Wahhabis, led him to compass his de struction, in concert with Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, whom alone he took into his confidence. He accordingly suggested another attack on el-Khaburah, on the under standing that neither the Wahhabis nor the people of ezh- Zhahirah should take any part in it. When the other tribes had assembled at Nuaman, near Barkah, the Seyyid Said and Bedr entered the fort, accompanied by several chiefs, while Muhammad-bin-Nasir took up a position near the entrance. The company being seated, the subject of arms was brought under discussion, during which the Maula, or lord, of the cl- Jibilr, evidently with a view to disarm him, drew Bedr'sand analysis. Ixxi dagger from its sheath, whereupon Said aimed a blow at him with his sword and broke his arm. Bedr threw himself out of the window, and called out for help, but Muhammad-bin- Nasir forbade any to interfere. Thereupon Bedr mounted his horse and set off at full gallop, pursued by his cousin Said and a troop of horsemen, who, finding that the fugitive had fallen to the ground through loss of blood, speedily dis patched him with their lances. As in the case of a similar atrocity perpetrated by Bedr, (see p. 291), so in this, the assassin of his cousin was lauded rather than reprobated for his crime. The murder led to a reconciliation between the murderer and his uncle Kais, who hated Bedr for having seceded from the tenets of the el-Ibadhiyah and embraced those of the Wahhabis. A year later Said and Kais attacked Fakkan, which had become a refuge for pirates acting under the order of Sultan- bin-S&amp;kar, el-Kasimy. In the engagement which ensued the forces of the Seyyids were utterly routed and most of them slain; among the latter was the Seyyid Kais, upon whose death his son 'Azzan appears to have succeeded to the appanage of Sohar as a matter of course. At his request, however, the Seyyid Said covenanted to defend him against all his enemies. The reciprocal obligations in this treaty are not stated ; but it is clear from the sequel that thencefor ward the Seyyid Said exercised greater authority over that district than he had ventured to claim during the lifetime of his uncle Kais. The next object of the Regent's suspicion was his late accomplice, Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, who held the important fortresses of Badbad and Semail. These he obliged him to surrender, after obtaining possession of his person by treachery; but the perfidy was doomed to a com mensurate retribution. Muhammad made his escape to el- 'Ainein, where he was well received by Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, who placed the fort of Azka at his disposal.Ixxii introduction From thence he proceeded to ed-Dir^iyyah, to solicit the aid of Suud-bin-'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, 1 who had succeeded his father as Arair of the Wahhabis. Suud, nothing loth to interfere in the affairs of 'Oman, forthwith dispatched a force under Mutlak-el-Mutairy to aid Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and to re duce the country to his, Silud's, obedience. On his arrival at el-Bereimy, Mutlak levied all the northern Arabs and at tacked and captured the fort of Shinas, situated about thirty miles to the north-west of Sohar. His next move was upon Sohar itself, in which he was joined by Hamid-bin-Nasir, el- Ghafiry, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, with their re spective followings. 'Azzan-bin-Kais being ill with small pox at the time, his cousin, the Seyyid Said, undertook the defence of the place. Unable to force an entrance into Sohar, Mutlak's forces marched along the coast and turned off at el-Masnaah, towards the Wadi of the el-Maawal, plundering the country on their way. At this time the confederates were joined by Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, so that the Wahhabis, the el-Ghafiry, the el-Yaarubah, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir, the ex-Wali of Semail, were now arrayed against the Seyyids. Proceeding onwards towards the latter place, the combined armies took posses sion of all the hill-towers, or Hujrahs, commanding the valley, when Mutlak left for el-Bereimy, and Hamld-bin- Nasir for el-^Ainein, leaving Muhammad-bin-Nasir to invest and reduce the forts. The Seyyid Said made the most strenuous efforts to sustain the Beloochee garrison and to harass the enemy, calling in the aid of his cousin 'Azzan and his adherents from all parts. He even proposed a re conciliation with Muhammad-bin-Nasir, at any sacrifice short of the surrender of the forts of Badbad and Semail; but the latter persisted in carrying on the siege until the brave Beloochee commander was obliged to capitulate. This The second Wahhdhy Amir of that name; (Su'ud I. was not a ^ ah- hTibv^; he is omitted in Mr. Palgrave's list of the dynasty; see note, p. 345-6.and analysis. Ixxm unfortunate man, together with the captain over the slaves, was cast into prison at Maskat, and both were kept there till they died. Despairing of success against the formidable confederacy which beset him on all sides, the Regent dispatched his brother, the Seyyid Salim, with a suitable retinue, to solicit the aid of Fath-'Aly-Shah, then (about a.d . 1809) urgently pressed with applications from the ambassadors of France and England, who sought his cooperation, the one in favour of, and the other against, the threatened invasion of India by Buonaparte. The account given at pp. 306—314 of this embassy to Shiraz,—the light which it incidentally throws on the manners of the Persian court; the intrigues of the fanatical Shiaah-Mirza appointed to attend upon the ^Omany visitors to thwart their object; the discussion on the rela tive orthodoxy of the Shiaah and Ibadhiyah creeds which took place between the said Mirza and a shrewd Kadhi in the suite of the Seyyid Salim ; and the thorough oriental versatility of the latter as a diplomatist,—all these incidents are narrated with a charming simplicity, and will amply re pay a careful perusal. Salim's request for 3,000 horsemen, to be paid, provisioned, and armed at the expense of the 'Omany state, was acceded to by the Shah, and in due course this cavalry contingent was safely transported from Bunder- el-'Abbas, and encamped near the fort of Barkah, on the el- Batinah coast, about forty-five miles to the westward of Maskat. Both parties now prepared for the coming struggle : Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, set out from Semriil to raise levies from his confederates in the north, while the Seyyid Salim, taking the Persians with him, invested and captured Nakhl. Being subsequently reinforced by his cousin ^zzan- bin-Kais and his uncle Talib, with their respective followers, he proceeded next to Semail, which surrendered at discre tion. Intelligence of the loss of his fort reaching Muham- ll xx i v INTRODUCTION mad-bin-Nasir, he started in quest of Mutlak-el-Mutairy, and overtook him on the borders of the Benu-Yas territory, on his way to Nejd. By dint of remonstrances, and the offer of a large bribe, he induced the Wahhaby commander to accompany him back to his fort at Azka, (p. 297), where, through MutlaVs influence, he was joined by a considerable number of men from the tribes of ezh -Zhahirah and esh- Shamal, and marching out from thence they fell upon the Persians and Arabs under the Seyyid Salim and utterly routed them. Following up this advantage, the victors laid waste the Wadi of the Benu-Ruwahah, and on his return to el-Bereimy, Mutlak conferred upon Muhammad the district of Semed-el-Kindy, near Nezwa. At el-Bereimy, Mutlak found Turky and Faisal, the sons of Suud, 1 the Wahhaby Amir, who had come thither with a band of followers from el-Hasa and el-Kasim, without their fathers permission. Mutlak having surrendered his com mand to them they commenced levying the adjacent tribes, and attacked the el-Khadhra, but were repulsed with loss. On hearing of this check, Mutlak rejoined them, and having summoned the Benu-Naim and Kutb jo his standard, and called upon Muhammad-bin-Nasir to join him without delay, he marched down towards the coast. At Qarkah lie encoun tered the Seyyid Salim and his Persian cavalry, and a de sultory engagement followed, which lasted for three days, without any decisive advantage to either side. Massing on ward, the Wahhabis and their confederates plundered el- Matrah and Arbak, and, masking Maskat, forced their way over the mountains as far as Sur and Ras -el-Hadd, razing the towers, ravaging the country, burning the shipping, and levying large sums of money from the inhabitants. The raid over, Miitlak-el-Mutairy returned to el-Bereimy. We now come to the first instance of British armed inter vention, in conjunction with the Seyyid Said, in the affairs 1 See p. 318, and note 3, p. 345.and analysis. Ixxv of ^Oman. At the instigation of the Wahhabis, the el-Ka- wasim, (Joasmees), under their chief Hasan-bin-Rahmah, had extended their piracies to the coast of western India. Determined to suppress these outrages, and also to relieve the Seyyid Said from the power of the Wahhabis, the Go vernment of India ordered an expedition to be sent to the Persian Gulf. Their first operations were directed against Ras-el-Khaimah, which appears to be the modem name of Julfar. 1 The attack commenced by a bombardment on the 12th of November, 1809, which was repeated on the following day, when a breach having been made in the castle the assailants ' rushed in, drove away the garrison, plundered the houses, burnt the shipping, carried away a large booty, and took Hasan-bin-Rahmah prisoner.' Meanwhile, Mutlak-el-Mutairy continued his depredations upon the territory of Sohar, in conjunction with one Mu hammad-bin-Ahmed, who held the fort of Shinas. The Seyyid Said having requested the cooperation of the English to reduce that place also, the combined forces arrived there on the 31st of December, 1810, and captured it the day fol lowing, after an heroic resistance. According to the native account, Muhammad started for el-Bereimy, as soon as the bombardment began, to invoke the aid of Mutlak, and re turned with a body of Wahhabis, but was unable to break through the investing force, and died suddenly the same night. It appears, further, that after the English had re- embarked, having made over the battered fort to the Seyyid Said, they warned him, and his brother Salim, and his cousin ^Azzan, of Sohar, to re-embark also, as they had seen 'dust in the air in small clouds.' This proved to be the advance of Mutlak with a large army, which fell upon the troops of the Seyyids, killed many of them, and put the remainder to flight, the Seyyids escaping to el-Masnaah, mounted on fleet horses, under cover of a dust-storm. It seems probable 1 See note, p. 322.Ixxvi introduction that the English ships had sailed before this attack was made. Thus far, British intervention had only tended to exasperate the Wahhabis. Another cause of irritation with them was the reinstatement of Sultan-bin-Sakar as chief over the cl- Kawasim at Ras -el-Khaimah. Sultan had been the ally ol the Amir Suud-bin-'Abdu-'l-Aziz for some time, but had since retired from the Wahhaby confederacy and engaged to support the Seyyid Said. As he promised to restrain his people from piracy, his restoration was approved of by the English, who gave him much money, directed him to re build Julfar, and enjoined him to adhere to his resolve of abandoning his former malpractices.' Eully bent on the subjugation of 'Oman, Mutlak-el-Mu- tairy collected an overwhelming force from the northern tribes, summoned Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, and lla- mid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, to join him, and marched to el- Masnaah, on the coast. In anticipation of the impending invasion the Seyyid Said had appealed to the British Go vernment for assistance, urging that his cooperation with us in the late expedition had involved him in perpetual war fare with the Wahabee chief. The supreme Government, however, considered it impracticable to render any assist ance, without making it appear that we were united in a contest with the Wahabee power, which was contrary to our repeatedly declared policy.' 1 Thus left to themselves, the Seyyids saw no chance of successfully resisting Mutlak s demands. Accordingly, 'Azzan-bin-Kais, his uncle Muham mad, and Ahmed acting on behalf of his father, the Imam Said, of er-Rastak, forthwith came to terms with him. On hearing of their submission, the Seyyid Said, alone and unarmed, suddenly presented himself before Mutlak, at el- Masnaah, when it was agreed that the latter should cease from 1 Otlicial Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wa habee Power, p. 4.and analysis. Ixxvii injuring any of the Seyyid^s people. On Mutlak's return to el- Bereimy, the Seyyid Said made him a 'present' of 40,000 dollars, but it seems highly probable, from certain statements made in the sequel, that this sum was paid as Zahdk, or obli gatory alms for religious purposes, and that it was stipulated on the same occasion what amount of such tribute should be paid annually by 'Azzan-bin-Kais for Sohar, and by the Seyyid Said for the remainder of 'Oman. This treaty ap pears to have been made about the middle of a.d. 1810. Ibn-^Azdakah, who was shortly after appointed Wahhaby agent in 'Oman, having been murdered on the way by the Benu-Yas, Miitlak was ordered to resume the office. On his arrival at el-Bereimy, however, he found most of the northern tribes backward to join him, 'chiefly owing to the large demands which had already been made upon them for wars and invasions/' In his attempt to reduce the el-Ha- jariyyin to obedience, he was shot by one of that tribe, and his brother, Battal-el-Mutairy, having communicated the intelligence of his death to Suud 1 -bin-'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, the Wahhaby Amir, Ibn-Mazrua was selected to succeed him, who on reaching el-Bereimy levied the tribes of that district and moved to Behla, with the intention of proceeding against el-Bediyyah. No reason is assigned for this invasion, so soon after the late treaty, but the Seyyid Said marched with an army to oppose it. While encamped, not far from the enemy, a messenger reached him from Maskat, reporting the death of his cousin, ■'Azzan-bin-Kais, at Mokha, in the Red Sea, on his way back from a pilgrimage to Mekkah. It is stated that, prior to his departure, 'Azzan had confided Sohar to one of the Al-Bu-Said, directing him to obey the orders of the Seyyid Said, and in the event of his death to surrender the fortress to-him. Determined, if possible, to be the first on the spot. Said started forthwith, and outstripped his cousin, Ahmed, the son of the Imam Said, who had 1 By an ellipsis, styled simply 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz in the narrative, p. 328.Ixxviii introduction married the daughter of Kais, 'Azzan's father, and who, on hearing of ^Azzan's death, had hurried from er-Rastak to Sohar, in the hope of securing it. Finding the Seyyid Said already in possession he returned to er-Rastak, and from that time forward the Seyyid regarded Sohar as an integral part of his dominions. Since the reign of Ahmed, the first Imam of the Al-Bu-Said, who appears to have conferred it as an appanage upon his third son, Kais,—which gift is ex plicitly stated to have been confirmed by his successor,— the place had virtually become an independent principality, and the Seyyid Said's claim to it, either in virtue of his sovereignty over 'Oman or of 'Azzan's alleged bequest, was fiercely contested by the direct descendants of the latter for many years after. The reverse of fortune which the Nejd government expe rienced in 1813 at the hands of Muhammad-'Aly Pasha, of Egypt, who drove 'Abdallah, the son of the Amir SuAd, out of the Hijaz; the death of Suud himself in 1814; the de struction of ed-Dir'iyyah five years later by the troops under Ibrahim Pasha, when 'Abdallah, who had succeeded his father, was taken prisoner, and subsequently beheaded at Constantinople;—these and other domestic disasters had obliged the Wahhabis to abandon their foreign aggressive policy, and 'Oman was relieved from their exactions for a period of nearly twenty years. During this interval a re conciliation seems to have been effected between the Seyyid Said and Hamid-bin-Nasir, the leading chief of the el-Gha- firy, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, both heretofore the sworn allies of the Wahhabis, and the country enjoyed comparative tranquillity. The el-Yaarubah chiefs made two or three attempts to recover possession of Nakhl, but were foiled rather by the treachery than by the exercise of legiti mate authority on the part of the Seyyid Said. In 1816 he felt sufficiently secure at home to undertake an expedi tion against el-Bahrein, an island which he was bent on re-and analysis. Ixxix annexing to the 'Oraany principality, but he was repulsed by the Benu-^UttAb with great loss, including his younger brother, Hamed-bin-Sultan, and several of his principal officers. It was either immediately before or after the overthrow of 'Abdallah-bin-Sufld, in 1819, that Battal-el-Mutairy came from Nejd to el-Bereimy with a large body of cavalry, in tending probably to assume an independent position at that important frontier fortress. Acting under the orders of the Seyyid Said, Muhammad-bin-Nasir and Suwailim-bin-Salim, the Wali of Nakhl, surrounded the invaders, who not only capitulated and agreed to raze the fort, but also took service with the Seyyid, for we find Battal-el-Mutairy and his fol lowers fighting bravely by his side in the affair of the Benu- Abi-^Aly, which occurred shortly after. In the mean time, as we learn from the cotemporary annals of the Bombay Government, ' a British expedition sailed from Bombay, under the command of General Keir, about the end of 1819, and, with the cooperation of the Imaum of Muscat, [the Seyyid Said], destroyed or captured all the vessels and the principal strongholds of the piratical chief tains. The dread inspired by the success of the British arms in the reduction of Ras-ool-khyma, led to the more powerful Arab sheikhs sending offers of unqualified submis sion to General Keir. On the 8th of January, 1820, a general treaty of peace was concluded with nearly all the chiefs of the maritime Arabs in the Gulf, the provisions of which have since been more or less respected. m British aid, not exclusively on his behalf, was afforded to the Seyyid Said towards the end of the following year. It appears that Muhammad-bin-'Aly, the chief of the Benu- Hdsan and Benu-'Abi-'Aly, two affiliated tribes settled not far from the coast of Jaalan, having abjured the creed of the 1 Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wahahee Power, p. 7.Ixxx introduction Ibadhiyah and adopted Walihaby tenets, had refused to recog nize the Seyyid's authority. Moreover, some of their converts at el-Ashkharah, a large maritime village on the coast below Eas-el-Hadd, had plundered several English ships which were wrecked in their neighbourhood. 1 o punish these outrages, a British force, consisting of six companies of sepoys and eight guns, was landed at Sur, where they were joined by 2,000 Arabs, levied from different tribes, and commanded by the Seyyid Said in person. On the 9th of November, 1820, the combined armies attacked the enemy's position and were utterly routed. Nearly the whole of the British detachment actually engaged was cut up, and the Seyyid Said, who is acknowledged to have displayed great courage on the occasion, was shot through the hand in endeavouring to save an artilleryman. 1 he same night the enemy attempted to surprise the entrenched camp of the British, which led to the flight of most of their Arab allies, none standing by the Seyyid but Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and the Wahhaby, Battal-el-Mutairy. ' Perceiving that the edge of the courage of the English had been blunted, and that their numbers had been greatly reduced, the Seyyid ordered a retreat, and he and the English accordingly returned to Maskat,' on the 17th of November, from whence the latter embarked for Bombay. To vindicate the national character a second expedition, under the command of Sir Lionel Smith, was dispatched to Sur, where it was again joined by the Seyyid Said and his Arab levies, and where they were detained for three days to allow the Seyyid to mourn for his elder brother Salim, the intelligence of whose death reached him at that place. The narrative here apprises us also of the death of the Imam Said, the son of the first Imam of the Al-Bd-Said dynasty, and the Seyyid Said's uncle, which must have oc curred between this time, a.d . 1821, and 1811, at which latter date he was still living, (see notes, pp. 323, 325). His sonand analysis. Ixxxi Ahmed appears to have succeeded him in the government of er-Rastak, but had been treacherously dispossessed by his uncle Talib, whom the Seyyid Said is recorded to have con firmed in the appointmeut on this occasion. The reader will note that, notwithstanding the death of the Imam Said, no member of the Al-Bu-Said, or any other person, was elected to succeed him in the dignity of Imam. His nephew Said, who had been Regent and virtually the exclusive sovereign of ^Oman since the death of his father Sultan, still retained the simple title of 'Seyyid.' The probable reasons for the discontinuance of the Imam ate are discussed in Appendix A. Major-General Sir Lionel Smithes expedition redeemed the prestige of the British. The division under his command stormed the position of the Benu-Abi-'Aly and their allies on the 2nd of March, 1821, killed and wounded five hun dred of the enemy, and took nearly all the remainder prisoners, including Muhammad-bin-'Aly and his brother Khadim-bin-'Aly. The latter died of his wounds on the way to Mdskat, and eighty of the captives carried thither by the Seyyid Said were confined in the eastern battery, 'where they died of starvation.'' On the other hand, Muhammad- bin-'Aly and other prisoners, 'who were taken away by the English, when they reached India, were unbound and well cared for, the wounded received the best professional treat ment, and all lived in great comfort at Bombay.' Moreover, two years later, ' the English permitted Muhammad-bin- 'Aly and his people to return to their homes, and the Go vernor of Bombay gave him much money to enable him to rebuild his town, sent him in an English ship to Mdskat, and w T rote to the Seyyid Said to forgive them. To all which the Seyyid agreed, and they accordingly returned to Jaalan and restored their place to its former state,' (pp. 344-5). About this period, according to our native annalist, Saad- bin-Mutlak was appointed Wahhaby agent in 'Oman by Turky and Faisal, the ' sons of Sund,'' who appear to have inill i ! &gt;*r r.

Mr. Palgrave, however, makes Turky the son and successor of ^Abdallah-bin-Suud, (see note, p. 345), as does also Lieut. Hennell, who, in his paper on the Wahhabis in the Bomhay Government Selections, (Vol. xxiv. p. 437), expressly styles him ' Toorkey-bin-Abdoola, commonly known by the name of Toorkey-bin-Saood.' Tiirky, who had been taken pri soner by Ibrahim Pasha in 1819, effected his escape the year after, and commenced hostilities against the Benu-Khalid, who had been established at el-Hasa and el-Katif by the Egyptians. Before the end of 1824 he succeeded in re capturing Riyadh, and in partially restoring the ascendancy of the Wahhabis. The foregoing circumstances will account for the reoccu- pation of el-Bereimy by Saad -bin-Mutlak, where his autho rity was recognized by a portion of the northern Arabs and by the people of ezh-Zhahirah. Accompanied by some levies of those tribes he marched as far as Behla, and from thence proceeded to attack the el-Hajariyyin, who had slain Ins father in battle some years before, (p. 327). On Ins return to el-Bereimy he rebuilt that fortress, and excused himself to the Seyyid Said for his raid into 'Oman. In 1828 the Seyyid made another attempt to reduce el- Bahrein, and, according to a paragraph in the official Precis already quoted, he invoked the cooperation of the Wahhabis, sending messengers to Riyadh on that errand. Moreover, ' he is alleged, not only to have acknowledged the supremacy of the Wahabee chief, but to have intimated his readiness to pay the Zulcat, or tithe, levied from his followers;' further, that ff the Wahabee chief turned the overtures of the Imaum [the Seyyid Said] to his own account, and offered the Utto- bee chief in possession of Bahrein the alternative of war or submission. The latter was accepted and the whole of the Arabian coast became tributary to the Wahabees in a short time.' No allusion whatever is made in the published i: v:and analysis. Ixxxiii Botuhay Government Selections to any such transactions, and our native historian is equally silent on the subject, although he accurately describes the operations of the Seyyid Said's army, and iinpartially records its ignominious defeat by the Benu-'Uttub. From 1829 to 1844 the Seyyid Said was engaged in con solidating his territories on the east coast of Africa. His first visit to Zanzibar appears to have been made towards the end of the former year, when he accompanied an expedi tion against Mombasah, after the Indian authorities, at his strong remonstrances, had disallowed the convention which Captain Owen of her Majesty's frigate Leven had concluded five years previously with the Arab settlers there, whereby they were placed under British protection. It was not, how ever, until after a third attack that his Highness succeeded in finally subjugating Mombasah by the capture of the lead ing men of the Benu-Mazrua, an 'Omany tribe which had long been in possession of the locality, nominally subject to the sovereign of 'Oman, but virtually independent of his authority. These chiefs were transported to the island of Hormuz, in the Persian Gulf, ' where they subsequently died,' most probably of starvation. The people of Siwy, near Brawa, another strong place on the same coast, ' having broken their engagements,' the Seyyid Said made two attempts to reduce them also, but his troops were driven off on both occasions with great loss, (see pp. 355, 360). Since that period, a.d . 1844, writes Colonel Rigby, peace has been maintained with slight inter ruptions in the Seyyid's East African territories, and has been attended with comparative prosperity. On the other hand, the frequent absence of the Seyyid at Zanzibar, which he eventually made his principal residence, produced a succession of intestine disorders in 'Oman and greatly weakened his authority in that quarter. On his third visit to Zanzibar he appointed his nephew, Muhammad-bin-'.V, ) I III ii'i' !

Not long after, his second cousin, Hamud- bin-'Azzan, whose father had transferred Sohar to the Seyyid Said, (see p. 328), was invited by the inhabitants to seize that place, which he accordingly did, without encountering any opposition on the part of the garrison. Following up this advantage, Hamud successfully attacked Shinas and el- Khaburah, and was only thwarted in his attempt on Mdskat by the opportune arrival there of Muhammad-bin-^Nasir, el- Jabry, with 1,500 of the Isizariyyah of Senuiil, whom he succeeded in throwing into the town at the earnest solici tation of the Seyyid's uncle, Talib-bin-Ahmed, the Wali of er-Rastak, and of the Seyiddah, his great-aunt, who still seems to have exercised considerable influence in the administration. Moreover, Muhammad-bin-ISasir s alliance with the Seyyid induced some of his confederates among the northern tribes to keep Hamiid in check by making in cursions into the territories of Sohar. The Seyyid Said's first act on his return from Zanzibar in 1830, in consequence of these disturbances, was to release his cousin, Hilal-bin-Muhammad, and to restore him to cs- Suwaik. He then assembled a large force and embarked for Sohar intending to attack that fortress, but a reconcilia tion was effected between the two parties, Hamiid having consented to relinquish ' all claim to independent authority over the subjects of the Seyyid Said, and engaged to do nothing without his orders.' According to the English official account of this transaction, the Seyyid ' concluded an agreement with sheikh Humood, by which he ceded to that chief the districts of Khizza, Markies, and Sohar, for the payment of an annual tribute of 8,000 German crowns.and analysts. Ixxxv The towns of Sliinas and Ghillal were restored to liis High ness.' 1 The same authority mentions another attack upon Sohar by the Seyyid Said the year after, aided by the el- Kawasimy chief, Sultan-bin-Sakar, and Rashid-bin-Hamud, of ^Ajman, whom he subsidized on the occasion. He also took steps ' to conciliate the Wahabee chief by sending him large presents, and in some measure acknowledging his supremacy/' This second expedition signally failed, and the loss on the side of the Seyyid was so great that he 'judged it advisable to drop all further proceedings, and having patched up a peace, upon nearly the same terms as the former one, he retired to Muskat with both his finances and reputation, already severely shaken, reduced to a still lower ebb by the last unfortunate attempt. On leaving for Zanzibar the Seyyid appointed his second son, Hilal, as Wali over Maskat, enjoining him to take no important step without consulting his cousin, Muhammad- bin-Salim. In like manner he placed Barkah in the hands of his second cousin, Suud-bin-'Aly-bin-Seif, the great- grandson of the Imam Ahmed. He had not been long absent when Silud treacherously seized Hilal and Muham mad, while on a visit to him at Barkah, proceeded next to invest el-Masnaah, and finally made pi'eparations to attack JMaskat, whereupon the Seyyidah again resorted to the aid of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and eventually obtained the liberation of the Seyyids Hilal and Muhammad by the pay ment of a large ransom. According to the contemporary annals of the Bombay Government the Seyyid Said^s authority in 'Oman at this period was threatened with collapse. Sultan-bin-Sakar, the chief of the el-Kawasim, taking advantage of the intestine disorders in that country, seized Khor-Fakkan, Khallah, and Daba, ports on the el-Batinah coast, and the Seyyids Hamud- bin-'Azzan of Sohar and Hilal-bin-Muhammad of es-Suwaik 1 Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv, pp. 201-2. 2 /(/., p. 202.f vH' ■l} i r ijb .

Under these circumstances the British Grovei'nment lost no time in dispatching a naval force to check the designs of the Seyyid Said's enemies and to afford advice and support to the existing administration ; and it was undoubtedly through this friendly intervention that further disasters were ar rested. 1 On the return of the Seyyid Said to Maskat on the 10th of September, 1832, a compromise was effected through the mediation of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, whereby Suud consented to restore the fort of Barkah to the Seyyid, receiving in its stead the Waliship of er-Rastak, which had become vacant by the death of the Seyyid^s uncle, Tulib-bin-Ahmed. Be fore re-embarking for Zanzibar his Highness appointed his third son, Thuwainy, Wali of Mdskat. Although our author omits all notice of the fact, there can be no doubt that at this period the influence of the Wahhabis was once more in the ascendant. Turky-bin- Suiid, their Amir, having succeeded in re-establishing his power in Nejd, took steps to reassert his claims upon 'Oman, with the concurrence of most of the northern tribes, who were more or less imbued with Wahhabeeism. ' Finding the integrity of his dominions thus seriously menaced, the Imaum [the Seyyid Said] considered it his best policy to form a closer connection with the Wahabee Chief. It was accordingly agreed by him [as stated in a letter written by himself to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 23rd May, 1833] to pay a tribute of 6,000 Grerman crowns per annum to the Wahabee Chief, that each should hold possession of his own coast, according to the limits then existing—the Imaum's [the Seyyid^s] extending to Jaalan and the AV ahabee's to Kateef; and, further, an engagement was entered into, binding them reciprocally to assist in putting 1 Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv, p. 204-6.AND ANALYSIS. Ixxxvii down any rebellion arising in their respective territo ries.' 1 The Seyyid Said had not been long in Zanzibar before he was recalled by fresh disturbances in ^Oman. The Seyyid Suud, his Wali at er-Rastak, having been treacherously murdered while asleep in a mosque by his cousin the Seyyid Sultan, the grandson of the last Imam, Said, doubtless in the hope of succeeding thereby to what he considered his patrimonial inheritance, the Seyyid Hamud-bin-'Azzan, of Sohar, taking advantage of the opportunity, marched thither with a large force and took possession of the place. The Seyyid Said's first attempt to coerce Hamud having failed, he raised large levies and encamped with them at el- Masnaah. Finding, however, that the majority refused to join him in hostilities against Ham{ld, he directed Muham- mad-bin-Nasir to subsidize the northern tribes, and as many as eighty sheikhs, with several thousand followers, hastened to join his standard. Terrified at the Nemesis which he himself had evoked, ' when the Seyyid Said, seated in his ship, descried this immense concourse descending upon Sohar, he began to dread their getting the ascendancy there,' and preferred a reconciliation with Hamud; after which he dismissed the levies, distributing ' thousands of dollars among them, besides robes of honour and other presents.' These events appear to have occurred in 1834, the year in which Turky, the Wahhaby Amir, was assassinated by his cousin Mashary, who usurped the throne until he was slain in turn by Faisal-bin-Tiirky, who thereupon succeeded to the sovereignty. In 1836, according to the Bombay official records, the Seyyid Said made another attempt to coerce Hamud, with the cooperation of Saad-bin-Mutlak, the Wah haby agent in Oman, who joined him with 2,000 men from 1 Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wahabee Power, p. 9.' i- I ♦fT B •' r. tM 1 f ' m ' Dp ■ Mt' •, •• il 'iff; Pi'' ijr'.

The siege, however, was soon aban doned ''in consequence of his Highness having satisfied himself of the truth of a communication made by a deputa tion from the besieged, that Sohar falling, the A\ ahabce agent intended retaining possession of it in the name of his superior, Faisal.' 1 Nevertheless, the native annalist states, that prior to the Seyyid's return to Zanzibar a ship was dis patched by the English Government, the commander of which brought Ham (id to Mdskat, who thereupon gave ' a written promise that he would not stir up strife against the Seyyid or his children, and would abstain from all hostilities against Hilal-bin-Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, of es-Suwaik.' 'Oman was relieved once more, for several years, from the pressure of their dangerous neighbours the AVahhabis, in consequence of the renewed overthrow of their powci by the Egytian troops, who with the assistance of Sheikh Khahd, Faisal's cousin and rival, overran the whole province of Nejd. Faisal surrendered to the Egyptian Commander-in-Chief m 1838, but came back to Riyadh in 1843, and succeeded in re -establishing himself as the legitimate Amir of the AN ah- habis. ' He soon after announced to the inland chiefs of Oman his intention of bringing that province under his authority, a communication which appears to have been generally favourably received by them. He addressed the Resident in the Persian (xulf at the same time, expiossing a desire for a renewal of the amicable relations which existed between his father Toorkee and the British (rovernment. During the aforenamed interval of rest from foreign aggres sion ^Oman was again a prey to internal dissensions. Hamud- bin-'Azzan, then in possession of Sohar and er-Rastak, en couraged by the repulse of the Seyyid Said s expedition 1 Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv, p. 208. 2 Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wahahee Power, pp. 10, 11.and analysis. Ixxxix in 1844, against Sivvy, 'recommenced writing to the Seyyid's subjects, urging them to throw off his authority.' The death, at this juncture, of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, the Seyyid Said's most influential and trusty adherent, removed one of the greatest obstacles which he had to contend with; never theless, considering the friendly support which the British authorities had always accorded to the existing Government, he deemed it prudent to consult them before proceeding to further acts of insubordination, and went himself to Bombay to request that they would abstain from interfering in the dispute betwixt himself and the Seyyid Said. Finding that the English considered him bound by the written promise which he had formerly given, apparently under their cogni zance, 'to relinquish all claim to independent authority,' Hamud returned to Sohar, and for a time lived the life of an ascetic, eventually placing that fortress in the hands of his son, Seif-bin-Hamud. At this period an abortive attempt was made by the heads of the Al-Bu-Said ' to set up an Imam of their own, who was to be invested with supreme authority,' or, in other words, to re-establish the Imamate, which had been in abey ance since the death of the Imam Said-bin-Ahmed. Owing, perhaps, to his recent affectation of sanctity, the dignity was offered to Hamud, who at first accepted but subsequently declined it; whereupon leaving Sohar and its dependencies in charge of his son, and placing a nominee of his own over er-Rastak, he went into retirement at el-Kusairah. Seif, having gained the affections of the people at Sohar, began to set his father's authority at defiance, refused to remit him any part of the revenue, and cultivated amicable relations with the Seyyid Thuwainy, the Wali of Maskat. Exaspe rated at such conduct, Hamud suborned some of his officers to assassinate his son, and then resumed the administration over Sohar. This atrocity was perpetrated in 1849. The Seyyid Said having submitted a detailed account of nxc INTRODUCTION Ham (id's proceedings generally to the hnglisli autliorities, ' in violation of the treaty whicli lie liad made with him through their intervention/' the latter left him at perfect liberty to deal with the offender as he pleased. He there upon directed his son Thuwainy to move against him, and Thuwainy eventually seized him on the shore near Shinas, ' after a series of efforts too long to be narrated, writes our annalist, (but, according to the English account, by a breach of faith and hospitality rarely equalled in Arab his tory/') brought him to Maskat, and confined him in the Eastern fort, where he died shortly after, most probably of ill-usage and starvation, the ordinary treatment to which dis tinguished political prisoners were subjected by the 'Omany authorities. The death of Hamud did not place Thuwainy in posses sion of Sohar, where Kais-bin-'Azzan, the brother of the de ceased, succeeded to the command, and replied to Thuwainy's summons to surrender by a charged salute from the bat teries, which induced him to return to Maskat. 1 He also laid wait for Kahlan-bin-Seif-bin-'Aly, the commandant of the fort at Shinas, whom he suspected of having been an accom plice in the seizure of hisbrother by Thuwainy, and discovering him one day in Sohar had him ' slaughtered like a lamb.' Both sides now prepared for hostilities ; K.ais-bin-'Azzan invoked the aid of Sultan-bin-Sakar, the el-Kawasimy chief, who proceeded to invest Shinas, while the Seyyid Said, who in the meantime had returned from Zanzibar, dispatched letters summoning all the friendly tribes to cooperate with him ; he also succeeded in inducing Sultan-bin-Sakar to forego his alliance with Kais. (Our author expressly states that on this occasion, a.d . 1851, the Wahhabis took no part in the quarrel, as the tribute claimed by them was punctu ally paid by Kais and Thuwainy, for Sohar and Maskat respectively). The campaign opened auspiciously for the 1 Bombay Government Selections. No. xxiv, p. 229.and analysis. xci Seyyid Said, whose army seized the fort of el-Khaburah. Kais, however, still held out at Sohar and refused all his overtures ; but the opportune arrival of Sheikh Maktftm, with a contingent of the Benu-Yas, who recaptured Shinas for the Seyyid, turned the fortune of the war so decidedly against Kais that he proposed a reconciliation, surrendering the fort of Lawa to the Seyyid Thuwainy, as an earnest of his sincerity. By the terms of the convention which was subsequently concluded between the two parties, Kais-bin- ^Azzan delivered up Sohar to the Seyyid Said, receiving in lieu thereof the Waliship of er-Rastak, and engaged to ab stain from all acts of disloyalty in future. On returning to Zanzibar the Seyyid Said appears to have appointed his third son, Turky, to the Waliship of Sohar, which was now placed, for the first time since his accession, at his absolute disposal. It is surprising that our native historian makes no mention of Wahhaby interference in the affairs of'Oman, beyond the statement contained in the preceding paragraph, from a.d. 182C up to this time, 1852. In 1843, as already related at p. Ixxxviii, on the authority of the Bombay Government re cords, the Amir Faisal-bin-Turky had succeeded in re-esta blishing his supremacy throughout Nejd, and intimated his intention of resuming his former position in ^Oman. Two years later, according to the same papers, taking advantage of the divisions which prevailed among the different mem bers of the Seyyid family, he dispatched a force into that province, and made exorbitant demands on the Seyyid Thuwainy, the Seyyid Said's son and deputy at Miiskat, and on his cousin, Hamud-bin-^Azzan, the Wali of Sohar. ' Meanwhile, the presence of our cruiser on the Batinah coast, and the friendly intervention of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, had the effect of inducing the Wahabee chief to accept the terms offered by Syud Thoweynee, who agreed to renew, in his father's name, the annual tribute of 5,000 German crowns, and to pay an additional sum of 2,000■ m iji^i .* I j ■ I':) .T : m ■ Ri! ^ ■V:- : 4i m s&gt; r . SI * **' XC11 INTRODUCTrON crowns on this occasion.' 1 This tribute appears to have been paid regularly from that time up to the termination, in 1852, of hostilities between the Seyyid Said and Kais-bin- , Azzan, of Sohar, but on the return of the former to Zan zibar, towards the end of that year, the AVahhaby Amir dispatched his agent, es-Sudairy, to el-Bereimy, instructed to make the most extravagant demands upon the Seyyid Thuwainy, which he backed up by overrunning all the northern districts. According to our author, ' f he eventually agreed to accept the amount of Kanun [tribute] which the Seyyid Said had formerly paid to the sons of Silud.' This probably refers to the compact entered into between the Seyyid Said and Mutlak-el-Mutairy, in 1811, (see pp. 324-5), where, however, the sum stipulated to be paid is not stated. But the Bombay Government records are more explicit as regards what occurred on the occasion under review. The agent employed is stated to have been 'Abdallah, the son of the Amir Faisal, who came 'avowedly as the arbiter and re- dresser of wrongs which the chief of Sohar and the tribes on the Batina coast had suffered at the hands of Seyyid Said,' demanding the immediate cession of Sohar and the payment of so large an amount of tribute that it was clear he in tended to threaten Maskat. ' The active intervention of the Resident [in the Persian Gulf] at this period, and the moral support afforded to the Government of Muscat by the appear ance of a war vessel on the Arabian coast, induced the Waha- bee chief to enter into negotiations, which ended in a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between Syud Thoweynee and Abdoola-bin-Fysal, whereby the Muscat Government agreed to pay to the Wahabee Ameer an annual tribute of 12,000 crowns, besides arrears to the extent of 6,000 [or 60,000] crowns, and the usual supply of provisions and stores. The Wahabee likewise pledged himself to assist 1 Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wahalee Power, p. U.and analysis. xciii Thoweynee in every Lour of difficulty, and the boundaries of the dominions of either remained as before.' 1 According to an official report drawn up by Captain, now Sir Arnold, Kemball, in 1854, an additional sum of 8,000 crowns was to be paid by the Seyyid Said on account of Sohftr, which had reverted to him through his arrangement with Kais-bin- 'Azzan, as already stated. The severe blow inflicted on the ^Omany state by these humiliating terms exacted by the Wahhabis was aggravated by a fresh disaster which necessitated the immediate return of the Seyyid Said to Mdskat. Towards the end of 1854 the Persians expelled Seif-bin-Nebhan and the Seyyid's officials and garrisons generally from Bunder-el- , Abbas and other fortified posts on the coast of Kerman, occupied them in force, and committed great outrages upon the inhabitants. The sovereigns of 'Oman had farmed those places from the Go vernment of the Shah for an annual sum of 6,000 tomans, and having held the concession for nearly a century they con sidered themselves feoffees in perpetuity, and, subject to the payment of the stipulated rental, wholly irresponsible to the Persian authorities. The new port of Gombroon, on the mainland, since named cf Bunder-el-'Abbas v in honour of its founder, was the most important station comprised in the farm, for thither the Shah-Abbas had removed the commerce of Hormuz, after his expulsion of the Portuguese from that island in 1622, aided by a British force belonging to the East India Company. In 1798 the feof was held by the Seyyid Sultan-bin-Ahmed, the then ruling sovereign of 'Oman, who apparent!}', without any reference to Persia, entered into a treaty with the British, 2 in the 7th article of which he grants them the following extraordinary privileges:— &lt;f In the port of Bunder Abbas (Gombroon), whenever the English shall be dis- 1 Precis, pp. 12, 13. 2 Dated 12th October, 1798.

About this period, moreover, permission was accorded by the Seyyid Sultan for the establishment of a British naval station at Basidu, (Bassadore), on the island of el-Kishm, which has existed there, with the sanction of the rulers of 'Oman, ever since. Such having been the position held by the Omanis within the limits of the ancient feof, the sudden and forcible resump tion of their supremacy over it by the Persians was not un reasonably regarded by the Seyyid Said as an unwarrantable act of aggression, and preparations were accordingly made to resist it. An expedition dispatched under the command of the Seyyid Thuwainy succeeded in recapturing Bunder-el- 'Abbas, Minau, Semil and other places; but the Persians receiving large reinforcements from the interior, while the Arab allies of the Seyyid on the opposite coast were pre vented from joining him by an arbitrary abuse of the inter dict placed by the British Government upon all armed move ments by sea on the part of the petty chiefs occupying the littoral of the Persian Gulf, the Seyyid was obliged to give way, and to make the best terms he could with the victors. Our author states that by the treaty of peace which was sub sequently concluded between the two parties, ' the Persians were to restore to the Seyyid Said all the posts which he had previously heldbut ho omits to record upon what condi tions. Those conditions, as will be seen from the abstract of the treaty given below, 1 were most disadvantageous to the • The following summary of the stipulations of this Treaty, which is dated 11 in the month of Sha'aMn, a.h . 1272,' [April, 1856], is compiled from an Arabic version handed to the Editor by the Seyyid Thuwainy, in 1861:— ' Bunder-el-'Abbas and its dependencies, also the two maritimeand analysis. xcv Seyyid Said ; the annual rental was raised from 6,000 to ] 6,000 tomans; the two islands,Hormuz and el-Kishm, which had been dependencies of ^Oman since their conquest from the el-Main tribe by the Seyyid Sultan, about a.d . 1798, (see p. 226), were thereafter to be regarded as Persian terri tory ; Bunder-el-^ Abbas was to be deprived of its protecting ditch ; and the Seyyid's Wali there was virtually reduced to the condition of a Persian vassal, removable at the caprice of the Governor of Shiraz, and bound to supply any expedition which either the Governors of Fars or Kerman might wish islands, [el-Kishra and Hormuz], together with 'Eisin, Taziyan, Shemil, Minau, and Biyaban, are declared to be places belonging to the Supreme [Persian] Government, over which the Imam of Maskat may appoint de puties for the space of twenty years.

' Should the Governor of Fars or the Governors of Kerman, on any important occasion, wish to dispatch troops towards Cutch [Gundava], or Mekran, or Beloochistan, they shall be treated with the respect due to Governors, and shall be supplied with provisions, guides, and escorts.' Should the Governor of Shiraz complain against the Arab Governor of Bunder-el-'Abbas, the Imam shall immediately remove him, and appoint another in his stead, who shall likewise be subject to the Governor of Shiraz.

In default of heirs, these territories must revert to the Persian Prime Minister.

With a deep sense of humiliation preying on his mind the Seyyid S^id embarked once more for Zanzibar, ' f but the decree of fate overtook him in the sea of Seychelles.^ He died on board his frigate, the Victoria, on the 19th of Octo ber, 1856, at the age of sixty-five, after a reign of fifty-two years, seventeen conjointly with his elder bi'othcr Salim, and the remainder alone. He left fifteen surviving sons:— 1. Thuwainy. 2. Muhammad. 3. Turky. 4. Majid. 5. Barghash. 6. 'Abd-el-Wahhab. 7. Ghalib. 8. 'Abd-el-'Aziz. 9. Khalifah. 10. Suwaid. 11. 'Abbas. 12. Menin. 13.

After the funeral obsequies at Zanzibar, whither the body was conveyed for burial, our author informs us that the Sey yid ' Majid was promoted over his brothers who were on the island,'' and that, ' on assuming authority, he confirmed all the officials in the rank which they had severally held during his fathers lifetime; the people, moreover, recognized him, and were satisfied with his arrangements.' Majid's next step was to dispatch a special messenger with letters for his brothers, Thuwainy, Muhammad, and Turky, communicating the intelligence of the Seyyid's death. These the bearer was directed to deliver to the Sheikh at Ras-el-Hadd, to be for warded to Maskat, and then to return forthwith. When tho letters reached him, Thuwainy retained those addressed to Muhammad and Turky, and also kept his father's death a secret for some time, availing himself of the interval to send particular instructions to the commandants of the different forts throughout the province to be on their guard againstAND ANALYSIS. xcvii surprise. In taking these precautions^ both Majid and Thu- wainy were acting in their own separate interests : the former to stave off as long as possible any interference on the part of Maskat, and the latter to secure himself against the attempts which might be made by other pretenders, more especially by his brother Turky, to dispute his right to the supremacy. When the news of the Seyyid Said^s death was proclaimed at Maskat, ' it caused such a wailing throughout the town that the hills were almost shaken by it.' We must here take leave of our native annalist, whose nar rative closes with the record of the foregoing events; but having followed him down to so recent a period in the history of 'Oman,—a period which was succeeded by great changes in the government of the principality consequent upon the conflicts between the rival claimants to the sovereignty,—it will not be out of place to append a brief account of subse quent occurrences, derived from authentic, chiefly official, sources. It has already been pointed out that, according to the original law which prevailed among the Ibadhiyah of'Oman, every member of that community was considered eligible to the Imamate, and the right of succession was decided by a general election of the tribes ; that in course of time the candidates were limited to descendants of the reigning family; that in the case of Ahmed-bin-Said, the first Imam of the existing dynasty, there was a return to the old sys tem ; and that, after him, the more restricted usage again obtained, and his second son, S;iid, was elected Imam. During Said's Imamate he constituted his younger son, Ilamed, regent on his behalf, while several of his brothers held appointments as Walls, or Governors, over districts which appear to have been assigned to them in appanage by their father, Ahmed. Hiimed was succeeded in the re gency by his uncle Sultan, Ahmed's fifth son, not by any formal election of the tribes, nor with the concurrence of oXCVlll INTRODUCTION his brother, the Imam, who still lived in comparative seclu sion at the inland capital, er-Rastak, but by dint of indomit able bravery and perseverance, often coupled with treachery, whereby he secured the popular support. His successor, the late Seyyid Said, established himself in the regency, in conjunction with his elder brother Salim, much in the same manner. Backed by a strong party in the State, having previously got possession of Maskat and several other foi ti lled towns, he unscrupulously availed himself of any means, however questionable, to check the pretensions of his rivals, and by defeating them made good his claim to the sole, though not undisputed sovereignty over the country. At the time of the Seyyid Said's decease, besides minor delegated commands held by other members of his family, three of his sons were acting as his Walis over the three chief towns and districts of the principality, namely, Ihu- wainy at M^skat, Majid at Zanzibar, and Turky at Sohar; and, according to Mr. Palgrave, these departments were severally secured to the said sons by a division of his ample possessions made by the Seyyid on his deathbed. 1 Ihe statement is decidedly misleading and erroneous; for, in the first place, even if such a legacy of territorial jurisdiction had been bequeathed by the testator, it would have been absolutely null and void, since not a single instance is ad- ducible, from the preceding annals of the principality, of an Imam or Seyyid disposing of his territories by will or other wise. Succession was theoretically regulated by election; practically, at a later period, by success, obtained either by i 'To Thoweynee, the eldest, he allotted'Oman from Barka eastwards, with Djebel-Akhdar and the adjoining provinces, besides the depen dencies in the Gulf. Majid, the second in age, [read, the fourth, for Muhammad was the second and Turky the third], obtained the African possessions; while the younger, Amjed, [read, Turky : the Seyyid Sa'id had no son called Amjed], had for his share the westerly mainland of 'Oman from Barka to Katar, with Sohar for capital.' Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii, p. 277.and analysis. xcix force or intrigue, or both, over other competitors. But, in fact, the late Seyyid Said made no such arrangement for the administration of his dominions after his death: his will, dated the 26th of Ramadhan, a.h . 1266=6th August, 1850, was subsequently examined by the Maskat-Zanzibar Commis sion, and was found to consist wholly of bequests of what he considered his personal property, without any allusion what ever to the succession, or to the future government of the country. Under these circumstances it was naturally to be antici pated that the death of the Seyyid Said would be the signal for a sharp contest for the vacant supremacy. Thuwainy, being already in possession of Mdskat, claimed the succes sion, with the concurrence of a majority of the ^Omany popu lation ; Majid obtained the recognition of the Zanzibaris and the chiefs of the East African possessions, but, at the outset, entered into an amicable arrangement with his brother Thu wainy, whereby he engaged to pay him 40,000 crowns annu ally, whether as tribute, or as a subsidy implying no subjec tion to Mdskat, was afterwards disputed ; while Turky, who l still retained Sohar, showed indications of assuming inde pendence. Majid, having subsequently refused to pay the stipulated annuity to Thuwainy, the latter prepared to assert his claims by an appeal to arms, and equipped an imposing force in the early part of 1860, a part of which had actually sailed for Zanzibar, when the British Government deemed it expedient to interfere. Eventually, both parties having aarreed to submit their claims to the arbitration of the V ice- O roy and Governor-General of India, the late Lord Canning, a Commission, presided over by Brigadier, now Sir William Coghlan, K.C.B., was appointed to inquire into the merits oi the case. ' The result of these inquiries showed that, in the Imam's family, succession depended on election ; that on the death of the late Seyyid Said, his son Majid was elected by the people of Zanzibar and its African dependencies to be';.Oi iiv;! ■iff' ^ i •ii|:-f ■' i i' •*» i &lt;. u! li,; y, V ■. v I ■ Hi i c INTRODUCTION their ruler; that the altered circumstances and condition ot those dependencies, during the last halt century, fully en titled them to that privilege, and that they would have been justified in resisting any attempt made by the Seyyid Thu- vvainy, the ruler of the parent State, to coerce them into sub mission. On these grounds, the Commission arrived at the conclusion that the Seyyid Majid's claim to sovereignty over Zanzibar and its dependencies was superior to any which could be adduced in favour of the Seyyid Thuwainy. The Government, while concurring in this conclusion, considered the facts that the Seyyid Thuwainy was prepared to assert his claim by force of arms, and that he relinquished his pur pose only in deference to the British Government, as invest ing him with a claim to compromise when contesting a title which was principally derived from force. In seeking for a basis of compromise, attention was naturally directed to tlio terms on which the Seyyid Thuwainy had consented to icsign his claims on his father's African possessions, namely, on payment of an indemnity of 40,000 crowns per annum by Zanzibar to Maskat. The various questions at issue having been submitted to the Government of India, the Viceroy declared the following as the terms ot his decision : ' 1. That his Highness the Seyyid Majid be declared ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of his late Highness, the Seyyid Said. ' 2. That the ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the ruler of Maskat a subsidy of 40,000 crowns. 1 ' 3. That his Highness the Seyyid Majid pay to his High ness the Seyyid Thuwainy the arrears of subsidy for two years, or 80,000 crowns. ' This annual payment was not to be understood as a re- 1 Regard was also had, in fixing the amount of this subsidy, to the fact that 'Oni&amp;.n, the parent State, was burdened with an annual tribute of 20,000 crowns to the Wahhabis, the half of which had heretofore been remitted from the treasury of Zanzibar.AND ANALYSIS. ci cognition of tlie dependence of Zanzibar upon Maskat, neither was it to be considered merely personal, but should extend to successors, and be held as a final and permanent arrange ment, compensating the ruler of Maskat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequality be tween the two inheritances. m The terms of the Viceroy's arbitration were cordially ac cepted early in 1862 by the rival Seyyids, as well as by the principal chiefs and tribes concerned. The compromise was undoubtedly advantageous to both parties, and calculated to consolidate their respective powers. The severance of Zan zibar from 'Oman, and its erection into an independent prin cipality, exempted it, at the expense of one-fifth of its then estimated revenue, from being forced to participate in the hereditary feuds of the parent State, and left it free to culti vate its industrial and commercial resources for the benefit of its own subjects. The ruler of 'Oman, on the other hand, received a fair compensation for his surrendered claims upon Zanzibar, and was released at the same time from the care of a distant dependency, which he was unable to govern without neglecting the public interests of his Arabian provinces. There can be no question, indeed, that the frequent absences of the late Seyyid Said at Zanzibar inflamed, if they did not originate, many of the troubles which agitated 'Oman during his reign, and greatly weakened his authority in that part of his dominions. The Seyyid Turky, of Sohar, was the only person dissatis fied with the arbitrament, and relying on the support of Majid, whose agents had formerly abetted his designs of un dermining Thuwainy's authority, he now endeavoured to form a coalition against him. He himself eventually yielded to the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him by the Govern- 1 Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wahabee Power, pp. 14, 15. The annual revenue of Maskat was estimated at 129,600 crowns ; that of Zanzibar at 206,000 crowns.cii INTRODUCTION ment of India, but tlie insubordination which his attempts had evoked broke out into a serious insurrection among the tribes of el-Batinah. In this emergency the Seyyid Thu- wainy is reported to have called on the W ahhaby Aniir for aid, and Faisal lost no time in sending a force to Sharjah, under the command of his son 'Abdallah. It appears, how ever, that the Wahhabis were more intent on plunder and bloodshed than on reducing the rebels to the obedience of their ally, and Thuwainy, who was at length roused to the danger of the situation, dispatched a considerable fleet and army to the disturbed districts. On this occasion some fresh arrangement is said to have been concluded between theA\ ah- haby lieutenant, 'Abdallah-bin-Faisal, and the Seyyid Thu wainy, regarding which the Government records furnish no information, but which Mr. Palgrave describes as follows : ' On his side the ^Omanee monarch promised to forward a yearly present to the Kiadh, under title of contribution to the Shereef of Mecca ; to permit the establishment of a per manent garrison in Bereymah, for the avowed purpose of keeping down the Menaseer and Aiil-Morrah, grown insolent during the late disturbances—this garrison was to be in the pay and under the immediate orders of 1 howeynee ^ lastly, the King agreed to admit a certain number of Nejdeans (about three hundred, I believe), into his own personal service and guard. On these terms the treaty was ratified by either party, and 'Abd-Allah and his troops finally evacuated the land, leaving behind them an accumulated debt of hatred and re venge which generations cannot pay. The country now entered upon a season of tranquillity, which only lasted however till towards the end of 18(34, when 'Azzan- bin-Kais, the Wali of er-Rastak, displayed a hostile spirit towards the Seyyid Thuwainy, his lawful sovereign, and pro posed to transfer his allegiance to the Amir of the Wahha bis, under certain conditions of tribute payment, f Azzan is 1 Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii, p. 284.AND ANALYSIS. cm a lineal descendant of the Imam Ahmed, and the son of Kais, of Sohar, who in 1 851 surrendered that fortress to the Seyyid Said, by whom he was appointed Wali of er-Rastak, see p. 367, also, ante, p. xci.) The favourable reception of these overtures by the Wahhaby chief, coupled as it was by a de mand on the part of the latter for an increased annual tribute from ^Oman, very naturally excited the resentment and appre hensions of the Seyyid Thuwainy. These were aggravated shortly after by an attack made by the Wahhabis on SAr, in conjunction with some of the disaffected tribes of Jaalan, un der the leadership of one 'Abdu-^l-Aziz, a subordinate Wah haby officer, when they succeeded in carrying off the entire wealth of the place, the greater part of which belonged to British Indian subjects, who estimated their losses at 27,000 dollars. One of their number, moreover, was killed during the assault. The friendly remonstrances of the British Government having failed to obtain satisfactory redress for the outrage committed on its subjects, or to bring about an adjustment of the differences subsisting between their Amir and the keyyid Thuwainy, the Indian authorities urged upon the latter the imperative necessity of repelling the insolent aggressions of the Wahhabis, promising at the same time to accede to his request for a supply of guns and ammunition. In the mean time, the Political Resident in the Gulf was employed in giv ing assurances to the chiefs on the Pirate Coast that the English Government would not object to their aiding the Seyyid by land. W hile the latter was engaged in collecting and equipping the tribes for an advance upon el-Bereimy, the Wahhabis, who were not indifferent to the warlike preparations which were being pushed forward against them, had moved a de tachment upon Saham, not far from Sohiir, and driven the resident Banians into the sea, one of whom was drowned. Another abortive attempt having been made to obtain satis-civ introduction faction for tliese and other coincident atrocities, a letter was dispatched to the WahMby Amir, on the 6th of January, 1866, apprising him that 'if at the expiration of seventeen days the required satisfaction isnot given by your Highness, the Bri tish ships of war will destroy the forts on your seaboard, and confiscate your Highness's craft there lying/' No notice hav ing been taken of this missive. Captain Pasley, in command of H.M.S. Highflyer, proceeded on the 2nd of February to el- Katif, and destroyed two war-buggalows and a small fort called ' Burj-Bullif/ , which commands the boat-channel to that harbour. The day following he attacked the adjoining fort of Daman, similarly situated, and succeeded in effecting an entrance into the tower, but finding the garrison much stronger than he had been led to anticipate was obliged to retreat with the loss of three men killed and two officers and two men wounded. On the 1 1 th of the same month he ap peared before Sur, below Maskat, and having given due cau tion to the non-combatants to quit the vicinity of the forts, dispatched the Highflyer's boats at daybreak next morning up the creek leading to the town, which either confiscated or destroyed all the boats in the harbour belonging to the el- Janabah, the offending tribe, besides burning a large quan tity of ship-timber. Before resorting to further summary measures the British Government wished to ascertain the effect of this chastisement upon the Wahhabis and their allies, and also to learn what progress the Seyyid Thuwainy was making in his projected attack upon el-Bereimy. In the mean time the startling in telligence of the Seyyid's death and the succession ot his eldest son, Salim, reached Colonel Pelly, the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, at Ras-Musandim. Having reason to suspect foul play, the Resident started forthwith for Sohar, where he succeeded in liberating the Seyyid Tiirky, who had previously been imprisoned in that fortress by Salim s orders, and elicited from him and others a circumstantial account ofV and analysts.

Arriving off Maskat, Colonel Pelly found the British re sidents there in a state of panic, and took the precaution of recommending them, pending further intelligence, either to seek refuge on board the steamer Berenice, then in the harbour, or to embark in their own crafts. On the following day the Seyyid Salim deputed one of his near relatives with a letter to the Resident, in which he reiterated his previous assertions regarding his father's death, namely, that he had died of fever after three days' illness, and offered to follow the Resident's wishes in every respect; but Colonel Pelly declined to reply to this letter, or in any way to acknowledge the Seyyid Salim. Meanwhile, the latter was reinforced by the arrival of an influential Mullah from es-Suwaik, and also by 'Azzan-bin-Kais, of er-Rastak, then in alliance with the Wahhabis, both of whom came with a large following to his support. From the fact that about this time the Seyyid Salim deputed two envoys to Bombay with a letter soliciting the renewal of the relations which had hitherto subsisted between the British and Maskat Governments, it does not seem probable that he, at least, contemplated any injury to our subjects residing in 'Oman; nevertheless, as no reliance could be placed on the temper of his fanatical advisers, measures were promptly taken to protect British interests on the seaboard wherever they were exposed to danger. In the month of April of the same year, 1866, an envoy was dispatched to Abu-Shehr (Bushire) by the W ahhaby Amir, 'Abdallah,— who had just succeeded to the supre macy over Nejd by the death of his aged father, Faisal,—■CV1 INTRODUCTION duly commissioned to request the good offices of tlie Resi dent in establishing friendly relations between the Amir and the British Government; to assure him that the Amir would neither oppose nor injure British subjects residing within his territories ; and, further, that he would not at tack the Arab tribes in alliance with the British, especially those of'Oman, while the customary due from that principality was punctually paid. These overtures were met in a corresponding spirit by the Indian authorities, and though they declined to guarantee the payment of the Mas- kat tribute, they agreed that, at the solicitation of the Amir, the Resident might mediate between the two parties, in the event of any difficulty arising on that score. About this time the Government of India either expressly or virtually acknowledged the Seyyid Salim as the ruler of ^Oman, in succession to his father. The decision to that effect was not arrived at until after careful deliberation; for the question not unnaturally arose whether, consistently with our principles, we could or ought to recognize a parri cide. Apart from the fact that the charge against Salim was never legally substantiated, and that he persisted in asserting his innocence, the British Government appears to have come to the judicious conclusion that the alleged guilt of the ac cused, in a matter of purely domestic concernment, was be yond their jurisdiction, and that if the 'Omanis did not sciuplo to acknowledge him as their sovereign, we, as a foreign power, were not called upon by any law to repudiate him in that capacity.

CVll ticm by the Christian sovereigns of Europe, and flagrant as Salim's alleged crime may appear to us, this History records several atrocities, equally heinous, perpetrated by the rulers of 'Oman, without any protest from their subjects, and with out forfeiting their popularity. Thus at pp. 101-2 we read how the Imam Muhenna was treacherously murdered in prison by his cousin, Yaarub, who thereupon succeeded him, having been previously assoiled by the Kadhi ' from the guilt of rebellion, and discharged from making restitution for the wrongs he had perpetrated.' Sultan-bin-Ahmed attained the sovereignty by a series of the grossest frauds, coupled with murder, (p. 214) ; the renowned Seyyid Said, Salim's grandfather, assassinated his cousin, Bedr, to whom he had committed the administration, and through whose in fluence mainly he had established his authority, (pp. 290-1); possibility of competition. The story of Selymus and Bajazet, the Sons of Solyman the Magnificent, is a perfect experiment of the feud and dissention which is bred in the desires of barbarous Princes; so that when they arrive to any maturity of age, they are always transplanted to different Seraglios abroad, where they keep their Courts distinct, and cannot enter within the walls of Constantinople, during the life of their Father, lest by interview with each other, their minds should be moved with emulation, or inhabiting in the Imperial City, should be provided with means before their time, to attempt the Throne of their Father. And for this very reason the Grand Signior hath scarce performed the ceremonies of his inauguration before he hath seasoned his entrance to his Throne with the blood of his brothers ; which barbarous custom began in the time of Sultan Bajazet [the Second, a.d . 1481=1512]. But if the Brothers are but few, and the Grand Signior of a disposition more naturally inclined to clemency than cruelty, he secures them in the Seraylio, under the tuition of Masters, and care of a faithful guard, dif fering nothing from imprisonment, but in the name, prohibiting them the society and conversation of all: and thus the two Brothers of this present Sultan Mahomet [the Fourth, a.d . 1648=1687],. live in as much security and forgetfulness, as if they had never been born, or having passed a private life, were departed to that place where all things are forgotten.'

Atrocities like these, es pecially when associated with dynastic intrigues, are viewed by Orientals in the light of political offences, easily condoned if successful; and, as regards ^Oman, its annals supply seve ral instances of bloodstained conspirators succeeding to the supreme power, whose after-reign was comparatively guilt less, and in some few cases eminently prosperous. The in dignation reported to have been expressed by the 'Omanis at the crime imputed to Salim was probably confined to his rivals, and to a certain extent perhaps was assumed as a political manoeuvre to discredit him with the British Govern ment. As to the intestine feuds which followed, they were just what might have been anticipated, irrespective of Salim's guilt or innocence; for the later annals of 'Oman fail to record one instance of a succession to the sovereignty without similar concomitant disturbances. Our recognition of the Seyyid Salim did not prevent his uncle, the Seyyid Turky, from prosecuting his designs to dethrone him. He first applied to the Chiefs on the Pirate Coast, who would probably have cooperated with him but for the opportune intervention of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who warned them against abetting the Pretender, espe cially by sea. Turky then went to Yankal, and having enlisted the sympathy of its chief, took Sohar by surprise with a small detachment, but was shortly after obliged to retreat. Next, he proceeded to Jaalan, where he was joined by the Benu-Abi-Hasan, the el-Hajariyyin, the el-Harth, and the Al-Wahibah, who recommended an immediate march upon Maskat. Apprised of the impending attack, the Seyyid Salim hastily collected together about two thousand five hundred men from el-Batinah, but through gross mismanagement on his part eight hundred of them were suffered to return home, and five hundred of the remainder deserted on hearing ofand analysis. fix Turky's advance. At the instance of the el-Harth, six chiefs were dispatched to negotiate a peace with Salim, on condi tion of his ceding to Turky the principality of Sohar. Salim peremptorily refused the request, but offered to compromise matters by allowing Tftrky a monthly salary of two hundred dollars and a residence at Mdskat. The envoys, either through fickleness or treachery—it seems tolerably certain that Salim had been busy all along in buying off many of Turky's principal adherents—affected to be satisfied with this proposal, and but for a false rumour having got abroad that the Seyyid Salim had been carried off to Bombay in a British man-of-war, there is reason to believe that all Turky's followers would have abandoned him. Encouraged by the prospect of certain success, a considerable number of the levies rejoined Turky and marched with him to Badbad, about thirty miles from Maskat, where they arrived on the 27th of August. Salim now began to prepare for a defence, but so great was the panic in the town that many of the more wealthy Arabs and Khojas removed with their families and household goods on board the shipping in the harbour. At this juncture, orders were received from the Government of India that the Seyyid Turky was to be threatened with bombardment and non-recognition, in the event of his per sisting in his designs. This menace was communicated to Turky just as he was on the point of attacking el-Matrah, and it so far influenced him that he sent another embassy to Salim demanding the district of Sohar. Salim, who appears to have been partially demented by anxiety and fear, would neither listen to the proposal nor offer any terms of his own. Turky, on the other hand, hearing of the dismay which pre vailed at Maskat, determined to extort harder conditions, and now demanded the entire principality, with the excep tion of Mdskat and el-Matrah. Salinas supineness and vacillation eventually emboldened his rival to attack the latter place, which he succeeded in capturing, the Arabs of the'■•U -■ J ..

A delay of four days on the part of Turky, whose Bedawy followers were intent on ransacking el- Matrah, gave Salim time to collect reinforcements, so that when the enemy appeared before the walls of the town they encountered an unexpected resistance, and on the (3th of September retired to el-Mati'ah with about five hundred followers, from whence they might easily have been dis lodged had Salim possessed the courage to attempt it. Three days later. Colonel Pelly reached el-Matrah, and invited Turky to a conference, either in person or through a repre sentative. The excuses which he made not being deemed satisfactory, her Majesty's frigate Octavia was piloted into the roads by the small steamer May Frere, but before the vessels could anchor an envoy from the Seyyid Turky ap peared on board the steamer, charged to state that his master renounced all demand for territory, and would be satisfied with a pension equivalent to the combined revenues of el- Matrah and Sohar. An agreement was eventually concluded whereby it was stipulated that Turky should receive from the Seyyid Salim an annual stipend of seven thousand two hundred dollars, and reside in future within the territories of British India, under the supervision of our Government. Thereupon el-Matrah was surrendered to Salim, and his uncle Turky embarked for Bombay on the 11th of September, 1867, where we must leave him for the present. No sooner, however, had the ruling Seyyid escaped this danger than he was involved in another, springing from the same fertile source—the absence of any recognized order of succession to the sovereignty over 'Oman. His kinsman, the Seyyid Hamed-bin-Salim, 1 who held the appanage of el-Masnaah, 2 which had been conferred upon him by his 1 11 dmed-bin-Salim, was the cousin to Thuwainy, the Seyyid Salim s father.

(A different opinion charges Salim with being the aggressor in this in stance, thereby exasperating several of the tribes against him). Be that as it may, Salim having been officially ap prised not to expect any active aid from the British began to bestir himself, and dispatched a squadron to Barkah, 1 whither he proceeded in person on the 7th of February, 1868, with a respectable force, and where he was shortly after joined by a contingent under the command of Turky- bin-es-Sudairy, the Wahhaby Lieutenant of el-Bereimy. He also sent Hajjy-Ahmed, his Wazir, to Jaalan to enlist the el-Hinavvy of that district in his favour, promising them adequate rewards for their alliance. But his hesitation either to march against his rival or to come to terms with him emboldened the surrounding tribes to assume a threat ening attitude, while he himself was so pressed for funds to provision his troops that Colonel Felly advanced him ten thousand dollars, in addition to a similar accommodation which had been previously granted to him. These sums were part of forty thousand dollars placed at Salinas dis posal by the Government of India for the suppression of 1 The ' Burka' and ' Burkah' of our maps and charts.

All these hostile preparations, however, ended in a de ceptive reconciliation between the contending parties, and the Seyyid Salim returned to Barkah. The sequel illustrates the knavishness and perfidy of the Arab tribes. 1 he el- Hinawy chiefs were dissatisfied with the gifts awarded them, and insisted that their compact with the Seyyid included a plenary amnesty for Hamed-bin-Salim, who, it appears, had been forwarding money to bribe other chiefs from Jaalan to come to his assistance. A considerable number responded to the call and forced their way through the passes near Semail, from whence they dispatched a reassuring message to his Highness, stating that they intended to ratify their compact with him at Barkah. On the way thither they were met by Hamed-bin-Salim, who gave them five hundred dollars to renounce their allegiance to Salim, to which they readily acceded, and further threatened to attack Maskat. Repent ing, after pocketing the bribe, they made fresh overtures to Salim, who on his part promised them a reward of ten thou sand dollars, of which two thousand were to be paid at once and the remainder at a subsequent period. Within a few days they insolently demanded the balance, and their demand being refused they plundered some of the Wahhaby Com mandant's camels, and took refuge in el-Masnaah, much to Hamed-bin-Salim's consternation, who was obliged to pawn his family jewels to meet their perquisitions. From some cause or other a panic spread among them on the great fes tival of the ^Eid, and they broke up into flying detachments, and on their journey homeward were attacked by the el- Ghafiry and the Benu-Riyam, losing several of their num ber. This discomfiture has greatly lessened the prestige of the el-Hinawy in the estimation of their rivals in 'Ormin. A few months of tranquillity succeeded, but in September of the same year, 18G8, 'Azzan-bin-Kais, of er-Rastak, (see2 AND ANALYSIS. CXlll pp. cii-iii), reappeared as a competitor for the sovereignty and seized upon Barkah. So well organized, moreover, was his plan of operations, that on the 3rd of the following month he occupied Maskat, leaving the Seyyid Salim barely time to escape to one of the harbour fortresses. In his precipi tate flight he left his valuables behind him, estimated at £200,000 sterling, together with many heirlooms of the dynasty, all of which were either plundered or destroyed by the invaders. Colonel Pelly, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, being in the harbour at the time, was appealed to by his Highness, who solicited the active cooperation of the British Government in this emergency, on the ground that the pre sent hostilities were merely a corollary of the Seyyid Turky's rebellion, which the Government of India had aided him in suppressing. Pending a reference to superior authority Colonel Pelly recommended a truce, but 'Azzan declared that his people had come to fight, not to negotiate, and he accord ingly opened fire upon the fort, thereby endangering the British shipping, which shortly after cleared out of range. Besides giving ^Azzan to understand that he would be held responsible for any injury done to resident British subjects, either in their persons or property. Colonel Pelly demanded that no attempt should be made at present to remove two long 18-pounder guns, which had been presented to the Seyyid Salim's father to use against this same ; Azzan, and which were then lying under the fort. Despite this re monstrance, one of the guns was carried off during the night of the 5th, placed in position on the following day, and dis charged against the fort. To prevent the capture of the remaining gun. Captain Brown of H.M.S. Viyilant sta tioned a rocket-party in the fort, but the Seyyid Salim's re quest that the rockets should be used to drive the Seyyid ^Azzan from the palace, where he had taken up his abode, was refused.cxiv INTRODUCTION On the morning of the 7th a telegram was received from Government forbidding force to be used in Salinas behalf, and expressing a preference for the Seyyid Turky, in the event of his election by the people. This intelligence was the death-blow to Salinas hopes; nevertheless, he reported on the following day that there was some chance of an ar rangement with his rival. Next morning, however, while on board the Vigilant, whither he had been conveyed at his own request in one of the ship's boats, the flags were hoisted on the forts, and a salute fired in honour of the accession of the Seyyid 'Azzan-bin-Kais. On the 11th the Seyyid Salim embarked in his ship the Prince of Wales and sailed for Bunder-el-' Abbas. Between October, 1868, and March, 1869, Salim, having collected a considerable force at the island of el-Kishm and at Bunder-el- , Abbas, made several attempts to recover his lost dominions, but the interdict of the Government of India upon all armed movements by sea—alike irritating to both belli gerents but especially prejudicial to the ex-sovereign— greatly crippled his enterprise. He succeeded, however, in landing at Dabai, on the northern coast, and formed a coali tion with the Wahhaby lieutenant at el-Bereimy, for the pur pose of invading the M^skat frontier. 'Azzan in the mean time was engaged in hostilities with the el-Ghafiry, who, true to their antecedents, took advantage of the present complications to dispute the supremacy of the el-Hinawy. During a short campaign he successively reduced the el- Jibur, the es-Seyyabiyym, the Benu-Ruwahah, and the Ni- zariyyah of Semail, returning in triumph to Mdskat. About this time the opinion gaining ground that the elec tion of the Seyyid Turky would be welcomed by the majority of the people, the Government of India permitted him, wholly on his own responsibility, to leave Bombay whenever he thought proper. His release, as will appear in the sequel, added a fresh element of discord to the anarchy prevailing inAND ANALYSIS. cxv 'Oman and its dependencies. As regards the latter, the Seyyid Nasir, younger brother to the Seyyid Salim, had already made himself master of Guadel and Shahbar on the coast of Mekran. The death of the Wahhaby lieutenant of el-Bereimy, to gether with many of his followers, in an engagement with the el-Kawasim of Sharjah, frustrated Salim's hope of any assistance from that quarter. Resolving, however, to make one desperate attempt to regain his lost position, he marched inland during the month of May, and on the 14th of August reached Birkat-el-Mauz, (see map). But, wherever he went, disaster followed him : personally wanting in courage, and destitute of any qualities calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the tribes, he met with a sorry reception, and being in constant danger of seizure by 'Azzan's party he returned to el-Kishm in September, without the least chance in prospect of recovering the sovereignty. Fortune, on the other hand, favoured ^Azzan-bin-Kais. In July he captured the fortress of el-Bereimy,—long the fron tier stronghold of the Wahhabis and the base of their opera tions against the tribes on the northern coast and the Mds- kat territory,—and established friendly relations with the Benu-Yas and the el-Kawasim. In September he was again in the field, and before the end of the year he not only cap tured the towns and fortresses of Behla, Azka, Adam, and Nezwa in 'Oman proper, but marching into Jaalan with a considerable force so overawed the tribes of that district that they tamely submitted to him. In January, 1870, the Wahhaby Amir, 'Abdallah-bin- Faisal made preparations to recapture el-Bereimy, whereupon 'Azzan, accompanied by his brother, Ibrahim, started for Barkah, where they were joined by Suud, brother to the Wah haby Amir, with whom Suud was at variance. 1 Summoning 1 Mr. Pal grave, writing six years ago, thus alludes to a general im pression among the Wahh&amp;bis that an open rupture would take placeCXV1 INTRODUCTION the tribes to his standard 'Azzan marched to el-Bereimy, and called upon his ally, the Chief of Abu-Zhaby to co operate with him. 'Abdallah-bin-Faisal, on his side, formed a coalition with the other Arab chiefs of the northern coast, but owing to an unusual drought in the spring of the year which made supplies scarce on the road, and the rumours which reached him of intrigues at er-Riyadh in favour of his brother, he abandoned the expedition. The report of impending hostilities between the Amir of Nejd and 'Azzan had induced the Seyyid Turky and his nephew Salim, the ex-sovereign, to join the Wahhaby con federates at Dabai, but finding on their arrival that active operations had been postponed Salim returned to el-Kishm. Turky remained there some time longer, hoping to enlist the friendly tribes on the northern coast in his favour, but meeting with little encouragement in that quarter he went from place to place, trying to raise followers. Early in August he dis- patched a body of Persians and Beloochees from Bunder-el- 'Abbas to Sur in small boats, which managed to elude the vigilance of our cruisers, and during the same month his empty purse was replenished by his brother Majid, who for warded the money from Zanzibar in one of his own ships of war. The levies were welcomed at Siir by the Jaalan tribes, but Turky despairing of joining them there, owing to the strict watch kept upon all armed movements by sea, crossed between 'Abdallah and Su'ud, the sons of Faisul by different mothers, on the death of their father ' The two brothers, almost equal in age, are at daggers drawn, and cannot speak even peaceably to each other. Feysul, to prevent frequent collision, has appointed Sa'ood regent of Yemamah and Hareek, with Salemee'yah for chief residence, thus putting him at a distance from Riadh, where 'Abd-Allah resides in quality of special governor over the town.

CXVll over stealthily to Bunder-Fakkan, where he was met by a deputation from the Benu-Naim, who for some time past had been in arms against 'Azzan-bin-Kais. Marching inland, in September, by el-Fujairah and the Wadi-Ham, he was rein forced by the Benu-Kutb and several of the el-Yaarubah tribes, and then joined the Benu-Naim at el-Bereimy, all the forts of which, with the exception of the main one, were in their hands. Both parties having called upon their respective confede rates, the Sheikh of Abu-Zhaby came to the aid oPAzzan's side, while the chiefs of Dabai, 'Ajman and Ras-el-Khaimah cooperated with Turky. Several engagements followed be tween the belligerents, but with no decisive result. Mean while, 'Azzan himself and his brother, Ibrahim, were busy reducing some of the inimical tribes of ezh-Zhahirah, and suc ceeded in capturing the forts of 'Abrein' 1 and el-'Ainein. He also resumed the siege of el-Hazm, 2 and then proceeded towards Dhank, 3 then held by the Benu-Naim and ' Denah' tribes. On reaching Yankal, his levies from esh-Sharkiyyah and 'Oman proper demanded ol him the fulfilment of the promises which had induced them to espouse his cause, and on being told that he was unable to comply with their re quest they left him in a body, thereby reducing his effective strength to 2,000 men. Deeming that number sufficient, with the aid of two field guns, to seize Dhank, he marched thither on the 4th of October, but on the following day was surrounded and completely routed by a force under the Seyyid Turky. 'Azzan and his brother, Ibrahim, escaped to Sohar, leaving from three to four hundred followers, including several chiefs, either dead or wounded on the field, ihe en gagement over, Turky moved towards the south-east, and 1 gQ printed in the Government dispjitclies, but I know of no such place in ezh-Zhahirah.

Duriug his absence, the troops under Sulei- man-bin-Seif laid siege to Nezwa, closed the passes beyond Semail, and obtained other advantages over their antago nists, and only awaited Turky's order to advance upon Mas- kat. In Jaalan, Turky prevailed upon the Benu-Abi-'Aly and the Benu-Abi-Hasan, and other tribes to join him, and then marched to Sur, where he encamped with 4,000 men and 2,000 camels, intending to proceed to Maskat by the coast route. The Seyyid 'Azzan, on the other hand, besides taking every precaution to secure the maritime capital and other important points on the littoral, has, it is said, come to terms with the Benu-Naim on the north, and secured the pro mised aid of several of the el-Hinawy tribes, who on finding that Turky was destitute of funds to reward their services incontinently deserted to his rival. Such was the position of the contending parties at the end of 1870. It is difficult to foresee which will eventually pre vail ; the chances are decidedly in favour of'Azzan-bin-Kais, for the simple reason that being already the de facto ruler, and having the resources of the country, especially the re venue from the customs athis disposal, he possesses the means, which Turky does not, of paying the mercenary tribes to sup port him. As regards the legitimacy of his pretensions, it should be borne in mind that there is no recognized law regu lating the succession to the sovereignty over ^Oman. Since a.d. 1 741 it has been confined to those members of the House of the Al-Bu-Said—which still commands the suffrages of the majority of the population—who have been able to establish their claims by superior force. But 'Azzan-bin-K.ais is a lineal descendant of Ahmed-bin-Said, the first Imam of the dynast \, at the same remove from him as the Seyyid Salim, and onlyAND ANALYSIS. cxix one degree beyond that of Salim's uncle, the Seyyid Turky; hence, as far as the popular attachment to the Al-Bil-Said goes, 'Azzan is as eligible to the sovereignty as either of his rivals, and has unquestionably exhibited far greater political acumen and military prowess—a combination of qualities indispensable for maintaining anything like order among the turbulent tribes oPOman. His success hitherto against the Wahhabis, though undoubtedly facilitated by the feud exist-, ing between the Amir of Nejd and his brother, Suud, gives him a strong claim to the gratitude of his countrymen, who for the last sixty years have been placed under heavy contri butions by those fanatics, besides living in constant dread of their aggressions. In other respects, also/Azzan has favour ably disappointed the anticipations formed of him at the first flush of conquest. At that time he appears to have acted in concert with an extreme religious faction—a comparatively recent growth in 'Oman—alluded to at p. 217, as the Muta- wahhibm, or abettors of Wahhabeeism. That such was the character of these enthusiasts is evident from the fact that a class of propagandists, called Mutdwa ah by the Wahhabis, (see p. 247), existed among them, and also from the inter dict which was placed upon the sale and use of tobacco, the former an institution unknown to the religious system of the Ibadhiyah, and the latter a commerce and luxury not for bidden by its precepts. But 'Azzan, having made trial of his strength and found that he could dispense with such sinister colleagues, has recently adopted a more tolerant policy, intro duced many improvements in the internal administration, and manifested a sincere desire to maintain friendly relations with foreigners, more especially with the British Government. The standing menace, however, to durable tranquillity in ^Oman, under the best of rulers, is the existence of so many Seyyids, or Princes of the reigning dynasty, who, believing themselves to be invested by birth with equal rights to the sovereignty, may be expected to take advantage of every opportunity tocxx INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS. assert their claims. There are at least thirty of these For- phyrogeniti at the present time, of whom from ten to twelve are, like the Seyyid Turky, sons of the late Seyyid Said. The severance of Zanzibar and its East African depend encies from ^Oman, in 1861, when they were formed into a separate principality under the Seyyid Majid, (see p. c), has preserved that young State from being embroiled in the recent conflicts of the mother country, thereby giving it free scope to husband its growing resources, and to become —what under an enlightened ruler it might become—the means of promoting civilization, industry, and commercial prosperity among the aboriginal tribes on the African coast. The death of the Seyyid Majid in October, 1870, was fol lowed by the uncontested accession of his younger brother, Barghash, who, it is sincerely to be hoped, will in his ad ministration of the Zanzibar territories turn to good account the experience acquired during a year's residence at Bombay. The most dangerous rock ahead in his future career is the possibility of his being induced to intermeddle, either on his own behalf or on behalf of his brother, Turky, with the domestic affairs of 'Oman.

Salil-ihn-Razik, tlce author of this hook, to the reader :— Although our main object is to set forth the biography of the illustrious Ahmed-bin-Sa 1 id and his descendants, never theless we have deemed it desirable to preface it with an account of all the Imams of 'Oman, in order to a more com- jplete understanding of the subject, and that those hitherto unacquainted ivith their history may learn to know that the el-Yemeny, the el-'Omany Azdites are of great renown. The most learned and accurate historians agree in this, that whereas after the disturbances and dissensions which had occurred among the people, 1 the supreme authority was eventually vested in Mo'awiyah-bin-Harb-bin-Sofyan,- never theless Mo'awiyah exercised no jurisdiction whatever over 'Oman. It was not until 'Abdu-'l-Malik-bin-Marwan suc- 1 The reference here is to the differences among the Mussulmans which led to the assassination of 'Othman, the election of 'Aly and his subsequent deposition, and the accession of his son Hasan, who even tually resigned the Khalifate in favour of Mo awiyah.

It took place on tins wise :— 'Abdu-'l-M&amp;lik had appointed el -Hajjaj -bin-Ynsuf, eth-Tha- kify, 1 governor over 'Irak. According to concurrent testi mony, Suleiman and Said, the sons of 'Abbad-bin-el-Ju- landa, 2 of the lineage of its Sultans, at that time ruled over 'Oman. El-Hajjaj was the first to send troops against them under successive commanders, but they were generally re pulsed with the loss of their baggage. At length he was advised to dispatch an expedition under the command of el -Kasim -bin-Sh'iwah, el-Maziny, who embarked a large force in ships, and, on reaching the coast of 'Oman, anchored near the village of Hatat. 3 Suleiman-bin- 5 Abbad attacked him at the head of the Azdites, and after a fierce encountoi the invaders were routed, el-Kasim and a number of his men were slain, and their equipage fell into the hands of the victors. Some state that none escaped ; but God knows. On hearing of this defeat, el-Hajjaj was greatly alarmed, and forthwith sent for Mujjaah -bin-Sh'iwah, 1 el-Kasim s brother, and ordered him to stir up the people to vengeance, 1 El-Hajjaj, who flourished during the Khalifates of 'Abdu-'l-Malik and his son cl-Walid, was the most eloquent and warlike captain of the age. Several Arabian authors allege that religious fanaticism and a love of glory were not the only motives which actuated him, but that having little confidence in the permanency of the Omeyyah dynasty he sought to provide a suitable asylum for himself. He successively reduced Bokhara, Khuwarizm, and Kashgar. Another army sent by him crossed Sejistan and Mekran, and reached the lower Indus. He died a.h . 95. 2 Most probably the grandsons of 'Abd-el-Julanda, one of the two brothers who ruled over 'Oman during the time of Muhammad. See Introduction. 3 A 'Wadi-Hatat' is mentioned in the sequel as leading to Semail from Maskat; hence it is probable that the abovenamed village was not far from that town. 4 This Mujja'ah, whom Beladzory calls ' bin-Si'ir,' was subsequently appointed governor of el-Mukran (Mekran) and the neighbouring terri tories, under el-Hajjaj. Although he died a year after, an Arabian poet says of him; There is no monument in el-Mukran which does not recall and adorn the memory of Mujja'ah. Futtih-el-Bulddn, p. 435. Lugd. 18G6.the imams op 'oman. 3 and to summon the tribes of Nizar, 1 their followers and allies, to unite in retrieving their disasters in 'Oman. El-Hajjaj manifested the utmost animosity and zeal in carrying out this project, reporting what measures he was taking to 'Abdu-'l-Malik-bin-Marwan, and calling upon the Azdites residing at el-Basrah to join in an expedition against Sulei- man-bin-'Abbad and his adherents. According to the most authentic accounts the force dispatched under Mujjaah numbered 40,000 men. One half left by sea and the other half by land. The latter consisted of horsemen and men mounted on camels. They were encountered by Suleiman and his followers of the el-Azd and others near the water which is five (some say only three) days' journey from el- Balktlah. The said water is now called el-Balkain. 2 There a great battle was fought which ended in the rout of el- Hajjaj's force and their pursuit by Suleiman-bin-'Abbad, ' The Nizar or ' Nizariyyah,' as they are more frequently styled in these annals, are, I conceive, the descendants of Nizar, born about a.d . 64, the son of Mii'add, the son of 'Adnan, the alleged descendant of Ishmael, and reckoned the nineteenth among the progenitors of Muhammad. Nizar had a numerous progeny ; the descendants of his son lyad, after residing for two centuries in the Ilijaz, migrated into the 'Irak Araby ; those of his son Rabi'ah remained in the Hijaz, but those of 'Abdu-'l-Kais, the son of Rabi'ah, went into el-Bahrein, from whence, as already men tioned in the Introduction, they sent a detachment of their tribe to assist Tkrimah, Abu-Bekr's general, in suppressing a revolt in 'Oman. These indications confirm the local tradition that the Nizar came origi nally from the Ilijaz, through Nejd. Communities of them exist in different parts of 'Oman, where they are further distinguished by the name of the districts which they severally occupy, as the Nizariyyah of Semail, of Azka, etc. Their relationship to the el-Kuraish tribe gives them social importance, and rival parties in the country have always bid high to secure their alliance. - I am unable to identify this ' water.' Perhaps it was the stream called 'el-Falj' by el-Tdrisy, and which he describes as flowing into the sea near ' Julfarah.' Niebuhr marks a stream at ' es-Sirr,' lower down on the coast, but it is not represented in any of our modern maps. The 'Omanis appear to have marched westward, through the district now occupied by the Benu-Yas, to meet the invaders coming from the opposite direction.t THE IMAMS OF OMAN. who knew nothing of the approach of the 20,000 men by sea. On the arrival of the latter at el-Yunaniyyah 1 of Julfar, a man of the people of Tawwam 3 informed them of Sulei man's proceedings, telling them how he had gone forth with his army and defeated their companions who had travelled by land, and that after the victory dissensions had broken out among his followers, which led to his being abandoned by all except a few trusty adherents. On MujjaaVs arrival at Barkah he was met by Said-bin- 'Abbad, Suleiman's uterine brother, and a severe conflict took place between them till darkness separated the combatants. On surveying the two armies, Said perceived that his was like a white hair in the hide of a black bull compared with that under Mujjaah ; so, having already lost a number of men in killed and wounded, he retired with the remainder the same night, and taking with him some of his own and his brother's relatives he repaired to the Jebel-el-Akbar, the mountain of the Benu-Riyam, called also the Jebel-el-Akh- dar, and likewise Rudhwan. The enemy followed, but being 1 Probably a village on the western littoral of the promontory, which was sometimes called ' Julfar' and sometimes ' es-Sirr,' from the two most prominent localities on that coast. It is remarkable that onr modern maps and charts omit the town of Julfar, which was situated below Khasab, not far from Cape Musdndim. Ludovico di Varthema touched at the place about a.d . 1505, and describes it as having a good seaport. It was occupied a few years later by the Portuguese, who re tained it chiefly for the sake of its pearl-fisheries, until they were expelled by the Imam Nasir -bin-Murshid, a.d . 1633. The town and fort were destroyed by a combined British and Maskat expedition in 1819, in reta liation for several acts of piracy committed by vessels belonging to the resident tribe. 2 Tawwam was the old name of el-Bereimy, as the author frequently remarks in the sequel. Captain Hamerton, who visited the town in 1850, describes it as of considerable size, situated in a very fertile and well -watered district, and defended by two forts. It has always been a rallying point for the Wahhabis whenever they made inroads into 'Oman 0 It is now held by the Benu-Na'lm, who pay tribute to the Wahhaby Amir.unable to ascend the mountain they took up a position in the Wadi-^l-Mastall, from whence they besieged them. Mujjaah had moored his ships, which numbered three hun- dred, under Maskat. These were attacked by Suleiman, who succeeded in burning fifty, the rest escaping out to sea. Con vinced of his inability to subdue Suleiman, Mujjaah moved towards the coast, and was met by Suleiman at the town of Semail, where a battle was fought between them, which re sulted in the overthrow of Mujjaah, who effected his escape in a ship to Julfar. Having reported all that had befallen him at the hands of Suleiman and Said to el-Hajjaj, and how they had succeeded in enlisting all the el-Azd chiefs of 'Oman on their side, el-Hajjaj dispatched another force by land, con sisting of 5,000 horsemen of the Bedawin of the Shamal, under the command of 'Abdu-'r-Rahman-bin-Suleiman. This man was of the el-Mudhariyyah, and among his followers there was an Azdy of el-Basrah; but neither Suleiman-bin-'Abbad nor his soldiers knew anything of him. He escaped from the camp by night, and coming to Suleiman and Said ap prised them of the impending invasion. On hearing this intelligence they immediately collected their relatives and property, and taking with them a number of their followers and tribe departed for the land of the Zanj, 1 where they died. Thereupon Mujjaah and 'Abdu-'r-Rahman took possession of the country, which they treated as a conquered province, com mitting every species of outrage upon the people. Their suc cess was highly gratifying to el-Hajjaj, who proceeded to appoint el-Khayar-bin-Sabrah, el-Mujashaiy, governor over 'Oman. On the death of 'Abdu-'l-Malik- he was succeeded by his 1 This is the first intimation given by the author of the emigration of the 'Oman Arabs to the east coast of Africa.

He also placed 'Irak under Yezid-bin-Abi-Aslam, who sent Yezid-bin-Seif- bin-Hany to be collector in 'Oman. El-Walid dying, 1 he was succeeded by his brother Suleiman, who deposed the governors from all the other provinces, but left 'Oman under Salih -hin-'Abdu-'r-Rahman-bin-Kais, el-Laithy. Afterwards he directed that there should be collectors as before, but they were to be subject to the supervision of Salih-bin-'Abdu-'r- Rahman. He then placed 'Irak and Khorassan under Yezid- bin-el-Muhallab, el-Azdy, who made his brother Ziyad gover nor of 'Oman. Ziyad discharged his duties to the satisfaction of the inhabitants until the death of Suleiman. The latter was succeeded by 'Omar-bin-'Abdu-'l-Aziz, who governed the people with justice and equity, and died at Ueir-Simaan/ in the province of Hims, near Jvinnasrin, on I riday the 25th day of Rdjab, a.h . 101, [10th February, 720,] after he had held the Khalifate two years, five months, and five days. During his reign, 'Omar-bin-'Abdu-'l-'Aziz had placed 'Adiy-bin-Artat, el-Fazary, 3 over 'Oman, but he subsequently removed him and appointed 'Omar-bin- Abdallah, el-Ansary, in his stead. He was of a benevolent disposition, and won the affections of the people, so that they paid their tribute willingly. On the death of'Omar-bin-'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, he said to Ziyad -bin-el-Muhallab: 'this is the country of your people, and it is fitting that you should superintend their affairs.' 1 a.ii .96= a.d . 715. 2 The monastery of St. Simon. Kinnasrin is about twelve miles from Aleppo. 3 Ahmed-bin-Yahya, el-Beladzory, mentions this Adiy-bin-Artat as having been removed from 'Oman and appointed governor of el-B&amp;srah, where he began building some apartments for himself on the city walls, but was ordered to desist by the Khalifah 'Omar. lie also states that 'Adiy made the creek of the river into a canal and extended it up to the town.

He appointed Abu-Jaafar, el-Mansur, 2 to ; Irak, and he set Janah-bin 'Ah- badah, el-Hinay, over ^Oman. The latter it was who built the mosque of Janah, which is vulgarly called the mosque of Jamah. He was subsequently deposed and his son Mu hammad-bin-Janah appointed in his stead. Janah bin-'Ab- dallah secretly countenanced the doctrines of the el-Ibadhi- yah, who at length took the government of 'Oman into their own hands. Whereupon they ratified in the Imamate JULANDA-BIN-MAS^UD. 3 He was the first of the rightful Imams 4 of 'Omanj and he greatly promoted the el-Ibadhy 5 doctrines. He was just, generous, and pious. [The Khalifah] es-Saffah dispatched Shiban against him, on whose arrival in 'Oman Juldnda sent Hilal-bin-'Atiyyah, el-Khorassany, and Yahya-bin-Najih with a band of Mussulmans 6 to encounter him. When the two sides met and confronted each other, Yahya rose up and uttered the following prayer, referring to both parties :—' 0 God, if we hold the religion which Thou approvest, and adhere to the truth which is agreeable to Thee, cause me to be the first 1 He succeeded to the Khalifate a.h . 132= a.d . 749, and was the first of the el-'Abb&amp;s, or Abbaside dynasty. 2 Brother to Abu-'l-'Abbas, whom he subsequently succeeded in the Khalifate. 3 According to Abulfeda, ' JuUnda' was the name assumed by all the kings of 'Oman at this early period. He says: ' And of the el-Azd, also, are the Benu-Juldnda, the sovereigns of 'Oman. And every one who became king in 'Oman took the name of JulfLnda. At the time of Islam the kingdom was in the hands of Habkar and 'Abd, both descendants of el-Julanda.' Pocock, Specimen Hist. Arab., p. 475. 4 For the full import of this title, see Appendix A. 5 See Appendix B for an account of this sect. 6 The term ' Mussulmans' here implies that the el-Tbadhiyah were the orthodox and their opponents the sectarians or heterodox.8 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. to fall of my companions, and cause Shiban to be the first to fall of his companions, and then put them to flight. But if Shiban holds the religion which Thou approvest, and ad heres to the truth which is agreeable to Thee, then let Shiban be the first to fall on his side/' The two parties then came into collision, and the first killed was Najih, and the first who fell of the opposite party was Shiban. After this occurrence Khazim-bin-Khuzaimah came to 'Oman, and stated that he had come to look after Shiban and his followers; but on hearing what had befallen them he said: ' Let their death and what they have suffered at your hands suffice. My only wish now is to be able to in form the Khalifah that you are obedient and loyal/' Julanda consulted the Mussulmans on this point, but they would not agree to it. It is further stated that Khazim asked for Shi- ban's ring and sword, and that Julanda refused to give them up. This state of things led to a battle between Khazim and the people of'Oman, wherein all Julanda's adherents were slain, and none remained alive but Julanda himself and Hilal-bin-'Atiyyah. Thereupon Julanda said; ' To the at tack, O Hilal!' To which the latter replied ; You are my Imam, and should be before me; rest assured that I shall not survive you.' 1 So Julanda advanced and fought till ho was slain, and was then followed by Hilal. Now Hilal had on a coat of mail, and was armed with a spear, with which he did such execution that the followers of Khazim were astonished at his bravery. They did not recognize him at first, but on hearing that it was Hilal they fell upon him and slew him. This battle took place at Julfar. The Imamate of Julanda lasted two years and one month. 1 There is a play upon the Arabic words used in the original which cannot be conveyed in English.

On the death of Juldnda, the Jababarah 1 ruled over ^Oman, tyrannizing over the people and committing every species of excess and extortion. Notorious among these were Muham- mad-bin-Z^yidah and Rashid-bin-Shazan-bin-en-Nadhr, the Julundites. In their time Ghassan-el-Hinay, who belonged to the Benu-Muharib, plundered Nezwa and expelled the Benu-Nafa^ and the Benu-Hamim, after killing many of them. This happened in the month of Shaaban a.h . 145 [ a.d . 762]. In consequence of this state of things the Benu-Harth 2 en tered into a confederacy, and one of their number, a slave of Bikr, named Ziyad-bin-Said, el-Bikry, collected their suf frages, and it was finally agreed that they should attempt to free themselves from their oppressors by getting rid of (Ihassan-el-Hinay. They accordingly waylaid him in a place called el-Khor, where they fell upon him as he was returning sick from the Benu-Hinay, and murdered him. Menazil-bin- Khanbash, who was collector to Muhammad-bin-Zayidah and Rashid-bin-Shazan, was greatly incensed at this outrage, and marched forthwith against the people of Ibra, who made a stout resistance, but were finally overcome with the loss of forty men. Eventually God had compassion upon those who adhered to the truth, and a confederacy of tbe Mussulmans was formed who stood up for His truth, and succeeded in putting an end to the government of the Jababarah. The change was 1 That is, Tyrants. The term is used in that sense and under similar circumstances in a subsequent part of this history. 2 The el-IIarth are located chiefly in south-eastern 'Oman. The Arabs of Zanzibar belong mainly to this powerful and enterprising tribe. They appear to be an offshoot of the Benu-Temim, who are still scattered over the north east of Nejd, from the desert of Syria to the borders of el-Yamamah. They are probably the descendants of el-Harth, el-'Araj, ...the son of Temim, and therefore of the race of 'Adnan and Ma'add, the ancestors of Muhammad.10 the imams OP 'OMAN, effected in this manner:—The learned elders of the people of 'Oman assembled at Nezwa under the presidency of Musa-bin-Abi-Jabir, el-Azkany, and they agreed to confer the Imamate upon Muhammad-bin-'Affan. But among those who had come together there were some chiefs who had separate views ; so, fearing lest the occasion might prove a source of discord among the Mussulmans, sheikh Musa said first to one and then to another: We have appointed so- and-so of such a village/' until he dismissed them all. After their departure he proclaimed that Muhammad-bin-'Afiun had been duly elected ; whereupon he wrote letters deposing the malcontent chiefs from their authority, and sent governors in their stead. Meanwhile, Muhammad-bin- 'Affan retained his post with the army, but his overbearing conduct towards the Mussulmans, his mode of life, together with his obstinacy, so alienated their hearts that they found a pretext for removing him from his command at Nezwa, and finally deposed him, after he had held office two years and one month. They then met together again and elected as Imam over the Mussulmans EL-W ARITH-BIN-K A'AB, el-Kharusy, 1 el-Yahmady, esh-Shary. He restored the good of former times among the Mussul mans, was upright in his administration, encouraging those who adhered to the truth and restraining impiety and crime, extortion and discord. Even before his elevation to the Imamate he was admired for his excellent qualities both by high and low, and was conspicuous for his integrity and genius. We give the following as a few instances of his benevolence and enterprise:—He caused the waste places to be cultivated, and relieved those who were oppressed in 1 A gentilic cognomen from 'el-Kharus.'

During his government, [the Khalifah] Harun-er-Rashid dispatched an army consisting of 1,000 horse and 500 foot against ^Oman, under the command of 'Isa-bin-Jaafar. In telligence of the impending invasion was communicated to the Imam Warith by Yezid-el-Mahlaby, el-Azdy, and he accordingly sent Faris-bin-Muhammad against him with a large body of soldiers and all the Imam^s forces. The two armies met near Sohar, and 'Isa with the remainder of his troops was put to flight and embarked from the coast close by. Abu-Hamid-bin-Falah, el-Haddany, and 'Omar-bin- 'Omar pursued them in three ships and captured them, killing all his men, but sparing 'Isa, whom they imprisoned in the fort of Sohar. They also seized their ships and kept them to aid the Mussulmans in defending the true faith. The Imam Warith then consulted the learned sheikh ^Aly- bin-'Azrah respecting ^Isa. He replied : ' If you put him to death you will do well; and if you spare him you will also do well.' The Imam therefore allowed him to live, but kept him in prison. It is related that on hearing this, a party of Mussulmans, of whom Yahya-bin-'Abdu- , l- , Aziz was one, came to Sohar without the knowledge of the Imam, and, concealing themselves in the prison, assassinated him, returning to their own homes the same night. 3 When Har{ln-er-Rashid heard 1 Haruu-er-Rashid began to reign a.ii . 170 = a.d . 786. 2 Most of these facts are corroborated by the historian Ahmed-bin- \ ahya, el Beladzory, who writes: u The inhabitants of 'Oman con tinued to pay tithes and poll-tax until the Khalifate of er-Rashid, who appointed 'Isa-bin-Ja'afar-bin-Suleiman-bin-'Aly-bin-'Abdallah-bin-el- 'Abbas governor over that country. 'Isa went against them accom panied by troops from el-Basrah, who began to violate the women and to commit other outrages. This coming to the knowledge of the12 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. of the murder of his friend Jaafar he determined to send another army against 'Oman, but he died before the troops were dispatched, and so God averted that evil from the Mussulmans. The Imam Warith's residence was at Nezwa, where he continued to lead an upright life, forbidding what was un lawful and ordering what was beneficial, until the Lord took him to Himself. He was drowned in the stream of Wadi- Killabuh, near Nezwa, together with seventy of his people. The catastrophe took place on this wise The prison of the Mussulmans was situated near some spreading syca mores, and in the prison were a number of men who had been confined there by the Imam's orders. On the occur rence of the flood he ordered them to be liberated, but no one would venture across on account of the violence of the current. Whereupon the Imam determined to make the attempt himself, and was followed by a number of the by standers, who were all carried away by the stream and perished, as did also the prisoners. The Imam's body was found in the branches of a tree, after the flood had subsided, between 'Akr and Saal of Nezwa, and his tomb is a well-known shrine there unto this day. He held the Imamate twelve years and six months. Then the people gave their allegiance to GHASSAN-BIN-'ABD ALLAH, EL-FEJHY, EL-YAHMADY, EL-AZDY, who trod in the footsteps of tbe good Mussulmans, cherishing the truth and discouraging vice, humbling those who fostered vanity and upholding justice and equity.

The author of this statement says that these Bawqrih are what the vulgar call Zawdrik, and the Imam Ghassan was the first to attack them. In his time, also, Sukar-bin- Muhammad-bin-Zayidah was slain. He was one of those who had supported Rashid-bin-en-Nadhr, el-Julandy and his adherents, aiding them with money and arms. The cir cumstances of his death were as follows :—One of the esh- Shark had set out to attack the Mussulmans, accompanied by the Benu-Hinah and other confederates in his insurrec tionary designs. Moreover, it was reported to the Mussul- vessels equipped for war. El-Beladzory, in his chapter on the Con quest of Sind, mentions a predatory people near the mouths of the Indus who possessed ships of this class and name. The passage, as illustrative of the early piracies in the Eastern seas, is interesting. The incidents narrated occurred about a.ix 705, while el-IIajjaj was governor of 'Irak, with a lieutenant under him over Mekran. ' During his government, the King of the island of el-Yakut [Rubies: Ceylon?] sent him some Mussulman women, born in his country, whose fathers had been merchants and were dead. But the ship in which they were being conveyed was attacked by a party of the Med [?] tribe of ed- Daibul on board of Bawdrij, and they seized the ship and all it con tained. Thereupon one of the women—she was of the Benu-Yarbua'— exclaimed, 'O Hajjaj!' El-Hajjaj hearing of this said, 'I am here!' and thereupon sent to Dahir, [the native prince,] requesting him to obtain the release of the women ; but Dahir replied that those who had seized them were robbers, over whom he had no authority. Then el- Hajjuj directed Obeid-Allah-bin-Nebhan to go against ed-Daibul. 'Obeid-Allah, having been killed, el-Hajjaj wrote to Budail-bin-Tahfah, el-Bajaly, who was then in 'Oman, ordering him to proceed [by sea] to ed-Daibul. On arriving there, his horse threw him, and the enemy surrounded and slew him. Others say that he was killed by the Zatts of el-Bud-hah.' There is much uncertainty about the latter word. Goeje remarks in a note that Anderson suggests ' el-Burhah, the well- known Burhoee or Buroohee tribe.' Fuiilh-el-Bulddn, pp. 435-6.

They charged Sakar with this, but he denied it and stated that his brother was sick at home. But when God put the insurgents to flight it was fully proved that Sakar's brother was among them, and they accordingly charged Sakar with deceit for having concealed from them his brother's treachery. Sakar was at that time at Semail, and the Imam Ghassan sent horsemen after him, and wrote to Wadh-dhah- bin-'Okbah, his governor over the fort of Semail, to deliver him up to them. On their arrival the messengers appre hended him, and the governor, fearing that they might lay violent hands on him by the way, went with them. The Imam had moreover sent a second body of horse under Musa- bin-'Aly to seize and bring him. The two parties met in the Nejd-es-Sahamah, and as they proceeded on their way some of the escort fell upon Sakar and killed him, and neither the governor Abu-'l-Wadh-dhah nor Musa-bin-'Aly was able to prevent them ^ in fact, it is stated that M ai sa-bin-Aly would have incurred the same fate had he ventured to interfere. We have not heard that the Imam Ghassan ever denied who it was that killed Sakar. In those days the government was in its prime and strength. Such is the story of Sakar's death; but God knows the truth. The following is among the recorded decrees of the Imam Ghassan: (may God have mercy upon him !)—There were some out-houses at Semed of Nezwa belonging to the Benu- Julanda—probably the same as those generally called ' the Dark Arches'—situated by the roadside, where a num ber of libertines used to station themselves in order to molest any females who passed that way. 1 This coming to the knowledge of the Imam, he directed^ the people of that 1 Ibn-Batuta, who visited the coast of 'Oman in the fourteenth century, writes disparagingly of the morals of the people. ' I heir wives,' he says, 'are most base; yet, without denying this, the husbands express nothing like jealousy on the subject.'

The people accordingly first made another road for wayfarers, and when they had pulled down all the houses the former road was resumed The remains of these buildings are still to be seen near the mosque belonging to Semed of Nezwa and Sahilah. The Imam Ghassan continued to rule uprightly till he was seized with an illness on the 8th of Dzul-Kaadah, in the year 207 [ a.d . 822], of which he died a few days after. His Imamate lasted fifteen years and seven days. Allegiance was then given to 'ABDU-'L-MALIK-BIN-HAMlD. . . . K He was of the Benu-Saudah-bin-'Aly-bin-'Amru-bin-Amir Ma-es-Sama, el-Azdy. He walked in the way of the truth, of justice and integrity, following the good example of his predecessors, who decreed what was right and forbade what was wrong. 'Oman under him enjoyed peace and prosperity. Allegiance was given to him on Thursday, eight days before the end of Shaawal, a.h . 208. He continued his beneficent rule till he grew old and was paralysed. In his time dis turbances used to arise among his soldiers, and the Mussul mans consequently consulted the learned sheikh Musa about deposing him, on account of his age and bodily infirmities. MAsa accordingly advised them to muster the soldiers and to appoint a regent. This was done, and Musa himself having been made regent arrested the evil. ' Abdu-'l-M^likcontinued, however, to reside in his house : he was not deposed, neither did he cease to be respected while he lived. Throughout his reign he was to his people an Imam free from reproach and duplicity. His rule, until he became too infirm for the administration, extended over eighteen years. He was an old man when he was first recognised as Imam. On his death the Mussulmans gave their allegiance to ■ 1 ; 'v 'N1G THE TMAMS OP 'OMAN. EL-MUHBNN A-BIN-JAIF AR, el-fejhy, el-yahmady, el-azdy. He also walked in the way of truth and justice, and fol lowed in the footsteps of his virtuous predecessors, and 'Oman under him was at peace. The Imamate was con firmed to him on Friday, in the month of Rajab, a.h . 22G [a.d . 840]. He was very strict and firm withal. Tso one could utter vain speeches in his councils ; he never preferred one litigant to another; none of his assistants ventured to rise while he was seated; nor did any soldier who received pay approach him without his arms. His anger was tciiil)lo, and sometimes he would gnash his teeth with rage. 1 ho unfortunate victim of his wrath might as well have died at once. His collector was one 'Abdallah-bin-Suleiman, of the Benu-Dhabbah, of Manh, whom he used to employ to collect the cattle-tithe. It is related that this official went to the Mahrah country and there applied to Wasitn -bin-Jaafar, who was bound to pay a couple of three -years'-old camels. 1 The man refused to give more than one, and said : ' If you choose to take it, well; if not, look at these graves of your companions: whenever any of them opposed us, and wanted to force us con trary to our will, we killed them.' 'Abdallah, who had only one man with him, then left the country, and on his arrival at 'Azz of'Oman, where his house was, he sent his companion to the Imam el-Muhenna-bin-Jaifar, whom he found in council at Nezwa. As the Imam was preparing to leave, he called for the messenger and inquired of him about Abdallah and how he had fared on his journey. The man told him in detail about Wasim and all that had occurred; whereupon the Imam ordered him not to divulge the matter to anyone. On the arrival of 'Abdallah the Imam asked him also about Wasim, and finding his companion's story confirmed he i It is clear from the above that the people of Mahrah were tribu tary to 'Oman at this period.THE IMAMS OP ^OMAN. 17 A wrote forthwith to the governor of Adam, and to the governor of Sana, and to the governor of Jaalan, directing them, if possible, to secure Wasim-bin-Jaafar, of Mahrah, and when they had secured him to let him know. He then sent Yahya-el-Yahmady, known as Abu-'l-Mukarish, with a number of horsemen, to apprehend him. Then he dispatched another troop which overtook the first at Menayif; then a third which joined the preceding at the village of 'Azz ; then another which came up with them at the village of Manh. Thus troops were constantly being dispatched in quest of the culprit until he was seized and brought to Nezwa, when the Imam ordered him to be imprisoned. He remained in prison a year, and no one dared to ask the Imam about him, or to intercede in his behalf, until a party came from Mahrah who solicited the el-Yahmady chiefs to procure his liberation. The Imam promised to release him, but required that they should first assent to one of these conditions : first, that they should retire from 'Oman; secondly, that they should de clare war against him; or, thirdly, that they should engage to bring their camels every year to the camp at Nezwa ; that witnesses, to be selected from among the soldiers, should testify that they were all brought and that none were left behind, and that the witnesses should decide at Adam on the just amount of tithe which should be paid. To this they replied: 'As to the first condition, we cannot leave the country; neither, in the second place, can we think of making war upon the Imam ; but we are quite ready to bring our camels as has been proposed, and to pay what has been ordered.' Thereupon the Imam appointed witnesses, and the camels were brought every year and made to go round a pillar which he caused to be erected in the village of Park, as a sign to remind the people of Mahrah of their engagement. At this period Mughirah-bin-Wasin, el-Julandy, with a number of his tribe, rebelled against the Mussulmans, and proceeded to Tawwam-el-Jauf, where Abu-'l-Wadh-dhah was18 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. governor on tlie part of Muhenna-bin-Jaifarj O/iitl killed liim. When the Mussulmans heard thereof, Abu-Marwan, the governor of Sohar, repaired with his people to Tawwam, taking with him el-Mattar, el-Hindy, and his followers of the el-Hindy. On reaching Tawwam they attacked the Benu- Julanda, and God put them to flight. Some were killed and others were scattered in all directions. Then el-Mattar, el-Hindy, and his unruly followers destroyed the hamlet belonging to the Benu-Juldnda with fire. There were camels, oxen and sheep in it at the time, all of which, being tethered, were burnt. It is related that one of el-Mattar s men threw himself into the brook to wet his clothes, and that he then rushed into the fire to try and cut the ropes so that the poor animals might escape. As many as seventy head of cattle were consumed; some say not more than fifty ; but God knows. It is also recorded that some of the women of the Benu-Julanda who had escaped, taking a female servant with them, after remaining a long time in the desert, being greatly pressed for food, sent their servant to the village by night to beg meat and drink. On reaching the village about midnight she obtained a little meal and an empty milk-skin, and took the latter to the brook and filled it with water. One of el-Mattar's men, happening to see her going towards the women with the meal and water, scattered the meal on the sand and poured the water out of the skin. Abu-Marwan, however, had not ordered the burn ing of the hamlet, or any of these outrages; on the contrary, he had forbidden them, but he was disobeyed. It is recorded of the Imam that he sent two officers to the people whose houses had been destroyed and directed that they should be indemnified. The number of the force which accompanied Abu-Marwan is said to have amounted to 12,000 ; but God knows. El -Muhenna held the Imamate till his death, which took place on the 26th of Rabia -el-Akhir, 237 [ a.d . 851]. HeTHE 1A1AMS OF 'OMAN, 19 had ruled ten years and some months and days. His ad ministration was carried on to the satisfaction of the Mussul mans. His tomb is well known at Nezwa. The Mussul mans then gave their allegiance to ES-SALT-BIN-MALIK, el-azdy^ el-kharusy, on the selfsame day whereon his predecessor had died. At that time the most eminent man among the Mussulmans in learning and piety was Muhammad-bin-Mahbub, (may God have mercy upon him !) and they gave their allegiance to es-Salt-bin-Malik, as they had done to his upright prede cessors. He was a lover of truth and justice, and held the Imamate longer than any of the Imams of 'Oman before him, until he became very old and feeble. His principal weak ness was in his legs, but we have no authentic account of the state of his mind, or of his sight and hearing. When his predestined time drew nigh, God chose to try the people of 'Oman as He had tried those before them. Hence it was that MAsa-bin-MAsa and his confederates formed themselves into a party, and the consequence was that disunion arose among the people, and their loyalty towards the Imamate was weakened, and they abstained from frequenting the house of the Imam. 1 Then MAsa-bin-MAsa nominated EASHID-BIN-EN-NADHR to the Imamate, on Thursday, three days before the expira tion of the month of el-Hijj, 273 [ a.d . 886], and the Imam es-Salt died on Thursday, towards the middle of Dzul-Hijj, 275. In his days died also the learned Muhammud-bin- MahbAb, in the town of Sohar, and his tomb is well known there up to this time, a.h . 1274 [ a.d . 1857]. Then serious disturbances arose in ; Oman, and anger and 1 Equivalent to keeping aloof from the Imam's court.20 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. strife increased, and the people were divided in their opinions. The cause was this : when es-Salt was removed from the Imamate, and Rashid-bin-en-Nadhr ruled in his stead, several party conflicts took place in ^Oman. Among these was the battle of el-Rawdhah, in et-Tanuf, wherein Fahm- bin-Warith and Musaab-bin-Suleiman engaged the troops sent against them by Rashid, and were overcome. Also the battle which occurred at er-Rastak, between Suny and Ainy, when Shazan, son of the Imam es-Salt, fought against Rashid, but was vanquished by him. Eventually Musa-bin-Musa with drew from Rashid-bin-en-Kadhr, and did all in his power to mislead, thwart and check him, and at last succeeded in deposing him. 'AZZAN-BIN-TEMIM, el-kharusy, succeeded him on Wednesday, three days before the expira tion of Safar, a.h . 277 [ a.d . 890]. Among those who were present at the swearing of allegiance was Muhammad-bin- Suleiman. Musa and 'Azzan continued on friendly terms for some time, but differences arising between them, 'Azzan removed Musa from the office of Kadhi. Nevertheless, 'Azzan stood in great dread of Musa, and ultimately sent a force against him, composed chiefly of men whom he re leased from prison with that object. These proceeded to Azka, and entering the Hujrah 1 of the en-Nizar began to slaughter the inmates, to steal and plunder, and ended by setting the building on fire, in which several excellent men were burnt to death. Miisa-bin-Musa was also killed near the pebbles close to the stone mosque in the quarter of 1 Hujrah, which primarily means a house or inclosure, is used through out this work to denote a fortified mansion or block-house.

In fact, they committed such out rages upon the people of Azka as were never before heard of. This took place on Sunday, one day before the expira tion of Shaaban, a.h . 278. Insubordination now began to spread far and wide, mutual animosity increased, and each party strove to injure the other as much as posssible. 'Azzan, on his side, cherished his partisans, assigning stipends to those who abetted him, and withdrawing the salaries of such as did not join in the raid on Azka. A movement was now set on foot to avenge that massacre, in which el-Fadhl-bin-el-Khawary, el-Kurashy, en- Nizafy, took the lead, and was joined by the el-Mudhriyyah 1 and the el-Haddan, and also by some of the Benu-Harith from el-Batinah. Fadhl first went to consult with 'Abdallah- el-Haddany in the mountains of the el-Haddan, and then proceeded to Taw warn. He then returned to the el-Haddan, bringing with him el-Khawary-bin-'Abdallah, es-Saluky, and from thence went on to Sohar, on the 23rd of the month. On Friday they attended the Friday prayer, Zebid-bin-Sulei- man leading, after which he addressed the people. Then el- Khawary prayed from the pulpit, and they remained in the mosque all Friday and Saturday. On Saturday night they set forth to attack el-Ahif-bin-Himham, el-Hinay, and his confederates who sided with 'Azzan-bin-Temim; for 'Azzan, on hearing of the projected attack, had dispatched el-Ahif with a party of the el-Y^hmad, among whom was Fahm-bin- Warith. They marched until they reached Mujazz of el- Batinah, from whence they sent for es-Salt-bin-en-Nasr, who joined them with a body of horse and foot. El-Fadhl- bin-el-Khawary and el-Khawary-bin-'Abdallah now hastened to encounter them, and a conflict ensued in which many of the el-Mudhriyyah were slain, and the remainder fled. This 1 El-Mudhriyyah, that is, the descendants of Mudhar, the son of Nizar; hence their near relationship to the Nizariyyah of 'Oman. Sec note, p. 3.22 the imams of 'oman. engagement took place on the 4th of Shawal of the above- named year. Outbreaks and conspiracies went on increasing among the people of 'Oman, and the orders of the Imam were disre garded by them, for they would not listen to the word of God, and refused to walk in the footsteps of their righteous forefathers. Hence their perplexities were multiplied, and so irresolute were they that no less than sixteen councils were assembled, at which nothing was decided. At length what was decreed came to pass. Muhammad-bin-Abi-'l- Kasim, and Beshir-bin-el-Mundhir, of the Benu-Samah-bin- Lawa-bin-Ghalib, went to el-Bahrein, which was at that time under Muhammad-bin-Nur, the agent of el-Mutadhid, 1 the 'Abbaside [Khalifah], to whom they complained of the bitter dissensions which had arisen among them, begging him to join them in an expedition against ^Oman, and making him many promises in the event of his acquiescence. Muhammad- bin-Niir readily assented to their proposals, but suggested that they should first repair to Baghdad, and submit them to the Khalifah in person. Muhammad-bin-Abi-'l-Kasim accordingly went to Baghdad, but Beshir remained with Muhammad-bin-Nur. Muhammad, on reaching the Khali fah el-Mutddhid, submitted the case to him, and after ob taining an order from him, addressed to Muhammad-bin-Nur, directing him to proceed against 'Oman, he returned to el- Bahrein. Thereupon Muhammad-bin-Nur began to collect troops from all the tiibes, and from the nobility of the en- Nizariyyah. He also obtained men from the et-Tai of esh- Sham, so that he was able to set out with a force of 25,000, of which 500 were horsemen, and an equal number of horse men clad in coats of mail, with their attendants and baggage. When intelligence of these proceedings reached ^Oman the whole country was alarmed, fresh dissensions broke out among the people and chiefs, who were at their wits' end, 1 El-Mu'tddhid-b'lllah began to reign a.h . 279 = a.d . 892.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 23 and so great was the general consternation that many left 'Oman with their families and property, thereby laying them selves open to deserved contempt for pusillanimity. Suleiman- bin-^Abdi-^l-Malik, es-Salimy, with some of his followers, went to Hormftz, and the people of Sohar went to Shiraz and el-Basrah, taking their families and goods with them. In the meantime Muhammad-bin-Nur advanced with his troops and took Julfar, from whence he marched to Tawwam, capturing es-Sirr and its neighbourhood, and then started for Nezwa. ^Azzan-bin-Temim, being abandoned by the people, left Nezwa for Semed-esh-Shan, and Muhammad-bin-Nur entered the former town, which surrendered to him at once. He then marched towards Semed-esh-Shan, and came up with 'Azzan-bin-Temim in its vicinity, and a fierce en gagement took place between the two parties on Thursday the 25th of Safar of that year, and the people of 'Oman were worsted and put to flight. ^Azzan-bin-Temim was among the slain, and the country fell into the hands of the conquerors. It was not that God had changed the people, but they had changed themselves through their intestine quaiTels, 1 each party striving for the sovereignty; therefore God gave them up to be ruled over by their enemies. Thus far the rule of the Ibadhiyah, from the time they began to govern until the country was taken from them, had lasted one hundred and s ^ x ty years, all but a month and twelve days; but God knows. 2 Muhammad-bin-Nur sent the head of 'Azzan-bin-Temim to the Khalifah el-Mut&amp;dhid, at Baghdad, and then returned to Nezwa, where he took up his abode. Thereupon el-Ahif- bin-Ilimham, el-Hinav, wrote to all the tribes and people of Oman, urging them to rise up against Muhammad-bin-Nur 1 ' God did not change what was in them until they themselves had changed it.'

Mu- hammad-bin-Nur on hearing this lost heart and took to flight, followed by el-Ahif and his army. It had been de cided, as the best strategy, that no attempt should be made to overtake him, but that he should be allowed to escape. God, however, had decreed otherwise, and in order to fulfil His designs they marched quickly, and came up with him at Daba, 1 where a fierce battle was fought, wherein many were killed on both sides; but Muhammad-bin-Nur fled, and was pursued as far as the sea-coast at es-Sib. 3 At this juncture the enemy was reinforced by a large body of mounted war riors, and others of the el-Mudhriyyah, two men riding on each camel, who were dispatched by ^Obeidah-bin-Mu- hammad, esh-Shamy, to the assistance of Muhammad-bin Niir. On reaching the spot the riders alighted, and seizing their weapons joined Muhammad-bin-N^r in an attack upon el-Ahif and his followers. In this engagement the people of 'Oman were overcome, and el-Ahif with many of his own tribe and others was slain. None were saved except those whose death was deferred. Thereupon Muhammad-bin-Nur returned to Nezwa, and continued to rule over 'Oman with the greatest severity. He dispersed the inhabitants and ravaged the country, destroying much of its cultivation and turning the delight of the people into contempt. He cut off the hands and ears, and scooped out the eyes of the nobles; he inflicted unheard-of tortures and outrages upon the people; he destroyed the water-courses, burnt the books, and utterly desolated 'Oman. 1 Daba, the 'Dibbah' of our charts, a seaport on the east coast of 'Oman.

The latter was informed one day that Abu-^l-Hawaryand some of his companions had been talking about Musa-bin-Musa, whereupon he sent a soldier to summon him to his presence. The soldier found him in the mihrdh 2 of the mosque of Ibn-Said, (known as that of Abu-Kasim)^ belonging to the esh-Shejeby, after the morning prayer^ reading the Kuran. The soldier having announced his errand, Abu-'l-Hawary replied: ' I have no business with him,' and continued reading. The soldier was asto nished and felt at a loss what to do, until a messenger arrived from el-Bujairah directing him not to molest Abu-'l-llawary. Such was the effect of the blessed Kuran. The soldier is related to have said that he had called upon Abu-'l -Hawary to come forth lest the mihrcib should be sprinkled with his blood. El-Bujairah continued to rule over Nezwa until the people rose up against him and killed him. They then dragged his body and buried it below the gate Mawarr, just within the valley, by the side of the road leading to Fark, where they deposit their ashes and rubbish. Thereupon they gave their allegiance to SHEIKH MUHAMMAD-BIN-EL-HASAN, EL-AZDY, EL-KHARUSY, and shortly after deposed him. Next, they vowed allegi ance to 'AZZAN-BIN-EL-HIZK, EL-MALIKY, EL-YAHMADY, whom they also deposed.

In the meantime, however, having elected Muhammad- bin-el-Hasan a second time, they deposed es-8alt. As no fault was found with the former on this occasion he died holding the Imamate. Next, they gave their allegiance to HASAN-BIN-SAID, ES-SAHTANY, who died a month after; then to EL-HAW ARY-BIN-MATRAF, EL-HADDANY, in spite of all opposition. He encouraged the profligate and licentious, and whenever the Sultan 2 came to 'Oman to levy tribute from the inhabitants, he used to resign the Imamate and retire to his private house, and the Sultan took no steps to restrain his tyranny and oppression. On the departure of the Sultan he used to resume the Imamate, saying to those around him : ' the government belongs to God, and &gt; El-K drmaty, that is, belonging to the sect of the Karamitah. A short account of their history and tenets is given in a succeeding note. 2 The author being of the Ibadhiyah sect very rarely gives the title of ' Khalifah' to the sovereigns of the Muslim empire, evidently through fear of being supposed to recognize them as legitimate Successors of Muhammad, which the Ibadhiyah deny. By the Sultan coming to 'Oman probably nothing more is meant than that he sent a representative into that country. The ' Sultan of Bagh dad' specially indicated was either el-Muktafy-b'llluh or el-Muktadhir- b'lllah, successors to el-Mu'tadhid, a.d . 902-932.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 27 those who disobey are guilty of revolt against God.' His agent with the Sultan was one Yasir of the Benu-Samah. (The Sultan here referred to is the Sultan of Baghdad.) They then deposed him and bestowed the Imamate upon his nephew, ^OMAR-BIN-MUHAMMAD-BIN-MATRAF, who followed the example of his uncle, for whenever the Sultan's agent came he submitted to him and resigned the Imamate, resuming it again with full powers when the agent left. Then came the Karamitah, 1 whose increasing numbers in 1 The KarAmitah began to raise disturbances in the Muslim empire about a.h . 276= a.d . 889. Opinions differ as to the correct origin of the designation. The followers of this sect bore an inveterate hatred to Mussulmans generally, pretending that their own founder was a true prophet, who had given them a new law which abrogated all preceding revelations, and which allowed them to drink wine and to dispense with many of the requirements of Islam. They further turned the precepts of the Kuran into allegory, teaching that prayer was the symbol of obe dience to their Imam, and fasting that of concealing their doctrines from strangers. Under several fanatical leaders they caused continued annoyance to successive Khalifahs, committing great outrages in 'Irak, Arabia Syria and Mesopotamia, and at length established a formidable principality, whose power was at its meridian under Abu-Tahir, renowned for his capture of Mekkah, a.h . 317, and the indignities perpetrated upon the Ka'abah by his soldiery. The el-Bahrein branch of the sect, to which Abu-Tahir belonged, and which is specially referred to in the text, recognized his father, Abu-Sa'id, as its first chief. According to Nowairy, quoted by De Sacy, ' Abu-Sa'id attempted the conquest of that country, but a detachment of six hundred men whom he sent on the expedition having been nearly exterminated by the people of 'Oman, he abandoned the project.' Abu-Sa'id was murdered in a bath by one of his eunuchs, a.h . 301 a.d . 913. He was succeeded by his son Abu-'l-Kasim Sa'id, who was shortly after displaced by his brother, the famous Abu-Tahir. The malediction invoked upon the Karamitah by the author is a conclusive proof that their tenets had nothing in common with the sect to which he belonged, namely, the Ibadhiyah, with whom Palgrave associates them. {Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii, pp. 262, 264.) For an exhaustive essay on the origin and history of the28 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 'Oman prevGiited 'Omar from ever again exercising the functions of Imam. The Karamitah had already overrun many countries, and had seized the supreme power at Mckkah and in Syria, where the tribes and their chiefs submitted to them, and all the surrounding countries stood in awe ot them, for wherever they went violence and depravity accompanied them. They were followers of Abu-Said-el-Hasan, el- Janaby, 1 who abolished prayer, and fasting, and the pil grimage, and the ZaUh? Moreover, el-Hasan arrogated to himself such attributes that the weakminded exalted him into a god, other than the only true God, who, according to the doctrines of these tyrants, had bestowed the highest honour upon him. His career was brought to a close (may God's curse rest upon him!) by 'Abdallah-bin-'Aly, who with a force of 400 men defeated his large army after a struggle which lasted seven years. With this overthrow the govern- ment of the Karamitah came to an end. After an interval of several years, during which there was no Imam in 'Oman, the Imamate was conferred on MUHAMMAD-BIN-YEZID, EL-KINDY, 3 but he was subsequently deposed, on the plea that the ap pointment was made by violence; (at this period the Sultan Karamitah, see De Sacy's Introduction to his Expose de la Religion des Druzes, pp. Ixiii-ccxxiii.

Abulfeda says: 'Junnabah, or, as Ibn-Hallika,n writes it, Jannabah, is a small town of el-Bahrein, from whence sprang Abu-Sa'id, el-Junnaby, the libertine, the Karmaty, who attacked the Ilijj and killed many of thera. ,, Takwim-el-Bidddn. 2 ZaMh : obligatory alms for pious uses, such as building mosques, 3 The el-Kindah were a Yemeny tribe, the issue of Kindah the off spring of 'Odad, the son of Kahlan, the son of 'Abd-Shems-Saba, the son of Himyar.

They then gave the Imamate to the MULLAH-EL-BAHARY. who resided at Saal of Nezwa; but not being satisfied with him they deposed him.

Ibn-Kaisar says : ' I have not been able to find the date when allegiance was given to him, nor how long he retained the Imamate.'' In another place he says; ' I have dis covered that the first who gave his allegiance to the Imam Said-bin-'Abdallah was el-Hawary-bin-'Othman, and, after him, 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad-bin-Abi-'l-Muathir. This appointment also was made in spite of much opposition. Then, quoting from Ruh, (may God be merciful to him !) he states that &lt;e the Imam Said-bin-'Abdallah was more learned than any of those who swore fealty to him, and than any of his compeers.' And, again; ' W e know ot none among the Imams of 'Oman superior to feaid-bin- 'Abdallah, for he was a learned and upright Imam, and died ramaut to Nejriln and el-Yamamah, and were divided into numerous sub-tribes, one of which, the es-Sak&amp;sik, is named in a subsequent part of these annals as having representatives in 'Oin&amp;n.

On the other hand, the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Said-bin-Abi-Bekr says: ' the Imam Said-bin-^Abdallah was far superior to Julanda- bin-Mas'ud, who is not to be compared to him, for he was an upright Imam, and was far in advance of his cotemporaries in learning. Moreover, he died a martyr.' He further gives the following account of the manner in which the Imam Said-bin-'Abdallah came by his death, which is said to have occurred a.h . 328 [ a.d . 939]; but God knows. A woman of el-Ghashb, of er-Eastak, was drying grain in the sun when a sheep came and began eating it; in order to drive it away she threw a stone which broke the sheep's leg; thereupon the woman who owned the animal commenced beating her. The latter screamed for aid, and a large concourse of people soon joined both sides and a serious conflict took place. On hearing this the Imam Said-bin-'Abdallah approached, ac companied by a soldier, intending to act as a mediator be tween the combatants, but somehow or other he fell in the scuffle. After him allegiance was given to E ASHID-BIN-EL-WALID on this wise :—there assembled together sheikh ' Abdallah- bin -Muhammad-bin-Abi-'l-Muathir, and Naaman-bm-Ab- du-'l-Hanrid, and Abu -Muhammad-'Abdallah-bin-Muham- mad-bin-Salih, and Abu-'l -Mundhir-bin -Abi -Muhammad- bin-IUih. These men were looked up to at that time with the same confidence and respect as were those of the assembly who gave their allegiance to the Imam Said -bin-'Abdallah. None questioned their virtue or ignored their probity, for they were the most eminent of their class. Thus there arc men forthcoming to suit all times, just as there is a rhyme for every word, and contemporaries are never wanting to extol their virtues, having full confidence in them. The man ot 1 See ante, p. 7.the imams of 'oman. 31 to-day stands upon the foot-print of his predecessor. The former has nothing to envy, nor the latter anything to re nounce. The above-named met in the house of Rashid-bin-el-Walid, at Nezwa, under the presidency of Abu-Muhammad-'Abdal- lah-bin-Muhammad-bin-Abi-'l-Muathir, and after one and all had agreed to disavow the principles which had actuated Musa-bin-Musa and Rashid-bin-en-Nadhr 1 and produced such disasters in the government, they gave their allegiance to Rashid-bin-el-Walid. Then they went forth to the people on the plain of Nezwa, where a large concourse of the people of ^Oman from Nezwaand all the towns to the east of'Oman and elsewhere were assembled, consisting of the elite of the population of every rank, and all gave their submission to him. In none was there the least sign of disaffection or disloyalty. Then Abu-Muhammad-'Abdallah-bin-'Abdallah- bin-Muhammad-bin-Saihah stood up and proclaimed him Imam, and called upon the people to give him their allegi ance, which they did freely and openly, not one dissented nor did any appear to envy. The people, who were collected in crowds, had come singly and in pairs, and the Imam took their promises and engagements. He then appointed col lectors and governors over all the towns and districts, and led the Friday prayer at Nezwa. He and his collectors re ceived the Sadalcdt 2 , he organized the army, reformed the ad ministration and carried his reforms into execution, and, as far as God pleased, the towns and districts acknowledged him. In fact, there was not a town left in ^Oman which recognized any other authority, which did not submit to his administra tion, and did not give him its allegiance. On the other hand, in his conduct of public affairs as Imam he manifested the most unswerving integrity, plainly showing that there was neither violence nor culpability in hie acts to make him afraid, 1 See ante, p. 20. 2 Sadakdt, i. e., voluntary alms given for religious purposes.32 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. and that he was not actuated by love of gain or self-interest to call forth any dissimulation on his part; on the contrary, he was the friend of his subjects, tolerant of their opinions, gentle towards their waywardness, indulgent towards their failings, long-suffering towards their crimes, and ever ready to benefit them. He was impartially just towards high and low, rich and poor, great and small, condescending to all, diligent in looking into their affairs, making himself equal with those below him, and gladly listening to the counsels of those who advised him. He persevered in the same course even when driven by his people to endure misfortune, sepa ration from enjoyments and friends, reproach and injury, contumely and defamation, bearing all these things patiently, and praying that the result might confound the abettors of mischief. Many of his subjects who entertained the most malevolent designs against him were anxious that some evil might befall him ; for the devil had been busy with them, and envy and malice had got the better of them, until the course of affairs turned against him. Then the decree of God was fulfilled in the disaffection of the generality of the people and the rebellion of most of the chiefs, who maligned him to the Sultan, to whom they made overtures and whom they prepared to meet in order to cooperate with him, assembling themselves together for that purpose. He did all he could to prevent this, which led to fresh dissensions, and they de parted from Behla in a body. The Sultan was now aproach- ing from es-Sirr, whilst the Imam^s party was left few in number, the majority having abandoned him. Nevertheless, he set out from Nezwa, in order to prevent them from join ing the Sultan ; but when he found to what extent he had been abandoned, and how bitter was the enmity against him, he perceived at once that he was unable to encounter the Sultan. So, fearing that he might be suddenly overpowered if he remained where he was, he fled with his adherents from Behla to Kadam, hoping that they might be safe there. HeTHE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 33 remained atKddam until lie heard that his enemies had entered el-Jauf, 1 when he departed from thence with his scanty fol lowers to the Wadi-^l-Bahar, where he rallied together all the chiefs and nobles who were still loyal to his cause, and, by the aid of God, was enabled to maintain that position. At this time the Sultan and his nobles were at Nezwa, but by the advice of those who were with him and sympathized with him Rashid-bin-Walid did not attack them, trusting that such forbearance on his part towards the Mussulmans and his own countrymen would tend to strengthen his cause and ultimately give him the victory. He therefore stopped short at Nezwa, close to the road leading to the ^Akabat- Fih, 2 and not far from the the Sultan el-Jair's 3 army. But what God had foreordained came to pass : his adherents attacked the enemy and were overcome, whereupon they fled and were scattered in all directions. This engagement took place at dawn, and by the evening of the same day he was abandoned by all his followers, and in utter despair of re ceiving any aid from his people. The Sultan el-Jai'r now seized upon the whole country, the people on their part doing all in their power to conciliate him, while the Sultan 1 El-Jauf, according to the information obtained by Niebuhr, is a small town on the borders of the desert, about forty miles to the south east of Nezwa. Wellsted does not notice it in his Travels in Arabia. The author repeatedly remarks in the sequel that the town is vulgarly called ' el-Jau.' 2 'Akabah, (in construct case, 'Akabat,) means the summit of a moun tain or a steep declivity; sometimes a difficult pass which is easily de fended against an enemy. There are many such localities in the moun tainous parts of 'Omjin, generally bearing distinctive names. 3 The lieutenant of one of the Abbaside Khalifahs is probably alluded to in this passage, but I am at a loss to determine which of them is in dicated. The designation ' el-Jair,' (the Tyrant), is evidently a nick name. As the Imam Sa'id-bin-'Abdallah, Rashid-bin-Walid's prede cessor, is said to have died a.h . 328, and el-Khalil-bin-Shadzan to have succeeded him about a.h . 405, it must have been one of the five Khali fahs who reigned during that interval. The principal Arabian histo rians throw no light on the affairs of 'Oman at this period.34 the imams op ^oman. el-Jair on his part used every species of dissimulation, until he succeeded in inducing all the districts to submit to him. Meanwhile the Imam was a fugitive among the moun tains and ravines, commiserated by the Sultan and people, dreading by night that some misfortune would befall him, and awaking in the morning to find himself cut oft from rela tives and home, while his people were secure in their dwell ings, doing homage to their Sultan. Finding there was no way open to him to make another attempt, and no other alternative, he consulted with men of discretion, and, acting on their advice, he decided to make his submission. He ac cordingly returned to his residence and sent in his submis sion. Thereupon a messenger was sent to him from the Sultan, assuring him of perfect immunity. It is stated that the promise was given by word only and not on oath. It appears, further, that the Imam never made himself of those who frequented the court of the Sultan, although the latter frequently urged him to do so. Ilius his Iniamate came to an end, and his authority passed into the hands of another. As far as we know, no one has ever spoken evil of his ad ministration, or reflected on him for the vicissitudes which occurred during his Imamate. He lived a little longer, held in general esteem, and died deplored by all. One author states that Abu -Muhammad-'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad-bin- Abi-'l-MuSthir was killed at the battle of el-Ghashb, during the lifetime of Eashid-bin-el-Walid, and while loyal to him. To proceed : When the commotions consequent upon the invasion of the Abbaside Khalifahs had subsided in Oman, and they ceased to send reinforcements thither, owing to re volt within their own territories, 1 the chiefs of 'Oman con ferred the Imamate on 1 Judging from the context, the period here referred to was some years prior to a.h . 400= a.d . 1009.

He was an upright man, and walked in the footsteps of his virtuous predecessors, to the great satisfaction of the people. He was impartial in his judgment between high and low, rich and poor, and through his wise administration 'Oman enjoyed peace and prosperity. He restrained injus tice and tyranny, lived beloved by his subjects, and died re vered. His rule extended over forty years and some months. After him allegiance was given to EASHID-BIN-SAiD. He also walked in the good way of his predecessor and imitated him in his praiseworthy life. He died in the month of Muharram, a.h . 445 [ a.d . 1053]. The Imamate was then conferred on his son, H AF S-BIN -EASHID-BIN-S AID, who only held it for a short time, when he was called away by death. They then appointed RASHID-BIN-^ALY, praised by high and low for his excellent qualities. He re strained the vicious and tyrannical, and died in the month of el-Kaadah, a.h . 446. After him allegiance was given to nized rulers of the same family; Mesopotamia acknowledged the el- Ilamdany sovereigns ; Egypt and Syria had revolted; Africa had been conquered by the Fatimites ; Spain was governed by a descendant of the house of Omeyyah; the Karamitah held el-Yamamah and el-Bahrein; the Khalifahs had been obliged on several occasions to abandon Bagh dad ; in fact, although the Abbaside dynasty continued to exist nomi nally for 250 years afterwards, it was too weak even at the beginning of the eleventh century of the Christian era to retain any of its foreign conquests.3G the imams of 'oman.

He died a.n. 549 [a.d. 1154], 1 and was buried by the watercourse of el- 'Antak, near Nezwa, close by the Jebel Dzu-^l-Junud. His death was a great loss to the people of 'Oman. They then appointed MALIK-BIN AL Y-EL-HAW ARY, a.h. 809 [a.d. 1406] who died some months after the year 833 [ a.d . 1429]. The author of the work Kashf -el-Ghummah says and other historians of ^Oman make a similar statement—' I have met with no account of any Imam during these two hundred and odd years. Whether the Imamate was in abeyance during that time, or whether the names of the Imams have been lost to us, God only knows.' He goes on to say, however, that he had found an account of an expedition dispatched against 'Oman by the people of Shiraz, under Fakhr-ed-Din-Ahmed-bin-ed-Dtiyah and Shi- hab-ed-Din, with 4,000 and 500 horse [respectively], which did endless damage to the country. On arriving at Nezwa they drove out thence the people of el-'Akr, 2 and took pos session of their houses. After remaining four months m 'Oman they proceeded to Behla, which place they besieged, but could not prevail against it. About this time Ibn-ed- Dayah died, and there was a great famine in the land.

Mahmud came in a ship to Kalhat 2 and summoned Abu-^l-Maaly to his presence. On his 1 We shall see presently that after the death of the Imam Abu- Jjibir, a.h . 549, and until the appointment of Malik-bin-'Aly, a.h. 809, 'Oman was nominally governed by Maliks or Kings of the Benu- Nebhan. It was during their rule that this invasion from Shiraz took place. Supposing the date given, namely, a.h . 664 = a.d . 1265, to be correct, the invaders were probably Moghuls, who at that period were masters of the whole of Persia. As Hulaku Khan, their sovereign, died A.n. 663, the expedition was probably dispatched by Abaka Khan, his son and successor. 4 Kalhut, the Kalaios of the author of the PeriplUs, is a seaport on the eastern coast of 'Oman, about twenty miles north-west of Sur. It appears to have been the principal rendezvous for native ships plying between the Pe r sian Gulf and India at a very early period. El-'Idrisy mentions it in connection with Sur. Marco Polo, who calls it ' Calaiati,' says it is a ' large city, situated in a gulf called also Calatu.

Thereupon the King sends an army to force him. He leaves Ormus and comes to this city of Calaiati, which is so situated that it can prevent any ship from entering or leaving, so that the King of Chermain losing his tribute and receiving much damage is obliged to come to terms with the said Melich. {Ra- inusio, vol. ii, p. 59.) As Marco Polo travelled between a.d . 1271- 1294, this extract corroborates the general tenour of the author's narra tive, showing that some parts at least of the seacoast of 'Oman were at that period directly tributary to the ruler at Ilormuz and indirectly to the Moghuls who held Kerman. Ibn-Batuta visited Kalhat a.h . 729 = a.d . 1328, and it is noteworthy, as confirming what is stated above about38 the imams of 'oman. arrival he demanded of him the revenues of ^Oman and tribute from its inhabitants. Abu-'l-Maaly excused himself from payment on the ground that he only possessed one town in 'Oman. Whereupon Mahmud offered him as many soldiers as were necessary to enable him to enforce his demand; but el-Maaly urged that the people were too poor to pay, and moreover that any such demand would cause great dis turbances among them. Mahmud now determined to effect his object by stratagem, and accordingly sent for all the Amirs of the Bedawin of 'Oman, whom he invested with robes of honour, and to whom he gave presents, on condition of their joining him against 'Oman. He himself then took ship and went to Zhafar, 1 which he plundered, killing many of the inhabitants, and returned to Kalhat with a large booty. Leaving some of his party with the ships, he proceeded by land with the remainder. They lost their way in the sand, and were driven to such extremities for want of provisions and water that the price of a mann~ of meat rose as high as the government of the country at that time by the Benu-Nebhan, that he calls the Sultan of 'Oman ' an Arab of the el-Azd, named Abu- Muhammad-ibn-Nebhan.

It was burnt by Albuquerque in 1508, at which time it is described as ' a beautiful strong town, but not so populous as heretofore, whose buildings are after the style of those in Spain.'

I saw them with my own eyes in the year 1257 [ a.d . 1841].- The author of the Kashf-el-Gliuimmcih also states—and other writers make a similar statement—' I have read in another history that the Awlad-er-Rais invaded 'Oman in the month of Shawal, a.h . 675 [ a.d . 1276], during the rule of Kahlan -bin-'Omar-bin-Nebhan, who went out to meet them in the plain with a large number of the people of el-'Akr in different parts of the East.

The Hormuz referred to was undoubtedly the petty kingdom, of Arab origin, on the continent of Persia; for the city called by the same name, and situated on the island of Jerun (Abulfeda calls it Zarun) opposite, was not founded till a.h . 700 — a.d . 1300.

They also burnt the shops attached to the mosque, committing all these outrages in the course of half a day. But on the first of el-Kaadah of the same year, Kahlan marched against them with an army of seven thousand men and entirely routed them and their allies of the el-Haddan, killing three hundred of them. 1 He then adds: ' Theinterval between Muhammad-bin-Khanbash 2 and Malik-bin-el-Hawary probably exceeded five hundi^ed years, during which time the administration was in the hands of the Benu-Nebhan, after whom came the Imams [again], the former being kings over some portions of ^Oman, whilst other parts were under the latter.' All this, and much more, I have related in the work to which I have given the title es-Sahifat-el-KaJdaniyyah. I shall now proceed to give a few extracts respecting the Benu-Nebhan, premising that their kings were men of great renown in ^Oman, who attained pre-eminence by their mighty acts and successful wars. I shall not attempt to enumerate all on account of their number, although the reign of each is conspicuous for some special glory in the annals of ^Oman. 1 This does not seem to have been a foreign invasion but merely an attack on 'Oman proper by the ' descendants of er-Rais,' apparently the name of a tribe, intimately related to the Benu-Nebhan, located in one of the adjoining provinces. 2 The author has not recorded an Im&amp;m of that name in the preceding pages; but he mentions a Men&amp;zil-bin-Khdnbash (p. 9) as having been a collector in 'Oman about a.h . 145. Malik-bin-el-llawary succeeded to the Imamate, a.h . 809. See p. 36.KINGS OF THE BENU-NEBHAN. 41 KINGS OF THE BENU-NEBHAN.i EL-FELLAH-BIN-EL-MUHSIN is the most renowned of the kings of the Benu-Nebhan for liberality, integrity and statesmanship. He resided at Makniyat/ in the district of es-Sirr, and built the lofty and impregnable fort there, and called it el-Aswad [the Black Fort]. It was he also who introduced the mango tree into Makniyat, having been led to do so from the accounts which he had heard of the excellence of its fruit. The tree was subsequently spread over 'Oman, where it had not been pre viously known. El-Fellah was a patron of poets and poetry, and was eulogized by many of the poets of his day. On his death he was succeeded by his son, ' AR AR- BIN-EL-FELL AH- BIN-EL-MUH SIN, who resembled his father in goodness and generosity. He died ten days before the expiration of el-Hijj, a.h . 99. 3 After him came MUZHAFFIR-BIN-SULEIMAN-BIN-SULEIMAN, who only reigned two months and then died. He was suc ceeded by 1 A short account of the origin of the Benu-Nebhan is given in the Introduction. What follows under this head consists of detached frag ments, of uncertain date, but presumably posterior to the invasion of 'Om&amp;n from Hormuz. The author here represents the Benu-Nebhan as exercising some degree of authority up to a.h. 1026 = a.d. 1617. 3 Makniyat seems to have been the capital of the Benu-Nebhan. Wellsted describes it as having, been once a large city but now a very insignificant place. The Wahhabis invaded it in 1800, when they seized the castle, burnt the houses, and destroyed most of the trees in its vici nity.

MAKHZUM-BIN-EL-FELLAH-BTN-EL-MUHSIN, against whom rose up Nebhan-bin-el-Fellali, who drove him out of Behla and made over its fort to his cousin J Aly-bin- Dz&amp;hal, with whom was associated Seif-bin-Muhammad. He then went to Makniyat and took possession of its fort. Next he expelled his cousin Sultan-bin-Himyar from Behla, fearing- lest he might seize the fort there by stratagem; whereupon Sultan-bin-Himyar went to Sohar. (Behla was now in the hands of ^Aly-bin-Himyar [Dzahal ?], and Seif- bin-Muhammad was its governor.) He then went to Nezwa but returned to Behla again and occupied el-'Akr with his followers. Seif-bin-Muhammad was at the village of Sait at the time, but on hearing what had occurred he moved with his men and entered the fort without opposition, and sent to inform Nebhan-bin-el-Fellah that the forces [of the enemy ?] had entered the district, requesting him at the same time to proceed thither with his followers, where he himself would hold on to collect reinforcements. Meanwhile 'Omair-bin- Himyar had seized all the fortifications of the country. Seif- bin-Muhammad still continued in the fort waiting for the arrival of Nebhan and his followers, but as they did not come he began to despair of succour and therefore evacuated the fort, taking with him all the arms, and occupied the villasfe. After 'Omair had been a short time in the fort of Behla he sent to Seif-bin-Muhammad, begging him to detach himself from Nebhan-bin-el-Fellah and to join him. To this he consented, and an offensive and defensive alliance was entered into between them, confirmed by an oath on both sides. Thereupon 'Omair-bin-Himyar appointed Seif-bin- Muhammad governor over the fort of Bchla, promoting him above all his cousins. This step, however, created no ani mosity between Seif and them. At that time Sultan-bin-Himyar, and Muhenna-bin- Muhammad-bin-Hafizh, and 'Aly-bin-Dzahal-bin-Muham-KINGS OF THE BENU-NEBHAN. 43 mad-bin-Hafizh resided at Sohar with Muhammad-bin-.Mii- henna, el-Hadify, who offered to take them to their cousin Nebhan-bin-Fellah at Makniyat, in order to effect a reconcili ation between them. (Makhzura-bin-el-Fellah was engaged at this period in building the fort at Yankal.) The recon ciliation between the cousins not having been effected, Sultan-bin-Himyar and 'Aly-bin-Dzahal, with their respective followers, went from Semail to Behla, and the former took up his abode in the building belonging to the Benu-Salt. He was soon after attacked by ^Omair-bin-liimyar accompa nied by Seif-bin-Muhammad, and a fight took place between them; but as Sultan-bin-Himyar had strengthened the build ing to withstand a siege the assailants were repulsed. Thereupon ^Omair-bin-Himyar summoned all his adherents from the villages, and sheikh Said-bin-Ahmed, en-Naaby, with a party of men from Nezwa and Manh went forth against Sultan-bin-Himyar and surrounded him as completely as the halo surrounds the moon. Seeing that it was useless to re sist, he asked for quarter and was allowed by sheikh Said- bin-Ahmed to depart unmolested with his followers, taking their arms with them. He then went to ezh-Zhaliirah, and together with 'Aly-bin-Dz4hal and Muhammad-bin-Hatizh remained a considerable time at Makniyat, but Nebhan becoming suspicious of them he sent them thence and they repaired to Mombasah, 1 where they joined Muhammad-bin- Muhenna, el-Hadify, and abode with him a year. Sultan- bin-Himyar then proposed to Muhammad-bin-Muhenna, el-Hadify, that he should invade the estate of 'Omair- bin-Himyar, situated in the town of es-Sib, in el-J3atinali, which was occupied by Sinan -bin-Sinan-bin-Sultan and ? Aly-bin-Himyar and his brother Said-bin-Himyar, Accord ingly, Muhammad-bin-Muhenna and Sultan-bin-Hi my ar, with their followers, started from Sohar to attack the place. News of this having reached Sinan and the two brothers, 1 There appears to be a locality so called in Omiiu.44. THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. the sons of 'Omair, they prepared to encounter them, and a desperate hand-to-hand battle was fought in which 'Aly-bin- Himyar and many of his adherents were slain ; whereupon Muhammad-bin-Muhenna returned to Sohar. When 'Omair- bin-Himyar, who was at Behla, heard what had befallen his brothers and cousin he made a solemn vow that he would not be quits with Sohar until he had reaped it with the sword, or burnt the place with fire and scattered its people in every direction. He began forthwith to collect troops both by sea and land, and went in person to Maskat in order to obtain a levy from thence. He also sent to the Malik of Hormiiz who joined him with a number of men in ships. At this juncture a vessel from India, bound for Persia, having many soldiers on board fully equipped for war, was driven by stress of weather into Maskat. ^Omair seized the ship, and having made prisoners of the soldiers took them on with him to the town of es-Sib. After he had been there some days, Muhammad-bin-Jufair, whose residence was at es-Sib, hearing of his presence set off with his followers to the assistance of Muhammad-bin-Muhenna at Sohar, and was received by him into the fort with great delight. After he had been in the fort some time, ambition prompted him to take possession of it, and he accordingly gave directions to one of his slaves to seize Muhammad-bin-Muhenna, who had gone out on business, while his followers, some of whom were in one of the towers, should proceed to capture the fort. Thereupon an alarm was raised and a fierce contest ensued which ended in the retirement of Muhammad-bin-Jufair and his party. When intelligence of this outbreak reached 'Omair-bin- Himyar, he set forth with his followers both by sea and land, and reached Sohar on the 9th of Rabia-el-Akhir. The fight lasted from morning till evening of that day without any advantage having been gained by either party. A day or two after the Christians were landed from the ships withKINGS OP THE BENU-NEBHAN. 45 their arnis, and, in advancing to the attack, they caused a fence of cotton to be driven before them to protect them from the shot of the garrison. When they approached the fort they opened fire on it with their guns, and they had one gun which went on wheels. -A.t one angle of the enclosure Avas the tower of Muhammad-bin-Muhenna, which was occupied by a large body of men. The Christians made towards this point, pushing forward their cotton fences, firing all the while, until a breach was effected, when the defenders evacu ated it and the Christians entered. On hearing that, Mu hammad-bin-Muhenna rallied his followers, and there was a severe conflict between the two sides that night, wherein , Aly-bin-Dzahal and Muhammad-bin-Muhenna, el-Hadify, were slain. When 'Omair -bin-Himyar heard of their death he collected his troops and marched to Sohar, and the two parties meet- in o- in the centre of the town there was a fierce battle be- O tween them, which resulted in the overthrow of Sultan-bin- Himyar and the loss of many of his followers. Many also of the inhabitants of Sohar were killed. r i hereupon 'Omair re turned to the town of Semiiil greatly delighted. At this period Makhzum-bin-Fellah [the nominal king of the Nebhan] held the fort of Yankal. He seized two of the people, killing one and wounding the other, ihe latter was looked upon as dead, but a man of \ankal approached him by night, carried him to his house, tended and fed him till he recovered, when he sent him away, and the man lived a long time after. 1 When Nebhan-bin-Fellah heard of the death of his brother he went from Makniyat to Yankal, placed a governor there of his own and then returned to Makniyat, where he had already resided thirty months since his departure from Behla. 1 I am at a loss to understand this passage. It ■would appear from what follows that Makhzum was the victim, or that he died about the same time.IIS ■■Vv w;» . v v-'v.! [ 4,' &gt;.■ r * i '* : *v. 1 .

These had become so weary of his tyranny and oppression that they determined to stir up the people to put an end to him; they accordingly dispatched a messenger to ^Omair-bin-Himyar and another to Seif-bin- Muhammad, el-Hinay, to join them. On their arrival with their followers they entered the fort without any opposition, and some days after a detachment from both parties started for Yankal. On learning this, Nebhan-bin-Fellah fled with four men to the domain of his uncles of the Riydyisah. 1 This occurred on the 12thofSafar, a.h . 1026 [ a.d . 161 7]. 3 'Omair- bin-Himyar and Seif-bin-Muhammad remained at Yankal for some days and made over the district to the inhabitants, in order that they might enjoy the benefits of it. He then went to Makniyat, where he assembled the people together, and inquired what Nebhan used to exact from them. On hearing that he used to take one half of the produce of the date-trees, and one quarter of the harvests of grain, he re duced the rate to one tenth of the produce, and assigned the Beit-el-Mal 3 for the support of the garrison of the fort, over 1 A plural form of Rais, equivalent to ' Awlad-er-Rais,'a tribe already mentioned in the narrative. 2 It is difficult to r econcile several of the statements made in the fore going narrative with the fact, which the author himself confirms in the sequel, that Mdskat and Sohar were in the hands of the Portuguese at this period. However, as in most of their conquests in those parts they were generally satisfied with holding the principal defences, and allowed the native rulers to carry on the internal administration of their re spective districts so long as they paid tribute to the king of Portugal, often cooperating with them in their intestine feuds, it is just possible that there is a substratum of truth in the account of the assistance ren dered to one party by the Christians, obviously Portuguese. A notable instance of the intervention of the latter in behalf of their tributaries is recorded by Faria y Sousa, a.d . 1521, when being themselves masters of llormuz they joined the ' king' of that place in an expedition against Mukrim, his vassal of ' Lasah,' (el-Hasa,) to oblige him to pay his usual tribute for the island of el-Bahrein and el-Katif on the mainland. See Kerr's Voyages and Travels, vol. vi. pp. 188-90. 3 Beit-el-Mal means the Government Treasury, that is, the State Keve-kinqs of the benu-nebhan. 47 wliich ho placed 'Omair-bin-Muhammad-bin-Abi-Said, and then, accompanied by Seif-bin-Mnhammad, returned to Behla. Whilst these events were in progress, Nebhan-bin-Fellah, with a force supplied by his uncles of the Awlad-er-Rais, entered the district of ezh-Zhahirah and alighted at Taw- wam. A few days after, one of his principal adherents at Yankal came with offers of assistance, declaring that if he would make the attempt he and his partisans would open the fort to him. He accordingly marched with his men and entered Yankal by night, towards the middle of Rabia-el- Akhir, a.h . 1026, and succeeded in taking all the defences, with the exception of the fort, then garrisoned by the Benu- 'Aly, and, as they would not surrender, Nebhan laid siege to it, which led to frequent skirmishes between the two parties. One of the garrison was then dispatched to K^tan-bin-Kiitan and Nasir-bin-Nasir, the Hilalis, who resided at that time with the Bedawin of the esh-Shamal, to summon them to the aid of 'Omair-bin-Himyar, en-Nebhany, and he was accom panied by Muhammad-bin-Jufair, who held the fort on be half of Nebhan-bin-Fellah. The contest was shortly after renewed between the besiegers and the besieged, which re sulted in the complete overthrow of the former, some of whom were slain, some asked for quarter, and the remainder were scattered over the country in all directions. When Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-Hinay, heard that Nebhan- bin-Fellah had entered Yankal, he set out with his troops to attack him, but learning on the way what had befallen him he returned to Behla. At this period 'Omair-bin-Himyar was busy collecting troops to aid the Sultan Malik-bin-Abi-^l- 'Arab, el-Yaaruby, against the Benu-Lamk. He succeeded nue from tithes, zakah or obligatory alms, derelict property, and property to which there is no other legal heir, and was designed originally to be expended in providing for the poor, prosecuting ' holy wars,' and other enterprises for the public welfare. In the above instance it was to be applied to the support of the local garrison.48 THE IMAMS OF OMAN. in overcoming them, whilst Seif-bin-Muhammad remained at Behla. .■ The misrule of the Benu-Nebhan had caused such wide spread evils throughout 'Oman, that in order to put a stop to their tyranny and oppression the heads of the people assembled together seven years after the death of Malik- bin-el-Hawary, 1 on a Thursday in the month of Ramadhan, 839 [ a.d . 1435], and appointed as his successor ABU-'L-HASAN-'ABDALLAH-BIN-KHAMIS- BIN-'AMIR, el-azdy, who died on the 21st of Dzul-Kaadah, a.h . 846 [ a.d . 1442], without reproach. They then conferred the Imamate on ^OMAR-BIN-KHATTAB-BIN-MUHAMMAD-BIN- AHMED-BIN-SHADZAN-BIN-SALT, el-tahmady, el-azdy, el-kharusy, in the year 835. 2 He it was who collected the property of the Benu-Kebhan and conferred it on those who had any claims against them. This matter was adjudged as follows : The assembled Mussulmans met together, and after estimat ing the blood which had been shed by the Benu-Nebhan and the property which they had unjustly appropriated, the value was found to be in excess of all their available 1 Malik-bin-el-IIawary died a.h. 833, (see ante, p. 36.) It appears from what follows that although the Benu-Nebhan were no longer supreme over 'Oman, they nevertheless continued to make efforts to regain their ascendancy up to the Imamate of Nasir-bin-Murshid, a.h. 1034= a.d . 1624. 2 This date here is obviously incorrect, as his predecessor died a.h. 846. Judging from two dates further on, this should probably be 80;').the imams of 'oman. 49 assets. Sheikh Muhamraad-bin-Suleiman-bin-Ahmed-bin- Mufarraj, who was the Kadhi at the time, acted as AVakil on behalf of those who had suffered at the hands of the Al- Nebhan. His decision was, that everything pertaining to them, their land, date-trees, houses, arms, utensils, pro duce, and whatever else they possessed, was Beit-Mai. 1 Sheikh Muhammad-bin-'Omar, on the other hand, is said to have ruled as follows : the property submitted for adjudica tion belongs in strict justice to all those of the people of ^Oman who have been injured, whether alive or dead, old or voung, male or female; but as the whole of the claims are unknown, and it would therefore be impossible to adjudge to each its proper share, and as all property which cannot be rightly apportioned must be considered as having no owner, the property in question goes to the poor. The just Imam, however, who took the precedence over all the nobles in the administration of the affairs of 'Oman, decreed that every one who could establish his claim should receive a share of the property, to be decided in equity ; but whatever claims were not submitted, and those which could not be proved, were to be considered unknown, and such unknown portions were to be adjudged to the poor, whose representative was the Imam, it being his prerogative to receive all derelict property, and all property adjudged to the poor, and all property without an owner, to be applied to the benefit of the Mussulman rule. There were various other opinions on this subject, but the Imam's decree was affirmed for execu tion, and anyone who should attempt to alter it must abide by the consequences;—' God is the hearer and the know ing.' 2 This decree was passed on Tuesday evening, seven days before the expiration of Jumad-el-Akhir, a.h . 887 [ a.d. 1482]. It took place during the second appointment of 1 For the import of this word, see note 3 , p. 46. 2 Kurdn, ii. 117, etc.jw | W - ! (-U' I ; M fV ♦»&lt; 50 the imams of oman.

Subse quently, during the year 894, Muhammad-bin-Suleiman-bin- Ahmed-bin-Mufarraj, the Kadhi above mentioned, appointed him a second time. After him he set up 'OMAK-ESH-SHERIF, who held the office one year, and confined himself to Behla. Then the people of Nezwa appointed Suleiman-bin-Suleimfm a second time, 1 and not long after they swore fealty to I.-.-:.: ' ;u. ir- ■ ' 4 H wi AHMED-BIN-MUHAMMAD, es-raikhy, on whose death allegiance was given to ABU-^L-HASAN-BIN-'ABD-ES-SALAM, who held the Imamate for less than a year, when Suleiman- bin-Suleiman-bin-Muzhaffar rose up against him. He died before actual hostilities took place, whereupon allegiance was sworn to MUHAMMAD-BIN-ISMA'IL, owing to the following circumstances :—He resided on the western side of the road leading to the Bab-en-Nizar, at Azka. 2 Now it so happened that in the midst of his tyranny and oppression, Suleiman-bin-Suleiman-bin-Muzhaffar, en- Nebhany, was haunted by a voice bidding him to be on his 1 As this Suleiman was a Nebhany, his appointment shows that the Benu-Nebhan still retained considerable influence in the country. 2 I take this to be Wellsted's ' Zikki,' about 20 miles to the east of Nezwa. He describes it as ' a village romantically situated in a hol low, under some hills, in which also there are several towns. Travels in Arabia, vol. i, p. 169.the imams op 'oman. 51 guard; and when alone in his room in the fort of Behla, apart from his chiefs and commons, the voice would speak and say: ' Enjoy thyself, O offspring of the en-Nebhan, a few days longer, for thy rule will soon pass away: prepare for death.' One of the chiefs noticing his dejection inquired the cause of it, and on being told what the voice had uttered, he persuaded him to regard it as a delusion of the devil, and advised him to set off at once for Nezwa, where he would find what his heart desired and his eyes longed after. Where upon he and his friends mounted their camels and departed for Nezwa, and on arriving there alighted at the mansion- house, which Suleiman-bin-Suleiman had caused to be con structed for his own special accommodation. Early next morning he saw a woman going to the canal of el-G hantalc, and forthwith left his companion and followed her, she being unaware of his presence. 15efore she had taken off her clothes to bathe he fell upon her, but she fled pursued by him until they both reached the quarter near the Wadi. In the mean time Muhammad-bin-Ismail had come forth, and she appealed to him for protection; whereupon he seized the aggressor and plunged his dagger into his heart, killing him on the spot. The rescued woman then entered the house while he went and communicated the tidings to the people of el- Akr, at which they were so much delighted that they and those of the neighbourhood joined in making him Imam. Ihis occurred a.h . 906 [ a.d. 1 500]. Muhammad-bin-Ismail walked uprightly during his Imamate, and on his death his son, BARAKAT-BIN-MUHAMMAD-BIN-ISMA'IL, was appointed his successor, the selfsame day whereon his father died. Then, on Saturday, ten days before the ex piration of Muharram, a.h . 965 [ a.d . 1557], he left the foit of Behla and went to Nezwa, whereupon Muhammad-bm- Jufair-bin-'Aly-bin-Hiiai, el-Jabry, entered the former place. (This was after the sultan, Sultan -bin-el-Muh sin -bin- Sulei-52 the imams of ^oman. man-bin-Nebhan, had entered and taken possession of Nezwa, a.h . 964.) The fort of Behla continued in the hands of Muhammad-bin-Jufair till the Al-'Omair purchased it from him for three hundred lacs. They accordingly occupied the fort on Wednesday, nine days before the expiration of Jumad-el-Akhir, a.h . 967. The author of the Kashf-el-Ghummah thinks it probable that ^Omar-bin-el-Kasim, el-Fudhaily, lived in the time of Barakat-bin-Ismail; but God knows. Another Imam was now set up in the person of 'ABDALLAH-BIN-MUHAMMAD-EL-KARN, el-hinay. He was appointed at Manh, on Friday the 25th of Rajab, 967, and he made his entry into the fort of Behla two days before the end of that month and year; but on Saturday, three days before the expiration of Ramadhan, a.h . 968, Barakat- bin-Muhammad-bin-Ismail entered the fort and expelled him. To sum up: of the rulers of the Benu-Nebhan there was not one Imam or Malik whom the God of grace and benevo lence could approve of. On the contrary, most of them were tyrants and oppressors, and that led to their down fall :—' Do not imagine that God overlooks the actions of the evil-doers.' 1 When, therefore. He decreed that the evils which had so long afflicted the people of 'Oman should come to an end and their wounds be bound up by justice.

This upright Imam arose in 'Oman at a period when the people of er-Rastak were greatly divided, and much conten tion and strife existed among them on many matters. Their Malik at the time was Malik-bin-Abi-'l-^Arab, el-Yaaruby. 1 The learned and devout Mussulmans then consulted together about setting up an Imam who should be invested with full powers to decree what was lawful and prohibit what was unlawful, and they accordingly looked out for one fitted for the office. The most prominent man among them at the time was the learned and pious sheikh Khamis-bin-Said, esh-Shakasy. The result of their deliberations was that they should elect and appoint the magnanimous and upright Nasir-bin-Murshid. They then met together, he being pre sent, and they unanimously gave their votes for him and urged him to accept the supreme power. Those who formed the assembly were seventy in number, consisting of the elite of the learned. After much demur he yielded to their 1 Some notices of the el-Ya'arubah, the descendants of Ya'arub the offspring of Kaht&amp;n, are given in the Introduction.

In fact, their trials had reached the highest pitch: their wealth had been violently taken from them and their blood shed, and there was no one to stand up in behalf of the right, nor any learned man capable of advocating their cause. When the oath of fealty had been given to this upright 1 They were seized by Alfonso de Albuquerque a.d . 1508. ithe imams op 'oman. 55 Imam, Nasir-bin-Murshid, he marched with his followers to er -Rastak, then wholly in the hands of his cousin Malik-bin- Abi-'l-'Arab, el-Yaaruby, who no sooner saw the banners of the Imam than he forthwith surrendered the castle and fort to him without any opposition. From thence the Imam and his troops proceeded to Nakhl, then in the hands of his uncle Sultan-bin-Abi- J 'l- , Arab. After a siege of several days he captured it. On his departure some of the people who were inwardly disloyal to him seized upon the fort; but he soon returned and reduced them to submission. Being solicited to overlook their breach of taith, he pardoned them and then made ^Abdallah-bin-Said, esh- Shakasy, governor over them, returning himself to er- Rastak. Some few days after, messengers came to him from the people of Nezwa, inviting him to come and take possession of the place. He accordingly marched with his army and reached Sharjat-Sefer, belonging to Se'med-el-Kindy, where he remained a night, but as the people did not come to him as they had promised he returned to er-Rastak. He had taken the road by el-^Akk, both in going and returning, without visiting Semiiil; but on his arrival at er-Rastak, sheikh Ahmed-bin-Suleiman, er-l\uwahy, accompanied by a number of the er-Ruwahah and others sent by Mani^-bin- Sinan, el-'Omairy, came to solicit him to assume jurisdiction over Semail. He accordingly went, taking with him the men of the el-Yahmad who had been his staunch supporteis from the first, and others, and on his arrival at Semail the people made over the government to him. Leaving some of his force with Mani'-bin-Sinan, he proceeded with the remainder to Nezwa. It had been pre-arranged between him and Mani'-bin-Sinan and the Benu-Ruwahah that he should go by way of the Wadi ot the latter to Nez\Na; ho did so, having with him the Kadhi sheikh Khamis-bin-Said, esh-Shtlkasy. On reaching the town of Azka, the people56 the imams op 'oman. placed the government in his hands ; so, leaving some of his principal men in the fort, he went forward with the rest to Nezwa. On his arrival the inhabitants readily submitted to him, and taking up his abode in the mansion-house of el- 'Akr he assumed the supreme authority. After he had been there some time, the people, moved by envy and self-interest, took counsel with the Benu-Abi-Said, then the most promi nent men of el-'Akr, and it was agreed that he should be expelled on his way to the mosque on Friday morning. Having been informed of this design by his friends, and after ascertaining its truth, he ordered all the conspirators to be driven out of the district, but forbade their being treated with violence. They accordingly dispersed themselves over the country, some going to Mani'-bin-Sinan, el-'Omairy. Now Mani' had covenanted with the Imam to be loyal to him, but by receiving these men he obviously broke faith with him. Some of them also joined Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-Hinay, who at that time held the fort of Behla, and he headed them against the Imam, and a fierce war raged be tween the two parties. Whilst the war was in progress the Imam ordered the fort which es-Salt-bin-Malik had erected to be rebuilt. On its completion the principal inhabitants of Manh came to invite him to assume jurisdiction over them, and on his arrival there they surrendered the fort to him, and after setting up his authority he returned to Nezwa. Next, the people of Semed-esh-Shan came to him with a similar request. The place at that time was held by 'Aly- bin-Katan, el-Hilaly. The Imam accordingly sent a large force against it under the sheikh, the Fakih Mas^ud-bin- Ramadhan, who captured the fort in spite of all opposition, and the people surrendered to him. On the subsequent arrival of the Im^m they swore allegiance to him, and he assumed the supreme power. Next the people of Ibra came to him on a similar errand. Ibra was then held by Muhammad-bin. Jufair-bin-Jabr. Thethe imams op 'oman. Imam, in this case also, sent Mas'ud-bin-Ramadhan against it with an army, and he took it. AH the esh-Sharkiyyah now joined themselves to the Imam, and those of Jiialan submitted to him, and the only places where his authority was not recognized were Sur and Karyat, 1 which still re mained in the hands of the Christians. On the Imam's return to Nezwa he collected a large army to proceed against Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-Hinay, who held the fort at Behla. When the army was mustered in the plain of el-Merkh, the commander Mas'ud-bin-llamadhan noticed some symptoms of treachery among them; wheieupon he returned to inform the Imam at Nezwa, who forthwith suspended the expedition against Behla. He then collected another army and invaded ezh-Zhahirah, seizing the AN .uli- Fada, the old fort of which he ordered to be rebuilt. The people of the heights of Dhank 3 co-operated with him on this occasion under their chief sheikh Khamis-bin-Rashid. The el-Fiyalin and the el-Wahasha also submitted to him. On his return to 'Oman 3 the Imam visited the different places over which he had acquired sovereignty, and finding the people generally stedfast in their loyalty he went to ei- Rastak accompanied by many of the Benu-Riyam. 4 He had 1 Kary^t, the ' Curiate' of the Portuguese writers, is, or rather was, a small town about ten leagues to the north of Kalhat. Being ill re ceived there, Albuquerque plundered and then burnt the place, together with fourteen vessels which he found in the harbour. 'Abd-er-Razzak landed there from Hormuz before proceeding to Kalhat, on his way to India (see note 2, p. 37). y) ' I take this to be the ' Rank' of Niebuhr's map and the ' Runk of Wellsted's, situated in the district of ezh-Zhahirah. 3 That is, to the district of 'Oman proper. 4 The Benu-Riyam are of Mdhrah origin, for among the author's ge nealogical notices of the el-Azd, he interpolates a short chapter on ' Mahrah -bin-IIaidan,' from whom the Mahrah tribes derive their de scent.

On hearing thereof the Imam went against him with an army composed of the el-Maawal and other tribes, and after putting Muhammad- bin-Jufair's army to flight he returned to er-Rastak. He had only been there a few days when the sheikh Khamis-bin- liuwaishid came to solicit his aid against ezh-Zhahirah; he accordingly collected a large force and accompanied it to es-Sakhbary, where the men of es-Sirr and the edh-Dhaha- hakah joined him, and from, thence he proceeded to the fort of el-Ghabby, which was garrisoned by the Benu-Hilal 1 and a number of Bedu and Iladhr There was a fierce engage ment between the two parties, in which Ja/id-bin-Murshid, the Imam's brother, was slain, and the troops of the Benu- Hilal fled; nevertheless the Imam could not prevail against the fort. He then went and seized 'Obra, and afterwards and ed-Dair, El-Imry begat el-Kdmar, [from whom in all probability the Bay of el-Kamar takes its name], and el-Kamra, and el-Masdlla, and el-Masaka. Ihe Benu-Riyam belong to the el-Kamar tribes: they in habit a town on the coast of the sea of 'Om&amp;n, and they also possess a strong mountain in 'Oman, which is called the Mountain of the Benu- Riyam and also Jebel-Rudhwan.' Wellsted gives an account of them and of the mountains which they occupy in his Travels in Arabia, vol. i. pp. 129-61. 1 The Benu-Hilal I take to be the descendants of Ililal, one of the four sons of 'Amir-bin-Sa'asa'ah (born about a.d . 381), a descendant of Ma'add and 'Adnan through Khasafah, the son of Kais-'Ailan. The other sons were Ghdny, Nu'man and Rabia'. They became the heads of four families, called after their names, which originally settled in the Hijaz, to the eastward of the mountains which separate the Tihamah from Nejd, but subsequently migrated farther into the interior. The author's narrative describes the Benu-Hilal at this time as located at el-IIasa, but what led them thither I have failed to ascertain. Their Ma'addic origin accounts for their enmity towards the el-Ya'arubah, the el-Yemeny Imfims of 'Oman. 2 The Bedu are the pastoral and the Hadhr the town or village-dwell- ing Arabs. Pocock translates the names Nomades et Urbani, and gives some interesting notices of the origin and import of the terms. Speci men Hist. Arab., pp. 88-90.THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 50 returned to es-Sakhbary, from whence he marched once more against the fort of el-Ghabby, and after a siege of some days succeeded in capturing it; he then made over the fort and people to sheikh Khamis-bin-Ruwaishid, er-Ruwaishidy. Another account states that the Imam first sent his brother Ja'id-bin-Murshid with an army against the fort of el-Ghabby, and that in the battle which took place between him and the Benu-Hilal, aided by the people of el-Ghabby, Ja'id was slain; that in consequence of this failure the Imam as sembled a large army of the Hadhr, wherewith he seized the fort of that place and all other forts in the district which still held out against his authority; but God knows the truth. It is generally agreed, however, that when the Imam captured the fort he placed over the people of el-Ghabby the sheikh Khamis-bin-Ruwaishid, er-Ruwaishidy, a man renowned for integrity and bravery. Over the fort of Bat he placed a native of er-Rastak, whose name I have for gotten, associating with him sheikh Muhammad-bin-Seif, el- Haukany, whom he ordered to capture the remaining towns of ezh-Zhahirah. This he effected, with the exception of the town of Dhank, which was at that time in the possession of the Benu-Hilal, between whom and the two governors aforenamed there were frequent affrays, one party making incursions on the territory of the other. Eventually a decisive engage ment took place between them, when God gave the victory to the forces of the Imam. Many of the Al-Hilal were slain, the remainder escaping mounted on their camels. Katan- bin-Katan saved himself by surrendering the fort of Dhank and all it contained to the Imam. The two governors then undertook the siege of the fort of Makniyat, at that time occupied by a commander belonging to the el-Jibur. When the latter heard thereof they sum moned to their aid the Bedu and Hadhr of the Benu-Hilal, who were joined by the Benu-Rais. Fearing lest they mightno the imams of 'oman. attack the fort of Bat, which had then but a slender garrison, the two governors abandoned the attempt on Makniyat and inarched towards Bat, near which place a battle was fought which lasted from morning-prayer till noon. The Mussul mans fought desperately, insomuch that their hands drooped with wielding their weapons, and so great was the slaughter among the rebels that they left off burying them. When news of this signal defeat reached the Imam, he marshalled a strong army and proceeded to Behla, where he arrived on the eve of the feast of the Hijj, and besieged it for two months. The el-Jibur coming to the assistance of Seif-bin- Muhammad, el-Hinsiy, were met by the Imam's forces, and a battle ensued in which the former were overcome, and Kasim-bin-Madzkur, one of their chiefs, and a number of his men were killed, the remainder taking to flight. Seif-bin- Muhammad held the fort for some time after, but eventually surrendered it to the Imam, who placed a governor of his own there, whose name I have not found recorded in history. The Imam then went to Semiiil to coerce Mani'-bin- Sinan, el-'Omairy, but on his arrival Mani' came forward, begging permission to evacuate the fort, promising to be loyal in future. The Imam then ordered the old fort to be rebuilt, and on its completion placed a governor in it of his own and then returned to Nezwa. He next collected a large army of Hadhr and marched against Makniyat, and after a siege of three months, and a severe engagement with the rebels, he captured the fort and placed it under the command of Muhammad-bin-'Aly-bin Muhammad, el-Harasy. Meanwhile Said-bin-Mas^ud, el-Khayaly, and his adherents, continued to excite disaffection against the Imam, keeping up a correspondence with the el-Jibur, until they succeeded in bringing them towards the coast, where they attacked many of the edh-Dhahahakah and some of the Imam's officers. Whereupon Muhammad-bin-Seif, at that time the Imam'sTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 61 governor ait ol-Ghabby, wont against tliom with Ins soldicis, and several engagements took place between him and tho rebels, notably at 'Ajfiyyah, el-'Aliyyah, el-Mat-harah, ez- Ziyadah and other places, so that the foundations of Islam were shook thereby, insomuch that many of Muhammad-bin- Seifs followers abandoned him, and his few remaining ad herents were surrounded by the. rebels and in danger of being overpowered. In this strait he retired to the fort oi el-Ghabby, where he entrenched himself, whilst the enemy pressed on the siege. News of his situation reaching Mu hammad-bin-'Aly, the Imam's governor at Makniyat, he entered el-Ghabby with his followers, unperceived by the rebels, and falling upon them with spears and swords hacked them to pieces on all sides. Some of them fled to es-Sakhbary, and others to el-Fayafy and the town of Yan- kal, the fort of which was at that time in the hands of N.isii- bin-Katan, el-Jabry. So God gave the Mussulmans the vic tory over the rebels. Then Nasir-bin-Katan opened a treasonable correspondence with Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-Hinay, who broke faith with the Imam by listening to his overtures. Accordingly, the followers of both combined and entered Nezwa, the garrison of the mansion-house at el-'Akr siding with them, so that the fort alone held out for the Im^m. This they besieged closely, and made an attempt to get at the Imam and his garrison by making an opening through one of the walls ; but God intervened in behalf of the Imam by sending to his succour a detachment of men from Azka, some of the J?onu- Kiyam from the mountains, and reinforcements from Behla. This timely assistance enabled him to attack the rebels, ovei whom God gave him a complete victory. The result served to encourage the Imam and greatly to strengthen his ad ministration. After this triumph some of his discreet and trusty ad herents advised him to raze the fort of Mani '-bin-Sinan,G2 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. at Semail, and to expel him from that town, in consequence of certain acts of his which had a semblance of treachery. On hearing this Mani' fled first to Finja, but its inhabitants would not receive him. Next he joined the Christians, who held Maskat, but shortly after left them; ultimately he went to Finja, and attached himself to Muhammad-bin-Jufair, el- Jabry, who was then at Lawa of Sohar. 1 The Imam now ordered the sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad-bin-Ghassan, his governor at Nezwa, and the author of the work en titled A Treasury for the Good in the Choice of the Best? [Sovereigns?], to proceed against the insurgents with a large army which he had assembled for that purpose. On his arrival at Balad-Sit, Muhammad-bin-Seif, el-Hinay, and his followers evacuated the fort and fled to Nezwa to ask pardon of the Imam, which he accorded on hearing that his governor 'Abdallah had razed the fort. Then when all the tribes of 'Oman had submitted to his authority, the Imam assembled a large army, and taking with him the learned sheikh Kha- mis-bin-Said, er-Rastaky, he started for Yankal, the inhabi tants of which had rebelled. He took the fort after a few days' siege, and appointed Nijad-bin-Himham, el-'Obry, governor over the people, with full powers to administer justice among them. A few days after the Imam's return to er-Rastak he as sembled a large army and placed it under the command of sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad-bin-Ghassan, en-Nezawy, ordering him to proceed to el-Jauf of Tawwam. He was accompanied on this expedition by sheikh Khamis-bin- Ruwaishid, ed-Dhanky, by Hafizh-bin-Jumaat, en-Nezawy, 1 ' Wellsted's ' Luwa,' and the ' Luar' of Captain Brucks's Me moir on the Navigation of the Gulf of Persia, 1829. He describes it as ' a large fort, with a town two miles inland, in lat. 24° 30' 53' N., long. 56° 39' 48' E. It is a place of some importance, and the revenue of it and the places attached to it is about 7,000 German crowns.'

He took the place and all its vil lages and conferred the government over Tawwam, on behalf of the Imam, upon sheikh Ahmed-bin-Khalf, esh-Shamy. Thereupon sheikh ^Abdallah-bin-Muhammad and the other aforenamed chiefs determined to go to Lawa, for the follow ing reasons :—The el-Jibur had broken their word; more- over, serious dissensions had arisen among them owing to the murder of Muhammad-bin-Jufair, el-Jabry, who in his lifetime had been governor of the fort of Lawa, some ap proving of the deed others denouncing it. After his death the fort had fallen into the hands of Seif-bin-Muhammad-bin- Jufair, el-Hilaly, his brother Muhammad-bin-Jufair, el-Jabry, fleeing to Sohar, where he joined the Christians. Mani^- bin-Sinan was also at Sohar with the Christians at that time, and from thence they made frequent attacks upon the army of the Imam which was besieging Lawa, and supplied the garrison with arms and provisions. Nevertheless, the Imam's troops under the commander-in-chief, ^Abdallah- bin-Muhammad, el-Kindy, en-Nezawy, continuing to press forward the siege, the adherents of Muhammad-bin-Jufair made overtures for peace. This, however, was a mere stratagem on their part to ascertain the strength or weak ness of the Imam's army. Outwardly they professed to be urging the garrison to surrender the fort, whereas in reality they were inciting them to resist, promising to provide them with men and money to that end. Their deceit and treachery becoming known to the Amir 'Abdallah-bin- Muhammad, he sent against them a picked body of men, headed by Muhammad-bin-'Aly, who came up with them before daybreak at Mankal-el-Mily, on the sea-shore, to the southward of the fort. The millstones of war were then set 1 A synonym occasionally used by the author for el-Hinay, which con firms the statement ventured in the Introduction that the tribe bearing that name are the descendants of liana or Hina, the brother of Nebhan.04 the imams of ^oman. a-going by the two parties, and a severe conflict ensued; after which Muhammad-bin-'Aly and his men returned to Lawa and in conjunction with their comrades besieged the fort still more closely. No further succour coming to Seif- bin-Muhammad, el-Hinay, he despaired of breaking through the siege, and asked sheikh ^Abdallah-bin-Muhammad to agree to a truce in order that he might surrender the fort. The request having been granted, he and his adherents left the fort, taking with them their arms and provisions, where upon it was occupied by the Wali 1 and his principal followers. Nasir-bin-Katan having assisted in the siege was liberally rewarded by 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad, who also promoted him. Before leaving Ldwa the sheikh 'Abdallah appointed Muhammad-bin-'Aly to the command of the fort, and on his return to Nezwa was received with great honour by the Imam, who was highly pleased with his success, as were also the Mussulmans generally. Some days after, the Imam dispatched the sheikh Mas'ud- bin-Eamadhan with a large army to attack the Christians who held Maskat and el-Matrah. Mas'iid encamped with his army at the latter place, near T&amp;wy-er-Rula, where the two parties came into collision; but God gave the victory to the Imam's troops, who destroyed several of the towers and other conspicuous buildings of Mdskat and killed many of the Christians. Whereupon the latter sued for peace, which Mas'ud was authorized by the Imam to grant, con ditionally on their surrendering all the buildings and land which they hold at Sohar. 2 This they agreed to do, and after obtaining a covenant from them to that effect Mas'ud re turned to the Imam. Another condition was that they 1 Wdli is the title generally given by the author to the civil governor of a town or district. A military commander in charge of an expedition he designates Amir. 2 The fortifications excepted, as will be seen in the sequel.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. G5 should pay an annual tribute to the Imam, and should not molest the Mussulmans who repaired to Maskat. They con sented to this also, and Mas^d did not leave until he had received the tribute from them. These latter facts I give on the trustworthy authority of several aged friends, among whom I may mention sheikh Maaruf-bin-Salim, es-Sayighy, and Khatir-bin-Hamid-el-Beda/iy, and Hamid-bin-Salim, el- Aama, all men of well-known probity. 1 Now Mani^-bin-Sinan was secretly inimical to the Imam and did all in his power to foment dissatisfaction against his government, insomuch that Maddad-bin-Halwan requested the Imam^s permission to compass his death by treachery, which being lawful the Imam gave his consent. Maddad was at that time commander of the garrison at Lawa, where Hafizh-bin-Seif was governor, who also used to consult him in all difficult or important matters. Maddad forthwith began a correspondence with Man?, promising that he would secure his entrance into the fort. Hafizh-bin-Seif was in the plot, but left its direction entirely to Maddad, between whom and Mani' messengers were continually going and coming. Man? resided at the time at the village of Daba, but when he felt sure of Maddad he proceeded to Sohar, remaining several days at el-Mankal, which appertains to it, expecting to hear from Maddad that the plot was ripe for execution. Maddad reassured him on that point, but at the same time informed the governor on what night the attempt to enter the fort was to be made. The governor accordingly sent bands of soldiers over the country to apprehend Mani'. They watched him as he was approaching Lawa, surrounded him on all sides and then killed him, together with a number of his followers, the remainder escaping. When the Imam 1 The Portuguese annalists of the period, as far as I know, are silent respecting these successes gained over their countrymen in Oman, which, however, proved preliminary to their ignominious expulsion not long after.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. heard what Hafizh and Maddad had done to Mani' and his followers he was greatly elated, as were also all the Mussul man champions of the faith. The Imam then assembled an army, attaching to it the men of the Benu-Yaarubah, and placed the whole under 'Aly-bin-Ahmed, whom he ordered to proceed to Julfar, appertaining to es-Sirr, which was held at the time by Nasir- ed-Din, the Persian,- with a large body of his countrymen. On his arrival 'Aly surrounded the fort and maintained a fierce struggle with its defenders. Now, attached to the fortress of Julfar was a projecting tower, garrisoned by some of Nasir-ed-Din's followers, who fought desperately day and night, whilst the Christians who were provided with vessels called vulgarly Ghurbab kept up a constant fire from their guns to prevent the Mussulmans from approaching the fort. These latter, therefore, decided to assault the tower, which they did on a starlight night, and succeeded in capturing it. They then assailed the fort, which also fell into their hands. After placing a governor—whose name is not recorded in history—over the place on behalf of the Imam, 'Aly returned to the latter, but shortly after came back to Julfar as governor of that town and its dependencies. According to another account he remained in the fort after capturing it, and wrote to the Imam announcing his success, who thereupon conferred the governorship of the place upon him. While there he was joined by the ed-Duhamish under Khamis-bin-Makhzum, who came to aid him on behalf of the Imam. Now there was a fort on the sea-shore at Julfar —not that which had been taken by 'Aly—belonging to the Christians. 1 This was surrounded and besieged by the ed- 1 The foregoing account of these two attacks on Julfar, as also the narrative which follows of the construction of a fort by the Imam near Sohar, while the principal fortress of that town was in the hands of the ' Christians,' confirms the remarks made in a foot-note to p. 46 re specting the tenure on which the Portuguese held most of their stationsTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 07 Duhamish, who were liberally supplied with provisions and arms by 'Aly-bin-Ahmed, until at length the Christians sued for peace, which 'Aly accorded on condition that they evacuated the place. Whereupon 'Aly appointed a man of his uncle's family, the Al-'Aly, Wali over Julfar and its dependencies, and returned with his soldiers to Nezwa, where he was highly congratulated by the Imam for his successful enterprise. The Imam then wrote to Hafizh-bin-Sinan, the governor of Lawa, ordering him to build a fort on the shore at Sohar. Whereupon Hafizh dispatched letters to his friends residing within the dependencies of Julfar, and others, summoning them to his aid, and shortly after he was joined by a number of men from the Benu-Khalid, the Benu-Lam, and the el- 'Amilr. 1 Moreover, a number of the Sohar people had been in the Persian Gulf and on the coast of 'Oman. Julfar at this time ap pears to have been nominally subject to their tributary the ' King of Hormuz,' but they had a separate fort there and cooperated in defending the Persian garrison as well as themselves. 1 Until subjugated by the Wahhabis the Benu-Khalid were the most prominent tribe on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. They occu pied the country extending a little above el-Katif to the boundary of the Benu-Yas, in about longitude 53°, including the districts of 'Ojair, el-Has^ or ILijar, and Katar. Palgrave calls them a ' Kahtanic' tribe, and one of the first known colonists of the coast of el-Ilasa. Among his genealogies of the el-Azd, under the heading of u the el-Azd, de scendants of Khatamah,' our author mentions a Khalid -bin-Sadus-bin- Asma'-bin-Sa'ad-bin-Nebhan, who may have been the forefather of the existing tribe bearing his name. I have pointed out in the Introduction, however, that Khatamah himself was of the stock of Ma'add, and that his descendants were regarded as Azdites through his intermarriage A\ith a family of Kahlan, (the descendant of Kahtan), the progenitor of el-Azd. The Benu-Lam are a branch of the great Tai tribe, and therefore of Kahtanic origin, through Kahlan; for Lam, born about a.d . 470, m as the descendant of Tai, the descendant of Odad, the descendant of Kah lan. The Tai settled originally in the mountains of Aja and Selma, to the north-west of Nejd. 1 have met with no account of the cause of their migration towards the coast. At the present day the Benu-Lam aio mostly to be found on the banks of the r ligris, between el-Kurnah and Baghdad.

The first night of the march he spent at el-'Akk, arriving at Sohar the following morning, without the enemy being aware of his approach. This occurred on the last day of Muharram, a.h . 1043 [28th July, 1633]. On their halting at a spot called el-Bidaah, the Christians became aware of the presence of the Mussulmans, and a fierce conflict ensued between the two parties, the Christians harassing the Mussulmans with showers of shot from the fort and its towers, insomuch that the governor moved his position to a greater distance. Nevertheless, hostilities continued, during which a cannon-ball coming among the troops forced its way to the governor's council, and struck Rashid-bin-'Abbad, one of the principal officers, killing him on the spot. He died a martyr; may God have mercy on him ! However, the foundations of the fort were laid and the work completed in accordance with the Imam's orders, and the governor occupied it with his troops, the war between him and the Christians continuing to rage as fiercely as ever. About this time certain messengers whom the Imam had sent to Mdskat returned, stating that the Christians there had refused to pay the tribute agreed upon, and, moreover, had treated them harshly. Thereupon the Imam dispatched an army against them under the sheikh, the Kadhi, Khamis- bin-Said, esh-Shakasy. On reaching Bushir 1 he received messages from the Christians soliciting peace, but he would not listen to them. From thence he proceeded to el-Matrah, ' be intended. If so, I take it to be the Benu-'Amir-bin-Sa'asa'ah, the de scendant of Hawazin, of Ma'addic origin through Kais-'Ailan. They played a conspicuous part among the tribes of Nejd and were for a long period the bitter enemies of the Benu-Temim. 1 Bushir, the ' Buscier' of Wellsted's map, is a small town seven miles to the southward of Mdskat. 2 The u Muttarah' of our charts and Wellsted's ' Matarah,' a consi derable town situated in a cove about a mile to the north of Maskat, from which it is only separated by a range of hills, so rugged that theTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. G9 whore a deputation of the principal Christians waited on him with the same object. Eveotually he agreed to their request on the following conditions :—They were to pay tribute ; to restore the fortified posts which they had seized at el- Matrah; to permit all those who went to them to trade freely; to abstain from war; to surrender the fortified posts which they held at Maskat, 1 in addition to those which they were to make over at el-Mdtrah. On their acceptance of these conditions he consented to suspend hostilities and returned to the Imam, who, on hearing what had taken place between him and the Christians, praised him highly for his energy and success. The Imam next assembled another army and dispatched it to Sur, 2 under the command of his cousin Sultan-bin-Seif- bin-Mulik, el-Yaaruby. On reaching the place he invested the fort, which was at that time in the hands of the Christians, and eventually captured it. From thence he marched to Karyat, which was also garrisoned by the Christians, and took that also after a severe engagement. In this way the Imam acquired possession of all the province of ^Oman, with the exception of Mdskat, el-Matrah and the fort of Sohar, which were still held by the Christians. In the meantime Nasir-bin-Katan and his adherents con- communication between the two places is maintained principally by boats. 1 It is clear from the sequel that only certain outposts were to be sur rendered. 2 Sur, situated on the coast of 'Oman in lat. 22° 35' N., and 59° 33' E., is the port of the district of Ja'alan. The town, according to Well- sted, consists of a large collection of huts, erected on either side of a deep lagoon ; but the bazaar, which is a mile and a half distant, boasts of a few stone houses, the best of which are occupied by natives of Cutch who monopolize a large share of the trade. On the west quarter there is a large fort—probably built by the Portuguese—mounting a few old guns. The harbour is good, and the inhabitants possess three hundred bagalas with which, during the fair season, they trade between the shores of India, Africa, and the Arabian and Persian Gulfs.70 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. tinued to make incursions into 'Oman. His residence at this time was at el-Hasa, 1 from whence he made annual in roads into 'Oman, plundering the Bedu of their sheep, and committing other outrages, returning with his booty to el- Hasa. These proceedings coming to the knowledge of the Imam he wrote to his governor, Muhammad-bin-Seif, el- Haukany, directing him to lie in wait for Nasir-bin-Katan on the confines of'Oman. The governor accordingly selected a band of renowned warriors, and on hearing of Nasir's ap proach concealed them below the sand which forms part of the boundary of ezh-Zhafrah. On learning this, Nasir retired into the fort of ezh-Zhdfrah, where he was joined by the Benu-Yas, 2 and then sent one of his followers to Muham- mad-bin-Seif soliciting peace, which the latter, whose pro visions were running short and who saw no prospect of receiving reinforcements at that distance from his country, deemed it prudent to grant, on condition that the property plundered should be restored or made good. This being agreed to, a reconciliation took place between the two parties. 1 A small province on the mainland opposite the island of el-Bahrein, bounded on the west by a range of hills which separates it from Nejd. An interesting account of its past history and present condition and re sources is given by Palgrave in his Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii. pp. 136-217. 2 Palgrave, who describes the Benu-Yas as ' an ill-famed clan, half Bedouins, half villagers, and half pirates,' represents them as belonging to the original inhabitants of 'Oman, adding that they trace their de scent from the ' Kahtanee family of Modhej.' {Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. ii. p. 234.) Another of their traditions is, that they are the de scendants of Yas-bin-'Amr-bin-Kais-bin-Nizar, which makes them a Ma'addic race. Their main centre is Abu-Zhaby (the Abothubbee of our charts), situated on a sandy island in lat. 24° 29' 21' N., long. 54° 32' 20'' E., with a population of 1,200 souls, which is much increased during the pearl-fishery season. The Benu-Yas number about 3,000 men, but on an emergency they can muster about 5,000 more from various sub-tribes, and also from the el-Munasir, whom Palgrave regards as a people of different origin. They have a Sheikh of their own, and have generally been on good terms with the rulers of 'Oman.the imams of 'oman. 71 But no sooner had Muhammad-bin-Seit departed than Nasir -bin-Katan began to collect the Bedu and Hadhr of the Benn-Yas and other tribes, intending to attack the fort of Tawwam, being encouraged thereto by some of the dis affected in that place. He accordingly marched to Tawwam now called el-Bereimy—and invested the fort, which at that time was held by Muhammad-bin-Khalf, esh-Shakasy, on the part of the Imam. When the Imam's governors in el-Batiuah and ezh-Zhahirah heard thereof they assem bled a large force of Bedu and Hadhr and marched to Muhammad-bin-Khalf's assistance. On hearing of their approach Nasir-bm-lvatan immediately raised the siege, and all his followers fled like runaway slaves. On the arrival shortly after of the principal Wali, the sheikh 'Abdallah- bin-Muhammad'-bin-Ghassan, el-Kindy, en-Nezawy, he or dered all the forts of el-Jauf—generally styled el-Jau— to be razed, which was accordingly done, so that all the Imam's enemies were scattered like the dispersion of Saba. 1 Nasir-bin-Katan then joined the Christians at Sohar, and among other of the Imam's adversaries who were with them at the time was 'Omair -bin-Muhammad, el-'Omairy, and they consorted together. Some of the runaways posted themselves at the pass of Julfar, where they used to plunder travellers, and made inroads from thence upon the surround ing district. Muhammad-bin-Seif marched against them with a party of his followers ; having killed some of them the remainder fled like a herd of camels pursued by lions. Nasir -bin-Katan, however, continued his depredations on the subjects of the Imam. On one occasion he attacked the camels of the Benu-Khalid and the Benu-Lam, taking a number of them and plundering the women of theii orna- 1 An Arab proverb founded on the story contained in the chapter of the Kuran, entitled Surat-Sdba, of the destruction of the descendants of Saba by the famous inundation styled Sail-el-Arim, which 1 erceval refers to the rupture of the dyke or reservoir at Mareb, near San aa, a.d . 120. Hist, den Arahes, vol. i. p. 85,72 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. ments^ retiring to el-Hasa with the spoil. On another occasion he marched along the seashore, with the intention of plundering the Arabs of the coast of 'Oman. The latter collected a considerable force and placed it under the com mand of 'Aly-bin-Ahmed, el-'Alowy, with whom were associated Muhammad-bin-es-Salt, er-Riyamy, and 'Aly-bin- Muhammad, el-'Obry/and Ahmed-bin-Balhasan, el-Bushiry, and Rashid-bin-Hisham, and other chiefs. 'Aly-bin-Ahmed marched with his force towards Lawa, and coming suddenly on Nasir's people, who were not aware of their approach, hailed them with shouts, and there was a severe skirmish between the two parties, during which Nasir fled, followed by the advance-guard of his pursuers. The first who over took him were Ahmed-bin Balhdsan and Murad-bin-Hisham, and some other chiefs, at a place called el-Kliarus, and these Mussulmans were engaged before the main body of the Imam's army had come up, and the foremost of them were slain ; (God have mercy upon them !) When their comrades reached the spot they found the dead bodies but saw nothing of the enemy, who had effected their escape. So after bury ing those who had fallen in the fight they returned to 'Oman. Then one of the rebels named Muhammad-bin-'Othman —he is also called Ibn-Harmd—commenced committing de predations in the district of es-Sirr, appertaining to ezh- Zhahirah. The governor there at that time was Muhammad- bin-Seif, el-Haukany, with whom was associated Said-bin- Khalfan, el-Kilrashy, who ordered Muhammad-bin-'Othman, to appear before him to account for his misdeeds. (Some say that he was summoned by Said and that they had an interview in the mosque of esh-Sheriaah; but the first is the more correct statement. Another account is that 1 That is, of 'Obra, Wellsted's ' Obri,' which he describes as one of the largest and most populous towns of 'Oman. He places it within the province of ezh-Zhahirah.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 73 Muhammad-bin-Seif ordered his soldiers to seize him wherever he could be found; that they fell upon him at a spot near Dhank, slew some of his foliowers^ and then bound him ; but God knows best.) On being brought before him, Muhammad-bin-Seif required that he should restore all that he had plundered, and on his refusal imprisoned him in the fort of el-Ghabby, and went himself to the Imam at er- Rastak to report the case. Whereupon the Imam ordered that he should be sent to the prison at er-Rastak, so as to prevent him from doing further mischief, and also as an example to others. He died in the prison at er-Rastak a few months after. Then the Imam collected another army and placed it under the command of the aforenamed Said-bin-Khalfan, associat ing with him ^Omair-bin-Muhammad-bin-Jufair, el-Jabry. They marched towards ezh-Zhdfrah, in order to seize the camels of Nasir-bin-Katan, el-Hilaly, and were met by the Benu-Yas not far from the camels, at a spot called esh-Shaab, near ezh-Zhafrah, where an encounter took place between them. The foremost of the Benu-Yas at that time was Sukair-bin-'Isa, who was slain on the occasion, as was also his brother Muhammad-bin-^Isa and several of their fol lowers, whereupon the remainder sued for pardon. J he governor then returned with his victorious army, and coming to a watering-place called Daakas, where Nasir-bin-Katan's camels were grazing, he seized them and left them in charge of ■'Omair-bin-Muhammad-bin-Jufair. Now, the latter had a brother named 'Aly-bin-Muhammad, some of whose people advised him to take the camels to Nasir -bin-Katan, which he did. Nasir's party moreover continued to make incursions into 'Oman, insomuch that the Bedu and Hadhr were obliged to flee to the towns to escape their depredations. Nasir-bin-Katan's next expedition was directed towards the south, where he halted with his followers and closed the roads. The Imam thereupon sent an army against him 10.. ■VWv? v f kH m II | ♦ jii ! ••! M ■ 74 the imams of oman. under the command of Seif-bin-Malik and Seif-bin-Abi- , l- 'Arabj both of the el-Yaj'irubah, and Hizam-bin- 5 Abdallah. The advanced party of the Imam's forces coming up with the rebels attacked and slew them all, although they were few against many; for 'victory is from God alone: how often has a small army, by the will of God, overcome a great army; and God is with those who are patient.' 1 In fine, the Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid was a man of perfect integrity and an eminent example of justice personified. God bestowed him upon the Mussulmans, and through him He humbled the infidels, the polytheists, and the evil-doers. He drove out the conspirators from their lurking-places, broke up their haunts, overcame their leaders, checked their rebellion, crushed the tyrants and oppressors, God giving him power over them, aiding him against them, assisting him to victory, and in every way vouchsafing him support, so that he raised Islam to great preeminence. He put a check on what was evil, and it was kept under ; he favoured justice throughout 'Oman, and it became conspicuous. Under him the Bedu and Hadhr acquired the ascendancy, for there were but a few Christians left, and those, since he had undertaken to wage war upon them, kept themselves entrenched within the forts and walls of Maskat, so that they grew feeble and dispirited, their power was broken, their confederates were scattered, and slaughter and death awaited most of them. He died (God have mercy upon him and pardon him !) having the esteem and love of all good men. His death took place on Friday, ten days before the expiration of Kabia-el-Akhir, a.h . 1059 [22nd April, 1649] after a rule of twenty-six years. He was buried at Nezwa, where his grave is revered by all true worshippers. Kurau, SHrat-ImrAn, (iii ) 122. Surat-el-Bdlarah, (ii.) 250.THfc IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 75 The following is an epitome of this Imam's extraordinary virtues, which will be remembered while day and night last. A man was asleep in the mosque of Kasra, at er-Rastak, and saw one of the corners of the mosque lighted up as if by a lamp. On awaking he found that the Imam was reclining in that spot. This was before Murshid had been elected Imam. His mother married again after the death of his father, and the Imam directed her to prepare his meals before she prepared their own, lest a particle intended for her husband should become mixed with his food. One day she forgot the injunction, and first kneaded the dough for her husband and then made it into bread. Next, without previously washing the vessel, she poured the flour for her son's bread into it. The result was that her hand stuck to the pan, and she was unable to detach it until her son came and re leased her of it, pardoning her at the same time. One day after he had been proclaimed Imam by the nobles and commons some fellows assembled in a house belonging to one of their number at er-Rastak, where they began abusing the Imam. The wife of the owner of the house forbade them, but they would not desist. Whereupon she left them and forthwith the roof of the house fell in and killed them all. A she-camel belonging to an Arab ate some of the pro vender belonging to the Beit-el-Mal, and immediately its skin became covered with pimples. It remained in that state until the Imam saw it; (the people generally had seen the eruption.) The camel then came and knelt before the Imam, and remained in that posture until its owner arrived, of whom the Imam inquired into the case, and was informed that the animal had eaten some of the grain belonging to the Beit-el-Mal, which had caused the disease. The Imam forthwith pardoned the man and loosed the animal, stroking76 the imams op 'oman. it with his hands on its head and neck, and God healed it of its malady. A basket of dates during his reign sufficed to feed one hundred men for several days, and so did a basket of rice,— a proof of his meritoriousness. One hot day as he was asleep on the roof of his house a man came with the intention of assassinating him. He placed himself at the Imam's head with a drawn dagger in his hand, but he was powerless to strike because God restrained him. On awaking, the Imam, perceiving the assassin standing near his head, asked him what he wanted. ' Nothing will avail me but your pardon,' he replied ; ' for I came to murder you.' The Imam forgave him, and no evil befell him for what he had attempted. A B^dawy having lost a she-camel went in search of it over hill and dale. At length he came upon a foot-print, the size of which excited his wonder. Following its traces he arrived at a green meadow, full of trees, flowers and fruit, and heard a voice from the outskirts saying to him: ' Be congratulated, for your camel is in such a place. Go, then, and tell the upright Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid to persevere in the course which he is pursuing, for it is the career of the best of men, [Muhammad,] upon whom be the richest blessings and peace !' The Bedawy returned in great fear, the tips of his fingers pressed together over his distracted breast, and found his camel in the spot indicated by the speaker. Mounting it, he rode off to the Imam, whom he found in company with others, and related what he had wit nessed and what had been said to him. It so happened that the Imam himself had seen in a dream a Bedawy coming to him and announcing that he was leading the life of the best of men, [Muhammad,] and had recounted it to some of his friends before the B^dawy's arrival. The Imam's household was supplied with provisions from the stores of the Beit-el-Mal, but he did not possess a caldronTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 77 for cooking the food. His wife therefore managed to save a small portion of the rations for several successive days, which she sold, and bought a copper caldron with the money. Thereupon the Imam questioned her very particularly as to how she came by it, and, on hearing her explanation, said; ' You may use it, but take great care of it, for it belongs to the Beit-el-Mal;' at the same time he ordered the person in charge of the grain to diminish the daily supply to his household to the extent which his wife had found sufficient. One day the Kadhi Muhammed-bin-'Omar called upon the Imam and found him much depressed. On asking the reason he received no reply; but on pressing him to explain why he was so much cast down he discovered that it was because he was entirely without means to enable his house hold to keep the feast. The Kadhi forthwith mentioned the circumstance to the eminent Wali, 'Abdallah-bin-Mu- hammad, who ordered ten dirhems to be sent to him from the Beit-el-Mal. Among other extraordinary virtues attributable to this Imam are the following:—During his entire residence at ; Akr, of Nezwa, subsequent to his election, not one individual great or small died until after his own death : this is a well-known fact. Again, during his reign no person was destroyed by wild beasts. God vouchsafe to him pardon and approval! for his good deeds were many, and his trans cendent virtues deserve to be recorded among those of the most renowned sovereigns. On his death the upright Muslims oPOman assembled and decided that the successor to the eminent Nasir-bin-Mur- shid should be his cousin^—78 the imams of ^oman.

After receiving the homage of the people of 'Oman, its chiefs and commons, he began to administer justice and to fight in God's cause with the utmost vigour. He was nick named Sdhih-el-Kdf, [the Lord of the Kaf], owing, as some say, to his knowledge of alchymy. Others think that it arose from the fact that he had his stirrup-leathers marked with the letter Kaf, which I judge more probable ; bat God knows best. On assuming the reins of government he commenced hostilities against the Christians who still remained at Maskat, marching against them in person. He persevered until God gave him the complete victory over them. The author—who implores God to defend him and the orthodox Mussulmans from all evil—states as follows: I, Hamid -bin-Muhammad-bin-Razik, received this information from several aged trustworthy men, who were brought up in the time of Imam Sultan-bin-Seif-bin-Malik, el-Yaaruby, and who all agreed in substance although their words differed, that when the Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid died his cousin remained only a few days in 'Oman after the Imamate had been conferred upon him, and then set out to attack the Christians who held possession of the towns of Maskat and el-Matrah. These Christains were called Portuguese, who had large territories in India, and at that time they were the most powerful of the Christian nations, all of whom were their confederates and allies. Every epoch has its empire and its heroes.the imams op 'oman. 79 When the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif had decided to fight the Portuguese he pitched his camp at Tawy-er-Rula, near el- Matrah. He had a large army under his command, with which he assailed the enemy every morning and afternoon. The Portuguese, on their part, were well prepared for these attacks, and showed no signs of cowardice or of yielding. They had filled the two forts of Maskat, its towers, walls, and mountains, with picked men, 1 and waited patiently for the coming assault. The Imam Sultan-bin-Seif^s troops advanced against them as far as the Bir-el-Rawiyah, of Maskat; but the Portuguese had erected towers on the mountains of Maskat and gai'risoned them with musketeers, so that whenever any of the Imam's soldiers approached 1 Maskat is situated at the extremity of a small cove, in the gorges of an extensive pass, which is subdivided by 'Akabalis, or hills, into three valleys, called the Large, the Middle and the Small Wadis, through which there are roads leading round to el-Mdtrah and the village of Killabuh to the westward, and to the village of Sidab, about four miles to the southward. Landward the town is surrounded by a wall in which there are eight towers mounting artillery, and two fortified gates. Arid rocks, three hundred feet high, rise almost perpendicularly from the sea and form the cove. This boundary, on the eastern side, consists mainly of an islet—called ' the Island' by the author—about a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide, indented with creeks and defended towards the mouth of the harbour by a half-moon battery ; a correspond ing work is erected on the opposite side, a little lower down in the cove. The islet is only separated from the double hill which bounds the town on the east by a narrow channel, which is nearly dry at low water. On the summit of the hill just named stands the ' Eastern Fort, ' and on the opposite side, rising above the town, is the 'Western Fort,'' both strongly built and tolerably well armed. Some of the guns, however, are very old, and belonged to the Portuguese. I saw one in 1861 in the Eastern Fort bearing the date 1625. Besides these fortifications there are several small watch-towers on the surrounding hills and also over the pass on the south-east, leading to Killabuh. The reader will understand from the narrative that the attack on the Portuguese was made by land, from the vicinity of el-Matrah, the assailants marching from thence by one of the Wadis towards the out posts beyond the town wall, where the wells are, the weakest point and the most difficult to defend.80 THE IMAMS OP ^OMAN. they fired upon them. They had also suspended an iron chain in the air from the tower, now called after my father the 'Tower of Muhammad-bin-Razik,' to the tower now known as ' el-Murabba/' [the Square Tower,] whereto were attached iron cradles, in which men were concealed who dis charged shot on any of the Imam^s followers who ventured near them. They also occupied the whole of Jebel-es-Saaly as well as Jebel-el-Makulla, and the reverberations caused by the shots fired by those concealed in these mountains and in the other posts, especially towards nightfall, were continu ous, whilst their guards and spies went to and fro with news night and day. 1 They showed the greatest determination and were everywhere on their guard. The two batteries they filled with their experienced gunners and musketeers, so that they cut off all means of access to them from without. The war in the meantime between them and the Imam^s troops was of varying fortune : the Portuguese were unable to expel their assailants from their position at el-Matrah, neither could the latter force an entry into Maskat. The Imam's soldiers, however, used to creep up to them by stealth, and kill any they saw near er-Rawiyah, or any that showed themselves near the place called Hallat-eVAjam- wa-'l-Jariyah, and elsewhere, and they used to shout out to the Portuguese on the walls: ' Come forth, and let us settle matters! Brave men do not hide themselves within forts and behind walls.' They assailed them, moreover, with all kinds of reproaches, but none ventured out, through dread of coming in contact with the swords and spears of the besiegers. On the other hand, the latter were deterred from an assault by the guns and muskets of the besieged. 1 Owing to the peculiar configuration of the cove a single discharge reverberates through the hills like a continuous peal of thunder, as I had frequent opportunities of noticing during my two visits to M&amp;skat in 1860- 61. As here related of the Portuguese, the Arab and Beloochee sentinels from their different posts on the forts and watch-towers still keep up an incessant chanting shout from 7 p.m . till sunrise, each appearing to vie with his comrades who shall shout the loudest.11 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 81 The struggle went on in this way for a long time, and the Imam and his party began to despair of effecting an entrance into the place, when a dispute arose between the Portuguese and one of the Worshippers of the Cow, to wit, the poly- theist named Narutem, a Banian, 1 on the subject of betrothal and marriage. This Nanltem had a beautiful daughter whom the Portuguese commandant, whose name was Fareira [Pareira], had asked in marriage, through the medium of one of the clergy attached to their church in the Western Fort, who acted as Pareira's agent in the matter. Nanltem, however, declined the match on behalf of his daughter. Pareira then offered him a large sum of money, but he still refused, and sent the commandant the following answer : The thing which the commandant requires neither becomes him nor me, he being a Christian, whereas I am of a different religion. He and his co-religionists hold it lawful to drink wine, and to eat ox-fiesh and the flesh of other animals. Neither in ancient nor modem times have Christians inter married with us.' Pareira's messenger replied : ' \ ou must not thwart the commandant, for he has been most ge nerous towards you; he has given you the keys of the shops in the two forts and elsewhere, has made you agent for the treasury and country, and has invested you with plenary authority, and he declares that if you do not give your con- There are more Banians in Maskat than in any other town of Arabia. Wellsted estimated them in 1836 at 1,500, and remarked that their number was rapidly increasing. ' They possess a small temple there, are permitted to keep and protect a certain number of cows, to burn their dead, and to follow in other respects the uninterrupted en joyment of their respective religious tenets....They mostly embark at Porebunder, from the north-west provinces of India, and in the prose cution of their commercial avocations frequently remain for a period of fifteen or twenty years....They constitute a body of the principal mer chants of the place, and almost monopolise the pearl trade from the Persian Gulf. They enter as largely into the supply of grain from India, and have also extensive dealings in Indian cloths and piece- goods.' Travels in Arabia, vol. i. pp. 18-21.■r'f W t , (e , ;; ^1 ! ^ || ' S ■ Hil Mil ••• v 4 ■ yj' nv' ; 1 1 ■ 3 ^ ;j liH - • rHH &gt; i T ■ i ' /• '} j 82 THE IMAMS OF OMAN. sent to the marriage 1 am to marry your daughter to him forcibly, and he will punish you and yours with fines, penal ties, and other punishments, such as have not been inflicted on any before you. Hence, I advise you to yield, for he who disobeys great sovereigns is sure to bring on himself de struction.' Pareira^s messenger added many more speeches to the same effect. When Narutem perceived that there was no chance of escaping from the difficulty except by strategem, he assumed a soft manner towards the messenger and feigned obedience, saying to him : cc Go and tell the commandant to be of good cheer, and be you of good cheer also, for I shall take this matter in hand and shall rely on him.' The two then set out together and found Pareira holding a grand review of his soldiers on the Island, and after they had saluted him with the salute which Christian subjects give to their com manders, he took his visitors by the hand, and dismissing the troops led them up to his quarters, and said to them: 'What have you decided about the betrothal?' To this Nardtem replied : 'Know, O Amir, that the affair submitted to me by your messenger is a very difficult one, owing to the difference of our religions, and because it is unprece dented ; but, if it must be so, grant me a year's delay that I may prepare the dress and ornaments which virgins amongst our women usually wear on marriage. Their fine jewellery can only be made by the goldsmiths of the town of Najinah,[?] but a year will suffice to prepare it; and you know that what is future is not far off. In the mean time, as one acquainted with the vicissitudes of war, I venture to give you a little advice. The ruler of 'Oman, Sultan-bin-Seif, has not yet withdrawn his sword from you; he lies in wait for you with forces as numerous as the drops of rain, and his soldiers are exulting over you because you are afraid to accept their challenge; hence you are humbled and he is triumphant. I fear, moreover, that his forces will assaultTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 83 you by climbing over the walls like lions. He is even now— so my mind tells me—waiting for an opportunity to attack the town and to force an entry through the gates, and L have no doubt that, with the aid of a few ladders, they might effect that object and thereby leave you nothing but the two forts, the Eastern and Western, wherein they would besiege you closely. In that case you would be cut off from all supplies, more especially water, which he would prevent you from obtaining, and you and your followers would be driven to great distress through thirst, for the besieged cannot stand out against a lack of water. Now, the water which is in the tanks of the two forts is foul and swarms with insects, and causes disorders in the bowels, and if obliged to drink it the besieged will be sure to suffer from its effects. Again, the gunpowder and provisions which are stored in the two forts and the two batteries are old and worthless. My advice therefore is that you let off the water now in the tanks, have the tanks well cleaned, and fill them with fresh water before the siege begins. Let the powder also be brought out and restored by being pounded anew. The old wheat, too, should be discarded, and new grain substituted in its place; for if we put new wheat with the old, the weevils in the latter will enter into the new and spoil it, and fatal sickness will be the result.' Narutem added much more to the same effect, on hearing which Pareira commissioned him to carry out these suggestions, for he knew nothing of the artifice intended thereby, and judged that the counsel was sincere. Moreover, he agreed to defer the marriage for one year, as he had been requested. When Narutem had taken out all the water, provisions, and ammunition from the two forts, he wrote a letter to the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif and sent it by one of his own people. The substance of the letter was as follows; You, 0 Imam of ^Oman, have been at el-Matrah besieging the Portuguese in Miiskat for a long time, and hitherto you have effected81 the imams of 'oman. nothing. If you wish to succeed you must proceed in this way : on Sunday next march quickly to Maskat, for I have done so and so to them because they acted in such and such a manner towards me about the betrothal. Consequently, the two forts and the two batteries are now quite stript of weapons, provisions and ammunition, and the community do not cany their arms on Sunday, that being their feast day, and are engaged in drinking wine and in playing on musical instruments; therefore if you can make your way into Mas- kat you will gain your object. Then hasten on with your force to the entrances of the two forts and set fire to the closed gates, for I have removed all the old gunpowder therefrom, and have replaced it with powder sprinkled with vinegar, which can do no harm. Do not delay beyond the day which I have named, for if you reject my advice, and follow the contrary counsel of others, you will not succeed though you prosecute the siege for years. When the Imam read the letter and Narutem's advice as contained therein, and the trick which he had pla3 T ed off upon the Portuguese in consequence of the dispute con nected with the proposed marriage—the truth of which the writer affirmed with a solemn oath—he sent an affirmative reply by the messenger, but kept the matter secret from the nobles and commons. The messenger returned in high glee to Narutem, who on hearing that the Imam had ac quiesced in his proposal was so overcome with joy that he could have flown to the Imam without winofs. On the appointed Sunday the Imam offered up the Prayer of Dawn with his people, and then the Prayer of War; after which he prayed that God would give the Muslims the vic tory over the polytheists. He then marshalled his troops and set forth with them at quick time. On reaching the summit of the mountains forming the Great Wadi of M&amp;skat, he selected those who should attack the wall, and those who .should rush onward to the entrances of the two forts andTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 85 the other posts held by the Portuguese from Muskat to el-Mat rah. The selection was made singly and collectively; that done, he set out at their head, they calling out: ' God is most great ! 0 God, make the orthodox Muslims victorious over the beardless Portuguese!' On reaching the suspended chain they fired their muskets and hurled stones at those who were in the cradles, but their fire was not returned, for God restrained the occupants and they retreated. When the assailants reached the walls they placed ladders against them and seized all the gates, none of the Portuguese opposing them but such as were reeling drunk, incapable of firing or using their muskets, beyond striking with them at random. These the Mussulmans dispatched with sword and spear, and left them prostrate like the trunks of uprooted date-trees. They then formed into two divisions, one of which rushed towards the Eastern and the other to the Western fort, against which they planted ladders; and when the garrison attempted to fire upon them the guns would not go off, because the powder had been tampered with. Then there was a hand-to-hand struggle, and swords, spears, and dag'gers were broken on heads and breasts, the Imam and his soldiers eventually taking possession ot the wall, the two forts, the two batteries, and all the other- posts of the enemy, with the exception of the tower called Kasim, which was still held by a famous Portuguese war rior, named Cabreta [Cabrera?], who sallied out against the Imam and his army whenever an opportunity offered. He had a large garrison with him, but one day when he came forth and attacked the Mussulmans who occupied the Island he was obliged to retreat before them. They pursued him as far as the cotton-market, where there was a great light, but they assailed him with spears and rotten eggs, and slew him and all his followers. So God rid the Mussulmans of him and his polytheist companions. Then the Imam directed a party ol his followers tothe imams of 'oman. march against the garrison of the fort at el-Matrah, Ho had hardly given the order when the Commandant came in person to the Imam asking for quarter, and offering to sur render the fort. The proposal was accepted by the Imam, and he accordingly desisted from all hostilities against him or his comrades. The Portuguese had now but two large ships to oppose the Imam; one of these, which was anchored a good way from the fort of el-Matrah, opened fire upon the town, which was answered by the guns on the fort, but the shot did no harm, owing to the intervening distance. The other ship began to fire upon the inner portion of Maskat, and the shot went beyond Sidab, doing much damage j 1 on seeing which the Imam ordered the Mussulmans to attack it, but they excused themselves, saying that such large ships could only be successfully attacked by vessels of equal size. Thereupon the Chief of the Auxiliaries 2 said to him: ' 0 Imam, lives are valuable, and are only sold for a large price: if you provide the requisite money I will find the men.' To this the Imam consented ; whereupon the Chief of the 1 I am at a loss clearly to understand this passage. It is tolerably- certain that the vessel was not in the cove-harbour, for there it would have been exposed to the cross-fire from the forts and batteries. Most probably it was cruising not far from land, behind the Eastern fort, where there is low ground, and from whence the distance to the town would be between a mile and a mile and a half ; but then the direction of the tire against the city walls would be west, whereas Sidab, as already mentioned in a preceding note (p. 79), is about four miles to the southward. The only solution of the difficulty which occurs to me is that the vessel, in moving up and down the coast, occasionally discharged shots at Sidab, which is situated near the shore. I have given the dis tance between that village and Maskat on the authority of the Minister to the late Seyyid Thuwainy. Niebuhr, who marks its position in his Tab. xv, {Voyage en Arabie, vol. ii.) but incorrectly styles it 41 Soddof,' makes it much less. 2 In the original, Sdhib-el-Maghytith. I have not met with the de signation elsewhere, but, judging from the context, the business of the officer so styled was to obtain mercenaries for the Imam's service.

On their arrival he gave them a large sum of money, and they then proceeded to attack the two ships in small boats. And God gave them the victory over the infidels, for they destroyed the two ships and killed all the polytheist crews. 1 The Imam then appointed Bin-Belarab, el-Yaaruby, Wali of Maskat, and left many soldiers with him. He enjoined him to be firm, to decree what was lawful and to forbid what was unlawful, and to administer justice impartially. He also exempted Narutem and his family from taxation, as a recompense for the services which he had rendered to him and to the Mussulmans. When the Imam returned to Nezwa, all the people, high and low, congratulated him on his achievements and on the conquest which God had vouchsafed to the Mussulmans through him over the polytheists. He then ordered a Jihad- against the polytheists who swept the coast of the sea of 1 The incidents mentioned in the foregoing account of the capture of Maskat from the Portuguese is so strikingly characteristic of the two contending parties, and the tone throughout is so dispassionate and im partial, that there can be little doubt of the general authenticity of the narrative. Owing to the negligence, or the national pride, of cotem- porary Portuguese annalists, we possess no version of theirs wherewith to compare it. Captain Alexander Hamilton's story of the immediate cause of the attack, which he attributes to the insolence of the Portu guese governor in having sent 44 a piece of pork, wrapped up in a paper, as a present to the Arab king' who was then in the neighbourhood with his army, in reply to a civil message from the latter requesting him to grant him 44 the liberty of his markets to buy provisions,' is pre sumably a fable, with as little foundation as most of his other trans mitted hearsay statements regarding the Arab King and his ' Queen, who was of Seid extraction, who are a tribe or family descended from Mahomet, by Fatima his daughter and Ali his apostle.' See Pinkertoris Voyages and Travels, vol. viii. p. 285.

'Oman, and he successfully assaulted ed-Diyul, and Daman, and Killabuli, and 'Akkah, 1 and many other towns and vil lages of the polytheists, so that the latter were in great dread of him, and their incursions upon 'Oman were re pressed, and all aid given by them to the enemy was cut off. The booty taken from the polytheists was very great. Then the Imam commenced building the renowned fort at Nezwa, which was completed in twelve years and cost 1 By ' ed-I)iyul' there can be no doubt that the island of Diu, in the province of Gnzerat, is intended. Hamilton gives the following details of the attack upon that place by the 'Omanis at this period :—' About the year 1670 the Muscat Arabs came with a fleet of trankies, and took an opportunity to land in the night, on the west end of the island, with out being discovered, and marched silently close up to the town, and at break of day, when the gates were opened, they entered without resist ance. The alarm was soon spread over the town, and happy was he who got first to the castle-gates, but those who had heavy heels were sacrificed to the enemy's fury, who spared none; so in a moment that fair city, and churches, were left to the mercy of the Arabs, who for three days loaded their vessels with rich plunder, and mounted some cannon in a beautiful church and fired at the fort, but to little purpose. The governor, who was in the castle, could soon have obliged them to move farther off the castle by the force of his heavy cannon, yet the priesthood forbid him firing at the church on pain of excommunication, lest some unlucky shot should sacrilegiously have defaced some holy image. But the Arabs, like a parcel of unsanctified rogues, made sad havoc on the churches' trumpery, for besides robbing them of all the sanctified plate and cash, they did not leave one gold or silver image behind them, but carried all into dismal captivity, from whence they never returned that I could hear of. And as for the poor images of wood and stone, they were so rudely treated by those barbarous infidels, that they came well off if they lost but a limb, and I saw some who lost their heads,' Pinkertoris Voyages, vol. viii. p. 312, Ddman is in all probability the town of the same name, situated on the coast of the Northern Concan, and still held by the Portuguese, Killabuh, Niebuhr's ' Kalboo' and the ' Khulboo' of our charts, is a small town situated in a cove formed by the north-east point of the Riyam cove and Ras Maskat. The Portuguese appear to have kept possession of it for some time after their expulsion from Maskat and el- M&amp;trah. As the place is destitute of fortifications they probably held it with their ships. 'Akkah ; I am unable to identify this place.* I THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 89 lacs ol silver and gold. He also renewed the aqueduct of the tank between Azka and Nezwa; and, what through in advertence has been overlooked by most historians, ho fostered trade, and during his Imamate sent men to India, Persia, Sanaa, el-Basrah, and 'Irak to supply the demand of the Mussulmans for horses, arms, etc. To sum up, Oman revived during his government and prospered : the people rested from their troubles, prices were low, the roads were safe, the merchants made large profits, and the crops were abundant. The Imam himself was humble towards the one Almighty God, compassionate towards his subjects, &gt; condoning their offences when such condonation was law ful, and never keeping himself aloof from them. He used to traverse the streets without an escort, would sit and talk familiarly with the people, and saluted the small and great, the freeman and the slave. Thus he persevered in ordaining what was lawful and forbidding what was unlaw- &gt; ful, always observing the fixed times of prayer, until he died. God have mercy upon him and absolve him! He died on the morning of the 16th of Dzul-Kaadah, a.h. 1059 [11 th November 1649], 1 and was buried where the Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid was buried. 1 This date is evidently wrong, for the year is the same in which Nasir-bin-Murshid, Sultan-bin-Seifs predecessor, is recorded to have died, (see p. 74.) That date is presumably correct, since Nasir-bin- Murshid was recognized as Imam a.d . 1624 (p. 54) and ruled twenty- six years (p. 74), which would bring the date of his death to a.d . 1650 or 1649. The mistake—probably of the transcriber—is most unfor tunate, because it prevents our ascertaining the exact time when the I'ortuguese were expelled from Maskat—a point on which all available authorities differ. Hamilton places that event 'about the year 1650;'' , Niebuhr, u about 150 years' after their capture of the town in 1508 ; Wellsted says that ' Seif-bin-Sultan [it should be Sultan-bin-Seif] drove the Portuguese out of Muscat in 1658,' which tallies with Nie- buhr's approximate statement. The Arabic narrative leads us to infer that Sultan proceeded with his army from er-Rastak towards Mdskat very shortly after the death of his predecessor in April, 1649. From the remarks made by the Banian, in his treasonable correspondence with 12the imams of 'oman. BEL'ARAB-BIN-SULTAN, bin-seip-bin-malik-bin-bei/arab-bin-sultan, el-ya^aruby. On tlie death of his father Sultan-bin-Seif, Belarab his son was nominated to succeed him, and on being confirmed in the Imamate he exhibited justice and integrity in his administration, following therein the example of his good predecessors, and was eulogized by the people. He used to be called Abu-^l-'Arab [the Father of the Arabs] on account of his liberality. He rebuilt Yabrin and erected the lofty fort there; he himself also removed thither from Nezwa, and established a college there for masters and pupils, whom he supported, insomuch that science was greatly cultivated through his munificence, for many students profited thereby who became learned theologians and renowned scholars. Among the former were the sheikh Khalf-bin-Sinan, el- Ghufiry, and the sheikh Said-bin-Muhammad-bin-'Obaidan, and many others; and among the latter Rashid-bin-Khamis, el-Habashy, el-Aama, and others. The last-named sheikh wrote several poems in eulogy of his patron and was liberally rewarded by him. Serious differences then broke out between Belurab-bin- the Imam, it appears that the latter had been besieging Maskat for 'a long time' before the stratagem for the capture of the place was submitted to him. Taking all these circumstances into consideration on the one hand, together with other facts stated in the narrative, and, on the other, the difficulty of keeping a large body of Arabs together for a protracted period, I am disposed to fix the date of the final expulsion of the Portu guese from Maskat some time during the year 1651-52. The erroneous date given for the death of Sultan-bin-Seif, namely, a .ii. 1059 = a.d . 1649, I should alter to a .n. 1079 = 1668; this would allow for the twelve years spent by him, subsequently to the expulsion of the Portuguese, in building ' the renowned fort at Nezwa,' and also give a reasonable duration to the reigns of his two immediate successors, Bel'arab-bin-Sultan and Seif-bin-Sultan, the latter of whom is recorded to have died a.n. 1123 = a.d , 1711.THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 91 Sultan and his brother Seif-bin-Sultan, and many of the learned Fakihs and devout sheikhs of 'Oman who took part in them, following the counsels of the demented, brought upon themselves the most deplorable calamities. In conse quence of this state of affairs, Belarab-bin-Sultan left Nezwa and set out towards esh-Shamal; on his return, the inhabit ants refusing to admit him, he went to Yabrin. Then most of the people of 'Oman assembled to confer the Imamate on his brother Seif-bin-Sultan, but none really approved of that step, so that there arose dissensions among them and the cabal was dissolved. Nevertheless, Seif commenced hos tilities against his brother and captured all the forts oPOman from him, and treated as enemies any of the Arabs or Hadhr who sided with him, so that eventually the fort of Yabrin was the only place left in his possession. Many battles were fought between the two brothers, and Belarab was called by some ' Bala-'l-'Arab' [the Calamity of the Arabs], whilst others designated Seif as the ' Scourge,' and Belarab as the 'Butcher,' on account of the blood which was shed through their quarrels. As to the people, they were divided in their opinions respecting the rivals : some main tained that Belarab was the rightful Iraan and his brother a rebel; others that Seif was justified in supplanting Belarab, both parties following the bent of their inclinations. Ulti mately, Seif-bin-Sultan assembled a large army and besieged his brother in the fort of Yabrin, where the latter died during the siege. It is recorded of him that despairing of receiving any succour from without, he performed his ablu tions and two raka'as, 1 and then prayed for death, for which he was prepared. God heard his petition, and he died forthwith. This fact has been mentioned by more than one learned and trustworthy authority. On the death of Belarab 1 The Muslims have five set times for prayer during the day, each of which prayers is said to be of so many rakaahs, or inclinations of the head.92 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. his followers asked for quarter and permission to leave the fort. Seif granted the request and thereafter ruled over the whole of ^Oman, none of the el-Yaarubah or others con testing his right to the Imamate. SEIF-BIN-SULTAN. Seif-bin-Sultan continued to administer the Imamate with justice and impartiality, protecting the weak from the op pression of the strong, and all the tribes of 'Oman, as also those of other provinces, submitted to him. He attacked the Christians, and drove out some of them from their settlements, capturing from them Mombasah, the Green Isle [Pemba], Kilwah, and other places. 1 Moreover, he im proved a large portion of 'Oman by making water-courses and planting date and other trees. He amassed great wealth—in the pursuit of which he was very intent—and 3 It is much to be regretted that the author gives so few details of the reign of Seif-bin-Sultan, one of the most enterprising and successful of the Im&amp;ms of 'Oman. The places on and near the east coast of Africa mentioned as having been captured by him from the Christians were taken by the Portuguese a.d . 1503. The date usually given of their expulsion by the Arabs is a.d . 1G98, which would be during the administration of Seif-bin-Sultan. ' In that year,' writes Colonel Kigby in his Report on the Zanzibar Dominions, ' the inhabitants of Mombassah, rendered desperate by the tyranny of their Portuguese rulers, sent a de putation to Saif-bin-Sultan, the Imaum of Oman, requesting his aid to free them from their oppressors; the Imaum, in consequence, sent a naval force which wrested Mombassa from the Portuguese. Keelwa and other settlements soon after submitted to the Imaum, and the Portu guese were massacred or expelled from all their possessions north of Mozambique.''

Hamilton relates that in 1694 the Maskat Arabs made a descent on Salsette, an island adjoining Bombay, and ' committed great depreda tions in plundering and burning villages and churches, killing the priests, and carried about 1,400 captives into irredeemable slavery.' In the following year ' they quarrelled with the Carnatic rajah, a potent prince by land; yet they came with their fleet and plundered and burned the towns of Barsalore and Mangalore, two of the best and richest towns on that coast.

He persevered in the same praiseworthy course till he died at er Rastak, where also he was buried, and where his grave is well known. His son Sultan built a fine dome over it, which was subsequently destroyed by the Wahhabis. He died on Thursday night, the 3rd of Ramadhan, a.h . 1123 [4th October, 1711.] The learned sheikh Muhammad-bin-'Arik, el-'Adwany, states in his history that when the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan died he had acquired possession of one-third of all the date- trees in 'Oman ; that he repaired the es-Sayighy canal at es-Rastak, the el-Yazily in ezh-Zhahirah, the el-Kuthir at el-Hazm, and also the el-Barzaman and el-Misfah canals; that he possessed seven hundred male slaves and twenty- eight ships ; among the latter were the el-Falak, the el- Malk, the er-Rahmany, the Kaabras, and the es-Salihy. The el-Falak was armed with eighty large guns, each gun measuring three spans at the breech. He also planted at Naj'iman-Barkah 30,000 young date-trees and 6,000 cocoa- nut trees, besides those which be planted at Bir-en-Nasha- wah, er-Rassah and el-Mandzariyyah. Moreover, he acquired the property of the Benu-Lamk and the Benu-'Adiy of the Wadi-es-Sahtan, by purchase. His appointed successor was his son, SULTAN-BIN SEIF, [II] bin - sultan - bin - malik-bin - bel^arab- bin - sultan- bin-mali k- bin-bel'akab-bin-sultan-bin-muhammad, el-ya'aruby. At God's command this Imam made war on the enemy by sea and land, and encountered the Persians in many places. He removed from er-Rastak to el-Hazm, and built the fort there, expending thereon all the money which he inherited from his father, besides borrowing many additional91 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. lacs from the property of the mosques and other religious endowments. He also attacked and took el-Bahrein 1 , and none in 'Oman or elsewhere ventured to oppose him. The people of 'Oman stood in great awe of him. The following anecdotes illustrate this fact:—One day he went out accom panied only by his slave Abu-Saidin. When they reached the rear of Dahas-es-Salimiyyin—others say it was below et-Tabakah—they saw an Arab mounted on a camel laden with two baskets of dates, which he was bringing from ezh-Zhahirah to the market of er-Rastak. Thereupon the Imam directed his slave to keep back, but to come forward quickly when he beckoned with his hand. The Imam carried a small skin of water on his left side; the Arab a sword and shield slung over his shoulder. When the former approached the Arab, who did not know whom he was addressing, the Arab accosted him, saying: ' 0 carrier of the water-skin, give me a drink out of your skin.' To which the Imam replied : ' And what if I chose to refuse ; what would you do then ?' ' Why, if Seif-bin-Sultan were not in existence,' rejoined the other, ' I would smite you with this sword.' According to another version the Imam then began to bandy words with the Arab, in order to dis cover whether he belonged to any of the gangs of professional plunderers whose outrages were now restrained through fear of punishment. During the colloquy he made a sign to the slave, who joined him instantly and began abusing the Arab roundly, saying: ' How dare you contend with the Imam ? ' Jso sooner had the Arab recognized that the free man was the Imam and the slave his servant, than he cut the ropes which bound the packages of dates and set off at a gallop, never stopping until he reached the country of the Benu- 1 From the Persians, who had occupied it on the expulsion of the Portuguese and their tributary the 'King' of Ilormuz from the latter island, a.d . 1622, by Shah 'Abbas, aided by an English fleet of five ships belonging to the East India Company.THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 95 Mahrali. Ou returning to er-Rastak the Imam made in quiries about the Arab, and was informed that he belonged to the ez-Zafity, and had laden his camel with two baskets of dates. The Imam then dispatched one of his soldiers with the value of the dates, and directed that if he did not find the man he was to ask for his relations and give them the money; also to tell them that they would find the dates at a place which he indicated. The messenger accordingly departed, and not finding the man he inquired of his rela tives where he was, but they had heard nothing of him since he had started on his journey. The soldier then told them the whole story and gave them the money, whereupon they set out and found the two baskets of dates in the spot which had been named to them. This act on the part of the Imam led them to extol him exceedingly. Following the footprints of their kinsman's camel they discovered him hiding among* the Benu-Mdhrah, from whence he accom panied them to their home. The following is another illustration of the awe which this Imam inspired :—There was a merchant of Yemen who used to come to er-Rastak every year with goods, such as Wars 1 and other articles, and sojourned there, buying and selling, till the opening of the monsoon, when he generally carried his profits to Maskat, from w r hence he sailed to 1 Wars, sometimes called 'bastard saffron, is a dull red, sand-like powder, tlie product of a shrub resembling the Sesame. 1 was informed at Aden that the plant grows to five feet in height and bears clusters of round seeds which are covered with pollen, which when removed by rubbing or shaking the seed-clusters together forms the 11 ars. 1 lie shrub is a native of the interior of Yemen, where the liars is used by females to impart a light yellow tinge to the skin. It is exported to 'Oman and the Persian Gulf, where it is largely used with the same object. Much of it goes to Surat, in India, where they use it to dye silks. The Arabs also use it as an internal remedy in leprosy, and exter nally as a lotion to remove freckles. An inferior kind of liars is brought to the Aden market from Hurrur, in Africa.

He came one year, as was his wont, and sold and bought, and made much gain. When about to return home he was seen by an Arab of ezh-Zhahirah leaving the market with two bags of money on his shoulder. The Arab's cupidity being excited, he followed the merchant stealthily until he was out of er-Rastak and saw him put up for the night in the plain called Shaab-el-Merkh, and stole the two bags while the owner was asleep. He then rode off quickly on his camel to an Arab named Salim-bin-Huwaishil, a sharp fellow, whom the Imam had made Tracker 1 to the Beit-el- Mal, and who resided at 'Araar, of er-Rastak. The robber hailed this man during the night, and told him what he had done to the Yemeny, and then offered him one of the bags of money, pressing him to take it. Salim reflected for some time, but finally accepted it, and said : ' Go your way, and should the Imam order me to follow up your footprints I will deceive him.' So the robber galloped his camel and at sunrise reached the village of Wadam, where he sold the camel to one of the Arabs of the place, and then hiring a small craft embarked in it for Mekran. 1 Literally, ' whom the Imam had appointed Ii-kass-il-dthar, '' that is, for following the footprints or traces. Wonderful stories are told by the Arabs of the success of these Pathfinders ; but the wonder is diminished in some degree when it is remembered that the Bedawin tribes generally have distinctive marks, called Uthrah, made with an iron instrument called Mintharah, upon the under part of their camels' feet, in order to be able to follow their footprints on the ground. The custom of having men specially trained for this purpose appears to have prevailed in Sind during the rule of the Amirs, and is, I believe, still retained as a part of our police system in that province. ' The Zemindars of villages,' writes Lieut. Hugh James in his Re-port on the Perguna of Chandookah, in Upper Sind, ' took care to have at least one tracker with them, and these were brought up to their business from boyhood, and were gene rally very expert: thefts have been traced after an interval of time had elapsed, and at a distance from the place of perpetration, almost incre dible,—through the running stream, over the newly-ploughed field, through standing corn, over the hard soil of the desert, through the crowded town, and along the high road, the criminal was hunted down.' Bombay Oovernment Selections, No. xvii. p. 741. lyTHK IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 97 When the merchant awoke and missed the bags of money he smote his cheeks and rent his clothes for grief, and returned at once to er-Rastak and reported what had be fallen him to the Imam. The Imam immediately sent for Salim the Tracker and directed him to follow up the traces of the robber. Salim then inquired of the Y^meny where the robbery occurred. The latter did not know the name of the place, but from his description of it the Imam concluded that the spot was that known as Shaab-el-Merkh. Salim accordingly set out early that day and returned at sunset. On being asked by the Imam what discovery he had made, he replied: ' O Imam of the Muslims, I have gone over all the road and I saw a mass of footprints, but I was unable to trace them. Despise me, if you will, but exonerate me from blame, for the unknown is full of mys teries/' Thereupon the Imam looking intently at him said : ' O Salim, such an excuse will not save you from punish ment ; but go again and trace the footprints, for my mind tells me that your heart has prompted you to some wicked act. Therefore discard all excuses, for the soul is not subjected to evil beyond what the merciful Lord per mits.^ The officers also of the Imam said to him : ' Go, 0 Salim, and do what the Imam bids you; perchance God may direct you in the right way.' Salim accordingl} 7 set out, but returned again with the same answer as before. The Imam then ordered him to be flogged, and forbade any one to give him water during the punishment. When he was on the point of dying from thirst, one of the Imam's principal officers took pity upon him, and begged the Imam to allow Salim ten days to follow up the traces and discover the thief, urging that God might aid him in finding him. Salim accordingly set out to follow up the traces, and saw from the foot-print of the camel of his accomplice that it had turned off towards the seacoast. He traced it first to Wadam, and then up to the house of the man who had is98 the imams of oman. ii i • ^,1 • i : r .■ 'i purchased it, where he found the camel. ' Where is the owner of this camel?' said he, addressing the man. 'I am its owner now/ , he replied ; ' for I bought it of an Arab of ezh-Zhahirah for so much, and he took the price from me and then embarked for Mekran.' ' He is a thief,' said Salim, and stole a large sum of money from a stranger, a merchant of Yemen, and the Imam has ordered me to apprehend him.' Had I known that, ' said the other, ' I would have seized him myself and sent him to the Imam.' ' Then, hire a boat for me,' rejoined Salim, ' for I must find him out wherever he may be/' He accordingly hired a boat for him belonging to some poor seafaring people, and when Salim reached Mekran he followed the robber's traces, which led him towards Bakdhy [or Yakdhy] on the way to Sind. Marching quickly onward he came up with him near Sind, and found him asleep under a tree, with the bag of money under his head. He snatched the bag away from him and drew his sword, but the man fled and disappeared out of sight. Salim then hired another boat to Wadam, and on arriving there requested the Arab who had purchased the camel to go with him to the Imam to relate all that had taken place between him and the robber, informing him at the same time how ho had found the thief asleep under a tree and taken the bag from him. They accordingly set out together, the man riding the camel and Salim walking before him. On reaching his own house Salim entered it alone, and put the money which he had shared with the robber into the bag which he had lately seized from him. When they came into the Imam's presence Salim narrated the whole affair; whereupon the Imam dismissed the purchaser of the camel, remarking that he was blameless, but he ordered Salim to be put in chains and kept in prison for a year. On releasing him he said : ' Were it not that judgment should be based on clear evidence I would have had your hand cut off. Now, begone!' and he appointed another to bethe imams of 'oman. 99 Tracker in his stead. On Salim's return with the money the Y^meny merchant had taken it from him^ and counting it had found it all right. He then thanked the Imam and set out for Maskat, many persons attached to the Imam escorting him. On reaching Yemen he told the story to high and low, and all praised the Imam, saying : ' Glory to the upright Imam ! there is none like him.' On the death of the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif great discussions arose among the people of 'Oman, and party spirit ran very high. The illiterate wished him to be succeeded by his son Seif-bin-Sultan, then a boy, who had not attained to puberty or to the age of discretion. The intelligent and pious, on the other hand, were for giving the Imamate to Muhenna-bin-Sultan, judging him fit for it and capable of administering it; moreover, they did not see how he could be kept out of the government. The Imamate of a child, in their opinion, was not proper in any way: such an Imam could not lead in prayer, how then could he preside over a state, conduct the administration, have at his disposal the wealth, and blood, and revenues of the country ? Neither would it be lawful for him to be placed in charge of the wealth of God [pious endowments], or the property of orphans and absentees; for possessing no power over him self, how could he exercise authority over others ? But when the sheikh 'Adiy-bin-Suleiman, edz-Dzahly, saw the bent of the people towards Seif-bin-Sultan, although he did not concur in it, yet, fearing that a revolt might arise among them, and that, armed as they were, blood might be shed, he said, in order to appease and disperse them, ' Seif-bin- Sultan is your Amam' 1 Thereupon they proclaimed him Imam, and a public salute was fired on the occasion. The news was accordingly spread throughout 'Oman that 1 For the difference between the words Imdm and Amdm, see note 1, p. 8.100 the imams of oman.

Vide p. 89.the imams of 'oman. 101 forward as his rival, until at length he yielded to their solicitations and then went and seized Maskat, which he effected without an army, because the inhabitants were not loyal to Muhenna-bin-Sultan. The name of the Wali of Maskat at the time was sheikh Mas^ftd-bin-Muhammad, es- Sarimy, and the Imam Muhenna was then at Falj-el-Bareily, near el-Jauf, which the common people call el-Jau. On hearing the news he returned to er-Rastak, and used his utmost endeavours to induce the people of 'Oman to aid him against his enemies; they not only refused, but they humbled him and besieged him in the castle of er-Rastak. The malcontents were then joined by Yaarub, who had arrived from Maskat, and who after besieging him for a long time at length invited Muhenna to come out of the castle, promising him and all those who were with him quarter. Muhenna, reflecting on his condition, saw that he was hopelessly degraded, that he had nothing to expect from the people of 'Oman, since all those whom he had considered as brothers had proved themselves traitors, and that it was useless to continue the contest. He accordingly accepted the proposal and descended from the castle, by which act he virtually abdicated the Imamate. On reaching Yaarub, the latter ordered him, his relatives, followers and party to be bound and flogged, in violation of his promise; subsequently some of Yaarub's men fell upon him while he was in prison and murdered him and his companions. Yaarub-bin-Belarab was now master of the situation, but he did not claim the Imamate, for that belonged of right to his cousin Seif-bin-Sultan, who was still under age and incapable of carrying on the administration; but he assumed the regency, whereupon all the forts and tribes submitted to him. These occurrences took place, a.h . 1133, [ a.d. 1720.] Matters remained in this state for some time, when the Ivadhi 'Adiy-bin-Suleiman absolved Yaarub from all his102 the, imams of 'oman. past misdoings—such as his oppression of the Muslims, his attack on and murder of Muhenna, and his forcible seizure of the government. He declared Yaarub assoiled from the guilt of rebellion and discharged him from making restitution for the wrongs he had perpetrated, on the ground that repentance acquits the penitent. Thereupon they conferred the Imamate on him, a.h . 1134, [ a.d . 1721.] YA'ARUB-BIN-BEL'ARAB having assumed supreme power all the people submitted to him. After remaining a few days at er-Rastak he went to Nezwa, where he arrived on the 29th of Shaaban of the same vear. The people of er-Rastak, however, were not satisfied that he should be Imam, preferring Seif-bin-Sultan to him. They accordingly commenced writing to Belarab-bin-Nasir, Seif-bin-Sultan's uncle, who was then residing at Nezwa with the Imam, exciting him to rise up against the latter. Thereupon he left Nezwa, on the 6th of Shawal of the same year, and went to Balad-Sit, where he engaged the Benu- Hinah, on oath, to join him in the revolt, he promising to remove from them the disabilities which the Imam Nasir- bin-Murshid had imposed upon them with regard to building, carrying arms, etc. He also gave them large presents and they followed him to er-Rastak, where they carried on hos tilities until they succeeded in driving the Wali Nebhan from the town. They also set fire to the gate of the castle and burnt the whole of its front, whereby many men and chiefs of the Benu-Hinah and the Benu-^Adiy lost their lives; some say that the number amounted to one hundred and fifty persons. Many valuable books also, such as the Baydn-esh-Shdra', and the el-Musdnnif, and the Kitdh-el- IstaMmah, and the volumes of the Tilsimdt, and other unique books were burnt on the occasion. Through this fire, however, a large treasure was discovered in the castle. When the news of these occurrences at er-Rastak reachedthe imams op 'oman. 103 Yaarub-bin-Belarab he mustered his array and gave the coraraand to sheikh Salih-bin-Muhammad-bin-Khalf, es- Saliray, and ordered hira to march on er-Rastak. The latter proceeded as far as the town of el-'Awaby, but finding that there was no chance of his being able to force an entrance into er-Rastak he returned to Nezwa. On the other hand, Belarab-bin-Nasir wrote to the then Wali of Maskat, Hirayar-bin-Munir-bin-Suleiraan, er-Riyamy, to surrender that place to hira, which he accordingly did. The town of Nakhl also was surrendered without opposition. Next, the same party dispatched an array under Malik-bin-Seif-bin- Majid, el-Yaaruby, to Semail, which he captured without hostilities, and the Benu-Ruwahah 1 having accompanied him 1 The Benu-Ruwahah, who have been already mentioned at p. 55, are, I conceive, the representatives of a tribe of the same name who derive their origin from Ruwahah, (born about a.d . 450,) the father of one of the branch families of his progenitor el-'Abs, a descendant of 'Admin through Ghatafan and Kais-'Ail&amp;n, and therefore of the same stock as the en-Nizar (see note, p. 3) and the el-Kuraish. They were settled in Nejd, on the confines of the Ilijaz, but do not figure in Arab history till towards the middle of the sixth century, when Zuhair-bin-Jadzimah, one of their number, was the recognized head of all the Benu-Ghatafan. The murder of the eldest son of Zuhair by the Benu-Gh&amp;ny, a branch of the 'Amir-bin-Sa'asa'ah, on his way home after having conducted his sister as a bride to Nu'mjin, king of el-IIirah, and the dispute which subsequently arose under Kais, his son and successor, between the el- 'Abs and the Benu-Zhubyan, a kindred tribe, about the famous race of the two horses, Dahis and Ghabra, led to a series of ' Days' or Battles between the el-'Abs, the el-Ghatafan, the er-Ruwahah, the Benu-'Amir and several other tribes, which lasted for upwards of forty years, and form the theme of some of the most chivalrous and romantic of Arab ante-Islamitic stories. On the reestablishment of peace between the contending parties Kais-bin-Zuhair refused to participate in it. Ac cording to several original authorities quoted by M. de Perceval, he afterwards embraced Christianity and eventually went to Oman, where he died. See Hist, des Arabes, vol. ii. pp. 411, 419, 459 et seq.; also, I resnel's Premiere Lettre sur VHistoire des Arabes avant VIslamisme, Paris, 1836, for some interesting details of these 'Days' of the Arabs of Nejd at that period.

This took place in the month of Dzul- Kaadah of the same year. Yaarnb subsequently set out from Nezwa with his followers and the Benu-Riyam and the Kadhi ^Adiy-bin- Suleiman, ez-Dzahly, and came to Azka. Its inhabitants received him gladly and entertained him with feasting, and declared, moreover, that they were for him—loyal to God first, then to him. Thereupon Yaarub summoned Malik- bin-Seif to evacuate the fort; on his refusal, Yaarub com menced hostilities by opening fire upon him with two guns. At this juncture the soldiers of the Benu-Hinah, headed by the Sahib-el-'Anbur 1 of the people of er-Rastak arrived, and falling upon YaaruVs force routed them and obliged him to return to Nezwa. Meanwhile the sheikh 'Adiy-bin- Suleiman had set out for er-Rastak. On his arrival there he was seized by BelaraVs officers, who bound him and also the Kadhi Suleiman-bin-Khalfan, and then killed them both; whereupon the people of er-Rastak dragged their bodies through the streets like dead cattle. This took place on the day of the great Hijj of the same year. Then the Sahib-el-'Anbilr and many other persons went to Nezwa and begged Yaarub to quit it in order to save further bloodshed. He eventually yielded to their entreaties, on condition that he should be allowed to go to the fort of Yabrin and there be unmolested. Having received their pledge to that effect he quitted Nezwa, (whereupon his Imamate came to an end,) and set out for Yabrin, the Sahib- el-'Anbur taking possession of the castle of Nezwa, from which he ordered a salute to be fired, and proclaimed the Imamate of the coast.

He wielded supreme authority for two months all but three days, when it pleased God that what was predestined by Him should take place, and that the people of 'Oman should undergo the conse quences of their fickleness and love of change. It having been settled that Belarab-bin-Nasir should be regent for Seif-bin-Sultan, the chiefs of the tribes and towns came to congratulate them. Now, Belarab-bin-Nasir had let fall certain threats against some of the ti'ibes, espe cially against the Benu-Ghafir 1 and the people of Behla. So when Muhammad-bin-Nasir-bin-'Amir-bin-Ramthah, el- Ghafiry, el ; Uttaby, esh-Shakily, el-Ghafiry, came with a party of his followers, Belarab-bin-Nasir uttered some menaces against him, in consequence of which Muhammad- bin-Nasir left in anger, and forthwith began writing to urge Yaarub-bin-Behlrab and the people of Behla to revolt against Belarab, going himself to the Bedu of ezh-Zhafrah, the Benu-Naim and the Benu-Kutb, 2 and others, on the same errand. Belarab on the other hand summoned the 1 The name of this tribe occurs here for the first time ; thenceforward they exercised considerable influence in the affairs of 'Oman, and do so still. In fact, by a figure of speech, the two principal parties into which the population is said to be divided are styled el-Ghafiry and el- Hin&amp;y or Hinawy, anglicd, Hinavi. The Benu-Glulfir, as already stated in the Introduction, are of Ma'addic origin, and their allies are mostly of the same stock, whereas the el Ilinay are descended from Kahtan (Joktan). The former are chiefly confined to the northern districts, and their ordinary confederates, mostly settlers from Nejd, occupy the south ern shores of the Persian Gulf. 2 The Benu-Na'im inhabit el-Bereimy and the neighbouring district; the Benu-Kutb that between the coast and el-Bereimy. The former are said to be able to muster 20,000 and the latter 8,000 fighting men. 1410G the imams of ^oman. chiefs of Nezwa to come to him, and having collected to gether many of the principal men he lavished attentions upon them and directed them to do homage to Seif-bin- Sultan. He then mustered a large army and placed it under the command of his brother, Suleiman.bin-Nasir, whom he ordered to lie in ambush on the road to the Wadi- Semail for Yaarub, while on his way to er-Rastak. He further directed the people of Nezwa to join the army, but they having entreated the chiefs of er-Rastak to that effect he exempted them. The army then marched as far as the village of Fark, where they passed the night, and the people of Nezwa invited them to a feast. While so engaged they heard the report of guns from the castle of Nezwa, and on inquiring what it meant they were told that Yaarub-bin- Belarab had entered the castle ; so they returned to Azka. Belarab-bin-Nasir had also dispatched a troop against Yaarub by the route to ezh-Zhahirah, but when they reached Behla the people there seized them. Another troop was or dered to proceed to the Wadi of the Benu-Ghafir and to attack that tribe, but they were repulsed, and those who escaped returned to er-Rastak. Yaarub, on the other hand, sent a troop to Azka, with two guns. On reaching it they attacked the fort, but were obliged to retreat with the loss of several men. Then he sent another troop to Azka, which took up a position in the garden called el-Gharibat, from whence they cannonaded the fort for ten successive days. At this juncture Malik-bin-Nasir 1 came to Azka, and he and his followers being joined by the inhabitants of the place they attacked the troops of Yaarub, but were defeated, and the Bedu who acted with Yaarub fell on Saddy and Haret- er-Raha, belonging to Azka, and plundered them ; they also burnt the sugar-factories and the residence of Himyar- bin-Munir. Another troop was dispatched by Yaarub against el-Yamn, of Azka, but they were repulsed.

Then Malik-bin-Nasir summoned the tribes of the esh-Sharkiyyah, 1 and a great many responded to the call; the Benu-Hinah 2 also joined him with many men. These being now assembled at Azka he attacked Yaarub's army, which had been reinforced by the people of et-Tabul and el- Manzaliyyah. The attack was made on Friday, at sunset, and there was a great battle between them ; the fire of the musketry resembled thunder and the glittering of the spears was like lightning, and the hosts of Yaarub were scattered, and more lives were lost on his side than on the side of Malik-bin-Nasir. The total killed on both sides is said to have been three hundred; but God knows. Then Malik moved with his forces to the town of Manh, and a detachment of them suddenly attacked the Falj of the Wadi-'l-Hajar and killed several of the inhabitants, plun dered it, destroyed the cultivation, burnt its sugar-factories, and then proceeded to besiege Nezwa. They pitched their camp near the mosque el-Makhadh, of Fark, some of the re sidences of which they burnt, ravaging the country and doing all kinds of damage. Thereupon the people of Nezwa and YaaruVs soldiers who were with them sallied forth to attack them, and there was a sharp conflict between the two parties with no decisive result; nevertheless, frequent skir mishes with loss of life continued between them, which caused great distress to the people of Nezwa. At length there was a great battle between them which at one time threatened to go against Malik's party, who could not re- 1 The reader will bear in mind that by esh-Sharkiyyah, or the East erns, the inhabitants of the north-eastern portion of 'Oman proper, in cluding the towns of Nezwa and Behla, are indicated. 2 Note the Benu-Hinah, a name synonymous with el-Hinay or el- Hinawy, confederated against the Bonu-Ghafir.108 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. treat because they were surrounded on all sides by the enemy ; some, however, managed to get away, but those who stood fast, seeing that there was no chance of escape, awaited the result with the patience of heroes. Then, noticing that the people of Azka were engaged in picking up the arms of those who had fled, Malik^s detachment suddenly fell on them in a body, routed them, and pursued them as far as the place called Janiir-el-Khuwaisah, near the gardens of el-'Akr, killing and wounding several. On that day many were slain on both sides. Malik returned to his encamp ment, and hostile incursions and skirmishes continued be tween the two parties. Then, leaving a few men in charge of his camp, Malik marched with the remainder to within a short distance of the gardens of el-^Akr, with the object of entrenching them in one of the enclosures, the walls of which he intended to pierce with loopholes for musketry; but the people of Nezwa issued forth against them, and after a sharp contest which lasted an hour Malik-bin-Nasir was killed and his force overwhelmed ; so they returned to their camp, much dispirited by the death of Malik. Hostilities, however, still continued between the two parties, until Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, arrived with his army from el- Gharbiyyah, 1 after his operations and severe battles in that quarter, some of which took place in the Wadi-es-Sakal, some also in el-Jauf—which the vulgar call el-Jau—another at Dhank, at el-Ghabby, and elsewhere. On reaching Nezwa he ordered an attack on those who were encamped at Fark, which he led in person, and having surrounded them a con test ensued which lasted from dawn till the evening. When night approached Muhammad ordered his men to retire below the Wadi, so as to leave an opening for the enemy, which the latter took advantage of to escape, but they were 1 El-Gharhiyyah, or the Westerns.

The Imam was ill at this time and unable to move, so Muham mad remained a few days at Nezwa, the siege of which had lasted two months all but six days. Then Muhammad-bin-Nasir marched with his army against er-Rastak. On reaching it his followers asked permission to attack the ^Anbur 1 of 'Aly-bin-Muhammad, el 'Anbury, generally known as the 'Anbur of the walls of er-Eastak, but he refused, bidding them not to move till they were attacked by the opposite party. That was not long delayed ; whereupon a fierce struggle took place between them in which ^Aly the Sahib of the 'Anbur and a number of his men were slain. Then Muhammad returned to Falj-esh- Sharat, and the day after he marched rapidly within the precincts of er-Rastak. Thereupon Belarab-bin-Nasir came to him soliciting quarter, which he granted, on condition that Belarab surrendered the fortress of er-Rastak and all other forts in his possession. This having been agreed to, they proceeded in company to the fortress of er-Rastak. Now, Belarab had a mind to act treacherously, but Muham mad being habitually wary was on his guard ; hence he re fused to go into the fortress except with his forces. These he accordingly sent in before him and then followed, thereby frustrating BelaraVs conceived stratagem. When Muham mad had occupied the fortress and castle his followers began to plunder the town and seized a number of free persons, some of whom were sent out of 'Oman and sold as slaves. They appropriated everything that fell into their hands as a retribution for what had been done by the oppo site party, more especially for their conduct towards 'Adiy- bin-Suleiman, edz-Dzahly, and Suleiman-bin-Khalfan, both Kadhis of the Muslims, and to the Imam Muhenna-bin- Hultan and his uncle's relations. 2 —' Verily, God will not 1 For the meaning of this word see a preceding note, p. 104. 2 See pp. 101, 104.no the [mams of 'oman. change what is in a people until they shall change what is in themselves.' 1 Yaarub [-bin Belarab ?] died at Nezwa, thirteen nights before the expiration of Jumad-el-Akhir, a.h . 1135 [17th Feb., 1733,] (Muhammad-bin-Nasir was at er-Rastak at the time), and the inhabitants concealed his death for fifty days, fearing lest the enemy might take advantage of it to in crease their strength. O After Belarab-bin-Nasir had surrendered all the forts which he held to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, the latter ordered him to be bound. Muhammad was now in possession of all the strongholds, with the exception of the Maskat de fences and the fort of Barkah ; the former being still in the hands of the Benu-Hinah and the Wali, Ja'id-bin-Murshid, el-\ aaruby, (not the person of the same name who was brother to the Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid, for that Ja/id was killed during his brother's rule in the district of es- Sirr, appertaining to ezh-Zhahirah, as has already been re lated). The Benu-Hinah now expelled Ja'id-bin-Murshid from Mdskat, and he went to the town of Nakhl, while Muhammad-bin-Nasir remained at er-Rastak. (A report was then spread that in consequence of the death of Yaarub [bin-Belarab ?] Seif-bin-Sultan had become Imam, although he had not yet attained to the age of discretion.) Most of the inhabitants of er-Rastak at this time were scattered in the mountains and valleys, insomuch that one hundred children and women are said to have died of thirst in a cave near the village of el-Mahalil, where they had taken refuge from the outrages of the Bedawin of the esh-Shamal, 2 whom Muhammad-bin-Nasir had taken into his service.

Most of Edhmah-bin-Matar's followers did not know good Arabic, and they could not distinguish Muhammad^s friends from his enemies. 2 At this time Khalf-bin-Mubarak, el-Hinay—known as el- Kusdyyar, [the Short,] whose place was at el-Ghasb, of er- Rastak—was at Maskat, but on hearing of Muhammad-bin- Nasir's proceedings he went to Barkah, fearing that it might be invaded; but Muhammad not knowing of his being there, and thinking that it had been left in charge of his followers, sent 'Aly-bin-Muhammad, el-Harasy, nick named Abu-Jama, to demand the surrender of the fort. When he arrived Khalf ordered him to be killed, whereupon 1 The Benu-Ka'ab, sometimes pronounced Cha'ab, are a branch of the Benu-Na'im, and occupy the district near 'Obra, in ezh-Zh&amp;hirah.

Colonel Taylor, formerly Political Agent at Baghdad, writing of the same people, says : ' Their language is dif ferent from that of the other tribes, and as there are many individuals among them remarkable for the redness of their hair, it may fairly be concluded, as the Arabs declare, that their language is formed from cor ruptions of the dialects of their Portuguese and Danish ancestors, en grafted on an impure stock of the Arabic.' Bombay Government Selec tions, No. xxiv. p. 12. Julfar, in the neighbourhood of the district referred to, was occupied by the Portuguese for nearly a century and a half (see note 1, p. 8).

Greatly incensed at this outrage, he ordered an expedition to march to Barkah against Khalf and his retainers. He divided his army into troops : the troop under Rahmah-bin-Matar consisted of the people of Julfar and others who had joined them; another was under Hamad-bin-Hamad, el-Kulaiby; another under Rashid- bin-^Abdallah, el-Kaaby; another under Ahmed-bin-Rashid, el-Ghafiry ; another under 'Adiy-bin-Suleiman, el-Dzahly ; and another under Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el Harasy. Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, accompanied the army and encamped with them at el-Masnaah. 1 Now, prior to this, Kaza, ed-Darmaky, had joined Khalf- bin-Nasir, 2 el-Hinay, el-Kusayyar, at Barkah, as an auxiliary, and between him and Rahmah-bin-M^itar, el-Hdwaly, there were some old-standing feuds; so when the latter was en camped at el-Masnaah, Kaza wrote him this defiance: 'You shall not come to us but we will come to you.' On re ceiving the letter Rdhmah proceeded with his followers in advance of the main body of the army, and sent out scouts towards Barkah, who returned with the intelligence that K&amp;za and his men were approaching. Rahmah met them at a place called el-Kasm and rushed upon them, mounted on a mare, his people following him. Then there was a sharp fight between them, in which Kaza and ten of his ad herents were slain and the remainder were routed; Kadhtb, el-Hawaly, also was slightly wounded. Thereupon Rahmah descended to el-Hufrah in order to rest his followers. Next, he dispatched scouts to Barkah, who reported that Khalf-bin-Mubarak, el-Kusayyar, was on the move with a 1 Wellsted's ' Mesndah' and the 'Messna' of Capt. Brucks's chart. It is a small place on the coast, with a fort, twelve miles to the south east of Suaik, containing about one hundred and fifty inhabitants. 2 From the attached soubriquet this is evidently the same person who in the preceding page is called Khalf-bin-Mub&amp;rak. Both names are indiscriminately applied to him in the sequel.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 113 large force by land and sea; these he encountered near Barkah and there was a fierce engagement between them. Then Muhammad-bin-Nasir joined Rahmah-bin-Matar with the main body. Rahmah's followers possessed guns which were drawn over the ground; the men attached to these guns were ordered to fire on the boats occupied by KhalPs people, and the shot reached the sea, scattering them and killing many, and forcing Khalf to retire into the fort of Barkah for safety. In the mean time, Muhammad^s followers were busy slaying or taking prisoners all KhalPs retainers they could lay their hands on; the remainder who escaped took refuge in the fort. Then Muhammad went with his force and occupied the mountain of the Benu-^Amir, where he encamped and laid siege to the forts of es-Sib and Barkah ; but Khalf managed to escape by night and took a boat to Maskat, while Muhammad-bin-Nasir kept patrolling from Barkah to es-Sib and Bushir, in the hope that Khalf would offer him battle; but the latter did not venture to do so, because his followers were few compared to those of Muhammad. So Muhammad and his men continued to be siege the garrisons of Khalf in the forts of Barkah and es- Sib for the space of four months. When their provisions were expended Muhammad re turned with them to er-Rastak and remained there. He dismissed Rahmah-bin-Matar and all the people of ezh- Zhahirah whom he had collected together, and was then seized with small-pox, which covered his whole body and nearly caused his death. After God had restored him to health he proceeded to ezh-Zhahirah, leaving Muhammad- bin-Nasir, el-Harasy, as Wali over the fortress of er-Rastak, associating with him the Sahibs of Behla, and Sinan-bin- Muhammad-bin-Sinan, el-Mahdziir, el-Ghafiry. The latter occupied the castle, and the former all the other forts, besides acting as Wali over er-Rastak on behalf of Muham mad-bin-Nasir.THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. Muhammad-bin-Nasir bad sojourned at er-llastak for two months, and when he set out he took with hira Seif-bin- Sultan, el-Yaaruby, together with all the el-Yaarubah who were in er-Rastak, but he left Belarab-bin-Xasir bound there. 1 On reaching Makniyat 2 he summoned the tribes of the ezh-Zhahirah and 'Oman, and they furnished him with many soldiers ^ the 13enu-\as also responded to his call and came to him in lai'ge numbers, so that his army amounted at that time to 12,000 men. With these he marched towards Y&amp;nkal, and halted at the I alj-el-Munadherah, from whence he wrote to them [ot \ ankal] to surrender their forts; but they returned him no answer though he persisted in the demand for several days. He then left them and moved towards the upper side of the channel leading to the Falj-el-Muhaidath, in the low land, where he was met by the Benu-'Aly and their allies of the people of Y ankal, and a fierce battle took place between them in which many of the Benu-'Aly were slain; among them their renowned warrior and principal sheikh, Suleiman-bin-Salim. On Muhammad-bin-Nasir's side, Salim-bin-Ziyad, and, as is stated, Salim-bin-Murad, el-Ghafiry, and Seif-bin-Nasir, esh-Shakily, were killed, and a few were wounded. 1 For the reader's guidance through the complicated details of the ensuing narrative, it may be useful to state that they refer to the con test, then at its height, between the el-Ghafiry, the el-^ a'arubah and the el-Ilinay tribes. Muhammad-bin-Nasir, who was at the head of the former, had already succeeded in displacing the el-Ya'arubah regent who acted on behalf of the young Imam, Seif-bin-Sultan, of the reigning dynasty, and had moreover seized the latter and his immediate relatives, whom he carried about with him as hostages wherever he went. I he el-Ilinay, headed by Khalf-bin-Kasir, or Mubarak, took part against the el-Ghafiry, but it is clear that they had separate ends in view, and aimed at securing the supremacy for themselves. Muhammad-bin- Na,sir, as we shall see presently, eventually succeeded in obtaining the Imamate. 2 Makniyat is situated in the district of ezh-Zhahirah, about forty miles from 'Obra, (see note 2, p. 41.)

Arabia, vol. ii. p. 282.THE IMAMS OP OMAN. 115 When the parties separated, Muhammad descended into the channel of the el-Muhaidath, from the upper side, and besieged them. There was now a constant discharge of musketry and guns between them, for Muhammad had brought up a gun from el-Ghabby. which they replied to with the guns of the fort. Then another collision took place between them, in which Muhammad-bin-Nasir-bin-Mu- hammad-bin-Khalf, el-Kuyudhy, who was Wali over Dhank and its dependencies on behalf of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and one of the cousins of the latter, was slain ; some also of the people of Yankal fell on the same occasion. Muham mad's followers then destroyed the enemy's tank, so that having no water to drink they were obliged to ask for quai'ter, which was granted to them, on condition that they surrendered the fort. This having been agreed to, Muham mad forthwith took possession of it. Intelligence then reached him that Said-bin-Juwaid, el- Hinay, had entered es-Salif, in conjunction with the es- Sawawafah and a number of the Benu-Hinay. He accord ingly headed his army and marched to es-Salif. On arriving there he summoned Said-bin-Juwaid and the inhabitants of es-Salif to surrender. This they refused, but the es-Sa- wawafah and the people of Tinaam submitted to him. He then ordered his troops to assault the fort of the el- Marashid, belonging to es-Salif, which they scaled and then razed it over the men and women who were in it. Said- bin-Juwaid having asked for quarter and permission for himself and his followers to go to their homes, Muhammad not only accorded the request, but also pardoned him and supplied him with provisions; but the fort of es-Salif still held out against him. Nevertheless, the el-Munadzerah sued for peace when they heard what had befallen the el- Marashid in the destruction of their fort. He granted their request and left them in possession of the fort, on condition that they would be loyal to him in future; but he laid siege » ii. 05;116 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. to the es-Sawawafah, cut down their date-trees, and spread desolation among them. He then dismissed his Arab auxiliaries, retaining only the Benu-Yas and the tribes of the Hadhr. He continued the siege of the es-Sawawafah for two months, at the expiration of which they were amnes tied, on condition that they razed their fort. While Muhammad-bin-Nasir was engaged in the foregoing campaign in ezh-Zhahirah, Khalf-bin-Nasir, el Kusayyar, collected a large army and marched on er-Rastak. When he arrived there, Sinan-bin-Muhammad, el-Mahdzur, sallied out against him ; a sharp conflict ensued between them, which resulted in the victory of Khalf-bin-Nasir and the death of Sinan, only a few of his followers escaping. After another battle with Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Harasy, the latter capitulated, and the people of er-Rastak submitted to Khalf. Then Khalf marched to Nakhl, accompanied by a levy from the el-Muawal 1 and others from el-Yemeniyyah, entered the town, attacked and burnt the gate of the fort, and expelled therefrom Ja'id-bin-Murshid, who with a num ber of the people of Nakhl went and took possession of Finja, belonging to Nakhl, in lieu of that place. Siba'-el- 'Amury also went and captured the fort of Sohar. He was sincerely devoted to Khalf-bin-Nasir's party. When news reached Muhammad-bin-Nasir of the capture of the fortress of er-Rastak and the fort of Nakhl by Khalf- bin-Nasir, he did not deem it prudent to return to the former town until he had settled with Yankal; so he pressed on the siege of that place. This delay on his part led Khalf-bin- Nasir to march against el-Hazm, the fort of which was held by 'Omar-bin-Mas'ud-bin-Salih, el-Ghafiry, on behalf of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry. Khalf invested the 1 The Wadis of the el-Ma'awal are situated between er-llastak and the small town of Nakhl.

See Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. p. 241.THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 117 fort and summoned 'Omar to suiTonder it, promising him quarter; but he refused, and then wrote to Muhammad-bin- Nasir apprising him of his critical condition and that they had only a small tank of water left. When this letter reached him Muhammad-bin-Nasir redoubled his efforts against es- Salif, which eventually yielded, and its people were amnestied, on condition that they demolished the fort. This affair of es-Salif settled, and there being no longer any opposition to him in that quarter, Muhammad-bin-Nasir collected a large army and marched to er-Rastak; but, without remaining to carry on any operations there, he turned aside and went to el-Hazm. On arriving there he attacked Khalf and his followers, and utterly routed them ; many of them were slain, and Khalf himself fled to 1' alj- esh-Sharat—others say to 'Araar—where he took refuge in the house of one of his principal friends. After remaining a few days at el-Hazm, Muhammad set out again for ezh- Zhahirah, to the great joy of the people of er-Rastak, who dreaded his paying them a visit. He stayed a short tirao at el-Ghabby, and then went on to Saifam and encamped in the Balad-Sit, and summoned its inhabitants to give him their allegiance. On their refusal to do so he attacked and killed many of them. Next, he attacked 'Aridh, of the Benu- 'Adiy, and forcibly reduced them. 1 hen Ghamr and all the Benu-Hinah, the inhabitants of the el-'Alu, submitted to him. After these achievements he returned to Nezwa, where he remained six months, and sent to the garrison of the Hujrah of the district, pertaining to the town of Manh, demanding their submission. On their refusal he dispatched a force against them, besieged them, and ordered their date- trees to be cut down. After receiving their allegiance he left them and returned to ezh-Zhahirah. About this time the people of Nakhl attacked and expelled Khalf's garrison from the fort. When intelligence thereoi reached Khalf he set out for the W T adis of the el-Maawal118 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. with a large army, the men of the el-Maawal joining liim, and attacked Nakhl and invested its fort, which was then held by Mnrshid-bin-'Adiy, el-Yaaruby. He continued the siege for four months, but provisions and ammunition failing him he proceeded to burn the gate and effected an entrance through a breach in the walls. Thereupon the garrison took to flight, some going to their allies, the el-Jamimy, others to Semiiil, and others to the Benu-^l-MuhiUhal, vul garly called the Benu-Muhallal. Thereupon Khalf took possession of the fort, and then those of the el-Jamimy and those of the inhabitants of el-Janat, who had taken refuge with the Benu-M-Muhalhal were reconciled to him. (This, in my opinion, is more correct than the former account respecting Khalf and the people of Nakhl, for Khalf only entered Nakhl once.) When the people of Nakhl saw that Khalf had prevailed against them, some of them, accompanied by Ja/id-bin- Murshid—others say by Murshid-bin-'Adiy, el-Yaaruby— went and took possession of Finja and expelled its inhabitants. Subsequently, that is, after Khalf and Muhammad were killed in the affair at Sohar, and the administration was in the hands of Sultan-bin-Seif, these men left Finja and re turned to Nakhl; but God knows. (According to another account, after Khalf-bin-Nasir, el- Kusayyar, had captured the fort of Nakhl and the el- Jamimy had sued for peace, he agreed to pardon those of Nakhl also who had taken refuge with them, at the solici tation of the people of el-Janat, but after Khalf and his troops had left, and they had settled themselves among the people of el-Janat, they conspired with their friends among the el-Jamimy and those of their party who occupied the other Hujrahs to seize the Hujrah of el-Janat from the Benu- 'l-Muhalhal. This conspiracy is said to have been entered into out of revenge for KhalPs treachery towards the el- Jamimy, after ho had given them quarter and solemnlyTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 119 engaged that they might occupy their Hujrah as heretofore; but when he went to Maskat, where he remained a few days, he proceeded from thence to the Wadi of the el-Maawal, and suggested to them that the Hujrah of the el-Jamimy should be destroyed. These agreeing with him they marched together, took the inhabitants by surprise during the night, and killed many of them, those who escaped taking refuge at et-Tau and Semail; the remainder asking quarter were allowed to occupy other residences in the district. When Khalf left them it was then that they and their comrades, who had taken shelter with the Benu- ; 1-Muhulhal, concerted about seizing the Hujrah. Besides these refugees there were others of their number, who were hid in the bath, unknown to the Benu-'l-Muhalhal. AA hen the preconcerted night arrived they rushed on the garrison while the latter were asleep, their swords making great havoc among them, and succeeded in capturing the Hujrah. Those who escaped fled to the Wadi of the el-Maawal, who, joining them, they together attacked the people of Nakhl, and there was a great battle between them. Then Khali assembled a large army, and went to the support of the el-Maawal against Nakhl; the consequence was that the courage of the former was increased while that of the people of Nakhl diminished, so that they abandoned the Hujrah of el-J an ah, fled from Nakhl, and joined their companions who had found refuge at F inja. Then Khalf demolished the Hujrah of el-Janah, and as not one of the people of Nakhl remained in that place he divided it amontj the Benu-Hinah, who occupied it until the reign of Seif-bin-Sultan, when he had reached the years of dis cretion, and the Mussulmans had set him up as Imam. It was then restored to its proprietors, the people of Naklil, and the latter made over Finja to its rightful owners. 1 his I judge to be the most correct account of the transaction; but God knows.) Then Muhaminad-bin-TSasir assembled a laigo aim\ and120 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. !i marched to the district of the el-'Awamir, whom the Benu- Hinah and the Al-Wahibah had joined, and there was a severe engagement between them, in which Muhammad gained the victory. On receiving their submission he collected a numerous force, obtaining men from Behla, Nezwa, Azka, and the mountains of the Benu-Riyam, and proceeded towards ezh-Zhahirah. When he had completed his levies he set out for the villages of Saifam, and on reaching el-Ghafat he summoned Sslid-bin-Juwaid and all the Benu-Hinah; but they refused to obey or to submit to him. So he made war upon the people of el-Ghafat and besieged their fort; but Said-bin-Juwaid managed to elude the besiegers and escaped with some of his garrison to Ydnkal, the people of which he induced to break their covenant with Muhammad and to join his side. Accordingly, many of the inhabitants of Yankal, as also of Sohar and other places of the el-Yemeniyyah, confederated with him against Muhammad and his party, and when he reached Dhamm a considerable number of the inhabitants of esh- Sharkiyyah, belonging to the el-Yemeniyyah, flocked to him, and letters were dispatched throughout el-Yeme niyyah soliciting the people to come to his aid. Intelligence of these proceedings having reached Muhammad-bin-Nasir he sent out scouts who reported the approach of the enemy. Muhammad accordingly directed his force to take up a position near el-Ghafat, where the contending parties met, and there was a sharp engagement between them, Muham mad and his army carrying off the victory. Said-bin- Juwaid was killed in this battle; also Ghasn, the Sahib of Yankal, and many of their respective followers, and the remainder were dispersed hither and thither. The body of Said-bin-Juwaid was dragged on the ground, like the carcass of a dead animal, in order to strike terror into the people of el-Ghafat. Thereupon they were summoned afresh to sub mit, but as they refused the siege was prosecuted against them with fresh vigour.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 121 Muhammad then returned to Yabrin, leaving Mubarak- bin-Said-bin-Bedr, esh-Shakily, as his lieutenant to con tinue the siege of the fort of el-Ghafat. He cut down their date-trees and prevented any supplies from reaching them; then when their provisions failed, after having killed and devoured every beast that they had, whether clean or un clean, and despairing of any aid from Khalf, they asked for quarter, which was granted, on condition that they de molished the fort with their own hands. This they did and then retired to another fort in the district. Mubarak-bin- Said having reported these proceedings to Muhammad-bin- Nasir, the latter sent Rashid-bin-Said, el-Ghafiry, to replace him, with orders to attack the people of el-^Akr. Mubarak- bin-Said returned accordingly to his own district, and Rashid-bin-Said besieged el-'Akr, the inhabitants of which contended with him until their provisions failed, and they saw no chance of receiving succour from Khalf, when they sued for peace and obtained it, on condition that they razed their forts. Thereupon all the people of Saifam submitted to Muhammad, and after Rashid-bin-Said had obtained a similar recognition from the Benu-Hinah he returned to Muhammad. Muhammad-bin-Nasir then made large levies of Bedu and Hadhr, and when he had mustered a strong army he marched against the el-Jiyush, who had assembled in el-Mudhaiby and er-Raudhah, headed by Khalf-bin-Nasir, el-Kusayyar, who had a large force with him of the el-Yemeniyyah and of the Arabs of Barkah and its dependencies. When the two armies came in sight of each other there was a great fight between them, which resulted in the overthrow of Khalf, who retreated with his followers into the Hujrah of el- Mudhaiby. Peace was subsequently concluded between Muhammad and the people of el-Mudhaiby, on condition that they expelled Khalf and his adherents. Khalf accord- 16122 the imams of 'oman. /•va Hn f- .H'J i in V^l ' if'! IH 1 M*'sl I ingly went to Ibra 1 whore the el-Harth 2 joined him. On hearing this, Muhammad repaired to Ibra and ordered the el-Harth to send Khalf away; on their refusal he began cutting down their date-trees. However, perceiving even- tually that they were unable to cope with him, they agreed to expel Khalf and made peace on that condition, l\.lialf then set out for Maskat and Muhammad and his followers returned to Yabrin, from whence he went to Nezwa, where he assembled the learned men and begged them to appoint some one in his place [as regent] in behalf of Seif-bin- Sultan, as he was tired of waging war. But the people, especially those of Nezwa, would not hear of his resignation, owing to their dread of Khalf-bin-Nasir, el-Kusayyar. (The governor of Nezwa at this time was sheikh Abdallah-bm- Muhammad -bin-Bashr-bin-Maddad.) So they assembled together in secret conclave at el- A.kr, Muhammad being with them, and they urged him day and night to assume the sovereignty, but he refused for a long time. At length, however, he acceded to their wish, on receiving their solemn promise of allegiance. They accordingly confirmed him in the Imamate, on the morning of Saturday, six days before the expiration of el-Muharram, a.h . 1137 [2nd Oct. 1724.] A salute was fired from the fort on the occasion, and a pio clamation was issued throughout Oman that MUHAMMAD-BIN-NASIR was Imam. On the following Friday he led the prayers at » Ibra is situated in an oasis on the confines between 'Oman proper and the province of Ja'alan.

Then Muni'-bin-Khanris, el-'Azizy, captured the fort of el-Ghabby, but Muhammad marched against him and ex pelled him. Muhenna-bin-'Adiy-bin-Muhenna, el-Yaaruby, also, together with some men of the Benu-Riyam, attacked Ghalet-el-Barkah, but after a conflict with Muhammad's followers he submitted to him, after which Muhammad returned to Yabrln. Then an Arab of the Al-Wahibah, 1 named el-Hark, a notorious highwayman, was summoned by Muhammad, but instead of obeying he went to Khalf- bin-Nasir, at Maskat, who received him. Thereupon Mu hammad marched out against el-Hark's companions, some of whom he seized and imprisoned at Yabrin; he also slaughtered their cattle. On hearing this, el-Hark came and humbly begged that his men might be released. Muhammad granted his request, on condition that he and his followers abstained from all disloyalty in future. Muhammad then assembled a large army and proceeded towards Semail by the Wadi-'l-^Akk and halted at Hassas, where all the Nizariyyah came to salute him, but the people of Upper Semail kept aloof and would not recognize him. So he marched against them on a dark night with a party of soldiers, whom he posted near the Hujrah of the Al-Sadd, and went forward himself accompanied by a Nubian slave, named Bakhit, and climbed over the wall by stealth, and said to the man on guard : ' Whom are you watching for r' ; He replied: 'For Muhammad-bin-Nasir.' 'I am Muham mad,' rejoined the other; 'rouse your comrades and advise them to offer no opposition.' So the man bawled out lustily 1 The A1 or Benu-Wahibah are one of the finest tribes in 'Oman and bear a high character for bravery and fidelity.

They occupy the district about twelve miles south of er-liastak.

These latter surrounded the room in which the Amir of the garrison had fortified himself, and then seized and slew him. The slave Bakhit was also killed on this occasion. On learning the death of their Amir his men took to flight, and Muhammad ordered the Hujrah to be demolished. According to another account, the Hujrah scaled by Mu- hammad and his slave Bakhit was that of the el-Bekriyyin, whose Amir, Bekr, having been slain, Muhammad ordered it to be razed, as he did also that of the Al-Saad; that, thereupon, all the people of Upper Semilil came and did homage to him, and he made peace with them, on condition that they paid the ZaMt. 1 The Benu-Ruwahah also came and did homage to him and swore to be loyal. After settling these matters at Semail, Muhammad went to es-Sib, where he abode several days and received the homage of the el-Maawal. Then he marched with his army along the seashore and attacked the Al-Saaly, and cut up a number of their mounted men, who, thinking that their assailant was Khalf, called out; ' Deal gently, O Khalf, with your allies and adherents P' After this affair Muhammad halted at el-Harady. Some time prior to the foregoing attack a dispute had arisen between Khalf-bin-Nasir, el- Kusayyar, and the el-Maawal who held the fort of Barkah for him, and who had consequently decided to surrender it to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, when they heard that he was at el-Harady; but Muhammad being ignorant of their inten tions left that place and returned to Semail. 1 Obligatory alms given, by those who can afford them, for the poor and other pious uses.

Having continued the siege for a long time, one of the inhabitants, named ; Isam, the wall of whose house joined that of the fort, came and told him that his present efforts would be unsuccessful. ' What must I do,' asked Muhammad, ' f to effect my object?' After describing the position of his house, the man said: I will come to you three nights hence and admit you into my house unawares to the garrison. When there, you can make an opening through the wall by which it will be easy for you to effect an entrance into the fort.' Muhammad having agreed to this proposal, on the appointed night his men made their way into the fort, and falling suddenly on the garrison put many of them to the sword; the remainder submitted. Thereupon Muhammad occupied the fort, and the people of Yankal who dwelt near it, as also those at a distance, did homage to him, and he amnestied them. He remained at Yankal many days. !None now ventured to oppose him either in ezh-Zhahirah, or among the people of el-Jauf, or throughout the territory of 'Oman: all submitted to him with the exception of K half-bin-Xasir and his partisans. Then Muhammad summoned all the Hadhr and Arabs who had given him their allegiance, and he also wrote to the Benu-Yas and their Arab allies, to the Benu-Naim and the Benu-Kutb and their respective confederates, and col lected together a large army, with which he marched to Sohar, taking with him Seif-bin-bultan and all the cl- Yaarubah. Sohar immediately submitted to him, and ho encamped his army in the Hallet -esh-Shiaah, where all the people of the villages dependent on Sohar came to do him126 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. homage, and none held out against him but the el-'Amflr, who garrisoned the fort. His treatment of those who re cognized him was just and impartial. When the garrison saw the strength of his army and the influence which he had acquired over the people by his up right conduct, their opposition faltered and they thought of surrendering the fort to him. At this juncture one of the sheikhs of the Al-Wahasha named Rabiaah-bin-Ahmed, el- Wahshy, who before Muhammad's arrival at Sohar had been unfairly treated by the Al-'Aziz, who had driven him from his post and plundered him of all he possessed, came to Muhammad accompanied by some of his principal men. To him Muhammad said: ' Go to your comrades, the el-'Amur, and advise them to evacuate the fortress before my troops take it by force.' To which the other replied: 'My sole object in coming to you from Dhank is to induce them not to engage in hostilities with you, by apprising them of the number of your army and of your determination to effect your object; and nothing but the kindness which I have received at your hands on former occasions has led me to undertake the task. And now I ask quarter on their behalf, and also that they may be permitted to retain their arms.' Muhammad having agreed thereto, Rabiaah proceeded to the fort, but on entering it he said to the garrison: ' Do not hesitate to fight him, [Muhammad,] for his force is weak and his allies are few.'' Encouraged by these reports some of them attacked Muhammad, who was at the head of his force, but they were utterly routed, with the loss of many of their number. Rabiaah having been taken prisoner he was brought to Muhammad, who ordered him to be released from his bonds, and then said to him : ' Do you desire to be replaced in your fort ?' (meaning that of Sohar) ' if so, return to it with your followers and hold the same position that you did before; but if you wish to go to Dhank, preferring to be without responsibility, departTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 127 thither in peace.' Rabiaah elected to return to Dhank, that being his residence and the home on which his heart was fixed. Muhammad accordingly dismissed the abject fellow who had fallen into his hands with all honour, and gave him an escort of foot and horse. The foregoing account is more trustworthy than the state ment that when Rabiaah was given his choice by Muham mad, either to go back to his fort or return to Dhank, he chose the former alternative and rejoined his adherents who garrisoned it; for it is scarcely conceivable that after Muhammad had amnestied him and spared his life he would have asked to return to the fort, more especially after he had seen the strength of Muhammad's forces and witnessed their bravery and determination. Moreover, two sheikhs, Maanlf-bin-Salim, es-Sayighy, and Khatir-bin-Hamid, el-Beda/iy—trustworthy men of that period—relate, that when Muhammad-bin-Nasir decided to attack Sohar he went from el-Ghabby to Yabrin, and sent letters to the loyal Hadhr and Bedu to come and join him.— That he marched with these reinforcements to Sohar, and then dispatched Rabiaah-bin-Ahmed, el-Wahshy, in advance, to advise those who held the fort to come over to his side.— That Rabiaah deceived them and urged them to stand fast as they were.—That when Muhammad-bin-Nasir entered Sohar, the Benu-Hinah and the el-'Amur, who formed the garrison, sallied forth, headed by Rabiaah-bin-Ahmed, and there was an engagement between them, which resulted in loss on both sides; nevertheless, the garrison was worsted and those who escaped took refuge in the fort. But Rabiaah- bin-Ahmed, el-Wahshy, who was wounded, was seized and brought into the presence of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, who, after ordering his fetters to be removed, told him that if ho wished to return to the fort he might do so; that if he pre ferred to remain with him he should be safe ; and that if he chose to go to Dhank he would send him thither. He128 THE IMAMS OP OMAN. H nOF i ■ elected to go to Dhank and was sent thither with a mounted escort. Muhammad took up his quarters at Sohar in the house of Mahmud-bin-Muhammad, el-'Ajamy [the Persian], most of his troops occupying the mosque and all the adjoining houses as far as the date-groves beyond the wall. On hearing that Khalf-bin-Mubarak, el-Kusayyar, had collected the Benu- Hinah of er-Rastak and Maskat, that the Arabs of the coast had joined him, and that he was encamped at Saham, Muhammad-bin-Nasir dispatched twelve thousand men towards esh-Shark. Meanwhile, Sohar and all its inhabit ants had submitted to him, and the fort alone held out against him. He had still a large number of the Benu-Yas, the Benu-Naim, and the Benu-Kutb with him, and he ad ministered the affairs of Sohar with exemplary justice. Then Khalf-bin-Nasir, perceiving that he was not a match for his rival, unless he could succeed in detaching the esh-Shamal Arabs from him, said to a Persian agriculturist of Sohar: ' Destroy some of your cultivation and go to Muhammad- bin-Nasir and tell him that his Arabs did it. If he asks whether you know who they are, say : two men of the Benu- Yas, two of the Benu-Naim, and two of the Benu-Kutb. If you do this I will reward you as soon as the army retires from Sohar.' He also gave him some ready-money in order to induce him to perpetrate the stratagem. The man did as he was directed: he destroyed some of his fields and then went to lay a complaint before Muhammad, saying : '0 Imam, the Benu-Yas, and the Benu-Naim, and the Benu- Kutb have ruined some of my cultivation.' Thereupon Muhammad asked : ' Do you know any of them ?' The man replied, ' Yesand he pointed out six men as the culprits—two from each of the three tribes. Muhammad then said to him : ' Fix the value of the damage done but the man replied : ' Money will not do me justice.' Muhammad next questioned the accused, but they deniedTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 129 any cognizance of the outrage; nevertheless, he dh'ected five hundred silver Mahmudis 1 to be given to the plaintiff. The man, however, stoutly refused the money, saying that he demanded justice, not an indemnity. Muhammad accord- ingly summoned the sheikhs and inquired which of their followers had injured the man's fields. They replied: 'He is a slanderer and a liar, and his charge is utterly unfounded ; for we are prepared to swear by God that no one belonging to us has destroyed his or any other man's cultivation.' Muhammad then ordered the sheikhs to be bound and beaten, they asserting their innocence all the while, but none heeded them. At length the plaintiff said: ' Now I am satisfied, and I do not want any finewhereupon the men were re leased, but towards night they started homewards without having asked Muhammad's permission, and in the morning all were missing. The cultivator having reported to Khalf all that had occurred, the latter ordered an attack upon Muhammad, whose force now consisted of the Hadhr only. Muhammad's scouts having apprised him of the approach of Khalf's army he shook his head, and said ; ' The hour is fatal to us and to them.' A severe engagement then took place below the fort, which resulted in the death of Khalf and the defeat of his followers. Thereupon Muhammad led 1 Wellsted gives the following as ' the coins in current use amidst the towns in the interior.

His followers carried him to the house of Mahmiid-eVAjamy, where he expired just as they reached the door. They concealed his death from the rest of the force for three days and buried him during the night. Muhammad's followers were equally ignorant that Khalf had shared the same fate. During this interval the garrison sent a letter to Muham mad by a woman of the adjoining quarter, offering to sur render the fort to him. At the said time a woman of the Hallet-esh-Shiaah went towards the fort to apprise the garri son that Muhammad was dead. These two women meeting on the way communicated to each other the news of which they were the bearers. Thereupon the one who carried the letter returned with it to the fort and told them that Muham mad was dead. They then told her that Khalf had met with a similar fate and that they had buried him in the fort, which intelligence she forthwith communicated to Muhammad's followers. On hearing this the men took to their animals and departed to their homes, none remaining but Seif-bin- Sultan and some of the el-Yanrubah; for Muhammad-bin- Nasir had always retained Seif-bin-Sultan near his person, both during peace and war. Seif-bin-Sultan then approached the fort, the gate of which was opened to him, and the gar rison came forward and said : ' The fort is yours and we submit to you.' He accordingly took possession of the fort and placed it in charge of his officers. From thence he proceeded to er-Rastak, which surrendered to him ; then to Nezwa by the route of the Wadi of the Benu-Grhafir, who accompanied him thither, and where the Kadhi, sheikh Nasir-bin-Suleiman-bin-Maddad, en Naaby, set him up, he being now of full age, as the Imam, on Friday, the first of llamadhan, a.h . 1140 [2nd April, 1728.]thk imams of 'oman. 131 SEIF-BIN-SULTAN. [restored a second time.] When intelligence of Seif-bin-Sultan's elevation to the Imamate readied Belarab-bin-Hirayar/ el-Yaaruby, lie was very indignant, especially with the people of Nezwa. He was then at el-Baztly, of ezh-Zhahirah, the people of which district set him up as Imam. Seif-bin-Sultan having left Nezwa went to Nakhl, then held by Jassas-bin-'Omair-bin- Ilashid, el-Harasy, who had been appointed Wali by Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, but on the death of the latter he refused to surrender the place either to the el-Yaarubah or to any one else. Seif-bin-Sultan having vainly sum moned him to his presence proceeded to the Wadi of the el-Maawal, who submitted to him and tendered him their allegiance. He also dispatched his uncle, Seif-bin-Nasir, to Maskat, which was made over to him by the Benu-Hinah. Then Belarab-bin-Himyar went to Nezwa, where some recognized and others opposed him. From thence he set out with his forces against the Benu-Ruwahah, but they evaded him ; so he began to cut down their date and other trees and to destroy their water-courses, and some of the people were killed on account of their disaffection to him and their attachment to Seif-bin-Sultan. The latter, there fore, sent a force under his brother, Belarab-bin-Sultan, to their aid, and there was a great battle between the two par ties, which resulted in the overthrow of Behlrab-bin-Sultan ; whereupon the Benu-Euwahah tendered their allegiance to Belarab-bin-Himyar. Departing thence the latter marched to Balad-Sit, which he invested and captured, after cutting down the date and other trees and damming the water courses. On receiving the submission of its inhabitants he went to Yabrtn and laid siege to the fort, then held for 1 lid'aiab-bin-Himyar was probably cousin to Seif-bin-Sultau.132 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Seif-bin-Sultan by the Benu-Hinah, who eventually evacu ated it and returned to their homes with their arms and munitions of war. Seif-bin-Sultan perceiving that 'Oman was disaffected towards him dispatched messengers to Mekran, who re turned with a large number of Belooches, most of them armed with muskets. Joining to these a considerable body of the Arabs of the coast he ordered them to proceed to el-Jauf—called vulgarly el-Jau. Belarab-bin-Himyar en countered them with his army and utterly routed them. (Their commander on the occasion was Belarab-bin-Sultan, uterine brother to Seif-bin-Sultan.) Many of the Belooches were slain, and the remainder, with few exceptions, died of thirst. When intelligence of this disaster reached Seif-bin-Sultan he wrote to the Persians soliciting their aid against 'Oman. They readily promised to assist him, but in the meantime the Shah dispatched a messenger, in charge of a powerful horse so restive that none of the Persian horsemen could sit it, who was directed to tell Seif-bin-Sultan that if he could maintain his seat on the horse, he, the Shah, would supply him with as many soldiers as he desired; on the other hand, if he failed he was not to expect any assistance from him. (This experiment was doubtless intended by the Shah to test whether Seif-bin-Sultan was a brave equestrian and sovereign.) When the man had delivered his message, Seif-bin-Sultan, who was then at Maskat, looked at the horse's face and saw that it was a difficult animal to ride; but knowing that the Persians had not been able to manage him themselves, and that their object was to try his (SeiPs) pluck, he ordered one of his own horsemen to saddle him, and then set out attended by a large crowd. On reaching the first 'Akabah of the large Wadi of Maskat he directed that nobody should stand on the edge of the Wadi until he had ridden three courses; then, mounting, he struck the horseTHE IMAMS OP OMAN. 133 on the flanks three times with his knees, and the horse flew off with him, he striking it lustily and calling out to the people to keep out of the way; but, in fact, none could stand on the edge of the Wadi owing to the stones which were thrown up by the horse's hoofs. On reaching the Bab-el-Mitha'ib, the horse leaped the wall and Sultan fell on his feet, standing erect on the wall of the gate. The horse, however, having broken its legs and shivered its knees, died immediately. The Shah's messenger as well as his own people were astonished at SeiPs dexterous horse manship ; Seif, on his part, greatly regretted the death of the horse. When the messenger returned with an account of all that had occurred, the Shah wrote Seif a flattering letter and promised to aid him against any and all his opponents in 'Oman. At that time Seif was engaged in hostilities with Belarab-bin-Himyar, in the course of which he had lost every friend who could sustain him under his reverses. ' Ahmed-bin-Said, es Saidy,' said one of his officers to him, ' is the only man worthy of your confidence : he is discreet in judgment and very courageous. God willing, I will in troduce him to you.' It so happened about this time that the Imam had decided to go from Maskat to er-Rastuk; on the way thither, near Riwa, he descried one coming towards him whom he had never seen before, mounted on a splendid she-camel. Some of the party remarked : ' It is Ahmed- bin-Said, es-Saidy, of whom you have heard.' So the Imam and his party alighted from their animals, as did also Ahmed-bin-Said, and he and the Imam shook hands cor dially. Then the latter took Ahmed apart from the rest and said to him : ' Where are you going ?' He replied: ' To your town of el-Matrah on business.' ' Go,' re joined the Imam, ' and when you hear of my return to Maskat from er-Rastak come to me there.' ' i will obey,'' answered Ahmed. Accordingly, when the latter heard of • fill134 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. the Imam Self's return to Maskat he repaired thither to pay his respects to him, and was treated with great considera tion. The Imam then sent him to the country of el-Hasa to transact some business for him, and he acquitted himself so much to his satisfaction that he promoted him from one rank to another, and eventually made him Wali of Sohar and its dependencies. Ahmed carried on the government entrusted to him with justice and equity, and was exceedingly liberal to the inha bitants, by whom he was greatly beloved. The tribes of esh-Shamal and ezh-Zhahirah also came to him, sometimes in crowds and sometimes singly and in couples, and he en tertained them with profuse hospitality. He was urbane to rich and poor, to the learned and ignorant, and his conde scension to all ranks raised him in general estimation. The sheikhs of the el-Jibur, also, from el-Hufry, and el-Harady, and Hai-^Asim paid their respects to him, and he treated them most munificently, so that his renown spread far and wide, all the people obeyed him gladly, and all tongues ex tolled the justice of his administration. When Seif-bin-Sultan heard of these proceedings he said to some of his officers : ' Ahmed-bin-Said acts in this way in order to estrange the people from me and to draw them to himself, his object being to make his what is now mine. Hence, if I do not remove him from Sohar he will eventually deprive me of my rights.—The case is plain to the discern ing.' Thereupon he sent a letter ordering Ahmed to come to him immediately. Ahmed obeyed at once, mounted his camel, and set out accompanied by an attendant named Saad. The Imam Seif-bin-Sultan was at Mdskat at this time, and had ordered the officers of his slaves to seize Ahmed on his arrival and imprison him in the Eastern fort. (The house then occupied by the Imam was that which afterwards belonged to Daiid-bin-Khalil, el-Mardiny.) When Ahmcd-bin-StUd and his attendant reached the village ofthe imams of 'oman. 135 Riwa, they proceeded by the^Akabah of the large Wadi and then turned off till they came to the well of the ez-Ziyadiy- yah, where they halted their camels. Ahmed-bin-Said then took his sword and said to his attendant: ' Remain here with the camels until I return.' Pursuing his journey he approached the house of my grandfather, Razik-bin-Bakhit- bin-Said-bin-Grhassan, whom he met just as he was leaving the house on his way to the Maskat custom-house. (At that time my grandfather was the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan's principal accountant and secretary, and being in his confi dence Seif had apprised him of his feelings towards Ahmed- bin-Said, with whom also my grandfather used to correspond by letter.) After they had shaken hands my grandfather asked Ahmed-bin-Said where he was going. He replied; ' I have received a letter from the Imam- Seif-bin-Sultan directing me to wait upon him immediately ; but 1 don't know what he wants me for.' My grandfather replied ' Return forthwith to Sohar before he or any of his people know of your arrival at Maskat, for his object is to do so and so with you.' On hearing that, Ahmed rejoined: 'Per haps he wishes to remove me from the government of Sohar.' ' Yes, and to kill you besides,' said my grandfather ; ' so I advise you to return to Sohar, for the soul nourishes perdi tion and concocts destruction. I tell you this of the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan; so, farewell.' Thereupon Ahmed returned to the well of ez-Ziyadiyyah, and he and his attendant mounting their camels they traversed the road by the Wadi, and turning off from the head of the ^Akabah they spurred their animals and rode away as swiftly as the wind. It is stated that they reached Sohar at dawn the following day. Then some of the Imam Seif-bin-Sultanas people having informed him that Ahmed-bin-Said had been at Maskat and had returned to Sohar the same day, he summoned the slaves who had been ordered to seize him and questioned them on the subject. ' My lord,' said they, we have not seen him136 the imams of 'oman. and neither were we aware that he had been at Maskat until you told us.' He then directed them to search for him as for a serpent, and they accordingly dispersed themselves in every direction to discover him, but in vain. He then ordered them to be bound and beaten. At length some per sons told him that they had seen Ahmed and my grandfather Kazik conversing together in the Wadi. Thereupon he dispatched camel-men and horsemen after him, but they returned without having found any trace of him. Convinced now that he had effected his escape he sent for my grand father Razik, and said to him: ' What induced you to act in this manner ; for it is through you that Ahmed-bin-Said went away ? Whither did he go after you cautioned him ? what did you tell him and he you when you met ? for it has been proved to me that you saw him and that your warn ings hurried him off. I disclosed to you all that was in my heart respecting him, and you have violated my confidence and disobeyed my orders.' Thereupon my grandfather began to asseverate that he had neither seen Ahmed nor put him on his guard, nor divulged one of the Imam's secrets, nor broken one of his orders, declaring that whoso ever had reported the contrary was a liar, and winding up by saying to the Imam : ' Calm your anger and be like yourself, for your disposition is gentle, not harsh.' The Imam asked again in a rage: 'Is not what I say true ?' He then ordered my grandfather to be bound and imprisoned and kept him in prison three months before he released him. He also wrote another letter to Ahmed-bin-Said or dering him to come to him speedily; but Ahmed declined on various excuses which were fully set forth in his reply. When the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan perceived that Ahmed was on his guard, he sent him a threatening letter in which, among other menaces, he said : If you do not come to us we will come to you.' He accordingly fittt d out four large ships which he filled with men and warlike stores. OnTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. anchoring with those before the fort at Sohar, he sent an order for Ahraed-bin-Said to visit him. When his mes senger had delivered the letter, Ahmed-bin-Said embarked in a small boat to obey the summons. Meanwhile, the Imam had posted his slaves on the sides of the vessel in which he himself was. When Ahmed^s boat approached the ship, some of the slaves beckoned to him to return, which he did, and made for the land ; whereupon the slaves cried out to the Imam : ' Ahmed has gone back to the shore!' 'Keep your places,' rejoined the Imam; 'he has probably forgotten something and has returned to fetch it.' They accordingly retained their posts the whole of that day, from sunrise to sunset, but no Ahmed appeared. The Imam waited there several days writing letters to him, to none of which did Ahmed deign to reply. When the el-Jibur chiefs of el-Harady, el-IIufry and Hai-'Asim—districts of Barkah—heard that the Imam was still with his ships before Sohar, they embarked in boats and went to see him. On meeting him they said : ' 0 Imam, what do you want of your Wali, Ahmed-bin-Said ?' He replied: 'Merely that he should come to me.' They rejoined: ' How can you expect that of him when you have frightened him with your letters and ships ? Such a course is not seemly, for he is your Wali and one of your advisers. Had no one intimidated him he would not have come back to Sohar in consternation the day he went to see you at Mas- kat. And had he not been loyal and true he would not have come off to you in his boat, on which occasion being scared away by some of your attendants he returned to the shore. Crod be praised ! you are of a gentle disposition and know full well that ' the soul shrinks from destruction.' Our sug gestion is that we call upon him, tell him about you, and hear what he has to say in reply. Should we learn that he is alarmed at your having come to him, we trust to return with assurances such as will set your mind at rest respecting 18I' I &lt;/&lt; ■ '''{p.: ■-. ' I I j 1 i * If,#. ♦ 4 II - ^ .'if Hi 'I H f ;l ' ' i 1 ' 188 THE JMAMS OF OMAN. him.' The Imam having agreed to this arrangement, the chiefs proceeded to Ahmed, whom they reproved on behalf of the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan. He replied ; ' I am neither disloyal nor refractory; but you know that the mind shrinks from destruction. If I could reveal what has been told me by others of the designs intended against me, I would do so; but that would be a breach of confidence, and 1 must hold my peace.' After strenuous exertions the el-Jibur effected a reconciliation between the two parties, on condition that Ahmed-bin-Said should make over his son, Hilal-bin-Ah- med-bin-Said to the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan to go with him wherever he went and to stay with him where he stayed, in order that the Imam's mind should be at rest respecting Ahmed-bin-Said. Hilal-bin-Ahmed was his father's eldest son and the most intelligent of all his children. He was brought to the ship and delivered up to the Imam, who behaved very kindly to him, and whose mind was now quieted as regarded Ah- med-bin-Said. He then returned in his ship to Maskat. Hilal-bin-Ahmed had not been long with him before he re ceived letters from the Amirs of the Persian Shfih, apprising him that they had reached Fakkan^vith their forces; where upon he allowed Hilal to return to his father, Ahmed-bin- Said. The Amirs of the Persian Shah arrived at Fakkan with their troops on Wednesday evening, twelve nights be fore the expiration of Dzul-Hijj, a.h . 1149, [10th March, 1737.] From Fakkan they proceeded to es-Sir, 2 whither Seif-bin-Sultan went in his ship to join them. 1 Wellsted's ' Khdrfakan' and the ' Khorefacawn' of Capt.

It is a place of some trade, and has a Kh6r, or boat-harbour, secure from all winds, half a mile deep, with two and three fathoms water in it. It contains about four hundred inha bitants, including fifty Banians. 2 The name of ' es-Sir' does not appear in our recent maps or charts. Niebuhr locates it within the district of es-Sirr,—the littoral on theTHE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. 139 'Oman was greatly terrified at the number of these for- eigners, and one of the notable men of the country addressed the following anonymous letter to Seif-bin-Sultan on the occasion :— cc In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate ! ' e Verily, God will not change what is in a people until they shall change what is in themselves/ ( Surely, as to these things their eyes are not blind, but the hearts are blind which are in their breasts/ 1 ' Abundant compliments with sincere and candid congra tulations to the magnanimous, eminent, and noble Seyyid, the Imam, son of the Imam, of exalted honour, Seif-bin-Sultan, el-Yaaruby. May God preserve him ! Amen. ' Certain current reports which have been confirmed by our comrades of the esh-Shamal have given great pain to the Muslims on all sides, both on your account and their own, in consequence of which their hearts are in dread and their minds distracted. The news is, that certain Persians have reached Fakkan with an army of libertines, whose ima ginations are filled with, grand ideas, and whose minds the devil has fired to foster a craving after what is not theirs, because the profit they made on the goods which they brought to a free market did not satisfy them. By this time a portion of them may have reached some parts of^Oman, for they landed at Fakkan with stores, horses and other animals— a movement the importance and significance of which cannot be exaoreerated.

Farewell.' It is related that while the Imam Seif-bin-Sultan was on the voyage to join the Persians his ships encountered a storm, which obliged him to take refuge at Fakkan, all the other ships returning to Maskat; that on hearing of one of these having been driven close to the shore, Ahmed-bin-Said went out to it with a number of small boats, and seized it from the crew ; and that Seif-bin-Sultan proceeded by land and joined the Persians at es-Sir. Another account, how ever, states that he reached es-Sir with all his ships. AVhen Belarab-bin-Himyar, el-Yaaruby, heard of these proceedings on the part of Seif-bin-Sultan and the Persians, he collected a large force from 'Ortmn and ezh-Zhahirah, and marched against them from Nezwa on the 1st of el- Muharram, a.h . 1149 [1st May, 1736]. The two armies met in ezh-Zhahirah, at a place called es- Sammy, and a great battle was fought between them. (Ano ther account fixes the date of Belarab-bin-Himyar's de parture from Nezwa on the 1st of el-Muhurram, a.h . 1150.) Belarab's force was utterly routed ; those who reached their homes were without animals or arms, the greater part died of thirst, and the probability is that many fell by the hands of their own comrades in their discomfiture and flight. I hereupon Seif-bin-Sultan and his Persians entered Taw- wam of el-Jan, 1 which submitted to him, as did also the whole of ezh-Zhahirah. Then his army entered ^Obra, killed 1 The reader is reminded that el-Tawwam is the modern el-Bereimy, which is here said to be located in ' el-Jan,' the vulgar form of 41 el- Jauf.'

This ' Jan' appears to be distinct from the u el-Jauf' mentioned at p. 33, which I conceive to be a town or oasis. See note, id.]42 the imams of 'oman. many of the inhabitants, plundered all they could lay hands on, and slaughtered the children in a most barbarous man ner; for it is related that the Persians first bound them with ropes and then hurled them from the bridges into the streams, regardless of their cries. Ihey seized man} fioe women also, and carried them to Shiraz, there to be sold as slaves. They then returned to es-Sir, but Seif not being satisfied with their conduct towards himself separated from them and marched with his force to Behla, which place made peace with him, and committing the fort there to Salim-bin-Khamis, el-'Obry, he marched to Timsa. There upon most of the garrison in the fort of Nezwa decamped, and Belarab thought of doing the same, through fear of Seif- bin-Sultan and his army, and because he despaired of re ceiving any reinforcements; but Seif, instead of going to Nezwa, went to Manh, the people of which submitted to him. Next, he descended towards Semiiil and halted at el- 'Add, from whence he summoned the tribes of Semail to his presence. As they were preparing to obey his summons he started for Mdskat and took up his abode there. Dissensions now arose between the Wali whom Seif-bm- ^ Sultan had left at el-Ghabby and the Benu-Ghafir, in conse quence of which the people of Behla [Nezwa ?] admitted Belarab -bin-Himyar into their fort. At this time the Per sians who were at es-Sir received reinforcements from Shiraz, with which they marched to ^Oman, and on reaching ezh-Zhahirah the inhabitants submitted to them. From thence they proceeded to Behm, where they arrived on the 23rd of Dzul -Kaadah—many of the people fleeing on their approach—and seized everything they could find there, in cluding the fort, in which they left a garrison of their own, and then went forward to Nezwa on the 1st of Dzul-Hijj. Belarab -bin-Himyar fled the place, but the Benu-Haras con tinued to hold the fort on his behalf. The inhabitants, how - ever, submitted to the Persians, who, when once establishediinnit. wwi am THE IMAMS OF OMAN. 143 there, imposed the khardj, 1 and inflicted all kinds of tortures upon them, put many persons of both sexes, young and old, to death, carried off such women as pleased them to Shiraz, and perpetrated the most barbarous cruelties, insomuch that ten thousand women and children are said to have been murdered by them, none escaping their hands except such as saved themselves by flight. Nevertheless, not being able to capture the fort, they left Nezwa on the 16th of Dzul-Hijj, and marched to Azka, the inhabitants of which submitted to them and paid them khardj. After remaining there a day or two they proceeded towards el-Batinah, and turned off in the direction of Maskat, which they reached on the 24th of the same month. They invested the town and be came masters of the entire place, with the exception of the Eastern and Western forts. These they besieged until the 5th of Safar, a.h . 1151 [15th May, 1738]. From Maskat they went to Barkah. Before their arrival at Maskat, Seif-bin-Sultan had fled with his ships to Barkah, and after placing the el-Maawal in the forts there, had gone on to el-Jau, the inhabitants of which received him with all respect and accompanied him to Nakhl. From thence he went to ezh-Zhahirah and met Belarab-bin-Himyar in the Wadi of the Benu-Ghafir. The Benu-Ghafir were of opinion that, in order to heal their divi sions and rivalries, and that both might join against the common enemy, the Persians, Belarab-bin-Himyar should surrender the Imamate to Seif-bin-Sultan, which was accord ingly done. Meanwhile hostilities were carried on between the el-Maa wal at Barkah and the Persians, who had marched thither from Maskat; but the latter were unable to take the forts, 1 Khardj means a tax or tribute. In this instance it probably com prised, besides taxes on land and produce, the Jizyah, or tribute, levied in the form of a capitation-tax from a conquered people and from na tive non-Muslims in a country under Muslim rule. No such taxes were levied in 'Oman under the Imams. ■ : - m iillill Ml ^ ' ililll jw *144 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. and remained posted at el-Hufiy, and in the tower of el- Mazra, belonging to Barkah. The Persians stationed at Belila, receiving no news of their comrades who had proceeded to Maskat, dispatched a hundred horsemen to inquire about them. On the 8th of Saiar, the first day of their march through Semail, the in habitants, together with Himyar-bin-Munir and his men who held the fort for Belarab-bin-Himyar, encountered and slew most of them. Thereupon Himyar-bin-Mumr and the soldiers under him of the people of Azka and the Benu- Riyam marched to Behla, which they entered and captured on the 21st of the same month, the Persians retiring into the fort, which was at once besieged by the assailants. During the siege the Persians sallied out to attack the Arabs, but most of them were killed, so that only a few of the garrison remained. These subsequently surrendered to Seif-bin-Sultan, who allowed them to leave with their arms, chattels, and animals, and ordered Mubarak-bin-Said, el- Ghafiry, to escort them to Sohar. Sohar at that time was being invested by their comrades, but at some distance from the fort. The party escorted by Mubarak-bin-Said was attacked by Ahmed-bin-S:iid, who killed most of them and confined the remainder in the fort, where they all died. The Persian forces which had left Maskat and taken up their quarters at Barkah now retired to es-Sir, and a por tion of them returned to their own country. This occurred after Seif-bin-Sultan had set a large army in motion against them by land, and a number of ships to attack them at sea. On reaching the village of Khatt, which is near to es-Sir, he learnt that his ship called el-Malk had been burnt and all the crew drowned, on Friday, fifteen days before the ex piration of Shawal, a.h . 1151 [14th January, 1789]. He then returned to ^Oman, some of the Persians remaining at es-Sir ; the remainder were at Sohar, engaged in besieging the fort.the imams op 'oman. 145 All the garrisons of 'Oman were now in favour of Seif- bin-Sultan, and the people submitted to him, and he relieved them of the hhardj. Then, however, many of the learned sheikhs of Behla, Nezwa, and Azka, also of the chiefs of the Benu-Ghafir, who resided in ezh-Zhahirah, and those of the Wadi-Semail, and the sheikhs of the el-Maawal met together to consult about conferring the Imamate on Sultan-bin- Murshid, el-Yaaruby. Having come to that decision, they gave their allegiance to him in the mosque of Nakhl, in the year a.h . 1151 [ a.d . 1738]. SULTAN-BIN-MUESHID, el-ya'abuby. On Sultan-bin-Murshid's accession, the forts of Nakhl, Se- miiil, Azka, Nezwa, and those belonging to the tribes of esh- Sharkiyyah and the es-Salimiyyah were made over to him, and he himself marched with an army to er-Rastak, which was at that time under the government of Seif-bin-Sultan. W hen the latter heard of his approach he collected a force from er-Rastak and other places, and took up a position in the hollows of the Falj-el-Maisar, in order to give him bat tle ; but finding that he could not maintain discipline among his followers he fled from them by night, leaving a quantity of warlike stores, dates, and other provisions in their pos session. When the Imam Sultan-bin-Murshid reached er-Rastak, on a Friday morning in Shaaban of the same year, he found that Seif-bin-Sultan had decamped. The people of er-Ras- tak received him cordially, and, judging him worthy of the Imamate, they recognized him as their ruler and proffered their allegiance j the fort also surrendered, after holding out seventy days. Seif-bin-Sultan had left in it his slaves, his mother, and other members of his family; he himself had gone to Maskat, from whence, and from el-Matrah and es- 19146 THE IMAMS Ob 1 ^OJIAX. Sib, he collected a force and proceeded to Barkah. There upon the Imam Sultan-bin-Murshid sent an army against him under Seif-bin-Muhenna, el-Yaaruby. The two parties met, and there was a severe engagement between them, but Seif-bin-Sultan's followers were utterly routed, and those only escaped death who asked for quarter, and such as fled into desert places. Seif-bin-Sultan succeeded in reaching Maskat, where, on hearing that a contingent of about five hundred Arabs from ezh-Zhahirah was coming to him, he set out and met them at el-Hazm, accompanied by some of the Arabs of el-Butinah, who had joined him. At el-Hazm serious disputes arose between the different parties compos ing his force, and they fell upon each other. Some were killed on both sides, and those who were left of the Arabs levied from el-Batinah returned to their homes; the re mainder of those of ezh-Zhahirah, however, stayed with him at el-Hazm. His object was to proceed with them to er- Kastak, but, on perceiving his inability to do so, the ezh- Zhahirah Arabs also returned home, and Seif went back to M^skat. The Imam Sultan-bin-Murshid, on the other hand, having made Seif-bin-Muhenna Wali over the fortress of er-Kastak, collected a force from thence, marched by Nakhl, where he made some levies, then went to Badbad 1 and obtained rein forcements from the Wadi-Semail, as also from Azka and its dependencies, and, on the 2nd of Dzul-Hijj of the same year, marched with his army to Maskat, and captured the place, Seif-bin-Sultan taking refuge on board his ship the el-Fdlah, and his followers on board his other vessels. Some of the latter, however, having obtained quarter from the Imam Sultan-bin-Murshid, disembarked, and the Imam then dispatched one of the ships from which Seif s adherents had landed in quest of Seif himself, placing it under the 1 Wellsted's ' Bibdid,' situated between Semail and es-Sib on the coast.the imams of 'oman. 147 command of Babad-bin-Salim; but tlie ship was overtaken by a storm near Fakkan, and Bahad-bin-Salim returned with his ship^s rudder broken. With regard to Seif-bin-Sultan, one statement is that his ship was wrecked near Fakkan; another, that when he disembarked the ship was seized by Ahmed-bin-Said ; and a third, that Seif went in it to es-Sir, and joined the Persians there; but God knows. As regards Seif-bin-Sultan^s subsequent proceedings, one account is that when he reached es-Sir with his ship and joined the Persians there, he complained to them of what had befallen him at the hands of the Imam Sultan-bin-Mur- shid and the people of ^Oman. They replied : a We are sent by the Shah to aid you, therefore command us to go where- ever you please/' He rejoined: '1 think the best plan will be for us to proceed to Sohar and take the fort from Ah med-bin-Said ; and in the event of success I will present it to you in perpetuity.' The Persians were highly delighted with this offer, but said ; 'You are a sincere friend and ally, and have kept your word with us ; nevertheless, we will not deprive you of anything, for we have abundance.' They accordingly went to Sohar and invested it by sea and land, cutting off all supplies from the inhabitants, and reducing them to great straits. They also sent a large force to Mas- kat to take the two forts there from the Imam Sultan-bin- Murshid, in order to make them over to Seif-bin-Sultan. These two forts, and the other fortifications at Maskat, were held at the time for the former by Seif-bin-Muhenna, el-Yaa- ruby; the fort of el-Matrah was similarly held by Seif-bin- Himyar, el-Yaaruby; and the two commanders had agreed to resist the Persians. Accordingly, when the latter reached Sih-el-Harmel, Seif-bin-Himyar, with some of the people of el-Matrah and Maskat, fell upon them and drove them back to Riwa, where they remained the rest of that day. The following day they attacked el-Matrah, and Seii-bin-Himyar met them, but was overpowered by numbers and slain, toge-148 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. ther with all his men, after they had killed many of the 1 er- sian cavalry. (This engagement took place on the hill of Sih-el-Harmel, and the spot where Seif-bin-Himyar and his followers fell and were buried, now called ' Musarra-esh- Shuhada', [the Arena of the Martyrs,] is covered with white pebbles; the other hillocks facing the Beit-el-! alj indicate the graves of the Persians who were slam on the occasion.) The surviving Persians then proceeded to Barkah, where they encamped, and many of their cavalry went to Karyat on fleet horses, killed a number of people there, and took many women and children captive, and sent them to Shnaz. Among these were two children of my grandfather, Ilazik- bin-Bukhayyit, brothers ot my father, Muhammad-bin-llazik. A detachment of them also went to the W' adis of the el- Maawal, as far as Maslamat, which resulted in the loss of a few men on both sides. The Persian force which had killed Seif-bin-Ilimyar on the hill of Sih-el-Harmel having received reinforcements from their comrades, who were encamped at bohar, marched upon Maskat. On their arrival they planted ladders against the Eastern and Western forts, but were twice repulsed by the guns and musketry of the garrisons ; eventually, how ever, they succeeded in capturing them, and the fort of el- Matrah and its other defences likewise. This is the most authentic account. Another is, that the Persians were beaten off twice, and never took either of the forts at Maskat or that of el-Matrah—that they simply attacked them, but were re pulsed, and then returned to Sohar. The latter statement rests on no good authority, whereas I myself heard from contemporary elders, who were well acquainted with what took place in ^Oman at that time, that the Persians did cap ture the above-named forts. The Persians who were encamped at Sohar continued the siege there, and so effectually cut off all supplies from the besieged in the fort and within the walls, that the price ofTHE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. 149 ten Sahnat 1 —vulgarly called el-Kasha' —rose to fifty falsr On the other hand, the Persians who held Maskat furnished their comrades at Sohar with supplies, which they sent by boat. At this juncture also they received reinforcements from Shiraz, and the number of the besiegers, according to the most trustworthy accounts, now amounted to sixty thou sand men. Ahmed-bin-Said sallied out every day with his followers and killed as many of them as he could. As to Seif-bin-Sultan, he began to be estranged from the Persians when he saw that, after taking Maskat and its defences, they had no intention of making them over to him. Causes for repentance crowded upon him from all quarters, and he be gan to despair of the government of ^Oman, or of receiving any effectual aid from the Persians to recover it. He ac cordingly departed from Sohar by stealth, and went to el- Hazm, and on reaching it said to one of his officers : ' This is my castle and my grave. I am become an eyesore to every one, and the quiet of death will be preferable to any happiness which dominion has afforded me. - ' The Persians continued the siege of Sohar for nine months, their land-forces discharging as many as three thousand cannon-shot at the fort and wall every day, the sound of which resembled thunder.

Murshid heard that Maskat and el-Matrah had been occupied by the Persians, and that they were closely besieging Sohar and its fort, he collected a large army from er-Rastak, from ezh-Zhahirah and the Wadi of the Benu-Ghafir, and marched with them from er-Rastak to Sohar; but on reaching el- Khaburah all these levies abandoned him, with the exception of two hundred men, of whom thirty belonged to his own people [the el-Yaarubah], believing that he would return with them. On the contrary, he proceeded slowly with his little band towards Sohar, and on nearing Saham they en countered a Persian troop mounted on swift horses, and there was a conflict between the two parties, which resulted in the rout of the Persians, the Imam pursuing them until they joined their comrades who were besieging the fort. A great battle was now fought, in which the Persian com mander, named Kelb-^Aly, was slain, and also a hundred of his followers. On the Imam's side all the el-Yaarubah fell, and fifty men besides; the remainder were dispersed hither and thither, but he succeeded in making his way into the fort, mortally wounded. He died three days after. The intelligence of Sultan-bin-Murshid's death, and the sad fate of his followers, so affected Seif-bin-Sultan that he only survived him a few days. He was buried in the fort of el-Hazm. Meanwhile, hostilities continued between Ahmed-bin-S^id and the Persians, the former frequently sallying out against the besiegers. When the latter perceived that Ahmed-bin- Said was as obstinate in attack as he was patient under their fire—news having reached them, moreover, of Seif-bin-Sul- tan's death—their courage began to slacken, and their Khan 1 proposed a reconciliation with Ahmed-bin-Said, on condition that they should be allowed to carry away all the guns, arms, 1 This expedition from Persia took place during the reign of Nadir Shah. The Khan in command is generally stated to have been Mirza Taky Khan, the governor of Shiraz.the imams of 'oman. 151 and ammunition which they had brought to their camp at Sohar. Ahmed having agreed to these terms, the Khan, their commander-in-chief, accompanied by ten of his princi pal officers, had an interview with him in the fort, where they were hospitably entertained. During the repast the commander-in-chief said to Ahmed : ' As you have allowed us to carry away all our arms, I trust you will allow our comrades at Mdskat to do the same, and permit them to cross over to Bunder-el- , Abbas in safety/' To this Ahmed replied : 'In shad Allah but nothing more. Two days after, the Khan and his followers embarked on board their vessels and went to Bunder-el-'Abbas, from whence they proceeded to Shiraz. On their departure from Sohar, Ah med marched with two thousand men to Barkah, the fort of which place surrendered to him at discretion. On his return to Sohar, after a few days' stay at Barkah, he wrote to Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, of the Al-Bft-Said, a well-known personage whom he had appointed to act as his Wali there, to set up two pairs of scales at Barkah for weighing such goods as were imported from India and were sold by weight; (he had resorted to a similar device when Seif-bin-Sultan was at Maskat). His orders having been executed, a good market sprung up at Barkah, for vessels went there which had been accustomed heretofore to discharge at Mdskat; trade increased, and people frequented it from 'Oman and ezh-Zhahirah to buy and sell, carrying back such merchan dise as they required. By this means supplies were cut off from the Persian forces at Maskat and el-Matrah, who there upon began to despond, especially after the departure of their comrades from Sohar. Moreover, they had been greatly alarmed on hearing of the death of Seif-bin-Sultan. In consequence of all these untoward events they dispatched a messenger to el-Hazm, requesting that Majid-bin-Sultan, one of the el-Yaarubah and a near relation of the late Seif- 1 If it please God.152 TIIR IMAMS OF OMAN. r &gt; •&gt; L H'x, •v.'i 'j L 'i v&gt;i'i h . 1 '• i M: bin-Sultan, should be sent to them. On his arrival they directed him to proceed to Shiraz with a letter to the Shah, and to return with an answer authorising them to deliver over all the posts which they held to him, promising at the same time that they would bring his services to the favour able notice of his Persian majesty. He accordingly em barked at M£skat for Bunder-el-^Abbas, and went on from thence to Shiraz. On being presented to the Shah he deli vered the letter with which he was entrusted, and after being hospitably entertained there for thirty days the Shah gave him a letter authorizing his people to surrender all the forts and other defences to him. On his way back he landed at Sohar, and informed Ahmed-bin-Said of the whole trans action. According to another account, when Majid-bin-Sultan left Bunder-el-'Abbas it was his intention to go direct to Mas- kat, but his ship having been overtaken by a storm he was obliged to land at Sohar, where, some of Ahmed-bin-Said's adherents recognizing him, they took him into the presence of their master. Thereupon Ahmed began to question him as to the nature of his message from the Persian Shah, and he eventually succeeded in learning all that had taken place, and obtained possession of the Shah's letter ordering his people to surrender the forts which they held to Majid-bin- Sultan. (This I consider to be the more correct version of the transaction.) He then dispatched Khamis-bin-Salim, el-Al-Bu-Saidy, with the letter and four hundred men to Maskat, and directed him to take over the defences of that town, and also of el-Matrah, from the Persians. The latter, thinking that he was acting for Majid-bin-Sultan, delivered up all the posts into his hands, and he garrisoned them with the men he had brought from Sohar. The transfer of the government of the el-Yaarubah to Ahmed-bin-Said took place a.h . 1154 [ a.d . 1741]. When Ahmed-bin-Said read Khamis-bin-Salim/s letter.THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. 153 wherein the latter informed him that he had taken over the defences from the Persians and now held them on his be half, Ahmed went to Barkah and wrote to Khamis-bin-Salim to bring the Persians to that place. On his arrival with them they pitched their tents in the open plain, and great feasts were made for them. What I am now about to relate was told me by my father, Muhammad-bin-Razik, who heard it from his father Razik, and by the sheikh Maaruf-bin- Salim, es-Sayighy, and by the sheikh Khatir-bin-Hamidi el-Beda iy, and by the sheikh Muhsin, the Persian butcher, whose accounts all agree. They state that when the Per sians came from Maskat to Barkah, accompanied by Kha mis-bin-Salim, el-Al-Bu-Saidy—Ahmed-bin-Said being there at the time—they pitched their tents in the plain, and no one could traverse any part of Barkah without seeing caldrons of meat being prepared for the Persians by Ahmed- bin-Said's orders j and no one could pass through the streets or market without seeing sweetmeats being made for them; nor could any one go near a cultivated spot without witness 1 - ing the produce being collected, under the same authority, for the horses of the Persians; and no one went to rest as sured that he could withhold a feds, much less a dirhem, from Ahmed-bin-Said, if he should demand it for the entertaini- ment of his guests. This led to much murmuring among the people, who were unanimous in saying that the Persians rather deserved death at their hands than such profuse hos pitality. The authorities above quoted go on to say that after the Persians had been encamped three days at Barkah &gt; large dishes of meat were forwarded to their tents, and their chief officers were invited to a grand banquet. As many as fifty accordingly entered the fort with Ahmed- bin-Said's messenger. About half an hour afterwards the drum of the fort was sounded, and the crier proclaimed aloud: ' Any one who has a grudge against tbe Persians may now take his revenge.' No sooner were these words 30154 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. uttered, than the cry was repeated on all sides, and the youth of Barkah following the lead of their elders, and of those who were assembled at the place from other districts, fell upon the Persians and put them all to the sword, with the exception of two hundred. These exclaimed ' quarter! quarter!' and on hearing their voices Ahmed-bin-Said ordered the crier to proclaim a suspension of the slaughter. The chiefs who had entered the fort, however, were all put to death. Ahmed-bin-Said then directed the mariners of Barkah, to transport the survivors to Bunder-el-^Abbas, but when they were near Jebel-es-Sawady 1 the seamen set fire to the ships, swam to land themselves, and left the Persians to be drowned. Ahmed-bin-Said then ordered Khamis-bin-Salim to re turn to Maskat, and to take with him all those who used to reside there and at el-Matrah, and who had fled from the Persians to Barkah, (for the residents at Maskat and el- Matrah, and the people of the Wadi-Hatat had all fled from the Persians and taken up their abode at Barkah). On Khamis's arrival at Maskat, the people who had occupied the neighbourhood beyond the wall could not recognize the boundaries of their former dwellings, owing to the damage caused by the stabling of the Persian cavalry, and the quan tity of dung which had accumulated there. This circum stance gave rise to a serious affray between the contending claimants, in which as many as sixty persons were killed. Thereupon Khamis-bin-Salim undertook to mediate between the parties, and apportioned among them the.places in dis pute ; and now Maskat and el-Matrah began to recover from the effects of the Persian occupation. Ahmed-bin-Said then went to er-Rastak and occupied its fortress; then to Semail, which submitted to him without opposition; then to Azka, which received him in like man- • The es-Sawddy (literally, the Black,) are a group of islets about ten miles from Barkah.THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. 155 ner, and lie took possession of its fort; then to Nezwa, which also submitted ; and then to Behla, which recognized him and placed him in possession of its fort. He was also visited by Muhammad-bin-Suleiman-bin-'Adiy, el-Yaaruby, who came to him from Semed-esh-Shan. (This Muhammad was governor there on behalf of Sultan-bin-Murshid, el- Yaaruby, during the lifetime of the latter.) He made over the fort before he was asked to do so, but after Ahmed had taken possession of it he said to him : ' Go to Nakhl, for I have committed its fort to you.' They then entered into a covenant to be true to each other while they lived. Mu hammad-bin-Suleiman accordingly went to Nakhl and took possession of its fort, agreeably with Ahmed-bin-Said's orders. Such were the events which led to the transfer of the government of the el-Yaarubah to the Imam Ahmed-bin- Said, el-Bu-Saidy.15G BOOK THE SECOND.

[a.h. 1154—1236 = a.d. 1741—1820.] The author of this hook, the undeserving Saltl-hin-Raztlc, who prays that God may avert all evil and calamity from him and from the Muslims generally, makes the following de claration :—One of the aged sheikhs informed me that the administration of'Oman having devolved upon Ahmed-hin- Sa'id, and its people having testified their loyalty to 1dm, the chiefs of er-Rastdk, together with all the other chiefs of 'Oman, assembled together and agreed to confer the Imdmate upon Ahu-Hildl, 1 the great, the excellent, the most glorious AHMED-BIN- S A'lD, bin-ahmed-bin-muhammad, es- S a'idy, 2 el- A zdt, el-^ O many ; by religion, an upright ^ibadhy. The following are some of the preternatural events related to me by one of the aged chiefs, a contemporary of Ahmed- 1 That is, the Father of Ilil&amp;l, Ahmed's eldest son. It is considered courteous among the Arabic-speaking people of the East, Christians as well as Muslims, to drop a man's ordinary name on the birth of an heir, and to call him the Father of his firstborn. This is sometimes done, in the case of elderly men, while they are yet childless. In the event of their becoming fathers, they are bound to recognize the courtesy by giving their eldest sons the names which the goodwill of society had conferred upon them by anticipation. 2 Es-Sa'idy, that is, of the tribe of Sa'id, a branch of the el-Azd. The appellative assumes several forms in this narrative :— BH-Sa'id andaumed-bin-sa'id. 157 bin-Said, as having occurred in the lifetime of the latter, before he succeeded to the government of ^Oman and received the homage of its inhabitants :— One day lie went from Adam of 'Oman to el-Ghabby of es-Sirr, known as ezh-Zhahirah, and arrived there on a fes tival day, when, the morning prayers and the khutbah 1 being over, its inhabitants, both Arabs and Hadhr, were engaged in watching a camel-race. While he was reflecting whether he should not run his she-camel with the rest, a woman of the Arabs of ezh-Zhahirah took hold of the reins of his camel, and said : ' 0, Imam of 'Oman, it does not become you to run your she-camel with the camels of these people, for they are your subjects, you being their Imam and the Imam of all 'Oman.' Whereupon Ahmed-bin-Said alighted from his she-camel, and said to her : ' 0, Arab woman, to what Arabs do you belong V She replied : ' To the Benu- Zafit.' He said : 'You seem to be deriding me by telling me that I am the Imam of 'Oman.' She rejoined : ' By Allah ! I am not; for what I have said shall happen to you shortly, despite all opposition.' On asking the woman her name, and where her home was, she replied : ' My name is Mubash-shirah ; my home is Tinaam ; and by birth I am a Zafitiyyah.' So Ahmed forbore coursing his she-camel, but he kept the woman's saying a secret. On his return to Adam from el-Ghabby, he saw in a dream by night the sun risino- from under his shirt-sleeve. This also he told no O one. On another occasion, on the way from Adam to Manh, ho heard a voice saying, ' Welcome, 0 Imam of 'Oman.' He Bd-ScCtdy, the Father of Sa'id or of the Sa'idy; dl-Bti-Sa'id, the Family or House of the Father of Sa'id; el-BA-Said, the Bu-Sa'id. The most common and correct form is Al-Bu-Sa'id. 1 The Khutbah answers to our sermon, and is preached by the Khatth, after the prayers in the mosque, from the mimbar, or pulpit, generally placed a little to the right of the mihrdb, or niche, which indicates the direction of Mekkah.158 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. looked right and left to discover from whence the voice pro ceeded, but could see no one. This circumstance also he kept a profound secret. Again, while travelling on his she-camel from ^Oman to wards the town of Semiiil, night overtook him nearNejd-es- Sahamah, and perceiving some one standing before him in the road, he accosted him with the salutation of peace. The reply was : 'Peace be upon you also, O Imam oPOman.' He alighted to discover who the speaker was, but could see nothing of him. The following are some instances of Ahmed-bin-Said's generous qualities :— On succeeding to the government he treated my grand father, Razik-bin-Bakhit, with unbounded liberality, on ac count of the warning which he had given him. This gener ous Imam was equally liberal to my father, Muhammad- bin-Razik, until the day of his death. He confirmed my grandfather in the office of Clerk of the Customs, the ap pointment which he had held under Seif-bin-Sultan, and on the death of my grandfather he appointed my father in his room. The document which he gave to my father on the occasion was as follows :— ' In the name of God, the pitiful, the merciful ! From Ahmed-bin-Said, Imam of the Muslims, to all my children specially, and to all men in general, to wit: After my de cease ye shall leave Razik-bin-Bakhit and those begotten of him, as I have left him, in charge of the Customs' accounts, and ye shall pay him as I have paid him, accord ing to the agreement entered in the public records. Ye shall also be kind to him as I have been. Whosoever shall contravene what is here written after it has been made known to him shall be adjudged guilty. God is the hearer and the knowing.' This document was dated the 28th of Rabia-el-Awwal, a.h . 1160 [27th April, 1747]. On the demise of my grandfather, Ahmed-bin-Said appointedahmed-bin-sa'id. 159 my father to succeed him in his office. The document re mained in my possession after my father's death until the reign of Sultan, the son of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, when my house took fire, a.h. 1216, [a.d. 1801,] and the box in which it was kept was burnt, together with many articles of furniture. The following is auother instance of this Imam's liber ality :—He instituted inquiries respecting the woman who had congratulated him as Imam before he attained that dignity, and finding that she was dead he recompensed her relatives and made them an adequate allowance for their maintenance during his lifetime. He also rewarded the slaves of Seif-bin-Sultan who had warned him to return to the shore when he went in his boat to visit their master. From that time forward he never saw Seif-bin-Sultan. He also rewarded the el-Jibiir most handsomely, on his accession to the government, for having abandoned Seif- bin-Sultan and sided with him; and he further contracted friendly alliances with them. Before he was confirmed in the government he went to Nezwa, where he was hospitably entertained by the sheikh Salih-bin-Sabahiyyah. On his accession to power he amply rewarded the sheikh by making him chief over the inhabit ants of the Wadi-Nezwa. He bountifully rewarded the woman in whose house he hid himself at Yankal, and which he quitted in safety on her telling him that Belarab -bin-Himyar had left the place. Before he attained to supreme power he went one day from 'Oman to Semiiil, where he had some business to transact. When near the Wadi-Halfain the sun so over powered him that he took shelter under a large tree. On a subsequent occasion, after he had assumed the reins ot government, he started from er-Rastak to go to ISezwa, having with him a large retinue of slaves and freemen.160 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN, mounted on horses and camels. On reaching Halfain he looked right and left for the tree but could not see it. ' Perhaps it is dead,' was his silent remark. Continuing the search, mounted on his she-camel, he discovered that its roots had been dried up by the sun. He then alighted, as did also his attendants, whom he ordered to spread carpets for him near the trunk of the withered tree. To their great astonishment he further directed them to water the animals there, though the heat was excessive. On his arrival at Nezwa, one of the Kadhis who had accompanied him on the journey asked him why he had put up near the roots of the withered tree. He then told them how that once, before his accession to power, he had taken shelter under its branches while it was still green. Thereupon the Kadhi remarked: 'Do you respect that which is devoid of reason and is dead?' 'It does not become the generous,' replied the Imam, ' to forget benefits : he who does so is not generous. The generous should recognize benefits re ceived either from the animate or the inanimate.' ' I think it is a wise precept,' rejoined the Kadhi; ' the generous and noble ought not to forget such recognition.' The following are a few select instances illustrative of Ahmed-bin-Said's justice and integrity :— When in power he made a man of the Benu-Said com mander over the garrison of the fort of er-Rastak. One day the said commander got enraged with a butcher of the place and caused the meat which was on his counter to bo dragged on the ground and then bestrewed with ashes. The reason was this : at first the commander used to make the butcher wait only two days for the price of the meat which he supplied; subsequently, however, he changed that custom and made the butcher wait for his money until the sum amounted to five hundred Mahmudis. Thereupon the butcher refused to supply him any longer and turned away his messengers who came to him for meat. Hence the act above related.ahmed-bin-sa'id. 161 The butcher then went to the sheikh Suleimun-bin-Nasir, esh-Shakasy, who was at that time the popular chief over all the inhabitants of er-Rastak—what angered him angered them and what pleased him pleased them—and complained of the outrage. The sheikh asked : ' how much does he owe you V ' Five hundred Mahmudis,' was the reply. ' Go home,' said the othei', ' and carry on your trade as usual, and if the Amir's messengers apply to you do not turn them away, and keep the matter secret.' He accord ingly went and acted as the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Nasir had enjoined. Now, it was usual when this sheikh repaired to the Mdsjid of the el-Biyadhah 1 for the Friday prayer that the people of er-Eastak used to follow him thither. But when Friday came round, the sheikh abstained from going to prayer and the people did the same; consequently, when the appointed hour arrived, and the Imam Ahmed-bin- Said had entered the Mdsjid, he found no one present but his soldiers. On inquiring of them what had become of the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Nasir and the people of er-Rastak, they replied that none of them had come to the Mdsjid that day. After the Imam and his soldiers and the market- people had said their prayers, he ordered camels and horses to be made ready and proceeded on a visit to the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Nasir. After shaking hands with him, the Imam took the sheikh apart from the company, and when both were seated said to him : ' You disappointed the people, O sheikh, by your absence and that of your follow ing from the prayers. What was the cause? let me know.' The sheikh then told him of the treatment which the butcher had received from the Amir of the garrison in the fort. ' Have you any other complaints to make V re- 1 The Mdsjid, or place of worship, in this instance was within the for tress of er-Rastak. Most of the principal forts throughout the country- appear to have had prayer-rooms in them set apart for the religious use of the garrison.162 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. marked the Imam. ' None/ , replied the sheikh; ' but this is a serious matter; for what excuse have you for thus neglecting your subjects ? Is it befitting that we should pray behind an Imam who disregards the just claims of his subjects, so that they are left to be injured and oppressed, and, in this instance, the injurer and oppressor is no other than the Amir of your garrison in the fort.' ' This is the first time I have heard anything of the affair,' said the Imam. To which the other replied : ' If you were diligent in superintending the interests of your subjects such things would not happen.' ' Don^t be uneasy on that score,' re joined the Imam ; for, God willing, you will hear by to morrow what will satisfy you.' Thereupon the two separated, the Imam and his retinue returning to the fort and the sheikh to his house. The following day the Imam sent for the Amir and was very wroth with him, demanding to know what he had done to the butcher; whereat the culprits tongue faltered, and he was near dying from sheer fright. The Imam then ordered him to be bound and beaten, and, further, to pay the butcher what was due to him. The Amir accordingly sent to his relations for the amount; and when the money reached, the Imam sent for the butcher and inquired of him how much the man who had damaged his meat owed him. On hearing that he owed him five hundred Mahmudis, the money was paid, and the butcher expressed his gratitude to the Imam, praising him for his goodness. He then went to the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Nasir, told him all that had occurred, and gave him the money, which the sheikh had lent him when he first went to him to complain of the Amir. On the following Friday the sheikh attended the Imam at prayers, the people of er-Rastak accompanying him as usual. After prayers the sheikh told the Imam that he was satisfied with the punishment which had been inflicted on the Amir, and begged him to release him from his bonds.ahmed-bin-sa'id. 163 and to remit the sentence of imprisonment. This the Imam refused, declaring that the culprit should be kept in prison for a whole year. At the expiration of that period the Imam re leased him, and degraded him from his rank of Amir. The man continued to reside at er-Rastak in a very forlorn con dition. Several persons have attested the authenticity of the foregoing narrative. I subjoin the following as another instance of this Imam's kindly disposition :—Whenever he went from er-Rastak to Maskat he ordered a large quantity of sweetmeats to be prepared, which were packed in parcels and laden on camels. On reaching Naj'iman-Barkah, the children of the poor from Hai-'Asim to el-Hufry used to come to him, and he distri buted a parcel to each. When they were leaving he used to say : Now go away, and the blessing of God rest upon you;' which, of course, led them to extol his bounty. Dur ing his two days' stay at Naaman, the people from es-Sib to el-Masnaah were in the habit of coming to pay their respects to him. He always received them most courteously, asked what he could do for them, and whether any one op pressed them. Travelling on towards Maskat, he generally spent a night at Iliwa, and in going from thence to el-Mat- rah the poor and needy of his subjects used to come to him from the extremity of Sih-el-Harmel to the commencement of the mountains of el-Matrah. On these occasions he ordered his soldiers to march slowly, so that the people might have the opportunity of saluting him and he of returning their salutations. At el-Mdtrah he occupied the Beit-ed- Dakkah, and the first to pay their respects to him were the heads of the principal people there, namely, the Benu-IIasan, then followed the Luwatiyah/.then the Benu-Zarraf. After 1 Called also LUtiydn. They are the same as the Khojas or Khwajas of Persia and Sind. There is a large population of this sect at Maskat and the adjacent places on the coast, many of whom have been settled there for centuries, and have become naturalized; others are under1G4 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. all the people of el-Matrali had paid their respects to him, he proceeded to Maskat in boats and canoes prepared for the occasion. When he reached the Island 1 at Maskat, guns were fired from the two batteries, the forts, and the shipping, and the people resorted to the Island in crowds to salute him and to receive his salutations. He would then ask them if they had any requests to prefer; if they had, their request was generally granted. Two days after he used to send for his agents and the two Walis, Khamis-bin-Salim and Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, and inquired whether the revenue for the past year was under or above the expendi ture ; whereupon they submitted the accounts to him. In fine, this Imam had a large heart, was very liberal, very humble towards God, and extremely condescending to the poor and needy, ever ready to listen to what they had to say. [Then follows a long reply to some writer who appears to have questioned the author's opinion respecting the noble qualities of the Imam, as exhibited in his gifts of sweetmeats to the people. The author maintains his point by quotations from the traditions relating to the life of Muhammad and his immediate successors, and also by the policy pursued by British protection, as having been formerly subjects of the Amirs of Sind. Captain Burton, writing of the Khwajas of Sind, says ; ' Their own account of their origin, etc., is that they originally emigrated from Persia ; and it is almost certain that they fled from their native country when the Ismaeliyeh heresy (to which they still cleave) was so severely treated by Halaku Khan. They differ from the Ismaeliyehs in one es sential point, viz., whereas that people only believe in seven Imaums, the Khwajas continue the line up to the present day. They are there fore heterodox Sheeas, as they reject Omar, Abubekr and Osman, and reverence Ali, Hasan, Hasein, Zainul-Abidin, Mahomed-i-Bakr, and Imaum Giafari Sadik. The Khwajas, male and female, all wear white, red, and coloured clothes, avoiding dark blue, the usual hue of the country. They have their own Mukhee at Kurachee, and never go to the Moslem Kazees to settle their religious differences.'

He made Khalfan-bin- Muhammad-bin-^Abdallah, of the Al-Bu-Saidy, Wali over Maskat, charged with the duty of collecting the ' Ushur, and the legal Khardj, and the Sadakdt, 1 and he also commissioned him to receive the cash from the Wakils [Agents] whom he appointed over the Customs. He placed Hasan-es-Serhanj in charge of the government shipping, and made the learned sheikhs Muhammad-bin-'Amir-bin-'Arik, el-'Adwany, who resided at Hallet-el-Muttala, of Afy, which is the most im portant place belonging to the el-Maawal, Kadhi at Maskat, to adjudge in suits arising among the people. My grand father, Razik-bin-Bakhit-bin-Said-bin-Ghassan,he appointed to the customs, as keeper of the accounts. The rules which he drew up for the administration were arranged in admir able order, and adopted after consummate care. He pur chased one thousand Zanj and one hundred Nubian slaves, and took them to reside with him in the fortress of er-Ras- tak; to these he added one thousand free soldiers, providing each with a fine camel or horse, to accompany him whenever he travelled through 'Oman. When he marched from one place to another, four banners attached to staffs, the heads of two of which were of gold and the other two of silver, were borne in his retinue, and he never moved about 1 ' Ushdr means Tithes, but what is intended thereby in this instance I do not know ; and I am equally at a loss to understand what is meant by the 'legal Khardj' or Tax, as the revenue of Miiskat arises solely from the customs-dues, no other tax, either on houses, persons, or pro perty, being levied there at present. For the import of Sadakut, see note 2, p. 31.THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. without being accompanied by a number of Kadhis, scho lars, and notables, and a party of executioners, a brave set of fellows. Several persons who witnessed those glorious times have informed me that when Ahmed-bin-Said visited Maskat he generally spent twelve days there. On the eleventh he used to go to the Western fort to examine the arms, water and food; and from thence to the Eastern fort, passing by the custom-house. When he approached its eastern entrance a crier proclaimed : ' O ye merchants, no duties will be levied on any of the goods which you have deposited in the custom house to-day'; for it was his practice on that day to remit all duties on goods, which sometimes amounted to lacs, to say nothing of hundreds. This was done, my father assured me, up to the date of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said's death. My father also informed me that the revenue from the cus toms at Maskat during the lifetime of this Imam was from three to five lacs in excess of all the expenditure. On inquir ing of him respecting the Imam Ahmed's military forces, he told me that their number was very great, scarcely to be counted. He said the same of the soldiers which the Imam maintained at er-Rastak and at Sohar. His dominions ex tended from the end of Jaalan as far as Tawwam [el-Berei- my]. Many 'Omany and other poets wrote eulogies of him, all of whom he amply rewarded. The most renowned poet of his day—who was also the most celebrated of the poets of 'Oman—was the eloquent sheikh Eashid-bin-Said-bin- Balhdsan, el-'Absy, el-Aflma, edh-Dharar, who wrote many poetical eulogies of Ahmed. As soon as Ahmed-bin-Said had assumed the government of 'Oman, the Nizariyyah commenced disparaging his dig nity, authority and position; and the heads of the el-Yaakib wont to Belarab-bin-Himyar, 1 el-Yaaruby, who was then residing at el-Bazily of ezh-Zhahirah, and said to him : 1 See pp. lol, 143.ahmed-bin-sa'id. 167 'Why have you resigned this matter [the Imamate] to others, which of right belongs to you. You fought for it against Seif-bin-Sultan, el-Yaaruby, and also against the Imam Sultan-bin-Murshid, el-Yaaruby, who were your near rela tives : you did not sheath your sword from them, and your name was dreaded by the people of ^Oman, and they sub mitted to you ? How is it that you are so submissive after such exaltation ?'—to which they added many more words to the same effect. He replied : By Allah ! nothing but want of means has withheld me from coming forward in that behalf.' Thereupon they promised to provide him with men and money to support his claims, on condition that he prose cuted them. He asked for a few days^ delay before giving a decided answer, but he continued to hesitate, notwith standing their urgent solicitations, until a fierce war broke out between the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said and the people of es-Sir, at el-Bithnah. The latter had mustered a large force with which they intended to invade Sohar; these the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said encountered at el-Bithnah, and a great many were slain on both sides, whereupon the people of es-Sir returned home, and the Imam's soldiers retired to Sohar, but the Imam rode onward till he reached the out skirts of Y^nkal, where he alighted to walk, leading his she- camel. Noticing an old woman in advance of him, he stopped her and inquired to what Arabs she belonged. She replied, ' To those of Yankal; all my relations are dead, and I am reduced to great poverty, insomuch that I live apart from the people, and I am ashamed to beg.' 'Have you a house?' he asked. 'She answered, 'Yes; but it is a very wretched one.' He replied, ' Hide me in it, and let no one know; I am Ahmed-bin-Said.' He then gave her money and concealed himself in her house, taking nothing with him but his arms and his money from the saddle-bags, and letting the she-camel go loose with all its equipage. (Ahmed's object was to find out whether thereTHE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. were any left among the people of ^Oman who cherished designs on the Imamate, and whether any of the notables were disposed to surrender their fortified posts to some rival of his.) AV hen the people saw the camel, they recog nized it as the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said's; also the carpet which covered the saddle; whereupon the chief of Yankal took the camel to Sohar and informed the garrison how it had been found. The latter, who knew nothing of the stratagem, returned with it and its trappings to Yankal, and a rumour then got abroad that the Imam Ahmed-bin- Said had been murdered, which caused great commotion throughout 'Oman. The treachery of his enemies now ripened into overt acts, for the heads of the el-Yaakib, and of the Benu-Ghafir, and the Benu-Naim and Kutb went to Belarab-bin-Himyar, el-Yaaruby, and said to him, ' Seize the present opportunity, for the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said has been killed at el-Bithnah. Rise up, therefore, in behalf of this matter which we proposed to you, and we will aid you with men and money.' Thereupon Be'larab, yielding to their solicitations, laid claim to the Imamate. He accordingly assembled a large army, said to have numbered twenty thousand men, and dispatched mounted messengers to all the Nizariyyah and their allies in ^Omam, while he himself marched with the main body of his forces and encamped at Fark, of Nezwa, from whence he wrote to the Nizariyyah of Semail to invest and besiege the fort there. Ahmed, who was still concealed in the old woman's house, had directed her to bring him all the news she heard. One day she came and informed him that the people of Yankal reported that Belarab-bin-Himyar had laid claim to the Fmamate, that all the Nizariyyah had joined him, and that he had gone with his forces to ^Oman and encamped with them at Fark, of Nezwa. On hearing that, the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said set out on foot for Sohar, the fort of which he reached during the night, and wrote from thence toahmed-bin-sa'id. 169 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad, el-Al-Bu-Saidy, who was then his Wali at Semed-esh-Shan, ordering him to collect all the Hinawiyyah of esh-Sharkiyyah and Jaalan^ and also their Bedawin, and to march with them to Fark, mentioning the time that they were to arrive there. He was then joined by auxiliaries from Yunkal and from the ezh-Zhawahir, and marched with them towards the Wadi-Semail, levying a great number of the Arabs of el-Batinah by the way. On reach ing the borders of Badbad he found that the es-Sey- yabiyyin and their confederates had seized the road, and were in ambush for him among the hillocks. These he dis persed, killing a great many, and then went on to Madhmar, of Semiiil, where he also found a body of the Nizariyyah similarly awaiting him, and disposed of them in like manner. On entering the AVadi of the Benu-Ruwahah he obtained levies from that tribe, and took them on with him towards Fark. On the way he was met by ^Adallah-bin-Muhammad, el-Al-Bu-Saidy, his Wali at Seraed-esh-Shan, with a force which God alone could number, and proceeding onward he met Belarab, who was encamped at Fark. Thereupon a great battle was fought between them which resulted in the flight of Belarab's soldiers, and the death of Belarab himself and the heads of the el-Yaakib; in fact, only a few of Belarab's forces escaped. Thus God aided the Imam Ahmed to victory and triumph, so that there did not remain in 'Oman a single enemy to oppose him. At first he punished those who had joined Belarab against him, but he afterwards forgave them. In the year a. h . 11/0 [ a. d . 1756] the Persians invested el-Basrah and besieged jt closely, driving away the inhabi tants, many of whom fled as far as Baghdad. r J he Persians had also suspended an iron chain across the river. I here upon the refugees wrote privately to the Imam Ahmed-bin- Said soliciting his assistance. He accordingly prepared ten large ships belonging to the government, and a number of 22170 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. smaller vessels, and dispatched ten thousand men in them against the Persians. When they reached the river of el- Bdsrah and saw the iron chain suspended across it, they forced the ship called er-Rahmdny against it and broke it. Then the Arabs, sword in hand, fell on the Persians and routed them, driving them out of el-B£srah, which the in habitants reoccupied, the Imam returning to Mdskat with his ships. When the King of the Eflm 1 heard of these proceedings he was highly pleased with the Imam for having sided with his subjects of el-Bdsrah against the Persians, and he directed his governor at that place to pay a khardj 2 to the Imam, which was continued during the reign of his son the Seyyid Sultan, and also during that of his grandson Said-bin- Sultan-bin-el-Imam. y Then certain Coolies took to plunder on the sea leading to Mangalore, which place at that time belonged to Tippoo, the Malik of the Nawwab. In consequence of these piracies Maskat was deprived of rice, and the Imam Ahmed-bin- Said sent one of the notables of the el-Harth in his ship the er-Rahmdny to Mangalore. On his arrival there the people of the place were highly delighted, and the resident gover nor, on behalf of the Sultan, the Nawwab, received him with great honour. (Delhi in India was at that time the capital of the Nawwab, Tippoo's Sultan.) The el-Harthy having asked the governor of the town why supplies of rice had not reached ^Oman as usual, the governor informed him of the Coolies , proceedings on the sea. Thereupon the el-Harthy, having asked for a guide to the Coolies' retreat, proceeded thither with his followers, and when the two parties met there was a great fight between them in which the Amir of the Coolies was slain. Thereby the way was reopened for rice to be sent from the place where it was produced to Man- 1 That is, the Ottoman Sultan at Constantinople. 2 Khardj here probably means a subsidy.ahmed-bin-sa'id. 171 galore; and the govemment and the people of Mangalore gave the el-Harthy many presents, and loaded his ship with rice and other articles for the Imam, besides giving him some very valuable presents for himself. 1 When intelligence of these events reached the Nawwab^s Malik, he sent a messenger to the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said with many gifts. On his arrival at Maskat he proceeded ^ to er-Rastak, where he and his suite were honourably en- ^ tertained by the Imam. The messenger of the NawwaVs Malik then requested that a spot should be allotted to him within the walls of Mdskat whereon to erect a house for his master. Permission to that effect having been granted, he built the house known as the Nawwab's, within the town; and he further entered into a covenant with the Imam, on behalf of his Sultan, to aid the Imam with men and money against his enemies. ^ 1 As the ImS,m Ahmed died a.d . 1774 and Tippoo did not succeed his father Ilaidar 'Aly till 1778, the latter must have been on the throne of the Carnatic at the time. It is possible, however, that he may have been absent at this period, and that his son was acting for him at Man- galore. The cotemporary Moghul Emperor, whom our author styles 'the Sultan, the Nawwab,' was Shah 'Alam, who in 1771 left the pro tection afforded him by the British at Allahabad and re-entered his capital at Delhi. It is not easy to ascertain what particular pirates are alluded to in the narrative, but it is well known that powerful bands of them, composed of different castes, held several fortified positions on the coast to the northward of Mangalore. During Hamilton's time, a.d . 1088-1723, they appear to have confined their depredations to the north, ' finding their richest prizes among the Mocha and Persia traders. Niebuhr, in 1764, mentions the ' Malvanes [Malays V] Sangerians [Angrians •■'] and the Kulis, petty peoples inhabiting the coast, as being greatly addicted to plundering on the sea. Soowurndrooj, a fort on a small island seventy- eight miles south of Bombay, then held by the famous pirate I ulaji, successor to the still more famous Kanhojee Angria, who had acquired immense wealth in the same pursuit, Avas destroyed by a British licet under Commodore James in 1755. It was then transferred to the Mahratta government, and devolved finally to the East India Company on the overthrow of the Peishwa in 1818.172 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. The following is the account given me by the sheikh Maaruf-bin-Salira, es-Sayighy, en-Nakhly, by the sheikh Khatir-bin-Hamid, el-Beda'iy, en-Nakhly, and by others who lived in those days, of the cause of the war which then arose between the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said and Muhammad- bin-Suleiman-bin-Muhammad-bin-'Adiy, el-Yajlruby, the Wali of Nakhl, after their mutual covenant to be faithful to each other. 1 It appears that Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el- Yaaruby, made Seif-bin-Sultan, el-Yaaruby, the Sahib of el- 'Akr and one of the family of Murshid, his deputy whenever he went on business from Nakhl to the Wadi of the Benu- Kharus or to the mountains of the Benu-Riyam. Now it so happened that Seif and Sultan, the two sons of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, were disaffected towards their fathers government, endeavouring to seduce his subjects from their allegiance, and intent on seizing the fort of Barkah from him. While staying in the fort of Nuaman-Barkah they sent to Seif-bin-Sultan, el-Yaaruby, Muhammad-bin-Sulei man, el-Yaaruby^s deputy, (Muhammad being at that time in the Wadi of the Benu-Kharus), directing him to send one hundred of the men of Nakhl to them. He acceded to their request without consulting Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, and dispatched the men under the command of Khanjar-bin- Mas^ud, the Sahib of el-'Atik. When they joined the Imam's sons, the latter effected an entrance into the fort of Barkah by night and captured it, putting the Wali and the garrison placed there by their father Ahmed to the sword. The Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, who was then at er-Rastak, on hearing what had occurred marched to Barkah with a large force, first invested the fort, and then cannonaded it, reducing it to a mound, which, however, his two sons and their adherents continued to defend bravely, and none dared to approach them owing to the continuous fusillade which they kept up. Thereupon the Kadhis of er-Rastak inter- ' See p. 155.ahmeu-bin-sa'id. . 173 vened to effect a reconciliation between the Imam and his two sons Seif and Sultan, which was agreed to, on condition that the latter evacuated the battered fort, together with their companions. They accordingly came forth, the sons joining their father, who, at their solicitation, forgave them, and the men of Nakhl proceeding to their homes. Then the Imam made hostile preparations against Muham mad-bin-Suleiman, believing that the latter had violated the treaty which existed between them by assisting his sons Seif and Sultan with men to enable them to seize the fort. Such, however, was not the case : Muhammad-bin-Suleiman was not a consenting party in that transaction, neither was he present at Nakhl when his deputy, Seif-bin-Sultan, dispatched the men to the Imam's sons; on the contrary, when he heard that the men had been sent he returned forthwith to Nakhl, and was extremely angry with Seif-bin- Sultan ; but he was afraid to go to Barkah to excuse himself to the Imam while the latter was engaged in hostilities with his two sons. However, on the Imam's return to er-llastak, he wrote him a letter explaining how the case stood; but the Imam would not accept his apologies. Then the Imam dispatched parties to Sind, who returned bringing with them a number of the Zidgal. 1 He also raised levies from er-Rastak and all the other parts of'Oman, until he amassed a large army, with which he proceeded to Nakhl, and commenced cannonading the fort with guns and mortars. The Zidgals were posted in the Beit-esh-Sharihah, belonging to the Benu-'Azzan, and the camp of the remainder ot the 1 Niebuhr gives the following account of this sect, which he stylos DsjedsjAl: —' 1 was informed at Maskat that a famous ecclesiastic of Mekran having assured his people that God would perform a great miracle if they cut down all the trees of a certain district, appointed a day for special prayer, after which the trees were felled, and in one ot them was found a respectable old man, with a book in his hand, ho became the founder of the sect. Such are the tales told on inquiring ot one sect respecting the origin of another.' Description de I Arabic^ p. 1. ■174 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. force was towards Hasanain [or Hadhain] . Now, the slieikli 'Abdallah-bin-Salih, er-Ruwaliy, and the sheikhs of the el- Maawal were opposed to this attack on Nakhl, being con vinced that Muhammad-bin-Suleiman had done nothing to justify it; consequently, after the siege had been maintained for some time the sheikh ^Abdallah returned to his district, taking his men of the Benu-Ruwahah with him. The sheikhs of the el-Maawal also returned home with their respective followings, without asking the permission of the Imam, who was then at er-Rastak ; so that none of his army remained at Nakhl but the Zidgals and the contingent from er- Rastak. These began to cut down the date and other trees until they left scarcely any remaining. Then Muhammad- bin-Himyar, el-Yaaruby, went to ezh-Zhahirah to ask the Nizariyyah on the part of Muhammad-bin-Suleiman to come to the assistance of Nakhl; but they showed cowardice and were not inclined to accede to the request. He then went on the same errand to the Benu-Naim Arabs, whose sheikh at the time was Shamis-bin-Muhammad-bin-Bayat, esh- Shamisy, who gave his consent, and accompanied Muham- mad-bin-Himyar with a thousand men of the Benu-Naim and Kutb. On reaching Yabrin each of these carried a couple of bags filled with straw on his camel. When they entered the Wadi of the Benu-Ruwahah, the latter thoufjlit ^ O they were laden with dates which they intended taking to Mdskat for sale ; but no sooner had they left the Wadi than they cast the straw away, and, spurring their camels, entered el-Matrah after sunset, taking the inhabitants by surprise, plundered the market and dwellings, and then retired with much booty towards their homes. At Safra-'l-Ijal, on the ascent to Nakhl, the el-Maawal came out against them, but were repulsed ; and on entering Nakhl they were surprised to find that all the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said's forces had left it. The cause of the departure of the Zidgals and the men ol er-Rastak, who together had formed the Imam^s armyahmed-bin-sa'id. 175 there, was as follows :—When, as we have already narrated, the sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Salih, er-Ruwahy, had retired with his followers, as also the sheikhs of the el-Maawal and their men, none remaining before Nakhl but the Zidgals and some of the people of er-Rastak, who continued to do much mis chief to the country by cutting down the date and other trees, a number of men from the Wadi of the Benu-Ghafir and also from the people of el-Hazm came to the assistance of Muhammad-bin-Suleiman. Thus timely reinforced, the latter attacked the er-Rastak contingent and their allies the Zidgals, who, on being surrounded by the assailants, asked for quarter, which was gi'anted them, the conditions being that they should evacuate the Beit-esh-Sharihah and the towers, taking their arms with them. These terms being accepted they departed from Nakhl. As to Shamis-bin-Muhammad, en-Naimy, when he left Nakhl he went to the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said at er-Rastak, and begged pardon for his raid upon el-Matrah. Out ot compassion for the people of 'Oman and the critical state of the country, agitated as it was by contentions, as also in consideration of the insecurity of the roads, which otherwise might be occupied by marauding Arabs to the injury of those who traversed them in search of profit; and, further, in order to arrest the shedding of blood by those lawless people—upon these and such like considerations the Imam was induced to pardon him. At this period the Imam, hearing of the revolt of the el- Yaarubah of el-Hazm, whose chief at that time in succession to Zuhran-bin-Seif was his brother Malik-bin-Seif, he mus tered a force from er-Rastak and elsewhere with which he surrounded their fort, and then opened fire upon it with his guns, but the shot did no damage, owing to the hardness of the stones and mortar of the building. Ihe besiegers perceiving this were seized with disgust, and despairing of success many of them left without the permission of the176 the imams op 'oman. Imam, who was still at er-Rastak. When that circumstance became known to Malik-bin-Seif he went to the Benu-Naim, and begged Shamis-bin-Muhammad, en-Naimy, to help him against the besiegers. Shamis consented, taking with him a larsre number of the Benu-Naim and Kutb, and on reach- D ' ing el-Hazm they fell upon the Imam^s investing army and put them to flight. Whereupon those of er-Rastak returned thither, and the remainder went in parties to their respective homes. Subsequently, a reconciliation was effected between the Imam and the people of el-Hazm, each agreeing to abstain from molesting the other. The sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Salih, er-Ruwahy, also repaired to the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said to get him to overlook his having abandoned the war at Nakhl and returned home without the Imam^s permission; but the latter ordered him to be bound and imprisoned in the Eastern fort. After he had been confined there a long time he bribed the garrison to release him of his bonds and allow him to escape; but they made out that he had got away without their knowledge. O d reaching his home he forbore, through foar, to seek an interview with the Imam. However, some time after, while the Imam was at Azka, on the way towards ^Oman, the sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Salih, with several com panions, went out to meet him and solicited his pardon. The Kadhis and chiefs who were with the Imam having pleaded for him, the Imam consented to pardon him. This account respecting the sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Salih I have given in brief, through fear of prolixity. Then Seif and Sultan, the Imam Ahmed^s sons, went to Maskat without their fathers permission, and with the assistance of the sheikh Jabr-bin-Muhammad, el-Jabry, and a few men, Seif took possession of the Eastern, and Sultan of the Western fort, expelling the garrisons. A number of merchants and notables of the place paid their respects to the two brothers. When their father heard of these pro-atimed-bin-sa'id. 177 ceedings he marched to Maskat against them with a large force. On arriving there he determined to open fire upon them, but the Kadhis of er-Rastak having intervened a reconciliation was effected, on condition that the sons apologized to their father and promised to obey him in future, and that Seif should accompany his father wherever he went; the forts, however, were to remain in the hands of the two sons. A year afterwards the Imam went to Nezwa, taking his son Seif with him; but on leaving that place, and while at Badbad, he bound him and conveyed him to Maskat. The Imam had determined to attack the two forts, but the notables of er-Rastak and some of the Maskat merchants having intervened it was arranged that the Western fort should be surrendered to the father, and that his two sons should retain the Eastern fort conjointly; further, that the Imam should release his son from his bonds, and that the son should not be obliged to go about with his father against his own wishes. A reconciliation having been made on these terms, the Imam took possession of the Western fort, the Eastern remaining in the keeping of his sons. Thereupon the former returned to er-Rastak, and the latter to Nuaman- Barkah, 1 where they mostly resided. A year subsequent to this reconciliation between the Imam and his sons, their brother Said went to Habra, where he possessed many date-trees. His brothers Seit and Sultan, on hearing thereof, went to him trom Nuaman, and remained with him a couple of days. AVhen they were about to return they invited him to accompany them to a feast, but when they reached Nuaman they bound him and conveyed him in a boat to Maskat, and then fortified them selves in the Eastern fort. W hen the Imam heard of these proceedings he levied a large force from er-Rastak and 1 Incorrectly printed Na'umun-Barkah several times in the preceding pages. 33 \178 TFIK IMAMS OP 'OMAN. other places and marched to Maskat, where he took up his residence on the Island, and wrote to his two sons to liberate their brother Said, On their refusal he directed the soldiers in the Western fort to open fire upon the Eastern fort; he also erected a stockade against it, and ordered the ships to cannonade it on the east. The firing was kept up both by- sea and land, and was returned at all points by the Eastern fort; but, notwithstanding the fierceness of the conflict, Seif and Sultan managed to receive supplies from Taiwa and Sur, boats from those places bringing them dates, sheep and fruits. Owing to the duration of the war, and in dread of the shots from the guns, most of the Maskat people fled to Yety [?] and Karyat, and other places. The guns having demolished the western face of the Eastern fort, some of the Imam^s people attempted to storm it, but on reaching the first step leading to the fort they were driven back by a fusillade from the garrison, and several of them were killed. Then sheikh Jabr-bin-Muhammad, el-Jabry, went to es-Sir and collected a great many men from Julfar, whose Amir was the sheikh Sakar-bin-Eahmah, el-Hawaly, and pro ceeding with them to er-Rastak surrounded that place, to the great consternation of its inhabitants. Now the Imam Ahmed-bin-Siiid had as a servant one of the people of Manh. This man was in the Eastern fort with Seif and Sultan, who had entrusted him to watch over their brother Said. One dark cloudy night he went to Sj'iid and asked him whether he would like to be restored to his father. On receiving an affirmative reply, he tied a rope to one of the guns in the fort, and, taking Said on his back, descended. When they were within four ells of the ground the rope broke and they both fell. The Manh man then took Said to his father, who resided on the Island, and knocking at the gate told the doorkeeper that he had brought Said, the Imam's son. The doorkeeper thereupon went to the Imam's room, and knocking with the ring of theahmed-bin-sa'id. 179 door communicated the glad tidings. The Imam came out hastily and met them both, and his son Said having informed him of all that the Manh man had done in his behalf, the Imam thanked the latter and invested him with a cloak. When morning came, Seif and Sultan missed their brother, and seeing the rope tied to the gun they inferred that the Manh man had escaped with him to his father; nevertheless, this occurrence did not lessen their determination to per severe, and the war was carried on more briskly than ever. Eventually, their father offered them an amnesty, on condition that they evacuated the fort; that, however, they continued to refuse, until some one informed them that Ibn-Rahmah, el-Hawaly, had invested er-Rastak with 30,000 men, and had been joined by the Arabs of esh-Shamal and those of Tawwam in great numbers. Fearing that this combination might deprive them of the government and place it in tho hands of their enemies, they decided on a reconciliation with their father, and sent word to him to that effect. His consent having been given, they left the fort with their followers, and had an interview with their father on the Island. The latter invested them with robes of honour, and behaved kindly to those who had been in the fort with them. When Ibn-Rahmah heard of the reconciliation between the Imam and his sons Seif and Sultan, and that they were being entertained by him, he retired with his forces. There upon the Imam returned to er-Ilastak, and Seif and Sultan went to Nuaman. A trustworthy person, whose narratives are universally believed owing to their strict integrity, informed me that when Seif and Sultan, the Imam Ahmed's sons, seized their brother Said and kept him bound in the Eastern fort, they sent to the merchants of Maskat and demanded some security of them for their persons and property. The merchants accordingly took the boxes in180 the imams of 'oman. which they kept their gold and silver, aud delivering thera to the two brothers said: ' This is our security to you, aud you may dispose of the pledge as you please.' On the termination of hostilities between the Imam and his two sons, the latter did not leave the fort until every one who had deposited a pledge in their hands received it back again untouched. God reward Seif and Sultan for having behaved with such praiseworthy uprightness during those distracted times ! Another authority, namely, the sheikh Khamis-bin-Salim, el-Hashimy, related the following as having occurred during the war between the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said and his two sons Seif and Sultan. He said: ' I was on very friendly terms with Seif, the Imam's son, and had often corresponded with -him. On arriving at Maskat from er-Rastak, I called upon the Imam, who was then residing on the Island, and found him sitting outside the house. I sat with him for about half an hour, and then asked permission to go and see his sons Seif and Sultan in the Eastern fort, which he readily accorded. I found matters in the fort in a dreadful state, owing to the shot which had reached it from sea and land. On seeing me, and before shaking hands, Seif shook his head. After I had shaken hands with the two brothers and had sat down with them, Seif said: 'O Khamis, you find us in a deplorable condition, with a house destitute of every thing. There is no excuse for one accounted liberal who does not treat a guest with liberality/ I replied ' I have not come to you in the hope of getting any silver or gold from you, especially while you are engaged in this disastrous revolt and siege; but I have come to look upon your generous faces, for my feet were put in motion by all that I heard of your proceedings, and by what has taken place during this siege, and I wished to know how far you deserved praise or blame in this affair. Thank God, I find you in health—a subject of joy to your friends and of grief to your enemies.ahmed-bin-sa'id. 181 What excuse could I have found in the law of gratitude had I remained at home, after all your past kindness to ine? By Allah! the true friend is bound to visit his friends as well when they are in adversity as in prosperity/ I then quoted the words of the poet: 1 Visit those you love, though your abode be distant, And clouds and darkness have arisen between you ; For no obstacle ought to restrain a friend From often visiting the friend he loves.' ' He went on to say: 'I remained with them till the after noon, and when I was coming away, Seif, the Imam^s son, followed me, and taking hold of the handle of his dagger he broke off six gold rings 1 therefrom, and presenting them to me said, f Take these, Khamis; and forgive your friend's shortcomings/ 1 rejoined: f Were it not that I might vex you by so doing, I should certainly return these to you and then take my leave, after saluting you; for it is hardly befitting in a time like this, when every thing is in disorder and great changes are taking place through the destruction of property, that one should accept presents/ ' Say no more/ was his reply, ' but go in peace/ I then went to their father and detailed all that had occurred during m}'- visit; he remarked, * Such are they who are ambitious for glory/ and quoted these lines:— 4 The ambitious man inherits madness. And vexation rankles in his breast: lie looks in health and yet is sick ; lie is in health and yet looks sick.' ' Jlespecting the war about el-Ghabby between the Imam and Nasir-bin-Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, 2 I have to remark that it occurred ten years before the war between the Imam and his sons Seif and Sultan, at Maskat; that, 1 The hilts of the daggers worn by persons of rank in 'Oman arc generally richly mounted with gold and jewelled rings. 2 In the sequel lie is sometimes styled Muhammad-bin-Nasir.182 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. agaiiij was ten years before the war between the Imam and Belarab-bin-Himyar. 1 The origin of the war between Ahmed- bin-Said and Nasir-bin-Muhammad, el-Ghafiry, was as fol lows :— Muhammad-bin-Nasir was reckoned one of the cleverest men among the Arabs. He inherited large possessions from his father, and owned much property in el-Bahrein, over which the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif had appointed him Wali when he took that island from the Persians. 2 On the death of the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif and the disputes which arose among the el-Yaarubah, the Persians attacked el- Bahrein 3 with a large army and demanded the surrender of the castle called Arada, 4 offering at the same time to pay Muhammad-bin-Nasir any price which he chose to ask for it. Their proposal to him was this: 'You were Wali on behalf of Sulta,n-bin-Seif, but he is now dead and you can expect no aid either from his sons or the el-Yaclrubah; hence, you had better accept from us any sum you like to name and return to your home.' Nasir, however, declined the offer, but as the siege was prolonged and he received no assistance from the el-Yaarubah, he eventually made peace with the Persians and surrendered the castle to them, retaining however all the property which he had acquired on the island, and re ceiving from the Persians a bunch of grapes made of gold. He then quitted the island for 'Oman, disembarking at es- Sir, from whence he went to ezh-Zhahirah. On reaching el-Ghabby, all the Nizariyyah paid their respects to him and he became their head. He then requested permission to build a house at 'Ainein, 5 near the source of the stream, 1 See p. 166 et seq. 2 See p. 94. 3 During the reign of Seif-bin-Sultan. The capture of the island is referred to at p. 142, 4 'Arada is the name of one of the small islands off el-Bahrein, from which they are only separated at very high tides. There is still a fort on 'Arada. 5 Probably Wellsted's ' Inan,' not far from 'Obry, which he describes as a small town with a fort, the residence of a sheikh.ahmed-bin-sa'id. 183 but as thoy refused he did not press the matter until the government of the el-Yaarubah was overthrown and 'Oman fell into the hands of the glorious Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, and none of the el-Yaarubah remained to oppose him after the death of Belarab-bin-Himyar. Nasir-bin-Muhammad then contracted an alliance [by marriage] with the Imam, and became most intimate with him, always manifesting the most devoted loyalty to him. Finding that the Imam al ways treated him with great consideration, he remarked to him one day : ' I do not know why I have made over the fort of el-Ghabby to any other but yourself, seeing that you are the Imam of all ^Oman.' The latter replied : &lt;f I do not wish any disputes to arise between me and the people of ezh-Zhahirah, more especially since you have become my brother-in-law, and they have placed you at their head.' To this Nasir rejoined : ' I do not like matters to remain as they are; what I want is that you should have the fort of el-Ghabby, for if you hold it none of the people of the ezh- Zhahirah will be able to withstand you. Therefore send one of your Walis with me and I will make the fort over to him.' The Imam accordingly dispatched Muhammad-bin- 'Amir, el-Bu-Saidy, with him, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir put him in possession of the fort of el-Ghabby, saying : ' Do not be afraid, for I will support you with men and money.' Muhammad-bin-'Amir^s impartial administration soon ex cited the displeasure of the demagogues, who accordingly complained of him to Nasir-bin-Muhammad. The latter re plied : ' By Allah ! the Wali has only done what is just and right; but you are a revolting set and do not like justice and uprightness, and whoever befriends you is sure to ac quire your enmity. I wanted to build a house in el-'Ainein, with my own money not yours, on my own land not on yours, that it might be a safeguard to you, but you refused. I apprise you that I am wholly on the Imam Ahmed-bin- Said's side: whosoever among you obeys him is my friend;184 thk imams of 'oman. whoever opposes him is my enemy/' Nasir-bin-Muham- mad, moreover, used to repair frequently to the Imam for the purpose of indicating to him which of the tyrants he wished to have bound. Having by this means greatly weakened their power, they eventually consented to his building a house at el-'Ainein. When the house was com pleted and he had occupied it, he went to the Imam Ahmed- bin-Said, taking with him the remainder of those whom he feared, and said to the Imam : ' You have no enemies left in ezh-Zhahirah except these whom I have brought to you. Bind and imprison them, and do not let them escape, for, it they are put out of the way, all ezh-Zhahirah will submit to you.' The Imam followed his advice. On reaching Dufa-'l-Audiyah, on his return home, Nasir- bin-Muhammad said to the el-Miyayahah, 'The Imam is intent on our destruction, of which I have a foreboding, for when I went to him with the friends So-and-So he showed me no respect, but bound them, while I and my followers contrived to escape. For my part, I have determined to wage war upon him, and if you are of the same mind put the towers of your Wadis in order and make inroads on er- Rastak, and I will support you with men and money.' They accordingly agreed to revolt against the Imam, and began to work at their towers day and night until they completed them. On reaching el-Ghabby, Nasir addressed similar words to the people there, and when they had agreed to take up arms against the Imam he wrote to Ibn-Rahmah to join him with his troops, and informed him in a letter how mat ters stood. On the arrival of the latter with five hundred men he stirred up the people to attack the A\ ali, unless he surrendered the fort, and held a consultation with them on that score at el-^Ainein. This coming to the Wali's ears ho repaired to el- ; Ainein and found them, bristling with arms, collected round Nasir -bin-Muhammad, and inquired of the latter what the meeting meant. Nasir replied that he andahmed-bin-sa'id. 185 his party intended to attack him, unless he surrendered the fort to them, adding that there was no time to be lost. The Wali asked three days' delay, at the expiration of which he would either surrender the fort or fight; but on finding that he was quite unable to cope with them he surrendered the fort on the same day, and then set out with his soldiers to the Imam, to whom he reported the whole affair. There upon the Imam ordered his son Hilal to march with a strong- force to Dafa'-'l-Audiyah and to destroy all the towers erected by the el-Miyayahah, and afterwards the fort of el-Karty, which belonged to the esh-Shakil. He also wrote to Mu hammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, the Wali of Nakhl, to dispatch men from thence under the command of Muham- mad-bin-Himyar, el-Yaaruby. He also sent parties on a similar errand to the tribes of 'Oman, to the esh-Sharkiyyah and Jaalan, to the Amirs of the Belooches, and to the peo ple of Mekran, and to the Zidgal. In the meantime Hilal, the Imam's son, marched with his force to Dafa'-'l-Audiyah and destroyed all the towers of the el-Miyayahah. On reaching el-Karty he asked to have an interview with the garrison of the fort, which was re fused. He then sent Muhammad-bin-Himyar to them with offers of immunity, if they surrendered. By Muhammad's advice they agreed and accompanied him to Hilal, the Imam's son, whereupon some of his men fell on them and killed every one of them, twelve in number, all belonging to the family of Farkh-er-Rih, of the Benu-Shakil, the most devoted adherents of Nasir-bin-Muhammad. The Benu-Ghafir attributed their death to Muhammad-bin-Him yar, alleging that but for him not one of them would have lost his life. This incident, therefore, confirmed them in their hatred to the el-Yaarubah, and their animosity was not satiated until they eventually killed Seif-bin-Malik-bin- Seif, el-Yaaruby, at el-Karty, during the war of the el- Miyayahah and the Benu-Kelban at that place.186 the imams of 'oman. When Hilal, the Imam's son, had arranged matters with the el-Miyayahah and the people of el-Karty, and had de molished the fort of the latter, he returned to his father, whom he found at Sohar, where a large force had joined him from the country between Nezwa as far as the esh-Sharkiy- hah and Jaalan, Arabs and Hadhr, Yemeniyyahs and Niza- riyyahs, all of whom sided with him. Ine Imam then marched with them from Sohar to Yankal, but when he in sisted on their going on with him from es-Salif to el-Ghabby —it was then the height of summer—some of the tribes suggested delay, in order that the army might rest, for most of them travelled on foot, but he refused. Proceeding onward with his force, the two armies met at Sih-et-Tay- yab, when the Imam's ranks were broken, and only the Zidgals, the Belooches, and the Al-Wahibah remained to en counter the enemy. These were all slain, and most of the runaway force having lost their way died of thirst on the road. The Imam, accompanied only by his son Hilal, suc ceeded in reaching Nezwa by Nejd-el-Hadid; his followers who managed to reach el-Ghabby received kindly treatment from Nasir-bin-Muhammad, by whom they were sent back to their respective homes. A reconciliation took place sub sequently between the Imam and his brother-in-law Nasir- bin-Muhammad, and they entered into a solemn covenant to be true to each other. This treaty of peace was maintained until the death of Nasir-bin-Muhammad, whereupon the chiefs of ezh-Zhahirah renewed and ratified the covenant between the Imam and Seif-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad [Na- sir's son]. The Imam Ahmed was a most liberal man in every re spect : he never listened to those who attempted to slander his friends, and he never questioned the accounts of any of his Wakils. The bare statement of the latter that they had expended so much and had received khardj to such an amount was accepted by him; if any thing was due by himAHMED-B1N-SA ID. 187 he paid it at once. One of his Wakils, a man of er-Kastak —I think he was of the family of el-Hally—came to him on a certain occasion—it was on the 8th of el-Hijj, a.h . 1170, [24th August, 1757], and reported that he had expended one thousand silver Mahmudis for his, the Imam's, house hold. The Imam forthwith ordered one of his slaves to go to the house and bring him one of the bags labelled one thousand silver Mahmudis ; the man went and brought a bag which contained one thousand Mdshhhases 1 in gold. When the Wakil opened it and found that a mistake had been made he returned with it to the Imam, whereupon the latter inquired how much the bag contained. On being told that it contained one thousand gold Mdshlchases, he said: ' It is God's bounty ; therefore be grateful to Him for the gift.' So the Wakil retained the money and thanked the Imam for his liberality. Another instance to the same effect is as follows;—The Imam had appointed Rabiaah-bin-Ahmed, el-Ruwahy, who was a poor man at the time, Wakil over the property of Nuaman-Barkah. Two years after, Rabiaah began to pur chase property on his own account, as also date-trees at Barkah and el-Jau. This fact having been reported to the Imam, when the latter came to Nmlman from er-Rastak on his way to Maskat, he said to Rabiaah : ' Is it true as peo ple say that out of this agency you have managed to pur chase property in the town of Barkah and in the towns of el-Jau and Nakhl ?' The other replied : '0 Imam, I found a treasure and with it was enabled to purchase the property.' 'Where did you find it?' rejoined the Imam. 'Just where you are standing,' replied Rabiaah. The Imam, compre hending at once his figurative speech, smiled and said ; ' It is God's bounty towards you; so thank God for it and praise Him for His goodness to you.' In fine, the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said was most liberal and 1 Mdshkhas is the Arabic name for the Venetian sequin. * * J iH h : b r ..' ! «•-. i it sill I : •in i r 'J188 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. generous, and his diligence and perseverance were very- great. He died in the fort of er-Rastak, on Wednesday, in the month of Dzul-Kaadah, a.h . 1188 [January 1775], leaving seven male children, namely :— 1. Hilal. 5. Sultan. 2. Sa'id. 6. Talib. 3. Kais. 7. Muhammad. 4. Seif. Also three daughters, whose names I forbear mentioning, for propriety's sake. He was buried on the west of the fort of er-Rastak, and his son Said built a fine dome over the grave, which is a Mazdr 1 up to the present time. On the death of the Imam Ahmed the heads of the in habitants of er-Rastak and other people of 'Oman assembled together and ratified the Imamate to his son Said-bin- Ahmed. They had wished to confer it on his brother Hilal, he being the eldest and most intelligent of the late Imam's sons; but he suffered from a cataract in his eyes, which de prived him of sight, and he went to Sind to be cured. Ho remained in Sind for some time and died there. His grave, which is covered with a dome, is well known at Diyul. 2 SA'ID-BIN-EL-IMAM.

On the death of his father, Ahmed-bin-Said, all the fortresses of ^Oman were made over to him, with the exception of those at el-Hazm, Nakhl and ^abrin. He appointed his brother Kais governor of Sohar, and he was generally upright in his administration. After his election he invaded the district of es-Sirr several times and slew a great many of the Benu-Ghafir. He also invaded el-Hamra and killed the sheikh of the el-'Abertain. The people of 'Oman stood in great awe of him. Like his father he resided at er-Rastak, and he appointed Muham- mad-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil, Wali of Maskat. One year he went to Nezwa and remained there several days. The occasion was as follows :—He had heard that the people of that place were in correspondence with the learned sheikh Abu - Nebhan - Ja'id -bin - Khamis - bin -Mubarak- bin- Ydhya - bin -'Abdallah - bin - Nasir-bin- Muhammad -bin-Haya- bin-Zaid-bin-Mansur-bin-Khalil-bin-Shadzan-bin-es-Salt- bin-Malik', el-Khalily, el-Kharusy, el-Yahmady, el-Ghassany, el-Azdy, el-Kahtany, complaining of his [the Imam's] conduct, and laying things to his charge which were not true. But some of them were true, and were the common talk through out 'Oman. One was that Suid-bin-el-Imam-Ahmed was acting just as he had done when his father made him Wali over Nezwa; in fact, that he was behaving worse there and elsewhere in 'Oman, through the medium of his officials. What they principally referred to was this:—When the Imam Ahmed, during his administration, made his son Suid governor of Nezwa, Said wished to set up a monopoly for the dyeing in indigo there, and erected a building where he obliged all dyers to dye, and forbade them to dye elsewhere without his permission, and unless they paid him a certain tax. At that period the most eminent man at Nezwa was the learned sheikh Said-es-Sayighy; so the heads of the people went to him and informed him of the matter. The sheikh accordingly accompanied them to the market-place,190 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. and seeing that the monopolist had set up his implements for dyeing in indigo he sent for him and ordered him to remove his utensils, threatening to destroy them unless he did so. The man obeyed, but repaired forthwith to Said, who was at that time in the fort of Nezwa, and apprised him of what had occurred. Said broke out into imprecations against the people of Nezwa, and went to his father, who was then at er-Rastak, and complained to him of their disloyalty, but forbore telling him of his newly-invented monopoly of the indigo-dyeing. Ihe Imam remarked: 1 presume you have introduced some illegal novelty at Nezwa, and the people there have contended with you about it. Letters from the heads of the people of Nezwa subsequently reached the Imam reporting what his son Said had done: how he had established a monopoly for the dyeing in indigo, and allowed no one to dye except with his permission. Thereupon the Imam declared that he should not return to Nezwa, as he was not fit to be Wali there or over any other town in 'Oman, and the Imam accordingly appointed another person in his place, who acted justly towards the inhabitants. [Such were the antecedents of this affair.] On receiving the complaints of the people of. Nezwa, as above stated, the sheikh Ja'id-bin-Khamis 1 repaired to Nezwa, accompanied by a few of his men, to examine into the truth of their statements. He and his men were intro duced by the people into the Hujrah of el-'Akr by night, unknown to the Imam Said, who was at that time in the fort. After they had located him there, however, the inha bitants began to lose courage, and they commenced blaming one another for what had been done. It was finally resolved that the best thing they could do was to get the sheikh and his party out of the Hujrah before the Imam heard of his 1 In the preceding paragraph this sheikh is first styled Abu-Nebhan, the Father of Nebhan, Nebhan being the name of his eldest son. See note 1, p. 156.SA^ID-BIN-A TIMED. 191 being there. While they were debating this point, an old woman named 'Omariyyah, of the Benu-'Obaidan, went to the sheikh Ja'id-bin-Khamis and apprised him of the resolution which the people of Nezwa had formed, and suggested that he should quit the Hujrah before the Imam became aware of his presence. She said to him : '1 am apprehensive on your account, for you have only a few men with you; you are virtually a prisoner in the Hujrah, and the people of Nezwa who were on your side are now turned against you.' Even before this warning, however, the suspicions of the sheikh Ja'id had been aroused by the discussions which he over heard among the garrison of the Hujrah, one of whom went and informed the Imam that same night—he was then in the fort—that sheikh Ja'id had entered the Hujrah, and that the people of Nezwa seemed disposed to swerve from their alle giance to him and give it to the sheikh. On hearing this, the Imam descended from the fort by a rope, unknown to any one, and mounting his camel set out for esh-Sharkiyyah, where he levied a large force of Arabs and Hadhr. In the mean time sheikh Ja'id, suspecting the fidelity of the garrison, left the Hujrah that same night and returned to his house at el-'Alya. When the Imam Said came with his army from esh-Sharkiyyah to Nezwa, the people attempted to excuse themselves by saying that the sheikh had entered the Ilujrah without their permission; but the Imam would not be ap peased, and marched to Semed-el-Kindy, drove out its garrison, his soldiers seizing from the Hujrah at that place whatever they could lay hands on, leaving neither utensils, nor arms, nor dates, nor any thing else which they could carry off, the fugitives taking refuge in the Jebel-el- Akhdar. Some time after, the inhabitants of S^med-el- Kindy went to the Imam and assured him that they were not aware of the entrance of sheikh Ja'id into the Hujrah of el- 'Akr until after its garrison had driven him out. On receiving a renewal of their vows of obedience and loyalty the Imam192 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. pardoned them, and they returned to their homes and restored what had been destroyed. His conduct towards these people was probably owing to their having resisted his indigo- dyeing monopoly, and the measures which he had taken to establish the innovation at Nezwa; but God knows. But besides the above, the Imam began to introduce many other innovations, to the detriment of his subjects, which made him obnoxious to the people of ^Oman generally, and their chiefs eventually took counsel together to confer the Imamate upon his brother Kais. This course was agreed upon at a meeting held at el-Masnaah, at which Kais and his brothers Seif, Sultan, and Muhammad were also present. From thence they proceeded to er-Rastak and encamped at Kasra, where they summoned the Imam Said to appear before them; he refused, but sent them a repast, and as the utensils were being removed he opened fire upon them from the guns of the fort, which drove them away, and all returned to their respective homes. Two years later a similar meeting was held by the repre sentatives of the people of ^Oman to raise Kais, the son of the Imam Ahmed, to the Imamate. They accordingly took Kais to Nakhl, then under the governorship of Muhammad- bin-Suleiman-bin-'Adiy, el-Yaaruby, who sent a lad out to them with food, but refused to have an interview with them. Thereupon they left Nakhl and dispersed, each one going to his home. When Hamed [the Imam Suid^s son] saw that the people of ^Oman hated his father and were disgusted with his pro ceedings, and moreover that his father persisted in his un lawful innovations, he secretly conceived the idea of obtaining possession of all the strongholds of 'Oman which were under his father's authority, not forcibly, but by stratagem, and in such a way as should not raise his father's suspicions. This design, however, he disclosed to no one. llamed was endowed with all the astuteness of an Arab,sa'id-bin-ahmed. 193 and did not communicate his secret except to his most intimate friends, and to them only in part. So he became very liberal to the people of ^Oman, and took to interceding- in behalf of those whom his father intended to wrong, to remonstrate with him on his improper proceedings, and to associate with the learned and devout. This course proved eminently successful, for in time the people of 'Oman began to prefer him to his father, and became strongly attached to him. It is probable, moreover, that some of the chiefs of 'Oman gave him to understand privately, that if he attempted to assume the government and authority then held by his father they would obey him without hesitation. To all these overtures ho used to reply; ' That cannot be: you must apply to some one else; the bare mention of such a thing is loathsome to me; moreover, all the people of 'Oman are deceitful and are not to be trusted.' Afterwards, however, he used to send presents to those who had made the sug gestions. He was always on the watch for a favourable opportunity to usurp his father's authority, and thought he had found one when hostilities broke out between the people of el-Yamn and the Nizar, the inhabitants of Azka. As the war between these parties was prolonged, Hamed suggested to his father to go and quell the disturbance. His father agreed, and having levied a large force from er-Rastak and other places he went to Azka, taking his two sons Hamed and Ahmed with him. On reaching Nejd-es-Sahamah he proceeded from thence to esh-Sharkiyyah, and collected a considerable number of the Arabs and Hadhr, but the greater part of his force consisted of Arabs. When they arrived at Azka they were attacked by the Nizar, and there was a great battle between them, which ended in the defeat of the Nizar, a great number of whom were killed. Then peace was made between the latter and the people of el-Yamn, through the mediation of the Imam Said. When the Imam was about to leave Azka for er-Rastak194 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. his son Humed said to him : 'We now know all about the affair of Azka, and what has occurred there ; but what about Mdskat ? You say that you have made Muhammad-bin- Khalfan -bin-Muhammad, el-BA-Saidy, the Wakil, governor there. And I have heard that Muhammad has removed the soldiers which you left in the Eastern and Western forts, and has, on his own behalf, placed Subaih, edh-l)hubany, in the Eastern, and Mas'ud-bin-el-Barihy in the Western fort; you may believe that he is acting as your Wali, but the fact is far different.' His father replied: 'I do not believe that Muhammad-bin-Khalfan has exchanged the garrisons in the forts without some good reason ; for what he who is present sees, he who is absent cannot see. Moreover, I have no suspicion that Muhammad-bin-Khalfan would do any thing to our disadvantage, for, in reality, he is nothing more than one of our Walis.' Hamed rejoined: 'If such is your opinion, send a messenger to him with a letter, under your own hand, directing him to forward you a supply of money and rice for your large force. If he obeys, you may infer that he is a loyal Wali and vicegerent; if he refuses, you will know that he is what I have represented him to be.' To this his father consented. Then Hamed wrote to Mu hammad-bin-Khalfan, without his father's knowledge, and dispatched the letter before his father's messenger left. The letter was to this effect: 'Don't forward any thing to my father: he has succeeded in his wishes at Azka, but he has not disbanded his force, and he intends to attack you and to dispossess you, certain persons having excited his sus picions because you have changed the garrisons; also because you have purchased a number of slaves, and for your kind ness to Subaih, edh-Dhubany, in having placed him over the Eastern fort, and for having ordered that whenever he came on a visit to you, or traversed the streets of Maskat, he should be preceded and followed by a party of soldiers. Further, that you have shown great favour to Mas'(id, el-sa'id-bin-ahmed. 195 Barihy, by putting him in charge of the Western fort, and allowing him to wear a turban of Cashmere shawls. There can be no doubt that if you send my father what he has applied for, he will come with his horse and foot and depose you from your governorship, even if you escape death.' Isow all this was a snare and stratagem on Hamed's part to gain his own ends. His letter arrived before that of his father, and on reading it Muhammad considered it as a proof of sincere affection on the part of a true friend. So, when the messenger arrived with the letter from the Imam Said, he said to him: ' Return to the Imam and tell him that Muhammad - bin - Khalfan has nothing belonging to him. That is my reply to his letter,' When the messenger returned to the Imam and repeated what Muhammad-bin-Khalfan had said, the Imam took his son lltimed aside by the hand and said : 'You were right, my son, in what you stated about Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, for he has refused to forward what I asked for.' He then related to him all that the messenger had stated. There upon Hamed went on to say: ' Father, I did not like to tell you, but it was the truth ; for I have persons at Mdskat who inform me of all his proceedings. You have been so absorbed in the affairs of Azka that you have overlooked Maskat; but do not flatter yourself that it is yours.' The Imam rejoined: ' My son, what is our best course with him V The other answered; ' Send your son, my brother Ahmed, to reprove him and to see how the case really stands, m order that we may find out what his secret intentions are towards us. Let Ahmed bring us his answer, and let us not leave Azka for er-Rastak or elsewhere until his return.' Said having decided to follow this suggestion, Hamed wrote to Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, without his father's knowledge, to the following effect: 'When my brother Ahmed reaches you, bind and imprison him before he has time to bind and imprison you; by so doing you will put an end to his envy196 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. of you and his hankering after Maskat.' He sent the letter by one of his most intimate friends, and it reached Mnham- mad-bin-Khalfan before Ahmed. When the latter arrived, Muhammad imprisoned him in the hall of the Island, but his attendants fled back to Azka. When they informed the Imam of what Muhammad-bin-Khalfan had done to his son Ahmed, his face changed colour and he said to his son Hamed: 'This is the result of your kind suggestion; Muhammad-bin-Khalfan has imprisoned your brother and bound him in the hall on the Island—an infamous outrage on his part.' His son Humed replied : 'Father, I suggest that we go to Maskat with one hundred men, not more, and halt at Eiwa, and from thence I will go forward to Muham- mad-bin-Khalfan and, God willing, will release Ahmed and bring him to you.' His father rejoined; ' Hamed, is not one enoughwithoutyour becoming another? Becauseyour brother has fallen into the snare, do you wish to fall into it also?' Hamed replied: 'Father, be under no apprehension, and let me have my own way in this matter;' adding much more to the same effect. Thereupon Hamed sent a letter to Muham- med-bin-Khalfan, in which he wrote: 'When this my letter reaches you, assemble the people of Maskat and el-Matrah, together with your attendants and soldiers, and station your self at Sih-el-Harmel, and on hearing that we have reached Riwa send a letter by a messenger to my father, saying: ' if you wish your son to be liberated, let your son Hamed come to me—I pledge his safety—and you and your followers remain at Eiwa, for if you take one step in advance beyond that, I will attack you with my horse and foot. Salam.' Accordingly, when the messenger with Hamed's letter arrived, Muhammad collected together the people oi Mas kat and el-Matrah—the fighting and non-fighting men— also his soldiers and slaves, making in all a large force of horse and foot, and encamped with them at Sih-el-Harmel. When the Imam Said and his son 1 lamed and theirsa'id-bin-ahmed. 197 attendants reached Riwa, the watchmen at es-Sedd and the people of the place informed them of the great number of horse and foot which Muhammad-bin-Khalfan had assembled, and that he was posted with them at Sih-el-Harmel. There upon the Imam Said and his retinue remained at Riwa, while Hamed went forward to Muhammad-bin-Khalfan. On meet ing they clasped hands, Muhammad treating Hamed with great cordiality. He then said to him: '1 have not thwarted your wishes, 0 Hamed, because of your father's designs against me, as revealed in your letter/' Hamed replied: '1 merely told you the truth; be good enough to release my brother Ahmed, and thereupon we shall return to er-Rastak. As to yourself, remain in your appointment, which no one will interfere with. God willing, I will come back to you after our return to er-Rastak, and will settle all these diffi culties and make peace between you and my father/' Muhammad consented and forthwith set Ahmed at liberty. Some days after, Hamed said to his father; ' Have you thought of any scheme for depriving Muhammad-bin-Khalfan of his post, and for seizing the fortifications which he holds, without having recourse to hostilities V The Imam replied : 'No; that is beyond any human power now, seeing that Muhammad-bin-Khalfan is firmly established and possesses great resources, as also vast wealth ; but it would be quite excusable to employ stratagem against him/' Hamed re joined : If I devise a stratagem and succeed in seizing what he holds, will you promise to commit the same to my hands; and, further, will you consign over to me all the forts of 'Oman which your right hand has acquired, save the fort of er-Rastak, and I on my part will be loyal to you and do whatsoever is right in the sight of God ?' His father an swered: 'Yes; for why should I refuse to promise what you have asked, seeing that whatever is yours is mine V Hamed replied: 'Very well; I will set out for Maskat, and should a messenger reach you with a letter from me hasten198 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. thither with all the troops you can levy.' This being agreed to^ Hamed started, accompanied by one hundred men, taking with him a large sum of money. On reaching Maskat his followers remained near the Island while he went on to the house of the Wakil, Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, where his son Muhammad-bin-Khalfan also resided. When he reached the room where the latter was sitting with some company, Khalfan and his son went forward to greet him, and then ordered a repast to be prepared. The repast over, H^med said to Khalfan-bin-Muhammad : ' I have come to adjust all differences between my father and your son Muhammad. Let your son pay to my father Said so much annually, and then no one shall interfere with the proceeds of the appoint ments which he holds.' Both having agreed to that arrange ment, Hamed then asked their permission to remain in Maskat for three days. ' The town is yours to remain in as long as you please,' was their reply. After prayers, Hamed begged them to make ready for him a part of the house known as the Nawwab's. It was accordingly duly furnished with fine carpets and a supply of provisions, and Hdmed and his followers went to reside there. The night following, he took half of the money which he had brought with him and fifty of his men and went to the Eastern fort. On reaching the outer gate he called for Subaih, edh-Dhubany, the com mandant of the garrison, who came down and admitted him and his followers into the fort. He then addressed the commandant in these words : ' Subaih, you have been un grateful for my father's kindness to you while you were at er-Rastak and have become our enemy. Has blindness led you to act thus, O Subaih ? My father sends his regards to you and has given me this money for you, and has ordered me to remain in the fort with my followers until he and his followers come to Maskat. He has further ordered that you should disobey Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, who is merely one of our Wakils, because he has insulted us; hence, you aresa'id-bin-ahmed. 199 not to carry out his instructions in any matter connected with the administration. Should he come to the fort, or any one on his behalf, you must refuse to admit them, and should they attempt to force an entrance you must open fire upon them with musketry and cannon.' To all this Subaih assented. Having succeeded so perfectly with Subaih, Hamed descended from the fort alone, leaving his attendants be hind him, and went to the Nawwab's house for the re mainder, whom he conducted to the Western fort. (The Western fort was then held, on behalf of Muhammad-bin- Khalfan, by Mas'ud-bin-Ahmed, el-Barihy, with whom Hamed had corresponded before he came to Mdskat.) When he reached the outer gate and announced himself, the doorkeeper went to inform Mas'ud, who forthwith gave orders for his admission, together with his men, remarking that the fort was Hamed ; s, and that they were his subjects, and that Muhammad-bin-Khalfan was merely one of the government agents. On entering the fort Hdmed said to Mas'ud: 'My father sends you his best regards, and gave me this money for you,' etc., just as he had said to Subaih in the Eastern fort. Mas'ud having agreed to carry out these instructions, Hamed left his fifty men in the Western and went back alone to the Eastern fort. All this was done by Hamed during the night of the day after his arrival at Maskat. Now, that same night Majid-bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad happened to be near the Island, on the way to his father Khal- fan's house, intending to put his brother Muhammad-bin- Khalfan on his guard against Hamed. He saw the latter near the Karhhdnah 1 coming from the Western fort, with his head enveloped in a cloth, so that nobody might recognize him; he was also walking very fast. This excited his sus picions, but, not being certain whether it was Hdmed or not, 1 A workshop or factory.200 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. « he followed until he saw him enter the Eastern fort, which convinced him that he had not mistaken the man. He ac cordingly repaired to his fathers house, and on meeting his father and brother told them all that had occurred, and as sured them that the individual he saw was Hamed. ' Lay aside all such speeches,' said his brother Muhammad; ' for Hamed is my friend and I am in all his secrets.' Majid re plied : ' If you doubt my word, come with me to the Naw- wab's house, and if we find Hamed and his followers there I will confess myself in the wrong; but if we do not find them there, know that I am right.' They accordingly took one hundred men and repaired to the NawwaVs house, which they found occupied by the furniture and domestic utensils only. This convinced Muhammad that all Hdmed^s dealings with him were so many manoeuvres on his part; and, further, that they had been successful. At dawn the following day Muhammad assembled all his slaves and soldiers and marched with them to the Eastern fort, but on their ap proach they were assailed with musketry and cannon. He then proceeded towards the Western fort, but when they reached the Karhhanah, Hamed and Mas^ud's followers opened fire upon them with muskets. Muhammad thereupon returned to his house and gave up all hope of retaining Maskat and its fortifications. As to Hamed, on his return from the Western to the Eastern fort, he wrote at once to his father Said requesting him to join him without delay. Said accordingly levied a strong force from er-Rastak and other places and hastened to Maskat. On his arrival there he put up on the Island and sent for his son to come to him. As soon as the messenger reached him, Hamed ordered a salute to be fired from all the guns, and all the flags to be hoisted, and the report of the cannon from the forts, walls, and ships resounded on all sides. When Hamed met his father they clasped hands and he gave him all the news. Then the merchants and notableshamed-bin-sa id. 201 of Maskat and el-Matrah came to pay their respects; Khalfan and all his sons also came and saluted the Imam Said and his son Hamed, which the latter returned courteously. When they were seated, however, Hamed said to Muham- mad-bin-Khalfan : 'We have deposed you from the gover norship, but we forgive your past misdeeds and your crimes against us, and we give you our assurance of protection.' Thereupon both parties covenanted to be faithful to each other, and Muhammad-bin-Khalfan and his brothers returned home with their father. Subsequently, Hamed sent for Suleiman-bin-Khalfan and appointed him Wali of Maskat in his brother's place. The Imam Said only remained three days longer at Maskat and then went back to er-Eastak, which thereafter he made his principal residence, always returning thither from any trips which he made in ^Oman; but the administration of affairs was now wholly in the hands of his son Hdmed. Such is the account of the transfer of the government of Oman from the Imam Said to his son HAMED-BIN-EL-IMAM-SA'ID, btn-el-lmam-ahmed-bin-sa^id, el-bu-sa'idy. When Hamed had taken possession of Maskat from Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, and his father Said had made over to him all the forts of 'Oman which were under his authority, all the notables of 'Oman paid their respects to him. He, on his part, treated them with great courtesy, and adminis tered the government with uprightness and justice. The tribes held him in great awe, and God prospered him in all his undertakings. He patronized men of learning and piety, and abolished tyranny and oppression. Among the number of his intimate friends were the learned and devout sheikh, the Kadhi Mubarak-bin-'Abdallah, en-Nezawy; the sheikh 26 || | i # J202 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. Suleiman-bin-Nasir, el-Muhallaly; the sheikh Ahmed-bin- Nasir, el-Harasy; the sheikh Khamis-bin-Salim, el-Hashimy; the sheikh Fadhl, el-Yahmady; the sheikh Muhammad, el- Aama, and many others. Hamed made Maskat his residence, only leaving it when ever he had business to transact in ^Oman. When hostilities broke out between the el-Maawal and the people of iSakhl, owing to the latter having demolished the Hujrah ot el- Janah which belonged to the former, H^imed backed the el-Maawal with men and money. Subsequently, however, he intervened to effect a reconciliation between them. Ihe learned took counsel about his having taken the part ho did in this matter, and as the decision was that the party against whom he acted had been in the wrong, they exacted no penalty from him, especially as he had atoned for any irregularity which he may have committed. Another account of this affair is that when Hamed decided on making war upon Nakhl he collected the Arabs of Jaalan, namely, the Benu-Hasanand their allies, and joining thereunto the Arabs of the coast and the people of er-Rastak and other Hadhr, he marched with his force upon Nakhl, accompanied by the el-Maawal, but was repulsed. On his return to Barkah he sent for the sheikhs of the el-Jibur and those of the el-Hikman and en-Nawafil, and when they arrived he directed them to bring the Wali of Nakhl to him. ( r l he Wali at the time was Muhenna-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby.) They accordingly wrote to him to that effect, and he set out accompanied by some of the men of Nakhl. On reaching the 'Akabah of et-Tau, he met the above-named sheikhs with a large retinue, and they conducted him to Barkah, where peace was made between him and Hamed, and a procla mation was issued by beat of drum that the people of Nakhl were amnestied. Hamed then permitted Muhenna to return to Nakhl and promised to follow him shortly, in order to adjust matters between him and his neighbours the el-hamed-bin-el-imam-sa'id. M aawal. When lie subsequently repaired thither, he and his suite put up at Sabarat-Habashy, where he assembled the el-Maawal and the Benu-Muhallal and effected a recon ciliation between them. After partaking of a hospitable feast prepared for them by Muhenna, Hamed and his fol lowers and all the other guests dispersed, each returning to his home. Two days after, Hamed went alone by night from Barkah to Nakhl, only one of his most intimate friends being apprised of his journey. He reached Nakhl before dawn, and securing his camel near the mosque of Jazy, he took his arms with him and went and stood on the door-step of the fort, none of the garrison being aware of his presence. At daybreak, as one of Muhenna's slaves, named edz-Dzabab, was going out into the town on business, he saw Hamed and inquired who he was. He said: 'I am Hamed; go and tell Muhenna that I am here on the door-step.' When the servant went back he found his master Muhenna in the room of prayer attached to the fort, engaged in reading the blessed Kuran. On receiving the message he immediately ai'ose and went to Honied, and taking him by the hand brought him into the fort; whereupon they both sat down to read the Kuran together, and when the time of prayer arrived they prayed together. Then they descended towards Sabarat-Hdbashy, and when the sun arose the watchman on the tower of 'Akum cried out, ' the troops ! the troops !' Muhenna dispatched a messenger to tell him to hold his peace. The party espied were friends who had come to pay their respects to Hamed; the Kadhis and the Mutdwwa'un 1 led the way, and were followed by upwards of a thousand Arabs and Hadhr, for whom Muhenna made two feasts, the last more sumptuous than the first. Hamed remained at Nakhl till 1 Persons who serve without pay, volunteers ; but the latter term, in its usual acceptation, does not convey the sense of the original, which means men who attend upon their chiefs willingly and gratuitously.204 the imams of oman. the afternoon, and when he was about to set out on his return to Barkah he took Muhenna aside and sat down with him. The latter was the first to speak, and said: ' What was your motive in coming' alone to Nakhl by night without apprising me beforehand, and before the blood which is between us and our neighbours the el-Maawal is dry? Had any of the people of Nakhl seen you without recognizing who you were something untoward might have befallen you; to say nothing of the large number of people here who do not know you.' Hamed replied : ' Muhenna, when you came to me at Barkah you showed your confidence in me; how then can I withhold the same confidence from you ? I came to prove that confidence, and to assure you that it is sincere.' ' May God reward you!' was Muhenna^s reply. Thereupon Hamed returned to Barkah, and the mutual love and friend ship between him and Muhenna continued until Hamed's death. When Hamed assumed the administration he added a tower to the Western fort, facing el-Makulla, and armed it with large guns. He also built a castle in the village of Riwa, and another in the fortress of Barkah, in which latter he placed his largest guns, and he took the Island from its feoffees. Further, he ordered a frigate to be built at Zan zibar, which cost a large sum, and called it the er-Bahmdny. He also confirmed my father in his appointment over the customs, vesting him with full authority therein. He sent for the sheikh Salim-bin-Muhammad, ed-Darmaky, el-Azky, who was at the time at Azka, and stationed him at Barkah, in charge of the correspondence between the Muslims and the legal authorities. He confirmed the sheikh Fadhl- bin-Seif, el-Y^hmady, in a similar appointment at Maskat. His kindness towards the sheikh Salim-bin-Muhammad may serve as an example which deserves to be copied. When he had appointed him to the office aforesaid, he ordered a house to be built for him beyond the wall, and on its com-hamed-bin-el-imam-sa'id. 205 pletion he stored it with rice, dates, and sugar, and furnished it with boxes and other utensils, without letting the sheikh or the builders know for whom it was destined. He then summoned all Salim's family to Barkah, which led them to fear that the sheikh was ill. Hamed had anticipated this, and directed his messenger to tell them that he had been ordered to conduct them to the sheikh Salim at Barkah. He further directed those who were in charge of the house to tell them on their arrival that the house and all it con tained belonged to Salim, and that they were to remain in it until he joined them. On hearing of their ai'rival Hamed sent for Salim and said to him : 'You have never been out for pleasure since your stay at Barkah; will you now go out with me The two accordingly set forth together, accom panied by some of Hamed's soldiers and attendants, and followed by a large crowd of people. When they approached the house, Hamed said to Salim: 11 Enter, for all that it contains is yours,' and then left him. When Salim entered the house he saw all his relations there, and all the furniture which had been prepared for him—property enough to give wings to joy. Whereupon he praised God and thanked Hdmed heartily, and composed a magnificent eulogy com memorative of the occasion. When Hamed^s renown and power had increased, his uncle, Seif-bin-el-Imam-Ahmed, became estranged from him, owing to some previous misunderstandings which had arisen between Seif and his brother Said-bin-el-Imam [llamed's father] during the lifetime of their father, and which I have not recorded for brevity's sake. Seif went afterwards to Lamu, 1 in the country of the Zanj, whither Hamed followed him. On reaching that place and finding that his uncle Seif was dead he returned to 'Oman. Then a dispute arose between him and his uncle Sultan because 1 On the east coast of Africa, about 200 miles north of Zanzibar. It belongs to the Zanzibar state.200 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. lie had gone after Seif, and Sultan assembled the Nizariyyah of the Wadi-Semiiil, who promised to support him against every opponent, and he marched with them to the fort oi Semail, which was then under the authority of Hamed. They were admitted on the market side, but when they reached the centre of the fort they were fired upon from the tower and driven back. Then Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabiry, attacked the Hujrah of Sija and demolished it, which increased Hamed's enmity against his uncle Sultan. He accordingly collected a large force, but on reaching Semiiil his officers dissuaded him from attacking Sija, representing to him that as the spring was in the Hujrah those who held it might cut off the supply of water; moreover, that if the weir were broken up the country around would be flooded, and none would be able to cross it. They urged much more to the same effect, insomuch that he forbore attacking the place and also others belonging to the Benu-Jabir, who were well disposed towards Sultan. Thereupon he disbanded his fol lowers and returned to Maskat, and from thence proceeded on a visit to his father Said. During Hamed's absence at er-Rastak, Sultan assembled the Benu-Jabir and all the Nizariyyah of Semail and attacked el-Matrah, entering it by the 'Akabat-el-Merakh, and succeeded in plundering the market and dwellings, from which they carried off a large booty to Dar-Sit, where Sultan remained with them. On hearing this, Suleiman-bin-Khalfan assembled all the people and soldiers of Maskat, of which he was then Wali, and marched against him. When he reached the end of the 'Akabah overlooking Dar-Sit and el-1 1 alj. Sultan and the men of Semail attacked him, and he was obliged to retreat to Maskat with the loss of many killed and wounded. Sultan and his followers pursuing them as far as Jabrawwah. Sultan then returned to Dar-Sit and el-Falj, and after re maining there two days marched with his force to Semail. Suleiman-bin-Khalfan was quite unequal to coping withhamkd-bin-el-imam-sa'id. 207 Sultan, and as Hamed felt that he was similarly situated a truce was agreed upon between him and his uncle Sultan, each promising not to molest the other. Then Hamed made an incursion into the Wadi-es-Sahtan, returning to Maskat after he had razed its towers and coerced its inhabitants. He next went to Barkah, from whence he proceeded with a few followers to Nezwa, and there began to levy soldiers from esh-Sharkiyyah, the Arabs of el- Batinah, and the chiefs of Azka and its dependencies, in forming none of its object except the Benu-Kelban, with whom he arranged about the time when they were to join him against Behla, to which place he moved as soon as he had collected a large army. (The fort of Behla was then in the hands of Rashid-bin-Malik, el-^Obry, the Sahib of el-'Iraky, between whom and the Benu-Kelban there was a grudge, which had induced them to suggest to Hamed the attack on Behla.) Their combined forces entered the place before daybreak, unknown to Rashid-bin-Malik, who had only a small garrison with him in the fort. On hearing an outcry in the town he rushed to the tower on the wall, which some of the Benu-Kelban had seized, and blew them up with gun powder, not one of them escaping. He then attacked Hiimed's camp in detail, and nearly succeeded in driving all his fol lowers out of the town, although his party did not exceed seven men. Such is the account of my informant, and I have never hoard it contradicted. It is further stated that when Rashid was eventually slain, only one man, named Simman, remained fighting by his side. On taking posses sion of the fort, Hamed made it over to the Benu-Hinah, and then returned with his troops towards Maskat, but on reach ing the Birkat-et-Talah he was attacked from one of the towers in the road by the solitary guard, a man of the Benu-Riyam, who occupied it. This man succeeded in shooting several of the force, and when he had expended his shot he charged his musket with pieces of the iron chain208 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. attached to his kmfe, which he cut up for that purpose. He then issued forth unarmoured, sword in hand, and was not dispatched until he had killed two men more. Notwithstanding the renown which Hamed had acquired throughout ^Oman and elsewhere, nevertheless, whenever his uncle Sultan was named he used to remark: 'I don't believe that any king or hero ever equalled Sultan for for titude and bravery;' and Sultan used to say the same of Hamed. The following anecdote recounted to me by the Kadhi Said-bin-Ahmed-bin-Ssiid, el-Yahmady, serves to illustrate their mutual feelings in this respect. He said: ' I was myself in the service of Fadhl-bin-Seif, el-^t ahmady, while he was attached to the Seyyid Hdmed, the son of the Imam Said. One day we accompanied Hamed to Barkah, where we arrived about sunset, and found that Sultan had reached Nuaman before us. AV hen the crier of the mosque proclaimed the prayer of the Fajr, 1 Fadhl and I repaired to the fort and found Hdmed in the room of prayer. After we had prayed the Sunnah of the Fajr, Hamed said to Fadhl- bin-Seif, ' Say the Fardh? for us/ When Fadhl had recited the prayer and the Duol (i^ Horned said, ( I shall now read something from the Kuran;' so he went to one side of the room and covered his head with his cloth, while Fadhl and I remained perusing the blessed book. W hen the sun rose, Fadhl went to him and said : c Come let us say the prayer of the TJhdha.' 4, He replied: 'Bring me the dish and ewer.' 1 Fajr, daybreak, or when the first gleam of light appears in the east. 2 The Muslim is required to pray at five stated times every day ; the service for each consists of two parts, one called Sunnah, appointed by the Prophet, and the other Fardk, ordained by the Kuran. 3 The Duad is a short petition which the worshipper offers up— generally in words taken from the Kuran—before the final salutation in the last prayer of each service. While thus engaged he looks at the palms of his hands, which he holds like an open book before him, and then draws -over his face, from the forehead downwards. See Lane's Modern Egyptians, vol. i, p. 112. 4 This is not one of the five appointed times of prayer, and I amiumed-bin-el-imam-sa'id. 209 After performing his ablutions he requested Fadhl to recite the prayer. That done, J ,1 adhl said to him, ( 1 adjure you by the name of God to tell me what occupies your thoughts this morning/ He replied: f If you wish me to tell you send your cousin away/ Fadhl rejoined : ' Do not hesitate on his account, for I have proved him, and found him worthy of being trusted with a secret/ Hamed then said, 'I have been thinking of three things, and unless I attain them my life will be unbearable; and yet their attainment is very difficult. First, there is Mombasah; 1 but its fort is strong, and it is held by the terrible Wanika, a people whom God alone can number. Secondly, Bombay, which is a town of great resources and thickly populated/ Thereupon Fadhl remarked: 'We are aware of those two things, but what is the third V Hdmed was silent for some time and then said, ' The third is of greater importance than the other two/ ' What is it? , inquired Fadhl. He replied, 'The man who reached Nuaman before our arrival at Barkah/ 'Why, that is your uncle Sultan,' said Fadhl, 'and we hear that he has only twelve men with him/ 'Nevertheless,' replied Hamed, ' he is of more consequence to me than either Mombasah or Bombay/ After being silent for an hour he ordered one of his slaves to have all his horses saddled, and directed that he and another should go into the town and bring him every Arab who possessed a camel. In the course of an hour a large number of horsemen and camel-men were collected, and we mounted with him and proceeded with them towards IS uaman, to invite his uncle Sultan to a feast. When we reached the small cocoa-nut trees. Sultan came towards us, accompanied by twelve men, all of whom dismounted, and Sultan advanced, leading his camel, with shield and sword unable to say whether the custom of praying at sunrise is peculiar to the 'Omanis or not. 1 Mombasah, an island on the cast coast of Africa about one hundred miles to the northward of Zanzibar, to which principality it at present belongs.210 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. slung over liis shoulder. Hamed opened tlie greeting, but without alighting from his horse. He said : c Uncle, I have come expressly to invite you and your party to a feast.' Sultan replied: f You and your party had better come on to Nuaman, for your fort there is nearer than your walled fort.' So Hdmed went and we with him to Nuaman, and we had a chat with Sultan, and were entertained by him at a sumptuous feast, and did not leave on our way back till the hour of noon. Sultan accompanying us as far as the small cocoa-nut trees. The day after our return Fadhl-bin-Seif said to Hamed, * Was it quite the thing in you Hamed— you who are so uniformly courteous?' 'What do you mean V rejoined Hamed. The other added : ' Your uncle Sultan met you on foot, leading his camel, out of respect to you, whereas you did not dismount from your horse. Y:ou are by no means a haughty personage, and you should have done as he did, for being your uncle he is as your father and you are as his son/ f By Allah!' replied Ilamed, 'although 1 was on horseback and my uncle on foot my mind was not easy.' * How can that be/ said Fadhl, * seeing that you had a cloud of horsemen and camel-men before and behind you, bestridden by men as swift as the lightning ?' 'Very true,' replied Hamed; 'but if my uncle Sultfin had barely drawn his sword they would have been swift to flee from me.'' Again, on the other hand, when the Al-Wahibah came to the Seyyid Sultan, saying, ' Hdmed does not deserve to retain the government, and you can deprive him of it; we will therefore lay in wait for him on his way from Barkah to Maskat, attack him by night, fall upon his followers, and, by the power of God, scatter them right and left, and leave you to seize and bind him, by which means you will be able to take Maskat,' Sultan replied: ' Such a proceeding would neither become you nor me, therefore say no more on the subject.' They persisted, however, in their importunities, and one day while Hamcd was on his way from Barkah toahmed-bin-el-imam-sa'id. 211 Maskat—Sultan was at Semiiil with one hundred of the Al- Wahibah at the time—they set scouts to watch his move ments. These having returned and informed them that Hamed would pass the night at RIvva, Sultan moved with them from Semail. When Humed reached Eiwa he encamped Avith his attendants near the well of the Sarhanj, and was followed by Sultan and his party, who put up near the fort which Hdmed had built, but neither Hamed nor any of his men were aware of their presence. During the night the Al-Wahibah awoke Sultan and said : u We have reconnoitred the party and found them asleep: you will never have a better opportunity against Hamed ;' but he delayed getting up until the morning had dawned. Then when Hamed and Sultan had both said the prayer of the Fajr, the former was apprised of the presence of Sultan and his party, and sent one of his followers to request him to come to him. The messenger having met Sultan coming towards him returned and told Hamcd, who thereupon directed one of his servants to take a ewer and walk before him, but not to carry any arms. On reaching the commencement of Sih-el-Harmel, Hamed performed his ablutions and prayed two Rakaahs, and then bade the servant to go and tell Sultan to come to him. The man found Sultan standing, waiting until Hiimed had finished his devotions, and after kissing his hands and saluting him said, ' My lord, your son Hamed wishes to see you.' So Sultan went, and uncle and nephew clasped hands —the latter being armed with a dagger only. Hamed then opened the colloquy and said: 'Uncle, I do not know what your intention is, nor who has- instigated you to take this step; but you will never have a similar opportunity, there fore carry out your design.' Sultan began to apologize, and said; ' My son, I have only come to you for good; so put aside all suspicion and think well of me. You should not listen to evil whisperings about me,'even as I disregard them about you. I look upon what you possess as if it were212 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. mine, and I do not envy your enjoyment of it.' After talking together for a long while they returned to their respective encampments, and then Hamed ordered his people to proceed onward to Maskat, Sultan and his party accom panying them as far as el-Matrah, where Hamed presented them with robes of honour and many presents. Sultan then returned to Semail and Hamed went on to Maskat. During Hamed'3 administration there was a severe drought in Oman, far exceeding that which had occurred before his father Said transferred the government to him. Most of the date-trees died, and the greater portion of the inhabitants fled to el-Batinah and Maskat, and the price of a bucket of water at el-Matrah rose to ten fals, the owners of the wells there refusing to sell it for less. AV hen Hamed heard of this he went forth with the people to pray for rain, on the first day in the great Wadi, on the second in the central Wadi, and on the third in the small Wadi, near Maskat. While he and the people were so engaged, a cloud appeared in the heavens, followed by lightning and thunder; then the clouds covered the sky, and the rain descended, as if poured from buckets. Thereupon Hamed mounted his horse and rode away swiftly, and he had scarcely reached the Island before the waters ran from the valleys into the sea. Great fertility throughout 'Oman followed, and its inhabitants returned thither; the crops became abundant and prices were low. Seven years after Hamed's first efforts to attain the government, and three years after securing it, he ordered a large levy of soldiers throughout 'Oman without apprising any one what use he intended to make of them. He ordered the levies to repair to Barkah, he himself remaining at Maskat. When the force was assembled, the people of el- Hazm suspected that he intended to employ it against them; Kais, the son of the Imam [Ahmed], thought that he was about to attack Sohar; others, that he designed tohamed-bin-el-imam-sa'id. 213 make war upon his father and drive him from er-Rastak; whilst others again fancied that he was bent on a campaign against Mombasah. On his way to join the army, and while at Sih-el-Harmel, he was seized with fever, and being unable to proceed returned to M^skat, where the fever developed into small-pox, which covered his entire body. He accord- ingly sent for his father, who joined him without delay, and on the night of his father's arrival the ship er-Hahmdny was burnt. When the flames broke out there was a great out cry, and on being told the cause he remarked, ' I do not know who has burnt the ship, but if I recover from this malady the guilty shall not go unpunished.' He survived three days, and died on Thursday, the 18th of Rajab, a.h . 1206, [13th March, 1792], and was buried at dawn on the slope of the central Wadi, near Maskat, a little above the graves of the two sheiks, Mas'ud-esh-Shukasy and es- Sabhy. The fifth day after the death of Hamed, the Imam Said made a large funeral feast in the Eastern fort for the notables and merchants of Maskat. He then appointed his son Ahmed- bin-Said over Maskat in the room of Hamed, and over Barkah he placed ^Aly-bin-Hilal-bin-el-Imam-Ahmed-bin-Said. He himself returned to er-Rastak, but he entirely neglected his subjects and the administration, and was wholly given to indolence, which eventually led to the transfer of the government to Sultan. Said lived to a great age and died at er-Rastak during the rule of the exalted Seyyid Said-bin- Sultan-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed]. SULTAN-BIN-EL-IMAM-AHMED, bin-sa'ld, bin-ahmed, el-bu-sa^idy, el-yemeny, el-azdy, el-'omany ; by religion an upkight ibadhy. Sultan was tall in stature, of a noble countenance, brave, spirited, animated, valiant, caring nothing for the number214 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. of his enemies, preferring a few select adherents to a mul titude of followers, and impartial in judgment. On the death of Hamed, Sultan went to 'Aly-bin-Hilal-bin-el-Imam- Ahmed-bin-Said, 1 at Barkah, of which place he ,was then governor on behall of the 1 mam feaid-bm-Ahmed. On meeting 'Aly, Sultan said to him, ' I wish you would arrange matters between me and my brother Said. Our past dif ferences were all owing to Hamed, but now that he is dead I am anxious to be reconciled to my brother Said, and trust that he will avail himself of my services against any who may oppose him in ^Oman, and appoint me a small portion of the revenues of Maskat. I entreat you therefore to go to him at once on this errand ; in the mean time I will set off for Semail, and on your return from er-llastak send me a messenger to apprise me that all has been arranged betwixt me and my brother Said, and that I may come to you again. ^Aly-bin-Hilal approving of the proposal consented, and Sultan started forthwith, but halted at er-llusail and placed scouts to watch 'Aly's movements, bidding them to let him know when 'Aly left Btr-en-Nasf. When they came and told him that 'Aly had left the Bir for er-Rastak, Sultan and his followers mounted their camels and did not dismount until they reached the fort of Barkah. It so happened that at this juncture one of the garrison was leaving the fort on his way to the market. Sultan made him over to his men, who immediately killed him, while ho himself preceded them towards the fort, at the gate of which the keeper attempted to stop him, but drawing his dagger he dispatched him on the spot. Sultan's followers were twelve in number, and among them were Khamis-bin-Rashid, el-Hinawy, and Masabbah-bin-Gharib, el-Karimy, and Mu- hammad-bin-Hamed, el-Wahiby, and Salim-bin-1 hany, el- Jab ry. With these he advanced against the towers of the 1 The son of Hilal, the Imam Ahmed's eldest son, who died in Guzerat; see p. 188.SULTAN-BIN-EL-IMAM-AH MK1). 215 fort, the garrison of which begged for quarter and were forthwith dismissed. Sultan taking possession of their posts. He then sent a messenger to et-Tau, who returned with a force of one hundred men. All this time the keep of the fortress remained in the hands of the Benu-Ruwahah, who refused his summons to surrender it to him. Thereupon he sent for the sheikh Rabuiah-bin-Ahmed, er-Ruwahy, and bade him advise his party to quit the castle, promising them quarter and that they should be allowed to take their arms with them. The sheikh did as he was requested, but the men refused to surrender; eventually, however, they sub mitted and left the castle, taking their arms with them. Then Sultan was joined by the el-Jibfir, who supplied him with dates and rice; and within a short time all the Arabs and Hadhr, together with all the people from es-Sib to el- Billah, recognized him. He then dispatched letters to the el-Maawal and the people of Nakhl, also to those of Semiiil, especially the Ni- zariyyah, appointing el-Karm as a rendezvous, and ordering them to join him with all haste. He himself and his followers set off towards Maskat, and on reaching el-Karm he found there a large number of the el-Maawal and of the people of Nakhl and Semiiil who had come to meet him. Such of the Arabs of the el-Batinah who had gone thither without his orders he dismissed to their homes. To revert to 'Aly-bin-Hilal: on reaching er-Rastak he informed Said-bin-Ahmed of the message with which he had been entrusted by Sultan, but he had hardly finished his statement when a messenger—one of the people of el- Masnaah—arrived with a letter to Said apprising him that Sultan had attacked and seized the fort of Barkah, and had marched with a large force against Mdskat. Thereupon Said reproved 'Aly-bin-IIilal for having quitted the fort of Barkah, and then added: ' Start at once by way of el- Masnaah, and embark from thence for Maskat; assist my21G THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN, son Ahnicd who is there to the best of your ability, and fight bravely against Sultan and all others who may attack either of you. Beware of cowardice, which is a base and not a noble quality.' Following these directions, 'Aly took boat at el-Masnaah and reached Maskat on the same day that Sultan reached el-Karm. From el-Karm Sultan wrote letters to the merchants and notables at Maskat, assuring them of immunity for their persons and property. Among the letters was one addressed to my father, Muhammad-bin-Razik, and brought to him by a man of the Benu-Ruwahah, named Said-bin-Musabbah, the father of Musabbah and Temim. The letter was as fol lows : 'When this reaches you, inform the people of Maskat that their persons and property shall be inviolable; for I am not coming to Maskat to plunder the inhabitants, but, as yon know, to take its two fortresses and the other defences.' After reading this epistle, my father took it to Ahmed-bin-el- Imam-Said and 'Aly-bin-Hilal, who were at that time on the Island. After showing it to them he asked : 'What is your opinion?' They replied, 'Sultan cannot prevail against Maskat while it is well supplied with arms and ammunition; besides which we are not cowards. Let him come, and, God willing, we will fight a battle with him with our swords near the hill in the great Wadi such as neither friends nor foes ever heard of.' My father thereupon left and told the merchants and notables of Maskat what Sultan had written to him and what Ahmed and 'Aly had said. They replied: ' Letters have come to us from Sultan to the same effect, promising us security and immunity. Our opinion is that Sultan will enter Mtiskat and effect his object, and that Ahmed and 'Aly will be unable to resist him, for they have not many soldiers with them. In fact, their words are vain and baseless.' In the evening of the same day, when all the notables of Maskat were assembled at his house, my father suggested that they should all cry out together, ' the enemy!sultan-bin-el-imam-ahmed. 217 the enemy!' in order to test the pluck of Ahmed and ^Aly- bin-Hilal; 'for if,' said he, 'we find that on hearing the alarm they go forth with their soldiers, we may infer that they will fight; but if they keep within the wall with their followers, and do nothing but discharge their muskets there from in the air, we may conclude that they feel themselves too weak to venture out.' The party acted on this sug gestion, and, shortly after, they heard the report of muskets which were being fired from the walls into the open space, whereby all were convinced of the cowardice of their brag gart defenders. About an hour afterwards Sultan and his force approached through the Wadi, with their swords drawn, and singing as their war-song this noble sentiment, ' The right has come and has overthrown the wrong; the wrong is overthrown !' When they reached my father's house, my father went out to Sultan, took his hand, con gratulated him, and informed him that he had read his letter to the notables and merchants of Maskat, and that they had expressed themselves much gratified at his consideration for them. This news highly delighted Sultan, who then inquired whether he could purchase a supply of dates for his hungry followers. My father took out to them forty baskets-full, and when his soldiers had eaten and rested Sultan ordered them to march against the principal gate. There they en countered a fusillade from the walls, fired by Ahmed's troops, and were obliged to retire with the loss of six men. On making a similar attempt a second time they were driven off with the loss of three men. At dawn, 'Aly-bin-'Abdallah, the sheikh of the Benu-Wahib, who had charge of the lesser gate, came to Sultan, and after saluting him told him to approach in that direction, promising to admit him. Sultan accordingly accompanied him with his force, going by the 'Akabat-Miyabin, then turning off at the foot of the 'Akabat- Sidab, and from thence into the road leading to the lesser gate. On reaching it, 'Aly-bin-'Abdallah ordered his men to218 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN open it, which they did. When Sultan and his force had passed through, the former turned to 'Aly-bin-'Abdallah and said : ' May God reprobate you, you traitor ! Begone ! for I shall not leave you in charge of the gate.' After Sultan had thus dismissed him, he appointed Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabry, and one hundred of the Benu-Jabir to hold the post. Marching from thence with the remainder of his fol lowers Sultan approached the Island, and entered it by the small eastern gate which faces the shops of the goldsmiths Muhammad-bin-Habib, er-Ramhy, and 'Abd-el-GhafFur, the Sahib of the el-Harth, driving away those who held it, and forthwith his men opened fire upon the Western fort, which the garrison returned with cannon and musketry. Then Muhammad-bin-Khalfan went with his party and dislodged Ahmed and 'Aly-bin-HilaPs men who were posted on the 'Akabahs of Killabuh and Riyam. At this time Ahmed-bin- Said occupied the Eastern and 'Aly-bin-Hilal the Western fort, but Sultan having succeeded in capturing all the other defences of Maskat the merchants and notables waited upon him on the Island to congratulate him. Then my father went to Sidab to purchase one thousand bales of dates for Sultanas army, and Sultan placed him in the custom-house to serve out rations of dates and rice, and supplies of lead and gunpowder to his soldiers. Most of the inhabitants of Maskat, however, fled from the place to escape the shot from the two forts. The ships, also, and the two batteries were surrendered to Sultan. Muhammad-bin-Khalfan was of great service to Sultan at this time, aiding him with men and money. Sultan then wrote to his brother Kais, the son of the Imam Ahmed, as follows: 'I have taken Maskat, intending to make it over to you. Therefore, when this letter reaches you march with all the forces at your disposal and encamp at el-Kasim, and prevent our brother Said from coming to Maskat.' Kais followed out these instructions, and wroteSULTAN-BIN-EL-1 MAM-AH MED. 219 moreover to his brother Said telling him that Sultan had entered Mdskat by his orders; ' therefore,' he added, ' remain where you are, at er-Rastak, and let Sultan and your son Ahmed settle matters between them, for if you attempt to move on Maskat I will march to er-Rastak. To be forewarned is to be fore-armed. Saldm.' When Said received this letter he decided to remain where he was, while Kais continued encamped at el-Kasim. Then Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-'Adiy, who commanded the Eastern fort on behalf of Said-bin-el-Imam and his son Ahmed-bin-Said, marched against the house of the Aulad-Bimah, intending to plunder it. When Sultan, who was then on the Island, heard of this proceeding he set out immediately with some of his followers to intercept them. Seeing him approach the whole party fled. Sultan suc ceeding in killing only two of them; nevertheless, he pur sued them until within a short distance of the Eastern fort. In his flight, Muhammad-bin-Suleiman wounded Mas'iid- bin-Said-bin-'Obaidan with a spear in the nose, and the spear-head penetrated through the neck. One of Sultanas followers also was shot in the thigh by a man of ezh- Zhahirah, from the Eastern fort, and he died the same night. Mas'iid, however, recovered and lived a long time after the death of Sultan. A reconciliation eventually took place between Sultan and his brother Said on these conditions :—The Eastern fort was to belong to Said-bin-el-Imam, and the Western fort was to be held by Muhammad-bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, the Wakil, and in the event of either of the brothers breaking the peace Muhammad was to make the fort over to the other. Kais-bin-el-Imam was to have the fort and towers of el-Matrah, together with its revenues. The revenue of Maskat was to be Sultan's, to expend on the army, the de fence of the Eastern fort, and to provide for the navy. Muhammad-bin-Khalfan was to be Wali of Maskat, andF r ■ fl M 'H !j*j C i*TXT 220 thk imams of oman. whenever Sultan visited the place he was to reside on the Island. Some time after the conclusion of this treaty Ahmed-bin- el-Imam-Said left the Eastern fort, and by the orders of Said-bin-el-Imam placed it in the hands of Muhammad-bin- 'Abdallah, esh-Shakasy. 'Aly-bin-Hilal also quitted the Western fort and consigned it in like manner to the care of Muhammad-bin-Khalfan. Kais, too, left the fort of el- Matrah, placing it in charge of the el-Haddan. When the people had regained confidence and all dis turbances had ceased. Sultan came from Barkah on one of his usual visits to Maskat, and Muhammad-bin-'Abdallah, esh-Shdkasy, who held the Eastern fort for the Imam Said, went to see him. As he was about to leave. Sultan said to him very angrily : ' If you value your life, surrender the fort to me.' He replied : ' Let me go back first and remove my men therefrom;' to which Sultan answered, 'presently, presently!' Then after having him bound he bade him fol low him. On reaching the house of the sheikh Muhammad- bin-Ghalum, Sultan's followers by his orders made him stand up and call to his men to come out of the fort, which they did, and Sultan took possession of it, placing in it the Ma- wala of the el-Jibur, whose commander was Muhaisin-bin- Said, ez-Zahily, the Mania of the el-Jibur. Then Sultan wrote to Kais thus:—' I have taken the Eastern fort for you; therefore restrain our brother Said from attempting to interfere with Maskat.' Kais was greatly delighted at this ; Muhammad-bin-Khalfan also pretended outwardly to be acting as governor on behalf of Sultan, but inwardly he felt very differently, and both parties were secretly intent on overreaching one another. At this time Muhammad began to repair the Western fort, to add guns to its armament, and to increase its ammunition, lead, and other stores. He also sent for Khasif-bin-Matar, el Hinay, who joined him with a hundred of his uncle's men of the Benu-Hinah. Thesesultan-bin-el-imam-abmeu. 221 he invested with robes and treated most liberally, and then placed them in the Western fort, with Khasif-bin-Matar as their commandant. He also purchased a number of Zanj and Nubian slaves, dressed them in fine clothes and armed them with swords and daggers, until at length Sultan began to suspect him; nevertheless, he kept his apprehensions to himself, and did not disclose his suspicions to any one. Then, on a certain day. Sultan went from Maskat to Barkah, taking with him one hundred Arabs of the Al- Wahibah, whose Amir was Muhammad-bin-Hamed, el- Wahiby, and remained there several days. He returned to Maskat by ship, bringing with him the Al-Wahibah and also 13edr, his brother SeiPs son. On entering the Eastern fort by the east gate overlooking the Bahr-Mughibb he gave out that he was attacked with small-pox, and a rumour to that effect soon spread throughout the country. When Muhammad-bin-Khalfun heard of it he went with Khalfan his father and 'Aly his brother to pay Sultan a visit. On approaching the Island they were met by Majid, another brother, who seized Muhammad by the hand and warned him against going to see Sultan, assuring him that the re port of his having the small-pox was merely a stratagem on Sultan's part to seize the fort from him ; reminding him at the same time of his conduct towards the esh-Shakasy. 'You know, moreover,^ said he, 'that some nights ago he came from Barkah, accompanied by Muhammad-bin- Khalfan, el-Muh&amp;ll, and both hid themselves near the steps leading to the Western fort, and were dislodged by the watchman, who hurled a large stone at them, which induced them to return to Barkah.Muhammad, however, would not be advised, and on entering the Eastern fort the party found Sultan quite well, standing in the court surrounded by his Bedu and Hadhr, which caused Muhammad some apprehension. On rising to leave. Sultan said : ' As to you, father Khalfan, you are free to depart, but your sous.2?,2 the imams of 'oman. Muhammad and 'Aly, must remain here.' ' What do you mean ?' said Khalfan. ' The Western fort,' was the reply. Then Sultan ordered Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, el-Muhall, to seize Muhammad-bin-Khalfan and confine him in the fort prison. Thereupon Khalfan-bin-Muhammad left the fort in a great rage, calling out to all whom he met on the road, 'Muhammad is seized! Muhammad is seized!' Sultan did not bind 'Aly-bin-Khalfan, and subsequently allowed him to return to his father. When Majid-bin-Khalfan heard of his brother's imprisonment, he and Khasif-bin- Matar, el-Hinay, rushed to the market-place and carried off a quantity of liquid butter, sesame-oil and corn, to the fort, on which they hoisted the war-flag. Maskat was now thrown into the greatest confusion, the merchants closed then- shops, and the dagger of fear entered the hearts of all. Then Sultan sent a messenger to my father, Muhammad- bin-Kazik, ordering him to pull down the magazines which Muhammad-bin-Khalfan had built at Maskat, wherein a\cic stored arms, etc. He also directed him to order the ships to open fire upon the Western fort and to raze it to the ground—showing thereby that he was mad with rage against Muhammad-bin-Khalfan. Thereupon my father placed strong locks on the magazines, and went to Sultan and addressed him as follows : ' My lord, be gracious, for you are of a kindly disposition. I have searched in the government records to discover whether they contained any houses or magazines entered in the name of Muliammad- bin-Khalfan, but I found none; all the magazines are en tered as belonging to the Beit-el-Mal, and the Beit-el-Mal is now yours, for Muhammad was only one of your Wilis, and as you have taken what was placed in his charge, all now belongs to you. Would you, therefore, have me de stroy your property ? To do so would be to act like those spoken of in God's holy book : f They destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands ol the believers.sultan-bin-el-imam-ahmed. 223 Attend to this^ ye people of intelligence/ 1 Then, again, as to the proposed attack on the fort by the shipping, the attempt would be vain, for the fort is far above the ships and their fire would not be effective; whereas were the fort to open fire upon the ships it would shiver them to atoms.' Seeing that Sultan was convinced by this reason ing, my father handed him the keys of the magazines, but Sultan bade him retain them and told him that he was at liberty to leave. My father, however, begged him to allow him to see Muhammad-bin-Khalfan first, hoping that he might be able to induce him to surrender the fort. To this Sultan consented and told my father—who carried his ink stand in his girdle—how to advise and what conditions to propose to Muhammad. My father found the latter un bound, and began at once to urge him to surrender the fort; but Muhammad was obstinate and said, 'let him do what he likes with me.' My father pointed out the absurdity of such a resolve, and assured him that unless he accepted the prof fered conditions he could never hope for liberty. Muham mad finally yielded, and wrote a letter to Khasif-bin-Matar, el-Hinay, to surrender the fort to Sultan; but when my father delivered the letter, Khasif refused to act upon it, saying, ' paper and ink shall not make me give up the fortwhereupon my father went to Khalfan-bin-Muham- mad and informed him of all that had transpired. Then Khalfan proceeded to the fort and brought out his son Majid and roundly abused Khasif for his contumacy. The latter replied : ' If he wants his fort, let him come to me himself; for unless he does so I shall not quit it.' Contention ensued for some time on this subject between Sultan and Khasif, but eventually a reconciliation was effected through the in tervention of the sheikh Majid-bin-Said, er-Eiwany, on these terms :—' Khasif-bin-Matar was to be allowed to carry away all the arms, dates, and rice that he pleased. 1 Kuran, SHrat-el-Ilashr, (lix.) 2.224 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. He accordingly did so, Sultan thoroupon taking possession of the Western fort and releasing Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, who went forthwith to the Beit-el-Falj and garrisoned it with fifty men of the Benn-Hina, under Khasif-bin-M{itar. Sultan then appointed Khalfan-bin-Nasir, el-Bil-Saidy, Wali of Maskat, having ordered him the day before, which was the day on which the Western fort had been made over to him, to destroy the fort of el-Matrah, which was at that time under the authority of his. Sultan's, brother, Kais-bin-el- Imam, as already related. Khalfan-bin-Nasir accordingly went thither and threw up a breastwork from the wall of the Luwatiyah to the sweetmeat market, and placed scouts, patrols, and guns in edh-Dhit, which is behind el-Mdtrah and facing the fort. About midnight the roar of the cannon was like thunder, and the firing was kept up night and day. On the twelfth day, the el-Haddan who held the fort on behalf of Kais surrendered to Sultan. Next, Sultan ordered Khalfan-bin-Nasir to attack the Beit-el-Falj, which he did, but the shot from his guns did not produce any effect, some being fired too high and others' too low. Peace was even tually concluded on Muhammad-bin-Khalfan agreeing to surrender all the guns which were in the Beit. When these were given up Sultan ordered them to be taken to el- Mat rah. Then Sultan ordered Khalfan-bin-Nasir to build a castle on the edge of the Tawy-er-Rawiyah, and a square tower on the summit of the'Akabat-en-Naashy, opposite er-Rawiyah, and another on the top of the 'Akabah above my father's house. These three defences were completed in six months. At this time Muhammad-bin-Khalfan entered into corre spondence with Kais, the Imam's son, instigating him to make war upon his brother Sultan. One of his letters was written in poetry. It resulted in a league between Muham mad-bin-Khalfan and Kais and Said, the sons of the Imam [Ahmed], to attack Sultan. Kais accordingly collected a largesultan-bin-el-imam-ahmed. 225 force from ezh-Zliahirah and el-Batinah, and among them a body of the el-'Affar, who feed on dead bodies, just as other people eat dates. Kais is said to have assembled as many as sixty thousand men, and was also joined by his brother Said and his followers. On hearing of these proceedings. Sultan sent letters to the people of ^Oman, and to the esh-Sharkiy- yah, the Bedu of Jaalan, and to other parts, calling upon all who bore arms to come to his assistance. Much to his annoy ance none came, with the exception of the sheikh Majid-bin- Said, er-Riwany, accompanied by one hundred men. In the meantime Kais and Said moved with their forces and halted at el-Karm, and Sultan had issued orders that fires should be lighted at night on the tops of all the mountains, from those of Riwa as far as those of Dar-Sit. This stratasrem was so far successful that it led Kais and Said^s army to believe that Sultan had a large force with him, whereas he had only Majid-bin-Said J s men and a few others, in addition to those who fed the fires with oil, cotton and wood. Then Sultan wrote to his brother Kais, saying: ' When this letter reaches you, march with your force to the town of Badbad, and halt there till 1 come, and I will put you in possession of the forts of Badbad and Semail; but beware of attacking Maskat.' Kais, relying on Sultan's promise, marched accordingly to Badbad, while Sultan went by way of the Wadi-Hatat to Semail. On reaching it, he ordered the people to take up arms against Kais and Said, and directed the garrison of the fort of Badbad to fire upon them with their guns. As provisions for their army began to fail, and they saw no prospect of prevailing against Sultan, Kais and Said retired from Badbad, the former going to Sohar and the latter to er-Rastak, with their respective followers. Thus hostilities were suspended for a time, but rancour still dwelt in the breasts of all parties. Subsequently the people of'Oman and the esh-Sharkiyyah, the Bedu and those of Jaalan, together with all the otherTHE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. districts, recognized Sultan, So that a clear horizon now opened before him. Then, on a certain day, he went to Nezwa and ordered Suwailim-bin-Suleiman and Muhammad- bin-^Isa, en-Niry, to proceed to el-Matrah, and there to lie in wait for Khasif-bin-Matar, el-Hinuy,—between whom and Muhammad-bin-'Isa there was an old grudge,—to seize him when he descended from el-Falj on business, to send him bound to Maskat, to imprison him in the Western fort, and to keep him there without food or water till he died, then to place his body in a boat and to throw it into the sea a long distance from land. The plot succeeded, for, on hearing that Sultan had gone to 'Oman, Khasif left el-Falj for el- Matrah, with an escort of twelve men only. On the way he was seized by the ambuscade and carried off to Maskat, where he fell a victim to the fate which had been prepared for him, greatly to the delight of Saltan. Saltan went next to es-Suwaik, 1 which was then in the hands of his brother Sjud-bin-el-Imam, and captured it, and from him he also took el-Masnaah. (At this time a recon ciliation was effected betwixt Sultan and Muhammad-bin- Khalfan.) His next conquest was Shahbar, 2 of Mekran; after which he attacked el-Kusum [Kishm], and reduced it. Then, after a reconciliation was effected betwixt him and the Benu- Main, the people of el-Kasum, he attacked it again; he also attacked Hormuz, the port of which island belonged to Mullah Hasan, el-Mainy, and took both places. These suc cesses increased his renown and whetted his thirst for conquest. Afterwards he attacked and conquered the island of el- 1 Suwaik is, next to Sohar, the largest place on the east coast of 'Oman, northward of Mdskat.

Bahrein and appointed Seif-bin-^Aly-bin-Muhamraad, el-Bii- Saidy, to rule over it, subsequently removing him and making his son, Salim-bin-Sultan, Wali there in his stead. Salim being young, he associated the sheikh Muhammad-bin- Khalf, esh-Shiay, with him in the administration, commit ting to the latter full powers to settle the disputes which existed between the el-'Uttub and the esh-Shiaah. 1 The el- ^Uttub, however, disregarding their treaty with Sultan, assembled in force against Salim, who at that time resided at the castle of 'Arad/ with a small garrison, and closely besieged him. Salim capitulated, on condition that esh- Shtay and all his other dependents should be permitted to leave el-Bahrein with their arms, etc. Salim, accordingly, together with Muhammad-bin-Khalf, esh-Shiay, and Su- wailim, and all* their followers returned to Maskat, where upon the island of el-Bahrein again reverted to the el- ^Uttub, who forthwith fell upon the el-Baharinah, 3 seized their property, killed a great many of them, obliged num bers to Hee to other countries, and treated those who still remained in the island with every species of outrage and indignity. 1 Owing probably to the repeated occupation of the island by the Persians the bulk of the population of el-Bahrein, consisting of the de- scendanta of the aboriginal inhabitants, are mostly Shia'ahs ; their in vaders and masters, the el-'L'ttiib, are Sunnis. According to native tradition, as reported by the late Colonel Taylor, the el-'Uttub consist of three Arab tribes, united by intermarriage, who settled originally near Kuweit, or Grane, at the north-western extremity of the Persian Clulf, namely, ' the Beni Sabah, under Shaikh Sulaiman bin Ahmed the Beni Yalahimah, under Shaikh Jabir bin I'ttoobee; and the Beni Khalifah, under Shaikh Khalifah bin Mahomed.' Their first conquest of el-Bahrein was effected A.n. 1779. See Bombay Government /Selec tions, No. xxiv. p. 27. The Khalifah branch of the confederation gra dually acquired the ascendancy over the other two, and have maintained it with varying success, under the frequent political changes which the island has undergone, since that period. 2 Called 'Arada at p. 182. 3 That is, the people of el-Bahrein as distinguished from their invaders the el-'Uttub.228 THE IMAMS OK 'OMAN. About this time the Benu-Naim invaded Sohar and en camped at el-'Anhy, killing many of the people. There upon Kais wrote to his brother Sultan urging him to hasten to his assistance. Sultan accordingly raised levies from 'Oman, from the esh-Sharkiyyah, from the Bedu and Jaalan, and from all the other districts bound to furnish contingents. He was also joined by his brother Said-bin-el-Imam, by Seif- bin-'Aly-bin-Muhammp-d, and others. When Sultan reached Sohar with his army, Kais wrote a letter to the Benu-Naim and sent them a present of money; but they refused any such compromise. He had assembled a considerable army, includinjr about five hundred men of ezh-Zhahirah and some from Y^nkal and es-Salif, and it was arranged that he and Sultan should fall upon the Benu-Naim with their re spective forces, and thatSeif-bin-'Aly-bin-Muhammad should command the cavalry. In the mean time the Benu-Naim had been reinforced by the Benu-Kutb and by some ot the Benu-Yas, the people of Dabai, 1 under their Amir Hazzaa. The two armies met at ed-Dabbagh and there was a severe battle between them,but the Benu-Naim were utterly routed, with the loss, it is said, of three hundred men; the Seyyids' side losing only a third of that number. The Benu-Naim fled as far as the Wadi-el-Jazy, where they halted to await the arrival of the ezh-Zhawahir, who had fought with the Seyyids, the sons of the Imam, against them. The ezh- Zhawahir, thinking that none of the enemy had escaped, left Sohar for el-Jau, but on reaching the AVadi-el-Jazy the Benu-Naim, who lay in ambush, rushed upon them. A 1 Dabai, a port in the Benu-Yas territory, situated on the banks of a backwater, in lat. 25° 16' 26' N., long. 55° 24' 42' E., and inhabited by between seven and eight hundred of the Bu Falasah, a branch of the Benu-Yas, who seceded from the main body about a.d . 1834, and have retained their independence under sheikhs of their own tribe ever since. This place must not be confounded with the Daba op the eastern coast of 'Oman, which is mentioned on the next page, and for the position of which see note 1, p. 24.sultan-bin-el-imam-ahmed. 220 conflict ensued, which resulted in the overthrow of the ezh- Zhawahir and their allies, and the loss of three hundred men killed. This incident gave rise to a war between the two tribes which lasted a long time befoi'e they were reconciled. Subsequently, the Al-Walubah invaded the territory of the Benu-Naim as far as Kabil and killed many of them. Then Sultan attacked Daba by sea, and slew many of the Nakbiyyin and the esh-Sharkiyym. a.h . 1214 [ a .n. 1799] the ed-Duruwwa 1 infested and plun dered on the roads. Sultan attacked them at Salkh and forced them into submission. Then Sultan began to build the fort of el-Fulaij, and when it was completed he placed some of his harim there, and made it his principal residence. After the death of Khalfan- bin-Nasir, el-Bu-Saidy, he first made Seif-bin-Mis'ud, el-Bfl- Saidy, Wali of Maskat, but subsequently removed him to Behla, and gave the Maskat appointment to Suleiman-bin- Seif-bin-Said, ez-Zamily, el-Maily, but soon after deposed him and made Majid-bin-Muhammad, the Wakil, the el-Bii- Saidy, Wali in his stead. Shortly after he appointed the latter over Sur, and Jaalan, and the esh-Sharkiyyah, and placed Seif-bin-Muhammad over Maskat. Him he sub sequently removed, and gave the office successively to Khasif-bin-Khamis-bin-Hamduh, el-\Vahiby, 2 to Khaluf the Maula 3 of the Benu-Hinah, to Seif-bin-Hanzhal, el-Bu-Saidy, and then again to Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-BA-Saidy. Then a book arrived from 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, the ^ ahhaby, in which all the governors of 'Oman and their subjects were 1 The ed Duruwwa 1 are settled near Jebel-el -Akhdar, and are esti mated at 20,000 effective men. 2 The Al-Wahibah are one of the finest tribes of Oman ; see note, p. 120.

The book began thus:—In the name of God, the merciful, the compas sionate ! This is the book of the Solution of Difficulties? written by the sheikh Muhammad-bin-^Abdu-^l-Wahhab. May God grant him the highest reward, and admit him into heaven without bringing him to account.' The treatise contained a mass of incoherent sentences quite inconsistent with the truth, and no one took any notice of it. Never theless, 'Abdu-T-'Aziz sent el-Harik, one of his Nubian slaves, to 'Oman with a force of seven hundred cavalry, and he waged war upon the Benu-Yas until they submitted to him. He then attacked the Benu-Naim and Kutb, in con junction with the Benu-Yas, and reduced them also. More over, the ezh-Zhawahir and the esh-Shawamis, and all the Hadhr of ezh-Zhahirah eventually yielded to him. He took up his residence at Tawwam, and levied whatever amouut of Zakdh he chose from the people. He also began to make incursions into el-Batinah, and entered into an alliance with the el-'Uttub, who also became converts to the religion of the Tauhih* and thereupon commenced committing out rages upon the sea, seizing every ship that fell in their way. Then a dispute arose between Sultan -bin-el-Imam-Ahmed and Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, esh-Shakily, el-Ghafiry, respecting the heritage of Nasir's daughter, Hamid-bin- Nasir's sister, who was wife to Sultan,' 5 and on whose death 1 The original Arabic title is Kashf-esh-ShulhAt.

Hamid, more over, refused to see Sultan; whereupon the latter determined to attack him. On making inquiries, however, respecting the fort at Yabrin he was informed that it was impregnable; and, further, that it was defended by a wonderful brass gun of such and such dimensions. Thereupon Sultan ordered Ahmed-bin-Yusif-bin-Musa, esh-Shiay, the brasier, to find out some way of destroying the said gun. Ahmed accord ingly went to Nezvva, where he abode some time making pots and cauldrons for boiling the juice of the sugar-cane. Hearing of this Hamid-bin-Nasir wrote to 'Aly-bin-Talib, el-Bu-Saidy, the Wali of Nezwa, to send Ahmed to Yabrin to make a cauldron of the same kind for him. When he arrived, Hamid gave him a piece of brass which he took out of the fort for the purpose; but Ahmed objecting that it was not suitable Hamid bade him remain at Yabrin while he went to el-^Ainein to procure some better metal. In the mean time Ahmed began to watch for an opportunity to damage the gun. It so happened that the crier of Yabrin proclaimed; 'Away to your comrades the Benu-Shakil, for hostilities have broken out between them and the Benu- Hinah!' Accordingly, all Hamid^s levies departed, and none remained at Yabrin but his own personal followers, who garrisoned the fort. Ahmed forthwith availed himself of the occasion to accomplish his task : he first dismounted the gun, then kindled a fire about it, and finally broke its neck. Leaving his tools behind him, he fled with his appren tices to Nezwa, and from thence went to Maskat, where he was welcomed and amply rewarded by Sultan. On Hamid^s return to Yabrin the garrison of the fort informed him of all that Ahmed the brasier had done. War was the marriage of Ahmed-bin-Sa'id's daughter with Xasir-bin-Mu- hamniad, el-Gh&amp;firy.232 the imams of 'oman. in consequence broke out between Hamid-bin-Nasir and Sultan, and the people of Behla and Nezwa ;—Sultan's \V ali over the former place at that time being Seif-bin-Mas'ud, el-BO-Saidy, as already stated. Frequent raids and attacks followed, and many were slain on both sides. 1 he Nizariy- yah and their confederates the people of el-Hamra, those of the Jebel [Riyam ?] and Saifam, as also of ezh-Zhahirah took part with Hamid; the el-Kutb were opposed to him. One day Seif-bin-Mas^ud went with the people of Behla to destroy the watercourse at Yabrin, and a fight took place between them and the people of Yabrin, in which the Wali Seif-bin-Mas'Ad was wounded with a musket-shot. He returned with his men to Behla and died three days after. In the year 1218 [ a .d . 1803] Sultan resolved on perform ing the Hijj, taking with him a number of the notables of ^Oman, such as the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Matar, esh- Sharky, the Sahib of el-Fujairah, and Muhenna-bin-Mu- hammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, and the sheikh Rabiaah- bin-Ahmed, er-Ruwahy, and others. A few days after their departure, Bedr-bin-Seif-bin-el-Imam-Ahmed 1 started from Habra and came to Maskat, entering it by night with a few men, and he and Majid-bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, the Wakil, agreed to seize the Eastern fort, the garrison of which Sultan had left in the charge of a slave named Kilmbu, a manumit of Seif-bin-el-Imam, Bedr's father. On the night of their arrival, Bedr and his followers had concealed themselves in the house of Majid-bin-Khalfan. Ihe night after, Bedr proceeded to the Eastern fort, taking with him Baraka-es-Sarmalah, another of Seif-bin-el-Imam s manu mitted slaves, and five other men carrying a bag con ing one thousand dollars. On reaching the gate they shouted for Kiimbu, who looking out from a window inquired who they were. Bedr replied : ' I am your 1 Sultan's nephew, the son of his brother Seif who died at Lanui. See p. 205.SULTAN-BIN-EL-IMAM-AHMED, 233 master Bedr-bin-Seif-bin-el-Imara-Ahmed-bin-Said ; open the door, and let me and my companions in; if you do, I shall leave you in your present appointment. Meanwhile, accept from me this trifle.' Kumbu inquired what it was, and on being told that it consisted of a bag of dollars he caused a basket to be let down and hauled it in. That done, he said to Bedr : ' Return whence you came ; if you do not, I will fire upon youand then commenced throwing stones at him. When Bedr informed Mujid-bin-Khalfan of what had taken place, the latter advised him not to remain in Maskat. Bedr and his companions accordingly left for Habra, where they remained a few days and then started for Nejd. On reaching ^Ajman, the demesne of Rashid-bin- Hamld, en-Naimy, the latter entertained him and his three companions courteously. Some days after, Bedr departed from 'Ajman to ed-Dir^iyyah 1 , where he joined 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, the Imam of the Wahhabis, 2 and took up his abode with him. The morning after Bedr's visit to the fort, Kumbu went to Seif-bin-Handzal, el-Bu-Saidy, whom Sultan on his de parture for the Hijj had left Wali over Maskat, informed 1 Ed-Dir'iyyah, the capital of the 'Wahhabis under Su'ud the First, is situated a little to the north-west of Riyadh, the modem capital. It was destroyed by the Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha, after a siege of five months, a.d. 1817, when 'Abdallah, the son of Su'ud the Second, surrendered himself, and was eventually sent to Constantinople, where he was beheaded. ' The ruins of an enormous palace, and of a scarce less enormous mosque at Derey'eeah, even now remain to attest the magnificence of the monarch who reared them, and the old capital dis plays, amidst all its desolation, traces of much greater regularity and ornament than Riad can boast.' Palgrave's Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. ii. p. 39. 3 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz succeeded his father Muhammad-ibn-Su'ud, the first political and religious head of the Wahhabis. He is here styled Imam, though according to Palgrave that title is seldom given to the existing ^Vahhaby sovereigns. He says: ' In Nejed, Feysul is sometimes, but very rarely, denominated Imam by his subjects, and I have heard the same word applied twico or thrice to his heir 'Abd-Allah.' Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. ii. p. 285. so234 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. him of what had occurred during the night, and delivered to him the bag which Bedr had given to him. ' As to the bag,' said Seif, 'keep it until your master's return from his journey, and moreover do not disclose the matter to any one. Return to the fort, and be on your guard against all such stratagems and tricks.' After dismissing Kumbu, Seif sent for Baraka-es-S^rmalah, whom he ordered to be bound in the Western fort and starved to death. His body was then cast into the sea. Meanwhile Majid-bin-Khalfun was in great dread of Sultan's arrival. On the return of the latter from the Hijj, and being informed how Majid had been im plicated in the attempt upon the fort, he caused him to be bound, but released him in the course of a few days. On being told that his nephew Bedr had gone to ed-Dir'iy- yah. Sultan remarked, ' Had he remained at Habra, or in any other part of 'Oman, I would have forgiven him. His presence at ed-Dir'iyyah bodes no good to us from the people of the el-Gharb.' 1 Then a party of the el-Mutaivdhhihin* of ezh-Zhahirah, togetherwith some of the Nejd horsemen, attacked es-Suwaik. Intelligence thereof reaching Sultan, who was then at Barkah, he ordered Muhammad-bin-Hamed, el-Wahiby, with his men of the Al-Wahibah, to encounter them. Hamed accordingly took a number of his uncle's men and other Arabs, mounted on camels, and hearing that the invaders had entered the Wadi-el-Haimaly he followed them as far as the centre of the valley, where the mountains closed in upon them, when they were assailed with musketry from those who were posted on the heights, and those who were in ambush below rushed out upon them, so that the Wahhabis overcame them, and only a few of their number escaped. Muhammad-bin- Hamed and several of his followers were among the slain. 1 That is, the People of the West, meaning^ the WahMbis of Nejd, which is westward of 'Oman. 2 Another plural noun formed from Wahhdb.

Mu- henna, on hearing what had taken place, advised him to write and consult all the people of 'Oman, from Jaalan to Sohar, as to the best course to be pursued. Muhenna then returned to Nakhl, and Sultan summoned all the heads of 'Oman, especially the Benu-Said. Those who answered the summons were as follows:—of the heads of the Al-Bu-Said, Ahmed-bin-el-Imam-Said, and 'Azzan-bin-Kais-bin-el- Imam, and Seif-bin-Aly-bin-Muhammad, and Muhammad- bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, and his brother Majid-bin- Khalfan; and, of his own brothers, Talib and Muhammad, sons of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said. Of the heads of 'Oman there came the sheikh Majid-bin-Said, er-Riwany, and Mu- henna-bin-Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, and the sheikh Hajjy-bin-Said, el-Hasany, and Salim-bin-'Aly, el- Temamy, and the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih, el-Harathy, el-Hashi- my, and Khadim-bin-Muhammad. On their arrival Sultan invited them into the upper room of the fort at Barkah, and when they were seated he addressed them to the following effect: ' It is known to this assembly of sheikhs and tribes how many of our people were slain in the Wadi-el-IIaimaly, since which occurrence I have been like a hand without finders. \\ ar threatens us on all sides, while those who have heretofore been friends have become our enemies, and those on whom wo relied have, under the impending difficulties, proved them selves untrustworthy. The dagger's point is at our breasts, and 1 ask your opinion of the situation.' None replying to this appeal he repeated it a second time, whereupon Seif-bin- 'Aly-bin-Muhammad, el-Bu-Saidy,answered,saying: 'Ifyou fancy that since the death of Muhammad-bin-Hamed, el- W ahiby, and his followers there are none left in 'Oman brave enough to contend against these Nejdy enemies, our opinion236 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. differs from yours; for there can be no doubt that 'Oman still possesses men who are stronger than they are, more numerous, and more indomitable in war. We are not dispirited on account of the Wahhabis, or any other possible enemies, for we have hearts in our breasts ready to encounter them, and the swords are on our shoulders with which we are ready to smite them. Blood is man's only dye, and war, like the manna and quails, is as food to us. But words are vain unless followed by deeds; therefore let the Wahhabis and their allies prepare for the overthrow which awaits them/' Here the speaker stopped, and the Al-Bu-Said having con sulted together said: 'We approve of what Seif has uttered.' The heads of 'Oman, of esh-Sharkiyyah, of el-Bediyyah and of Jaalan added : 'We shall be delighted to fight these in solent tyrants : we esteem their many as few, and the most valiant among them as cowards. The brave man scorns to be a dastard runagate, and the noble man disdains to live in subjection.' During the conference a messenger arrived from Kais with a letter to his brother Sultan, which ho delivered to him sealed. On opening and reading it Sultan said: ' My brother informs me of the advance of el-Harik on Sohar, and that he is encamped with his army at el-'Auhy. Kais asks for assistance, and urges me to hasten to him; therefore let all return at once to their homes and then join me with their respective followings. The rendezvous will be at el-Khabiirah.' They replied unanimously: ' We will do so, God willing.' The representatives then left, and Sultan with Muhammad- bin-Khalfan and Majid-bin-Khallan went to Maskat. On their arrival Sultan ordered his ship the el-lcilcilc to be made ready and laden with as large a cargo of arms, dates, and rice as she could carry; after which he himself proceeded by land and encamped at el-Khaburah, where the ship also arrived in due time and anchored to the westward of the fort. The tribes also began to join him, until the number olsultan-din-el-imam-ahmed. 237 the el-Yemeniyyah and the Nizar amounted to twelve thou sand men. Meanwhile el-Harik, the Wahhaby, remained encamped at 'Auhy, near Sohar, in ignorance of the levies which had been raised by Kais and his brother Sultan to act against him, whereas Sultan had been kept fully informed of the movements of el-Harik, Just as Sultan was about to start for Sohar from el-Khaburah, a letter reached him from his brother Kais apprising him that as soon as el-Harik heard of the preparations which were being made against him he left 'Auhy by night, setting fire to his tents, and returned to el-Bereimy. Thereupon Sultan dismissed his forces and returned to Maskat, and el-Harik, after staying a few days at el-Bereimy, started for Nejd. When the el- 'Uttflb heard of the departure of the latter they made peace with Sultan and withdrew their allegiance from ^Abdu-^l-^Aziz, and those of their number who had resided at ez-Zubarah 1 left that place and became inhabitants of el-Bahrein. A reconciliation was also effected between Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, and Sultan-bin-el-Imam, so that revolts were quelled and troubles passed away. (In fine, the achievements of the glorious Seyyid SuMn- bin-el-Imam-Ahmed-bin-Said were most renowned, and his rule over the people was most auspicious. In proof of this we may state that no drought occurred in 'Oman during the whole term of his administration; on the contrary, its pro duce increased to a surprising extent, more especially in 1213 [ a.d . 1798]. At Maskat, in that year, the water nearly drowned the people who resided on the level ground near the lesser gate of the wall, the flood reaching as far as the Talciyyah. The water also from the great, middle, and small 1 Ez Zubarah, once a large town, now in ruins, situated in a deep bay in the district of Kdtar—which formed part of the ancient el-Bah rein on the mainland—to the eastward of the island which has since been called by that name.

After the sixty days the sun shone, and the inhabitants went to their respective avocations in the market.) In the year 1219 [ a.d . 1804] Sultan determined to go in person to el-Basrah to receive the Kanun from the inhabi tants of that place, which had been paid since the time of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said. He embarked on board his ship the Jinjawdr, leaving Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-Bu-Saidy, Wali over Maskat. On reaching el-Basrah he was received with the greatest respect by the notables there, who renewed their obligations of obedience and submission, and paid him the usual Kunun, which, as just stated, the inhabitants ot el-Basrah had always paid since the reign of the Imam Ahmed. After remaining there a few days he re-embarked and arrived off Linjah, 1 where he got into his yacht called el-Badry, with only a few of his slaves and followers, his object being to go through the straits to the Bunder [el- 'Abbas ?] and Hurmuz, the ship being ordered to remain near el-Kiisum, [Kishm], until he rejoined her. Near Linjah 1 Linjah is situated in lat. 26° 32' 50' N., long. 54° 59' 10' E., on the southern coast of Persia, just outside the western entrance into ' Cla rence's Strait,' separating the mainland from the island of Kishm, It is a large and flourishing town, with a tolerable anchorage, and carries on considerable trade with India and most parts of Arabia, Mr. Palgrave gives a detailed and interesting account of the place and its motley popu lation in his Travels (vol. ii, pp. 288-296), but I am surprised to And that he describes it as being under a governor appointed by the ruler of 'Oman, of which state he seems to consider it a dependency, subject to certain tributary dues payable to Persia. It seems probable from our author's narrative that during the Imamate of Sa'id-ibn-Ahmed and the contemporaneous regency of the Seyyid Sultan, who became master of Kishm and Hormuz, that Linjah also was within his jurisdiction ; but for many years past, and certainly up to 1854, it was held by the .lowa- sim Arabs, under a local chief named sheikh ' Khalifah-bin-Guzib.'

The encounter took place at midnight, the boats of the esh-Shuaihiyyin being crowded with men, whereas Sultanas boat, the el-Badry, carried as already stated only a few of his slaves and freemen. The esh-Shuaihiyyin hailed the crew of the el-Badry and asked what boat it was. Sultan replied : ' It belongs to Sultan- bin-el-Imam, who himself answers you.' The latter words were meant as a defiance, and implied further, ' who will smite you with the sword, and will not suffer the wounded to escape.' They retorted : 'We are in search of Sultan.' He answered: ' Then furl your sails, and, God willing, we shall fight at dawn.' They did so, and he ordered the men on board the el-Badry to do the same. Then some of his followers advised Sultan to get into the yacht's boat and let them row him to the ship. He replied : ' God forbid that I should leave my men in the hour of danger !' At dawn, and after Sultan and his followers had recited the appointed prayer, he directed the crew to move the yacht close to the enemy's boats, whereupon a fierce conflict ensued, the esh- Shuaihiyyin hurling javelins and long arrows at him, which he parried with his sword, roaring at them all the time like a lion.

On hearing the wailings for him on board of the el-Badry the enemy attacked the vessel and plundered it, but spared the lives of the crew, so that Sultan was the only one killed. The esh-Shuaihiyyin then returned to their country, while some of Sultan's followers made their way to Linjah and informed his friends there of all that had taken place, which distressed them greatly. Then they placed the body of Sultan in a coffin and buried him there. When the crew of the ship were apprised of this sad affair by the people of el-Kasum they could scarcely discriminate between their sorrow and their anger; but they said, as all in trouble should say, 'We are God s, and to Him we must return.' The ship then sailed for Maskat, but the el-Badry arrived there before her. During the voyage of the latter, while passing Barkah, one of Sultan's slaves swam to land and went straight to el-Fulaij to communicate the intelligence to the Seyyids. Those present on the occasion were, the Seyyidah, the daughter of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, and the two Seyyids, Salim and Said, the sons of Sultan, who had quitted Maskat with some of their harim after the death of Seif-bin-Muhammad, el-Bu-Saidy, the Wali, who died a few days before the news arrived of the death of Sultan, and after appointing the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir to succeed him. The Seyyids started the same night for Maskat and arrived there the following morning. When the intelligence of Sultan's death was known in the town the whole popu lation was convulsed with sadness, and when it reached 'Oman the sorrow became universal. The death of the renowned Seyyid Sultan -bm-el-Imam took place near Linjah, a little before dawn, on Thursday, the 13th of Shaaban, a.h . 1219, [20th November, 1804.] Many poets wrote eulogies of him, most of which are very long.31 salim-bin-sultan. 241 List of the male children severally left by the Seyyids of the Al-BO-Said family :— The glorious Ahmed-bin-Sa'id left 1.

SEYYID SALIM-BIN-SULTAN. 2 On the death of the Seyyid Sultan, when the kingdom fell to his son Said, he and his brother Salim became greatly attached to each other—an attachment which was unin terrupted until the death of Salim. The Seyyid Salim was remarkable for his courtesy, libe rality and integrity, not only abstaining from wrong, but doing what was right. He was strict in observing the stated times of prayer, dispensed the obligatory Zaltah to the poor and needy, besides giving largely of his own free will. He was a lover of the devout and pious, was fond of associating 1 Talib, reckoned the sixth of Ahmed's sons by the author at p. 188, is omitted here. lie is mentioned, however, a few lines farther down, as having died childless. 2 The following biography of S^lim, Sultan's eldest son, who appears to have ruled conjointly with his younger brother Sa'id, after their father's death, is evidently inserted here in order to keep the subse quent account of Sa'id's reign more distinct.242 the imams of 'oman. with literary men, was bountiful towards Muslims of merit, listened patiently to the unfortunate, and by his urbanity placed all his associates on an equality with himself. In fine weather, when he resided at Maskat, he used to fre quent the mdsjid, called the Masjid of the Wakil, before early dawn. (The Wakil who built it in the year a.h . 1182 [a.d . 1768] was the seyyid Khalfan-bin-Muhammad-bin- 'Abdallah, el-Bu-Saidy.) There the Seyyid Salim would offer up the usual prayers, and then follow them up by other sup plications until the Muedz-dzin announced the prayer of el- Fajr, when he took his place behind the learned and pious sheikh, Abu-Zuhair-Muhenna-bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, el-Bii-Saldy, in company with the other Muslims. 1 After wards he would read a portion of the gracious Kuran, until the sheikh prayed the Prayer of edh-I)hdha, and then return home. If his brother Said happened to be at Miiskat, he would then go out with him; if not, he used to take a walk in the building near the Island, where his father Sultan used to promenade. Such was his ordinary mode of life. There was always some learned FaJcih 2 or famous poet present at his receptions. He committed to memory the poetry of the Arabs before and after the times of Islam, studying diligently the histories of Arabian and foreign dynasties, insomuch that he was quite familiar with their policy and the events of their reign. He often sat up a great part of the night discussing with the learned such topics as the rules of poetry and rhetoric, the comparative sciences, and other subjects in which he took an interest. And if, on any of these occasions, reflections were made upon the dead, he used to say, personifying the departed :— 1 It is clear from this incidental statement that the Seyyid SsUim, though regent and virtually sovereign of the country, did not perform the religious functions of Imjlm. It should be borne in mind that the Imftm Sa'id-bin-Ahmed was still alive at er-Rast&amp;k. * A jurisconsult.

Arah., pp. 203-208.salim-b1n-sdltan. 243 ' We were men as you are, but we are changed ; Another age, and you as we are shall be.' He was very assiduous in all matters connected with the administration, very determined in purpose, and at the same time most discriminating and impartial, regarding all as equal before the law, so much so, that one whose lustre is well known used to say of him: 'He is not a human being, but a beneficent angel.' He destroyed the sources of oppression, and by his uprightness put an end to the evil- doings of malefactors. At night-fall he used to go forth disguised, and walked about for two or three hours, accom panied by a number of his officers and slaves, and if he caught any one transgressing he had him punished according to law. The good esteemed him for such conduct, the evil- disposed hated him, and the malevolent found fault with his leniency. Tales of ancient or modern warfare had a great charm for him; he listened with rapture to accounts of the victories gained by the faithful over unbelievers, and was saddened whenever the unbelievers prevailed against the faithful—the triumph of tyrants and hypocrites over the right, as sanctioned by the religion of the protecting Creator, piercing his heart like a dagger. He carefully selected as counsellors a number of eminent men from among the Muslim community. Of these were : the learned seyyid Muhenna-bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad; the sheikh Khamis-bin-Salim,el-Hashimy; the devout sheikh Seif-bin-Said, el Mauly, el-Wadamy; the sheikh the Kadhi Abu-^l-A'hwal-Salim-bin-Muhammad, ed-Darmaky, and his son the sheikh, the Fakih, Hamid-bin-Salim; the learned but blind sheikh Thunayyan-bin-Nasir-bin-Khalf, ez-Zamily; the eloquent sheikh Hamad-bin-Muhammad-bin-Salim, el- Bast, and many other renowned men. I was present on one occasion at his honourable assembly, when I saw him sur rounded by a number of the sheikhs : I saluted them and was saluted in return, and then sat down. The conversa-244 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. tion turned on the subject of the Wahhabis of Nejd, who charged with Tashrtlc 1 those of the Muslims who dissented 1 Tashrlk, literally, ascribing a Companion or Companions (to God); polytheism. This charge was based on the excessive reverence which Muslims in general had long been in the habit of paying, not only to Muhammad, but to departed Sheikhs, Wdlis, Fakirs, etc.,—a veneration altogether inconsistent with the religious theory embodied in the Kuran, and more especially with the fundamental formula of Islam, ' there is no god but God.' Mr. Palgrave, in one of the most splendid passages of his work, shows how much beyond their literal import is implied by these words—' Their full sense is, not only to deny absolutely and un reservedly all plurality whether of nature or of person in the Supreme Being, not only to establish the unity of the Unbegetting and Unbegot, in all its simple and incommunicable Oneness, but besides this the words, in Arabic and among Arabs, imply that this one Supreme Being is also the only Agent, the only Force, the only Act existing throughout the universe, and leave to all beings else, matter or spirit, instinct or intel ligence, physical or moral, nothing but pure unconditional passiveness, alike in movement or quiescence, in action or in capacity. The sole power, the sole motor, movement, energy, and deed, is God ; the rest is downright inertia and mere instrumentality, from the highest archangel down to the simplest atom of creation. Hence, in this one sentence,' I^a Hah illah Alluh,' is summed up a system, which for want of abetter name may be called the Pantheism of Force, or of Act, thus exclusively assigned to God, Who absorbs it all, exercises it all, and to Whom alone it can be ascribed, whether for preserving or destroying, for relative evil or for equally relative good....Such is the pervading idea, the central figure, the master or mother thought, in brief, the keystone of Islam, as Mahomet conceived it, and as the Wahhabee understood it. Later doctrines and schools, introducing now free will, now merit, now hierarchical institutions and mutual dependence of man on man, now devising intercessors and mediators, living or dead, selecting holy places, honouring saints and tombs, forming ascetic brotherhoods and darweesh associations, were by the Wahhabee recognised henceforth in their true light, from this point of view, as innovations, corruptions, and distortions of the great and simple vision of one solitary autocrat over one even mass of undistin guished and undistinguishable slaves. This deduction was eminently logical. How, in fact, can the Absolute leave room for intercessors, or the Uncommunicable admit of a hierarchy linking the creature with the Creator ? what free will can find place in a passive automaton ? or what meaning can be attached to ascetic practices and good works when the Universal Lord and Ruler has declared that He cares not what His slaves may do, or to what he destines them ■ 1 o suppose sanctity orSALIM-BIN-SULTAN. 245 from their doctrines, whereby also they virtually legalized the murder of the Muwdhhidin, 1 the despoiling of the peo ple of the Kiblah 2 of their property, the marriage of their wives without divorce, 3 and the enslavement of their chil dren. 1 Salim listened without speaking, but after the discussion respecting the Wahhabis—those people of dark ness and tyranny—had continued a long time, he said : ' Sheikhs, I am disposed to visit the learned sheikh Mu hammad-ez-Zuwany, el-Hasay, esh-Shafay, who, as you know, has been driven from his home to our country and distinction in a creature, is an invasion of the all-absorbing rights of the Creator; and neither place nor title can avail when the beast and arch angel, heaven and hell, are all the same before the unmoved and inacces sible One. That Mahomet had thus thought and acted accordingly whenever these heretical deviations came under his notice, the son of 'Abd-el-Wahhab well knew ; and he very fairly inferred that he would have looked upon with equal abhorrence, and treated with no less rigour, the analogous corruptions and overlayings of later times.' Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. i. pp. 365, 370. The thoughtful pages from which thc«e extracts are quoted deserve to be carefully studied by all who would understand the leading doctrine of Islam, and what Muhammad- ibn-'Abdu-'l-Wahhab undertook when he formed the project of re placing this its ' neglected keystone, and with it and by it reconstruct ing the broken fabric.' Imbued with these views respecting the Unity of God, his followers were strictly consistent in charging with Tashrtk all Muslims who had adopted theories or practices incompatible therewith, notwithstanding that they denied all plurality in the Godhead by an un swerving adherence to the formula. La ildh ilia Allah. 1 Muwahhidtn, those who affirm the Unity (of God). 2 That is, Muslims, who turn towards the Kiblah, meaning Mekkah, when engaged in religious worship. 3 That is to say, without being first divorced a third time from their husbands. Such is the law of the Kuran:—' Ye may divorce your wives twice, and then either retain them with humanity or dismiss them with kindness....But if the husband divorce her a third time, she shall not be lawful to him again until she marry another husband. But if he also divorce her, it shall be no crime in them if they return to each other.' SArat-el-Bdkarah, (ii.) 229, 230. 4 All these acts were legitimate on the part of the Wahhabis, as orthodox Muslims, towards all others whom they chose to regard as Mushriktn, or Polytheists, whether Muslims, Christians, Jews, or Pagans.246 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. has become one of our people. Moreover, lie is a near neigh bour, and we must not leave it in his power to say that we neglected him, or by refraining to associate with him treated him with contempt.' Thereupon he arose and was followed by the sheikh Khamis-bin-Salim, el-Hashimy; the sheikh Seif-bin-Said, el-Mauly, el-Wadamy; the sheikh Thunayyan- bin-Nasir-bin-Khalf, ez-Zamily; the sheikh Hamid-bin-Mu- hammad, el-Bast, and others—twelve in all, myself included. The sheikh Muhammad-ez-Zuwany resided at that time in a small neat house in one of the streets of Maskat. When we knocked at the door one of his attendants came out, to whom Salim said: ' Ask the sheikh's permission for us to see him.-' The attendant did so, and returned immediately, requesting us to enter. When we had taken our seats and exchanged salutations with the host, the Seyyid Salim opened the discourse, saying: f&lt; 0 sheikh, this country has become used to you, and your renown therein is like the perfume of roses. Men of your stamp can receive no injury, for you always command respect. Recount to us, I pray you, what befell you among the followers of 'Abdu-^l-'Aziz, et-Temimy, en-Nejdy, el-Wahhaby, for many reports have reached us respecting him and his followers : how they charge with Tashrih those Muslims who eschew their doctrines, legalize the plunder of their property, and the taking their wives in marriage before they are legally divorced from their husbands, and without observing the 'Iddah. 1 More over, that they regard as unbelievers and as Mushrikin all those who reject their peculiar tenets, maintaining that 1 The ' Id dak ' is the period during which a divorced woman, or a widow, must wait before marrying again,—in either case, if pregnant, until delivery ; otherwise, the former must wait three lunar periods, or three months, and the latter four months and ten days, A woman who is divorced during a state of pregnancy, though she may make a new contract of marriage immediately after her delivery, must wait forty days longer before she can complete her marriage by receiving hei husband.'

If such is their way, it is the way of Nafi'-bin-el-Azrak, 1 and they have been taught it by their sheikh, Muhammad-ibn- 'Abdu-'l-Wahhab, the author of the book which he entitled the Solution of Difficulties. It begins, as we have ourselves seen, in this style : f In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate ! This is the book of the Solution of Diffi culties, written by the sheikh Muhammad-bin-^Abdu-'l- Wahhab; may God grant him the highest reward, and admit him into heaven without bringing him to account.' I understand that you were obliged to leave your own country of el-Hasa and take refuge at Maskat, owing- to the ill-treatment which you received at their hands. Here you enjoy comfort and security; continue to dwell here, and may future happiness cause you to forget your past mis fortunes.' The sheikh Muhammad-ez-Zuwany replied: The career of ^Abdu-'PAziz and his sect is most wonderful. When his army increased and his banners waved over them, he selected a number of unlearned men, who made great pretensions to learning, whom he styled Mutdwa'ah,' in consideration of 1 This remark seems to suggest that Muhammad-ibn-'Abdu-'l-Wah- hab was not the first to inculcate his peculiar doctrines.

Mr. Palgrave writes the word Metowwad' and MetovfwacC, and renders it ' minister—clergyman, if you will,' adding, ' the literal meaning of the Arabic word is ' one who enforces obedience,' to God, understood,' thereby givirtg the participial noun an active transitive signification, in which case, however, the English should have been written MutdmoV, or, according to his style of expressing Arabic words in the Roman alphabet, MotowwV with a kdsrah to the final syllable. I have adopted the active intransitive signification, which equally admits Mr. Palgrave's 'minister.' The original word, in the equivalent plural form of Mutdw- toatin, is used by our author at p. 203, in a part of his narrative wholly248 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. their having flattered and deceived him by sanctioning his tyranny and approving of his charging those of the people of the Kiblah with Tashrik who might call in question any thing which he had written in his book, entitled the Solu tion of Difficulties. It is a small book, consisting mostly of sophisms and conjectures. It legalizes the murder of all Muslims who dissent from them, the appropriation of their property, the enslavement of their offspring, the marriage of their wives without being first divorced from their hus bands, and without observing the 'Iddah. The actuating principle in all this was their thirst for gain, through fraud and stratagem. They listened to what tyrants taught them, but they forgot the dictum of the Almighty: ' Do not think that God is heedless of the actions of the evil doers/ 1 They reduced most of the inhabitants of el-llasa from plenty to poverty, their clothes to rags, their power to weakness, and they murdered a number of the Fakihs who opposed their doctrines, as 1 have just stated them.' The sheikh continued; 'One striking peculiarity about them is their mode of replying to those who differ from them. Should one of the latter say: 'I confess that there is no god but God, and that He has no companion, and that Muhammad is his servant and apostle/ they ask, 'What proof have you of that? , They try to distort his orthodox creed by asking him to prove that God who cre ated and sustains him is what He is, that there is none other equal to Him, and that He is the only One, the eternal, the existing, the self-existent. If they knew what argument was, they would know that there is no argument against one who confesses that God is one and eternal, with- unconnected with the Wahhabis, to designate free soldiers, or volun teers, who followed their chiefs willingly and gratuitously. According to Mr. Palgrave, the Wahhaby Mutdwa'ah 'thrive on the involuntary contributions of a people that detests them.' Cent' and hast.

Hy thus assuming tho position of thoso who ask for a proof that God is God, and that He has no companion, they have been led into error; and through their doubts respecting God and their sophistical tenets they become like beasts who have no understanding—they do not know that they do not understand, for no one knows that but the knowino- ' O * He proceeded ; ' Such being their way, which we declined to follow, a motley crowd of their tyrants conspired against us, and wrote to ^Abdu-^l-'Aziz telling him that there was at el-Hasa a number of persons who opposed his doctrines, who believed that he and his followers were a sect of tyran nical innovators, who set at nought the laws of the Alost High, and were steeped in profanities and immersed in crimes. After they had sent many letters to him to the same effect, he eventually directed the Wakil whom he had appointed over the people of el-Hasa to forward to him twelve men, named by himself, I being one of the number. Fearing that a worse fate might befall us if we resisted, we all obeyed. Amongst us was a young man who was well versed in theology, in the commentaries on the Book and the Traditions of the Apostle, a good logician, a learned controversialist, besides having read most of the standard works of the time. While on the road we strove to impress upon this young man that our answer and his to any ques tions propounded to us by the other party should be confined to this : ' May God reward you ! Point out to us the way of salvation, for we are most anxious to attain it.' On reaching Riyadh, of Nejd, we saw 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz there, with a number of his followers and ministers, but before we came within saluting distance the children cried out: 'God is great! let the vain be crushed ! the vain are crushed ! God exalt the Muslims and bring down the MushriMn! 1 Surrounded in this manner we alighted at the Masjid, called the Masjid of the Mut&amp;waah, and as soon as we had deposited our travel-250 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. ling equipment, goods, and food, 'Abdu-1- Aziz came to us, accompanied by a number of his Mutawaali, and after ex changing salutations with us they sat down and welcomed us. After they left, a most liberal supply of food arrived from 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz for ourselves and our animals; and trays of refreshments, which left nothing to be desired, continued to be sent to us every morning and evening. 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz also used to pay us a visit every morning, with one of his principal Mutawaah, who used to read to us from the Solu tion of Difficulties, to which we affected to listen with the greatest attention. Whenever he brought his lecture to a close, we used to say with one accord: ' God recompense you -/or/ Show us the right way, for we are anxious to know it, and to follow the words of truth/ This refrain of ours rather puzzled them, for it tended to conceal our own views. One day, however, 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz came to the Mdsjid, accompanied by several Mutawaah, and directed him who had been accustomed to read to us to read us a portion from the Solution of Difficulties. That done, he addressed us as fol lows : ' Ye men of el-Hasa, we understand you believe that there are eminent Fakihs among you whom no one can match in learning, and that you are far superior to us in acquirements. Question us, therefore, if you be sincere; or submit to us, if you be followers of the truth.' The young man already mentioned as one of our number turned to him and said: f Thus far you have spoken to us a good deal, and have read to us what is contained on the leaves of that book, which consists chiefly of negations most difficult to be dealt with, even by men of the highest intellect; but permit me to ask you to call upon these eminent sheikhs to answer a question touching the religion of God and His Apostle :—Is there a link wanting thereto after [the teaching of] the Apostle of God and his orthodox Successors which you and your followers have supplied, or is yours a distinct religion?' As the Mutawwa was silent, not venturing tosalim-bin-8ultan. 251 reply, 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz said to him, ' By Allah !—and there is no other but He,—the youth has vanquished you and stopped your mouth ; for if you say that it is distinct, you are a liar, for a distinct religion cannot reach us except through an apostle sent to that end, and there has been no such apostle sent since Muhammad, the Apostle of God. On the other hand, if you say that it is an additional link, you are an in novator, since he who adds creed to creed cannot be regarded in any other light, and is in the darkness of error. The religion of God is one, not many, and one of your calibre should not have attempted to ply the learned with your speculative opinions: you have smitten a hard rock with your glass, and have imitated the walk of the blind in your aberrations. As to you, ye learned men of el-Hasa, may God recompense you ! you are far removed from all doubt, and have no sympathy with the doctrine of Tashrtk. If you remain with us, you shall be valued and respected; but if you prefer to return, you are free to return in peace/ We all told him that we preferred the latter alternative, and wo accordingly left him the same day. On reaching el-Hasa we found that the Mutawaah of the Wahhabis had become more tyrannical, even towards those who had submitted to them, to say nothing of their outrageous conduct towards those who refused to recognize their devilish and sophistical pretensions; so we left the place with a heavy heart, and were not quieted until we found security in Maskat of 'Oman.' Here the sheikh ended his narrative; after which we discussed the lives of the four Khalifahs, namely, Abu- Bekr, 'Omar, 'Othman and 'Aly, in the course of which dis cussion the sheikh Muhammad-ez-Zuwany made the follow ing remarks : ' I am astonished at those people who believe that 'Othman-bin-'Affan abstracted some portions from the exalted Kuran, out of envy, and because he was not dis tinguished by those characteristics which no one in the world, high or low, has been endowed with since the Apostle252 the imams op 'oman. of God, and that what ^Othman abstracted they possess, but may not show it, except to the principal followers of their creed, maintaining that it is unlawful for them to commu nicate it to any who differ from them. Let the impartial inquirer weigh such language as this, for investigation clears up what is doubtful and exposes error. Was it possible for 'Othman or any one else to abstract what was written in the heart ? for the Almighty saith : ' these are evident signs in the breasts of those who have received understanding/ 1 It is certain that the blessed Kuran was not brought down by Gabriel from the Lord of both worlds to Muhammad the Apostle written on paper, neither did the Apostle rehearse it to the people from paper; what power ; then, could ab stract what was in the heart, or what was not committed to writing except from the heart ? But if the case is as they maintain, why did not ^Aly, after ^Othman's death, restore what 'Othman had abstracted, even if they can bring themselves to believe—what would be most derogatory under the circumstances—that he feared him during his life time ? But all such assertions on their part are either lies, or insinuations, or sophisms congenial to these libertinisms.^ 3 1 Kuran, Sdrat-el-' 1 Ankabtit, (xxix.) 48. 2 I am not aware that this pretension on the part of the Wahh&amp;bis of being possessed of certain portions of the original Kuran, not to be found in the recognized version, has ever been noticed before. The orthodox opinion regarding the mode in which the Book was colligated, during the Khalifate of Abu-Bekr, Muhammad's successor, coincides with the following account of the undertaking, compiled by M. Caussin de Perceval from Abulf6da , s Annates Muslemici: —' Up to that time there was no complete copy of the Kuran ; even fragments of the same, written either on skins or palm-branches, were scarce. Some portions, moreover, had not yet been reduced to writing, and existed only in the memories of the As-hdb, [Companions of the Prophet]. The loss of so many of the Kurrd, [Readers who knew the Kuran by rote,] who had been killed in the battle of 'Akraba, [against Musailamah], had im pressed the Khalifah with the necessity of collecting the Kuran together into one book, in order that the deposit of the law which Muhammad had consigned to his contemporaries might be transmitted in its entirety tosalim-bin-sultan. 253 Here the sheikh paused and Salim said to him, ff God reward you, for you are a Fakih of a noble stamp ! Is there any thing that we can do for you, or any particular object wherein we may assist you He replied in the negative; so we took leave of him, mutually congratulating one another. Ihe eminent Seyyid Salim-bin-Sultan was very circum spect until he was attacked with the sickness of which he died. On his journeys from one place to another, whenever food was brought to him, he would not partake of it until some one else had eaten of it first, dreading treachery. He was more suspicious of friends than of enemies, and when a visitor entered his room he seized the hilt of his dagger, fixed his eyes upon the person, and did not remove them until the close of the interview. I spent one night with him it was the night before the 14th of Ramadhan, a.h. 12b0 [19th August, 1815]. A third part of the night having passed in conversation, he remarked, ' How is it that I do not hear the cry of the watchman from the Eastern fort ? My brother Said has imprisoned therein some refractory men of the Benu-'Utt&amp;b and a number of their notables.' (lliey belonged to el-Kuweit and el-Bahrein, and among them were Ibn-SaUimah, el-Kuweity, and 'Abdu-'r-Rahman, succeeding generations. A commission, composed of the surviving KurrA and of the best instructed As-hah, was accordingly charged with the task of gathering together all the fragments of the sacred book into one volume. This prototype, revised under the care of the said commission, Abu-Bekr confided to the safe keeping of Hafsah, the daughter of 'Omar, the Prophet's wife,' {Bist. des Arabes, vol. iii. p. 379). In a subsequent 'part of his history Abulfeda says : ' When 'Othman succeeded, finding that various readings were in the hands of the people, he caused a copy to be made from that which Ilafsah had, and^sent it everywhere, superseding all others.' {Apud Pocock, Speci men Hist. Arab., p. 348). The alleged assertion of the Wahhubis, that 'Othman took advantage of his position on this occasion to omit certain passages from the Kuran, which they profess to have recovered, is hardly met by the arguments of their ultra-orthodox opponent in the narrative.254 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. and Muhammad-bin-Sakar, both of el-Bahrein. I he Seyyid Said had taken away all the rudders from their boats and imprisoned them in the fort, when he was about to set out on his first expedition against el-Bahrein.) ' Go this instant,' added Salim, ' to the commandant of the troops at the lesser gate'—Suleiman, el-Huwaisy, held the appointment at that time—' and also to the commandant of the troops at the great gate' — Muhammad-bin-Salim, er-Euwahy — 'and order them each to bring ten of their men to me.' On their arrival he set out, some of us going before and others after him, until we came near the house of the sheikh Muhammad- bin-Ghalum, when he ordered the soldiers and slaves to halt. Then taking my hand and the hand of a man of the Abu-Said, named 'Aly-bin-Muhammad, he walked on until we approached the fort, when the watch threw a stone at us. Finding that the watchmen were on the alert, we walked away quickly by the broken wall of a house which the sea had demolished—the house belonged to Muhammad-bin- 'Akil, a victorious Amir—and saw on a mound of the ruins twelve figures, about twelve cubits in height, clad in white shirts and turbans, all in the act of praying together, behind an Imam who was taller than the rest. When he came to the salutation and had saluted them, he then turned to us and said, ' Stop where you are.' We accordingly halted, and, in fact, our legs seemed as if they were bound with iron fetters. After witnessing this apparition we returned to the soldiers and slaves, and inquired of them whether they had seen what we had. They had neither seen nor heard of any such thing before we told it to them. Going back in company to the same spot we saw nothing of what we had seen previously, and were greatly amazed. Then we were convinced beyond doubt that those we had seen were pure Sufis. 1 We accompanied the Seyyid Salim to his house, ' In the original, SiXfiyy-An safiyy An, meaning probably purified Sufis, who through mortification and devotion had attained a beatified state,SAL1M -bin -SULTAN. 255 and then each returned to his home and the soldiers to their posts. Salim had a great regard for the destitute Sufis, as the following narrative will show. One day I accompanied him on a visit to his brother Said. When we got near the shop of the coppersmith Ahmed-bin-Yusif, esh-Shiay, we noticed a youth of a beautiful countenancej with long flowing hair, clad in ragged garments. The Seyyid Salim gazed earnestly at him, while the young man abstained from looking at the people and continued moving his lips, uttering gentle sounds which the listeners could not understand. 1 Salim then motioned me to him, and said : ' Go quickly to my Wakil and get ten dollars from him and give them to the man who is standing near the coppersmith^ shop.' I did as he directed me, but when I returned the man was gone. I then made inquiries about him, but no one could give me any information on the subject. On reporting these circum stances to Salim, when he had returned to his house, he bade me restore to the Wakil what I had taken from him, remarking that the opportunity for its use had passed away, and adding, 'Ye shall not will unless God willeth.' 2 As regard's Salim's bravery I may mention the following: equal to that of the angels. The tenets of this extraordinary class of Persian enthusiasts, whose free opinions regarding the dogmas of Islam and contempt for its forms contrast so strikingly with their claim to in effable communion with the Deity, are ably described by the late Sir John Malcolm in his History of Persia, vol. ii. pp. 382-414. All religions being tolerated at Maskat, it is not surprising to find that some of the Sufis had found their way to that town, and that the more credulous among the population sympathized with them, although the national creed of the IMdhiyah of 'Oman discountenances the super stitious practices of Fakirs, Willis, Darwishis, and such like fanatics and confraternities. 1 The ' Adhumean,' one of the Fakir sects of the Sufis mentioned by Malcolm in the foregoing quotation, devote themselves to a life of mendicacy : ' They are always travelling, and are companionless. This sect continually move their lips in devotion.' 2 Kuran, Silrat-el-Insdn, (Ixxvi.) 30.256 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. —I accompanied him when the Julfar boats approached the Eastern battery to plunder the Seyyid Said's subjects espe cially, and the vessels of the people of India generally. At that time the Amir of Julfar was one Hasan-bin-Rahmah, el-Hawaly, a Wahhaby of the Wahhabis, the number of whose forces afloat was said to amount to four thousand five hundred, composed of men from Nejd and various other parts. He had twenty-four vessels, one of which was a large ship which he had plundered from a native of Yemen, called Abu-'Abid. The Seyyid Said and his brother Salim, and all the others of the Al-Bu-Said who resided at Maskat, embarked on board one vessel, and when they met the enemy there was a great fight between them. Then the two Seyyids returned to Mdskat to prepare four additional vessels, carrying twelve hundred men, for the contest. The Seyyid Salim accompanied this second expedition on board a of his ship the Faidh- Alam, the Seyyid Said being on board the el-Aul, Ahmed-bin-Seif-bin-Muhammad on board his own vessel, while that belonging to Muhammad-bin-Ghalum was manned by men from Persia. We had two encounters with the enemy at sea, the second more severe than the first. The fire from our ships and their boats was like the roar of thunderand the flashing of lightning. I can even nowsee Salim standing by the helm, smiling while all the rest were scowling. During that sharp struggle, when the dagger seemed ready to pierce all hearts, he exemplified by his composure the saying of the poet Abu-et-Tdyyab: '0 God ! the fire of this crisis has melted away all shams, leaving only men and braves.' We chased the retiring enemy as far as Salamah and then returned to Maskat. After the Julfar affair Salim took up his residence at el- Masnaah, whither I and the two sheikhs, Hamid-bin-Muham- mad-bin-Salim, el-Bast, and 'Aly-bin-Muhammad, ed-Diir- maky, went to congratulate him on his victory. He over whelmed us with the showers of his liberality and made usSALIM-BIN-SULTAN. 257 recline in the meadows of his courteous hospitality. We remained with him many long days which delight made short, and when we were about to return to Maskat he gave us our choice either to perform the journey by land or by sea. As we preferred the latter, he caused a splendid boat to be made ready for us, and on taking leave of us he quoted this verse:— ' No welcome to the morrow, and no congratulation to it, If separation from those we love is to be on the morrow. ' Salim's love of his friends was very great. When he was dangerously ill I took several of my companions with me to pay him a visit. On reaching him he gently reproached us for not having come to see him the day before. Alas ! alas! for that time. Alas ! for the loss of that Seyyid whose affection for his friends was so deep and lasting. I shall never cease to lament him, and my only comfort is the word of God to His Prophet, 'Proclaim glad tidings unto the patient.' In fine, the Seyyid Salim-bin-Sultanas praiseworthy cha racteristics are innumerable. He died of paralysis, in the city of Maskat, on Wednesday night during the month of Rajab, a.h . 1236, [April 1821], and was buried in the small building which had been erected by Sultanas mother on the western side of the central Wadi of Maskat. Salim left three male heirs, namely, the Seyyid Muhammad, the Seyyid Hamed, and the Seyyid Sirhan. He was eulogized by many poets after his death.258 BOOK THE THIRD. T he L ife and A ctions op the glorious S eyyid S a'id- bin- S ultan-bin-el- I mam- A hmed. [a.h . 1219-1293 = a.d . 1804-1856.] Preface and Summary. T his book, entitled the F ull M oon , contains the life of the exalted Seyyid Said, the son of Sultan, son of the renowned Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, Al-Bd-Saidy, el-Yemeny, eVOmany, el-Azdy, written by the eloquent Fakih, the sheikh Salil- ibn-Razik, who invokes God on his own behalf and on be half of the Muslims generally, beseeching Him to put away all trouble from among them. He wrote this noble biogra phy in the year of the Prophets Hijrah, the year 1273 of Islam [ a.d . 1856]. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate ! Praise be to God through whom Said, the happiest of rulers, attained quiet prosperity and perennial glory, decree ing to him sublime eminence in the sphere of happiness and renown, insomuch that by the Divine aid vouchsafed to him he subdued the sovereigns of his time, acquired dignity by the battles which he fought with his enemies, conquered with the sword hitherto unknown countries, and made a straight road over the dissevered necks of the rebellious! Blessing and peace also rest upon His sustained Apostle, our lord Muhammad, who by His power humbled the enemy; and likewise upon his Family and Companions, who tri-sa'id-bin-sultan. 259 umphed with the edge of their sharp swords, and whose victories only stimulated them to fresh conquests ! But to proceed: After having to the best of my ability put together a connected narrative of the life of the mag nanimous Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, and followed it up with a detailed account of the glorious deeds of his eminent sons, I forbore taking up the biography of the most noble and distinguished Said-bin-Sultan, following therein the example of ancient and modern historians who abstain from recording- exalted virtues until the decease of their possessors; and rightly so, inasmuch as the scope and influence of such vir tues are not apparent until the hour of their death, for God alone knows the unknown. Now, when I wrote the life of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said and of the sovereigns his sons. Said was still alive; after his death, however, I felt at liberty to record the transactions of his time and those which redounded to his renown and dignity. Now, therefore, I shall proceed to recount somewhat of the information which I have acquired respecting his exalted life; some parts I omit owing to their general notoriety; the propriety of secrecy must be my excuse for other omissions. I have styled this biography of the eminent Seyyid Said- bin-Sultan-bin-el-Imam the Full Moon, and after repeating the formula, ^ In the name of God the most merciful!' I submit what follows to every gentle reader:— It is certain that the glorious and exalted Seyyid Said- bin-Sultan-bin-el-Imam-Ahmed-bin-Said, el-BA-Saidy, el- Azdy, was born at Semiiil, in the year a.h . 1206 [ a.d . 1791], and died on the 19th of Safar, a.h . 1273 [19th October 1850], his entire age therefore was sixty-two years and two months, all but eleven days. 1 He died on the voyage between Maskat 1 The date of the Seyyid Sa'id's death as here stated is correct; but if he was born a.d . 1791, he was sixty five years old when he died. It is not clear why the author should have given this account of the260 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. and Zanzibar, on board his ship called theLictor, [\ ictoria], while in the sea of Seychelles. He was then washed and shrouded, and prayers were said over him on board the said vessel, and then he was placed in a wooden coffin. It took the vessel six days to reach Zanzibar, and he was buried at night in the garden of his residence there, and his two sons, Majid and Barghash, together with all the people, mourned for him three days. When the mourning was ended, Majid was promoted over his brothers who were at Zanzibar, and on assuming authority he confirmed all the officials in the rank which they had severally held during his father's life time ; the people, moreover, recognized him and were satis fied with his arrangements. Then he dispatched one of his father's ships to Maskat, entrusting to a special messenger letters from himself conveying the sad intelligence to his brothers Thuwainy, Muhammad, and lurky, 1 sons of Said- bin-Sultan, and to all others of the Al-Bu-Said to whom he felt bound to write. The ship in due course anchored off Ras -el-Hadd, and Majid's messenger sent the letters to the sheikh of that place, who took them on to the Seyyid Said- bin-Khalfan-bin-Said, el-Bu-Saidy, the Wali of Sur, who proceeded with them to Maskat and delivered them to the Seyyid Thuwainy-bin-Said. (The vessel returned to Zanzibar immediately after the letters were consigned to the sheikli of el-Hadd.) After the Seyyid Thuwainy had read the letter addressed to himself, and after the Wali of Sur had told him about the Seyyid Sa'id's death here rather than at the end of his biography of that sovereign. 1 Mr. Palgrave calls the Seyyid Sa'id's son, who held Sohar at the time of'his father's death, ' Amjed but the Seyyid had no son of that name. [East* cmd Cent* Avctbi(X) vol. ii. p. 2/7.) The statement made by the same author, in the passage referred to, about the division of his ' ample possessions' by the Seyyid, on Ins death-bed, between his three sons, ' Thoweynee,' ' Majid,' and ' Am jed,' is equally erroneous, as has already been pointed out in the latter part of the Introduction.sa'id-bin-sultan. 201 slieikh of el-Hadd and Majid's messenger, he decided to retain the other letters and to keep the news a secret for the present. All he did was to direct his scribes to write to the commandants of all his father's forts to be on their guard. Then when he had taken satisfactory pre cautions at Maskat and el-Matrah, he caused his fathers death to be proclaimed, and sent all the letters to the addressees. The intelligence caused such a wailing through out the town that the hills were almost shaken by it. Then Thuwainy and his brother Muhammad-bin-Said, and the two sons of their uncle Salim, namely Muhammad and Hdmed, and the rest of the Al-Bu-Said who were at Maskat, went into mourning for three days. When the news arrived, the Seyyid Turky was at Sohar, of which place his father Said had made him Wali; but on the arrival of his brother Majid's messenger with the letter conveying the intelligence, he also went into mourning with his people for three days, and all prayed to God for resignation, in accordance with the words of the Most High: ' Proclaim good tidings unto the patient, who when a misfortune befalls them say: We are God's, and to Him we shall surely return.' A Ray fkom the kesplendent Life op the SEYYID SA'ID, The Son op Sultan, Son op the Imam Ahmed-bin-Sa'id, with a narrative op some op his glorious and renowned achievements. On the death of his father Sultan, (the manner of which we have already described in his biography,) the Seyyid Said his son assumed command over 'Oman, and sat on the throne of the government. His preferment thereto over his brother Salim-bin-Sultan was chiefly owing to the Seyyidah, the (laughter of the Imam, 1 to which arrangement Salim was 1 That is, of the Imam Ahmed. In like manner, by ' the son of the262 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. a consenting party. Said appointed over Maskat one Durrah- bin-Jumaali, a Belooch. This Durrah was a distinguished man, and had been very kind to Seif and Sultan, the sons of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said, when they repaired to Mekran, owing to some dissensions which had arisen betwixt them and their father. The Seyyid Said also sent for the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad, el-Jabry, and asso ciated him with himself in the administration, and he further directed his scribes to write and summon all the chiefs of 'Oman to come to him. On their arrival he took their suf frages to aid him against any who should oppose his rule, and thereupon distributed gifts among them according to the rank of each; after which the tribes returned to their homes. But the seyyid Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil, was ill-disposed towards the Seyyid Said, fearing his vengeance on account of some differences of old standing, which had existed between him and Sultan. He accordingly left Maskat with his family and went to Hail-el-Grhaf, from whence he wrote to Kais, the son of the Imam [Ahmed], to move quickly on Md-skat, offering to supply his army with provisions, money, and arms. Kais fell in with the pro position and dispatched messengers to all his people in that sense. Many of the tribes also, and most of the Al-Bii- Said urged him in the same direction; the only persons of the Al-Bu-Said who kept aloof were, Muhammad-bin-Khal fan, el-Muhall, and 'Aly-bin-Talib-bin-Muhenna, and Hilal- bin-Hamed-bin-el-Imam-Said, and Seif-bin-'Aly, uncle to the Seyyid Salim-biivSultan. When these machinations became known to the Seyyid Said, he wrote letters sum moning the sheikh Majid-bin-Said, er-Riwany, and Muhenna- bin-Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, the Wuli of Nakhl, and Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jary, and Salim-biu- Imam,' Ahmed, the first Imam of the Al-Bu-Sa'id, their Imam kut' «£ 0 xV. is always to be understood.sa'id-bin-sultan. 263 Thany-bin-Masud, el-Haily, el-Jary, and Najim-bin-'Ab- dallah, es-Seyyaby. The first to arrive was Sirhan-bin-Su leiman, together with all the chiefs of the Wadi-Semail: these he directed to take up a position at es-Sedd, of er- Riwa. When his letter reached Muhenna-bin-Suleiman, el- Yaaruby, the 'WTili of Nakhl, the latter immediately dis patched his brothers Himyar and Khalfan-bin-Malik, el- Yaaruby, to the Benu-Riyam and the el-^Obriyyin, with instructions to proceed from thence to ezh-Zhahirah and summon the sheikh Hamid-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad, el- Ghafiry, and all the Nizariyyah of that district; then to proceed to the 13enu-Naim and all others who were of the same mind with them, urging them to lose no time in going to the assistance of the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan-bin-el- Imam. When Kais-bin-el-Imum had assembled his forces at Sohar, his brother Said-bin-el-Imam joined him with a con tingent from er-Rastak, as did also his brother Muhammad- bin-el-Imam, with a large body of Arabs from es-Suwaik. Besides these reinforcements, 'Aly-bin-Hilal-bin-el-Imam came with a number of the el-Haddan and others; many of the ezh-Zhawahir also swelled the ranks of his supporters, so that in all his army is said to have exceeded twelve thou sand men. Marching at the head of this force Kais moved on el- Khaburah, the sheikh of which, Nebhan-bin-Seif-biu-Said, ez-Zamily, surrendered all its forts to him without opposition. (This man had been appointed to the post by Sultan-bin-el- Imam.) Kais passed by el-Masnaah and also Barkah, but on reaching es-Sib, Seif-bin-Hanzhal, of the Al-Bu-Saidy, delivered up the place to him without fighting. (He also had been made Wali of that district during the lifetime of Sultan-bin-el-Imam.) On arriving at el-Karm he ordered his men to attack es-Sedd, which was held by the Benu- Jabir—the people of et-Tau and Semiiil—and the es-Seyya-264 THK IMAMS OF 'OMAN. biyyin, under Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, who repulsed their charge with guns and musketry, and obliged them to retire. On their return to Kais at el-Karm, to whom they reported that their attempt upon es-Sedd had failed, owing to the artillery and musketry of the large force stationed there, he directed them to attack 'Akabat-el-Marakh, which was held by the people of Semail. They did so, and succeeded in dislodging them j they also expelled the Beloochees from the Beit-el-Falj, who had been posted there by the Seyyid Said- bin-Sultan. Then the army under the Seyyid Kais returned to attack the force at es-Sedd, who were quite unaware of the approach of the enemy by the 'Akabat-el-Marakh, until a man of Dar-Sit apprised them thereof. (Bs-Sedd at that time was held by Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, el-Muhall, with 300 of the el-Hajariyyin, and a like number of the Benu- Jabir and the es-Seyyabiyyin.) Thereupon Muhammad-bin- Khalfan and his followers retired by the road of Sih-el- Harmel, meeting with no opposition, and crossed the ^Akabat- el-Khail towards Maskat. On the way, Sirhan dismissed one hundred and fifty of his men, who went by the Wadi- Hatat and then descended from Kdz-hah, on their way home, while he himself with the remainder went by the 'Akabah of the great Wadi and reached Maskat on the morning after the evacuation of es-Sedd, and by order of Sultan's sons posted themselves at the three gates of the town, namely, Bab-el-Kebir, Bab-es-Saghir, and Bab-el-Mitha'ib. Then the Seyyid Salim-bin-Sultan went by sea to Barkah in the vessel called et-TawdUuly, and sent a messenger from thence to Muhenna -bin-Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el- Yaaruby, the W^li of Nakhl, urging him to come to their aid. Muhenna set out immediately with one hundred men : ^ these were in addition to fifty whom he had sent to Barkah before he received the Seyyid's letter, and who had been posted in the castle of es-Saruj. Then Salim -bin-Sultan and Muhenna -bin-Muhammad embarked with their men on board34 SA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 265 the et-Taivdkkuly, and reached Maskat the following after noon. Muhenna remained on the Island, and posted some of his men on the heights overlooking the 'Akabat-es-Sahim, with orders to keep up a constant fire from their muskets during the night. The Benu-Jabir and the Beuu-'l-Musib also cooperated with Muhenna, who had now charge of all the fortified posts, with the exception of the two forts and the two batteries. (As to Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, el-Muhall, and the Hajariyyin, they started first to Sur, and from thence to esh-Sharkiyyah, and did not return to M^skat until the war was over.) Then Muhenna was joined by 500 men from Tiwa and Halm, and all the valleys of the Benu-Jabir, under their Amirs 'Adiy-bin-Barakat and ^Abdallah-bin- Muhammad, es-Salbiyyan, in pursuance of an appeal which he had sent to them through Salim-bin-Thany, el-Jazy. These Muhenna posted on the heights overlooking el-Makulla as far as Ras-el-Baz. Afterwards, he was joined by one hun dred men of the Benu-'l-Aswad, known as the el-Masakarah, 1 whom he stationed at el-Mitha'ib. Muhenna also collected many of the Nizariyyah, and then he and Majid-bin-Said, el- Barwany, consulted together on the advisability of war or peace between the Seyyid Kais and the sons of the Seyyid Sultan. They decided on the latter, and wrote a letter to the Seyyid Kais offering to give him two thousand dollars monthly, and to allow him to retain the forts which he had captured, if he would desist from hostilities against his nephews. (Kais, as stated above, had seized the forts of es- Sib and el-Khaburah.) The Seyyid replied to the following effect:—' You have made me a vain proposition, and my only alternative is war.' On the receipt of this commu nication hostilities began on both sides with musketry. Parties of Kais^s people would come to Riyam by the ^Akabat- el-Khail and plunder the houses of the inhabitants, and when ' Probably the ' Massakccah' of the late Colonel llamerton, who estimates the tribe at four thousand fighting men.260 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. the raid was reported at M£skat some of Muhenna's men would issue forth to attack them, and after a skirmish the two parties separated. Again, detachments of Muhenna's people would proceed as far as Riwa, and plunder whatever they could lay hands on. When this state of things had lasted for several days, the daughter of the Imam [Ahmed] sent the sheikh 'Aly-bin-Fadhl, esh-Shiay, to Bedr-bin- Seif-bin-el-Imam requesting him to come to them. 'Aly met him at Barr-Katar, 1 and immediately on receiving the invitation Bedr embarked in a boat with only three of his followers and went to Maskat, where Sultan's sons and the Imam's daughter forthwith consigned the management of affairs into his hands. After remaining two days at Maskat Bedr went by sea to Barkah, and took up his residence in the fort. A few days subsequently he learnt that seven hundred of the Benu-Riyam, under their Amir the sheikh Nasir-bin-Muhammad, er-Riyamy, and three hundred of the el-'Obriyym, under the sheikh Malik-bin-Rashid, el-'Obry, had come to Nakhl, and he forthwith sent a messenger to urge them to join him without delay. On their arrival he got boats for them at Barkah and took them to Maskat, where by Muhenna's orders they were encamped in the lesser Wadi, their encampment extending from the Bir-el-Luluah to the Bir-es-Sabarah. A messenger then arrived with a letter from the Mullah- el-Hajj, the commandant of the fort of el-Matrah, addressed to the Seyyids, Sultan's sons, and the Imam's daughter, apprising them that the cistern of the fort contained only a small quantity of water, and that their supply of powder and shot and other warlike stores was very limited; furthei', that unless they could replenish those stores within three days he should he obliged to surrender the fort to Kais, whose troops were in force on his right and left, and had besieged him, having succeeded in establishing posts from 1 See note, p. 237.sa'id-bin-sultan. 267 el-Mutairah to the sweetmeat and blackmiths , markets, from which latter positions they kept up a constant fire from their guns during the day, and at night their men, who were concealed in the cotton-market, sallied out against them. The besieging force was under the command of 'Aly- bin-Hilal-bin-el-Imam, the Seyyid Kais and the remainder of his army being encamped from the Bir-es-Sawaihy-el- Belooshy, as far as es-Sedd. His cavalry consisted of forty horses. All the residents of el-Matrah and its suburbs had submitted to him. Mullah-el-Hajj's letter excited the gravest apprehensions of the Seyyids, and they forthwith dispatched a messenger for Muhenna. When he arrived—at that time they had fortified themselves in the Eastern fort—they submitted the letter of the commandant of the fort of el-Matrah to him; his messenger also corroborated the written statements respecting the deficiency of water, provisions, and ammu nition, and the critical position of the besieged. Muhenna's brief reply was: 'You may inform the Mullah that, God willing, our people shall be with him to-morrow, bringing with them the different supplies mentioned in his letter.' They accordingly wrote to him to that effect. Muhenna then left them, and made no movement in the matter till after the prayer of sunset, when he sent to the Seyyids and requested them to have several of their small vessels, together with the supplies wanted by the command ant of the fort of el-Matrah, ready for him at liiyam on the following morning. Then he ordered the Benu-Riyam and the el-'Obriyyin to proceed that same night to el-Mdtrah, and to dislodge those who held the heights overlooking Sih-el- Harmel, and on the approach of dawn to keep up a constant tire from their muskets. On the cessation of the artillery and musketry fire at el-Matrah they were to return to Maskat. At dawn onthefollowing morning Muhenna and the remain-268 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. der of the force went to Riyam, where he gave directions to the crews to anchor the ships at some distance from the fort, and when they saw that his force had entered el-Matrah and had engaged the enemy, they were to call out to the garri son of the fort to come and carry away the cargoes from the vessels. On reaching the pass overlooking el-Matrah, Mu- henna posted some musketeers on the surrounding heights, and then turned off with the remainder. I was with the force on the occasion, and the assault was made at dawn of the 28th of Ramadhan, 1219, [31st December, 1804]. The assault led to a sharp action between the two parties, extending from the cotton-market to the first wall of the Luwatiyah, during which the vessels approached the fort, and the detachments of the enemy which were posted in the sweetmeat and cotton markets fled. Then the garrison of the fort succeeded in carrying away all the water, provi sions, and warlike stores from the vessels. In the mean time many of Kais^s men, on hearing the fire of the mus keteers who had been placed on the heights above Sih-cl- Harmel, proceeded in that direction, but on finding that the musketeers did not come down they concluded that it was one of Muhenna's stratagems to deceive them. They then retraced their steps to el-Matrah, but saw none of Muhenna's force, which had returned to Maskat as soon as their object had been effected. A few of Kais's men, how ever, followed the retreating party, and caught sight of them on the summit of 'Akabat-el-Khail, killing two stragglers whom they encountered near the well; thereupon both parties returned to their respective encampments. In this affair Muhenna lost five and Kais twenty-five men; the names of the former are as follows :—the sheikh Ssud-bin- Rashid, el-Hinly, el-Jary, and Said, er-Rikhy, and Mas'ud- bin-Rashid, es-Saidy, en-Nakhly, and Mas'ud, et-Tuby, and one of the people of Behla. There were six wounded, but none of them mortally.SA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 2G9 On the 8th of Shaawal Muhonna attacked el-Mdtrah, and after coming within gun-shot of Kais's party from the heights of Sih-el-Harmel both armies retired. Then Hamid-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad, el-Grhafiry, and Himyar-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, the former accompanied by seven thousand of the Nizariyyah, arrived at Barkah, halting at Nuaman, whither the Seyyid Said-bin-Sultan went to meet them from Maskat, and renewed the covenant which he had already made with them, distributing robes of honour among them and such supplies as they required. Now, when the seyyid Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil, saw that the power of the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan, and also of Bedr-bin-Seif, was on the increase, while that of Kais^s partisans was on the wane, he wrote to Muhenna- bin-Muhammad, el-Yaaruby, for an interview with him at Killabuh. At that interview, Muhammad acting for Kais, and Muhenna for the sons of the Seyyid Sultan, for Bedr and the daughter of the Imam, the following conditions of peace were agreed upon ;—Kais to have the forts of es-Sib and el-Khaburah, to evacuate el-Matrah, and return to Sohar. (Muhenna was a very upright and conscientious man: when the Benu-Ghafir wished to enter Maskat, he, fearing that if they once got into the place, being so for midable a body, they might not leave it again ; and, further, knowing that they had already entered into communications with Sultan-bin-Sakar, el-Kasimy, el-Hawaly, and concerted with him to that effect, and that Sultan was already collect ing his forces, forthwith dispatched a messenger from the Seyyids to Hamid-bin-Nasir and his army, with a sum of iorty thousand dollars and other presents, informing them at the same time that as peace had been concluded between the Seyyids and Kais, their presence was no longer re quired.) Kais accordingly embarked with his army for Sohar, but on reaching Barkah he went straight to Nakhl, fearing that he might bo pounced upon by Hamid-bin-Nasir.270 THE IMAMS OF ^OMAN. Tho latter, on hearing that Muhenna had left for Nakhl, started with his followers for ezh-Zhahirah, while Himyar- bin-Muhammad returned to Nakhl. Two months after the peace, Malik-bin-Seif-bin-Sultan murdered Muhenna-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, in his own fort. His cousin, Muhammad-bin-Suleiman-bin-Muhammad, was charged with having instigated him to the crime, but most persons think that Bedr-bin-Seif-bin-el-Imam was the chief conspirator. What gives colour to this opinion is that Bedr-bin-Seif went to Habra with a few followers and reached that place at night. At dawn the next morning the report of guns was heard from the fort of Nakhl, where upon Bedr said to his companions: ' I suspect that Mu henna has been killed,' and he dispatched Salim-bin-Thany, el-Jary, to make inquiries. When the latter reached Nakhl he found that it was so, and he returned to Bedr and informed him that the deed had been committed by Malik- bin-Seif, who had also sent the body of the murdered man to his brother Himyar, who at that time occupied the Hujrah at el-Jamimy. By this means Malik-bin-Seif got possession of the fort of Nakhl. Muallim Mas ; ud-bin-Khamis-bin-Salih-bin-Sinan, el- Aama, el-Mandhary, gave me the following information on the subject. He said: ' I used to repair to the fort every morning at dawn to give lessons in the Kuran to tho Wali Muhenna-bin-Muhammad. On Friday the 9th of Dzul-Kaadah, 1219 [8th January, 1805], I went thither as usual, and found that Muhenna had already trimmed the lamp; so we sat down at once to peruse the blessed Book. At the second dawn he prayed with me, after which we again studied the Kuran, and had come to the Surat-en-Ndhal, when one of Muhenna's slaves ex claimed, ( The enemy is at hand, 0 Muhenna!' Muhenna re marked, ' This slave is demented. , Then as he was reading, ' In tho name of God, the merciful, the compassionate !SA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 271 Tho sentence of God will come, therefore do not hasten it/ Malik-bin-Seif and several of his companions suddenly fell upon him. He wrestled with Malik and overpowered him, and then strove to strike him with his dagger, whereupon Malik cried out, 'The man has killed me.' Then Salim-bin- Nasib, nicknamed esh-Shakily, came forward and plunged his dagger into Muhenna's belly, killing him on the spot.' When Kais-bin-el-Imam heard of the death of Muhenna he ordered Nasir-bin-Said, el-Hdbashy, known as es-Sam- mar, to make inroads in the direction of el-Bushir, 1 and to close the sea-route with his boats, so as to prevent any of the craft belonging to the people of Barkah and el-Masnaah from going to Maskat. This Nasir-es-Sammar was at the time Kais's Wali over es-Stb, and held the fort there. He went even beyond his instructions, for he collected a great number of freebooters and went with them to Finja, the people of which joined him, and then attacked the fort of Badbad, then in the hands of 'Aly-bin-Seif-bin-el-Imam, and took it by force, but did not kill any one. Nasir pursued this career for a considerable period, sometimes making raids on the people of es-Sarur, and then returning to es- Sib to ravage the villages of Bushir, insomuch that he effectually stopped all communication both by sea and land. These proceedings estranged the Seyyids from their uncle Kais; they were still more estranged from Bedr-bin-Seif, whom they accused of having instigated Malik-bin-Salim to murder Muhenna, chiefly, as they believed, because Muhenna was their principal adviser and entirely devoted to their interests. These feelings, however, they kept to themselves and did not communicate them either to high or low. 1 See note 1, p. 68. Mr. Palgrave writes it ' Besheyr,' and describes it as ' a large village, but mostly constructed of wood and thatch ; the streets wide, clean and irregular; an earth wall surrounds the whole, dividing the houses and the gardens.' Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. ii. p. 375.272 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. When es-Sammar's plunderings by sea and land had be come notorious, Kais began to collect troops and then wrote to his brother Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, who was at that time in 'Oman holding possession of the fort of Behla and the castle of Nezwa and Azka, to go down to Semail and divert the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, and all the Nizariyyah of that place, so as to prevent them from going to Maskat. Muhammad did as he was requested, taking a large force with him, and found the Benu-Ruwahah and the people of the 'Alayat-Semail assembled together to oppose him. Kais, on the other hand, marched with his army to Maskat, which was then held by the Seyyid Salim, with a force consisting of some of the Benu-Jaalan, the Benu- Rasib and el-Kawasim, the Benu-Jabir of Tiwa, and some of the men of Nakhl, adherents of Malik-bin-Seif, el-\aaruby; (at this time Said-bin-Sultan was at Barkah.) On the ap proach of Kais and his army towards es-Sedd, the Benu- Rasib and the el-Kawasim encountered him, and there was a severe fight in the Wadi, called el-'Adiy, in which Muham mad-bin Majid, the Amir of the former, and likewise the Amir of the el-Kawasim were killed, and only a few of their followers escaped unhurt. Thereupon Salim-bin-Sultan re turned to Maskat with the remainder of his forces, while Kais and his army entered es-Sedd and halted there three nights. Bedr-bin-Seif then went out with his followers and lay in ambush above the villages of the castle of the er- Riwayah, in the greater Wadi. Towards night, Kais-bin-el-Imam started with his army, taking the road of the 'Akabah of the greater Wadi, and then turning off towards M^skat. Bedr's men getting scent of this took to flight, Bedr taking refuge in the castle, but two of his horsemen, one named Hudayyid and the other 'Abd-esh-Sheikh, were killed. Now, Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil, had concealed a number of men in his house, without the knowledge eitherSA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 273 of Salim-bin-Sultan or of Bedr-bin-Seif. These rushed to the great gate—the warder of which was a manumitted slave of Muhenna-bin-Suleiman, named Sarlir, el-Awghany—and opened it for Kais's forces, who forthwith went to the house of the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Khalf, esh-Shiay, and utterly ♦ rifled it. One of the Benu-Jabir who held the tower of the great gate, namely, Ahmed-bin-Eablat, el-Jabiry, brother- in-law to the sheikh Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabiry, was killed in the onset by Bin-Dan, en-Nuby, one of Muham- mad-bin-Khalfan^s servants, after he had given him quarter. Then Kais's soldiers plundered the market of Maskat and killed the money-changer Minshah, taking thousands of coin from his shop. To revert to Muhammad-bin-el-Imam: on his arrival at Semilil he employed his troops in cutting down all the date- trees of Sittal, the property of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el- Hajary. Thereupon Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabiry, attacked them with his men of the Benu-Jabir and the Nizai'iyyah of Semiiil, and put them to flight; so Muhammad and those of his party who escaped returned to 'Oman. Kais having now possession of the whole of Maskat, with the exception of the Island, the two forts, and the two bat teries—these were still in the hands of the Seyyids, his brother Sultan's children—his sister, the daughter of the Imam, went to him by night at the house of the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, esh-Shiay, and adjured him to put an end to the war. Peace was consequently arranged be tween the two parties, on condition that the fort of el- Matrah should be made over to Kais, together with a monthly allowance of one thousand dollars, and that all the other forts which he had taken from his nephews should continue to be his. Kais then inquired of her respecting Bedr, as he had heard that he had been killed. She replied : ' He is in the Eastern fort. After taking refuge at the castle of the S5274 the imams of 'oman. er-Riwahah, he started therefrom before dawn by the road of the 'Akabat-Killabuh, and then embarked for Maskat.' On the cession of the fort of el-Matrah to Kais he trans ferred it to Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, who began to erect strong forts on the surrounding hills, called ez-Zamm, and Hakam, and 'Araf, and ed-Dauhah. Subsequently, Seif-bin-'Aly-bin-MuhammadjAl-Bft-Saidy, came to Maskat, and instigated Said-bin-Sultan and his brothers, as also Bedr-bin-Seif, to make war upon Kais, Seif-bin-'Aly accordingly began writing to the people of esh-Shamal, and to the ezh-Zhawahir, urging them to come to Maskat to aid the sons of Sultan against Kais. In con sequence of this appeal, Hazzaa, el-Yasy, came with two hundred auxiliaries of the ezh-Zhawahir. Bedr-bin-Seif also wrote to Ibn-'Abdan, el-Wahhaby, en-Nejdy, who brought the same number. He wrote also to the el-Harth and the el-Hajariyyin ; and the sheikh Majid-bin-baid, er-Riwany, came with five hundred. In like manner, the chiefs of the Benu-Hasan came with two hundred; and Salim-bin-'Aly, et-Temamy, with five hundred; and Khadim-bin-Muhammad, el-Hashimy, two hundred. He wrote also to his own loyal adherents, and Barrak-bin-Ghurab came to him with many of the ezh-Zhawahir. The Benu-'Aly, also, and the el- Mukabil, and the Benu-Ris, and the Benu-'Omar, and the el-Haddan, and the Benu-Said and Kindah, and all other peoples under his authority sent him numerous auxiliaries. Moreover, the brothers of the Imam Said-bin-Ahmed largely reinforced him ; and a great many of the Al-Said joined him, besides a considerable contingent from the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih. Altogether, the number amounted to thou sands. Then the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan, and the daughter of the Imam wrote to the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el- Jab ry^ directing him to go to ezh-Zhahirah and obtain for them the cooperation of Hamid-bin-Nsisir in their warsa'id-bin-sultan. 275 against Kais, and to request that on reaching Barkah he would encamp with his army at Nuaman. (A large sum of money was sent with this message to the sheikh Muhammad- bin-Nasir and to the sheikh Hamid-bin-Nasir.) The sheikh Muhammad succeeded in his mission^ for Hamid sent a summons to the people of ezh-Zhahirah and el-Jau, both Hadhr and Arabs^ and dispatched the Benu-Saadah and the Benu-Yezid in advance to Nuaman. When they reached Barkah^ Bedr-bin-Seif sent them on to Maskat^ and they were quartered in the buildings opposite the Island, where Sultan-bin-el-Imam used to promenade. When the whole of these forces were mustered, Said-bin- Sultan and his brothers and Bedr-bin-Seif, on hearing of their uncle Kais's arrival at el-Matrah, stopped the allow ance which they had covenanted to pay him. On the other hand, Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, the Wakil, aided Kais with large sums of money. Thereupon Kais ordered his mus keteers to attack Maskat; they accordingly approached it by the road of the ^Akabat-er-Riyam, parties being placed in ambush from the hollow as far as the heights overlooking es-Sarur and the castle of er-Riwayah. Another party marched by night towards the ^Akabah of Killabuh, which was held at that time by Suleiman-bin-Ahmed, el-Harasy, the Sahib of Jamina, with a number of the Benu-'Ammah and his slaves, on behalf of the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan. On being apprised of the impending attack they ascended the heights overlooking el-Makulla and hid there, and when ever the assailants attempted to establish themselves in the ^Akabah, Suleiman's men dislodged them with their mus ketry fire. Suleiman and his followers remained in the 'Akabah from daybreak and ascended the heights when night approached. So Kais's party were thwarted in their strategy. About this time Said-bin-Sultan and his brothers were joined by many of the Benu-Jabir from Tiwa and Halm,276 the imams of 'oman. and from other of their towns; some of the Bemi-^Arabah also came to him. These were posted from the heights of el-Makulla to below Eas-el-Baz. Then Muhammad-bin- Khalfan planted a gun in the open space facing the battery of el-Makulla, and a constant fire was kept up between the two posts, the gun in the opening effectually preventing the entrance of any vessels from Barkah and el-Masnaah, by way of el-Makulla, and obliging them to approach Maskat by the sea, in the rear of the Eastern [fort]. He also sent a detachment to occupy the tower which he had erected on the heights of ed-Dauhah, opposite to Ras-el-Baz, while another party of his men seized the position on Ras-el-Baz itself. Thereupon Bedr-bin-Seif, with the Benu-'Arabah, rushed upon the gunners attached to the gun in the open space, but was driven back with the loss of the sheikh of the 'Arabah, which vexed him very much. Then Kais with the mass of his army approached Maskat by the 'Akabat-es-Sahun, ascending from thence to the Mahdllet-el-Belush, and then descending into the small Wadi, ensconcing most of them under the mound in which is the well of Muhammad-bin-Seif, el-Muhallaly, and the remainder in the Masjid adjoining the Musalla-eVEid. 1 Thereupon the garrison of the castle of er-Riwayah opened fire upon them from their guns, but the shot fell short. Then they fired upon the Masjid with muskets from the tower called the Tower of Muhammad-ibn-Razik and killed three of Kais's men; a like number were also killed by an explosion of gunpowder in a ship belonging to the Benu- Muh^llal, caused by a spark from a gun-match. The Seyyid Said was at this time at Barkah, his brother Salim at el-Masnaah, the daughter of the Imam and Hamed- bin-Sultan in the Eastern fort, the daughter of Seif-bin- Muhammad in the Western fort, and Bedr-bin-Seif and 1 The Place of Prayer on festivals: generally an open space where public prayers are offered up on extraordinary occasions.sa'id-bin-sultan. 277 Scif-bin-'Aly on the Island. The Wali of Maskat, for the time being, on behalf of Bedr-bin-Seif, was Said-bin-Hamad- bin-Salim. When the alarm was raised, Bedr-bin-Seif repaired with his men to the great gate, intending to sally out against his uncle Kais with the adherents of Salim-bin-'Aly, et-Temamy, and the el-Hashm, the followers of Khadim-bin-Muhammad, el-Hashimy; but Seif-bin-^Aly dissuaded him, saying: 'Your idea is not a good one. If it be so that an attack must be made on your uncle, bring out against him the Wahhabis, and the ezh-Zhawahir, and the el-Hajariyyin; for, as you know, there is an old-standing blood-feud between Salim-bin- 'Aly, et-Temamy, and his men and the Benu-Hasan and their men, which has not yet been healed. Hence, if they were to go forth together to attack your uncle, it is very doubtful whether the Benu-Hasan would follow Salim's men; perhaps they might deliver them over to the swords of your uncle Kais, or they might come to blows amongst themselves, to their own hurt and to the strengthening of the enemy. Moreover, were Salim-bin-'Aly and his men to triumph over your uncle Kais they would not spare him; whereas we, in this matter, do not wish your dissensions with your uncle to be carried to such lengths, neither we are persuaded does he so wish : the struggle between you is for preeminence— for things, not for lives.' Bedr, approving of this advice, dispatched Muhammad-bin-'Abdan, the Wahhaby, with his two hundred followers, and as many of the ezh-Zhawahir, to attack his uncle. These, after offering up a prayer, set forth and came to a hand-to-hand struggle with Kais^s forces stationed at the Masjid of the Awlad-Muhallal, driving them out from thence and pursuing them as far as the burial- ground on the plateau of the mountains of the lesser Wadi, killing some of them. Thereupon a large body of Kais's men rushed out against them from the Wadi, putting the Wahhabis and the ezh-Zhawahir to flight as far as the278 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. house of Salim-bin-'Abdallahj the Wahhaby. In this en counter six of the pursued and seven of the pursuers were slain. Then Kais marched with his force against Sidab, descend ing upon it from the heights overlooking the dye-house. On reaching level ground they rushed to the 'Akabah of Sidab and seized it. Some of then ascended the mountain of es-Saaly, until they approached the stockade commanding Waljat, which at that time was held by a number of Be- looches, the followers of the Mullah-el-Hajj, who thereupon evacuated it. Kais's party, however, were still separated from the stockade by the ditches which existed below it. (These ditches were the work of the Portuguese during their rule at Maskat. Their object was to prevent the Arabs coming down upon them from the heights of es- Saaly to the outskirts of the town.) The post of the fugitive Belooches, by order of Seif-bin-'Aly and Bedr-bin- Seif, was then occupied by Suleiman-bin-Ahmed, el-Harasy, the Sahib of Jamma, with some of the Benu-^Ammah and his slaves, who prevented Kais's party from removing the stockade. A constant fire of musketry was kept up on both sides day and night. A force of seven hundred men of the Benu-^Utbah 1 came at this time to the assistance of the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan; most of whom were musketeers, and a detachment of them was stationed at the stockade, which left Suleiman- bin-Ahmed, el-Harasy, at liberty to return to the ^Akabah ot Killabuh. Meanwhile the Benu-^Utbah and Kais's party maintained their opposite musketry fire without intermis sion ; then rain fell for several days successively, and both sides in the general war were about equally matched. Kais, with his principal men, was at Sidab, in the house of Nasir- bin-Suleiman-bin-Milflih, ed-Dallal. 1 Or Benu-Uttub, see note 1, p. 227. The two names are synony mous.sa'id-din-sultan. 279 Then sheikh Muhamraad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, came from ezh-Zhahirah with a force of Hadhr and Arabs, amounting 1 , according to the best authorities, to twelve thousand men, under the command of the sheikh Hamid-bin-Nasir, el- Ghafiry, and encamped with them at Nuaman. The Seyyid Said went out to see them, and they engaged to join him against his uncle. He accordingly accompanied them to es-Sib and invested its fort, and then opened fire upon it with a gun brought in a ship from Barkah. When they had de molished one side of the fort, the garrison capitulated, sur rendering the fort to the Seyyid Said, who thereupon left it in charge of one of his officers. There was an enclosure at es-Sib belonging to the Benu-Haya, from which they began to open a musketry fire upon Hamid-bin-Nasir's men. Refusing to obey the Seyjdd Said's order to desist, ho permitted the ezh-Zhawahir to attack them, which they accordingly did, scaling the walls, and then putting to death all who were within. Old and young they numbered seventy persons. From es-Sib the Seyyid Said marched with his force to Finja, which he surrounded, and after cutting down manv of their date-trees the people submitted to him. From thence he went to Badbad, where he was joined by a large body of the Nizariyyah of the Wadi-Semail, under Sirhan- bin-Suleiman, el-Jary. The fort at that time was held, on behalf of Kais, by Nasir-bin-Said, es-Sammar, with a number of the Benu-'Ammah, the el-Habiish, and others. Seeing himself surrounded on all sides, Nasir asked for quarter, offering to surrender the fort. He accordingly made it over, through Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, his garrison leaving it without their arms; and the Seyyid Said-bin- Sultan, after placing it in charge of the sheikh Muhammad- bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, returned with his force to es-Sib. Hamid-bin-Nasir having thus had an opportunity of seeing the Nizariyyah pf tho Wadi-Semail, remarked to the280 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Seyyid Said; ' I had no idea that the Nizariyyah of the Wadi-Semail were so numerous; whosoever has such a force at his disposal may dispense with all other aid.' The Seyyid Said then wrote to Bedr-bin-Seif, who was at Maskat at the time, to the following effect: 'You have doubtless heard of our proceedings and of our success; but how comes it that you have taken no part in the war with the forces at your command (Prior to this communication another contingent of the Benu-^Utbah had reached Bedr, in addition to the five hundred of that tribe who had already joined him. Three hundred men of the people of ; Asailwah, the adherents of the sheikh Seif, had also been added to his available force.) After reading the Seyyid Said^s letter, Bedr forthwith ordered Seif-bin-'Aly-bin-Muhammad to attack es-Sedd, while the^Benu-Yezid and the Benu-Saadah were to lie in ambush for the garrison of the tower of ed-Dauhah in the house of Muhammad-el-Kathiry. He also ordered Hilal-bin-Hamdan to attack the 'Akabah oi Kiyam, which was then held for Kais by the Benu-er-Ris. Hilal having succeeded in taking the 'Akabah, and Seif- bin-^Aly in seizing es-Sedd, the latter proceeded with a part of his force to Riyam, reinforced by a great many of the Wahhabis, and also of the Benu-Yas, the followers of Hazzaa, besides contingents from the el-Manasir and from all the Nizariyyah of Jaalan. After a cannonade from the ships, he ordered the Benu-'Utbah to storm the wall of the Luwatiyah, and to kill all who fell in their way. He further directed the Zidgal to seize the heights surrounding el-Matrah. Then, as he was about to ascend the 'Akabat- el-Khail to descend with his force upon el-Matrah, he was met by ^Aly-bin-Hilal-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed], who had come from that place by edh-Dhait, accompanied by the sheikh Khamis -bin-Salim, el-Hashimy, who addressed him in these terms ; Do not be so hasty to fight, for the man ^ ou aic fighting against is your uncle, and an uncle is like a father.sa'id-bin-sultan. 281 We have come to arrange matters between you and him.' This expostulation calmed his indignation, and ^Aly-bin- Hilal remained with him, while the sheikh Khamis-bin- Salim returned to el-Matrah. On reaching that place he went forthwith to Kais, and spoke to him as follows: 'I have seen that Bedr has a large force, which you will be unable to resist. Moreover, as regards your own army, externally they are in your interests, but inwardly they are against you. Of course, you have heard what your nephew has effected at es-Sib, and Finja, and at Bddbad. He is now encamped at es-Sib, and in your unfortunate position you are like the man who ran after a bird to catch it.' Mu- hammad-bin-Khalfan spoke to the same effect, as did also Rashid-bin-Said, el-Makhashily, who said to Kais: 'You have no soldiers remaining but me and your slaves : dispose of us as you please; nevertheless, if you desire peace, let it be negotiated by Khamis-bin-Salim, for he is wholly devoted to your interests.' While they were discussing these matters they heard the roar of musketry proceed ing from es-Sedd, followed by a messenger from el-Falj, announcing that Seif-bin-'Aly, with the ezh-Zhawahir and the el-Manasir, had attacked and taken it, and had, more over, seized the castle and plundered all the people whom they found there. On hearing this, Kais said to Khamis : ' Arrange matters betwixt me and them;' whereupon the latter went back to Bedr, whom he found on the summit of the 'Akabat-el-Khail. He started in a small boat before 'Aly-bin-HilaPs return to el-Matrah. In the mean time, Bedr had been joined by men of the Benu-Rasib, who mingled with the followers of Salim-bin-^Aly, et-Temamy, and those of Khadim-bin-Muhammad, el-Hashimy, and they urged him, saying: ' Let us attack el-M£trah.' On the arrival of the sheikh Khamis, he said to them: ' As my uncle refuses to surrender the fort to us without war, I shall lead you to the attack;' then turning to the sheikh 36282 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. Khamis, he asked what he had to say. The sheikh replied: ' I think the better course would be for you to accompany me with ten men to the date-plantation of the sheikh Khalfan, where I have also requested your uncle to come with five attendants only, in order that we may make peace/' Bedr accordingly went, taking with him one hun dred of the people of Jaalan, but on seeing that his uncle had only five men with him he selected a like number from his escort, and bade the remainder to halt where they were. Through the medium of the sheikh Khamis peace was con cluded between the two parties, on condition that the fort of el-Matrah should be immediately surrendered to Bedr-bin- Seif. That was accordingly done, and Bedr placed the fort in charge of a man of the es-Sakasik, named Sam. Kais re mained at el-Matrah three days longer, and then embarked with his men for Sohar on board an English ship. Bedr wrote an account of all these proceedings to the Seyyid Said, who approved of them; whereupon the latter dismissed the people of Semiiil, and taking with him the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir and the men of ezh-Zhahirah he went to Barkah, from whence he wrote to Bedr to send him forty thousand dollars for the troops. Bedr borrowed the money from the merchants and sent it by Mubarak-bin- Said, the Maula of the el-Jibur. On his arrival he made some of his men march before him, carrying the money, and delivered it to Hamid-bin-Nasir; but, according to another account, Mubarak took the money to the Seyyid Said, who was then at es-Sib with the ezh-Zhawahir, and the Seyyid himself gave it to the Hamid-bin-Nasir, whereupon the latter and his followers returned to ezh-Zhahirah. Thus terminated the war between the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan, and Bedr-bin-Seif and their uncle Kais. A reconciliation was also effected between the Seyyids and Muhammad-bin- Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, the Wakil. After this an estrangement took place between the SeyyidSA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 283 Said and Bcdr-bin-Seif, the cause of which was as follows: Bedr wished to remove the Belooches of Mullah-el-Hajj from the AV^ estern fort and to substitute the Belooches of Jamma in their stead j but his nephews and the daughter of the Imam would not agree to the arrangement. Thereupon he went to Barkah and garrisoned the fort with Wahhabis, giving the command to Suleiman-bin-Seif-bin-Said, ez-Zamily. One day Sahm-bin-Sultan, after leaving el-MasnaaL, on his way to Maskat, put up at the Masjid built by Khasif-bin-Khamis bin-Hamaduh, el-Wahiby, but Bedr did not come to see him, neither did he pay him any attention. So Salim sent for Suleiman and ordered him to take a note of the bread, sweetmeats, fodder, and so forth that he wanted for his men and animals; whereupon Suleiman said: u I dare not do anything of the kind without the orders of Bedr, whose agent 1 am; but he is himself in the fort, therefore send one of your men to him for whatever you require. He has given me no orders, and without his orders I can do nothing, for, as you know, 'the house is entered by the door.' ' This reply so incensed Salim that he broke a stick in beating him on the back, and after he had dismissed him he put off his journey to Maskat and returned to el-Masnaah. Bedr, on hearing from Suleiman what had occurred, ordered horsemen to make ready, intending to overtake Salim and make him apologize, but Rashid-bin- Hamid, en-Naimy, who was with him at the time, dissuaded . him from the attempt. This incident embittered the es trangement between Bedr and the sons of Sultan. Subsequently Bedr proposed to the Seyyid [Said] that they should make war upon their uncle Kais, on the ground that he had wronged them by taking the fort of el-Khabu- rah, urging that unless he was made to restore it he would never cease intriguing against them until he got possession of all the fortified posts which they now held. The best plan, he suggested, would be to order Malik-bin-Seif, el-281 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Yaaruby, to attack Behla, they assisting him with arms and ammunition ; ' for/' said he, ' that fort and the castles of Nezwa and of all 'Oman [proper] are at present under the authority of our uncle Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, who is alto gether alienated from us, and one with our uncle Kais. Should Behla fall to us, the castle of Nezwa and all the other posts throughout 'Oman will be surrendered to us, and Kais's game will be effectually stopped, especially if we also succeed in. getting possession of the fort of el-Khaburah, for then we shall be able to exercise authority over all the Arabs of the coast, and the inhabitants of 'Oman will at once submit to us.' The Seyyid Said approving of the proposal, Bedr wrote to Malik-bin-Seif directing him to commence hostilities against Behla, and furnished him with means for the undertaking. Malik had with him Muham- mad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, with two hundred men of Nakhl, and these on being joined by the el-'Obriyyin and the Benu-Shakil surrounded the fort of Behla. In the mean time Bedr wrote to the Nizar of ezh-Zhahirah and to the el-Yemeniyyah of es-Sharkiyyah to join him. The first to arrive was the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih, el-Harithy, and the sheikh Said-bin-Majid, el-Barwany, el-Harithy, with five hundred men of the el-Harth and their respective followers; these remained with Bedr at Barkah. He then wrote to Malik-bin-Seif to make over the command of the siege to Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, who thereafter directed the opera tions in concert with Malik-bin-Kashid, el-Yaaruby. The services of the esh-Shakily were dispensed with, and Ma- lik-bin-Seif, agreeably with the instructions which he had received, went to join Bedr at Barkah. The fort of Behla at this time was held by a garrison of the Benu-Hinay, on behalf of Muhammad-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed]. As soon as Malik-bin-Seif reached Bedr, the latter wrote to Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, to meet him with all his forces at el-Khaburah, while he himself, accompanied bysa'id-bin-sultan. 285 Ililal-bin-Hdmed, of the Al-Bu-Said, went to the Seyyids Said and Salim and prevailed upon them not to go with him. When he reached el-Khaburah he was joined by a great many of the Arabs of the coast, and encamped with them above the fort. Malik-bin-Seif he posted near his own camp, and the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih, with his men of the el-Harth, westward of the fort. Then came the sheikh Hamid-bin-Zhalam, el-Wahiby, with many of the Al-Wahi- bah, who were posted next to the encampment of the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih. Bedr now awaited the arrival of the sheikh Hamid-bin-Nasir, and in the mean time he was joined by the Benu-Kelban, who encamped with the multitude. On the arrival of Hamid-bin-Nasir, who was accompanied by Ibn- Muaaikal, the Wahhaby, and all the Nizariyyah of ezh- Zhahirah, he said to Bedr: ' Don^t be in a hurry to fight your uncle; we will go to him and advise him also not to fight. Perchance he may surrender the fort to you without hostilities; if so, so much the better; if not, then we will attack him.' Bedr consented to this proposal. Now Hamid in reality did not wish Bedr to fight Kais, fearing lest he might overcome him, and thereby acquire a predominance over 'Oman, and be further supported by the Wahhabis, who were strongly in his favour. Hamid accord- ingly set out with his force to Sohar, leaving only the Benu- Kelban contingent at el-Khaburah. Malik-bin-Seif also accompanied him with some of his men, the rest remaining behind with the Benu-Kelban. The Benu-Haras, the people ol Jamma, joined the latter, as did also the el-Masakarah, and they encamped close to the encampmentof Ibn-Muaaikal, the Wahhaby. Subsequently, the sheikh-Said-bin-Majid, el-Barwany, with a detachment of his men, joined Malik- bin-Seif's party, both following the leading of Hamid-bin- Nasir. llamid met Kais at Sdham, and addressed him in these terms: '1 have not come to you on a hostile errand, there-28G the imams of 'oman. fore be under no apprehension as regards me. Bedr aims at supreme authority over 'Oman, and is intent on gaining over the people of ezh-Zhahirah and esh-Shamal, as also the Wahhabis, who are already devoted to his interests. As a proof of his ambition, I may recall the fact that in the peace which I arranged betwixt you it was stipulated that you should retain all the fortified forts then in your possession, and that he was not to meddle with them. 1 That treaty is not of old date, it is still quite new, and you have desisted from all hostilities against him, whilst he is determined to promote them against you, deceiving his nephews and at the same time wronging you. Be assured as regards myself and those who are similarly situated; for if we are not against him we shall not be with him.' These words pleased Kais exceedingly. About this time the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih heard that Seif- bin-Thabit, el-Janiby, had arrived from ezh-Zhahirah to co operate against el-Khaburah, and that Hamid-bin-Nasir had engaged him in the expedition. Now there was a violent grudge of old standing between the sheikh 'Isa and Seif- bin-Thabit; so the former placed spies over Seif-bin-Thabit, who on his part was ignorant that Bedr-bin-Seif had enlisted 'Isa, or that he was then at el-Kabdrah. On the return of the spies with a report that Seif-bin-Thabit had only seventy men of the el-Janibah with him, and that he was not far from the camp, ^Isa gave the order and a great many of the el-Harth and of the Arabs of the coast assembled. As he was on the point of starting on this expedition Hamid-bin- Zhalam, el-Wahiby, dissuaded him, saying: ' Desist from your enterprise, seeing that Seif-bin-Thabit has come to fight in the same cause with yourself: he is now an adherent of Hamid-bin-Nasir, who will not brook any injury done to him. Moreover, you know that the sheikh Said-bin-Mujid- bin-Said, with a number of the el-Harth, has gone with 1 Sec page 269.sa'id-bin-sultan. 287 Haimd-bin-Nasir to settle matters amicably between Kais and his nephews, so that if you venture to kill but one man of the el-Jantbah you may rest assured that SaJd-bin-Majid and his men will not escape the vengeance of the Benu- Ghafir. r l hat, in fact, will be the result, whether you suc ceed or fail in your design; therefore I entreat you to restrain your violence,^ Hamid-bin-Zhdlam said much more to the same effect, but ^Isa would not listen to him, and set forth with his followers. When the two parties met, Seif-bin- Thabit conjured 'Isa, in God's name, to desist, but the latter replied : 'We must fight.' So the combatants alighted from theii 1 animals and fought with swords and spears. 'Isa's party were worsted in the engagement, for he lost thirty men killed, and received two spear-wounds himself, while on Seif's side only three fell. The noise of the conflict reaching the combined camp of the Benu-Kelban, of Ibn- Muaaikal, the Wahhaby, the Benu-Haras, (the people of Jamma,) and the el-Masakarah, they started immediately to the assistance of Seif-bin-Thabit, but on reaching him found that the affair was ended. Thereupon they began to upbraid Seif-bin-Thabit for not having appealed to them for aid. He replied: f ' I myself was quite unaware of any such impending conflict until I was suddenly surrounded by the assailants, and God has adjudged the result betwixt us.' ihen the Benu-Kelban dispatched a messenger with a letter informing Hamid-bin-Nasir of what had occurred be tween 'Isa and Seif. The messenger met Hamid and his force at el-Kasabiyyah, on their return from Kais, and after Ifamid had read the letter he made the messenger give him all the details of the affair, halting with his men for that purpose. Thereupon Malik-bin-Seif, el Yaaruby, gave the sheikh Said-bin-Majid-bin- Said a hint to make his escape. 1'e and his men accordingly detached themselves from tho other troops, spurred their camels, and did not come to a halt till they reached Ardh-el-Hadhra, near es-Suwaik.• 288 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Then Hamid-bin-Nasir sent for the Benu-Kelban, and Ibn- Muaikal, and Seif-bin-Thabit, and the Benu-Haras, and the el-Masakarah, and those of Nakhl, who were all encamped above the fort of el-Khaburah, and said to them : ' Let each tribe return to its home, for we have nothing more to do with Bedr and his warfare.' They all followed his advice, and he himself set out for ezh-Zhahirah, and on reaching el-'Ainein dismissed his followers. On Malik-bin-Seifs return to Nakhl he remained there a few days and then proceeded to Behla, by the route of Jebel- el-Akhdar. On reaching that place ^Aly-bin-Talib, acting under the instructions of Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, who thereby sought to promote union between himself and the children of his brother Sultan, made over the fort to him. Then Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, placed Muhammad-bin- Suleiman-bin-Muhammad, el-Yaaruby, as Wali over Behla, while he went back to Nakhl for a few days. On his return however, Muhammad-bin-Suleiman refused to admit him into the fort, saying, ' Nakhl is yours, but Behla is mine.' Malik was therefore obliged to return to Nakhl, while Mu hammad-bin-Suleiman kept possession of the fort, and broke off all communication with Malik. Then Kais-bin-el-Imam set out with a detachment of his men towards ezh-Zhahirah, and obtained Hamid-bin-Nasir^s permission to go to Nezwa. (At this time there was war at Nezwa between the people of Semed and el-^Akr and those inhabiting the outskirts of el-Wadi and el-'Akr, and Hamid thought that Kais intended to reconcile them.) Nezwa was then under Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, who had trans ferred the government to Kais.) Kais remained two days at el-'Ainein as Hamid-bin-Nasir's guest, and on leaving him he started by the way of the Nejd of ezh-Zhahirah. On approaching Yabrin, he dispatched a party of his men— they belonged to the Al-Abi-Karin—against that place, and they killed three of Hamid-bin-Nasir's men belongingsa'id-bin-sultan. 289 to the ed-Duruwwa, and on reaching Nezwa he ordered an attack upon el-'Alayah, and there was a severe conflict be tween his force and the inhabitants. The report of what had occurred at Yabrin coming to the knowledge of Hamid- bin-Nasir, he forthwith began to assemble his forces, and wrote to the el-'Obriyyin, and the Benu-Shakil, and the Benu-Riyam to precede him to Nezwa, and there was a fierce battle between them and the people of el-'Akr, and the el-Hawai'r, and those of Saal, during which Kais-bin-el- Imam left and went to esh-Sharkiyyah and remained there three days, endeavouring to induce its inhabitants to aid him, but finding they were not so disposed he departed for Sohar by el-'Akk. Hamid, on the other hand, went to Behla and mustered its people, and on reaching Nezwa the struggle between him and the inhabitants of el-^Akr, the el-Hawair, and those of Saal waxed hotter. Samh-esh-Shakily also attacked es-Sarujiyyah and was killed, whereupon his fol lowers burnt the walls of the Hujrah and put to death all those who were in it. Thus the war was prolonged between them, when Muhammad-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed] wrote to the garri sons of the castle at Nezwa and its forts to make them over to the Seyyid Said-bin-Sultan, and they accordingly surren dered them to 'Aly-bin-Talib, who took possession on behalf of the Seyyid Said. This put an end to the strife between the people of Nezwa and the Benu-Ghafir. When the Seyyid Said saw how Bedr-bin-Seif was coquet ting with the Wahhabis, the Arabs of Jiialan, the el-Yeme- niyyah, the Nizariyyah, and all the tribes of esh-Sharkiyyah, he became more and more estranged from him, fearing some treachery on his part. He confided his suspicions to Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, but to no one else. He then said to Bedr-bin-Seif : 'We must attack the fort of el-Kha- burah, with the aid of the el-Yemeniyyah, the Arabs of esh- Sharkiyyah, and the Nizariyyah of the Wadi-Semail, without resorting either to the Wahhabis or the people of ezh-Zha- S7290 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. hirah.' Bedr agreed, and wrote accordingly, summoning the esh-Sharkiyyali to come to him immediately. He also wrote to 'Aly-bin-Hilal-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed] to join him with all his men. (At this time 'Aly was not on good terms with Kais and wholly devoted to Bedr.) On the arrival of the tribes he ordered them to encamp in the open plain. Then he was joined by Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, with the two sheiks of the Nizariyyah of the Wadi-Sematl, namely, Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabiry, and Najlm-bin-^Abdallah, es-Seyyaby, with seven hundred men, accompanied by Malik- bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, with one hundred of the people of Nakhl; these were encamped at Nuaman. After they had been there three days the Seyyid Said said to Bedr: 'Muhammad- bin-Nasir has come to us and we have not yet been to greet him. This is not as it should be, for he has answered our appeal and hastened to our assistance.' Bedr approving of the suggestion, he and Said started with their respective escorts, ten men in all. When they reached Nuaman, Muhammad-bin-Nasir and his force alighted, and after they had pressed hands Said and Bedr entered the fort, attended by Khalfan-bin-Muhaisan and his retinue of the el-Jibur. In the mean time Muhammad-bin-Nasir and his men seated themselves close by, Muhammad giving orders that no one should be allowed to approach the fort until the two Seyyids and their attendants came forth. After Said and Bedr, and those who were with them, had been seated in the fort for some time, the subject of swords and daggers was discussed, during which Khalfan-bin-Mu haisan, the Mania of the el-Jibur, drew the dagger of Bedr- bin-Seif from its sheath in a jocose way, whereupon Said drew his sword and commenced threatening to strike him, as if in fun. Suddenly, however, ho stood up and struck Bedr with it, the blow breaking the bone of his arm. Bedr fled forthwith and threw himself from a window of the fort to the ground, exclaiming, ' Help, O men !' The mensa'id-bin-sultan. 291 turned towards him, but Muhammad-bin-Nasir stopped them, saying, 'Let the descendants of the Imam do what they please to one another.' On hearing these words Bedr mounted his horse and set off at full gallop, but on reaching the small cocoa-nut plantation of Nuaman the wound in his arm overcame him, and he fell from his horse to the ground. The Seyyid Said and his followers, who had gone in pursuit, then hurled several lances at him, one of which striking him in a vital part his spirit took flight. Thereupon the Seyyid Said and his horsemen galloped on until they reached the open space where the esh-Sharkiyyah were encamped, and calling out to them he said: ' Hasten to join Bedr, for Muhammad-bin-Nasir and his men have surrounded him.' 'Aly-bin-Hilal and Hilal-bin-Hamed im mediately rose up to go to Nuaman. Then when the Seyyid Said's men had entered the fort they called out to the Wahhabis : ' Go and join Bedr, for Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, and his men have surrounded him.' The Wah habis mounted their horses forthwith, and met the esh- Sharkiyyah, and 'Aly-bin-Hilal, and Hilal-bin-Hamed near the small plantation of cocoa-nuts, where they discovered Bedr dead. At first they decided to attack Muhammad-bin- Nasir, but learning from some peasants that Bedr had been killed by the Seyyid Said and his horsemen they returned to the open plain. On their way back, and as the W ahhabis were passing close to the fort, the Seyyid Said's men, by his order, pointed the muzzles of their guns at them, whereupon they started at once for el-Bereimy. On the Seyyid Said's return to the fort of Barkah he placed some of his most devoted men in it, bidding them to be on their guard, and ordering them to open fire upon any one attempting to enter who did not belong either to him or to his brother. Taking another escort with him he set out for Maskat at noon, and reaching el-Matrah in the afternoon ho sent a messenger to the cs-Saksaky, who held the fort therei,1 : h !'j' t .V 292 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. for Bedr. The messenger forthwith summoned the garrison to leave the fort, adding, ' for the man is dead who placed you there.' They obeyed immediately, whereupon the Seyyid Said committed it to the safe keeping of the Belooches of the Al-Durrah-bin-Jumaah, el-Bel Ashy, and then proceeded with his escort to Mdskat. The inhabitants generally did not hear of the occurrence until the morning of the follow ing day. As to Hilal-bin-Hamed and the esh-Sharkiyyah, when they knew for certain that it was the Seyyid Said who had killed Bedr they returned at once to their respective homes, and Hilal-bin-Hamed-bin-el-Imam went to Habra. After the Seyyid Said's departure for Maskat the notables of Barkah went out and took up the corpse of Bedr, prayed over him, and then buried him in the field. Two days after the Seyyid Said's return to Maskat, Muham- mad-bin-JSTasir, el-Jabry, and Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, and Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabry, and Najtm-bin-'Abdal- lah, es-Seyyaby, arrived there at about sunset, with their respective followers. They halted near the castle of er- lliwayah, and sent a messenger to inform the Seyyid Said of their arrival, and where they were. His written reply was: 'Return this very night to your several homes, for I am apprehensive lest our slaves and soldiers, who have a secret love for Bedr, may attack you. I am also anxious about Semiiil, lest 'Aly-bin-Hilal and his men, and his allies of the el-Yemeniyyah, the Arabs of esh-Sharkiyyah, should invade it.' They quite understood from this reply that he did not want them to remain at M^Lskat, so they all left that same night for their respective districts. Then the Seyyid Said wrote to his uncle Kais apprising him of what he had done to Bedr. (Now it was notorious that Kais hated Bedr intensely on account of his intimacy with the Wahhabis, and for having seceded from the creed of the el-Ibadhiyah to their sect.) Whereupon an open recon ciliation took place between Kais and his brother Sultanas children.sa'id-bin-sultan. 293 A year afterwards the Seyyid wrote to his uncle Kais as follows: 'We must declare war against Sultan-bin-Sakar, el-Kasimy, for he is our common enemy, committing depre dations at sea, and forcibly seizing the boats belonging to your people and mine. Moreover, whenever his boats are short of water, or meet with bad weather, they run into Fakkan for supplies and repairs, and then set off again to commit piracy and murder on the sea. Sultan-bin-Sakar has also built a strong tower, with stone and mortar, at Fakkan; therefore collect your forces, and I will collect mine, and let that place be our rendezvous.' Kais agreed to this proposal. Thereupon the Seyyid Said wrote to the Al-Wahibah, and the el-Hajariyyin, and the el-Harth, and the Benu-Hasan, all which tribes joined him with many men. He also wrote to Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, and the Benu-Haras, the people of Jamma, to come to him without delay. He him self embarked in ships with a part of the Arabs who were with him, the remainder going by land. Kais and his fol lowers went by land, and the conjoined forces surrounded the fortalice at Fakkan, stormed it and killed all, young and old, whom they found in it. When Sultan-bin-Sakar heard of these proceedings he began mustering his forces, and collected a large body of Arabs and Hadhr, estimated at twelve thousand men, whereas the Seyyid^s army only amounted to half that number. When Sultan-bin-Sakar's men approached the 'Akabah and per ceived that it was held by a large body of the Seyyid^s musketeers, they told their leader that it would be impos sible for them to reach Fakkan with such an obstacle before them, urged him not to attack them, and then declared that if within three days the Seyyids^ men did not descend from the 'Akabah they would return home. Now, some of the party who held that post came and informed Kais that Sul tan's men were in force on the other side of the 'Akabah,294 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. stating their belief at the same time that not feeling suffi ciently strong to fight their way up the ascent they would retire without making the attempt. Thereupon Kais said: ' Let us descend, then, for we wish to satisfy our revenge, and if we suffer them to retreat without fighting our object will not be gained.' The force accordingly quitted the 'Akabah during the night, and at dawn next morning Sultan- bin-Sakar's followers, seeing that the position had been evacuated, reported the fact to him, whereupon he ordered them to march up the ^Akabah, which they did, shouting AlldhuAhbar! [God is the most Great!] and then descended on Fakkan, marshalling themselves in front of the Seyyids' forces. Then the fire of the muskets rang, swords were brandished, spears pointed, and daggers reached the hearts of all; and Kais's motley adherents fled, as did also Muham- ham-bin-Matar, the Sahib of el-Fujairah, and none stood by the Seyyid Said but the Al-Wahibah and the el-Hajariyyin; Kais also was deserted by all his men, with the exception of his slaves. These were hard pressed by the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, nevertheless they continued the contest until Muhammad-bin-Khalfan, the Seyyid Said's commander-in-chief, the braves of the el-Hajariyyin and the Al-Wahibah, the Seyyid Kais's slaves, and Kais himself were slain. Whereupon the Seyyid Said retired from the field, embarked in a boat, and got on board one of his ships, in which he sailed for Maskat. When ^Azzan heard of the death of his father Kais, he wrote to Seyyid Said asking him to enter into a covenant to defend him against any attack from Sultan-bin-Sakar, or any other adversaries. The Seyyid Said consented, and supplied him with all necessary munitions of war. The depredations of Sultan-bin-Sakar and his people, both by sea and land, now increased more than ever, in which outrages he was supported by the Wahhabis and an indiscriminate rabble who had joined him, and also by Mu-sa'id-bin-sultan. 295 hammad-bin-Jabir, el-Jalhamy, whose piracies were most extensive. Sultan-bin-Sakar's confederates also made more frequent raids in the neighbourhood of Sohar, 'Azzan going out to prevent them from approaching any of the fortified posts, while the Seyyid Said aided him with men and money. The Seyyid Said's suspicions of Muhammad-bin-Nasir in creasing, he became more and more estranged from him. He wrote to him ordering him to come to Barkah, as he wished to consult him. Muhammad decided to go, but several of his intimate friends dissuaded him. About this time a difference had arisen betwixt him and Sirhan-bin- Suleiman, el-Jabry, which kept him from asking Sirhan's advice, and led him to show more attention to the Benu- Iluwahah. When Sirhan heard of his decision he remarked to some of his principal men: 'If Muhammad-bin-Nasir comes within the Seyyid Said's reach, the latter will seize him in order to deprive him of the forts of Semiiil and Bud- bad ; but as he has seen fit not to consult me, and has taken the Benu-Ruwahah into his confidence, neglecting me, I shall not intrude my advice upon him.' Muhammad accordingly set out, accompanied by several of his men, and after halting at Nuaman three days proceeded on his visit to the Seyyid. Meanwhile, the latter had given secret instructions to some of his officers to seize Muhammad when he entered the fort. They did so, and delivered him over to the jailor to be bound. Then the Seyyid, accom panied by a party of the Benu-Hasan and about five hundred of the Arabs of Barkah and its environs, started off, taking him with them, and on reaching Biidbad he surrendered its fort to the Seyyid. From thence they carried him to Sanir, where they halted. The report of the Seyyid having seized Muhammad becoming known at Semail, where Sirhan then was, the latter went to Sarur and had an interview with the Seyyid. As he had taken a strong party of the Benu-Jabir and others with him the Seyyid fancied at first that he had296 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. come with a hostile intent, on account of Muhammad-bin- Nasir; but perceiving that Sirhan was most deferential in his manner, and made no allusion to Muhammad, he received him with all courtesy, and dismissed him with a shower of attentions. Thereupon the Seyyid and his force moved with Muhammad-bin-Nasir to Semail, the fort of which the latter was obliged to surrender to him. When the Seyyidah, the daughter of the Imam, heard of Muhammad^s seizure by her nephew Said, Muhammad^s wife, the daughter of Jabr-bin- Muhammad, who was with her at the time, said to her, ' Is this the respect which I meet with at your hands ? You have seized Muhammad since you invited me to come to you, and on my arrival I learn what treatment he has received. I now begin to fear for his life.' The daughter of the Imam re plied ; ' No; we do not want his life : all we require is the surrender of the forts of Semail and Badbad, which must be restored. They were given in trust only to Muhammad by Said, and the trust belongs to the rightful owners.' The Imam's daughter, taking Jabr's daughter with her, then went to Semail and released Muhammad, the Seyyid Said giving him the choice of residing either atel-Hufry or Maskat. He chose the former. Thereupon Muhammad said to Said: ' I have several trusts which I have confided to different people here, and debts owing to me by others, pray allow me to remain in the neighbourhood of Semail for a few days to settle these affairs;' to which request the Seyyid assented. After the Seyyid had left for Maskat, and Muhammad had got in some of his trusts and monies, he sent Bint-Jabr [his wife] to et- Tau, and directed her to remain there. Then he ordered his servants to bring up the animals, and on mounting his camel to start he was attended by the principal Nizariyyah of Semail and the head men of el-Yemeniyyah, their allies, who accompanied him, conversing all the way until they reached the aqueduct of the gardens, when suddenly he38 SA ID-BIN-SULTAN. 297 said : ' Peace be with you; return home ; deliverance from God is near.' Then, spurring his camel, he took the road of the Wadi-el-'Akk, much to the surprise of his attendants, who believed that he had intended returning to Semail. How ever, he urged his camels forward by night and day until he reached el-^Ainein, in ezh-Zhahirah, where he alighted at the house of Hamid-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad, el-Ghafiry, and informed him fully of all that had befallen him at the hands of the Seyyid Said-bin-Sultan. Then Hamid said to him : t( I have only the forts of el-Ghabby, and Yabrin, and Azka at my disposal: take which of these you please as a gift.' He chose that of Azka, and went thither and placed his slaves and some of his friends of the Nizariyyah in it, and then returned to Hamid-bin-N^sir, with whom he spent a few days, and then proceeded to ed-Dir^iyyah. When the Seyyid Said heard of his movements he re marked ; ' He will cause us trouble yet, owing to the grudge which he has againstus. God does as He pleases, and the result rests with Him.' On reaching el-Kasim, Muhammad stayed there a few days, and then, taking some of its people with him, proceeded to ed-Dir'iyyah, where he met Siivld-bin-^Ab- du-'l-^Aziz. 1 After pressing hands, Suud inquired of the men of el-Kasim about Muhammad; he had heard of him, but had never seen him before. They replied : ' This is the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad, el-Ghafiry; he has come to you from ^Oman on business.' Sudd then welcomed him, and after Muhammad had complained of the treatment which he had received at the hands of the Seyyid Said, SuAd said to him: ' Be of good cheer, for I will dispatch Mutlak- el-Mutairy to aid and support you against all those in ^Oman or elsewhere upon whom you may wish him to make war,' ^Abdu-'l-'Aziz 2 then gave Mutlak-el-Mutairy the following 1 The second Wahhaby Anair of that name. He succeeded his father, 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, the son of Su'ud I., who was assassinated by a Persian, A.D. 1803. 2 Su'nd-ibn-'Abdu-'l-'Aziz is undoubtedly meant.298 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. order; ' Precede Muhammad-bin-Nasir into ^Otnan, and make arrangements to subdue all such as may disobey my commands, and do every thing in your power to support Muhammad-bin-Nasir. ,, The latter accordingly remained with Suud, while Mutlak set out for ^Oman. On reaching el- Bereiray he convened all the esh-Shamal Arabs and attacked Shinas, 1 the fort of which he captured, and then placed it in charge of Muhammad-bin-Ahmed, et-Tinjy. On Muhammad-bin-Nasir's return to 'Oman he wrote to Mutlak, advising him to attack Sohar. Whereupon the latter called upon the Benu-Naim and Kutb, the ezh-Zhawa- hir, and all the Arabs of the neighhourhood of el-Bereimy to join him forthwith. Having mustered a large force he descended upon Sohar and surrounded it. Sohar was still held by 'Azzan-bin-Kais, but being attacked with small-pox at the time of the siege he had appointed the Seyyid Said to act as his deputy. Said accordingly opposed the Wah- habis with what forces he had, while Mutlak was joined by Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, both bringing large contingents, insomuch that he is said to have had a disposable army of three thou sand men; but finding that he could not effect an entrance into Sohar he marched with his forces to the sea-coast. On approaching el-Masnaah they ascended the Wadi-el- Miiawal, and when they reached el-'Arik they attacked and stormed its Hujrah, killing all those who held it, excepting such as effected their escape. Proceeding to Afy, Mutlak encamped in the open country, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir occupied a house at ezh-Zhahir. At this juncture Malik-bin- Seif, el-Yaaruby, joined them, whereupon the garrison of the outer Hujrah fled, leaving nearly all their stores behind them, and took refuge in the Hujrat-esh-Sheikh. Therc- 1 Shines is situated on the el-Batinah coast, about thirty-five miles to the northward of Sohar. Wellsted describes it as ' a small town, with a fort and a shallow lagoon, affording anchorage for small boats.'SA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 299 upon Malik-bin-Seif opened fire upon them with a gun which he had brought from Nakhl and posted in the outer Hujrah. Then one of the Nizariyyah, with a party of the Nakhl people, having seized the market-place of ezh-Zhahir, there was a hand-to-hand fight between Mdtlak's forces and the el- Maawal, which resulted in the submission of the latter to Malik-bin-Seif, whom they solemnly swore to obey. After he had sent back the gun to Nakhl, Muhammad-bin-Nasir and Miitlak-el-Mutairy, with their respective forces, went to Semiiil, and surrounded the inhabitants of the el-'Alayat, drove them from their posts on the heights and seized their Hujrahs, plundering them of all that they contained. Most of the posts they destroyed; the remainder they made over to the Benu-Jabir. Then Mutlak and Hamid-bin-Nasir left by way of el-'Akk, and when they reached el-''Ainein, Hamid remained there and Mutlak went on to el-Bereimy. Mean while, Muhammad-bin-Nasir's force invested the fort of Semliil, he himself taking up his residence in the house which he had built at Sittal. (The fort at that time was held, on behalf of the Seyyid Said, by 'Ismail, the Belooch; he belonged to the Al-Durrah-bin-Jumaah, el-Belushy, and had a garrison with him consisting of eighty Belooches and twenty of the Seyyid Said's manumitted slaves. Attached to them also was a man of the Alayat-Semiiil, named Dzuhail -bin-Salim, edz-Dzuwaiby, who was employed in carrying intelligence to the beyyid Said respecting the gar rison and the movements of M^uhammad-bm-Nasir s foices. He used to mix with them at night, and was never recog nized. One day he came to the Seyyid, and said : ' Send an energetic man to the fort, for the Belooches and sln\ cs ha\ o lost heart, and many of them having died ot small-pox and dropsy I fear lest they may be compelled to surrender to Muhammad-bin-Nasir.' Just at this time 'Aly-bin-Talib- bin-Muhenna, Al-Bu-Saidy, happened to have come on a visit to the Seyyid Said. He was the Seyyid's Wali at Nezwa,300 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. which he had left for Sur, from whence he embarked for Maskat. The Seyyid Said thereupon ordered him and Dzuhail-bin-Salim to proceed forthwith to Semail, and to stir up the garrison of the fort to be on the alert. After reaching Finja they started by night, and made their way safely into the fort, without being detected by the investing forces of Muhammad-bin-Nasir. 'Aly then began to urge the garrison to vigilance and perseverance, but as they com plained of want of provisions and warlike stores, 'Aly dispatched Dzuhail back to apprise the Seyyid of the state of affairs. Thereupon the latter summoned the el-Hajariy- yin, and the Benu-Hasan, and several of the el-Yemeniyyah of esh-Sharkiyyah, and on their arrival he proceeded with them by way of Sakhnan to Semail, taking with him large supplies of provisions and ammunition, which were laden on their own animals and on others belonging to the Arabs of Barkah and its neighbourhood. On reaching the ^Alayat-Semail a part of them engaged the force of Muhammad-bin-Nasir located in its towers, while the remainder made for the fort, and succeeded in carrying in all the supplies which they had brought with them. The Seyyid Said then endeavoured to inspirit them, and having deprived them of all reasonable excuse by providing them with all they had asked for he placed 'Aly-bin-Talib in command, directing them to obey him implicitly. This done, to the satisfaction of both parties, the Seyyid Said and his escort set out on their return, taking the same road by which they had come. On reaching Sakh nan they became aware of the presence of some of Muham- mad-bin-Nasir^s men, who began to fire upon them from the heights, where they had been placed in ambush. On attain ing Finja the Seyyid learnt that two of his followers were missing. Frem thence he went to Maskat and then dismissed the remainder. Muhammad-bin-Nasir was greatly incensed with the people of Finja and el-Khatm for the part they had taken in thissa'id-bin-sultan. 301 matter, and he accordingly ordered his cavalry to attack them, accompanied by many of the Benu-Jabir and the es- Seyyabiyyin. On their approach to el-Khatm the people of that place and those of Finja encountered them, fighting with muskets, and several were killed on both sides; after which the assailants retired. Then Muhammad-bin-Nasir built a lofty tower at Sakhnan and garrisoned it with a number of the Benu-Julanda and others, ordering them to stop up the road with stones, thereby closing it against all messengers from the fort at Semail, and also against any messengers from Finja to them, except by way of el-Maltaka and Sarur. By this means the Seyyid Said was prevented from receiving any intelligence respecting the fort at Semail. Thereupon he wrote to 'Azzan- bin-Kais to join him with his forces at the Wadi-el-Maawal, in order to aid him in a subsequent attack upon Nakhl. His object thereby was so to occupy Malik-bin-Seif as to detach him from Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and to cut off the people of Nakhl from Nakhl, just as Malik had cut him off from that place when he joined Miltlak-el-Mutairy and Muhammad- bin-Nasir against the el-Maawal. (Malik was at this time at Semail, and had with him some of his Nakhl men.) When ^Azzan and his troops reached the el-Maawal he encamped at Maslamat, and was received with rapture by the people, who readily joined him, and marched with him by night towards Nakhl. They crossed the Jebel-Alban, and then descended to el-Gharidh, where shots were exchanged be tween them and the inhabitants, but they hastened forward to Nakhl, entered it by the Bab-esh-Shaghah, and encamped in the open space, destroying a portion of the town wall, and cutting down some of the date-trees. They remained there three days and then retired to Sohar. Of the people of Nakhl the only casualty was Salim-bin-'Abdallah-bin- Muhammad, er-Ruwaishidy; 'Azzan lost six men killed. This affair greatly embittered the relations between the people of Nakhl and the el-Maawal.302 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Then 'Aly-bin-Talib and Dzuhail left tbe fort of Semiiil by night, and taking the el-'Akk road descended from Kahzah to Hatat. On reaching the Seyyid Said they informed him that the garrison had been greatly weakened by the pro tracted siege, and urged him to commence hostilities against Muhammad-bin-Nasir. They returned by the same route, and on reaching the fort communicated the welcome news that deliverance was at hand, for that the Seyyid Said was coming to the rescue with a large force. Then the Seyyid Said wrote to the el-Hajariyyin, the Benu-Hasan, and the el-Harth to join him in force; he also wrote to ^Azzan to bring infantiy and horse. When the above-named tribes reached Maskat he marched with them to Barkah, and en- cairiped there in the open plain. 'Azzan also joined him with his infantry and cavalry, and, besides these, large levies of the coast Arabs from el-Masnaah as far as the Jebel-el- ^Omariyyah. When all these were assembled he started with them to Badbad, from whence he went to reconnoitre Muhammad-bin-Nasir^s forces at Sariir, and learnt that they consisted of three hundred of the el-'Awamir and one hundred of the Benu-Jabir ; further, that Salim-bin-Thany, el-Jabiry, who had separated from him, the Seyyid Said, had also joined him, and was then their commander. The day after, the Seyyid Said attacked them suddenly, 'killing eighty of Muhammad-bin-Nusir's followers, most of them people of Sarur; Salim-bin-Thany was also among the slain. Thereupon the Seyyid ordered the tower in the Wadi- Sariir to be razed, and he sent the sheikh Said-bin-Majid to the inhabitants to offer them the alternative of war or submission. They submitted with eagei'ness, and pledged themselves to withdraw from Muhammad-bin-Nasir's allegi ance. Najim-bin-^Abdallah, es-Seyyaby, also came to solicit an amnesty on his own and his people's part. After taking a pledge from them, as in the case of the people of Sarur, the Seyyid Said returned to Maskat and 'Azzan to Sohar.sa'id-bin-sultan. 303 When Muhamraad-bin-Nasir heard of all the occurrences he pressed forward the siege of Semailj and wrote to the principal men of 'Oman, and to the Hadhr and Arabs of that province who were in alliance with him, to come to him without delay. Thereupon 'Aly-bin-Talib left the fort at night and went to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and asked him for a safe conduct to go to the Seyyid Said, promising to surrender the fort at the expiration of a certain number of days, unless the Seyyid came to its relief. To this Muham mad consented. On reaching the Seyyid, 'Aly informed him of the weak ened state of the garrison : small-pox and dropsy had car ried off many of them, provisions were running short, and they were already negotiating for surrendering the fort to Muhammad. bin-Nasir, on condition of their being allowed to take their arms with them. ' When I learnt all this,' con tinued 'Aly, ' I induced them to wait until I had applied to you; but as I could not make my way to you I was obliged to have recourse to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, to whom I said so-and-so, and thus the matter stands until my return; there fore I entreat you to hasten to their relief.' On receiving this report the Seyyid Said wrote forthwith to the Benu-Hasan and the el-Hajariyyin; also to the Be- looches and the Zidgal under his jurisdiction in the territory of Mekran, and got together a large army, to which he added the Arabs of the coast from es-Sib to el-Masnaah, and on reaching Biidbad, Najim-bin-'Abdallah, es-Seyyaby, joined him with three hundred men ; the people of Sartir he excused from accompanying him. He then marched with his army to Hassas and there encamped, ordering Walid- el-Hinay to attack the el-Hajir with his musketeers. Walid accordingly ascended the Jebel-el-Hajir, which overlooks the Benu-Mazrua and the Benu-Haras, while the Seyyid con cealed the Belooches and Zidgal in a spot near el-Khubar, and ordered the remainder to attack the Benu-Mujdllib and304 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. the Benu-Haras. Intelligence of these movements reaching Muhammad-bin-Nasir, who was then at Sital, he ordered his force under Malik-bin-Seif, el Yaaruby, to fall upon the Seyyid Said's encampment at el-Khubiir and Hassas, while Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el-Jabiry, and Rashid-bin-Said-bin Muhammad, el-Jabiry, with their respective troops attacked Walid-el-Hinay's party and drove them from the mountain, killing Walid. Then Seif-bin-Thabit, el-Janiby, reached the field, and there was a fierce contest between the two armies, the Seyyid Said's followers taking to flight, while Malik-bin-Seif, el Yatlruby, and his men rushed on the Be- looches and Zidgal, killing most of them. Thereupon the Seyyid returned to Maskat and dispatched the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Hilal, el-'Alawy, and the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Seif-bin-Said, ez-Zamily, to conclude a peace between him and Muhammad-bin-Nasir, at any pecuniai'y sacrifice, but not to include the surrender of the forts of Semail and Badbad, and to call upon Najim-bin-'Abdallah, es-Seyyaby, on their way, to aid them in the negotiations. When they reached Badbad, Najim sent them provisions, and after they had eaten he accompanied them on the way to Hassas, and there left them to proceed on their journey. Now, Muhammad-bin-Nasir had placed a party of the el- Janabah and ed-Duruwwa near es-Sammar. (The ed-Du- ruwwa had an old grudge against the Benu-'Aly, and the sheikh Suleiman-bin-Hilal was not aware that they had joined the el-Janabah when the latter went to Semail). So when the deputies were near Hassas, the men in ambush rushed out upon them, killed the sheikh Suleiman-bin- Hilal, and took the sheikhs Suleiman-bin-Seif and Said-bin- Majid, el-Harithy, bound to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, who was at that time at Sital with a large force. When Najim-bin- 'Abdallah heard of this occurrence he hastened to Muham mad-bin-Nasir and urged him to liberate them, but the latter refused to do so, unless the forts of Semail and Badbad weresa'id-bin-sultan. 305 surrendered to him. Theu one of Muhammad's officers said to Najim : ' If you want to effect their release, get Sulei- man-bin-Seif to write a letter, in the Seyyid Said's behalf, to the garrison at Semiiil, directing them to evacuate the fort, taking their arms with them. If they consent, I will guarantee the release of your friends ; if not, matters must remain as they are.' Suleiman wrote accordingly, but when the letter reached the garrison they said : ' the fort is not to be surrendered through paper and ink, but at the sword's point. There can be nothing but war betwixt us and Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir.' On the return of the messenger with this reply, Najim-bin-'Abdallah again pressed Muhammad- bin-Nasir—this time successfully—to release Suleiman-bin- Seif and Said-bin-Miljid, and they left with Najim for Maskat, where the Seyyid Said then was. When they had recounted all that had taken place, the Seyyid remarked to the two deputies : ' I suspect that but for the sheikh Najim's intervention Muhammad-bin-Nasir would have mur dered you.' They thought it most likely, and therefore solicited that some token of regard should be awarded to their deliverer. The Seyyid accordingly dismissed Najim- bin-'Abdallah with substantial proofs of his generosity and affection, and thereupon suspended hostilities against Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, in the hope that the latter would ab stain from pressing on the siege at Semail. Therein, how ever, he was mistaken, and no succour reaching the garri son they surrendered it to Muhammad-bin-Nasir, some of the men making their way back to Maskat, among whom were 'Ismail-el-BelAshy, the captain over his Beloochee coun trymen, and el-Masku, the captain over the slaves. These the Seyyid ordered to be confined, and both died in prison. Thus did Muhammad become master over Semail, and the Benu-Ruwahah and other tribes submitted to him. The Seyyid Said's anger against Muhammad-bin-Nasir, and also against Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, for having co- 39306 the imams of 'oman. operated with him in the capture of the fort was now excited to the highest pitch, and he was induced to dispatch his brother, Salim-bin-Sultan, to seek the aid of the Shah of Persia against his opponents in 'Oman. On the arrival of the Seyyid Salim with his retinue at Shiraz, he received every attention from the Shah : dishes of fruit and food were sent every morning and evening for their use; never theless, the Shah neither came to visit him nor asked him to the royal presence, but one of the Wazirs waited upon him every day and had a long talk with him. The Wazir's message was always to this effect: ' The Shah sends you many compliments and is most anxious to pay you a visit, and also to receive you, but he is at present very much en gaged with Persian, Turkish, and Christian ambassadors on matters which require his personal attention. 1 When he has settled their affairs he will accord you whatever you require, and in the mean time you shall be treated with every respect and attention.' This man was a Kadhi from Syria, well versed in jurisprudence and other sciences, and 1 Succeeding events narrated in this history, and which are also briefly chronicled in the Bombay Government Records, enable me to fix the date of the Seyyid SsUim's visit to Shiraz between 1808-9, during the reign of Fath-'Aly-Shah. Writing in 1815, Sir John Malcolm, then our Minister Plenipotentiary there, says: ' The Court of Persia lias, within the last fifteen years, been again visited by the ambassadors of European nations. The power which the sovereign of that country possessed to check the Affghans, who threatened to invade India, and his ability to aid in repelling the ambitious views of France, if ever directed to that quarter, led the Governor-General of the British possessions in the East to form an alliance with Futteh Aly Khan immediately after he was raised to the throne.' Subsequently, the friendship of the King of Persia was courted by Buonaparte, to enable him to attempt his cherished project of invading India. 'The Court of London took considerable alarm at these proceedings : and the efforts that were deemed necessary to counteract them have led to a more direct intercourse with the Govern ment of Persia, which has, within the space of five years, been honoured with two embassies from the King of England.' History of Persia, vol. ii. pp. 315-317.SA J D-B1N-SULTAN. 307 whenever he conversed with the Seyyid Salim he spoke in pure Arabic. His name was el-Mirza. 1 Among the 'Omany Kadhis in the Seyyid Salim's retinue was Nasir-bin-Suleiman, el-'Adiwy, el-Maiily, to whom the Persian Kadhi who waited upon the Seyyid used to say every day : ' I have visited you again and again and you have not come to see me: I shall be honoured by your visit.' (Now, this said Mirza was known to entertain great enmity towai'ds the Ihadhiijah, although he was careful to conceal it, and manifested nothing but affectionate courtesy towards the Seyyid Salim and to Nasir-bin-Suleiman. He had, moreover, written to tell the Shah that the arrivals from 'Oman were Khawdrij [schismatics] from the true reli gion, whom it was not right that he should assist, and re commending that they should be put off with promises from day to day until they got disgusted and returned to their homes.) At length Nasir said, in reply to his repeated solicitations, 'I will call upon you to-morrow at your court, God willing. Where do you sit in judgment?' The an swer was : ' Close to the Shah's fort.' When the Mirza left them he wrote to inform the Shah that the Kadhi of the Khawdrij had promised to visit him next day, adding that the said schismatic was a great hater of his Majesty's people, and asking for instructions how he was to deal with him. The Shah sent a message to the following effect:—' When he comes to you, propound some questions to him which will give you an opportunity of controverting the dogmas of 1 Rather, that was the Kadhi's title. Sir John Malcolm says that ' the ministers of state in Persia, and the secretaries of the various de partments of the Government generally, bear the name of Mirza. The term is a contraction of two words, signifying the son of an Amir or lord ; but at present it does not, when prefixed to a name, denote high birth. It may be translated civilian, as it implies complete civil habits : all who assume it are understood to have been well brought up, and to devote themselves to those duties that require education.' History of Persia, vol. ii. p. 571.308 the imams of 'oman. his creed. If you succeed, we may then infer that the people are Khawdrij, as you say they are; but if he over comes you in argument, the inference will be that yours are lying words, that these people do not entertain those senti ments towards us which you charge them with, and that, consequently, it will be our duty to aid them against their adversaries in ^Oman.' The Seyyid Salim had also a Persian with him named Musa, who had been domiciled at Maskat. Though a Mu- sawy 1 in creed, he was an upright and honourable man, who opposed the Shiaah on those points wherein they err from the truth. His advice to Nasir was : 'Have no confidence in the Mirza, for he has the greatest hatred of you. If you visit him, and he questions you about your creed, answer him according to what is written in your books and con tained in your doctrines, and do not falter in your replies.' The Seyyid Salinas advice to him was: ' If you question him about his creed use the utmost caution, and do not say anything respecting it but what will be agreeable to him; for if with all their courtesy towards us they are not acting in good faith, it behoves us to be on our guard against their deceit.' Nasir said; ' Be under no apprehension about me.' When Nasir set out the following morning on his visit to the Mirza he found the Shah's fort surrounded by a dense crowd of Persians, numbering thousands, some seated and others standing, with downcast eyes, not daring to look up 1 That is, a follower of Musa. The Musa referred to was probably the son of Ja'afar-es-Sadik, reckoned the sixth, and his son Musa the seventh, of the legitimate Imams, in succession to Muhammad and his son-in-law 'Aly, by a sect of the Shia'ahs called el-Ethna-'asheri/, be cause they believed that there were twelve such Imams. Musa was born a . h . 128 = a.d . 745, and is supposed to have been poisoned at Baghdad by order of the Khalifah Ilarun-er-Rashid. He was buried at the village of el-Kazhemain, on the right bank of the Tigris, a little above Bagh dad. The Persians have built a handsome mosque over his remains, the cupolas of which are covered with beaten gold.sa'id-bin-sultan. 309 to the fort, out of respect for the Shah. Nilsir passed through all these, and saw those who were pulling out their eyes and arms by the roots, and other madmen sitting on hot copper dishes, 1 when to the Mirza's astonishment he perceived him at his side, and wondered at his courage and hardihood. Placing him on his right hand, the Mirza pro ceeded to try the cases which were brought before him. The first was that of a Persian who complained that the defendant, also a Persian, had killed his brother. The Kadhi having asked the latter whether the charge was true, and being answered in the affirmative, forthwith ordered the executioner, who was at hand, to decapitate him, which he did at one blow. As all the parties in the case had spoken in Persian, which Nasir did not understand, he said to the Kddhi in Arabic : ' Why did you condemn the man to be executed The other replied : ' On account of the charge of the complainant that he had killed his brother. 1 asked the culprit: ' Did you kill his brother V he said ' Yes;' whereupon 1 adjudged him to death, in accordance with the Book and the holy Sunnah.' Nasir then re marked : ' If the matter is as you state it, you have pro nounced a just sentence ; but had you sentenced the man to death, without his own confession of the crime, and without two trustworthy witnesses, you would have acted contrary to the Book and the holy Smmah,' ' I call God to wit ness,' rejoined the Kadhi, ' that the sentence is just, for the case is as I have stated it to you.' (Now the Shah had a large mirror in the fort, so placed that it reflected what passed among the crowd; he also had an interpreter by his side who translated to him what was said in Arabic; and, surrounding him, were his principal Wazirs.) Then the Mirza remarked to Nasir : ' You are a respect able, conscientious, and upright people; why, therefore, are 1 Sir John Malcolm describes the feats of jugglers, wrestlers, and buf foons among the public amusements of the Persians of all classes.310 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. you called Khawarij, and why do you not abjure the tenets of that sect, knowing that a curse rests upon them on ac count of their wicked ways.' (The interpreter translated these words to the Shah.) Nasir replied: 'We are not Khawarij ; the Khawarij were a set of fanatics who existed amongst us in olden time; but since then we have been separated from them, as we are now, on account of their deviation from the truth and their excesses, wherein they followed what w T as vain. Our fanatics are the Khawarij, yours are the Bawajidh, and the curse of God rests alike on both.' 1 (The interpreter translated this reply also to the Shah.) The Mirza remaining silent for some time, Nasir said to him : ' O Mirza, I want to ask you a question, but I fear to do so, seeing that I am in a situation of danger, whereas you are quite safe.' The Mirza replied : ' Say what you please; I guarantee your immunity.' ' I will not speak,' rejoined Nasir, ' until I have the same assur ance from the Shah.' The interpreter having repeated this to the Shah, the latter sent one of his Wazirs, who spoke Arabic, to Nasir with this message : ' The Shah salutes you, and bids me to tell you that he has overheard and under stood what you have said, and gives you full liberty to say what you please, under his guarantee that none of his sub jects shall harm you.' Thereupon Nasir asked the Mirza: 1 Rnwdfidh, (sing. Rd/idhy,) literally, Gainsayers, a term generally used by Sunnis to denote their opponents, the Shia'ahs, who profess an exclusive attachment for 'Aly and his descendants, maintaining their right to the Imamate in succession to Muhammad, and regarding Abu- Bokr, 'Omar, 'Othman, and Mo'iLwiyah as usurpers. It would appear, however, from the text, that the designation is applied in Persia to the numerous sects of dissidents from the orthodox (?) Shia'ahs, with whom they are at variance, both as regards the nature of 'Aly's claims to the Imamate, and also as to the number of his legitimate Successors. For an account of the origin of the name, see el-Makrizy, quoted with comments in the Introduction to De Sacy's Exposk, de la Religion des Druzes, vol. i. p. Ixviii.sa id-bin-sultan. 31] ' Why do you convey your dead bodies from a great dis tance to Kerbela, 1 and expend large sums of money in the transport ? Is not the mercy of God vouchsafed everywhere to those who deserve it; or, is it vouchsafed especially to those not only who live and die at Kerbela, but to those also who have not lived there but who are carried thither to be buried after death?' The Mirza replied: 'We are assured that those who are buried in the land where Husein (upon whom be peace !) was buried will go to heaven, not withstanding all the crimes they may have committed. Why, then, should we not carry our dead thither, and why should we not expend money in doing so ? Every one who is buried there was a Shiay in creed, whose portion is hea ven.' Nasir rejoined : ' What say you, then, about those who are not buried there ?' The other answered : ' Every Shiay who is not buried there is afterwards carried by angels and buried there.' 'Who amongst you,' asked Nasir, ' has seen the angels carrying them ? Then, again, if it is as you say, what need is there of your carrying your dead to Kerbela, and spending so much money on the task, if, according to your belief, the angels who have no need of silver and gold carry them thither gratis ?' The Mirza was silent and did not venture to reply. Then Nasir said to him: ' Which of the two is the more esteemed with you, Husein or his grandfather, the Apostle of God ?' He answered : ' His grandfather, for he is the 1 Kerbela, where Husein the son of 'Aly was slain in battle, on the 10th of Muh4rrani, a.h . 61 = 10th of October, 680, was the name of a district in Babylonian 'Irak, not far from the city of el-Kufah. The Persians regard Ilusein as a martyr, and the first of the el-Buiyah sul tans raised a sumptuous monument over his sepulchre, generally known as Milsh-had-Husein. Crowds of Shia'ah pilgrims continue to pay their annual devotions to the shrine, and the privilege of being interred near the remains of the saint is bought by the rich at an extravagant price. Strings of animals, carrying two or more corpses enclosed in coftins, are constantly arriving at Kerbela from different parts of Persia.312 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. most excellent of God's creatures.' a What say you, then/' rejoined the other, ' of those who are buried near the tomb of the Apostle of God, and whose graves are nigh to his ; are such in heaven or in fire?' 'They are in heaven,' replied the Mirza, who, seeing that Nasir had the best of the argument, added, ' with the exception of these two, to wit, Abu-Bekr and ^Omar.' ' Have you any proof for that statement either from the Book or the holy SunnaliV asked Nasir. As the Mirza did not attempt to reply, Nasir took leave of him, feeling that he had vanquished him, and re turned forthwith to the Seyyid Salim. When the interpreter had translated the colloquy to the Shah, the latter sent one of his Wazirs to the Mirza with this message : ' The Kadhi of 'Oman has overcome you: you have disgraced us by your answers, and brought con tempt on the Shiay creed. You deserve to be beaten with sticks rather than to dispense law and justice. Therefore, quit your office and become the companion of clowns or sweepers.' The Mirza, on his part, poured forth a volley of abuse upon the Wazir. When Nasir reached the Seyyid and reported all that had occurred, the Seyyid said : ' Nasir, you have imperilled us by your tongue; you have disobeyed my injunctions and your companionship will do us no good/' But Mftsa re marked : ' Know, O Seyyid, that the sheikh Nasir has done well and not ill, and I augur from it a favourable settlement of your affairs by the Shah.' Nevertheless, the Seyyid retired that night very much disquieted, owing to Nasir^s discussion with the Mirza; and he was the more apprehen sive because the Shah himself had heard the colloquy, and he was under the impression that the Shah had entrusted his (Salim's) mission to the Mirza's decision. The next morning, however, the Shah dispatched his principal Wazir, who was accompanied by a great concourse of people, to Salim, and who, after he was seated, said to him : ' Thesa'id-bin-sultan. 313 Shah salutes you, and asks you to visit him to-morrow in his fort, and he has given the warders directions to have the way cleared for you/' As Salim was about to set out with his suite Miisa said to him : ' Go alone, and be not disconcerted at the sight of the soldiers, or of the lions and other wild beasts which are chained at the foot of the fort. On entering, and when you meet the Shah, take an empty chair with your own hands, and seat yourself nearer to him than all his Wazirs, and when you address the Shah speak boldly, without affecting any nicety of language, for the Shah has only sent for you to find out whether you are plain-spoken, of decided views, and of a dignified bearing.' Salim accordingly went unattended, and was not distracted cither at the sight of the soldiers, or of the lions and other wild beasts which were chained below the fort. On ap proaching the gate he bade the warder to open it, saying simply, ' I am Salim-bin-Sultan-bin-el-Imam-Ahmed-bin- Sjlid.' So the gate was opened, and he ascended. On seeing him approach, the Shah rose and seized his hand; whereupon Salim took one of the Shah's chairs, which greatly increased his dignity in the estimation of the Shah and his Wazirs. The Shah treated him with great cour tesy, and apologized for having so long delayed having an interview with him, on the ground of press of business. The Shah then asked what request he had to make, to which Salim replied: ' Some of our subjects in 'Oman have mis behaved themselves towards us; they have rebelled and seized some of our fortresses, and have renounced their allegiance to us and contracted an alliance with the Wah- habis, to whom they have committed their affairs, and to whom they have become subject. Praise be to God! we are not tired of fighting against them and the Wahhabis; but inasmuch as in olden time, whenever the subjects of 'Oman rebelled against their sovereign, he was always supported by you,—for you are a great nation, and the keys of victory 40314 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. and of blessings are in your hands,—therefore I have come to you seeking this blessing—that you will deign to send us some of your cavalry, wo undertaking to supply them with money, provisions, and arms at our own cost.' How many horsemen do you require?' asked the Shah. Salim said, ' three thousand, with as many attendants as may be necessary.' ' Your request shall be granted to-morrow,' replied the Shah; who thereupon invested Salim with a splendid robe, and after conversing with him for a long time respecting the expedition, Salim requested leave to return to his companions. On his departure the Shah ordered his principal Wazirs and other officers to escort him, and after they had left him at the house where he sojourned, Salim sent Hajj MCsa to the Shah, to the Wazirs and officers, with rich presents for each. Then turning to his own people ho bade them to transact any business they had on hand, and to be in readiness, as he hoped to start for 'Oman the following day. Next morning thousands of cavalry, with their Khans and attendants, were sent for Salim's inspection; of these he selected three thousand and dismissed the remainder. On reaching Bunder-el-^Abbas he embarked them in a num ber of large and small vessels, and when they arrived at Barkah they pitched their tents on the east and west of the fort. When Muhammad-bin-Nasir heard of the arrival of the Persians at Barkah, he went from Semail to Azka, and from thence to the el-^Obriyyin and the Benu-Shakil, col lecting forces to withstand the new comers. It was agreed between the Seyyids, the sons of Sultan, and the Imam's [Ahmed] daughter,that Nakhl should be attacked before Semail. They accordingly started for that place with their army of Persians and Arabs, and were joined by Himyar-bin-Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, out of hatred to Malik-bin-Seif, who had killed his brother Mu- henna-bin-Muhammad. 1 In order to carry out his views, 1 See p. 270.sa'id-bin-sultan. 315 Himyar wrote privately to the people of Naklil, telling them that the Seyyid Said had called in the aid of the Persians chiefly on his behalf, and that his object was to expel Malik, in order to make over Nakhl to him. The Nakhl people believing this, were disinclined to take up arms, and quietly looked on while the Seyyid Said's forces surrounded the place. The Seyyid's camp extended from Hadhain to es- fearm, which is below the wall, and that of the Persians from Maslimat to the Musalla-el-'Eid. 1 At this time Malik had none of the tribes with him except some of the people of Semail. A gun having been brought from Barkah for the attack on Nakhl, the Seyyid Said's men opened fire with it upon the fort from the Bab-ezh-Zhufur, and also from an other gun which was posted near the Bab-es-Safiyah. The el-Maawal fought bravely on the defensive, and the Seyyid's Arab and Persian forces under the Seyyid Salim, who acted as commander-in-chief, were equally determined in their attack. In the mean time, Himyar wrote repeatedly to the people of Nakhl, most of whom were attached to him and only a few to Malik, advising them to take no part in the contest, reiterating the statement which he had made to them at the outset. By this time the Seyyid Said's army had cut down nearly all the date-trees, and at length Malik, despairing of succour, perceiving also that the majority of the inhabitants were disloyal to him, and further that the shot and shell of the assailants had battered the fort, sued for peace, and after removing all the stores that he could surrendered it to Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-'Adiwy, whom the Seyyid Said, who was then at Barkah, directed to take charge of it. Malik had an interview with the Seyyid at Barkah and received his pardon. 'Azzan-bin-Kais now joined the Seyyid Said with a large contingent, and was followed by Salim from Nakhl, with all his Arabs and Persians. Said remained at Barkah while 1 See.note, p. 276.316 the imams of 'oman. those marched to Semail, and were reinforced by the Seyyid Talib-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed]. On reaching Semail the fort was surrendered to them unconditionally: the garrison at the time consisted of the heads of the el-Jibur, Muhammad-bin-Nasir having gone with a party of the el-'Obriyyin and the Benu- Shakil to muster the Benu-Riyam to oppose the Persians. When Muhammad heard of the surrender of the forts of Nakhl and Semail to the Seyyid Said he started in quest of Miltlak-el-Mutairy, and learning at el-Bereimy that he had left three days before for Nejd, he went forward, and on overtaking him at ezh-Zhafrah-el-Yasiyyah remonstrated with him in these terms: ' How is it that you have aban doned us, after having received the Amir Suud's orders to support us ? By Allah ! if you return to Nejd, I will follow you and complain to the Amir that you fled from the Per sians without striking a blow, and left the Muslims to their fate.' Muhammad, moreover, gave large sums of money to Mutlak's Kadhis, in order to secure their interest, and they accordingly said to Mutlak, ' unless you return to aid Mu hammad-bin-Nasir we will accuse you to the Amir Suud of cowardice, that you withheld succour from the Muslims and ran away from the Persians without fighting. You have no excuse for not returning with Muhammad-bin-Nasir to con tend against the Mushrikm; 1 for how often, by the will of God, have a few overcome numbers, and ' God is with tho patient.'' These expostulations were not without effect upon Mutlak, who dreaded Suud's reproof. Thereupon Mu hammad, taking two parcels containing one thousand dollars each from his saddle-bags, gave them to Mutlak, saying: ' Here are the means to provide for your wants and tho wants of your followers.' Mutlak took the money and re turned with Muhammad to raise levies from the Benu-Naim and Kutb and the ezh-Zhawahir; he also collected many from Dhank and el-Ghabby, and on reaching Azka they were joined by the ol-Janabah and the ed-Duruwwa. 1 See note 4, p. 245.sa id-bin-sultan. 31 Salim-bin-Sultan now decided to march against Azka, but his uncle Talib-bin-el-Imam suggested that he should first dispatch Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaaruby, to persuade Muham- mad-bin-Nasir to surrender the fort before he marched with the Persians against the place. On Malik's arrival with the letter he found that Muhammad had a large body of Wah- habis and Mutawdlihabis 1 with him, as well as the Arab fol lowers of Seif-bin-Thiibit and the ed-Duruwwa—in all a very considerable army, so he did not return with an answer to Salim. Tired of waiting, Salim moved with his army towards Azka, and on reaching the Wadi of the Benu-Ru- wahah he was joined by 'Isa-bin-Salih, el-Harithy, with a great many of the el-Harth, of the el-Habus, and others. Salim had also written to the principal Nizariyyah of Semiiil, and they sent him a strong reinforcement. Salim then proceeded on the march, his uncle Talib halt ing at the village of Maty, but owing to the overflowing of the Wadi-Halfain, in consequence of heavy rain, they could not go forward to Azka. However, when the rain subsided and the Wadi became dry, Salim advanced upon Azka and encountered Muhammad-bin-Nasir near Saddy, where a battle was fought between the two armies, Muhammad-bin- Nasir gaining the victory. A great many Persians and Arabs fell on that day. When the garrison of the Hujrah of el-Yamn heard of the flight of the Seyyid Salinas Persians and Arabs they abandoned the Hujrah and fled in every direction. Mutlak and Muhammad-bin-Nasir then marched with their forces to Semail. On entering the Wiidi of the 13enu- Ruwahah they razed the towers and plundered all they could find in the Wadi. When Mutlak was about to return to el-Bereimy he gave Muhammad Semed-el-Kindy, of Nezwa, and Muhammed repaired its mosque and built an oil-press there. At this time the remainder of the Per- 1 See note 2, p. 234. ill . % ill318 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. sians were at Barkah, while Muhammad-bin-Nasir and Malik-bin-Seif abode at Azka. Then Turky and Faisal, the sons of Suud-bin-'Abdu-'l- ''Aziz, came to el-Bereimy without their father's permission, bringing with them some men of el-Hasa and el-Kasim, 1 and were joined by Rashid-bin-Hamid, en-Naimy, on their way through 'Ajman. 2 Mutlak having given up the command to them, they were reinforced by the esh-Shawamis and the Benu-Kaab; but of the Benu-Naim only one hundred came with E,ashid-bin-Hamid. They then assaulted the fort and afterwards encamped in the surrounding open country. J )uring the night the el-Khadra surprised them, killing many of the followers of Turky and Faisal, who thereupon took to flight; but none of Rashid-bin-Hamid's men fell, for when the el-Khadra attacked them they lighted fires, the flames of which prevented the assailants from reaching them. Moreover, most of Tiirky and FaisaPs men who lost their lives that night were killed by their own comrades who did not recognize them, owing to the darkness. W lion Mutlak heard of this check he collected a force from the Benu-^Naim and Kutb, and the ezh-Zhawahir, and wrote to Muhammad-bin-Nasir to join him immediately. The latter did so, taking with him the el-Janabah, the ed- Duriiwwa, and the el-Hashm, also Salim-bin-'Aly, et-Te- mamy. On reaching el-Hazm they were joined by Turky and Faisal, with a few followers, and then went to el-Habra, where they halted three days. From thence they descended upon Larkah, and Malik-bin-Seif and el-Marr-bin-Nasir, Muhammad-bin-Nasir's brother, attacked the part conti- 1 El-Kasim, a province of Upper Nejd.

Then Miitlak and Muham- mad-bin-Nasir and Suud's two sons marched towards Mas- kat and entered el-Matrah by the 'Akabat-el-Marakh, where one hundred Belooches were posted, who took to flight at their approachu 'Azzan also and his men abandoned es- Sedd, and Miitlak and his companions encamped at Eiwa, where they were joined by a contingent from the Nizariyyah of Seraiiil, mostly Seyyabiyyin and Nadabiyyin. Miitlak's followers then proceeded to plunder el-Mdtrah and Arbak ; 2 burnt the wall of the Luwatiyah, and killed many of the in habitants. They remained three days at es-Sedd, which they completely plundered, and then went to Hail-el-Ghaf, which they also ravaged. Next they marched to Siya, razed the Hujrah of the el-Jirfidinah, killing nearly all the garri son, and took from the trustee of Seif-bin-Hanzhal, Al-Bi\- Saidy, the sum of forty thousand dollars which Seif had placed in his charge. They also razed the Hujrah of the Jienu-Akhzam, and then took the road to Daghmar, but per ceiving on reaching esh-Shab that the mountains overlook ing it were held by the Benu-Jabir, the people of Taiwa, who were posted there, and had also placed four guns on the hill near esh-Shab, they did not venture to attack them. Then they wrote to the sheikh 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad, es- Salty, who was at that time Amir over all the Taiwa, to allow them to pass through to Sftr, and sent him a present of money. Having got his permission, they proceeded to er- Ramlah, of Taiwa, and ravaged the country to within a short 1 The Prayer-Ground, like Mm&amp;lla-d-Eid; see note, p. 276. 2 A small town, defended by two towers, on the western side of the harbour of el-Mdtrah.

On reach ing Sur, the people there coming to terms with them, they seized what property they could, and then proceeded towards Jaalan and encamped at Falj-el-Meshayikh. (The com manders of their army, subordinate to Miitlak and Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir, were el-Habry-bin-Rashid-bin-IIamid, en-Naimy, and Salim-bin-'Aly, et-Temamy, and Khadim- bin-Muhammad, el-Hashimy, and Muhammad-bin-Majid, er-Rasiby.) Then some of the Benu-Hasan fell upon a party of Miitlak^s soldiers and captured their flag; on the other hand, Muhammad-bin-Nasir directed his men to cut down the date-trees of those who had seized him in the fort of Barkah by the Seyyid Said's order. 1 Eventually, how ever, Miitlak came to terms with the Benu-Hdsan, after mulcting them of a sum of money. Then Salim-bin-^Aly, et-Temamy, requested Miitlak-el-Mutairy to accompany him to el-Hadd. He accordingly went with him, taking all his force, and on their arrival they razed its castle, burnt all the boats of its inhabitants, and set fire to their houses. On payment of a sum of money they were let off without any further outrages. Then Salim-bin-'Aly, and the el- Hashm, and the Benu-Rasib returned to their respective homes, and Mutlak and Muhammad-bin-Nasir marched with their followers to Azka, from whence, after being feasted three days, the former started for el-Bereimy. In consequence of the part which Salim-bin-'Aly, et-Te mamy, had taken against the Benu-Hasan, there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a fight, wherein Salim-bin-'Aly and some of his people were killed ; some of the Benu-Hasan also fell, and as neither side would give in the war between them continued. About this time Sultan-bin-Sdkar, el-Hawaly, wrote to the Seyyid Said proposing a secret alliance with him, to 1 See p. 295.sa'id-bin-sultan. 321 which the Seyyid consented; but when Hdsan-bin-Rahmah, Sultan s uncle, heard thereof, he reported the circumstance to Suud-bin- Abdu-'l-'Aziz; whereupon the latter summoned Sultan-bin-Sdkar to his presence. On starting, he made over Daba and the tower at Fakkan to the Seyyid Said, and on reaching Suiid that chief had him bound for a few days and then released him, on receiving a solemn promise from him that he would cooperate with any force he might send to ravage esh-Sham and el-^Irak. -N ow, the piracies of Hasan-bin-Rahmah had gone on in creasing : he had killed many of the Seyyid Said^s subjects and also of the English, and had seized many vessels be longing to 'Oman and India. These outrages continuing, the English prepared many ships, full of men, stores, and arms, to attack him, and the Seyyid Said joined them with a number of large and small vessels. They proceeded to Julfar, which they invested. Now Hasan-bin-Rahmah had built in its centre a strong stone fort, upon which the English began to fire both from sea and land. One night Hasan-bin-Rahmah's people sallied out and reached the British camp, which was situated near the fort they were besieging, but the besiegers opened fire upon them from their guns and muskets, and obliged the assailants to retire. On the following morning the English opened a fiercer fire upon the castle, and, succeeding in making a breach in it, they rushed in, drove away the garrison, who fled as far as el-Fahlain, and then plundered the houses, burnt the shipping, carried away a large booty from Julfar, took Ibra him-[Hasan ?]bin-Rahmah and his principal men prisoners, and fired the country. Hasan-bin-Rahmah died in the prison of the English. 1 1 I rged on by the Wahhiibis, the Kawasim (Joasmees) under llasan- bin-Rdhmah had extended their piracies to the coast of Western India. i determined to suppress these outrages, and also to relieve the Seyyid Sa id from the power of the AVahhabis, the British Government ordered •in expedition to proceed to the Persian Gulf. 41 Their first operations 41322 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. Meanwhile, Mutlak's inroads upon Sohar increased, as did also the outrages of Muharnmad-bin-Ahmed, et-Tinjy, at Shinas, the fort of which had fallen into his hands. He used to put to death from ten to twenty every day, making no distinction between those who obeyed and those who dis obeyed him, slaughtering them like sheep, and seizing their property. The Seyyid Said accordingly requested the aid of the English, who came with a considerable force on board of large ships, and the Seyyid joining them the combined forces surrounded the castle of Shinas. (His brother fealim and ^Azzan-bin-Kais were with the Seyyid on the occasion.) When the English opened fire upon the fort, Muhammad- bin-Ahmed started for el-Bereimy to ask Mutlak-el-Mutairy to come to his assistance against the English and the Seyyid Said. Mutlak's reply was : You return at once and I will follow hard upon your footsteps.' So Muhammad-bin- Ahmed returned towards Shinas with a large body of Wah- habis. When he was two furlongs from Shinas night came on, and he could not approach his fort, owing to the large num ber of soldiers that surrounded it. That same night he died suddenly, whereupon his followers returned to el-Bereimy. were directed against Ras-ool-Khyma. The attack commenced by a bombardment during the 12th of November, 1809. On the following day, the Joasmees were vigorously attacked by sea and land: after a bloody but ineffectual resistance they were driven into the interior of the country. The town, with the vessels in port, amounting to up wards of fifty, with the English prize, the Minerva, were burnt.' Bom- hay Government Selections, No. xxiv. p. 305-6. Ihe only discrepancy between the English and native account of this expedition is in the name of the place attacked, the former calling it Ras-el-Khaimah, and the latter Julfar. The name of Julfar has disappeared from all our maps and charts. Relying on a passage from the late Colonel Taylor's u Brief Notes' {Bombay Government Selections, No, xxiv. p. 1-1), I have in a note to page 4 located it a little below Khasab, not far from Cape Musfoidim, on the western side of the promontory of Riius-el-Jebel; but from the above account I am inclined to believe that it is repre sented by the modern Ras-el-Khaimah.S A'ID-BIN-SULTAN. 323 The English having battered down one side of the fort, the Seyyid's men stormed it, and there was a great fight be tween them and the garrison ; but the Seyyid was victorious, and all the garrison were put to the sword. 1 When the English had re-embarked their guns and war- implements they said to the Seyyid: ' Betake yourself to your ship, and send and tell Salim your brother, and 'Azzan, to leave the shore.' (The English stated that from their ships they had seen dust in the air in small clouds.) The Seyyid accordingly ordered his brother Salim and also 'Azzan to return. The English had made the above remark in the afternoon, and towards evening Mutlak came to Shinas with a lai'ge force, and there was a great battle between the two parties, Mutlak gaining the victory, and the Seyyid Salim and ^Azzan losing many men. Owing to the darkness and an accompanying dust-storm, Miitlak's soldiers could not distinguish the Seyyids, who pi'ovidentially escaped and reached Sohar the same night, mounted on strong and fleet horses. The Seyyid Salim remained there three days with ^Azzan and then went to el-Masnaah ; but none of the Wah- habis approached Sohar, for they had all left with Mutlak for el-Bereimy, after the engagement. As to Sultan-bin-Sakar, after serving Suud-bin- , Abdu- , l- 'Aziz for some time, he left him, and then went about from one place to another until he reached 'Abdu-'l-Habib, at esh- 1 The official account of this affair is as follows:— u The joint forces arrived at Shinas on the 31st of December, 1810, which was summoned the day after.

Shinas was defended hy the most determined and heroic bravery. After an obstinate and sanguinary resistance, the fort was surrendered and made over to the 'Oman troops, but was so much demolished that the Imam [the Seyyid Sa'id] did not think it prudent to keep possession of it.' Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. p. 306 It is noteworthy that the official record is silent respecting the disaster which befell the Seyyid's army on land immediately after. Possibly the English ships had sailed before the arrival of the ahhabis.THE J MAMS OF 'OMAN. Sliehr, 1 who gladly received him. After remaining with him a few days he expressed a wish to return to his country ; 'Abdu-'l-Habib accordingly provided him with a boat and sent one hundred armed Nubians to escort him. When he arrived at M.iskat the Seyyid Said treated him with great consideration, and from Maskat he started for Julfar. The Seyyid, moreover, wrote to inform the English of his visit: that he had now become his and their friend, and had pro mised to refrain in future from all depredations by sea and land. Thereupon the English sent Sultan-bin-Sakar much money, directed him to rebuild Julfar, and enjoined him to adhere to his resolve of abandoning his malpractices. So he restored Julfar to its former state. When Mutlak-el-Mutairy heard of the alliance which had been contracted between the Seyyid Said and Sultan-bin- Sakar, of the money which the English had sent to the latter, and that he had withdrawn from the Wahhaby con federacy, he collected a large force of the Benu-Yas, the Benu-Naim, the ezh-Zhawahir, the Benu-Kutb, the Benu-Kaab and Kulaib, and the esh-Shawamis and their allies. He also wrote to Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, to join him with their fol lowers, as soon as they should hear that he had encamped near Sohar. He accordingly set out and encamped at Sillan and at' Auhy, where Hamid and Muhammad met him with a large force. The combined army is said to have numbered forty thousand men. 'Azzan persuaded of his inability to cope with Miitlak under these circumstances, and perceiving, moreover, that his own people leaned in that direction, was obliged to come to terms with Mutlak, as was also his uncle Muhammad-bin- 1 Probably the esh-Shelir on the south-east coast of Arabia, in lat. 14° 36' 30' N., long. 49° 27' 35' E.

Mutlak then marched to el-Masnaah and en camped there, and was visited by Ahmed, the son of the Imam Said-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed], whom his father had sent as his deputy to Mutlak. 1 The sheikh Nasir-bin-Ja'id also felt himself compelled to have an interview with him. The Seyyid Said hearing of all these occurrences embarked for el-Masnaah, without previously consulting Mutlak or asking him for a safe-conduct, and suddenly appeared in his tent, his officers apprising him that it was the Seyyid Said who stood before him. Thereupon Mutlak dismissed his attendants, and taking the Seyyid by the hand drew him towards him, saying : ' You ai^e safe, as regards me and my people, and whatever request you have to prefer shall be granted ; for, by Allah ! you are a munificent, brave, and chivalrous prince,' The two conversed together for a long time, and when the Seyyid Said was about to leave he said to Mutlak, ' if a present should reach you from me, pray accept it, and cease from injuring my people, or the people of my uncle Muhammad-bin-el-Imam, or of my cousin 'Az- zan-bin-Kais, or of my uncle Said-bin-el-Imam.' ^ All that I grant you,' was Miitlak's reply. On embarking on board his ship, the Seyyid Said sent him forty thousand dollars, on the receipt of which Miitlak returned to el-Bereimy and dismissed his levies. 2 After remaining there a few days he started for Riyadh, in Nejd, and Silud sent Ibn-'Azdakah to replace him in 'Oman. When the latter reached ezh-Zhaf- rat-el-Yasiyyah with his followers, they were attacked by the Benu-Yas, who killed him and most of his escort. 1 It is clear from this remark that the Imam Sa'id-bin-Ahmed was still alive at er-Ilastak. 2 The Seyyid Sa'id did not make this submission to Mutlak-el-Mu- tairy until after he had appealed in vain to the British authorities in India for assistance, urging that his cooperation with them in the late expedition against Ras-el-Khaimah and Shinaa had greatly embittered the animosity of the Wahhabis towards him, and threatened to involve him in perpetual warfare with their Amir.326 the imams of 'oman. On hearing what had befallen Ibn-'Azdakah and his party, Suiid said to Mutlak: ^You are the only fit man for 'Oman; therefore proceed thither and punish all who shall dare to oppose me.' When Mutlak reached el-Bereimy he found that most of the Arabs and Hadhr were opposed to him, chiefly owing to the large demands which had already been made upon them for wars and invasions ; hence the wealthy among them pleaded poverty, and the brave feigned cow ardice. However, he persevered in coaxing and plying them on their weak side until they yielded ; none of the tribes of ezh-Zhahirah kept aloof, except the Benu-Kelban. There upon he began to raise levies from the others to act against the Benu-Kelban, who on learning that he was collecting the Arabs of esh-Shamal with that object forthwith aban doned their villages and fortified themselves in the tower of Makniyat, and on his attempting to coerce them they re sisted, and would neither surrender nor join him. Thwarted by their obstinacy he went back to el-Bereimy for a few days, and having levied the Benu-Kaab he marched with them to Dhank, where he mustered the Al-'Aziz, whose Amir at that time was Rashid-el-'Azizy. He also levied the people of 'Obry, but he forbore telling any one what his intentions were. Owing to some disputes betwixt him and the Arabs of esh-Shamal he did not muster them, but pro ceeded with the other levies as far as Manh, where he only remained two hours to bait his horses. From thence he marched to the territory of the el-Hajariyyin, arriving there about dawn. He halted on the outskirts and dispersed his forces to ravage the district, only retaining with him at the halting-place Battal-el-Mutairy, and Rashid-el-'Aztzy, and twelve horsemen. A tent was pitched for him and another for Battal, the latter nearer to the territory of the el- Hajariyyin than his. Mdtlak had with him in his tent 'Abdallah-bin-Rashid, el-'Azizy, and seventy of his officers, of whom a dozen were horsemen. Battal had eighty mensa'id-bin-sultan. 327 mounted on camels^ and was subsequently joined by ten of the cavalry who had been ravaging the country, on which duty all the remainder were still employed. The el-Haja- riyyin nearest the outskirts perceiving what a small force Mutlak had with him, and knowing how the rest were en gaged, solemnly vowed that they would attack him, even if they fell in the attempt. They accordingly rushed on the tent of Battal, who immediately rose up with his men; the contest lasted for an hour, the assailants being obliged to give way. They made a second attempt and were again driven back ; but BattaPs arm having been broken by a musket-ball which was levelled at him, they succeeded on their third effort in capturing the tent, Battal himself effect ing his escape and joining Mutlak, to whom he showed his broken limb, as an apology for having retreated. Then the el-Hajariyyin made two attacks upon Mutlak, but failing of success they began to muster reinforcements from the scat tered villages, and again vowed solemnly that they would either prevail against him or die in the attempt. I received the following account of the above transaction from 'Aly-bin-Rashid, el-'Azizy, himself: ' After Battal had been wounded and had retreated with his party and joined Mutlak, the el-Hajariyyin assaulted us twice, and were re pulsed with the loss of twelve men on their side and none on ours. At their third onset they advanced jostling one another and reeling like drunken men. Mutlak had taken off his armour and we advised him to put it on again, as the assailants were approaching. He waited till they were close to the tent, then put on his armour and mounted his horse; his cavalry did the same and stood awaiting his orders. All he said was, ' Don't be in a hurry; let them come still nearer. , He had hardly uttered the words when one of the assailing musketeers from a distance shot him in the breast, and he fell from his horse to the ground. Thereupon we took to flight, leaving the el-Hajariyyin plundering the328 the imams of 'oman. money and other property in the tent.' Such is 'Aly-bin- Ilashid's narrative of the occurrence. The retreating party were then joined by their comrades who were plundering the villages of the el-Hajariyyin. Twelve Wahhabis besides Miltlak were slain in this encounter; the el-Hajari yyin lost eighteen men killed. The Wahhfibis fled during the early morning, and at dawn the following day they reached el- Ghabby. On their arrival they found that Muhammad-bin- Khasif, el-Kutby, had assaulted the place, but had been killed, with three of his men. After remaining a few days at el-Bereimy, Battal went to 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, whom he found at Riyadh, and who on learning what had befallen Mutlak sent Ibn-Mazrua to supply his place. Now, ^Azzan-bin-Kais had started on the Hijj, and on his way back fell ill at Mokha with orchitis. A doctor who was called in to prescribe for him declared that no treatment would be effectual unless he first underwent an operation to allow the collected matter to escape. He submitted to that, but died two days after the incision was made, and was buried at Mokha. Before his departure on the Hijj he had placed Salim-bin-Said, Al-Bu-Saidy, over Sohar, directing him to obey the Seyyid Said-bin-Sultan, and in the event of his death during the journey to make over the fort to him. When Ibn-Mazrua reached el-Bereimy he collected a large number of the Arabs of that place with the intention of marching against el-Bediyyah. 1 On hearing of this the Seyyid Said went to the esh-Sharkiyyah and raised levies from the Al-Wahibah, the el-Hajariyyin, the pe'ople of el-Habus, and 1 Wellsted's ' Bedi'ah,' in the district of Ja'aUn, which he describes as ' a collection of seven hamlets, situated in as many oases, each con taining from two to three hundred houses...One striking feature in the appearance of these towns is their low situation. They are erected in artificial hollows, which have been excavated to the depth of six or eight feet, and the soil thus removed is left in hillocks around their margins.' Travels in Arabia, vol. i. p. 91.SA'l D-BIN-SU LTAN. from all the tribes of the el-Yemeniyyah, and after collecting a large force marched to Xezwa. Finding on his arrival there that Ibn-Mazrua was at Behla,—the governor of which at that time was Muhammad-bin-Suleimfin, el-Yaaruby,—he started thither. Jbn Mazrua's force at Behla consisted of the el-'Obriyytn and the Benu-Shakil, who had been mus tered by Muhammad-bin-Suleinmn when he heard that the Seyyid Said was in esh-Sharkiyyah collecting an army, and when Ibn-Mazrua came to him he advised him not to go to el-Bediyyah, nor yet to any part of esh-Sharkiyyah, on that account. While they were conversing on this topic, a mes senger, one of the ed-Duruwwa, came to apprise them that the Seyyid Said was encamped with a large force, not a horse's run from them. At this juncture a messenger ar rived from Majid-bin-Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, the Wakil, informing the Seyyid Said of the death of'Azzan-bin-Kais ; whereupon he abandoned the war against Ibn-Mazrua and started for Sohar, taking only the Al-Wahibah and some of the el-Hajariyyin Arabs with him, dismissing the remainder. Now, the daughter of the Imam Said was in the house at Sih-el-Harmel, which had been built and fortified by Mu- hammad-bin-Khalfan, and she wrote to the wife of Ahmed- bin-Said-bin-el-Imam—who was then at er-Rastak—ap prising her of the death of 'Azzan. The messenger left on a swift camel at sunrise and reached er-Rastak towards sun set. When Kais's daughter read the letter she communi cated its contents to her husband Ahmed, and they both started for Sohar after sunset, Suleiman-el-'Adiwy and some intimate friends accompanying them. The Seyyid Said reached Sohar towards evening, whereas they did not arrive till towards dawn the following day, utterly ignorant then that he had anticipated them. On learning that he was there and that he had taken possession of the fort, they returned at once to er-Rastak. 1 Salim-bin-Said, imme- 1 According to the foregoing narrative, the daughter of the reigning330 the imams of 'oman. diately on the Soyyid Said's arrival, had made over the fort to him, whereupon the Seyyid placed Sohar in charge of Said-bin-Suleiman-bin-Said, Al-Bu-Saidy, and after staying- there a few days left for Maskat. When the fort of Nakhl was given up to the Seyyid Said he had permitted Himyar-bin-Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el- Yaaruby, to reside at that place, over which he then ap pointed Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-'Adiwy, Wali, as we have already narrated. 1 Subsequently he had removed the latter and made his uncle, Talib-bin-el-Imam, Wali in his stead. Talib then ordered Himyar-bin-Muhammad to quit Nakhl, which he did, leaving it by night and going to et- Tau with some of his followers. Afterwards, Talib resigned the governorship and the Seyyid Said appointed Khalfan- bin-Seif-bin-Said, el-Mauly, to succeed him. This man treated the people most unjustly, ordering many of their houses to be razed, which induced them to unite and invite llimyar-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, to join them against him. As he delayed, they wrote to him a second time, stating that unless he agreed to their request they would leave the country. He accordingly took the matter up in earnest and proceeded to Nakhl with two hundred of the people of et- Tau, and there was a fierce struggle between them and the el-Maawal. Whereupon Khalfan-bin-Seif, who was at that time at Maslimat, collected the el-Maawal of the plain and the el-Hajar, and went with them to Nakhl, but having been wounded in the leg by a musket-ball he retired into the fort and encamped his men at el-Kharijiyyah. Now, Ilimyar had concealed some of his followers in a stockade near the Hujrat-el-Kurain, which was then held by the es- Imam Sa'id, the Seyyid Sa'id's cousin, wished to secure Sohar for her brother Ahmed, who, it appears, was married to his second cousin, the daughter of Kais, 'Azzan's father; but the Seyyid Sa'id was too sharp for them, and from that time forward claimed Sohar as an integral part of his territories. • See p. 315.SA^ID-BIN-SULTAN. 331 Siririyyin, on behalf of Khalfan, and one of them having come to inform the latter that they were out of provisions and ammunition, he sent Khalfan-bin-Muhammad, el-Mauly, with a party of men to the Hnjrah with the required sup plies. They succeeded in the task, after dislodging Him- yar's followers from the stockade, but as Khalfan-bin-Mu- hammad and his party were returning to the fort, the slaves of Himyar fell upon them, killing Khalfan and two of his men. Subsequently, Muhamraad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, came to the support of Himyar and the people of Nakhl, with one thousand men of 'Oman. He was also joined by the el- Hazm and many of the el-Yaarubah, and others. When the Seyyid Said saw Himyar's determination, and that the el-Maawal were unable to expel him and his col league Muhammad-bin-Nasir from Nakhl, he sent Said-bin- Hamed-bin-Khalfan to advise the latter not to persist in his present course, and to break off all connection with Himyar and the people of Nakhl, promising that if he obeyed he would give him as much money as he desired and any forti fied post he chose. Muhammad accepted the proposal and returned to 'Oman with his followers, leaving Himyar with a small force; nevertheless, the latter was bent on prose cuting the war. Thereupon the Seyyid Said summoned Najim-bin-'Abdallah, es-Seyyaby, from Nakhl, and on his arrival the Seyyid began raising levies from the el-Harth, the el-Hajariyyin, the Benu-Hasan, the coast Arabs, the Uenu-Kharus, and from some of the Nizariyyah of Senuiil, and then marched with them, ordering a party of the Benu- Hinah to go in advance and to seize the Masjid near the market before his arrival. After seizing the Masjid, some of the Benu-Hinah attacked the House of Refuge, but losing their commander, who was shot by a musket-ball, they joined their comrades who were in the Masjid. On the Seyyid^s arrival a part of his force attacked the tower 'Akum and took it, Himyar retiring to el-Hamam.m I fei?.' THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Thereupon the Seyyid, having come to terms with the people of el-Jamimy, went with his brother Salim and en camped at Sabarat-Habashy, the remainder of his army, which numbered seven thousand men, encamping from the Masjid of Bayak [?] to el-Kharijiyyah. Then the Seyyid ordered the force to move against Himyar, and when they got near er-Rdha-el-'Aliyah they were met by Himyar's fol lowers, who gave them battle and put them to flight, killing Asad, the Nubian, one of the Seyyid's servants, the com mander of the el-Hadharim, 1 and several others. Thereupon the Seyyid Said sent some of the chiefs of the Benu-Hasan with Najim-es-Seyyaby to invite Ilimyar to a conference, promising him immunity, and also permission to reside in the town. On his arrival the Seyyid ordered him to be confined in the fort, much to the disgust of the Benu-Hasan chiefs, who on seeing how exasperated the Seyyid was against him joined him in the prison and remained with him. Eventually, the Seyyid released him and took him to Barkah, and from thence to Maskat, and after detaining him there for a few days gave him permission to reside at et- Tau, but not at Nakhl. Nevertheless, six months after he went thither, and posted himself in el-Hamam ; whereupon the Seyyid again levied the el-Harth, the el-Hajariyyin, the Arabs of esh-Sharkiyyah, of el-Yemeniyyah, as well as those of the coast, also the Benu-Kharus and some of the Nizar- iyyah of Semail, the el-Hawasanah, and the el-Hadd^n, and marched with them to Nakhl, where he was joined by some of the el-Maawal, the people of el-Hajar, and of the coast. He then ordered the el-Maawal to climb the mountain of esh- Shaibah, and to walk along its ridge by night until they reached a spot overlooking el-Hamam, when they were to attack Himyar's followers, who occupied the Wadi below, with musketry. The el-Hawasanah he directed in like man ner to ascend the mountain overlooking the spring of el- 1 El-ffadhdrim, plural of Ilddhramy, a native of lladhramaut.SA'ID-BIN-SULTAN. 333 Hamam, to conceal themselves ou its summit till sunrise, and on hearing the report of the musketry of the el-Maawal to join them in the attack upon Himyar's position. The el- Maawal numbered seven hundred and the el-Hawasanah three hundred men. At sunrise the Seyyid Said marched with his men towards el-Hamam, and encamped near the garden of Shamis, while Suwailim and his party went forward, and on reaching el- Janat his standard-bearer was shot by one of the musketeers posted on the surrounding heights and expired. Thereupon Suwailim returned to the Seyyid Said; but in the mean time the musketry-fire was kept up between the parties on the opposite mountains, until at length the el-Maawal and the el-Hawasanah were put to flight, the former with the loss of two chiefs, namely, Hamed-bin-Said, ez-Zamily, and Nasir-bin-Khalf, esh-Sharyaby, the proprietor of the Hujrah of el-Wurud, and twelve men; and the latter, together with the el-Haddan, with the loss of thirty men. This repulse led the Seyyid and his followers to return to el-Jamimy, where he put up in the mosque and then dispatched the Benu-Kelban to invite Hiinyar to an interview, they under taking to escort and protect him. Himyar came attended only by his slave Suayyid, nicknamed es-Safan ; whereupon the Seyyid dismissed all the tribes and then started for Barkah with his suite, taking Himyar and his slave and the men of the Benu-Kelban with him, leaving Suleiman-bin- Himyar at el-Hamam, and Suwailim-bin-Salitnin A\ ali over Nakhl. The Seyyid and his party had only been two days at Barkah when Himyar escaped to et-Tau. The manner in which he effected his escape was as fol lows 'Aly-bin-Talib-bin-Muhenna, the Wali of Nezwa, came by night to the house where he was lodged, woke him from sleep, and said to him, ' Himyar, T owe you a debt on account of your brother Muhenna-bin-Muhammad, and I am come to discharge it.' Hiinyar asking him what ho retorrcd' 1 AV .Mi. 1|' rki . I ^4 M i ■ '-i 334 the imams of oman. to, he proceeded to say, ' When I repaired to the Seyyid, on the death of his father, I found him fortified in the East ern fort—for the war between him and his uncle Kais-bin- el-Imam was raging fiercely at that time—and your brother was stationed upon the Island, at Maskat, engaged on the ISeyyid's side against his uncle. Nasir-bin-Muhammad, er- liiyamy, with seven hundred of his men, was with Muhenna at the time. 1 Now there was a blood-feud between me and Nasir, for I had killed his two brothers, Himj-ar and Hud- hud. When Muhenna therefore heard of my having come to the Seyyid, he enjoined me to seek safety in flight, as a party was on the look-out, seeking to kill me. Being utterly at a loss how I could evade the Benu-Riyam who held all the outlets, your brother prepared a boat for me belonging to the Benu-Jabir, the people of Taiwa, in which I embarked for Sur, and from thence I proceeded to Nezwa. Therefore I owe my escape from the hands of my enemies to your brother Muhenna, and that is the debt which I am come to pay ; for [ know that the Seyyid Said has determined to put you to death.' On hearing this, Himyar started the same night for et-Tau. The following morning the Seyyid having sent a messenger to summon him to the fort, the inmates of the house informed him that Himyar and his slave had set out during the night, and that they did not know whither he had gone. Thereupon the Seyyid re marked to the Benu-Kelban : ' I fancy he has gone to et- Tau, suspecting some evil at my hands ; but go and fetch him back and assure him of his safety with me.' They did so, and on his arrival the Seyyid asked him who had ex cited his apprehensions, so as to induce him to run away. In reply, he repeated all that ^Aly-bin-Talib had told him. Then the Seyyid ordered 'Aly-bin-Talib to be imprisoned in the fort at Barkah, but released him three days after. (The author begs to state that the foregoing narrative was 1 See pp. 265-6.SA'lD-BIN-SULTAN. 335 communicated to him personally by 'Aly-bin-Talib, after Himyar's overthrow.) The Seyyid Said then went to Mas- kat, taking the JJenu-Kelban with him. He detained Himyar there a few days, and then permitted him to go to et-Tau. I have been told that the heads of the el-Maawal were much vexed with the Seyyid Said for having allowed Himyar to go to et-Tau, complaining that he had killed some of their people in the recent affair of the mountain, and been guilty of similar outrages prior to that occasion; they urged, moreover, that there would be no end to his malpractices, until he was dead. Having succeeded by these representations in ex citing the Seyyid Said's suspicions, the latter informed them that he would send for Nebhan-bin-Seif and be guided by his counsels. (Nebhan at the time was the Seyyid's Wali over Bunder-el-^Abbas and Minau ; Suwailim-bin-Salimtn was his A\ ali over Nakhl.) When Nebhan reached the Seyyid at Barkah, he confirmed everything which the el- Maawal had stated respecting Himyar, which exasperated the Seyyid still more against that personage, and he accord ingly summoned him from et-Tau. When Himyar was about to start, many of the el-Yaarubah and others dissuaded him from the journey, but he would not listen to them. He asked his son Suleiman to accompany him, but he refused ; so he only took with him his slave Suayyid, known as es- Safan, and Seif-bin-Malik-bin-Seif, el-Yaj'iruby, who was still quite a lad. On reaching the fort they were seized and bound, but the slave es-Safan was put to death at once, while Himyar and Seif were cast into prison. Then the Seyyid wrote to Suwailim to forward to him any of the dis affected among the el-Yaarubah, and he accordingly seized Himyar-bin-Muhammad-bin-Himyar, el-Yaaruby, and Ma- jid-bin-Seif, and sent them to Barkah, from whence the Seyyid sent them to Mdskat, where Himyar and Seif-bin-Malik were confined in the Eastern fort, and Majid-bin-Seif and Himyar-bin-Muhammad-bin-Himyar in the Eastern battery.33G THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. They all died in prison, with the exception of Seif-bin-Ma- lik, who was liberated and allowed to go to et-Tau. About this time the Seyyid Said, at the instigation of Muhammad-bin-Seif, collected a large force of Arabs and Hadhr and proceeded with them against el-Bahrein, but the people of the island repulsed them. Among those who fell in this expedition was Hamed-bin-Sultan, the Seyyid Said's brother ; and of his officers the following : the sheikh Said- bin-Majid, el-Harithy, and Nebhan-bin-Seif-bin-Said, ez- Zamily, and Muhammad-bin-Salim, el-'Abudy, es-Sem:iily, and Suleiman-bin-Ahmed, el-Hanisy, and 'Aly-bin-Habib, es-Salty, el-Ilalmy. 1 On his return to Mdskat, the Seyyid-Said ordered the Benu-Muhallal—whose chief at that time was Muhammad- bin-Seif—to rebuild the castle of el-Janat. When it was completed, Suleiman-bin-Himyar-bin-Muhammad, el-Yaa- ruby, with some of the men of et-Tau, attacked and seized it, on which occasion Hamid-edh-Dhala, and the slave of 'Abir-en-Naimy, and six others were killed on the side of the el-Muhallal. Muhammad-bin-Seif also, havinsr been ^ O burnt by gunpowder during the assault, surrendered to Suleiman, who allowed him to go to Maslimat, where he died. Thereupon the war waxed fiercer between the el-Maawal and Suleiman, the latter receiving aid in men from Muham mad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, the Wali of Behla, and also from the people of el-Hazm. 1 According to the Bombay Government records this attack on el- Bahrein was made during the summer of 1816. The Seyyid Sa'id's object is stated to have been the reduction of the Benu-Uttub and the el-Kawasim to his allegiance. The opportunity was well chosen, owing to the reverses which had befallen the Wahhabis, in 1813, at the hands of Muhammad 'Aly P&amp;sha, of Egypt, and the additional confusion into which their affairs had been thrown the year after by the death of their Amir, Su'ud, and the accession of his son, 'Abdallah, The utter failure of the.expedition is attributed to the treachery of the Seyyid Sa'id's allies.sa'jd-p.in-sultan. 3-^7 Perceiving that Suleimau-bin-Himyar was thus making head, the Seyyid Said mustered the people of esh-Sharkiy- yah, and ^Isa-bin-Salih joined him with many of the el- Harth. The el-Hajariyyin also brought a number of their men, and his uncle the Seyyid Muhammad-bin-el-Imam sent him many of the people of es-Suwaik and of el-Khadhra, under the command of Suleitnan-bin-Said-bin-Yahya-bin- 'Abdallah-bin-Muhammad, ed-Darmaky. The Seyyid Said also wrote toMuhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-^Adiwy, who came with a contingent from er-Eastak; all these levies made up a very large force. On reaching Habra, the el-Maawal met him, and from thence he proceeded to Nakhl and put up in the principal mosque, his force extending nearly as far as Hadhain, of Nakhl. Now, Suleiman-bin-Hirayar had ordered the Benu- M-Hadhramy to seize the summit of Jebel-esh-Shaibah and the top of the mountain overlooking el-Fawwarah, but they played him false. Then the Seyyid and his followers at tacked el-Hamam, where Suleiman was posted with two hundred men only, so the latter was obliged to give way and retired by the Wadi, coming to a halt at Sija, losing six men in his retreat. From thence he went to Behla and joined Muhammad-bin-Suleiman. Thereupon the Seyyid ordered the castle atel-Janat to be razed, and afterwards to be rebuilt, leaving it to be held by the Benu-Ruwahah on his behalf. Eventually, he sent the sheikh Nasir-bin-Ja/id- bin-Khamis, el-Kharusy, to invite Suleiman-bin-Himyar to come to Maskat, assuring him of immunity. When Sulei man came he treated him with great consideration. About this time Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry, marched with a large army to es-Sudairah, Seif-bin-Thabit, el-Janiby, having told him that the Al-Wahibah had derided him and were spreading jokes about him far and wide. On reaching es-Sudairah, however, the Al-Wahibah made peace with him, so he left for esh-Sharkiyyah and halted at Khadhra-cd- 43338 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Dufafaah, the people of which appeased him with a large sum of money. Before Hamld's arrival at Khadhra the Seyyid had dispatched Hilal-bin-Hamed-bin-el-lmam-Said, with eighty horsemen, to assist the people against him, but Hilal hearing on the way that matters had been made up between the two parties returned to Bai-kah, and re ported what had occurred to the Seyyid. On Hamid-bin- Nasir^s return to el-'Aineiu he dismissed his force and died a few days after. The people of Nakhl having complained against Suwailim, the Seyyid superseded him by sending Said-bin-Seif-bin- Said to take his place. Then the Seyyid, on heai'ing that Battal-el-Mutairy had come to el-Bereimy with a large cavalry force, ordered Muhammad-bin-Nasir to attack him. Muhammad accord ingly surrounded him, whereupon Battal came to terms with the Seyyid through Muhammad-bin-Nasirand Suwailim- bin-Salim, and agreed to raze the fort. When that was done, he went to the Seyyid Said, who promoted him and did him great honour. Next, the Seyyid Said having heard that Muhammad-bin- ^Alyhad induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, 1 and that the people of esh-Sharkiyyah had sub mitted to him,—moreover, that all the Benu-Hasan of Fdlj- el-Mashayikh had become converts to his doctrines, and that his followers among the people of el-Ashkharah 3 had plundered many English ships which were wrecked at el- Ashkharah,—he applied to the English to aid him in an ex pedition against Muhammad-bin-^Aly and his confederates. They did so without delay, and came in large and small 1 This chief appears to have seceded from the tenets of the Ibadhiyah and to have adopted those of the Wahhabis. 2 The name of a large village on the coast below Ras-el-Hadd, con taining about two hundred houses and one thousand inhabitants, most of whom belong to the Benu-Abi-'Aly tribe.sa'id-bin-sultan. 339 vessels and encamped at Sur. The Seyyid joined them there and accompanied them to Jaalan. On the way ho raised levies from the el-Hashm, the Benu-Jabir, the people of Taiwa, and was subsequently joined by Muhammad-bin- Nasir^ el-Jabry, and Niljim-es-Seyyaby and their respective followers, and the Seyyid encamped with most of the force at Falj-el-Mashayikh. Then the English, together with the Seyyid's soldiers, marched against the Benu-Temam, and on approaching Mahallet-es-Saudah the forces of Muham- mad-bin-'Aly rushed upon them, breaking the ranks of the English, and putting many of them to the sword. The Seyyid's people also fled, and the Seyyid himself was wounded in the hand by a musket-ball, and none stood by him except Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, and Battal-el- Mutairy and their followers. Many of the English and the Seyyid's troops were killed on that day ; the principal among the latter were, 'Aly-bin-Talib-bin-Muheuna, Al- Bii-Saidy, and the son of the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih, el- Harasy, and Said-bin-Seif, ez-Zamily, and Nasir-bin-Seif- bin-Muhammad, el-Mauly, and Nasir-bin-Muhammad, er- liuwahy, and others. Only the el-Hajarriyyin stood up to light with the Benu-Abi-^Aly, the et-Temamiyyin, and they were all slain. The Al-Wahibah kept their ranks, and none of the people of Muhammad-bin-^Aly approached them, neither did they move against their opponents. So the Seyyid and those who were with him returned to Falj-el- Mashayikh. This affair took place on the tenth of Muhar- ram, a.h . one thousand, two hundred 1 Towards evening the remaining English officers said to the Seyyid Said : Do not allow any of your people to ap proach our camp until the morning, for we shall not be able to distinguish them from the followers of Muhammad-bin- 'Aly, and shall consider every Arab who comes near us at 1 The date is incomplete in the original. This first expedition took place towards the end of a.d . 1820, of a.h . 123G.— —rT3 fl'' r 31-0 the imams op oman. night as an enemy, and deal with him accordingly, giving no quarter.' When a part of the night had passed away, shots were heard and loud shouts from the quarter of the Benu-Hdsan, who attempted to surprise the English, while the latter kept up a sharp fire, fearing an onset from Muhammad-bin-'Aly, and as a precaution against Arab treachery. Thereupon many of the Seyyid Said's people fled, and none remained near his tent but Muhamraad-bin- Nasir, el-Jabry, and his followers. Nasr-bin-Said-bin-el- Imam and his men also went away without the Seyyid Said's knowledge. Towards daylight it was reported to the Seyyid that Na- sir and his men had fled during the night. Then he, per ceiving that the edge of the courage of the English had been blunted, and that their numbers had been greatly re duced, ordered a retreat, and he and the English accord ingly returned to Maskat by way of el- 'Akk. 1 At el-Bediy- 1 The following is the official account of this unfortunate expedition : ' On the 8th of November, 1820, the combined forces arrived within three miles of Balad Beni Boo Ali, the residence of the hostile tribe, and a demand was forthwith made for the surrender of their fortifica tions and arms, together with the persons who had murdered the mes senger at A1 Ushkara...]n answer to this summons, the Beni Boo Ali stilted that they were ready to comply with the conditions proposed, except the one stipulating for the surrender of their arms. This modi fication, however, was not acceded to, and the heavy guns and stores being left in the entrenched camp, the combined forces, consisting of four guns, three hundred and eighty sepoys, and two thousand men be longing to the Imaum [the Seyyid Sa'id] moved the next morning towards the enemy's town....On arriving within sight of the town, the light infantry of the 1st battalion, 2nd regiment, which had headed the column in extended order, opened fire and began to fall back, and soon after the enemy appeared in motion on the top of some elevated ground, with the apparent design of turning the right flank. The officer com manding immediately ordered the troops to form column of sections to the right, so as to present a new front, parallel to the enemy's attack, and to charge bayonets Some hesitation on the part of the sepoys is asserted to have been displayed at this moment in obeying this last order, and, as the only course left, they were directed to fire, which Lsa'id-bin-sultan. 341 yali ho was told by the people that Nasir and his followers had passed by them at a gallop, without stopping to inform them of what had occurred between the Seyyid and Muham- mad-bin-'Aly. On reaching Maskat, the Seyyid Said sent the English who had accompanied him from Jaalan to join their companions on board the ships, to whom they related what had befallen them. Thereupon they all started for Bombay. When they reported all that had transpired to him whom their King had invested with supreme power there, he forth with ordered many ships to be prepared, sent many foot soldiers and cavalry on board, with abundance of war mate rial, and appointed a chief over the whole, with detailed in structions, and also special injunctions to the other officers of their King's service. The Seyyid Said was written to and requested to meet them at Sur, which he did, on their was done; but immediately after, on the enemy being within twenty yards of the line, they are alleged by the commanding oflicer to have turned about, and to have thrown themselves on the Imaum's troops in the rear. These soon gave way, and the whole took to flight; being pursued by the enemy in the direction of the entrenched camp at lieni 15oo llussain, within which the remnants of the force were collected. Nearly the whole of the British detachment actually engaged in the action was cut up, together with all their officers, with the exception of two, one of whom afterwards died of his wounds. The Imaum was shot through the hand in endeavouring to save an artilleryman, and seems to have displayed great courage and coolness throughout the affair. An attack of the enemy during the night upon the position at Beni Boo llussain was repulsed, but the commanding officer, finding it could not be maintained, directed the remainder of the detachment to retreat upon Maskat, where they arrived on the 17th of November, 1820.' Bombay Qovernmeni Selections, No. xxiv. pp. 189-90. It is noteworthy that on this occasion Battal -el-Mutairy, the Wah- haby commander, fought on the side of the Seyyid Sa'id. The proba bility is that he was now acting on his own account, for at this period the power of the Wahhabis had been crushed by Ibrahim Pasha, who the year before had reduced ed-Dir'iyyah, their capital, to ruins, and had taken their Amir, 'Abdallah-bin Su'iid, prisoner to Egypt, from whence he was sent to Constantinople, where he was beheaded.!'1 mm mrnmm 342 THE IMAMS OF OMAN. MllS arrival at that place. He was much depressed at the time owing 1 to the illness of his brother Salim, who was suffering' from an attack of paralysis. He encamped with his followers on one side of the English, who by that time had landed all their stores and warlike implements, and had picketed their horses near their tents, taking the greatest precautions in all their movements. Two days after the Seyyid's arrival, however, they were attacked at night by about one thou sand of the confederates of Muhammad-bin-'Aly, under the command of his brother Khadim-bin-'Aly, all mounted on swift dromedaries. They penetrated as far as the tent- ropes of the English encampment, and succeeded in killing several of their men, after which they retired, and reached their own quarters on the following morning. Just as the Seyyid was about to march to Jaalan with the English, he received intelligence of the death of his brother Salim-bin-Sultan, which greatly distressed him. 1 He accord- ingly remained three days longer at Sur to mourn for him. (On this occasion ho confirmed his uncle Talib in his position. r l alib at that time held the fort of er-Rastak, which he had taken from Ahmed, the son of the Imam Said, after his father's death,- in this manner; Talib had built a high house 1 By the death of his elder brother Salim, the Seyyid Sa'id was the only surviving son of the Seyyid Snltan-bin-el-Iinam-Ahmed, his other son Hamed having been killed in the expedition to el-Bahrein ; see p. 336. 2 As the Im^m Sa'id-bin-Ahmed was living in 1811 (see note p. 323 and p. 325), he must have died between that time and 1821, the date of this second expedition against the Benu-Abi-'Aly. It appears from the foregoing account that, on his death, his eldest son Ahmed (erro neously called Ilamed at p. 2-41) succeeded to the government of er- Kastuk, but was treacherously dispossessed by his uncle Talib, the sixth son of the Imam Ahmed, the first of the Al-Bu-Sa'id dynasty. Although the Im&amp;mate had become vacant by the death of the Imam Sa id, no attempt appears to have been made to appoint a successor to that dignity. His nephew Sa'id-bin-Sultan, who had been regent and virtually the sovereign of 'Oman, in succession to his father Sultan, since 1801, still continued to be designated ' Seyyid.' ■ i V- 1sa id-bin-sultan. 343 in Kasra, of er-Rastak, and placed a number of slaves there whom he had purchased. One day, when Ahmed-bin-Said had come to visit him, Talib ordered his slaves to seize and bind him, and then sent the following message to his brother Nasr : ' Unless you quit the fort and castle, I will cut down your date-trees and those of your brother Ahmed.' Nasr accordingly surrendered the fort and castle to Talib, who thereupon released Ahmed. Talib ruled well and gained the affections of the people.) The combined forces then marched towards Jaalan and halted at el-Jindin, in Falj-el- Mashayikh. There the English said to the Seyyid ; ' You remain here in your encampment while we advance against the Benu-Abi-'Aly : we want no Arabs to go with us, all we require is a guide to shew us the way.' The Seyyid ac cordingly furnished them with two guides. When they ap proached the town of the Benu-Abi-'Aly the English com mander ordered the cavalry to attack it on the western, while he went with the rest of the troops towards the eastern side, where he drew them up in columns, placing the Hindus [sepoys] in front, and then directed them to advance. The Benu-Abi-'Aly perceiving this charged the Hindus, broke their ranks, and put many of them to the sword. On ap proaching the next column, however, guns were opened upon them, the shot of which killed Hindus as well as the Benu-Abi-'Aly, only a few of the latter escaping. The cavalry then attacked the place on the western side and entered it, as did the infantry on the eastern side. Then they blew up the forts with gunpowder, set fire to the houses, and took all they found therein prisoners, to the number of three hundred men, among whom were Muham- mad-bin-'Aly and his brother Khadim-bin-'Aly ; most of the women fled to the women of the Abu-H4san. Thus the English destroyed the town of the Benu-Abi-'Aly and left it desolate. Afterwards they returned with their sepoys to the district of the Benu-Hasan, remained there one day, andTHE TMAMS OP OMAN. started on tlio following morning for Siir, from whenco they embarked for Bombay, and the Seyyid Said went back to Maskat, taking with him eighty prisoners of the Benu-Abi- 'Aly. These he confined in the eastern battery, where they died of starvation. Khadim died of his wounds on the road from Siir ; as to his brother Muhammad-bin-'Aly and those who had been taken away by the English in their ships, when they reached India they were unbound and well cared for, the wounded received the best professional treatment, and all lived in great comfort at Bombay. 1 This year, a.h . 1236 [ a.d . 1820-1] a plague 2 broke out in 'Oman and proved fatal to a great many. This plague dif fered from that which occurs at Constantinople, at Damascus, Baghdad, and el-Basrah. It first attacks a man's abdomen, and then matter is ejected from the mouth and the anus until he dies. Some who are seized die at once ; others after two or three days; and only a few survive. God preserve us from so dire a disease ! Great numbers in 'Oman fell victims to it; it prevailed also in India, in Sind, in Mekran, and in the countries of the English and French. It also spread over Persia, and el-Kuwait, and el-Bahrein, and ezh-Zhahirah, and the district of et-Tawwam, and car ried off, God the Creator alone knows how many. 1 This expedition was under the command of Major-General Lionel Smith. ' The division arrived before the capital of the Beni Boo Ali tribe on the 2ud of March, 1821, and after repulsing a very sharp attack of the enemy on the right brigade (consisting of four hundred of H.M.'s 65th regiment, and three hundred of the 1st battalion, 7th regi ment, N.I., under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Warren), took possession of the whole fortified position the same evening. The sepoys on this occasion suffered severely, but the enemy lost upwards of five hundred killed and wounded, while nearly all the remainder, together with their two chiefs, were taken prisoners. After blowing up the works and defences, the forces returned to Soor, and re-embarked for India taking a number of prisoners with them.

To all which the Seyyid agreed, and they accordingly returned to Jaalan and restored their place to its former state. 1 Then the people of Nakhl, on hearing that the sheikh Seif-bin-Nebhan, ez-Zamily, had declined the governorship of that place, came to the Seyyid Said to complain against the conduct of Said-bin-Seif, ez-Zamily; so he appointed Nasir-bin-Khalf, ez-Zamily, to succeed the latter, and ap pointed the sheikh Seif-bin-Nebhan over el-Bunder [el- 'Abbas] and Minau, upon the death of his father Neblum, and of Khalfan-bin-Seif. About this time Saad-bin-Miitlak 2 came to 'Oman as Amir over el-Bereimy on the part of the sons of Silud. 3 On 1 ' In 1823, the Court of Directors sent out instructions to the Bom bay Government to use its influence with his Highness the Imaum [the Seyyid Sa'id] to procure the restoration of the remnants of the Benu Boo Ali tribes to their native seats. This was done, and, after some hesitation and correspondence, his Highness permitted their return to their own residence. The next year Mahomed bin Ali, having repre sented to the Resident in the Persian Gulf the distressed situation in which his tribe was reduced by the total destruction of their houses and watercourses, the sum of 2,500 [another official account says 25,000] German crowns was advanced by the Government to enable them to make the necessary repairs.' Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. p. 191. 2 Incorrectly styled ' Syud bin Mootluk'in the Bombay Govern ment Selections. The first word is a proper name and not the title ' Seyyid,' which in the Selections is usually written ' Syud.' 3 At p. 318 (date, about a.d . 1810), Turky and Faisal are the names given to the ' sons of Su'ud,' the son of 'Abdu-VAziz (p. 297), and the same individuals are apparently indicated here, about sixteen years later. Mr. Palgrave, on the other hand, makes Turky the grandson of Su'ud, and the son of'Abdallah, who was Amir when ed-I)ir'iyyah was destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha in 1818. His list of the succession is as follows :— 44346 THE IMAMS OF OMAN. 'Jjiij reaching el-Bereimy he was well received by the Arabs and Iladhr, and the people of ezh-Zhahirah recognized him. He then levied a large force from el-Bereimy, reinforcing it with contingents from among the Benu-Naim and Kutb, and marched with them to Behla—Muhammad-bin-Suleiman, el-Yaaruby, assisting him with horsemen and foot. He kept his object secret until the feast of the Hijj, when he attacked the el-Hajariyyin, killed several of them, took a large booty, and then returned towards el-Bereimy. He did not halt to rest his animals until he reached Azka, where he remained two days and then went on to el-Bereimy, the fort of which he rebuilt, and when Sinan-bin-Suleiman, el-'Alawy, went to see him, he killed him. Then he wrote to the Seyyid Said apologizing for having attacked the el-Hajariyyin. He had done so, he said, to avenge the death of his father Miitlak, who had met his death at their hands. 1 This excuse was accepted by the Seyyid. 1. S u'ud I., the founder of the dynasty. 2.

We know from other sources that Turky was succeeded by a son named Faisal, who was in his dotage when Palgrave visited Kiy&amp;dh in 1862, and that the government was virtually in the hands of his son 'Abdallah. It will be noticed' that the Su'ud II. of this list is entirely omitted by Mr. Palgrave. 1 See p. 327.sa'id-bin-sultan. 347 Subsequently, the Seyyid levied a large force from Jaalan and other districts, and proceeded with it to el-Bahrein, accompanied by the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry. On quitting Persia the new plague attacked his force, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir advised him to postpone the expedi tion. But the Seyyid determined to proceed, and on reach- ing the island he planted his standard and encamped with his force. His directions to the latter were : ' Do not attack the Benu-^Utbah : let us first have recourse to stra tagem.' This order was disobeyed by 'Abdallah-bin-Salim, ezh-Zhahiry, who marched with his own followers against them. On hearing the shouts from the contending parties the Seyyid set off with his men, and in the encounter which ensued the Benu-'Utbah were put to flight and many of them killed. But when the Seyyid's force saw 'Abdallah- bin-Salim and his party returning, inferring that they had been worsted by the Benu-'L tbah, they forthwith dispersed, and were pursued by the Benu-'Utbah, who played great havoc among the fugitives. After losing many of his men the Seyyid returned to Maskat. 1 1 The English official account of this expedition is as follows;— ' About November, 1828, his Highness arrived off Bahrein with his ileet; and having landed a party of men took possession of the fort outside without any opposition, and had fixed a day for the whole of his forces proceeding against the town of Munamah, when he was surprised to hear that Shaikh Tahnoon [the el-Kawasimy Chief of Abu-Zhdby, one of his allies,J had landed without his orders. Hastily collecting a few of his immediate followers and Nubian slaves, his Highness hurried on shore, to endeavour to avert the consequence of this imprudent pro ceeding. He was, however, too late : a small body of the Uttoobee horse had been previously concealed in some date-groves on the flank, which, issuing out while the Imaum's [the Seyyid Sa'id's] troops were eagerly bearing forward to engage, charged in the rear, and at the same time the L ttoobee infantry making a general advance, the assailants were thrown into great confusion, and at last fled, completely routed, to their boats, leaving a considerable number of killed, wounded, and prisoners behind them.,..Discouraged by this defeat, and the ravages committed among his followers by the cholera morbus, his Highness affected to consider that the hand of Providence was against him, and after an ineffectual attempt to conclude a peace with the Shaikh of348 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. Then he collected a large force and proceeded to Mom- basah, which he attacked with a fleet of large ships and small boats, first opening fire upon the battery of Kaabras, which was returned by the guns of the battery. After he had disembarked and pitched his tent, ^Abdallah-bin-Salim, ezh-Zhahiry, and Hamad-bin-Ahmed, Al-Bu-Saidy, rushed to the assault with their people, followed by the entire force; but the assailants having been repulsed, the Seyyid went back to Zanzibar and from thence embarked forMaskat, where he remained some time. He then went on a second expedition against Mombasah, taking a large force with him. On this occasion the Benu-Mazrua capitulated, on condition that if they surrendered the fort to him they should be at liberty to reside at the place. The Seyyid having agreed to these terms returned to Zanzibar, after placing a garrison of Belooches in the fort. Suleiman-bin-Himyar-bin-Mu- hammad, el-Yaaruby, who had accompanied the expedition against Mombasah, now received the Seyyid's permission to retire. He accordingly returned to his home at el-Abyad, where he died a few days after. On the Seyyid's return to Maskat, the Benu-Mazrua in fringed the treaty of peace by besieging the fort, which the Belooches eventually surrendered to them. Thereupon he levied a large force, and on reaching Mombasah invested the place, and sent a party to attack the fort which commands the road leading to the country of the Wanlkah, which they captured. When those who garrisoned the castle heard Bahrein, he sailed back with his fleet to Muskat, on the 20th of Novem ber. Various reasons were assigned for his Highness having abandoned an enterprise, the preparations of which had cost him so much labour and treasure; but it was generally thought that he either suspected some of his immediate adherents of treachery, or that the unexpected intelligence of a dangerous and spreading rebellion having broken out in his possessions in the African coast had induced him to forego any further attempt upon Bahrein, and hasten back to Muskat.'

Ihey accordingly surrendered, whereupon the Seyyid went back to Zanzibar, taking some of their men with him. He remained at Zanzibar a long time, and then returned to ^Oman, bringing with him the captives of the Benu-Mazrua, whom he sent to Hormuz to be imprisoned, where they subsequently died. 1 Then the Seyyid made Muhammad, the son of his brother Salim-bin-Sultan, Wali over Sohar and IVMskat. At this time certain suspicions were raised in the Seyyid's mind 1 Mombusah was captured from the Portuguese by the Imam Seif- bin-Sultan, of the el-Ya'arubah dynasty, about a.d . 1698, (see p. 92), and appears to have been left in charge of the el-Mazrua', an 'Omany tribe, who had been previously settled there. In process of time these Arabs threw off their allegiance to the 'Omany sovereign, and asserted their independence. In 1823, Suleiman-bin-'Aly, their presiding chief, fearing that the Seyyid Sa'id intended to attack his territories, placed the island and fort of Mombasah under British protection, and in the early part of the following year Captain Owen of the British frigate Leven concluded a convention with him, by which the port of Mombasah and its dependencies, including the island of Peinba, and the coast com prised between Melinda and the river Pangani, were placed under the protectorate of Great Britain. The Seyyid Sa'id having sent in a strong remonstrance against this invasion of his sovereign rights. Captain Owen's proceedings were disallowed by the Indian authorities, which left the Seyyid at liberty to deal as he pleased with his refractory sub jects at Mombasah. According to our author's narrative he undertook three expeditions against that place before it was finally subjected. Judging from the contemporary annals of the Bombay Government, ho started on the first in December 1829, and returned to Maskat from Zanzibar, u where all his plans for the reduction of Mombassa had totally failed, probably in consequence of the hurried manner in which the disturbances in his Arabian territories had called him away,' on the 8th of May, 1830. (On this occasion the Seyyid appears to have visited Zanzibar for the first time.) The second expedition seems to have taken place early in 1832, the Seyyid returning to Maskat towards the end of the same year. Of the third expedition the Government records supply no notice whatever. See Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. pp. 193, 200, 201, 203.THE IMAMS OP OMAN. respecting Hilal-bin-Muhammad-bin-el-Iraam, 1 but he ma naged to dissemble the alienation which they excited. One day, however, when Hilal came to Maskat on a visit to him, as well as on other business, the Seyyid privately instructed Muhammad-bin-Salim to seize him, whicli he did while in his house; whereupon the Seyyid ordered him to be im prisoned in the Western fort. Then the Seyyid started for Zanzibar, leaving Muham- mad-bin-Salim as his deputy over all ^Oman, who, on his part, appointed Suleiman-bin-Salih, Al-Bu-Saidy, Wali at Sohar. Now, Hamvld-bin-- , Azzan 2 had always professed loyalty and attachment botli to the Seyyid Said and to Muhammad-bin-Salim; nevertheless, he was all the time doing what he could to get possession of the fort of Sohar. On making over that place and its dependencies to Sulei man, Muhammad-bin-Salim had given him particular in structions to be on his guard, and to attend strictly to his duties. Suleiman, however, neglected the people as well as the fortifications, absenting himself from Sohar and going about from one place to another; but no one took the trouble to bring his conduct to the notice of Muhammad-bin-Salim. On the other hand, the Sohar people, who were greatly attached to HamM-bin-'Azzan, were constantly urging him to lose no time in coming to them. They had even made ladders to enable him to scale the fort, and repeated in their letters that the garrison was very weak, that the guards were never at their posts, and that Suleiman-bin-Salih was always moving about from one place to another. After a good deal of importunity, and after assuring himself of 1 Ililul was the son of Muhammad, the seventh and youngest of the Imam Ahmed's sons ; see p. 188. 2 Hamud was the son of 'Azzan-bin-Kais, the ImSm Ahmed's third son, (p. 188), who had transferred the government of Sohar to his cousin the Seyyid Sa'id on his departure for the pilgrimage, to be re tained by him in the event of his death ; see p. 328,sa'id-bin-sultan. 351 the truth of those statements, ho left el-Kusair by night with a few followers, and scaled the fort by the ladders which the people of Sohar had prepared for that purpose. He found only a few men in the fort, and those he drove out of it. On the following morning the inhabitants came to make their public submission to him. He then went to Lawa and seized the fort there, which was surrendered un conditionally; afterwards he proceeded to Shinas, and got possession of its fort in the same manner; and then to el- Khabiirah, where he met with the same success. At this time the Seyyid Talib-bin-el-Imam [Ahmed] was at er-Ras- tak, and the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry, at el- llufry. Talib, on hearing what had occurred, went to com municate the intelligence to the sheikh Muhammad, but the latter had been apprised of it before. Thereupon they agreed to proceed to Maskat together, and to act as the daughter of the Imam [Ahmed] might direct. On their arrival, the Imam's daughter said : ' It is useless to summon Hamud to come to us with his followers, for he is now more determined than ever. The tribes have submitted to him, his power is increased, and we may expect some evil at his hands from day to day. Now, this town of Mdskat is the great treasure of 'Oman, and we must have it defended by loyal men who will not turn cowards when their support is needed. Ihe sword does not make brave men falter, but brave men are not made out of cowards.' The Seyyid Talib then re marked to Muhammad, '1 leave you to reply;' whereupon the latter said,Know, then, that the two lives of 'Oman, T mean the el-Yemeniyyah and the Nizariyyah, have become like two serpents : if they are brought together they will certainly do mischief, and our security depends on keeping them apart. Therefore we must choose one of the two.' Both the listeners concurred in this opinion, and expressed their desire to leave the choice to the speaker, assured that he only sought their welfare ; they merely urged the import-352 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. ance of immediate action and the danger of delay. Mu- hammad-bin-Nasir then went on to say: ' the el-Yemeniyyah will neither listen to me nor obey me; but as to the Nizariy- yah—I say it without boasting—they will follow where I lead.' They replied : ' Bring them to us at once, for we are determined to abide by your counsels.' He left them on Friday for Semail and returned a week afterwards, ac companied by one thousand five hundred men levied at that place and elsewhere.' Now, Hamud-bin-'Azzan had contemplated an attack on Maskat, and had collected a large force with that object, towards the attainment of which he was constantly writing to the eastern and western tribes to secure their support. But when he heard that Muhammad-bin-Nasir had stationed himself at Maskat with a force consisting principally of the Nizariyyah, he apprehended that the Arabs and Hadhr of ezh-Zhahirah and et-Tawwam would lean towards the Ni zariyyah, consequently he abandoned his design against M^skat and remained at Sohar. When the Benu-Naim heard that Muhammad-bin-Nasir was in league with Muhammad-bin-Salim and the daughter of the Imam, they attacked and captured the tower at esh- Shukairy, and occupied Hamud by making incursions into the territory of Sohar. The Seyyid Said, who was at that time at Zanzibar, on hearing of these proceedings on the part of Hamud hastened to Maskat. On his arrival he released Hilal-bin-Muhain- mad-bin-el-Imam, who thereupon went to es-Suwaik, and he was very grateful to Muhammad-bin-Nasir for his valuable services, and appointed him over the fort at Semail. Then he embarked for Sohar, taking about thirty ships with him, and dispatched Hamad-bin-Ahmed to invite Hamud to a conference, giving him an assurance of safety ; but Hamud declined the invitation and refused to see Hamad. Then the Seyyid sent his nephew Muhammad-bin-Salim on a45 sa'id-bin-sultan. 353 simitar* errand, and he had an interview with Ilamftd near Sohar, which resulted in a reconciliation on the following terms Ilamud gave up all claim to independent authority over the subjects of the Seyyid Said, and engaged to do nothing without his orders. Accordingly, when the Seyyid left for Maskat, Hamiid began writing to the Seyyid's sub- jects, enjoining them not to rebel against him. The Seyyid Said left him to act as he pleased, and felt no further anxiety about him. Before setting out for Zanzibar the Seyyid appointed his son Hilal-bin-Said 1 as Wali over Mdskat, directing him not to take any important step without the sanction of Muham- mad-bm-Sahm. He also appointed Suud-bin-'Aly-bin-Seif- bm-el-Imam 2 as Wali over Barkah. After he had reached Zanzibar, the Seyyids Hilal and Muhammad-bin-Salim went to Barkah on a visit to Sdiid, having full confidence in him; but when they entered the fort Siiild ordered them to be seized, and put to death one of their retinue, namely, Khal- fan - bin - Muhaisin, the Maula of the el-Jibur, whom he accused of having been one of the Seyyid Said's accomplices m the murder of his uncle Bedr-bin-Seif. 3 On hearing of tins proceeding, the Seyyidah, the daughter of the Imam, Avas in great dread of Suild's coming to Maskat, so she wrote to Muhammad-bin-Nasir to join her without delay. He obeyed, and brought with him a large force of the Ni- zanyyah of the Wadi-Semail, and others, and stationed them m all the fortifications, with the exception of the two forts, the two batteries, and the Island. Now, before Suud seized Hiiai and Muham mad-bin-S41im war had broken out between the inhabitants of Nakhl and 1 '* la l.T aS the Seyyid Sa,id,8 secoud son 5 the name of his eldest son was Ivh&amp;lid.

On reaching the market-place they were met by the defenders, and after a sharp fight with swords and musketry the el-Maawal were driven oft', with the loss of Salim-bin-'Abdallah, ez-Zamily, and five others. Nasir-bin-Khalf kept himself shut up in the fort. Then Suud proceeded to el-Masnaah, taking with him the Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Salim as a prisoner, and encamped with his force among the hillocks on the eastern side. The two Seyyids, Hamed and Sirhan, the sons of Salim-bin- Sultan, 1 were at that time in the fort, which was garrisoned by slaves under the command of Miftah-Rashid. Miftah thereupon sent his two masters to Maskat, an(J showed such a bold front to Suud that the latter returned to Barkah without effecting his object. When the Seyyid Said heard of these proceedings on the part of Suud he was greatly surprised; in the mean time, the daughter of the Imam sent to the latter begging him to release his two captives, but he refused to do so, except for a certain sum of money. When she sent him the amount demanded, the prisoners were set at liberty and returned to Mdskat. Then the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Masir went to Sem ail and from thence to Nakhl, and succeeded in effecting a reconciliation between the inhabitants and Nasir-bm- Khalf. On the arrival of the Seyyid Said at Maskat he summoned Sufid to his presence, but he refused to come, unless accom panied by Muhammad-bin-Nasir, el-Jabry. Muhammad accordingly went with him, and a reconciliation took place between him and the Seyyid, on condition that he was to restore the fort at Barkah to the Seyyid, who was to give him instead that of er-Rastak, (for before this time the fort there had devolved to the Seyyid Said by the death ot i Brothers of Muhammad-bin-Salim, the Seyyid Sa'id's nephew.sa'id-bin-sultan. 355 Tillib.) Suud having consented to these terras, the fort at Jiarkah was made over to the Seyyid through Muhammad- bin-Nasir, and that at er-Rastak was given to Suud. On this occasion the Seyjid gave the fort of Bddbad to Mu- hainraad-bin-Nasir. Before returning to Zanzibar the Seyyid appointed his son J huwamy-bin-Said 1 Wali over Maskat,and made Haraad- bm-Ahmed Wali over Nakhl; but, in the mean time, Ha mad accompanied him on his voyage, and he sent him to attack Siwy/ while he himself went on to Zanzibar. Hamad was successful at Siwy, the people there agreeing to all the Seyyid's demands; so, leaving some of his men in the place, he went to Zanzibar, from whence, by the Seyyid's orders, he returned to 'Oman. From Maskat he went to take up his appointment at Nakhl, and administered its affairs so well that he gained the praise and goodwill of the inhabitants. J he people of Siwy having broken their engagements, the Seyyid wrote to Hamad to undertake an expedition against them, sending him a large sum of money for that purpose. Hamad was unsuccessful on this occasion, for the people resisted him and he was obliged to flee to Zanzibar, after losing many of his followers. hon Suud heard of Hamad^s defeat he was greatly de lighted. He went out to hunt one evening, leaving Hamud- bin-Bedr-bin-Seif-bin-el-Imam 3 as his deputy in the fort. On his return he entered the Masjid of el-Manser, at er-Ras- tuk, in order to take a nap, when Sultan-bin-el-Imam-Ah- Ihuwainy was the Seyyid Sa'id's third son, and the eldest of his male children at the time of his death, a.d. 1856, Colonel liigby, who was for several years British Agent at Zanzi- 1 iar, says that Siwy is situated near Brawa, on the east coast of Africa, but 1 cannot find the name in any of our maps or charts. 1 Another of the Im&amp;m Ahmed's great-grandsons, through his fourth son, Seif.

This took place a.h . 1248 [ a.d . 1832.] When Hamud-bin-'Azzan heard that Sultan had killed Suud, and that the fort [of er-Rastak] had afterwards fallen into the hands of Hamud-bin-Bedr-bin-Seif,—perceiving, moreover, that the Seyyids, the sons of Said, delayed going to er-Rastak, he proceeded thither with a large force, and so terrified Hamud that the latter surrendered the fort to him unconditionally. When the Seyyid Said heard of these proceedings he returned forthwith to Maskat, and ordered Hamad-bin- Ahmed and Suleiman-bin-Said-bin-Yahya-bin-'Abdallah- bin-Muhammad-bin-'Abdallah, ed Darmaky, and Sawailim- bin-Salimin, to proceed against er-Rastak. Suleiman ac cordingly occupied the fort of the el-Mazana, with their consent, and Suwailim-bin-Salimin encamped with the cavalry around it, while Hamad-bin-Ahmed and his fol lowers from Nakhl took up a position at some distance from them. Hamud, who was at the time at er-Rastak, being apprised of these movements, had raised large levies from Sohar and its dependencies, and joined to them a great many Arabs and Hadhr. Suwailim and Suleiman getting wind of this took to flight, but Hamad and his force re mained encamped in the open outskirts of er-Rastak, and on learning that Hamud had reached el-Ghashb he marched out to meet him, but was defeated with the loss of some ot his men, among whom was Suleiman-bin-Khalfan-bin-]\Ia- lik, el-Yaaruby. Thereupon Hamud entered the fort, taking Hamad with him under arrest, but he pardoned him. Then Ghaith, el-Yaaruby, came to request an assurance of im munity for himself, but he had him put to death. He then set Hamad at liberty, and caused the fort of the Benu- jMazrua to be razed, dismantled it of its guns, and added them to the armament of the great fort. 1 Also great-grandson to the Imam Ahmed, through his second son, the Imam Sa'id. Sa'id begat Ahmed, and Ahmed begat Sultan.sa'id-bin-sultan. 357 The Seyyid Said, who was at Maskat, was very much exasperated against Hamud, and wrote to the Al-Wahibah, the el Hajariyyin, and the el-Earth, as also to Muhammad- bin-Nasir to join him at el-Masnaah, with their arms, while he himself proceeded thither by sea with a number of ships. On their arrival he disembarked and pitched his tents near the fort, and distributed large sums of money among the lc\ ies. Hearing that Hamud was moving towards him he ordered the Al-Wahibah, who were commanded by Nasir- bin- Aly-bin-Mdtar, el-\\ahiby, and the el-Hajariyyin, and the el-Harth to march against him; but the two latter, who were not wholly subservient to him, said : 'We have come at your summons to effect a reconciliation between you and your cousin Ilamud ; but we will not draw our swords either against the children or the grandchildren of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Said/' The Seyyid Said was so furious at this reply that he directed the sheikh Muhammad-bin-Nasir to proceed to ezh-Zhahirah and levy the Nizariyyah there ; also to et-iawwam and levy its Nizariyyah, as well as the Arabs, and Iladhr, and march down with them to Sohar, 'where, (uul willing,'' said he, 'you will find me with my ships on your arrival. We will then attack its walls, and let God decide betwixt me and Hamiid.' Thereupon the Seyyid returned to Maskat, where he loaded his ships with soldiers, arms, provisions, and money, while Muhammad went to Semail, and from thence to ezh-Zhahirah, by way of el-'Akk and Azka. On reaching el-'Ainein he solicited the aid of the sheikh Rashid-bin-Hannd, el-Ghafiry, who forthwith mus tered the Belooches, the Benu-Shakil, the el-Miyayahah, the Benu-Kelbiin, the el-'Obriyyin, the Benu-Yaakub,and others. I hese, on reaching el-Bereimy, were joined by the Benu- Kaab, and the Benu Nairn and Kutb, and their allies, highty sheikhs of the Arabs and Hadhr responded to the call, and their combined forces numbered several thousands.

Thereupon he directed Muhammad-bin-Nasir to bring the sheikhs of the Nizariyyah who had come with him to his vessel, and when they came he distributed thousands of dollars among them, besides robes of honour and other pre sents, and having informed them that he had come to terms with Hamud he dismissed them all, and they started for their several homes. Then there arose a dispute between the sheikh Muham mad-bin-Nasir and the sheikh Sirhan-bin-Suleiman, el- Jabiry, on account of the latter having succeeded in effecting an alliance with the Benu-Ruwahah and the el-Harth; and the sheikh Rashid-bin-Said-bin-Muhammad, el-Jilany, el- Jabiry, and his allies among the Benu-Jabir and the el- Hadhramy sided in this matter with Muhammad-bin-Nasir, who wrote to the Benu-Ruwahah calling upon them to with draw from the compact which they had formed with Sirhan. As they refused to do so, he attacked them, entering their town of Wabal, cutting down its date-trees, and killing three of their people, losing one man on his side, a chief of the Benu-'l-Hadhramy, and then retiring. Thereupon Sirhan wrote requesting those who bore arais among them to join him, and he posted them in a building belonging to the people of Hail. Muhammad-bin-Nasir having besieged them there, they offered to capitulate, on condition that they should be allowed to take their arms with them, the el-J dnabah, acting as mediators between the two parties. Muhammad-biu-Nasir having agreed to the proffered terms they evacuated the place and returned home. Subsequently, Sirhan himself had an interview with him, and they weresa'id-bin-sultan. 369 reconciled; but shortly after Sirhan broke his engagement and summoned the Benu-Ruwahah and the el-Harth to join him. They did so, and went down to Sija, where they had an engagement with the Benu-Jabir and the el-Hadhramy, who took part with -M^ihammad-bin-Nasir. both sides usinf ' o muskets; Said-bin-Nasir-bin-Muhammad, er-Ruwahy, and Muhammad, the Beloochee, falling on the side of the Benu- Ruwahah, and a Maula of his Mawala on the side of Mu hammad's partisans. Then the sheikh 'Isa-bin-Salih went down to Semiiil with his followers, but the inhabitants of el- Alayah prevented him from proceeding to lower Semail, dreading Muhammad-bin-Nasir's vengeance, whereupon 'Isa returned to el-'ldd. (Now Muhammad-bin-Nasir had only with him a small force of the Nizariyyah of Semail, and the fort of el-'Idd at that time was under his authority, and he had placed it in command of Hashil and a few of the Mawala of the el-Jibur.) When the people of es-Safa and el-Hajir heard the report of guns from el-'ldd they went to Muham mad-bin-Nasir, who ordered them to go there. On reaching it they engaged 'Isa-bin-Salih's force, killing two of his men and losing three themselves. Thereupon the sheikh 'Isa returned to the Wadi of the Benu-Ruwahah, where he re mained a couple of days, and then went back to esh- Sharkiyyah. Then Muhammad-bin-Nasir wrote letters summoning the Nizariyyah, and he was joined by the el- Janabah and the el-Masakarah, and some of the Benu-Kutb. Then the Nizariyyah of Semail and its dependencies mus tered, and he was further reinforced by some men of Nakhl and three hundred of the Benu-Jabir, the people of et-Tau : in all, a very large force was assembled with him at Sija. Taking these with him he demolished the house of Sirhan- bin-Suleiman and cut down his date-trees; from thence he marched against the Benu-Ruwahah and encamped with his force near Wabal. When he was about to attack the Benu- Ruwahah, Matar-bin-Matar, el-Muhall, Al-Bfi-Saidy, came300 THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. from the Seyyid Said in order to effect a reconciliation be tween the contending parties. Muhammad was unwilling to act contrary to the Seyyid's wishes; so Matar went to the Benu-Kuwahah and brought their chiefs to Muhammad-bin- Nasir, and, peace having been made between them, all re turned to their respective abodes. Before the Seyyid Said embarked for Zanzibar a ship be longing to the English Government came to Mdskat, he having sent them full details of Hamud's proceedings. Thereupon the commander went with his ship to Sohar and brought Hamud to the Seyyid, and peace was concluded between them, Hamiid giving a written promise that he would not stir up strife against the Seyyid Said or his children, and would cease from all hostilities against llilal- bin-Muhammad-bin-el-Imam and his people. Ihis matter being settled, the Seyyid embarked for Zanzibar with a large force, under the command of Hamad-bin-Ahmed, Al- Bft-Saidy, and 'Abdallah-bin-Salim. On reaching Mombasah he dispatched those two commanders to attack Siwy, while he proceeded to Zanzibar. The attack upon Siwy failed, for the people engaged the assailants and drove them off, with the loss of Hamad and 'Abdallah-bin-Salim, ezh-Zhahiry, and a great many of their followers, who were killed on the occasion. 1 Then Muhammad-bin-Nasir made preparations to attack er-Rastak and to seize it on behalf of the Seyyid Said, in consequence of Hamud-bin-'Azzan's intrigues. It appears that the latter had recommenced writing to the Seyyid's subjects, urging them to throw off his authority, and had moreover attacked es-Suwaik and plundered the market i This expedition took place in 18-14. ' The Seyyid Sa'id's troops were defeated with severe loss, and compelled to retire ; many of them were slain, and among the number Ilumeed bin Ahmed, who went in command of the expedition; also Nazzir bin Ali, late Knvoy to Eng land.'

Muhammad, determined to arrest these proceedings, summoned the principal Niz^riyyah, and wrote to those a' a distance, fixing a time when they should join him against Hamud and 'Isa-bin-Salih ; but he died at Azka before the appointed time arrived. Hamud, however, was fully bent on breaking the treaty with the Seyyid Sdid: he even went Bombay to request the English Government not to interfere in the dispute be twixt him and the Seyyid.' The only reply he received was : ring us a letter from the Seyyid stating that the treaty betwixt you has been cancelled by him.' Despairing of any encouragement in that quarter, he returned to Sohar and assumed a life of strict piety and asceticism, mating over the fort to the learned sheikh Said -bin-Khalfiln-bin-Ahmed-bin- Salih, el-Khalily, and the sheikh Hamed, the Amir of the Al-Saad. Shortly after, however, he renounced these as sumptions and removed the two sheikhs above-named from the fort, appointing his son Seif-bin-Hamfld in their stead and placing the sheikh Said-bin-Khalffin over the fort of er- Rastak. Thereupon this sheikh Said and the sheikh Hdmed, es- baadj, together with the heads of the Al-Saad, proposed to set up an Imam of their own, who was to be invested with supreme authority. They offered the dignity to Hamud, who at first agreed to accept it, but afterwards declined • whereupon the Benu-Saad dispersed to their several homes, Hamud going to Sohar, where he remained a short time! On his return to er-Rastak he removed the sheikh Said-bin- Khalfan from the fort, and placed it in the hands of the Benu-Hinah. He then paid SoMr another visit, and from thence went to el-Kusairah. - If the foregoing narrative is consecutive, this visit of Hamud bin- ^ zzan to Bombay must have occurred subsequently to 1844: the Go vernment Records, however, only mention his having visited Bombay in362 THE IMAMS OP 'OMAN. Seif-bin-Hatnud, having by ttis timG succscdcd in. gaming the affections of the people of Sohar, began to be ambitious. He discharged the garrison left in the fort by his father, and placed men of his own in their stead; set his father s authority at defiance ; refused to admit any into Sohar whom he knew to be on his father's side ; would not remit to his father any of the revenue of the place ; acted as if he were entirely independent; and cultivated the alliance of the Seyyid Thuwainy-bin-Said. His father's exasperation was so great that he suborned some of his servants and officers to put him out of the way. They accordingly murdered him in his bed, and his father forbade all public mourning for his death. 1 By this means Hamud again came into pos session of the fort of Sohar, and of all the other forts which had been held by his son. When the Seyyid Said heard of the murder and of Hamud's proceedings generally, in violation of the treaty which he had made with him through the intervention of the English, he wrote a statement of the case and sub mitted it to the English authorities. They replied: He has no longer any claim upon us, for we are convinced that he has broken his engagements; do with him whatever you please.' So he directed his son Thuwainy to move against him, and Thuwainy eventually seized him—after a series^ of efforts too long to be narrated—on the shore near Shinas, brought him to Mlskat, and confined him in the Eastern fort, where he died. 2 He was buried in the grave opposite 1 ' The father, ever jealous of the son, resolved to destroy him, and hired the confidential servant of his master to carry into execution his base and treacherous purpose.

Now Kais suspected Kahtan-bin-Seif-bin-'Aly of having been one of the number of those who had instigated the ^ ^ huwainy to seize his brother Hamud, grounding his suspicions on Ivahtan's frequent interviews with Thuwainy previous to his brother's capture. Kais kept his suspicions to himself; nevertheless, Kahtan was in great dread of him, living secluded among his relatives of the Benu-Ris, at Fazah. Jt was decreed, however, that he should go to Sohar, where he was seized, imprisoned, and slaughtered like a lamb. 1 A\ hen the Seyyid Thuwainy heard of this outrage he was greatly incensed against Kais, and collected a large force to attack him. Kais did the same, and the two armies en camped on the borders ofel-Khadhra,notfarfrom one another. At this juncture some peacemakers intervened and suc ceeded in persuading Kais to return to Sohar and Thuwainy to Maskat; so there was no fighting between them. J hen Kais-bin-'Azzan entered in a correspondence with the terms of the treaty concluded between Syud Saeed and himself.... After receiving a visit from Syud Ilumood bin Azan, it was proposed that they should proceed inland on a pleasure excursion....Then Soweynee determined to make his guest a captive ; and at Shinas he caused him to be seized, bound, and conveyed to the frigate in chains....On his return to ?.Iuskat he threw his prisoner into a dungeon, and the treatment which he received at his hands was of a very severe character. He was loaded with chains, and confined in a place of heat unbearable; no liberty, no comforts, no freedom from restraint was accorded him ; health gave way, and nature quickly sank under such cruel usage.'' Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv, pp. 228-230. 1 u hen the news of his brother's death reached Syud Ghes, his fiery temper became inflamed with exceeding rage: he burned for revenge, and eagerly sought for a victim whereon to vent his fury. He sought not in vain : the brave and courageous Shaikh Kahtan bin Syf was caught intriguing, cast into prison, and doomed to perish.' Idem, p. 230.THE IMAMS OF 'OMAN. Sultan-bin-Sakar, and secured his cooperation against Thu- wainy. Sultan accordingly collected a strong force and proceeded with it to Shinas, which he besieged for many days. (The fort there at that time was in the possession of the Seyyid Said and his son Thuwainy.) In this matter, the Al- Khariban [?] of the Benu-Naim sided with Kais, while the Al-Abi-Shamis sided with the Seyyid Said and his son Thuwainy. The Wahhabis, however, kept aloof and took no part in the quarrel; for they used to receive the Sohar Kdnun from Kais, and the Maskat Kanun from the Seyyid Said, and from Thuwainy whenever his father was absent at Zanzibar. 1 1 This is the first distinct intimation given by the author of an annual Kdntin, or Tribute, (in the shape of Zakdt, or Obligatory Alms for reli gious purposes,) having been paid to the AN ahhabis by Mdskat and Sohar. It seems highly probable that some arrangement to that effect was made as early as 1811, when 'Oman was invaded by Mutlak-el-Mutairy, acting under instructions from Su'ud-bin-'Abdu-'l-'Aziz, the ahhaby Amir of Nejd, and after the Seyyid Sa'id had appealed in vain for assistance to the British authorities in India, who ' recommended him to grant the terms of pacification solicited by the AVahabees, if consistent with the honour and security of the State of Muscat.' Bombay Government Selections, No. xxiv. p. 182. On referring to pp. 324-5 of this History, the reader will see how 'Azzan-bin-Kais, of Sohar, on that occasion, ' came to terms with Miitlak,' and that the Seyyid Sa'id sent him a u present' of forty thousand dollars in order to secure the country gene rally from the inroads of the Wahhabis. It is very likely that the pay ment of this tribute was suspended in 1813, when the AN ahhabis re ceived a severe check from the tigyptian army. Ibis reverse fol lowed the year after by the death of their Amir, Su ud, and in 1819 their power was wholly overthrown by Ibrahim Pasha, of Egypt, who sent their Amir, 'Abdallah-bin-Su'ud, a captive to Constantinople, where he was executed. Turky and Faisal, the sons of Su'ud, had partially reestablished Wahhaby supremacy in Nejd, about a.d . 1828-9, when Sa'ad- bin-Mutlak, their general, came into 'Oman to avenge his father's death (p. 345); and according to the Bombay Government records it was in 1833 that the Seyyid Sa'id, ' finding the integrity of his domi nions seriously menaced, considered it his best policy to form a closer connection with the Wahhaby chief, and agreed to pay him a tribute of five thousand German crowns per annum.' This History, however,T i sa'id-bin-sultan. 3G5 When the Seyyid Said heard of what Kais had done to Kahtan, and how Sult^n-bin-Sakar had taken his part, and the position which Sultan had consequently assumed at fehinas, he remarked to some of his intimates : ' Sultan-bin- Sakar has sided with Kais on account of Kahtan, who took DaLa and 1 akkan from him without my authority; and when Sult&amp;n-bin-Sakar wrote to complain to me I told him that I was too far away to interfere, and left him to settle the dis pute as he pleased. On receipt of my letter he proceeded to Daba and I 1 akkan, and retook both those places. I am con vinced that it was his annoyance on this score which induced him to coalesce with Kais/' When the Seyyid Said reached Maskat he was very indignant at some proceedings on the part of the sheikh Seif-bin-Nebhan, who, on being apprised thereof, came in person to Maskat, where he died a few days after. On the Seyyid's arrival he had dispatched letters summoning all the tribes of ^Oman, and when they came he showered attentions upon their chiefs, small and great, and selected the two tribes, the el-Yemeniyyah and the en- Nizariyyah, to accompany him in his projected attack on Sohar. Accordingly, large numbers of them from Jaalan, and Sur, and ezh-Zhahirah joined him. Moreover, before setting out for Sohar he wrote to Sultan-bin-Sdkar, el- Hawaly, el-Kasimy, requesting him to forego his alliance makes no mention of that transaction. Turky-bin-Su'ud was murdered in 1884, and was succeeded by his son Faisal, who was taken prisoner in 1838 by Muhammad 'Aly Pasha, of Egypt, and did not succeed in reestablishing himself as the legitimate head of the Wahhabis until 1843 during which interval the payment of the tribute from 'Oman was pro bably suspended. In 1845, however, it would appear that the Wahhabis again invaded 'Oman, when the Seyyid Thuwainy 'agreed to renew in his father's name, the annual tribute of five thousand German crowns and to pay an additional sum of two thousand crowns on this occasion » {Precis regarding Muscat and its Relations with the Wahhdbis, p. in. presume that this is the KAnUn referred to in the text, which from t at time up to about 1850 had been regularly paid by Maskat • the amount of tribute paid by the chief of Sohar is not stated.f sfej : ill ■/ ■ Wf-tw | Wl 1 ®'!; r ■. ■ 'Uh vff 3G6 THE IMAMS OP OMAN. with Kais. Sultan was at that time residing at Shinas, and on receiving the letter went to Sohar, where he found Kais by no means disinclined to fight. Thereupon Sultan left him, and returned and encamped with his force at Shinas. The levies of the Seyyid Said having greatly increased, his principal advisers urged him to proceed forthwith against Sohar and its fortified dependencies. He accordingly em barked with all his forces for el-Khaburah, the el-Janabah of Sur and 'Oman acting in concert with him, as did also the sheikh Eashid-bin-Hamid-bin-Nasir, el-Ghafiry. The fort of el-Khaburah having surrendered at discretion, the Seyyid announced his intention of building a strong fort and establishing an open market at Saham. Ihis announcement had the effect of restraining the opposition of his adversaries and of strengthening the attachment of those who were loyal to him. After spending a few days at el-Khaburah he re turned to Maskat, and from thence started by sea for Sohar, where Sultan-bin-Sakar had an interview with him and pro mised to forego his alliance with Kais. Thereupon he in vited Kais to a personal conference, but the latter refused to come, so the Seyyid went back to Maskat. At Maskat the Seyyid Said received a visit from MaktAm, el-Yasy, who came to him accompanied by many of his tribe, the Benu-Yas, and the Seyyid directed him to attack Shinas. (There had been some correspondence between Maktum and the Seyyid Thuwainy prior to this visit of the former.) Maktum accordingly went to Shinas and took the fort for the Seyyid, after a short war; and the two Seyyids, Muhammad-bin-Salim and Thuwainy-bin-Said, who had followed Maktum, finding on their arrival that he had been successful, thanked him heartily for his services, and the Seyyid Thuwainy took over the fort from him. Kais began now to be convinced that it was useless to continue the contest, for the people showed no disposition to support him. He accordingly proposed a reconciliation ;sa'id-bin-sultan. 867 with the two Seyyids, and surrendered the fort of Lawa to the Seyyid Thuwainy, as an earnest of his sincerity. Mu- hammad-bin-Salim then brought him to Maskat, and a treaty of peace was concluded betwixt hira and the Seyyid Said on these terms:—he was to give up the fort at Sohar, and was to receive in its stead the fort of er-Eastak, and to abstain in future from all acts of disloyalty. The fort of Sohar was therefore delivered up to the Seyyid Thuwainy, and thus an end was put to the war betwixt him and Kais. 1 After the Se yyid Said s departure for Zanzibar, Kais broke off coming to Maskat; nevertheless, the Seyyid Thuwainy did not inter fere with him in any way. The Seyyid Said had not been long at Zanzibar before the Persians attacked and seized Minau and Bunder-el-'Abbas and their dependencies. In the mean time, es-Sudairy had come to el-Bereimy, commissioned by the sons of Sufid, and the Arabs of esh- Shamal and the Iladhr of ezh-Zhahirah had submitted to him. Thereupon the Seyyid Thuwainy sent Hilal-bin-Mu- hammad-bin-el-Imam and Nasir-bin-'Aly-bin-Talib, Al-Bii- Saidy, to confer with him. Es-Sudairy made the most extra- 1 These occurrences are generally corroborated by the following official record: ' Syud Ghes [Kais] was called upon to restore the forts which he had lately seized, with the assistance of his ally Shaikh Sultan bin Suggar, on the Batinah coast. He refused, and hostilities were at once commenced....The campaign opened in September 1851, and began auspiciously enough for the cause of his Highness. Kas- beeah fell without a struggle ; Khaboorah was taken after a bombard ment of two days' duration ; and other preparations were in course, when his Highness effected a meeting with Sultan bin Suggur, and induced him to abandon the cause of the Sohar chief. Deserted by the Joasmees, opposed by the combined forces of Syud Saeed and the Shaikh of Debaye, Syud Ghes stood but little chance of success. He turned, however, to bay, with much display of fierceness, and strove to meet his opponents single-handed. They proved too strong for him : Shinas fell an easy prey to the allied armies, and Syud Ghes was compelled to surrender. Sohar was handed over to his Highness ; Rastag and Hebee [?] remained in the possession of Syud Ghes, who also received from the Muskat Government a pension of two hundred dollars per mensem.'

Seif refusing to obey, an outbreak was imminent, but some of the el-Janabah intervened, and es-Sudairy was appeased by a sum of money which Seif forwarded to him through the el-Janabah. Es-Sudairy then went to Nezwa, whore he put up for a few days with the Wali, Seif-bin-'Amr-biu- Khalfan, and then returned to el-Bereimy. When the Seyyid Said heard at Zanzibar of the seizure of his forts in Persia by the Persians, of the disturbed state of 'Oman owing to the visit of es-feudairy, and his demands i That is, five thousand crowns per annum ; see note, p. 365. But according to the following official summary of the events connected with this new invasion of the Wahhabis, in 1852, the amount was raised to twelve thousand crowns;—'Thereturn of thelmaum [the Seyyid Sa'id] to his African possessions was the signal for fresh disturbances, and at this juncture the Wahabee Chief once more advanced towards Oman. He came avowedly as the arbiter and redresser of wrongs which the Chief of Sohar and the tribes on the Batina coast had suffered at the hands of the Imaum [the Seyyid Sa'id]. On his arrival at Brymee the ahabee Chief made demands for the immediate cession of Sohar, and the pay ment of so large an amount of tribute, that it was clear he intended to enter on hostilities against Muscat. The active intervention of the Resident at this period, and the moral support afforded to the Govern ment of Muscat by the appearance of a war vessel on the Arabian coast, induced the Wahabee Chief to enter into negotiations, which ended in 'a Treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between Syud Thoweynee and Abdoola bin Fysul, whereby the Muscat Government agreed to pay to the AV ahabee Ameer an annual tribute of twelve thousand crowns, besides arrears to the extent of six thousand [or sixty thousand] crowns, and the usual supply of provisions and stores. r l he AN ahabee likewise pledged himself to assist Thoweynee in every hour of difficulty, and the boundaries of the dominions of either remained as heretofore.'

But the Seyyid was greatly exasperated against Seif-bin-Nebhan-bin-Said, el-Mauly, for some proceedings on his part which had given rise to much disloyalty; consequently, when Seif visited him at Maskat ho showed him no attention or courtesy. Seif was kept in a state of anxiety for a short time, and then died at Maskat. The Persians, having established themselves in the Sey- yid's fortified posts in Persia, became very overbearing after [the expulsion of] the sheikh Seif-bin-Nebhan, committing great outrages upon the Seyyid's subjects and allies. He accordingly collected a large force, consisting chiefly of the el-Yemeniyyah and Nizariyyah of esh-Sharkiyyah and Jaalan; and, of the Hadhr of'Oman, the el-'Awamir and the people of Nezwa and Manh, and others. These he dispatched under his son, the Seyyid Thuwainy, who suc ceeded in recapturing Bunder-el-'Abbas, Minau, Semil, and other places from the Persians. Shortly after, however, the Persians again attacked Bunder-el-'Abbas and Minau, and although the Seyyid Thuwainy fought bravely, the Persians were the victors and succeeded in capturing many of his people, whom they took to Shiraz and treated with great indignity, exposing them to public ridicule. Then the Seyyid J huwainy, having embarked the remainder of his men on board his ships, blockaded the Persians, cutting off their supplies from India, and greatly depressing the mer chants, whose trade was stopped thereby. Thereupon the Persians made overtures for peace, and the Seyyid Said dispatched Muhatnmad-bin-Salim to them, and he returned to Mdskat with some of their officials. A treaty of peace was then concluded on those conditions: the Persians were to restore to the Seyyid Said all the posts which he had pre- 47I fllll t ■ j?-''' ' : ^ ill; 370 THE IMAMS OV 'OMAN. viously held, and to give up all the property which they had seized from the late sheikh Seif-bin-Nebhan. The war was thus brought to an end by the Seyyid Said getting back from the Persians all the posts for his son, Thuwainy-bin- Said. 1 Then when the commotions in 'Oman had been quieted, and those places in Persia and elsewhere which were under the government of the Seyyid Said were tran quillized, the Seyyid himself hastened to Zanzibar; but the decree of fate overtook him, as we have already narrated, in the sea of the Seychelles. 2 His life and actions were the theme of many poems.

TllK END.APPENDIX. (A) on the title of ' imam.' J. he word ' Imam' comes from an Arabic root signifying to aim at, to follow after, most of the derivatives of which partake, more or less, of that idea. Thus Imdm means, primarily, an exemplar, or one whose example ought to be imitated. 1 It is applied in that sense, /car' t^ox^v, to Muhammad, as being the leader and head of the Muslims in civil and religious matters, and also to the Khalifahs, or legitimate Successors, as his representatives in both capacities. It is also given—in its religious import only—to the heads of the four orthodox sects, namely, the el-Hanafy, esh- Shafa iy, el-Maliky, and el-Hanbaly; and, in a more restricted sense still, to the ordinary functionary of a mosque who leads in the daily prayers of the congregation—an office usually conferred on individuals of reputed piety, who are removable by the Ndzirs, or wardens, and who, with their employment and salary, lose the title also. The term is used in the Kuran to indicate the Book, or Scrip tures, or record of a people; also, to designate a teacher of reli • gion. Hence, most probably, its adoption by the Muslims in the lat ter sense. ' When the Lord tried Abraham with certain words, which he fulfilled. He said, I have made thee an Inuim to the people.' Again, referring to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 'We have made them Imams that they may direct others at our com mand.' And, again, 'We delivered to Moses the Book, there- lore be not in doubt of his reception thereof, and we ordained it to be a guide unto the children of Israel. And we appointed 1 Antistes, Pocock's Latin rendering of Imam, is a very near approacli to the Arabic etymology of the word.374 appendix a. some of them to be Imams to direct the people according to our command.' 1 It is not clear whether Muhammad himself adopted or received the title ; but he never omitted performing the ordinary functions of an Imam until his last illness, when, finding himself unable to leave his house, which communicated with the mosque, he directed that Abu-Bekr should be sent for to lead the prayers of the people. It is certain, however, that the title was assumed by his immediate Successors, who regarded the duty associated with it of leading in public worship as their special prerogative, and as involving their supremacy ' in all matters of religion and of the world.' It is recorded of the Khalifah el -Mainuin (a. h. 198- 218= A.d. 813-833), that on entering the mosque at Baghdad one day, and finding a private individual conducting the prayers, he regarded the act as one of high treason. ' The Muhammadans,' writes D'Herbelot, ' are not agreed among themselves respecting the Imamate, that is, the dignit} of Imam. Some regard it to be of divine right and restricted to a single family, like the Aaronic pontificate ; others, whilst ad mitting it to be of divine right, nevertheless, do not believe it to be so limited to one family that it may not pass over to another. Moreover, according to these latter, the Imam must not only be exempt from great sins, such as infidelity, but also from lessei sins; he may be deposed, if he fall into such, and his dignity transferred to another.' 2 To these may be added the opinions of the sects called en-Nujddt, who held it to be ' unnecessary that the people should have an Imam at all ; but it behoves them to settle all questions equitably amongst themselves, and if they are unable to do so without the cooperation of an Imam, then they are at liberty to appoint one.' ,s The first serious dispute respecting the Imamate originated with the twelve thousand men who revolted from the Khalifah 'Aly-ibn-Abi-Talib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, after 1 Sti-rat-el Bdkarah, (ii.) 118.

' They affirmed that a man might be promoted to the dignity of Imam, or prince, though he was not of the tribe of Kuraish, nor even a freeman, provided he was a just and pious person, and endued with the other requisite qualifications. They also held, that if the Imam turned aside from the truth he might be put to death or deposed; and that there was no absolute necessity for any Imam at all in the world.' 2 Khawarij has since become a generic designation for a number of sects, which, though differing among themselves on other points, agree in the main with these notions touching the Imamate. Opposed to the Khawarij are the SMa'alis, or Separatists, a term specially applied to the adherents of 'Aly, whom the former re pudiated. ' They maintain him to be the lawful Khalifah and Imam, and that the supreme authority, both in spirituals and temporals, of right belongs to his descendants, notwithstanding they may be deprived of it by the injustice of others, or their own fear. They also teach that the office of Imam is not a common thing depending on the will of the vulgar, so that they may set up whom they please; but a fundamental affair of religion, and an article which the Prophet could not have neglected, or left to the fancy of the common people.' 3 In accordance with these doctrines the Shia'ahs claim the right of succession to the Imamate for 'Aly and his male descendants. Some recognize seven, and others twelve, as alone being entitled to that dignity. The last, who is surnamed el-Mahdij, or the Guide, they believe to be still alive, and that he will re-appear with the prophet Elijah at the second coming of Christ. 1 Literally, Outsiders, as being beyond the pale; like St. Paul 's rovs «£a&gt;, 1 Cor. v. 13. 2 Preliminary Discourse to Sale's Kuran, p. 231. 3 Id., pp. 232-3.H 376 appendix a. The original Khawarij were defeated by 'Aly, and cut off, as some writers affirm, even to a man ; others say that nine escaped, of whom two fled into Kerman, two into Sejistan, two into Meso potamia, one to Tell-Manrun, and the remaining two into 'Oman, where they propagated their heresy. This took place about a.h. 38= a. d . 658. Daring the reign of the Khalifah Marwan, the last of the Omeyyah dynasty, ( a.h . 127-132= a.d . 744-749), the head of the sect in 'Oman was one 'Abdallah-bin-Ibadh, et- Temimy, whose followers are still called, after him, Ihddhiyah, and our author expressly states (p. 7) that his doctrines were secretly countenanced by the native governor appointed by Abu-'1-'Abbas, es-Saffah, Marwan's successor in the Khalifate; moreover, that the sect became so powerful shortly after that they took the government into their own hands, and elected Julanda-bm-lVIas ud, who was ' the first of the rightful Imams of 'Oman.' It is evident from these data that the Imamate of 'Oman owes its origin to the peculiar religious tenets of the Khawarij, as adopted by the Ibadhiyah. They disallowed the claims of the Baghdad Khalifahs, as well in civil as religious matters, and set up one of their own, whom they invested with corresponding powers in both capacities. They acted upon the same principles by uni formly electing Imams for their personal merits or popularity, irrespective of family descent, for the space of nearly nine hundred years, reckoning from Julanda to the accession of Nasir-bin-Murshid, of the el-Ya'arubah, a.d . 1624; and if the nominees during that period were mainly confined to the el- Azd, it was because that was the predominant tribe, and possessed greater influence in the elections. After the supremacy had fallen into the hands of the el-Ya'arubah, and throughout the century during which they held it, these principles underwent a modification. Like their predecessors—and not unlike what took place in the kingdoms of the Western and Eastern Franks—the 'Omanis started from the same point: the Imam was elected, but with a strong preference to the ruling family over strangers, and with a strong preference to the son, not necessarily the eldest, of the last Imam over other members of his family. 1 &gt; A similar change had taken i)lace in the order of the succession toAPPENDIX A. 377 This deviation from their first principles is remarkably illus trated by the case of Seif-bin-Sultan, the sixth of the el-Ya'arubah Imams, (pp. 99-101). He was elected in preference to an elder brother, but, being still underage, his cousin Ya'arub-bin-BeFarab was appointed regent to carry on the administration; neverthe less, ' he did not lay claim to the Imamate, for that belonged of right to his cousin,'—an opinion utterly at variance with the rule which had previously prevailed in 'Oman regarding the succession. The el-Ya'arubah were succeeded by Ahmed-bin-Sa'id, the first of a new dynasty, which still bears rule in the country. Very little is said of Ahmed's pedigree : he was of the el-Azd tribe, and appears to have been engaged in mercantile pursuits before his appointment to the governorship of Sohar by Seif-bin- Sultan, of the el-Ya arubah. His patriotism and bravery in ex pelling the Persians secured for him the suffrages of the people, and he was elected Imam. During his administration his sons obtained the title of Seyyid, or Lord, and his daughters that of Seyyidah, or Lady, which their descendants have retained ever since. The title, so applied, was an innovation ; it tended, more over, to distinguish the ruling family, and to give them a corpo rate dignity and preeminence over all other native chiefs and grandees. The 'House of the Seyyids,' like the reigning Houses ' of Europe, has become a recognized dynasty, having the first claim to the succession; but the gradual increase in the number of rival and aspiring Seyyids has been one fertile source of the intestine feuds which have arrested the prosperity of the country for the last century. On the death of Ahmed, leaving seven sons and three daugh ters, the chiefs of 'Oman wished to elect Hilal, ' as being the eldest and the wisest,' but he was incapacited, owing to a cata ract in the eye, which obliged him to go to Guzerat for surgical advice, where he died. Sa'id-bin-Ahmed, the second son, was consequently raised to the Imamate, but his rule becoming un- tbe Khalifate within half a century after the death of Muhammad. Up to the reign of Mo'awiyah, the first of the Bonu-Omeyyah dynasty, the Khaltfahs were professedly elected by the body of the faithful, but Mo'awiyah succeeded in making it hereditary in his own family.^ M'!!

All these attempts, however, were frustrated by the Imam s eldest son, Hamed, who, by a course of the most consummate fraud and treachery, first succeeded in making himself master of Maskat, and then persuaded his father into resigning the administration to him. Helmed was opposed during his regency by his uncle Seif, Ah med's fourth son, until the death of the latter; afterwards, and more or less until he succumbed to an attack of small-pox, by Sultan, Ahmed's fifth son. Thereupon the Imam Sa'id, who had been living in retirement at er-Rastak, reasserted his autho rity by appointing his younger son Ahmed to the governorship of Maskat, and his nephew 'Aly, the son of his eldest brother who died in Guzerat, to Barkah. That arrangement, however, was speedily upset by Sultan, who by perfidy and violence ejected his nephews, and forthwith assumed the regency, with the con currence of the majority of the people, but in opposition to the wishes of his brother, the Imam. On the death of Sultan, who was killed by pirates in the Persian Gulf, his two sons, Salim and Sa'id, agreed to rule conjointly, although the former, cliiclly through the influence of their grandmother, consented that his younger brother should be nominally the regent. Sa id, who was already in possession of M^skat, lost no time in summoning such of the chiefs as were likely to espouse his cause, and having received, or purchased, their promised allegiance, he did not scruple to set his uncle the Imam's authority at defiance, aud by a bold coup d'etat forestalled all competitors to the regency. This occurred about a.d . 1804. It is noteworthy that since Sa'id, the son of the Imam Ahmed, the first of the Al -Bu-Sa'id dynasty, the rulers of 'Oman have never taken the title of ' Imam,' and are uniformly designated ' Seyyids.' 1 Up to the death of Sa'id this fact is easily to be ac- 1 On this subject Mr. Palgrave remarks, ' that the title of ' Imam ot Mascat' is unused in 'Oman itself, and belongs to European, not to Arab nomenclature. Thoweynee [the Seyyid Sa'id's son'] is not an Imam in the proper and Mahometan sense of the term, and Mascat is not his capital. The word ' Imam' does indeed in a general way denote any one who takes the precedence, especially in war or prayer, sometimes also inappendix a. 379 counted for, inasmuch as the recognition of two contemporaneous Imams would have been as inconsistent with the politico-reli gious s} stem ol the Ibadhijah as the recognition of two co existent Popes by the Church of Rome. Hence, while Sa'id lived undeposed, those who either with or without his sanction attained to the supreme authority in civil and political matters were debarred from assuming that dignity.' Canonically, those who invaded any of the prerogatives of the Imamate were usurpers ; but the law having become powerless against the will of the people, or even against a rival backed by a predominant party, there resulted a compromise which left the Imam in un disturbed possession of the title, together with its religious pre science and literature. In Nejed, Feysul is sometimes, but very rarely, denominated Imam by his subjects, and I have heard the same word applied twice or thrice to his heir 'Abd-Allah. But even in Nejed, ' Sul tan' is in far more common use; while in 'Oman Thoweynee invariably enjoys that distinguished title. Hence his correct address is ' Sultanu- Aaman,' i.e. 'Sultan of'Oman.' For official capital he has his choice between Bahilah, Sohar, and Nezwah; the latter is the most usual.' Travels in Cent, and East. Arabia, vol. ii. p. 285. There are several erroneous statements in the foregoing extract. In the first place, this History suffices to prove that Imdm was a title used by the'Omanis 'in the proper and Mahometan sense of the word;' not, indeed, ImO.m of Mdslcat, but Imam of'Oman. Thuwainy, it is true, like his father before him and his grandfather Sultan, was not Imam, as I have just stated above; but neither was he nor any of his predecessors styled Sultdn, for although the name is common enough in the country it has never been used as a title by the ruling sovereigns. Formerly they were Imams, now they are simply Seyyids, whatever foreigners may elect to call them. As the English first entered into political relations with 'Oman during the regency of Sultan-bin-Ahmed,—Sultan is here a proper name,—whose representative appears to have dubbed him Imam, taking it for granted that the regent was acting with the authority of his brother the Imam Sa'id, it became a custom with our officials to de signate his successors by the same title. Again, Sohar was never the capital, by which I mean the official residence, of the reigning sove reigns. Nezwa was so for a long and Behla for a short period in former ages, but for a century and a half subsequently, the recognized capital was er-Kastak, and it continued to hold that position till about a.d. 1779 when the Seyyid Hamed was appointed regent and established himself at Maskat, his father the Imam Sa'id continuing to reside at er -Kastak until he died, between A.n. 1811-1821.1 Is H 'i; f--. \ •' 'lil | ; » i if 380 APPENDIX A. eminence, and tacitly confirmed in the civil administration the candidate who, by any means, fair or foul, succeeded in seizing and retaining it. The upshot, in fact, may be described as a separation between Church and State, although in this case the State retained most of the prerogatives, religious as well as civil, which had formerly been exercised by the Church, But as the Imam Sa'id died during the regency of his nephew the Seyyid Sa'id, (between 1811-1821), the question arises why the latter did not subsequently lay claim to the title, and why it has been in abeyance ever since. The people at M&lt;iskat and Zanzibar, whom I consulted on this point, seemed unable to ac count for it; the following are my own conjectures on the sub ject : —The claim must have been submitted to a fresh adjudica tion ; for although, like his father, the Seyyid Sa'id, after seizing the regency, obtained a number of votes sufficient, in his own estimation, to authorize his retention of that office, the Ibadhiyah theory required that the people of'Oman generally should have a voice in conferring the Imamate. But with all the Seyyid s popularity on the coast and his fame abroad, it is by no means unlikely that a majority of the more fanatical inland tribes— several of which had become deeply imbued with Wahhabeeism —would have voted against his promotion to that dignity. Another drawback was, that his frequent absence at Zanzibar, where he mainly resided after the death of his uncle, prevented him from discharging one of the principal functions of Imam— that of leading in the public prayers of the 'Omanis. Moreover, political considerations led him to prefer Maskat to er-Rastak as a place of residence, whenever he visited the mother-country ; but the mosque at er-Rastak had been the cathedral of the Imams for ages, and perhaps it had come to be regarded as indispensable that their successors should be installed and should officiate there. The Seyyid Sa'id's well known liberal sentiments on matters of religion and indifference ,to its precepts have been alleged as one reason why the title of Imam was not conferred upon him; but, judging from the biography of his predecessors, theological attainments and personal piety were not regardedAPPENDIX A. 381 praciically as necessary qualifications for the office. 1 Possibl}-, also, the derangement in the popular belief of the 'Omanis, caused by the attempts first made by the Wahhabis during the reign of Sultan, the Seyyid Sa'id's father and predecessor, to proselyte them to their creed, had some influence in shaking the founda tion of their politico-religious system, and led to the abandon ment of the antagonistic attitude involved in their retention of an Imamate. Thus much is certain, that whether from convic tion or prudential considerations—most probably the latter— the Ibadhiyah of 'Oman have made great concessions in matters of religion to the fanaticism of their powerful and dangerous neighbours, the Wahhabis. Lastly, in addition to these consi derations, it should be borne in mind that, according to the peculiar doctrines of the Ibadhiyah of 'Oman, it is not absolutely necessary that there should be an Imamate. Passing on from this review of the order of succession and the changes which it has undergone,—merely observing, by the way, that no new feature has been introduced into it since the death of the Seyyid Sa'id-bin-Sullan,—I shall proceed to inquire 1 ' In order to attain the title of Imdm,' writes Wellated, 'it is ne cessary at the period of his election that he should possess sufficient theological attainments to preach before the assembled chiefs, by whom he is chosen, and their followers; and also that he should not embark on board ships. The latter,—as in the case of Saaf, [Seif-bin-Sultan], who took possession of the ports on the African coast and then- dependencies, is, after installation, overlooked; but the former they consider so indis pensably binding that Sayyid Sa'id, who either does not possess the necessary attainments or fancies so, has dispensed with the ceremony altogether, and, in consequence, receives from his subjects the title of Sayyid, or prince, only.' Travels in Arabia, vol. i. p. 9. The remarks to which this quotation is appended as a foot-note serve to rectify Wellsted's statements on the same subject; he is, moreover, mistaken in supposing preaching to be one of the Imam's functions. With regard to the assertion that going to sea, either before or after installation, was a disqualification for the office, all I can say is that the 'Omanis whom I consulted never broached such an idea; that it is in consistent with their predilections as a maritime people; that not the least trace of it appears in this History; and, further, that it is incorrect in fact, since several of the Imams visited the coasts of'Oman by sea, as well before as after their installation, and some of the el-Ya'arubah, and notably Ahmed-bin-Sa'id of the Al-Bu-Sa'id dynasty, unquestionably navigated the Persian Gulf after their installation.| 1 'j'7. , •&gt;! &gt; 'i ' l w- 'i yl'i' ■ !U 382 appendix a. into the special prerogatives and functions of the Imams of 'Oman, prefacing the inquiry with a few words touching the mode of election. Election, as we have seen, was a fundamental principle with the Ibadhiyah, but it was not carried out by a jolehiscctum. 1 he people undoubtedly had a voice in it, but it was through their chiefs, who assembled in solemn conclave under the presidency of one of their number, whose personal character or abilities in general estimation raised him to that preeminence, to discuss the merits of competing candidates. The elections usually took place at the capital for the time being, and the resident Ivadhi and grandees exercised a predominant influence in the council. What particular chiefs were privileged to join in the debates and to vote does not appear, except that, as a rule, most or all ot them belonged to 'Oman proper ; but the occasion usually drew a large concourse of people to the metropolis, who awaited in the vicinity of the chamber the result of its deliberations, ihe can didate duly elected received first the recognition of the electors, after which the president went forth and proclaimed him Imam in the presence of the assembled crowds, who thereupon ten dered him their allegiance, probably by acclamation, no specitic form being mentioned in connection with the ceremony. The foregoing account of an election to the Imamate is com piled mainly from a detailed description of the election aiul in stallation of Rashid-bin-el-Wahd to that oflice, (see p. 31,) about a.d. 940. The details are omitted in the narrative of all the sub sequent elections recorded, which in course of time appear to have been conducted with much less ceremony, especially after the range of eligibility to the Imamate had been contracted from that of the nation at large to the members of one family, as in the case of the el-Ya'arubah and the Al-Bu-Sa'id dynasties. The people collectively, however, did not always approve of the Council's nominee, and the dissentients, when powerful enough, refused to recognize his authority, and not nnfrequently set up an Imam of their own. Many of the intestine feuds of 'Oman arose out of a conflict of opinion among the tribes regarding the legitimacy of the elections. &lt;. The first duty of the newly-elected Imam was to lead in theappendix a. 383 public prayers of the mosque. This was done on Friday, the Muslims day of solemn assembly, and repeated every succeeding I* riday during his Imamate. If several days intervened between his election and Friday, he proceeded at once to exercise the other prerogatives of sovereignty. He either confirmed in their appointments the district-collectors, governors of towns and commandants of the forts throughout the country, or replaced them by nominees of his own. 1 The Collectors received on his behalf the Sadalcdt and Zaldt, (see notes, pp. 31, 28, 124), and other proceeds to which his twofold office entitled him. These latter consisted of charitable bequests and pious endowments, derelict property, property to which there was no legal heir, and the rental from land or houses which had fallen to the State from those sources, and which together formed the Beit-el-Mdl, or Treasury, (see note, p. 46). This was at the Imam's absolute disposal, theoretically for carrying on 'holy wars' and for the defence of Islam, which included the maintenance of the forts, garrisons, and shipping; also for building mosques and the sup port of the poor. He also received the custom-dues at the dif ferent ports of the province, 2 which are levied on imports only, —an income of comparatively recent growth, for it was not until after the expulsion of the Portuguese, about a.d. 1G51, that the 'Omanis exercised any jurisdiction over the coast. It is useless to speculate how this additional revenue would have been dis posed of under the old system, which has gone into desuetude, and now the receipts from all sources are practically amalga mated, and the gross amount applied, at the will of the sove reign, to the general purposes of the administration, including the civil list and the support of the ruling family, most of the members of which, however, have towns or districts assigned to them in appanage, besides having private resources of their own. 3 1 The forts, fortresses, and castles are regarded as public property: they are subject to the authority and are garrisoned and maintained by the Imam. The Hujrahs (see note, p. 20) belong to the tribe or people where they are located. Over these the Imam has no control. 2 The rulers of 'Oman of late years have generally farmed these dues. They are mostly bought by Banians. 3 This custom, which dates from the period when eligibility to theB PI - 'il I 1 4 vi i&lt; 1 ^ ; IU S ;■ |»| i .-; ' i /|i t;... i ; 381 APPENDIX A. In this respect the position of the later rulers of'Oman is far more independent than it was in former times, when some of them at least appear to have received, or to have been satisfied with, a very limited allowance for personal expenditure from ilic Beit-el-Mal, barely sufficient to provide them with the necessaries of life, (see pp. 76, 77). As regards the administration of justice, all ordinary suits were left to the Kadhi, or Judge, who decided them according to the institutes of the Koran ; more important cases were sub mitted to a council, under the presidency of the Kadhi, but their decision was subject to be annulled or modified by that of the Imam, ' who took the precedence over all the nobles in the ad ministration of the affairs of'Oman,' (p. 49), and whose decree was final. These processes, however, were confined to the prin cipal towns, for the Imam's authority was, and that of the ruling Seyyid still is, barely nominal in other parts of the province and among the tribes, each tribe acting ordinarily as a civ il commu nity, the smaller being in a great measure under the intluence of the greater. Theoretically, the chiefs are responsible to the Imam for the good government of their respective districts ; practically, they are independent of him, and settle all matters of dispute among themselves according to their own tribal laws and customs, the Imam seldom interfering with them, unless for acts of rebellion and for refusing to supply their quota of men, in cases of emergency, for the defence of the State or in support of his authority. Apart from his strictly religious functions which, as we have seen, were mainly confined to leading in the prayers of the mosque once a week, and to the superintendence of pious enter prises and endowments, the Imam in his capacity of Prince held much the same position as the sovereign in the old feudal system of Europe; the chief represents the barons, and the people, re leased from taxation, hold possession of the soil on the same tenure as the ancient vassal, namely, military service. Imamate and regency became practically restricted to the members of the ruling family, has had the most pernicious effect on the welfare of the principality. Seyyids who have had such appanages assigned to them have, as a rule, assumed sovereign rights and set the central authority at defiance.APPENDIX. (B.) the ibadhiyah. To avoid needless repetition, I refer the reader to Appendix A for an account of the Khawdrij, of which sect the Ibddhiyah are an offshoot. The derivation of the name from 'Abdallah-bin- Tbadh, et-Temimy, 1 who lived during the reign of the Khalifah Marwan, a .n. 127-132= a.d . 744-749, is affirmed by the following authorities:— Under the heading of Omdn, /^ak^rya-bin-Muhammad-biu- Mahrnud, generally quoted as ' el-Kazwiny,' writes :—' The Khawarij Ibadhiyah prevail in that country up to our time, [13th century ?], and the members of no other sect are to be found there, except such as are foreigners.

They were dispersed over the north-east of Nejd, from the Syrian desert to the borders of el-YamAmah. Their territory comprised the vast desert called Dahnd, and extended on the south between the confines of el-Yamamah and el-Bahrein. Several important tribes claim to be the issue of Temtin, among which is the Benu-Mukais, subdivided into the Benu-Minsar and the Benu-Sarih. From the latter sprang 'Abdallah-bin-Ibadh, the chief of the heretical Muslims styled Ibddhiyah, and also 'Abdallah-bin-Suffar, the head of the es-Sufriyyah sect.

The Khawarij origin of the Ibadhiyah and the derivation of their distinctive title from 'Abdallah-bin -Ibadh are clearly set forth in these quotations. Before entering into further details respecting the peculiar doctrines of these sectaries, T shall adduce three or four extracts from the writings of the very few European authors who have noticed them :— The judicious Niebuhr, whose narrative is a marvel of research, considering that it was written upwards of a century ago, says : ' The inhabitants of 'Oman profess to belong to a sect called Abddi or Bojasi, long well known to Arabian authors, but not hitherto mentioned, to my knowledge, by any European tra veller. The Sunnites as well as the Shiites call them Ghauci- redsji, but this is a soubriquet, as odious in 'Oman as the name of Itafecli to the Persians, and that of Ketzer (Heretics) to the Germans. Abulfarage speaks of these Chauaredsji, and I have no doubt they are the same that Sale and others style Kharejites. Their principles, some of which I have quoted in my Description de VArabic, pp. 18, 19, agree very much with those to whom others have given the name of Kharejifcs, namely, they do not 1 The assassination of the Khalifah 'Aly-ibn-Abi-Talib, Mubaramad's cousin and son-in-law, and the motives which actuated it, had such an important bearing on the subsequent developments of Islam, that an exhaustive paper on the subject, compiled from original sources—some of them but little known in Europe—and transmitted to me from Cairo by Mr. Frederick Ayrtnn, will, I am sure, be duly appreciated.

It is quite clear, moreover, that neither AV ellsted nor Niebuhr had any definite idea of the peculiar doctrines of the Ibadhiyah Khawarij. Mr. Francis Warden, Member of Council at Bombay, in his ]3t wj Notes relotive to the Proviuco of'Om&amp;n, gives the following extraordinary account of the sect' AH, the son-in-law of the 11ophet, led a lorce into Oman from \emen, and, having esta blished intercourse with the Nejd tribes, returned.

The distinguished author shall speak for himself: — ' One event alone, a memorable epoch in the history of Islam, one storm that lashed them all into fury, rippled the still surface of'Oman and diversified its annals. The inhabitants of Djebel- Akhdar and the Batinah were not wholly estranged from the neighbouring regions of Hasa, and the outbreak of the Batinee- yah or secret sects so widely diffused through the latter pro vince, had its origin mainly in 'Oman, a land long before schooled by the teaching of the Katai'ee and his fellows. Hence, when the Carmathian movement convulsed Arabia, 'Oman was not wholly exempt from the vicissitudes which deluged the Penin sula with blood, and her mountains supplied a large contingent to the troops of the Djenabee and Aboo-Tahir. When the Car- mathians were in their turn subdued, 'Oman had all to fear from the vengeance of the victorious party, a vengeance that they only escaped through the strength of their territorial position. An expedition was directed against them by one of the Abbaside caliphs (which, I could not learn), and laid waste the villages of Katar and the province of Sharjah up to Djebel-'Okdah, beyond which the invaders were unable to penetrate. ' These new hostilities on the part of Islam suggested to the sectarian 'Omanees the expediency of new measures, and above all of a distinctive badge which might serve as a rallying signal in war and danger. To this end, like the kindred tribe of the Druses in the far-off west, the men of 'Oman assumed the white turban for their especial token, and from it acquired the name of ' Abadceyah' or ' Biadeeyah,' that is, ' White Boys'—to give the woid a corresponding Irish translation—in contradistinction to the green of the Fatimites and the black of the Abbasides. The title of Biadeeyah, first peculiar to the Carmathians alone, soon became common to the entire population of 'Oman, and has re mained theirs up to the present day.' Again : ' With the relics of Sabsean practice, and a groundwork of Carmathian free- thinking, the Biadeeyah, like the Druses, Ismaileeyah, Ansey- reeyah, and other similar sects, mix certain modifications derived from Mahometan law, and sufficient for a disguise when neces sary, or at least for a species of apology in presence of Muslims.' And, again : ' The Biadeeyah, a compound of Saba^ans, Bati- neeyah, and Carmathians, inheritors of Mokannaa' and Aboo- Tahir, will at times pass themselves oft' on a stranger for toler ably orthodox Mahometans.' 1 With all due respect for so distinguished an orientalist as Mr. Palgrave, I am constrained to point out that several of the state- 1 Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii. pp. 261, 262, 265.APPENDIX B. 389 ments contained in the foregoing extracts are based on miscon ception. It is tolerably clear, in the first place, that he identifies the Ibadhiyah with the Karamitah. That is an error; the for mer, as we have seen from the native authorities quoted at the commencement of this article, had a common origin with the Khawanj, who rose up in the reign of 'Aly, a.u. 35-40= a.d 655- 660, and became a distinct sect in 'Oman, under the leadership ol 'Abdallah bin-Ibadh, et-Temimy, during the Khalifate of Mar- wan. a h. 12M82= a.d. 744-749. The Karamitah, on the other hand, were unknown until upwards of a century later. 1 The respective creeds of the Karamitah and the Khawarij ditiered in toto : the latter were regarded as heretical chiefly for denying the doctrine of the Succession to the Imamate as held by their opponents the Sunnis and the Shia'ahs, and for their peculiar notions about sin ; the Karamitah (see note, p. 27) vir tually abrogated the precepts of the Kuran by turning them into allegory. 'Ihe real object of this sect,' writes Baron de Sacy, ' was to lead men to atheism and immorality, and to teach them to contemn even those first eternal principles of order and of justice which are engraven on the heart of man by the author of his being, and, still more, every idea of a revelation or of a Divine authority.' 2 Further, the Isma'iliyyah and the el-Bati- niyyah, with whom Mr. Palgrave also associates the Ibadhiyah, had nothing in common with the latter sect: they were, in fact, Karamitah, under different names. The learned author just quoted says : ' Karmates is not the primitive name of the sect so styled. The real name of these sectaries is Ismaelis or Ismaeliens. ihey had already existed for some time when they were called Karmates, a name under which they became subsequently famous. Perhaps the designation should only be regarded as indicating a particular branch of the Ismaelis.' 3 In like manner, the term 1 ' Cependant la secte des Schiis se repandait de plus en plus, jusqu'tk. ce que Ton vit naitre celle des Karmates dont I'auteur fut Hamdan, fils d'Aschath, surnomme A'arma^..!! commen^a a etre question des Kar mates en Tan [ a.h .] 264; ce fut dans le territoire de Basra que parut ce personage, et sa secte se repandit d'abord dans I'lrak.'

WM ' wm el-Bdtiniyyah was common to the Isma'iliyyah and the Karami- tah, designating them as having embraced the 'Ihn-el-Batvn, that is, the Science of the Interior Sense, as De Sacy renders the title. 1 Further, Mr. Palgrave was led to believe that the 'Omanis so far sympathized with the Karamitah of el-Bahrein under their original leaders Abu-Sa'id, el-Janaby, and his son Abu-Tahir, that they supplied large contingents to aid them in carrying on war against the Muslims. So far from this being the case, we have the testimony of Nowairy (see note, p. 27) to the effect that the expedition sent into 'Oman by the Karamitah under Abu- Sa'id was nearly exterminated by the people of the country ; and the curse invoked by the Ibadhiyah author of this History on Abu-Sa'id himself, and the religious horror with which he re counts some of the more prominent doctrines of the Karamitah, (p. 28), are sufficient to prove that the principles of the two sects were utterly antagonistic. Again, in enumerating the Ibadhiyah among the ' inheritors of Mokannaa',' Mr. Palgrave has fallen into an equally serious mistake. El-Mukanna' was the title given to a famous impostor named Hakim-bin-Hashim, a native of Meru in Khorassan, who had been under-secretary to Abu-Muslim, the governor of that province. He subsequently turned soldier, and passed over into Ma-wara-'n-Nahar, where he gave himself out to be a prophet. Having made many proselytes and seized several fortified places, he rebelled against the Abbaside Khalifah el-Mehdy (a.h. 158- 1G9=a.d. 775-785,) who dispatched an army against him. Rather than yield, he first poisoned all the members of his own family who were with him in the beleaguered castle and burnt their bodies, and then committed suicide by throwing himself into the flames, a.h. 162 or 163. He used to wear a veil to hide his face from his followers, and also a mask of gold with the same object, • Sale confirms what is here stated, quoting the best authorities on the subject:—' The Biitenites, which name is also given to the Ismaelians by some authors, and likewise to the Karmatiaus, were a sect which pro fessed the same abominable principles, and were dispersed over several parts of the East. The word signifies Esoterics, or People of inward or hidden light or knowledge.' Preliminary Discourse to the Kurdn, p. 247. ii iappendix b, 301 which obtained for him the cognomen of el-MuMnna\ sometimes that of el-Burlcdy, or the Veiled. His doctrine, according to D'Herbelot, was, that ' after God had commanded the angels to worship the first man, Adam, 1 He assumed a human form and figure; that afler Adam's death, He appeared in the form of several of the prophets and other personages elected by Him to that end, until He took that of Abu-Muslim, the prince of Kho- rassan, [el-Mukanna' 's former superior,] who believed in ei-Tand- suhhiyyah, or Metempsychosis ; and that after the death of that prince the Divinity passed from him and descended into his person.' 1 These peculiar tenets, I need scarcely say, are utterly repug nant to those professed by the Ibadhiyah, and there is not the least evidence to prove that they ever found their way in 'Oman. Mr. Palgrave was most probably led astray by the resemblance between the two names, el-MulayyidMn or el-Mubayyidhah and el-Tbadhiyah : the former means the Whites, the title given to the followers of el-Mukanna', who adopted white garments to distinguish themselves from the Musawwidah, or Blacks, who obeyed the Abbaside Khalifahs, whose chosen colour was black ; the latter, as I have already shown, is derived from the leader of the sect in Oman, 'Abdallah-bin-Ibadh, who flourished thirty years at least before el-Mukanna'. It is open to question, more over, whether the word Ihddh proceeds from the same root (bddha, to surpass in whiteness), as Mubayyidhun ; it more pro bably comes from dbadha or dhidha, to tie or strengthen the leg of a camel. Ibddh, a derivative noun from that root, means a nerve, or a certain vein in the hind leg of a horse. If any fur ther proof were required to rebut the notion of the Ibadhiyah being ' Whites,' or ' White Boys,' it is forthcoming in the fact that the Ibadhiyah of 'Oman do not afiect white garments. I shall now proceed to give some further account of the pecu liar religious tenets of the Ibadhiyah from an original source, for which I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Frederick Avrton.

' The Ibadhiyah derive their name from 'Abdallah-ibn-Ibadh. They state as their opinions :—' Our opponents, the Ahlu-l- Kihlah [i. e. Muslims] are unbelievers, but not polytheists ; mar riages with them are lawful ; and in time of war the taking of their property as booty is lawful, but not in the absence of war.' They also say : ' the country of our opponents, the people of Islam, is the coimtry of cs-Snldm [peace] to us, except the place in which are troops of their [the Muslim's] Snltan, which is then not the abode of es-Saldm [peace] but of violence.' They admit the evidence of their opponents [the Muslims] against their people. They hold that the sinner of a great sin 1 may be an attester of the Unity of God, but not a [true] believer, inasmuch as acts enter into faith. They also affirm that power precedes the act; that the act of a man is created of God ; that all the world will perish as will perish the people under the obligation of obedience [to God] ; that he who commits the great sin of denying God's grace is an unbeliever, but that, in denying the denomination of his sect, he is not an unbeliever. They are silent as to the state of infidelity of the children of infidels, and as to a hypocrite being [necessarily] a polytheist or not; also, as to the validity of the mission of an Apostle 3 without signs and miracles ; also, as to its being compulsory to follow what has been revealed to him or not. They account 'Aly (may God be gracious to him !) and most of the Companions [of Muham mad] as in infidelity. They are divided into four sects:— ' I. El-Ilafsiyyah, derived from Abu-Hafs-bin-el-Mukdam, who 1 ' Great sins, such as murder, fornication, theft, wine-drinking, repu diation of parents, usury, perjury, violence, sodomy, bestiality, seducing married women into adultery, falsely accusing the 'Ulam&lt;\ [learned], slander, forgery, and robbing orphans of their property. Some ' Ulamd say that obstinacy in a little sin makes it a great sin, and if such great sin partakes of the turpitude of any of the foregoing, then it is a great sin ; if not, it is a little sin.' 2 ' An Apostle is a male of the human race whom God has inspired with a law which he is to practise and to make known to mankind.'50 APPENDIX B. 393 say that between faith and polytheism is a middle course, which is the knowledge of God, (may He be magnified and glorified !) and therefore that whoever knows God, and denies every other i.in Him, and yet commits one of the greater sins, is an infidel, though not a polytheist. ' ± El-Yezidlyyah, derived from Yezid-bin-Amsah, [the latter a female name ] who are deeper in infidelity and heresy than the [original] Ibadhiyah These say that God, (may He be glorified!) will send a Prophet from a foreign country with a Book, and that Book is written in heaven, and will descend upon him fthe I rophet] at a single time [&gt;. e. not in chapters,] and that he will discard the law of Muhammad, (may God grant him mercy and salvation !) and incline to the religion of the Sabseans 2 mentioned in the Kuran. ' 3. El-Hdrithiyyah derived from el-Hareth, el-Ibadhy. Thev are at vanance with the original Ibadhiyah on predestination, that is to say, m that the deeds of men are created of God and that power to do precedes the doing. 4. 1 hese are they who hold by an obedience which God has not ordained, that is to say, they affirm that should a man do what is commanded of him, and not intend it to [the honour of] God yet that this is [true] obedience. Hence, according to them. In tention is not a condition of true piety. But this doctrine is opposed to the Book [the Kuran,] the Sunnah* [the authorized Iraditions], and the consent of the Imams, for God said of old m His word, ' And they were commanded no other than to wor ship God, exhibiting towards Him the true Din* religion! bome commentators understand the word Din to mean Intention. Moreover, the Prophet says that ' works depend on intention 5 and the four Imams 6 concur in this, that the merit of works depends on the intention. Intention signifies design, that is the design to do a thing. Now the works which depend [for their merit] on Intention, are the obligatory acts, such as prayer. 1 « A Piophet is on© whoni Grod has inspired with a law which he him self is bound to observe, and if, in addition thereto, he is commanded to make it known to mankind, he is a Prophet and also an Apostle.' - Palgrave mentions several peculiarities among the 'Omanis, especially in their nomenclature for some of the principal stars and planets, and also their repeated inquiries about the pyramids of Egypt, which he regards as relics of the old Sabaean religion.

The four Imams also agree that the act which does not partake of [such] intention, being merely a means to another, such as ablu tion is to prayer, that then it has no value, but is vain and vicious. And in proof that the worthiness of works depends on the intention, we have his [Muhammad's] words , ' works depend on intention,' 1 and ' To every one shall be meted out as he in tended,' 1 that is to say, the merit of works consists in the inten tion with which they are wrought. And again, ' the intention of the believer is better than his act.' 1 Therefore, the work wrought without intention is vain and corrupt, and without any merit 5 ; it has no standing-ground, not being based on intention. The Muslim who believes with a pure intention shall attain to immortality in heaven; the unbeliever, with his evil intention, shall be immortal in fire.' The doctrines of the Ibadhiyah, as far as they are to be gath ered from the Arabian authorities adduced in the foregoing dis sertation, differ from those of the orthodox Muslims on three cardinal points. 1st. On the Imamate, respecting which they deny the right of succession to be inherent in any particular family or class, holding, on the contrary, that it depends on the election of the people, and that there is no absolute necessity for any Imam at all. (Their denial of the Imamate to Othman and 'Aly and to their Successors in the Khalifate comes under this head.) 2ndly. Predestination and Free will. Although the Sunnites differ greatly among themselves on these dogmas, the opinion more generally entertained among them is, that man has power and will to choose good and evil, and can moreover know that he shall be rewarded if he do well, and be punished if he do ill; but that he depends, notwithstanding, on God's power, and willeth, if God will, but not otherwise. The Ibadhiyah, on the other hand, are charged with holding predestination in such a sense as to make God the author of evil as well as good. 3rdly. On the merit and demerit of human actions. According to the Muslim author last quoted, the Ibadhiyah are opposed to the orthodox in maintaining that a good intention is not necessary to 1 See note 5, p. 393.APPENDIX B. 395 render an act meritorious; that a man may deny the sect to wliicli he belongs without incurring the guilt of infidelity; but that the commission of one of the greater sins places him beyond the pale of salvation. 1 If any additional argument were needed to prove the antiquity of the Ibadhiyah as a sect, these doctrines of theirs amply supply the deficiency. Severally and in their ramifications they belong to the infancy of Islam,—the age of the Khawarij, the Kada- riyyah, the Mu'atazalah, the Sefatiyyah, and a long list of other Separatists, who arose within two centuries after the death of Muhammad, 2 when Greek and Persian philosophy had already begun to darken the comparatively simple teaching of the Kuran. Similar differences have agitated and divided the Church of Christ from a very early period, and do so still; and the reader can hardly fail to have recognized, in these points of divergence among Muslims, a strong likeness to the opposite views which Christian theologians entertain on apostolical succession, predes tination and election, justification and reprobation, faith and works, mortal and venial sins, the merit of congruity and con- dignity, and other cognate dogmas. And, as in Christendom, the great majority of each sect is led by a name rather than by an intelligent appreciation of the peculiar tenets taught by its leaders ; in like manner, it is very much to be questioned whe ther the generality of Muslim sectarians at the present day, the Ibadhiyah included, have any adequate conception of the differ ences which separate them from one another and from the great 1 The peculiar views of his sect on the heinousness of sin were evi dently present to the Ibadhiyah author of the document obtained by Lieut. Wellsted when he wrote the following passage, which is given entire in Wellsted's narrative ;—' We conclude such [all other Muslim sects] to be devoted to ruin; enemies of God; infidels, whose portion hereafter shall be in Gehenna for ever. They deny the eternity of future punishments, [to Muslims who have fallen into infidelity]; they dimi- nish the enormity of sin; we enhance it. Surely, the portion of the wicked will be for ever, for God is great.' Travels in Arabia, vol. i. p. 328. 2 The reader will find them enumeratad in Sale's Introduction to the Kuran, pp. 201-236.

Withregardto religious ordinances and ceremonial, the Ibadhiyah do not appear to differ in any important respect from the orthodox, except perhaps that their observance of them is characterized by a greater simplicity. Mr. Palgrave says that ' their 4 Mezars,' or buildings set apart for religious veneration, supply the de ficiency of' Mesjids,' or regular mosques, but they very rarely assemble for any stated form of worship ; their prayers are uttered in a low and inaudible voice, accompanied by inflections and prostrations different from those employed in Mahometan devotion. 1 ' I am satisfied that this is a mistaken judgment, based upon a very limited acquaintance with the habits of the people generally, and derived from the author's experience of M^skat alone, a seaport where a large proportion of the popula tion consists of foreigners, and, like seaports in other parts of the world, not much given to religion. 2 The reader will have re marked how frequently mention is incidentally made in this History of the Friday services ; of the observance of the stated times of prayer, with their accompanying ablutions and postures ; of the duty of alms-giving, the Hijj, and the devout reading of the Kuran. Mosques {Jdma') exist in most of the principal towns, and Mdsjids (Oratories or Places of Worship) in localities of lesser note. The word Mazdr (literally, a Place of Visitation) occurs only two or three times throughout this narrative, and is properly applied to the building over a tomb ; but not the least hint is given that these shrines are used for a purpose different to that which prevails in other Muslim countries, where they are occasionally visited either with the view of paying honour to the deceased, or for the sake of urging some special petition through their intercession ; certainly, they are not used in 'Oman as places for congregational worship. 1 Central and Eastern Arabia, vol. ii. p. 262-3. 2 In another place Mr. Palgrave says of Maskat : ' Religion is here of all kinds and denominations; but the golden calf counts, I think, more sincere worshippers at Mascat than any other divinity soever.' Ibid., p. 366.APPENDIX B. 397 Mr. Palgrave animadverts on Niebuhr's statement that ' the Ibadhiyah do not smoke and do not drink coffee, much less strong liquors, and distinguished personages do not dress more richly than those of a lower rank, except that they wear a turban more or less costly.' The critic surmises that the author mis took some Wahhaby strangers at Maskat for the people of the country. My impression is that Niebuhr drew his conclusions fiom the habits of the court—if that term may be applied to the regent at the time and to the Seyyids of his family. Whether from religious scruples or through a prudential deference to the &lt;li caded W ahhabis I cannot say, but I know from familiar per sonal experience with the late Seyyid Thuwainy, the Seyyid Majid at Zanzibar, and several of their brothers and near rela tives, that none of them smoked or drank coffee. Coffee, in deed, is regarded as a lawful beverage by the Ibadhiyah, and is therefore in uni\ersal use among the people. It is notorious, moico\ er, that many of that sect at Maskat and in other parts of the country indulge in wine and spirituous liquors, but they do so, as do many Turks and other Muslims, in direct violation of the laws which they profess to regard as sacred. It is also true that tobacco is largely used at most of the seaports of 'Oman, but it is remarkable that Wellsted never once mentions it in his lists of the products of the country, or as being used by the in habitants of the interior, although he gives several detailed accounts of their convivialities, and mentions particularly that in the Jebel-Akhdar 'large quantities of wine are made, of which the inhabitants at their meals partake most freely and openly ; and at all the principal towns where sugar is manufactured, they distil from its refuse an indifferent rum, which in the country finds a ready sale.' 1 I am therefore inclined to question the correctness of Mr. Palgrave's remark that ' tobacco is a staple article of the country, both for use and exportation,' or that its use is so universal among the people as his words seem to imply. I do not imagine that smoking is forbidden by the tenets of the Ibadhiyah, but my impression is that the gradual prevalence of , Wahhaby austerity and influence over a large portion of the in- 1 Travels in Arabia, vol. i. p. 344.398 APPENDIX B. terior, especially the district of ezh-Zlxahirah, has led to its being regarded in the light of a questionable indulgence even by their Ibadhiyah neighbours. In point of morals, I am persuaded that the Ibadhiyah are on a par with Muslims generally. If they are less moral, as some writers seem to hold, it cannot fairly be attributed to their peculiar tenets, which, if anything, inculcate greater se%erity of conduct under more awful sanctions. Hie reproach about the indifference of husbands and wives to the conjugal tie, which Ibn-Batuta charged them with four centuries ago, has been re peated in modern times, but Ibn-Uatuta as an orthodox Muslim was hardly an impartial judge of the heretical Khawarij, and scarcely any European has had any experience of the country beyond the sea-coast, with the exception oi Wellsted, whose free- spoken narrative contains nothing which can lead the reader to believe that the inhabitants, male and female, were conspicuous for laxity of conduct either in social intercourse among them selves or towards strangers. On the whole, the Ibadhiyah, as regards faith and practice, seem to me to hold a position towards Islam orthodoxy not unlike that of the Nonconformist Calvinistic bodies in this coun try towards the community of the Established Church. In their religious toleration of all other sects, which, as Wellsted justly remarks, 'forms one of the most prominent features of the government,' they are—to use an Arabic phrase—a conspicuous example to those who possess discernment.APPENDIX.

Temim, in Arabic, signifies strong. The Benu-Temim dwelt in Nejd and in the paits between el-Basrah and el-K(ifah. They were afterwards dispersed among the towns. 4 Nahruwdn, so vocalized by Abulfeda. It is not easy to fix the site of the town or particular district of this name near which 'Aly discomfited his opponents, the Khawdrij, a.h . 38= a.d . 658-9. In some maps there is a Nahruwan placed twelve miles east of the Tigris, about the same num ber of miles before it joins the Euphrates at el-Ktirnah, D'Herbelot also mentions a Nahruwan between Baghdad and Vasseth (Wasit), four leagues east of the Tigris,—Wasit itself being so-called from its position, midway between el-Kufah and el-Basrah. But in the map of Arabia, compiled by Walker, 1849, 'Wasafis placed in 46° 8' E., 32° 1'N., on the Shatt-el-Hai, {Hdyyah, from its crookedness), which flows from the Tigris considerably below Baghdad into the Euphrates, a position which leaves W asit only a little to the north of a straight line drawn from el- Kufah (Mash-had-'Aly) to el-Basrah, though to reach this Wasit from el- Kufah the Euphrates would have to be crossed, and the same again to reach el-Basrah from Wasit. This Nahruwan, however, cannot Ibe theb ■' 400 APPENDIX C. heresy we should give repose to the people.' (From the History by Ibn-el-Wardy, vol. i, p. 133, Cairo, A.H. 1285). According to Zubair-ibn-Bakkar, the survivors of the Khawarij agreed together to kill 'Aly, Mo'awiyah, and 'Omar-bin-el-'As. 1 According to Muhammad-ibn-Sa'ad, three men of the Khawarij, namely, 'Abd- allah-er-Rahman-ibn-Muljam, el-Murady, who was descended from Himyar, but accounted of the Benu-Murad, and affiliated to the Benu-Jabalah, (descended) from Kindah, 2 el-Barak-ibn-'Abd- allah, et-Temimy, and 'Omar-ibn-Bekr, et-Temimy, having con ferred together, met at Mekkah, and agreed together, and bound themselves to kill these three, namely, 'Aly-ibn-Abi-Talib, (may God ennoble his countenance !) Mo'awiyah, and 'Omar-ibn-el-'As, and thereby rid the people of them. That thereupon Muljam said, ' I am with you for 'Aly;' el-B^rak, 'I am for you as regards Mo'awiyah;' and 'Omar-ibn-Bekr, '1 will satisfy you as respects 'Omar-ibn-el-'As.' Moreover, they settled and covenanted that one in question, connected with the history of 'Aly, because it was only built by el-Hajjaj, the governor of 'Irak, for'Abd-el-Malik, fifth Khalifah of the Benu-Omeyyah, a.h . 83 or 84, i.e. 45 or 46 years after the battle of Nahruwan, which, as already mentioned, occurred a.h . 38. The KamUs merely says that there were three Nahruwans, the Higher, Middle, and Lower, all situate between Baghdad—which, by the way, was not built till the second Khalifate of the Abbasides, a.h . 140—and Wasit. The Nahruwan from which the battle took its name was possibly near the ancient Canal, so-called, to the east of the site of Baghdad. Capt. Felix Jones, in his excellent memoir of this canal, in vol. xliii of the New Series of the Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government (Bombay, 1857) in the map of the canal which accompanies the memoir, places a large ruin, which he names ' Sifweh,' and supposes it to be ' the Nah ruwan of the Arab MSS.'—a somewhat vague expression—ten miles east and six north of Baghdad, close to the northern extremity of the old canal.

' Muayyid, the lord of el-Hamah, relates in his History that he was called Kindah because he denied his father; that is to say, the benefits which he had received from him. The town called Kindah, in Yemen, was named after him. Kindah was the son of 'Amilah, who was of the descendants of Kahtan, descended from Saba, descended from Yash-hub, the son of Ya'arub.'

The day agreed upon was the 17th of Ramadhan of the year 40. 1 Then each departed for the town where his friend re sided : 'Abd-er-Rahman-ibn-Muljam set off for and reached el- Kufah, intending to kill 'Aly, (may God ennoble his countenance!), for which purpose he bought a sword and poisoned it. At the same time he used to go and ask 'Aly for whatever he wanted, and 'Aly assisted him and gave him all he asked for. When he met his friends [of the Khawarij] he concealed from them his object, but he visited them and they visited him. One day while on a visit to a man of the Benu-Tim-er-Rabbab, his eyes fell upon one of their women, named Kitam, the daughter of Shuhnah-ibn-'Adiy-bin- ' Amir-bin-A.uf-bin-Tha'alabah-bin-Sa'id-bin-Dzuhl-bin-Tim, er- Rabbab, who was very beautiful. It so happened that 'Aly (may Crod, etc.) had slain her father and brother at Nahruwan. She pleased Ibn-Muljam, and he asked her to marry him. She re plied, ' I have sworn not to marry unless with a dowry such as I desire, and no other.' He inquired what it was, adding, you can ask me nothing which I will not give you. She answered : ' Three thousand dinars, a male and female black slave, and the slaying of 'Aly-bin-Abi-Talib.' He said By Allah, it was only to kill Aly that I came to this town ; so that I have already granted your request.' In the History of Zubair it is further stated that he said: ' You have spoken truly, but what will the death of'Aly profit you or me ; for I know that if I kill him I shall not escape.' She replied, ' That you should kill him and escape is what I desire, for thereby my soul will be revived, and your life with me will be one of happiness.' (Hist. Khamw, by Husein-ibn-Muham- mad, ed-Diarbekiry, Cairo, a.h. 1283, vol. ii, p. 280.) In another account she is stated to have said : f If you are saved, you will have freed the people from his tyranny and will live with your people; if you perish, you will have departed to paradise and eternal happiness.' {Eaydt-el-Haiwdn, by ed-Damiry, vol. i, p. 58, Bulak, a.h. 1284.) He replied: 4 Be it for you as you have 1 Thursday, the 24th of January, A.D, 661, by Gumpach's Tables. Lou- aon, loon.■H mi I'' ■ in • i ■ ; #5 * V I , , I y !*' 402 appendix c. stipulated.' Ibn-Muljam afterwards met Shabib-ibn-Bajarah, el- Isbja'y, and addressed him thus : ' O Shabib ! are you for honour in this world and in the next ?' He asked,' What do you mean ?' Ibn-Muljam said, 'Will you assist me in killing 'Aly-ibn-Abi- Talib ?' He replied, 'Would that your mother had miscarried with you! for, verily, you have proposed an impossible thing; how can you accomplish it?' Ibn-Muljam replied : ' He is a man who has no guard, and goes to the mosque alone, without any one to protect him, and when he goes to prayers we will kill him. If we escape, we escape; and, if we kill him, we shall be blessed in the record of the act both in this world and in paradise in the next.' The other replied: 'Woe be unto you! verily, 'Aly was the first who embraced Islam with the Prophet, (may God grant him salvation!); my heart is not disposed to slay him.' Ibn- Muljam rejoined : ' Woe be to you! for verily he has commanded men in matters relating to the religion of God, and slain our brethren, upright men, and we will kill him for those who have been killed, and [as the Kuran says], be not in doubt about thy religion'. This satisfied the other, and then they arose and took their swords ; after which they went and sat down opposite the door by which 'Aly was accustomed to come out, just as Ibn- Nabbah, the Crier of the mosque, entered and called to prayers. 'Aly walked [to the mosque] preceded by Ibn-Nabbah, and fol lowed by his son Hasan (may God, etc.) As he came out of the door he called out to the people, ' Oh, People ! oh. People ! the Prayers ! the Prayers !' He was wont to do this daily, coming out with his stick to awaken the people, [who might be asleep in the daytime around the mosque]. Then the two men came in front of him, and one who was present at the time of the murder states: ' I heard a speaker saying: Judgment is God's, 0 'Aly, and not yours or your companions';' whereupon I saw two swords striking 'Aly; one was the sword of Shabib, and it was that which fell on the lintel of the door.' According to the Maurid- el-Latdfah, the blow which Shabib struck fell on the door and missed, but as to the sword of Ibn-Muljam it struck the fore part of his head, as far as the crown, and cut into his brain. It is stated in the Haydt-el-Hancdn that when Ibn-Muljaraappendix c. 403 struck him, ' Aly exclaimed: ' By the Lord of the Ka'abah, I am martyred.' Afterwards 'Aly was heard to say, 'do not let the man escape you;' according to others,'let not the dog escape you.' The people pressed upon them from all sides. As to Shabib, he fled by the gate Kendah and escaped ; but as to Ibn-Muljam, when the people tried to seize him he threatened them with the sword, and they gave way before him, when el - Mughairah - bin - el - Harith - bin - Naufal - bin-' Abd - el - Muttalib met him with bis blanket, which he cast over him, and, raising him up, threw him to the ground and sat on his chest, and, ac- cording to the Dzakhdyir-el- L Jcby, wrested his sword from him, for he was a very powerful man. According to the 'Usd-el- Ghdbah, when Ibn-Muljam was seized he was taken to 'Aly (may God, etc.) who said, ' imprison him and give him good food and a soft bed ; and if- I live I am master of my own blood, as to pai don, or retaliation ; and if I die let him join me that I may ac cuse him before the Lord of all created beings.' In the Dzakhdyir- el- Ucby, Umm-Kulthum, the daughter of 'Aly, is related to have said : Oh, enemy of God ! and you have slain the Prince of the Faithful ?' He replied: ' I have only killed your father.' She re joined: ' By Allah I I verily hope that nothing serious may result to the Prince of the Faithful.' He then said : 'Why, then, do 3 ou ci-j r adding, ' It took me a month to poison it, (meaning his sword), and if it has failed me, God has rejected it, and I will pound it to pieces.' '-Aly lived through the day of Friday and oi Saturday, and died on the night of Sunday, 1 eleven nights before the expiration of Ramadhan, of the year 40 [ a. h .]. In the Mua'jam-el Bdghaivy, according to Laith-bin-Sa'ad, 'Abd- er-Kahman-ibn-Muljam struck 'Aly (may God, etc.) during the morning prayers with a sword which he had poisoned, and he died the same day, and was buried at el-Kufah during the night. According to the Daur-el-Isldm, he struck him with a khdnjar 1 on 1 The night precedes the day with the Muhamraedans as with the Jews, so that 'the night of Sunday' in the text means from dusk on Saturday evening to daybreak of Sunday morning. 2 A khdnjar (from which our word hanger ) is a short sword, more resem bling a knife than a sword, and at the present day in use among the Arnauts and Kurds, and, more rarely the Arabs. The length of the blade404 appendix c. the top of the head, and he died two days after. According to the Maurid-el-Laid/ah, the accounts vary as to whether he struck him at prayers or before he commenced them, and whether he appointed another person to finish the prayers or finished them himself. The majority state that Ja'adah- hin-Hubairatah prayed with the people [acted as Imam] in those particular prayers. It is related that when Ibn-Muljam struck him, 'Aly gave his two sons, el-Hasan and el-Husein, a long injunction, and at the conclusion of it said, ' Do not kill any person on my account except him who killed me, and see that, if I die from this blow, you strike him blow for blow; but do not mutilate him [to serve as an example], for verily I heard the Prophet of God say, (may God grant him grace and salvation !), beware of mutilating, even a mad dog.' This is on the authority of el-Fadha,ily. According to Maula-el-Fadhl, when Ibn-Muljam killed 'Aly, the latter said to el-Hasan and el-Husein (may God approve of them !) ' Have you imprisoned the man ?' They replied ' Yes then he said, ' If I die, kill him, but do not mutilate [or torture] him.' After 'Aly died, el-Husein and Mu- hammad-ibn-Hanafiyyah [a son of 'Aly by a wife of the el-Hana- ■fiyyah tribe] set upon him in order to cut him to pieces, when el-Hasan forbade it. This is on the authority of ed-Dhah-hak. According to the Ilciijut-el-lldtu'du, el-Husein the son of Aly (may God, etc.,) killed 'Abd-er-Rahman ibn-Muljam, and the people assembled and burnt his body. It is also related from 'Amr-dzy-Murr, [one of the Companions of the Prophet], who says, ' After 'Aly was struck, I went in to him, and his head was bound up. I said, 0 Prince of the Faithful, show me your wound. When he disclosed it, I said. It is a mere scratch, and nothing. He replied. Verily, I am about to be separated from you! I am about to be separated from you! Then Uinm-Kalthum wept from behind the curtain, 1 and he said to her, be quiet; if varies from eighteen to thirty inches; the line of the cutting edge is slightly concave for about two-thirds of its length, and then becomes recurved, that is, slightly convex, to the point. 1 The curtain which hangs before the door of the women's apartment.

I once took down the evidence of a Turkish lady, high in rank, in that way.APPENDIX C. 405 you saw what I see, you would not weep. I said, what do you see, O Prince of the Faithful ? He replied ; Angels and the I rophets, and Muhammad (may God grant him grace and salva tion !) saying: O 'Aly, whither you are going is better than where you are. This Umm-Kalthum was the daughter of'Aly- ibn-'Abi-Talib, and wife of 'Omar-ibn-el-Khattab. When 'Aly had completed his injunctions [to his two sons and the persons present], he said ; 1 1 invoke on you salvation and the mercy of God, and His blessings. He then only murmured to himself, 1 here is no god but God, until God took him. May the mercy of God and His grace be on him !' According to the Usd- el-Ghdhah, after his death, el-Hasan and el-Husein and Abdallah- bin-Ja'afar washed and shrouded his body, and his son el-Hasan recited the prayer over him, and he was buried at dawn [of Sunday]. It is also stated that when Aly died (may God, etc.) and was buried, his son el-Hasan sent to Ibn-Muljam, and had him brought out of prison in order to be put to death ; but the people collected together, bringing petroleum,^ and fuel, and fire, and said : ' Shall we burn him ? Abdallah-bin-Ja'afar 2 , and Husein-bin- Aly, and Muhammad-bin-el-Hanifiyyah replied : ' Let us slake our hearts with him ; so Abdallah-bin-Ja'afar cut off his hands and leet, but he neither moved nor spake. Then he passed across his eyes a red-hot nail, [in the manner of applying collyrium] ; still he did not flinch. Then he was made ready to have his tongue cut out, at which he complained. It was then said to him, 'We have cut off your hands and feet, and seared \ oui eyes, and you did not flinch ; why do you now shrink from having your tongue cut out ?' Ibn-Muljam replied: ' I have no dread but only of being in the world unable to repeat the name of God.' Upon which they cut out his tongue. They then placed him in a date-leaf bag and burnt him. There are differences about the place where Aly (may God, etc.) was buried; some say it was the palace of the Amirs at el-Kufah ; others that it was in the open space before el-Kufah ; others, 1 Petroleum. I have given this translation of Na/t, which is also used for turpentine, because it is most likely that the Na/t used was from the natural bituminous springs near Hillah, on the Euphrates. 2 Ja'afar was a brother of'Aly and 'Abdallah, therefore 'Aly's nephew.400 APPENDIX C. again, that it was at Najaf-el-Hirah, 1 a place on the road to el- Hirah. El-Khujandy 2 says, that the most probable account is that he was buried behind the mosque which the people still frequent. El-Wakidy states that he was buried by night and that his grave was concealed ; and the Maurid-el-Latdfah that his grave was concealed, lest the Khawarij should disinter him. Shuraik and others relate that his son el-H&amp;san removed it to Medinah. El-Mubarrid relates, after Muhammad-bin-Habib, that the first person that was removed from one grave to another was 'Aly-ibn Abi Talib. (may God, etc.). According to the Chronicle of MughlataJ, 'Aly-ibn-Abi-Talib was elected on the day that 'Othman-bin-Affan [the third Khalifah of the er-Rsishi- din] died, and that he held the Khalifate four years, nine months, and eight days ; and that he died a martyr by the hand of 'Abd- er-Rahman-bin-Muljam, on the 17th night of Ramadhan of the year 40, aged 63 years.

Written at Cairo, 14M Mithdrram, 1287=15^ April, 1870. 1 I have not been able to fix tbe position of el-Kufab satisfactorily. Dean Vincent, in his Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients, vol. i, p. 512, observes that. Mash-had-'Aly is a little to the east of the northern extremity of the Bahr-Najaf, and el-Kufah six miles to the east of the same spot. El-Hirah, D'Herbelot states to be two hours from el-Kufah, and to have been ruined by the forces of the Khalifah 'Omar ibn-el- Khattab, in the 17th year of the Hijrah. 2 Saif-ed-Din-ibn-el-Khujandy, the author of a book on the Lecture of the Kuran, died a h 767, so that el-Kufah was then standing and inhabited, notwithstanding that it is said to have dated its decline from the time when Abu'-l-'Abbas, the first of the Abbaside Khalifahs, quitted it as his capital. Abu'-l-Abbas died a.h . 13G; el-Kufah was built a.h . 17.POSTSCKIPT. On the Islands ofel-Kaii andel-Kishm, Straf, in the Persian Gulf. At p. in of the Introduction I assumed that the island of el-Kishm was identical with el-Idrisy's Ki A sh or Kaish, but lighting subse- quently upon the following note in Yule's Cathay and the Way Thither, p. cxv, I deemed the subject worthy of further inves tigation :— ' 1 have fallen into an error in the notes on Oderic (p. 52), and thn^ fF' in co nfounding the large island of Kishm, near te mouth of the Persian Gulf, with the much smaller Kais or { abou ^ j hundred mJes farther up, which last was the real terminus of Indian trade for several ages, and the seat of a prin cipality of 1 olo. At least two modern editors of Polo seem to have made the same mistake. Yet Marco, I see, shows the true approximate position of Quisci as two hundred miles further up the Gulf than Hormuz. Kish, in the map before me, {bteller s Hand Atlas), is termed Ouase or Kena.' The passage in Polo referred to (the latter clause of which is omitted both by Ramusio and Marsden) I conceive to be the following, as given at p. 195 of Pasini's edition 'Leaving the city of Calatu [Kalhdt, on the coast below Maskat, see ante, p. 37], and proceeding three hundred miles, between north-west and north, the city of Cormos [Hormuz] is reached, and five hundred miles from Calatu, between north-west and west, Chisi is found,' The position here assigned to Chisi is conclusive against its identification with el-Kishm, especially when we reflect that Polo having personally visited Hormfiz, which is within sight of el- Kishm, it is not likely that he would have placed it two hundred miles farther off. At about one hundred and fifty miles, how ever, west-and-by-south from Hormuz, stands a small island still called el-Kais by the Arabs, though more familiarly known to410 postscript. ' ' ... a; ' ' ' V: '; ■ Europeans under the name of Kenn, and it is that which Yule identifies as the Chi si of Marco Polo. But was Polo's Chid an island? In his chapter on 'Baldac,' or Baghdad, he gives us some further intimations of its position : ' Baldac is a large city, once the residence of the Caliph of all the Saracens of the world, just as Rome is the seat of the Pontiff of all Christians. Through the city flows a large river, by which one may go as far as the Indian Sea ; and thereby merchants go and come with their goods. But you must know that the way down to the Indian Sea by the river from Baldac is eighteen days long. The merchants who go to India descend by that river to a city called Chisi, and from thence they enter into the Indian Sea. Upon that river, between Baldac and Chisi, there is a great city called Basra.' (Pasini's edition, p. 19.) It seems to me tolerably clear from this passage that Polo, who evidently regarded the Gulf as a continuation of the Tigris, places his Chisi on the mainland. That inference is confirmed by an incidental notice of its locality in his chapter on 'Persia.' Speaking of the horses reared in the provinces, he goes on to say that the people of those districts convey the horses ' as far as Chisi and Cormos, two cities near the shores of the Sea of India, where the merchants are found who purchase them and transport them to India.' (Id., p. 2G). Here it should be borne in mind that the Hormuz on the mainland was in existence in Polo's time, and for at least thirty-seven years after, for Ibn-Batuta visited it about a.d . 1330:—'From this place ['Oman] I went to Hormuz, which is a city built on the sea-shore; opposite to which, but within the sea, is New Hormuz.' (Lee's Translation, p. 63). Still, it is tolerably clear that in el-Kazwiny's time, a.d . 1268, about twenty-five years before Marco Polo's visit to the Persian Gulf, el-Kais was the island frequented by the China ships :— ' Kais [or Kis] is an island in the Persian Sea, four parasangs in circumference, [that is, about fifteen miles ; its real circum ference is twenty-one miles]. Its town is fair and pleasant to look upon, having a wall and gates, gardens and buildings. It is a haven for Indian and Persian ships, and a market of trade and commerce to the Arabs and Persians. Water there is obtained from wells, but the rich have tanks. All the islands around it belong to the lord of Kais,' [or Kis]. Kosmographie, WUsten- feld's edition, vol. i, p. 161.POSTSCRIPT. 411 The question now arises, how the apparently contradictory statements, namely, that of Polo, whose Chid was on the main land, and that of el-Kazwiny, who makes the Islayid of Kais the haven for ships trading from China and India, are to be recon ciled. A passage in Ibn Batuta seems to afford a plausible solution of the difficulty. He tells us that, after leaving Laristdn, he 'travelled on to the city of Kaisa, [or Kais, the final vowel being merely an inflection], which is also called Sirdf. 1 It is situated on the shore of the Indian Ocean, and near to the Sea of Yemen.' (Lee s Iranslation, p. 65; see also the footnote to p. iii, ante). The Moorish traveller was in the Persian Gulf about a.d . 1330, and in his time, as we see, there was a Kais on the mainland, which also bore the name of Siraf, from whence he embarked for el-Bahrein. That, therefore, in my opinion, is the port to which the eastern trade, of which the island had once before been the terminus, was removed in the interval between el-Kazwiny and Marco Polo. Lut there can be no doubt that Siraf was the original emporium of the eastern trade ; that the trade was subsequently transferred to the island of el-Kais; that it again reverted to Siraf, or the mainland Kais, which was its terminus in Marco Polo's time; that it once more went back to the island, and was finally driven to Siraf, when the trade oi both places was absorbed by the island oi Hormuz.- I adduce the following in support of these statements :— 1 The MM. Defremery and Sanguinetti in their annotations upon this passage remark that, ' Ibn Batoutah s'est troinpe en donnant ^ la ville de Siraf le nom de Kais, confondant ainsi deux localites bien differentes.' (I oyages d'lhn Batoutah, torn. ii. p. 456.) In my opinion the misappre hension rests with the learned editors, since it is hardly conceivable that Ibn-Uatuta, writing of a place which he had personally visited, and speaking the same language as the inhabitants of the surrounding locality, should fall into the error attributed to him of confounding Siraf on the mainland with the island of el-Kais. Keinaud, in the Discours Preliminaire to his Edlation des Voyages, etc., p. xliv. makes Siriif the first emporium, and then goes on to say : ' Plus tard, Syraf fit place ^ I'isle de Kyschj plus tard encore, I'isle de Kysch fit place k Hormuz, jusqu' ^ ce qu'enfin les Portuguais arrivant, la commerce du monde suivit de nouvelles voies.' But there is no refer ence here to the intermediate reversions of the trade from el-Kais to Siraf, and vice-versd, which I am about to discuss.412 postscript. Suleiman, who travelled from the Persian Gulf to China about the middle of the ninth century, speaking of Siraf, says :— ' With regard to the place which they [the ships] frequent and where they anchor, it is stated that most of the China ships load at Siraf, that the merchandize is carried from el-Basrah and 'Oman and other places to Siraf, and that it is embarked on board the China ships at Siraf, on account of the high waves in that sea, and because of the shallowness of the water in some parts of it. The distance between el-Bfcrah and Siraf is one hundred and twenty parasangs. When the goods are embarked at Siraf, they take in fresh water there, and then weigh —a term used by the mariners, meaning to sail—for a place called Maskat, at the extremity of the province of 'Oman, the distance to which from Siraf is about two hundred parasangs.' {Relation des Voyages, etc., vol. ii, pp. 14, 15, of the Arabic version). Neither in Suleiman's narrative, nor in that of Abu-Zaid-el- Hasan, es-Sirafy, appended to it, and which was written about seventy years later, is any mention made of the island of el-Kais. In like manner, Ibn-Haukal, who appears to have travelled about the same period,— a.d . 943-976,—omits all notice of the island of el-Kais, but describes Siraf as a great commercial mart:— 'Then we come to Sinir, which is larger than Mdhy-Rnydn; and this Simr is the port of all Pars or Farsistan. From thence the shore winds on to Bijiram, [the Najiram of el-Idnsy and Abulfeda]. Between Janndbah and Bijirarn there are groves, and meadows, and villages, and the air becomes very warm here. From this you proceed to Sirdf, one of the most ample harbours in all Pars. Sirdf is a large town, one of the eyes of the towns of Fars. Here there is not any cultivation of gi'ound, and they bring water from a distance. Passing by this along the shore, by places where there are hills and descents, you come to the Husn-lbn-'Amarah. This is a very strong castle ; in all Pars there is not one fort more strong and in better condition. From this place you proceed to Hormuz, which is the port of Kerman.' 1 Again: 'At Siraf they abound in marine productions and com modities brought by sea, such as aloes, ambergris, camphire, pearls, canes, ivory, and ebony ; pepper, sandals, and various kinds of drugs and medicines are sent from that place to all quarters of the world ; and in this city there are such wealthy merchants that several of them possess fortunes of 60,000 direms, and I have seen them.' 2 1 The Oriental Geography of Ibn-Haukal, by Sir W. Ousely, p. 12. 2 Id., p. 133.postscript. 413 Sirat maintained its preeminence up to el-Idrisy's time a d 1153-4 o* . ^ mon o the dependencies of the province of Ardeshir is also biraf, a considerable town, situated on the shore of the Persian bea, rich and commercial, the inhabitants of which are noted for their thirst after gain and for their activity in business This town is the great market of Fars. The houses are built'of the 1UD vs o( palms, are well inhabited and very regular, for the in habitants of Siraf take great pains and spend large sums of money in the construction of their houses. Water and vegetables are bi ought from the mountains of Kham, which command the city and extend m a chain along the shores of the Persian Sea, but where there is no cultivation. The climate of Siraf is very hot On this town depend the following places where the Khuthah ('the Fnday exhortatu)! 1 ] is made, namely, Najiram, a small town situated on the seacoast, and 'Bidj4n, a strong place and the Ss D^ t iart n ) r ' n y Dast ■ Ea ™&lt;■ (-• - - anotLor Nevertheless, it appears that during el-Idrisy's time the eastern trade of Siraf, as well as that part of it which had been carried on at Sohar on the coast of 'Oman, was in danger of being diverted into another channel, owing to the following circurn^ stances:— ' In that island [Kish] is a town, also called Kish, which a certain ruler of Yemen [all the country on the southern shore of the Persian Gulf went by that name] captured. He fortified it and equipped a fleet there, by means of which he made himself master of the littoral of Yemen. This man did much damao-e to voyagers and merchants, despoiling them of their goods, and so w eakened the country that the trade was turned from the route by Oman and reverted to Aden. With his fleet he ravaged the coasts of Zanj and those of Ghameran. The inhabitants of India eared him, and could not resist him, except by means of their vessels called Masheyifadt ... some of which were as long- as a galley, sixty cubits long, made of one piece of wood, and capable of carrying two hundred men. A cotemporary traveller informed me that the ruler of Kish possesses fifty of these ships made of one piece, without reckoning those constructed of pieces put together. 1 his man continues his depredations still; he is very rich, and no one can resist him. At Kish there are culti vated fields, cattle, sheep, vines, and good pearl fisheries....It be longs to Yemen and Maskat, from which it is one day's sail,' 3 1 Geographic d'Edrisi, Ed. M. Jaubert, torn. i. pp. 397-8. Id., pp. 152-3. 1 his passage is omitted in Qabriele Sionita's edition • it follows the description of the island of Kish, as translated by me From414 postscript. [meaning, not Maskat, but the southern shore of the Persian Gulf]. Whether owing to political or other causes operating upon the mainland, it seems tolerably certain that the maritime trade was shortly after suddenly transferred to the island from Siraf. Ben jamin of Tudela, who was in those parts fifteen years after el-Idrisy wrote, does not mention the latter place, but gives the following account of el-Kais :— ' From thence I returned to the country of Khuzistan, which lies on the Tigris; this runs down and falls into the Indian Sea [Persian Gulf] in the vicinity of an island called Kish. The ex tent of this island is six miles, and its inhabitants do not carry on any agriculture, principally because they have no rivers, nor more than one spring in the whole island, and are consequently obliged to drink rain water. It is, however, a considerable market, being the point to which the Indian merchants and those of the islands bring their commodities; while the traders of Mesopotamia, Yemen, and Persia import all sort of silk and purple cloths, flax, cotton, hemp, mdsh, wheat, barley, millet, rye, and all sorts of comestibles and pulses, which articles form objects of barter. Those from India import great quantities of spices, and the inhabitants of the island live by what they gain in their capacity of brokers to both parties. The island contains about five hundred Jews.' 1 A century later. a.d. 12G8, the island of el-Kais retained its position as the principal mart of the eastern trade, for el-Kazwiny describes it in a passage already quoted (see ante, p. 410) as ' a haven for Indian and Persian ships, and a market of trade and commerce to the Arabs and Persianswhereas this is all he says about Siraf:—' Siraf is a noble city, eligibly situated, occu pying a large space, having many gardens, and also many springs which flow thereto from the mountains ;' 2 but not a word about its being a maritime place of trade. Abulfeda, on the other hand, ( a.d . 1273-1331), who was con temporary with Marco Polo, reverses the respective character of the two places, makes little of the island of el-Kais, but describes Siraf as the great mart in that quarter. This is what he writes of the former .— his Arabic version, in the foot-note to p. iii, after the words in the fifteenth line, ' twelve miles wide and twelve miles long.' 1 Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, by A. Asher, vol. i. pp, 13G-7. 2 Kosmographic, vol. ii. p. 136.POSTSCEIPT. 415 T ' t . The j 81 ^ of Kis—in Arabic, Kais—is situated between nclia and el-Basrah. This island possesses pearl-fisheries, and upon it are exotic date trees and also native trees. Its in- habitants drink water from wells, and its circuit may be accom- phshed by a horseman, if he tries, in a day. One of the people ot el-Basrah told me that he performed the circuit, ridino- on his mare, in a day, but not without fatiguing the mare. Ibn-Sa'id says that it is twelve miles in circumference. Yakut, in the el- MusUanlc states that the island of Kish [sic] is in the midst of the sea between Oman and Persia; that it is a fine island, of an agreeable aspect, full of gardens and date-groves. I have seen it [he says] several times, and have met there men of learn ing and refinement.' {Takvnm-el-Bulddn, p. 207.) We have additional proof in this quotation against the identity between el-Kais and el-Kishm; but it gives no intimation what ever that the former was a place of trade, whereas this is what the same author says of Siraf, the Kais of Ibn-Batuta and the Ghisi, as I believe, of Polo :— Siraf is the largest custom-house in Persia. It is destitute ot cultivation and pasture, nevertheless, it is a town where ships discharge and load [cargoes]. It is a populous city, and the in habitants spend large sums on their houses, insomuch that a merchant will lay out upwards of thirty thousand dinars in building a residence for himself. There are no gardens, neither trees, and the houses are built of the trunks of palm-trees and 0 i »i • er brou g ht frora the country of the Zanj. The climate ot feiraf is very hot. The el-Lihdb states that Siraf appertains to ^ of Persia on the sea-coast adjoining Kerman.' (Id p. 207). v ' In the absence of any authentic records of the causes which led to this transfer, the following notices appended by el-Kazwiny to his description of the island of el-Kais suggest that either political or commercial rivalry, or both combined, between the lulcrs of Hormuz and el-Kais, even during his time, had led the latter to invoke the aid of the Persians, and that for better security against the naval power of Hormuz they abandoned the island and returned to the main. This is what el-Kazwiny says :— ' The sovereignty [of el-Kais] belonged to a people who had inherited it, until a tyrant arose from among them whom they deposed. I hey then called in the lord of Hormuz, and the el- Hormuzy came and ruled over it; but he turned out to be more tyrannical than the el-Kaisy, so they deposed him also, and applied416 POSTSCRIPT. to the lord of Shiraz, who mustered soldiers and dispatched them in ships; whereupon the soldiers of the el-Hormuzy went forth in ships to fight them, and during the voyage disembarked on a cliff to rest. While they were on the cliff, the ships of the Per sians set fire to the ships of the Hormuzeans, and then pursued their course to el-Kais, which they easily captured. Neverthe less, the Hormuzeans were stronger and more expert in sea war fare than the Persians ; but in this instance their energy was not brought into play.' {Kosmographie, vol. i, p. 161). Nevertheless, there is good ground for believing that the trade had once more reverted to the island, and was again driven there from, during the interval of about thirty-seven years which elapsed between Polo's passage up the Gulf and Ibn-Batuta's visit to Siraf, 1 although from the circumstances which neces sitated the transfer it is most probable that both places were now superseded as commercial marts by Hormuz. The causes which led to this last abandonment of el-Kais may be gathered from Texeira, who gives a detailed and interesting account of the hos tilities, evoked by commercial rivalry, which commenced about a.d . 1311 between the ' Kings of Keys' who had again called in the aid of the Persians, and the Hormuzeans, which resulted, about a.d . 1320, in the conquest of the island by 'Shah Kothb- o'ddin,' of Hormuz, who also 'took Malek Ghayazo'ddin [of el- Kais] and some of his relations, whom he afterwards put to death. He left a strong garrison at Keys, and then departed, resolving before he returned to Hormuz to attack the island of Bahrayn, which accordingly he subdued.' 3 If the foregoing account of the several removals of the trade from Siraf to el-Kais, and vice-versd, be correct, then D'Herbe- lot's summary description of the changes which actually took place, in which he is followed by Marsden, is, to say the least, very imperfect. After alluding to the extensive traffic formerly carried on at ' Siraf,' the learned lexicographer adds : 'But since 1 Marco Polo was in the Persian Gulf about a.d . 1293, and Ibn-Batdta about a.d . 1330. 2 See the Modern Universal History, vol. v. pp. 231-242, for a comprehen sive summary of these occurrences, and of the subsequent attempts made by the Arabs to regain possession of el-Kais, abridged from Toxeira's Rela- cion del Origen, Descendencia, y Succession de los Reyes de Persia y de Hormuz, etc.POSTSCRIPT. 4|^ the removal of the trade to Kfs, an island in the Persian Gulf, the place has been abandoned and gradually destroyed.' The same fate has befallen el-Kais, the population of which, in 1835, was estimated at three hundred souls, belonging to the Al-'Aly tribe occupying three villages. On the north are the remains of a considerable town, ' said to have been built by the Portuguese ' who by the way, get the credit for all the ancient architecture on the shores of the Persian Gulf. 1 The question where Siraf, Polo's was situated is easily isposed of. Polo describes it as being two hundred miles farther from 'Calatu' than Hormu., 'between north-west and west. Almost precisely at that distance from Hormuz, by sen and in the given direction, there is a place called 'Cheroo' in our modern English charts. According to Dean Vincent,' the name is spelt 'Sherouw or Sherouve,' in the old Dutch charts, « m 5' Visscller ' 9 ma P (Amsterdam, 1651), I find it written ira . t possesses a harbour far superior to that of the island 0 el-Kais,frora which it is separated only by a few miles.—'Cheroo ' writes Captain Bracks,I.N., 'is situated at the bottom of a bay, ormed by the Bds or Cape of the same name. It contains about one undred and fifty men of the Abadaly tribe; the shaikh resides at another village inland....It is the best anchorage in a north wester in the Gulf, and affords tolerable supplies, and water. It las a few trading-boats.' 3 Another confirmatory coincidence is the existence of the small island of Hindraby a short distance to the southward of Cheroo. This I take to be the Mbeth (or ameth) which el-Idrisy places in its vicinity' Among the is ands of that sea [Fars] are the island of Kharak, the island of abeth, which is opposite to and near Siraf and the Cape es- fn, and the island of Awal.'^ The cape, as will be seen by a glance at the chart, is a remarkable feature in that part of the coast. Corroborative proof might be adduced from the relative 1 See Bomhay Government Selections, No. xxiv. pp. 20, 45 48 59fi for several accounts of el-Kais or Kenn.

To do that satisfactorily would necessitate the identification of such places with those bearing modern names which now occupy the ancient sites,—a task beyond the scope of this paper, but one full of antiquarian interest, and deserving more attention than has hitherto been bestowed upon it. Dean Vincent merits the highest praise for his researches in this line, in connection with the Voyage of Nearchus, but with the superior charts of the coast and other materials which we possess, a much more complete work on the comparative geography of the northern shores of the Persian Gulf might be elaborated. With regard to el-Kishm, it is obvious from the preceding in quiry that to confound that island with el-Kais is a mistake. I have now no hesitation in identifying it with the Ibn-Kawanof the old Arabian geographers. Abulfeda writes : ' Ibn-Haukal says that the island of the Benu-Kawan is the island of Laft, [still the name of the principal village on the island], and has a town. The Sherif el-Idrisy states that the island of Ibn-Kawan is fifty- two miles long and nine miles wide, and that the inhabitants are schismatics. It has buildings, and cultivation, and date-trees, and so forth. The mountains of Yemen ['Oman] are visible therefrom.' 1 The passage from el-Idrisy here referred to is as follows: '... the island of Ibn-Kawan is fifty-two miles from Kish, [el-Kais or Kenn], that is, half a day's run. The length of the island of Ibn-Kawan is fifty-two miles, and its width nine miles, [the island is fifty-four miles long, thirty-two wide in the broadest part, and nine in the narrowest]. Its inhabitants are schismatics of the Ibadhiyah sect.' 2 In another place the same author writes : ' The island of Ibn-Kawan, the capital of which is dependent on the province of Ardeshir, is in the Persian Sea, not far from the island of Awal, where there is a town, a mosque, and markets. These two islands are both situated at a short distance from the continent.' 3 I)-' 1 Takwtm-el-Bulddn, p. 208. 2 Oiographie d'Edrisi, vol. i. p. 158. 3 Id., p. 398.POSTSCRIPT. 419 Dean Vincent has shown unmistakeably that el-Kishm is the Ouroetha of Nearehus,—corresponding with the Woroctha of 1 tolemy, the Oracla of Pliny, and the Doracta of Strabo,—and Imds :n Brock or Vroct, the name given to the island by Texeira, the more ancient native designation. 1 'Ibn-Kawan,' or, as Ibn- Haukal writes it, 'the Island of the Benu-Kawan,' was probably the name given to it by the Arabs on their first settlement there, i rom a passage in el-Beladzory it appears to have been the island where the Muslims from the province of el-Bahrein first landed when they contemplated the invasion of Fars. 2 Among the more modern names of the island are Jezirat-Diraz and Jezirat-et-Tawilah, the Persian and Arabic respectively for Long Island. The designation 'el-Kishm,' as I have stated in note 3, p. iv, is vocalized 'el-Kasum' by the anther of this work, and I take the vnlgar 'el-Kishm' to be a corruption of that word, which signifies Beauty. Some writers are of opinion that Kishmish, the Persian name for a small seedless raisin, owes its origin to el-Kishm. Persian scholars must decide whether the derivative, so formed and applied, is in accordance with the grammatical rules of that lano-uace. O O It is a remarkable circumstance that so many of the ancient names of places in the Persian Gulf have been superseded by others, many of which are utterly unlike the original either in 1 Com. and Nav. of the Ancients, vol. i. p. 351-2. 2 The passage is as follows ' When el-'Ala-ibn-el-Hadbramy was agent over el-Babrein for [the Khalifah] 'Omar-bin-el-Khattah, he sent Harthamah-bin-'Arfajab, el-Barikhy, an Azdite, who took possession of an island in the sea near to Faris. 'Omar then wrote to el 'Ala, sending LTtbab-bin-Farkad, es-Salmy, to cooperate with him. Afterwards, wben 'Omar made 'Othman-bin-Abi-'l-Asy, eth-Tbakafy, governor over el- Babrein and 'Oman,—which places be subdued, reducing the iubabitants to obedience,—he sent bis brother el Hakm-bin-Abi-'l Asy by sea to Faris with a large army, composed of the 'Abd-el-Kais, tbe el-Azd, Temirn, tbe Benu-Najiyab, and others, and he captured tbe island of Abr-Kawan.' The historian then goes on to mention the names of tbe places upon tbe coast which were subsequently captured, among which is Siraf. The learned editor in a foot-note remarks that el-Yakut writes the word ' Bar- [or Barr-] Kawan,' adding, 'vulgo Beni-Kawan;' and then 'al- terum nomen insula est Lafit,' the modern Laft.

As regards'Oman,—probably among many other similar changes,—et-Tawwam is now generally called el-Bereimy; es-Sirr, the designation formerly given to the littoral on the west of Cape Musandim and stretching southward and westward to the borders of the Benu-Yas, appears to have gone into desuetude ; while Julfar and es-Sir, both marked in Niebuhr's map, are now known respectively as Ras-el-Khaimah and Abu-Zhaby, (see notes, pp. 138, 322).THE HAKLUYT SOCIETY.

The narratives of travellers and navigatprs make us acquainted with the earth, its inhabitants and pro- du6lions ; they exhibit the growth of intercourfe among mankind, with its efife&lt;5ls on civilization, and, while inftru&lt;5l- ing, they at the fame time awaken attention, by recounting the toils and adventures of thofe who firft explored unknown and diftant regions. The advantage of an Affociation of this kind, confifts not merely in its syftem of literary co-operation, but alfo in its economy. The acquirements, tafte, and difcrimination of 1871.2 a number of individuals, who feel an intereft in the fame purfuit, are thus brought to a6l in voluntary combination, and the ordinary charges of publication are alfo avoided, fo that the volumes produced are diftributed among the Members (who can alone obtain them) at little more than the coft of printing and paper. The Society expends the whole of its funds in the preparation of works for the Members ; and fince the coft of each copy varies inverfely as the whole number of copies printed, it is obvious that the members are gainers individually by the profperity of the Society, and the confequent vigour of its operations. Gentlemen defirous of becoming Members of the Hakluyt Society fhould intimate their intention to the Secretary, Mr. Clements R. Markham, 21, Ecclejion Square, S.

New Members have, at present (1871), the privilege of purehafing the eomplete fet of the publications of the Society for previous years for nineteen guineas, but have not the power of felecting any particular volume. The Members are requefted to bear in mind that the power of the Council to make advantageous arrangements will depend, in a great meafure, on the prompt payment of the fubferiptions, which are payable in advance on the 1 ft of January, and are received by Mr. Richards, 37, Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.
