Sir Rupert has recently received a private letter from Highwood, and I attach a copy of its enclosure. I shall let you know when an official reply is received. Yours sincerely. e C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Governraenc, Bahrain. NS.- • V' Ref. No .P./Adm/ll THE BRITISH council Telegrams; BHITCOUN BAGHDAD / 8 th Decemter, 1947. I have received a copy of your letter NO.1840-S of October 25th, 1947, to the Chancery of the British Embassy, Bagdad There is no teachers' training college for women which has been opened recently in Bagdad but there are three which have been in existence for several years. Of these three, one is for men and women which is evidently not what you want. The other two are for women but only one is good. This is the Queen Alia Institute for women only. The courses here are satisfactory, especially in the English branch. There are four British women lecturers, and they have the pick of the teachers leaving the Higher Teachers 1 Training College. The course is divided into two parts (1) (a) Four year course (b) Qualifications for entry: Iraq Secondary Cert. (c) Graduated students are sent to teach in Intermediate and Secondary schools. (d) There are English, Lituary and Scientific sections. (e) Boarders and non-boarders are taken. (2) (a) Five year course divided into: (i) Secondary School training (3 years) (ii) Training School to produce Primary teachers (2 years) (b) Qualifications for Entry: Iraq Intermediate Cert. (c) Students on graduation teach in Primary schools afterwards. (d) Boarders and non-boarders are taken. I am not sure for what grade the Bahrain Government requires the training of their teachers but I should think that this Institute would be the most suitable for them. If you would like me to make any further enquiries, I should be happy to do so. Yours ever, Sd/- H. Coulthard Burrow, Representative, B KITISH COUNCIL IN 'I RAQ 'LB' ■oOo- No.40-8 Confidential.
