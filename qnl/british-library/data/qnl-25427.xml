Please see the letters from the Colonial Office of 6th June and from the Government of India of 26th May now submitted. It will be seen that there is general agreement that it is unnecessary to give the Resident at Aden the style of Governor. As the Government of India see no objection to his retaining the title of Resident and Canmander-in-Chief in addition to that of Chief Commissioner this will probably be the simplest course and a draft to the Colonial Office in this sense is attached. On the question of the nomenclature of officers exercising powers in Aden under the various statutes there in force (see para.4 of Colonel Reilly’s letter of 5th March to the Government of Bombay (original on P.Z.2001/32) of which an extract is forwarded by the Colonial Office) we can await the Chief Commissioner’s proposals.

From Lieutenant-Colonel B.R. Reilly, Chief Commissioner, Aden. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Suhject;- nomenclature of -posts at A den. Revision of Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Express letter Ho, D.911~E/32 dated 23rd February 1932 addressed to the Government of Bombay, Political Department and repeated to me, in which it was stated that the Government of India considered that the nomenclature of posts at Aden should be revised. In my letter Ho.c/l52 dated 5th March 1932 I suggested that the revision of nomenclature should be considered when the new designa tion of the Resident and Commander-in-Chief had been decided. Pending orders on this point I make the following proposals. 2. I recommend that the designation Assistant Resident (including that of First Assistant Resident) be abolished and that the following nomenclature substituted. The Protectorate Secretary, who is now also an Assistant Resident, to be termed Political Secretary. 1 am making this proposal separately to the Colonial 01 lice. The Second Assistant Resident (formerly Third Assistant5 Assistant Resident) whose post is being revived, to he termed Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, or Civil Secretary, to distinguish him clearly from the Protectorate or Political Secretary. 1 ^x 0 Deputy Assistant i^esident to he termed Uxtra Assistant Commissioner. TL.s designation oi the Personal Assistant to remain unchanged ii he is an Oificer ot the Political Department of the Government of India - otherwise Aide-de-Camp. 3. With regard to my proposal that the Second Assistant Resident should become Secretary, I invite a reference to paragraph 9 of my letter ITo, C.l. dated 2nd January 1932, addressed to the Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay, of which I enclose a copy, in which I suggested that the Second Assistant Resident at Aden might eventually occupy the position of Secretary to the Resident if an improvement in the financial situation permitted the revival of the post of Treasury Officer. I did nos regard this solution as being immediately possible, and at present the former duties of the First Assistant are distributed between the Protectorate Secretary, the Personal Assistant and the new Deputy Assistant. 4. In the light of experience since the departure of the First Assistant I am now of opinion that the Second Assistant, when appointed, can become Secretary without an increase in the staff. This ce.n be done by allotting the principal duties of the present Extra Assistant and Treasury Officer (whose post will be abolished when a Second Assistant is appointed) to the new Deputy Assistant Resident (to be termed Extra Assistant Commissioner) .© 5. The hirst Assistants administrative work will then he entrusted to the Secretary, while his duties as District Magistrate v/ill continue to he performed hy the Protectorate Secretary. This will he a more satisfactory arrangement than the present division of his administrative work between the Personal Assistant and the Deputy Assistant. I repeat my recommendation (made in paragraph 10 of my letter to which I have referred) that the Political Officer appointed to he Secretary should usually he one of from 6 to 8 years* service. 6. In Government of India letter Mo ,F.21(12)-E/28 dated the 30th March 1929, sanction was conveyed to the grant to officers of the Indian Political Department posted to Aden as Assistant Residents of a compensatory allowance at the rate of Rs.lOO/- per mensem. All Assistant Residents posted to this Residency also formerly drew a conveyance allowance of Re.50/- per mensem. I recommend that on the abolition of the designation of Assistant Resident the compensatory and conveyance allowances he sanctioned for officers of the Indian Politic?! Department posted to Aden as Secretary or Personal Assistant, and that’the conveyance allowance he sanctioned for the Extra Assistant Commissioner. A former recommendation which I made in this sense with regard to the Personal Assistant has been negatived, hut, in view of the fact that, in accordance with my predecessor*s proposals, this officer performs duties formerly entrusted to Assistant Residents, I hope that this decision may he reconsidered. 7.

It is an easy matter for the Head Offices in Bombay to approach the Bombay Legislative Councillors in case they have any grievances regarding the Aden Administration. The trade of Aden with India is chiefly from Bombay and Karachi. (1) On considering the memorandum they are of opinion that the Armed Police Force is for the defence of Aden and that the expenditure on that account should be wholly borne by the Colonial or the Central Government- (2) The Railway at Aden was first introduced as a War measure, to facilitate the transfer of ■■ Wtroops and stores to the Military Frontier at Sheikh Othman and was since worked at a heavy loss and the public is of opinion that the heavy deficit on this account might have been included in the Central Government’s Budget and they consider that the loss on that account should be borne by the Military, Moreover it is no longer an item of recurring expense, as the railway is out of commission. (3) The contribution from India towards the Military expense of Aden was £, 250,000/—■ for the first three years since 1927 and after that the expense would be curtailed to £, 1,50,000/- which will show considerable reduction on the debit side in the Central Government’s Budget. (4) The public of Aden are apprehensive that the transfer of Aden to the Central Government means a first step towards handing it over to the Colonial Government which would be detrimental to the interest of the Oriental races. (5) According to the report of the Simon Commission, the Bombay Province is to get an autonomy and the public of Aden are of opinion that in that case, Aden should not be severed from Bombay, as they are looking forward to represen tation on the local bodies, as well as Provincial and Central Legislature.

The Indian Merchant Chamber. BOMBAY. 1677. 22nd August 1931. From J. K. Mehta, Esq., M A., Secretary, Indian Merchants’ Chamber. To The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th August 1931, No. 5997-G, as also a copy ol-the memorandum on the administration of Aden sent on the 8th instant. A copy of the Press-note giving a summary of the memorandum was received on the 18th July, and not a copy of the memorandum. I am directed to send hereby the views of the Committee of this Chamber regarding the question of the transfer of Aden to the Government of India. My Committee were surprised at the reply given by the Hon’ble the General Member to an interpellation put recently in the Bombay Legis lative Council to the effect that the Administra tion of Aden would be transferred as soon as possible to the Government of India. A few years back there was a good deal of agitationagainst the proposal, as it was then made, of transferring Aden to the Colonial Office. Fortu* nately this proposal was ultimately turned down, and though the military cantrol was transferred to the War Office, the Civil Administration has con tinued with the Giovernment of Bombay. There does not appear now to be any valid reason why this administration should be transferred to the Government of India. The memorandum prepared by the Government of Bombay attempts to make out that there will be probable loss of about Rs 2 lakhs accruing to the Government of Bombay, if aden continues under their jurisdiction. It is clear that Aden upto now has not been a cause of any monetary loss. It is observed^ how ever, that certain items which are at present charged to the Government of India will be charged to the Government of Bombay, if the latter continue to administer that port. My Committee trust that it is not suggested that any district, which threatens to be a source of financial loss, should for that reason alone be separated from the Presidency proper and transferred to the jurisdiction of either the Central Government or any other Provincial Government. If the items of expenditure, which are at present legitimately debited to the Government of India, are to be transferred to the accounts of the Government of Bombay, as a result of their continued respon sibility for Aden,it can be claimed that the income, which is at present being derived from the Saltpans by the Government of India, should go to the government of Bombay, and this will serve to set off any loss that might occur. My Committee are not aware if the Govern- ment of Bombay have in view any other factors which will justify the proposed transfer besides the financial factor. All the factors^ so far as my Committee can judge, are rather in favour of continuing the administration of Aden under the Government of Bombay, and not transferring it to the Government of India. The population of Aden consists, to an appreciable extent, of people who have gone from Bombay, and they are all interested in continuing under the jurisdiction of the Government of Bombay and would not like the idea of Aden being transferred to such a distant Government as the Government of India. It is veiy likely that Bombay, in common with other Provinces will be seen in enjoyment of complete Provincial autonomy, and when that time comes the people of Aden expect that they will deiive much benefit regarding their educa tion, medical service and the Police, if Aden is continued to develop on her lines under the Government of Bombay as a part of the Bombay Presidency with whom she has got cultural, trade and industrial relations on a very large scale. Under these circumstances, my Committee beg to urge with all the emphasis at their command that the Government of Bombay will be11 houldgot nil serve! pleased not to be a party to the transfer of Aden to the Government of India but to keep it under their jurisdiction. tie Goverr I beg to remain, her faclor [ er beside so far asm Your most obedient servant, Sd/- J.

Sir PurshotamdasThakoredas,President British India Colonial Merchants Association, has sent the following telegram to the Government of India and the Government of Bombay regarding the proposal to transfer the Civil Administration of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Central Government ;— t “The British Indian Colonial Merchants Association is surprised at the proposal to transfer the Civil Administration of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India. The proposal for transfer whenever it was mooted in the past, was strenuously opposed by the parties concerned including the Indian and Arab residents of Aden. The Association notes with regret that the assurance given to it on behalf of Government that such a step would not be taken before asserting the views of merchants and other interests concerned has not been kept. It is a matter for deep regret that government after being fully aware of the very strong opposi tion to such a transfer, should have thought it fit to float it and pursue the proposal. The Associa tion urges that Government will now once for all abandon the idea of separating Aden from Bombay as it is against the interests of the Presidency as also to the residents and merchants of Aden. ” Bombay 21st September 1931.ubaytoti Merchaff I to traosi from St 'eminent : whenever ;ly oyf the Ini Associate /en step i mercW been ^ yovernn 1 ' M °Pf lougW 11 ' he A# once I ® 11 esiiM' Aden- Aden Residents’ Representation to H.

The question as to whether Aden should continue to form a part of India was a long stan ding one, and after receiving careful consideration of the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, residents of Aden and the Indian people generally was settled sometime back and it was decided that even though the military control mignt be removed to Great Britain, with regard to the Civil Administration of Aden it should continue to form a part of this country. The Hon’ble Sir Phiroze Sethna moved a resolution in the Council of State that a representation be made to the Secretary of State for India that the Administrative control of Aden be continued under the Government of India and the resolution was adopted. We beg to enclose herewith, for ready reference, copies of the following:—A ■ • ' i.’ • &lt; ii- . ' i— mmmtm vmum'wmiah* 16 (а) Copy of a telegram from the Vice- Chairman of the British India Colonial Merchants’ Association to the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Vice roy, and to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, dated 15th March 1921. (б) Copy of a representation, dated 15th May 1921, submitted by the British Indian Colonial Merchants’ Association, Bombay, to His Excellency Lord Reading, the then Viceroy of India. (c) Copy of a representation, dated 15th May 1921, submitted by the Aden Merchants to His Excellency Lord Reading, the then Viceroy of India. The gist of all these was that Aden could not be separated from India and that the Administra tive control should continue to vest in the Govern ment of Bombay, as was the case since Aden came to be conquered in 1839 by Major Bayley It is no exaggeration to say that Aden has been built up by the pioneer work of the Bombay Indian merchants who were settled there in the early part of the last century. In fact, as was cogently pointed out by the Hon’ble Sir Dinshatf Wacha in a debate which took place in the Council of State on the motion of the Hon’ble)m the Vs ^ ir Phiroze Sethna, several Indian firms have ndia Cob ^ een working there for more than a century and o thePmi a k e f° re A ^ en was captured. The trade of scythe Vi Aden is even now lar g el y in the hands of Bombay ^ Indians, who have conducted their business in a epartraeot Way which has increased their prestige and which arch 1921 ^ aS dene I 1 I-I :ed them and the British Government.

The population of of India. Aden at Present is 53,000, which is composed of:— leu could Adn# the Co f: since* ajor 6 Arabs ... Indians...

It is only recently that the fact, a! Government of India have afforded relief to these BirP salt factories recognising the part they have dace 1 ' played and are playing in the supply of he ^Salt to this country, and it is to be feared that if the present control of the Government of Bombay is taken away and transferred to the Government of India these salt factories may have to suffer. In view of all the facts stated above, we were painfully surprised to read the reply given by the Hon’ble the General Member to an interpellation in the Bombay Legislative Council stating that ‘‘the Government of Bombay, supported, it is hoped, by all responsible opinion in the Presi dency, propose, to press for the transfer of Aden at once under the powers vested in the Governor General in Council with the approval of the Secretary of State under Section 59 of the Government of India Act ; n &gt;f)G A memorandum has been prepared and circulated by the Government of Bombay regard ing Civil Administration of Aden. We beg to point out that upto now the Indian Commercial community of Bombay, which is vitally interested in this question, has not been consulted at all The memorandum pointed out that so far as the civil expenditure in Aden is concerned there is a small surplus of Rs. 8,COO for the Provincial revenue and a deficit of about Rs. 3 lakhs for the Central revenue. It is stated that “the propriety of debiting to the Central Government items of expenditure which are really ‘Provincial’ in nature is under consideration, and the adjustments which19 : eared that it of Bomlu Governine e to suffei. ove, we \t' jjven bytl o nterpellati' tatingthat sup n the Pit fer of ^ he Govern jval of 1 59 of« epared t ibay rf \Ve beg Coinffl eI( y inters ulted ^ ,ofar as: d there' ikhs^; e propr&gt; ! „ t ite# f in .ents'* may become necessary will convert the small precarious Provincial surplus to a substantial - rr O a ^) 'T'l. _ deficit varying from 2 to 3 lakhs or more” . The r r transfer of the control of Aden from the Bombay Government to the Central Government cannot uu j 1 *- oynn 03 Jnnv/ Jon od vna by any means be justified even if this estimate of a loss of Rs. 2 to 3 lakhs to the Provincial Revenues in future is correct. It is surely preposterous to suggest, as has been sugges ted, that a loss arising from the administra tion of one particular district belonging to a province justifies the transfer of that district either to the Central or to another Provincial Government . There are much weightier con siderations which should guide the policy of Government with regard to such matters. It is mainly the people from Bombay who have settled in Aden and have made it a thriving port, and the Provincial Revenues had not upto this time to suffer any loss. If on account of any re adjustment the Provincial Revenues are faced with a small deficit of 2 or 3 lakhs the remedy does not lie in the transfer of Aden to the Central Government. The Government of Bombay, can very well find out how to make up for this deficit by other ways and means, or the deficit may be considered a necessary item, looking to the large interests af Bombay people involved in the ques tion, We may be allowed to quote the instance of Sind regarding which the attitude of the Govern ment of Bombay, so far as we are aware, is that• wy rf J* » ' Sind shall not be detached from the Presidency proper even though there may be deficit on account of the administration of Sind. If looking to the important of Sind the Government of Bombay do not want to have it detached from the Presidency proper, there is no reason why the same argument and considerations should not apply to Aden. Looking to the fact that complete provincial autonomy is going to be a sine qua non of the new constitutional reforms, it is naturally expected by the people carrying their business in Aden that it will share in the benefits consequent upon Bombay Presi dency being considered an autonomous unit. Edu cational facilities are not all that can be said of medio facilities. Arrangements for Police are also not such as are necessary in a place like Aden. All these questions will be within the purview of Ministers and it is hoped that the Ministers will deal with them to the satisfcationof the Aden people, which, it is feared, will not be the case if the Administration is trans ferred to the Government of India, from whom Aden will be separated by a much larger distance than what separates it at present from Bombay and with whom Aden is not much in contact. Aden also requires a sound and efficient Municipal Administration and a Municipal Body constituted like the Big Munici- palities of the Bombay Presidency. This will be possible only under a Minister. Owing to all these reason we beg to stronlgy urge that the Civil Administration of Aden should continue to reuiai 11I •m 21 e Presite' ]e deficit» i tflootn )vernmeot ;hed fronit ison why ii ; should 1 lete 311 o[th el [pected hi’ 1 en that it 11 Bombay IS nni 1 1 said oi lllt: a alsoB° tsl n.

Under all these circumstances vve beg His Excellency the Viceroy to be pleased to consider our case favourably and give an assurance that the administrative and civil control of Aden will not be transferred from the Government of Bombay, at any rate till the responsible Indian commercial opinion in Bombay is consulted. His Excellency has got an intimate acquaintence with the problems of this Presidency and we feel sure that His Excell ency will not be a party to any steps which may prove detrimental to the interests of the people who have settled there and contributed their quota to making Aden what it is. The constitution of future India is in the making, and we cherish hopes that as a result of the second Round Table Conference and the united efforts and co operation of the Imperial Govern ment, the Government of India and the accredited leaders of the Indian people, India will be enjoying soon a constitution which will be analogous to the one which is being enjoyed by the free British Dominions. Aden has upto now been left out of any active share in the political life of this country, and has also suffered from not having any voice in the Legislatures, whether Central or Provincial. We therefore, beg to request that, looking to the22 claims, both political and commercial of Aden, as also its population which is more than 50,000 it may be given the right of sending two representatives to the Bombay Legislative Council ; and one representative to the future Federal Parliament. We trust that these demands will be favourably considered and conceded.

Letter to Sir Purshotamdas from Mr. J. K. Mehta Copy Z&gt;, 0. Letter dated 12-3-1930 from Mr. J. K. Metha Secretary Indian Chamber of Commerce to Sir Purshotamdas Thakurdas, re : Aden: '‘Dear Sir Purshotamdas, I have received your letter of the 10th instant, No. 256. It was shown to Mr. Hooseinbhoy, who asks me to reply as below : — The fundamental question with regard to any future settlement of Aden is that there is no doubt whatsoever that we shall be having atleast provin cial autonomy for all the Provincial under the new Refoi .’ins scheme. With regard to the Central Government on the other hand, it may be perhaps sometime before it assumes a thoroughly popular form, Under the circumstances, it is better to keep Aden which has been with us for 90 years under an autonomous Bombay Province rather than give it over to the Central Government under which it will positively be considered and treated as a non-regula tion province of even worse like the N. W. F. Pro vince or Baluchistan where the people have practi cally no rights and privilleges of their own and where the administration is practically all military. Looking to the fact that thousands of our country men are carrying on their trade peacefully in Aden and have investedcrorers of rupees in properties andcommerce for the development of that place and for the development of our trade &amp; commerce it would be the greatest hardship for them and also injustice to hand them over to the tender mercies of a semi military administration. It is likely that if Aden is transferred to the Central Government greater restrictions will be placed upon even the movements of Indian traders who may not be allowed to mix 'nith the native population there in the hinterland. It is also possible that people who have their business in Aden may be dealt with severely if they or their agents or partners take part in any political and/or economic agitation in this country. Even now, as matters stand at present, there is no sortr of public life in Aden and instead of this state of things im proving it would be much worse under the Central Government. Most of the merchants are from Bom bay, Gujrat Kathiawar and Cutch and Sind Punjab and they come every year to Bombay in connection either with their trade or social matters, It it desir able that all these people should have a regime which will be ultra conservative and will even place a ban upon their activities here ? Further, Aden is an entrepot for Arabia and a large trade is being carried on between Aden and hinterland. 1 his trade will suffer if there is a change in administration and Aden merchants and traders, being nervous about the new regime, shift back to Bombay, Aden hinterland is the chief and only market for Indian piecegoods and Indian27 lace and I rce it w« Iso injosit , of a sci t if Ada ent gftf i movem® to ® hinterlt ieir busiofi ieyor dt tical an! &gt;n no'V r of f tilings i* the Cent from nd Pnni- conne* ft it dt' ginie '’i 1 ' lace 5 ' ■ibia ^ Aden ^ there i ! .&gt;hi# gime^ chief 51 d I* grains and it is very probable if Indian mer chants were to come away, the whole of the Arabian market for our piecegoods and grain would be gone, thus inflicting a very great loss to India, specially to Bombay. While attempts are being made to instal Trade Commissioners for the Indian produce, it will be quite the reverse if the Indian merchants established at Aden were unable to carry on their trade which they have established for such a large number of years. A large portion of shipping and the great salt industry at Aden is all in the hands of Indians, specially of Bombay, and their interests are so interwoven with Bombay that it is doubtful if these merchants can, without causing a severe loss to Indian trade and commerce, remain in Aden under a semi-military rule. It should also be remembered that many of the Indians staying at Aden have their families there and have also got property of their own. The education and the general well-being of these and their property would certainly be much better off under an autonomous rule than that of a semi-military rule. Even the Police is now under the Government of Bombay, and you can very well realise the difference of the Police under the Govern ment of Bombay and a Police under the Cantonment authorities. It is very difficult to understand what must be the objective or motive which induces Govern ment of India to snatch away Aden from Bombay with which it is so much joined together. In our previous letter we have pointed out that the adminis tration cost of Aden is about Rs, 11 lakhs and theincome is about Rs. 10,75,000/- and this small defi cit could be recovered by the Government of Bombay from the Salt pans revenue which is at present being taken up by the Government of India. The revenue is ever increasing and amounts to about Rs. 1,40,000/- at present. If this amount came to the Government of Bombay sure enough, the plea put forward that Aden requires more money which the Government of Bombay can ill* afford, does not stand. Many parts of the Bombay Presidency are not self supporting and that would not be a plea for snatching them away from Bombay Presidency and attaching to any other Presidency or the Government of India. In your letter under reply you have said that the Port Trust will be transferred to Central Government. It will be the case also with regard to the Bombay Port Trust, but whosoever shall administer it there will be a Board of Trustees and if Aden is a part of Bombay the constitution that would be made for the Port of Bombay or Karachi will be the constitution for the Port of Aden also. Even at present more than two Indians are nominated to the Aden Port Trust, because Bombay Government has a voice in that and because the Bombay Council, and Bombay \ people take interest in it. As regards the Salt policy, so far as the Salt Excise duty is concerned all over India it is a central subject and so far as Aden is cancerned it is also under the Central Government, What we meant in29 is small defc&gt;ur last letter regarding salt was the land revenue itofBomlipf sa lt pans just like the land revenue o£ salt pans s at preset^ Matunga, Ghatkopar, Bhandup and other places India, B aear Bombay where salt is manufactured, and the its to al)o^ an d revenue of these goes into the Government of mount ci^°mbay coffers. L here is no difference of opinion enough,t^ mongst Indians that Aden must and should remain morenrf wIth the Government of Bombay, They do not can i^ n( ^ finy l ' easotl w hy this change should take place r t s 0 f ii an( ^ unless tbe real reasons are made known no ^Indian will agree to the transfer of Indians from a idlingtk Pr ° V i nCe Bomba y t0 an administration like the , ngt0 / W * F Provinces or Baluchistan. It is necessary ”, [ t0 emphasise how already leading Indians who have n.§e)t interest both in Bomoay and Aden have become ' 1! { nervous as to whether looking to their activities in j0Ve ^ Bonfl bay they are not risking their personal rights tl ie 0 and property by having connections with Aden in sterlt ' view of this movement. The Bombay Government is “P 11 have been attempting to induce Bombay people and pde ^ members of the Legislative Council to agree to this jdnstit 1111 proposal i n f ol . m ally for the last six months and they resent 111 have no t succeeded. Of course, it must be said that Adeiif Bombay Government have no case and therefore , a # they have not been able to force any arguments id ^strongly fearing lest they may be charged with being careless of the interest of Indians, specially of Bombay people at Aden. The only ground that the lS the^Government .of Bombay have possibly put, which is» f they do not press was that Aden requires more d ’b money for education and for local self-government,and as such it is probable the Government of India would be able to place large sums at the disposal of Aden administration than the Government of Bombay. No other reason they have preferred, and even with regard to this reason, they do not say that they can think of treating Aden in any way worse than any other part of the Presidency, which means the same treatment will be accorded to Aden at is accorded to Bombay, and if that be the case Indian merchants at Aden do not see why they should ask for a better treatment and prefer to go to the Government of India, which they very much doubt will ever be accorded. They are happy with Bombay and they wish to remain in Bombay”. 18-3-30.3l D. O. Letter dated 5-3-30 from Mr. J, K. intnenh: Mehta the Secretary Indian Chamber of Commerce t the 'lisp.! to Sir PurshottamdasThakurdas, re: AdenI TOverDii Dear Sir Purshottamdas, have prefe theydoi' 1 have received your letter of the 28th February, eninai! re S ar&lt; ^ f° ^denj I had a long talk with Mr, sidency* HooSeinb h°y and give his views hereby. The Civil Administration of Aden at present thew f a l] s under the following heads; Education, Medical, y tM Excise, Local-self-Government, Police and Port ertog®. Trust. These are the control of the Legislative rvinuu Council, specially the Transferred subjects which happf so much affect the people of Aden particularly lomte' Indians who by now are a large number. If Aden is kept under the Government of Bombay, it is probable that in the new Reform scheme good many rights will be given to the people. As against this if it is put under the Government of India, it will probably be treated as a frontier province and the people will be treated like backward people and much of their liberty will be taken away. With regard to all these questions therefore it is much better that Aden should be under the Government of Bombay rather than the Government of India. Thus, for instance, only a short while back the authorities at Aden instructions in schools only confined to English, and Arabic being the vernacular of the place. This was atonce brought to the atten tion of the Hon Mr. Maulvi Raffudin Ahmed, Minister of Education, and he ordered that Gujratiand Urdu to be also considered as vernacular and that instructions should be given in these also as there was a large population hailing from the | Bombay Presidency in Aden. It is to be feared that if Aden was not under the Government of Bombay nobody might have listened to this complaint. Almost a similar case happened with regard to Excise policy. The authorities at Aden wanted a lesser number of holidays for liquor shops as also longer hours, but through the Hon Mr. Jadav Minister of Excise, it was arranged that the Excise policy in the Bombay Presidency including Aden should be the same. Again with regard to Local Self-Government the authorities at Aden wanted only nominated members on the municipality, but the Hon. Divan Bahadur Harilalbhai Minister wanted or desired to get an elected element. r • t r / There is also the question of salt policy. Y° 11 know that the Salt factories belong to the people who are from Bombay and they all would like to remain .under the Local Government. People of Aden have long since been asking for some represen* tation on the Local Legislative Council, It is likely that they may get some representation in the comming reforms. If, however, Aden is taken over by the Central Government all hopes will be lost. ;mmi £ | # 33 Under this circumstances, Mr. Hooseinbhoy strongly urges that Aden should be under the Government of Bombay. This, he assures me, is also the views of the people here who are interested in the trade with Aden. / ! Yours Sincerely, (Sd) J. K. Mehta. MM :Important note by Aden Port Trust Chairman. FOR THE TRUSTEES. The question of the transfer of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India is to be decided and the opinion of the Trustees in the matter is requested by the resi dent. There are several points ignored by the Aden Chamber of Commerce in their consideration of the matter. 1. Aden is a Fortress, the defence of which is now largely undertaken at the expense of the British Tax Payer who receives no revenue from Aden at all. 2. It is out of the question therefore to ex pect the Home Government to sit complacently by while the defence of Aden is endangered by any change in the present power of the Resident and Commander-in-Chief under Aden Regulation. Most of the Indians in Aden are only temporarily domiciled in Aden and having made their money, returned to India where they have their family ties and it is no hardship for them to restrict their political activities until their return to their own country supposing that absolute un- changablness of the powers of the Resident does not please them.t/i 1 Trust Aden fr 0 | Eminent d 3m ion oftlit b y the resi. by the Adet deration ol 'ceof whict 'ense of fk ‘venue from reforeto et iplacentlyli| ered by ao} Resident and ^illation, ien are onlj laving rdi i they hart i for them It their rein absolute § esident dots 35 4. The only real practical sympathy to Aden in the way of Government grants has been from the Government of India. It is easy to talk in a loose way of the Govern ment of India being equally in financial difficul ties as the Government of Bombay but the fact remains that these grants have been forth-coming from the Government of India and would not have come from the Government of Bombay. In the question of loans the Government of Bombay gave the Electricity Loan in 1921 but were quite unable to give any further Loans and had to refer to the Government of India who are giving the Settlement a Water and Drainage Loan in the current year. It is therefore idle to state that the Govern ment of India is not fully conversant with the con ditions at Aden seeing that they have shown their interest in this pracitical manner, bd. D. S, Johnston, Chairman. Aden Port Trust. 27—8-31,36 Reply by non-official Indian Trustees. With reference to the Residency No. C/383 ! am of opinion that no case for the severance of the connection with Bombay has ^ on ' 1 admitted that the Arabs, Jews and the Somal.s , are in preponderance but unless rt be su gestcd that the Arabs Jews and the Somalis des.re to sever tue conoecuon and that the severence w,U be beneficial to them, their preponderance *s no argument against the retention of the Bombay To hope for liberal grants is a different thing from the certainty of getting these. There are certain parts of India i. e. tire non-regulation provinces which are under the direct control of the Government of India. The peop e ere have less rights and privileges than those of the We also feel we are better off than those who are in Non-regulation Provinces. It cannot be said that the Arabs Jews and the Somalis desire to have their rights and liberties curtailed. Certainly the Bombay connection is more beneficial to the Arabs Jews and the Somalis. It is easier for them to make their voice heard in Bombay if and when they imy so desire. The relations between Arabs, Jews, and the Somalis and Indians are cordial and the influence of the Indian Community in Bombay is the advantage of the Arabs, Jews, and theSomalis. The Arabs in a crowded meeting have strongly protested against the severenceof Bombay connection. A sacrifice by one which does in no way benefit any other person or persons is a meaning, less thing without any merit and therefore &amp;o far as Indian inhabitants are concerned there is no reason why they should forego the benefit and the privileges of the Bombay connection. The due dealys of the Bombay Government which is another argument of the Port Trust Authorities is not a strong argument either. Know ledge of the due delays is enough to let us submit our proposals and request a bit earlier. If it can be said that the days of fiscal pro vincial autonomy are not far off and in these it is out of date to say the contrary, the Salt Revenue of Aden going to Bombay Government will mean no debit balances. Decreasing debit balance consequent on His Majesty’s Government taking upon its shoulders more and more of the costs of the defence of Aden is an argument that does not in any manner go against the retention of the Bombay connection. Is not the Aden Railway loss which is non recurring being made use of to argue about the defecit. The Chairman’s note obviously hurriedly written contains no sound arguments against the38 severence of the Bombay connection. Because British Tax Payer have to pay for some expenses relating to the defence of Aden is no argument for the transfer of Aden from Bombay Government to the Government of India. The Bombay Government contemplates no restrictions of the Powers of the Resident and why should the Chairman think that the Government of Bombay will do something to endanger the defence of Aden. That advance a for takinf business Govern^ severence Most of the Indians whose descendants now live in Aden come just after the advent of British possession. When British Government took Aden its population was a few hundred only, Large numbers of the Indians are presumably! domiciled at Aden. No body has ever suggested any restrictions of the powers of the Resident but why should the Chairman exhibit a desire to deny the people of Aden their right to ventilate then grievances against official subordinates to the Resident. To impute lack of sympathy for Aden to Bombay Government is without ground. the Central Does the chairman deny it? People who know better do not deny it. Vide control Budget, It is not a loose talk to say that Government is in financial difficulties.40 ADEN PORT TRUST CHAIRMAN’S NOTE. Below Presidency No. CI363, dated 24th July, 1931.

Provincial autonomy being a foregone con clusion it is definitely to the advantage of all shades of inhabitants of Aden that Aden be kept under an autonomous Bombay Presidency because it will take time for the Central Government to assume a thoroughly popular form, Aden under the Central Government cannot should not in any case expect a treatment better than that which is meted out to the Non Regulation Provinces of the type of N. W. Frontier Provinces and Balu chistan. The fact that the people in these Provinces have few rights and privillege is too well- known to need repetition. The Arabs, Jews and Somalis may be in preponderence but the fact cannot be denied that the Indians were the pioneers who made Aden what it is today. Aden Hinterland has by their efforts become the chief or the only market for the Indian Piece goods and Indian Grains, and it was India whose money the deficit balances in the past were met. The Indians are entitled to demand that this trade with the Hinterland may not suffer, but it shall suffer it Aden were to be transferred to the Government of India, because with curtailment of freedom as in the non regulation Provinces, Aden will not be very44 tempting place for Indian Merchants to remain in, Shipping Trade and the great Salt Industry of Aden are in the hands of the Bombay People to a large extent and their interests are interwoven with Bombay. They are many parts of Bombay Presidency ti ia t are not self-supporting but that is not a plea for snatching those portions away from the Bombay Government. If the land revenue of the Salt Pans were to go to the Bombay Government just as the revenue of the Salt Pans of Matunga Ghatkoper, Bhandup and other places goes to it, then the little deficit that is being made so much of will disappear. Therefore I am of opinion that it is beneficial for all communities that the Bombay connection be retained.46 182.

Towards ffiat question the attitude of the Bombay Government cannot under any circumstances be one of neutrality, and I have been authorised to give expression to the provisional views of the Bombay Government at this stage of the discussion of this question. Their position is that they have had very little notice and indeed very little time for the consideration of this question. They have had very little information of the grounds upon which the transfer is being considered It is also a fact that public opinion, both in Bombay and Aden, has expressed itself very strongly against the proposed transfer. Very strong protests have been recorded by the trading communities of Bombay and Aden, and for these reasons for the present the Bombay Government objects to any change in the status quo.49 1 recordi ADEN CIVIL ADMINISTRATION.

While no decision has been arrived at regarding it the Govern ment of Bombay consider that from the point of view of the administration of Aden and of the finances of the].Presidency the scheme has considerable advantages.” Since the Government of Bombay'.have been jasonsfor in correspondence with the Government of India bj ec [ s [o on the subject, the administrative difficulties with which the Resident at A.den and the Govern ment of Bombay have been confronted are sum marised in paragraphs 2 and 6 of the memorandum on the Civil Administration of Aden, copies of 'LlSSiOOOf ey have ittle ti® They l (rounds t ed llis; Bonibaf ongly aj&gt;i protestsl mnunititiwhich have been supplied to the Members of the Legislative Council, and the Press and certam publ ic bodies ,n Bombay A copy o h -.o. After consideration of various alternatives, the, Government of Bombay have come to the conclu sion that the most direct and satisfactory solution of the difficulties arising from divided control is that Aden while retaining its special connection with the Bombay Government to whom it would look, as in the past, for a supply of officers and administrative personnel, should cease to form part of the Bombay Presidency, and should be formed into a Chief Commissionership under the direct control of the Government of India. Before taking definite steps in this direction it was considered desirable to place all the implica tions of the position before the public specially interested in the matter and to that end the memo randum on Aden referred to above was prepared and issued to the Press, to all Members of this House and the Associations and bodies concerned both here and in Aden. Apart from the admini strative difficulties which the present arrangement entails, and which are discussed in the memoran dum, one of the main considerations for the Glovernment of Bombay at the present time is dictated by the extreme financial stringency which makes it difficult to view with equanimity the pro bability of an extra two lakhs or more of expend!-51 •ers iP n( i ctr, ture being transferred almost immediately from me Central to Provincial Revenues under the existing a Me, constitution. The delay in placing the full facts before the House has been mainly due to the fact ^ that Aden has no separate budget and that it has r ec ' been found necessary to prepare special pro forma ^ b accounts for the purpose. contio’ connec Now that the financial position has been if s;i: clarified the Government of Bombay, supported, &gt;fficer$i it is hoped, by all responsible opinion in the Horn; Presidency, propose to press for the transfer of dbefotj Aden at once under the powers vested in the thei.

HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HON’BLE THE EARL OF READING G.C.B., K.C.V.O., P.c. Viceroy of India, nPT hi May IT please YOUR Excellency. We, the undersigned, representing His Gra- cions Majesty’s Arab, jew and Indian citizens trading and residing in Aden, beg most humbly and respectfully to express before Your Excellency our deep sense of anxiety felt at the announcement, made by the Premier, regarding the proposed transference of the administration of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. It was in the year 1839 A D., that this piece of rocky land was captured by Major Bailhe, sent by the Bombay Government; Aden has thus be come. a part of the British Indian Empire and the administration has since been carried on at the cost of the Indian Exchequer. The Government at that time called upon the Indian Merchants to de velop the trade of the country. This important outpost is thus maintained and developed by Indian money and Indian enterprise; and the Government at that time assured the Indian public that Aden will ever remain a part of the Indian55 ih % Empire. It was on this assurance, Sir, that the lants Indian Merchants accepted the invitation and with their instinctive spirit of adventure, came l forward and carried on the trad e with the country ^ at great risk to themselves and to their money. A reference to the trade returns will convince any body the nature of the laborious part the Indian ^ merchants have played for the last eighty years for the prosperity of the country. It was the DELt i Indian Merchants, Sir, who played the part of the intermediary and upheld the prestige of the British His Gti Empire, and who were instrumental in turning cit j zer . the natives into loyal citizens of the Crown. imblyai; much has been our connection conducive ixcelkc t0 the interests of the Natives that we are sure uncenieit ^at the chiefs and the well-to-do Arab tribes, not propost only at Aden but round about, will oppose and .den fra resent any proposal of the transference of the dOffice administration to the Colonial Office, and the , ^ t intimate contact with the Indian merchants for | .... ' the last eighty years has convinced them of the ^ ^ the advantages ot the connection with the Indians and the Indian Government. We venture to bring to Your Excellency’s notice that the reso- 1 at tfl6 Ct: ' lution of the Aden Chamber was supported by a few merchants and only under the belief that the Government of Egypt, and they, therefore, pre* niE ferred the Colonial Office to it; this will clearly P be seen from the representation signed by over niEail ‘ and Arab merchants of the Aden Chamber of the M a hundred merchants including all the Indian56 Co*™*.-a — R ”' , “ of Aden on the 3rd March 1 It Will not be presumptuous, S.r .f we claim t0 be the pioneers in developing the trade and pro, ! 0 ( the country and it behoves, therefore, tha P y a i and Imoenal Government the Government of India an ” ■ Should obtain our view and that o Ara any change can be saddled on. I the proposed transference of the admmistrahon take place we are afraid. Sir, that in spite of the assurance of the Hon’bte Mr. Bray, in the Council of State, the rig it Of equal citizenship of the British Common,veal,h will be denied to h,s Majesty’s Brit.sh Ind.an Sub- Sects whenever the interests of the white Settlers will be at stake in future. We need not narrate here the sad experience of our countrymen in SoUth and East Africa, nor the ignominious condition to which they are reduced, nor the fruitless exertions of the Government of India in fighting the just cause of their subjects. We therefore, most res- pectfully request Your Excellency that in the interests of the British Empire, my in the interests of the prestige af British justice and (airplay, Your Excellency's Government should not be a party to produce another Africa for the introduction of the ill teeling. monopolies of trade and land and the very regretable European policy of Racial Segre gation which is but a slur on the fair nam- of British justice. If the proposed transference takes place weIsidl shall be grieved to find that whenever a country is developed by the prolonged exertion of the Indians hv Mi that country is snatched away from them and is ^ marked down for the settlement and benefit of r 'k those, wiio have played no part whatsoever in its development and prosperity. Against this sort of * treatment, we strongly beg to protest as it strikes : 1 % at the very root of the Indian enterprise and • ih betrays the Indian merchant when he believes in the good intentions of the Government. We may ^ : here mention that as a result of the Great War the amort British Colonies have been allotted certain terri- taiian tones and Islands belonging to the enemies, while t x in the case of India she is being robbed of the netua r territories which her people have brought and le , ;v developed for the Britise Empire. Such treatment mCk will naturally tend to shatter all their belief in the Si Of:; talk of India ’ s e d ual partnership in the British ;inr j !e Commonwealth and the full citizenship of the British Empire. 11®.: 1 It will not be out of place to point out here • that the landed estates of the Indian Merchants at lir P !l C Aden are enormous and the Indians have settled ^ a F ; down and have made that country as their land of uciro adoption. The Indians, settled there, have so rd id much built up their trade that they at present Ratal': command the major portion of the Red Sea Ports business and for this object some of the great Firms have established their Head Office at Aden e3 C' since a number of years,58 , . , u pre that the British Wp also bee to point out nere um We also S t { the population fjthey ^e'merely temporary res.dents carrying on trade as Shipping and Coaling A g« nts ’ “ was these few who were instrunren at n. pass n the Chamber’s resolution, probably under the same beliet that the administrahon was being transferred to the Government of Egypt. Lastly we think it our duty to bring to Your Excellency’s notice a rumour that is afloat that even if the administration of Aden be transferred to the Colonial Office, the military expenditure of the country and further more the naval expen diture on the part of Aden, will wholly or to a great extent fall on the Indian Treasury. We are sure the Government of India will not only protest against and resent any such proposal, but on the other hand will demand a share of the present and future military and naval expenditure from the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries as this gate, way is and will be maintained for the safety of the Empire. It is our firm belief that under any circumstances the civil administration of Aden can safely and fairly be kept under the Govern ment of India, even if the military and naval administration be transferred to the Imperial Government, but we make bold to point out that as suggested in Esher Committee’s Report if the Commander-in-Chief of India is giing to have direct communication with the Imperial Staff then thpre is not the slightest reason for snatching awayritis^ lain and I assini r tit bem; 1 YOU! t that •ferret iditurt :xpeii' r to; Ve art protea on tin preset e trot its gait safety t ider at; of Adsi Goveit- ind nan Imperii t out I )ort if l! to lit Staff tie binga' 59 Aden from the Government of India. We there fore request the Govermne of India to publish the conditions under which the administration is proposed to be transferred to the Colonial Office. In conclusion, we pray to Your Excellency who is upheld as the model of British Justice and fairplay and who has been specially sent here to govern this country justly and to satisfy the aspi. rations of the Indians, that Yours Excellency’s Government will strongly put forth the Indian case and advocate the Indian point of view in the Imperial Councils of the British Empire and will thus prevent the transference of an important seat of commerce which was up to now developed at the cost of the Indian Exchequer and by the Indian people.

(Through reuter’s agency.) LONDON, April 3, 1922. Sotson: (jj futnre In the House of Commons, replying to Mr, Glyn, Earl Winterton said that the question of the administration of Aden was still being f| 7 , considered. He was not aware that the Govern ment of India was anxious to retain control of Aden Augustli for political reasons, i teraporr tical anh He pointed out that the matter involved many factors, to all of which the Imperial and Indian ^ Governments must endeavour to give the weight. * ' He understood that in any case the matter would require legislation. A note in the Times of India, dated 5th April 1922, on the above reply given by Earl Winterton. Some statistician should put on record the number of .times that questions have been asked in the House about the proposed transfer of Aden and then calculate the value of the replies given to the question. We report an answer today. There is nothing new in it except a confession of ig norance by Earl Winterton who is not aware 4 ' that the Government of India are anxious to retain control of Aden for political reasons.” Lastmonth the announcement was made that the transfer was not complete, and at the timewe pointed out that the phrase was misleaded and ought to be explained. Now it seems that the whole matter is still being considered and that no decision has been arrived at ; but that information has more than once been given in reply to ques tions. It is all very unsatisfactory and we see no signs of a change to anything better unless the Colonial Office will either drop the proposal entirely or else come out into the open and disclose what burden it suggested should be laid upon India in connection with the transfer. Even Earl Winterton cannot long remain ignorant of the wishes of India that Indian residents at Aden should not be handed over to the mercy of the Colonial Office. That is one aspect of the case. Another and even more important aspect of it is that India should not without her consent be made a party to any change in the status of Aden which will commit her to paying for wild cat schemes in Arabia or in any other way financing the policy of the Colonial Office.aaile s mislei], seems | eedaii^- iat infoit eeply b ; md ^, '■oposalft ddisclosn upjb I|J| Earl Hi vishes oil )ffice, Ti nd even ia stool r to any co abia orii the Ci Government Assurance on Sir P. c. Sethna’s proposition, ' r - ^ ! .. ■ - . . The Honourable Mr. SHAFI • Sir [ my Honourable and venerable’friend. .6 p.m. Sir Dinshaw Watcha, will pardon me when I say that he entirely misunder- stood the position taken up by my friend the Honourable Mr. Bray. In saying that he was disappointed with the speech delivered by Mr Bray, and that the Honourable the Foreign Secre- taiy hnd adduced no reasons justifying the pro posed transfer of Aden. I must say the Honour able Sir Dinshaw Wacha entirely misunderstood the position. The Honourable Mr. Bray clearly stated that the position of Government with regard to this Resolution was one of benevolent neutrality. He did not justify, or advocate the proposed transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office. Now, in military and diplomatic language, the meaning of the expression “benevolent neutrality” is very well understood. Bearing in mind the meaning of that expression, I can assure the House that the Government of India will take note of the opinions expressed in this House by various Members representing different interests. They will note the fact that Indian sentiment, according to the various speakers, is entirely opposed to this transfer They will also take note •/ of the fact, which has been positively stated by the Honourable Mr. Sethna and is endorsed by7Q 0 pini| l &gt;sed to ; oftheji nt patti ntrol o| t 'refer | et i, ret rather | re control nents,t )eeches,t; lay will,! ully bo® India, 1 orononnco they do ht to E osition, 1: ononrablt ■ent net he Horn; 3 this Res: e official I ; and Gi ^ard to the: solution i: fT 0 M'r!!

That is the position, as I have stated, of the Government of India with regard to this Re* solution, and the Resolution is to be left to the vote of the non-official MembersTHE ADEN PROBLEM. No. HI. Press Opinions. Bom bap: 1932 .ment of Bombay that Aden should be administra tively separated from the Bombay Presidency and should be formed into a Chief Coramissionership under the nfovernmerit of India’s control 1C announcement has caused wide-spread dissatisf ictiou and deep resentment among all sections of the communities residing in India, and Aden, as it is regarded as an unmistakable proof that in spite of all the toll talk about a change of heart in the British Government and their desire to treat the Indians as equal citizens of the Mighty British Empire, the Government do not care a straw for the legitimate rights and liberties of the people of India. Indian and Arab merchants of Aden are simply staggered at the cavelier manner in which an important decision is arrived at behind their back by the Government of India in collusion with frhe Government of Bombay on a question of the most vital importance not only to their trade and prosperity in Aden but to their very existence as a trading people. If the proposed scheme is carried out there would be a severance of the connection between Aden and Bombay. And for what . he Bombay Government that they can not a on , 10 expenditure of two lacs a year which the connechon between this Presidency and Aden involves jn this be regarded, even if true, as a sufficient reason „ , ,. i- k has connected Aden with for breaking a imk that h ^ Thakur . Bombay for years past. S . i ^ r due in liis telegram of protest as the Presu _ the British Indian Colonial Merchants Assocut,! 4 rightly complained that so momentous a decision was arrived at by Government without consulting even the leading merchants and other interest con cerned, Moreover, it is an open secret that there is something more behind the present move of the government. It is only the thin end of the vedge. The real object of the present move is ultimatey to transfer Aden to the Colonial Office. The con nection of Bombay with Aden is nearly a, century old, and the prosperity of Aden is due chiefly to the fact that its affairs have been under the control of the Bombay Government. The commercial position of the Aden Settlement is entirely dependent on its direct relation with the Bombay Presidency, and severance of this tie could not but prove fatal to its prosperity. This is so well understood by the mercantile community of Aden that the present proposal to effect administrative severance from Bombay will be opposed tooth and nail by all the traders and merchants concerned. At a repre sentative meeting held in July last the rank inmstice of the proposed scheme was pointed out in no unceitain language. Protests against the separa tion move from the merchants of Aden have been addressed to the Government of Bombay ere this, as the problem of separation has been under discussionWhy Sever the Link? COM iterest a Shat la ove ol i thefeJf Tki jnt oo is !e frooi e raot sepaf*' ieW In the Legislative Assembly on Monday it was officially stated that the Government of India agreed with the Government of Bombay that Aden should be made a Chief Commissioner- ship and separated from the Bombay administration. This statement drew an emphatic protest against the contemplated ‘‘ reform ” and the protest was naturally voiced by two Bombay members Sir Cowasji Jehangir and Mr. H. P. Mody. In whose interests is it that Aden should be administratively separated from the Bombay Presidency ? Do the people of Aden demand this reform ’ ? The separation will entail considerable difficulty in promoting those commercial relations which have drawn Aden to Bombay and which have made it prosperous. If Aden wants “ higher standards of administration ,’ 1 is it beyond the capacity of the Government of Bombay to supply them ? We notice that the “ Times of India,’ concerned suddenly with the plight of the tax-payer in India desires that he should not be asked ‘ to fill up the gap in the annual Aden budget.” In view of the commercial possibilities involved, we have no doubt he will not demur to filling up the gap, if he is convinced that the administration of Aden is carried on with rigid economy. Bombay Chronicle, 26 th September IQ3 1 *A Monstrous Injustice. Have the British Government lost all Sense of Justice Sc Fairplay? Where is the Necessity ol Administrative Separation ut Aden from the Bombay Presidency ? We are pained to find that the British Govern ment have been heaping blunders upon blunders, at a time when they are face to face with a great upheave! in India which has revolutionised all departments ol thought, inspired the aspirations of diverse coin* munities, and infused the sense of nationality throughout a vast and surging sub-continent. The Indian problem is staring the British Nation in the face and the Round table Conference seems doomed to failure making the position of the British Govern ment in India a question of the most serious anxiety .0 1 esponsible British statesmen. Instead of keeping a cool head at such a critical juncture the thoughtless British Government have given rise to another troublesome problem by threatening to inflict upon the Indians residing and trading in Aden a mons trous injustice which is simply inconceivable. The official flat has gone forth that the Government of India agree with the suggestion of the Govern*Administration of Aden, :nseoffc Why public opposes the Transfer? Sepai* icy 9 Even if it were only on grounds of sentiment hat the mercantile communities of Bombay and ^den founded their opposition to the proposed ransfer of Civil Administration of Aden to the Government of India, it would have been highly n-expedient to effect a change, for often sentiment lj founts in politics for more than cold calculations hiD(W)r logical reasoning. More than two centuries of yt upg rade intercourse between Bombay and Aden has deparMjstablished strong ties between these two places iverse ® vhich it would be dangerous *to shatter at the natioiliCjtroke of an executive fiat- To the merchants of Dent. ^ lombay goes the credit of having developed the ion insert of /Aden and of having brought the hinterland msdoo^-nto trade connections with the civilised world. gliGo^VIerchants have built up their trade interests mssiiflfconfident in the hope that the civil administration 0 f leeptt'vill not change hands. These sentiments have [joiigiifoeen distinctly expressed by commercial bodies , anoWike the Aden Chamber of Commerce, Indian (jj c t ^Merchants’ Chamber, and the British Indian a uoiColonial Merchant’s Association. I I'cse bodies b j t , fihave behind them the unflinching support of the ^public both of Bombay and Aden. At a public (joverrmeeting of Indian residents held at Aden inAugust last, the proposed transfer was condemned as unsound in principle and detrimental to public welfare. In this protest, it is significant, a large section of the hinterland population was at one Protests such as these have made it abundantly clear that the policy of lopping off parts of a Pro vince on light considerations is looked upon with disfavour ; and that annexation of territorial areas is not to proceed on mere assumption that it affects only the rocks and soil of the territory sought to be alienated and not the welfare of human beings. Public sentiments and associa tions, public institutions, public welfare and economic interests have to be given due weight. Happily, in this case there are other strong and unanswerable arguments against the transfer, letting aside for a moment the question of sentiments. In the first place, for 92 years administration of Aden has been carried on smoothly and neither the Indian residents nor the native population had any complaint to make regarding it. It was only the Bombay Government Memorandum of July last that unearthed a grievance, held up a bogey of Bombay revenues suffering and suggest ed a remedy. The bogey is no bogey and the remedy is no remedy. The people have never asked for a change in authorities and no substan tial reason is made out for disturbing the status quo.was i Rental tai lificant, i ! or a long time past. A memorial had been addres* led to Lord Reading about a decade, ago when he on was i ™ 8 t ^ ie Vicer °y India. The proposed transfer is ; itak ?’ 0 highly detrimental to the best interests of Indian parts ofind Arab merchants that a representative meeting was (ked [ n A( 3 en on ^he 29th August last at which a territory nptian I : the :he weir s and as ’esolution was passed strongly protesting against the contemplated severance. It is on acconnt of insane acts like this that the oeople of India have been fast losing their faith in n (foe fPntish Justice.

Questions of vital moment to the Indians r e pop^ind Arabs are involved in the question of the future ^ Administration of Aden, and no political reasons 10 r f.would justify the Government in taking any action su |n the matter without consulting the residents o ^anJAden. The people of Aden are strongly of opinion ha^ » ! that the administration of Aden should continue to n° s ^'3e under the Government of Bombay as expressed in the various representations submitted to them6 from time to time. Considering the long and impor tant connections of Aden with India in regard to trade, it would be an unberable hardship upon Indians who have any trade relations with Aden. The matter is of the utmost importance to a large, wealthy and influential class of Indian and Arab mer chants and the Government should think not twice but twenty times before taking the fatal step.

Also facilities are accorded to property-holders in Aden to have them registered at Bombay. For purposes of holding property and securing justice Aden is to the merchants of Bombay, a part and parcel of the mainland of this Presidency, In these days when the proverbial ‘ Law’s Dealys ’ and prohibitive cost of litigation take justice out of the reach of so many, we ask, is it advisable to place an additional handicap of a greater distance in the path of the litigant and thus virtually deny him justice ? Why deprive the mercantile community of Aden of its right to have grievances represented in the Bombay Legislative Council ? If these facilities are with drawn do the government expect Bombay mer chants to make sacrifices as they have done in the past for the benefit of Delhi or Simla ? Delhi or Simla has little trade or economic relation with Aden as Nepal or Bhutan could be expected to have. Thirdly, in view of the impending constitu tional changes it is only natural for the public at Aden to expect a share in the Government of a future autonomous Bombay Presidency, they now fear that with the transfer of civil admmistra*tion to the Government of India, Aden would be relegated to a neglected non-Regulation Province with as little civil or political liberty as is now enjoyed by the native of British Baluchistan or the five Districts of the N. W. F. Province. We can not expect Aden residents to stagnate politically when the whole of the Indian Empire is being galvanised with the wave of Democracy. The commercial community of Aden has expressed, not without good reason, an apprehension that in the event of the proposed transfer materialising, the people of Aden would be left to a fate not different from that of the Kenya colonists. There may be encroachments by aliens on interests developed by Indians who may be deprived of the iiuits ol their labour. In East Africa and a white dominating race had reaped. What guarantee is there that the history of Kenya may not be repeated at Aden ?

Reasons Against the Transfer. We examined the other day a few of the reasons against the proposed transfer of civil administration of Aden to the Government of India. Indians in Aden make up 25% of the population, the rest being Arabs, Somalis and Jews, Thousands of the natives have developed commercial interest and contact with Bombay and are naturally reluctant to see a change of control. If we exclude those of the natives who have neither a stake nor an opinion to offer in this matter, we may safely maintain that 95 % of the population affected direct* ly or indirectly by the change is against it. We ask, what economy is it—assuming that the tiansfer saves a couple of lakhs a year—which saves a small sum at the risk of spreading dissatisfaction in n large population of a territory ? We doubt if it will mean real economy in the end. If the change is carried out it will deprive the merchants of the initiative to develop Aden or to co-operate with the Government in their measures to do so. Foi ? they will feel inclined to question. If to-day we are transferred from Provincial to Central Govern ment, what guarantee is there that we shall not be transferred thereafter to the Colonial Office, ° r the descendants of the Sultan of Lahej ? Government genuinely seek the co-operationthe Aden people they will do well to assure the public that the scheme has been definitely aban doned. Then again, in the past the commercial com munity and the public have looked to members of the Bombay Legislative Council for relief if they had a grievance to represent. They now look for* ward to a right of returning representatives of their own to the future provincial and Federal legish* hires, Aden is a point of great strategic and political importance. It is difficult to see how it can, for long, continue to contribute to the Govern ment Exchequer and go unrepresented in the bargain. If Aden is converted into an unnatural part of the Delhi Province it will fail to thrive and like an unnatural graft will wither and cease to exist as an asset. Such unnatural alliance is un called for, though Government may call it a happy marriage; in the language of Pitt, the Aden merchants, forbid the banns in the name of public weal. ii future Ii tube a Id like to its wholly be th but lithe of par berei One more reason against the suggested scheme is that the history of the last decade has filled the public of the Bombay Presidency with a genuine alarm, that the proposed transfer may piove only a step towards the ultimate transfer of civil administration to the Colonial Office. If any such idea is even remotely contemplated, not only Bombay but whole of India would oppose it.

But the economic well- i n eofpAeing .of the Hinterland tribes points in the same lirection as that of the Indian merchants. The Hinterland has become, thanks to the efforts of ^ Bombay merchants, the chief market for Indian decade^iece-goods an( ^ g ra i ns&gt; Indians are entitled to deiicf ' maintain that both in the interests of the natives 'ansfef’and their interests this trade with Hinterland transfe f( shall n ot suffer.

The desire of Aden to develop commercially, economically, civilly and politically is natural 'moh development can only come if Aden conti* nues to remain a part of the Bombay Presidency, Subjects such as medical relief, self-government, education etc. will receive the attention and care which their importance warrants only when they are placed in charge of popular minister amenable the vote of a legislature.

The Government of India made it quite clear that there is no thought of any further action beyond that implied in the present proposals, and that if at any time transfer to the Home Government should again be suggested ample opportunities for discussing such transfer have been guaranteed. That assurance is satis factory so far as it goes and we do not think the Government of India can fairly be expected to be any more definite on the subject: they cannot tie the hands of the Home Government in perpetuity.

There is a regular storm of indignation at the contemplated administrative separation °f Aden from the Bombay Presidency. A complicated and embarrassing state of things is produced by the official announcement in the Assembly last week that the Government of India agree with the suggestion of the Government of Bombay that Aden should be ad ministrati veh separated frOm this Presidency and should be formed into a Chief Commissionership under the Govern* ment of India’s control. Protests have pouied in uom every side, but the Government seem to have taken no heed of them. At a public meeting of the Indians held at Aden on the 22 nd August last the following resolution was unanimously carried - “ Public meeting of five hundred representative Indians and Arabs place on record their strong pro test against the proposed transfer o iAdministration from Bombay to Central Govern ment. Consider such transfer detrimental to their interests and welfare. Request take immediate steps. Prevent transfer and appease public mind.’’ A meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was also held to consider the question and the Chamber also unanimously passed a resolution that Aden should not be severed from Bombay, a copy of which was duly forwarded by the Hon. Secretary to the Resident at Aden. The resolutions, evidently, were consigned by the Government to the waste paper basket. This has naturally provoked virulent attacks ..... wutume to turn a cleat ear to f 0 ’ 7* We 110 doubt that they will stir hornets nest around them.

Many influential business Houses of Bombay have established branches and acquired property in Aden and the settlement has in consequence grown commercially to a position of considerable importance. These business Houses strongly protest against the transfer of Aden to the Government of India, as they look upon the Govern ment’s action as a deliberate betrayal of their interests. Most of the Aden traders hail from Bombay and as the administration of justice in Aden is under the supervision of the Bombay High Court, the Head office in Bombay of the Aden traders find it very convenient to fight-out their cases in the Bombay High Court, a convenience which they would lose should the administration of Aden be transferred to the Central Government as contemplated. Moreover, the documents for properties in Aden are allowed to be registered in Bombay which also is no inconsi derable advantage to the Aden traders, and which they would not like to forego under any circum stances. Then again there is the Bombay Legislative Council near at hand to ventilate the grievances of Aden traders, through some Councillor or other. These and many other similar advantages would have to be forfeited by the Aden traders should the transfer resolved upon be carried out by the Govern ment. The Aden traders apprehend that the proposed transfer is merely a make-believe arrangement, the real objective being the transference of control into20 the hands of the Foreign Office. The Indian and Arab traders of Aden are not such greenhorns as not to be able to see through the plot patched against them. The Colonial Government, evidently, desire to have a finger in the pie. The Aden Settlement has no desire to be reduced to the unenviable position of one of the non-regulation provinces like the N. W. Frontier Province or Baluchistan. There appears to be no valid reason why the administration of Aden should be transferred to the Central Government. The plea put forward is that certain items which are at present charged to Government of India will have to be charged to the Government of Bombay if the latter continue to administer that part, and so there would probably be a loss of about Rs, 2 lacks accruing to the Government of Bombay, if Aden continue under its present jurisdiction. But can this be regarded as sufficient reason for the severance of the century old connection between Aden and Bombay ? Is any and every district which threatens to be a source of financial loss to be seperated from the Presidency pioper for that reason alone ? Is not the idea absurd in the very face of it ? Would not the Bombay residency be reduced to the smallest limits, if the i ea were stiickly enforced in every case and carried to its legitimate conclusion ? I s seperation the only remedy for financial loss ? I s it not a suicidal step m the l ong r ? Better and more equitable remedies the OnP* f ° r the fina ™al loss, if it is J aC ° r ln the situation which urges the Go vernment to adopt the i Pl Ule hateful measure.

It will ruin the commerce and trade with Aden, converting it again into the desert that it was before. The Bombay merchants made this port what it is to-day. The change is bound to cause wide* spread dissatisfaction among the merchants of Aden as well as of Bombay. It is the natural desire of Aden to develop its commerce and to bring about economic and political salvation. But the proposed change will blast their hopes for even. Aden must continue to be part of the Bombay Presidency, as a condition precedent to its development. Its transfer will deal a death blow to all its legitimate hopes and aspirations.

Well may the Bombay merchants as well as Arab tribes living in the Hinterland cry out against the proposed transfer. Their economic well being is threatened by the change and there is considerable force in their bitter complaint that the said change is going to be effected against their will and without their being consulted even for form’s sake, It has been expected by patriotic Indians that Indian defence will be an Indian concern at no dis* tint date and Aden is valuable as defence post to a future India. Indians, therefore are very averse to pait with the control of this important strategic point.

The commercial Community of Aden enter tain serious apprehension on this subject. Moreover, they fear that with the transfer of the civil adminis tration to the Government of India, Aden might have to put up with all the disadvantages of a non- Regulation Province, and their fate would be little better than that of the native of the N, W.

For the last ninety two years the administration of Aden has been carried on without a hitch, and there is no earthly reason for disturbing the the Status quo. Neither the resident of Aden nor the merchants of Bombay dealing with this port have ever made any complaint about the administration or demanded a change in the same. The bogey of Bombay revenues suffering by the connection of Aden with Bombay is too transparent a subterfuge to deceive any one. It would be a suicidal policy on the part of the Govern ment to cut off the ties between Bombay and Aden with one stroke of the pen. The merchants of om &gt;ay have made no small sacrifices for the development of this port. This they did on the assumption that there would he no change in the Civil administration.

We would, therefore, urge the Government, with all the emphasis at our command, not to take any hasty action in the matter and not to antagonise the citizens of Aden and the merchants of Bombay at a critical . juncture in the history of this country. ^ Satya Mitra, 8th November 1931 , r Aden re is' no, N ts of any 1 a c. enues30 Transfer of Aden. A fortnight ago an influential deputation representative of diverse commercial and other interests waited on His Excellency the Viceroy and discussed the question of the transfer of civil administration of Aden to the Government of India. A clear case was made out by the deputation for the preservation of the status quo. Bombay Mer chants have raised Aden to the position which it now occupies. The trade of Bombay with Aden and the Hinterland is considerable and for ninety years and more there has been no complain that civil administration was lagging in progress. To day the whole country stands at the threshold of vital poltical changes. Aden expects to share the benefits to be derived their from. Aden desires representation in the future legislature. She could turn to Bombay authorities and legislature more speedily for relief than she could turn to the Government of India. So far the only considera tion advanced by the Government of India for the suggested transfer is that at present sanction of three authorities has to be obtained for certain expenses e, g. on Police Department, which causes considerable inconvenience and delay. The Government of India believe that once they take over the civil administration of Aden, they will be in a better position than the Bombay Government to look after Aden’s progress.

The assurance which the Bombay Deputation has received from His ential Excellency the Viceroy is halting and calculated to nercinl increase fears rather than allay them. The assu- e my tiit'ance is that the Government had not yet made e transfer tip their minds to effect the transfer; public opinion irernmentfiiould be consulted before the change is effected, ae depoialifhe Government saw no reason why Indian inter- 3 .

We fear that'32 notwithstanding the assurance given that at present no transfer to Colonial Office was contemplated, this would be proposed next. If this happens this problem becomes an all-India question. Aden is not merely a port of commercial importance; it is a base of strategic and military importance and as such of immense value to an independent India in future. No nation can contemplate with equa nimity the handing over of the control of a strategic point to any other nation, however friendly. sounding popular opinion before they effect the change, we presume they mean to refrain from it if the public opinion is thoroughly hostile. So far we have not come across a single body of any importance or connected with commerce with Aden, which has advocated this change. Many important institutions and representative bodies have already expressed their opinion against it. The Council of State has expressed itself against this change. However, to leave no room for doubt in the mind of the Government, we hope Chamber of Commerce and organisations will reiterate their resolutions condemning the transfer. If the Government of India are bent upu 11 having their way in spite of all opposition from the public we trust they will at last defer all deci* sion till the constitutional reforms now innminc^33 are inaugurated. It will not be fair to Bombay or to Aden to rush through a change of such impor. tance when the constitutional future of the Bom bay Presidency and the country is in the melting- pot. Let the future legislatures decide this ques tion. Aden administration has been carried on well for over 90 years and a year or two more will not make any material difference.

Transfer not likely to materialise. An influential deputation composed of represen tatives of a number of important commercial bodies is about to wait upon the Viceroy in connection with the proposed transfer of Aden from the control of t he Government of Bombay to that of the Govern ment of India. It has been confidently asserted in responsible quarters that the proposed transfer is not likely to be carried out in view of the wide-spread dissastisfaction caused by the Government proposal. The deputation is to include such influential perso nages as Sir Chunilal Mehta, Mr. Husseinbhoy Laljee Sir Hormusji Aden walla, Mr. H. P. Mody, Mr. K. Netrajan, H. M. Mehta and Mr. J. K. Mehta. The manner in which the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of Bom bay to that of the Government of India is proposed to be effected is now pretty well known. The great World War revealed the importance of Aden in the British Empire. Government repeatedly gave as surance to the public that they had no intention of arriving at a decision without giving the Assembly an opportunity for discussion, but to the great surprise of the legislature in India, its members learnt on 3rd March 1927 from a casual remark by His Excellency the Commander-in—Chief that the control of Aden acl lenient bred) tl]e yia Id ^ t# The P sletlfftliestf grtio of India. gitiaats botl j0 past Indi gif do smdl § port, the Ii yAden Admi at without s ssultiog thei irestiflg.

At once lf »U(t, the whole of the Asiatic population in Aden protested against the action of the Government in 'the most ^ vehement manner. They looked upon it as a gross breach of the promise given by the Government of India in the Legislature through their representa- tives. The public are not in a position to know whether the step was taken by His Majesty’s Gove: n- ment in London without consulting the Government tk c^; of India. Great was the resentment felt by the In nan of h I®, merchants both in India and Aden Although for otly years past Indian capital and Indian enterprise have Itransfej made no small contributions to the development of he this port, the Imperial Government tried to dismem- ment her Aden Administration from the Indian Govern- fluentiaU ment without showing to the Indians the courtesy of seiubhoyl consulting them. The history of Aden is very Mody.i; interesting. In 1839 this rocky port was captured i. Mek by Major Bellie sent by the Bombay Government. Iministri The settlement was atonce converted into a Political •ntneiiti Residency, From that time it has become a port of idia isp| the British Indian Empire. The Government called m Tkp lipon the Presidency of Bombay to develop the trade ofAdear t ^ ie countr y* The' Government at that time had itedly f given an assur ance to the Indian public that Aden nointc wil1 remain £or ever an integral part of the Indian A.k Ernp i re ' Indian merchants promptly responded to ie cr &gt;r, t ^ ie i nv it a tion and at the risk of losing the capital rdearo' i nveste d by them carried on trade with Aden. It HisE© ^ us seen that for the last 90 years the port : of Aden has been maintained and developed with thesr*‘'rf. &gt; l 36 i Indian money and Indian enterprise. The Indians al.o acted as intermediary between the natives of Aden and the British. Moreover Indian troops were always employed in maintaining peace and order in the newly acquired land. And yet an important change in the administration of the port has been proposed by the Government without even a formal consultation. The Aden Chamber of Commerce which had previously favoured the transfer of Aden to the Colonies unanimously passed a resolution condemning the transfer and recommending that Aden should remain under the Government of Bombay. On the 14th March 1927. there was a debate in the Bombay Legislative Council on a motion for adjournment of the House on the Aden question in the course of which Sir Chunilal Mehta assured the House that the transfer that had taken place related purely to military and political matters and that the civil administration of the settlement would continue to lie in the hands of the Govern ment of India. But the merchants of India and Aden protest against the transfer of the civil adminis tration of Aden from the control of the Government of Bombay to that of the Government of India. Aden owes its development to the energy and enter prise of the Bombay merchants and it must, therefore, remain under the control of the Bombaj Government.

We nre not surprised at the “non possumus” attitude professed by the leader of the House in the Bombay Legislative Council, when Rao Baha dur Kale gave notice of an adjournment motion in regard to the transfer of Aden from the control of the Government of Bombay to that of the Central Government. We have given some atten tion to this matter, but have failed to find any cogent reason for the sudden decision of the Central Government to add to their own responsi bilities without any reference to the interests of Bombay. We have already dealt with the matter on a previous occasion, but we would like to point out that when Bombay along with other provinces in India is going to get full provincial autonomy, the whole question of territorial defini tion ought to be deferred till preliminary decisions are taken by the Round Table Conference. The present is a very inopportune time for this move. The population of Aden consists of both Hindus and Muslims and the majority of mer chants have migrated there from this Presidency and their trading interests dominate the growth of the locality. Their head offices are in Bombay, and they do not like to be removed from under the control of the Government of Bombay to the Central Government for many reasons. With full provincial autonomy in Bombay, greater attentionwill bo paid to the interests of Aden than at resent and the merchants would certainly prefer to approach a Government which is more respon- sive to their needs and which is nearer to them than the Central Government. The adnumstra- tion of Justice at Aden is under the supervision ot the Bombay High Court and the present arrangements will have to continue If that be the case is it not more convenient for Bombay merchants to prosecute their suits here as usual rather than in conditions that affiliate Aden with Simla ? The Aden merchants are permitted to register documents for sales of properties in Bombay, and it is a great convenience to them, which will have to be revised in case that settle ment is transferred to the Government of India, The present deficit is negligible and can easily be made good with rigorous economies and with the removal of unnecessary offices. There is a semi military administration at Aden and it will have to be replaced in the future with a civil administra tion, with consequent reductions in the military force. If this is done, we do not know why there should be any deficits at the end of each financial year. Some time ago negotiations were being carried on for the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office, and though this proposal fell to the ground and the military control was transferred to the War Office, the Civil Administration has continued with the Government of Bombay.

Both Muslims and Hindus are equally anxious not to be transferred either to the Colonial Office or the Central Government, and the question of expense ought not to out-weigh all other considera tions. The population of Aden consists to a very great extent of the people of Bombay and they have in unequivocal terms protested strongly against their destinies being handed over to the Central Government, for no sensible reason what ever. As we have already said, the whole Indian constitution is in the melting pot and a 1 new constitution is being hammered out in London just now. When the people of this Presidency shoulder the burdens of a practically autonomous system, they will have time enough to consider and decide about the transfer. Aden is essential to this Presidency, because it has been connected with Bombay for many years now and it is the first port of call on the way to India, and it ought not be deprived of its next door settlement. The burden of a few lakhs would be a flea-bite, when crores have been sunk in the Backbay. Aden ought not to be transferred without the consent of the people concerned. The Government of India are welcome to be in charge of settlements like trie Andamans, but Bombay may well be trusted with the responsibility of Aden.

In proof of this vhichhiJ i statement he cited the fact that the Government had Realise) received a heap of memorials on the subject which was : not event under consideration and the very fact that His Excellency as propo&gt;?i had agreed to receive the deputation negatived the as- fliey fmte sertion that the Government were in a hurry to lake the 1 autonii W step without consulting tl^e parties most coneerned‘legation! triccl to ( l u,et tllc fcars the deputation regarding the consideij! tranfer to the Colonial Office by stating that no such essedttied suggestion has been considered and promising that all aadeb^ interests concerned would be consulted, should the adrainistm question arise in future.

Lord LAMINGTON asked for informa tion as to the recent changes made in the administration of Aden, and moved for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, with reference to the first Motion that stands in my name on the Order Paper I would briefly refer to what has been the administration of Aden. Before the War the Government of Bombay, acting under the Government of India, had to do entirely with the administration. In 1929 an Act was passed to regularise a decision that had been adopted by the Cabinet here in 1926 and the purport of that Act of 1929 was to give the Colonial Office political responsibility for Aden, A206 Aden Air Ministry the^ilita^control, and [ I OFDS ] Administration. administration of the Settlement he ^ the — Aden except in regard to supplying t zj nf the administration. On April' of this year a further statement nnneared in The Times quoting an ex- rr from the Government of lndg Cnzette in which it was stated that ioi the future Colonel Reilly, who had been Resident at Aden would ac ‘ as Commissioner, and tha formerly vested in the Government of Bombay would be taken over by him excepting the judicial system which would be still under the High Court of Bombay. I wish only to ask the noble Lord who is going to reply as to what is the exact position at present in regard to the ad ministration of Aden. Does the Bombay Government still supply the personnel of the subordinate posts, and is the Govern ment of Bombay entirely cut off from routine official communication with Aden? The object of my Motion is to elicit exactly what is the form of administra tion working now at Aden. Lord STBATHOONA and MOUNT ROYAL: My Lords, His Majesty’s Gov ernment is grateful to the noble Lord for giving it this opportunity of explain ing the one change that has occurred in the administration of Aden. The noble Lord was correct when he outlined the system under which the system has been run up till a short time ago. A new de cision was taken in 1927 and if I may briefly restate it this was the effect of it: First of all, at Aden the Settlement itself—that is the Settlement of about 75 square miles, town, harbour and imme diate neighbourhood—'was to remain part of British India administered as part of the Bombay Presidency. Political and military control was to be primarily in the hands of the Colonial Office and defence organisation was to be in the hands of the Air Ministry. The Resident and Commander-in-Chief was to be the head of the Administration, being the servant of His Majesty’s Government in London in respect of political and mili tary matters. In respect of the civil Lord Lamington. $ Our to continue to be the servant of the Got ernment of India and the Government o : Bombay. In regard to expenditure th present position is that the Home Goven ment bears the whole military political cost, except for a contrihuti from Indian irovoniiGS amounting f{ £ 150,000 or one-third of the total, whic ever be the less. The cost of the cr administration remains a charge on Indj revenues subject to a contribution £8,000 from Imperial revenues towar the police force. With that brief sketch of the Ad administration I can now deal with t one modification which has taken pla This modification is confined i clusively to the civil side of tl hilt!* 1 administration—that is, to the arrang; fliilljie ments for running the town and ment, the few r square miles of Arab ^or Aden an native ^ since W Ufa ave ; •seffied of ■utijects. noble L° r( U recently a &gt;'? „ Mow 4 at froclaff id, by itenlup' l lke , direct contro. it T w iat i.M of toe &gt; observe (isiiinv ?olved i of Adei which are British India and which nothing to do with the political i military control of Aden or the contai fried«the sim] of foreign relations. Difficulties hare arisen over the administration, le Settlement is an expensive place to and the importance of its geographical ® situation makes it essential to keep a high standard. Civil expenditure has been divided in the usual Indian manner between “ Central ” and “ Provincial,' but the division, though workable in ai ordinary Indian district, has involved considerable inconvenience in the case of Aden. The administration of the police, for instance, is properly a Provincial charge, but owing to the peculiar situation of Aden it has assumed a wider importance and it has been necessary in the past for the Resident to obtain the approval occasions of three different bodies-ttc Government of Bombay, the Government of India and the Colonial Office- necessary expenditure could be incurre^ The Secretary of State therefore agi on grounds purely of administrative financial convenience and on the adw of the two Indian Governments m cerned, to the elimination of the Gov* ment of Bombay from the picture, n step was taken in the best interests Aden and of Bombay itself for, while cannot but be painful to sever administrative link which has held nearly a century, the commercial (dine, which Ijmt and lesi (d by the va having liff Commissit ps of a mi nwill be no B, under wh toy will still !« of the i Governmen lit Chief Cor (stained by th k that dea by the nol nd I want t py one of ad: tonvenience, Secretary of Indian Govern it» LAMINI Lord very &gt;1 and comple 'stand that te wil wy Governm STRATI j^L: I am m I will k course. 1)11 Question llCdi Ij' Cl/ Cll L U.A j UAi.v-' vy\_» ^ other ties between Bombay and A !! t withdrawnration Settle®, 2 q 7 Our Policy in [ 27 Ape TO will continue unimpaired, while on. the hr' other hand a perpetuation of the old i ' administrative system would certainly th w have meant financial loss to the Presi- 1 0| dency, since the Central Government f f ^could ’not have continued indefinitely the 01 4 ^ disbursement of Central moneys on Pro- IL 1932 the toit vincial subjects. costf The noble Lord referred to the notice Hk;TVich recently appeared in the Gazette i coiitjfcwith reference to Aden, and without revei],quoting the whole of that Proclamation I can inform the House that the effect of that Proclamation is to constitute itcl1 of Aden, by notification, a Chief Commis- 10w ^Aionership, like Delhi, in India, under 1 %he direct control of the Government of s C0I %ndia. That is the whole effect and the dl si 30 j e e g ec t of the notice in the Gazette. t to fc w fff flge observed that no change what- towi ar. 3V e r is involved in the relations between ‘ * India or Aden and Whitehall, nor in the iia and inclusion of Aden on the political map tlle : as part of British India. What has been leu ort:effected is the simplification of the Indian DIci machine, which would make it more linistrat efficient and less liable to difficulties naive p; caused by the various Government De- ){ its p partments having to be consulted, and as sential a Chief Commissionership Aden will enjoy dl experfhe status of a minor Local Government, sual UiThere will be no change in the judicial and “Mystem, under which the High Court of igh won Bombay will still exercise its functions, dct, h but some of the powers hitherto vested dence in in the Government of Bombay are vested in the Chief Commissioner, and others are retained by the Government of India. 0 1 I think that deals with all the points i Promt]®' _ . _ - ■ ■ tuliar raised by the noble Lord on this Ques- wider tion, and I want to emphasise once again ary htk the change, small though it is, is merely one of administrative and finan cial convenience, and has been taken by erect the Secretary of State on the advice of ’&gt; the Indian Governments concerned. c0U ldii Lord LAMINGTON: I thank the oble Lord very much for his very ex- licit and complete statement. Am I to aderstand that all the minor adminis- . . w'ative posts will still be filled by the o j|! Bombay Government ? the k ' Lord STRATHCONA and MOUNT best 1 ROYAL : I am not quite certain on that xme course. ^ On Question, Motion for Papers, by save, withdrawn. the Middle East. 208 OUR POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Lord LAMINGTON rose to ask His Majesty’s Government whether, follow ing on the reply given by Lord Passfield on the _20th of May, 1931, the desirability of having the affairs of the Arabic-speak ing peoples of Arabia, Egypt and the Sudan being dealt with by one Govern ment Office has been further considered; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said : My Lords, the next Question which I have on the Paper deals with a sub ject which I brought to your notice in 1926, and on which last year a very much fuller debate was initiated by Lord Trenchard. It was a more important de bate, because some alarm was felt by many of us interested in the Near East as to the exact responsibility for affairs in the Near East at the present time. There were so many Departments and so many Governments concerned in those affairs—the Government of India, the Colonial Office, the Home Government and three defence Departments, all con nected with or interested in the general question of Arabian administration. Lord Passfield gave a very satisfactory assurance at that time. While there were so many Departments concerned in the administration of Arabian affairs he reiterated quite definitely that the Cabinet undertook the control of all issues of policy in regard to the couni lies concerned. Lord Trenchard was very much reassured by that explicit state ment, and I have no reason to doubt that the present Government will con tinue that policy of concentrating all responsibility upon responsible question^ attaching to Arabia and the adjoining countries in the Cabinet and in the Gov ernment’s own hands. That is the first consideration, but Lord Passfield made this admission in a passage m his reply. He said: “ But let me say at once that this sub- ject has engaged . ... and « ap H frtotlAi rrnU &amp; ”the present arrangements are e! l!j er y satisfactory or that they wiB necessarily escape reform as things happen. The object of my Motion is really to elicit from the Government whether any , i ~ fir* TAnt, whole rankled that this great Arabian peninsular, more than any other part f I, i ICi 209 the globe’s (Mr Policy in surface, offers a s'' 1 '' 1 :7c„°u„try which is a geographrcal umt ? + - na l characteristics are all ot the sletad-it is a great desert country. except for the Yemen. practically all of one [lords] the Middle East. 2h (lif.rJ The population race. They ar6 P o„e language, and they have one nave one languag ^ £ _ that that 1S religion. ■ ntiiuii 'I think, therefore, Sent reason why it would be very desirable if possible, to have one Department of State dealing with such a very homogenous country. I have also included Egypt in the scope of my Motion, because Arabia may be considered a connecting Imk between Asia and Africa. Egypt, although it lies in Africa, is inhabited by Arabic-speaking people, whose religion is Mahomedan They have constant intercourse with Arabia and many communications, especially with regard to the holy cities, which are mostly to be found in Aiabia. Therefore I have included Egypt within the scope of my Motion, because it would seem to be advantageous that there should be a service of officials who can speak Arabic and therefore pass for any part of that area of country. For the reasons which I have given it must be clear that all the questions arising are more or less of the same character. There is a basic understanding between all the people inhabiting that part of the world, and therefore if you take an officer from one part and remove him to a distant part he will not be coming as a stranger. All the questions affecting that area are really of the same character. How strong is the feeling underlying the various tribes in Arabia was shown when the declaration of a national home for the Jews in Palestine was made, because it provoked resentment right down to the Yemen. Angry protests were made, and in 1925, when Lord Balfour went to Palestine, and then to Syria and Damascus, a very unpleasant incident arose when he was at Damascus. It had nothing to do with the Syrian people or Syria itself, but arose because they were so closely connected with Palestine. There is a wonderful inter connection between all those parts of the East, and it is very desirable, I think, l o get a number of officers who can transfer from one part to the other. At present, I believe, the system is to find Lord Lamington. anyone who can talk Arabic, and him wherever a man is wanted, without any regard to his particular suitability, 0 | to whether he has had a special cob- nection with Arabia. In general, ] imagine there is no real service of officers, unless it be in the Sudan, otherwise think it is just a mixed-up affair-^ , ;1 man can be posted anywhere if he i suitable. I cannot conceive a bette jW# rl cnh the kind I have just indicated. Then comes the question of who o administer this service of officials, seems to me that the one Departure!; which is concerned with all the issues that arise from time to time in that pan ^ven years- of the world is the Foreign Office, present the Colonial Office, who deal nto Dthak, Aden.

Consequently, tk Colonial Office will deal only willjj] his Palestine and Aden. I understand that te Tha the Government of India still administers, ^ q 0 i 0 all the posts on the Persian Gkdf-j SM h a s ta Bahrein and so on. I do not think that L seTen y e duty has been taken over by the... a ver y jp Colonial Office ; I think the Government as of India is bound to be interested in ., the policy in the Persian Gulf. But the ^ j ha- reason I think the Colonial Office ought !D to be eliminated is this. I do not know whether it is so at the present moment, but certainly when the Colonial Dice was first put in charge of any mandated territories or places like Aden great opposition was aroused. Because people like Ibn Saud, Chief of the Wahabi in Central Arabia, and the Imam of the Yemen in Southern Arabia, are very.. important sovereigns indeed, and they say, “ What have we got to do with Colonial Office ? We are not a Colony; My Lore we ought to deal directly with Hi' be to elucidat i is very nethods ai ease two mve. Majesty’s Government.” And I do not ' career sed this 1 and such in I called the blame them at all. It may be a mistaken view on their part, but it is a very natural view to take. And it does seem to me very desirable that you should take ; :i I J t to away the purview of these matters from J ' a l disi the Colonial Office. ‘mW 0 ®’ a s far It may be said that the Foreign Offieej to is not a suitable Department to deal wit a mandated territory; that they made mess of affairs in Somaliland, and are m ^ ■■ w in his No ^ Lord iK- 211 0wr Policy in [ 27 April 1932 ] likely to do any better in Arabia. The /' answer to that is, first, that the Sudan Mfis administered under our Government, 11 and I imagine has to deal directly with ^ the Foreign Office. And I would! say, ldai ! ^Without any criticism of those who are ie ^P irresponsible for the Colonial Office administration in this country, that it 0Qc eiie : 5 eems to me a perfect disgrace that in Vl ceo[[;*21, and for six or seven years, you had fie Imam of the Yemen sending down his ;i on 0 j orces to Dthala, a place within sixty niles of Aden. We continue to pay a 0]le i ubsidy to him at Aden, and yet there tl, .' vere the forces of the Imam of the Yemen ^ q full occupation of this place Dthala for rei ix or seven years—a place directly under ce he Protectorate of Aden, and nothing ould be accomplished by the Colonial Iffice to get rid of this force. the Middle East. 212 i n or “ ay p ° £ 1 fi a8 . t / ear ’ whe,, the '“ble Lord, rasslield, replied {or the Govern- ‘ occasion there has been really no change to report in the situation, as far as what we were told on oemed OCa H n by L ,° rJ PaSsfield c “n- cerned H e explained that closer udorded 8 i f ; 0 ' 0rdination were being adopted, and those closer methods of co* oidmatmn have been made considerable found t!! 1 h \ aSt . y f ar ’ and havft been tound to work satisfactorily. If I mav quote from what the noble Lord, Lord Passfield said on that occasion, referring ^ Majesty’s Government, he said Pab' be rei; 1 understand that there has been an represeJ^ - L „ cea S f the Imam, that he is in some way or oikee. ther more am enable to the idea of aving a treaty, and undoubtedly he has ithdrawn all his forces from the Aden tectorate. That was my great charge the Colonial Office—that they onot ^° Wed SUC ^ a state °P affairs to subsist off br six or seven years. Our country was the ( Ut int0 a Very ig^minious position. I link it was worth while, in view of the atement by the noble Lord, Lord Pass- . eld, which I have already mentioned, j taking an attempt last May to bring the t-neral administration in the Near East 1 id Arabian matters into better order, ad I should be glad to know from His jesty’s Government if they are still ing to elucidate this problem, which, admit, is very complex, and whether e alter methods are now employed than the case two or three years ago.

Coloi abia, Lord to in' VUKU STRATHCONA and MOUNT not lit ML: My Lords, the noble Lord who ctb S r . a ^ sed ^bis Question has such a dis- i. nguished career behind him of service be a ^ nd ^ a ’ and suc b a profound knowledge conditions in Arabia and what is ,Called the Middle East, that I will l ‘| t attempt to follow him in all his 1 ^graphical discussions, but I will ieavour, as far as possible, to give him lirect answer to all the questions which Forei, has raised, whether they specifically ntioipe'ar in his Notice of Motion or not. ,t iiej e noble Lord refers in his Motion to id, ai' 1 debate which took place in this House is made ;U1 or g ani sation which 'one beW u ent n 01 l an ^ hin g that has gone be tore, and which, we think secures constant vigilance with regard to minor matters and the reservation of all issues of policy for the Cabinet as a whole.’’ It will obviously be impossible for me to enter into any further details as to that oiganisation, but I can assure the noble Lord that His Majesty’s Government are satisfied therewith, and do not feel that any further change in the existing arrangements is required for the moment. Ihe noble Lord went on to refer to the question of officials in Arabia and the Middle East generally, and I was not quite clear from what he said whether he was anxious to secure that only officials whose knowledge of Arabia was above suspicion should be posted there, or whether he was demanding a special service of officials to render administra tion in that area. But on the question of language I should like to inform him that, so far as I know, in all essential cases officials in Arabic-speaking countries have a knowledge of the local language— a principle which is followed in the Indian service and the Colonial Empire generally, wherever we are concerned with the administration of peoples speak ing another language. I need hardly ex plain that these officials have to go through an examination. The noble Lord referred to the question of Palestine and Transjordania. Officers of the Trans jordan frontier force are, within two years of their appointment, required to pass an Arabic language test, failure in which militates against an officer’s prospects of promotion and may result in the termination of his appointment. Lord LAMINGTON : Does that apply to the Colonial Office?213 Our Policy in the Middle East. 211 witTloLl regulations and that Mure to local ICBlAir*- . pass the examination may involve stop- page of promotion or. in the event of re peated failures, the termination of the official’s contract without compensation. In the Sudan political service, as the noble Lord mentioned, officials ha\ Jo qualify in Arabic also. The same applies, I think I may say, to all areas of a similar nature where a knowledge of the language is essential. I think it will be obvious that if what the noble Lord meant was the formation of a Middle East Service it would be im possible to contemplate that at the present time. Such a service would have a variety of functions to discharge diplomatic, administrative and advisory, and, failing the establishment of a single co-ordinating authority, would be subject to vicissitudes of control which could not fail to prejudice efficiency. As a matter of fact, the present arrangement by which the Foreign Office provide diplomatic and consular officers, the Colonial Office officers primarily for administration, and the Indian political service men for the peculiar advisory functions appropriate to the Persian Gulf, works well in prac tice and is free from many of the objec tions to which an amalgamated service would be open. The noble Lord has asked me about the Imam and whether there has lately been any trouble. The answer is that that area has been free from trouble for several years now, since 1928 or 1929, and our relations with the Imam show, I am informed, definite signs of estab lished improvement. I think that deals with most or all of the questions raised by the noble Lord. He will realise that there is really no change of any magni tude in the situation to report, since this Question was last raised in your Lord- ships’ House last year. I hope I have been able to satisfy him that His Majesty’s Government are convinced that the present system of administration and control is working well. Lord PQNSONBY of SHULBREDE : My Lords, I only rise to say that my (h IS ,«ei 3 s t0 I lie matter now [LORDS] noble friend Lord Passfield, who is sped- neally mentioned in the Motion, regrets very much that he is not able to present to-day, but I have had comniuQj cation with him.

I am not so familiar with , the matter now as I used to be, but one L : -vrald give a great many examples from lere L - me past where there was great difficulty ' ortaE,; -.because of the conflict between the ser- co ®piei;vices and also the Departments which :reiptia we re controlling them. I am very glad kmes, ato hear that has all passed away. It is leciaty, possible that there is not such strain and Me hi stress as there was five, six or seven dth tie years ago. As regards the general control of the Departments, what I understand is that (fho h we have more Departments mixed up in t, I lid! this matter than in regard to any other &gt;al of tiquarter of the world. I entirely agree, was. if I may say so, with my noble friend, e last -Lord Lamington, as to the solidarity of your l the Arab race and the extent to which ithod Kvarious difficulties in Palestine are ir froi watched all over that great Arabian to wkpeninsula in a way that is not always altenaslealised here. I recognise also that these any si Afferent Departments necessarily im- f what: »inge, as it were, upon the Arabian said v peninsula in many ways. But is the yarioii system—I am only asking the question so other a hat it may have consideration—as good ct—thalls could be devised? We are told that e very Afferent officials, I suppose from five or ficnltiesrfc Departments, meet together and [o not uettle matters day by day, and that tatters of policy are under the jurisdic- ion of the Cabinet. Matters of policy at are under the general jurisdiction the.Cabinet are really under nobody’s : the G urisdiction. It surely is much better hat there should be some one Minister pponsible for policy, and that all these uties and responsibilities should not be 7 hared generally by many different mem- ers of the Cabinet, all of whom have * -y reat responsibilities of their own. Would 111 not be better that one Department rbn? - muld, if possible, have the guiding re- 1 fusibility? leLorfl® worb r ' ff 111 *’ 6 understand that a great many stem, h® e P ar h inen ts have to be consulted—the table foreign Office, the India Office and so ^either'D- No one would deny their responsibi- stened ib n °b better to have one office ds, if,■ the Middle East. 216 which would have the general control? that one office would, of course, have to consult these other different offices, but would it not be better than having this diffused responsibility over six or seven different Departments. Such a system often ends in there being no general re- isponsibiltiy at all. I merely put forward the suggestion. I know the difficulties of selecting ^ any particular office for the work. We are at once told that the other offices have much more to do with it. One might suggest, for instance, the Foreign Office. The jurisdiction of the Foreign Office in these matters must be constantly increasing. That is so in the case of Iraq. I do not think we need go back to some ancient history about what the Foreign Office did in Somaliland. That is a very old story, and the Foreign Office has gained in ex perience since then. A reference was made to the Sudan administration, which, I am sure, is an extremely good adminis tration. That is shown by the fact that in the last few years I think not more than one or two questions have been asked in Parliament about the Sudan. You could not have a higher test of the success of an administration than that. I do not know whether the matter could be concentrated by giving it to the Foreign Office instead of having this generally diffused responsibility. It would be better in the times of stress that may be coming. Arabia is full of movements, full of activity, religious and otherwise, and there should be some con centration under one office, that office having consultations, if you like, with all the other offices that are concerned. Lord LAMINGTON: My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Peel for the general support he has given to the terms of my Motion, but he rather alarmed me when he said his experience of Government showed that when the Cabinet has decided on an issue of policy it means that there is no real responsi bility. Earl PEEL: May I interrupt the noble Lord ? I did not say that. I did not say when the Cabinet had decided the issue of policy. What I said was that when the Cabinet generally is charged with some question of responsi bility, and no specific Minister is re sponsible, then you have a general diffu sion which is not very successful.Bead passed. , r LORDS] Business of 17 r AMmrTON: General satisfac- Loe d when the noble tion was ve reiterated Lord, Lord aS 11 ^6 matters were assurances , to an d admims- very earefull^' ^ my noble friend who answered ^ ‘h e fve.^ a ' Tld S rup tr&gt; know how many officials ttt now deZg with the area in ^ In I do not suppose there are qUeS than twenty at most. In such a small Department the officers have little chance of promotion or of gaining knowledge outside their limited spheres of action. Surely it would be much better to extend their area of vision and have a Department from which men would have a chance of rising to high an responsible positions instead of being corn fined to a small area. One complaint of the present system is that it is so very minute. In such circumstances I do not see how you can get capable people to carry on the various forms of administra tion. I agree with the remark made by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, that we are wonderful people, and that- is perhaps the one justification of the present system. I have raised this Question once again in the hope that there will be an advance in the management of these minor affairs and responsibilities, and that His Majesty’s Government will carefully con sider whether something cannot be done to bring about a general improvement.

It wii.1 then be possible to suggest amendments or additions. Lord Pass field dealt with the question quite adequately on the occasion (Imy 20th, 1031) when a similar question was last debated in the House of Lords. On that occ aion Lord Trenehard raised the question, and his specific intention was to suggest the elimination of the Grcvcrnment of India from all Questions of policy in the Persian Gulf, Aden and Arabia generally. This he did, quite tactfully, having been warned of the danger of drawing too much publicity to the subject (for th© very reason that the more Indian opinion was interested in the Persian Gulf - a region which at present aces not attract much attention - the more difficult it would be to effect the end he had inview if it were eventually thought desirable )• On the present occasion, however, i i - is Lord Lamington, who is not at all opposed i-o the participation of the Coverawent of in 11 a and wcaxld not lilt* to see it eliminated (.»oc colam 13u5 of Hanaard of May 20th 1031). His line Is (and he has steadily ploughed it in the House of .oorda for years) that His Majesty's Government should have 'some co-ordinated authority' for dealing rithArab-apeaking peoples: the best departiaent he think* rould be the Foreign Office. He would even extend their scope to Aden Itself# But provided there is one co-ordim ted authority he would have free consultation in Whitehall and with the Governiae.nt of India# An argtuaent on these lines is easy to answer. The answer is that there a co-ordinated authority, the .virile Hast Sub - Coiarai t te e s of the 0*1. j., one ’Ministerial 1 and one 1 Official* (which the present Secretary of State took a hand in setting up)* All questions of major importance are dealt with as expeditiously as circumstances allow by this organisation, and as Lord ass field pointed out, decisions are taken not by this Office or that Office but by Hie I&amp;josty’s Government as a whole and by the Cabinet. ’This as a matter of fact was the answer that pretty well satisfied Lord frenchard, who regarded it as a vie finite -ledge that when India ai tains Dominion Status she will not be allowed to run the Persian Oulf (it would ) srdly have seenod necessary to seek a pledge on the point but this was the danger that lie evidently envisaged)# tDiere should rot therefor© be much trouble with Lord Trenchard on this occasion# The other danger is Lord Lloyd# Ai0 is anxious to ollitdm te India from the Gulf and Aden, but inclines to the view that the CpioniaJ, ££&amp;££ ako « 1&amp; ^ the oontrollinp d.partment (he is of course hardly likely to agree with Lord Lemlngton that, oving to the auoc sa of the foreign Office in dealing with %ypt and the Soudan they would he the best people).

Lamin^uon’s ques'bion deeply one may be permitted, to go iDack a little over historical ground doubtless familiar to their Lordships, especially to those who have been associated with Indian administration. An expedition occupied Aden in 1839. A settlement was founded and has ever since been treated as a part of British India, included for administrative purposes in the in x ,, Presidency of Bombay. The British Government naturally found it necessary to enter into relations, through the Resident, with the neighbouring Arab tribes, the area inhabited by whom , as delimited by the Anglo-Turkish frontier demarcation of 1905, is known as the Protectorate. luring the war the Turks threatened Aden and in 1917 for strategic reasons responsibilit for its defence was transferred from Indian Army Headquarters to the War Office, the control of political relations with the ident Protectorate tribes and the Yemen and msir?at the same time to the if the transferred to the Poreign Office (and subsequently to the ;orate.

It has also been necessary for most decisions to be taken by the Government of India, and delay has been caused by all the correspondence having to pass through Bombay. The result has been a certain loss, from time to time, of efficiency, for Y/hich the system has been to blame. The Secretary of State accordingly agrssd, on grounds purely of administrative and financial convenience, and on the advice of the two Indian Governments concerned, to the rtdSSion of the Government of Bombay from the picture. This stepwas in the best interests of Aden and of Bombay itself. For while it cannot but be painful to sever an administrative link which has held for nearly a century^ the commend and other ties between Bombay and Aden will continue unimpaired, while on the other hand a perpetuation of the old administrative system would certainly have meant financial loss to the t, +Vlp central Government could not have continued Presidency, since the oem;raj. w indefinitely the disbursement of Central monies on pro subjects (such as Education, Public Health, ) AsAs the Aden Settlement is legally part of British India, it is open tothe Governor-General in Council under Section 59 of the Government of India Act, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to constitute it, by notification a chief Commissionership (like Delhi, for instance,)under the direct control of the Government of India. This was done by a Notification published in a Gazette Extraordinary on 1st April, the’terms of which are as follows: 'In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 59 of the Government of India Act and with the approval of the Secretary of State for India, the Governor-General in Council is pleased to issue the following Proclamation:- PROCLAMATIOff.

There will he no change in the Judicial system, in which the High Court at Bombay will still exercise its functions.

'C 44V Attached is a short draft brief for answer y( to Lord Laiaington T s question about Aden, It is mainly a digest of the Memorandum issued last year by the Government of India of which a copy is also attached. The actual answer is simple enough, and Lord Laming ton as an ex-Governor of Bombay probably knows it quite well - or ought to. The real significance of the question is its juxtaposition to the 'old stager' about unification of control in the Middle East. It may well be that Lord Lamington, or if not he, some other Noble Lord, will use the recent change at Aden as a peg on which to hang a repetition of the suggestion that the wnole administration - civil, political and military - of Aden should oe vested in His Majesty’s Government as part of a general unification of control, and that the Settlement should cease to he in British India. The difficulty about dealing with such a suggestion is that it is impossible for a Government spokesman to take any line about it owing to the necessity of avoiding two pitfalls. (a) Scvlla. The Secretary of State is convinced that sooner or later Aden will have to be separated xrom India. Nothing must be said to prejudice the chances of such a step. (b) Gbarvbdis.

The recent transfer from Bombay to the Government of India was strongly opposed by the merchants and some politicians in Bombay, partly in the &amp;&amp;&amp;****&amp; 1 ^ - it was a first step towards the severance of Aden from India, and the '/iceroy, the Government of India and the Government of Bombay all gave specific assurances that this change was purely one of convenience and that no wider question was involved* It is suggested therefore that every care should be taken to avoid making any committal comment of any sort on the merits of the question of transfer to His Iviajesty T s Government, and that it would be useful to restate M here what has been said in India so thar. any remaining Indian suspicions may be lulled and Noble Lords made aware that they must reckon with Indian opinion before they take over Aden, if they wish to do so, wkiA-e at the same time no obstacle im interposed in the way of eventual transfer (such as an incautious statement now that the question can never be considered). The draft brief is conceived in this spirit. It might if so desired be used almost verbatim with the usual modest protestations and compliments prefixed (Lord Laming ton was of course Governor of Bombay 19E-1907 (resigned) and has taken a great interest in Arabian affairs in the House of Loras (e.g. debates of 23.6.26, 30.6.26, 5.7.27, 20.5.31) especially the Aden Protectorate and air relations with the Imam of San&amp;a). If by any chance he asks his usual question though it is not relevant - whether the Imam s torce*. still occupy part of the Protectorate and whether we are still failing in our obligations to the Protectorate chieftains, he can be reassured and informed that the Protectorate has been practically free of incursions for several years C ](since about 1928-9). and +hA+ nnv ^ 1 ^ 4 .. ^ tuia i:nax our relations with the , Imam show definite sisns o-f PQ + Q'hi t t, b ox es ^aolished improvement* But this is really a question for the Colonial Office.”' u 1C l: ^ lI ‘ 19.^ Laailn^ton's second questio n, about Mirmg iiiast unification. — i£ I have arranged with the Colonial Office and the i/i Foreign Office that whichever of them prepares the brief for Lord Hail sham (it is something of an argument for Lord Lamington that these two Offices cannot mahe up their minds which of them is to draft the brief!) will let us see it before submission* It will then be possible to suggest amendments or additions. Lord Pass field dealt with the quite adequately on the occasion (May 20th, 1931) when a similar question was last debated in the House of Lords. On that occasion Lord Trenchard raised the question, and his specific intention was to suggest the elimination of the Government of India from all questions of policy in the Persian Gulf, Aden and Arabia generally. This he did. wilt quite tactfully, having been warned of the danger of A drawing too much publicity to the subject (for the very reason that the more Indian opinion was interested in the Persian Gulf - a region which at present dee s not attract much attention - the more difficult it would be to efiect the end he had ii^riew if it were eventually thought desirable)• On the present occasion, however, it is Lord Lamington, who is not at all opposed to the participation of the Government of India and would not like it eliminated (see column 1305 of Hansard of May 20th His line is (and he has steadily ploughed it in Lords for years) that His Majesty's Government to see y 1931). the House of should have 'some co-ordinated authority' for dealing withI,Arab-speaking peoples: the best department he thinks would be the Foreign Office. He would even extend their scope to Aden itself. But provided there is one co-ordinated authority he would have free consult at ion in Whitehall and with the Government of India. An argument on these lines is easy to answer. The answer is that there is, a co-ordinated authority, the tz. Middle East Sub-Committees of the C.I.D. , one 1 Mnis terial* and one ’Official* flttaifrirdt* ^ ir? All questions of major .mportance are dealt with as expeditiously as circumstances illow by this organisation, and as Lord Passfield pointed mt, decisions are taken not by this Office or that Office mt by Eis AIa.iesty l s Government as a whole and by the Cabinet. This as a matter of fact was the answer that pretty well satisfied Lord Trenchard, who regarded it as a iefinite pledge that when India attains Dominion Status she Nill not be allowed to run the Persian Gulf (it would b-ardly have seemed necessary to seek a pledge on the point but this was the danger that he evidently envisaged). There should not therefore be much trouble with Lord Trenchard on this occasion. The other danger is Lord Lloyd. He is anxious to eliminate India from the Gulf and Aden, but inclines to the view that the ColonlalJ^oe should the controlling department (he is of course hardly likely to agree with Lord Lamington that owing to the success of the Foreign Office in dealing with Egypt and the Soudan they would be the best people). But one might hope that ^ Lord Hailsham would be able successfully to drive a wedge between the very divergent views of the Lords Lloyd and i . -Hnot the middle course taken by the Lamineton and show that . +v vp.t It Should not be difficult for Government is the best. the/the department concerned to produce a brief for him, as it need only follow the lines of that given to Lord Passfield* So far as the India Office is concerned, Mr.Laithwaite 1 s admirable notes of last May (flagged) still represent tte position. It will no doubt be necessary to overhaul the question of the Government of India’s external responsibilities as India approaches full self-government: but for the present at least there is presumably no questicn of n transferring” Foreign Affairs; Indian Muslim interests in Arabia and the Persian Gulf are substantial, history and tradition cannot go for nothing, the ties of commerce are strong between India and Aden and the Persian Gulf, and the Air Boute down the Gulf is of vital importance to India’s communications. At any rate for the present, it seems impossible to consider cutting out the Government of IndM entirely, and the existing Middle East system provides admirably for full consultation. It may sometimes mean that one 'misses the ’bus', hut at least it diminishes the ^fifnrrpr of getting into the Y/rong one# I submit (a) a draft brief for Lord Strathoona, (b) that we wait for a draft brief before considering Lord Hailsham's part of the Question.&amp; In order to answer Lord Lanington's question clearly one may Toe permitted to go Lack a little over historical ground doubtless familiar to their Lordships, especially to those who have been associated with Indian administration. A settlement An expedition occupied Aden in 1839. t ** was founded and has ever since beerHa part^of British India, included ; in the Presi A- Presidency of Bombay. 01 uhe/C The/Government eiU naturally found it necessary to enter into relations, through the Resident, with the neighbouring Arab tribes, t O/Ljxx Ly. these . were-f-crmally in c orprgrat^d&gt; by the Anglo-Turkish frontier demarcation of 1905, in what ll hafr--e4«r^~-l^eeja rv known as the Protectorate. During the war the Turks tnreatened Aden and in 1917 for strategic reasons its defence was transferred frcm Indian Anpy Headquarters to the War Office, was as follows:- First, the Settlement, itself, of about 75 square^ / x ■h-v'hour and immediate neighbournood) miles, (i.e. tne town., haroour, - were/were to remain nart of Briti» - h ^ * ltlSa Indla * /? B embay Eresiden oy Secondly, ^lltical_a nd Military controlwas to be primarily in tne hands of the Colonial Office. Thirdly, Defence organisation was to be in the hands of the Air Ministry. The Resident and Commander-in-chief was to be the head ox tne Administration, being the servant of His Majesty's Government in London in respect of political and military matters. In respect of the civil administration of the settlement, he was to continue to be the servant of the Government of India and the Government of Bombay* h ^ (hlc»v* Cfcvt' S In regard to Bxpendi'turey the )Tg. Q-eegm«y^b ear $ the whole military and political cost except for a contribution from Indian Revenues amounting to £150,000 or l/3rd of the total, whichever is less. The cost of the civil administration divided between the Government - pf TOiigr aiid LTT5 GdTdrnrTehfiyf B«wlasgK, witty a contribution of £8,000 from the- towards the Police force. This is a very brief sketch of the Aden administrative arrangements which have now been modified in one particular. It should be stated at once that the modification is confined exclusively to the Civil s ide of the Administration, i.e. to the arrangements for running the town and settlement itself, the few square miles of Arabia which are British India.— ^ fc 3. U&amp; r a *\ -tU c^tu n- M. ^ ^ ^ sTt; Serious difficulties have arisen over tne admimstra tion. The settlement is an expensive place to run, and tne importance of its geographical situation makes it essential to keep up a high standard. Civil expenditure has been divided in the usual Indian manner between 'Central” and But the division though workable in an ordinary/ ”Pr ovine ial”.ordinary Indian district, has involved much inconvenience in the case of Aden. The administration of the Police, for instance, is properly a Provincial charge, hut owing to the peculiar situation of Aden it has assumed a wider importance and it has been necessary in the past for the Besident to obtain the approval, on accasion, ofthree different bodies, the G over mien t of Bombay, the Government of India, and the Colonial Office, before necessary expenditure could be incurred. Moreover, seme confusion and a great deal of correspondence has been caused by the fact that the Government of India has been compelled to meet from central funds expenditure which should properly fall on provincial funds. owing to the inability of the Government of Bombay to spend what would have been a disproportionate amount on a very small portion of its territory. It has also been necessary for most QS\Ar decisions to be taken by the Government of India, delay has been caused by all the correspondence having to pass throgh Bombay. The result has been a certain loss, from time to time, of t-Mpei—and' efficiency, for which nobody but-the system has been to blame. The Secretary of State accordingly decided on grounds purely of administrative and financial convenience, and on the fa ^ ^ i- advice of the Indian Governments concerned, to eliminate./the Government of Bombay from the picture. This step was in the best interests of Aden and of Bombay itself. £ or wnile it cannot but be painful to sever an administrative link which has held for nearly a century, the commercial and other ties between Bombay and Aden will continue unimpaired, wnile on the other hand a perpetuation of the old administrative system would certaanly have meant financial lOoS to Presidency, since the Central Government could not nave continued indefinitely the disbursement of Central/as Education, Central monies on provincial subjects (such Public Health, etc.) As the Aden Settlement is^British India, it is open to the Governor General in Council under Section 59 of the Government of India Act, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to constitute it, by notification, a Chief Commissi oner ship (like Delhi, for instance) under the direct control of the Government of India. This was done by a ITotification published in a Gazette Extraordinary on 1st April, the terms of which are as follow: In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 59 of the Government of India Act and with the approval of the Secretary of State for India, the Governor-General in Council is pleased to issue the following Proclamation:- PHOCLAKATIOH. The following territory which is now included within the Presidency of Bombay, namely:- the settlement of Aden and such of its dependencies for the time being, inclusive of the villages of Sheikh Othman, Imad and Iswa, the Island of Perim and Little Aden, as are administered by the Government 0 f Bombay, shall, on and from the first day of April 19o2, oe taken under the immediate authority and management of the Governor- General of India in Council and formed into a Chief Comis si on er ship of Aden; and Lieutenant Colonel B.R.Beilly,. C.I .n*, 0«B ,E., Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden, is hereby appointed to be the Chief Com issioner of Aden, with effect in the relations between In. i TOiitehall nor in the It will be observed that no change whatever is i inclusion/It will • IMUl111 be obvious that this administrative change has no bearing upon the second question which stands in tne name of «a* lord Lamington. ^Te may have dealt with the two together, but lord Strathoona's responsibility ends with the firstjT’ rj:lis second question is altogether a wider question, out as they have been placed side hy side, it is perhaps desirable to utter a word of warning. it would be the greatest mistake to suppose that this administrative Qhano- migfit Lc used--e-s-,—s-a~-- the thin end of the Imperial wedge, with a view to the ultimate transfer of Aden to the Heme Government. There is no connection of any kind between the two questions, and in answering suspicions felt on this head in India and voiced by a distinguished deputation, His Excellency the Viceroy and the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India stated that no such suggestion had been considered in connection with the present proposal, which was complete in itself and made on its own merits. If the question of transfer to His Majesty 1 s Government should arise again in future, it would have to be considered on its merits, and would be rendered in no way either easier or more difficult by the present proposal. Ho one could say ths.t the question would never be raised again, but the deputation was assured that the present transfer had not that end in view. If the proposal to transfer to His Majesty’s eo/er rnent were raised again, Mr. Howell made it clear tnat the Government of India were bound by pg^t assurances that full opportunities for discussion would be given. This is taken from the published account of the reception of a deputation by the Viceroy on November 30th last, and the undertaking given is.of course binding. It would/would be impossible for His Majesty, s Goverment to consider the assumption of responsibility for the civil administration of Aden (even if they were prepared to foot the bill) without ample opportunity being given for consultation with^ndian interests concerned.f erence Paper.

I have asked Lord Hailsham's Private Secretary to let the India Office see a copy of Lord Hail sham ! s Brief before it is finally approved, but you no doubt have means of arranging with the Colonial Office and Foreign Office that the India Office is consulted before the Brief is submitted to Lord Hailsham. It occurs to me that under the very elastic procedure in the House of Lords, Lord Lamington may put his Questions together in one speech. This need not in itself prevent two Government speeches being made in reply. Could you let me have a Brief about Aden for Lord strathcona ?Mth April 1332. Dear Lord Strathcona: You will no doubt have seen that Lord Lamlngton has two questions down on the Order Paper of the House of Lords for the 27th April. (1) To ask: for information as to the recent changes made in the Administration of Aden. (2) To ask His Majesty’s Grovernment whether the desirability of having the affairs of the Arabic-speaking peoples of Arabia, Sgypt and the Sudan dealt with by one Government Office has been considered. I understand that Lord Hailsham proposes to answer the second question hirnseli. He has asken if you will be good enough to answer the first Question about Aden.Lord Kailskam decides ,*hat line to take in reoly to the second question. As regards Aden, the position briefly is that the ITqwii and ^ettleiiient of Aden, which w€®&lt; previously a part ol the Bosbay Presidency, haff$now been taken under the direct administration of the Government of India and the fieaident has become a Chief Commissioner.

It was proposed to create a Cl Commissionership under the direct control of the Government of India, As a consequence of this, the revenues which the Bombay Government ^ received at present from Aden, and the expenditure which they incurred 1^ would be transferred to the Central budget, as would be. seen from Appen dix I. The expenditure which would thus be taken over in the year 1982-33 was expected to be Pis. 5,16,200 yhich would be more than set off by revenue amounting to Bs. 6,30,000. A saving of Bs. 1,13,800 including Rs. 11,000 on account of emergency cut in pay would accrue in 1932-33. Besides this, a saving of Bs. 37,000 would accrue under “Expenditure in England”. The revenue of Bs. 6,30,000 included a sum of Rs. 63,000 on 'account of “XVI Interest”. The Government of India would have to re-imburse the balance of the loan due from the Aden Settlement to the Bombay Government, the amount being gradually recovered from the Settlement. The approval of the Standing Finance Committee was re quested to the transfer of the expenditure now borne by the Provincial Government as well as the revenue to the Central budget. The Com- mittee agreed. id of Supef' Finance Department. 5. The Committee then took up the remaining points in the statement laid before it on the 23rd January 1932 by the Finance Department about the action taken on the suggestions made by it and as regards some of the proposals laid before it during its previous sessions, and wished to be informed of the present position as regards items 20 and 60 in that state ment.

This expert evidence was given at the hearing to-day by Lieut.-Com- mander G. S. Miskin, R.I.M., Ship Surveyor to the Government. In his report, submitted after an inquiry into the cause of the explo sion, which he produced in court, Lieut.-Commander Miskin explained to the. jury the cause of the explosion. He said that the explosion was due to the failure of the stop valve chest on the boiler, it being not strong enough ‘Men working on the boiler” he added “could not possibly have de tected the defect.” The jury accepted his evidence, and returned a verdict of acci dental death.

March at Opera House. “Isle of Dreams” is a three-act musical comedy, not a musical revue or a conglomeration of con certed items,—with a cast of 50, in cluding a chorus of 40 and eight specially selected dancing girls. The idea is to give the Bombay public new and up-to-date music and sparkling comedy. The story deals with a foreigner who happens to be King of a Cannibal Island. This King is also the owner of a fashionable restaurant in London and he divides his time between the two places. The second act is the restaurant scene where some real snappy cabaret items will be introduced, assisted by the famous Bootleggers’ Band on the stage.

The idea is to give the Bombay public new and up-to-date music and sparkling comedy. The story deals with a foreigner who happens to be King of a Cannibal Island. This King is also the owner of a fashionable restaurant in London and he divides his time between the two places. The second act is the restaurant scene where some real snappy cabaret items will be introduced, assisted by the famous Bootleggers’ Band on the stage.

Several new song numbers which are sure to “catch on” will be speciallly featured.

Letter from the Government of Bombay, No. 5997-A, dated the 15th February 1932. uce 1 am directed by the Governor in Council to refer to the correspondence pndino with your express letter No. F.-592-N./31, dated the 9th January r i oq 9 °in which the Government of Bombay were asked to submit official 1 nosals for the transfer of control over the Civil Administration of the Aden Settlement from them to the Government of India. 2 I am in this connection to invite a reference to my letter No. 5997-C., dated the 9th June 1931, in which the Government of Bombay’s acceptance of The nronosal to place Aden in charge of a Chief Commissioner ander the direct control of the Government of India and also of the proposal that they should simnlv in future to the same extent as at present the officers and the per sonnel required for the Civil Administration, was communicated to the Government of India. 3 I am now to give details as regards the gazetted and non-gazetted establishment supplied by the Government of Bombay for service m Aden. The following gazetted officers who are borne on the Bombay Cadre of their respective services are at present supplied for service in Aden (1) The Judicial Asdstant, an Officer of the I.C.S.

I am to enclose two statements showing (1) Government buildings at Aden constructed entirely from Provincial revenues and their book value and (2) Government buildings at Aden partly constructed from Provincial revenues and amount expended by the Government of Bombay for their construction. The years in which these buildings were constructed are also shown in the statements. It will be seen that the total expenditure incurred by the Government of Bombay amounts to Bs. 9,18,108. Of this, the sum of Rs. 4,00,513 is in respect of buildings constructed after 1920-21, i.e., after the introduction of the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. Now that the transfer of Aden has finally been decided upon, the Government of Bombay consider that they are entitled to claim a refund of the amount expended by them on the construction of Government build ings at Aden at their cost or at least of the expenditure incurred since 1920-21. I am accordingly to request that while issuing orders on the proposed transfer of control, the Government of India may be moved to pass orders accepting the Government of Bombay’s claim for the refund. 5. As regards the manner in which the transfer should be effected the Governor in Council suggests that the Governor-General in Council should issue a proclamation under the Government of India Act creating Aden as a Chief Commissionership, followed by an Enactment of Aden Laws, similar to the “ Delhi Laws ” XIII of 1912. By this new Enactment the powers of the Local Government under the various Acts in force in Aden should be delegated to the Chief Commissioner with the proviso that the Government of India may by notification in the Gazette of India direct that any power ^ ^/conferred or imposed on the Local Government under anv Enactment should be exercised by the Governor-General in Councilor by' some other authority not the Chief Commissioner. The Government of India should then by notification reserve to themselves certain powers of the local Govem- ri 11 ^ Ce u am r&gt; A&lt; ^ S as a PP ear immediately necessary.

P.489-H/31 of the 18th November 1931, in which you asked me to submit a drafo ol the statement which X had suggested in my letter of the 17th October 19 31 in order to explain more clearly the actual effects of the proposed transfer I no longer think that such a statement is immediately desirable as there has been no further agitation or public discussion of the subject here since the deputation from Bombay waited on the Viceroy in December, -i-t has generally been asumed from His Excell ency's reply to the deputation that the change is inevitable, and (as was anticipated) this has had the effect of putting a stop to the attests of the local Indian community to prevent it. The issue of a Government statement now might produce an unnecessary renewal of the controversy. I still think, however, that a further explanatory statement would be useful when a decision about the transter is announced. A very short and simple one should be sufficient for issue to the public here, and I suggest that it should take the form of the draft which I enclose. Yours sincerely. Sd. B.R.Heilly To Sir.

LetterEl' Ml It hag been decided to separate Aden from the Presidency of Bombay and to form it into a Chief Commissionerghip under the direct control of the Govern ment of India. The reasons for this change are administrative and financial. Hitherto the control of Aden has been divided between the Provincial Government oi Bombay and the Central Government at Delhi, some departments of administration being managed and financed by the one, and some by the other Government, and all official correspondence with the Government of India has necessarily passed through the Government of Bombay. Txiis has resulted in inconvenience and delay without any compensating advantages. The concentration of administrative control and financial responsibility in the Government of India is calculated to simplify greatly the work of administration. As a Chief Commissi one rsh ip Aden will have the status of a minor local Government, and the Resident will be vested with some of the powers which had hitherto been reserved to the local Governnent in Bombay. There will be no change in the judicial system which now prevails, and the High Court of Bombay will continue to exercise the same functions with regard to Aden as it has hitherto. Hor will the commercial or business interests of the place be affected in any 't&amp;y by the change, which is one of administrative and and financial convenience, and vhich is not intended to involve any larger issues. li: V.VVD.O.lfe* 599?-A.

The reply to clause (L) of Mr. Surve ’ s question was suggested by the Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden, and I now find that it was not accurate. The figure of Rs. 1,49,000 as pointed out by the Government of India represents the approximate extra cost on account of the permanent Armed Police Porce towards which the Goverrjaent of Bombay contribute nothing, as their liability is limited to the cost of the unarmed Civil Police Porce which according to the Keily Scheme is estimated at Rs. 2,26,900.

Starred Questions and Answers 106 to the Government of India. The memorandum prepared by the Government of Bombay attempts to make out that there will be probable loss of about Rs. 2 lakhs accruing to the Government of Bombay, if Aden continues under their jurisdiction. It is clear that Aden up to now has not been a cause of any monetary loss. It is observed, however, that certain items which are at present charged to the Government of India will be charged to the Government of Bombay, if the latter continue tn administer that Port. My Committee trust that it is not suggested it any district, which threatens to be a source of financial loss, should for that reason alone be separated from the Presidency proper and trans ferred to the jurisdiction of either the Central Government or any other Provincial Government. If the items of expenditure which are at present legitimately debited to the Government of India, are to e transferred to the accounts of the Government of Bombay, as a result of their continued responsibility for Aden, it can be claimed that t re income, which is at present being derived from the Salt pans by tie Government of India, should go to the Government of Bombay, an ' ns mil serve to set off any loss thatjnight occur. My Committee are not aware if the Government of Bombay hove in view any other factors which will justify the proposed trans ex esic e» the financial factor. All the factors, so far as . my Committee can ]u ge, are rather in favour of continuing the administration of Aden itn-er the Government of Bombay, and not transferring it to the Go\ e rumen of India.

The registration of documents for properties in Aden are permissible to be registered in Bombay, which is a very great convenience. It is an easy matter for the head offices in Bombay to approach the Bombay Legislative councillors in case they have any grievances regarding the Aden administration. The trade of Aden with India is chiefly from Bombay and Karachi. (1) On considering the memorandum they are of opinion that the Armed Police Force is for the defence of Aden and that the expendi ture on that account should be wholly borne by the Colonial or the Central Government. (2) The Kailway at Aden was first introduced as a War measure, to facilitate the transfer of troops and stores to the Military Frontier at Sheikh Othman and was since worked at a heavy loss and the public is of opinion that the heavy deficit on this account might have been included in the Central Government’s Budget and they consider that the loss on that account should be borne by the Military. Moreover, it is no longer an item of recurring expense, as the railway is out of commission. (3) The contribution from India towards the Military expense of Aden was £.250,000 for the first three years since 1927 and after that the expense would be curtailed to £.150,000 which will show considerable reduction on the debit side in the Central Government’s Budget. (4) The public of Aden are apprehensive that the transfer of Aden to the Central Government means a first step towards handing it over to the Colonial Government which would be detrimental to the interest of the Oriental races. (5) According to the report of the Simon Commission the Bombay Province is to get an autonomy and the public of Aden are of opinion that in that case Aden should not be severed from Bombay, as they are looking forward to representation on the local bodies, as well as Provincial and Central Legislature. I am sure you will agree with us that the above five points raised by us will meet with your approval and kind consideration, as we do not like to be in the same position as one of the non-regulation Provinces like the North Western Frontier or Baluchistan.1% 'e Hb., S Mip Ixl® ranifi i,as itofW 1 Dec. 1931] Starred Question* and Answer A memorial from the public of Aden ventilating their views on the above points is being drafted and addressed to the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, which will be forwarded in due course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) FRAME OZ H. C. Dlls SHAW. NOTE. Provincial Autonomy being a foregone conclusion it is definitely to the advantage of all shades of inhabitants of Aden that Aden be kept under the autonomous Bombay Presidency because it will take time for the Central Government to assume a thoroughly popular form. Aden under the Central Government cannot and should not in any case expect a treatment better than that which is meted out to the non-Regulation Provinces of the type of North Western Frontier Provinces and Baluchistan. The fact that the people in these Provinces have few rights and privileges is too well known to need repetition. The Arabs, Jew-s and the Somalis may be m preponderance, but the fact cannot be denied that the Indians were the pioneers who made Aden what it is to-day. Aden hinterland has by their efforts become the chief or the only market for Indian piecegoods and Indian grains, and as it was India with whose money the deficit balances in the past were met the Indians are entitled to demand that this trade with the hinter land may not suffer. But it shall suffer if Aden were to be transferred to the Government of India because with curtailment of freedom as in the non-Regulation Provinces, Aden will not be a very tempting place for Indian merchants to remain in. Shipping trade and the great salt industry of Aden are in the hands of the Bombay people to a large extent, and their interests are inter woven with Bombay. There are many parts of Bombay Presidency that are not self- supporting, but that is not a plea for snatching those portions away from the Bombay Government. If the land revenue of the salt pans were to go to the Bombay Government, just as the revenue of the salt pans of Matunga, Ghatkopar, Bhandup and other places goes to it, then the little deficit that is being made so much of will disappear. Therefore, I am of opinion that it is beneficial for all communities that the Bombay connection be retained.

I do not, owever, wish the Government of India to make amy assumption as o Aden continuing to remain a permanent part of Indian admin- stration. It seems to me that Aden would not fit at all into ndian Provincial Autonomy or All India Federation. Moreover, s the Government of India becomes more autonomous, so it seems o me important to extricate from its scope interests of a pre- ominantly Imperial character^ The proposed political changes n India will inevitably mean a much closer investigation into l ae question of Indian responsibilities both at Aden and in the ersian Gulf. Speaking generally, I take the view that where iese interests are predominantly Imperial and not local they should - withdrawn from the purview of the Indian Government. 3.2.32.r ^ J V'U Minute Paper, — \ /!* V ^»*»£tw r ^ &lt;j 'a *&gt; ( ) 0 L&lt; •' 1952 Department. xhe stage is now almost set for the transfer of Aden Iran the Government of Bombay to the Government of India. we have still to hear that Sir George Schuster is satisfied as to the financial implications, but it is unnecessary to delay submission on that account. ihere is no question that from the administrative point of view the change is most desirable and long overdue. The doubts which have been felt m the past as to the desirability of the change are twofold. (1) the danger that the change may be contrary to the wishes of the majority of the public in Bombay and Aden. (2) the probable difficulty of fitting Aden as a Chief Commissi oner ship into the federal scheme and thejquestion whether complete separation trom India will not prove the only solution. A (1) It is possible to gauge with some certainty the extent of opposition to transfer. (a) In Bombay . It is undoubtedly the case that there is considerable opposition among the mercantile community in Bombay. This opposition is partly sentimental, based on the 90 - year association of Aden with Bombay, partly due to fear that the proposed transfer is a first step to complete severance xrcm India, and partly due to a kind of feeling that the merchants who have built up businesses in Aden should be entitled to dictate policy in regard to it and have not in fact been allowed to do so. No reasonable groups appear to exist for the opposition: the arguments of the merchaats are surprised in the press report of the deputation which tne Viceroy received/ 3000 8 31i\ Pap' received on the 30 th November (pages 5 - 7 of the papers now submitted) and in spite of Mr. Howell's and the Viceroy's answers (pages 8 - 11) the deputation remained unconvinced. Th-it the niei chants are not likely to be convinced by any arguments and that they represent only a small section of Bombay opinion is shown by the Government of Bombay Political Secretary's letter of 13th October (flagged X). P.Z. 6948/31 P.Z.7546/31 /fd, ^ t It (b) In Aden . Fran the Residents letter of the 17th October already submitted, and from his letter of 31st October (page 27 of papers now submitted) it is clear that while the Indian merchants in Aden are opposed to the change (the Indians are lc$&gt; of the population) the Arabs (65%) are on the whole either indifferent or in favour, the small opposition among Arab merchants being d.ue to mistaken fear that transfer may be a step towards further transfer to the Colonial Office and that transfer to tne G-overnment of India would involve the discontinuance of right of appeal to the Bombay High Court. Other communities in Aden show no particular interest in the proposal, Fran tne point of view, therefore, of public opinion, the forces of opposition, based as they are on no reasonable grounds, camot outweigh the administrative and financial advantages of the transfer as set forth in the memorandum laid before the Legislatures at Delhi and Banbay and ^blished in India uony flagged and Aden, and there has been ample ooportunity for ( P - 2 ' 692b7S1) those concerned to lay their views before Goveranent.

The Secretary of State is practically committed, by his approval of the steps taken so far, to approving the transfer and it has been made quite clear during the public discussions in India that transfer to the Government of India would in no way prejudice or affect any question that might subsequently arise of transfer to the Colonial Gi f ice. Under the orders proposed to be passed Aden would become a Chief Commissi oner ship, and presumably the Resident and Coranander-in-Chief would have to as it took some discussion with the Colonial Office (who wanted to call him Governor) before the present There are no Chief Corarnissioners and as alternate Residents title was agreed to. % in the Colonial Service are drawn fran that service it may be necessary to give the unfortunate officer a triple title of 'Resident, Chief Ccmmissioner and Commander-in-Chief' The Government of India may have scrae suggestion to t » m A j *,, j ^1 make on this. As/f As regards conditions of service, precedence etc, it seems that no change is likely to be necessary. The Resident and Commander-in-Chief was given a special place in the table of precedence and his general position was assimilated to that of Commissioner in Sind. It is presumed that the conditions of service of a Chief Commissioner can be fixed in accordance with the circumstances of the individual case and that in effect there need be no change except in the matter of title. The questions involved in the transfer of financial responsibility can no doubt be left to tne Government of India and the Government of Bombay to settle between themselves. While we are waiting to know that Sir George Schuster concurs m the decision of his colleagues, it might be as well to ascertain more exactly from the Government of India whether they envisage any change in the practical position of the Resident except that he will no longer have to report to the Government of India through the Government of Bombay. A draft express letter to the Government of India is submitted. Below is also a letter from Mr. Cavell to Mr. I Laithwaite dated 28th November about the general question of Aden s future. It does not seem to need any reply present, as the transfer to the Government of India is now to be made, and no question can arise for some time at any rate of any further transfer. The C.O. will have seen from the papers (of which they have had copies,) that it has been very definitely stated that the present proposal is not in any way a preparation transfer to His Majesty’s Government and that the fuileat opportunities .ill * sl „» f „, dl , ou „ io „ India before such a step is taken. :Y So/Paper. Department. So far as the Colonial Office is concerned, it nay be assumed that they will raise no objection to the Government of India*s proposal. From informal conversation with them I gather that they are not likely to be anything but pleased to eliminate the Government of Bombay: they would of course wish to consider any proposal that might be made to increase the Resident*s pay #ien he becomes a Chief Commissioner and is an Indian Service man - as they pay half. They would also wish to have a word in deciding any change of title. Otherwise they are not really concerned, so long as in practice the change does not affect the position of the Resident vis-a-vis the home government.

KALE (Bombay University) : There are certain questions with reference to the transfer of Aden which have not been answered. Further, I have placed in your hands, Sir, an adjournment motion. I do not know whether you have decided to allow it or not. The Honourable the PRESIDENT : Honourable members probably have not been able to follow the honourable member Rao Bahadur Kale. The honourable member Mr. Surve from Bombay has tabled a few questions on the subject of Aden being transferred to the control of the Government of India. Those questions have not been answered yet-— I do not suppose the office has received the replies from the Honourab e Member in charge, possibly for a very good reason that communications must have gone to Aden or whatever the reason may be. However, m view of the importance of the question of the transfer of Aden and m view of certain questions being asked in the Council of State and answered very lately after we have been sitting, the honourable member Rao Bahadur Kale has placed an adjournment motion in my hams 1S MO Hb 125—3526 [The President] Transfer of Aden 17 Oct. Iiit E. R morning which I have not been able to accept as one that I could allow. 1 I will be able to tell him tomorrow, he has got to obtain my consent to it first in the office and then move it. That is why he did not move it after question time this morning. I will be able to give him a definite sisMt withii reply by tomorrow morning. In the meanwhile, the honourable member wishes to ask whether the Honourable the Leader of the House is in position to make any statement in connection with the transfer of A ’ If that can be done, the adjournment motion may drop out. The Honourable Sir GHULAM HUSSAIN : I am not, Sir. I have Lis been taken by surprise by this motion. The honourable member ought to have reahsed that it is not within the competence of this Government t j to decide the question of Aden. Therefore, the motion cannot lie in this ] e Council. Besides that, how can I make a statement without consulting the whole of the Government ? Rao Bahadur R. R. KALE : May I just point out to the the Leader of the House that the object is not to touch the Government of India at all ? The fact is that certain replies were given in the Council of State towards the end of last month. Though, I under stand, some associations and commercial bodies in Bombay wired to the | Bombay Government asking them whether they had given their consent to this transfer, they have not yet received any replies to those wires one way or the other. From the replies given in the past in this behalf, they think that the Bombay Government would have liked to consult some of the bodies and persons concerned and interested in this question before they (the Government) would submit their recommendations to the Government of India. The complaint of these bodies and persons is that they were never consulted and consequently they sent in the wires to the Bombay Government when they heard from the answers given in the Council of State that the transfer would take place soon. They are, therefore, anxious to know whether Government really cared to take into account any representations from these bodies and whether they g ave them an opportunity, or whether the Government has merely acted on its own responsibility without consulting the associations and bodies concerned in this Aden matter. That was the point, as well as the non- receipt of replies to the questions tabled by my honourable friend to my right (Mr. A. N. Surve) with regard to this very matter based upon the answer that was given in August last eSn tec not jet] letl toinorro\ The Honourable Sir GHULAM HUSSAIN : We had given full replies and I was surprised that no honourable member took any interest w the question, and I cannot say why they are doing it now. So much time elapsed, but not a single question was sent, and I am afraid t e honourable member opposite (Mr. A. N. Surve) also sent his questions v ery late ; I got them yesterday myself, and I understand d' 0111 my Secretary that the questions were received by him only one or two days back, and when we have to give replies, the whole Cabinet as consider the matter. toimv moti n 7 Oct. 1931] Transfer of Aden 527 Rao Bahadur R.

In asking this question I was discharging my duty which I owe to my constituency.

Yours sincerely. LAITHWAITE, ESQ.ffiMT'OP INDIA. ,rhe Residency, Aden, ?,8th October, 1931. My dear Cowell, I enclose copies of a d.ou letter from Hcwell - (foreign secretary to the Government of India) on the | subject of the proposed transfer of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the direct control of the Government of India, and of my reply. I do not, of course, know what the new Indian constitution will be, but it is generally assumed that provincial autonomy will be granted, and, if so, the administration of the Bombay Presidency will be Indianised. In that case it would obviously be wrong for a predominantly Arab town with the Imperial and strategic value of Aden to continue to be included in it. If the Central Government of India becomes entirely responsible to an Indian elected body Aden should, in my opinion, be severed from India completely, and should be placed under the Colonial Office, but I am assuming that this will not be the case in the immediate future. Aden is a small place, and I am rather afraid that the importance of this issue to its future and to Imperial interests may be overlooked when larger problems are under consideration. I trust that this will not happen. Yours sincerely, fK (Bgd) BbR » Reilly. 3. COWELL, E3a., C.M.G., Colonial Office, London.The Residency, Men, 17th October, 1931. My dear Howell, I returned to Aden on the 4th of this month, and Wightwick has passed me your D.O. letter (R.489-N/31) on the subject of the transfer of Aden to the Central Oovernment. 3. You have asked:- (l) What people in Aden think. (k) Whether they are capable of giving expression to their opinions. (3) Is it necessary that only the opinion of the Indian population should be considered. (4) Are there Somali and Arab merchants who have views on the subject. (5) What (if anything) I propose to do. 3. With regard to (l), we must remember who the people of Aden actually are. According to this year’s census the population is made up as follows 1,145 29,820 3,935 7,287 4,120 331 iSurpopeans Arabs_ Somalis Indians Jews Miscellaneous 46,638 4. Of these the Indians alone appear to have any strong views about the transfer, and under the Icaderonip of the Cowasji Dinshaws they have passed resolutions against the change. They are drawn mainly from Bombay, Gujerat and Kathiawar, and this naturally leads them to favour continued connection with the Bombay Presidency. Their leaders, the Cowasji Dinshaws and the Laljis, hope to gain an increased influence if Aden forms part of an autonomousautonomous Indian province, which they expect Bombay to become under the new constitution. ilio xrabs on the whole are indifferent, although some of the 1 Baling members of the community who visited me this weex told me that they ha.d been disturbed by suggestions that the transfer to the Central Government is only a step towards administration by the Colonial Office, under which they fear that Aden might cease to be a free port. As far as I know this is an entirely groundless apprehension and I have told them so. They said that il they were assure! that the change was not intended to pave the way to the imposition of a Customs tariff which, in their opinion, would ruin the port, they would be in favour of direct control by the Central Government of India or by the Colonial Office, and one or two of them referred to Singapore and HongKong as places whose conditions are similar to those of Aden and in which Colonial Office administration is successful and popular. They explained that, as far as the Arabs are concerned, the local distrust of Government under the Colonial Office is based on their acquaintance with the neighbouring Colony of British Somaliland, in which there is a burdensome tariff on imports. They also toJd me that it had been alleged that the transfer from Bombay would involve the discontinuance of the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court, and would give the Viceroy a right to transfer Aden to the Colonial Office at any moment that he wished. I told them that there was no foundation for either of these suggestions. Provided that they are satisfied on these points they appear to have no strong views one way or another, hut one or two of them said that the Arabs would dislike an Indianised control to which Aden might be subjected if it remains attaches to Bombay.m 6 . jne ox the leading Arab merchants, in a separate conversation with me, said that any fears that there were on the part of Arabs with regard to the change were based on a misunderstanding of what was intended. He 1 said that he himself was puzzled by the term 'Chief Commissioner^ and did not know what it meant. He said that in the absence of any explanation as to how the change would really affect the people of Aden, the Oowasji Dinshaws and other Indians had been able to spread false impressions and had thereby gained a degree of support which would not have been given to them if the proposal had been properly understood. I pointed out to him that several small territories in India such as Delhi, Ajmer and Goorg are Chief Commissionerships, and that the civil rights of their populations are no less than those of the inhabitants of the larger provinces. He suggested that the real implications of the transfer should be more clearly explained by the authorities, and that the reasons for f the change should be stated fully and frankly and with out any reservations, which only lead to suspicion. By this I understood him to mean that it is thought that there are poltical - grounds for the measure as well as the financial and administrative reasons that have been published. 7. Apart from the Indians and the Arabs the other communities in Aden show no interest in Government's proposals. 8 . As regards your second question, the Indians are at present the only people in Aden who are in the habit of giving organised expression to their opinions, they are politically far more advanced than the Arabs who consequently often follow their is ad, sometimes because theythsy ara under commercial and financial obligations to the leading Indian firms. The Arabs have, however, for the most part abstained from joining in the agitation against the transfer. Among 190 signatories to a resolution passed against it on the 27th of August 1931 there was only 9 Arabs (none of whom are prominent members of the community), and the Arab members of the Board of the Port Trust and the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement all voted in favour of the transfer, Copies of the various resolutions that have been passed by the local bodies and at public rneetings have been forwarded to G-overnment, and you will have seen that both the local bodies supported the proposals of G-overnment. 9. As regards your third question, you will see froir the census figures that the Indian population is now about 15% on the whole, but it is certainly not necessary that only their opinion should be considered. Aden is an Arab town, and, although the local Indian community has contributed very largely to its present prosperity and plays a leading part in its affairs, there is no reason why its views and its interests should over-ride those of the rest of the population. Many of Aden’s problems are peculiar to itself and differ widely from tnose of towns in India. Educated Arabs look for their inspiration to cSgypt, Palestine and Iraq rather than to India, and the language, habits and mental outlook of the bulk of the population make it incongruous to include it in an Indian province which is passing increasingly under Indian control In my opinion Imperial interests also forbid its inclusions in an autonomous province such as Bombay may become. The position of Aden appears to me to be in many ways analogous to that of Burma, for which the necessity' ° f se P arate and special treatment has been accepted R without question. The opposition to the transfer is, I # think, largely fictitious and I trust that undue weight will not be given to it. 10. Tour fourth question is answered by what I have written above. 11. As regards your fifth question I suggest that I actual ^fects of the change should be more clearly ||| explained to the public of Aden either by a G-overnment ||| communique or oy myself personally. For instance the administrative, financial and judicial system in a Chief Commissionership might be outlined shortly and clearly in a manner that would remove apprehensions founded on ignorance and misunderstanding. One of the questions that I have been asked is whether the powers of a Chief Commissioner approximate to any extent to those of a local lovernment, and I should be glad to be in a position to reply to this and other enquiries such as those that I have mentioned in this letter. I am convinced that with a proper understanding of the intentions of Government the transfer will be approved by all educated opinion in Aden vrith the exception of members of the Indian community whose individual interests link them in a special way to Bombay. 12. I am sending a copy of this letter to Turner. Yours sincerely, (Signed) B.B. Reilly. To 7 .B. Howe 11 ,Esq.,0 .S.I.,C.

The Civil Hospital has recently been improved at the cost of the Government of India after a personal visit of inspection ty the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin, who w a s not satisfied with its condition a t the time of his visit. The hospital accommodation now provided at Aden is up to the standard prevailing in the Presidency. Die general administration is suited to the conditions prevailin^t Aden which from those of the Presidency* (k) Yes, under the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act of 1864, as amended by Acts VI and XXIX of 1927.

It Should be remembered that only a very small proportion of it is really domiciled in Aden. The great majority of Indians here have their homes in India, and come to Aden tempomrily for trade ana business. Although the local Indian Community has done much to benefit Aden and to promote its prosper!uy it is not an integral part of the permanent population in the same sense as the Arab and ^Jewish communities whose members are natives of the place and have their permanent homes here, 3. The 178 Aral signatures include 9 or 10 names of importance. The rest are of persons of little weight in the community. The most prominent Arabs have not signed the memorial, which in my opinion does not represent the real view of the Community. My reasons for this opinion areL- (1) The Arab members of the Aden Port Trust and the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement have all recently/ voted in favour of the transfer. (2) A protest signed on 27th August 1931 by 190 persons against the attitude of the Executive Committee on this question included only 9 Arabs, none of whom were men of any importance. (3) The number of signatures, 178, is small in propor tion to the size of the Community which numbers 89,820. (4) The Arabs as a whole, and especially the principal men among them, have markedly abstained non 'Ccnin t3 ^ in the agitation against the transfer. (5) I judge also by the views expressed to me privately by leading Arabs. C IHe 12 Jewish signatures include only one name of importance, and they are certainly not representative of their Community, the head of which proposed the resolution recently passed by the Executive Comittee of the *cien SettlementSettlement In favour of the transfer, tte Jewish CommunUy numbers 4120. 5. The 10 Somali signatures are also in-significant. The community numbers 3935, but (like the resident Europeans and Indians) ito ie&amp;.l home is not in Aden. Its members cohb here foi trade oi v/ork 0 It is backward in comparison with the other comnunities, and has no real viev/s on the subject of the transfer. 6 . No member of the local European Community has signed the memorial. In so far as Europeans here are interested in the question at all, they are in favour of the transfer to the Central Government. 7. My reply to the question put by Government is therefore that the signatures can be taken as representative of the Indian community in Aden, but not of the other communities. As the Indians are about 15 % of the total population, the signatories cannot be considered to represent the population as a whole. These remarks apply also to the memorial dated 27th August 1931 addressed to the Resident and Commander-in- 8. I enclose a statement of draft replies which I consider suitable to the various clauses of the question put oy Mr. A*N.

The memorandum on the Civil Administration of .en was sent by the local Authorities to the Chamber • commerce here for their opinion ana when the g blic came to know about this they applied that be for sous sing in the Chamber they should hole, the eting of Arabs and Indians to consider the P^-os ,d cons about the transfer of Aden to the ntral Government. Most of the Aden Traders come from the Bomoay ■ esidency and they have long connections with Aden ■ ade, their Head Offices strongly object to the •ansfer of Aden to the Government of India. The Administration of Aden justice is under the ipervision of the Bombay High Court and for any ^legal technicality when the cases are referred to the Bombay High Court, the Head Offices in Bombay find it very convenient to attend to their Solicitors and Counsels when the cases come up for hearing in the Higl Court of Bombay. The registration of documents for properties in Aden are permissible to be registered in Bombay,which is a very great convenience. it is an easy matter for the Head Offices in Bombay to approach the Bombay Legislative Councillors in case they have any grievances regarding the Aden Administration. The trade of Aden with India is chiefly from Bombay and Karachi. (1) On considering the memorandum they are of opinion that the Armed Police Force is for the defence of Aden and that the expenditure on that account should be wholly borne by the Colonial or the Central Govern ment. (2) The Railway at Aden was first introduced as a War measure, to facilitate the transfer of troops end stores to the Military Frontier at Sheikh Othman and was since worked at a heavy loss an... the public is of opinion that the heavy deficit on tais account might have been included in the Central Government T s Budget and they consider that the loss on that account should be borne by the Military. Moreover io is no loiy.ei c.n item of recurring expense, as the railmy is out of commission. (3) The contribution from India to yards the Military expense of Aden was £2,50,000 for the first three years since 1927 and after that the expense would be curtailed to £1,50,000 which will show considerable reduction on the debit side in the Central Government ! sGovernment’s Budget. (4) The public of Aden are apprehensive that the transfer 01 Aden to the Central Government means a first step towa, d^ nanaing it over to the Colonial Government which would be detrimental to the interest of the Oriental races. (5) According to the report of the Simon Commission the Bombay Province is to get an autonomy and the public of Aden are of opinion that in that case Aden should not be severed from Bombay, as they are looking forward to representation on the local bodies, as well as Provincial and Central Legislature. I am sure 37-011 will agree with us that the above five points raised b 3 ^ us will meet with your approval and kind consideration, as we do not like to be in the same position as one of the non-regulation Provinces like the N.'7.Frontier or Baluchistan. A memorial from the public of Aden ventilating their views on the above points is being drafted addressed to the Private Secretary to nis Excellenci 7 * the liceioy Simla, which will be forwarded in due course.

It is requested that the Government of Bombay will be pleased to include this Chamber in the list of Chcmo ua0oe vie?/s are invited whenever commercial opinion is consulted. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, 5 ( jy_ naridas Lalji, Honorary Secretary.To, Ihe Private Secretary, r Io His Excellency .The Viceroy, SIMLA SIR, We, the undersigned, the residents of Aden, beg to approach you wiih a lequest that you will be pleased to place this representation of ours before His Excellency the Viceroy. The question as to whether Aden should continue to form a part of India was a longstanding one, and after receiving careful consideration of the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, residents of Aden and the Indian people generally was settled sometime back and it was decided that even though the military control might be removed to Great Britain, with regard to the Civil Administration of Aden it should continue to form a part of this country. The Hon’ble Sir Phiroze Sethna moved a resolution in the Council of State on 26th September 1921 recommending to the Governor General in Council that a representation be made to the Secretary of State for India that the Administrative control of Aden be continued under the Government of India and the resolution was adopted. We beg to enclose herewith, for ready reference, copies of the following:— {a) Copy of a telegram from the Vice-Chairman of the British India Colonial Merchants’ Association to the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, and to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, dated 5th March 1921. [b) Copy of a representation, dated 15th May 1921 ; submitted by the British Indian Colonial Merchants’ Association, Bombay, to His Excellency Lord Reading, the then Viceroy of India. (c) Copy of a representation, dated 15th May 1921, submitted by the Aden merchants to His Excellency Lord Reading, the then Viceroy of India. The gist of all these was that Aden could not be sepaiated from India and that the Administrative control should continue to vest in the Government of Bombay, as was the case since Aden came to be conqueied m 85. y Major Bayley sent by the Government of Bombay. It is no exaggeration to say that Aden has been built up by the meer work of the Bombay Indian merchants who were settled there in the ’ly part of the last century. In fact, as was cogent y pomur ^ ^ : Hou’ble Sir Dinsbaw Wacha iu a debate wh.cl, took place m tbe Co u a State on the motion of the Hon’ble Sir Phiroze S f nla &gt; ff' 6 us have been working there for more ian a ceil mj a ‘ Aie hands en was captured. The trade of Aden is even now laigely m t e 1 Bombay Indians who have conducted their usiiiess British reased their prestige and which has bene e i T ,. tra ^ ers all( j vernmeut. These silent, shrewd and capable om aj , | Aden rchants have devoted their time to the development of Aden and A rt, and made it an important link between India ‘he s eat o^Uie ipire. The Bombay Indian business communi y had ^ P wjlI along that the city^ which was built by• o nf the Bombay Presidency and will not be transferred to the Z™y 0 nl° l £t*ZJo { India. The population of Aden at p^eut is 53,000, which is composed of: Arabs Indians Jews Somalis ...31,612 ••• 5,594 ... 4,408 ... 6,551 Miscellaneous... 4,867 There are 3 Salt factories belonging to Indians, producing on an average per mouth about 20,000 tons of salt. It is only recently that* the Government of India have afforded relief to these salt factories recognising the oart they have played and are playing in the snnoly of salt to this country, and it is to be reared that if the present control of the Government of Bombay is taken away and transferred to the Government of India these salt factories may have to suffer. In view of all the facts stated above, we were painfully surprised to read the reply given by the HonVie the General Member to an interpellation in the Bombay Legislative Council stating that “ the Government of Bombay, supported, it is hoped, by all responsible opinion in the Presidency, propose, to press for the transfer of Aden at once under the powers vested in the Governor General in Council with the approval of the Secretary 7 of State under Section 59 of the Government of India Act.” A memorandum lias been prepared and circulated by the Government of Bomba\ 7 regarding Civil Administration of Aden. We beg to point out that upto now the Indian commercial community of Bombay, which is vitally interested in this question, lias not been consulted at all. The memorandum pointed out that so far as the civil expenditure in Aden is concerned thereis a snia.i surplus of Rs. 8,000 for the Provincial revenue and a deficit of about Rs. 3 lakhs for the Central revenue. It is stated that “the propriety of debiting to the Central Government items of expenditure which are really Provincial in nature is under consideration, and the adjustments which may become necessary will convert the small precarious Provincial surplus to a substantial deficit varying from 2 to 3 lakhs or more ” The transfer of the control of Aden from the Bombay Government to the Central Government ciiinot by any means be justified even if this estimate of a loss of Rs. 2 to 3 ;akhs to the Pioviucial Revenues in future is correct. It is surelv prepos terous to suggest, as has been suggested, that a loss arising from the admiuis- t.atiou Oi one particular district belonging to a province justifies the transfer of that district either to the Central or to another Provincial Government. There are much weightier considerations which should guide the policy of Go\ eminent with regard to such matters. It is mainly the people from omba\ who have settled in Aden and have made it a thriving port, and the Provincial Revenues had not up to this time to suffer any loss. If on account ot any leadjustiuent the Provincial Revenues are faced with a small deficit of - or 3 lakhs the remedy does not lie in the transfer of Aden to the Central Government. The Government of Bombay can very well find out how to or * 115 deficit, by other ways and means, or the deficit may be 1 • f nccessaTy item, looking to the large interests of Bombay of SinrJ r U ° 'r 111 .i lle * q ! lei&gt;tio f 1 ‘ ^ e ma y be allowed to quote the instance we a re J. c . n j at ^ Ul de of the Government of Bombay, so far as even thouo-l,^1,^ a L 1 ! 1 ^ ^2 • not ^ etac ^ e d f rom the Presidency proper lookino- to rh ma ~ ° e . ou account of the administration of Sind. If to have it ^ Ilc l t ^ le Government of Bombay do not want same argument L ^ le . ^^s^ency proper, there is no reason why the same argument and considerations should not apply to Aden. a sine^qua non° nfTl ^ Ct t \ lat con ^P^ e f e provincial autonomy is going to be bv the people carrying tb^- con; J tltll tional reforms, it is naturally expected &gt; lei1 ousihess in Aden that it will share inssirsr* scj&amp;tjsrs sr»- r desired, end Ike ..me mu.1 be mid e( ,„edie,l Mirii.

Aden also require” a sound and efficient Municipal Administration and a Municipal Bodv constituted like the big Municipalities of the Bombay Presidency This will be possible only under a Minister. Owing to all these reasons we beg to strongly urge that the Civil Administration of Aden should continue to remain in the hands of the Government of Bombay and that it should not be transferred to the Goveimnent of India just at a time when complete Proviucial autonomy is going to be instituted in India. Under all these circumstances we beg His Excellency the Viceroy to be pleased to consider our case favourably and give an assurance that the administrative and civil control of Aden will not be transferred from the Government of Bombay, at any rate till the responsible Indian commercial opinion in Bombay is consulted. His Excellency has got an intimate acquaintance with the problems of this Presidency and we feel sure that His Excellency will not be a party to any steps which may prove detrimental to the interests of the people who have settled there and contributed their quota to making Aden what it is. The constitution of future India is in the making, and we cherish hopes that as a result of the second Round Table Conference and the united efforts and co-operation of the Imperial Government, the Government of India and the accredited leaders of the Indian people, India will be enjoying soon a constitution which will be analogous to the one which is being enjoyed by the free British Dominions. Aden has upto now been left out of any active share in the political life of this country, and has also suffered from not having any voice in the Legislatures, whether Central or Provincial. We therefore, beg to request that, looking to the claims, both political and commercial, of Aden, as also its population which is more than 50,000, it may be given the right of sending two representatives to the Bombay Legislative Council and one representative to the future Federal Parliament. We tiust that these demands will be favourably considered and conceded.copy of the telegram dated the 5th March 1S21, sent by the Vice-Chairman British Indian Colonial ' ivi© fg hants T Associaijion« Bomloav From, The Vice-Chairman, iiie British Indian Colonial Merchants T Association, Bombay, To 1.

Through His Excellency Sir George Ambrose Lloyd, G.C.I.E., D.S.O., Governor of Bombay in Council, Bombay. ^— MY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, We, the undersigned, on behalf of the British Indian Colonial Merchants T Association, representing His Gracious Majesty’s 103 /al British Indian subjects trading with Aden, beg most humbly and respectfully to express to Your Excellency our feeling of great anxiety at the announcement recently made by the Premier, regarding the contemplated transfer of the administra tion of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. It was in the year 1839 A.D., that this piece of rocky land was captured by Major Baillie sent oy one Bombay Government. From that date the settlement vies created a Political Residency. Aden thus became a part of the British Indian Empire and its administration has since been carried on at the cost of the Indian ^xchecuer. The Government at that time called upon tne specially o t me Presileney o t to develop the trade of the country; though it was a factfact that long before the capture of Aden, some Indian Merchants had been presperously carrying on trade under the Sultanate of lahej. This important outpost is thus maintained and developed by the Indian money and Indian enterprise; and the Government: at tnat time assured the Indian public that Aden will ever remain an integral part of the Indian Empire. It was on tnis assurance that Indian mercants cordial ly i esponded to the invitation and with their instinctive spirit of adventure came forward and carried on the trade with the country at great risk to themselves and of the capital invested. A study of the trade returns from 1839 A*D., will show the nature of the labour ions part Indian Merchants have ( \ played for the last eighty years for the greater progress and prosperity of the country, it was the Indian Merchant who played the part of the inter mediary and upheld the prestige of the British Empire and who was instrumental in turning the turbulent natives into loyal and orderly citizens of the Crown and it was the Indian troops that have been mostly employed and kept there to preserve peace and order. So much has our connection been conducive to the interests of the natives of Aden that we are sure the chiefs and the well-to-do Arab Tribes, engaged in the peaceful pursuits of commerce, not only in the Settlement but round about, will oppose and resent any proposal of the transference of tne adminisoration to the Colonial Office, and their intimate commercial and social relation with Indian Merchants for tne last eighty years. So convinced they are 01 the immense benefit they have derived from that connection tlmt there is every likelihood of great discontent taking place by the reason of the proposed severance, v/emmmm We venture t0 brln S your Excellency’s notice that the resolution of the Aden Chamber was supported by a handful of mercnants only and that too under the belief that the Government had decided to transfer Aden to tie Government of Egypt. They therefore preferred the Colonial Office to the Egyptian Government. This will clearly be seen from the representation signed by ever a hundred leading merchants, including all the Indian. Asiatic, Jew and Arab members of the Aden Chamber of Commerce, and submitted to the Political Resident on the 3rd of March 1921. We trust, we will not be presumptuous, if we claim to be the pioneers of the development of the tra.de and prosperity of the country. As such we respectfully beg to point out that it behoves the Government of India and the Imperial Government to ascertain our views and those of the Arabs before any transfer to the Colonial Office is determined upon. Should it take place at all, we are afraid, non-with-standing the assurance of the Hon'hie Mr. Bray in the Council of State, the right of equal citizenship of the British Commonwealth will he denied to His Majesty’s British Indian Subjects. It would oe an act of grievous injustice and iniquity to subordinate the interests of the Indian Settlers to those of the white. We need not narrate here the sad experience of our country isn in South and East Africaner the ignominous condition ,o which they are reduced, not-with-standing all tne ixertions of the Government of India in fighting the just ause of their Indian subjects. ^Ve therefore most res- lectfully pray Your Excellency that in the interests of ohe iritish Empire, my in the interest of British Justice nd Eairpiay, year Government will be pleased to oppose lost vigorously the creation ot an Irdla-arablan problem, s there la an African one. The Introduction of lll-feelin 0monopolies or ■ trs.d.e snd Ismci s.nd. the very regretahi e European policy of Racial Segregation will he another great slur on the fair fame of impartial British Justice. If the Pi.opo^ecl transfer takes place it will he taken for granted hy His Majesty's Indian Subjects that whenever &amp; coanti i&amp; developed oy the prolonged exertions of tne Indian, it -.mil only he a preliminary to a transfer of an undeserved character to a. Government which had no hand or played no part whatsoever in its establishment, development and prosperity. We beg to enter our emphatic protest against so imprudent and unjust a policy. It will strike at the very root of all Indian enterprise in foreign parts and will amount to a betrayal of the best interests of Indian Merchants. All the firm belief in the just and good intentions of the Government will be shattered. We may here beg leave to observe that as the result of the great War, while the British Colonies have been allotted certain territories and Islands belonging to the enemies, India is being unjustly and arbitrarily deprived of the territories which her people had brought to such prosperous development. Such treatment will naturally tend, to undermine all their belief in talk of India's equal partnership with the British Commonwealth and the full citizenship of the British Empire. It will not be out of place to point out here tnc-o the landed estates of the Indian Merchants at Aden are enormous and the Indians hatfe settled do® and have made that country as their land of adoption. J- he Inuions settled there have so substantially ouiut up tiiei- step by step, during the last eighty years, that they at present command the major portion of the Red ^ea Ports business and for this object some of the prominent fxrms . , , Head Offices at Aden for man.y &amp; have established tneii - year past. WeMe may c^so ue permitted to point out that the British and other Europeans scarcely form considerable pal t of tne populc-tion# ihey are merely temnorary residents carrying on trade as shipping and coaling agents; and it was these few who where actually instru mental in passing the Chamber's resolution, probably under the same belief that the administration was being transferred to the Government of Egypt. Lastly we think it our duty to bring to Your Excellency’s notice a rumour that is afloat that even if the administration of Aden be transferred to the Colonial Office the Military Expenditure of the country and further-more the Naval Expenditure on the port of Aden will wholly or to a great extent fall on the Indian revenues. We do not believe in the rumour but should there be a grain of truth in it, we are sure the Govern ment of India will not only protest and resent any such prooosal but on the other hand will demand cl .ciic-.i e 01 cue past, present and future enormous Military and Naval expenditure from the Colonial and the Imperial iree^ary as this gateway has been and will be maintained for the ♦ T 4 - -? &lt;--! mir’ f*i T , rn belief 't 3 li£L'fc under* safety of the Empire. It is om n - anv circumstances, the civil administration cl Aden can safely and fairly he Kept under the Goverhment of India, even If the Military and naval adninisnation oe ferred to the Imperial oovemaent; hut we maKe tola to in the Eshar Committee T s point out that as suggested in the - j . phief in India is going to Report, if the Commander- in-cniei -nation with the Chief of the imperial have direct communication ■ + +hp &lt; 5 ii S htest reason for snaocn- Staff then there is not the &lt;= + n-n fvon the Government cf India, me ing aw Aden at all from uie +riis t the Government of India -ii therefore earnestly tro. . h tl „ Pleased to publish the full conditions m de ic the administration is proposed to he transfers to he ColonialColonial Office. In conclusion, we pray Your Excellency who are regarded as the model of British Justice and Pairplay and who have oeen specially sent here to govern this country justly and to satisfy the aspirations of the Indians, tnat four Excellency's Government will strongly submit the Indian case and advocate the Indian point of view in the Imperial Councils of the British Empire and v/ill thus prevent the transference of an important seat of commei ce wnich upto now has 'been undoubtedly developed at the cost of the Indian Exchequer and 'by enterprise, patient industry and capital of the Indian people.

It was in the year 1839 A.D., that this piece of rocky land was captured by Major Baillie, sent by the Bombay Government; Aden has thus become a part cf the British Indian Empire and the administration has since been carried on at the cost of the Indian Exchequer. The Government at that time called upon the Indian Merchants to develop the trade of the country. This important outpost is thus maintained and developed by Indian money and Indian enterprise; and the Government at that time assured the Indian public that Aden will ever remain a part of the Indian Empire. It was on this assurance Sir,that the Indian Merchants accepted the invitation and with their instinctive spirit of adventure, came forward and carried on the trade with the country at great risk to themselves and to tneir money. A reference to the trade returns will convince anybody the nature of the laborious part the Indian mp. mb antiSmerchants have played for the last eighty years for the prosperity of the country. It was the Indian Merchants, Sir, who played the part of the inter mediary and upheld the prestige of the British Empir and who were instrumental in turning the natives intc loyal citizens or the Crown* bo much has been our connection conducive to the interests o± the natives that iie are sure that the chiefs and well-to-do Arab tribes, not only at Aden but round about, will oppose and resent any proposal of the transference of the administration to the Colonial Office, and the intimate contract with the Indian merchants for the last eighty years has convinced them of the advantages of the connection with the Indians and the Indian Government. We venture to bring to Your Excellency’s notice that the resolution of the Men Chamber was supported by a few merchants and only 'under the belief that the Govern ment had decided to transfer Aden to the Government of Egypt, and they, therefore, preferred the Colonial Office to it; this will clearly be seen from the representation signed by over a hunched men chan uS including all the Indian and Arao Iviercnanuo o± une Aden Chamber of Commerce and submitted to the Political Resident of Aden on the 3rd marc a 1S21. It will not be presumptions, Sir, if we claim to be the pioneers in developing the trade and prosperity of the country and it behoves, therefore, tnat ^he Government of India and Imperial Government should obtain our view and that of Arabs before any change can be saddled on. If the proposed transference of the administration take place, we are afraid. Sir, that inspite of the assurance of the Hon'ble ;r. Bray, in the Council of State, the right of equal citizenshipcitizenship of the British Commonwealth will he denied to nis Majesty's British Indian Subjects whenever the interests of the white Settlers will ' be a \^jiSsLi^ :rU ' fcUre * ' ,e need narrate here the sad eKpcncJ-ltttre of our countrymen in South and East Africa, nor the ignominious condition to which they are reduced, nor the fruitless exertions of the Government of India in fighting the just cause of their subjects. We therefore, most respectfully request Your Excellency that in the interest of the British Empire, may in the interests of the prestige of British justice and fairplay, Your Excellency's Government should not he a party to produce another Africa for the introduction of the ill-feeling, monopolies of trade and land and the very regretable European policy of Racial Segregation which is but a slur on the fair name of British justice. ^ If the proposed transference takes place we shall be grieved to find that whenever a country is developed by the prolonged exertion of the Incdans, that country is shke snatched away from them and is marked down for the settlement end benefit ’&gt;j those, who have played no part whatsoever in its development and prosperity. Against this sort of treatment, we strongly beg to protest as it i at the very root of the Indian enterprise and betrays he Indian merchant when he believes in the good rations of the Government. We may here mention it as a result of the great War the British Lonies have been allotted certain territories and Lands belonging to the enemies, while in the case India she is being robbed of the territories which r neople have brought and developed for the mritish Such treatment will naturally tend to shatteiall their belief in the talk of India's equal partner ship in the British Commonwealth and the full citizen- ship of the British Empire. It will not he out of place to point out here tnat the IcUieod estates of the Indian Merchants at Aaen are enormous and the Indians have settled down and have made mat country as tneir land of adoption. The Indians settled there, heme so much huilt up their trade that they ao present command the major portion of the Red Sea Ports business end for this object some of the great Firms have established their Head Office at Aden since a number of years. We also beg to point out here that the British Europeans scarcely form a part of the population and they are merely temporal residents carrying on trade as Shipping and Coaling Agents; and it was these few who v/ere instrumental in passing the Chambers resolu tion, probably under the same belief that the adminis tration was being transferred to the Government of Egypt. Lastly we think it our duty to bring to Tour Excellency's notice a rumour that is afloat tnat even if the administration of Aden be transferred fco tne Colonial Office, the military expenditure oi tne country and furthermore the naval expenditure oi, tae part of Aden, will wholly or to a great extent fall on the Indian Treasury. We are sure the Government of India will not only protest against and resent any such proposal, but on the other hand will demand a share of . nilitary and naval expend! ture the present and future and Imperial Treasuries as this gateway is and will be maintained for the safety of the It is our firm belief that under any ivil administration of Aden can safely from the Colonial gatewa Empire circumstances the c nPMsafely and fairly be kept under the Government of India, even If the military and naval administration be transferred to the Imperial Government, but we make bold to point out that as suggested in Esher Committee’s Report If the Conraander-in-Chief of India is going uO have direct communication with the Imperial Staff then there is not the slightest reason foi Slid oCiiiiigaway Aden from the Government of India. v»e therefore request the Government of India to puolisn tne conditions under which the administration is proposed to he• transferred to the Colonial Office. In conclusion, we pray to Your Excellency who is uphold as the model of British justice and fairplay and who has been specially sent here to govern this country justly to satisfy the aspirations of the Indians, that Your Excellency 1 s Government will strongj-y put forth the Indian case and advocate the Indian point of view in the Imperial Councils of the British Empire and will thus prevent the transference of an important seat - of commerce which was up to now developed at the cost of the Indian Exchequer and by the Indian people. We beg to subscribe. Your Excellency^ Most Obedient Servants, /? Here follow the Signatures of about 360 Merchants.I'he Chamber or Commerce. C/289. Aden, 25th August 1931.

Din- shaw v/ished their dissent recorded for the following reasons. ^ Mr. AMedbhov I.a. Lal.iee T s note of dissent. Provincial autonomy being a foregone conclusion it is definitely to the advantage of all shades of inhabi tants of Aden that Aden be kept under an Autonomous Bombay Presidency because it will take time for the General c-rovern ment to assume a thoroughly popular form. Aden under oie C entral Government cannot and should ndt in any case expect a treatment better than that Milch is meted out to the non-Regulation provinces of the type of ruWoProntier Provinces and Baluchistan. The fact that the people in these provinces have few rights and privileges i^ “too v/ell known to need repetition. The Arabs, Jews and the Somalis may ue in preponder ance but the fact cannot be denied that the Indians were the Pioneers who made Aden what it is to say. *aen Hinterland has hy their efforts become the chief or the onlyonly market for Indian Piece uoods and Indian Grains, and it was India with Whose money the deficit balances in the past were met. The Indians are entitled to demand that this trade with the Hinterland may not suffer if Aden were to be transferred to the Government of India because With curtailment or freedom as in the iion—Regulation Provinces, Aden will not he a very tempting place for Indian Merchants to remain in. Shipping Trade and the great Salt Industry of Aden are in the hands of the Bombay people to a large extent and their interests are interwoven with Bombay. There are many parts of Bombay Presidency that are not self supporting but that is not a plea$ for snatching those portions away from the Bombay Government. If the land revenue of the Salt Pedis were to go to the Bombay Government, just as the revenue of the Salt Pans of Matunga, Ghatkopar, Bhandup and other places goes to It, then the little deficit that is being made so much of will disappear. Therefore 1 am of opinion that it is beneficial foi all communities that the Bombay connection be letainml.To iiDiJi'j ? the 27th August 1931 . The Resident and Cornraander-in-chief, Aden.

Transfer of control over the Civil Administration of Aden. In continuation of my letter No # 5997-IV-C., dated the 21st Ncv ember 1931, I am directed by the Governor in Council to forward four copies of the address which Sir Chunilal V. Mehta, K.C.S.I., will read as leader of the Aden Deputation when they wait upon His Excellency the Viceroy on the 30th instant.Your Excellency; I have the honour, on behalf of the several organisations which are represented on the deputation, to convey o our respectful thanks to Your Excellency for consulting to receive this deputation and thus allowing us an opportunity of personally placing before Your Excellency our views on the proposed transfer of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India. We are the more assured of a sympathetic hearing from Your Excellency since; as former Governor of Bombay; you possess direct knowledge of the administration of Aden by the Bombay Government. We have no doubt that your Excellency will not approve without the most overwhelming reasons of depriving the Bombay Presidency of a Fort and portion of her territory which she has so long and satisfactorily administered. It is not the first time in the history of Aden that such a proposal is being made. Not only was the present proposal sudden inasmuch as the Indian commercial community, which is chiefly interested; was not consulted before the issue of the Memorandum on the Civil administration of Aden attached to the reply in Council, but we regret that we fail to find in the memorandum sufficient reasons for at all mooting the proposal. The principal reason given is that tho ccntinuancS of the control of the Government of Bombay will moan a loss of Rs. B to 3 lakhs to the Provincial Revenues. X will revert later to the financial aspect^ but even if this estimate is correct, we beg to submit; it does not afford any justification for surrendering an important portion of its charge especially when such a course will adversely affect its own mercantile community settled there and also the future of Aden. Aden, as it is today, has been the creationp ! - . - s - largely oi Bombay merchants and industrialists, and Bombay trade and industries are even now the principal factor in the Revenues of Aden* The representatives of this trade and industries feel very strongly that the administration should continue to be in the hands of the Government of Bombay with which Aden has been connected for nearly a century, even since it came under the control of the British, and they fear that their interests will suffer severely by the proposed change. Aden is already separated by about 1800 miles from Bombay, and adding to that distance another 1000 miles from the seat of administration is certainly not going to be for the benefit of Aden. It is not our purpose here to refer to or examine the merits of the action taken in 1927, which confirmed the purely temporary arrangements adopted only as a war—measure under the stress of the Great bar. These arrangements were originally made in 1917, and 10 years later, the transfer of Military, administrative, as well as strategic and political control from India to London became a permanently accomplished fact. At the same time the Colonial Office wished to take over the Civil administration of Aden, and this proposal created a good deal of consternation and restment both in India and in Aden, where the Indian merchants constitute an important element of the population. This proposal was ultimately^ thanks to the good offices of the Government of India and the then Viceroy, Lord Reading, abandoned, but the Military administration was transferred to the War Office.In regard to the financial aspect of the question, we venture to suggest that an examination should he made not only of the allocation as heetween the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, but also of the contribution properly debitable to the United Kingdom and to India. Your Excellency is awar© that the Government of India urged, as early as 1886, the propriety of the expenses of Aden being divided between Great Britain and India. For as long as 14 years after that; this country continued to bear the entire Civil and Military expenditure. In 1895 the the Welby Commission was appointed to examine the question, and as a result of the Commission^ recammenda- tions His Majesty f s Government made from 1901 a aet annual contribution of £72,000/- to Indian Revenues towards the Military charges of Aden. As a result of the transfer, originally made as a war-measure, in 1917 of the Military control of Aden to Great Britain, the contribution of the Government of India has been fixed at £250,000/- per annum for the first three years, to be reduced thereafter to £150;000/-, or a third of the total cost whichever may he less. of course, are not aware of the grounds on which this allocation was arrived at, and we venture to suggest that in order to satisfy Indian opinion as to the equity of this contribu tion a Commission on which Indians are adequately ——- represented might be appointed to examine the question, in view of the fact that the examination was made so long ago as in 1895; it would not be unreasonable to suggest that since conditions of control have completely altered, the question should be examined afresh. We are not in* 4 - position to gxve at the present moment our detailed view on the figures of revenue and expenditure as presented in the memorandum, as ue have not yet received the information regarding the accounts we have asked for. We would only like to say in this connection that the expenditure on Aden of the Central Government is bound to show a considerable increase, if control is transferred from the Bombay Government and if, as is suggested, Aden is turned into a Chief C ommissionership. As regards the allocation between the Provincial and Central Governments, the memorandum suggests that although at present there is a small Provincial surplus the propreity of debiting to the Central Government items of expenditure, v/hich are really provincial in nature, is under consideration. In the absence of fuller information, we regret that we are not in a position to deal with the correctness Of certain adjustments that may be suggested. For example, it would have to be examined how far the expenditure on items contained in the meamroandum such as education, medical, public health and general administration, are incurred for the benefit of officers belonging to the Central Government or tc the Provincial Government or for the benefit of the Military. It will also be necessary to determine to what extent the expenditure on Police is t justly i. debitable to Provincial Revenues in so far as it is required solely for the purposes of Civil adminis tration. We have given the most careful attention to all the points made in the memorandum issued by the~ 5 - Government of Bombay, and we are constrained to sa y that no case has been made out for giving up the control of Aden. All that they indicate is, in our opinion, the necessity for an independent examination of the financial/abilities which which ought justly to attach to all the interests concerned in Aden. We do not know how far this has been made by the Government of Bombay, but we feel certain that it ought to be made by an independent Commission of the nature indicated before# We feel sure that the Gov^ernment of Bombay has not given enough considera tion to the very strong feeling that exists in the Indian mercantile community in Bombay against any dis ruption of the long historical association, which is bound to affect adversely its commercial and other interests, nor are we aware of any attempts made by the Government of Bombay to put forward proposals for making up the deficits, if any, that may ultimate ly legitimately arise# Aden upto now has got practically next to nothing of Local Self Government and its Port £rust and its Municipality have got little of the popular element on them# Looking to the fact that Provincial autonol^ will be a sine qua non of Constitutional Reforms in the near future, both its Municipal and its Port Trust administrations are naturally expected to be constituted on a broader popular basis. It is also expected that the administration by a pppularly constituted Government in Bombay will mean a great6 deal for the progress and development of trade and industries of Aden. The question involves a principle of great importance to Indians as citizens of the British Commonwealtho In South Africa, in East Africa and elsewhere, the Indian people have to struggle hard to maintain their rights, -- acquired hy services rendered in developing and otherwise promoting the prosperity of the countries concerned. It is to he hoped that no occasion for such a struggle will arise in Aden. Bombay merchants have taken a prominent share in the development of Aden mainly because of its century-old connect ion with their Presidency, and the assurance which it provided that their interests will be protected and promoted by the Government of their own Province to which they had the readiest access and which was intimately acquainted with their wants and Irishes. They are entitled, to put at the lowest, to be consulted, when it is proposed to bring about a revolutionary change in this arrangement which, on the whole, has worked satisfactorily. They have seen nothing so far in the published papers to show that in proposing a change in the administration of Aden their point of view has been taken into account. I confess that I cannot disguise our underlying fear, that the present proposal is really a first step m the direction of depriving India of the administration of a territory's which is of great strategic and polit' importance to Great Britain. Already the Military portion of the administration has been taken over. While we do not see that any case has been made out for the transfer of Aden to the Government of India, we earnestly request Your Excellency7 Excellency to give a specific assurance on behalf of -- His Ifojes ty ’s Government that under no circumstances will the administration of Aden be taken away either from the Provincial or the Central Government in India 8 without the willing consent of the people of India* It would be very desirable to make clear the ultimate intentions of the British Government at a time when discussions are in progress for formulating a scheme for enabling this country to manage her own affairs. Under all these circumstances 9 Your Excellency^ deputationists urge Your Excellency, respectfully, to be pleased to veto the proposed change formulated for the transfer of Aden, and to order that the administration of Aden will continue to be with the Government of Bombay.INDIA FOREIGN SF' I I «— V Q ffl j &amp; leJL'j ^ ^ ' ^ rt/ijsi fit''' C.o 7548 ^H 3 ' 9 ** i W THli HisSSXDEHCY, ^ Aden, 17th October 1931. n 0 o dear Howell, X returned to Aden on the 4th or thia wonth, and ightwick hu s passed xae your D.O. letter (¥.489-Jbi/Sl) on the subject or tne transfer of Aden to the Central Government. 2. You have asked :• (1) What people in Aden think. ( 2 ) 'vhether they are capable of giving expression to their opinions. (3) Is it necessary that only the opinion of the Indian population should be considered. ^4) Are there Oomali and ^rab merchants who have views on the subject. (5) What (if anything) X propose to do. 3 . &amp;ith regard to ( 1 ) we must remember who the people of Aden actually are.

Of tttese the Indians alone appear to have any strong views about the transfer, and under the leadership of the Cowasji Oinehaws they have passed resolutions against the change. They are drawn mainly from Bombay, Gujerat and Kathiawar, and this naturally leads them to favour continued connection with the hombay Presidency.

As far as I know this is an entirely groundless apprehension ana 1 have tola them so. They said that if they were assured that the change was not intended to pave the way to the imposition of a Customs tariff which, in their opinion, would ruin the port, they would be in favour of direct control by the Central Government of Inaia or by the Colonial Office, .ana one or two of them referred to Singapore ana Hongkong as places whose conditions are similar to those of Aden ana in which Colonial Office administration is success ful anc popular. They explained that, as far as the Mats are concerned, the local distrust of Government under the Colonial Office is based on their acquaintance with the neighbouring Colony of British Somaliland, in which there is a burdensome tariff on imports* They also tola me that it had been alleged that the transfer from Bombay would involve the discontinuance of the right of appeal in Judicial oases to ttie Bomba, Hi ah Court, ana. would give the Viceroy a right to transfer Aden to the Oolonial Office at any moment that he wished. 1 tola them that there was no foundation tor either of these suggestions. Provided that they are satisfied on these points they appear to have no strong views ju- ar another, hut one or two of them said that the -tat-&gt; •ould dislike an Inaianisoa control to which Aaen might be subject ud if it, remains ail/achca to Bombay* ' 6 . One of the leading Arab merchants, in a separate onversation with me, said that ;iny ftiiXS l “ *” ul * oie he part of Arabs with regard to the change were baseu on a isunderstanding of what was intended. He aniu. tit elf was puzzled by the term -Chief Commissioner- ana aid not now what it meant. He said that in the absence of any explanationexplanation a, to how the change would really afreet the people of Aaen, the Cowaaji Mnshaws ana other Inaians haa baen able to spread false impressions ana haa thereby gained a degree of support which would not have been given to them if the proposal had been properly understood. 1 pointed out to him that several stall territories in India such as Delhi, Ajter and Coorg are Ohief emissionershlps, ana that the civil rights of their populations are no less than those of the inhabitants of the larger provinces. He suggested that the real implications of the transfer should be more clearly explained by the authorities, and that the reasons lor the change should he stated fully ana frankly ana without any reservations* ‘-vhieh only lead to suspicion* By this 1 understood him to mean that it is thought that there are .political grounds for the measure as well as the financial administrative reasons that have been published. 7. apart from the Indians ana the? Arabs the other communitles in Aden oho w no in terest in Government* s pro pasals. 8. As regards your second question the Indians are at present the only people in Aden who are in the habit of giving organised expression to their opinions. They are politically far more advanced than the Arabs who consequent ly often follow their lead, sometimes because they nr® under commercial ana financial obligations to the leading Indian firms. The ..Arabs have,however, for the most part abstained from Joining in the agitation against the transfer. Among 190 signatories to a resolution passed against it on the 27th of August 1951 there were only 9 Arabs (none of whom are prominent members of the community), and the Arab members of the Board of the Port Trust and the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement all voted in favour of the transfer. Copies of the various resolutions that have been Passed by the local bodies and at public meetings have been forwarded to Government, and you will have seen that Doth —— — IMMj 4 the local fcoales supported the proposal of Govt the hulic ox the population make it incongruous to include it in an inaian province which is passing increasingly under Indian control* In my opinion Imp rial interests also forhid its inclusion in autonomous province such as Bombay may become. The position of Aden appears to me t &gt; be in iaany ways analogous to that of Burma, for which the necessity of separate and special treatment has been accepted without question. The opposition to the transfer is, I think, large ly fictitious and I trust that undue weight will not be given to it. 10. Tour fourth question is answered by what I have written above. 11 • As regards your fifth question I suggest that the actual effects of the change should be more clearly explained to the public of Aden either by a Government communique or by ayself personally. ^or instance the administrative, finan cial and Judicial system in a CStiief Coiomissionership might be outlined shortly and clearly in a manner that would remove apprehensions founded on ignorance and misunderstanding, one of the questions that I have been asked is whether the powers °f a Chief Commissioner approximate to any extent to those(32j) i of a local Governatint, ana 1 should he glad to he In a position to reply to this ana other enquiries such as those that I have mentioned in this letter.

And is not ^den, like India, entitled to repudiate all its debts, and to confiscate all the capital that has been sunk there and impose restrictive conditions on the trade of Indians ? ho doubt hr.

This has served to assure the people of Aden and those who have large vested interest in Aden, as well as those who have business connections with Aden. It is significant to show the interest the Government oi India are manifesting in this question that this assurance nas followed the previous assurance given ty Sir Denis Bray in 1929 to the President of this Association, Sir Pursiioiaii.aas ihajcurdas. It is expected that tae deputation will consist of 2 or more representatives of the Indian Merchants' Chafer and of such other bodies as are vitally interested in this question, but in any case the number will not exceed ten.

The same procedure was followed here end gave rise to a number of supplementary questions which show that some sections at least of opinion in Bombay are still adverse to idle proposed change. From Sir Cowssjee Jehangir I received copies of a representation from the Indian Merchants' Chamber in which no attempt whatever is made to meet the objections disclosed in the Memorandum or to suggest any remedy beyond the nope that when Bombay is a wholly autonomous province the Ministers in charge of the administration will provide lor all the needs of Men.

P.489- 1T/31, dated the 25th September 1931 to Wightwick, a copy of which was sent to me by Gupta with his demi-official letter Mo. P.489-1T/31 dated the 5th October 1931* It may interest you to know that a question regarding the proposed transfer of Men was put by Mr. A. M. Surve, a backward class M.L.O. of Bombay, at the session of the Legislative Council which ended on the 8th instant. I send you a copy of this question herewith. It was sent in too late for answers to be prepared to all the clauses sfore the close of the session and I have sent it to Lghtwick with special reference to clauses (a), (b) and s ) as it was noticed that the signatures on the epresentations purporting to come from the public and esidents of Aden were mostly those of Gujarati Baniy^s, irsis and Indian Muhammadans and that there were few, f a.ny, signatures of Arabs or Somalis wbo form tbe bulk f the population of Men. I may add that Mr. A. E. Surve as no direct connection with Men whatever and was bviously put up to ask this question by the Bombay irms who have business interests in Aden. On the last day but one of the session Rao .(-tp fnr Satara District, asked ahadur R. R» Kale, M.L.C. for bar • &lt; nr , „f the President to move an edjourn- or the permission of tne rieo ent motion to discuss the transfer of Men. The resident refused to give permission as he was not + + was sn urgent one, softer atisfied that the matter was ,n i Sir Ghulam Husain on the subject earing the remarks of Sir unuic* .. c+inn tne fact that when Major Ellis nd taking into consideration tne a the July session no ones' question was answered at .he . lement&amp;ryappeared supplementary question was asked and no interest to be taken by the House in the subject. We have received about half a dozen memorials or representations against the transfer, most of which I expect have also been sent to you. I propose to send them all to you after receiving ITightwick's suggestions for the replies to be given to Hr. Surve's question. In n of these representations, so far as I can see, has any efrort whatever 'been made to meet the objections disclosed in the printed memorandum which was laid on the Table of the Legislative Council last July. Recently Sir Hormasji Adenwala, one of the partners in the Adenwala firm which is one of the leading Parsi firms in Aien asked for an interview with the Honourable Sir Rustom Vakil, Minister for Local Se If-Go vernment, on the subject of the transfer of Aden and Sir Rustom asked me to be present at the interview as he was not familiar with all the aspects of the case. We both found Sir Hormasji practically impervious to any reasonable arguments. His one claim appeared to be that, as the small number of Bombay Parsi and Muhammad an firms had built up their businesses and made their fortunes in Men under the protection of the British garrison there, the members of those firms are entitled to dictate the policy of the Government of Bombay, the Government of India and the Imperial Government in regard to Aden. He brushed aside the fact that the Bombay tax-payer would have to make good in future a deficit of between three and four lakhs of rupees in Aden as a mere nothing, even when I pointed out to him that we expected a deficit in our own budget this year of over a crore of rupees# THe administrative difficulties due to the Resident having to serve under three masters and the fact that the three authorities responsible for Men are situated at Bombay»i our - 3 - Bombay, Delhi and Won, he treated a S due merely to own stupidity and unbusinesslike methods. When Sir Hustom, after listening to him patiently for some time, said that he, looking at the situation from the point of view of a dis interested outsider, could not comprehend how the interests of the Bombay firms established in iiden could suffer by the transfer of Men from Bombay to the Government of India, especially if the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Gourt was to be mtintained with Men, Sir Kormasji merely spluttered© I am afraid you will find there is no chance of bringing these Bombay merchants to see reason in the matter. They are determined by hook or by crook to prevent the break of the link between Men and Bombay if they possibly can. On the other hand I do not think that the bulk of the members of the Bombay Legislative Council care two hoots for Men and they are certainly not prepared to accept any liability of meeting Aden deficits. The bulk of the business community also of Bombay, outside the small but very vocal section of the Par sees, Gujars and Bohras, who have businesses in Aden, is not really interested in the question of the transfer of Men. I think that hitherto there has been a tendency with the Government of India to pay too much regard to the protests of this small section of tne Bombay ousiness community. Their opposition is, I think, largely sentimental and also based possibly on a fear tnat Men may ultimately be placed directly under the home Government. They do not seem to realize that the retention of the link with Bombay cannot possibly make any difference if it is ultimately decided that Aden must be taken over by the Home Authorities#(5^ r X —v - 4 - I venture to suggest therefore that it is really rather a waste of time to pay much further attention to the protests of these gentlemen. I am afraid that V/ightwick will not he able to get any very pronounced opinions from the Arab and Somali sections of the Men public as they are both backward and not really interested in politics. So far as I could gather from Symes who, of course, was in closer touch with the Arabs than any Indian Officer except Reilly is likely to be, the general sentiment among the Arab community, v/as not keen on the Indian connection at all and, if it had to be maintained, they had no objection whatever to the transfer from Bombay to the Government of India. Please forgive this long screed. I thought it might interest you to know the recent trend of events here and to have my views for what they are worth. Yours sincerelyt Sd/- C. W. A. Turner. E. B.

Chief Commissi on ership under the Government of India Act without further delay. In any case if his Excellency the Viceroy decides to receive the deputation His Excellency does not consider it would be suitable for . , +n represent the Bombay Government as me to accompany it to repre^ei-i. he thinks that it would hardly oe m of Bombay to be put more or less in defendant in the discussion. order for the Government the position of a IH I to to refer you to :ry demi-official letter dated today m which I have given an account of what took place at the recent session of the Bombay Le g i s i ative Oounoil with reference to the proposed transfer of Men and of my recent experience of an interview granted to Sir Hormssji Adenwala by Sir Rustom Vakil and have also stated ry own personal views regarding the attitude of the small clique of Bombay merchants who are opposing the transfer of Men. I am to say that His Excellency has perused the draft of this letter before it was despatched and is in entire agreement with me* He^desires me to add that in his opinion the long delay which has occurred since in 1923 the Government of Bombay recommended the separation has merely had the effect of giving time to the clique which I have mentioned to organise the opposition* Ihat even now the Indian merchants, who form a very small part of the population of .Aden, should receive practically no support from the other elements even of the trading community suggests very clearly that the change is recognised as being in the interest of Aden as a whole.

The memo randum referred to in it is placed on the table and has already appeared in the Press. Memorandum on the Civil Administration of Aden. 1. Introductory Remarks. —Some years ago considerable excitement was aroused in political circles in India by the rumour that the connection between Aden and India, which began in 1839, was to be severed by order of His Majesty's Govern ment and that the control of Aden affairs was to be transferred to the Colonial Office. Assurances were consequently given both in the Legislative Assembly at Delhi and the Bombay Legislative Council that no change in the position affecting Indian interests would be made until an opportunity had been given for discussion of any project which might be under consideration. 2. The connection between Aden and British India began in 1839 when an expedition under Major Baillie took possession of what was then only a barren rock, and founded a Settlement there. This was treated as part of British India and included for administrative purposes in the Presidency of Bombay. But since the Settlement commanded the harbour, which is the natural centre of trade for the adjoining parts of Arabia and Africa, it was impossible for its affairs to be. con ducted without relation to the Arab tribes dwelling in the hinter-land. . The Resident at Aden consequently entered into relations with these tribes and with the rulers of remoter places such as Makalla and Shehr, Socotra, etc.. To the tribes of the hinterland were extended guarantees of favour and protection in return for recipioca undertakings. In those days Turkey claimed sovereignty over nearly the whole of the Arabian Peninsula and the development of relations between Aden and the adjoining peoples and rulers consequently brought His Majesty’s Government into contact with the Turkish Empire. As a result of prolonged negotiations a joint .^ n clo-Jurkish boundary Commission was appointed and in 1904-05 the boundary u ° the or Protectorate, as it now began to be called, was demarcated. ™ a . s ^ ru j er one side that the Aden authorities should have no dealings with any indigenous rue under Turkish suzerainty beyond the boundary then fixed, an Matters the Turks should not concern themselves with affairs inside f ^t boumb^}^ continued thus until the outbreak of the Great ^ ar i^ ' ’ -p strategic reasons the Protectorate and endeavoured to blockade the Se , er n „ ' * m c ^ rra y Head- the direction of operations against this menace was ra riolitieal relations quarters in India to the London War Office in 1917 and The with the Aden tribes and rulers necessarily accompani , Presidency was in no civil Administration of the Settlement as part o , v this too might be way affected by this change. After the war it was suggested that this too transferred, but the Indian Government objected an abou t the incidence of remained there, until 1927, when after much « p adopted as a war measure, Aden expenditure, the arrangements of , ? •„ control of the units composing ^rri;or™fSifvST i n a HrMa j e sty ’ 8 Government,.

[21st September 1931. (3) administrative and strategic control of the military and air forces in Aden is under the War Office in London. The Resident is consequently under three authorities, namely : (1) the Government of Bombay, (2) the Government of India, and (3) His Majesty’s Government in London, an arrangement which makes smooth and efficient working very difficult. 3. The area of the Settlement of Aden is 75 square miles, the population in 1921 was about 53,000. The racial composition of the population is as under : Arabs .. Indians J ews Somalis Miscellaneous Total 31,612 3,594 4,403 6,551 4,367 53,032 The Island of Perim has an area of about 5 square miles and a population of 2,075. The Aden Protectorate comprises an area of about 9,000 square miles and has an estimated population of 656,400. 4. Administration .—The chief executive officer (i.e., the Resident and Com mander-in-Chief) has under him three Assistant Residents, the first and the third being officers of the Indian Political Department, and the second, an officer appointed by the Colonial Office in London, who is -also the Protectorate Secretary. Judicial work is performed by a Judicial Assistant who is a member of the Indian Civil Service and is an Additional Sessions Judge. The Police are under the control of an officer of the Indian Police Service. The Island of Perim is also under the administration of the Resident. The civil administraton generally follows the lines in force in India. 5. Finances .—Until 1900 the entire civil and military expenditure in connection with Aden was borne by India, although as early as 1886, the Government of India urged the propriety of the expense of Aden being divided between Great Britain and India. In 1895 the Welby Commission was appointed to examine the question. They recommended that the equity of the case would perhaps be met if the United Kingdom were to contribute one-half of the military charges. As a result of these recommendations His Majesty’s Government made with effect from the 1st April, 1901 a net annual contribution of £72,000 to Indian revenues towards the military charges of Aden, which continued up to 1927. With effect from 1st April, 1927, His Majesty’s Government have become responsible for the whole of the political and military expenditure of Aden, subject to an annual contribution of £250,000 from the Govern ment of India for the first three years, to be reduced thereafter to £150,000 or a third of the total cost whichever may be less. Civil expenditure in Aden is borne partly by the Government of Bombay and partly by the Government of India. The figures of revenue and expenditure (Provincial and Central) are as follows : (a) Provincial. Receipts Expenditure Surplus Accounts. Revised Budget. Average. 1927-28 1929-30 1929-30 1930-31 Rs.

The Provincial expenditure includes a sum of Bs. 2.26 lakhs (roundly) on police, ti addition to which His Majesty’s Government have agreed to contribute a sum of . .8,000 per annum and the Government of India a sum of Rs. 42,000 per annum towards he reorganised police force. This point will be adverted to later. The expenditure charged under ‘ Central ’ includes at present certain heads such is Education, Medical, Public Health and General Administration. These items are yeing booked under the head ‘ 29—Political ’. The amount involved in these items varied approximately Rs. 2,26,000 to Bs. 3,65,000 during the years 1927-28 to 1930-31. The. pro^ priety of debiting to the Central Government items of expenditure which are really ‘ Provincial ’ in gwffl i ll ' *• o,vo,oo\j^ nature is under consideration, and the adjustments Trlli ~ which may become necessary will convert the small V .CeSff CiViI H ° 8pitaI precarious Provincial surplus to a substantial deficit varying from 2 to 3 lakhs or more. 6. Difficulties of the position. —As already explained the relation of the Resident 0 three different authorities leads to delay and diffusion of energy. Moreover the . egie and political importance of Aden renders it obligatory from an unpena ,omt of view that a high standard of civil administration should be maintained there, t is necessary to spend on the Police, in view of the isolation of Aden frdm tne est of India, and its peculiar geographical position, considerably more Than would have een required had Aden been on the mainland of India. A contribution towards this . xpenditure has no doubt been secured from His Majesty’s Government and the ; government of India, but the administration of the force involfes u!h n cc r essavy cwej- &gt;ondence, as the Resident has often to obtain the sanction of three diffcr.mt aurhontiefy ^oposals for aid from Central Revenues are constantly put forward am a £ government of India are convinced in some of these clases that there or reaaWl,™ « - Me expenditure as of Central ratherLEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.

The Future of Aden. Mr. Gandhi is alleged to have expressed his disappoint ment because the Indian merchants of Aden handed him no more than what Mr. Micawber would have called the i idiculous amount of three hundred and twenty-five pounds when his steamer touched at their port. Yet the Aden merchants have some excuse for ther parsimony, if such it was, in the uncertain future of the settlement. Before the War Aden was a portion of the Bombay Presidency, and was staffed and financed by the Bombay Government. An even closer connexion with Bombay was the fact that the trade of Aden was almost entirely in the hands of Parsis, Hindus and Muhammadans from the Western coast of India. After the War, however, the connexion with Bombay was threatened. For a time Aden was to be a portion, perhaps the pivot, of a Near Eastern British Sphere of Influence. That failed to materialise, and the Resident of Aden has since had the pleasant experience of serving five masters, the Colonial Office, the War Office, the Air Ministry, the Government of India, and the Government of Bombay. The last-named Administration has at length protested against the continuance of the arrangement whereby it has to find the staff, and to some extent the money, for the working of the Settlement. It has proposed that a Chief Commissionership should be established by the Government of India, and this would appear to be the most satisfactory solution, though, as the port is now defended by the Royal Air Force, the military arrangements would presumably be directed from Eng land. If, however, India attains to Dominion status, it is a little difficult to see how she can claim to administer an overseas outpost, when she supplies neither aircraft nor warships to defend it. The merchants of Aden may, there fore, be excused if they do not subscribe largely towards the achievement by Mr. Gandhi of a result which will leave them still more in the air than they are at present. Perhaps in the circumstances three hundred and twenty-five pounds constituted a fairly generous gift. /jference Paper. Record D epartment (Parliamentary Branch).

Maneons Before taking definite steps in this direction it was considered, desirable to place all the implications of the position before the public fcUmdof Perim specially interested in the matter and to that end the memorandum on siden Protectorat Aden referred to above was prepared and issued to the Press, to all Mipop “ latlono Members of this House and the Associations and bodies concerned LlUniMm- both here and in Aden. Apart from the administrative difficulties ^ which the present arrangement entails, and which are discussed in Jy 0 a, who is als the memorandum, one of the main considerations for the Government i Assistant wk of Bombay at the present time is dictated by the extreme financial 'i ; stringency which makes it difficult to view with equanimity the nitrationsenerai probability of an extra two lakhs or more of expenditure being transfer- ; ^ red almost immediately from Central to Provincial Revenues under iawasi^by^ the existing constitution. The delay in placing the full facts before of the expei the House has been mainly’ due to the fact that Aden has no separate budget and that it has been found necessary T to prepare special pro .Jine-Miofthemi forma accounts for the purpose. ^“Wnidewit: twenties to Now that the financial position has been clarified the Government of Bombay, supported, it is hoped, by all responsible opinion in tbe Presidency, propose to press for the transfer of Aden at once under j^feto£150,000 the powers vested in the Governor General in Council, with the approval of the Secretary of State, under section 59 of the Governmeot of India Act. MEMORANDUM ON THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION OF ADEN. 1. Introdvrtory Remarks .— Some years ago considerable excitement was aroused in P® . circles in India by the rumour that the connection between Aden and India, which began in 1839, was to be severed by order of His Majesty’s Government and that the control of Aden affairs was to be transferred to the Colonial Office. Assurances were consequently given both in the Legislative Assembly at Delhi and the Bombay Legislative Council that no change in the position affecting Indian interests would be made until an opportunity had been given for discussion of any project which might be under consideration. 7 vr 16 - CO ™ ection between Aden and British India began in 1839 when an expedite: unc er i lajor Baillie took possession of udiat was then only a barren rock, and founded ■ Settlement there. This was treated as part of British India and included for administra tive purposes m the Presidency of Bombay. But since the Settlement commanded th harbour, which is the natural centre of trade for the adjoining parts of Arabia and Africa \ '/I s impossible for its affairs to be conducted without relation to the Arab tri e we mg in the hinterland. The Resident at Aden consequently entered into relation with these tribes and with the rulers of remoter places such as Makalla and Shehr, Socotn e c. o the tribes of the hinterland were extended guarantees of favour and protectioi n re 1 tu ™ for reciprocal undertakings. In those days Turkey claimed sovereignty ove nearly the whole of the Arabian Peninsula and the development of relations betweei Aden and the adjoining peoples and rulers consequently brought His Majesty’s Govern ment into contact with the Turkish Empire. As a result of prolonged negotiation a joint Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commission was appointed and in 1904-05 the boundary1 Aug. 1931] Questions and Answers 575 ol the Hinterland or Protectorate, as it now began to be called, was demarcated It was agreed on the one side that the Aden authorities should have no dealings with anv indigenous ruler under Turkish suzerainty beyond the boundary then fixed ''and on the other, that the Turks should not concern themselves with affairs inside that boundary Matters continued thus until the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, when the Turks invaded the Protectorate and endeavoured to blockade the Settlement. For strategic reasons the direction of operations against this menace was transferred from Armv Head quarters in India to the London War Office in 1917 and control of political relations with the Aden tribes and rulers necessarily accompanied this strategic transfer. The civil administration of the Settlement as part of the Bombay Presidency was in no way affected by this change. After the war it was suggested that this too might be transferred, but the Indian Government objected and the project was dropped. Matters remained there \ntil 1927, when after much correspondence about the incidence of Aden expenditure’, the arrangements of 1917, originally adopted as a war measure, were confirmed, and’ administrative as well as strategic control of the units composing the Aden garrison was also vested in His Majesty’s Government. The present position, therefore, is : (1) the Aden Settlement to which Indian interests are confined, remains part of British India, included in the Bombay Presidency, (2) the affairs of the Protectorate, in which India is not concerned, are dealt with by the Resident, who is also chief executive officer of the Settlement and Commander-in-Chief of the forces, under orders from the Colonial Office in London, (3) administrative and strategic control of the military and air forces in Aden is under the War Office in London. j tie Go® The Resident is consequently under three authorities, namely :— (1) the Government of Bombay, (2) the Government of India, and (3) His Majesty’s Government in London, an arrangement which makes smooth and efficient working very difficult. 3. The area of the Settlement of Aden is 75 square miles, the population in 1921 was about 53,000. The racial composition of the population is as under:— Arabs Indians ion it mis s ied to tie h jnsfortlefe r the eitieti with e(jiin ; enditurefe ncial Eertts t the fol fe Jews Somalis Miscellaneous J Total 31,612 5,594 4,408 6,551 4,867 53,032 The Island of Perim has an area of about 45 square miles and a population of 2,075. The Aden Protectorate comprises an area of about 9,000 square miles and has an estimated population of 656,400. 4. Administration .—The chief executive officer (i.e. the Resident and Commander-in- Chief) has under him three Assistant Residents, the first and the third being officers of the Indian Political Department, and the second, an officer appointed by the Colonial Office in London, who is also the Protectorate Secretary. Judicial work is performed by a Judicial Assistant who is 4 member of the Indian Civil Service and is an Additional Sessions Judge. The Police are under the control of an officer of the Indian Police Service. The Island of Perim is also under the administration of the Resident. The cn il administration generally follows the lines in force in India. 5. Finances .—Until 1900 the entire civil and military expenditure in connection with Aden was borne by India, although as early as 1886, the Government of India urged the propriety of the expense of Aden being divided between Great Britain and India. n 1895 the Welby Commission was appointed to examine the question. They recommended that the equity of the case would perhaps be met if the United Kingdom w ere o conui- bute one-half of the military charges. As a result of these recommendations is r a l e&amp; &gt; ® Government made with effect from the 1st April 1901 a net annual contribution °i * 'A6UU to Indian revenues towards the military charges of Aden, which continuec up o . - 1 . With effect from 1st April 1927, His Majesty’s Government have become responsible lor the whole of the political and military expenditure of Aden, subject to an annua con tion of £250,000 from the Government of India for the first three years, o e xe thereafter to £150,000 or a third of the total cost whichever may be less.gyg Questions and Answers [1 Aug. 193 J Civil expenditure in Aden is borne partly by the Government of Bombay and partH T the Government of India.

In the above figures “ Interest on Ordinary Debt ”—Central—has been excluded, and due allowance made for pensionary liabilities accruing against Government and for items of expenditure in 1930-31 sanctioned after the Budget was passed. The Provincial expenditure includes a sum of Rs. 2-26 lakhs (roundly) on police, in addition to which His Majesty’s Government have agreed to contribute a sum of £8,000' per annum and the Government of India a sum of Rs. 42,000 per annum towards the reorganised police force. This point will be adverted to later. The expenditure charged under “ Central ” includes at present certain heads such as Education, Medical, Public Health and General Administration. These items are being booked under the head “ 29-—Political ”. The amount involved in these items varied approximately from Rs. 2,26,000 to Rs. 3,65,000 during the years 1927-28 to 1930-31. The propriety of debiting to the Central Govern ment items of expenditure which are really “ Provincial ” in nature is under consideration, and the adjustments which may become necessary will convert the small precarious Provincial surplus to a substantial deficit varying from 2 to 3 lakhs or more.

Difficulties of the position .—As already explained the relation of the Resident to three different authorities leads to delay and diffusion of energy. Moreover the strategic and political importance of Aden renders it obligatory from an imperial point of view that a high standard of civil administration should be maintained there. It is necessary to spend on the Police, in view of the isolation of Aden from the rest of India, and its peculiar geographical position, considerably more than would have been required had Aden been on the mainland of India. A contribution towards this expenditure has no doubt been secured from His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, but the administra tion of the force involves unnecessary correspondence, as the Resident has often to obtain the sanction of three different authorities. Proposals for aid from Central Revenues are constantly put forward and although the Government of India are convinced in some of these cases that there is justification for regarding a portion at least of the expenditure as of Central rather than Provincial concern, difficulties arise under the present constitu tional arrangements as the Government of India cannot incur expenditure on provincial subjects. Experience has shown that the overlapping of responsibilities and functions under the present system can only lead to delay and has resulted in what one authority called “ the stagnation of Aden ”. It is unfair to expect the Government of Bombay, whose interest in Aden arises largely out of historical association, to spend their provincial revenues for the improvement of a distant outpost and raising its administration to a^standard befitting a nodal point of the Empire. The present small surplus which the Government of Bombay secures from Aden is doubtful and is likely to be converted into jutoitiii deficit as a la idei is therefore Coton laoBaWurD.: it lie pleased to (I) whether the ik Cota Coi M the East Ii mjofthebye-lai iiCoicil haves le trade; (Hjiftheansv «the members amted with t P) whether: ismtion Ltd, temittee; P) whether t kt report hast d the repi ^ any, and fetentoithe whether fiions and rei1 Aug. 1931] Questions and Answers 677 a substantial deficit as a result of the investigation into the classification of some of the items of expenditure now charged to Central Revenues.

The Honourable Sir GOVINDRAO PRADHAN: The attention of the honourable member is drawn to the Press Xote of 1/th June 1930 referring to the appointment of the Committee referred to. The Committee submitted its report in December last and it was published. Copies of the Report and Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee are placed upon the Council table.* Most of the honourab.e members questions will be found answered in the report. The Committee contained representatives of the millowners, exporters and importers of cotton, jethavalas, brokers and growers of cotton, a representative of the Banking Community and had an official C hairman. Since the East India Cotton Association is constituted of all these interests except the growers and bankers, naturally a majority of the committee were also members of, or connected with, that association. The written evidence submitted to the Committee has not been published. The committee made no recommendation in this respect. The papers are very bulky and the publication would be costly. Govern ment have not been approached to publish them, and do not intend to do so, unless there is a general demand for it. It is not known whom the honourable member refers to as ‘ £ the Cotton Trade in general ”. There is a consensus of opinion from all the recogniz ed associations consulted that action should be taken on the general hues of the report. A Bill has accordingly been introduced in the current Sessions of the Council, and full opportunity will be given to the legislature to decide upon its course of action. No particular sum was sanctioned for the cost of the Committee. There were no costs except the travelling allowance to the growers representatives, payment of stenographers and the cost of printing, which amounted together to Rs. 1,700-4-0.* -v FILE COPTIC Z, ; ... r . r . ,, 5 3 SEP 1951 &lt; j n n b o i J 5 ei.ar titer.t, Bombay Uastie,5th August 1931 .

Governmerit of India are of opinion, sulcgect to minor reservations and to discussion in the Indian and Bombay Legislatures, that Aden should cease to form part of the Bombay Presidency and should be formed into a Chief Commissionership under the direct control of the Central Government. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The question of the transfer of responsioiliiy for the civil administration of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India was first raised by Sir Stewart Symes in 1828 (see discussion on P.5810/28) and has been actively urged by him on various occasions since (see e.g. his memorandum on P.4492/29 and in particular Paragraphs 4 and 5 of his letter to the Government of India of the 31st January 1931 on P.Z. 1403/31 flagged. The Government of India at an early stage expressed their concurrence informally in the Resident's proposal* and ashed the Government V nress i* forward after sounding local of Bombay to preso political opinion if they considered it advisable. Consequent on this an arranged question (see 44,75b 1000 5.307297/29) was/put down in the Bombay Legislative Council in Augus t 1929 with a view to provoking discussion - in which, it was not success:-u... * Masters have rested at this point until now* H, The Government of India have now definitely reached the conclusion that transfer of the control of Aden to theCentral Government is desirable* The arguments by which they propose to commend this change to local opinion in the Bombay Presidency and by which it is substantially justifiable, are set out in the memorandum of which copies are enclosed in their letter of 19th May to the Government of Bombay now submitted, and which it is proposed o use as a method of eliciting unofficial opinion and disarming potential opposition before arrangements are made for the discussion in the Legislative Assembly and in the Bomoay Legislature, whi^T Government previously agreed shall x cke place before any alteration in the present position is made. « The case for the transfer now proposed is a ery stron 6 one (see especially on this point Mr .Walton's note cf 8th April 1931 on P.Z.1403/31 flagged) and it is to he hoped that local politics! difficulties in Bomba;/ will not prove sufficiently serious to make the dvernment o* India reconsider their view. The Colonial Office, who have been sounded unofficially and who are of coarse indirectly concerned in the new administrative arrangements at Aden, are I think satisfied that acceptance of the Government of India's proposal would substantially ease the position from their point of view by reducing the number of authorities concerned with431 Sb 2000 2.30 Officers Minute Paper. Department. w i^ 11 q.uestion and eliminating a number of references v/hich serve no really useful purpose. They were at first apprehensive that the Government of India's suggestion (end of paragraph 2) that Aden should he formed into st Chief* OoTiiinissicnership ’’under the direct control of the Government of India” was me ant to involve abrogation of the existing arrangement under which the Colonial Office have a right to nominate, as a general rule, alternate Residents and to be given an opportunity of expressing an opinion even when it is India’s turn to fill this post. I made it clean that so far as we t were aware nothing of the sort was in contemplation, that the arrangements agreed between Lord Birkenhead and Mr. Amery in 1929 would continue to hold good, and that the only effect of the proposed alteration would be to a large extent to cut out the Government of Bombay. ^ Three points call for comment:- (a) One cf the conditions on which the Government of India are prepared to take over Aden is that Aden shall continue to look as m the past to the Bombay Government 'for a supply of officers and administrative personnel'. The reference is presumably to personnel other than the Resident and the Political Officers serving under him. Thus Bombay would find the superintendent and Assistant . + n-e Police the I.C.S.Officer Superintendent o_ Poll • , j /i T-”rM r*i pl Ass isf anf, and who is employed ae Judicial a i guc h of the lower staff as it was necessary .. orovid* *« »“*• «•Officers (other of course than the Protectorate Secretary, and the political officers specially appointed for duty in the Protectorate, who will continue to be drawn fro*n the Colonial Service) would , as at present, be found from the general list of the Political Department. Bombay is cleanly in much the best position to provide staff of the nature in question and it is to beftioped that the \ local Government will not make difficulties over this point. (b) The important question raised in the last paragraph of the Government of Indian letter of the method by which the change is to be brought about in the event of its being approved. This must to some extent turn, as the Government of India recognise, on the course of the discussions in the Legislatures and With non-official representatives. Prima facie, however, the balance of advantage would seem definitely to lie with tdking action ultimately as an executive measure under the provisions of the present Government of India Act, rather than referring the question to the Round Table Conference. | (c) I am not very clear to what extent the | Secretary of State is likely or may expect to be consulted. We have been kept in close touch with the developments of the discussion by copies of correspondence, and so far as the Secretary of State (and for that matter the Colonial Office also) is concerned, there is no reason to dissent from, and every reason to support, the administrative changes under consiaeration. On the othei^hand these changes axe^suhstantial5|rV*mrt**»**W i n principle it would seem desirable that theMinute Paper. 4,7&lt;J3A 5000 10.30 Department. Section 59 of the Government of India Act provides that 'the Governor-General in Council may, with the approval of the Secretary of State and by notification, take any part of British India under the immediate authority and management of the Governor-General in Council, and thereupon give all necessary orders and directions respecting the administration of that part by placing it under a Chief CoramisBicmer, or by otherwise providing for its atininistration'. I suggest in the light of Mr. Carter's minute that we might perhaps telegraph as in the draft now attached. The Legislative Assembly met last year in July, but I understand there is no regular fixed date. The Bombay Legislative Council appears normally to meet in July (last year it met so early as the 7th. but in previous years towards the end of the month). In view of the shortness of time and the possibility that it may be desired to deal with the matter very urgently in India, we had better give the Government of India a freer hand than would otherwise be the case. 7 4 i- A ^ v. ^ 7 4, S lA ^ 1 ^ if U &lt;/- it Art a i *Draft Paper.

Concrete returns for these services mi^ht o© slow but would be cumulative and extensive. Inula* e interest in them w ula be chiefly commercial (Traffic }i M.M.G*©, political lRelations). Traffic and Relations are obviously inter-depedent and form a convenient channel of political influence. An ideal organisation of these services at Aden would satisfy all local (Settlement} needs and be capable of expansion j6to meet demand© from the protectorate and Southern iemen. tfinanci&amp;l provision for the former is an Indian and for the latter mainly a British liability. 3. Before discussing questions of administration it is advisable to note the social and economic evolution of the ‘iettlement since the British occupation of Aden in 1839. A small, primitive Ar&amp;b fishing hamlet was then converted to a fortress and has since * become a port of refuge and transit, a commercial and, to the extent of its 'alt Workings, an industrial centre. Mainly from the Interior and neighbouring countries has come the human miscellany - Arab, Indian, Somali, etc. * that could subsist in u modern sea-port; and the Settlement now has a resident population of 56, 000*. Of this population, exclusive of SuropeansIndians engaged with transportation services and trade - who, jointly, h^ve created Aden in a commercial sense - approximately 60^ ib composed of Arabic-speaking Hoalema, Their presence at Aden facilitate* the problems of traffic and relations * ith neighbouring peoples, their kindred in race or religion. They also constitute an element which may oe expected to survive an exuaus occasioned by decline in the prosperity of the port, ihis decline, although not very apparent, is conceivable. It is true that Shipping return© are satisf: ctory and fuelling business prosperous. On the other hand a formerly thriving transit trade is feeling competition by neighbouring ports. notably in respect of Cotton goods, coffee, hides and skins,ana the local market vith the Hinterland is stationery. Possible remedies are through development of local markets and a Judicious increase in the resident Arab population, by stimula tion of local and native industries and the achievement of better communications and political conditions in the Pro tec to rat Thus the permanent attachment of a native resident population to Aden would be secured and could serve commercial as well as Imperial interests. Among its members conceptions of Aden a© the home of a settlad and civilized community have already emerged. Its composition is too heterogeneous to be Nationalist or, e s yet, keenly communal in spirit. Its immediate pre occupations are with profit, not politic®. It is, both culturally and politically, a vary backward com.aunity. iiever- theleea its complexion and aepirations are dietinclively Arabic. Indianiaation it would accept only to toe extent that inula My be -British. It has little sympathy with Indians ae such, and entirely ignores their * a tiunal and political aspirations. It is as definitely pro-British as any oriental population I have met. 44 # To advert to Atiaainiatrntion f the system at Aden^ i©fleeting changes in local conditions f has developed from martial law to 'cantomaent rule* 4 and the inception oi an ordinary civil administration# The local Civil executive oil leer is vestea with wide powers* and has British assistants who perform judicial, secretarial and political iunctions, a British commandant of police and a (part-time) C#A#M*Oi Subordinate and departmental offices are firmed by Indian corn oificers# There are two organs of local government* the Port Trust - a statutory body; rnia the settlement Committee, a quasi-municipality# A British technical officer of the (Bombay) P.'«#D# acts as Chairman to ooth bodies t each has a nominated non-oificial majority# This system has given satisfactory results and, provided the present quality of British and Indian personnel is maintained, requires no drastic modification# Aden is too small for a self-contained government of the Colonial type# It has derived notable benefit© from its connexion with -oritish India and has every advantage in retaining this connexion so long as development of its natural entity is not prejudiced thereby. But Aden’© present status as part of the Bombay Presidency (while dependent for several essential services on the Government of India) complicates local organisation and finance, tend prevents the comprehensive treatment of its ail airs which geographical isolation and its pecuiia- c ire am stances require. And, apart from administrative convenience or financial benefits, preservation of the nexus of imperial - British and Indian - purpose© and reconciliation of interests - sometimes conflicting - as between Indian m&amp; Arab elements in the population require elimination of provincial control (and legislature) and direct access to the Government of India. The treatment of Aden as an Imperial - not a provincial asset and its development as a semi-detached unit can then proceed;_ roe©sxi* An initial oaeasuxe would toe the separation of Auen* a acc unts oi revenue and expenditure and their presentation in a local budget which v^ould reveal the financial state and thus iac ill late allocation of available fun a a and their economical expenditure* 3ventuai 1 y it should toe possible to provide for expenditure on the Protectorate as woli as in the Settlement in a single budget to toe balanced toy contributions by the Indian and dritisli treasuries, assessed in relation to Political and Civil requirements. 9 5* Che foregoing considerations lend, i submit, to the following deduct ions il ia} Imperial purposes - a joint concern of the British and Indian Governments - can be promoted by * drain is t* ative development of Aden as a semi-detached unit under the Government of India. (to) It is essential to tnis development, and would toe politically advantageous, to extend the organisation and raise the standards of local administrative services, particularly police, medical and educational. (c) The increased coat of services, to the extent that they are required to satisfy extra-settlement and political requirements, will form a reasonable charge against British funds. (d) The successful achievement of (a) and (to) is dependent on British control and maintenance of the present number and quality of British ofiicers (including a Judicial oifleer) in the local administration. To supplement their efforts the best available Indians (on deputation) are required for technical offices, inor posts may increasingi/ be filled oy local recruits. 6. as regard© the financial results of these proposals I can only give a rough approximation &amp;e 1 have not been able to obtain the requisite date for an exact estiaate. I understand the cost oi military garrison at Aden, which wee formerly about db30,000, will be reduced, under Air Ministry control, to about £300,000. Gross receipts from Men by Indian revenues are about 8 iaidis of dupees. Future recurrent expenditure on administration i estimate to be about 12 lattis, leaving a deficit of 4 lakhs, or £30,000, toto be provided by Inula* The coat of the Protectorate paid t rosi Colonial Office vote* will recaain at its present figure of about £50,000* 7* Xn diecu sing policy i h^tve assumed that present relations, political ana social, betneen the (Municipal} unit of Me:, and the Protectorate will regain unchanged. That is ts far f,&amp; it ie safe to anticipate immealately, fut it v»ill be eviaent that a successful evolution of our Protectorate system resulting in any considerable economic development in the Interior might strengthen political relationship and lead to Aden becoming an administrative capital as ueli rs the metropolis oi its Hinterland and the Hadhramaut. It ^ould be short sighted, at the present stage, absolutely W ignore this contingency.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003a6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1444</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003a6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1444</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/2 'Administrative policy: arrangements for achievement of Imperial purposes at Aden; transfer of administration to Government of India (from Government of Bombay)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1932</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-24T23:29:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (436 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 436; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
