The leather cover wraps around the documents; the back of the cover has not been foliated.A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists almost entirely of copies (forwarded by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Under-Secretary of State for India) of printed reports sent either by the His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan, succeeded by Sir Reader William Bullard), or, in the Minister's absence, by His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill, succeeded by Albert Spencer Calvert), to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Most of the reports cover a two-month period and are prefaced by a table of contents. The reports discuss a number of matters relating to the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd (later Saudi Arabia), including internal affairs, frontier questions, foreign relations, the Hajj, and slavery.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000263#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000263#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000263#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
