Dear Sir itUpert, I understand that Morris who was formerly in charge of the American Independent Oil Company in Kuwait signed a contract with Yusef Humaizi, a Kuwaiti merchant, for lighterage in the Neutral . Kone. Apparently Humaizi called in an Iraqi, Syed Hassan Naqib of Basra, who brought down a tug and five barges. When the Sheikh heard of this he was much annoyed and the American Independent Oil Company tell me that Humaizi’s contract has been cancelled with 30 days notice. I am at present of course rather cut off from the Neutral £one but the last news I had was that one barge had broKen adrift and that the tug was high and dry. 8. Allcard of Gray Mackenzies has discussed this question with me because he is anxious to provide lighterage in the Neutral '/.one and we agreed that the best policy was for Gray Mackenzie to propose a working arrangement with the Kuwait Landing Company which is a local firm in touch with the American Independent Oil Company. Allcard spoke to the Sheikh at a morning majlis and offered his company’s services and equipment. The Sheikh was not respon- ive and I have suggested to Allcard that uhe next time he broaches the matter he should do so privately and not in open majlis. 3.

THE POLITICAL AGENCY, Z^r KUV/AIT. 14th July, 1949. Dear Sir Ru-pert, Please refer to your confidential letter No.52/57/49 of the 4th July, 1949. 2. 1 understand from Southwell that he has already made it clear to the American Independent Oil Company that the Kuwait Oil Company will pursue a good neighbour policy towards the American Indepen dent Oil Company and that they expect them to do the same • 3. I agree that there will be some scope for consultation in respect of labour. The Kuwait Oil Company are not unduly worried about their Arab labour. As their housing programme proceeds they will be redu cing their local labour force; and they hope to retain what they require by good conditions of work and by the proximity of their work to Kuwait. They recognize the worker's right to work where he likes and do not wish to put any obstacles in the way of free transfer between the two companies. 4. They are not so happy, however, about their Indian staff and fear that having gone to a good deal of expense to get them here they may resign and re engage locally with the American Independent Oil Company. If the Kuwait Oil Company cannot prevent this by mutual arrangement, we could perhaps help when the time comes. 5. The Kuwait Oil Company may be rut under pressure by the Shaikh to give the American Independent Cil Company certain facilities which they could not give without hampering their own operations. If they are so pressed, we should use our influence to shield them. 6. What I think ip also likely to be an embarrass ment is the fact that McPherson has had his experience in Arabia with the Arabian American Oil Company and has perhaps come to regard Ibn Saud’s dominance over the Arabian Ameri can Oil Company and his constant interference with them as the natural and right order of things. We intend, by insisting on observance of the Political Agreement, to curtail the Shaikh's tendency to bounce the Kuwait Oil Company into doing many things that should be a proper charge on his own administration; and we shall have to insist on equally strict observance of the Political Agreement by the American Independent Oil Company to prevent competi tive pandering to the Shaikh. If we do not, w?e sliall very soon/ H.E.

At the same time, in certain respects the Arabian American Oil Company^ record - particularly, I am informed, in the steps they have taken to train local men as artizars - has been exemplary; and healthy rivalry between the two organizations in social schemes that can properly be undertaken by Oil Companies should be of advantage. What should be undertaken by Oil Companies and what are proper charges on the Shaikh*s administration is for us to decide.

In conversation with Jackson and with Jordan of the K.O.C. I also touched on the question of arrange ments between the K.O.C. and ANINCO with regard to the common or co-ordinated use of facilities in Kuwait and possibly also with regard to labour problems. I under stood from Jordan that there was already a certain amount of contact with regard to communications and that his attitude was that as K.O.C. were the party in occupation, it was for AMINCO to accroach them if they wished to do so on labour and other questions. We shall be glad to know in due course whether you feel that anything further is required in this direction. We do not want to interfere unnecessarily in the compa nies* operations, but there seems likely to be considerable scope for consultation between them, particularly with regard to labour problems and it may be that an occasional word from us would help to facilitate this.

Following for V/HIOHT from BURROWS. I had short talR at Bahrain about Saudi frontiers with United States Ambassador Jedda and Scott-Fox just before leaving to come here. Hay may be reporting separately. Following are my purely personal reflections:- This is n&gt;._ l_ just a dispute between oil compadies. Our whole position in the Gulf risics being seriously weakened by (a) Saudi encroachments (b) notable increase in slave trade in and through Sheikhdoms under our protection (c) general lawlessness and lack of security in interior of Oman. There are proposals for dealing with (b) and (c) which I will discuss on my return but they cannot possibly produce immediate results. Meanwhile/J —s Meanwhile if as a result of unsuccessful frontier negotat- ions we had to cede areas which we and Sheikhs have always regarded as their this would be a serious blow to us coming on top of factors mentioned above. Saudies seam lively to adopt very tough attitude, whatever may be their motives, and United States Government will find it difficult to resist Saudi and AEAMCO appeals to take their side. If we are to avoid serious frontier concessions we must therefore throw in all we have got as maKeweight - i.e supply of arms, continuation of Tflilitary and civil air missions, a much mol?e forthcoming attitude on the Saudi proposals for a treaty, and, best of all perhaps, some more positive reassurances about the Hash- emites that we have hitherto been ready to give. 2 . I expect we must now show willingness in principle to negotiate on frontiers but it would be better not to get deeply involved in negotation until we know how far we can go on points mentioned above provided that oil companies agree to '* moratorium’ 1 meanwhile. 3 # Moreover if we could concert our attitude on the treaty closely with the Americans there might be less danger of their siding with Saudis on the frontiers. We are unlikely to get much further with the Americans on the treaty at least until Mr. dhilds goes to Washington in August.SECRET 52/51/4S 18th May, 1949. ll ' I understand that Burrows discussed v;ith you in general terms the future adminis tration of the Neutral Zone.

Jackson The Political Kuwait.kP*IW SaBf m No. 81 2^6/2/49 CL PY British Embassy, JEDDA. SECRET 21st April, 1949. GIURD Sir, When Sir W.R. Hay passed through Jedda on tour a few days ago, he brought me a copy of his secret telegram to you of the 25th March last No.lSL, concerning the latest developments connected with oil exploitation in the Saudi-Kuweit Neutral Zone. I was also glad to have the opportunity of discussing that matter with him in its general aspects. I take this opportunity of mentioning that I am in complete agreement with the suggestion made by hifii in paragraph 5 of his despatch to you No.172(59/47/43) of the SCth December 1948. The Saudi Arabian Government have not so far approached me in this matter but it seems to me most desirable that the exact situation of the frontier should be deter mined as far as possible, even though, for reasons unknown to me, one of the representatives of American Independent til Company named Morris is reported in the telegram referred to above to oppose that plan. 2. My American colleague has already raised the question with me and at his request I showed to a member of his staff the text of the Kuwaiti Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922 and article 5 of the unratified Anglo Turkish Agreement of 1912: he already possessed Aitchison's “Treaties Engagements and Sanads“ Vol.XI, and I therefore had only to direct him to pages 213 and 266 of that work. I explained that I possessed no copy of the map referred to in article 5 of the latter Agreement. The official concerned drew my attention to the words 'until through the good offices of the Government of Great Britain....' which occur in the 1922 Convention. I understand that the report which Mr. Childs sent to the State Department in this matter was factual, but I expect that in some way or other our good offices will be invoked fairly soon. The signing of the agreement between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Pacific Western Lil Company concerning the Saudi undivided share of the Neutral Zone increases the urgency of this question and many others, some of which I propose to allude to in this despatch. 3. The administration of the Neutral Zone is perhaps the most important of these questions in practice. Mr. Childs tells me' that he raised it with Fuad Hamza during his recent visit to Riyadh. Fuad had suggested to him that some kind of ex territorial regime should be established in the ^cne. ihis suggestion brought to my mind the three agreements of April 1942 between this country and Kuwreit; on reading them through I find that the clause which is most relevant to Fuad Hamza's suggestion is Article 8 of the Extradition Agreement. It has also been suggested that the Zone should be divided, by mutual arrangement, by an east-west line through the m-Ludle, so that Kuweit could administer the northern part and Saudi Arabia the southera. 4. A small point, which may perhaps give rise to a good deal of friction, is the very extraordinary wording of Article ~7 oi the Pacific Western concession : it says 'the Company shalx ily the flag of Saudi Arabia within the Neutral Zone'. I have not yet received a copy of the American Independent Gil Company's concession of the 28th June 1948 but even it is contains a similar /provision # The Right Honourable C.R. Attlee, M.C., D.P., etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.?4 w provision about that company*s flying the Kuv.’eiti flag I fear that there may be some acrimonious argument about flags: and if there is no such article in the Kuweit concession I fear the argument may be even more acrimonious. I understand that Article 37 was put in by the Egyptian lawyer employed by the Saudi Arabian Government, AhmedTaufiq. 5. It may perhaps be of interest if I draw attention in this despatch to a philological point: the word ’’quraih' seems to me to be the diminutive of the word ,, qarn ,, one of the meanings of which is 'a horn n : can it therefore be possible that the mountain alluded to by one of the surveyors bears at its top a protuberance which resembles a little horn? It seems at any rate more likely that the word would apply to a mountain than to a well. 6. In conclusion I would mention that this post does not appear to possess a copy of the map annexed to article 5 of the 1913 agreement. Nor have we a copy of the 1936 War Office map, though we possess a War Office map (1/1,000,000) M.D.R. 1/388 P 104) dated at the War Office 1938, revised 1941, (Basfca sheet (North H 38) which I presume will do equally well. I shoulc be grateful if I might be supplied with a copy of the 1913 map if Ig, possible: and as I have not yet received the text of the Aminco agreement signed on the 28th June, 1948, about the Kuweit oil interest in the Neutral Zone, I should be grateful to be supplied with a copy of that also. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the British Middle East Office and to Sir Rupert Hay. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble, servant, SGD. A.C.
