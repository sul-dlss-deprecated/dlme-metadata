Kuwait Area Whilst conducting W/T tests with Bahrein recently I int ere exited a message quoting an Independent Oil Company vhich was apparently negotiating with the Sheikh of Kuwait for an oil concession in the Neutral Zone, south of the territory of Kuwait. Local enquiries at Karachi with friends of the Burma Oil Cojiroany gave me only very scanty information as this proposed new oil company was not associa ted with the usual two major oil groups. I therefore pursued this matter during my recent visit to Kuwait as new oil exploration parties in an area devoid of port facilities etc. would obviously require communications from the comnencement of their operations. The Independent Oil Company formed in July 1947 with an authorised capital of 100 , 000,000 dollars to operate in this new area is entirely American consisting of the following ten independent American Oil Companies:- 1. Phillips Petroleum Company. 2. Signal Oil and G-as Conpany. 3 . Sunray Oil Corporation. 4 . Hancock Oil Company. 5. Globe Oil and Refining Company. 6. Deeprock Oil Company. 7. Ashland Oil and Refining Company. 3. Allied Oil Company. 9. J.S. Abercombie Conopany. 10. Lario Oil and Gas Coup any. (independent■ n (independent Oil lias been forced for the purposes 01 developing oil resomrces in the lEiddle East). These Companies have conbined assets of over 750*000,000 uollars. Their annual volume of business exceeds 500,000,000 dol].ars and their earnings per year approximate 75 &gt; 000,000 dollars. These corn allies are combined in support of American Inaep enden u Oil Company as joint undertaking not only as to financiers but as go operators and resources as well. Their high cor.^petence and business success is well estaolished in tne United States. President of the Company is E.K. Davies, well known as operating nead of the Petroleum Administration, United States Federal Government throughout the war with extensive experience in large scale oil operations, domestic and foreign. I have known of the competition for this concession since early 1946. when I met the Chairman of the Iraq Petroleum Company at Kuwait at thao time. In the case of the American Conpany, the initial offer to the SheiKn o± - Kuwait was 4,250,000 dollars purely for a concession to explore the area. This was subsecjuently increased to a sum of 8,000,000 dollars guaranteed cash payment which the Sheikh of Kuwait accepted. Concession was signed on the 28th June 19^- Although the terms of the Concession have not been published, I am given to 'understand on very good authority that these are as follows: — 1. An initial payment to the Sheikh of Kuwait oi b,000,000 dollars in cash. 2. An annual payment of 625 &gt;000 dollars each year until oil is discovered and produced. 3. When oil is produced the Sheikh is to receive a royalty of 2 dollars 57 cents per ton. I have been informed that clause 3 breaks the 'Gentlemen’s Agreement' entered into by all other Oil Companies in the Kiddle East whereby they agreed that the maximum royalty they would pay would be 1 dollar 25 cents perHHHHKHHHHHHHHHHgjHMHi mhMMI per ton. For this reason it is certain that other Oil Corapanies look upon i&gt;ne Independent Oil Company as rather underhand operators in the oil world. I was unable to ascertain the actual area of proposed operations but I think io most likely that if search is made in the interior an establishment 3^1 administrative nature will be set up near the coast where port lacilioies will be surveyed and subsequently provided. I have instructed our lianager to keep me advised regarding developments t.ach as decided location and date of commencement. I have also instructed nim to press enquiries regarding telecommunications which will be necessary for uhis Company and that we should make every endeavour to provide some sort of circuit immediately on request as I have reason to believe that the activities of this Company will be considerable within a short period from the commencement of their exploration. Exploration parties using the 'Refraction' and 'Reflection' methods are to be utilised and are now being organised in the United States. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) H.

I enclose (a) a copy of the Company’s letter of the 30th June in which their new proposals are detailed and (b) a diagram which illustrates those proposals. They can be divided into three stages. 1* The formation of a second Fao-Bahrein cable by using sections of the existing Fao-Bushire and Bushire-Muscat cables rendered redundant by the closing of Bushire. This proposal would bring back to. service cable which would otherwise’ be useless. Despite the fact that this is only a stop gap arrangement, that our concession at Fao is precarious and that new lengths of cable may prove to be required, we are inclined to think that it would be a wise precaution to put this work in hand.

Replace the two Fao-Bahrein cables from Sta^e 1 by a Pao-Kuwait-Bahrein cable, v;hen new cable 160011165 available 3 at an approximate cost of £120 &gt; 000» The background of this proposal is that the Company have a twenty-year wireless concession at Kuwait. sn^€i nave - recently begun to operate, by means of a rather decrepit overhead land-line, the Kuwait-Basra service formerly Ttv-. *viw£&gt;tb H* cvnkrol of Che UX P.D.

Dear Townshend, PEHSIAII GOLF CABINS. A decision to discontinue both cable and wireless working at Bush ire has led us to give some further consideration to future arrangements of the cables in the Persian Gulf* You will recollect that the B*J*C*B* said in connection with the Persian Gulf cables that: *The essential service interest can therefore be considered to have been met for so long as the Muacat-Bahrain and Bahrain-Fho cable coranunication are available* * and they also stated that the/ would be seriously concerned and would like to be consulted before any action was taken to discontinue the Gulf cables We are in the difficulty that these cables are very old and heavy costs mist be incurred in renewals if there is to be any hope of their being maintained in reasonably good condition* With the programme of work ahead we see little chance of Ibis being done at an early date, and we have therefore looked at the matter from the point of view of what can be done to maintain satisfactory communications comaercially while at the same time going as far as possible towards maintaining the strategic aspects in the cable services* Commercially it is doubtful whether the cable route as a whole is worth retaining, as it has been interrupted for over nine months and the * * service/ H. Townshend, Esq., C.B.service hy this iseans has been very poor for sene wireless service has been aaintained throughout, and it could be that with the extensions which have been aade and those still in progress an adequate service could be afforded to the area. Th* Bate consideration at the manent la the aafelopmesrt of the oil resources in the Gulf, and as you are aware we have no wireless stat *^ in Iraq. The Iraquian wireless service to Egypt is poor and in f**?*^**^ we get oonaiderablecable traffic from Iraq for the world as a whole. It amounts to something like £1if,000 per annua. «• would propose, therefore, that ee soon ae a repair J.® available ee should use the Fao-Bushire end part of the '^re-Musra cables to fom a Bahrsin-Fao cable thus giving two and one Muscat-BaJhraln. As soon thereafter “ ““* ’ we would lay a new Bahrain-IUwait-Fao cable and abandon the two old cablee between Bahrain and Fao. The cost of the new cable will be aoou^ £120,000. Bahrain can give a satisfactory wirsiess^ aerT i c ' v * 1 1 ? 1 1 the world and we can therefore ensure connection of the Gu lf to Ae of the ays ten by wireless and defer (for theprwfnt) .he hea^ expenditure on a new Muscat-Bahrain cable which the B.S.C.B. may consider essential froai a strategic point of view. The cost of such &amp; cable would be about £200,000.' If the strategic value of the whole cable route up the Gulf became highly important before a new Huscat-Bahrain ca ^ e put in hand in ordinary course, preference could then be given work elsewhere in order to have it completed* Tou may feel it is desirable to consult the various interested parties regarding the foregoing proposals, but we would be veiy glad STWcLf tohave your view, at a. early a date a, possiblesothat theroiewals oould be put in hand late in 1949* rm ^ B±n the old cables will probably be undertaken early next ^ear. lours sincerely.

Deer Chancery, ^ith reference to your despatch No.383 of the 27th September, we enclose herewith a copy of a letter of the 9th September from Cables and ''irelf=»ss Limited,outlining their proposals for the regularisation of the Company’s position in Persia and giving the proposed new set-up for the routeing of the Gulf cables. These proposals have been cleared with the Government Departments concerned, and in the main we think; they provide a basis for further discussion with the Persian Government. There are two points to which we should like to draw attention, we are net altogether happy about the proposal to establish direct cable communication between Bahrein and Bushire, as this may lead the Persians to raise the question of the status of Bahrein and to demand a renewal of the assurances that -uhe proposed Agreement does not prejudice the question, te wish to avoid any discussion of the status of Bahrein if possible. From the political point of view, if it is considered necessary and desirable to maintain cable communication between Bahrein and Bushire, it would be preferable for this to be done by way of Bahrein-Fao-Bushire rather than direct. The other point is that Cable and Wireless Limited are now prepared to give up their eraergancy wireless station at Bushire and to cut their staff by nearly a half. We have felt for some time that there was no justification for the continued use of this station contrary to the expressed wishes of the Persian Government. We have considered whether we should ask the Company to stop using the station forthwith until the new concession is signed but to do this would probably weaken our hand in obtaining the Persian Government’s agreement to the other points in the schema. Before entering into negotiations with the Persian Government we shall be glad to have your comments on the proposals as a whole with particular refer^ce to the proposed Bahrein-Bushire route. In the light of any observations you may have v/e will endeavour to send'you final instructions with the minimum delay and will, if you wish, arrange for Mr.Gott, the Company’s representative at Karachi, to come to Tehran to assist you in the negotiations. In the meantime, it might be as well to inform the Persian Government that his Majesty’s Government are alive to the necessity of reaching agreement on tnis question as soon as possible and that they are at present actively engaged in preparing a scheme which it is hoped will be acceptable to the * Persian Government. ^ .

As Cables &amp; Wireless point out, in the event of emergency the cables could be cut and joined through outside territorial waters to provide a fUlly-secure Bahrein - Fao link, as was done during the last war. The aohema proposed, therefore, appears to satisfy strategic requirements* it is flexible, to the extent that alternative circuits are available on all links in the event of cable breakdown, and with the Bushire - Bahrein link restored, it is a commercially sound proposition. Subject to your agreement we propose to forward our approval through the usual channels. v_. o BRITISH k iH JO 1 V' nn CHAIRMAN 4 INT COMMUNICATIONS BOARD. C onies to : D.Sigs.

The Company's plan of March last provided for Gulf coaaasinications on the basis shown in attachment A, i.e. single cables connecting Bahrain with Pao, Bajrain with Bushire and Bushire with Fao. It was nrop^sed that the Xarachi—Kuscat—Aden (Bibles should be operated but that the cables Muscat/Bahrain and Muscat/Bushire should be abandoned. Since that date, we have been informed that the Persians are anxious to conclude a fresh agreement with three new conditions namely:- (•) That the Company should cease to operate a wireless station at Bushire. (b) That the Peraian Government should exact fees for transit traffic handled by the Company at Bushire, and, (o) that the large office and staff of the Company at Bushire should be substantially reduced. . The Services' interests indicate the following cables an beina aesirable or essential: 0 Far o-Bahra in-Mus cat Fao-Bushire-Muscat• This is the system as routed at present. 7 *e have evolved a scheme which meets traffic requirements, safe guards coiamunicati on in the case of interruption, meets the j ersians un £ P°J nt and wili, we hope, satisfy the requirements of the B.J.C.B. honofo w«» mr** riM-l+A, m**Z*~. « 1 - _ a. j t ’ 'you to cables 'extended to~~Teher«ua''with relay at ’BusSre*arST thr^other^Bshrain/ Bushire Jointed through in normal conditions in the cable house at Bushire to one of the Bushire-Fao cables thereby making a B&amp;hrain/Fao * circuit/k INWARD TEL -O Allotted to External Departmen Copy^fco glerferoF'CodesT WORD CODE ora To Dated Received Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Secretary of State for India Bahrain, 19*00 hours, 12th August, 1947* 17*40 hours, I3th August, 1947.

I do not find the argument of the Gable and wireless Ltd. that their Divisional Manager must remain in Karachi because of the large number of Indians and Anglo-Indians employed by the Company very convincing, and it would appear more reasonable that the Company should have a special ofxicer in India to deal with the recruitment, welfare etc. of such employees. This however is a matter mainly of domestic concern to the Company and I shall be satisfied if the Company*s Manage^ in Bahrain is authorised to discuss with this Residency all Persian Gulf matters in vAiich the Company is concerned and is supplied with infoimation which will enable him to do this effectively. 3.

RHL.22117/4-7 CIRCULAR Colonial Office, Downing Street 1st June, 1947- Sir, EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OF THE COLONIES- I have the honour to address you on the subject of the transfer to public ownership of the shares of Cable and Wireless Limited and the effect of this transfer on the maintenance and operation of the external telecommunications services of those Colonies in which such services have for many years past been operated by the Company. 2. The steps which have led to the acquisition of the- shares of the Company by the United Kingdom Government are summarised in the White Paper Cmd. 68059 which was issued when the Cable and Wireless Bill was introduced in Parliament. A copy of that White Paper accompanied my circular note of the 26th April, 1946. Copies of the Cable and Wireless Act 1946, were enclosed in my circular note of the 2nd December, 1946c The appointed day under that Act was fixed as the 1st January 1947- On that date the balance of the shares of Cable and Wireless Limited passed into the ownership of the United Kingdom Government and the changes in the Board of Directors etc., notified in my circular saving telegram of the 14th January 1947 took place# 3- My circular saving telegram of the 18th March, 1947 contains the text of the statement v/hich was made in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 27th Febuary. It will be seen that Cable and Wireless Limited, will remain in being as a Government owned Company and will continue to own the assets and to operate the telecommunications services outside the United Kingdom apart from those to be owned a.nd operated by the respective National Bodies in the Dominions, .India and South /Rhodesi Co The Officer Administering the Government ofRhodesia. The practical effect, so far as the Colonies etc. are concerned, is that the private shareholder interests in the overseas telecommunications services have been eliminated but that the Company's organisation and staff in the Colonies will remain in being under United Kingdom Government ownership to operate and develop the telecommunications services hitherto operated by the Company. It is the intention of the United Kingdom National Body, namely the General Post Office in this country, through the new Government appointed Directors of Cable and Wireless Limited, to improve and develop the oversea telecommunications services of the Colonies; and to expand as rapidly as possible the oversea telephone links of the Colonies. Suggestions from the Colonial Governments as to the directions in which the external telecommunications services of the Colony or area might be improved or developed will be welcomed. 4* The Company also will be ready to assist Colonial Governments, so far as may be desired, to develop their own telecommunications services, including, if circumstances permit, the technical side of local broadcasting services and the provision of aeronautical wireless services. Co-ordination of all the telecommunication services operated by the local Government with those operated by Cabil.e and Wireless is most desirable and would no doubt result in economy* of equipment, buildings etc. , and of land required for sites for transmitting and receiving stations. I trust that the Governments of dp.1 Colonies will co-operate fully with the Company under its new ownership and management in the development of telecommunication services. For your information it may be added that the possibility of the closer integration of civil and service communication facilities is being examined in this country. 5. The new arrangements do not preclude the possibility of a Colonial Government itself acquiring the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited, in the Colony and assuming responsibility for the operation of /itsits own external telecommunications services, and if any Colonial Government should be desirous of doing this I shall be prepared to arrange for the matter to be considered in consultation with the General Post Office and Cable and Wireless Limited* It will, however, be appreciated that the external telecommunications of all Empire territories must be maintained and operated within the frame work of the telecommunications system of the Commonwealth and Empire and that the arrangements outlined in paragraph 10 of Cmd. 6805 for tho formulation of the joint telecommunications policy, including rates, and the co-ordination and development of the wireless and cable systems of the Commonwealth, through the Commonwealth Communications Council and later the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board must apply to the external telecommunications of all parts of the Empire, no matter by what Government, Public Utility Corporation, or other body particular services maybe operatede 6. in this connection you may be aware that in 1936, the then Secretary of State appointed Sir Claud Hollis, G. C. M. G. , C. B. E. , as representative of the Colonies etc. on the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee (now the Commonv/ealth Communications Council). Sir Claud Hollis continued to serve in that capacity until the 28th February, 1947* As from the 1st March, 1947 I appointed Mr. G.H. Webster, C.M. G. , 0. B. E. late Postmaster General, Palestine, to succeed Sir Claud Hollis as representative of the Colonies etc., on the Commonwealth Communications Council. A meeting of the Council was held in London from the 10th March to the 27th MSrch. Matters of direct interest to certain Colonial Governments were discussed at that meeting and separate communications are being addressed to the Officers Administering the Governments of the Colonies concerned.

PROPOSED TRANSFER TO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP i. Concurrently with the issue of this White Paper a Bill is being laid before Parliament to authorise the acquisition by His Majesty's Government of the shares in Cable and Wireless Ltd. not at present held by the Govern ment. Early History 2. The present organisation of the external telecommunications services of the British Commonwealth dates from 1928, when the position created by the competition between the beam wireless telegraph services and the submarine cable telegraph services came under review by the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference, 1928. The Report of this Conference was published in July 1928 as a White Paper (Cmd. 3163). The recommendations of the Con ference were approved by the Governments of the Commonwealth and as a result two companies were formed; one, now known as Cable and Wireless (Holding) Ltd., a merger company owning practically all the shares of the old cable companies and the Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company Ltd.; the other, now known as Cable and Wireless Ltd., an operating company with a capital of 30 million shares of £1 each holding all the communication assets of the above-mentioned wireless and cable companies, certain cables pre viously owned by the Governments of the Commonwealth, and a lease of the beam wireless stations in the United Kingdom then owned by the United Kingdom Post Office. 3. The organisation was framed on semi public utility lines. The 1928 Conference considered that, as the undertaking was one *vhich closely con cerned the several parts of the Commonwealth, the Governments, as the trustees for the public, should have a voice in the direction of policy, and that, as a corollary to handing over to private enterprise the conduct of public services, there should be an effective method for ensuring that the users of the service should not be exploited for the benefit of the shareholders in the private undertaking, while at the same time providing an incentive to the undertaking to improve and develop its services. The arrangements accordingly included the following provisions: (1) Two of the directors of Cable and Wireless Ltd. (the operating com pany), one being the Chairman, were to be approved by the United Kingdom Government. (2) Cable and Wireless Ltd. (the operating company) were required to consult, in regard to questions of policy as distinct from ordinary business and management, the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee (now the Commonwealth Communications Council), a body comprising repre sentatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, India and the Colonies. le Committee were given certain regulatory powers as to proposed increases in telegraph rates. (3) Any net revenue earned by Cable and Wireless Ltd. in excess of £1,865,000 a year (referred to as the standard revenue) was to be allocated a s to 50 per cent, to the Company for its own purposes, and 50 per cent, to reduction of rates or such other purposes as the Advisory Committee might approve. b . Cable and Wireless Ltd. did not however under the arrangements agreed 1? acquire th !, who A e 0i the telecommunications undertakings in the British Commonwealth At that time there existed wireless telegraph com panies (associated with Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company Ltd.) inCanada, Australia, South Africa and India, these organisations operating, inter alia, the distant ends of the beam wireless services. When Cable and Wireless Ltd. was formed these companies remained in being, and the terms of reference of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee did not cover them; certain telegraph services with Europe and the external telephone services of the United Kingdom were moreover reserved to the United Kingdom Post Office. The 1928 Conference recommended, however, that the Govern ments of the Commonwealth should take steps to apply the principles of the general scheme, with such modifications in points of detail as might be neces sary to meet local conditions, to the overseas telegraph undertakings operating within their jurisdiction. Since 1928, as the result of negotiations between Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the communications companies in the Dominions and India, the arrangements to-day are as follows:— Canada Cable and Wireless Ltd. operate the overseas cable services, the overseas wireless services being operated by the Canadian Marconi Company, over 50 per cent, of the shares of which are held by Cable and Wireless Ltd. A Joint Purse arrangement is in operation between the two companies. Australia Cable and Wireless Ltd. operate the overseas cable services, the overseas wireless services being operated by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, some 18 per cent, of the shares of which are held by Cable and Wireless Ltd and 51 per cent, by the Commonwealth Government. A Joint Purse arrangement is in operation between the two companies. New Zealand Cable and Wireless Ltd. operate the overseas cable services, the overseas wireless services being operated by the New Zealand Government. South Africa Both the overseas wireless and cable services are operated by Cable and Wireless of South Africa Ltd. This is the result of an agreement to amal gamate the wireless and cable services as from 1st October, 1930. Over 80 per cent, of the share capital of the South African Company is held by Cable and Wireless Ltd. The South African Company makes an annual payment to Cable and Wireless Ltd. for the use of its world-wide communi cations system, this payment being variable up or down in accordance with the gross receipts from traffic originating in South Africa. India Both overseas wireless and cable services are operated by the Indian Radio and Cable Communications Company Limited. This is the result of an agreement in 1932 to amalgamate the wireless and cable services. Some 75 per cent, of the share capital of the Indian Company is held by Cable and Wireless Ltd. The Indian Company makes a fixed annual payment to Cable and Wireless Ltd. for the use of its world-wide communications system, plus a sum representing one half of the Indian Company s net profits. Cable and Wireless Ltd. regard their holdings in the above-mentioned com panies as investments and do not attempt thereby to control the policy of the companies. t—' * •. wmm4 Re-organisation of 1938 5. The 1928 organisation was launched with high hopes, but the Company was hard hit by the serious contraction in international trade in 1930, and more over had to face foreign competition as the result of the opening of new direct wireless telegraph services competing with the services provided by the Com pany. These difficulties led to a review of the relationship between Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Governments of the Commonwealth, and certain important modifications were agreed which were described in a White Paper ^ issued in April, 1938 (Cmd. 5716).. These provided for the revenue of Cable and Wireless Ltd. being relieved of the annual rent charge of £250,000 by the transfer of the freehold of the beam wireless telegraph stations in the United Kingdom (which had been leased to the company by the United Kingdom Post Office in 1928), in return for an interest in the equity of the undertaking. The standard revenue of Cable and Wireless Ltd. was reduced from £1,865,000 a year to £1,200,000 a year. The interest of the United Kingdom Government in the equity of the undertaking was fixed at 2,600,000 £1 shares out of a total capital of 30 million shares; and the Commonwealth Governments in general re-affirmed their policy of according the system of Cable and Wireless Ltd. their support and co-operation. As part of these arrangements the Company agreed to an immediate and substantial reduction in Commonwealth telegraph rates, a maximum rate of is. 3d. per word being introduced. In the United Kingdom the necessary legislative sanction for these modifications was given by the Imperial Telegraphs Act, 1938. Developments during the War 6. The war brought new problems, and the volume of traffic was largely increased. This increase coincided with the interruption of certain cable routes, which in turn gave impetus to the establishment of direct wireless telegraph circuits, contrary to the general policy endorsed by the Governments of the Commonwealth in 1928 and 1938. Such circuits were opened between the United States and some of the Dominions, India and some Colonies, on the understanding that their operation was limited to the duration of the war and six months thereafter. Commonwealth Communications Council, 1944 7. The problems arising were given preliminary consideration at a conference held in Australia in 1942, at which most of the Commonwealth Governments were represented. The problems were more fully examined by the Common wealth Communications Council at its meeting in London in May, 1944. The Council considered that the time had come to make a fundamental change in the present organisation. I hey did not think it adequate for the needs of the Commonwealth telecommunications system. Although companies existed in the Dominions and India, the main instrument of Commonwealth telecommunica tions was Cable and Wireless Ltd., a United Kingdom Company owning a substantial interest in the capital of the local companies. The Council felt it was essential that the Dominions and India should have a greater share in the administration of the Commonwealth telecommunications system, with a view to its development as a whole on both the cable and the wireless sides. Moreover they considered that a Company largely commercial in structure, with obligations to private shareholders, might not be in a position to provide a service fully to satisfy public needs and strategic requirements. 8. The Council recommended the establishment of a series of public utility corporations in the United Kingdom, in each of the Dominions and in India, each corporation being owned by the local Government, but linked by an exchange of shareholding between the United Kingdom corporation on the(iv) the co-ordination and conduct of research; (v) negotiations with foreign telecommunication interests, if requested to undertake these by the Commonwealth Governments. Lastly, the Conference recommended a system of pooling revenue, details of which would be worked out by the Board. The essential feature would be that the Commonwealth organisations would pay their net revenues from overseas telecommunications services into a Central Fund to be administered,^^ by the Board. From this Fund would be met the expenses of the Board and, in certain circumstances, a contribution to the upkeep of the cable system, which would continue to be owned and maintained by the United Kingdom. The main object to be secured by these measures was a unification both of Government policy and financial interests which would enable the telecom munication systems of the Commonwealth to be developed as a whole, using both cables and wireless to the best advantage and without the artificial rout ing of traffic to which a divergence of cable and wireless interests naturally tends. n. The Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference was very conscious of the difficulties which the Commonwealth telecommumcation organisation will have to face in the next few years. They realised, however, that it would inevitably take a considerable time to establish the new organisation throughout the Commonwealth, and, in order to provide for the interim period pending the introduction of the full scheme, they suggested that the Governments of the Commonwealth should enter into an agreement providing firstly that the scope of the Commonwealth Communications Council should be extended to cover the Dominion and Indian organisations as well as Cable and Wireless Ltd.; secondly, that as many as possible of the responsibilities envisaged for the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board under the full scheme should be vested in the Commonwealth Communications Council and in particular that the Governments should endeavour to secure that the communication organisations in their territories should comply with any approved recommendations of the Council on the matters described in paragraph 10 above and should not enter into negotiations with foreign telecommunication interests on any major points except after consultation with and agreement of the Council; and thirdly, that measures should be taken to enable the Governments of the countries concerned to acquire ownership of the telecommunication interests in the Dominions and India at present owned by Cable and Wireless Ltd. Proposals for the future 12. The recommendations of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Con ference have been accepted by all the Commonwealth Governments repre sented at the Conference. The United Kingdom Government announced in Parliament on the ist November, 1945, that it accepted the recom mendations of the Conference so far as they affected this country, and that, subject to the agreement of Parliament, the overseas telecommunications services now operated by Cable and Wireless Ltd. would be transferred to public ownership. The Governments of the Commonwealth have been invited to enter into an agreement on the lines described in paragraph n above to cover the interim period, pending implementation of the full scheme. 13. The United Kingdom Government now propose to introduce legislation to enable it to acquire the shares of Cable and Wireless Ltd. (apart from the 2,600,000 £1 shares it already owns) and to provide for payment of com pensation to the shareholders. It is the Government’s intention to seek7 further Parliamentary approval later for the establishment of the Common wealth Telecommunications Board and the implementation of the scheme recommended by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference. 14. Ihe relations between the Cable and Wireless group of companies and the Commonwealth Governments are regulated by an agreement (known as the Treasury Agreement and published as Cmd. 3338) entered into in 1929 ^between the Governments of the Commonwealth and the companies concerned in the general merger. Some of the provisions of that agreement will be rendered inappropriate or inapplicable by the acquisition of the shares in Cable and Wireless Ltd. by the United Kingdom Government. It is accord ingly proposed formally to repeal the Treasury Agreement of 1929 in so far as it concerns the rights and obligations of Cable and Wireless (Holding) Ltd. and the old wireless and cable companies. This does not mean, however, that all the obligations of the Holding Company and the old wireless and cable companies to Cable and Wireless Ltd. itself would be cancelled. The companies concerned entered into agreements in 1929 providing inter alia for the supply of goods and services at reasonable prices and the availability of patent rights. The formal repeal of the Treasury Agreement would not involve any modification of these other agreements. The principal changes in the position of the Holding Company and the old wireless and cable companies are as follows:— (i) The Holding Company will no longer be required to hold at least 60 per cent, of the shares in the old wireless and cable companies. (Clause 1.) (ii) The requirement that the Boards of the Holding Company, of Cable and Wireless Ltd., and of the old wireless and cable companies should be identical will cease to apply (Clause 16). 15. The repeal of the Treasury Agreement as it affects the Holding Company and the old wireless and cable companies will not affect the position of Cable and Wireless Ltd. as the operating company, and the rights and obligations of that company under the Treasury Agreement will remain. It is, however, proposed to make an agreement with the new Board of Cable and Wireless Ltd. to provide for certain changes as follows in the Treasury Agreement:— (i) Under Clause 17 of the Agreement the Chairman and one of the Directors of Cable and Wireless Ltd. are to be approved by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. This provision Will become unnecessary because as the result of the transfer of the shares the Treasury will be responsible for the appointment of the new Board. (ii) Under Clause 18 of the Agreement membership of the Commonwealth Communications Council consists of one representative of each of the Commonwealth Governments and one representative of the Colonies and the Protectorates. Experience has shown that it would be desirable that the Chairman of the Council should not be representative of any individual country, but be in a real sense an independent Chairman. It is proposed to modify the Agreement accordingly. (iii) Under Clause 23 of the Agreement the expenses of the Commonwealth Communications Council have been met by a grant from Cable and Wireless Ltd. The Governments have agreed that as from 1st April, 1946, this arrangement should cease and the expenses of the Commonwealth Com munications Council should be met by the Governments themselves. The Treasury Estimate for 1946 accordingly makes provision for the United Kingdom contribution towards the expenses of the C ommonwealth Communications Council.(49838) Wt. 1070—1934 4/46 D.L. Gp. 390 8 16. In conclusion, reference should be made to the agreement reached between countries of the Commonwealth and the Cnited States at the It ^ communications Conference held in November and December, 1945, at Bermuda. The line to be followed at this Conference had been discussed at the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference in the summer of I 945 ' Full agreement was reached between the countries of the Commonwealth and the United States on outstanding telecommunication questions. 17. The Bermuda Agreement provides for substantial reductions in telegrapl^ rates between certain countries of the Commonwealth and the United States, and contemplates the eventual introduction of a world ceiling telegraph rale of is. 6d. per word, subject to the agreement of foreign administrations, i ru. Agreement includes a statement of the principles to be adopted in determining whether a direct wireless telegraph circuit should be established between two countries, the intention being that this statement should be presented for consideration at the next International Telegraph Conference. Broadly the proposal is that such circuits should be opened when justified by traffic or service needs, and the adoption of the principles suggested would enable the problems referred to in paragraph 6 above to be very largely met. Ihe countries represented at the Bermuda Conference recognised the impoitam strategic role which cables play in a co-ordinated telecommunications system, and agreed that to secure the optimum development of telecommunication services, research and development work in both cable and radio communica tion is essential. 18. The present Bill is a necessary step towards the implementation by the United Kingdom of the Bermuda Agreement. The United Kingdom Govern ment regards the Agreement as a settlement likely to be of immediate benefit to the peoples of the Commonwealth and of the United States, and as a valuable contribution towards the settlement of world telecommunication problems. This view is fully shared by the Governments of the Dominions and India.lb Jl (fliAts /jP (fk^A&lt;^4lA/d Jt Cable and Wireless Limited (Future) Mr. Wyatt asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether any decision has yet been reached about the future of Cable and Wireless Limited. Mr. Dalton: Yes, Sir. Cable and Wire less Limited will remain in being as a Government owned company and will con tinue to own the assets and to operate the telecommunication services outside the United Kingdom, apart from those to be owned and operated by the respective National Bodies in the Dominions, India and S. Rhodesia as decided at the recent Commonwealth Telecommunications Con ference. Staff of the U.K. system working overseas will be employees of the Com pany. All the assets in the United King dom will be transferred to the Post Office and the services integrated with those of the Post Office. The Company, as thus reconstructed, will work in close association with the Post Office. The Post Office will become the United Kingdom National Body, for the purpose of the arrangements agreed with the Partner Governments at the Common wealth Telecommunications Conference in 1945. Further legislation will be neces sary to put the new arrangements into effect, and it is not expected that they will be in force before 1949. In the mean time, the Company will continue tc operate as at present, under the Board of Directors recently appointed by the Government. The Commonwealth Communications Council, which consists of representatives of the Partner Governments, is meeting in London at the beginning of March, when arrangements will be discussed for the exercise by the Council of as many as possible of the functions of the Common wealth Telecommunications Board, pend ing the establishment of the Board on the lines indicated in the White Paper (Cmd. 6805).

Dear Department, r _ Reference is made to Teheran's letter| of 30th March, on the subject of the renew Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd concession in Persia. ♦he — 30 5 o The three particular points brought up by the Persian authorities hau been explained to the Wnbassy by an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and as the technical implications were not entirely clear, some further discussion was held with the technical branch of the Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department. The following information is therefore given in amplification of the previous letter. 1) The closing of the Company's wireless station. It was not clear whether this implied complete cessation of the Company's wireless activities, but the Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department confirmed this was the intention. Asked what was to happen in the event of an interruption to the cable circuit to Bahrein (a not infrequent occurrence), the Department replied that the civil wireless station at Bushire would take over the traffic from Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd, adding that as their own equipment at Bushire was rather old, it would be a very convenient arrangement for them to take over the existing equipment belonging to the Company.' 2) Royalties on traffic transiting Bushire. It was not clear why this point was being stressed so strongly, particularly as there was an alternative route via Bahrein wnich could be used to keep traffic transiting Bushire to an absolute minimum, and as the Department were not aware of the intention to restore the cables to the pre-war routeing. From the ensuing dis cussion, it ^-appeared that the Persians were genuinely unaware of the diversions which had been made during the war, and therefore thought that a large amount of traffic to and from Iraq was transiting Bushire. It also appeared that as recently as 1946, the (then) Divisional Manager of Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd, Mr Thornton, had given the Department information on the cable layout in the Gulf, which did not include any of the wartime diversions. However, this point is of relatively little importance. 3) Reduction in staff at Bushire. The Department explained that as traffic had to be handed over by their office in Bushire to Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd for retransmission, the Company's office was almost regarded as foreign territory, and they wished to alter this arrangement. Their idea was to install a morse reperforator in their office, and to hand over the tapes to Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd for automatic retransmission, or preferably, to install a relay circuit in Busnire, so that traffic could be sent direct from Teheran to Karachi.L ^ was pointed out that quite fipart from administrative difficulties arising from the different operating procedures used by the Department and Cable j^jQreless Ltd, such an arrangement would completely disrupt the traffic organisation in the Gulf, while furthermore, it was also possible that the circuit AdCA-Muecat-Karachi would be of considerably more Itnpfl rtaue ft 1 than a direct Bushire—Muscat—Karachi circuit, so that unless special arrangements Wv-re made to channel the Muscat-Karachi section, the arrangement proposed by the Department wo\ild be impracticable. It was quite obvious from the discussion that the Department had not the slightest idea of the cable routeing, and it would not be at all difficult, if thought necessary, to convince them of the impracticability of their proposal.

It was suggested that this could be done by means of the installation or an automatic r transmitter v/hereby messages received by' the Persian' administration at Bushire couldbe automatically transferred to the Company’s system and vice ve-sa. articular emphasis was i id on this las condition. It was explained to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that it might be well if they were now to set forth these views in reply to our note of the 23 th January, 1.946, copy cf which was forwarded to you under cover of P.L.

A aurmriary of the situation has been prepared, and a copy will be forwarded under separate cover. 18. It is understood that a new high-power short-wave transmitter has arrived in Bahrein for shipment to Bushire, the reason given by Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. being that it is to ’’augment'' their existing equipment. In the present circumstances, it is felt that nothing would to playing into the hands of the Persians more than to send thus equipment tc Bushire, &amp;:id it is being recommended to the Foreign Office that shipi^int should be delayed for the tine being. Future Telecommunications He:^u lrem ants - Persian Gulf . 19. It appears likely that the damage cone to the lluscat- Karachi cable during the 194!; earthquake may have mace its repair Impracticable, in which case there is certainly no justification from the traffic viewpoint, nor does there appear any iirmediate strategic reason, for the very large capital expenditure Involved in laying a new cable. Uven should the damage be repairable, the connection between the Persian Gulf and India will presumably decrease sorr^what _ under the new Indian Government regime, and the Posts and. Telegraphs Department in Karachi have already indicated un officially to the Divisional Manager of Cable &lt;5: v/ireliss Ltd., that there will be no necessity for the retention of his office in Karachi once the Company is nationalised, rud the Gove mine re take over operation of the associated Ccr paiy in Indi?. 20. This raises tbje question both of the future of the Company’s organisation in the Gulf area end the local tele communications requirements as a whole. On the first point, it would seen that if a separate Divisional Manager, Persian Gulf is still considered necessary, then he should be centred on Bahrein or wherever the Political heaidant may have his Headquarters, or alternatively, it night be more economical to put the Company’s Manager in Bahrein in cherge of the other few remaining stations in the Gulf. This is, of course, very largely an Internal matter of Company administration, but It might also be advisable fer ary local viev/s on the subject to be .forwarded to London so that they may bo taken into consideration by the Company.21 On the quest.ion of future requirements, it should be noted that all the Oulf cables are at present interrupt' , VJ hile a* versions will also be necessary to make Bahrein the cable 6 centre of the area and adjust the other links to nreduce the moot effective circuit arrangeraents. Xx has alwavs bean recocnised that the Oulf cables are an exper.si/ luxury and can never hope to be operated ao a pro-it, wnil , A as a h.*’.o-h proportion of the totax :.uj.ea;,e Icii.v.. ib s y * some of it soing back to the l8Q0's s it can ^ assumed that future maintenance requirements \&gt;1^ D even heavier scale than during the fe&lt;v - &gt; have been there has seldom been a v^^iod v/hen all *iic v/orking simultaneously. 22. It is therefore suniested that unless II.... Covermient wish to keep the cable, network in workinc order^for ^t: —-• reasons, then consideration shouxa be Si v ®n “• “* r cable circuits as the cables pass ceyond normal lepair, a^d.where necessary, replacing then with freiess circuits. This would seem to involve settlne up wireless circuits between Bahrein (as a convenient distribution point^nd Muscat, Teheran or Bushire and Baghdad. I b “he -ase or the Persian and Iraqi authorities tney would not i^rXt the Company to establish permanent wireless stations at Bushire and Pao, but v ould normally route traffic via the Government stations at Teheran or hudnire and -ajhdaa.

From: Telecommunications Attach^. Note on the Qushire Wireless station and the rer.e-al of the Cable &amp; Wireless Ld. concession in iersiu. In a converation withthe Minister of Communications, the Director of audio Services and the Director ol Telegra, ne Tehran on 11th September, the Minister made it quite clear that for political reasons, he could not agree to any continuance o the wireless circuit between the A.I.O.C. station at Abadan a. Bushire, so long as the Bushire terminal was operated by uable * Wireless Ld., The 'political reasons' without doubt referred to the attacics in the Press by the Opposition, on the alleged a * t ent The Minister also indicated that the renewal or th. Cable * wlreleas Ld. concession in Persia would depend on the satiaracwry settlement, from the Persian angle, of the stated that so far as the Persian ?° vera “ ent . w ® re „°rt ?hr^isit^f previous talks on the renewal of the concession, and the visit oi the Divisional Manager, ^ eral f' ^[’^technicf^discusslons and Tehran, were now regarded as preliminary carried no weight whatsoever. The situation smells of blackmail, but 14 ^'^.^jelves see how, in view of the circumstances, we can extricate oureel without acceding to the Persian deraands, 2 . to summarise the past ^i^ory with suffioient^accura^y.^he original purpose oi ^able &amp;*irel in caBe of eable failure station at Bushire wa 'After our occupation of Persia during Tehran and the Ten oy® wireless facilities from Bushire, permission to ^J^efined, and the Company agreed to take BU.«„ «d Ling.h.

Eaually, on the other hand, it is logical to believe that the Persians regarded this as a wartime station, and therefore a nilito* y one* 4. It is obvious that the circuit between Abadan and Bushire was a great convenience to the Oil Company in view of unacceptable delays „ the civil line telegraph circuit and it was at the tame ti js a Source of T revenue to cible ft tireless Ld., so that neither aide wished to cease the arrangement. Nevertheless, fromthe * P?* nt ; it is difficult to justify any continuance of the circuit by ^ble 4 tireless Ld. at Bushire after the cessation oi hostilitxe. , Derhaos later, on the evacuation of British troops from rerr.m, SithSSt some prior reference to the authorities. The '^rgency' facilities can reasonably be said to have been ovemtepped, without acm* •xouse being given that the most expeditioufr/dii-cempany traffic ..as necessary in connection with the rehabilitation of enemy occupied countries, or something equally vague, which would ^ve nevertheless sufficed. properly put, it could ha ^ e that Persia was actually assisting rehabilitation by allowinK.h^ continued -emergency' facilities. as it was, the circuit was closed on instructions to the local telegraph offices, from xehran, in bul., 1946. 6. In the conversation, the Minister said that n e i* h « r nor Cable A ireless Ld. had advised the Government that traliic was being passed between Abadan and Bushire (he was, of course, .ron te in his facts about the Oil Company) while in even *' L d wireless facilities had only been granted to Cable ft «¥lr«lese Ld. until the end of the war, and should have ceased at least on the evacuation of British troops, if not sooner. I suggested that the question had been seized upon as a convenient political weapon, and had in consequence been ma^ni!ied out of all proportion to its real importance, with which he agreed, and suggested equally, the Persian Government could easily have informed Cable &amp; wireless Ld. at that time that the special v, artime f‘jollities vere to be withdrawn. On the other hand, I could do noting but IgreeUn silence) with the Minister that Cable ft ^eleas Ld. hud overstepped the mark in continuing to vorK to Abad.xi \»i».Uout informing the Government and I am certain non that had dene so, thepresent unfortunate situation and political background could have been avoided. The Minister also pointed out that in continuing to workwire- which*the^themselves ha^inc luded^in^he^erdMf^agreement, i. e. 52 , &gt;5 teutsf ° n i l ? a TGJg* M &amp; % /violate ....violate a clause of an unsigned agreement, but it shows the trend of Persian thoughts. 6* Although satisfactory alternative arrangements have since been f ade by strengthening the Abadan—-Tehran wireless circuit, I pointed ut to the Minister at the time that the sudden cessation of the Abadan— Bushire circuit had put the oil company in a difficult position as regards clearing their important east-bound traffic, which was considerable, and asked whether some interim arrangement, such as the infiltration of a token number of Government telegraphists into the Cable &amp; Wireless Ld. wireless office, would be permitted. The Minister stated he would be prepared to discuss the outright purchase of the wireless station at a satisfactory (.') figure, or alternatively, would discuss any other method by which the station would come under Persian control (obviously hinting that it should be given to them) when it might then be possible to agree to some interim arrangement. I gathered the impression, however, that nothing would or could be done until we had made some definite indication as to our willingness to fall in with this demand. 7. As in the case of other Administrations, the Persians do not favour the use of submarine cable circuits, which involves them in sharing an appreciable proportion of the tariff with transit stations, whereas in the case of wireless circuits, they share the dues with the Administration at the other end of the circuit. The Minister stated that they had already proposed the setting up of a direct wireless circuit between Tehran and India (Bombay) which would cater for the greater part of the oil company’s eastbound traffic, but that the proposal had been turned down by the Government of India, under pressure, he thought from Cable &amp; Wireless Ld. Under this proposal, it had been suggested by the Persians that the wireless rate should be the same as the cable rate. 8 . There is no great incentive for the Persians to foster an Abadan-Bushire wireless circuit, which would tend to boost cable traffic, so long as there is any possibility of a direct wireless circuit to India, and in view of the relatively small profit which must accrue to Cable &amp; Wireless Ld. from Bushire cable traffic - bearing in mind the numerous repairs that have to be carried out on the Persian Gulf cables - it would doubtless improve our relations with the Persians if we took their side in pressing for the establishment of a direct wireless circuit to .India. This would leave the cable to handle traffic for which it is the better routeing, such as to Bahrein and other Persian Gulf stations, and such traffic as may be routed ”by cable' by the originator. 9. The Director of Radio services stated he was willing to assist by increasing the schedules on the Abadeui-Tehran wireless circuit - and has already done so by installing automatic high-speed equipment in Tehran, and it would appear that under the arrangements suggested, the A. I.O.C. would get adequate traffic capacity to all their eastern outlets, the Minister would be freed from political pressure, i*iile Cable &amp; Wireless Ld. would get their new concession signed and their associated Indian Comprny would pick up on the wireless circuit nearly all the revenue that would be lost on the cable. 10. It is therefore suggested that Gable &amp; Wireless Ld. should open negotiations with the Persian authorities for the taking over of Bushire wireless by the latter on a peace-time basis, and should /arrange .... (c a.« arrange to sell a suitable equipment on a non-profit-making basis to the Persians (not necessarily the one at present installed in Bushire), thereafter limiting their own wireless facilities to purely emergency use with Bahrein. Also, the Indian Government should be approached with a view to opening a direct wireless circuit Tehran-Bombay# (Sgd) H.G.SINCLAIR Telecournunications Attach^ Attachments CQpies of letters exchanged between A.I.

Shipment from Bahrein to Bushire of wireless transmitter referred to in paragraph 18 should he delayed pending discussion hy you in London next week, 2. Subject to strategic considerations I agree with recommendations in paragraphs 19 and 22* 5 e I should prefer headquarters of Persian Gulf administrative services of Cable and Wireless to be at Bahrein since the political administration has now been removed from Persia. 4. It is confirmed that the Persian Government will not permit the Company to establish a permanent wireless station at Bushire but will expect.traffic to be routed via their Government station there or in Tehran. 5. I feel we should adopt a progressive.policy and recognise that we can no longer maintain.the privileges of an outworn cable system and that wireless circuits are more. up to date and efficient method of handling most oi traffic in question. We should therefore .support the request of the Persian Government to establish direct wireless circuit to India (Tehran to Bombay) leaving cables for traffic between Persian Gulf stations only until they are replaced by wireless transformers, I am.not aware °i the views of the Government of India on this G^estion though the Telecommunications Attachd has reported that such a propo al has been examined in detail and was not approved. hor am I aware of the strategic implications.. 6. Arrangements should be made between Cable and eless and the Persian Government for the use of a small v ess transmitter at Bushire for purely emergency use Bahrein, or a satisfactory agreement should be reachedreached about the use by the Company in emergency of the present station if this is sold to the Persian Government, until this Bushire question is solved there is no likelihood of progress being made with the general question of renewal of the Company's concession.

Visited Tehran last week when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs indicated that owing to political pressure signing of your new concession was dependent on satisfactory solution from the.Persian Government s viewpoint of the situation regarding the.Company s wireless station at Bushire which they wish to take over, ^ny previous discussions on the subject of concession are now regarded as having been at a technical level and unofficial. 2. I am preparing report for Embassy and Foreign. Office which cannot be completed without answers to the following questions. Firstly, did the Company apply direct to the Persian Government for permission to open Bushire-iibbdan wireless circuit and if so did the Government reply and on what date? Secondly, if no actual permission was sought did the Company inform the Persian Government that the circuit was beingopened as emergency war-time measure and if so did the Government acknowledge receipt .of adviceadvice and on what date? Thirdly, on what date was the circuit opened and bearing in mind that the Company were only granted^special wireless facilities for war-time requirements why did the circuit continue after evacuation of British-forces? 3, Would appreciate very early reply to above and suggest you reply through Bennett to save time, mi proceeding to Bahrein for general discussions on Persian Gulf tele-communications with Political Resident in 2 or 3 weeks and it might be valuable for you,to meet me there, I will advise you later on this point. 4..

Following is summary of article in Rahbar of Ma,y 13t^ [Begins] The British in addition to not evacuating Bahrein, have not evacuated Bushire. The British were permitted to establish a wireless station at Bushire for the duration of the war. When the war finished the British ’’evacuated ' 1 Persia and should have handed over the wireless station to Persia free of charge in accordance with the Tripartite pact. Unfortunately when Qavim was in Moscow, the Ministry of Postes, Telegraphs and Telephones did not inform him that the British had not handed over the wire less station and therefore had not completely evacuated Persia. Instead the Ministry of Postes, Telegraphs and Telegrams [sic ? Telephones] are busy making an agreement to give the British war-time concession legal status in Persia so that the British may better be able to form a Government within the Government of Persia. A letter received from several well-informed persons makes the four following demands:- ( 1 ) prevention of the conclusion of another treaty injurious to the independence of Persia.. (2) The British wireless station to be handed over to Persia as soon as possible. (3) If the wireless station is not handed over reference of the case to the Security Council.

As soon as the Embassy* s agreement to the points in the counter proposals is notified to the M.F.A. they will take the necessary steps for the renewal and fixing of the term and will inform the Embassy of the result. SEALED M.F.A.v A * Article 1, (b) to establish, instal, maintain and operate in the future such additional cables at Bushire as it may require. (c) To continue to maintain and operate at Bushire the CGrupany 1 s emergency wireless telegraph apparatus. This is agreed to on condition that it should only serve for controlling the cable, and that when the cable is out of order it may be used for communicating wireless messages. Obviously it will not be involved in communication with ships ana aircrafts wireless sets and with the coastal wireless services of the Persian Gulf; such communications will be carried out only by the Persian wireless service in Bushire Article 2, The compary shall have the right to pick up and remove during the term of this concession any cable or cables which may become superfluous to its requirements. Ll- The Compary shall be responsible for all expenses of administration and upkeep of the landline, cable offices and cables under its control. The CcllTpany , s repair ship will visit the Persian Gulf from time to time according to the needs of the cables worked by it. Article if. It is understood that the Company shall not directly accept in Persia ary telegram for any destination and shall not deliver telegrams direct to the recipients. Such functions will be performed exclusively by the Iranian Telegraph Administration, The Iranian Administration shall be responsible for maintaining communication between its offices and the system operated by the Company. Agreed to. Artidle 5» No rate shall be payable to the Government on traffic passing in transit over the Company* s system at Bushire to and from points outside Iran in the transmission of which the Iranian Telegraph Administration does not in any way intervene. Agreed to Article 6. * 1932 The stipulations of the International T el e-communication Convention (Madrid 1932) and of the Telegraph Regulations /attachedArticle 6 . (continued) t &lt;§&gt; attached thereto (Cairo Revision 1938) or of any international instrument or instrument s’which may replace them. shall be applicable to the telegraph traffic to and from Iran exchanged by the G-overrment with the Company at Bushire and to the settlement of accounts in respect of such traffic. Agreed to Article 7. The Iranian Government shall allow all instruments and stores required for the landline, cable offices and cables to be admitted free of customs and all other duties. Agreed to A minor difference exists between the text of this Article and section 2 of Article 4 of the previous Agreement dealing with this subject. It is believed by this Ministry that it would be better to re-adopt the text in that agreement, quoted as follows: 'The Iranian Government shall exempt from customs dues etc., the stationery and the tools and instruments required for the working of land telegraph cables and the Telegraph Department'. Article 8, Freedom from custom and all other duties shall also be extended to articles imported for the personal comfort and welfare of the Company* s staff at Bushire. This article constitutes a new proposal which cannot be agreed to, this Ministry believes, as exemption from customs dues is a privilege which can be granted only to diplomatic representatives, and no such privileges have ever been given to any foreign companies, except the A.I. O.C. Since the Company in question is operating in Iran all expenses for its personnel shall be liable to prescribed taxes. Article 9* The Company shall be exempt from any special taxation (Including taxation on capital and assets outside Iran) other than the r&gt;ayment of any general rates and taxes which may be in existence or be imposed in Iran at ary future date. The Company shall be liable to taxes now in force and taxes which will be levied in future, provided that no special or exceptional taxes should be imposed on the Company* /Article 10■■ ■ warn warn r &amp; -3- Artiole 10. The Comparer* s staff serving at Bushire shall not as regards taxation be treated less ^ favourably than that of any other corporation, undertaking or compaJTy engaged in public utility services in Iran. Article 11. The Iranian Government agrees to exempt from sanitary, port and other dues any cable ship belonging to or chartered by the Company that enters the waters of the Iranian Government. It also agrees to allow to enter free of charge all tools and instruments that may be landed for the repair or the extension of the Company* s cables, provided that after the repair is completed they shall be removed. If they are sold in Iranian territory, the Company shall be liable to pay duty thereon. * Article 12. The permission granted to the Company in relation to the submarine cables referred to in Article 1 hereof shall be an exclusive one to the Compary for the duration of this concession. The Company*s personnel serving in Iran shall be liable to every kind of taxes at present collected from employees and individuals or which may be levied in future but no special or exceptional taxes shall be imposed on the Company* s personnel. \ There is no legal justification for the exemption from port and sanitary dues of the Ccsnpary* s vessels, since these are collected at places where the Government has set up port installations used by vessels. The dues mentioned which are collected as a special revenue must be spent for the same installations. In fact the vessels pay for work done for them there; this should not be regarded as tax paid to the Government. This Ministry agrees to the last part of Article 11 concerning the temporary import of tools and instruments for the repair of the cables now in use. Agreed to.V ^ith the Complirr.en iy of State foj.

Lewis Foreign Office India Office General Post Office The Hon. J.J.Denison-Pender) Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd, Mr. W.G.R. Jacob ) Miss S.M, Barrett Secretary ITEM 1, Cables in the Persian Gul f 1, The Chairman referred to the request from Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd,^ that they should be allowed to restore their cables in the Persian Gulf to their original positions, the objections v/hich had been received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the comments made by the Company on these objections. All the relevent documents ha.d been circulated with the ngenda, and he invited Mr. Jacob to enlarge on the Company’s reasons for wishing to revert to the status quo. 2. Mr. Jacob explained that before the war the Company had two cables from Fao to Bushire. one from Bushire to Bahrein, one from Bushire to Muscat ancl onwards to Karachi. With this arrangement, if either of the Fao-Bushire cables broke down the traffic could be passed on the other and through communications would still be available. In the course of the war, however, the Fighting Services had decided that there were security objections to their traffic beino- routed via Bushire, and the Bushire-Bahrein cable and one of the Fao-Bushire cables had therefore been cut and' joined at sea off Bushire, to provide a Fao-Bahroin cable; at the same time the Bushire-Muscat cable had been cut off Bushire ejid taken into Bahrein, so that through communication was obtained via Bahrein, terminal traffic for Bushire being carried on from Fao over the second Fao-Bushire cable which had been left m situ. In addition another cable had been laid from Muscat to Bushire to strengthen the Gulf cable system. One of the Aden-Bombay cables had also been cut and taken into Muscat to connect the Persian Gulf system with the Red Sea cables. 3, The trouble with the present arrangement was that if either , the ^ Bushire-Fao' and the Bahrein-Muscat, or the Bahrein-Fao and the Bushire-Muscat cables were interrupted simultaneously, through communication was lost, whereas if the Bushirc-Bahrein ce.ble and the additional Bushire-Fao cable were restored, an alternative route would be available. During the past twelve months through‘cable communication had not been available for 72 days, ana this would have been avoided if the cables had been in their original positions. The operation required to restore the status quo was very simple and would be carried out outside Persian territorial waters, as the cables had been cut six miles out of Bushire, and would simply have to bo joined cnco agann to the Bushire shore ends which still terminated in the Cable &amp; Wireless office in Bushire. /.- 2 - 4* Mr, Denison-Pender suggested that tho main objections of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf were covered by the three clauses from the ^ agreement which was being negotiated between the Company and the Persian Government (see appendix to Agenda). This agreement was on the point of being signed, the only delay being over a small financial question. 5. Mr, Donaldson agreed that objections (a) and (c) in the Political Resident’s telegram were covered, but objection (b) remained though it would have less force once the agreement was signed# The India Office wa.s very anxious that nothing should be done which might give the Persian Government an occasion to revive its claim to Bahrein. 6* itfter some further discussion, the Committee agreed :- (a) that the India. Office should send a telegram to the Political Resident, repeated to the Embassy at Teheran for their comments, giving the three clauses of the proposed agreement, and asking whether his objections would be satisfied provided the negotiations were satisfactorily concluded (b) that the Foreign Office should send a repetition of the Political Resident's telegram to Teheran, so that they would be fully informed of the situation. (c) - that it was not necessary at this stage to consult the British Embassy at Baghdad, though their corroboration might be useful later if it were necessary to convince the PolitiSal Resident of the practical value of restoring the pre-war cable system (d) that no further action should be taJcen until the further views of the Political Resident had been received. Additional Items ITEM 2, PROVISION OP CABLE SHIPS 7, The Chairman said he wished to place on record the-recent I.C.C. decision about possible ways of helping out Cable &amp; lireless Ltd, in their present shortage of cable ships. It had been agreed that the admiralty and Cable &amp; Wireless in consultation should try to find a solution on the . lines of the Admiralty lending one of the n Bull' ships to the Company. 8, Commander Lace said that a letter was on its wry from the Admiralty to the Company offering them the loan of one of these ships, and ho thought a satisfactory arrangement would probaJbly be reached, ITEM 3 RETURN OP GKE^T NORTHERN TELEGRAPH COMPiNT’S SHIPS I 9, The Chairman said that Mr# Suenson of the Great Northern Telegraph Company had called to ask him wha.t the prospects were of either the '’Pacific' or the 'Store Nordiske' being returned to them shortly, 10, Mr. Denison-Pendor said that he had since seen Mr, Suenson, and had explained to him that the 'Store Nordiske' had turned northwards from Singapore, but for strategical reasons the route from Singapore to Hongkong must be established before the northern pant of the route, and this was not likely to be finished for some time, because there were extensive minefields to be swept around Hongkong, 11, Mr, Ja.cob added that presumably the sweeping north of Hongkong would be left until Hongkong itself had been cleaned, so there would be little the ship could do further north at present. The Company ha.d asked their manager at Singapore fo enquire into this. ■pM&amp;I - 3 - ^ -^r*. Doni3on-Fenaor sr.id he he.d also jpinted out to Mr, Suenson tha.t the^Great Northern Company's cables in the Baltic could not be repaired until the Russians had cleared the minefields there, so that even if their asiatic cables north of Hongkong were repaired, they would not have a through route in either direction at present. He had estimated that one of the could bo on her way north by the end of March, There might be some difficulty about sending the 'Pacific' as she was a coal-burner, and he understood there were no stocks of coal in China or Japan, other than Naval dumps. ^* Cpm.iaidcr Lace thought that since cable operations were so important, ere would be no difficulty in obtaining coal from Naval dumps of the company approached the local Naval authorities. ITEM 4. HQRTE-EivEDEN C,3LE 14 ‘ The Committee noted that the proposal of Cable &amp; Wireles Ltd. to give up their channel in the Horta-Emden cable had been cancelled (.;/T Board letter 455D/B/B138 of 25th January, G.P.O. letter 25507/44 of 8th February). item 5 . KERENE-ijERSIN CnBLE lil 0 . Chairman said that the I.C.C. head decided that the Kyrene-Mersin ca le should be left in position in case it should be required in the future, Ga le &amp; Wireless Ltd. could not therefore .pick it up for use in lay ins the projected Cyprus-Beirut cable, :rl y_co thought there was still sufficient strategic cable streamed in the Mediterranean for this purpose. ^ 1C ^Gujst of the Chairman, Mr, Jacob undertook to check hoi,/ much of the cable streamed in the Mediterranean had been used, and to inform the Board by letter of the amount still available. ITEM 6 . LOTDON-QSKKM YflRELESS LINK -r. Rapicr said that although this subject was not strictly within the province of Sub-Committee »F», it seemed a suitable occasion to consider what steps could be taken to bring the London-Osaka link into efficient operation. P- The Chairmen road out signals which had been exchanged between the war Ofi ice and the Military authorities in Japan stating the difficulties which had been encountered. 20. Jocob undertook to examine the possibility of improving the service by sending better equipment to Osaka, or, if the bad route was the trouble by relaying traffic via Colombo. He said that he would inform the Board by letter of any suggestions the Company could make. 21, The Chairman stated that if Cable &amp; Wireless considered a visit to Japan by one of their engineers, would expedite the bettering of this wireless circuit, the services would do all thuy could to facilitate the visit. ml:4 1 _ 4 - 22.

Otherwise either (a) Persian Government will be involved in extra expense or (b) Notification must be made to International Bureau in Berne in order that bureau may warn postal, administration^ not to route their telegrams through Persia. 2.

The first reaction of the Persian authorities was favourable, but on January 26th the State Department were informed by the United States Minister at Tehran that, while the Persian Government were most anxious to open this direct circuit, it was believed that His Majesty's Government, who now controlled the Tehran radio station, would oppose it. The United States Government, who are apparently under the impression that the only obstacle to the immediate opening of the circuit is our alleged opposition,' have asked us to give our consent. They point out that there are a senior United States army officer and civilian technicians in Persia to whom rapid and adequate communications with the United States are of vital importance, 2. I do not know whether you have discussed this question with your United States colleague, but unless there are local objections of which I am not aware, there seems no reason why we should object to the opening of direct wireless communication between the United States and Persia. Subject to your views I propose to inform the United States Government accordingly and you should also explain the position to your United States colleague. 4 Z.COPY TELEGRAM MOST SECRET.

The limited diversion scheme for the cables in the Persian Gulf decided upon at the 6 th Meeting of the committee and completed by the 'C. S.Recorder' before the 18th October, 1941, with the question of the indemnity which Sir Edward Wilshaw t suggested should be given by His Majesty s Government against any claims arising out of this diversion scheme, which might be made by the Persian and Iraqi Governments on Cable and Wireless Ltd, Sir Edward Wilshaw had been informed that such an indemnity was neither necessary nor possible. THE COMMITTEE Took note of the position. B, The extensive imurovements proposed to the cables in the Persian Gulf and set out in some detail in I.C.C.(41) 70# THE CHAIRMAH outlined the satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations which he had conducted with Sir Edward Wilshaw. THE COMMITTEE Took note with approval of the arrangements made. C. The establishment of direct wireless circuits between Bombay and Teheran and Bombay and Bagdad, and the question whether these wireless stations should be controlled by British Authorities. (i) The Teheran and Bagdad stations were controlled by the Persian and Iraqi Governments respectively. (ii) The Service Authorities were anxious that communications generally with Persia and Iraq should be brought to the highest pitch of efficiency, and for this purpose, would be glad to see these stations taken over and operated by Cable and Wireless Ltd., as Service personnel could not be urovided to work either station, (iii) The cable communications from the Persian Gulf to India were precarious - the cable was at present interrupted - and must remain so for a number of months at a most critical period of the war. During interruptions of the cable these particular Wireless Stations would become more important.■HMMHMHHHHHi (lv) A satisfactory censorship op ^ d ch a censor- steps were being taken to oheck on ship in Persia. kept stations, though the messages sent out oy apparatus this involved the use of stall anu .1 needed for other duties.

WIRELESS TELEGRAP HY BOARD« T0 _ iu , u WENTWORTH, U.S.N. . U.S, SPECIAL OBS ERVER PROiJP * 1, The Wireless Telegraphy Board has again been the question of cable com unications in the area of j; 1 ”. h Ocean, in view of the latest developments and the ^ands whic have been received. The Board is of the opinion that thes various demands can only be carried out efficiently an expeditiously if the services of C.S. ’’John W. Mackay ^can be made available. I have accordingly been instructed to lay the whole situation before you and to ask you if you- t could take steps to ensure this ship being made availaole i r this purpose. 2 . The Persian Gulf. Since the meeting of the Wireless Telegraphy Board which you attended, a cable has been received froui C.-in-C. saying that it is essential for another cable to be la 1 ^ betwee - India and the head of the Persian Gulf. The Wireless Telegraphy ' l Board agree that in principle it is essential that there should { be duplicate cable communications with this areay and that the part of the necessary work exterior to the Gulf itself must be completed before Monsoon conditions set in, as it is impossible for cable ships to work off the southern coas of Persia in the open sea during the Monsoon. A considerable amount of the traffic from the Persian Gulf area will^b^ --.to 'Egypt and. beyond. In order to cut out the retransmissions Qtheryfise necessary at Karachi and Bombay and the overland route between, these two points, the Board has come to the conclusion that, it. would be preferable to connect Muscat with Aden rather thoi^ Karachi. Their proposal is to cut the Aden-Bombay cable one or two hundred miles west of Bombay j pick - up this cable, . ^ to about Longitude 60, and relay it up to Muscaty This entails picking up about 500 or 600 miles of cable. The only ship . , ■ which can-do this in one operation is the ’’John W-i Mackay • This must be completed before the Mdnsoon; the Board then intono. as cable becomes available to extend this cable- from Muscat to Pao or Bandar Gulf. This operation, however, can be performed during the Monsoon. • • ; .,v;: • . t - * '*• *1 * 3. (i) Red Sea. A demand has been received irom the Combined Signal Board, Middle East? for new cables to be laid in conjunction with the Lend/Lease programme. These cables are:- (a) Prom Aqaba to Safaga. (b) Cut one of the Suez-Port Sudan cables off Safaga. and bring both legs into Safaga. (c) Connect Massawa with Port Sudan either by cutting one of the Port Sudan-Aden cables and bringing in the two legs to Massawa, or by laying new cable from Port_ Sudan to Massawa. It is understood that*the American Mission in Cairo is very keen on direct;line communication between Cairo and Massawa. -1-3. (ii) The amounts of cables required for these operations are:- (a) Aqaba-Safaga 190 miles (b) Safaga lead-in 30 miles (c) Massawa lead-in or Massawa-Port Sudan 250 miles about 300 miles. 4 # Mediterranean * Two requirements have been proposed by the Combined Signal Board, Middle East:- ( a ) A cable from Kyrene (Cyprus) to Mersina to join up the Turkish land-line system with the British cable system. This is about 150 miles. (b) To cat one of the Malta-Alexandria cables and join the Alexandria end into a port on the Northern coast of Africa, probably Tobruk, but depending on the course df operations. If Tobruk is chosen, this will require, about 55 miles of cable. . . 5. 6able Requirements . The ^ above operations will require about 700 miles of cable. It is exceedingly difficult to transport cable through the ^Tropics unless it is shipped in a cable ship. alternative method is in tanks specially build m the hold oi a ship. Cable and Wireless Limited have a very few tanks, and these are nearly all earmarked for export of cable replenishment of'maintenance stocks, and it is not possible to obtain enough space for all this 700 miles immediately. 6 * Proposals for the use of C,t,S_._ 'John W. Mackay J'. It is proposed, if the C.S. ’’John W. Mackay' is made available, that the following sequence of* operations should take rplaces- (a) . As much cable as possible, at least 600 miles, or more „ if the situation at the time of shipment allows, to ; ..,, be -despatched by ordinary freighter to Halifax. This- M is possible because the cable will not leave Northern latitudes. (b) -Load all these cables. + 115 miles of cable now lying, in tanks at Halifax on the ''John W. Mackay”. /cV Despatch 'John W. Mackay” by the safest possible route• direct via the Cape to the Red Se.a. 'John W. Mackay to discharge either into tanks at Aden or Perim, or into C.S. 'Recorder”, as much cable as will leave her room in her tanks to carry out operation referred to in paragraph 2 above. (d) Carry out the Aden-Bombay diversion into Muscat.? (e) Carry out any operations under which havo not in the meantime been done y other cable ships. . ~ (It is not possible to make precise plans i r cable operations so far ahead, as much depends movements of the various cable ships, whicn are employed very heavily in normal cable maintenance). 7 . In addition to the above requirements, there is another potential Admiralty requirement which will involve the lay g of 600 miles of cable. Should this materialise it would appear that the 'John W. Mackay' is the only ship capable ot carrying this out. It is therefore impossible to aay at present^whether the 'John W. Mackay' could be released on the completion of the above operations, and :£ is thought best not to make any definite arrangements about her return to h 8 . It is pointed out that it is impossible for the c&amp; b if ships at our disposal to carry out the above tasks in addition to their normal maintenance work. It is, as a matter of fac &gt; almost impossible for these ships to keep abreast of this and important cables remain faulty for long periods owing to the paucity of cable ships. We aro therefore compelled i°.ask American help in this respect, and the 'John rf. Mackay is only ship which can carry out to the Near Erst the amount of cable requireds, and which can lay the rather considera le lengths involved. x x x (Signed) C.V.L.

With reference to your letter of the 8th September, Sir Camnbell Stuart consulted the competent departments of the United kingdom Government on the .point you raised about the possibility that the Persian and Iraqi Governments might have cause for complaint against your Company on account of the diversion of cables out of Bushire, nd in his absence I have been asked to reply. A^ regards Persia, the position is regulated by the Agreement of 17th February, 1932* This is a ’’Heads of State agreement, and though your Company is the ^gent mentioned mmm . ■■i Article 4, it is not a party to the Agreement, It does not appear therefore that the Persian Government could have any grounds for raising a complaint against the Company: moreover the terms of Article 4 are permissive and not mandatory. Nor does it appear, on the has is of the arrangement referred to in your letter of the 30th July that the Iraqi Government would have grounds for complaint, since the scheme does not involve the laying of any additional cable in that country. Since you wrote to Sir Campbell on this matter the political situation in the Persian Gulf has been changed by the entry of our forces into Persia; and, arising out of our military actions in Persia and - L raq, there will be many matters for settlement by the British Government with these countries after the 'far. In these circumstances there seems to be no occasion for an explicit assurance of the kind suggested in your letter of the 30th July. ^n any case, the Government could not accept a general liability to indemnify the Company for loss of goodwill. Should any such situation as you have envisaged actually arise, it would be a matter to be dealt with in the light of the political and military circumstances obtaining at the time. While therefore it is impossible to give any specific assurances of thm kind suggested in your letter of the 30th July, you may bo assured that if and when the time comes, the fullest regard would be paid to your Company^ interests.

I should be grateful if you would take this matter up either with the I.G.G. or direct, and let Sir Edward have the answer. I am sending a copy of this letter to L»aboucherc rnd bumby.

PERSIAN CULP DIVERSIONS. ~n You will remeber that the question of extra accommodation &lt;trose at Pao in connection with the recent diversions. Our office at Pao is in the Iraqi Telegraph Building, and, to obtain extra space, part of the verandah of this buildtng was bricked in to form a battery room. This work was done by the Port Directorate at our Engineer's request, and the latter received authority for this freon a Colonel Skinner, who was in charge at the Headquarters of the Basra line communications area. The Director-General of Telegraphs at Baghdad has now asked the Port Director at Basra for comments, as he had not been informed of these alterations, and the Port Director has requested us to reply to the Director-General. A.s it was decided that no mention of these diversions, or anything connected therewith, should be made to either the Iran or Iraq Government, I should be glad to know what reply you would like me to make in this instance.

Labouchere, sq*7 C. (^) /&gt; Colonel Zamora, the Secretary of The imperial Consnunications Advisory CommitT.ee, brought me the attached ^ letter this morning# ne said that the improvements descrioed in the letter and its enclosures had been decided upon at a meeting of the Wireless Telegraphy Board (which represents the three Service Departments) and the G.P.C., but that the other interested Deuartments had not yet oeen consulted. liiq Board were anxious, however, that the improvements should be undertaken as soon as possible; if they are to be conoleted before the beginning of the monsoon period next April it will be necessary to put them in hand during the next few days. He was therefore consulting the India Office and the Foreign very urgently. He added that, as the sole object of the oronosed measures was to improve communications between India and the Gulf, he assumed that the Government of India would have no objection. He has since telephoned that the Foreign Office agree to these measures being undertaken. I agreed that in vie?/ of the urgency it seemed unnecessary formally to consult the Government of India and the Political Resident, who would, however, be informed by telegram what had been decided here. 'Two points, however, occurred to mer- (a) Would the relaying of the cable involve a prolonged interruption of the service? Colonel Zambra thought that owing to the method adopted there would be hardly any interruption. (b) Who would bear the expense? Colonel Zambra had discussed this question with the Treasury and is C—It is hoped that the question of cost may be left to be settled along with that of the diversion scheme which was recently undertaken and which forms the subject of the papers below. In other Y/ords, an effort would be made to induce kessrs. Cable &amp; Wireless to meet «s&amp;naost of the expenditure, and for this purpose it will be necessary to wait and see to wnau extent the improvements will benefit them. On the otner hand though every reservation has been made with regard to Tvi/3-i Q*C! /naaMIMM ga India s liability to contribute to'\7ards tde diversion scheme there is a distinct possibility that she will be asked to do* so; and the same would apply to the measures now in question. It is therefore proposed to reply to Colonel Zambra's letter* maid.ng it clear tnat the Government of India are not conmitted to meeting any part of the expenditure.now involved. A draft telegram and letter are submitted. f •*(. y-t.liETTER. SECRET. Colonel Warren Zambra, Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, Electra House, Victoria Embankment, W.C.2. 7 NPV J94t Dear z.arnbra, With reference to your letter of November 3rd regarding Persian Gulf communications, which you brought to me on November 4th, I write to confirm what I then suggested to you, viz. that in view of the anxiety of the Wireless Telegraphy Board that certain improvements in the Gulf cable system should be effected as a matter of urgency, we agree that the necessary arrangements for effecting these improvements should oe put in hand forthwith. We have, however, informed the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of what is proposed by telegram, of which I enclose a copy. 2. You will see that our telegram says that it is hoped that the question of the cost of the improvements will be left for settlement along with the cost of the diversion scheme recently undertaken. It will be understood that, as in the case of trie diversion scheme, the Government of India are not in any way committed to contributing towards the expenditure which these measures will i3.
