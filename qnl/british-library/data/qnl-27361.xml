I have the honour to submit the supplementary agreement (in original with translation) concluded with the Idrisi. I also forward herewith a memorandum on this agreement which has been drawn up at my request by Lieu tenant-Colon el H. F. Jacob. 2 . I trust that the agreement will meet with the approval of His Excellency the A iceroy and His Majesty’s Government. The main object of the agreement, as set forth in paragraph III., has been secured, and without making further concessions than, as brought out in the memorandum, the situation required. 3. It must be recollected that the Idrisi is now in a very difficult frame of mind. The Kunlida affair still rankles deep ; the rapidity of our action in Farasan is to him uncalled for and unintelligible, and our comparative inaction in Arabia is misunderstood. Fixed, too, is his conviction that when peace is concluded the old friendship of England and Turkey will secure for the latter very favourable terms, and allow her to concentrate her power against her present Arab enemies. 4. Extreme patience, ready appreciation, and great knowledge of the Arab were required in effecting this agreement. All were fully displayed by Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob, and I am glad to have this opportunity of bringing his services to notice. I have, &amp;c., J. M.

MEMORANDUM ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY CONCLUDED WITH THE IDRISI SAIYID ON ENGAGEMENT 22nd JANUARY 1917. In this engagement with the Idrisi it may appear at first sight that we have given more than the occasion demanded. The truth is that the Idrisi refused point blank to admit the really essential paragraph HI. without his counter-proposals being added. It is necessary to understand his attitude. The Idrisi does not know how the war will end. Last year he was certain the Allies would win. He is less hopeful now. Then, he feared we might patch up a peace which left the Turks “ in situ ” as his implacable foes : to-day, he looks round and sees9 O them very much to the fore in Arabia and holding their own. He cites Lahej, Kunfida and the failure there ; the slow progress of the Sherif of Mecca, and finally Mesopotamia, and he doubts our ability to dislodge them. His fears to-day are two-fold. He believes that— (1) his refusal to treat with any other Power, and his promise not to dispose of Farasan Islands and rights therein, will draw' upon him Turkish animosity. The Turks up to now have watched his coquetry with us but believe they can win him back to the fold hereafter. Let them once come to know of his closer “ nexus' with us as regards the Islands and they will regard him as completely ostracised. There is no arguing with a fanatic of such preconceived notions ; ( 2 ) this engagement will deprive him of future assistance in arms and ammunition from Djibouti and Massowa, both of vdiich places have for many years very considerably assisted in the arms traffic. Cut off from these two sources of supply to whom, he asks, should he apply for the necessary sinew r s of war, and whom should he approach hereafter except the British Government ? The Government must therefore take the place of these two Powers. The sole Pov'er the Idrisi fears now, and after the war, is Turkey aided by Germany, and the reason given for securing not only our promise of assistance in arms, but of advice in the development of his country, an asylum—should a crisis in the country compel his temporary withdrawal- coupled with the assurance of a continuation of these terms after the war to himself and successors—is this one inordinate fear of a prospectively irate Turkey. From this obsession he could not be dissuaded. At first it w^as our flag that would incense the Turks, and on the second visit it would be the engagement to refrain from a cession of the Islands that was bound to arouse Turkish resentment. At one time in the proceedings the Idrisi had insisted on the despatch of British troops inland, if he w'ere attacked by the Turks, but I reminded him that cur earlier treaty was confined to his sea-board and to protection by sea power. 1 may say that although this engagement in its inception was peculiar to the Farasan Islands, yet the Idrisi was loud in predicting for the whole of his territories the ill-forebodings he had conjured up as the likely result of his agreeing to paragraph 111. It was therefore not possible—given the desideratum df securing his adhesion to this paragraph—to exclude from the agreement this extended area of his entire sea-board. His Minister (Ba Sahi) declared (and we cannot refute it) that the Farasan Islands were 1 Date of first treaty. tlle , Mnsi’s before the 30th April 1915,1 and that, though not specifically men tioned, the Farasan became at once a part and parcel of his sea-board and within the purview of that treaty: One result of the present agreement will be the exclusion of Italian influence in the Idrisi’s domains. His Minister told me that the Italians were very desirous of concluding some agreement with the Idrisi to secure a quid pro quo of their long established connection qua the arms^trade, and that even now the Italians sent him ammunition. At the same time the Idrisi scouted the idea of dealing with any Bower save Great Britain, and to our Government he looked for every form of assistance. As regards paragraph V. I found it impolitic to insist on any fixed number of his retainers on the Island. I had insisted on “ a number not less than one hundred men,” but this was met by the argument that many more might be required and the exact number had best be left to time anil circumstance. The Minister who was deputed on board said that the Farasan Islanders were a very stout body of men who would give a good account of themselves if necessary. 1 waived the point of numbers for I was dealing with a peculiar cast of man, and was guided also by the principle that especially with Asiatics, is it unwise to insist on what one cannot enforce nor supervise without causing friction. It is enough that he has engaged to ensure his “effective occupation. ’wummmmmmm i % At our lirst meeting the Idrisi could not understand whose intervention we feared. It could not be an enemy, for we surely had conti ol of the ^ Sea outlets. As for allies, were they not our friends ? ^ i^erfered h or if we would anticipate such a contretemps— we should tell them that t , islands were Idrisi, seized by him from the enomy manned by him and ns ilag hoisted, to show his occupation, and, finally, that he was undei B Pr °Such announcement seems to me very essential. I am not aware of any future cut-and-dried division of the several interests m the Red Sea, but it had occurred to me that to hoist our flag and to land our troops would sarour of British occupation and place these islands ipso facto within the categoiy of matters to be adjusted after the war. . i ,1 i We are already assisting the Idrisi with the sinews of war, and the onR foe after the war against whom he asks protection is the l urk —it he lattei is left in the’Asir province. The necessity for such protection alter peace is concluded is very problematical, if at all possible. The Idrisi would not sign the English copy. It was unreasonable, he said to sign what you cannot understand. He however retained both Arabic and English copies. I did not press him to comply. His case is a peculiar one. The agreement was concluded and signed, after much cross inference, on the evening of the 22nd instant, and H.M.S. Minto was asked by wireless telegraphy on 23rd idem to remove troops and flag, which he die that same day. T t t r o t&gt; i 1 would thank Commander G. Arnot, Iv.ivR., HALS. T erth, and Lieutenant L. P. Nalder, R.N.V.R., the Political Officer of the Southern Red Sea Patrol, for their cordial co-operation in dealing with the Idrisi. He is the most suspicious and the most exclusive individual of his class I have ever encountered in Arabian politics. A give-and-take policy was indicated, as he himself was only too ready to remind me. (Signed) H. F. Tacob, Lieutenant-Colonel, II.M S.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. SECRET. War. To the Most Honourable the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, Mv Lord Marquess, 20th May 1915. With reference to your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 17th February 1915, we have the honour to forward, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government, a copv of a letter 1 from 1 Xo - °- 343 - dated the lst Ma y 191 °- om- Political Resident at Aden, with which he submits a Treaty signed by himself and by the representatives of the Idrisi Saiyid, for the ratification of the Government of India. I. This Treaty does not appear to have been very concisely or very clearly drafted, but the terms generally coincide with what your Lordship approved in your telegram of the 28th December 1914. The Idrisi, on his side, undertakes to make a pact of friendship between himself and the British Government, to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to extend his territories at their expense, and at the same time to abstain from any hostile or provocative action against the Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. The British Government, on their side, undertake to protect his territories from attack on the seaboard, to guarantee his independence in his own domain, and at the conclusion of the war to use diplomatic means to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi and the Imam. Further, they have no desire to enlarge their territories on Arabian soil but wish merely to see that the various Arab rulers live peaceably and amicably together, each in his own sphere. As a mark of appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government have aided him with funds and munitions and undertake to give him further assistance in the prosecution of his campaign against the Turks, in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities. Finally, the British Government agree as heretofore to give the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden. 3. The only point that appears to require definite qualification is the expression “Arabian soil” in Article 6 , as this scarcely falls in with our position in Mesopotamia. If the words “ Western Arabia ” were substituted for “ Arabian soil,” this objection would be removed and our intentions would be sufficiently defined in the Treaty. 4 . It might also perhaps be urged that by allowing the Idrisi under Article 3 to extend his territories and at the same time under Article 5 guaranteeing his independence hereafter, we may be bringing ourselves into an embarrassing position vis-a-vis other Arab Chiefs, but our position in2 this — is oflle ;fth other Arab Chiefs ^ an aggressive pohey,. we could point to this condition and disavow his acti . 5. Further, it might have been desirable to insert a of the pact of friendship which it is the object of the Treaty to consolidate. r a c- fnrthpr assistance in funds or munitions to the Idrisi is V •flv fn be in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi s activities, our responsibilities in this matter would appear to be sufficiently safeguard ed. 7 We think, therefore, that, although the Treaty as drafted . 1S 0 P e1 *.^ objection on the ground that it is neither very clear nor if the small amendment suggested in paiagiapr o , i | ’ adequately meet the requirements of d&gt;c Bduat.om 1 e wonW^ask, therefore, for authority to ratify it as it stands subject to th q^h To return it for extensive revision to our Political Resident would be to endanger the ultimate success of the negotiations, and would, at any rate invohe undesirable delay. If Your Lordship agrees, we should be glad of orders by telegraph. We have&gt; 4 ,^ My Lord Marquess. (Signed) Hardinge of Penshurst. Beauchamp Duff. R. W. Carlyle. , S. A. Imam. W. H. Clark. R. H.

Shaw, Political Resident Aden, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In sending you by this mail three copies of the Treaty signed by me and the Idrisi Saiyid for the ratification of the Government of India, I have the honor to state that the Idrisi representatives will leave to-morrow lor their country. They appear to mean business. 2. There is little left to be said. Paragraph 5 is the most important one, and is in accord with the cipher instructions received from you. 3. Paragraph 7. The precise details of assistance in funds and munition is expressly omitted at the request of Saiyid Mustafa and is done to avoid wounding Arab susceptibilities. A receipt in full for assistance given has however been obtained. The concluding portion of this paragraph is very essential. Having begun a good work with so important a Cnief, and one so inimical to everything Turkish, it will be necessary to prosecute the matter d outrance, but I was careful to insert the last nine words of the paragraph as showing the quid pro quo for which the Idrisi is responsible. 4. I would request that two ratified copies of the Treaty may be returned to me, one to be given to the Idrisi and the other for this office records. This Treaty of Friendship and Goodwill is signed by Major-General D. G. L. Saw, the Political Resident, Aden, on behalf of the British Govern ment and* by Saiyid Mustafa bin Saiyid Abdu’l ’Ali on the part of His3 Eminence Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris, the Idrisi Saiyid and Amir of Sabia and its environments. 2. Its main objects are to war against the Turks and to consolidate a pact of friendship between the British Government and the Idrisi Saiyid, above- mentioned, and his Tribesmen. 3 The Idrisi Saiyid agrees to attack and to endeavour to drive the-Turks from'their stations in the Yemen and to the best of his power to harass the Turkish troops in the direction of the Yemen and to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks. 4. The Saiyid’s prime objective will he against the lurks only, and he will abstain from any hostile or provocative action against Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. 5 The British Government undertakes to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid’s territories from all attack on the seaboard from any enemy who may molest him ; to guarantee his independence in his own domain and at the con clusion of the war to use every diplomatic means in its power to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya oi any^ other rival. The British Government has no desire to enlarge its borders on Arabian soil but wishes solely to seethe various-Arab rulers living peacefully and amicably together each in his own sphere, and all in friendship wit i t e British Government. 7. As a mark of its appreciation of the work to be performed by 7 the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government has aided him with both funds and munitions and will continue to assist him in the prosecution of the war so long as it lasts in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities. 8 . Finally, while maintaining a strict blockade on all Turkish ports in the Red Sea, the British Government has for some months past been giving the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden, and this concession the British Government, in token of the friendship existing, will continue uninterruptedly to maintain. 9. This Treaty will be held to be valid after its ratification by the Government of India.

My Lob,i&gt; Marquess, With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 17th Febru ary 1915, we have the honour to forward, for the consideration of His Majesty’s o , , u Government, a copv of a letter* from * No. C. 343, dn ted the 1st May 1915. t&gt; in i. i. * i ' -.t our Political Resident at Aden, with which he submits a Treaty signed by himself and by the representatives of the Idrisi Saiyid, for the ratification of the Government of India. 2. This Treaty does not appear to have been very concisely or very clearly drafted, but the terms generally coincide with what Your Lordship approved in your telegram of the 28th December 1911. The Idrisi, on his side, undertakes to make a pact of friendship between himself and the British Government, to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to extend his territories at their expense, and at the same time to abstain from any hostile or provocative action against the Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. The British Government, on their side, undertake to protect his territories from attack on the seaboard, to guarantee his independence in his own domain, and at the conclusion of the war to use diplomatic means to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi and the Imam. Further, they have no desire to enlarge their territories on Arabian soil but wish merely to see that the various Arab rulers live peaceably and amicably together, each in his own sphere. As a mark of appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government have aided him with funds and munitions and undertake to give him further assistance in the prosecution of his campaign against the Turks, in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities. Finally, the British Government agree as heretofore to give the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scone to trade and traific between his ports and Aden. 3. The only point that appears to require definite qualification is the expression “Arabian soil ” in Article 6, as this scarcely falls in with our position in Mesopotamia. If the words “ Western Arabia ” were substituted for “ Arabian soil,” this objection would be removed and our intentions would be sufficiently defined in the Treaty. 4. It might also perhaps be urged that by allowing the Idrisi under Article 3 to extend his territories and at the same time under Article 5 guaranteeing his independence hereafter, we may be bringing ourselves into an embarrassingposition vis-h-vis other Arab Chiefs, hut our position in. this matter is safe guarded. by the condition that the extension of the Idiisi s territories should he at the expense of the Turks, and should he hereafter involve himself in a collision with other Arab Chiefs by an aggressive policy, we could point to this condition and disavow his action. 5. Further, it might have been desirable to insert a clause giving British and British Indian traders free access to the Idrisi’s ports, but this might legitimately be held to be a corollary of the pact of friendship which it is the object of the Treaty to consolidate. 6. As any further assistance in funds or munitions to the Idrisi is explicitly to be in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities, our responsibilities in this matter would appear to be sufficiently safeguarded. 7. We think, therefore, that, although the Treaty as drafted is . open to objection on the ground that it is neither very clear nor very concise, it will, if the small amendment suggested in paragraph 3 above be effected, adequately meet the requirements of the situation. We would ask, therefore, for authority to ratify it as it stands subject to this qualification. To return it for extensive revision to our Political Resident would be to endanger the ultimate success of the negotiations, and would, at any rate, involve undesirable delay. If Your Lordship agrees, we should be glad of orders by telegraph. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HARDINGE or PENSHURST. „ BEAUCHAMP DUFF. „ R. W. CARLYLE. „ S. A. IMAM. „ W. H. CLARK. „ R. H. CRADDOCK. „ W. S. MEYER. 31 C. H. A. HILL.No. C. 343, dated Aden Residency, the 1st May 1915 (Secret)* From— Major-General D. G. L. Shaw, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. In sending yon by this mail three copies of the Treaty signed by me and the Idrisi Saiyid for the ratification of the Government of India, I have the honour to state that the Idrisi representatives will leave to-morrow for their country. They appear to mean business. 2. There is little left to be said. Paragraph 5 is the most important one, and is in accord with the cipher instructions received from you. 3. Paragraph 7. The precise details of assistance in funds and munition is expressly omitted at the request of Saiyid Mustafa and is done to avoid wounding Arab susceptibilities. A receipt in full for assistance given has however been obtained. The concluding portion of this paragraph is very essential. Having begun a good work with so important a Chief, and one so inimical to everything Turkish, it will be necessary to prosecute the matter a entrance, but I was careful to insert the last nine words of the paragraph as showing the quid pro quo for which the Idrisi is responsible. 4. I would request that two ratified copies of the Treaty may be returned to me, one to be given to the Idrisi and the other for this office records. This Treaty of Friendship and Goodwill is signed by Major-General J). G. L. Shaw, the Political Resident, Aden, on behalf of the British Government and by Saiyid Mustafa bin Saiyid AbduT ’Ali on the part of His Eminence Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris the Idrisi Saiyid and Amir of Sabia and its environments. 2. Its main objects are to war against the Turks and to consolidate a pact of friendship between the British Government and the Idrisi Sajyid, abovementioned, and his Tribesmen. 3. The Idrisi Saiyid agrees to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from' their -stations in the Yemen and to the best of his power to harass the Turkish troops in the direction of the Yemen and to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks. 4. The Saiyid’s prime objective will be against the Turks only, and he will abstain from any hostile or provocative action against Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. 5. The British Government undertakes to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid’s territories from all attack on the seaboard from any enemy who may molest him ; to guarantee his independence in his own domain and at the conclusion of the war to use every diplomatic means in its power to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya or any other rival. 6. The British Government has no desire to enlarge its borders on Arabian soil but wishes solely to see the various Arab rulers li^^S peacefully and amicably together each in his own sphere, and all in friendship with the British Government. 7. As a mark of its appreciation of the work to. be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government has aided him with both funds and munitions and will continue to assist him in the prosecution of the war so long as it lasts in accordance with the measure of the IdnsTs activities. 8. Finally, while maintaining a strict blockade on all Turkish ports in the Bed Sea, the British Government has for some months past been giving the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden, and this concession the British Government, in token of the friendship existing, will continue uninterruptedly to maintain.1 t§&gt; &amp; &amp; e? iIo*Cr 2) —- 1 T | &amp;-/ia ADEIJ KKSIDENCY, ^ ^ May 1917&lt; Erom, L 11 / To, U n dn h ■ / 4 5 Major-General J« M* Stewart, CaE«, Political Resident, Aden; Tne Right Hon’ble Austen Chamberlain, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, India, Office, London* Sir, In continuation of my Secret telegram Ho*A*P*.?49, dated the 1st May 1917, I have the honour to forward a copy of a report received from Commander Craufurd, H.M 0 So H , iinto M dealing with the question of the search of the S* S* w Massaua w * 'being 2* Copies of this letter and accompaniment are ior- warded to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla and His Britannic Majesty’s High Commissioner, Cai ro* I have the honour to 'be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Have informed Navy, Aden.** On account of this signal, w Minto M proceeded north towards GIZAN at 5 a.m* 25th April* The steamer was sighted at anchor off GIZAN at 5.30 P.M At 7-20 p.m. H Minto H sent a Boarding Officer to this steamer &lt;$*- and enchored within one and half cables of her* At the same time, the Arabic Interpreter of f, Minto M was sent ashore. He requested the Sheikh of Gizan to take no cargo from this steamer, until ’’Minto” had assured herself that this steamer had genuine friendly relations with the Idrisi tribe* The Sheikh of Gizan was also..requested to in terview the Commanding off icer, M Minto M at 7 a.m* next morning. The Boarding Officer returned, together with Captain C. Dolce, the Captain of S.S* “Massaua', ItaL ian Maritima, - the ship in question* Captain C* Dolce informed me that he had no cargo for Gizan, but that he had orders to receive a cargo of Bullocks from Gizan. This cargo was for the Italian Government Autho rities at Massowa. The Captain of S.S. 'Massaua” brou^it with him such ship's papers ae he had, which were incomplete, BriendlyFriendly relations were ensured during this and forthcoming interviews, with the Italian Steamer* The Arabic Interpreter on returning to 'Minto* 1 informed the Commanding Officer that no cargo had been landed, but Mahomed Salim, was the Interpreter of the Ita lian ship, and that Sheikh Mahomed Ba Sahi is the Arab agent for the cargo of Bullocks of S* S*‘'Massaua'* Sheikh Abdul, the Sheikh of Gizan called aboard H*M.S* ^Minto 1 * at 7 a.m* April 26th* He assured the Command ing officer, that the Steamer was bringing no cargo for Gizan, but was taking 400 Bullocks from Gizan* The Arabs had known some six weeks previously, that ri~ this steamer would arrive. It is suggested that Seyed Idisi A should have informed Commanding Officer M Minto” of this fact during a previous interview, April 19th* The Interpreter from ’’Minto” was sent to the shore at frequent intervals, during 'Minto’s” stay at Gizan from April 25th to April 22th* He is moderately certain that S^Si^Massaua 1 ' landed no cargo of any bulk during this period* The Interpreter of S*8* M Massaua M was Mahomed Salim* This Interpreter was aboard the Italian Gunboat 'Ledo' 1 when that vessel recently paid a flying visit to Gizan* Seyed Mahomed bin Idrisi paid a visit to Gizan with the ostensible purpose of calling a meeting of his Sheikhs* He stayed in Gizan from 4 p.m* to 6 p*m* April 26th, Mahomed Salim interviewed Seyed Idrisi on this occasion. The subject matter of their intjy^view is not known* From the general appearance of S. S,’’Massaua” she did not seem to be empty, and it was therefore reported to the Senior Haval Officer, that she appeared to be half 3.aden* April 28th. Commanding ofricer ‘•Minto 11 requested Captain C. Dolce of S.3* ’'Massaua*' to meet him outside Gizan when he was proceeding South. ihis step was taken because S. S.’’Massaua*' was decidedly( A'E j faster than II.

He therefore hoped that there would not be any unnecessary delay of search, and that he would be able to leave Kamaran that evening* He told Lieuta T,B*ilel son,'R,]!,R* that he would be very willing to allow this officer to search the ship,whilst under weigh, and tha/t he would give every assistance in that search* Lieut* Nelson was therefore instructed to carry on with that search .and to report to the Commanding Officer,H*M*S* 'Minto' whether or no he considered the search entirely complete and satisfactory* I At 5*20 P*M* Lieut* Nelson reported search complete and entirely satisfactory* Both ship* stonoed* Lieut.Nelson A returned to w Minto M . S*S. ,, Massaua w was released and an rnspfcy entry was placed in her Log to the effect that she had been searched and released* Captain C.

I am directed \yj the S*of S. for I. to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th May 1917, No.W.98379, transmitting copy of a telegraphic report from the Naval Commander-in-Chief, E.Indies station, received through the Admiralty, regarding the visit of an Italian agent to the Idrisi Saiyid of Asir. The incident referred to by the Naval Commander-in-Chief is evidently the visit of the Italian s.s.'Massowa' on the 25th April last to the Idrisi port of Jaizan, already reported by the Resident at Aden in his telegrams Nos.347 and 349 A.P. of the 30th April and 1st May 1917, copies of which were communicated to your Department and to the Admiralty on the 2nd instant. Copy of a further telegram from the Resident on the subject is enclosed herewith* It will be seen that the 'Massowa' was examined at Camaran after her visit to- Jaizan, and that nothing of an objectionable nJobjectionable nature was found in her cargo. The Resident’s latest telegram would seem to indicate that the supposed negotiations between the Idrisi and theltalian authorities may be of a commercial rather than a political nature. ♦ But Mr. Secretary Chamberlain would prefer to await the receipt of the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s full report before considering what further steps it may be practicable to take in the matter. In the meantime the Admiral’s telegraphic report has been communicated by telegraph to the G. of I. and the Resident at Aden. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Admitalty and to the War Office. (S-) A. Hirtzel,TELEGRAM FROM RESIDENT, ADEN, DATED 21ST MAY, 1917.

Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea patrol, again brings to my notice that usefulness of southern Red Sea patrol is largely impaired by want of co-operation of our French and Italian neighbours on the African coast. We have ample proof that no supervision is exercised over the ( hows sailing from their ports although they are aware of the orders that all dhows from French and Italian ports for Jaizan should call at Kamaran on outward and homeward voyages. Yet we know that dhows from both territories visit .Medi and daizan without complying with regulations The Italian authorities admitted that their dhows trade with Jaizan vet in last seven months only three Italian dhows called at Kamaran. Also we know that French dhows from Jibuti and Obokh are deliberately runniim the blockade and landing goods at Dhubab and other places. ' Dhows Irom Massowah and Assab are doing same. There are now cargoes of five French dhows up before the Prize Court for running the blockade. Latelv, French- man Monsjeur de Monfried was arrested in his dhow within a few miles of Dhubab; the incidents of the Italian steamers “Lido” and “Massowah” have been communicated. There has been lengthy correspondence with Jocai Italian Consul and French Consul who have loyally done everything in their power to RuuDorc our reouest for co-operation. French and Italian Covernors have promised to do what they can, but reports show clearly that very little control is being maintained and the amount of cargoes run is on the increase. I would request, if possible, some pressure might be brought bear from home to insist on proper supervision.h 4 ? Sr ty L 191 / \h i c v ,&lt;*. i Clrculuted to The Klnf; and ^far Cabine t.

Recent article in Italian Press and other indica tions lead to tne supposition that Italian Government have, or are about to, put forward a claim to special interests in nsir and Yemen. General design of our recent agreements hub 'been apparently framed with object of securing our roads to India and, by assisting other interested Powers to make spheres of interest remote from these roads, to prevent them making interests near the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, be are also by encouraging Arab aspirations, doing our utmost to create a series of independent Arab areas favourable to our selves and hostile to Turkey. I submit that general objects of these arrangements would be jeopardised as regards Red Sea if French were permitted to acquire political influence in nedjaz or Italian interests in South Nest Arabia* The riedjaz question is I hope in process of solu tion but aspirations of Italians in Idrisi country and on coast to south of it need careful attention, a.u.d i shall be glad to be informed of his Majesty's Govern ments policy in regard to them.Telegram from Political Resident at Aden. .Dated 1st May,1917.

With reference to your letter of the 8th March, there are now with the King of the Hejaz the following British and Egyptian troops:- B ltl h _ 39 officers, 73 other ranks. Egyptian - 47 officers, 957 other ranks, 22 civilians. There are very few French troops in the country, but accurate^ numbers are not known and can only be given after enquiry from the Chief of the French Mission in Egypt. With reference to your letter of the 17th March, the Council are of opinion that the reply which Monsieur Briand proposed to make to the Italian Government affords an opportunity to the latter of sending Italian troops to the He 3 az in the event of the present situation there being reversed, and that, as such cooperation on the part of the Italians would lead to difficulties, it would be preferable to excise any allusion to such an eventuality. They would therefore suggest that the reply should be confined to informing the Italians that no more British troops are being sent to the assistance of the King of the Hejaz, and that it is desirable that the latter should carry out any future operations which he may find necessary without the assistance of foreign troops I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (sgd) B.B.Cubitt.

V % ;&gt;• .-A IS \ B. 247. BRITISH INTERESTS IN ARABIA. It is understood that a memorandum is desired, explaining why the exclusion of Italy from Western and Southern Arabia and the Red Sea littoral is important in British interests. 1. The importance of Arabia from its geographical position, lying along two of the main approaches to India, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, is a commonplace. Ro part of the country can be completely indifferent to Great Britain, who is the only Power that at present has a foothold in the country. Our hold is limited to a narrow fringe along the coast, from Aden to Koweit; its security depends ultimately upon the tranquillity of the interior. Since we are unable to intervene in, or control, the interior, it is essential to exclude all possible seeds of disturbance. 2. Arabia is not a State in any effective sense, but a fortuitous concourse of tribes—more or less settled in the fertile regions near the coast, elsewhere wandering—under Chiefs, the limits of whose sway are determined, not by frontiers, but by the tribes which they for the time being control. Their politics are closely interwoven, and a quarrel may run right across the continent. With the tribes and Chiefs along the coast mentioned we have treaty relations. 3. In addition to this we occupy at Aden an area of 75 square miles with a considerable hinterland, the frontier of which, with the Yemen, has been demarcated. The Chiefs within this frontier are under our protec torate. 4. The strategical importance of Aden need not be emphasised. The fortress of Aden is almost impregnable against tribal forces. In circum stances as they existed before the war we could hold it with a very small force, and control the protectorate by means of prestige and subsidies. 5. The Aden-Yemen frontier is a frontier quoad the Turks, not quoad the Arabs, who do not greatly respect it. Its demarcation was necessitated largely by the intrigues of our semi-independent neighbour the Imam of Sanaa, whom the Turks encouraged when it served their purpose, but could never effectively control when he chose to defy them. But we had recognised Turkish authority, and whenever some petty local incident occurred the only remedy was representations at Constantinople. The Imam has pretty extensive claims on our side of the frontier—indeed, they extend to the Hadramaut tribes on the coast the other side of the protectorate. To the north and north-east, where the frontier has not been demarcated, we are safeguarded by the great desert, the Ruba al Khali, and by our treaty relations with the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, which, however, suffice only so long as the tribes of the Hadramaut hinterland are not tampered with. b. In addition to being a fortress, Aden is the gateway of a considerable land trade with the Yemen (worth before the war about 300,0001. per annum). The construction of a railway from Aden to Taiz—desirable for political reasons as well—would make Aden the main outlet for the trade of the Yemen. If another Power is master of the Yemen, it will build a line from Hodeida to Sanaa ; Hodeida will become the outlet, and Aden will lose the trade it alread}- possesses. 7. It is the Yemen on which Italian ambitions are mainly fixed. The Yemen is as little a unity as Arabia itself, and when the Turk is ejected from Arabia it will fall to no one Arab master. The Idrisi, we know, will claim S 358 ^!r3=5! down to and including Hodeida, tlie Imam of Sanaa will claim the greater part of the remainder, and there are certain Sheikhs (like Mavia) on our border whom it will be to our interest to maintain independent. We have by treaty guaranteed the independence of the Idrisi in his own domain (undefined), and undertaken to arbitrate between him and the Imam where their claims clash. The Idrisi and the Imam are possibly irreconcilable adversaries, though the removal of the Turk may bring them closer together. 8. The Italo-Turkish war made Italy the most unpopular of the Christian Powers in the Moslem world. This unpopularity is enhanced by Italian methods of colonial administration, and by national characteristics— in particular by Italian treatment of the women of subject races, a point on which Moslem opinion is very sensitive. Moreover, the Iman has an especial ground for detestation m that Italy blockaded his coast, and supported the Idrisi with arms and money during the war. 9. From the preceding description of the general political conditions it must be clear that the appearance of Italy in the Temen would create in Western and Southern Arabia a ferment which would not be limited to that region, and from which we, as the limitrophe Power, would be the chief sufferers. Our consent to it would be resented by the Grand Shereef and by the Arabs as a breach of faith towards the so-called Arab State, and it is probable that this resentment would be shared by the whole Moslem world (including India) who would consider that, after having betrayed the Turk, we were now betraying the Arab. This would react unfavourably on our position at Aden, and our reputation as a Power friendly to Islam. The Arabs have made use of our support against the Turks, but they do not like us any the more ; and when the Turkish danger is removed it is by no means certain that the brunt of their dislike will not in any case fall on us, and with redoubled force if it is thought that we have released them from the Turk (who is at least a Moslem) only to hand them over to the most hated of Christian nations. If the Idrisi, in virtue of his former connection, welcomes the - Italians, it is certain that the Imam will oppose them. That will mean hostilities on our border, ending at the best in a precarious peace, seeing that the Italians will be far too exhausted to undertake decisive operations in the hills. With our experience of Italian relations with the Senussi in Cyrenaica, and of the resultant friction with Egypt, we may know what to look for in Aden, and we may expect before very long to be ourselves involved iit hostilities on, if not within, our own border. If, on the other hand, the Imam accepts Italian domination, it must be expected that part of the price he will ask will be the support (at least tacit) of his claims where they will not conflict with Italy’s, i.e., in our protectorate and in the Hadramaut; and against his intrigues we shall have no redress but appeals to Rome, which are likely to be even less fruitful than were appeals to Constantinople. If these anticipations are w r ell founded, it is clear that our position in Aden will have to be put on an entirely different footing. Instead of keeping a handful of troops in the fortress and exercising a weak control over the tribes by subsidies, we shall have to hold the Protectorate in force—and this is surely not a prospect which His Majesty’s Government can regard with equanimity. 10. The present war has shown the use that may be made against us of Islam. Arabia is of great importance in the Islamic world, not only as the cradle of Islam and the seat of the Holy Places, but also because its geographical position interposes it as a wedge between the Islam of Africa and that of India and the surrounding countries. 11. The ultimate success of the policy of His Majesty’s Government m the Middle East depends to a large extent on the transfer of the Caliphate from Turkey to Arabia. This in turn depends upon the possibility ofmaking the ruler of the Hejaz sufficiently strong to he able to pose as an independent sovereign. This again depends upon keeping the Christian Powers at a sufficient distance. But an Italian occupation of the Yemen would—from the relations in which the two regions stand to one another— make Italy the mistress of the Hejaz. “If A1 Yemen goes, Islam is gone,” an Arab Saiyid said to Colonel Jacob as long ago as 1912. These are some of the reasons for which we took the precaution of providing in the Anglo-French Convention that “ the British and French “ Governments agree that they will not themselves acquire and will not “ consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian “ peninsula.” For the present purpose a sphere of influence is equivalent to territorial possession. 20th January 1917.

Sir, In reply to your letter No. W. 220218/16 of tha 15th Novemher 1916, transraittlng e. copy of the memo randa communicated hy the Italian ambassador cn the partition of Asiatic Turkey, I am commanded by the Army council to inform you that although the Italian demands run counter to the requirements of Fr, nee, the aspirations of Greece, and the future of an hypothetical O'ctoman state, they are of opinion that the importance to the Ententa of retaining the goodwill of Italy renders it essential that hmr claims in Asia Minor should be conceded as far as possible. 2. They would point out to Mr. Balfour that Italy has a real need of productive territory oversea H'. r , ^ ~\ for hsr surplus population, and that the Smyrna vilayet would not only constitute a. most suitable field for such expansion, hut would also, if in the possession of Italy, he developed on national lines more assuredly than if it remained under Greek influence. 3. While giving due weight to Lord Grey's observation regarding the needs of a future Turkish State the Council do not consider that the requirements of a state which may eventually he absorbed by powerful neighbours should be allowed to interfere with the reasonablereasonable claim ef the Italian Government to the •ost fi-voui.rble portions of the seaboard* \/hile cufficlent harbour facilitiee could be found by the Turks In the Gulf of Adramyti and on tho section of coast line adjacent to the mouth of the Gyuk su, the French Government might be invited to accept Mersina end its immediate vicinity as the western limit of their coast line. 4. It does not, however, appear practical to the Council to attempt a definition of territory in terms of vilayets, as the boundaries of Turkish provinces were not determined originally on economic or geographical lines but rather with an idea of enhancing the difficulties of introducing modifications which might lead to a reasonable adjustment of the same. They would invite the attention of hr. B; Ifour to the I attached map, by which it will Ice seen that area marked ^ might be assigned to -i-taly as a colony and area marked as a sphere of commercial enterprise, the latter area also forming the southernmost portion of a future Ottoman St at e • 5. The Council would suggest the advisability of declining to enter into any agreement with the Italians re.:, aiding the cession of Cyprus* 6, The Council view with somo apprehension the demand of the Italian Government to participate on an ehual footing with the other three powers of tho Entente in discussions on Arabian matters or in negotiations with the Sheikhs of Arabia in consequence of the hostile feeling in the Arab wbrld which Italy has created towards herselfiKrseli by her action in Tripoli, while the claim put forward by the Larquis Imperial! that Italy is a Mussulman Power to the sane degree as her Allies appears to have no foundation in fact. As regards the Islands in the lied Sea it sc.ms most desirable to retain Kamaran as a British possession and the inclusion of the remainder in an Independent Arabia would no doubt be a convenient way of preventing an ext ..ns ion of Italian inf lu^nco in that quarter. 7. The recognition of Italy as being directly in.uerested in the international administration and in the ■ oly places of Palestine is a proper request and the Council see no reason for withholding from Italy such rights in respect of the harbour of Haifa as are conceded to Prance.- Italy, on the otbur hand, should be required to recognize our r, ilway rights between Haifa and Area ii, and to respect the civic and colonizing rights of the Jcv/s in Palestine, I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (signed) b.

My Lords are in general sympathy with the view that the Italian claims are excessive and inopportun Moreover, if the agreement between the Allied Powers as regards Asiatic Turkey is to be regarded as a definition of their war aims in that part of the world, failing fulfilment of which they propose to continue the war, it apnears to be a question whether, so far from amplifying the scope of the agreement in the sens® desired by Italy, it may not be necessary to recognise that even the conditions contemplated in the existing Franco-Russo-Dritish agreement are not likely to be fulfilled. These are, however, matters of a political character on wbiich My Lords do not conceive it to be necessary for them to comment in detail. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed).

We have no territory close to (except Cyprus, which has no adequate harbour) for establishing b^ses from which to control this coast. Until an effoctivo antidote to the submarine has been discovered, the trade route through the Mediterranean will be very precarious in case of war with any Mediterranean power. Submarines acting from French or Italian ports, and from the ports of their African dependencies, could make the maintenance of our communications through the Mediterranean extremely diffioult so that our communication with India1 xiui a iXijj. -Oxie ih'Mb v. doll a iia'v/6'Do' De principally rr£untain3d by ihe Gape rouPe c The poGsession of additional ports at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean by either France or Italy would not add roach to the danger on cur trade route to Eccypt because the submarines could act Quite as enactively from the existing French and Italian ports. They would, however, add to our difficulties in supporting a garrison at Haifa if WG there c It should perhaps be added that At as Bay in the hands of Italy would dominate Hlexandretta anc. oO constitute a seiious threat to a French tenure of that port. On the other hand, our submarinesworking from Gibraltar, Ma}ta and Egypt, could act very effectively against the trade of either France or Italy so long as we were able to held those positions, and we could aiso make it difficult for them to send supplies and reinforcements to their garrisons in Asia Minor or Syria. Bases established out of touch with the mother country are in the first place dependent on the command oi tne sea, unless they have a large reserve behind them of provisions and munitions. So far there are no such reserves in Asia Minor; but there is no guarantee that they right not be created in time. It is not the immediate future only that should be considered but the position as it is likely to be in the next generation.generation. The country Italy is claiming is very rich, both minerally and agriculturally, hut it is «t developed. Whether it is possible ior imly to -evelop this country u:iaided is doubtful; and if derman exploitation of Italian industry is to be continued after the war, we might be faced with a slightly disguised re-establishment of German control in Anatolia, and with its military consequences &amp;!_ The provisions of the Franco-British agreement in regard to the Arabian peninsula are purely negative, viz:- that the two powers will not themselves acquire and will not consent to a third party acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian peninsula, or consent to a third party constructing a naval base on the Islands of the East coast of the Red Sea. Participation by Italy in a self-denying ordinance of this sort would not in itself be open to objection ircm a naval point oi view. It is nevertheless to he observed that the Italian enquiry whether the Islands of the Eastern Arabian coast are considered as forming part of the territory assigned to the independent Arab State appears to point to a desire tt inquire &amp; base in these Islands. The acquisition by any Surer can power of further territory in the Red Sea would bo highly objectionable from a Naval poinu 01 view.

Neither the Italian position in the Adalia region, nor Italy’s commercial interests in other parts of the area under consideration, appear to the Board to afford any ^ adequate justification for this extensive claim, -the available Under-Secretary of Stateavailable Turkish trade statistics ore not of a very recent or satisfactory character, but so far as they go they indicate that the inports from Italy into ke^sina prior to the war were markedly inf or i or in value to those from both the British Empire and Prance, whilst Italy's shipping interests at th-t port were surpassed by those of tho United Kingdom and Russia. The Italian share in the import trade of omyrna, though substantial, was only a small pro portion of the total, whilst the share of the British Umpire was very large; and there is also in the Srryrna area the important British interest represented by the Smyrna-Aidin Railway. The Board, further,,have no reason to suppose the.t the general Italian interests at Bmyrna to which reference is made in the first memorandum communicated by the Italian Ambassador,were comparable to the Greek interests.there. Apart from these considerations it would, in the opinion of tho Board, be most unfortunate if such Turkish dominions as may remain in Asia minor alter the war were practically deprived of any free access to tho soa, and if the only important port on the Aegean should fall to Italy. The Board are in full agreement on this point with the observations of k. heratoff as reported in the communication from the Russian Ambassador transmitted in your letter Bo. W, 240682 of the 2nd December. It is in their opinion essential that the port of Smyrna (which in other circumstances might have become Greek) should cither remainremain Turkish or he under a regime which would oecure its fullest and freest utilisation by all loreign countries trading with Asiatic Turkey; and uhey have grave doubts as to whether any secure arrangements with this latter object could be rar.de with the Italian Govoriiient 6 I am to add that the hoard assume that in any territorial arrangement which may ultimately be made with Italy in respect of Asiatic Turkey, His testy's Govern lent and the Prcnch Government wll] stipulate that the provisions of paragraphs 8 and f of the iinglo-Prench anrangement of the 9th/16th May 191o, snail extend ; .uti:.tis ..ntandis to any Turkish t or r it or ie g whi ch It aly lyiv a cqu ire.

JJDecember, 1916 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.W.220218 of 15th November, forwarding two memoranda from the Italian Govt., regarding the arrangements concluded between Great Britain, France and r Russia, relative to Asiatic Turkey. Those portions of the memoranda that deal with Asia Minor lie beyond the- eefftpoton-eo e-f this—Off Iceland Mr. Chamberlain-will eon-fine bimeeif to saying, that--lie rigi eeB that ah Qttoman-Turkieh ■kingdum ^li'uuld surviw-in some form, but''tliairegress to the open aear-4ees not~^seenrto^tre essent-lfel% Moreover a'Turkish’ navy', howa^ftr small-, would bo likely tu only an inconvenience In the'future. As regards the Arab State and the Arabian peninsula, Mr* Chamberlain is not aware of any reason of principle why Italy should be placed on a more favourable footing than Russia, which, equally with Vf - with Italy, has a considerable Moslem population, but has made no such claims as those put forward * t in the second Italian memorandum. Again, so far as Mr. Chamberlain is aware, the French Government have not claimed to participa.te in the negotiations with the Grand Shereef regarding the creation of an Arab State, nor has the somewhat inconclusive result of those negotiations been communicated to them. It seems clear that the Grand Shereef would resent the introduction of the Italians into the negotiations, and that without his assent such a course would be impossible. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that whereas there exists a definite agreement between Great Britain and France and an indefinite agreement between Great Britain and the Shereef, there exists no agreement at all between the Shereef and France; while, so far is it from being possible to regard him as having accepted the French claims embodied in the Anglo-French agreement, that in his letter of-1st January last hehe expressly stated that after the war 'we shall ask you for what we now leave to France in Beyrout and c &lt; its coasts'. It is obvious therefore that the introduction of Italy a.t the present stage could only have the result of entirely subverting the basis of the previous negotiations, and Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion, on grounds alike of principle and of expediency, that it should be resisted. * Four points remain. (1). It would appear reasonable that Italian interests in Palestine should be recognised as on an equality with those of other Xtian Powers, including the Vatican. (2). Italian reservations touching the ports of Acre and Haifa and the customs r^rdme in the British and French spheres might be allowed. (3). As regards the right to participate equally in all privileges in the Arab State outside the British and French spheres, it might be pointed out that it is essential to keep the Hejaz absolutely free from intrusion of all Xtian Powers; that the State or Confederation as a whole will ex hypothesi be independent; but that His Majesty f s Government cannot be expected to divest themselves of any advantagesadvantages or responsibilities flowing from their da., f&amp;fckQ. relations with local chiefs or tribes, while, in view of their long established position at Aden, they consider themselves to have a special interest in the Yemen, and regard the Hadramaut as entirely under their influence.^The islands in the Red Sea previously under Turkish sovereignty pass naturally to the Arab State, but some special regime may be necessary in Xamaran Island in view of the pilgrim traffic. A memorandum on British and Italian interests in the Arabian peninsula is enclosed. It was written with reference to a rather different proposal, but the considerations on which it is based are equally applicable to that which is now put forward by the Italian Government. A copy of a letter from the Government . &gt; ( of India is also enclosed, sM attention is invited to sections 6 and 8 (7). 'h/* \ V, EXTRACT FROM MEMORANDUM BY ARAB BUREAU, CAIRO, ENCLOSED IN DESPATCH FROL! SIR H.MC.MAHON, NO.83, DATED 19TH APRIL 1916, POLITICAL, 1729A6, It may be as well to set out what each high contracting party has not agreed to:- The Sharif, for his part, has not agreed to:- 1. The exclusion of Alexandretta (which is in the Vilayet of Aleppo) or any part of Syria from the area of Arab independence. 2. Permanent alienation of any part of Irak or even the temporary concession to us of any province, except that of Basra (^districts now (Nov.5) occupied by British troops”). 3. Ottoman or other foreign suzerainty over any part of the area. (4. The sole British right to furnish advisers or officials for administrative purposes. A.H.) We, for our part, have not agreed to:- 1. Do more than amorove an Arab Caliphate, if set up by the Arabs themselves. 2. Recognise Arab independence in Syria, west of the line Aleppo-Hama-Homs-Damascus or in any other portion of the Arab area in which we are not free to act without detriment to the interests of our Ally, France, 3. Recognise any single political chief of the independent Arab area, or the subjection of any Arab chief to any other. 4. Set any term to our occupation of Irak; define the conditions on which we are to hold any part of it; or ill I limitlimit our occupation to the Vilayet of Basra alone. 5. Annul the extra-territorial priviliges of foreigners. What has been agreed to, therefore, on behalf of Great Britain, is:- 1. To recognise the independence of those portions of the Arab speaking area in which we are free to act without detriment to the interests of France. Subject to these undefined reservations, the said area is understood to be bounded N. by about Lat.37°, east by the Persian frontier, south by the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, west by the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean up to about Lat.33° and beyond by an indefinite line drawn inland west of Damascus Horns, Hama and Aleppo; all that lies between this last line and the Mediterranean being in any case, reserved absolutely for future arrangement with the French and the Arabs. Within the above independent area we have also excepted:- 1. Aden and district, as our Imperial possession. 2. Irak (Vilayets of Basra and Baghdad) as to be in part leased to and administered by us, and in other part, subject to our control in some degree and manner: We to hold any part of Irak, not by imperial right, but under concession from the Arabs. 2. To assist the Arabs:- (a) To obtain their independence in that area. (b) To set up and maintain such forms of autonomous government in the several districts of the area as may be suitable to each. 3. To approve of an Arab Caliphate vice the Ottoman Caliphate should the Arabs succeed in establishing one satisfactorily 4. To give advice to, and find personnel to assist in, the administrationadministration of Arab districts should their constituted governments, when formed, so desire; but not otherwise to interfere in the internal affairs of the area, provided that our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs are not violated by the autonomous governments. * ■* * * * *L 4.—Communication from Mr. Olieetham to Shcrif Abdalla. After compliments and thanks. We have understood your reasons and acknowledge the justice of your recpiest. So wo have sent to hold Kitchener (titles) who has replied as follows — Salaams to Sherif Abdalla (titles). That which we foresaw has come to pass. Germany has bought the Turkish Government with gold notwith standing that Great Britain, France and Bussia guaranteed the integrity of the Ottoman Fmpire if Turkey remained neutral in this vai. I lie luikish Government have against the wish of the Sultan and through German pressure committed acts of war by invading without provocation the frontiers of Egypt with armed bands followed by Turkish soldiers which are now massed at Akaba to invade Egypt, so that the cause of the Arabs, which is the cause of freedom, has become the cause also of Great Britain. If the Amir (titles) and Arabs in general assist Great Britain in this conflict that has been forced upon us by Turkey, Great Britain will promise not to intervene in any manner whatsoever whether in things religious or otherwise. Moreover, recognising and respecting the sacred and unique oJlice of the Amir Ilosavn (titles) Great Britain will guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sherifate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till now we have defended and befriended Islam in the person of the Turks: henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arab. It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina, and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil which is now occurring. It would be well if Your Highness could convey to your followers and devotees, who are found throughout the world, in every country, the good tidings of the Freedom of the Arabs, and the rising of the sun over Arabia. 5.—Communication, unsigned and undated, handwriting of Sherif Abdalla. Respectable and powerful Friend, After paying due respects, yours of the 12th Zil lloga has been received with due honour and reverence, and we have taken it as a basis for action and a reference for the present and the future. In accordance with it, and in view of its fidelity and accord, our country has come to hold most conscientiously to your suggestions, and has undertaken to cany out faithfully what we said in our previous letter and what we confirm in the present one ; and has avoided since our foregoing letter all that affects unfavourably your material and moral interests. Yea more, we are endeavouring to discourage any man who seeks to harm these interests— any one of those who are outside the pale of the Hedjaz colony. 1 If you could perceive our critical position in undertaking the matter you would know that we are doing that which is more important than the performance of that which is naturally imposed upon us, regardless of whether or not these negotiations take place and whether or not an agree ment is arrived at. It is so because religion which justifies it and which is the scle foundation of action, prevents us from working at once. But when the time shall come, and it is not far distant, we can not but accomplish it, even though the Ottoman Empire be not occupied and even though it should muster against us all its army. In closing, 1 would remind you that we act upon the words of him who said, “ Perform ye the promise ye make to God when ye pledge yourselves. ’ \Ye then pay to His Highness and yourself our best regards, requesting you to keep this correspondence secret until the right time should come.().—Shorthand Note taken by Messenger of a discourse by the Sherif of Mecca, which took place in privacy at night on the roof of his palace. Ali Bey, please impart my best salaams, faithfulness and friendship to Mr. Storrs, and my acceptance of what his great Empire has on another occasion proposed. Ali, do your best to make Mr. Storrs understand that he should not consider my answer as a breaking up of relations. It simply came late,&gt;and if she had granted our demand when we made it, things would have been better. The day will come when we will demand more of her than she is now preparing for us, and perhaps soon. Ali, inform Mr. Storrs that 1 am using all my political and material influence in spreading the British policy (influence) in my country as well in that of A1 Imam Yehia, as he is my friend and never acts against my advice. Ali, Turkey is weighing down heavily upon us, beyond the power of our endurance. We therefore oppose the execution of its commands and plans. Yhsterday they were planning to send printed circulars or posters to the chiefs of the tribes for distribution among the pilgrims. We oppose the project with all our might and diplomacy ; we have opposed it almost to the point of breaking up our relation (with them) ; and if the Vali had not returned upon his decision, relations would have been definitely broken up. And perhaps causes might spring up which would break these relations even before you arrive at your country ; and it might come to pass that the thing would be delayed some three or four or six months. Through my political influence, rebellion and disobedience had well nigh broken out among the Syrian corps. England will hear about my action, if not now, in the future. Our relations with the Empire are waning, dying, even as a flickering lamp whose oil had run out. Ali, the only thing that prevents me from rising against the Turkish Empire is the Moslem world, which now looks upon me and feels annoyed with me, especially under the present circumstances. Another reason is this, I cannot forget the favours the reigning house bestowed upon me. But the reins of power have passed from the hands of this family. Among the reasons which strengthen the hands of the Turkish statesmen and give weight to their influence and power is the interception of food materifds from our land. This thing has caused great want there. More, they (Turks) have informed the people and the Bedouins that it was Britain which intercepted the alms and thus reduced them to their pitiable state. Ali Bey, we wrestle valiantly, spend much of our substance, and use all our influence to calm down the country. Great Britain will learn of our efforts later on. Now we cannot make demands; we simply pray her to facilitate the question of grains (the coming in of grains). Be it as it may we shall not turn against her or aid her enemies. She shall see. I am bound by three ties; the Caliphate, and, as I have already intimated, the favours which the reigning house bestowed upon me. As to the religious tie, you see them now declare openly that the cause of the degeneration of the Moslem nations is religion, and they set themselves to efface it. Y ea, some have come to us to pay a visit to the Holy Places (on pilgrimage) ; and these have mocked and scoffed at the thing, and have not performed their religious duties as it behoves them to do. From this you will perceive that religious matters have become lax. Therefoie we are no longer bound to obey them. The second tie concerns our obedience to tbe Caliphate, but there no longer exists a Caliphate, and that for various reasons, among others that their rule projects plans and deeds that are all contrary to religion. The Caliphate means this, that the rules of the book of God should be enforced, and this they do not do. As to the third, I have already intimated that the Turkish Government has come to be nothing more than Enver and his clique. We therefore are no longer bound to them by any tie.\ 4 Notwithstanding this I am of opinion that it will be better now to put off action. This is due to the reasons explained here above, and to the fact that it will be in our interests that this delay be. Say, Ali, are you satisfied ? Yes, sir. 7 .—Communication from Sherif of Mecca to Mr. Storrs, Oriental Secretary to British Representative, Cairo. To the dear honourable, may God protect him, 1 present to your dear honour my affectionate regards and respects, and hope that you will do your best to make the enclosed note, containing the proposed conditions, effective, as you are capable of doing. And in this connection 1 declare to you and your Government that you need not be anxious about the ideas of the people here, because they are closely bound to your Government by community of interests. Do not be at pains to send aeroplanes or men-of-war to throw reports and rumours, as was done before, because the matter is now decided. What we desire to beg you is to open the way for the Egyptian Govern ment to send the charitable offerings of corn for the Holy lands, i.c., Mecca and Medina, which were stopped since last year. For verily, the sending of this grain for this year and last would be an important factor in laying the foundations of our mutual advantage. This should suffice for a person of your grasp. In conclusion I offer you my best salaams and respects. ^nd Ramadan 1333 (14th July 1015). Kindly do not trouble to send any correspondence until you see the result of our operations; except the reply to the note and its enclosure, which should be through the bearer only ; and, if you should think fit, give him a written token to make it easy for him to reach you when we find it necessary. He is all right. Unsigned. 8 .—Enclosed with foregoing. To his Honour, W hereas the whole ol the Arab nation without any exception have decided in these last years to live, and to accomplish their freedom and grasp the reins of their Administration both in theory and practice ; and whereas they have found and felt that it is to the interest of the Government of Great Britain to support them and aid them to the attainment of their firm and lawful intentions (which are based upon the maintenance of the honour and dignity of their life) without any ulterior motives whatsoever unconnected with this object; And whereas it is to their (Arabs’) interest also to prefer the assistance of the Government of Great Britain in consideration of their geographical position and economic interests, and also of the attitude of the above- mentioned Government, which is known to both nations and therefore need not be emphasized ; lor these reasons the Arab nation sees fit to limit themselves, as time is short, to asking the Government of Great Britain, if it should think fit, for the approval, through her deputy or representative, of the following fundamental propositions, leaving out all things considered secondary in comparison with these, so that it may prepare all means necessary for attaining this noble purpose, until such time as it finds occasion for making the actual negotiations :— h irslhj. — England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina-Adana up to the 37° of latitude, on which degree fails Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island, up to the border of Persia ; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf ol Basra ; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of theposition of Aden to remain as it is ; on the west by the Red Sea, the ^Ie&lt;Iiterranean Sea op to Mersina. Rngiand to approve of the proclaination of an Arab Caliphate of Islam. Secondly .—The Arab Government of the Sherif to acknowledge that Imgland sliall have the prelerence in all economic enterprises in the Arab countries whenever conditions of enterprises are otherwise equal. Thirdly. -For the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to oiler mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties. h ourthiy. If one of the parties enters upon an aggressive conflict, the other party to assume a neutral attitude, and m case of such partv wishing the other to join forces, both to meet and discuss the conditions. Fifthly .— England to acknowledge the abolition of foreign privileges in the Arab countries, quid to assist the Government of the Sherif in an international Convention for confirming such abolition. Sixthly. Articles o and 4 of this Treaty to remain in vigour for 15 years, and, if either wishes it to be renewed, one year’s notice before lapse of treaty to be given. Consequently, and as the whole of the Arab nation have (praise be to God) agreed and united for the attainment, at all costs and finally, of this noble object, they beg the Government of Great Britain to answer them positively or negatively in a period of 30 days alter receiving this intimation ; and il this period should lapse before they receive an answer, they reserve to themselves complete freedom of action. Moreover we.(Sherifs family) will consider ourselves free in word and deed from the bonds of our previous declaration which we made through Alt Undated and unsigned. 0.—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif llosayn (titles). After compliments and salutations. We have the honour to thank you for your frank expressions of the sincerity of your feeling towards England. \\ e rejoice moreover that 1 our I Ugliness and your people are of one opinion, that Arab interests are English interests and English Arab. To this intent we con firm to you the terms of Lord Kitchener’s message, which reached you by the hand of Ali Elfendi, and in which was stated clearly our desire for the independence of Arabia and its inhabitants, together with our approval of the Arab Caliphate when it should be proclaimed. We declare once more that llis Majesty’s Government would welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race. With regard to the questions of limits, frontiers and boundaries, it would appear to be premature to consume our time in discussing such details in the heat of war, and while, in many portions of them, the Turk is up to now in effective occupation; especially as we have learnt, with surprise and regret, that some of the Arabs in those very parts, far from assisting us, are neglecting this their supreme oppor tunity, and are lending their arms to the German and the Turk, to the new despoiler and the old oppressor. Nevertheless we are ready to send to Your Highness for the Holy Cities and the noble Arabs the charitable offerings of Egypt, so soon as Your Highness shall inform us how and where they should be delivered. We are moreover arranging for this your messenger to be admitted and helped on any journey he may make to ourselves. Friendly reassurances. Salutations. (Signed) Sir A. H. McMahon. (Apparently dated 30th August 1015.) * * Our last messenger, vide correspondence.10 -Communication from the Gran.l Slierif of Mecca to His Excellency the Most Kxalteel, the Most Ihninent, the British High Commissioner m Egypt; may ttod grant him success. With great cheerfulness and delight I received your letter dated 19th Shawal 1333 (30th August 191:)), and have given it great consideration and regard in spite of the impression 1 received from it of ambiguity and its tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our essential point. It L necessary to make clear to Your Excellency onr suicer. y owards the illustrious British Empire and our confession of prefeietice fot t ■ ' and matters and under all forms and cmmmstances. 1 lie real interests of the followers of our religion necessitate this Nevertheless, Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to sa&gt; clearlv that the coldness and hesitation which you have displayed m the I nest ion of the limits and boundaries by saying that the discussion of these it'present is of no use and is a loss of time and that they are still m the hands of the Government which is ruling them, Ac., might be taken to inffci an estrangement or something of the sort. * As these limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one per on whom we should satisfy and with wliom we should discuss them .dtei ttw war'is orer, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this Therefore they have found it necessary first to discuss this point with the dower in whom they now have their confidence and trust as a Jmal appeal, viz., the Illustrious British Empire. (Literal translation of the above passage): “ And therefore they saw the discussion in it first the place of their confidence and trust the axis of final appeal now and that is le Illustrious British Empire.’ Their reason for this union and confidence is mutual interest the necessity of regulating territorial divisions and the feelings of then inhabitants, so that they may know how to base their future and Ide, so not to meet her (England ?) or any of her Allies m opposition to their resolution which would produce a contrary issue, which God forbid. (Literal translation of above passage as follows) : “ The feelings of its inhabitants to know how to base their future and life for not to meet her or one of its Allies in front of their resolution when the thing comes to a contrary result, which God loibid. For the object is, honourable Minister, the truth which is established on a basis which guarantees the essential sources of life in future. Yet within these limits they have not included places inhabited by a foreign race. It is no vain show of words and titles. May God have mercy on the Caliphate and comfort Moslems in it. I am confident that Your Excellency will not doubt that it is not personally who am demanding of these limits which include only our race, hut that they are all proposals of the people who, in short, believe that the} are necessary for economic life. . Is this not right, Your Excellency the Minister . In a word, Your High Excellency, we are firm m our sincerity and declaring our preference for loyalty towards you, whether you are satisfied with us, as has been said, or angry. . With reference to vonr remark in your letter above-mentioned that some of our people are still doing their utmost in promoting the interests ol Turkey -Your Goodness (lit. “ Perfectness”) would not permit you to make this an excuse for the tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our demands, demands which f cannot admit that you. as a man of sound opinion will deny to be necessary for our existence; nay, they are the essential essence of our life, material and moral. . Up to the present moment, I am myself with all my might canving 01 in my country all things in conformity with the Islamic Law, all things wine itend to benefit the rest of the kingdom, and I shall continue to do so until it pleases Clod to order otherwise. In order to reassure Your Excellency, I can declare that the whole country, together with those who you say are submitting themselves to Tureo-German orders, are all waiting the result of these negotiations, which are dependent only on your refusal or acceptance of the question of the limits and in your declaration of safeguarding their religion lirst and then the rest of rights from any harm or danger. Whatever the illustrious Government of Great Britain Jinds comformable to its policy in this subject, communicate it to us and specify to us the course we should follow. In all cases it is only God’s will which shall be executed and it is God who is the real factor in everything. With regard to our demand for grain for the natives and the monies (surras) known to the Wakfs Ministry and all other articles sent here with pilgrims’ caravan, 0 High Excellency, my intention in this matter is to contirm your proclamations to the whole world, and especially to the Moslem world, that your antagonism is confined only to the party which has usurped the rights of Caliphate in which are included the rights of all Moslems. Moreover, the said grain is from the special \\ akfs, and has nothing to do with politics. If you think it should be, let the grain of the two years be transported in a special steamer to deddah in an otlicial manner, m the name of all the natives as usual, and the captain of the steamer or the special Mamur detailed as usual every year to hand it over on his arrival at the port will send to the Governor of deddah asking for the Mamur of the grain at Jeddah or a responsible official to take over the grain and give the necessary receipt signed by the said Mamur, that is the Mamur of the giain himself. He should make it a condition that he would (? not) accept any receipt but that signed by this Mamur. Let the captain of the steamer or the Mamur (detailed with the giain) be instructed that if he hnds anything contrary to this arrangement he should warn them that he will return home with the cargo. Thereupon the Mamur and the special committee detailed with, him, which is known as the committee of the grain for the natives, will take over the giain in the proper form. Please accept my best regards and salutations. If you choose to send a reply to this please send it with bearer. 29th Shawal 1333. 9th September 1915. 11 .—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca (with titles). I have received your letter of 19th (? 29th) Shawal with much pleasure and your expressions of friendliness and sincerity have given me the greatest satisfaction. ... 1 regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the limits and boundaries with coldness and hesitation ; such was not the case, but it appeared to me that the moment had not yet arrived when they could be most profitably discussed. I have realized, however, from your last letter that you regard this question as one of vital and urgent importance. I have, therefore, lost no lime in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of 30111 letter and it is with great pleasure that 1 communicate to you on their behalf the following statement, which 1 am confident you will receive with satisfaction. . . The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of byna lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Homs and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. . . With the above modification, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits and boundaries and, in8 rcmnl to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her Ally, r ranee, 1 am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter Suldect to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca. Great Britain will guarantee the 1 foly Places against all external aggression and will recognize their inviolability. ...... 1 , When the situation admits, Gri'at Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of Government in those various territories. On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great llritain only, and that such Luropean Advisers and Officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British. . , , ... With regard to the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognize that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control m order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests. 1 am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her traditional friends the Arabs and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke which for so many years has pressed heavily upon them. 1 have confined myself in this letter to the more vital and important questions, and if there are any other matters dealt ^ ith m aoui letters which I have omitted to mention, we may discuss them at some convenient date in the future. . i * r t It was with very great relief and satisfaction that I heard of the sale arrival of the Holy Carpet and the accompanying offerings which, thanks to the clearness of your directions and the excellence of your arrangements, were landed without trouble or mishap in spite of the dangers and difficulties occasioned by the present sad war- May God soon bring a lasting peace and freedom to all peoples. I am sending this Tetter by the hand of your trusted and excellent messenger. Sheikh Mohammed Jbn Aril Araylan, and he will inform you of various matters of interest but of less vital importance, which 1 have not mentioned in this letter. (Here follow the usual compliments.) 24th October 1915. 12 .—Communication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to the High Commissioner, Cairo. (Literal translation.) In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. To His Excel lency the most exalted and eminent Minister who is endowed with the highest authoritv and soundness of opinion. Mav God guide him to do His WiH. 1 received with great pleasure your honoured letter dated 15th Zul Ilijj (24th October 1915), to which 1 beg to answer as follows : (I.) In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships— seeing, moreover, that we have great consideration for the distinguished qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain—we renounce our insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the provinces of Aleppo and Beyrout and their sea-coasts are purely Arab Provinces and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab ; they are both descendants of one forefather. We Moslems will follow the footsteps of the Commander of the Faithful— Omai ibn Khattab and other ( aliphs succeeding him, who ordained in the laws of the Moslem faith that Moslems should treat the Christians as they t 1 eat themsehes. lie, Omar, declared with reference to Christians, “they will ha\e the same privileges and submit to the same duties as ourselves.” they will thus enjoy their civic rights in as much as'it accords with the general interest of the whole nation. As the 1 ievinces of Irak are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom and were in fact the seat of its Governments in the time of Ali Ibn Abu Talib, and m t he tune of all Caliphs who succeeded him j and as in them began the civilization of the Aialls, and as their towns in those provinces were the first towns built in Islam where the Arab power became so great; therefore these provinces are greatly valued by all Arabs far and 'near,’and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently, we cannot satisfy the Arab nations or make them submit to give up such a title to nobility, but in order to render an accord easy, and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter, to keep and guard oui mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, for all these reasons we might agree to leave under the British Administration for a short time those districts now occupied by the British troops, without the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab nation, which interests are to it economic and vital) and against a suitable sum paid as compensation to the Arab kingdom for the period of occupation, m order to meet the expenses which every new kingdom is bound to support, at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especially those which are essential. (3.) In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages but grounds of apprehension. The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party (as has already happened in the past) who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its forces. The second is that standing in the face of Turkey, which is supported by all the forces of Germany, we do not know what Great Britain and her Allies would do if one of the Fntente Powers were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation will then be left alone in the face of Turkey together with her Allies, but we would not at all mind if we were to face the Turks alone. therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration. (4.) The Arab nation has a strong belief that after this war is over, the Turks under German influence will direct their efforts to provoke the Arabs and violate their rights, both material and moral, to wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission as they are determined to ruin them entirely. The reasons for the slowness shown in our action have already been stated. (5.) When the Arabs know that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support and will effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will, no doubt, be in conformitv with the general interest of the Arabs. (0.) Our letter dated 29th Shawal 1333 (9th September 1915) saves us the trouble of repeating our opinions as to Articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration, Government advisers and officials especially as you have declared, 0, Fxalted Minister! that you will not interfere with internal affairs. (7.) The arrival of a clear and definite answer as soon as possible, to the above proposals, is expected. We have'done our utmost in makino- con cessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both parties. We knowt 10 that our lot 111 this war will be either a success which \\ill guaiaiiicc to the Arabs a life becoming their past history, or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Bad it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects I would have prelerred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain , but the_\. the Aiabs, have insisted that 1 should guide the movement to this end. May God keep you safe and victorious, as wm devoutly hope and desire. (I Msigned) Dated 27 el Hijj 1333. (5th November 19It).) 13.—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca. The Residency, Cairo. After customary greetings and acknowledgment of previous letter. 1 am gratified to observe that you agree to the exclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana from the boundaries of the Arab territories. 1 also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the Arabs are determined to act in conformity with the precepts laid down by Omar Ibn Khattab and the early Caliphs, which secure the rights and privileges of all religions alike. In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab Chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab Kingdom, as the Government of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist. With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beyrout, the Government of Great Britain have taken careful note of your observations, but, as the interests of our Ally France are involved, the question wdll require careful consideration and a further communication on the subject will be addressed to you in due course. The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, are ready to give all guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognized, a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Baghdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed consideration than the present situation and the urgency of these negotiations permits. We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and w r e have no wish to urge you to hasty action, which might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects, but in the meantime it is most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies. It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures wdiich the Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, wdien the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend. Under these circumstances I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace, in terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition. As an earnest of our intentions and in order to aid you in your effors in our joint cause 1 am sending bv vour trustworthy messenger a sum of 20 , 000 /. 17th December 1915. (Customary ending.)

Cairo. ligh u've your In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, to His Excellency tiie eminent, energetic and magnanimous Minister. We received from the bearer your two letters dated 9th Safar (17th December 1915) with great respect and honour, and I have understood their contents, which caused me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction as they removed that which had made me uneasy. Your honour will have realised after the arrival of Mohammed [Faroki] Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present, was of no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly unintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us. These truths are, in my opinion, very important, and des honour’s special attention and consideration. With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning El Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice. As regards the Northern Parts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications, and all this was only done so to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and the agreement made between them during the present wars and calamities; yet we find it our duty that the Eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Bey rout and its coasts. I do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britain, than it is to us; and will necessarily be so whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now ; especially as her allies being neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with which there will be no peace of mind. In addition to which the people of Beyrout will decidedly never accept such isolations and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity of our interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate with any other Power but you. Consequently, it is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France, or any other Power, a span of land in those regions. 1 declare this and I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from, the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter. Therefore, the honourable and eminent Minister should believe and be sure, together with Great Britain, that we still remain firm to our resolution which Storrs learnt from us two years ago, for which we await the opportunity suitable to our situation, especially in view of that action the time of which has now come near and which destiny drives towards us with great haste and clearness, so that we and those who are of our opinion, may have reasons for such action against any criticisms or responsibilities imposed upon us in future. Your expression “we do not want to push you to any hasty action which might jeopardise the success of your aim” does not need any more12 explanation except what we may ask for, when necessary, such as arms, ammunition, &amp;c. I &lt;!eein this sufficient as I have occupied much of yonr honour’s time. I bes to offer vou mv great veneration and respect.

We have received with great pleasure and satisfaction your letter of the 25th Safar (1st January) at the hands of your trusty messenger, who has also transmitted to us your verbal messages. We fully realize and entirely appreciate the motives which guide you in this important question and we know well that you are acting entirely in the interests of the Arab peoples and with no thought beyond their welfare. W r e take note of your remarks concerning the vilayet of Baghdad and will take the question into careful consideration when the enemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlements arrives. As regards the Northern parts we note with satisfaction your desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France. It is, as you know, our fixed determination that nothing shall be permitted to interfere in the slightest degree with our united prosecution of this war to a victorious conclusion. Moreover, when the victory has been won, the friendship of Great Britain and Prance will become yet more firm and enduring, cemented by the blood of Englishmen ands. rso 2 . D 13 Frenchmen who have died side by side fighting for the Cause of Right and Liberty. In this great cause Arabia is now associated and God grant that the result of our mutual efforts and co-operation will bind us in a lasting friendship to the mutual welfare and happiness of us all! We are greatly pleased to hear of the action you are taking to win all the Arabs over to our joint cause and to dissuade them from giving any assistance to our enemies, and we leave it to your discretion to seize the most favourable moment for further and more decided measures. You will doubtless inform us by the bearer of this letter of any manner in which we can assist you and your requests will always receive our innnediate consideration. You will have heard how El Sayed Ahmed el Sherif el Senussi has been beguiled by evil advice into hostile action, and it will be a great grief to you to know that he has been so far forgetful of the interests of the Arabs as to throw in his lot with our enemies. Misfortune has now overtaken him and we trust that this will show him his error and lead him to peace for the sake of his poor misguided followers. We are sending this letter by the hand of your good messenger, who will also bring to you all our news. With salaams. A. H.

We have received a detailed report from him stating that the tyrannies of the Government there have not left of the persons upon whom they could depend, whether of the different ranks of soldiers or of others, save only a few, and those of secondary importance; and that he is awaiting the arrival of the forces announced from different places, cspeciall}’ from the people of the country and the surrounding Arab regions as Aleppo and the south of Mosul, whose total number is calculated at not less than 100,000 by their estimate; and he intends, if the majority of the forces mentioned are Arab, to begin the movement by them : and, if otherwise, that is, of the 1 urks or others, he will observe their advance to the canal, and when they begin to fight, his movements upon them will be different to what they expect. Secondly .—We purposed sending our eldest son to Medina with sufficient forces to strengthen his brother (who is) in Syria, and with every possibility of occupying the railway line, or carrying out such operations as cucum- stances may admit. This is the beginning of the principal movement, and we are satisfied m its beginning with what we had levied as guaids to keep the interior of the country quiet; they are of the people of Hijaz only, for many reasons, which it would take too long to sec ioith, chiefly the difficulties in the way of providing their necessities with secrecy and speed (although this precaution was not necessary) and to make it easy to bring reinforcements when needed; this is the. summary of what you wished to understand, m my opinion it is sufficient, and it is to be taken as a foundation and a standard as to our actions in the face of all changes and unforeseen events which the sequence of events may show. It remains for us to state what we need at present.u f Firstly .—The amount of 50,000 pounds in gold for the monthly pay of the troops levied, and other things the necessity of which needs' no explanation. We beg you to send it with alJ possible haste. Secondly. —20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 5,000 sacks of barley, 150 sacks of coffee, 150 sacks of sugar, 5,000 rifles of the modern pattern and the necessary ammunition, and 100 boxes of the two sample cartridges (enclosed) and of Martini Henry cartridges and “ Aza,” that is of those of the rifles of the factory of St. Etienne in France for the use of those two kinds of rifles of our tribes, it would not be amiss to send 500 boxes of both kinds. Thirdly.-—We think it better that the place of deposit of all these things should be Port Sudan. Fourthly .—As the above provisions and munitions are not needed until the beginning of the movement (of which we will inform you officially), they should remain at the above place, and when we need them we will inform the Governor there of the places to which they may be conveyed and of the in termediaries who will carry orders for receiving them. Fifthly .—The money required should be sent at once to the Governor of Port Sudan, and a confidential agent will be sent by us to receive it either all at once or in two instalments, according as he is able, and this t) is the (secret) sign to be recognised for accepting the man. Sixthly .—Our envoy who will receive the money shall be sent to Port Sudan in three weeks time, that is to say, he will be there on the Fifth of i Qtp March. dam ad Awal 1 , with a letter from us addressed to A1 Khawaga Elias Effendi saying that he (Elias) will pay him, in accordance with the letter, the rent of our properties, and the signature will be clear in our name, but we will instruct him to ask for the Governor of the place, whom you will apprise of this person’s arrival. After perusal of letter, the money should be given to him on condition that no discussion whatever is to be made with him of any question concerning us. We beg you most emphatically not to tell him anything, keeping this affair secret, and he should be treated apparently as if he were nothing out of the way. Let it not be thought that our appointment of another man results from lack of confidence in bearer; it is only to avoid waste of time, for we are appointing him to a task elsewhere. At the same time we beg you not embark or send him in a steamer, or officially, the means already^arranged being sufficient. Seventhly.—Our representative, bearer of the present letter, has been definitely instructed^ to ensure the arrival of this, and 1 think that his mission this time is finished since the condition of things is known both in general and in detail, and there is no need for sending anyone else. In case of need for sending information, it will come from us ; yet, as our next representative will reach you after three weeks, you may’prepare instruc tions for him to take back. Yet let him be treated simply in appearance. Fighthly .—Let the British Government consider this military expen diture in accordance with the books which will be furnished it exolainino- how the money has been spent. ’ ^ To conclude, my best and numberless salutations beyond all increase. 14 Rabi al Akhar.

(After customary greetings.) We have received ynur letter of the 14th Rabi al Akhar (18th February), duly delivered by 3 7 our trusted messenger. We are grateful to note the active measures which you propose to take We consider them the most suitable in the existing circumstances, and they have the approval of His Majesty’s Government. I am pleased to be able to mfoim you that Ills Majestv s Goveimncnt have approved of meeting vour requests, and that which you asked to be sent with all haste is 'Veino- despatched with your messenger, who is also the bearer of this letter. ' This alludes to a verbal message sent to him on the occasion of the last visit of his messenger, informing him that his personal property in Egypt was being well looked after.16 The remainder will be collected as quickly as possible, and w ill be deposited at Port Sudan, where it will remain until we hear from you officially of the beginning of the movement and of the places to which they may be conveyed, and the intermediaries who will cany out the oideis for receiving them. . . The necessary instructions, as set forth in your letter, have been issued to the Governor at Port Sudan, and he will arrange everything in accordance with your wishes. Your representative who brought your last letter has been duly facilitated in his journey to Jeizan, and every assistance has been gixen him m his mission, which we trust will be crowned with good results. W e have arranged that, on completion, he will be brought to Port Sudan, whence he will proceed by safest means to join you, and report the results of his work. We take the opportunity, in sending this letter, to explain to you a matter which otherwise might not have been clear to you, and which might have given rise to misunderstanding. There are various Turkish posts and small garrisons along the coasts of Arabia who are hostile to us, and who are said to be planning injury to cur naval interests in the lied Sea. W e may, therefore, lind it necessary to take hostile measures against these posts and garrisons, but we have issued strict instructions that every caie must be taken by our ships to differentiate between the hostile Turkish garrisons and the innocent Arab inhabitants, towards whom we entertain such friendly feelings. We give y r ou notice of this matter in case distorted and false reports may reach you of the reasons for any action which we may be obliged to take. We have heard rumours that our mutual enemies are endeavouring to construct boats for the purpose of laying mines in the Ped Sea, and of other wise injuring our interests there, and we beg of you that you will give us early information should ymu receive any 7 confirmation of such reports. We have heard that Ibn Rashid lias been selling large quantities of camels to the 'Turks, which are being sent up to Damascus. We hope that you will be able to use your influence with him in order that he may cease this practice, and, if he still persists, that you will be able to arrange for the Arabs who lie between him and Syria to seize the camels as they pass—a procedure which will be to our mutual advantage. I am glad to be able to inform you that those misguided Arabs under Sayed Ahmed el Senussi, who have fallen victims to the wiles of Turkish and German intriguers, are now beginning to seethe error of their ways and are coming in to us in large numbers, asking for forgiveness and friendship. We have severely defeated the forces which these intriguers had collected against us, and the eyes of the Arabs are now becoming open to the deceit which has been practised upon them. The capture of Erzerum and the defeats sustained by the Turks in the Caucasus are having a great effect in our favour, and are greatly helping the cause for which w*e are both working. We ask God to prosper your endeavours and to further the work which you have taken in hand. you to accept our warmest salutations and (Signed) McMahon . f1916. SIMLA.

FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. SECRET. War, Tq The Right Honourable AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, His Majesty 9 s Secretary of State for India* Simla, the 29th September 1916* Sis, In cmr Foreign Department secret telegram of the 7th September 1916 we had the honour to submit a summary of our views on the points raised in vour telegram of the 21st August 1916 in connection with the post bellum disposal of captured territories. It was, however, obviously impossible for us within the compass of a telegram to state fully our provisional views on these important questions. IVe shall accordingly in this despatch endeavour to state in extenso our opinions— (1) Regarding the surrender or retention of such captured territories as affect Indian interests. (2) Regarding obsolete Treaty rights and territorial readjustments vis-a-vis our Allies. (3) Regarding the proposed readjustment of the boundary of the Aden Protectorate and our future policy generally in that neighbourhood. 2. As regards the first point, viz., the question of the retention or surrender of captured territories or territories likely to be captured, the only territories of this kind that affect Indian interests are, we think, Iraq and German East Africa. lJ In regard to the former, we understand from the memorandum prepared , Tnn . by the jcoreign Office in May* 1916 1916 , from the secretary, Political Departmeut, India that an agreement has been concluded office. between Great Britain, France and Russia respecting Asiatic Turkey whereby a definite area, comprising the Basrah and Baghdad Vilayats, has been assigned to Great Britain wherein Great Britain shall be allowed to establish such direct or indirect administra tion or control as it desires and as it may think fit to arrange with the Arab State or confederation of Arab States”. We conclude, therefore, that this area is to be retained by Great Britain under either direct or indirect administration, and that there is no question of surrendering it for purposes of bargaining either with our Allies or with the enemy, and we trust that we are correct in this conclusion. It is unnecessary here to put forward any sug gestions as to the form or forms of administration eventually to be established in this area, as such suggestions would be alien to the present discussion. But as Indian interests—political, commercial and military—must be inti mately affected by the eventual decision on this point, we trust we shall be fully consulted before such decision is arrived at.As regards German East Africa, that territory has been regarded in many quarters here as offering an admirable field for Indian expansion, and hopes have been expressed that, whatever may be the future administration of that country, arrangements will be made to admit of Indian emigration on equitable f terms. Similar hopes have been expressed in regard to Irak, but we foresee that there may be serious drawbacks in connection with the idea of Indian colonisa tion in that region. This makes it the more important that Indian expansion should find an outlet in German East Africa. India’s needs in this respect have already been felt and will be felt more acutely in future. The provision of such a field of expansion would go far to solve some of the existing problems with regard to our surplus population. We trust this opportunity may not be let slip. No other territory is so suitable for Indian colonisation : none other so convenient of access; and there is already a considerable Indian population settled in the vicinity. We are not in a position to make any representation as to the future disposal or administration of German East Africa, but we most earnestly trust that this matter will be pressed and that the claims of India to the widest colonisation rights in what is now German East Africa will be strongly urged. 3. Turning to the second point, viz., the question of obsolete Treaty rights and territorial readjustments vis-a-vis our Allies, we think that it will be most convenient to consider our desiderata vis-a-vis each in turn as follows. 4. France .—The matters in which we are mainly interested, so far as Erance is concerned, may be summarised as follows:— (a) The Erench possessions in India and the Treaties of extradition connected therewith. (fi) The Treaties connected with Maskat. (c) The Erench claim to Sheikh Said and Southern Arabia generally* {d) The arms traffic at Jibouti. As regards (a), His Majesty’s Government are aware that we have for many years past desired the extinction of Erench territorial rights in India. Erench territory, particularly Chandernagore, has been for many years past a base for revolutionary propaganda and revolutionary conspiracies. It is unnecessary for us here to elaborate this point, which has formed the subject of considerable separate correspondence. We fully realize, however, that it may be very difficult to secure the complete extinction of the Erench Empire in India, but we trust that, should complete extinction be im possible, as suggested in paragraph 7 of the India Office memorandum, dated 20th April 1915, every endeavour may be made to induce the Erench Government to accept in exchange for Chandernagore and the other Settle ments and loges, with the exception of Pondicherry, territorial compen sation adjoining Pondicherry. If the Erench possessions in India could bo reduced to an enlarged but compact Pondicherry with a reasonably rectified frontier, we should, we think, have much less trouble in the future. With the centre of anarchism and revolutionary crime in Bengal and with no likelihood, so far as we can see, of its being transferred to Madras, it seems obvious that if there must be an Alsatia for political criminals and fraudulent debtors in India it is much better that it should be in Pondicherry than anywhere in Bengal. It is more remote and the surrounding country is less sympathetic. Its approaches could be more easily watched and guarded and the interests of a larger, more important and doubtless better governed Erench dependency would discourage the influx of bad characters. It is not improbable that the Erench Government may, however, demand more than mere territorial compensation for the proposed arrangement and they may conceivably hark back to the question of our extradition rights based on the Treaties of 1815 and 1876. In this connection we would invite attention to our despatch No. 107 (Secret—General) of the 4th August 1910. We think that as suggested there we might well agree to the modification, at any rate so far as political offences are concerned, of Article 16 of the Treaty of 1876 as part consideration for the concessions made by Erance in a general scheme of readjustment. At the same time if we are to agree to excludeit political offences from the operation of the Treaties of 1815 and 1876, we are strongly of opinion that more serious crimes, such as would affect ^he safety of our common interests in India, should be exempted from the category of political offences. Ihese should include, if possible, waging war, seducing troops, muider of officials or instigation thereto and offences against the Explosives Act. It would no doubt be desirable also to include the Arms Act, but if the French have no corresponding prohibition of their own there will probably be little chance of their agreeing to this. As regards (&amp;), the Maskat Treaties. Article 11 of the French Cominer* pial lieaty of i 814 with IVlaskat was theybws at origio of all the arms trouble in Maskat. That has now been laid to rest by the Agreement made with the French Government in 1914, whereby that Government renounced the right of invoking on behalf of French citizens, the privileges conferred by the Treaty of 1844 so far as such privileges were opposed to the Sultan’s ware house regulations. We may, therefore, we think, regard the Treaty of 1844 as now harmless so far as Indian interests are concerned, and no revision of it seems called for. As regards the Anglo-French Treaty of 1862, however, whereby France and Great Britain jointly guarantee the independence of Maskat, we have long felt that this Treaty is open to grave objection in that it gives the French a position at Maskat and consequently in the Gulf which interferes with our prescriptive rights in that region, and that further as interpreted in connection with the Bandar Jisseh case it precludes our acquiring or even leasing territory belonging to Maskat. Now, as His Majesty’s Government are aware, it may be at any time desirable on naval, commercial or administrative grounds for us to secure a portion of such territory either by lease or purchase. Gwadur is a case in point. We feel sure that, if the French Government can be induced to abrogate the Treaty of 1862, difficulties and friction in the future will certainly be thereby obviated. It is true that the Sultan of Maskat might view with some apprehension the abrogation of this Treaty, but the matter could be easily explained to him, and in view of the material assistance and support which we have rendered him in recent years he would doubtless be satisfied with our assurances in the matter. We trust that such steps as are possible will be taken to persuade the French Government to cancel this obsolete agreement, which, while it not only confers no benefit, but actuallv imposes an obligation on them, trammels us in our dealings with a petty State, on whose protection we have spent so much in recent years. As regards (c), we had no idea whatever until we received a copy of the * Enclosure to letter No. 51, dated the IStli lodia Office letter, No. P.-4769—14* of December 1914 from the Secretary, Political the 11th December 1914 to the Foreign Department, India Office. . 0ffice&gt; ^ ^ eonnected papers ^ French laid claim in any shape or form to Sheikh Said or the western portion of Arabia. We trust that steps may be taken to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government have never recognised and can never recognise the claims of the Societe Quest Asiatique or any other French claims in that region. As regards (d), the arms trade at Jibouti, this matter has already formed the subject of correspondence between Cairo and the Foreign Office {vide t Enclosure to letter No. 26, dated the 29th June Cairo S despatch to Sir E. Grey, No. 112,'f 1916, from the Secretary, Political Department, India dated 24th May 1916) and W6 need Only say that we trust that some efficient arrangement may be made whereby Jibouti may be prevented from becoming in the Bed Sea what Maskat was in the Persian Gulf. We regard this matter as of the utmost importance. 5. Russia .—We have already had occasion to submit our opinions on various matters connected with the post helium settlement with Bussia, notably in our Foreign Department secret telegrams of the 19th April, 13th May and 12th June 1915, but we would take this opportunity of somewhat elaborat ing our views. As regards Persia, if the Persian Government maintain their present attitude of neutrality to the end of the war, we may take it that no questionformal partition will arise, and we earnestly hope that this may he so, for of formal partition ’ uion of actua l partition, inyolving as it would a ve can only regard tl e p p ^ .a .i-x- obligations and expenditure, with very serious increase ,n 0 U ”f.

Such a condition would only lead to friction a i fflnnHv Wft do not suo-gest however by this any attempt at direct administration'. Our tim t thf immediate future should be to assist the Pe“an Government so far as possible themselves to establish a reasonably effective administration in Southern Persia. To this end the South Per i TUfles have been created. The estent of our interference w ith the actual administration must depend upon the extent to which the Persian Govern ment appear capable of improved administration, but, generally speaking, “„ce we have restored a modicum of peace and order in the main trade centres and on the main trade routes and re-established commercial facilities we should he content merely to advise as regards the actual administration of the country itself. This may appear somewhat a make-shift arrangement, but short of actual partition it appears to be the only course feasible. As regards the Persian Gulf, we assume that if the present neutral zone falls to us,°aU Russian claims in the Persian littoral will be ipso facto finally extinguished. It might be desirable perhaps to get this definitely stated. Phis somewhat v agueadmission by Russia referred to in Sir E- Grey s letter to Sir A. Nicholson, dated 29th August 1907, in connection with the Anglu- Russian negotiations, might certainly with advantange he reaffirmed in some definite form. _ Turning to Afghanistan, on the assumption that the Amir maintains his neutrality till the conclusion of the war, we consider that we shall be under considerable obligations to him: and so will Russia. Afghanistan could at any moment very seriously increase our embarrassments by joining our enemies, and the fact that she has not done so whatever may have been the motive, must count strongly in her favour. It is true that the present condi tions in Afghanistan are unsatisfactory in the extreme; that we know that Afghanistan is a hot bed of fanatical and anti-British intrigue ; that if the Amir maintains his neutrality it will be due mainly to the fact that Afghanistan lies between the devil and the deep sea—between Russia and ourselves. It is true that Afghanistan has been, and is, a constant source of anxiety ; that it has been a base of Pan-Islamist intrigue against the allied powers generally. Rut in suite of all this, if Afghanistan continues to the end neutral, we shall be under heavy practical obligations and there can be no question of our agreeing to any alteration in the status of Afghanistan that would interfere with its treasured independence. Indeed we shall have to consider some signal recognition of the Amir’s services, both as a reward for the past and an encouragement for the future. Assuming that the political status of Afghanistan is to remain unaltered we consider it of vital importance to the maintenance of that status without5 (&lt; Q for Ida (fiti eoi ( l ^0 won, 8 %, 10 B 00 ii the dEne IS, W 0 $yi! grasp- ghthe r oira itrictei te the )tficers lueiici, 1808 Ol srewas [riction t direct sisttiie sonahl?

We fully admit that the present Afghan system of administration may cause some occasional inconvenience to adjoining Russian territory just as it does in adjoining British territory, but that inconvenience was not, we think, such as to warrant the series of demands and complaints which the Russian Government made in regard to Afghanistan during that period. In 1912 they put forward a claim for an irrigation agree - 1 ment in regard to the Murghab and Hari Rnd rivers which was entirely inadmissible in the light of the ruling of the Afghan boundary Commission of 1885. In May 1914 they pressed a proposal to construct an irrigation canal from the Oxus with its head-works in Afghan territory, without any explanation of the difficulty or impossibility of locating those head-works in Russian territory. In the same year they pressed for a self-denying ordinance on the part of Great Britain in regard to concessions for railways, irrigation, &amp;c., in Northern Afghanistan, which we pointed out could only have the result of exciting the Amir’s liveliest suspicions. In May 1915, in connection with the question of the post helium settlement, they again apparently reverted to this demand. There were also various more or less frivolous complaints, e.g., connected with locusts which had not appeared, and Afghan raids into Russian territory which had not occurred. Indeed, we were forced to the conclusion that the Russian Government had made up their minds to have a standing grievance in regard to Afghanistan partly perhaps genuine, partly to bargain with in respect of demands elsewhere, while the necessary consequence was to embarrass our rela tions with the Amir. We hope that with the much more cordial understanding, established by the war, Russia may be induced to adopt a more reasonable and generous policy in regard to Afghanistan, and we would insist most strongly on the necessity of urging her to do so. She should be made to realise the peculiar relation in which we are placed by our Treaty obligation with that State, obligations which it would be impossible for us to ignore if the Amir maintains his present neutrality. The Afghan State may be an anachronism; if so, we must deal gently with it accordingly. Me should ask Russia to assist, instead of thwarting ns in the work of gradually breaking down the barriers of suspicion and conservatism which surround Afghan istan at present. This she can best do for the present by a policy of 4 hands off We on our part shall do our utmost to induce the Amir to adopt a more enlightened policy after the war (and he will doubtless then be more amenable to reason) and thereby to remove such inconveniences as at present exist in the relations between Russian territory and Afghanistan. The Russian Government might, we think, be assured that we have no ulterior motives whatever as regards commercial or other enterprises in Northern Afghanistan, and that we shall be ready to deal promptly with any definite matters of complaint against the Afghan Government that may arise. All we desire is to be left for the present to guide Afghanistan peacefully to more enlightened ways, without constant interference from Russia, especially in matters which can only serve to excite suspicion in the minds of the Amir and his advisers and thereby prolong the process. As regards Tibet, here again we want nothing but a reasonable and generous policy on the part of Russia. The circumstances of the last few years particularly the Tibet Conference and the consequent secret Treaty between Tibet and Great Britain, have placed Tibet in an even closer relation to ourselves than before, and both on this ground and on geographical grounds we must, we think, insist on our very exceptional position. The Chinese yoke has been removed from Tibet: and the Chinese Government have refused to subscribe to a Treaty actually signed by their representative. Por the time being therefore Chinese suzerainty has ceased to exist, at any late, so far as Outer Tibet is concerned. In these circumstances the Tibetan Govern ment have naturally turned to Great Britain for advice and assistance: and these have naturally been accorded. Until the future relations of China and Tibet—and indeed the future status of China herself—have been determined, there must inevitably be a period of diplomatic chaos as regards Tibet. Until the position clears, we think that Russia might reasonably agree* to our continuing the present practice, to which she has as yet taken6 no exception, and allow us directly to advise and assist tbe Tibetan Govern- ment—m despite of Article II of the Tibet Agreement of 1907—and herself abstain from all interference in this country. It might be made plain that we have no desire or intention to avail ourselves of any othei privileges, commercial concessions or the despatch of an Agent to Lhasa, contemplated j in the Tripartite Convention. It might be explained that we have no ambi tions, territorial or other in Tibet i and that our only wish is that Tibet should develop on peaceful lines without foreign interference. As regards the New Dominion, we have nothing to add to what is contained in our telegram of the ITth October 1915, in which we strongly deprecated any attempt to bring Chinese Turkistan into the post bellum settlement with Russia. If Russia herself raises the question, we should be glad to be consulted, and we need only now repeat that we regard the recog nition of a suitable boundary line on this side as an essential preliminary to any negotiations. It seems inevitable that a complete revision of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 will be necessitated by the post bellum settlement and doubtless the future of Iraq will form a portion of the revised Agreement. As already stated, this must closely touch our interests. Rut it is in regard to any revision of the Agreement regarding Afghanistan that we feel the greatest concern; and we trust that in this respect no arrangement will be concluded without our being given an opportunity of advising on the matter, and if his interests are even remotely atfected, of consulting the Amir. This is not only obligatory in accordance with a pledge we have recently given him, but it is essential in order to avoid sowing once more in Kabul the seeds of mistrust and suspicion such as were sown by the Agreement of 1907. 6 . Italy .—So far as Indian interests are concerned, Italy’s ambitions in the direction of the Eastern Littoral of the Red Sea, particularly in the direction of the Yemen, are disquieting. It was owing to apprehension regarding her ambitions in this direction that on the entry of Italy as our ally into the war we were at once forced to take military action in the form of the occupation of certain islands in the Red Sea—action we should not otherwise have taken—in order to prevent Italy from establishing a claim in this region. The question of Aden will be discussed in a later paragraph, and the policy we recommend will be stated, but the policy so indicated is contingent on the absence of any European Power from the region of Southern Arabia. The whole political and military situation in the Aden protectorate and the Hadramaut would be revolutionised if a European Power obtained a foothold in the Yemen or indeed anywhere on the Arabian Littoral. Indeed our policy in regard to Arabia must perforce be of the nature of a Monroe doctrine. We earnestly hope, therefore, that in return for compensation elsewhere an under standing may be arrived at wdth the Italian Government whereby she will admit that the Red Sea islands and Western and Southern Arabia are outside the sphere of her interests and influence. A subsidiary point in regard to Italy is the arms traffic in the Red Sea. We understand that His Majesty’s Government have already this matter „ ^ . i m o Q Jof * under consideration, and that the Eoreign « Vide enclosure to letter No. 28, dated the 13tJi ’ tt- July 1916, from the Secretary, Political Depart- Office have addressed* HlS Majesty S ment, India office. Ambassador at Rome on the subject. All we need do here is to express a hope that a satisfactory arrangement may be effected which will prevent Italian territory on the Red Sea from affording facilities to the arms traffic. 7. Japan .—We realise that in regard to Japan we are on very delicate ground. His Majesty’s Government are already aware of our apprehensions in regard to Japanese trade enterprise and in regard to the danger of Japan becoming a base for seditionist intrigue against India, and doubtless these matters are borne in mind and such action as is possible will be taken by His Majesty’s Government to safeguard Indian interests. We on our part can obviously put forward no useful suggestions at the present time. 8 . Turning to the question of Aden, the situation is still so fluid that is difficult to formulate a final opinion. We have not yet ousted theTurks from tlie Protectorate, and though we may assume that they will be evicted eventually we do not know yet under what conditions this will he effected, nor what the eventual attitude of the Imam will be. On the assumption, however, that the Turks will be finally removed from Southern Arabia ; that no other European Power will be allowed to obtain a foothold there, and that the Imam maintains his present attitude of neutrality, we think that our policy should be as follows :— (1) We should adhere faithfully to our guarantee to the Arabs not to extend our borders in Arabia. It may be argued that by siding with the Turks in many instances the Arabs have freed us from the obligations of that guarantee; but we believe that by adhering to it and by announcing that we mean to adhere to it, we shall benefit infinitely more politically than we should if we attempted forcibly to extend our borders ; (2) In any case, with the Turks gone and no other Foreign Power in the vicinity, there would be no single Power with whom to define spheres of influence, and it would be useless to attempt to lay down a one-sided definition of any fresh boundary for the Protectorate. (3) Assuming, as we have said, that the Imam remains neutral, we think we should come to terms with him and subsidise him in the same way as the Turks did; the details of such an arrange ment would, of course, remain for further consideration; (4) We should similarly make arrangements with other important Chiefs on the borders of the Protectorate, such as Mawia and Ahmed Noman, taking care that the arrangements made did not clash with the arrangements made with the Imam; ( 5 ) W T e should freely pardon all Chiefs of the Protectorate with whom we were formerly in Treaty relations, and should reaffirm those Treaties with ahy small modifications that may appear called for. These might include the right to establish sanatoria for our troops, and to build roads and railways, if necessary. It must be remembered that the tribes of the Aden hinter land have been put in a very embarrassing position by the Turkish advance and by our enforced retirement, and the wonder is not that some of them have sided with the Turks but that on the whole they have given us so little trouble ; ( 6 ) We should not attempt to annex Sheikh Said. In spite of its proximity to Perim, Sheikh Said has given us remarkably little trouble, and so long as no other Foreign Power sets foot there we need have no fears regarding it. To occupy it would merely be an irritation to the Arabs and afford a point of danger in the event of local hostilities; apart from the fact that it is a most inhospitable spot; (7) Our Treaties with the Imam and other Chiefs should include a clause precluding them from granting concessions of any kind to Foreign Powers without our consent; ( 8 ) We should not hereafter attempt to hold any portion of the Protectorate in force. The present war has shown that the Aden Settlement can hold its own entirely regardless of the hinterland. The combination against us on this side lias perhaps been the most formidable we are ever likely to face, namely, a European Moslem Power attacking us in a Moslem country. Yet Aden has never itself been seriously threatened. For the defence of Aden, therefore, it would appear useless to put military outposts into the hinterland which could only be distasteful to the people and which would doubtless have to be withdrawn in the event of trouble; ( 9 ) The port of Hodeida should be left to the Imam or whatever other Arab Chief has an established right to it. This port, at themercy of the Navy, would be a hostage in our hands for the good behaviour of the tribes dependent on it; while its occupation by us would undoubtedly be bitterly resented; (10) Our policy in the hinterland generally should he one of peaceful penetration. We should extend our influence as far as may be necessary by means of roads, education, trade and medical assistance though we should not advocate any extensive expendi ture on these objects in the near future. All that we really require is to be on reasonably friendly terms with our neigh bours in the hinterland. A forward policy in the Yemen, unless it was forced on us by the entry of some Foreign Power, could only lead to unrest and expense without compensating advant ages.

Vhao they contemplate, is, apparently that we should co uh oi us formally disinterest ourselves in Arabia. But a reciprocal agreement of that kind implies that the interests Oj. the two parties are equal, which, however, is very far from being the case; and it is necessary most carefully to avoid in any way binding ourselves to such a view. We fell into a ' similar trap in 1907 in the Anglo-Russian convention about Tibet, and have been struggling in vain to free ourselves ever since. That convention overlooked the fact that Russian interests in Tibet could never be commensurate with our ? s, because we are limitrophe with Tibet and Russia is not in any effective sense; and the same is true with regard to Italy and Arabia. Italy’s interest lies solely in the trade between the Red Sea ports and Eritrea; our’s lies in the fact that we are already a territorial Power in Arabia. It is the Yemen in which the Italians are especially interested, because of its economic possibilities. But it is the Yemen in which we can least of all disinterest ourselves because we are limitrophe with it, and we must have political relations with its master. Our difficulties in the Aden hinterland have been due at least as much to the Imam’s claims over tribes on our side of the border as to Turkish agression; and it is the Imam who will be left in possession after the war - until the Idrisi, or some one else, is strong enough to eject him. We cannot afford to make any terms with the Italians that wouldexclude the Imain from our influence* Farther north the Idrisi is of less consequence to us provided that he does not interfere in the Yemen and so create a disturoance near our borders. But we have recently concluded a treaty with him, which makes it impracticable to disinterest ourselves wholly in his affairs. Inter alia we have undertaken to safeguard his territories from attack by sea, to guarantee uis independence in his own domain, and to adjudicate between him and his rivals at the close of the war. On the other side of the Aden Protectorate is the Haaramaut, to which the Imam has claims, and Italians attention natfc already^ho^n ’Tion1 1 oned. In this we cannot possibly disinterest ourselves; indeed in 1913 we informed the Italian Government that 'the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla is an independent ruler enjoying the protection of His Britannic Majesty under the terms of the treaty of May 1st, 1888, between His Majesty’s Government and the rulers of Shehr and Mokalla. n ' As regards the Red Sea coast, we cannot divest ourselves of responsibility for the large number of Muhammadan British subjects, from India and elsewhere, who proceed annually via Jeddah to the Mecca pilgrimage* The Italians have no interest that can compare with our’s in this respect, fA&amp;uJL tyjr.j dJjiaL 22*4 &amp;JJ~./ utA^ CfM . sft~ 1 (^rnju Lvrdi h hflovi’irw ^(u- Csy^A favO'Us 6t/£s\j &amp;AAA)J\JLCsyV) ^ ^CCuA/bC (s^Lj / ^TWyxM, — fa 'jtfWr^iL (sy\ (^kj C(h^n^A^y\ hq, l^^u/i JV\&amp;J s */yvi*/^ 'j'fy L^\&amp;. ; Jr^XsiC syxQ (aax, y // ^lA/yiCA^u^^ /o7y\ju itrA' (fj- fav\ iUYYnirr^' (^/p^ Oj (^Avjr^ &lt;^UIaA Ma^ t) &amp; j/iA^un^ £ (/Cp\ vff&lt;U’ (v foiob,&lt;/ut fan, ^ /p&lt;?h\ (jj^ lc favLonn^Yi - fax O^aatyyx ^rv ffa &lt;^, /fa cJ&amp;{~ j Ccyvyrri vtfZi, , vlwi farOiy (/^y^ OfxJj/y^ 0(4 (JV\, HcJaaaXj dj- fa^K, J'lCfa in filCu~ XK/ (iUlz : — 7. To return to Arabia. Italy was not a party to the Anglo-Riisso-French agreements regarding the Arab State, and while it is almost certain that she will object to the allotment of Mersina and Adana to France, it is possible that she w.dl also object to Article 10 (of M. Gambon's note of 9th May 1916), which is in fact directed'against her, and which provides that “ Les ‘' Gouvernements anglais et francais . . . se mettront d’accord pour ne “ has acquerir, et ne eonsentiront pas qu’une tierce Puissance acquiere, de possessions territoriales dans la peninsule arabique 011 construise une base “ navale dans les iles sur la cote est de lamer Rouge.” And though she may acquiesce in this, she may yet claim a sphere of influence, short of territorial possession, in the 1 emeu. Italian interests in that district have been emphasised lately in the imperialist press, e.g., L'tdea Nazionalc, which wrote on dord July that the really important matter is to secure the political and economic influence of Italy in the Yemen, which is an indispensable complement to hrithrea, and asked if any other Power could put in counter claims (Sir R. Rodd, No. 231 of 2fth July). Our policy, of course, is “Arabia for the Arabs.” We have no counter claims: but vre do not recognise anyone else s claims. The Arabs detest the Italians; and since in the 1 urco-ltalian war. the Italians supported the Idrisi Sa/yid of Asir and blockaded the coast of the Yemen, it is hardly to be supposed that the Imam of Sanaa the Idrisi s mortal enemy and the de facto Master of the Yemen — would welcome them. Their intrusion could only be a constant source of dis turbance, and ©1 inconvenience to us at Aden. For this reason, it is desirable if possible to induce them to accept the Anglo-French agreement and to abandon all claims in Arabia and the Red Sea by compensation elsewhere. Possibly breach Somaliland—if, as suggested in Section 3 above, the French can be induced to quit it—ni ght be allotted to them. But'it would have to be in return for a every binding, agreement regarding the arms traffic ; for no purpose will have been served if a French trade is merely to be replaced by an Italian one. r 4 i 0&lt;&amp;i Uvtk ' C/CU' U Cm^JcAoC fo, tuf sf Mcr, &lt;/&lt;W,4 ^ Hw K Crr^/Uc, Wt, u the ^ W ' &amp;U- C leered ^ ^ ^ rf (£ u fuu Ckx. /b frvn (C Con, : t ft h hwf Cc^f/^ £ Cm^ ^ fayy (r(^ TV^kJama £ ImJ?

Hirtzel's objections to admitting Italy to territory or political influence in Western Arabia, and especially in the Yemen: and I hope it may be possible to provide compensation elsewhere for disappointed ambitions in this quarter. But it we are pressed hard, I am afraid that it might be difficult to maintain successfully in discussion with our Ally Italy the three principles enumerated in the last para, of the Minute. C-ood reasons could be given for i &amp; iii. But to ii, especially ii(a)^the Italian Government are unlikely to agree. We are not in a position to apply the Monro doctrine to the whole of Western Arabia and say that we cannot view with equanimity the acquisition by any other power of political influence there^^^a^for ourselves the ri^it uo make at any time hereafter an agreement of a political nature with the Imam. For the time being it might be possible to fend off the Italian enquiry by pleading the conditional promises which the French and ourselves have held out to the Sharif and our anxiety to do or suffer nothing which might hamper the future Arab State or Confederacy of States if it should come into being. I assume that the agreements between the French and ourselves respecting the future of Arabia and thepromises made' 7 to the Sharif will be communicated to the Italians, end that they will be invited to acquiesce in Article 10 of Mr. Gambon’s Note of 9th May 1916 (quoted by Sir A. Hirtzel). In explanation of our attitude we mipht say that the only treaty which we have made with any State in W. Arabia is with the Idrisi, and that the terms of that Treaty are strictly limited to guaranteeing his independence and were made with the object of detaching him from the Turks and promoting an understanding between him and the Sharif. Y/e seek no political predominance over his territories, and have sought no concessions from him; to ijsiiew- the same policy of restraint i respect of the Imam and other States in Western Arabia. Without formally disinteresting ourselves in the affairs of that region we have no ulterior object beyond securing the independence of its chief schiefs ani tribes and maintaining conditions that will admit of its political development on the lines of the promises made to the Sharif and those associated with him. While this is the policy which v/e have prescribed for ourselves in the best interests of Western Arabia, as we conceive them, candour requires us to point out that the special relations which exist between the ruler of the Yemen and the tribes and states of the Aden protectorate, the active commercial intercourse between his subjects and those of the protected States, and the indefiniteness of the geographical boundaries between the Imam's territory and the Protectorate, give us a strong interest in the Yemen and make it impossible for us to recognise that any other outside power has a superior interest in that region or to acquiesce in the acquisition by it of treaty rights conferring a political predominance or special commercial or industrial privileges. ?. hr-.

Again it is obvious that England and Russia have come to an understanding about the Straits.

Still greater are England’s Viumphs in Arabia and Mesopotamia. With the revolt of the Ss-an achievement obvmusly hers-England has now under her influence all the Arabian coast except the Yemen. She holds the best nart of Mesopotamia, has blocked the Baghdad Railway and thus possesses the key to the other route to Asia; whilst her occunation of Tndi Ke mt! an c °n s oli&lt;lates her position and shields the frontier of India. These gams are worth more than all her sacrificesTn the of SyrFa ^ n ° W m ° re ° r leSS ins nred her future possession Thus, the direction of our Allies’ activities has left untouched the southern part of Asia Minor; and there—from the Gulf of Smyrna to Alexandretta-a zone of influence remains for Italv T is zone falls naturally to Italy in compensation for but still more as a direct political consequence of—her Allies’ gains For .all these gam, injure Italj in Varying degree :K“ B S” p e„^g of the Straits will add a further formidable Mediterranean com petitor; England’s annexation of Egypt cuts Italy off from her Red Sea colonies; a French Syria will mean the cutting of the one other route to the East which could possibly compete with the Suez Canal and connect the Mediterranean with Mecca. This last point—the absolute severance of all possible direct connection between Italy and the centre of Islam—is worth empha sising, since it must not be said that Syria is too slight a com pensation for France, and that Italy's withdrawal of all claim to the zone from Al’exandretta to the Egyptian frontier is no great sacrifice. The sole road—now that the Suez route is cut— which can connect the Mediterrahean with Arabia and the Red Sea will be the Hejaz railway, with its branches to various places on the Syrian coast. Now we resign our claim to this connecting route in favour of France. But that is not all; the Hejaz has long been an isolated province, and the Holy Places have therefore fallen under the influence of Egypt. The opening up of the Hegiaz Railway Will withdraw from Egyptian influence the centre of Mohammedanism, and will tend to transfer it to the influence of the owners of Syria and Lebanon. That influence we also renounce, together with all our other titles to Syria which for many years Italian settlers, and, above all, Italian religious foun dations, have constituted. But we do lay claim to the southern part of Asia Minor. Since our right to it cannot be gainsaid, its precise boundaries alone remain to be discussed.

THE NEAR EAST.” L’Idea Nazionale (August 16) lias another leading article on “Italy’s Rights Oversea,” this time on “ The Partition of the Near East.” It begins by drawing a rather highly- coloured picture of the “programmes of expansion,” which the conquests and military enterprises of the Allies now fairly c early delineate. Russia is to have virtual possession of Northern Persia, to possess Armenia, and parts of N W \sia Minor, Constantinople, and the Dardanelles; “England in the changed character of her dominion in Egypt has, as we have ahead} pointed out, actually realised a design which seemed fantastic—viz., the possession of the Eastern gate of the Mediterranean and of the route to the East. This fact, gigan- tie m its effects, would alone suffice to compensate her for the sacrifices of the war.” But besides this she has extended her influence over all the Arabian coast with the exception of lemen . The command of the Persian Gulf gives her he control of the other route to the East. She has occupied Kerman to secure the Indian frontier and Ahwaz for the sake oi its oil, and brought the greater part of Mesopotamia under hei rule These successes constitute the most brilliant solu tion of the Eastern Question that England could hope for from every point of view. Prance has intensified her activity on the Syrian coast and consolidated her protectorate of the Syrian Catholics, thus securmg a set-off to the British possession of Egypt and r il 16 80 ^ hern c °ast of Asia Minor—from Smyrna to the Alexandretta—which remains unclaimed, is thus mr lffl 0U f t a !

This agreement is important because it provides a ready-made Am™J°\ the r'\ a ¥?T ent Under discussion among the ‘ . e8 w bich is to substitute actual possession for concessions of influence in Asiatic Turkey-Germany’s share being appa! rently assigned to France. Italy came late to Asia Minor, and only obtained a condi- fromtbp n r eS R 0n /S r r eparat0 P' work of the southern coast from the Gu f of Budrum as far as Adana. And even this nas contested by her neighbours—by the Germans, who did not want to see Italy in Cilicia (in spite of the Triple Alli- ance) by the Austrians, and further by.the English, who kpd 1 f° keep Ital y ° ut of Gulf of Budrum, and who talked of a plot on the part of the Triple Alliance to get command of the Eastern Mediterranean. It seemed that there was no place for Italy in Asia Minor while she formed part of the Triple Alliance! But now the position is changed Italy has taken her part in the war a “ d ha8 a n ? h t to her part in the settlement. England was x liberal in her offers to Greece earlier in the war; and Italy ought surely to rank before Greece. The correspondent concludes by again urging that Italian troops should be sent to Salomki as a symbol of ItalyX interests in the Eastern question.

July 24ili^J.9l6 % ; Sir:- It may be of interest briefly to summarise an editorial which appeared in yesterday’s issue of the Homan or&amp;an, the ' l, Idea Nazionale”, dealin^^ with the situation created by the Arab rebellion against the Turks, because this paper is the mouthpiece of the chauvinistic party in this country who aim at Italian aggrandisement with ambitions which certainly outsoar the present resources and capacities of the country. It must not be assumed that the views there put forward represent in any way the official stand-point; they are those of a minori ty , but a minority which makes itself heard in the Cnamber, gaining adherents among the younger generation, and to some extent moulding public opinion. The article begins by asserting the necessity, in the interests of the Mussulman world, that the Holy Cities should not be directly or indirectly touched by any Christian Power, ana in the interests of Italy, that a Caliphaoe should not be founded under foreign influence ana so become an instrument of antagonism to Italian expansion in the East. The present rebellion might com promise an equilibrium which had been perhaps the most advantageous from the Italian point of view. The more obvious issue at present was that of the future of the Yemen, which formed an indispensable complement to Erithrea. The Hight Honourable *046j Rrithrea. There were indissoluble connections between the Yemen, Eritrea and Abyssinia, dating from at least lwo til0usa ^ years ago, and it was Trom the Yemen that iblamism iuid come to Eritrea, Massowah was largely inhabited Dy itraos Trom the opposite coast, especially irom the Yemen, and all its trade was with the opposite coast, tne transfer of which to another Power would mean uhe economic extinction of the centres on tne Eritrean littoral. Gan any other Power put forward valid counter- claims? The other coasts of the Bed Sea and the Persian Gulf are virtually in British control, Tne Yemen therefore must remain free from all foreign control and develop its commercial relations with Eritrea. In the hands of a colonising Power it would develop its considerable natural resources, but the internal conditions would render such an undertaking formidable. It might be a wise policy to keep in view the different religious tendencies which manifest them selves in this region, and encourage the formation of various independent provinces, separating the Sunnites from the Shiites and these from the Ishmaelites, and to taxe advantage of the rivalry between nonnal and sedentary Bedouins, while securing for Italy an influence especially on the coast, with the development of roads, railways and harbour works. This, the article concludes, is the really important matter, to secure the political and economic influence of Italy in the Yemen. To this aspiration, small as com pared with the influence which Great Britain will secure in Mesopotamia, in.the Persian Gulf and on the Arabian coast, or France in the Mediterranean and Syria, can hardly be found objections on the part of Italy’s allies. She haslias silently accepted, the British annexation of Egypt, which involves the admission that the internationalisation Oi the Suez Canal is annulled* It is not too much to ask in order to counter-Balance such a change of equilibrium, quite apart from adequate compensations on the Eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, that Italy’s historic rights over the Yemen should Be recognised. The ’’historic rights' of Italy would seem to Be derived from a history which has not Been long in the making.

Italian Ambassador here lias raised the question ol spheres in Asia Minor, and more especially Syria, in conversation with President of the Council. President l oi the Council informed him that although there had oeen various conversations in London and Petrograd, particularly when military operations in the East had been discussed, those conversations could not be t considered precise and definite agreements. Italian Ambassador persisted in stating that Syria was large enough for friendly countries like France and Italy both to be able to satisfy their ambitions and in terests therein in agreement, whereupon President of the Council reminded His Excellency that Italy’s position in regard to Asia Minor had been defined in the London Agreement of April 1915, and that the region touching the Mediterranean, to which Italy's aims were directed, had, although in general terms, been defined and accepted by the other Powers; the Syrian region where France had traditional and un disputed interests was not in any degree affected by the agreement with Italy, ItalianItalian .ambassador having replied that he had in view the region ot Adalia and Adana, President of the Council observed that Adalia was in the zone ear- mailed (visee) by Italy, but the region of Adana was of special interest to France, President of the Council thought it well in con clusion to confine himself to expressing his convic tion that when peace came all these questions would be seutlea by the Powers in full agreement with one another,their respective interests being taken into account w His Excellency trusts that you share his views on this question and tnat you will see fit to use similar language to Italian Ambassador in London,,</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001a6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/527</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001a6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/527</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 53/1915 Pt 6 'The War: Arab Kingdom; Italian claims'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-01-18T11:19:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (176 folios)</extent><extent>The subject 55 (German War) consists of 5 volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/524-527.
