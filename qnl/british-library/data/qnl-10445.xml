The British commenced a restoration in 1856 which radically changed the function of the tanks. This is described on pp. 11-12 of the volume.The planting of trees and creation of gardens evident in the centre of this image is mentioned in the text on p. 12.Inscriptions:In pencil, upper right corner adjacent to print: ‘3’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Mercer Hunter</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ethnographic heritage</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023400730.0x00000d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
