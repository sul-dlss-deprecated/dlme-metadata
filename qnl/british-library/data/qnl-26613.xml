Marked on the map are eight lines drawn in crayon, which are referenced in a corresponding key. The lines represent lines that have been or are being considered as boundary lines for eastern Saudi Arabia. These include a red line representing Ibn Saud's [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] claim; blue and violet lines representing boundaries established in the Anglo-Ottoman Conventions of 1913 and 1914; a proposed (but later discarded) 'desert zone' in yellow; lines marking the first, second, third, and final offers made by the British Government to Saudi Arabia (green, brown, dotted blue, and dotted violet).A note on the reverse of the map reads 'Clauson's map' [Gerard Leslie Makins Clauson, Colonial Office].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049623112.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
