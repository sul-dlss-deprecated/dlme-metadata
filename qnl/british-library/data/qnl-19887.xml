His inquiries confimied the stories reported in my desp&amp;tch referred to above anu he IJierefore visited the Governor of Gusbi&lt;h, 2. The Governor informed Mlrza Abbas that he h^d not received any instructions from Tehr«n nor did he propose asking for any. He stated that the 'iiijil' authorities had requested him to assist them in getting the villager® to register themselves, he taerefore ordered tue /-.mnieh authorities to send or 'take any villager not in possession of a 'iiijil-i -ahwal' to the office of the bijil' department. There w^s no question of Bahrainis in particular, but the order covered all persons not in possession of proper documents. Various people had refj ^sed to register themselves as Persians on the plea that they wore Bahrainis. Government of Bahrain, ^s these documents could not be recognised by him, the Governor declared that people holding them would either have to take out 'Sijils' or be dealt with acc-ording to law. give those who possessed Bahrain certificates ten d ^ys- grace during which time he would instruct the ymnieh not to interfere with them. Others, even though they stated they were Bahrainis, would have to take out 'Sijils'. After the expiry of ten days he could do no more for us. He particu larly asked that no mention should b^ made in any official On kirza Abbas's request the Governor undertook to c o r r e s p o nd e nc eU (tp carrecpondence Perei^n «ifflo3»lte k.nd ourfcelves of hiii having given any concession to the Bahrfainis it our request. 4, Mirza Abbas states that from private enquiries which he made he believes that there are .'jbout three thou^end male Bahrainis in Gusbah, and th»t of this nunber rbout are three or four hundred in possession of Bahrain certificates of nationality, he gathered from some of the Governor's remarks that the Amnieh authorities had seized a number of these certificates. 1 thini;,however,th^t even those without documents will be left alone for the next ten days as it is quite impossible for the Governor to imprison two an 1 a half thousand people, and I think his readiness to r^ive ten days grace may be accounted for either by the fsct thrit he is himself referring to Tehrya or, realising he is wrong, is gently withdrawing hie forces. 6.

They assert that they have been warned if they come to rae again, their houses will be burnt down. 2. 1 h.dve informed those men who came here that I have reported the whole nu tter, and that, oendin^ ita settlement, if they are harasaed any more they muat take •^ijils to protect themselves, but to do so only as a last resort. I pointed out that provided they have re jittered themselves in iiehrain, the fact of taking i ersian . ijila now under presture should not prejudice their claim to Bahrein nationality v /hen tlie whole question is settled, moreover nat with a ^ijil there is nothing to prevent their going to iiahrain should they wish to do so, and once in Bahrain tney couid tiirow away their i^ijils and be ii&amp;hir^iiiis. I stressed the point that as iaahrainis they could not hold ^jesty's Cons il for Khuzistan, A ^ 2.^-7 •21 landei property in Persia, &amp;• that they must weiifh up the case for themselves, and decide whether their property ani life in Persia %£ werth becoming a Persian subject far, or whether they couli afford to sive u^ every thinf to be Bahrainis. 3, I v /as very careful to say that the forgoing was my own idea on the subject and no one else's, and that no guarantee went with it. It was simply that at present they were receiving ill-treatment at the hands of the Persians and that if this continued and it became imperative to do something at once, in my own opinion, what I had said was the best thing to do, since nothing else could be done quickly enough. I added that the only drawback to taking a dual nationality was that while they remained in Persia their sons would be faced with two years* compulsary service in tke Persian Army, and that since all their interests lay in Persia, this was a very small price to pay for what they received from Persia, I have the honoue to be.

I have the honour to refer to my letter No. 302-o of 8th March 1934. Before giving my views on the present situation as reported hy His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, I should like to take this opportunity of review ing the whole question as it appears to me personally. His 'ajesty's Minister has already been unofficially informed of my views. 2. The oppression hy the Persian Government of Bahrainis consists in conscription, the forced accept ance of Persian nationality, the confiscation of pass ports and other forms of pressurs, of which the most acute issue is conscription. 3. The Bahrainis who are most affected live in the Ahwa* consular district which includes lohanmerah. Hie number of Bahrainis who live in this district is approximately about 8000, of which about 2300 own agricultural property, thus leaving about 6700 non- property owners, namely, loharamerah 1700, Gusbah and suburbs including Abadan about 4000, the balance being-2- c /tr toelnfr women and children. Those who own agricultural property have no claim on our assletance unless and until they divest themselves of their property. Should they wish to retain their property under the ;eralan law they should hecoroe Persian subjects. he others, however» should /be protected hy us so far as ■''« are able. Since our protests to the Persian Government on behalf of Bahralnls have been unavailing the question of retaliatory measures against Persian subjects in Bahrain has been considered In the past by various authorities from time to time, lor Instance, In para graph 10 of his letter of 5th May 1931 sir Hugh Blscoe proposed that Persians In Bahrain should be treat' as Bahrain subjects. Mr Dodd In his letter of 9th Seotem- ber 1931 said that this was not logical. Sir Hugh Blscoe, however, in paragraph 2 of his despatch of the 6th November 1931, explained that all he meant was that the Persians In Bahrain should be subject to the Jurln- dlctlon of the Bahrain courts In exactly the same way as British subjects are subject to the Persian courts. This proposal Sir Hugh Blscoe made with the object of bringing pressure to bear on the erelan Government to give better treatment to Bahralnls In Persia. Prima fwcti« it would be quite reasonable for us to say to the erslan Oovernrnent: 'In spite of our pfcpteats you continue to oppress the Bahralnls In Persia who are under our protection. It Is unreasonable for you therefore to expect us to protect your subjects In Bahrain, tod In fact we are going to do so no longer. The Jurisdiction of our Political Agent over them will be removed and they will become subject to the Juris diction of the Shaikh, tie, and his people, are extremely angry at the treatment which you have been meting out to his subjects In Persia, and it Is possible__ -3- possible that he may tuiopt retaliatory roeasuree, but that Is your affair not ours.' Before »e made this announcement - or threat - to the erslan Government, which of course we siould be fully prepared to carry out, we would have to consider; (a) whether such a sten suited us In Bahrain; (b) whether It would have the desired effect on the Persian Government. 8, Mr Jodd brought out one Important point In paragraph 4 of his dsspatch. I.e. that the claim the Persian Government to Bahrain was Involved In their treatment of Bahralnls. 'To ask the Persian Government to exempt the Bahralnls (from conscription) Is to aslc them to abandon their claim In favour of that of His Majesty's Government.* In other words If the Persian Government do not conscript Bahrain 1b they acknowledge them to be foreign subjects. This being so, there Is no doubt that the Persian Government will persist In their efforts to turn Bahralnls Into Persian subjects, and If we are to Influence the Persian Government by reorlsals, the latter will I think have to be severe and prolonged, and of such a nature that neither His Majesty's Government, nor Indeed the Shaikh, who Is a humane man, could countenance. 6. As pointed out In my previous letter this question has again reached a critical form, the Persian Government having renewed their oppression with appa rently greater severity than ever, which has resulted In brutal treatment of Bahralnls causing the death of one and the foaltreatment of another. Whatever may be the Persian Law In the matter there Is certainly no law by which such treatment can be meted out to Individuals, resuimbly His Majesty's Minister would be on very■ I'.'. ♦very strong grounds In protesting most severely against such action. If no satisfaction Is obtained from the Persian Government I venture to suggest that the advisability of using the threat of publicity. as was done In the case of the British Indian subject who was flogged at Charbar ( vide correspondence ending India with the Govt .of/letter to H.M.'s ivlnlster at Teheran, No .F.148-N of the 4th January 1931} might be con sidered. 7. To sum up . I am of opinion that such reta liatory measures as are practicable would certainly annoy the Persian Government but would not achieve the end we have in view, I.e.the stopping of the oppression of the Bahralnls In Persia, .'ith regard to the oresent recrudescence of Ill-treatment of Bahralnls, the only course I can suggest Is that a strong protest be addressed to the Persian Government, and that In the event of their not responding the question of suitable publicity might be considered. In conclusion, however, I must point out that the benevolent rule of His Excellency JhaiKh Hanad under which •ersians flourish in Bahrain, and the brutal treatment which is meted out to His Sxcellency's subjects in Persia,(for the protection of sboa His Majesty's Government are partly responsible), fom a glaring contrast to which ills Sxcellency %aiSch Harad has not infrequently referred, and which has an adverse effect on our prestige along the Arab littoral.

W. 1. 25th April Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with the G-overnment of India's letter of 7'^ April 1934&gt; a copy of which was forwarded with India Office printed letter P, Z» 2569/311-, of l^th April, on the subject of the ill- treatment of Bahreinis in Persia, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to s ay that after careful consideration of the views of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and the Government of India, he agrees with the Government of India that no action can usefully be taken invthe matter vis-a-vis the Persian Government at the present time, except to make further protests. Sir Samuel Hoare would therefore suggest that if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs sees no objection. His Majesty's Minister at Tehran should now be instructed to make strong representations to the Persian Government against the recent ill-treatment of Bahreinis by the local Persian authorities at Gusbah which resulted in the death of one Bahreini and serious injury to another, and t» remind the Persian Government, if he sees no objection, of the promise made by the Minister of Court to Sir Robert Olive in 1929. On the other hand. Sir Samuel Hoare, while in favour of immediate action on these lines, equally shares the opinion of the Government of India that no final solution of the/ Under -Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S. V/, 1.Sli- 2* the qiestion of the position of Bahreinis in Persia is possible unless and until the Persian Government abandon their claim to Bahrein and he does not consider the present case of sufficient importance to Justify His Majesty's Government in pushing matters to such extremes as to provoke a serious rupture with the Persian Government* 2. Prom the despatch of bth March from His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz, a copy of which was enclosed in Tehran despatch N#.117&gt; of Jth March, it seems possible that the action of the local authorities to compel Bahreinis to take out Persian nationality documents may for the present at any rate have ceased. While the Secretary of State considers that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran should continue in future to protest against any case of persecution of Bahreinis in Persia by the Persian authorities, he agrees with the view cf the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran that Bahrein subjects permanently residing or owning land in Persia would serve their own interests best by accepting Persian nationality - particularly if the Political Resident confirms Sir R^Hoare's assumption that this will not involve forfeiture of their Bahrein nationality. He considers however that it would be preferable, with a view to avoiding any misunderstanding of our attitude in the matter, that advice to this effect which may be given by His Majesty's Consular Officers should be given informally on the lines adopted by Captain Chauncy and reported in his letter of 12th February to His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz# I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.)

It certainly seems most probable that these two people were in fact Bahrainis and ?^ere aot Persians, but it is perhaps worth pointing out nevertheless that, on the fact available, this is no more than a probability. If the fathers of these two men were born in Persia, and resided there at iho age of eighteen, the sons (i.e. th i victims in the present aifair) would by Xersian law be Persian subjects notwithstanding the fact that they were born outside Persia. 3. In other words, the victims may possibly be of dual nationality quite apart from the Persian claim to Bahrain. 4. Very likely this point has already occurred to you independently, but as you will shortlybe replying officially to our letter Ho.E.2633/1561/91 of the 9th May it seemed worth drawing your attention Yours ever, ( D.) c :OHC : CFOSL.

The Proclamation infringes the unrestricted grant to Jiis Majesty's Government of jurisdiction over all foreigners ceded by the Shaikh in 1909, since as regards foreigners born in/iHf -2- in Bahrain, its effect is to limit (His Majesty 1 s Govern ment's) jurisdiction to those who are registered at the Political Agency. specific case which was discussed by therolitical Resident and the rolitical Agent at Bahrain. On receiving the sanction of the Resident through the Political Agent the Bahrain Govern- • ment then issued the Proclamation in question, and the rolitical Agent published a Notification informing foreign subjects accordingly. 6. In these circumstances, as we took off idea cognisance of the Bahrain Governments Proclamation by issing a Notifica tion of our own, I do not think that there is any actual necessity for the exchange of any formal letters as suggested in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter No»iS 6673/166/91 oi the 16th November 1933, and it would indeed appear somewhat strange to the Shaikh for us to take such a step some five years after the event. 6. In conclusion it may not be out of place to point out that the practical result of the Proclamation will be that, as Persians and other foreigners only in a very iew cases take the trouble to register the births of their children at the Agency, the number of 'foreigners' 1 under the jurisdiction oi the Shaikh will in the course of time increase# I am sending a copy of this letter to xxis Majesty's Secretary of State for India.

In the case of (b)j foreigners born in Bahrain are treated in Bahrain as Bahrain subjects unless they specifically divest themselves of l^ahrain nationality by having their names entered in a Register kept by the Bahrain Agency. 4. ihere is in Bahrain no law (other than the rule quoted above) by which nationality can be judged, but in a small place /where 1 i ^ )tri© Sxiaikn of i^ahrain ^includinj oorsons born in * i n .,?• marriage nationality v/ould ordinarily 10 low that of the father, though nothing is laid down. v/liere the mass of the people are known little or no difficulty arises in practice. Any doubtful case would be decided (so far as Bahrain is concerned) on its merits by the Shaikh and the Political Agent in consultation. 5. Persons in category (a) subjects of His E^ellency tram of foreign parents, but not registered in the Agency) have recourse in cases (both criminal proceedings and civil suits) between themselves to the Bahrain Courts.

If it is thought desirable to reply to the Persian Oriental i,ecretary ? s letter of the 16th Hay in detail^ I would suggest the attached redraft of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the original draft. I venture, however, to thin}: that, as the /question)! W 3. question ol rreaty negotiations is for the present in abeyance. Els Excellency Shaikh Hamad would prefer that as little as possible should be communicated about Bahrain to the Persian Gkr /ernment v/ho, in his view as an independent Ruler, have no concern in the internal administration of Bahrain, where Persians receive kindly treatment and where it is open to any zggTiQVQd- Persian to seek redress in properly constituted Oourts.

Reference Foreign and Political Department Sxpread f' Letter No.F .lOl-N/34, dated the 30th May 1934. 2. The rna-iTi point at lesue dealt with In Foreign Office letter referred to is the extent to which His Majesty's Govern- ment can espouse the cause of Bahrainis in Persia who are ill- treated by the Persian Government. 3. As is pointed out in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Olfice fjC letter No.B 2623/1661/91 of 9th May 1934 certain assumptions have of recent years been made in this connection which are summarised as follows: (1) That His Majesty^ Government were legally justij let in espousing the cause of the Bahrainis resident in Khuzlstan, &lt; 2)/ (Signature)-2- (2) That the troubles of these Bahrainis were attributable chiefly if not wholly to the dispute regarding the Persian Government's claim to Bahrain, and (3) That these people would cease to oe molested if the Persian Government could be induced to renounce that claim, 4# What does, as pointed out in Foreign Office letter under reference, nullify these assumptions is the fact that by the Persian Nationality Law (paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter) even if the Persian claim to Bahrain were withdrawn, it would still be open to the Persian Government to claim Bahrainis in Persia under the said Law. From another point of view, too, • (Foreign Office letter, paragraph 6)even if the Persian Govern- t ment agreed to regard the Bahrainis in Persia as foreigners, those concerned who own land would lose their means of liveli- hood, since foreigners are not allowed to hold real estate in Persia. 6. There is no actual Bahrain Nationality Law. Neverthe less it may be assumed that even without such a law Bahrainis - &lt; (on the analogy of ^us soli') have a claim to be Bahrain subjects. This, howeverj does not help very much, since, whatever their claims may be, as pointed out in paragraph 8 of Foreign Office letter, most Bahrainis in Persia would be of dual nationality and while in Persia their master nationality would have to be Persian. 6. There must be however some Bahrainis who come to Persia temporarily, like any other foreigner, to seek work as coolies, small shopkeepers, etc. These individuals would not/-3- .. 1^0 ' not have dual nationality but would be Bahrainis, and it is on tneir 'bfiiiaXt 'that* His ' 8 Govt;rmn&amp;ii't could ppesumaoly i.iake representations. But it is this class of indivicLuaXs that the Persian Government claim as their subjects on the basis of their claim to Bahrain. sd. T. C.

Wi bup;;ect :- Visit of Llonsieur G-eorges Gassin, French Consul at Bushire, to Banrain - ^lay 1934. Sir, ^ f t j0 I have the honour to refer to the fourth paragraph oi my letter Jo:G/^S7 dated the 1st July 1933 regarding foreign Consular representation in Bahrain and to inform you that Llonsieur Georges Gassin, the French Consul for Bushire, arrived in Bahrain by the eastbound^ aeroplane on the 23rd Llay and left for Karachi by the eastbound aeroplane a week later. 2. On hearing that he had landed I asked Llonsieur Gassin, who was at the Imperial Airways' Rest Eouse, to stay with me, but though obviously grateful, he excused himself (most politely) on the ground that he was here for a whole week, too long a time to trespass on my hospitality. I v/ould have pressed the invitation later on, but unfortunately Llrs. Loch fell ill. 3- So far as I 'know, Monsieur Gassin did not attempt to io any formal consular act, nor, indeed, is there any French national (though there are a number of oyrians) here at present as the pearl Merchants have not yet come. He has, however, displayed activity in other directions. 4. He visited the Gil Field of The Bahrain Petroleum company Limited and was shown round, a curious little incident /arose: On 2. \ oxiw r\ i arose out oi this as Llonsieur Cassin informed the Assistant Political A^ent (who saw him on my behalf one day) that the Company had no objection to his having a map of Bahrain ing tue oil wells ii I would allow him to''* He also said tnat he was told that the Shaikh had issued a proclamation jiin^ic^ t ie concession into oeing* Lxr# Skinner, to whom I meritionec the map on his telephoning me about another matter, oai^ tnat he would not give a map to anyone except to myself, and certainly not to a foreign Government, It is possible that Monsieur Cassin may have misunderstood Mr. Davies, who took niiii round, but tne lact remains that he designed to submit a report on the Oil Pield to his Government. Nor can he be prevented from doing so any more than can any other private person. At a later meeting I told Monsieur Cassin that no proclai.iation had oeen issued, but that an ordinary Agreement Jad uade, ana. that ^r. D^'inner nad informed me tnat he was not willing to give copies of maps with wells to anyone. Llonsieur Oassin did not press the matter. I would ado. that in my conversation with .Jr. Skinner, i particularly emphasised that Monsieur Gassin had no official status here. I did this because I had a feeling that LIr. Skinner was thinking that, if a French Consul could wander unchecked, an American Consul could do the same. 5. luonsieur ^assin asked me if he could get trade figures U^ports and exports lor the last two years, showing the chief countries concerned) from the director of Customs, but I managed put him of! oy giving him some figures of a general nature myself. He is quite open about wishing to encourage French trade here. 6. ilonsieur Cassin is unlikely to come to Bahrain again \ e -cept possibly for a flying visit) and his activities were not 310 a formal nature, nor extensive enough, to justify my calling 1£' O A IShis attention to the xiXclusive iigreement of 1892. 7. It is impossible to prevent foreign Consular Officers irom visiting ^ahrain in their private capacities, but I feel t:iat it \Yould be prudent to consider whether it is possible to do anything to prevent these occasional private visits of a vOiisa] rc a neighbouring post developing into re.^ular visits, acquiring an official or semi-official character and perhaps serving a x .iecedeiit for Consuls or Agents of other countries. I confess, however, that I see no line of action that can be taken locaily except to watch carefully for any definitive infringement of our Treaty position. ii possible course woulc. be to bring the terms of our rre^iy inlormallj and verbally to the notice of any Consul, IAno oome c-o Bahrain, so that he would have no excuse for ii'ii Loging o j r position,* out on the whole I feel that it v/ould be x jre±eraole to wait until something is done to justify our drawing attention to the Treaty. x Aould, lio./ever, oe glad of instructions regarding the reply to e given to enquiries by foreign Consular (or Diplomatic) Officers about trade in Bahrain. Our position is not an easy one in the matter of commercial enquiries. On the one nand, it is undesirable to do anything to help the trade of forei o :i nations; one the other hand, the Ruler of Bahrain has entrusted his foreign affairs to us and in our fiduciary capacity it is incumbent upon us to do the best that can be done i cr ^aiirain v ynicn may well at times include encouraging the trade of foreign companies); and it is also possible that unless W0 show a reasonable disposition to help foreign enquirers, our isilare to do so may provide those who wish to attack our fecial position with a useful weapon. S. it is impossible to prevent a foreign Oonsul, who Vi3 its -ahrain, from mating- enquiries about trade, or from /recommencing4. \V recommending' to local merchants tiie goods of his countryj and it is di ticult at present to object to his join^ to the director 01 Customs lor such figures or other information about trade as the Director is in a position to supply to him. I'J. I am inclined, therefore, to suggest tnat it might be sound to puclish the statistics, and perhaps even part of the introduction, now given in the Bahrain Trade Reports in a form in which they can be handed to any foreign Consuls or Liplomatic neprett:-tatives who may asx for them* Any more directly helpful information can be kept separate for the use of our own trade. 11.

Sir &gt; I htxve the honour to refer to your Express Letter No:C/S10 dated the 15th lay 1934 regarding the ill-treatment of Bahrainis in Persia. S. I saw His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin T Isa A1 Khalifah this morning (l5th July) and put up to him the suggestion made in the letter from His Majesty T s Vice-Consul, Mohammerah, No:S/S9/139 dated the 12th February 1934, regarding the adoption of Persian nationality by Bahrainis settled in Persia. His Excellency agreed that it was the most suitable answer which could have been given and he also said that he would still consider as his subjects any Bahrainis who had registered as Persians. 3. Afterwards I saw three Bahrainis of Qusbah named^ Zair *Abood, Saiyid Hadi and Saiyid 'Alawi. These three men had previously seen Captain Chauncey at Ivbhammerah. I repeated his suggestion to them and carefully refrained from expressing any hopes that the matter would be settled quickly, but I suggested to them that in view of the fact that they would not lose their Bahraini status outside Persia and that they would /be15M 2. be relieved of trouble inside Persia, two years 1 military service which their sons would have to undergo might be worth cons idering* 4. They asked me why subjects of King Bin Sa T ud were not treated in the same way as they had been and why they should be considered as Persian subjects and often registered as Persian subjects without their knowledge. Before I replied I found that they knew of the dispute between the British Government and Persia regarding the status of Bahrain. I endeavoured to explain to them the Persian Nationality Law and that their position was made more difficult by this dispute. I am afraid that they did not seem to understand what was meant by a nationality law and they considered that as they v/ere the subjects of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin T Isa A1 Khalifah and under our protection they could not be Persian subjects as well. 5.

I should perhaps explain, with regard to the last sentence of the draft reply enclosed in this despatch # that Hoare has not consulted us on this point in serar^te papers. *lc doubtless felt that to send us the draft for our concurrence was a suificiently clear method of consulting us. 3. The despatch was 01 course written at a tiriie when Hoare still hoped that we would authorise his proposals for taking a strong line with the Persians. Our present policy is, however, to be as unprovocatiwe as Laithwaite, Esq. SENT BY A!r{ MA,L Cm bjjjty. \f&gt;ty 0 ! as posafble. But quite arart trm* this, we feel that it would toe adviauble tu o&amp;it the last paragraph o/ the draft. It aay perhaps be said that we could hardly be &amp;ore unsuccessful than we are at present in our efforts to help Bahrainis in Persia. We are, however, under an obligation to the Sheikh ol ahrain to conduct his relations with foreign countries, including Persia; and when our own current relations witn Persia are fairly good, and someone of goodwill such as Feroughi is at the Persian inistry for Foreign Affairs, a certain ainount of satisfaction - or at least explanation - can occasionally be obtained frona the Persians by seuti- official aethods on questions concerning the interests of the !5heikh. We think, therefore, that it would be a mistake to take the ialtiatiTe in making this impossible tor the future, as would almost certainly be the case if the linal paragraph o: the draft were allowed to remain. 4. Further, though this particular correspondence on^y concerns Bahrain, the Persians might conceivably, wishingwishing to go one better than us, refuse in future to entertain seinl-offIcial representations regarding the alfairs of any 01 the Arab Sheikhs; and we should be in a weak nosltion wis-a-via of our Arab proteges if we had to a din it that, owing to our own act ion» we were no longer in a position to represent their views to the Persian uowemment in any shape or . or^i. 6. Finally it is perhaps worth while pointing out that in this business oi Bahrain nothing is ever quite M on all fours', lor the simple reason that while Persia clalJS Bahrain, Bahrain does not claim ersia. Owing to this lack of syiametry, tu quo que retorts of the kind suggested in the last paragraph oi the draft are never entirely watertight, 6. fc propose, therefore, subject to your concurrence, to tell Hoar# that the letter as drafted can now be sent to o*ta&amp;edl, but with the omission of the last paragraph.

Government of India do not agree with the contention in iragraph 3 of Political Resident's letter thst the Bahrain overnment 1 s proclamation of 1929 infringes the unrestricted grant to s ajesty's Government of jurisdiction over all foreigners# The oclamation operates as a Bahrain nationality law conferring the atus of a Bahrain subject on a person torn in Bahrain to a foreign ther with a right in such person to opt for the foreign nationality ^is father to the exclusion of Bahrain nationality by registering the Agency. No exception can therefore be taken to this perfectly fitimate and normal application of the jus loci, and in view of what in 1929, they agree with Political Resident that there is no c^ssity for the exchange of formal communications between the itioal Agent and the 3haikh of Bahrain as suggested in paragraph 2 Foreign Office letter of the 16th November 1933 WH'— 2 Government of India are however of opinion that in order to implement the mode of opting for Bahrain nationality which was provided in the Proclamation, it was necessary for the haikh to secure from the British authorities an agreement to register persons born in Bahrain to a foreign father who prt^^n.. themselves for registration# The documents of 1929 forwarded by Political Resident show that such agreement was duly secured. -.ince however the agreement was entered into by thf local authorities without reference to higher authority and might theoretically be repudiated by the former without reference to the latter, it might be desirable to issue formal instructions to the local authorities that where registration Is applied for in pursuance of the 1929 arrangements it is not to 'be refused.

In view of the circmnstunces explained in the political Resident's despatch of 13th July 1934, a copy of which was forwarded with India Office printed letter, P.Z.5123/34 of 14th August 1934, Sir Samuel Hoare also agrees with the Government of India tnat there is no necessity for the exchange of formal communications between the Political Agent and the sheikh of Bahrein as suggested in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter, (f No. E 6573/155/91 of 16th November 1933. It would seem sufficient to authorise the Government of India to issue the/ ^ Under secretary of state, foreign Office, S.W. 1.)

As you will remember we asked for Fowle's comments upon the Foreign Office letter No .2.2623/1561/91, dated the 9th May 193 4, a copy of which was forwarded to you and to us 'by the India Office with their endorsement ^ No .P .Z. 3144/34 of 18th May 1934. Fowle* s comments were contained in his Express Letter N0 .66I -S of 19 34, dated the 13th July 19 34, in which he merely suggested that His Majesty's Government could appropriately make representa tions on 'behalf of Bahrainis temporarily resident in Persia, •who seek work as coolies and small shopkeepers. It seems e doubtful whether this is this class, which the Persian Government usually oppress^ and it does not seem to us that Fowle's comraents take us much further. we have 'been considering the matter again in consultation with Prior who spent some years at Bahrain. I enclose for your information a copy of a note which Prior wrote on the subject at my request. As you will see he draws a distinctiondistinction 'between the several classes of Bahrainis affected, which appears to us to he sound. He also suggests the possibility of retaliation on certain lines. I feel extremely doubtful whether in present circumstances His Majesty's Government would he prepared to sanction any action of this kind, since it is clear that for the moment they are all out for maintaining the status quo and avoiding any kind of provocative action against the Persians for fear the latter will turn and rend us over Henjam and Basidu, where they are on very strong ground and could demand our withdrawal, if they wish to he really nasty. Apart however from the question whether any such action is admissible on political grounds, it has also to he considered whether retaliation of the kind suggested hy Prior would he practicable and effective. It is on this i iimim—uniiir — ' — - point that I would like your opinion before we decide whether to make any recommendation in this sense to the India Office. 2. We sftmld also be glad if you would explore further your interesting suggestion for the settlement of 'Persian' Bahrainis on the west side of the Island (presumably in the lands at Budaiyya deserted recently by the Dowasir tribe). No oriental ruler likes to lose subjects* even thoughthoush be uiay dislike them, and, if the Bahrainis had. an alternative of this kind to fall 'back on, the Persians might 1d0 induced to give them hettei* treatment# At the same time this project would enable the Sheikh to meet the complaint of Persian Eahrainis that he was prepared to do nothing for them. The prospect of an improvement in the finances of Bahrain and cf the development of irrigation from artesian wells, seems to offer an excellent opportunity for consideration of a project of this kind, and we shall he glad to hear whether on further review of the details you still think your scheme to 'be practicable. h 3. I may add that so far we have not 'been asked to comment on the Foreign Office letter referred to ahove nor have we seen any reply from the India Office to the Foreign Office. But I imagine that our views will he asked for 'before the India Office reply is sent. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Walton and would suggest that you should also send him a copy of your reply. Hon•hie Lieut.Gol. Gordon Loch, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf»COPY OF NO'IB . )i'H We may divide persons of Bahrain origin in Persia into three categories (1) Those who own landed property, h(2) Bahrainis born in Persia, and (3) those who were born in Bahrain. As regards the first we can do nothing for them and 'there is no objection to telling them so on every possible occasion, nor can there be any difficulty in explaining this to the Shaikh. As regards the second, since Bahrain has now published a proclamation that persons bom in Bahrain of foreign parents would, unless registered in the Agency, be considered as subjects of the Bahrain State, we could, I think, persuade the Sheikh that it is unreasonable to expect us to do anything for Bahrainis born in Persia, since I do not think that these people have any real claim on us. They intend to remain in Persia, they are usually married in Persia ana since they are bom there, Persians have every right to consider them as sons of the soil. It is true that foreigners in Bahrain can register and avoid Bahrain nationality, but the fact remains that Persians do not. ./e are now left with the third category of persons born in Bahrain who genuinely belong to it and for these we must make an attempt to do ^— — Biseee in his Despatch I'o. 23o-S., dated the 5th Llay 19-31 wherein he suggested that we should withdraw the Capitulations irom the Persians in Bahrain and subject them to the local courts. I told Sir Hugh at the time that I tjiougnt his idea was mistaken and that it would hit us more tharj the Persian Government in as much as it would reduce the povver of the Political A^'ent over an important section of the community, and that it was impracticable in that most of the Persians in Bahrain spoke only Persian and could not be subjected to courts whose officers spoke nothing but Arabic. I also pointed out that since t-he act ci with drawing Capitulations could only take place once, it would nave only a temDorary effect and that once trie Persians had forgottenforgotten about its effect would be lost. I suggested, on the other hand, that in allowing the Pahlavi cap, a visible sign of modern Persia, and Persian schools (even one subsidised irorn Persia) in Bahrain, we were allowing a valuable concession that Persians would never tolerate in their territory and which would affect their pride deeply if withdrawn. It must be remembered that the Persian Government have few scruples concerning their subjects and care little Jferf what loss they cause them in supporting their^pride. In fact in cutting off their nose to spite their face, they are past masters. They would not, therefore, worry very much about retaliation that only aifected their ressortissants pockets, but retaliation that effected their national pride would make them squirm. Moreover, such retaliation would be a continuous one and every Pahlyi cap removed would be a fresh reminder of the Sheikh's power over their nationals in Bahrain. Sir Hugh, however, disagreed with my views and did not forward my despatches and his own suggestion was abandoned, I think quite rightly, on the ground that it would do us more harm than good. &lt;3 1 would suggest therefore that we sho uld not aoandon the possibility of retaliation.. We should allow the biieiKh to say thatTf Bahrain subjects in Persia with Bahrain nationality papers (we would understand this as referring only to persons of the third category) were molested he Y/ould consider the withdrawal of the privilege of allowing Persians to maintain separate schools in Bahrain and also that he would abolish the^Pahlavi cap as an emblem which had become intolerable to him. I- this was conveyed to the Persian Government at the rirdit rnoLieut, it would, I think, have a decided effect, for they know thai; tney are powerless to interfere in what happens in Bahrain. If tne persecution continued, the schools (which are a contounded nuisance) could be closed one by one anc. the question ol uiie Pahlavi cap could be taken up later. I think t faatjbhe se t wo, and particularly the Pahlavi cag, would have a real effect on the Persian Government and if the Minister were to drop a hint lo this effect verbally it would be possible to gauge its eilect without having to put it into writing and so enable us to resile from the position if we found that the weapon was likely to be useless. In dealing with Persians their pride must never be lost1^0 lost sight of, ani sense recognised as only a subsidiary factor in their composition. To sura up - J-| , (1) v .e admit tnt.t v;e csn do notninr; for Bahrain is with landed property. There is no objection to telling both them and the Shaikh of this. (2) We must get round the clash between our normal obligation to protect the children of British protected subjects andTthe provision of the Persian Nationality law mentioned in sections 4 and 5 of paragraph 5 of the^Foreign Office letter by explaining to the Shaikh that we have accepted this position for our own subjects end that moreover the new proclamation in Bahrain has much the same effect. We should also explain that since Bahrainis bom in Persia have obviously every intention of remaining there it is in their own interest to accept Persian nationality, though they would still be entitled to Bahrain nationality should they ever return to Bahrein. I see no objection to the Consul at Mohammerah explainin, their position under the Persian nationality law to Bahrainis and advising them privately to accept Persian nationality under protest. (3) we must make a genuine attempt to protect • Bahrainis born in Bahrain and 'threaten retaliation if our claim to do this is not admitted. (4) We should make no public announcement of our policy regarding those mentioned in (2) and if retaliation shows itself to be a successful weapon, we should extend our protection to border line cases in this category.

Doubtless these| as pointed out by Prior in paragraph 2 of his note, would make the Persian Government ''squirm' 1 , but that - though it would give me great pleasure - is not our main object, (see paragraph 2 above). and Honourable Mr. H .A.F .M etcalfe, C .S .1 •, C«X.£«9 M.V.O., \ Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi»- ? - ! y and. I do notr nQrsaLf s«e the Persian Government, giving better treatment to Bahrainis in Persia merely because the Bahrain Government forced Persians in Bahrain to abandon the Pahlavi cap» Moreover (a) suffers under the following disadvantage. No government in the world, as far as I know, forbids foreigners wearing what clothes and head-dress they fancy^ What the Persian Government, for instance, does in Persia is to order Persian subjects to wear a certain sort of cap» For the Shaikh of Bahrain to be in a plausible position to legislate on the subject of the head-dress of Bahraini Persians, such individuals would have to be considered Bahraini subjects, and put under the jurisdiction of the 3haikh, but this is what Prior, in paragraph 2 of his note, is strongly against# 5* / With regard to (b). I am not of opinion that the Bahrain Government would have a good case in taking the drastic step of closing the Persian schools* What they could do ( and have for some time been considering), not as a measure of retaliation but as one of administrative convenience| and for various political reasons, would be to ■v put such schools under the control of their Department of Education* At present the Persian schools are under no such control# I have discussed the matter with Loch and will address you separately on the subject in due course# With regard to a proposal of Biscoe that we should withdraw the Capitulations from the Bahraini Persians and I ' Vsubject them to the local Courts, which Prior mentions in v / ■ s ,y , paragraph 2 of his Note, but of which he was not in favour® I do not think this idea is impracticable for the reason that Prior gives: that most Persians in Bahrain speak only Persian and could not be subjected to Courts whose officers speak nothing but Arabic^ All over the world foreigners are-3- Ho V at a d is advantage from the language point of view when appearing in local Courts, vdiich difficulties they get over as best they can - by the use of interpreters, for instance and in any case whatever inconvenience that Persian Baijrainis might suffer in their appearances in the Bahrain Courts is not a matter which need worry us# Moreover, an increasing number of local Persians know sufficient Arabic for practical purposes# 7# I agree, however, with Prior that there would probably be disadvantages in handing over the Persian subjects en bloc to the Shaikh, and even if we were to threaten to do so, I do not think that it would achieve the object cdf getting better treatment for Bahrainis in Persia# In connection with Biscoe^ proposal one must remember that it is now generally agreed - vide correspondence ending with ^ India Office letter No#P#Z#6811/34 of 6th October 1934 to the Foreign Office - that it would be a good thing to allow the Persians in Bahrain to come gradually under the Shaikh's jurisdiction*. 8# There is another measure of retaliation: that suggested by Loch and referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter# I discussed this with Loch and he is going to examine the question farther and la t me have his opinion# Here again, however, I doubt whether the action suggested would force the Persian Government to tr«at the Eahrainis any r better, though the scheme initself has, at any rate from the Shaikh 1 s point of view, a good deal to recommend it# 9# The following general consideration has also to be borne in mind# The best kind of retaliation from our point / of view would be one which could be turned off and on at ; will# That is to say the Persian Govexnment would be induced f/ / t ; i : n to become reasonable b&gt; the knowledge that when they ceased their objectionable conduct we would likewise cease being objectionable4 objtctionabl# to th«m. But all the above suggested retal iations (as prior quit® truly points out with regard to the particular one of the withdrawal of Capitulations) can only be done once» We could only intimate to the Persian Government, in whatever way was thought desirable, that if they did not cease their ill-treatment of Bahrainis, the Bahrain Government would take such and such measures® If the Persian Government did not respond to these threats, whicl personally I do not think they would f the Bahrain Government would then have to put tnem into force, and having done this could hold out no further inducement to the Persian Government that the measures would be relaxed if the Persian Government ceased their ill-treatment of Bahrainis• 10* What is wanted is some form of suitable retaliatioi which does not iliffer under the disadvantages explained above^ The only one I can think of is that the Shaikh should issue a proclamation prohibiting ownership of land in Bahrain by Persians and ordering that Persians who already own land in Bahrain tap will be allowed a period of, say, two years, within which to acquire Bahrain nationality, or, if they do not wish to become Bahrain subjects, to dispose of their property. This follows the measures taken by the Persian Government prohibiting the ownership of land by foreign nationals, appears to be a form of retaliation suited to the case, and generally makes the punishment fit the crime# If at any time the Persians ceased their ill-treatment oi s Bahrainis - which they are not likely to - the measure could be relaxed. There may, however, be practical objections to the introduction of such a measure, and I shall address you further on this point* 11 # if we assume that retaliations are out of the question, the only action which we can take on behali o- Bahrainis are protests# As pointed out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of my Express Letter No»661 -S of 13th July ^934^ certain assumptions which of recent years had been made in connect ion- 5 - ion with the qutstion of ill-treatment of Bahrainis in ersia, seem to have been controverted by the Foreign Off ice - vide their letter of 9th May, No •£•2633 /1616/91, and in articular the assumption that His Majesty's Government are legally justified in espousing the cause of Bahrainis in general, this change having been brought about by the introduction of the Per sian Nationality Law* In para graph 6 of my Express Letter quoted above, I gave the opinion, however, that there was still a certain class of Bahrainis with regard to whom His Majesty's Government's position was not affected by the Nationality Law, and it is on behalf of these, and these only, that it sedns to me His Majesty's Government can protest* 12* Protests in general 9 as we all know, have remarkably little effect on the Persian Government , and I have little hope that any protests made on behalf of the class of Bahrainis in question, will oroduce results. The position is of course humilating to His Majesty's Government and galling to Shaikh Hamad (vide the last sent ence of paragraph 7 of my letter No.2 T)» 13 • tfith regard to what we should say to the Shaikh. We should explain to him that there are four classes of * Bahrainis concerned# (1) Bahrainis bom in Persia who own landed property there* (2) Bahrainis born in Bahrain who own landed property in Persia. (3) Bahrainis born in Persia who do not own landed property there* (4) Bahrainis born in Bahrain who do not own landed property in i-ersia but are employed there in casual occupation, such as shopkeepers, coolies etc r We could go on to explain as follows^ With regard to (1) we can do nothing by reason of the Persian Nationality Law and «ven if these individu als f• 6 - \\^ als gav« up tneir land th#y would still remain Persians. With regard to (2) that if these individuals gave up their land they are in the same juridical position as (4). With regard to (3) these are Persian subjects under the Persian Nationality Law* With regard to (4) these are the only class of EcJirainis on whose behalf His Majesty^ Government can take any action, such action being limited to protests# (Unless His Majesty's Government decide on a policy of retaliation) I am sending copies of this letter to Walton and Loch.CONFIDENTIAL, No. C -309 of 1934.

Sir I have the honour to enclose a copy of a Memorandum ffotCl 8 /vS .F dated the 14th Sha'ban 1353 (2Snd November 1934) from the adviser to the &gt;ahraln Government, regarding a statement by caiylc ashim bin aiyld Husain of Senabis in Bahrain that the Ptr,«isn liovernment have ordered him (among others) to hand in his passport and to register himself as a Persian subject. 1 have informed the Adviser that he had better advise the man as from himself, if he presses for advice, to hand in his passport under protest, if the Persian Government insist upon it, and to let him (the Adviser) know immediately if his passport is taken. Saiyid Hashim can do this through indirect channels. I understand that Saiyid Hashim has only a 'barasti' or small hut and that he was born in Bahrain and carries on petty trade in Mohammerah. I am not clear whether the ownership of this 'barasti*' brings him under the Persian Nationality Law in respect property, but at first sight he would appear to be one of the category of persons for whom it may be possible to make a protest. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Vice-Consui at /MohammerahCbpy of ''emorandun; No:618/S.F dated the 14th Sha'ban 1S53 (SP.nd November 1934) from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, to the Political ^gent, Bahrain. I am informed by Saiyid Hashim bin Saiyid Husain, of ^••enabis in -ahrain, resident 18 years in ^ohammerah, where he ovats a small house only, in which he lives, that he and all otner Bfihrain subjects have received written orders to hand in their Bahrain Passports and to register themselves as Persian subjects. This order is issued by the Persian Passport Officer of Moha mmerah, S. Calyid Hashim holds a Bahrain passport which was Issued to him four years ago. He Is well known to the British Consul In ^ohammerah and recently supplied Information to the British Consul regarding number of Bahrain subjects In 'fohammerah, 3. He enquires whether he should hand In his Bahrain passport, as ordered to do or refuse to obey this order. He 1 i£;;es to leave on Saturday. Could you Infirm me what advice I should give him.I have the honour to report that two Bahrain!s presented themselves before me a few days ago. They stated that they were merchants living in Mohammerah. Both were in possession of Bahrain passports. They had been instructed by the Persian authorities to take out Persian Nationality papers and had replied that they were foreigners and in possession of foreign passports. They, were, accordingly, requested to produce their passports for inspection. Before doing so they decided to approach me and ask my adviceas thay wished to know what to do in the event of their passports being confiscated. The present Governor of Abadan has only recently been appointed. I seized the opportunity therefore of approaching him on the whole question by sending the passports under a cohering letter from this office asking for their return when inspected by the officials concerned. I sent my Interpreter with my lecter^ and the passports to the Governor and instructed him to explain all tne troubles of the past and the situation in general, and told him to say that was only sending the passports myself to ensure that the Bahrainis did not try to create trouble by throwing the passports away themselves. ( I actually suspect certain persons of doing this or at any rate persons who never have had documents of saying that they have been confiscated). ^esty f s Consul for ^huzistan. Copy forwarded to S/S for India, Govt, of India and ^.A.,Bahrain, unab 13 us hire P.L.No .59—S, 11.1.35.The Governor sent for the official of the Sijil i^hwal Department and instructed him not to confiscate such documents but to i^sue the Persian 'oijil' and allow these individuals of dual nationality to carry both documents . He explained that Bahrain claimed to be independent while ?ersia claimed Bahrain and that until this question was settled all ^ahrainis in Persia must have 'Sijil^ but that they could also kee) their Bahrain documents so that when the time came Lhey could establish their identity as Persians or Bahrain!s as the case might be. XA e sent his kindest regards to me and informed me that this was the manner in which he proposed to deal with the problem. 1 sent a reply to the effect that we werr giving the same advice to the Bahrainis and that if he could make the Sijil Department keep to this.arrangement we might consider the matter closed as far as he and I were concerned I think- that instructions must have come through at last and that the Bahrainis will be molested no longer provided they do not resist taking out Persian papers. &lt;¥hile the Bahrainis themselves are beginning to take more kindly to our advice now that they understand that they have to choose between conscription and losing their property. As a matter of interest i woula also report that I discussed the subject with my Iraq colleague. He informed Hie that he is having the same trouble over certain persons living in Mohammerah who claim to be Iraqis whilst^ the Per ians claim them to be Persians. He maintains that all of these are simply trying to avoid conscription. They visit Iraq and get a few friends to vouch for them and obtain Iraqi passports and then return to Persia, and try to evade conscription on the grounds that they are Iraq subjects. Their passports are then seized and they complain to the ^•raq Consul. However the Iraq Government is shortly passing a law for conscription and the Iraq Consul does not\11 contemplate any further trouble• There can be no doubt that many of the persons claiming to be Bahrainis are playing the same gamF| whilst even the real ^ahralnis .»ould. probably give up their claim to Bahrain nationality if there was conscription in Bahrain, 1 am convinced that there is no question of any of them giving up their property or interests in Persia to return to Bahrain even without conscription, bo long therelore ^ chey are not molested 1 can see no useful purpose in trying to do anything further for these so-called Bahrain!who wixl certainly not take Bahrain nationality unless they can keep their property. In fact to satisfy them it would be^neceosary to change the Persian ^aw regarding the holding of property yjy foreigners than to establish Bahrain's independence in the eyes of Persia. 1 am sending a copy of* this despatch to nu^hire.

I fear that we have not made it clear that it is on the wider question of the Bahreinis in Persia that we are awaiting the Government of India's views in the light n fj of their further consultation with Powle (see my letter to you of 19th October, P. Z.5678/34). As regards Motamedi's note of 15th May last about Persians in Bahrein, we are inclined, on the whole now, to think that unless the Foreign Office see objection, the best plan would be to return no reply to the Persians unless they revert to the matter both in view of the lapse of time and on the ground suggested by Loch in his letter of 17th July to Tehran S' (copy/ :ggallay Esq., ign Office, . W. 1.(copy enclosed in our printed letter No.P.Z.5125/34, of 10th August) that it would 'be preferable to avoid entering into any discussion of local affairs in Bahrein with the Persians if it is possible to avoid doing so. Perhaps you could let me know whether the Foreign Office agree? j, G. LAITHV. .H E.3, The Socretary of State is disposed prima facie to think that in the circumstances discussed in the Foreign Office letter of 16th 'November there might bo some advantage both in the preparation of a definite nationality law for Bahrein (and possibly also Koweit) and in a revision of the Bahrein Order in Council on the lines suggested. Such a nationality law would presumably take the form of a proclamation or decree issued by the Sheikh expressly and in terms as a nationality law; and would //include a provision on the lines of the Sheikh of Bahrein's proclamation of 19 29, and a further provision that the descendants of Bahreinis born abroad for one or perhaps two generations should be considered as Bahrein subjects. Before considering the matter further he would, however, I be glad to be favoured with the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident both on the question generally and in particular on the probable reaction of the Sheikh of Bahrein (and the Sheikh of Koweit, if it was thought- desirable to approach His Excellency with a view to the preparation of a nationality lav: in respect of his State) towards action on these lines. Should the Government of India and the Resident see advantage in such action, and should they anticipate no difficulty with the Rulers in question, the Secretary of State would then propose to arrange, in collaboration with the Foreign Office, for the preparation of drafts of a brief nationality law and of a redraft of the Bahrein Order in Council, the texts of which would bo communicated to India and to the Gulf for examination locally. 4./ Ml3. 4, Copy of this letter is being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Vhilo, however, r.lr John Imon X b prepared to accept the view put forward by the Oovema^i of India in paragraph 2 of their express letter Ho. P 118 11/35 of the 3rd Qeptenber to the India Office that the &gt;helich f 8 jjroclajaation Of 1929 9 which was reissued in 1933, to the effect that persons bom in Bahrain of forei.^i parents shall be conftidered as subjects of the Bahmin state unless registered at the Political Agency, should be regarded as a Bahrain nationality law, he considers that it would nevertheless be r 1 more satisfactory if this proclamation were to be iSBued expressly and in terms as a nationality law so that there could be no doubt as to its character. It appears to hia desirable for other reasons also that Bahrain and other similar protected ctates should have definite nationality laws in a reasonably coisplete foria. Bahrainie are to be found in other parts of the world, many of them have children,/ Secretary of State, a office.children born there, and their right to British protection depends on whether they possesB Bahrain nationality. It is quite undefined at the moment to what extent Bahrain nationality wist be held to be retained in the case of persons born abroad. 5. There is one further point arising out of this correspondence to which Sir John Simon wishes to Invite the attention of Blr ^euauel Hoare. It appears to have been assumed by the Political Resident and by the Government of India that the present jurisdiction exercised by His Majesty's Government over foreigners in Bahrain rests upon Uheikh Isa's letter of the 16th July, 1909. 3ir John Simon feels some doubt as to whether this is in fact so# It is c$xite true that in that letter aheikh lea requested that His Majesty's Oovernment M should exercise authority in all cases in which w tho foreigners only are concemedf but not in other cases • ^ Sir Samuel Uoare is aware, however, in 1912 the Sheikh explained that he did not Intend to include in the designation ,, forei£nerB H the dependents of petty Arab potentates in the Persian Oulf, a condition which was eventually accepted by His Majesty's Government in 1919 • How, under Article 8 of the Bahrain Order in Council of 1913, the Political Agent aas given jurisdiction over, inter alios , ^foreigners with respect 'to whom the oheikh has agreed with His Majesty for, or 'consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His ajesty It would appear, therefore, that immediately subsequent to His Majesty's Governn^ent*s acceptance of the heikh's explanation in 1919 the position was that the Political Agent could not exercise jurisdiction over all foreigners, since His/Hie Majesty' s Government had agreed with the JheUch to except from that term the aubjeote of the Arah rulers referred to above. In praotloe f however f this arrangement proved unworkable, notably in regard to Hejdie, and in 1980 it proved &lt; necessary, without the Sheikh T a consent, to issue a notice announcing that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of /rab rulers and Chiefs, other than those of Bahrain, were, while in Bahrain, entitled to British protection* There thus resulted a position in which His Majesty's Government, in apparent conflict with Article 3 of the Bahrain Order in Council of 1913, were claiming jurisdiction over certain foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh had not consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by ■lis Majesty. But this anomalous position may perhaps be regarded as having lasted only during the brief remainder of Sheikh Isa*s rule. The present Sheikh, Sheikh Hamad, has never, so far as sir John Simon is aware, demurred to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Political Agent over all the foreigners in danrain, nor to the terms of the 1980 notice establishing that jurisdiction, even though he may not specifically have agreed with His Majesty's Government for the exercise of such juriadiction. strictly speaking therefore, the position appears to be that the present jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government over all foreigners in Bahrain resta not on Shaikh lea's letter of 1909, but on the Political Agent's notice of 1920, as subsequently accepted, or not demurred to by the present &gt;heikh of Bahrain. 4« The point is perhaps an academic one in relation to the present ease. Nevertheless it will be seen from the fore fto ing/vA foregoing review tliat the poeltion wltii regard to ^url edict Ion over foreignere under the existing Bahrain Order in Council is too uncertain and Indefinite to be satisfactory at the preoent tiiae with the development of the Bahrain oil concession and of the Arab coast air route, when the presence of an increasing number of foreigners in Bahrain is to be expected, and it is particularly desirable that there should be no question about the jaatter of jurisdiction. The Bahrain Order in Council in its present forn maices the jurisdiction of the British courts depend upon the agreement of the aheilch, and the aheikh's agreenont to the jurisdiction which Ulo Majesty's Government at present actually clala is left rather as a matter of inference. Sir John Simon would suggest, therefore, for the consideration of i^ir amuel lioare, that the Bahrain Order in Jouncil should be amended on the sano lines as the recent draft Kov/eit Order in Council, and that the order itself should specify in teraa who are the persons who arc subject to the jurisdiction of the court; and that as in the case of the :.oweit Order, the assent of the sheikh should be obtained to the terms of the Order in Council as revised. In this connexion Sir Bamel Hoare will recall that, when the revision of tho Koweit order in Council in respect of this point was undertaken, that Order v/as found to be out of date and unsatisfactory in many other respects, and nearly all the criticisms of the fomer Kov/eit urder in Council apply also to the existing aohrain order. Sir John Jimon would, thereft** suggest further that, if the proposal to revise those provisions of the Bahrain order in Council which deal with the/the ^url edict ion of the Agency courts over foreignere in Bahrain is accepted by Sir amuel rtoare, the opportunity might be taken to nake a thorou^i revision of that order on the lines of the new Koweit Order in Council • X am, sir, Your obedient Jorrant, (ScU 0.

Is the Agency notification No.180 of 27th February 1929 being strictly applied i.e. are cases in which foreigners born in Bahrain are involved admitted in the Agency Courts only if such foreigners have registered in the Agency ? 2. Proposed Bahrain Nationality Law. (a) There would appear to be advantage in this. For one thing it would stress the independence of Bahrain. (b) Minors would have to be allowed a period of,say, one year from attainment of majority to elect whether they will retain their foreign nationality by registration in the Agency or lose their status » as foreigners by not registering within that period. (c) Those who have attained majority at the time of promulgation of the law would have to be allowed, say, a similar period in which to make their decision. (d) The danger from (c) is that it would lead to registration en masse of foreigners (we are chiefly concerned with the large number of Persians) of those falling under that class. (e) One way of preventing this is by the Bahrain Government at the same time passing a law prohibiting foreigners whose Governments prohibit the ownership of real property by foreigners from owning land in Bahrain. This would mean that Persians in Bahrain(with whom we are chiefly concerned) would have to choose between continuing /-2- ji 2 - continuing their Persian nationality and part ing with their property. Persians of substance are r&amp;ssx likely to cling to their proper ty tuaii their nationality. British subjects, British Indian subjects (several 01 whom presumably own property in Bahrain) and the other foreigners, whose governments allow the posses sion of land by foreigners^ would not be affected, and the measure being reciprocal could not easily be attacked. i iP.Z . /j'9 19^ INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Z5 .IAN t tm ~ Forwarded with the coinpliiueuts of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

My dear Metcalfe, INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, S. W. 1. 20th October 1934. - I write with reference to your demi-official ^( F.101-N/34, of 18th September to Loch about the ill 1 L \ treatment of Bahreinis in Persia. We were anxious in the first place to ascertain Fowle's views on the situation generally and we now propose to postpone a reply to the Foreign Office letter of 9th May until we have the corrments of the Government of India and any further observations which Loch may make in reply to your letter of 18th September. We should, however, be grateful if v/e rai^t have these in the near future. 2. Our own provisional view at this stage is that, in the light of the legal position as described in Foreign Office letter of 9th Lay, we can do nothing for Bahreinis enjoy Persian nationality under the Persian Nationality Law. This probably covers the great bulk of the Bahreinis in Persia. In the case of a Bahreini who is not in fact covered by the provisions of the Nationality Law and who is the victim of an incident, it will of course remain open to us to maKe a protest, and it ma/ on general political grounds be desirable that we should do 30, even thci^i in practice the chances of securing adequate reparation from the Persians are probably relatively small. But on this point, as well as on the question generally, we should welccme the observations of the government of India. 3. I mate no cement at this stage on the 3 irg ^stiona r-ut forward in Prior's very interesting note. Fc//le did mention wr.ile he was here that the Persian schcols in Batrala^ which he 0a ¥e is to understand were centres of disaffection, were not onder the control cf the Bahrein Education Author!t/, and triat the yacie is tr&gt;ie of the schools controlled by the African missionaries. There seer-ss a deal tc be said for remedy n* tais state of thingsthings so far as the Persians are concerned, thoagh if we were to bring them under the control of the Bahrein Education Authority it would, of course, be necessary to do the same for the Americans. Bui action on these lines ought, on the face of it, to be easy to justify on rener 1 .^ro rriis, either to the Persians or to the United States Government. This point might, therefore, perhaps be considered in connection with the general question. Yours sincerely, 3d/- J. G. walton. The Hon'ble l r r. H.A.F.

You will have seen Fowled comments contained in his demi-official letter No. 308-G of 1934, dated the 17th November 1934, of which a copy was sent to you. We all now appear to be in general agreement that nothing effectual can be done on behalf of Bahrainis who have acquired Persian nationality by virtue of the Persian Nationality Law, and that our efforts must be confined mainly to protests on behalf of casual Bahrainis who were bom in Bahrain and not in Persia and own no land, nor have any permanent interests in Persia. It is probable that these protests will not have much effect unless some form of retaliatory action can be taken. As you will see, Fowle does not approve Prior's suggestion regarding Pahlavi caps and in this we feel bound to agree with him. The other proposal for bringing Persian Schools under the control of Bahrain Educational authority appears to be desirable on administrative grounds apart from its effect as a measure of retaliation; Fowle is however still examining the practical implications of ttiis and also of the proposal to settle Bahrainis. who wish to leave Persia, on the west side of the Island. Fowle's own suggestion in paragraph 10 of lb*' his letter would seem to imply a measure of discrimination against- 2 - p- t'T against Persians as such, unless the Bahrain Government were to make a similar prohibition against ownership of land by any foreigner. For that reason it seems to us objectionable and could hardly be defended against Persian protest, 2. I am afraid that the net result of all this is to leave us very much as we were before, but we have just received a copy of a Mohammerah Despatch No. 1002, dated the 23rd December 1934 (copy sent to you with the Political Resident's printed letter No. 59-3 of 1935, dated the 11th January 1935) which suggests that at Abadan at any rate where most of the trouble has arisen in the past the Persian authorities are likely to take a more reasonable view than they have done in the past. It may therefore be hoped that our protests have had some effect and that in future it will be unnecessary to continue such protests. I am sending a copy of this letter to Powle.

With reference to Foreign and .political Departaient iiixpress Utter NO .D .321 -H /36, dated the 6th February 1936, requesting my views on paragraphs 2 and 3 ol Inaia Office letter ^ o.P.^.7u^^/o4, dated the 3rd January 1936. 2. With regard to paragraph 2 (b) of the India Oiiice letter. I am dealing with this later in a separate communication. 3. With regard to paragraph 2 (a) of the Inula Oil ice letter. I am generally in favour of the proposal of a Proclamation of a Bahrain Nationality Law by the Bahrain Government, and suggest that the terms might be to the following eifect: (1) / « * ocfp- l|6^4p-=imj821)--27-9-^~2.ft ( k000(1) a Notification that persons born in Bahrain or foreign parents unless registered at the agency will be considered for all purposes as subjects of the Bahrain State• (2) That the descendents of Bahrainis born abroad for two generations should be considered as Bahrain subjects. (3) Minors to be allowed a period of one year from attainment of majority to elect whether they would retain their foreign nationality by registration in the Agency, or lose their status as foreigners by not registering within that period. (4) Those who had attained majority at the time ol promulgation of the Law to be allowed a similar period from the date of promulgation in which to make their decision# (5) Foreigners whose Governments prohibited the ownership of real property by foreigners in the countries of those Governments to be prohibited owning land and property in Bahrain except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft. 4. Clauses (1) and (2) are those suggested in paragraph 3 of India Office letter quoted above. 6. The reasons for (6) are two-fold: (a) to meet the danger under (4) of registration en masse by Persians who on the issue of the Nationality Law would certainly prefer to come under the vgency as foreigners than under the Bahrain Government. Under (6) Persians would have to choose between continuing their Persian nationality ana parting with their property, and those of substance are more likely to cling to their property than to their nationality. (b). To give the Bahrain Government some much needed satisfaction in treating Persian subjects in Bahrain exactly the /{jfft OeK vfM the sanxe - with regard to property *• as Bahrain subjects are treated in Persia• In this connection it may be noted that clause (6) is less drastic than the rersian law since it. does not force foreigners who wish to retain their status as such to leave the country. 6. To pursue the analogy of (6)j in principle there would appear to be nothing to prevent the Government 01 India promulgating a similar law which would present Persians owning property in India in the same way that British Indian subjects are not allowed to own property in Persia, This is, however, a matter which is outside the scope of this letter. 7. British subjects, British Indian subjects, Americans, and other foreigners, whose Governments allowed the possession of land by foreigners, would not be affected, anu the measure vis a vis the Persian Government being reciprocal could easily be defended. Saudi subjects might be affected but 1 am not clear what the Saudi Government law is on the subject oi foreigners owning property. 8. Clause (6) would not of course affect Persians who do not own property, and who are of course in the majority, ana there would be the possibility of these registering efi masse at the Agency, while I think it is generally agreed (vide 0 paragraph 7 of my letter No.308-C of 17th November 1934) that it would be a good thing for Bahrain! Persians gradually to come unaer the authority of the Shaikh. To prevent such mass registration it would be feasible to increase the registration fee over that of Re.l/- per annum which is required from British Indian subjects. In principle there would appear to be no objection to this administrative measure since the Agency is kept up by His Majesty's Government for the benefit of British and British Indian subjects and not foreigners. The /Jc-*] -4- The most important foreigners other than iersians are the Americans, -nd their registration would hardly arise in a practical torm owing to their small numbers• 9, With reference to paragraph 3 of your Express Letter jro No.F#118-N/33, dated the 6th February 1935. In view of the considerations advanced in paragraph 6 above, as to the danger of mass registration by Persians, pending further orders from Government I am not issuing to the -olitical agent Bahrain the formal instructions referred to but am instructing him to report to me before registration should there be any noticeable increase in the number of applicants. The present position is that applicants are not refused but they are very lew in number. 10. tfhen the proposal for a Nationality Law is put beiore the Shaikh of Bahrain, he will, of course, coixsult his iamily, with the inevitable result that the proposal will probaoly become public property. The possibility of mass registration, perhaps of thousands of Persians, will then arise during the interval between discussion of the proposal and its being actually promulgated as law. To meet this, which would largely defeat the object of the law, the Political Agent would have to be instructed to refuse registration. sd. T.C.Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel.

It has 'been observed that the object of the provisions of the Regulations concemin^ the possession of landed property in the I'ejaz issued on 29th Juaad -ath-Thani 1353 (October 8th 1934) has been misinterpreted. The Grovemuent therefore find it necessary to explain its object and scope and to define its mode of application. 1. Hie fundamental reason which caused the Government to prohibit foreigners from possessing landed properties in the He jaz was the establishment of a position which has continued to be respected from the be^innin^ of Islam and the observance of the rules of the holy shari'a, so as to put the Islamic holy country in a position of security against its passing into the hands of foreigners. Consequently the districts that come under the provisions of the said Regulations are the territories of the Hejaz within its boundaries as recognised by the holy ghari t a; but» in the territories of His Majesty the King, other than the Hejaz, the freedom of possessing landed properties by foreigners is not governed by the provisions of the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property in trie Tr ejaz. 2. In addition to the facilities allowed to foreigners under the provisions of the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property, as regards their ability to dedicate the landed property for perpetual charitable..,.' 2 '' C, (2.2J/ charitable purpose, the (xoveminent of His Majesty the King con template giving consideration to a proposal for a regulation enabling the foreign 1'uslims to secure the enjoyment of Government landed properties located in the areas 'where it is prohibited for foreigners to possess landed properties, that is tiy way of long lease and other proper Shari'a, means, 3. In as much as many individuals, vJio were Ottoman subjects, have gtxa possessed, during the time of the Ottoman Government landed properties in the Eejaz, as there was no prohibition except in case of non-Ottomans of that time, and others have like-wise possessed some landed properties in the time of the Kaehimite Government; and, as immediately after the decline of the Ottoman Government many of the landlorrds have become foreigners under the Law of Nationality of Sa , udi Arabia; and as the Government of Eis Majesty do not desire to make the provisions of the new Regulations retroactive; as they do not desire to deprive those people, who acquired (their properties) by legal ways, of their legal rights acquired under the provisions of Regulations duly observed during the time of the Ottoman and the Hashimite Governments, the Government of His Majesty have assured to such persons the freedom of enjoying the landed properties belonging to them in a legal way under Article XI of the said # Regulation. The Government declare that they accord to such persons the right to apply for extension of their enjoyment of their landed properties provided they apply for the same. 13th Shawwal 1353.

The bulk of the correspondence relates to reports that Bahrain nationals resident in Gusba in Persia were being forced by the Persian government to forego their Bahraini nationality and adopt Persian nationality. The reports include details of Bahrainis being imprisoned, physically attacked and forced to give up their Bahraini nationality. The file contains a number of petitions to Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa from Bahraini subjects resident in Persia. An appropriate reaction by the British authorities in Bahrain is discussed at length as are broader issues related to a draft Bahrain nationality law. Measures proposed (but not enforced) by British officials include banning the Pahlavi Cap being worn by Persians resident in Bahrain and the closure of Persian schools in the country. It is declared that any person born in Bahrain of foreign parents – unless registered at the Agency – shall be considered as subjects of the Bahrain state.The file also includes information regarding a visit to Bahrain by the French Consul at Bushire and matters related to land ownership in the Hejaz.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gusba</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Resistance to oppression</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000129#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
