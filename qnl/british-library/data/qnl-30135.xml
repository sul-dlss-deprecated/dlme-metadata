Kuwait- Haifa Commercial Motor Route. From To .Previous number© Secret. The Residency, Buahire, the 5th February 1937. D.O.No.175-S. dould you please refer to India Oft ice endorsement No. P.Z.9098/36 on letter No.CF/676/36 of the 19th November 1936 from the Secretariat, High Commission for Palestine, to the Colonial Office, on the subject of a possible Kuwait - Haifa commercial motor route. 2. For the reasons ^iven in paragraph 6 et aeq below I think perhaps it might be convenient to link this subject up with that of the defence of the Gulf in tiae of war f dealt with in ray demi-official letter No.82-3 of the 18th January 193/ to Metcalfe, copy sent to 'alton under my Printed letter Ho•83-S of same date. 3. As you are aware the idea of the route in question was first raised by de Gaury last iluianer. His general idea was that it might be possible to open up a route as follows* Kuwait• Hafr-al-Batin, Saudi Arab frontier fort. /ater. Uram-ar-Radhurama, Saudi Arab fort is being built. Wat er. Lina, Saudi Arab fort is being built. /ater. Birkat-aoh-Shaihiya. /ater. Junction with the Nejef-Hail “pilgrim* route. Hazoul. /ater. Jauf, Saudi Arab provincial centre, wireless, water etc. Vadi sirhan, villages, water. Azraq, Transjordan frontier post. Yater. Thence to Amman for Palestine or northwards for Syria by well-used roads. It will be seen that the route as routes i t j go / M.J.Clausen Ssquire, The India Office, London.7. / - 2 - go in Arabia, ten a fairly goo! water supply, an important consicieration. It would traverue the temtuiies of three ^ States: Kurfait, Saudi Arabia and Palestine (Transjordan,. 4. Nothing concrete could come of this scheme until we ted a report on the route, and de Saury suggested that he should notor over it with this object in view. I backed the proposal (de Saury has had canal terable expedience of this aort of vvo^k) , but oving to the troiblea in Palestine the scheme was dropped for the time being. .hen quieter conditions prevailed it was again put on the tapis. 5. The route, if it ever came into being, woul af-iec*. ^ransjordan and Palestine, and the Palestine letter quoted above indicates that the reaction of tne Palestinian and Transjordanian Authorities to the scheme ia fer from favourable, briefly, these Authorities are of opinion that such a route would adversely affect Palestinian and Transjordanian trade in various ways. If this view is accepted by the Colonial Office, and it certainly seems to me that strong arguments have been adduced, then as far as I aa concerned 1 em content to let the subject drop as a comneroial one. 6. There is, however, the strete ;ical aspect. Prom Palestine - Transjordan the present air route (both for Imperial Airways and 'loyal Air Force machines), and the motor route, runs to Bagdad, and the air route then runs Basra, Kuwait, etc. probably, for various reasons, this will always remain the main route both for Civil and Boyal Ur Force machines. 1 can imagine circumstances, however, 'fhen in an emergency an alternative direct air route Palestine - Kuwait, as indicated by de Caury, might be very useful - if practicable.0 3 * of s ich a route, or part of it, by a mechanised force, mi^ht be desirable. Royal Air Force armoured cere have operated both from the Kuwait anu Transjordan ends, and so these sections of the robte are doubtless well-known. As far as I am aware, however, the middle sections have not been explored from the point of view of practicality for cars. 8. If therefore the Royal Air Force Authorities, who are the people most concerned, are interested from the strategical point of view in the proposed route, it would still be worth while for de Gaury to make his suggested trip, and produce a report on it from the Royal Air Force and military aspect. In this case permission would have to be obtained from the 3audi Government for him to traverse that portion of it which lies in Saudi territory. 1 daresay the Saudi Government will raise no difficulties as they recently (aoout a year ago) gave permission for him to drive from Jeada to Kuwait, a much longer tour, through their territory. 9, If the trip is to be done it should be set ©n foot fairly soon before the Vuraraer is once more upon us. It - the trip - would not involve a prolonged absence of de Gaury from Kuwait. The act al motor journey would not taKe many days, and he coold return from Palestine oy air. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Butler (Senior Naval Officer), Mitchell (Air Officer Commanaing, British Forces in Iraq), de Gaury, Loch and yatts. * Yours sincerely sd.
