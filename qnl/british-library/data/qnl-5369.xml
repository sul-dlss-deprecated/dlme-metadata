Foreign Office. *' i* S.W.l. 23rd February, 1937. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that he has had under his consideration your letter P.Z.687/37 of the 29th January, with which was enclosed a copy of a telegram from the Government of India stating that they are unable to make final recommendations regarding the provision of accommodation at Bahrein for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf until they are satisfied that quarters for the clerical and menial staff of the Residency are already available and will not have to be specially built, as well as your letter P. Z3L4/37 of the 12th February, enclosing copies of earlier telegraphic correspondence between the Government of India and the Political Resident on this subject. 2. Lord Zetland will be aware that as long ago as the 24th October 1936 Lieutenant-Colonel Fov/le telegraphed from Bahrein (see your letter P.Z. 7633/36 of the 31st October, 1936) that with the advice and assistance of the Political Agent and Mr. Croad, of the Indian Public Works Department, he had selected a suitable site for the new Residency and had reached the conclusion that the Residency, with its essential attached buildings, could , ‘i be orovided for 12 lakhs of rupees (i.e. the sum which the ^VjjOf^vernment of India were prepared to expend). He added that, as ^ the estimated cost did not exceed 12 lakhs, the site could be purchased forthwith, provided the Government of India concurred »vr in his choice, thus avoiding the necessity for taking an option LjjL v 1 * iR ‘' AU ' • s tmm The Under-Secretary of State, r,:p4 0,; India Off ice. ~—.• rjy ! . g . ^AIR w A /? • %■ 'S ' sy ^ .(as had been suggested in the course of interdepartmental discussions in London). 5. The Government of India at once approved of Lieutenant- Colonel Fowle’s site, hut not apparently of his recommendation for an immediate purchase, since they stated that they approved of an option being taken upon this site. Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle, however, in a further telegram sent from Bushire on the 7th November (see your letter P.2.7973 of the 9th November, 1936) expressed the opinion that a better bargain would be made if no attempt were made to secure an option, especially as it would be possible, with the help of the Bahrein Government, to prevent any third person from acquiring the site. It is clear, however, from the terms of his telegram that this advice was given on the assumption that sanction for the purchase of the site would quickly be forthcoming. 4. At that time Mr. Eden was under the impression that the Government of India would, be able, with little delay, to agree to steps being taken, with the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, to purchase the site outright. In these circumstances he saw no reason to question Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle’s view that an option was unnecessary. 5. Since Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle made this recommendation, however, more than three months have passed, and no decision has yet been taken. Mr. Eden appreciates that it is only prudent on the part of the Government of India to investigate fully such questions as the accommodation of the clerical and. menial staff, but I am to observe that it was with a view to covering just such a delay as has in fact occurred th..t t e idea of an option was first put forward. Mr. Eden realises that a decision which will render any option unnecessary may soon be reached/— r:7~ . . reached now, hut he nevertheless suggests that unless either (a) the Government of India feel able to undertake to reach a decision upon the scheme submitted to them by the end of, say the present month, or (b) Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle still feels able to adhere to the views expressed in his telegram of the 7th November, even with regard to any further delay steps should even now be taken to secure an option. 6. The question of an option is, however, a relatively minor question, and Mr. Eden is more perturbed at the possibility that the transfer of the Residency may be delayed yet further by subsidiary points of a financial or teclinical nature. It is generally agreed that it is desirable for political reasons to establish the Residency at Bahrein at an early date. A decision to this effect was taken by the Middle East (Official) Bub-Committee on the 5th May, 1956, although further information was required by the Sub-Committee as to the cost of providing alternative accommodation. But developments which have been taking place on the Arab coast since this meeting was held, (and incidentally the fact that hints of the projected transfer have reached the i* ti ama ' Persian Government), render it impossible in Mr. Eden s view to ('m ‘Zk consider a reversal of this decision, whatever the financial difficulties may prove to be. In other words, he considers that ^ &gt;y Of it should be regarded as a matter of policy that a final decision %o establish the Residency at Bahrein should be taken and made _ public as soon as possible, the actual transfer following as soon thereafter as appropriate accommodation can be provided, and that, if appropriate accommodation cannot be provided for the sum which the Government of India were originally willing to expend, either this sum should be increased to the amount required oi should be effected.

On looking at the Political Department file (Do* ) it seemed to me that it was premature to take the matter of adjustment up at this stage. Mr. Clauson agreed and mentioned that before long they would probably receive the information from India necessary to approach to H.M.G. for formal sanction to the expenditure. As this seemed to be a suitable opportunity of raising the accounting question it was arranged to defer action in this Department and reconsider the matter then. 8/12/36.A.G.No.12611/36.

In reporting demi-officially to the Foreign Office the probable charges against that Department for D. and G. services in Persia and elsewhere, etc., vide the letter on the file hereunder, mention was made of the suggested recovery of £15,000 as an instalment of the cost of the new Residency at Bahrein that might be expected to be defrayed during 1937-38, see in this connection reply to this Department’s reference regarding estimates on A.G. 10521/36. It was stated that tne question of official approach regarding accelerated adjustment was being taken up. A principle is involved in this proposed departure from existing practice which under the arrangement made when the work connected with the annual adjustment with the Foreign Office was transferred, vide flag I, would perhaps fall to the Political Secretary to deal with, but it is primarily an accounting matter and will be dealt with in this Department if preferred. In the event of Foreign Office agreement the precise method of giving effect to the arrangement will require consideration: it might take the form of the complete exclusion of the cost of the project from the annual statements, the practicability of which would have to be ascertained from India, of of securing an advance to cover a moiety of the estimated expenditure during the year, adjustable when the year's accounts were received in the ordinary course. Sgd. Sidney Turner.P.z. 8608/36. It would be preferable, from the point of view oi this department, if you were to be good enough to deal with this matter, which as you say is primarily an accounting matter. The principle involved (i.e. that Indian revenues should not be out of pocket longer than necessary) is one in which there can be no disagreement between the departments! The only possible danger is I suppose that the Foreign Office might use this precedent, if it is established, against Indian Revenues in some other connection. But I know of no such similar case, existing or expected. Sgd.

'°en&amp;el ’ s room on the 6th October to discuss th- transfer of the political residency fro^ Bushire to Bahrein. There were present:- Mr* Rendel Mr. Baggallay) Mr. Lambert ) Mr. Walton ■ ; r. Glauson) Lieut.Colonel Powle Foreign Office (In the Chair) Foreign Office. India Office. Political resident in the Persian Gulf. o^ Mr• Rendel explained that the meeting had been called in order to consider the position with regard to the financial estimates of the cost of the proposed move. The political factors which had led the ’’o-ei tm T flee to press for the transfer of the esidency at the earliest possible date remained unchanged, and the Foreign .,fice were therefore anxious to ensure that no delays were ca.sed by difficulties of a purely mechanical or departmental nature. Decisions on financial questions always tootc a long time to materialise, but the procedure might be simplified, if any possible causes of difficulty or ^.elay were foreseen and eliminated before they became acute. 3 . Lieut .-Colonel 'owle replied that the Oovernment of India had prepared an estimate on paper for the building of a new i?esidency, including offices and quarters for all the staff. in this provision was made for an expenditure _ They bad previously seated that of 14 lakhs of rupees. r bey na t the/the maxiimi™ snm which they were prepa^' d to spend was 12 lakhs, and there was not therefore a great discrepancy between the two figures, remaining t^ be overcome. An expert from India was about to proceed to Bahrein to check these estimates on the spot, particularly with regard to the purchase of a site. Lieut.-Colonel Fowle had apparently already selected a site which he thought was the most suitable one, and he anticipated that the Government of India's expert would probably agree with him. It was moreover quite possible that the site, or part of it, would be presented by the Sheikh. Money for the purchase of a site had been included in the Government of India's provisional estimate, but if the site was acquired -Tree of charge a considerable reduction of expenditure would be effected. Furthermore, the Government of India’s estimates took no account of certain economies in regard to telegraphic and touring charges etc., which would be effected as a result of the ^ove, or of certain further economies in construction suggested by Lieut.-Colonel Loch. Altogether there was little doubt that the estimate could be brought down to 12 lakhs or the gulf otherwise bridged. 4 . Uv, Rendel then enquired whether there were any steps which could be taken to expedite the consideration of the financial side of the movement; would it not be possible, for instance, definitely to purchase the site, if it was found to he suitable, in advance of the final acceptance of the detailed estimates to be prepare’, by tae Government of India's expert as a result of his vit.it. Unless this were done there was a danger that the price might be forced up in the interval. After some discussion it was decided that the best procedure would be tor Lieut.-Colonel Fowle, after he had consulted the Government of/of India’s expert at Bahrein (where he expected to arrive about SOtb October) to telegraph to the Government of India the terms upon which the site, or an option thereon for say 12 months, could be purchased, and asking for sanction to conclude this transaction. Meanwhile the India Office would inform, the Government of India by telegraph that this procedure was contemplated, in order that they might be prepared to consider the sum quoted at short notice. 5 . it was decided that the Treasury should be warned at the same time, and in this connexion attention was drawn to the fact that the Treasury, although they had agreed to accept half the cost of the move, had not so far co^itted themselves to accept:;ng any particular sum, whether 12 lakhs or anything else. They had only said that a final decision must await the preparation oi exact es^-i a^es. Lieut .-Colonel Towle was of the opinion that it would be inadvisable to try to hurry the Government of India’s expert ov r the preparation of the detailed estimates of the cost of building, which would probably ta’ie only about six weeks to prepare in any case. In reply to a question by Mr. Rendel, he stated that in his opinion the actual building of the Residency and of the houses for the staff would take about three years. Mr. Rendel emphasised again that for political reasons which were known to everybody concerned the Foreign Office held that it was advisable to shorten the period of transfer as r,uch as Possible. The Foreign Office did not expect, the -ove to ta ,e place in day, but three years was much too long. '.o ,1 nothin^ done to shorten it? Lieut -Colonel owle explained that three years was only a guess on his part. ^en the expert arrived in Bahrein he would be able to for™ a ''’■ e ' xaot opinion of the time required, and he (Lieut. -Colonel towle) o nfr (T&amp; «suggested that upon this and all similar questions the expert’s report should be awaited. Mr. Rendel repeated that it was to at desirable that these various steps should not be allowed to drag out. 7 t in the course of sorr-e further discussion it was suggested that the cost of the erection of a house for the Assistant Political Agent at Qatar, which had been included in the Residency estimate, ought really to be excluded, since it was an expenditure which would have to be incurred sooner or later, whether the transfer of the residency were to be effected or not. EASTERN DEPARTMENT, FOREIGN 0FRIGS. 7th October, 1933.N V FOREIGN CFFIGE, S.W.l. 16th October, 1936. (E 6429/239/34) IMPORTANT. $ ! P. Z, i 1 7 A 43 ' My dear Clauson, \ - With reference to your letter of the 10th October, this is to let you know that we concur in the terms of your draft telegram to the Government of India about the transfer of the Residency. Y/ith regard to the question of warning the Treasury - see paragraph 5 of the record of the meeting enclosed in our letter No.E 6358/239/34 of the 16th October, I gather that you are seeking their concurrence in your telegram and this will presumably be sufficient for the moment. ■J. Clauson Esq. '(Wv 6 ) Mr.Clauson, Move of Residency. Herewith the note I premised |a fcvw, ( &amp; j'' 0 Considerable stress was laid^on the urgency bcv. rev of the move. Urgency is question of -utility, but as the term is generally understood I see none. Question has been on the tapis for a considerable period and by adopting a new line of approach by which the Government of India estimated the cost of the buildings required instead of the Resident, who had no proper staff at his disposal for this purpose, and by which we have tackled the problem step by step instead of at large,we have made more progress in the last six months towards tackling this difficult problem than we did in the previous ten years. 2. The reasons for the previous delays were (a) the various departments concerned: the India Office, the Government of India and the Foreign Office, as well as the Resident, were at variance as to the advisability of the move.3. on the spot, with a view to making a final estimate. When I was in Bahrein on my way home my Assistant Engineer and the Residency Surgeon under my direction collected further data fran the engineering and medical aspects which should 'be of use to the expert. 6. The situation therefore being as it is, personally,in spite of the Foreign Office's zeal for ’’urgency” I think that any attempt to hurry on matters would only defeat itself. The expert's estimate (see immediately preceding paragraph) having regard to local conditions of construction, etc., will not be an easy one to draw up and unless ample time is allowed for its production there is a danger that it may have to be revised later - in the direction of an increase (no Government building ever goes up for less than the estimate ! ) with consequent backchat and argling bargling amongst all concerned. 'f. So much for the problem in general. W^.th regard to details. The Government of India l^ias noted above (paragraph 4) to-tho effeo* that they cannot agree to any preliminary estimate which exceeds Rs.12 lakhs. I imagine that this figure is a ’’tactical' one and that, * C. Ct hv It. (TL VO if pushed, they will ante-up another and my proposals for the new Residency buildings are by no means extravagant/’'N extravagant. Any possible economies on the present rough estimate of Rs.14.71 lakhs (see Government of Indian telegram of 12th August, P.Z.5836) would have to take the form of (a) reducing the size and amenities of the Residency itself: (b) reducing the number of staff houses for of ficers: (c) reducing the number of clerks and ( ^ ^ V^'c. (-2 Hz. MUJ consequently the number of their quarters.^ With regard to (a). This I am strongly against. It is bad economy to 11 swallow a rat and be choked by the tail”. If the Resident is to live in a worse climate than Bushire he must be housed as comfortably as possible (vide end of para. 5 (l) of my letter of 4th February, enclosure to P.Z.2517). Moreover, both H.M.G. and the Government of India are agreed that the Resident must be accommodated in a manner suitable to his position (vide para.8 of Government of India letter of 6th August, P.Z.2517). With regard to (b). This is impracticable(see para.'k below). It is possible that the A.P.A. Bahrein (see/5. (see para. 4 of Goverrment of India telegram of 12th August, P.Z.5838) might have at some time in the future to take up his abode on the Trucial Coast, so for the present it might be possible for him to remain in his present rented house, though it is by no means suitable or comfortable, until we see whether he should have his headquarters in Bahrein or not. But in any case a house will have to be eventually built for him either in Bahrein or the Trucial Coast, so this cannot be counted as an economy. My ideas as to the A.P.A.’s duties are that when the Resident moves to Bahrein the latter will have the Trucial Coast^directly under him, and that the P.A., whose duties will then be confined solely to Bahrein, will be able to carry on without , f’- any assistanee. With regard to (c). It may be possible to reduce the cadre by a clerk or two but it is impossible to give a definite opinion on this point at present until it is seen how the work develops. The Resident will, of course, be more accessible at Bahrein than he is at Bushire and more work therefore may be thrown on his office. After the new Residency has been in (vide the last sentence of para. 4 of my/ Bahrein some time6. my express letter of 25th July, P.Z.5516) it will 56 possible to take a decision. To avoid building quarters V for clerks, whose posts may afterwards be reduced, two or three of the more junior ones might be given temporary hired quarters in Bahrein,if such are available. Oj x -8; Some play has been made by the F.O. on the fact that their Legations and Embassies cost less than the proposed new Residency. These posts, however, are situated in civilized centres and normally only the Ambassador or Minister has to be housed, while the C C «.'t O' t officer and w-e-g-king staff can be accommodated outside in flats, hotels, etc. Conditions in Bahrein,of course, are entirely different. There are no suitable quarters for clerks, much less officers, and accommodation for these has to be built. c. 0 O'. The Government of India do not seem to have taken into account the savings which will be made by the move (vide my letter of the 25th July, P.Z.5515). t I IQ*. I think it would assist me in any discussions if copies of two communications which I sent to the Government of India and which I think are the ones mentioned in Tu: ^ ^ 'was concerned, seemed to be confined between the Govt, of India and myself. Perhaps a telegram might be sent to the Government of India to forward these two letters^ 11. It might be as well to have an inter na departmental meeting with the F.O. where I could make a brief exposition of how the matter stands, in order to keep their minds at ease and disabuse them of any suspicion that we are stone-walling. 12. I should like to discuss this note at seme convenient time.I 8 (4) Under Secretary’s House, (5) Residency Surgeon’s House, (6) Confidential Assistant’s House, (7) Cypher Clerk’s House, (8) Confidential Clerk’s House.

With regards to (b) above. I enclose a complete list of the Residency tnffippr's and staff I am examining the question of possible reductions in staff referred to in paragraph 10 (B) of your express letter No. F. 628-N 135, dated the 6th April 1936 [Serial No. (5)] and will reply separately on this point. 1 do not however foresee that it will be possible to make any reductions that vill materially affect the question of accommodation now under consideration. Houses for Officers, and for a section of the confidential staff, who will have to live near the Residency in order to deal with urgent work at any time of the dav or night, will have to be constructed as akeady indicated. It may be nossible to induce Bahrain landlords to construct suitable houses for the re mainder of the clerical staff provided the former can be assured of long term rentals. If this is not possible then houses will have to be constructed tor all the clerical staff. The willingness or otherwise of the landlords to do this can only be ascer tained by actual enquiry. If this is done the project can no longer be kept secret and I suggest that this enquiry be postponed till a site is chosen. SCHEDULE OF RATES. Bahrain. Labour.

THd CHAIISSAN considered that as both the Foreign Office and the India Office «re agreed that on Political Residency political grounds the move of txie To from Bushire to Bahrein should take place there ,'as no need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of such a move, which had been set out in Colonel L * uth February, 1936 (circulated *■ Fowle's letter dated 4th j?eDruax.y, rr u m ( q) 207).

The Foreign Office, for their part, regarded the move as urgently necessary for -r , *P *1 T* C • i' Td '1 £3 C* 0 'b 11U1^- political reasons. In t^e first pic-o wiujf sooner the Residency could be established on the Arab side of the liulf &gt; the better. The situation on the Arab coast was developing rapidly. Oil concessions had already been granted, ana others were in -recess of being ac,paired. There were a number of international questions of growing importance, including that of air communications. it was possible th-t the French and uutch might wish to ostcbl regular air services along the Arab coast m the near future. Moreover there was the important question ox the south eastern frontiers of tsudi Arabia which might at any moment n ,. r—-nticularly at the base of the '^atar lead to difficulties* particulars x-, + of the Trucial coast.

Finally he considered that the Ciovernmem, oi India were inclined to under-estimate the difficulties and complications resulting from the continued maintenance of the Political Residency on the Persian side of the Gulf. Although the Persians, witn their usual shrinking from finality, nad not formally pressed us to remove the Residency at any rate in recent years - the fact that we continued to maintain on Persian soil, and under the transparent and rather undignified disguise of a Consul-General, a political ° 1 - llCL,r Wu0 was of the Persian Gulf, was a virtually Governorceaseless source of friction in our relations with -4- Persiao The Persians strongly resented the arrangement 9 which was anomalous and illogical.

The Foreign On ice would like to see the move carried out at once, or at any rate within a year.-5- SIR HUGHE KITATCIIBULL-HUGES SEN 9 replying to a question aloout the Persian claim to Bahrein, said that although the Persians had not formally abandoned their claim to Bahrein, there were indications that they were unwilling to press it seriously against us. When His Majesty’s Government decided to remove the British naval establishments from Henjam and Basidu to Bahrein it had been his duty to inform the Persian Foreign Minister of their decision. He expected that the Foreign Minister would protest strongly against the decision to transfer the British naval depots to Bahrein, but the Foreign Minister limited himself to expressing great satisiaction at the evacuation of the Persian islands, which he said had greatly improved the situation, and would afiord an opportunity to settle other outstanding questions. He added that he would be obliged to record a formal protest in regard to the establishment of the depots at Bahrein, but he said that the Persians did not,in fact, desire to have Bahrein, as, being so distant, it would only prove an embarrassment to them. In view, however, of -Persian prublic opinion if they could not abandon timdr claim v/i.uho a ou id pro q uo,. The Persian Government had in due course entered a reservation and formal protest regarding Bahrein accordingly• Sir Hughe considered that on political gioundo it wa most desirable to effect the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrein as soon as possiole. MR. REHDEL recalled that one of sir Hughe predecessors had once reported that a Persian Minister had said to him that if only His Majesty's Government had , t-; mil ftr would have been avoided, annexed Bahrein much difficulty wouia -n v i mil ri then have hnown where they otood. as the Persians wouia nmii nrwr +n establish the Residency at Bahrein we If we were now bo Co uaui-Lo^ishould he going some way towards making the issue one between ourselves and Persia rather than an issue affecting the Sheikln In reply to a question by the Chairman,, he said that the Foreign Office were extremely anxious to strengthen our position at Bahrein. THE CHAIRMAN asked whether it would be possible for the Committee to agree to adopt the time table suggested in paragraph 10 of the Government of India’s letter No. F,628-N/35 of the 6th April, 1956 (circulated with Paper No* M.E.(0) 207). These proposals were as follows:- 'lO, Taking all the circumstances into account we are of opinion that the^ approach towards the question of the move should be as follows:- (A) Fowle will endeavour to work out ^ an estimate of the probable saving in telegraphic cud tour charges consequent on the move (see paragrax^h 4(E) of his letter). (B) He will also submit his proposals as to the question of staff. (C) When (B) has been completed a Public Works Department export will visit Bahrein. (D) When a detailed estimate of the cost of the Residency and Staff buildings has been made, a final decision as to the move can be taken.” MR. WALTON said that the Government of India, whilst nclined to agree to the move subject to financial onsiderations, were of opinion that it was not a .atter of urgency, which aspect of the problem had been ether over-emphasised by the Foreign Office. HeI considered that the reasons for the move were mainly those of convenience ? c.g. the establishment of the Residency on the Arab shore in touch with the Royal Air Force? the naval base at Bahrein, the ability to send air letters rather than telegrams? etc. it was agreed that there were no political objections to the moave? and it was now necessary to consider the financial implications and the means by which it should be carried cirh ' Whilst of course accepting what had been said about Persia he did^feel that the question was of the importance and urgency on high political grounds suggested by Mrs Rendel. MR. RENDEL said he had referred to the Persian aspect of the problem as secondary because he considered that the political aspect of establishing the R e sidency at Bahrein was much more important hian mat tin moving out from Bushire. MR. WALTON said that admitting the political icasons he was not convinced that very urgent action was necessary, It would still be necessary to consider the financial aspects, and the India Office were not prepared to go beyond the views expressed by the Government of India. p T-nrH o ’'ribbed to prococd cauoiously 9 The Government oi India wi^nc . i • ■+-i^ srnfhi in his own mind that the but there was little cioabc m ■ a. •nrPec'C' +Rg estimates were move would be carried out unless found to be prohibitive. In the ensuing discussion the proposals of mo Government of India and the moan, w ^ ““ M ho implemented tore considered. «» finanoial implications he ele.rcd up and it .ns agreed that nothing could ho done until the cuoairy re.erred t r-8- 'been carried out ? tlie sooner the final results were obtained 5 however, the better. The procedure suggested by the Government of India seemed to be a reasonable method of approach to the problem and the general opinion was that this method should be adorted. it was suggested that action under (A) and (B) would take a very short time and that in order to expedite matters,arrangements should be made for the Public Works Department expert to visit Bahrein and discuss the matter of the site and costs of the new Residency with Colonel Powle before the latoer came home on leave. THE CHAIRMAN enquired whether use could be made of the residency at Bushire when the move had been made or whether it could be sold. SIR HUGHE KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN thought it very doubtful whether it could be sold and that it migho be too large and expensive for the Consular officer who would he posted at Bushire to keep UP* f CONCLUSIONS. It was agreed:- (i) for political reasons the early of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein was desirable. That move (ii) That, as the position in regard to the f inaneia! implications of the move jas not yet clear, action snould he ta^e as soon as posi suggestions lossiblc on tho followm^ put forward by the Government of Indi; (A) Powle will endeavour to v,or*, out an estimate of the ylkharmel in telegraphic and ' b0U ' t /Ul® rapTap h consequent on tne move (see paxag P 4(E) of his letter).smonESTBP RBVIS;^ S.WS Qf.

Although the Persians, with their usual shrinking from finality, had not formally pressed us to remove the Residency - at any rate in recent years - the fact that we continued to maintain on Persian soil, and under the transparent and rather undignified disguise of a Consul General, a political officer who was virtually Governor of the Persian Gulf, was a ceaseless source of friction in our relations wit* Persia. The Persians strongly resented the arrangement/arrangement, which was anomalous and illogical. They might at any moment - particularly if our relations with Persia were to deteriorate - press for the immediate removal of the Residency from Persian soil. Even now they would not allow Colonel pcwle to receive letters or comaunicatione addressed to him in his principal capacitjr, i *e * that Political Resident. It would be humiliating and \ undignified to have to remove the Residency hurriedly as the result of Persian pressure, and it would be far better to carry out the move now with dignity and at our own convenience than to have to tjM ^ cijL-V* J&gt;.AA&gt;cj-3 capitulate at some later date^and execute an undignified retreat. The same considerations had been urged by the Foreign Office in the case of the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu, and although thv Foreign Office view had been strongly opposed bj ull the other Departments concerned at the time, the action eventually taken had proved en wrrel^. successful and fully justified. He submitted that thereon siderations applied to the present case.

Minute Paper. Under Secretary of State, Propo sed _tra_nsfer of t he Political Res _i_dency frorn Bushire to Bahrein. ^ This question has Been revived by the Foreign Office in their official letter at P.Z.1580/36 following upon discussions between Sir Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen and jSir Aubrey Metcalfe at Delhi last November£X£ The Political Resident and the Government of India agree with the Foreign Office that it is generally desirable that the Political Resident should move his headquarters from the Persian coast to the Arab coast,which is now the centre of British air and naval interests and whose political and economic importance is on the increase owing to the emergence of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the discovery of oil. The Government of India are, however, reluctant to agree to the move, even in principle, until a further exploration is made of the financial considerations involved which remain, as on former occasions when this question has been discussed, the crux of the situation. Although as a result of the move it may be possible to effect economies in the Resident’s telegraph and office chargesjby combining the office staff of the Residency and the Bahrein Agency, the Government of India consider that the figure of £100,000, mentioned by Sir Hugh Biscoe in 1932 as the probable cost of the move, is no pessimistic estimate. Before agreeing to make any contribution the Government of India wish to know the exact sum which they would be called upon to meet and t4en how this sum is to be allocated between themselves and H.M.G. It wiXl appear, Middle East Committee discuss this question therefore, that the meeting of the which is to be held on May 5th to will not be able to make much progress 4424 5000 1/36—qfcw progress. The India Office representative/ might (1) state general agreement with the Foreign Office that the move is desirable on political grounds; (2) support the programme suggested by the Government of India for ascertaining the cost f lc .f &lt;‘11 iCCcr .1 of the move; L r* J J f V 1 (3) state the objections*to the Foreign Office proposals for amalgamating the Residency and the Political Agency at Bahrein and to the use of the latter’s buildings for the former; (4) raise the question of the incidence of the cost of transfer between the Government of India and H.M.G. The last point is perhaps rather delicate ground as the Government of India consider that the opportunity should be taken to decide the future allocation of cost of the Bahrein Agency itself. The view of the India Office has been that it is hardly wise to put forward such a proposal at this juncture (see Mr.Walton’s note of the 12th March on the separate file attached). On the other hand the allocation of cost of transfer will have to be discussed some time, and should it be raised at the meeting we might take the line that a 50/50 arrangament would be a suitable provisional basis.

This we have now done. 3. On the whole Powle ( vide last sentence of paragraph 6 of his letter) is in favour of the move, and subject always to the financial considerations dealt sith below in paragraph 8 [we are inclined to agree. It will be seen that the arguments adduced by the Foreign Office ( vide their letter No.S1097/259/3 ( dated the 7th Narch 1936) in favour of the move are .genera, ly similar to those mentioned by Powle. Ke does not consider, however, ( vide paragraph 4-B of his letter) that the possiole Iranian 'petty vexation” referred to by the Foreign Oiiice n paragraph 7 of their letter need be given much weight. We (Signature) \ S. 44. MFP—825S&amp;P—(M-1070)—14-9 34—10,000. (Designation) id i ?2 concur. 4. Uic Foreign Olfice in paragraph 5 of their letter suggest: (1) That it might be possiole to abolish the post of Political Agent, Bahrain, ana amalgamate it with that of the Resident. (2) That it night be feasible to use the present Bahrain Agency as partial accornuocation in connection with the Residency. 5. With regard to (1). This is quite impossible, xiie Political Agent nas more than a, full day's work. He uas to supervise nob only the working of his office (which a i ar o e one), but the Court of his Indian Assistant, and has himself to axt in a judicial capacity both as an Appellate Court ana-:: or certain cases,-as a Court of original jurisdiction. (He is investea with the powers of a Sessions Judge and District Magistrate). He has to attend to local passport questions, and, as you are aware, such questions in the Gulf are of more than ordinary complexity. He has in consultation with the Finaxial Adviser to keep an eye on the finances of the Bahrain state ana by iniluending the Sheikh to try and check extravagance. He nas to intervene in questions between Bahrain ana Saudi Arabia. Moreover, in the last few years, the removal of Hie air-route and the Naval Base to Bahrain, and the opening there of a large oil field, have added considerably to hio labours. All these activities the Political Agent, Bahrain, of course, carries out under the general guidance and instructions of the Resident, but to throw them wholly, or even in part, on to the shoulders of the latter, would be....of..,. 3 Ids to defeat the whole object of moving him to the Residency is r oved to Bahrain the post of Political barely sufficient accommodation for the Political Agent and no use can bo made of it in connection with the Residency. 7. (a) T 7ith regard to the suggestion contained at the end of paragraph 2 of your telegraph under reference, it is possible that some economy might be effected in the matter of office staff. This is a point which must be settled before the action notea in the next paragraph can be taken, since obviously no exact estimate of the cost of the buildings for the Residency staff can be made until it is settled what staff the Resident will need. Vie are therefore asking Fowle to go into this question and forward his concluslcns after he returns to Bushire* (h) With regard to the other suggestion in the same paragraph of your telegram and in paragraph 3, we think that these points might be left for decision to a later stage. 8, as to the method by which the problem of the move should be tackled we are in entire agreement with Fowle ( vide paragraph 7 of his letter) that the crux of it is financial and that until the cost of the move has been accurately estimated and its allocation determined no useful purpose will be served by discussion Agent must remain an entirely separate one. 6. maixegard. to (2). This proposal likewise is not feaslole. The present Agency building liasniv ) of the principle. ! IV ■■ WW*'* % 'he Public wo rice Department, on the analogy of the cost of building of Residency ana staff buildings in India, are of opinion that the estimate of £100,000 originally given by Biscoe (see paragraph 8 of Bowie’s letter) is probably by no means excessive, when the 'site-costs'’, (land, roads, water .up. If, etc., etc.) are taken into consideration. de en-iieli concur in the Foreign Office's opinion (as expressed in paragraph 7 of their letter) of the importance of the Resident's post as approximating to that of a High Commissioner and it ^oes without saying that he must be accommodated in a manner suitable to his position. As some further guide to probable expenditure it is worth noting that the cost of the Kabul Legation was is. 18 , 00,000 (£135,000), and that of the nw KuiijaQ Agency buildings at Lahore was about tue same. ^ 9 .

This heing so, we feel that we shoulu make use of the time at our disposal to explore the question in a somewhat more thorough and systematic manner than perhaps has been done in the past, before a decision is made which must necessarily have many important political and financial implications. The issue of the above has been authorised. Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. sCGHFIDSI1TIAL . D.0.NO.85-S of 1936. „ , . The Hesidency, Bushire, the 4th February 1936. My dear Metcalfe, Gould you please refer to your demi-official letter bo.F.628-N/35, dated the 9th December 1935, enclosing Fmatchbull-Hugessen’s Note on the subject of that tf hardy annuar 1 : the transfer of the Bushire Residency. The proposal raises a good many important pros and cons, and in order to deal with it effectively I am afraid that my reply must be another long contri bution to the voluminous literature which has already grown round this subject. 2. Perhaps the simplest way to deal with the question will be to enumerate the advantages end dis advantages of the proposal, and then to add my comments. The advantages of the move , some of which have been put forward in Knatchbull-Hugessen T s Note, and others from time to time elsewhere, appear to be as follows A. It would please the Iranians, and might form a bargaining counter in any negotiations with them. B. It would remove the Resident from oeing a hostage in the hands of the Iranian Government, who could obstruct his ingress and egress. C. It would place the President on the Arad uoast where Ms presence is necessary. 2. It would put the Resident in closer touch with the Persian Gulf Division. s. It would place the Resident on the Imperial Airways’ route between London and India. F. It would increase our prestige on the Arab side of the Gulf.- 2 - 3. The disadvantages of the move seem to he these (1) The cost will he high: £ 100,000 has been quoted for the building of a new Residency at Bahrain. (2) There are various questions which concern both sides of the Gulf, Arab and Persian, and it is a distinct convenience to have a single authority - the Resident - who can co-ordinate questions as a whole and submit his views to the various higher authorities concerned. (3) In times of crisis, if ’Iran’ for instance on the disappearance of the present Shah becomes once again the old chaotic ’Persia’, the argument has still more force (see paragraph 7 of my despatch 10.691-S of 2ist June 1933). With regard to paragraph 2 above . My comments are follows A.Personally I have never felt that there was much in this argument. In the first place, as you aie aware, the idea of the move did not emanate from the Iranian Government but from us, and was made by Clive (when Minister, Tehran) to Taimourtache (vide Tehran despatch No.89 of Feoruary 16tn 19^9 to the Foreign Office), as a counter in the n^go tiations for the General Treaty with Iran. This Treaty, as I understand it, is now dead and buried and is most unlikely to be exhumed. The Iranians moreover,have never pressed for the move, nor - as far as I am, aware - have they ever treated it as of much importance. Moreover my position here is purely that of Consul-General not Resident, as explained in my Note to Walton of 6th September 1933, quoted by you.B. The Iranian Government might of course refuse to let the Resident leave Bushire, or alternatively might refuse to permit him to return and keep him a homeless wanderer roving up and down the waters of the Persian Gulf, hut I think this very unlikely, and if they did so it would he an entirely unjustifiable act which I trust His Majesty’s Government would take exception to in the strongest possible manner. Ho Consular Officer is a prisoner in his post at the whim of the Foreign Government of the country in which he is serving. When I leave Bushire I obtain the ordinary * jawaz 1 (exit visa) which everyone has to obtain, and there is no reason why a Consul-General should be given woise treatment by the Iranian Authorities than a private individual. I note that the Foreign Office think that the present position of the Resident at Bushire is pretty safe (vide paragraph 4 of their letter (E 5451/132S/34) of | 13th November 1933 to the India Office. 0. I shouldn’t say exactly that the Resident’s continual presence on the Arab Coast is necessary he can keep in touch through his Political Agent and by touring. But there are various ways in which his presence there would be distinctly J more convenient. He would obviously be more on the spot at Bahrain than at Bushire and his ; touring charges would be lightened. xhe importance of the Persian side of the Gulf havxr, declined and that of Me WaO side, :or wlucn tbe.. rrs_ 4 - the Resident is responsible, having increased (see paragraph 5(2) and (3)) it would he more logical for the Resident to have his Head quarters in his domain instead of outside it. D. The Resident at Bahrain would of course he in closer personal touch with the Senior Naval Officer than at Bushire. The presence of the President on the Imperial Airways ! route between London and India would be a distinct advantage from the point of view of dealing quickly and economically with communications. My yearly telegraphic bill (the average of the last five years works out at about Rs. 58,200-0-0 or £ 4,350-0-0 per annum) is fairly high. I admit this with an easy conscience as I take considerable pains to reduce my telegrams to a minimum, and to draft them as briefly as possiole. Owing, however, to the fact that the Air Lines running on the Persian side of the Gulf are foreign (French and Dutch) which I sin unable to use for most of my confidential matter, I have to send and receive a large number of telegrams to and from the Government of India and the India Office, as well as those I send and receive to and from lehr an and Jedda. I have also to send a number of telegrams to the Political Agents on the Arab Coast, and some to the Ambassador at / Bagdad...Indie Exe either hui It in pieces which hEve a good climate, or the Resident has a hill station at which he spends the whole of the hot weather. The Resident at Bahrain will hare to spend at least part of the weather there, and the climate of Bahrain is distinctly worse(l can speak from personal experience } than that of 2ushire, which has the 'best cliroate in trie Gulf ( &amp;s fax as th^t go es i) - which pres ■roahly was one of the reasons why it whs originally chosen for the Residency* If therefore it is finally decided to move the Resident, who will always be a man of a certain age, to a worse climate he should be installed as comfortably as possible* This is quite apart from the prestige point of view of having the Resident s lit&amp;bly accommodated. ) and ( 5)» These two disadvantages can be taken together and, speaking at large, are off-set by Hie dwindling importance of South Persia - the area with which the Resident is concerned as a co-ordinating authority. By far the greater proportion of British tr^de is, and has always been, with Hie sou Hi, *»s opposed to the llorth, of Persia, hut British trade with Pexsic.. h &amp; s of late years unfortunately diminished appreciaoly• Ho re ever Hie traders themselves - almost all Bririsn Indians - continue to leave the country, while the Route and the :*v?l Bsse - representing strtegical f sc tors - have noved to the Arab side. Another British interest -,the Cable and Wireless Ltd.- are giving up three out of their four stations in South Persia i nd opening up e neu one at Lahrain; while the fourth one - Bushire - they will probably evacuate when the Residency is roved. ItBut.••»»••• It seems to me in fact that 'besides the small amount of British trade which remains we have now only two interests of any i nportanoe in South Persia: the local tranches of the Imperial Bunk of Iran situs.ted in that -res and the ipiglo-Iranian Oil Company* 'Jhe Imperial Bank of Iran have weathered many storms in the past, and will doubtless continue to do so in the future* the ^nglo-Iranian Oil Company also in normal times are large enough to look after themselves, tnough, in the case of Iran relapsing into chaos, arrangements would have to he made for hie protection of their refinery and oil-fields. But from the local naval p^int of view even the Anglo-I rani an Oil Company will shortly decline in importance when the refinery, which the Bahrein Petroleu i Company r re about to erect, is completed, the sloops of the Persian Culf Division I will then be able to ignore Abadan and obtain their fuel from Bahrain, while if the new* O.ompanies at Kuwait end ^tar strike oil the import.nee of the An g 1 o -1 r ?ini an Oil Company in Persia as an oil producing concern may also diminisn. Some time ego I amused myself by indulging in prophecy of what might happen in Persia when hie present Shan disappeared (vide -fly rote dated uctoter 1931, enclosed with my deifli-official let-'ei ..&lt;J- 691-3 of 17th October 1931) and envisaged the possibility of Fis l&amp;jesty's Government having once again - as in the old days - to intervene actively in South Persia in order to protect British interests. If such an intervention were necessary the presence of the Resident on the Persian side would be most useful.Ik - i 'ivi \ ✓ -9- i3ut since ulis fc xc te» c. nd ny O'tiiex Is iissr of* Slsi 1933 Qu oted in psr&amp;gr&amp;ph 3(3^ a cove» tile situation Iiss altered, end in the interval our interests in South Persia have rapidly declined.

TO sunup briefly the pros ond cons of the question* The arguments for the removal of the Residency based on pleasing the Iranians, and removing the Resident as s. hostage out of their hands , do not seen to me personally to have much weight, (paragraph 4 &amp; and B above}* On the a the rh and, from our owr. political and adroini s trs- ti ve point of view, with the shifting of the centre of gravity from the Persian to the Arab side of the Gulf it would certainly be more convenient for the Resident to have his Headquarters in his domain r^tner un&amp;n outside it, (paragraph 4 C and D aTjove). Moreover it would be a distinct sdvsnt^ge for the Resident to be on the British Air Route between London and India, and the consequent economy in his telegraphic charges would be a s ibs •^ani.io.j. off against the cost of the move ( paragraph 4h and paragraph liiL above). An argument against the removal of the Residency, which in my opinion had much cogency, was ifa»t as long as the Resident was on the Iranian side of the Gulf he could, especially in times of stress, for the benefit of his higher authorities co-ordinate 1he Gulf as a whole, ait with the importance of . , ~ nnif v «-nidlv dimnisiiing, end that the Persian side of the Gull r^piuxy -,n Tr „ q h-i T r i ricreasinv• this argument of the Arab States equally rapidly incre^s j.h 0 ,-r loses much of its force (par&amp;gr^ph 5 (2) and (5) ^bove). Te king the question as e 'vhole I am in f&amp;vo ir of the move. 7, Bit the main Gmuoc of the question, as of so many others, seems to me to lie in its financial aspect. Far from any decision being arrived at on the question of the move, I do not see how any useful discussions can even be started, until we have at our disposal a reliable estimate of what its cost will be. The primary essential is therefore to obtain this estimate. 3 . Fiscoe in his demi-official letter of 24th March quoted in paragraph 5 (1 ) above, gave reasons for putting the cost of building a Residency at Bahrain ao about £100,000 Prims facie these reasons seem to me to oe adequate* iiit Foreign Office, however, apparently expected the cost oo be much less: though it is not clear on what they based tueir optimism (vide their fetter of 1st January 1931 to the India Office, quoted Toy Bisooe in his letter of 24thMardi). the method of approach hitherto adopted towards the finsnoidj. aspect of the question seems to have been to request the long suffering Resident to produce an estiraate of the cost of the Bahrein Residency, and when with consiaeraole l&lt;*oour he has done so to say it is too large, end will he please work out still further details to support it. It e-ppetrc to me, however, that it is the government of India, snd not the , , ^ ■ni'.cpd. for -aroducing the required Resident, who &amp;re oes u pi-^ceu u. u a. t a ~ - have oornple te estimate. They - the Government of I-aia , „ . , . + to huild Residencies in India, they details of what it costs .o ouixu .t. r , lc of the Kuwait Agency recently also have figures of the oo-t o- v, n,,T.t&gt;ier highly efficient Public completed, and they have further a y x t instead of the small P.W-D. personnel places ¥orhs DepE rtment insteaa 01h%i -10 at the disposal of the 'Resident, whose rasin business it is merely to keep existing buildings in the Gulf in repair, and who are naturally quite incapable of producing such complicat ed estimates as that of the construction of shrtew Residency. I have no doubt that the Public Works Department experts of Government, with the object before them of building a Residency on Indian lines, and with the information available from the Kuwait Agency as to construction costs in the Gulf, will be able to produce &amp; rough, yet reliable, general KKJtxxxxx estimate. I suggest therefore that this estimate be produced. When this has been completed I would be grateful if it could be sent to me for my comments. 9. I on ray side will analyse my telegrams to see what saving could reasonably be expected if the Resident were at Rshrsin and could use the Air Mai 1 instead of telegraphing . X will also examine the question of how iar mis touring charges could be cut down with Bahrain as his Headquarters insteed of Bush ire. , then I have produced these figures, dnd the Government of India have produced theirs, the nrst stage of the enquiry will be completed. 10 . Ohe second stage will be for e PMV.D. exper_t from India to visit Bahrain, and with my collaboration choose &lt;* site.. (His visit can be suitably camouflaged in some way or other in order to prevent rumours, though as a matter of feet for seme years - vide paragraph 3 of Biscoe’s letter 30.517-S of 22nd September 1930 - it has teen common talk that the residency might be moved at some time or other to Bahrain).

The Kuwait Agency took two years to 'build, and I should t/iink that, from the date on which His Majesty's Government decide that the move shall take place (if the:, do so decide), the Residency and connected buildings will not he ready for the Resident and his Staff to move into for at least a year longer. yours sincerely , Sd/- T.

Walton, Esq.., C.B. , M.C. (E 1097/239/34) Pi Immediate My dear V/alt on, You will see from paragraph 9 of our official letter of 7th March, numbered as above, about the proposed transfer of the Politics] esidency to Bahrain, that we have suggested that the matter might be considered Toy the Middle-East Sub Committee, at some date prior to 25th March, in order that Hugessen might be able to attend and give us the benefit of his views. We think this most desirable, as Hugessen, apart from being extremely familiar with the Persian aspect of the question (which is admittedly a secondary one), has recently aiscussea the whole matter orally with the authorities at Delhi, ana with Powle himself, and, more recently of course, with Lord Zetland and with you. I am now writing this supplementary note to say that Hugessen tells me that it would be extremely convenient if the meeting could be held before 19th March, as he then ..• 179 1 L h s; [FOREIGN OFFICE, S. .. 1. 9th March, 1936.then hopes to go for a few days to Sussex, though he could come up for the day if necessary. Do you think that in these circumstances it would he possible to have the meeting on, say, Monday 16th March at 3.30 p.m.? I realise of course that you are unlikely to have the considered views of the Government of India and of the political Resident by that date; hut the proposed Q-y_g 3 xon is really intended to he mainly preliminary , with a view to clearing the ground and to getting the observations of the other Departments here, and I think, therefore, that there would he no harm in having iu in advance of the receipt of the Government of India’s detailed views. If you feel able to agree to this suggestion, perhaps you would veiy kindly let me know ty telephone in order that the necessary arrangements may he made with Webh as soon as possible.

S.W.l* \ IMPOHT^TT . Sir, 7th March, 1936. I am directed hy Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that he has recently had under consideration the question of the headquarters of the Political Residency of the Persian Gulf. 2. Mr. Eden has in particular been increasingly impressed by the growing importance of British interests on the Arab side of the Gulf and by the practical inconveniences which earunot fail , to follow from the fact that, notwithstanding the gradual shifting which has taken place of what may be described as the centre of gravity of .british interests fx*om the Persian to the Arab side of the Gulf, the headquarters of the Resident still remain at a point so distant from most of the areas and territories which fall within that ofticer’s sphere. 3* It is unnecessary for the moment to discuss in detail the developments which have brought about this shifting of the balance of British interests in the Gulf; but the r- following are among the most important factors (i) . The establishment and development of the Bxutish commercial and military air routes along the Arab coast. (ii) . The establishment of the main British naval station at Bahrain. (iii) . The impending establishment of a new air base at Bahrain. (iv) . The recent establishment of British and foreign oil interests on the Arabian side of the Gulf, and the necessity P H ; : H b r 1 lb i he Under Secretary of State, India Office. COPY SENT BY AIR MA1U |rif t MAR Wifi ' i*. Trwb/u-t'necessity of carefully watching future developments in this direction® (v). The increasing importance of political relations with King Ihn Saud of Saudi-Arabia, with special reference to British interests and rights in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Gulf, including the difficult question of the boundaries of Arabia, which as Lord Zetland is aware, is still far from being satisfactorily settled, and still constitutes a potential source of danger. 4. In these circumstances Mr. Eden has been led to the conclusion that there would be great advantage in bringing the policy of His Majesty’s Government into line with these developments by the transfer of the political Residency from the somewhat distant place on foreign soil which it at present occupies, to Bahrain, which is rapidly becoming the centre of the new developments and activities in the Persian Gulf, the most important of which have been mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 5® Mr. Eden is aware that on the various occasions when this proposal has heen tentatively considered in the past the view has heen taken that the cost of erecting a suitable Residency building at Bahrain would be prohibitive, and that the proposal was therefore impracticable, if only on groundsjjoupnsys fpoin Bnsliii*© 'to ’vs.r'io'u.s point/S of tli© Ax*Q.t) coastf ana particularly uo -bahrain* If the Residency were permanently established at Bahrain f (which is in any case on the main British commei'cial and military air routes), apart from the fact that many of these journeys would become unnecessary, the Resident would be in a position to carry out many of such journeys as would still be necessary by air, possibly with the assistance of the Royal Air Force, thus effecting an important saving both of time and of money* Furthermore, if the Political Agency at Bahrain were to be closed down as such, use might be made of the present agency building, and the very heavy estimates which have hitherto been produced for an entirely new establishment on an imposing scale might be brought down to more manageable proportions, 6# I am, however, to suggest that, while Mr. Eden does not in any way wish to minimise the importance of these financial considerations, it seems desirable that a question of such political importance should be considered primarily on political grounds. If, in fact, it could be established that it would be of material benefit to British and Imperial interests that the headquarters of the Resident should now be established at the same centre as the new naval and air oases in the Persian Gulf, and at the central point for the development of the new oil interests on the Arao coast — i.e. at Bahrain it would prove a xalse economy go refrain j.rom carrying out such a necessary measure merely owing to the comparatively minor financial difficulty of uhe cost of erecting suitable accommodation for the Resident and his staff. 7. The question of the attitude of the Persian Government towards the Political Residency at Bushire appears to Mr. Eden to he entirely secondary to these major considerations. At the same time the removal of the Residency from Bushire, would undoubtedlyundoubtedly facilitate greatly relations between His Majesty’s ; Government and the Persian Government by removing an anomaly which has proved a constant source of petty friction between the two Governments and which, by placing His Majesty’s Government in a false position, has weakened their hands in dealing with the Government at Tehran. The present position indeed, by which an ofiicial of the Government ox i.ndia, who is virtually Governor Inast High Commissioner icr, the minor Arab States of the Persian Gulf, resides, under the thin and transparent disguise of a British Consul General, on Persian soil, and is precluded, while so residing there, even from receiving communications addressed to him in one of his Capacities, appears both undignified and unsatisfactory. It could be terminated at any time by the Persian Government who are even now in a position to cause the Resident constant petty vexation and greatly to increase the difficulties of his task. Were this position to he regularised and were His Majesty's Government to withdraw an official who, in his most important capacity, is virtually a hostage in Persian hands, to a place where their rights rest on a sound Treaty basis and where they can exercise effective measures of control, the political situation could only he clarified and improved. 8 Finally in Mr. Eden's opinion the transfer of the from .hr, fo -of. - - — ■u the -position which His Majescy s effect of emphasising trie Government have taken up towards the Persian claim to those islands, and their determination firmly to resist it. 9 . m these circumstances I am to propose that, as a + -inn of the possible transfer of the next step, the question - ^ ^ oVtpn 1 be discussed by the .o -Rnahire to Bahrain shall uc Residency from Bushir- MiddleMiddle East Official Sub Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. If Lord Zetland agrees with this proposal I am to suggest that the matter might conveniently he considered hy the Sub Committee at some date prior to 25th March, since Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran, will he available in London until that date and would thus he able to attend the meeting. 10* A copy of this letter is being sent to the Secretary of the Middle East (Official) Sub Committee.

H.A.P. f • to mAppendix. Question of the Political Residency at Bushire. At no period have the Persians definitely demanded the removal of the Residency from Persian soil; but in many informal discussions with Sir R. Clive, Teymourtache made it quite clear at one stage that his Government regarded the Residency as one of those regrettable survivals which stood in the way of a general improvement in Anglo-Persian relations. Eventually, therefore, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India gave their consent, in principle and subject to certain important conditions, to the transfer of the Residency as part of a general settlement. 2. In September 1930 Sir R. Clive, in the hope of reviving and clinching the treaty negotiations at a moment when they seemed on the point of breaking down, spontaneously suggested to Feroughi the possibility of a concession subject to these conditions, and followed up his suggestion by the letter of which the relevant part is annexed. Briefly, the proposal was for an exchange of notes in which His Majesty’s Government would announce, on the conclusion of the General treaty, their decision to remove the Residency to a site outside Persia as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made and provided that the Resident were allowed unrestricted access on all occasions to British consular posts in the Persian ports of the Gulf; and the Persian Government, in their turn, would signify their acceptance of the conditions attached to this decision. 3. Owing to the ensuing breakdown of the negotiations, the Persian Government did not at once react to this proposal save in the form of a brief and vague expression of thanks on the part of Feroughi. In a conversation with Sir R. Hoare in March 1932, Teymourtache and Feroughi even alleged that they had never received Sir R. Clive’s letter, though it was subsequently proved that they had. On that occasion Teymourtache made it clear that he regarded the indefinite continuance of the present arrangements as a lesser evil than the removal of the Residency coupled with the conditions which had been proposed, i.e., that the Resident should have the unrestricted right to tour the South Persian consulates from a base outside Persia. He put forward a new suggestion of his own, to the effect that the Resident might spend the summer at Bushire and the rest of the year on the Arab coast, provided that while at Bushire his political functions in matters relating to the Arab sheikhdoms were performed by corres pondence and did not entail constant visits of His Majesty’s Ships for political consultations. (It may be noted that these two provisos are, in fact, already observed by the Resident—see paragraph 7 below.) 4. The whole question of the conditions to be imposed before consenting to the removal of the Residency was re-examined by the Foreign Office in April 1932, and in Mr. Rendel’s semi-official letter to Mr. Donaldson of the 29th April it was suggested that further consideration should be given to the possibility of waiving the previous insistence of His Majesty’s Government on the rights of the Resident as “Inspecting Consul-General.” Owing, it is understood, to the ensuing uncertainty as to the fate of the treaty negotiations as a whole, no reply was received to Mr. Rendel’s letter. 5. In November 1932, in connexion with the Persian demand for the evacuation of Hen jam, the following suggestion was made in the course of an interdepartmental discussion :— “Mr. Grieve and Mr. Laithwaite both thought that if, in addition to retaining our naval depot at Hen jam and so avoiding the expenditure involved in providing alternative accommodation at Bahrein, there were a chance of saving the expense likely to be incurred in transferring the Political Residency at Bushire to the Arabian coast, which, from the informa tion available, appeared likely to be not less than £100,000, we might be justified in considering not only the remission of the balance of the war and post-war debt, but possibly the payment in addition of a lump the amount of which should not exceed something in the neighbourhood o± I £100,000.” f 6. The Persian demand for the evacuation of Henjam was not pressed I during the succeeding months, and as a result of the difference of opinion between I the Foreign Office and the India Office regarding the expediency of resuming the I treaty negotiations at all, the foregoing suggestion regarding the Bushire Residency remained in abeyance until August 1933. It was then taken up at res by the Foreign Office, but it was found that there were insuperable objections to the proposal. Not only was it clear that there would be embarrassing ditticulties about showing such a lump-sum payment in the public accounts; but the India Office, on further consideration, were unable to agree to the proposal even in principle, and apart from these mechanical difficulties. They took the line that while in the financial conditions then obtaining the estimated cost of the transier of the Residency was prohibitive, they saw no necessity to pay even a part of this sum in order to avoid the transfer; the Persian Government had shown no disposi- [9524] FAll sums of money awarded by the tribunal on account of any claiDTshaF paid to the High Contracting Party by whom the claim is made on a date to agreed upon by the High Contracting Parties or m default of any ^ agreement on the day which follows the expiry of twelve months from the dat of the conclusion of the final session of the tribunal. If sums are payable under 28 tion to accept the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government had agreed u move the Residency, and unless they did so it would, tne India Office thought, be\ possible and preferable to prolong indefinitely the existing position of the Resident letting the question drop as far as the tieaty was concerned, fhe proposed abolition of the treaty of 1841 would create no new situation, since that treaty was in all probability to be regarded as already invalid (cf. the notes attached to Article III bis, above), and the Resident had for several years past performed, as far as his Persian sphere was concerned, no more than the ordinary functions of a Consul-General. He was not more often visited at Bnshire by British warships than his consular successor would be m the event of the Residency being transferred to Bahrein, and when he proceeded to the Arabian coast he ocnerally embarked in a mail steamer at Bushire, transferring at sea to a Britishwarship. Provided, therefore, that the general right of consular repre sentation enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government under article 9 of the treaty of 1857 were preserved (see in this connexion paragraph 12 of the notes to Article III bis), the India Office saw no reason why the Residency should not be maintained indefinitely at Bushire. . 7. In discussing this question the Foreign Office gave it as their view that, notwithstanding the separation between the functions of the Resident in his Persian and Arabian spheres of activity, the Persian Government would in practice have a reasonable case if they should at any time choose to object to the continued presence of the Resident in their territory. There was no exact parallel elsewhere, since, although the functions of the Resident on the Arabian coast might technically be described as tc representative,” it was well known that in practice they were very far from corresponding to ordinary consular or diplomatic duties. Since, however, there had been various indications that the Persian Government had lost interest in the question, it was decided that Sir R. Hoare should, if possible, let the whole matter drop out of the treaty negotiations, and that, if the Persians themselves raised the question, he was merely to remind them that the conditions already communicated to them for the transfer of the Residency represented the minima desiderata of His Majesty’s Government.

VvHITEHALL, 3.W. 1. 4th January 1934. Ivly dear George, idany thanks for your letter of 28th October, No. E. 6014/1329/34, about the provisional draft of the general Treaty instructions to be given to Hoare. The Foreign Office have since seen the Government of India's telegram of 17th November, No.2727, and we observe that the further revise of the instructions to the Minister received by us under Foreign Office letter of 30th November, No. E. 7322/1329/34, proceeds on the assumption that the Secretary of State will share the Government of India’s views on all the points in issue. This is, broadly speaking, correct, but there are various outetanding points v/ith which I deal below. 2 , i now write to say that subject to the observations that follow and to any comments which the Admiralty may have to make on the points oi special interest to them, such as Hen jam, Basidu, visits of ships, etc*, we concur in the draft instructions to Hoare enclosed in Foreign Office letter of 30th November and in the provisional draft of the Treaty attached thereto. For convenience 1 aeal separately in this letter with the draft instructions and with the draft Treaty provisions. 3&gt; As regards the draft instructions, our coirments are as follows:- G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, 3.W. 1. (a)/£ (a) Paragraph 2 . We concur in this paragraph on the assumption that it is agreed that our rights at Basidu shall he surrendered as part of a satisfactory general Treaty settlement, and that H.M.G. will he content with a ''gentleman’s agreement' at Henjam. The Admiralty will no douht develop in greater detail trie question of the special conditions, if any, to he required of the Persian Government at Henjam in this event. (h) Paragraph 10 . 7/e will write separately about the Duzdap Bailway, your latest proposals on which were sent to the Government of Inaia by the air mail of 22nd December. (c) Paragraph 12 . As you will see below, we are prepared to agree, in the light of trie Government of India’s views, to give Hoare discretion in the matter of the balance of the Debt. But India are equally interested in this matter with the Treasury and we suggest, uli6*eioie, the following modifications in paragraph Is of one a raft instructions: Line 2 'His Ivhjesty’s Government H -— • of India . ' Line 4 'without prior reference to me pri^to^he k —— Pr overnment of Inaia. 1 Line 7 'in which the suggestion^ wlth^ ~ Secretary of state xor Inuia ,aa rpm.^&gt; is iiiaue. 4 . articles oi Treaty . (I comment on those only on which any specific question arises). (a) Article T and Annex . As regards Koweit, etc. we note the views expressed in paragraphs ^ oO 6 of your of 28th October. I deal with the question of Bahrein unaer Article VII below. We would see no objection to your suggestion that the words 'une tierce puissance quelcomue*might he substituted ior the words 'une autre puissance Quelconque', though in the light of the explanation contained in your letter it seems harcily necessary* (b) article III * This is one of the Articles which is primarily of concern to the Admiralty and our concurrence in it is subject to any comments they may mak e. We agree with the Government of India that it is unnecessary to consider the question of altering the title of the Royal Indian Marine unless and until the Indian Navy Bill is passed. (c) /yrtide III bis * In the light of the Government of India* s views we are prepared to agree to tne procedure proposed in the Foreign Office letter of 27th September 1932, No. E. 3889/2355/34. (d) Article IV . Hen.iam. This is, of course, subject to what has been said above in relation to paragraph 2 of the draft instructions. (e) Article V . HasMu . Our concurrence in this article is, of course, on the assumption stated ai-ov.,, in relation to paragraph 2 of the instructions. (f) Article VI . The position in regara to thxs i» covered by paragraph 8 of the instructions to Hoare. (g) Article VII - Bahrein . We have careiully considered the suggestion put forward in your letter of 51st October, No.E. 6512/4444/34. £,rlma facle there is, of course, a good aeal to be said, xirstly, xo, reducing possible points of difference between us and Persia over individual provisions of the Treaty so far as possible, and secondly, having regard to the importance from Me Persian standpoint of the specific abandonment of tneir claim/claim to Bali rein which we are anxious to secure in the ' Treaty, for sweetening the pill 11 we can. Further, if Article I and the Notes appended thereto are, as we understand, sufficient to establish beyond question the recognition by Persia of the independence etc. of the other Arab sheikhdoms on the Persian Coast, it is arguable that that ought to be adequate in the case of Bahrein. On the other hand, as you point out, the abandonment of Article VII ’would mean that we should lose the provision regarding most favoured nation treatment, which, having regard to the ill-treatment of Bahreinis in Persia in recent years, it may be of considerable importance to* retain. Moreover, it seems on the whole desirable, since so much has been made of the Persian claim to rah re m, to have it expressly and specifically disposed of in a separate article of the treaty. Accordingly after balancing the considerations carefully we should prefer to retain Article VII. (h) article VIII . It is, I think, common ground between us that it would be necessary to exempt me lighthouse staff at Tamb from Persian customs dues, and visas in the event of the island being leased to Persia, and the draft of 50th November covers the point. ie note the views on the question of the lease expressed in paragraph 9 of your letter of asthrOctober. As regards ^ne point in connection with this Article raised in paragraph 10 of your letter of 28th October, we attach great Importance to establishing positively Trucial sovereignty over Tamb and Abu Musa and therefore certainly could not agree to cutting out this provision in order to save the Persian face. We also think that it should be retained in tne position it occupies, i-e. in the second sentence^of- - the article itself ana not he relegated to an exchange of,notes in order to distract attention from it Cthough we quite appreciate what you say as to the Dinaing character of notes). We have never oeen very satisfied with the first sentence of the article wmcn is entirely lacking ho precision and merely perpetuates a status quo that Is in some cases indeterminate, hut the second sentence to some extent redeems the article. (i) Article XI . p-^.dap -Railway,. We will write separately to you about tiiio. (j) XII .

Lascelles has, I understand, discussed this question with you orally, and the resulting section of Hoare’s draft treaty instructions, and the corresponding section of the treaty memorandum, have I think met with your (provisional) concurrence. It will be convenient, however, to set down in writing the view we take of this problem. £. In the first place we recognize the insuperable practical difficulties to the proposal that we should offer Persia, as the price of a treaty article covering the Residency, some part of the cost which the transfer of the Residency would entail. In consequence, we also agree that the only course open / to rf'Na'XIW O CT KIT r?rV A IP ftj *• Laithwaite, Esq. COPY SENT l MAIL n ' COPY SENT TOto us is to let the question of the Residency drop out of the treaty if possible. In our view it would be worse than useless to press the Persians for a brand new treaty article on this subject without offering them any quid pro quo , and we know that there is no quid pro quo . 3. Indeed, we think it would be positively dangerous to do so. For we should be displaying anxiety as to the security of the present position, and the Persians, seeing therein a bargaining asset, would be determined to make the most of it in the hope of extracting a quid pr o quo. Having none to offer, we should end by having merely cast doubt on the present position. 4 . That position, as we see it, is pretty safe. On the basis of our general right of consular representation (which, as you will see, is to be preserved by a special exchange of notes referring to Article III bis) the Persians could not, we hold, deny our general right to appoint any one we Imie asa consular officer at Bushire. We quite agree with the view expressed at the end of paragraph 7 of Walton's letter that it is highly unlikely that the Persians would declare that Bushire is a place where no foreign consul shall he stationed. There is, however, one other course which would probably be open to them if they, for any reason, made up their minds to go to extreme lengths in order to prevent the Consul-General at Bushire being the same person as the Besident; viz. they could exercise their right to refuse the issue of an exequatur to any individual nominee without giving any reason. It would, however, be very drastic to block all our appointments to the post of Consul-General at Bushire in this way, and we think the chances of the Persians trying it on are most remote, unless something were done on our side to make the Persians positively determined to get rid of the Resident from Bushire. Even so we should certainly have grounds for raising strong objection to such a proceeding and could, if the question 'were submitted to some tnird party, put up an arguable case to the effect that it was unreasonableof the Persians to object to one of our Consular Officers performing other duties outside Persia. 5. We are, then, strongly of the opinion that tactically the right course is most carefully to avoid raising the question of the Residency in any form.\ IWDlk OFFICE, TOIIEEALL, $ P.Z.6392/33 o .W.l. and Immediate. 9tli October, 1933 My dear George, Many thanks for your letter of the 5th October, ho.E.5913/1329/34, enclosing the provisional draft of the general treaty instructions to be given to Hoare. Broadly speaking, the draft seems to us to be excellent, and subject to the points dealt with below, and to any comment which the Government of India may have to make on the Du a dap Railway (as to which Walton is writing to you separately) and on the terms of the Preamble, and Articles I and III bis, we do not think that the Secretary of State is likely to see any objection to it. As regards consultation with the Government of India we appreciate your anxiety for an immediate decision; and it is, of course, the case, that save on a very few points the draft treaty in the stage which it has now reached is essentially based on consultation with them and has their concurrence. But while generally speaking we / G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., FOREXGH OFFICE, b • W * 1 •we should feel able to reconmend acceiotance of the draft (with the modifications, suggested below) without further reference to them, we think it desirable to give them an opportunity to comment. We have therefore sent them a copy of your draft by this week’s air mail, under the letter of which I enclose a copy and will follow it up with a telegram with a view to reducing delay to a minimum. £* I deal firstly with the draft despatch, in which we would recommend concurrence subject to the following comments. Para.5. We understand that in referring to possible difficulties in connection with the issue of the Exequatur, you have in mind the risk that the Persians might refuse their Exequatur to our Consul- General at Bushire without giving any specific reason, (which under international practice they m&amp;y not be required to give) but in fact on the ground, as ciiey would probably admit in unofficial discussions, that he also held what amounted to an administrative post (as. Resident). Walton’s letter of the 14th September, P.g.5469/33, suggested that a treaty article providing for the retention of the Residency at Bushire migxm be dispensed/3 dispensed with, provided that it is clear n that the Persians could not object to our having a Consul- General at Bushire merely because he held another capacity ..... 11 and stated that the India Office would desire to be very sure that the right of consular establishment is sufficient to ensure continuance of present arrangements at Bushire. In view of the risk to which the Foreign Office draw attention we have thought it best to consult the .Government of India. I enclose copy of a telegram which has been sent go them. If the Government ox India snouxd consider that the risk is too serious to take we may have to make some other suggestions (possibly to aim at an exchange of notes regarding the subject). Meanwhile we suggest the omission of the last four lines of this paragraph of the draft despatch, and the addition oi the words : 11 But I may have to telegraph further instructions on this subject after the Government ox India 1 s views have been obtained. 4. Para. 6 . I am writing separately to Lasceiles about the Foreign Office redraft of the Preamble and Article X. Tie are provisionally disposed to suggest that in the Preamble the word 'I'Inde' substituted for the words 'les Indes', should be and that the words/4 words ”ou suzeraineti” should he omitted in the last paragraph of Article I. These* however, are relatively minor points. 5 . I may perhaps put on record (in connection with our recent discussion about Koweit) that the risk that the terms of Article I and the Notes to he attached thereto might preclude us from establishing a protectorate over one of the States named should we later desire to do so, was discussed in 1930 in connection with various drafts then under consideration, all of which involved an undertaking by both parties ,T respecter l 1 integrity territorial© et 1 1 independence de 1 *autre H.P.C.”, and which covered the Gulf States (cp: Foreign Office letter of 17th April 1930, E.1896/143/34j Walton’s letter to you of 12th December, 1930 No .P.Z.6916/30; and Warner’s letter of 29th December, 1930 E.6762/143/34 ) x The Foreign Office appear to have been satisfied that no risk was. involved, and we assume that they remain ox this opinion. The point was also discussed in connection with Article YU of the draft Treaty in Foreign Office letter E.2632/1453/34 of 15th June 1932. 6 * Para.7. As you know, we have referred Article III bis to the Government of India. Para. 10. We have always regarded it as essential to/ 7.Cm' &gt; 5, to secure a formal recognition in the Treaty of the status of lamb, and of Ahu Musa, in the terms of the present draft Article VIII. If the Persians wish to couple their recognition of the Jowasimi ownership of Tamb with a- lease of trie Island on the bheilch’s conditions vre should see no objection so long as the Sheikh’s conditions 'were met, and the point about the lignthouse to which reference is made in Lascelles 1 memorandum was covered. But we are no c anxious to encourage chem uo do so and the draft as it stands tends to go farther than we should like. We should therefore like to propose the following redraft:- ’’The position as regards Article VIII, Tamb, Abut Musa and Sirri, is still as described in the relevant part of the Memorandum. Formal recognition by Persia in the Treaty of the Jowasimi ownership 03 - Temp and Abu Musa is one of the essential desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. If, however, tne Persian Government should desire to revive the question of leasing Tamb, subsequent to their recognition 01 its status, from the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, His Majesty’s Government while not anxious to encourage the Persian Government to adopt this course, would in such circumstances see no objection to it, subject to acceptance by the Persian Government of the conditions laid down oy the/the Sheikh and to a special provision of the nature referred to in paragraph 4 on page 30 of the Memorandum in connect ion with the maintenance of the lighthouse. They consider, however, that it should he left to the Persian Government to raise this question.” 8 . Para.11&gt; Walton is writing separately to you about the Dundap Railway• 9- Para.14. Page 12. This paragraph makes no reference to one important additional concession, viz • the abandonment of the balance of the War and post-War debt. As you know there has been discussion in the past as to whether the Minister should be authorised to offer this concession, subject to the concurrence of the Government or India and oi tne Treasury. It is for consideration whether it might not now be possible to give Sir R. Hoare discretion in regard to it in return for a satisfactory settlement on the other points in issue. 10. I no 7 f turn to the individual Articles of the Treaty, the position in regard to which is set out in the Appendix to the despatch. 'The Preamble and Articles X, Illbis XV, VIII, XI, and XII are covered by the remarks above. We have no comment on Articles I 1 , V,// 7. V, VI, VII, ex-Art. XIV, XV, or XVI, and assume that the Admiralty will examine Article III, which, so far as wo can judge, is the best we can do if lioare finds it impossible to persuade the Persians to agree to simple notification. But please see in connection with this article the reference in paragraph 6 (c) of Walton*s letter of 7th October to Praser Tytler to the possibility that the ’R.I.M . 1 may become the 3 Indian Navy.* 11. Ex-Article IX. Would you see any objection (we do not press the suggestion) to restoring a reference t in the Draft Treaty to lighting and buoying, perhaps m the shape of a two-line Article to the general effect that the H.C. parties will deal with lighting and buoying by means of a separate agreement. The inserting of some reference in the Treaty might make it easier to obtain the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board project, or if this fails, or we decide for any reason to let it drop, make it easier to press the Persians at a later stage to agree to coordination of lighting and buoying arrangements in the half. And it is conceivable that the discussion which a iraft article in these toms would produce with Peroughi night give Hoare an opportunity to ascertain on what line their minds were now moving, in the light of the infection they will by now have received from the French lighting and buoying expert. 12 ./8 . is. Article X„ Slavery. It is perhaps rather late in the day to make any alteration, hut we should like to make one suggestion which appears to he really only a matter of drafting viz. the omission in Article I of the Protocol of the words u de 1 T esclavage', The Convention of 1882 deals with the traffic in slaves: The words referred to do not appear in the draft Treaty or the Preamble to the Protocol, hoth of which merely refer to n la traite des esclaves n j the whole protocol only deals with the Slave trade on the waters of the Gulf (including territorial waters) and the words lI de 1 ’esclavage” in Article 1 accordingly seem superfluous, while thereis perhaps the danger that their insertion might give the Persians an excuse for claiming an interest m anti-slavery measures in the territories of the Sheikhs on the Arab Coast, which might prove embarrassing. yg. Ar ticle XIII. As you will see from the letter to Fraser-Tytler enclosed, we have asked the Government of India whether they concur in this Article in its present, form, and are prepared to give the undertaking which the ' Foreign Office and Treasury desire. 14. X am sending copies of this letter to Moore, Grieve Parkinson, Harris, Toovey, and Bowyer. ^ r» i M-rowMTE.Air Mail, OF INDIA OFFICE, ' P.Z.6392/33 ™‘ EHALL ’ S ' W ' 1 i 7th October, 1933. JU^/ ryp / i / b I enclose a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office covering a provisional draft of instructions to be given to Hoare as regards the resumption of the Treaty negotiations with Persia, together with a very valuable appendix showing the position in July of this year on the various Articles of the draft Treaty. We have not yet been able to take instructions here on the provisioned draft, but I enclose copy of a draft reply to the Foreign Office which we are submitting for approval,/which is, I think, self-explanatory. The future of Henjaxn, about which I wrote to you in my air mail letter of 22 nd September, No.P.Z.6051/33, is for discussion in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Tuesday, 10th October, and the result of that discussion may be to necessitate a further alteration of the instructions. But in view of the urgency of the matter (as Hoare is due to leave on the llth October) I think it well to send you these papers or W.K.Fraser-Tytler, C.M.G. ,M.C., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, NEW DELHI. at/- 2 - (rft\ at once and will follow up this letter with a telegram when we have been able to take orders here. 2. The Government of India have of course been throughout kept in close touch with all developments in connection with the Treaty, and the instructions on which Clive and Hoare have in the past conducted their negotiations with the Persians were based so far as^were directly concerned on discussion with the Government of India and the India Office. A number of the Articles in the draft Treaty in these circumstances call for no comment. On certain others (such as the Bushire Residency) we have felt sufficiently sure of the view of the Government of India to feel justified in expressing agreement to the Foreign Office without waiting for your formal concurrence. But there are one or two points on which there have been recent developments as a result of which we should be grateful if the Government of India would indicate their view. 3, The general line of the draft despatch to Hoare is, I think, satisfactory so far as we are concerned. Such criticisms as we have on it are contained in the draft to Rend el now enclosed. As I have mentioned above, the reference to Henjam (paragraph 3) must for the moment be provisional/- 3 - provisional. The question of docking facilities in India (paragraph 4 ) is one which can in existing circumstances well be let drop. On the question of the removal of the Residency (paragraph 5) the Foreiga Offi C e } a S you will see, have adopted the suggestion made after consulting Fowle in my demi official letter to Warner of 14th September No.P.Z.5469/33, of which copies were sent you by the air mail of 16th September, and are prepared to instruct the Minister that the question should, if at all possible, be allowed to drop. In this case a special article would be dispensed with, but there seems no reason to apprehend that difficulty should arise in view of the fact that the Resident’s, position in Persia would be covered by his status as Consul-General, We have assumed that the Government of India will see no objection to the proposed method of dealing with the case, but if they do will you please telegraph. As regards the substantive question Oj. leaving or staying at Bushire neither the Government oi India nor the Secretary of State have ever in the past been enthusiastic about removal of the Residency, ii this could be avoided, and while there are certain obvious advantages in its location on the Arab shore the expenditure which would be involved is in present financial conditions/- 4 - conditions a very strong argument against making any change unless this is quite inevitable. In these circumstances we have assumed, in the light of the views previosuly expressed by the Government of India, that they would share our view on this point. 4. I deal below with Article- I and Article III bis of the Treaty (paragraphs 6 and 7 of the draft despatch). The arrangements^for the preservation of our most-favoured nation rights and of the right of consular representation set out in paragraph 8 of the^despatch, ..are pPi&amp;pM&amp;i- to some extent consequent on my demi official letter to Foreign Office of 14th September, No.P.Z.5469/33, to which reference is made above. The arguments for them are obvious. a, As regards the wireless stations at Henjam, etc., the Government of India have already agreed to the transfer of the wireless apparatus at Bushire and Lingah and Ox the station at Henjarn as part of a satisfactory treaty settlement. The alteration now proposed by the Foreign Office in paragraph 9 of the draft instructions is merely consequential on the proposal to abandon one Henjam Protocol. We see no objection to ohe dra^t Instructions on this point and have assumed mat the Government/- 5 - Government of India will share our view. As regards Tamb (paragraph 10) as you will see,^suggest/# to the Foreign Office a redraft of this paragraph of the despatch. We are sending you a separate express letter by to-day's mail as regards the Duzdap Railway (paragraph 11 ). The question of claims (paragraph 12 ) is dealt with below under Article XIII of the draft Treaty. 6 . I now turn to points arising out of the draft Treaty which may be thought uo call ior special consideration: (a) Preamble and Article Please see on this the demi official letter from the Foreign Office, No.E.4444/4444/34, dated 18th September 1933 , of which copies were sent by the air mail of 23rd September. At the moment we are rather disposed to uhijiK that it would be preferable to substitute for the words . 'les Indes' in the fifth line from the end of the Preamble, the words '1'Inde', and, in the last paragraph of Article I, to amend the revised draft enclosed in the foreign Office letter of 23rd September by the omission of the words 'ou suzerainete'. The Indian States will be sufficiently covered by the comprehensive phrase 'I'lnde'. I will telegraph further on this point when the matter has been more/-more closely considered, tnit sub ject to such further consideration and to any comment by the Government of India we would propose to accept the Foreign Office redraft. (b) As regards the Annex to Article I , please see paragraph 5 of the draft to the Foreign Office enclosed. ( c ) Article III . This Article is of interest primarily to the Admiralty. It is, of course, proposed that we should put forward the text now suggested only after one more effort has been made to secure acceptance of ”simple notification”. There is however one small point. I gather that there is some possibility that, if conditions seem favourable for this, a Bill for the establ is lament of an Indian Navy may be introduced in the Indian Legislature in the fairly near future; and that if such a Bill were to be passed the title of the Royal Indian Marine would be altered to Indian Navy. For the moment, however, it seems clear that we must continue to refer to it as the Royal Indian Marine. If the Treaty negotiations drag, it will, if necessary, be possible to send supplementary instructions to Hoare on this point. Do you agree? (d) Article III bis .

There has never been much prospect of securing any payment from Persia in respect of the War and post-War non-interest bearing debt. We have informed the Persians that in return Aor a satisfactory Treaty settlement we are prepared to remit £ 1 , 000,000 of the oustanding balance of £1,510,000, but we have not committed ourselves as regards the odd £510,000. The Government of India and the Secretary of State were in the past prepared, as were the Treasury, to agree that the Persians should be informed at an appropriate juncture, that we were ready to remit the balance if, as a re suit # we could obtain a satisfactory Treaty settlement. The Foreign Office are very anxious to give the Minister as full a discretion as possible and it is conceivable tnat it may be desired to give him authority to make use of this further concession, especially since, as you will see from paragraph 14 of the draft instructions, he vilx net have too muck to negotiate with, so many of our concessions having been given away in advance. Perhaps the/- 9 - loOO the Government of India could telegraph whether they would agree, assuming that the Treasury also agree, to giving Hoare an immediate discretion on this point, ( n ) Article XiH , Claims, The position in regard to this Article is set out in the Appendix to the draft instructions. Would you in this connection please refer to ipy air mail letter of 2nd September 1932, No.P.Z,4732/32, to the Government of India, and to the Government of India’s telegram of 28th September 1932, No,2160? Consequent on that telegram we had further demi-official correspondence with the Treasury and the Foreign Office. The general effect of the correspondence was to show that there was apparently no record of any Persian claim against an Indian which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of the draft Article if this were .accepted by the Persians, but that there was apparently one small claim by an Indian ('the comparatively unimportant exception 1 ' mentioned in Metcalfe’s demi official letter of 19th May 1932, No,F.19-N/32), being a claim dating from 1905 in respect of the confiscation of certain assafoetida. The Foreign Office, as you will see from their demi official of 20th January 1933, No.E.240/240/34, of which copies/ ! i ► If (- 10 - copies were sent by the sea mail of 26th January, still thought that n it would be preferable, if and when there is a reasonable prospect of resuming the Treaty negotiations, that the Government of India should be requested to assume a contingent responsibility for any such claims (i.e* Persian claims against the Government of India or against a British Indian subject which would not be cancelled by paragraph 1 of t&amp;e draft) as may hereafter be discovered, for its seems unreasonable that such a responsibility, however, remote, should be borne by His Majesty’s Goverrment”. The Treasury, in their demi official of 20th January 1933, No.8.34672/3 (copy by sea mail of 26th January) pointed out that, 'even in the case of a claim by an Indian against a Persian the question of costs might arise. If His Majesty’s Government were put to expense on this account we should expect to be reimbursed by the Government of India.*' ihe risk of any claim by Persians seems in the circumstances described above, negligible. 4 S for claims by Indians the only one which we have been able to trace is that mentioned earlier in this paragraph. In these circumstances it seems unlikely that the Government of India would involve themselves in any substantial financial risk by accepting an/- 11 - an understanding such as the Foreign Office and the Treasury suggest, and I should he grateful if you could let us know whether they would he prepared to agree to it. The present text of the draft Article is as shown in the appendix to the Foreign Office demi official of 5th October. Could you also say whether you concur in the present text of paragraph 3 of Article XIII? (o) Articles XIV, X¥ and JVl of the Treaty raise no fresh point. 7. While we should of course welcome any comment which the Government of India may care to offer on the draft Treaty, the only points on which we have felt unable finally to commit ourselves pending an expression of their views are those referred to in paragrapn 6 (a), (a;, (i) &gt; (m) and (n) above, on which we should be grateful il you could telegraph as early as possible. Perhaps you would also let us know whether you agree as regards tne point referred to in paragraph 6 (c). Vofirs RtV»&lt;5«Wjfy. (34.) J, C. WALTON.&lt;Y .4 ^ Cei -h+ri^ P.Z. 546 9/33.

O 'w/ *• .. - ■■ . 2 . We have been turning over in our minds this question of the Residency. As you know, both the Government of India and the India Office would be very reluctant to see the headquarters of the Resident moved from Bushire,and ( in the present financial stringency the cost of removing nis headquarters to the Arab shore is a well nigh conclusive argument against it. In these circumstances, we should be Quite happy if all question of removal lap sect, and we nave been wondering whether tnere is really any reason «n~y in fact it should not be quieuly allowed to drop when the geiiOj. al newotiations are resumed. K.A.Warner Esq., FOREIGN OFFICE. (i ►9 ^ • 3. I asked Fowls for his views on this, and showed him the Appendix to your Treaty Collection regarding the question of the removal of the Political Residency from Eushire. Fowle has given me the note of which I enclose ri fith September' TPoo .11 ) a copy. The position resulting from past negotiation with the Persians on the subject apparently is that they would be unlikely to agree to the conditions of removal proposed in the draft exchange of Notes annexed to Clive's letter uo Feroughi of 1st October 1930. We, on the other hand, would be unable to agree to removal without these conditions. Moreover, it seems doubtful whether the Persians attach much importance to removal (compare the paragraph regarding Eushire in Hoare's telegram No.19 Saving of 23rd July,1932). 5 t The question seems really, as suggested in Fowle s note, to have boiled down now to little more than a matter of nomenclature. There is no reason why our Political Resident in the Persian C-ulf and Consul-General at Bushire should be known as anything more than Consul-General at Eushire in any matters that concern, or come within the cognisance of, the Persians. There are really two distinct posts, which are doubled in the person of the same ° ffice g r *3. So far as the Persians are concerned, he is a Consul-General in Persia, and his duties as Resident lie on the opposite side of the Gulf. Letters to him either from here or elsewhere are no longer addressed to him as n Resident ,, nor at the 'Residency'. Presumably the Persians could not object to one of our Consuls-General performing, during part of his time, duties of another nature with which Persia is not concerned, and of which she need take no cognisance, or to his leaving his consular post occasionally in connection with those other duties. You will see from Fowle’s note that this latter practice does not involve visits of His Majesty’s ships to Bushire. The position seems to be analogous to that of a foreign Consul or diplomat commissioned or accredited to two countries A &amp; B but normally resident in only one of them. Country A is not concerned with what he does in regard to B, nor vice versa . Moreover Teymourtache's suggestion cited in page 2 of the Appendix referred to above seems to indicate that the Persians do not object to the Resident's political business being transacted by correspondence from Bushire nor to visits from there to $ ii4. the Arab coast. g ^ further question which has occurred to us is whether or not in these circumstances it is necessary even to have a special treaty article in order to ensure that the headquarters of the officer performing the functions of Consul-General and Resident continue to be at Bushire . Since, so far as the Persians are concerned, this officer is simply Consul General, it might appear that the treaty position is sufficiently secured by whatever provision exisus for the establishment and recognition of consular officers m Persia. The existing provision is apparently Art.9 of the Treaty of Peace of 4th March, 1857; if the proposed new Commercial Treaty with Persia goes through, we shall presumably have provision in that treaty (see Art.21 of the draft showing the position of the negotiations in November, 1929). In order to secure our rights of consular establish ment in Persia, I suppose it will in any event be essential either to make sure that we get a commercial treaty, providing such rights, simultaneously with the general treaty/5. 9 treSvty, or else to keep alive Art.9 of the Treaty of 4th March 1857 (unless there is some later treaty providing for consular representation which I have overlooked). Provided, however, that it is clear that we have the right of consular establishment and that the Persians could not object to our having a Consul-General at Bushire merely because he held another capacity, or for any other reason, then the question which has occurred to rne, is whether there is really any necessity for an article in the general treaty providing for the continuance of the headquarters of the Political Resident at Bushire. If it were thought that we could maintain the status mi at Bushire without such an reducing our des 'balance sheet' article, this would have the advantage oi iderata by one and somewhat adjusting the in our favour. But, of course, from the India Office point of view we should desire that the right of Consular Establishment is to be very sire sufficient to ensure continuance of present arrangements at Busnix e• right rests on a most favoured nation basis. Iu hardly seems/6 . seems likely however that the Persians could get rid of our Consul-General (and '’Resident') by declaring Bushire to be a place at which they do not receive any foreign Consuls, To make sure of excluding him/by such a device they would have to close the whole of their littoral to foreign Consuls. 8. The method of dealing with the Persians on the Residency question during the negotiations is largely a matter of tactics, on which Hoare will best be able to decide. - Perhaps he might tacitly assume that the question of removal has dropped out of the picture. Or perhaps he might bring the Persians to repeating their objections to the conditions on which we offered to remove the Residency t and thereupon suggest to them that, as these conditions would be indispensable to us, the question of removal should lapse, possibly in addition pointing out to them that the changes of name and practice which have already been adopted (as explained in Fowle’s note) have for practical purposes solved the question in a manner which is on the lines of Teymourtache ’s suggestion and which we presume to be agreeable to Persia. Something of this sort might perhaps prepare the ground for a treaty article providing lor the Resident/ ' !i u y d 1 ik /mResident working from headquarters at Bushire, if. such an article is considered necessary to safeguard the position. 9. As regards the question of giving Persia £100,000 in return for continuance of the Residency at Bushire,we - , as you know, have always seen great difficulties in the way of this proposal. Our Secretary of State doubts whether we ought in any circumstances to give the Persians this sum, and there are obvious difficulties both as to finding the money (I think it is almost useless to hope that the (Government of India will agree), and as to the outward form that would be given to the deal. When published - as I suppose it would have to be, even if contained in an exchange of Notes - it would look very odd (would it not? ) and be very open to criticism, whether it was designated as a consideration for some quid icrQ. quo, from Persia such an permission for the Resident to remain at Bushire, or whether it was thrown in as a general makeweight in the negotiations. Altogether, the obstacles look so insuperable that subject to the views of the Foreign Office and/8. and ‘Treasury it hardly seems worth while to pursue the idea. 10. As regards the other points mentioned in your letter, we will look into the question of Art.Ill bis and the claims article as soon as possible, and we agree with the solution which you suggest in regard to the Henjam wireless station (if Henjam is ultimately settled by a 'C-entleman 1 s agreement') and also with your conclusion that eymourtache ’ s suggestion for a long lease of Tamb need not be pursued further. 11 . Laithwaite looked rapidly through the text and notes in the most valuable treaty compilation of which you gave him a copy. I do not expect we shall have any observations save on the outstanding points, but we will let you know if anything should occur to us. &amp;&amp;.) J. C. WALTOH. m m 3 iMr. Walton, With reference to conversation of yesterday on the subject of the removal of the Residency from / Bushire of which you showed me a precis. My position at ^ushire is in fact simply that of a Consular Officer and not that of a Resident and I have always been \ careful to observe this vis-a-vis the Persian authorities. All my correspondence for instance with the local Governor is conducted on paper headed'K.B.M. Consulate General” and not “Residency”, and is signed as Consul General. Moreover, recently when the Persian postal authorities began plastering my official envelopes addressed “Resident' with the remark that they did not know who this official was, but that they sent it to the Consul General for disposal, with the approval of the Minister I issued a circular to my correspondents to the effect that in-th-e future the envelopes should simply bear the address “Consul General' though the title 'Resident' should be preserved in the enclosures. If the “Residency' is removed to Bahrein or elsewhere there will/will still te a British Consular Officer at Bushire. Presumably he will ha.ve the rank of Consul General a.nd. he will continue to live in the present Residency. With regard to Teymourtache's suggestion put forward at the ( .I* end of paragraph 3 of the precis alluded to above, tnis ^ t^cevC((j is in fact at present^in force. I spend the summer at Bushire and during the winter I tour extensively on the Arab coast. H.M. ships do not constantly visit Busdiire for political consultations with me, though the S.H.O. drops in now and then, and I generally leave Bushire not in a sloop but by the mail, and either proceed direct to my destination in the mail, or am t^nsferred^at sea at some convenient spot to a sloop wM-e-on-the journey. If the Resident was removed from Bushire H.M.ships, as they do at present, would now and then drop in to visit the Consular Officer of that port as they do all over the world. Taking it all round I do not see that the Persians have anything to gam by removal of the Residency and ttee hardly appears to me a very live issue. If theyMr. Walton, In the light of our discussion 1 have talked over the Persian treaty position, and particularlythe Bushire Residency, with Mr. Warner and Mr. Laseelles. I told Mr. Warner that I would throw into the form of a letter our general attitude, as explained to them, on the points in issue, and I attach a draft which perhaps if you approve you would send to the Foreign Office. 2. We agreed for practical purposes that the £100,000 project must he regarded as dead. I think it is quite possible that the Foreign Office may he willing (though reluctantly - the difficulties are not inconsiderable) to reopen the question of the Residency, possibly on the line suggested in the draft, though they are likely to make considerable play with the weakness of our position, etc. if they do so. If you approve of something on the lines of the draft attached, with any modifications or alterations (I shall not have seen it) which you like to strengthen the/tiie argument, the simplest procedure might he that we should send a copy of it to Grieve (and to Parkinson). I do not think the Treasury are any more enthusiastic than we are about the £100,000 and it would make it easier to give that idea its quietus . 3. The most important point is the text of I attach the file on this J.G. LAITHWAITE 1/9/33.aft Paper. political Department DRAFT LITT2R. .F.A. Warner, Esq., Foreign Office hi/ dear Warner, With reference to our telephone conversation arising out of your letter of 31st August, No.£.4896/1329/ 34, about the Persian treaty, I write to say that I am sorry that we have not yet been able to go into all the points raised by you, but that our present attitude on the following is as set out below. Para.3 . (Article III bis). We will go into this. Para.4 . 1 note that you are writing separately to us. Para.5 . Wireless. I agree that the best solution in the event of Henjam being ultimately settled on the basis of a '’gentleman* s agreement” would be an exchange of notes based on Article VIII of the old Protocol, (page.24 of Lascelles* compilation). Para.6 . I have gone rapidly through the texts and notes in Lascelles* compilation. So far as I can see they are entirely accurate, but we will go through them more closely. I am sorry that I have not been able to deal with the Claims Article. . o Para.7/Para*7 . I agree entirely that it is hardly in any circumstances worth pursuing the proposal for a lease of Tamb. There is little prospect of the Sheikh modifying his terms,(nor should we, 1 think, he justified in requiring him to do so), and prohahly equally little prospect of the Persians agreeing to accept them. We might, if this is generally agreed &gt; instruct Hoare that if the Persians revert to the suggestion they should he informed that we are ready to pursue it, hut on the Sheikh* s terms, no modification of which can he considered, and that he should he instructed not to raise it himself. 2. I now turn to the question of the Bushire Residency, which we discussed in considerable*detail. There are two points in issue - the first our present attitude on the question of the Residency generally; the second that of the proposal to pay Persia £100,000 in return for a treaty article which would entitle us to retain the Resident and the Residency at Bushire, and which would represent the money saved consequent on securing this from Persia. 3. we have again gone carefully here into the general question of the position of the Residency. As you know, the 0.of I. and I.o. were always very reluctant to agree to Its/,ft Paper. Department ) Its removal, and while there are admittedly certain advantages in locating it at Bahrein, it is doubtful whether these are decisive, and they are in any case counter balanced at the moment by the very decisive argument that the removal would probably cost £100,000. The Ghof I. are likely to be most reluctant to produce a large sum of money if this can in any way be avoided, and I feel little doubt that the Treasury will feel the same. 4. Now as regards the Persian attitude, we again were never very clear here as to how much real importance was attached by Persia to this point. It was one originally volunteered (if my memory is correct) by Clive and Frederick Johnstone, and quite naturally taken up at once by Teymourtache. But there was little evidence even throughout Teymour's time that it was regarded as in any way a vital matter, and such indications as we have had since Hoare succeeded have gone to confirm our impression that while the Persians would no doubt be glad to sever the Resident's connection with Persia it Iis not a question of life and death |with them. We were, of course, in this/this connection impressed hy the opinion which Hoare expressed at a recent meeting o£ the Middle Mast Committee that the Persians were unlikely,if the worst came to the worst, to try to force the evacuation of the Residency. Finally, Hoare has impressed upon us that the conditions which the X«0* wishes to attach to any removal of the Residency from Persia (and which are matters which are regarded as essential and on which we cannot agree to compromise) are very unfavourably seen hy the Persians, who, indeed, might almost prefer to leave the Residency where it is. 5. We recognise that while the proposal has not been putjforward to the Persians as a final proposal on the part of H.M.G. it might be difficult to refuse to live up to that proposal were the Persians now to Indicate their readiness at once to accept our conditions and to offer us a satisfactory treaty settlement under other heads. But there is nothing to suggest at the moment that they are very likely to alter their attitude, .ve, in these circumstances, would now therefore like to reconsider the question as a whole, and if possible to secure that the idea of a removal of the flesidency is dropped. A/aft Paper. Department 925 5000 6.33 A possible line of tactics (this is of course very tentative) might he that, in regard to the project put forward by sir R. Clive at an earlier stage^the Persians had made it clear that they regarded the conditions subject to which a lone we had intimated our readiness to agree to a removal of the Residency as unsatisfactory and open to objection; that those conditions were, however, essential from our point of view; that the removal would be a nuisance so far as we were concerned and would cost us money; and that, especially as we were waiving the balance of the Persian debt, we did not want to indulge in any expenditure that could be avoided; that the best thing in these circumstances might be to drop the idea altogether. The proposal was one of no particular importance from the Persian point of view and was one which we had ourselves in the first instance volunteered, but which in all the circumstances was probably now hardly worth pursuing; active pursuit of whisk it, indeed, might be misunderstood as meaning that we were mistaken in believing that the general attitude of Persia was one of friendliness and of a desire to avoid friction/friction between our two countries. We could simultaneously offer, in whatever manner Hoare thought best, to consider &amp;ny features in connection with the retention of the Residency at Bushire which the Persians regarded as open to objection. As I explained, letters to the Resident are now addressed to Consul-General' and we are ceasing to use the address '’Residency' and substituting for it 'H.B.M. Consulate- General, Bushire'. On another minor point which might be raised by the Persians, viz, visits of H.M. ships ^to Bushire to take the Resident on his tours of the zirab coast, this, I think, now happens very rarely, the Resident, if I am right, taking the mail to get out of Persian territorial waters and being picked up outside the limits by one of H.M. ships. Subject to what Powle might say there would, I think, be no difficulty in making this an invariable practice. 6. If we abandon the idea of moving the Residency, the alternatives before us would be: (a) to give the Persians no quid pro quo, out merely (as suggested above) to base the abandonment on the fact that our conditions for removal were unsatisfactory to the Persians and/aft Paper. Department o 925 5000 6.33 and that removal was equally a nuisance and an expense to us - in other words to give the Persians no specific quid pro quo for allowing us to remain there; and (h) to make available the sum of £100,000, which it is estimated removal to Bahrein would cost us, either in cash or in kind, as a douceur to Persia. 7. we have thought further about this latter suggestion, and as a result we have come to the conclusion that whether the Residency is to go from Bushire or not, the obstacles to r its adoption are so great that, subject to any views the Treasury may | express, we do not now think it is I 5 worth further serious consideration. I think that I need not perhaps develop the difficulties at any length; but in the first place, the amount is exceedingly small, and while it might make a good bribe for an individual or two individuals, we do not think that it would be likely to ,1 carry any real weight with Persia. Secondly, Parliamentary difficulties may be anticipated. Thirdly, it is not at all unlikely that the Persian^, when confronted with a draft treaty article under which they undertook to I allow/allow the Political Resident (so- styled) to retain his headquarters at Bushire for a further indefinite period, might not take the v\hole question of his position much more seriously than they have ever shown igns of doing so far, with possible unfortunate results from our point of view. There are the further difficulties about actual provision of the sum, neither the G.of I. nor H.M.G. being very likely to greet with much enthusiasm a proposal for a grant in cash, and the facilities which could be granted under a credit a of £100,000 (as distinct froir/cash ayment) being, I should have thought, elatively very limited, subject, therefore, to Grieve*s views on this point we should prefer (much as we regret the reduction by one of potential additions to the balance sheet) that this proposal might be dropped. 8* Henjam. Perhaps I might put on record what I said in reply to a question of yours as to our attitude in regard to a separate settlement covering henjam only. When this matter has been discussed previously we have taken the line that there would be strong objection to a settlement with Persia under which we would give her what we have on our side of the balance sheet in return for/ ^ift Paper- Department for a settlement In respect of Henjam alone. No treaty settlement would te satisfactory from our point of view and that of the G.of I. which did not, in addition to granting us the required facilities at Henjam, dispose of the Persian claim to Bahrein, Thmh and Abu Musa. It is very unlikely that the G.of I. would he prepared to allow the Duzdap Railway to he thrown into a partial settlement which dealt with Henjam only and left these other matters in the air, and it is hy no means improhahle that we should he exposed to Parliamentary criticism on the ground that what we had given in return for Henjam was quite disproportionate to its value. The question you put to me on the telephone was, if I understood it ultimately correctly, whether if Henjam were/to he settled on the basis of a “gentleman’s agreement”, no specific quid pro quo being given in return for it, we would he likely still to see objection to a separate settlement On that I replied that I thought no objection would he seen, and, indeed, there might he considerable advantage in disposing of the question of Henjam, leaving our remaining desiderata/FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. E 4896/1529/34) 31st August, 1933 Dear Laithwaite, J I am hoping to be able to have a word with you before you go off on leave regarding the proposal to pay the Persians a lump sum in return for their consent to the continued maintenance of the Residency form of the treaty article which will be necessary if the scheme goes through, and I enclose a very tentativ draft on which we should be glad to receive your views we might perhaps discuss it at the same time as the general question of the lump sum. The draft has not yet been seen by our legal advisers or by my higher authorities. is perhaps not essential, and could be omitted if the Persians objected, but in view of the fact that the 1' 2 The phrase ’’Notwithstanding ............. 1841” treaty COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL qqpY SENT BY i S*L MAIL s* dthwaite, Esqtreaty will be abrogated, either explicitly or implicitly, in another article of the treaty, it seems on the whole tidier to insert a clause on these lines. As regards the clause providing for free access to Bushire and Reshire, we presume that something of this sort is necessary. Our impression is that at the present time the local Persian authorities allow the Resident free access to Bushire, and generally also to Reshire, as a matter of courtesy, but that in recent years they have occasionally made difficulties about his landing at Reshire owing to the fact that the quarantine officer has to come out specially from Bushire for the purpose. 3. There are as you know a few other outstanding points of treaty drafting. The most important concerns Article III his (abrogation of existing treaties etc): Lascelles has, I understand, had a word with you about this already, and you have promised to look into the questions raised in our letter No. S 3889/2355/54 of the 27th September^ and let us have a reply as soon as4. The precise wording of the last paragraph &gt; ^ of Article I (recognition and non-aggression) has given ?4lr us a certain amount of trouble of late; I am writing to you separately about this* v 5. You will see from the first footnote on page 27 of our latest general treaty compilation (of which Lascelles gave you a copy the other day) that the question of the Henjam wireless station will need looking into now that it has been decided that the Henjam protocol should be replaced by a 'gentleman’s agreement' in general terms. It would, we think, be unsuitable, and might anyhow prove difficult, to include an adequate provision regarding the wireless station in the body of the treaty article which is to constitute the 'gentleman’s 'agreement', and we think that the best solution would be an exchange of notes based on article 8 of the old \ &lt;yvv js protocol: do you agree? 6. Assuming that you have no comments to make regarding the accuracy of the texts and accompanying notes in our treaty compilation, the only other outstanding point appears to be the claims article, the present position'y position of which is set forth fairly fully in the compilation in question. May we take it that you concur, subject to reconsideration in the light of the result of our detailed examination of the files, in the text given at *C* on pages 59 - 62 of the treaty compilation? We are doing what we can to expedite the completion of the examination, but it is a long and complicated business. 7. As regards Tamb and Teymourtache’s suggestion for a long lease, the fact that we no longer contemplate an arrangement involving a lease of Henjam seems to render the suggestion hardly worth pursuing further: do you agree? MaJlA— 11o v. 7 r' t- % r v) ^ O 1933 Inclosure IQraft Article re^arlir^ the iusliire Re sid-ane^:- jNotwithstanding the abrogation, by virtue of Article III bis of the present Treaty, of the ai^Io-P ersian Commercial Treaty of the ESth October 1641, His Imperial Majesty the Shah consents that for the duration of the present treaty tne British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should continue to have his head quarters at Bushire, and should tnjpy unrestricted access to that port and to Resnire.I the ^iitical Residency from Bushire. At no period have the Persians definitely demanded the removal of the Residency from Persian soil; but in many informal discussions with dir R. Clive, Teyinourtache made it quite clear tnau his Government regarded the Residency as one of those regret table survivals which stood in the way of a general improvement in unglo-Persian relations. .eventually, therefore, His Majesty's Government and the Government of India gave their consent, in principle and subject to certain important conditions, to the -evoiitual* transfer of the Residency as part of a general settlement. In September 1950 Sir R. Olive, in the hope of reviving and clinching the treaty negotiations at a moment when they seemed on tne point of breaking down, spontaneously suggested to Feroughi the possibility of a concession^ subject to these conditions, and Loliowed up his suggestion, by the letter of which the relevant )art is annexedo Briefly, the proposal was for an exchange of ■otes in which His Majesty’s Government would announce, on the ■onclusion of the General treaty, their decision to remove the .esidency to a site outside Persia as soon as the necessary rrangements could be made and provided that the Resident were llowed unrestricted access on all occasions to British consular ■ )sts Persian ports of the Gulf; and the Persian Government i their turn, would signify their acceptance of the conditions 'tached to this decision. Owing to the ensuing break-down of the negotiations, the rsian Government never '’reacted” to this proposal save in the rm of a brief and vague expression of thanks on the part of Feroughi/ J :i hlAll’ ot mA 1 *(i^ v.

On taat occasion Teymourtache made it clear that he regarded the indefinite continuance of the present arrangements as a lesser evil than the removal of the Residency coupled with the conditions which had been proposed, i.e. that the Resident should have the unrestricted right to tour the south Persian consulates from a base outside Persia. He put forward a new suggestion of his own, to the effect that the Resident might spend the summer at Bushire and the rest of the year on the Arab coast provided that while at Rushire his political functions in matters relating to the Arab sheikhdoms were performed by correspondence and did not entail constant visits of His Majesty's Ships for political consultations. i -Uon -nrvf irpt 'been fully consid-snod 'by His This last proposal has not yet oeen ,y , , -w +hp-po are certain obvious objections.

My dear Walton, As I told you in my letter Ko• E•6158/208/34 of the 23rd Koremher, we asked Hoare on the 22nd the grounds on which he based his hope that we might after all be able to secure the retention of the Political Residency at Bushire • 2, He has now replied, m we had anticipated, that on M3 hopes are based, not/any definite statement, hut on the general impression which he has gained regarding the attitude of the Persian Government in general, and of Tevmourtache in particular* He points out that while Teynourtaehe recently declared the conclusion ol the treaty tc be impossible in view of our refusal to offer compensation for the renunciation of the Persian claim to Balnein, he appears nevertheless to he still anxious to negotiate, and this seems to indicate that the Shah is personally determined to have a treaty, hut also determined to get something for Bahrein. Hoaxe believes, in fact, that the Minister of Court is still now, as he was at the time of Hoare's despatch Ho.258 of the 23rd May (sent to you in ouj. letter S.2733/208/34 of the 16th June) casting about for any face-saving solution which will enable him to fnrfil the apparently irreconcilable wishes of ms master; and, since, to judge by the conversation recorded in Tehran despatch Ho .146 of the 23rd March - (see my letter Ho.M .1672/636/34 of the 29th April to Donaldson) - the Persians seem to feel much less strongly than they used to about the Residency, he thinks that the bargain which he has suggested may prove just the face-saver which Isymourtache requires , while costing His Majestyts Government nothing. much less n, Esq *, C*B .,*0 •T9X &gt; f’ 1 r V 3. As you know, we at the Foreign Office feel strongly that the suggestion that we should pay the Persians a lump sum of £100,000, if we can thereby get a satisfactory treaty settlement including the retention of the Hssidency at Bush ire is worth investigating further. Hoare is, after all, in a better position than anyone else to gauge the temper of the Persians, and, although his theory about the Residency admittedly rests on an uncertain foundation, we hope that you will not on that account decline to pursue the matter further with the Government of India and the Treasury* The financial bargain is one which it would be definitely in the interests of His Majesty*s Government to conclude, and even if Hoare is mistaken in his belief that the Persians would welcome it, we think that the possibility should at least be fully explored* Yours etc., Sd* G.W* Rendel • P*S. The above was drafted before we received the news of the Persian Government’s cancellation of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company concession, which may well atfect the whole question of the treaty negotiations, but 1 sena it you none the less in order not to leave a loose end on the point. Intld.G.W.B.i / vm Walton, /&gt;' LcuZ-rtJ. 1 &lt;L ^ficc &amp; •-&gt; /A A-f^ ^ m. o^r &lt;rK /»&gt;V £* p’-U*t-C*~J- , ImJ ' ly. z 1 - rA I have deliherately done nothing on the long Foreign Office letter of 29th July on P.Z.2630/32 about the removal of the Residency, partly because the whole treaty situation has been so indefinite and it seemed better to avoid an infructuous argument with the Foreign Office at this stage, and partly because we were anxious to discuss the question generally with Sir Hugh Biscoe. if he had come home. 2. As matters stand there is the further argument for doing nothing that in the first place the treaty negotiations are not going very well; secondly, that the latest telegram from Mr. Hoare suggests that the Persians attach less importance than before to turning us out of Bushire (as you know we had always suspected that they were less interested than the Foreign Office in securing transf er); and thirdly , that something must depend upon Golonel Fowle’s views and he has not yet probably/ if Z ' ! Iprobably had time to reach a conclusion on the subject. 3. We are, of course, committed to going from Bushire as part of a satisfactory treaty settlement and it is in connection with this that the relation of the Resident to the South Persian consulates (which we had endeavoured to cover by the. scheme for an Inspecting Consul-Generalship, to vdiich the Foreign Office so strongly object) will have to be considered. Mr. Hoare may be right in thinking that the Persians would not looTT^tm^a scheme of this nature, but it is at any rate one of our terms and we are entitled to press it. The difficulty here, I suspect, is more with the Foreign Office than with the Persians, but it should not be impossible to devise some sort of scheme under which the Resident would keep the effective control of the Consulates at Bushire and Bunder Abbas and the Indian Vice-Consulates of Ahwaz and Mohammerah . The Foreign Office and the Minister are, of course, anxious that the severance of the Resident f rom/i \ C VI from Persia should he complete and that the consular posts on the Persian shore should he wholly under the control of Tehran (possibly with copies of correspondence to the Resident at Bahrein). We, on the other hand, have consistently held, and I see no reason for modifying our view, that the balance of advantage definitely rests with co-ordination of affairs on both sides of the Bulf by the same authority, in view of the interaction on the situation in North Arabia of affairs in South Persia.'Tlf and when we have to reply Mr. Clauson’s on the file is a good basis, but I think we shall do better for the tome being to say nothing unless the Foreign Office press the point on us again The strongest argument against removal (unless and until we have to go) is financial. Sir Hugh Biscoe was, on the whole, strongly in favour of remaining at Bushire on other grounds, but in one of his last private letters, a copy of which is on the file, he said/ ' ■ : W' ifT' N f XliX said that conditions were hecoming so intolerable at Bushire that he was beginning to revise his opinion on this point and inclining to the view that there was something to be said for going to Bahrein. It will be interesting to hear Colonel Fowle's views in due course.Extract from private letter from Sir Hugh Biscoe to Mr.Laithwaite dated 8th July,1932* ' Transfer of Bushire Residency .' As regards the transfer I should like to discuss it with you: existence is becoming so intolerable with these Persian import restrictions that really I am rapidly revising my views. We require a permit for every single article, and nowadays it takes 4 to 5 months to get one! The latest iniquity is that flour, wheat, tinned provisions, tea and coffee are to be totally prohibited even for us. in the interior these restrictions do not matter much: one can live very well on the country and of course in Tehran there are shops where one can get practically everything. In the Gulf one simply cannot exist without importing things: there are no fruit and practically no vegetables to be obtained - A lady here tried getting down flour from Tehran, and by the time it arrived it had gone bad: another lady came to me and asked me if I could possibly let her have a small quantity of white flour, as they had had no white bread for a long time.* To this are people reduced. Actually it seems to me that if the air route goes permanently to the Arab side and if the Navy also go to Bahrein then I had better follow suit. We could then cut the cables out of Bushire, take away the fast mail, and clear out bag and baggage. Bahrein would have the Navy, the air route, oil people, Residency, and quite possibly the flying boat squadron and existence would certainly be much preferable to here.NO DISTRIBUTION , Telegram (en clair) from Mr, Ho are.

As regards the Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty of the 28th,October 1841, the attitude of His Majesty’s Govt was fully set forth in MrHenderson’s above mentioned despatch of the 12th Sept,1930 (No.476) from which you will see that Sir Robert Clive was given discretion to draw the attention of the Persian Govt, if he considered it desirable, to the fact that this treaty had never been formally abrogated. As explained in that despatch, the present validity of the 1841 Tre&amp;y is open to serious doubt, and I entirely share the views expressed by you in para 6 of your despatch that it would in practice be useless to rely on this treaty in any attempt to maintain the Political Resident at Bushire against the wishes of the Persian Govt. The question whether it need now be mentioned in the proposed Treaty article is one which I am content to leave to the Persian Govt(s decision. Whether the treaty is regarded as having lapsed or is expressly abrogated, I adhere to the view stated in Para 4 of Mr.Henderson’s despatch No.476 of the 12th Sept,1930 that there could be no question of a withdrawal by the Persian Govt, of their permission that a British Resident should cpntinue to reside at Bushire, except as a result of friendly negotiations between the tv/o Govts. His majesty’s Govt, would only be prepared to agree to his withdrawal as part of a satisfactory general settlement resulting from the present negotiations, end presented to the Minister for Foreign Afiairs oy Bir Robert Clive in his letter of the 1st October 19oG, of which a copy was enclesed in his despatch No.488 of the 6th,October of that year • on certain conditions embodied in the draft notes x X XAir Mail Private TJie Residency, Busftire, the 6 th June 1932 I have just received a copy of Foreign Office letter Ho.E. 1672/636/34 of the 29th April to Donaldson about the transfer of the Residency* I thought at first of sending you a despatch on the subject, but probably it would be better to wait until I get something official from you; meanwhile, however, it may be desirable to let you know says that once the Resident has gone he must go definitely. I have always regarded the suggestion that he should be Inspecting Consul-General and visit the Persian coast as : entirely unworkable and of very little practical value. ^ $ e must therefore concede that if the Residency is trans- with the Persians, except that any Consulates on the Persian side of the Gulf filled by officers from India will be under his administrative control,i.e.,their accounts shall go through his office, the buildings will be in charge of the Persian Gulf Public Works Department, the cost of the posts shall be included in the Persian Gulf Residency Budget, and applications for leave, postings, etc. shall be dealt with by him. All this merely for administrative convenience. On the other hand when the Foreign Office state that the Residency constitutes a liability, the position is vulner able, etc., and that we must go sooner or later, they are, I believe, entirely incorrect. It is perfectly true that we cannot maintain a Resident on Persian soil, but we privately what I think about the question. Firstly, of course, Hoare is perfectly right when he emphaticallyemphatically nowadays do not do so. We maintain a Consul- General who claims no special privileges of any kind that would not be claimed by any consular officer. The vexed question of the flagstaff is settled. The Persians have since made concessions about mail bags * and the present anangement by which I get a diplomatic bag from Baghdad is very satisfactory, but this is not conceded specially to Bushire but to other consular posts as well* and whatever consular officer was here would ask for it. There is only one matter in respect of which the Resident would be conceivably vulnerable, and that is the Persian, authorities might refuse him a re-entry visa when he went to the Arab coast. Hitherto they have made no difficulties about it, and nowadays they give re-entry visas to any respectable individual going over to the Arab coast, and Hoare admitted that if they refused to a British Consular officer what they accorded freely to the general public it would certainly give us very legitimate grounds of complaint, and we should be on strong ground in protesting. The chief protagonists of the move were, I understand, the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office. The present Air Officer Commanding informs me that he sees no particular advantage from their point of view from a transfer of the Residency, and considers that the Resident is quite sufficiently get-at-able where he is. I think 1 have proved that pretty conclusively this winter. As regards the Foreigr Office, X am inclined to think that they were actuated by two motives. Firstly, they were under the impression that the presence of the Resident did constitute a liability and they are notoriously desirous of bringing an end to any liabilities in Persia, and secondly, they thought the position was rather an uncomfortable one for their Minister. I have shown that it .. #it is not, in my opinion, a liability and the personal reasons have largely disappeared, and I contend that so far from the presence of the Resident being in any way obnoxious to the i Minister, so long as he regards him as his expert adviser in Gulf matters, which always loom large in our dealings with the Persians, the presence of a senior officer with a wide outlook on both sides of the Gulf and who is also a channel of communi cation with the .Navy, etc* is helpful to him* The strongest arguments against the transfer, at any rate at the present time, are, I think, the fact that it will cost a great many lakhs of rupees, and secondly that it will inevitably raise the question of India’s contribution towards consular and diplomatic expenditure in Persia* howell, I know, anticipates that India under the new regime will sooner or later raise the question of the moiety, and it would seem undesirable at the present juncture to weaken the case for a continuance of the contribution. It would place an additional burden on the already over-burdened British tax payer, and even if sooner or later India should refuse to continue it, it seems to me desirable to put off the evil day as long as possible. At present it can be contended that India has definite interests in the Gulf, strategic, commer cial, etc*, and that it is desirable that they should have some say in the general policy. The presence of the Resident does, I think, enable a certain amount of weight to be accorded to Indian views on many questions in which they are considerably interested* If the Residency was transferred the Government of India would have no adviser on Gulf questions except from a purely Arab point of view, and would necessarily find it difficult to express an opinion on some of the questions involved.Draft Paper. political Department -14a 4000 8/31 &gt; Sendel Esq*, Foreign Office, S. W. 1. rfl'UctJli CA Dear Rendel, We ha.ve been considering your letter of the 29th April to Donaldson on the subject of the proposed removal of the Bushire Residency. 2. Possibly the question has got rather out of focus, and it may help matters to restate the position as we understand it. 3* The proposal to remove the Residency was strongly pressed by Clive (a) on the ground that an offer to do so would be a very strong card to play in the treaty negotiations, and (b) because if not removed the Residency at Bushire wouH succumb to fatal pinpricks. The Government of India have never really been convinced that a move could not be avoided or was desirable. They agreed however in principle to a move on certain conditions. The India Office has felt on the whole that the balance of advantage might lie in moving, providing that were accompanied by the conditions laid down by the Government of India (with which this Office, no less than the Foreign Office, concurred), and \ rand provided it facilitated or at any rate were accompanied by an entirely satisfactory General Treaty. 4. Conditions have changed in the last two years. The prospects of obtaining a satisfactory general settlement are doubtful. Moreoever, it appears from Hoare f s latest reports that removal of the Residency, so far from being a strong card in our hand, is a matter to which not very great importance is attached by Teymourtache so long as the Residency at Bushire is not made the focus of visiting ships and formal ceremonies extolling the “Consul-General^” position. Finally, as regards pinpricks, it does not seem clear, judging from experience since 1930, that they would necessarily be so fatal as Clive was inclined to think* For instance, the flag staff question is now solved, Biscoe has survived resolute attacks on his mails and this question is well on the way to settlement as regards consulates in Persia generally, it is evident that visits of ships should not present much difficulty for they are not essential - in fact, while of courseDepartment we cannot express a dogmatic opinion, it does not seem to us that it is 'by any means certain that the Resident could not happily continue to inhabit Bushire, so far as rela-tions with Persia are concerned, provided a decent dis- I cretion were to be observed by him | and more stress were laid than heretofore on his position as Consul-General. We might not Office adopted the line described in para. 4 of your letter. 5. We have, however, been thinking over the alternatives suggested by a study of the recent correspondence. unable to see how we could agree Bushire such as Hoare, apparently, advocates. And here it would seem ! that there are two aspects of the question, as it presents itself to Hoare himself and to the Persians respectively. 6 . As a question of relationship between the Government of India and the Foreign Office, the Minister and the Resident-Consul-General with his subordinate Consuls, there are I s object, therefore, if the Foreign to an unconditional transfer from u the/the factors (a) of tried practice in the past and of experience, (b) of cash* As to the latter, if preserves are not to be routed around in, no contribution can be paid to their upkeep. As to the former, experience of recent years has not, so far as we know, shown that anything bub advantage results, from a practical and administrative point of view, in having one sole authority who can speak with confidence on gulf questions. 7. As to the question M What is a Gulf problem?”, one would have thought this was a phrase as difficult to define as easy to conceive and illustrate. For instance, the new Persian Navy surely is a 'gulf problem” and the potential parent of a large family of gulf problems? If the 'Gulf” is to consist of the Arab littoral so far as the Resident is concerned, there will not be anyone who can keep a finger consistently on the politico-naval questions which will obviously arise in this* connection. Again, there is always the possibility of a recrudescence of slave traffic, an age-old gulf problem. Moreover, if one looks through/)raft Paper. Department through the proposed general Treaty with Persia, most of the matters to he settled therein are essentially Gulf Problems and matters on which the opinion of a competent Resident with experience of both sides of the Gulf has been of inestimable value kfi-fypUAfy (* k**!&gt;J in the* negotiations straight. 8 . We do not feel, therefore, that there is any doubt, from our point of view, as to the desirability of keeping the Resident intimately in touch with the Persian coast even if he leaves it. The actual machinery may need overhaul in the light of experience, but we do not understand Hoare*s objections to an Inspecting Consul-General or his | dismissal of the idea as absurd. I I Nor do we understand why it should be objectionable for consular officers under the immediate surveillance of the visiting Consul- General to send their reports through him to the Minister, especially as the latter would benefit by having local reports checked, co-ordinated, and enriched by a Consul-General who would have experience of both sides of the Gulf. 9. So much for the question in so far as it is a question of HisMajesty’s Government’s M internal economy” • How one stiould explain to the Persian Government the desire of His Majesty’s Government to have a visiting Consul General is a slightly different matter: but we should have thought it possible to explain that while we can appreciate the Persian’s Government’s desire that the Residency at Bushi re * should not appear to have greater importance than a Consulate-General, it is desirable from a practical point of view that His Majesty’s Government should continue to^work the same sort of administrative machine as heretofore, partly on grounds of economy and partly because the Resident &amp; Consul- General is the chief servant of the ' Government of India in these parts and they like him to keep an eye on the Indian service Consuls* Teymourtache, if he is anxious for the removal of the Residency from Bushire because of its ostentation, ought not to object to unostentatious rounds of visits* 10* The problem of explaining the matter to the Persians does not, however, seem to arise at present* The passage in Hoare’s despatch No* 146, which deals with the question, is not altogether clear to us, especially the three Sentences beginning/lit Paper Department, beginning M As I anticipated' and ending 'on non-Persian affairs'. But it seems pretty certain that the only thing Teymourtache is worrying about is the impression he has that the Besident is always wandering to and fro between Persia and Arabia on detonating and decorated warships, and holding councils of war on Persian territory with gold-braided sailors - and that if our proposal is adopted the same thing will continue to happen, only the headquarters being changed* 11. We consider, therefore, that Biscoe in his letter of the 2nd April (copy to you on 14th April, P.Z.2285) has hit the nail on the head. If Teymourtache can be persuaded that he is wrong and that in effect we use the Consulate-General as a Consulate-General and will be ready in future to be even more strict in the matter, there seems no reason, on the recent correspondence, why he should not acquiesce in its remaining at Bushire. 12. But if removal continues to be a live issue, we do not feel prepared to drop the conditions agreed upon by all parties on our 35b :sooo 5.31and we should have side two years ago; thought that if Teymourtache were told that in this eventuality also there would be no Question of the .Resident having any status in rersia but that of visiting Consul-General and that his visits would be unostentatious, he would withdraw his objections. 13. We are inclined to agree with the last paragraph of your letter about Teymourtache 1 s suggestion of a double headquarters. c^vutZ 14. Our £i«€fc±* suggestion is this. Since the removal of the Residency does not now appear to be a trump card in our hand and is unlikely to influence the general treaty negotiations, would it not be better to leave it aside for the moment? Our offer to Teymourtache stands, but it now seems probable that the offer is not worth his acceptance. If he reverts to the subject, Hoare might put matters to him frankly on the lines suggested above, and ask him whether it would not be better to leave this question over pending agreement on the principles of a general settlement, when he could consider the whole matter again and decide whether there were anv |W (vw ftM VMuu) objection to the Hesidency 4WU*. remaining/w r :r; r- 2630 n c- FOREIGN OFFICE.

In the former letter, Hoare refers to Baxter’s letter of January 22nd, 195 0 to La ithwaite. You will remember that the position at that date was that Cli.ve had urged most strongly the inevitable necessity for the removal of the Residency from Persia, and the desirability, from every point of view, of mailing a virtue of this necessity and drawing the utmost advantage in the treaty negotiations from our readiness to meet the Persian point of view. He had stated, in fact, that, if we agreed in principle to remove the Residency, he thought this would oe such a strong card in his hand that it might have a decisive effect on the success of the whole negotiabions. On/ E. P. Donaldson, Esq. YOn January 8th, 1930, he sent us a telegram drawing atten tion to the necessity of coming to an immediate favourable decision, if only in principle, on the point. We were naturally, therefore, anxious to help him co bring the negotiations to an early and satisfactory conclusion, and to send him without delay the reply which he had asked might reach him if possible by January 20th, the date of the Shah’s return to Tehran, The Government of India, however, disliked extremely the idea of removing the Residency from Persia, and, although they did not i^efuse to consider the question, they made their consent dependent upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. The India Office were obliged, in these circumstances, to go very fully into the question whether it was possible to meet the conditions formulate by the Government of India, before they could concur m the despatch of the necessary instructions to Clive. That was the origin of the correspondence between Laithwaite and Baxter, to which Hoare now refers. . you will realise that, in dealing with the Go ve r nine n t/■—■■■—Government of India’s proposed conditions, there were two courses open to the Foreign Office. We might have taken the line that, as the Government of India very well knew, it was quit 6 impossible in any case for us to continue to keep the Resident at Bushire indefinitely if the Persians wanted to be rid of him, for they could at any time render his position impossible, (see in this connexion Clive’s * 1 ! circumstances, we could have refused to have anything to do with the Government of India’s conditions, and have simply taken the line that if the' Government of India would not consider the Resident’s removal except on conditions, the Resident might, so far as we were concerned, stay where he was until- the Persians did in fact make his position impossible. The Foreign Office decided, however, to adopt the alternative course of seeing how far we could go to satisfy the Government of India’s desiderata. One point on which we then agreed to meet the Government of India was that quoted in paragraph I of ■Hoare's letter of March 9th to Baxter. We saw no particular/particular reason why the Resident, even after his headquarters had 'been established at Bahrein, should not be able to arrange direct with British Consular Officers in Persian ports to supply him with such political intelligence reports affecting the Persian Gulf as he might require. There is indeed no reason why the Political Resident, when he is established at Bahrein, should not, like any other British official in countries neighbouring on Persia, receive direct from His Majesty’s Consuls in Persia copies of reports etc. on subjects likely to interest him. But I confess I personally am considerably impressed by the arguments in Hoare’s letter of March 9th to Baxter, and that it seems to me that the compromise solution which was adopted in 19C9 will now have to be seriously reconsidered. Apart altogether from the question of the susceptibilities of the Persians, I do not myself see how any scheme can ever be expected to work well by which Consular Officers under the direct control and jurisdiction of one of His Majesty’s Diplomati representatives/representatives sent their reports to he edited or controlled and prepared hy an authority outside Persia, por do I see how any British Minister could be expected to acquiesce in such outside intervention in the activities of his Consuls. Hoare’s second point, namely the Government of India’s condition that the Resident, when at Bushire, shall have free and unrestricted access to Persian ports for the purpose of visiting and inspecting British Consular posts in southern Persia, seems to me to raise the same issue in another form. If we agree to remove the head quarters of the Political Resident from Persia, it will he in deference to Persian objections to the continued exercise in Persia by a British official of functions which, by tradition and association, approximate to those of an administrative governor. The policy of removing the Resident from Persia may be right or wrong, but surely Ij- the removal is to be carried out at all it must oe carried out logically and completely; and the Resident’s functions (apart from the purely Consular functions to which no one'V can seriously olject) must also cease in so far as Persian territory is concerned. It seems to me that it can well 'be argued that for us to retain for the Political Resident, after he has moved to Bahrein, special rights over or in connexion with any of His Majesty’s Consulates in southern Persia, would he inconsistent with the principle on which we should have acted in agreeing to remove him. If he is removed from Persia the only logical consequence would he that he should become an entirely non-Persian officer, entitled indeed, as are other officers outside Persia (e.g. in Iraq, etc.) to receive copies of all reports from His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular officers in Persia which are likely to he of interest to him, hut possessing no special rights in connexion with those officers. But, apart from these considerations, I think that we all realised at the time that it rested with the Persian Government and not with the Foreign Office to say whether the Government of India’s condition about access for the Resident to Persian ports could or could not he met. All we agreed to do was to put it to the Persians; and it now/X now seems fairly clear that the Persians are likely to refuse to have anything to do with such a scheme. If, however, you can supply us with convincing arguments which we can pass on to Hoare and which may enable him to make a satisfactory case to the Persians to show that the inspecting Consul-G-eneral idea is reasonable and logical, we shall of course be glad to consider the position further. You will see from the enclosure in Hoare T s official despatch that Teymourtache tentatively put forward a new suggestion to the effect that the Resident should spend the summer at Bushire and the rest of the year in ,f Sheikhdom”, provided his political functions in Sheikhdom were only exercised by correspondence when he was in Bushire, i.e. that he was not constantly visited by His Majesty 1 s Ships for political consultations. The idea seems open to various objections, and we are inclined to doubt whether Teymourtache really meant it seriously and whether we shall hear any more about it. I shall be glad/glad, however, to have any observations on the suggestion which you may like to put forward. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hoare.536/34) BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. V March 9th, 1332. Dear Baxter, Please see your letter E 350/168/34 of January 22nd 1930 to Laithwaite:- '¥e should he quite prepared to agree that the ’’Resident should have a free hand in controlling the pre paration and submission of political intelligence reports ’’affecting the Persian Gulf drawn up by the Consular Officers ”in Persian ports”. What are these mysterious reports, and why are they of so special a nature that the Resident is I cannot see, and therefore am obviously incapable of adducing arguments to satisfy the Persian, why the Resident, once he is out of Persia , should be the filter for political intelligence reports from Persia of special interest to the Government of India. Let’s suppose these reports to be ”the recruitment of Perso— Indians as Bolshevik agents in ±ndia ; All of these matters are certainly of very direct and special concern to the Government of India; hut if reports on them from presumably responsible Consuls require to be specially | controlled, presumably by someone enjoying the special confidence of/ and submission” of them? specially to have a free hand in controlling ”the preparation I deny that I am especially slow-witted, but about ’’Indian sedition”, ”Pan-Asiatic propaganda among « Indians living in Persia fostered (a) by Moscow (b) by Teymourtache”; ’’The spread of Bolshevik ideas in Persia”; ’’the development of Bolshevik trading activities in South Persia axte r E s qui re, M. C. Foreign Office.of the Government of India, let that man be the Consul- General at Bushire, because it is simple and straightforward to explain, if need be, to the Persians that the Government of India like their senior man to keep an occasional eye on the juniors. As a matter of fact no explanation would probably ever he necessary, and the Consul-General at Bushire would, in resnect of certain and definitely specified reports, be the Editor in-Chief who would be responsible for the degree of importance to be assigned to them (copies of them coming to the Legation ’'for information'). But I just don’t see what a Resident with headauarters at, say, Bahrein, has to do with these matters, and I certainly cannot talk, with any hope of convincing the Persians, about 'Gulf problems' as a reason why the 'Viceroy of Sheikhdom', when no longer established as a Consul-General in Persia, is entitled to play about in Persia. And why should he? Suppose the Persians sink a Muscat dhow because they think it’s carrying contraband, the 'Vice-roy” has two functions (1) to present to H.M.G. and me a clear account of the facts and a statement of tne nature of compensation necessary to pacify the Sheikh (2) to persuade the Sheikh that it would be unwise to cut the handiest Persian throat and if the Sheikh is obdurate to obtain from H.M.G. authority to restrain him oy force. Truth will out so I’ll say that I frankly don’t understand what 'Gulf problems ' are. I can conceive the possibility of social or political developments in Persia which would have a re percussion in Sheikhdom but the same applies to other countries; developments in the Sudan might affect Uganda, but the C.C. does not regard that as a reason for suggesting that the Governor of Uganda should rout around in Maffey s preserves,/preserves, but is prepared to believe that Maffey will inform the Governor of matters of interest to him. All this, of course, is an excellent argument against moving the Residency from Bushire, and an even stronger argument against trying to get the Persians to agree that the transferred Resident shall mouch around the Persian Ports in the false beard and mous tache of an 'Inspecting Consul-General'. Pardon pour 1’expression, but it’s a quite absurd idea. There is really no sort or kind of reason except the 'traditionalism' of which Teymour complains, why the Persians should object to the Resident being at Bushire, but there is, to my mind, every possible reason for objecting to our proposal, which for reasons that are a blankness to me, we say is a great concession. As I’ve telegraphed to Oliphant, I am going to see Teymour and Feroughi again before your instructions reach me and I’ve told them that among other things I want to know what they think of the proposal in the draft exchange of notes in Clive’s letter of October 1st 1930 (see his despatch No. 484 of October 6th 1930). I shall not argue with them, but if occasion offers I shall accuse them of 'traditionalism'. Presumably the Residency will have to leave Bushire, but if you are n ot p repared to re move it u nles_s the Resident is to be granted 'Inspecting Consul-General privileges by the Persians, I am inclined to think that, pin-pricks or no pin-pricks treaty or no treaty you will find it impossible to move the Residency. And/And this till means that I should like to he supplied with arguments to convince the Persians as well as me that the Inspecting Consul-General idea is reasonable and logical.

No. 50.; 11c o ^tire 1^0, /. PQLITICiUu KESIDMCY AT BUSHIliE. i I discussed this question with Teyraourtaehe. and F,eroughi on March ISth.» They 'began hy saying that they had never had the draft exchange of Notes which I had told them in a recent letter to Feroughi had been sent to them by Clive \in October 1950. I told them that I could not tell them because I had been working on a 'flimsy* and not on the original, but X certainly thought it had been sent. I would make sure and let them know (I have since ascertained that Feroughi unquestionably received the draft notes and that a private letter acknowledging them i» in the archives). Proceeding to discuss the merits of the proposal, Teymourtache began by saying that he absolutely could not understand what we were driving at. As I anticipated (see my letter to Mr. Baxter of the 9th. March, 1932) he said that fro® the Persian point of view the Political Resident with fcis Headquarters in 'Sheikdom” was definitely more objectionable than the Political Resident at Bushire. He perfectly understood that there was no ground for objecting to a duplication of function e.g., a man could be Minister at half a dozen posts. But the objection to the Political Resident lay in the fact that he did his Political Resident work from his Consulate-General in Persia and warships came to have conferences with him on non-Persian affairs. In the present state of Persia this created a bad impression and was^desirable. I said that I could not see why once a Treaty had been concluded and Persia thereby presumably fully reassured on the subject of her relations with us, the Persian Government should in the least mind a continuance of the present state of affairs. As I understood the matter, there was a very definite advantage if only Persia could rid herself of her prejudices, in the Consul—General at Bushire continuing to be Political Resident— positively off-hand that the draft had been sex^t to Feroughi advantagefrom s point? of vi©w 8.8 well 8 s oulps^ the ShelKhs were not particulaz’ly easy people to handle and to keep quiet and a man not only of considerahle seniority but. also of 1 irst—class ability was necessary# If he had to be tucked away on the Arab Coast with its fiendish climate for ten months in the year it seemed to me extraordinarily improbable that we should be able to persuade a suitable man to take the job# Teymour responded rather surprisingly by saying that it might he possible to leave the Resident at Bushire for the summer which could be spread to mean six months or more provided that, when he was in Sheikdom, he was in Sheikdom and when at Bushire his only connection with Sheikdom was by correspondence# It would mean that Sloops would not be constantly dropping in at Bushire to consult him# In answer to a question he said that of course in the event of an emergency in 'Sheikdom 1 * he could go off and deal with it# Having said all this Teymour switched off pretty abruptly and began talking again about the impossibility of the two functions being duplicated; I had the impression that it was on a sign from Feroughi but I am not certain, and am certainly not sure whether, if the idea proved practicable, Teymour could be held to it.*1^ 536/34) I. vV • .».• ‘V. _ m DISTRIBUTION.

Sir, I hay© the honour to invite a reference to ^our despatch ho. 146 of 23rd .'larch 1932 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, forwarding a note of a conversa tion which you had with the Ministers of Court and Foreign Affairs on 13th March on the subject of the Political Residency at Bushire. 2. As the Minister of Court has not, as far as I am aware, ever visited the Gulf and appears to be under &amp; complete misapprehension regarding the visits of warships to Bushire, it may perhaps not be amiss if I correct this misapprehension and explain the real position, since, i think, such explanation will go far to allay his suspicions. 3. T&amp;imurtache stated that warships came to have conferences with the Resident in non-Persian affairs and in the present state of Persia this created a bad impression and was undesirable. 14ow this frankly is not the case. The Senior Uav&amp;l Officer occasionally - very occasionally - comes to Bushire in the ’’Triad* to consult me, but when he does come to consult me our discussions as a rule are chiefly concerned with Persian affairs.e.g. incidents at Henjara, Treaty negotia tions, Persian $&amp;vy, and so on. 4. Visits by sloops were formerly infrequent for two reasons: (1) the somewhat discourteous attitude taken up by the Persian ••• tannic Majesty’s Minister, tish Legation, Tehran.- 2 - Persian authorities €ind ^2} the serious drawbacks of Bushire anchorage, which is entirely urisheltered. ju&amp;tterly such visits hare been more frequent, but are purely social visits* Uy relations With the Bavy in the Persian Gulf are, I am happy to say, most friendly, and naval officers I think enjoy coming ashore for a few days at Bushire, where I ®m in a position to offer a certain amount of hospitality and entertainment, while hockey, f o&gt;tball, etc# can be provided for the men# Actually, however, these visits have no political significance of any kind, since i discuss official matters only with the deni or haval Officer, and not with subordinate commanders, if it is consider ed that such visits offend the susceptibility of the Persians they could easily be reduced in number, but personally I would deprecate anything which reduces the few opportunities that naval personnel serving in the Persian Gulf have of a change and recreation# 5. You, during our recent discuss*iuns, mentioned that faimurtache also said that warships called at Bushire to take the Political Resident away and this also offended Persian susceptibilities by enhancing his prestige and giving him a position in the eyes of the local populace not enjoyed by Consuls-General at other po*U# This as I explained to you verbally, is a total misapprehension* fhe only single occasion on which X can recollect having left in a warship during the 2 | years I have been here was the other day when 1 left in H#M.!*'Bhoreham M to accompany you on your tour of the Gulf.

We were in general agreement with your views and those of the Government of India, but before replying we thought it as well to consult Hoare. We have now heard privately from him that he agrees with the proposal to do nothing further for the present in the way of preparing detailed plans for a selected site at Bahrein, v/hich would advertise prematurely our intention to establish a new Residency there.

My dear Howell, Will you please ret'er to Wylie’s B.O. Ho. i 1 .258-H/28 of 27th October regarding the preparation of line plans for the proposed new Residency at Bahrain. 2. How, as already pointed out by me and accepted i/ by the Government of India, vide your I).0. Ho. F.258-H/28 of 24th August to Walton, the preparation of these plans is quite beyond the ability of the Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf Bivision, and it will therefore be necessaxy to depute a special engineer from India for trie work. This engineer would have to proceed to Bahrain, and I should have to meet him there in order to select the site and discuss the proposed plans in detail. My presence there with the engineer, coupled as it would be with visits to alternative sites and probably discussions with the Adviser and other local officials would certainly give the widest publicity to the proposal. 3. Whether the official estimates would be slightly less or slightly more than the rough figures given by me, there is no doubt that the sum involved by the transfer of the Residency to Bahrain will be a considerable one, and it seems to me doubtful whether either His Majesty’s Government or the Government oi India are anxious to be confronted with this relatively large item of 3. Howell, Esquire , . C. 3.1. , C.I.E., foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Poreign and Political Department, Hew Delhi *TOaiiiiiiiji —- • — - 2 of expenditure at the present juncture, further, as you know r , the Persian negotiations are for the time being in abeyance, and from the discussions which I attended at home I gathered that the desire of His Majesty’s Govern ment was to maintain an attitude of aloofness for the present vis a vis the Persian Government in the hope that this might bring them to a more amenable frame of mind, which would be more conducive towards a successful re-* sumption of the negotiations. In these circumstances there would seem to be no likelihood of the transfer taking place in the near future. If so, is it desirable to give the proposed transfer such very wide publicity ? Prom the local point of view I can but say that, in my opinion, it is extremely undesirable. Further, there are several matters in connection with the proposed transfer which it was suggested should be discussed with the Persians, e.g. the subsequent status of the Resident, facilities for visiting Persian ports, etc. Hone of these matters have yet been settled, nor have we received any assurances regarding them, and I submit that as a matter of tactics it is undesirable to take very obvious and conspicuous measures for the transler until some sort of arrangement on these points has been arrived at. 4. If, however, the Government of India still con sider that it is necessary to proceed with the preparation of line plans despite the objections which I have urged then I would ask that a special engineer ot suitable rank and ability may be detailed to proceed to Bahrain on deputation at a date to be fixed in consultation with me, and that an additional grant may be made to me to meet the expenditure involved since it will not be possible to meet it from my depleted budget.

Colonel Riscoe mentioned in conversation that Major Fowie had written to consult him on the question of line plans, etc. He was himself strongly averse to taking further action in the matter of the transfer of the Residency and would much prefer to let sleeping dogs lie, in the hope that the whole project might come to nothing. In any case, it would, he thought, probably be impossible to prepare line pins, etc., without the deputation of an experienced P.W.D. official to the Gulf. This would mean two or three months’ work and would involve expense. Apart from that - and a more serious objection ~ it would hardly be possible to do the necessary work without inspecting sites and taking measurements on the spot. This would inevitably lead to most undesirable publicity being given to the possibility of our moving from Bushire to Bahrein. Could the India Office not, in these circumstances, head off the Foreign Office and the Treasury and postpone further action for the present 9 I said that I thought that sooner or later these plans would have to be prepared; that I saw no prospect of the / Foreign Office allowing the question of transfer to drop at present; that the Treasury were not unnaturally greatly concerned by the large expenditure probably involved; and that I thought, for tactical reasons, it was desirable that we should not present any appearance of being obstructive and should do as much as we reasonably could to facilitate consideration of estimates by them. On the other hand, the argument he had used as regards publicity was important. Would not his best course be to set out his objections to the Government of India and/and leave it to them to make a report to the Secretary of State? Colonel Biscoe, after discussion, asked whether we should object to his replying, to the Government of India to the general effect that he had mentioned the matter to the India Office; that they were anxious to see the plans prepared; but that the position was not altogether simple, as there was a real danger of undesirable publicity being given if a Public Works engineer (as would,be necessary) was deputed to the Gulf for the « purpose of preparing plans, etc^r^In any case, he would prefer, if they saw no objection, that a decision should be deferred until he returned from leave m a couple of months time. I said that I saw no objection to this, but that I would submit it for orders. I think the line suggested by the Resident is not unreasonable. There is no special urgency about the preparation of these plans, and there is force in his argument about publicity.

The Foreign Office letter represents the i&lt;. k. uio of iniormal discoesion with this Department. We may, I think, agree with them that it would be undesirable to reopen the question of Bahrein. It was selected after careful consideration of the alternatives - particularly of Koweit: and the arguments of a, general character against the latter are strong. On the specific point of expense Colonel Biscoe, in a private letter, writes: 'If Koweit were selected instead of Bahrein, it would make no difference whatsoever in the cost. The cost of the buildings would be exactly the same, since all material would have to be imported, and the question of the impregnation by salt would be exactly similar. I regard Koweit as quite impossible for the Residency. The fact that water has to be brought from a place 80 miles away would really seem quite sufficient argument. M On the question of a reduction in staff, it is conceivable that some reduction in the subordinie T staff might be possible. The most obvious economy which suggests itself is the doubling of the posts of Secretary, irfg and Political Agent, Koweit or Bahrein. On the other hand, the Secretary has at present/present a full day’s work; the Political Agent, Bahrein, very heavily worked (he has a heavy lisu of court cases in addition to his ordinary political duties); and, so far as we are aware, the Political Agent, Koweit, is in very much the same position. In reply to a private enquiry on the point, Colonel Biscoe expressed his general agreement with this view, and added: 'While the Political Agent, Koweit, is not quite so heavily worked as the Political Agent, Bahrein, he has a full day’s work and it would, be quite impossible to combine his duties witn those of Secretary to the Resident.” But on this point we may ask the Government of India for any supplementary observat they wish to offer. As regards the last paragraph of Mr. Baxter’s letter, we are of course in entire agreement with the Treasury and the Foreign Office in desiring expenditure or the removal of the Residency reduced so far as possible. The Department is indeed now inclined to the view that the probable cost of removal is one of the most substantial arguments for staying at Bushire. I submit that I may be authorised to reply to tl|e oreign Office as in the draft letter attached. ^ ions t'3- ru.yi , £ I,I,I- ihW* j?i Department, l Dear Baxter, Man/ thanks for your letter of 2nd July, No. E 3151/46/34, about the removal of the Residency from Bushire. We agree with the reply you propose to make to Waterfield on the subject of the choice of Koweit as against Bahrein; and we are in a position to supplement the arguments suggested in your letter as the result of enquiry of Biscoe, who advises us that, if Koweit were to be selected instead of Bahrein, it v/ould make no difference Ariutasogp* m cost. The cost of the buildings would be the same, since all material would have to be imported and the question of the impregnation by salt would be exactly similar, fit would, too, be equally necessary for the Resident (as it is in existing circumstances for the Political Agent, Koweit) to recess away from his headquarters and no saving could therefore be hoped for under this head. the On the question of reductions ir^/ Residency staff consequent on the transfer from Bushire, the most c obvious possibility that suggests itself is the combining of the posts of/ ■ i : uPolitical Agent, Bahrein (or Koweij), and the Secretaryship to the Resident, We doubt very mich, however, from the information available to us, whether it would in fact be possible to absorb the Political Agency at Bahreih in the Residency. The Political Agent, Bahrein, has at present a very heavy day's work (you will remember that there are a great many court cases quite apart from his ordinary administrative duties in the island), and Biscoe, who has been consulted informally, agrees with this view. As regards Koweit, he remarks: 'While the Political Agent, Koweit, is not quite so heavily worked as the Political Agent, Bahrein, he has a full day’s work, and it would be quite impossible to combine his duties with those of Secretary to the Resident'.J It may, of course, be TfT* possible to effect some minor economies in the subordinate staff as the result of the transfer of the Residency, but it is difficult at this stage to speak with any confidence on the point. You may, I think, assume that the Government of India, like the Secretary of State, entirely share the views of the Foreign Office and the Treasury asj! to the desirability of reducing expenditure in/•aft Paper. Department, APPROVED POI.ITICAL GOi ij 2 4 1! ^liTTEB* 1 in connection with the removal of the Residency so far as possible, and you may rely upon us to leave nothing undone which might help to secure any economies. You will have seen fran the Government of India*s letter to the Acting Resident of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office under our printed letter, P.Z. 4175/31, of 3rd July, that the Government of India have now asked for a line plan and rough square foot or cubic foot estimat in respect of all buildings proposed in connection with the removal of the Residency to Bahrein. We are sending copies of this correspondence to the Government o f India; and I enclose copy of a letter which has been sent on the subject generally to Howell, Tours sincere^ v» G. i’£ vit Paper, Department. . Howell, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.S., foreign Secretary to the Government of India, SIMLA. 5000 2.31 We sent by the air mail of 3rd July copy of a demi-official letter from the Foreign Office enclosing a letter from the Treasury on the subject of the removal of the Persian Gulf Residency from Bushire to Bahrein. I now enclose copy of the reply we have sent to the Foreign Office. As you will see, Biscoe does not think that any saving would result were Koweit and not Bahrein to be selected as the alternative site for the Residency. In any case, the objections to reopening the question of the alternatives to Bushire seem to us, as to the Foreign Office, substantial. The Government of India will no doubt consider in due course V €b«y openings^ there may be for reductions of staff in connection with the removal of the Residency. As you will see, we have indicated to the Foreign Office, after informal discussion with Biscoe, that we doubt if there is any prospect ofithe economy which inmediately singests itself as possible/H i ’ i! -y b . F -l| i^vj &gt; ' tzr t . j possible combining^ the posts of Political Agent, Bahrein (or Koweit), and Secretary to the Resident. But it is no doubt conceivable that soine economies in subordinate staff may be possible, arid in view of the very heavy expenditure which the removal of the Residency seems likely to entail, we feel sure that the Government of India will give full consideration to and when the time comes. this ir on APPROVED -jlTICAL COMMITTEE* £4 JUL 1951 a—&lt;i—— .xeld P z /46/34) ICE, S.W.l 2nd July, 1931. Bear Laithwaite With reference to your official letter No.PZ 3675/31 of the 12th June, and previous correspondence on the subject of the removal of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrein, I enclose, herein, a copy of a letter from Waterfield to Rendel commenting upon Biscoe*s estimate of the cost of the removal. As regards the first suggestion in Waterfield*s letter, there is nothing, I think, in the information at our disposal to show that a new Residency could he huilt and run very much more cheaply at Koweit than at Bahrein. But, in any case, it seems to us unnecessary and undesirable that the question of the relative advantages of Bahrein and Koweit as the new site for the Residency, which has already after mature consideration been settled in favour of Bahrein, should be gone into all over again. We therefore propose, subject to your approval .Laithwaite, Esq.approval, to reply that this question has been very carefully examined and that a definite choice was made in October last in favour of Bahrein. We would add, if you agree, that the reasons for this choic^are the following:- Political and Geographical dltJj* UUaT. Bahrein, 'being in the centre of the Gulf, is in closer touch with the Gulf Arabs and their special problems. It is a convenient base for visiting the Trucial Sheikhs and Oman, which require an ever- increasing share of the Resident’s personal attention. Koweit, on the other hand is isolated at the end of the Gulf and is out of touch with the Trucial Sheikhs and Oman and with the Persian coast south of Bushire. Bahrein is secure from hostile attacks, whereas Koweit is open to raids from the desert. Telegraphic communication from Bahrein is less liable to wilful interruption than from Koweit. With the development of air communication, Bahrein, and not Koweit will be the centre of airways in the Gulf. Commercial.i m Commercial. Bahrein is the commercial capital of the Gulf and the centre of the pearl trade. Amenities. Bahrein possesses greater amenities of civilisation than Koweit. Its people are more progressive and it has a small European community which will probably grow in the event of a development of its oil interests. It has better facilities for obtaining electric power and plant. Unlike Koweit it has trees, verdure, and good roads; most stores and conveniences are obtainable locally and some facilities exist for recreation. We have drawn up the foregoing from the detailed 1^- comparison of the two sites contained in Barretos express combining i message No.293S of 1929 and his letter No.354S of 1929, of which a copy was enclosed in your official letter Ko.P560/30 of the 24th January 1930. Very probably you have further material wherewith to amplify and add to our summary. As regards points 1(c) and 2 in Waterfield f s letter: i.e. the possibility of effecting any reduction in the staff by K l;l 11 —— — ..combining the Residency with the Political Agency at Bahrein, and the possibility of taking this opportunity to make some reduction in the size of the very numerous Residency staff, we should he very glad to have your observations as to what our reply should he. You may think it well to infom the Government of India of the Treasury’s wish that a very special effort should he made to reduce expenditure in connexion with the Residency and its removal. We for our part would welcome any such reduction, and we are glad to see from the enclosure in your official letter No.PZ 3377/31 of the 30th May that the Government of India are already studying in detail Biscoe’s estimate for the accommodation for senior officers.t /' COPY (B 3151/46/34) S.35110. Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W.1. 12th June, 1931. Dear Rendel, Your letter of the 2nd June, (E 2367/46/34), about the provision of a new Residency on the south coast of the Persian Gulf contains an alarmingly high estimate of the probable cost. £100 ,000» exclusive of the cost of site, roads, surrounding walls etc., and of a Circuit House at Karachi, is a figure which cannot fail to cause perturbation in these difficult times. I should like to put two suggestions to you. (l) Apart from the political considerations, would there . be any saving if the choice of location fell on Koweit instead of Bahrein, e.g. (a) do the special conditions described in paragraph 11 of Biscoe f s letter of 24th March 1931 to Acheson a PPly equally to Koweit; (b) would the necessity of recessing in Karachi apply to Koweit as well as to Bahrein; and (c) would it be possible to effect any reduction of staff by combining with the Political Agency? I don’t suppose it likely that there would he a substantial difference in cost between the two, but, if it should prove that this were so, X think we should have to ask you to justify your preference for Bahrein at greater length, (2) Is it possible to take this opportunity to make some reduction in the size of the very numerous staff of the Residency? I do not know whether you anticipate that the ..ork will fall to any extent as a result of the change; but whether it does so or not, we feel that a very special effort ought to be made, in conjunction G.W.Rendel, Esq. , Foreign Office* 7'i| |i • h / V ] ; ■i | |i • h / V ] ; ■i secret. p. 345/30.

(k) Situation at extreme northern limit of Resident’s charge makes headquarters unnecessarily far from India and from Muscat and the Trucial Coast which requires more of the Resident’s personal attention than it has received'in the past. (V) Lack of security owing to liability to raids from desert. (m) Absence of wireless and ease with which land line can be cut by raiders. Of these defects the following can be remedied ;—- (b) by building suitable Residency on suitable site which is available ; (d) by coming to an understanding with Bin Sand. This would probably be facilitated by transfer of Residency to Kuwait as this should kill Bin Sand’s hope of forcing Shaikh to submit to absorption by Najd State; (e) by making tennis courts and playing fields for staff and clerks who would accompany Resident; (/) Government would presumably supply Resident and his staff with the^P necessities in the climate of the Gulf ; (g) Government might consider question of condensing plant : (G building of a Residency pier would meet this drawback ; (j) arrangements could probably be made for fast mail to call weekly.

VKuwait will enhance the prestige of the Principality, showing that His Majesty’s Government intend to support the inde pendence of Kuwait against both Iraq and ]b n Sand, whose policy is to acquire it as it is the natural port of northern Najd. Owing to the constant coming and going of Najd Bedouin to and from the town” Kuwait is in closer touch with Najd politics than Bahrain, whose insular position renders it more unapproachable for the desert dweller. (1) On the^ other hand, although the interest of Ills Majesty’s Government at Bahrain is already clearly shown, it will be absolutely necessary for His Afajesty’s Government to be represented by an official of the highest rank in the Gulf if American oil interests obtain a footing in the Gulf and are possessed of the powers granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate in their Concession of 1925.

(2) Kuwait’s proximity to Iraq facilitates relations with the High Com missioner for Iraq and joint discussion of Arab problems. In Kuwait the Resident would also be in close touch with the situation in Najd and in proximity to the Royal Air Force, on whom he has to rely for the defence of the town. This is a distinct advantage in times of stress though of much less value in normal times. I have myself found it difficult recently to control affairs from Bushire, and have twice visited Kuwait for consultations. (3) Close liaison wdth British authorities in Khuzistan, but decrease of touch with Persian coast south of Bushire. (2) Bahrain attracts at intervals all the rulers of the Gulf, who come either to receive hospitality from the rich Shaikhs of Bahrain or to receive medical attention at its famous American hospital, which is better known and closer to their homes than that of Kuwait. The presence of these rulers affords opportunities for the establishment and maintenance by the Political Resident of personal relations with them. I lay great stress on the accessibility of the Resident, who should know the Shaikhs personally. It is for this reason that I recommend frequent tours by him along the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. This is one of the chief reasons for preferring Bahrain to Kmvait. (3) Owing to their visits to Bahrain, maintenance of touch with Shaikhs of Persian coast south of Bushire, which is mainly peopled by men of Arab blood. 2. Commercial. Kuwait is a large Bedouin town and Bahrain is the commercial capital of the natural port of northern Najd. the Gulf and the centre of the peai tiac e, on which the Arabs of the Gulf live. It is the entrepot for Hasa and southern Najd. 3. Situation. Kuwait is at the extreme northern end of the Gulf, at one extremity of the Resident’s charge. Bahrain is in the centre of the Gulf, which saves 2-1 hours’ steaming when visiting the Trucial Coast and Oman. (See 1 above.) 4. Communications. (1) Owing to the proximity of Basrah, communication with the outer world by s ca, air, and motor-car is easier than at Bahrain, but if the Residency were in Kuwait the fast Gulf mail should call weekly both on the inward and outward v °yage. (1) Visits by the fast Gulf mail both on the inward and outward voyage would be essential if the Residency were in Bahrain until the perfection of the Air Alail rendered this unnecessary.Kuwait. Bahrain. (2) Telegraphic communication, how ever, is only by a single land line to Basrah, which is liable to be cut at any time by raiders. (2) Bahrain has the best flying boat harbour in the Gulf, more protected than that atKuwait. Its aerodrome has probably a better surface than that at Kuwait anil is secure from hostile attack, whereas that! at Kuwait, which is outside the town wall is more open to attack. With the development of air communi cation, Bahrain and not Kuwait will be the Gulf centre of airways. The present superiority of Kuwait in the matter of communications with the outside world will then vanish. (3) Telegraphic communication, through the Indo-European Telegraph Department Wireless Telegraph Station, is less liable to wilful interruption. If the Wireless Telegraph Station at Bushire is handed over, Bahrain can work Basrah direct but the danger of jamming and atmos pherics has to be considered. 5. Climate. Provided a really suitable Residency is built the climate is preferable to that of Balmain. 6. Accommodation. House rent for the staff would probably As at Kuwait, a permanent building be a little cheaper than that at Bahrain. would have to be erected, but Shaikh Ko temporary accommodation available Hamad would probably lease or sell for the Resident. temporary quarters for the Residency. Drinking water is brought by boat from Fao. A ell water lor washing, &amp;c., is scarce and very brackish, and consequently no gardens are possible. 7. W at er Supphj. I he water of Bahrain is not drunk by Europeans although the American missionaries use it. It is probably whole some, but it has a bad taste. Ample water for washing and gardening. 8. Amenities (!) No European society, a few American missionaries, a conservative type of Arab. (2) Except for a small power plant possessed by the Shaikh and another worked by the American missionaries for then own use, there is no electric power plant nor ice factory in Kuwait. (3) Depressing scenery owing to the absence of trees or verdure. (4) No roads, nor can they be constructed owing to the loose, sandy nature of the soil, though it is possible for motor-cars to pass over certain areas. (5) European stores and similar con veniences not available locally. ((&gt;) No facilities for recreation. (1) More progressive people and con sequently more of the amenities of civilisation, including a small European society, likely to increase with the advent of Oil Company’s employes. (2) Facilities for electric power and plant exist and will be more satisfactory next year when the State scheme is in operation. (8) Ample trees and verdure owing to good soil in the vicinity and the abundance of water. A good garden can be made even in the Agency 7, compound on the sea shore. (4) Good roads, though of short length. (5) Most stores and conveniences available locally. (0) Some facilities for recreation exist.i 116 ^3t 0,: &gt;'0t, odronii; that at ? ! %flS lent of in, Hot P ot tuiwait i r %. ! te J 11 'MlieJ , ele #fciiik ’ is i® u ■ ■t •Diishire is 1 i vor ^ Basdiy sidered. 2 I am not afraid of Bahrain being swamped by a Western flood if the Resident J there. For reasons which I am giving in a separate report that i will send you shortly, I am of opinion that we should not recede from our present position in Bahrain especially if American oil interests obtain what may, if not properly controlled, be a strangle-hold on the island. 3, To sum up, Bahrain is preferable as the headquarters of the purely Gulf Residency, but Kuwait commands a wider outlook into general Arab politics. I recommend headquarters at Bahrain, but would reserve accommodation at Kuwait, which the Political Resident could use for considerable periods in time of stress. At present the cramped and dilapidated Agency renders it impossible for the Resident to visit Kuwait for more than a day or two for a hurried consultation, as it is only at extreme inconvenience to himself that the Political Agent can find him room. 1 hope it will be possible to remedy this state of affairs in the new Agency that is being built, although it would be preferable in every way that there should be a Circuit House that the Resident could occupy independent of the Agency. 4. I have discussed the subject from the point of view of to-day. I do not think, however, that the development of aircraft will modify my observations to any considerable extent. I have, &amp;c., C. C.

The Government of India subsequently (Mr. Wylie’s letter of 11th May, P.Z. 3377/31) asked the Resident for a rather more detailed estimate, and suggested that the estimates already put forward by fteoi^ttrrtr were possibly on the generous side. Colonel Biscoe’s reply is given in his letter of 15th May on P.Z. 3675/31. At the request of the Foreign Office we asked the Government of India last March to obtain a report on the alternative sites available in Bahrein for the Residency, and on the difficulty, if any, likely to be experienced in the way of acquiring such sites. The/ ^75b iooo 5.30Th.6 Resident’s report on this subject will be found on P.Z. 3762/51. We may agree with him that in the circumstances explained no further action seems necessary for the present. Copy of the correspondence has gone to the Foreign Office, to whom it is perhaps unnecessary to write. An extract from a note recorded by the Secretary v: %of State after discussion of the general question with Colonel Biscoe, and from a letter sent by Mr. Benn to the Viceroy, will be found at flag B. The Foreign Office continue ^ anxious to bring about the transfer of the Residency, and we are^cttwt^* pressed by them on this point. The breakdown of the Treaty negotiations gives us an opportunity to mark time. But there may be something m jffytf Foreign Office fears that the breakdown is likely to be followed by a fresh resort on the part of the Persian Government to a policy of pinpricks at Bushire and Henjam. If in fact the Persian Government wish to make the Resident’s position impossible at Bushire, they are^in a position to do so, and in the event of their adopting a policy of this nature, the question of transfer would assume a new urgency.

My dear Wylie, Please refer to your D.O. No. F.258-N/28, dated the 18th March 1931, forwarding a copy of a D. 0. from Walton asking that the Political Agent at Bahrain might be asked to report confidentialiy on the alternative sites available in Bahrain for the Residency, and to state whether, in his opinion, there is likely to be any difficulty in the way of acquiring any such sites. I am inclined to think that this request is put forward without possibly any adequate knowledge of the physical characteristics of Bahrain. Bahrain consists of two islands •* Manamah and MuharraQ,. On the north-east corner of the island of Manamah is the town of Manamah and on the north-west corner of the island of Muharraq is the town of Muharraq. These two towns comprise practically the whole population of the islands with the exception of a few small villages along the coast. Outside these two towns the islands consist of low-lying desert - sandy in some ^ places and rocky in others. To the west of Manamah town ;/ there V - Wylie, Esq., C.X.S. , deputy Secretary (Foreign) to the Government of India, Simla*Ifera P SiiHJ J i£§ iB SO e 3 ie ; sJe J iiC[ 10 TI03 i ao IffQ^ .Gf-'S ' ugjg - 2 - there is a comparatively small area where there are some date groves and gardens and a certain amount of cultivation* With the exception of this area and small plots in the vicinity of the village and a very occasional garden which may recently have come into existence owing to the boring of artesian wells, the soil of the rest of the island does not belong to anyone As it is undesirable that the Residency, if transferred to Bahrain, should be located in either of the towns , I can reply straight away without reference to the Political Agent that there is not likely to be any difficulty or delay about the acquisition of a site. I can of course, if so desired, ask the Political Agent about prospective sites, tut I do not see it will advance matters in the least. It is a matter of comparative indifference really whether you put the future Residency down on one piece /l hi I ( of sand or on ano ther piece of sand. The considerations which will decide the location of the Residency will te the direction of the prevailing trees®, humidity, etc., on which the advice of the local officer would, of course, be sential} a suitable foundation, a matter largely for an expert es iyr expert engineer; the presence of water, a ffl atter only to be ascertained by trial borings; and finally the personal predilections of the Political Resident. Ihe Political Agent therefore without the expert advice of an engineer - C ' ' ^ or architect could do very little towards choosing a site and, as stated above, the question of the site is not likely to involve any great delay. Further, I understand from His Majesty's Minister that the negotiations for the treaty are still m abeyance, so there would seem to be no great urgency about the matter for the time being. Yours sincerely, Sd/- H. V. Biscoe.

Please refer to your D.O. letter N0.258-B/28&gt; dated the 11th kay 1931, regarding the transfer of the Bushire Residency. The Assistant Engineer is at present away on tour and will not be back for about a month. When he returns the plans you ask for, if still required, will be prepared, but as I shall have gone on leave by then I am replying to you letter now. Firstly, I would like to emphasise that the figures,that I gave, were admittedly only approximate, and therefore even if it is considered that one item could be somewhat reduced it really hardly affects the general estimat* or the argument contained in my letter in support of which th&lt; figures were given namely that the transfer of the residency i will cost about £ 100000. My experience is that in the case of buildings in out-of-the-way places the estimates are almost invariably exceeded and moreover in the case of the transfer s of a Residency involving the construction ot a large number of buildings, offices, etc. there are always a number of small items which are difficult to foresee till the matter is gone into in detail none of which possibly are probably very expensive in themselves, but combined they go in the end swell the estimate appreciably. Meanwhile, possibly a statement of the accommoda tion required may be of use and will xbukxizx* suffice. I consider that a bungalow for a senior officer should have the following accommodations drawing room, dinging room, ana J.Sidy, one double bed-room, a good large nursery and two l^nele rooms with appropriate bath rooms, dressing rooms,etc. iB'‘view of the climate and humidity,etc. they should have high plinths and considerably wider verandahs than are customary _ , , .customary in India. In a climate such as Bahrain, the latter is essential, as one is largely dependent for existence on the sea hreeze and one lives very largely on the verandah. If a line plan is still required would you kind: let me know and the Assistant Engineer will be instructed to supply it on return. Since writing my demi-official letter lTo.i 5 i -3 of the 24th March 1931, I have visited Karachi and while there discussed with the Commissioner in Sind the question of a Cir cuit House. If the transfer of the Hesidency takes place it is proposed that the Resident should spend about four months^ Karachi and he should, I think, he provided with a reasonably commodious bungalow, especially as he would have to do some entertaining at any rate. The Commissioner in Sind, basing t'V- his estimate on the cost of some of the Government buildings ' Karachi, considered that a Circuit House would cost about Rs. 75000. This excludes any expenditure that may be necessary for the purchase of the site. I am not aware of the cost of land in Karachi, but it is presumably not very cheap, and it will probably be necessary to add not less than £ 6000 to the estimate already submitted for the construction of the Karachi Circuit House.

In their telegram Ho. 3909-3, dated the 5th December 1930 to the Secretary of State for India, the G-overnment of India stated that according to figures furnished to them unofficially by myself, the cost of transfer might be expected to work out at something in the neighbourhood of about £100,000.

The datas however, on which my figures are based are (i) the book value of the existing buildings; ( ii) estimates drawn up for the construction of buildings at Ahwaz and works undertaken by His Majesty* s Government on official residencies at Basrah, Hamadan and Kernanshah; (iii) the views of the Assistant Engineer in the Public ^orks Department, who has had mucii experience in the uulf and who is competent to form, at any rate, a rough idea of the approximate cost of the buildings re a ui red. Prom a consideration of these data and a study of Statement ” A M , I think it will be seen that ray figure of £ 100,000 while admittedly only a rough figure errs if anything on the side of moderation and omits various items for which expenditure will certainly have to be incurred, and I shall be surprised if it is not exceeded. 5. The book value of the present Residency at Subzabad is Rs. 3,10,000 - £ 23,250. This is what the Residency actually cost to build many years before the war when rates were of course much less than they are now, and Bushire is a cheaper place to build in than Bahrain; further the accommodation in the present house is certainly not excessive, and when my family are with me I have a great deal of difficulty in accommodating the people whom I am called on tjfpe put ui3. The detailed esti mates prepared for the consulate at Ahwaz came to 2 2 lakhs £ 17,500, though this included quarters for a junior Vice- ^ons il as well. Taking these facts into consideration I submit an estimate of £ 25,000 for the Residency, plus cd 1250 j.or the servants* quarters, is very moderate. 6. I have estimated £ 10,000 plus £ 600 tor servants quarters for the Secretary*s and Residency Surgeon*s houses. TheyThey are both fairly senior officers and usually married, and provision mist be made for taeir families, and it must be borne in mind that, if the Residency is transferred to Bahrain, the Resident and his staff will be living in the worst climate in the Persian Gulf, and should certainly be provided with commodious and cool houses. The book value of the present Secretary’s house is about £ 5000. If w&amp;s, however, built many years ago when all materials and labour were about half what they are nowadays, and it is merely an adapted Persian house to which certain alterations and additions have been made to fit it for occupation by Europeans. It has cost no less than £ 7000 recently to put a new roof and carry out some minor alterations to the exceedingly v/ell-built and commodious house provided for His Ma.iesty*s Consulate Basrah; it has cost £ 8000 to construct a Vice-Consulate at Hama dan, exclusive oi the cost of site, while the cost of the Kerraanshah Consulate, inclusive of site, tbs £ 12,200. Houses in a hot climate must necessarily be larger than houses in a cool climate. I do not think therefore that the estimate of £ 10,000 Plus £ 600 for servants' Quarters, out-houses, etc. is excessive for these two houses. The Under Secretary and the Assistant Engineer are more .junior officials and I have estimated the cost of fhi^ir houses at half the above figures. 7. The gazetted officers are generally senior Anglo- Indians or Indians, and nearly always have their families and children with tiiem. An estimate of £ 1500 for their houses, olus £ 160 for servants' quarters, etc. is not, I thin , exce ssive. . . ■ ^ w cni t’v wi 11 iisv© to con ug xn 8.

The rest of the figures I think call for little A t Bushire some of the clerical establishment are provided with free quarters: others draw house rent allowance in lieu. If, as I propose, the Residency is to be built some 4 or 5 miles away from the twwn, it will be necessary to provide quarters for all the clerks. Some small saving would then be effected by the discontinuance of the house rent allowances at present drawn by some of the clerks. It will be seen that the total comes to &lt;£ 99,200. The Assistant Engineer, however, informs me that this is the bare cost of the houses, and allows nothing for such items as levelling ground, building walls round the houses, or \ roads, paths, etc. Further, nothing has been allowed for the cost j of a Circuit House at Karachi or for the cost of the site. The cost of the Circuit House will probably be considerable and in 1 view of the fact that the climate of Bahrain is very much worse than that of Bushire, I consider it essential that the Resident and his staff should recess in Karachi for 3 or 4 months in the year, and to this the Government of India have agreed. It will oe necessary to take a considerable portion of the office estaolish- ment into Karaciii, and provide a suitable residence tor tne Resident and his staff. 10. Although I have not gone into the question oi si^e in detail, I think it will probably be found that ii the t-ransier takes place the new Residency should be some 4 or 5 miles distant from either the town of Mannamah, or the town ox kuharray whichever island it may be decided to build on, t.ii - .yould desirable both on political, climatic and sanitary grounds. Land in the vicinity of these towns is expensive out if Residency is located at some distance it will proodbly be possible to acquire a site cheaply; on the other hand i - will be necessary in that event to incur some expenditure on roaas, andand also probably on taking current from the Bahrain power station to the Residency, or on installing a separate electric light plant. The £ 5000 provided in the estimates is for wiring all the buildings and providing the recessary fans, lights, fittings, etc. 11. There is one further point which I would emphasise, and that is, that the cost of putting up buildings of this kind in Bahrain will be found to be high. It will certainly be very much higher than in India. Practically all material of every kind will have to be imported, no wood is obtainable in Bahrain, and masons, carpenters, etc., will have to be brought up from India at higher rates of pay than they would receive in their own country. Freight charges are high. In the case of the Kermanshah Consulate they came to £ 900 on £ 1500 worth of material imported from England. Of course in the caste of Bahrain they should not amount to so high a percentage, but on the other hand a much larger proportion of materials will have to be imported. For instance, the soil of Bahrain is impregnated with salt. If local bricks are used the saline deposit at once appears and additional expenditure has to be incurred on upkeep. The Bahrain Agency is ^t present thickly coated with salt deposit and is weathering exceedingly badly. The Chief Engineer of the Imperial margraves Commission recently visited the Gulf and informed ne that they had.had the greatest difficulty owing to salt in the ceraeteries in Irac^ the headstones, cross features, etc., re crumbling a wav very rapidly, and he thought that if «ny building jo rk was undertaken at Bahrain, it would be necessary to obtain bricks either from Ahwfcz or India and to take special measures by means of lead courses, etc., to prevent wie penetration salt into the buildings. As he put it '’it will take Doth bra ins a nd mo ne y to ove r c ome tn e sa f ^ 1 Yours sincerely, Sd. H.V.Biscoe .6 STATEMENT showing persons for *on accommodation is required 1 i.

But I am asked to say that we also agree with them as to the desirability of ' going very slowly. Financial arguments apart, we feel firsts that it is still desirable to turn to such advantage as is possible the concession represented by the removal of the Residency once the Persian negotiations are resumed, and secondly that it is essential, before we finally commit ourselves as regards transfer, to secure Persia acceptance of the demand for certain facilities which we have put forward as a condition of that transfer.^ If we are to follow this course/[P course, it will be necessary to do nothing at the present stage to give away our intentions, and we feel that action on the lines suggested in your letter of 13th November would clearly indicate to the Persians that we had made up our minds in any case to leave Persia and settle in Bahrein; that the value of removal as a bargaining count|er would be gone, and that the prospect of securing the desired facilities for* the Resident, which we regard as of great importance in the interest of the continued co-ordination of Gulf natters by him,might be substantially reduced. 3* We consider, in the circumstances, that nothing should be at the present stage which might come to Persian notice, and that the question of further preliminary action (save as regards estimates of expenditure) should' be deferred until Clive has resumed his negotiations and until an understanding on the question of facilities has been reached. We trust that the Foreign Office will share our view. -4 agree as to the desirability of obtaining a more detailed estimate of the cost involved in the proposed transfer, and we are asking the Government of India to make the necessary arrangements.

Treaty negotiations, however, are at ^ ' present in abeyance.

The difficulties in regard to the Resident’s Consular mail, which show no sign of abating, constitute an additional argument from our own point of view - though admittedly one of relatively minor importance - for removing his headquarters to a spot at which he will not be subject to vexatious interference in discharging his duties. The Government of India at the same time agree that we should go slow, and with this opinion we may entirely agree, for the reasons given in the minute on P. 7938. The Sheikh of Bahrein has now intimated that he would 'feel honoured by the presence of the Resident at Bahrein' (Colonel Biscoe's despatch of 12th November: P. 8397), so that/ifficulty is out of the way if and when effect is to be given to transfer . from Bushire. I submit that I may be authorised to write to the Foreign Office as in the draft letter attached.■i, Draft Paper. Department. CX Baxter Esa., M.C., ^OREI® OFFICE, S.W. 1 .

(3 4595/168/34). 6th September, 1930. Dear Laithwaite, Many thanks fo^onr letter No.P.5 345/ 30, of August £2nd, enclosing copy of correspondence with the Government of India regarding certain subsidiary matters connected with the proposed removal of th e Bushire Residency from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Gulf. As regaras the points raised in paragraph 2 of the Government of Indian letter of June 6th, we agree that the Ahwaz and Kerman Consumes fell entirely outside the scope of the discussion between our two departments at the beginning of this year. That discussion was, of course, limited to the position at British Consular posts in Persian £ 0 ^ i.e. MohammerEb , Bushire and Bandar Ahbas. 1 fear that we cannot well agree to your saying that no alteration of the status quo as regards the staffing of Ahwaz and Kerman, ana the relation of their incumbents to the Political Resident is contemplated. Generally speaKing, we here are definitely of opinion that my vague, and so far as I snow undefined, dependence on the part of Ahwaz md Kerman vis-a-vis of the Political Eesiaent should now be/ Laithwaite Esqbe brought to an end* V&gt;e recognise that the Resident, as the British representative and expert authority in all Gulf matters, ought to a certain extent to have a say in our consular arrangements in Persian Gulf ports; but the position is entirely different with regard to these inland towns. As regards the other points rai sed in paragraph 2 of the Government of Indian letter, we agree to point (b), but think that points (c) and fd) go a little further than is warranted by the terms of my letters of January 18th and 22nd last. You will remember that we purposely refrai ned from going into too much detail in this correspondence, holding that, in practice, the satisfactory working of the arrangements made would depend to a great extent on mutual goodwill and on give and take on all sides. We would prefer not to attempt to define exactly what the position will be, further than it is already defined in the above-mentioned letters. In particular, it would be impossible for us to give any undertaking that the Minister at Tehran will never take action in matters affecting the Persian Gulf until the Political Resiaent has had an opportunity of stating his views.

We need not, I think, ) both you on the question of the telegraph arrangements in the period subsequent to the transfer of the Residency. Much will depend on what ultimately happens about the wireless station at Henjam. Nor is it necessary to trouble you on the question of the recess arrangements, for from the correspondence ycxi will see that the Government of India propose to maintai n the present practice as regards the retention of a duty officer at the headquarters of the Resident during the recess. 3. I shall be glad to know whether you concur general ly in paragraph 2 of the Government of India’s letter on the question of the consular arrangements in the Gulf after the removal of the Residency. Broadly speaking, I think that their letter accurately states the effect of the arrangements reached between the Foreign Office and the India Office at the beginning of this year, save on one point - that is, the reference to the position at merman and at Ahwaz. You will remember that the demi-c£ ficia 1 corresp ondence/ C.W. Baxter Esq., M.G., Foreign Office, S. W. 1.correspondence between us out of vfcich those arrangements emerged made no reference to future arrangements at either of these posts. On the India Office side at any rate the assumption was that the status quo m uld continue to be maintained in its entirety unless and until some change in the method of staffing the Vice—Consulate at Ahwaz and the Consulate at Kerman was decided on in agreement between the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office. Neither post is on the Gulf, and our correspondence was directed solely to reaching an agreement as to the position in the case of the posts actually/m the Gulf under the new system, 4. If you agree, I suggest that we might inform the Government of India that their statement of the arrangements which have been reached between the Foreign Office and the India Office is accepted as correct save as regards Ahwaz and Kerman; that the position of thef Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz and the Consulate at Kerman fall outside the scope of the discussion between our two Departments at the beginning of this year; and that while no alteration of the status quo as regards the method of appointment to those posts, and the relation of their incumbents to the Political Resident, is contemplated or would be approved save after prior consultation with the Government of India, those arrangements should not be regarded as covering them.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the Government of Indian telegram Ho.1681-3, dated the 25th May 1930, I am directed to convey the folloY/ing remarks regarding certain subsidiary questions arising out of the proposed removal from Bushire of the headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*.- (1) Extension of cable to Bahrein* In view of the heavy cost involved in laying a cable to Bahrein the Government of India are prepared to agree that, provided that adequate wireless communication is established, cable communication is unnecessary. In the event however of the Persian Government insisting that the Henjam wireless station shall only be used for communication with His Majesty’s Ships, it will be necessary to modernise the existing Y/ireless station at Bahrein. It is pointed out further that as the very considerable telegraphic correspondence of the Political Resident will from Bahrein be conductedconducted entirely by wireless, it will probably be necessary to employ a cypher system specially designed for use by wireless. This may involve an increase of the Political Resident’s cypher staff and possibly in other cypher bureaux also. .k Qnsu l ar arrangements. The Government of Indi a have no desire at all to interfere with the arrangements which have been reached with the Foreign Office. Translated into practice they understand that these will be as follows;- (a) Appointments to His Majesty’s Consumes at Bandar Abbas and Kerman and to the Vice-Consulates at Ahwaz and Mohammerah will continue to be filled from the Indian Political Department , (b) If a new appointment of Consul or Vice- Consul at Bushire is created, it also will be filled from this Department, (c) These five officers will be subordinate to the Political Resident for adminis trative purpo ses, (d) Besides submitting Intelligence Reports, Diaries, etc. to the Political Resident, the officers holding these five posts will address him on all matters affecting the Persian Gulf or likely to have repercussioi s on the Arab littoral of the Gulf. Copies of such correspondence and of the Political Resident’s replies will of course be sent simultaneously to His Majesty’s Minis ter at Tehran, but it will be understood that the Minister will taka no act ion in such matters, until the Political Resident has had an opportunity of/stating his views. I am to ask whether His Majesty's Secretary of State for India accepts this as a correct interpretation or whether he considers its mouifioat ion in any respect necessary. f3) R£°ess arrangements. The Government of India generally concur in the views expressed by Colonel Biscoe in paragraph 3 of his memorandum iJo.6Q-b, dated the 18th February 1930, a copy of vfoich was forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter No.26(A)-M, aated the 1st March 1930. But except that the Resident will no longer go to Shiraz, the suggested move of the Residency from Bushire really introduces no new factor into the situation. The present practice, of which a statement is made in Government of India telegram to Bushire of 26th April 192 9, copy sent with Foreign Secretary’s weekly .letter Ho,18-T, dated the 1st May 1929, may therefore in the opinion of the Government of India very well continue, with such slight alterations as experience may hereafter dictate.

She decision of H.M.G. to remove the headquarters of tne Political Resident in the Persian Gulf from Persia, was taken primarily because of the value which oir Robert Clive represented the Persians would attach to this concession, and secondly, because of the advantages which we should ourselves derive from the location of one Resident on the Arab littoral of the Gulf. The decision was taken largely in deference to strong pressure from the Foreign Office and Air Ministry, and was only reluctantly accepted by the Government of India and the present Resident. Bahrein (subject to the concurrence of the Sheikh) has been accepted as the site to which the Resident's headquarters shall be transferred, if and v\/hen the transfer takes place. The Persians have been informed that, subject to certain relatively minor provisos, designed to secure the position of the Resident during the period for which he remains at Bushire, and his communications with the Persian littoral in the period subsequent to transfer, we are prepared, in the near future, as part of the general treaty settlement, to remove tne Residency from Persia* The treaty negotiations are, however, temporarily suspended and, in so far as removal has been decided on solely as a concession uo Persia there is no reason why any further action should * / fat P 2. te taken at this stage./ fOnWhT other hand, it is novy^ accepted at this end, that it is to our own interest to move sooner or later. The arrangements for removal, and for the building of a new Residency &amp;c., will take time and involve much inter-departmental discussion. If we are, in any case, going to leave Persia, there is much.to be said for starting our preparations at once,as-suggested by the Foreign Office in their letter of 13 November, now submitted, but, subject to such precautions against giving publicity to our intentions, as will enable us to try to turn this concession to value once the negotiations are resumed. j' The first question for consideration is whether the decision is irrevocable. The Government of India have always been lukewarm, if not hostile to removal. There is reason to believe that Colonel Biscoe is equally so. Againstit there are the facts that a move would be extremely costly, would cause great inconvenience, may *lr result in some loss Vw prestige, and will out off the Resident to a large extent from the south Persian littoral. On the other hand, the decision was largely based on arguments of oonvenienoe to us, and all these consideration, were present to H.M.G. when they took it. Very strong opposition from the Foreign Office and Air Ministry may:' be anticipated to any attempt to reopen it. Moreover, it is a decision which has been approved by the C.X.D. ar ‘ d ti ‘ e Gablnet &gt; not only in connection with the Persian egotiations, but as one of the recommendations of the /arren-FisJher Committee on political control, and it could not be reversed without a further reference to the tlie Gablnet - Finally, recent developments a' show increasingly that the Persians are able, i they wish, to make the Resident's position extremely’ iffioult. They have already created an embarrassing situation by interference with his mails. They propose to PU S St ° P t0 hlS speoial consular mail after the 1st January 1931, an d by placing restrictions on visits of n ShlPS ’ ^ ^ ralSinS difficulties when the - - ieavesor enters Bushire on tour they can. largely reduce his usefulness b ^ ess.. we must, I think, regard the ecioion as for practical purposes ■' cA ttr ^ ^ 9U. 6au.

Department. 4 ' &lt;J3a 5000 10 30 At the same time, while Sir R.Clive either formed a false idea of the value of this concession as a makeweight in the Persian negotiations, or failed to play it for what it was worth, there is no reason .i/ny we should not try still to turn it to such advantage as we can once the negotiations resumed, probably next summer. if this view is accepted, it would be necessary to go slow and not to give way our intentions at the present stage. Action on the lines suggested in the Foreign Office letter of 13 November would, however, clearly indicate to the Persians that we have made up our minds in any case to settle in Bahrein, and the value of removal as a Ujv+XjA bargaining counter be gone. 5'! I suggest that we might consult the Government of India on the lines of the draft attached. It will give them an opportunity to come back on the general question if they wish to do so, and the first paragraph of their telegram 3549S of 25 October, suggests that they expect to be further consulted on the general question (which had been raised by the Resident in his telegram of 13 October, Uo.997, on P.7140/30). ft*- UA -[ (', £ t A r /♦' 1 . 4^2^ . / -Cf' {£ SlcUc^ if /v^/ ^ tjtydi ^7 &lt;=- ^ * k L 4 ^tuif ' ^ T-Cu+^rviA. 1 i*-c**&amp;J ^ X/,r 3' vkrWP 4l i 4 106 1000 3.30 ■ '' ■ nr v =-' draft telegram.

Yoa will have noticed from Clive T s telegram Do.112 of 1 Octooer 5th, to Biscoe about the Bushire Residency, that he has told leymoiirtaehe that arrangements 'could not be T feade to remove the Residency under a year or more.” Biscoe replied in his telegram Do.997 of October 13th that the transfer could not take place for two or three years. Whether Biscoe’s estimate of the length of time required for the transfer is correct or not we do not think that it would be desirable at the present moment to labour this point with the Persian Government. ^ *■ But we hope it will not take so long as three years before the Resident can be adequately housed at Bahrein, or wherever else on the Arabian side of the Gulf is chosen for his new headquarters. We had even hoped that this might be possible by the end of 1931. However this may be, we think it Laithwaite, Esq# jp.'fp 4 7 kO NOV 1930 Iit would le all to the good, if we could now consider whether any steps can he taken to expedite matters. If for example, the Sheikh of Bahrein agrees to the transfer of the Residency to Bahrein, could we not take steps forthwith to choose the site, and to obtain the concurrence of the authorities concerned in its acquisition? And could we not arrange lor building plans and estimates to be prepared, at any rate in a preliminary form, without delay? You will remember that the Treasury asked last January for an approximate estimate of the cost as soon as one could be prepared, and \ s /e are anxious to avoid any unnecessary delay at this end when the time comes to take a final decision.

Department. (5K Our letter, P. 485, of 20th January, 1950, to the Foreigi Office about Consular organisation in the Cfolf in the period subsequent to the transfer of the Residency, asked . (a) whether it was contemplated that the Consuls should be responsible in their Consular capacity to the Political Resident qua Consul-General, and whether the Resident would, under the arrangements suggested by the Foreign Office, retain the general control and direction of the Consulates on the Persian littoral; (b) as regards matters of political sigmificance, we suggested that the Government of India contemplates that the Resident should (i) continue to be wholly responsible for these Consular Officers as regards political intelligence and any political functions th ey may exercise; (ii) co-ordinate views expressed by them, relating them, if necessary, to any info neation available to him on the Arab shore, and should then advise His Fajesty’s Funster and the Government of India on the situation as a whole; (in) that with him should rest responsibility, at any rate in the first place, for questions of a general nature affecting the Gulf as a whole, subject, of course, to the instructions of higher authority outside certain defined limits for action on them. The Foreign Office replied (22nd January - P. 560) as follows: (a) It would be undesirable that Consular Officers in Persia should be m all respects subordinate to a Resident stationed outside Persia; (b) were ready to agree that Resident should have 1 a free hand in controlling preparation and submission of/ _____of political intelligence reports affecting Persian Gulf drawn up by Consular Officers in Persian ports; (c) no objection to his being able to instruct Consular Officers in Persian ports to submit to him such reports affecting Persian Gulf as he may desire; (d) impossible, however, to agree that Resident should be solely responsible for issuing instructions of a political nature to Consular Officers in Persian ports. It would be undesirable that Consul-General should, merely because his headquarters had been moved from Persia, be free to take without the prior approval of Tehran any action in respect of Persian political matters which he is at present precluded from taking without such approval as Consul-General Bushire. t r « i p far wuho «&gt; 4 * •f a* / The Government of India, in paragraph 2 of their '.'uocr of 6 th June on P. 3806/30, suggested that the effect of tiie arrangements above would be that the Consular Officers affected would - (a/ be subordinate to the Resident for administrative purposes; (Oy besides submitting intelligence reports, diaries, etc., to the Resident, address him on all natters affc.cuing ohe Persian Gulf or likely to have repercussions on the Arab littoral of the Gulf.

Ahwaz and Kerman, of course, fell outside the scope of the arrangements reached at the beginning of this year. As regards (c) and (d) of the government of India’s letter cf 6 th June, it will be seen from the note below the draft, read with paragraph 4 of tj submission on P. 560/30, flagged, that there is some substance in the Foreign Office objections. The whole question is one which will have to be considered more closely and in greater detail if and when the Residency is moved from Bushire.

I also enclose copy of a letter of acknowledgment from His Highness, dated the 4th of October, warmly thanking me for this communication and saying that in view cl the goodwill shown by His Majesty’s Government he hopes it will not be difficult to come to terms on tne few points that remain to be settled. 2* I gather from your telegram Ho. 202 o., ^ 1st of October that you consider that it was ill-advised on my part to have volunteered these further concessions as being likely to leave the Persians under the impression that His Majesty's Government were so anxious to make a treaty that they could ash almost ary terms they ^ liked. I regret that my action did not meet with your approval hut I venture none the less most respectfully to suggest that our position has not been in fact compromised-, by'by my action, I have the genuine impression that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs is anxious to come to terms with His Majesty* s Government and if it were not for the Minister of Court I believe that we should succeed in concluding a treaty. It was after a long and general discussion of the whole position that I came to offer these additional concessions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, not as an additional proof of our desire to make a treaty at any price with the Persian Government, but as an earnest of the goodwill of His Majesty* s Government and of her desire to remove all remaining points of potential friction between the two countries in the interests of mutual friendship . I had made it perfectly clear to His Highness in the early part of this conversation that a sine qua non of any treaty was the abandonment by the Persian Government of her claim to Bahrein and the two small isla,nds of Tamb and Bumusa. 3. How if we look more closely into tne actual concessions which were offered to His Highness what in fact do they amount to? A. Our decision to remove the Residency from Bushire. It is true that I was not then aware of the indiscretion of a Basrah newspaper which announced this fact to the world on September 12th giving as a reason, not the desire of His Majesty's Government to meet the wishes of the Persian Goverment but the desire in our own interest to be rid of Persian pinpricks and to facilitate the air route along the Arab coast. I submit, hoover, quite apart from this newspaperA' -newspaper disclosure, ■fch.at His Majesty’s G-overrnent, having definitely decided to remove the Residency, it was daily becoming more apparent that the sooner we did so the better. x x x x x x 5. I trust that you will not misunderstand my action in raising the question of what would be the attitude of the Persian Government after my departure on leave. I did not for a moment leave His Highness under the impression that we were afraid of their pinpricks. I told him that such a policy would in my opinion be so unutterably foolish and merely act as an irritant to good relations.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Rxce lie ncy ’ s note of to-day informing me of the decision taken by your Government to transfer the headquarters of the British Resident and Consul-General at Bushire to a site outside the dominions of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. In that note you also inform me of the desire expressed by your Government, with a view to ensuring the close coopers,tion of the British and Persian authoribi^ in the Persian Gulf, that this official should be accorded every facility for visiting British Consular posts in the Persian ports of the Gulf. Excellency that my Government will accord to the Inspecting Consul-General and to his staff the required facilities; they agree, in pait icul.rr, In reply I have the honour to inform Your these persons shall enjoy on all occasions unrest -1 icue access to British Consular posts in the Persian ports of the Gulf, and they will make the necessary arrangements for the annual grant to then of a free visa valid for at least a year. WithMtn regard to the last paragraph of your note under reference, I am authorised to confirm that a simple notification, given as faras possible in advance to the local authorities, will suffice to enable His Britannic Majesty's warships and the ships of the Royal Indian Marine stationed in the Persian Gulf, together with the vessels of the auxiliary fleet, to put in at Bushire.No. S.5398/2/91 THE Under-Se cretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India and, hy direction of the Secretary of St ate, transmit s herewith copies of the under-mentioned paper.

Sir, Aith reference to my immediately preceding despatch in which I reported the publication in the 'Umrn-al-Q.ura' of a leading article stigmatizing as lies the rumours of projected attacks on the Yemen and Trans-Jordan, I have the honour to add that tie earne article goes on to deal with other rumours connected with the Hej»z Air Force. 2, These rumours, it avers - although I had not myself heard them, would have it that Nejd had ceded part of its territory to a foreign power. For instance, the Govermerit had established an aerodrome for the British Government at Darin and this was the beginning of the establishment of British influence in those parts, it being the intention to transfer the Headquarters of the British Political HesidSnt in the Persian Gulf to Darin, 3. The editor explains that the truth of the matter is that the Goverrment purchased some aeroplanes last year as the nucleus of a military air force and had decided to employ some foreign pilots under contract for a fixed period in order to train Arab officers to fly. It had also been decided to station the air force at Jedda but military operations had necessitated its temporary quartering at Darin. As a natural consequence it had been prepare also necessary to / 6 ome aerodromes along the Hasa cdast oppos ite ajesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,opposite Darin Island. The circumstances which had led to tnis temporary use of Darin having changed, the air force had been transferred to Jedda. 4. The article is supported by an official statement declaring to be absolutely groundless the rumours published in the press that Darin was to be occupied as a 3r it ish aeiodrome and as the British Residency in the Persian Gulf. 5. Being of necessity ill served &amp;ere with news of the outer v/orld I am unable to say whether such rumours have really been published or whether they have oeen put up as skittles in order to impress people wiuh the very independence of this would-be very independent count ry. 6 .

It is regrettable that rumours of our intentions have obtained currency. It would have been distinctly preferable to postpone any action or any announcement to the Sheikh of Bahrein until we had secured from the Persians abandonment of their claim to | his islands. It is possible that the Persians in fact | might make a grievance of our intention to establish | the Residency in Bahrein while this question still remains unsettled. I have discussed the matter unofficially with the Foreign Office. They tell me thatJSheikh HafizwabhaTyesterday interviewed Mr . Oliphant and enquired whether there was any truth in this rumour, which had also reached the Hejaz Government. Mr. Oliphant replied that he must not believe everything that was seen in the papers.44^ is j ^ anxious that the Hejaz Government should get warning of our intention to move before any public announcement is made. The Foreign Office, on the whole, are now disposed (to think that we had better at the first convenient opportunity sound the Sheikh of Bahrein as to his willingness to agree to the transfer of the Residency to his islands. It will be for consideration whether something should be said to him at once, in view of the rumours that are flying about, or whether ?/e I j can 4494A 5000 5 30\ can wait until the Political Resident visits Bahrein early in November. I agreed that we should consult the Foreign Office on the subject immediately officially. v •'hile it has been generally accepted for some months past that Bahrein is to be the new headquarters of the Resident (compare my note of 11th April on P. 1909/30), we have never^secured Foreign Office and Colonial Office concurrence in its choice. Both Departments tell me that they are satisfied with Bahrein, but it will be well to ts.ke the present opportunity of securing their official concurrence. Draft letters are submitted. /V 7?

It mu Id have been preferable, if possible, to avoid any communication to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the subject until the treaty negotiations with Persia had reached a satisfactory conclusion and, the Persian claim to Bahrein had been abandoned. In the ill light of the latest developments the Secretary of State is, however, disposed, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for/// Foreign Affairs /jthe Colonies andT and the cecretary of State for Foreign affairs, to think that steps ought to be taken without further delay to sound the Sheikh of Bahrein as to his willingne to agree to the transfer of the Residency to his islands in due course. From Colonel Biscoe’s telegram of 3rd October, do. 885, it will be seen that the Resident hopes to visit Bahrein early in November, and unless the Government of Inaia and the Resident are of opinion that the rumours now reported from Basra, to which reference is made in Tehran telegram, No. 249 0 f| -do October, to the Foreign Office, make an earlier communication, possibly by the/Draft Paper. / Department. the Political Agent, desirable, Mr. Benn is cod—to—thi-nk that this opportunity should be taken of obtaining the Sheikh’s acquiescence. ^ -S-Q oretary Header son accepts Lora Pass!'ieid this vie?/, Mr. Benn would propose to address the Government of India as in the telegram of which a draft is enclosed. {I S IM* UIECa. 4 &amp; Cti_ 4.

His Highness assured me that he resented the petty and discourteous attitude adopted by Persian postal authorities and had taken steps to prevent recurrence. Also assured me that our consular bags would be treated not less favourably than Soviet bags. j I then drew his attention to out generous proposals regarding Residency and said that as arrangements could not be made to remove Residency under a year or more 1 counted on your continuing to receive the same facilities as in the past.

I was convinced that Persian government would not formally raise question of residency. On the other hand they would cent airily, as they are already doing hy pin pricks and obstruction over consular bags, try to make position of resident more and more difficult. It seems to me that here was an opportunity for Kis Majesty's Government to withdraw resident from Bushire with dignity end even incur gratitude, if such a thing is possible of Persian government, 4.

At interview with Minister for Foreign Affairs today 1 told His Highness that if we were to. make a, treaty Persia must renounce her claims to Bahrein and to the Islands of Iamb and Bumusa. ^ur attitude on this point had been finally and definitely made clear in memorandum of September 11th. In order however to show good will of my government and their desire to go as far as possible to meet the wishes of the Persian Government and in the words of the Minister of Court to liquidate the past I enumerated three further concessions which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to make. I. To proceed at once to liquidation of undo .European Telegraph Department m very geneious terms. 2. To accept probable counter proposals subject to certain reservations as a basis for settling question oi Dusnap railway. r; rp q p amove Besidency from Bush ire as soon as provision could be made for accommodation of resident elsewhere. these far reaching concessions would not only involve His Majesty's Government in considerable fin ancial sacrifice but were an outstanding proof of their desi-e to remove the last traces of anything which might he./r&gt; 'be held to be an infringement of Persian sovereign rights* An object of treaty was to settle all outstanding questions I trusted that Persian Government when they had considered, these further concessions would drop claim to the three Islands. Minister for Foreign Affairs was very guarded* He suggested omitting from treaty all mention of the Islands . I said this was impossible and he promised to report what I had said to his colleagu.es. I warned him that if they persisted in this attitude there was no chance of making a treaty and I again emphasised the great generosity of these concessions. He then handed me letter in reply to memorandum of September 11th. 1 mention the following points. (A) Regarding telegraphs.he says he is sure His Majesty 1 s Government will not impose on Persia conditions of a convention whose validity might be questioned. (B) Debt. After reviewing position he states Persia feels justified in again begging His Majesty s Government to cancel remainder of war deot, (0) He agrees to claims article which should oxovide for reciprocal engagement to meet claims of the other party, maimer in which they are to fee verified, and method of payment. (D) He will only agree to visit of warsnips Toy noti fication to Abadan in order to fuel 'for fear of creating precedent with other powers'. (S) Note maintains attitude already auopucd about lamb and Bumusa (this of course was written prior to my c onv sr sat i on t oday) • (F) Regarding Bahrein he proposes J „ RVorr-'-n &lt;*n independent sovereign, state in na&amp;ch oiSo-r banxein ho kj 'w&gt;' _ /case as he points out a treaty article would he out of the question or to submit question to arbitration or to come to terms on basis already put forward. (G) He agrees to enumeration of treaties and to publication of all notes exchanged. He. then enumerates these treaties etc. ('irrespective of degree of their validity') and mentions 1920 agreement but not treaty of 1341. He told me he had never heard of treaty of 1841. (H) He asks for a special article about double income tax. On this latter point I told him we would not agree, 'question had nothin^, to do wit** tnio Cj. vulq and could be settled apart.
