Subject, therefore, to Mr. Secretary Henn's concurrence, Mr. Henderson proposes, while leaving Sir .Robert ulive full discretion, to suggest to him that it would be advantageous to return a 'brief reply containing, if possible,,, the further A*.4* ViA &gt; v information asked for in paragraphs 7' and 8 of the Persian Government's note, and adding, as regards the remainder, that, f while the statements and arguments advanced in the note are inaccurate, and cannot 'be accepted by His Majesty's Government, no useful purpose would he served hy continuing the corres pondence.

In view, however, of the facts set forth- in Mr. CDwyer's despatch under reference, it is clear that the Persian Government are not altogether without justification in refusing to accept responsibility for the fact that Haji i Hamid proceeded to ^raq. rather than Bahrein. On the occasion of his first deportation he was actually given the choice between India, Bahrein and 1 Iraq., and himself chose the last-named, while on the second occasion, though it is true that no adequate arrangements were made for his trans shipment at Bushire, it is nevertheless a fact that he pre ferred to proceed to India, whence the police returned him to Basrah., rather than to Bahrein. Any further protest on that score would therefore merely give rise to more incon clusive arguments which would not in any way better Haji Hamid*s position. o.... T.C.W. Fowle C.B.E. , Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.3. I agree with Mr, 0*Dwyer that the reference in the latest Persian note to Haji Haiaid*s intiigaes in »iraq. is absurd, and the true facts relating to his return, after his first expulsion, to Mohammerah, are highly discreditable to the already 'been brought to the notice of the Persian Go-wernment (in the person of the Minister ot Court) in my letter of September 14th 1929, which formed the enclosure to my despatch noxe is xoo vague to permit of any conclusive argument. 4. I have had under consideration the possibility of making another appeal to the Persian Government to allow Ha^i Hamid to return to Mohammerah to wind up his affairs. I have, however, come to the conclusion that even if the appeal were allowed, there would be no guarantee that the man would not be subjected to still further molestation at the hands of the local authorities, and that in view of the fact that some other person could presumably be deputed by him to wind up his affairs it would be undesirable at this stage to press again for such a favour. In my opinion the time has now come to acknowledge that all efforts to induce the Persian Government to take a more reasonable view of this case have failed, and that apart from the possibility of adopting general retaliatory measures, such as those recently suggested by Colonel Biscoe to the Go-remment of India, no further action is possible vis -a -vis of the Persian Government. Were Haji Hamid a British subject by klrth, he would have no claim on His Majesty's Government for maintenance in the country to viiich he Persian Consul at Basrah But these circumstances have date to you, and the wording of the Persian3 lie liad been expelled.* Wkiether, in view of the adverse effect of this case on British prestige in Bahrein, it is advisable to assist him in his present penury, is a matter upon which I am not competent to pronounce, nor do I know whether there are any funds at your disposal which could be devoted to that pur pose. I should be glad to receive your views on these points, and should welcome any other practical suggestion which you may have to make with a view to bettering Ha^i Hamid»s present lot, for he has unquestionably been the victim of a most unjust persecution. 5.

H, a. JAK IHS*PREFATORY NOTE. In view of the increased pressure on the Legation at Jedda, it has been decided, with the approval of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to issue these reports at intervals of two months in future. It is hoped that this will not materially reduce their value to the recipients and that it will enable the Legation to issue the reports more punctually; although on the present occasion special reasons have caused delay. The following arrangement will be adopted in future— The main divisions will be retained with Roman numerals and cross-headings. Sub-sections will be shewn by unnumbered cross-headings. The paragraphs will be numbered consecutively throughout to facilitate back-reference. This opportunity is taken of mentioning that the spelling JEDDA is consecrated by Foreign Office usage. Whatever may be said for or against it, it is convenient that the place where the Legation is should be known in official English by a fixed name. If other posts can reconcile it with their philological principles to adopt the Foreign Office version, it will be much appreciated. The Legation is conscious of many defects in its own spelling and will welcome suggestions from other posts as to the spelling of important place-names in their respective spheres.1I ktebkal A ffairs. of i ,• L King to M ?? ca ' Januar y 20 ' and s P eiit tte wfcob the iiiontl, On j C f )! e 10 'I 3 ; lebluar y 2S, Mid stayed over the end of «..nt a tw t I ■ 7 f il 8 a r iV f l a formal reception of foreign repie- M rt ^ r pnnci \ 1 Ject of ^ 7 * was t0 receive the rich American Mi.

The foreign representatives weie also present and the King entertained them and Mr. Crane at dinner the same ev emng. On the following day he honoured Mr. Philby with his company at tea the principal members of the party being much the same. Ibn Sa'ud appeared to have derived benefit from his visit to Nejd and was in his best form during his stay m Jed da. The unusual coolness and pleasantness of the climate earned his commendation. Minis fa y of Foreign Affairs.- The unsatisfactory state of affairs resulting from the iLness of Fuad Bey Hamza [December report, paragraph 1 (6)] continued 11 irolighout January and no business could, be done by personal interview. Tho Amir Faisal visited Jedda on January 8 and 9 for the celebration of the King's Accession. He received Sir A. Ryan at a specially arranged interview on January 8 but it was almost entirely of a formal nature. It was afterwards explained that lie had visited Jedda as Viceroy of the Hejaz only. He returned on January 28, accompanied by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Owing to Fuad Bey's illness which culminat- ed in his departure for Egypt on January 30, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin became Acting Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, remaining at the same time Private Secretary, Head of the Political Section of the Divan and general factotum to the King. The Prince having formally received the foreign representatives, apparently with some exceptions, on Janua,ry 29, arranged to receive His Majesty's Minister for business on January SO. When Sir A. Eyan went to keep this appointment, the Palace resembled that of the Sleeping Beauty, with the Beauty and nearly every one else in the background. Neither the Prince, Under-Secretary, A. D. C. or servants were to be seen and Sir A. Ryan left, after a lively conversation with the A. D. C. who appeared as he was going out. In the event it appeared that the prin cipals has a good excuse for everything except mismanagement. The Prince had been taken ill after going to Mosque. Sheikh Yusuf had been seeing Fuad Bey off and was greatly taken aback when Sir A. Ryan passed him without stopping on his way back to the Legation. As for the subordinates they were doubtless sleeping through the Ramadhan fast. Notwithstanding all this, the reception accorded to the British representative on his first business visit to a new Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared to be too cavalier to be tolerated. Sir A. Ryan demanded satisfaction and after a first insufficient attempt tojolacate him. Sheikh Yusuf called and offered an unqualified apology. All was thus happily settled by dinner time. 3 . This incident, although regrettable, cleared the air. Sir A. Ryan had let it be known that he expected his formal visit to be returned, a courtesy which a Minister of princely rank might have thought he could dispense with. The Amir called on the foreign representatives on February 1 and stayed half an hour at the British Legation. He had on the previous day received Sir R. Ryan for business but after his round of visits he collapsed with severe malaria. He returned to Mecca on February 3 or 4 and went into the country for change. Sheikh Yusuf remained and put in much work before going back to Mecca on February 6. He proved more reasonable in discussion than had been anticipated. His Chief, the Amir, recovered in due course but up to the end of February he shewed no interest in or capacity for foreign Affairs. Sheikh Yusuf effectively dealt with them throughout MC59FDthe whole period. He is very much the King's man and Ibn &amp;a ud has shewn a tendency to put him in the forefront, although it is clear that he himself still pulls the strings. 4. Finance. —The financial situation went from bad to worse early in the year. Pilgrims have come forward in somewhat greater numbers than was anticipated but the total number from overseas seems unlikely to exceed 50,000. Revenue must suffer accordingly. The two most notable indications of Treasury straits have been a heavy increase in customs duty on most staple imports, which was announced in the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of February 6th ; and a temporary decline of the silver currency, which became acute in February. The silver riyal, the value of which is officially fixed at 10 to the gold pound sterling slumped to 13 or even lower in Jedda and Mecca. The Government found themselves short of gold, although it always seems possible to produce some at a pinch. They made strong efforts to restore the balance between riyalsand pounds. It may be said in anticipation of the next report that they succeeded, but only by prohibiting the export of gold and by arrangements with the Dutch Bank in Jedda, the exact nature of which has not been disclosed, to accept riyals at 10 plus a small margin in payment for drafts on foreign countries. It was suggested that Mr. Crane might in some way come to the help of Ibn Sa'ud. There is no indication that he did so. Further rumours of American financial assistance were floated when, about the same time as Mr. Crane, Mr. Dickerson, the Commercial Secretary of the United States Legation at Cairo, visited Jedda in the course of an extensive tour. On hearing that the bazaars were talking of an American loan to the tune of £1,000,000, Mr. Dickerson laughed. 5. His Majesty's Minister took up with Sheikh T usuf Yasin on February 5th the outstanding claims of the Government of India, the Eastern Telegraph Company and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company. [September to November report paragraph 3 (6).] The position at the end of February was that the Government of India claim was still completely in the air ; the Eastern Telegraph Company had some prospect of being paid, but the Government were trying hard to engineer a settlement in riyals ; and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey's situation was a good deal easier. In the last named case the financial authorities on February I deposited with the firm 55,000 riyals, with promise of redemption in six weeks to cover the balance of £5,000 still due in respect of their loan to the Government. At one moment it looked as though they might be hit by a refusal to accept drafts on Customs, of which they held large quantities, in payment of duty, this being the only means of realizing them without loss. The idea of thus dishonouring their own drafts was, however, relinquished by the Government. The wages of the unfortunate Sudanese chauffeurs [December report paragraph (2)] were still greatly in arrear at the end of February. 6. The Government are heavily indebted in other directions. They are said to owe the Qusaibi firm some £80,000 and the rich Governor of Jedda £4,000. In January, however, the Director of the Dutch Bank expressed the view that the whole floating debt did not exceed £500,000 and that the country should be solvent with good management. Good management is unfortunately the last thing than can be hoped for. The only economy consistently practised is that of evading payment of debts although certain services are starved, e.g., the supply of doctors in the sanitary service has decreased in recent years. 7. General. —There was no news of any important development in the interior in January and February, although silly rumours of the usual kind were circulated in connection with the King's visit to Nejd, how, for instance, there had been dissension in the Royal family ; the King had practically fled from Riadh, etc. Early in January there were reports, more substantial in appearance of trouble with the Ajman tribe but they were not confirmed. 8. Ibn Sa'ud's accession was celebrated in the Hejaz on January 8th and 9th in a manner similar to that of last year (Report for January 1930, paragraph 23). The view held by some that such celebrations are un-Islamic seems to have been definitely set aside. 9. Much excitement was aroused in February on its being announced that on the second day of the 'Id festival there had been a war dance at Mecca in whiche mg himself had taken part together with several of the princes. According o one account this was the sequel to a demonstration by Meccans on the previous day, the reception of which by the King proved to be favourable, whereupon the Kings own JMejdis, of whom a great number would appear to have come back with him from Rmdh, asked to be allowed to perform. This happy accident theory is discounted by the fact that a dance of the same kind, though on a smaller scale, was a leature of the celebration of the King's accession at a sort of official J He champet re between Jedda and Mecca on January 9th. Anyhow the Neidi dance was done again at a Bedouin review in Jedda on February 27th. On this occasion the King was present but only the princes took part led by the Emir JFeisal, who performed very gracefully in front of the diplomats accredited to the Government in which he is Minister for Foreign Affairs. Next day the Jeddawais a; ked to be allowed to shew what they could do and for several days demonstrations on a considerable scale took place outside the Palace. 10. These events have probably a political significance. The Nejdi dancing is a revival of a practice, which has it seems been in abeyance for 15 or 20 years^ although the skill shewn by the dancers proves that it must have been kept up somehow, even though not officially countenanced. It may be taken as a wor kin g theory, provided it be not assumed too confidently, that Ibn Sa'ud is anxious to efface some of the differences between the Hejaz and Nejd and is prepared to ride his subjects in both Kingdoms on a looser reign than is admitted by the extreme tenets of Wahhabism. Drums were a notable feature in the dancing demons trations and even more musical instruments have of late been tolerated. ' Ibn Sa'ud built formerly on an aggressive Wahhabism, which was turned against him by the rebels of 1929. He would now appear to be building on compromise with a world in which it pays to seek popularity and a flesh which in the Hejaz at least has always been weak. But he remains too good a Moslem to have much use for the devil, at any rate the foreign devil. 11. —FRONTIE R QUE STlONS . Tmnsjordan.—■MacDonnell Investigation. 11. No information reached Jedda during January and February regarding the action taken by His Majesty's Government on Mr. MacDonnell's report ; nor was any reply returned to the Hejazi Government's Note of December 24th regard ing the Beni Atiya [December Report, Section 5 (a)]. 12. Current raiding. —The lull noted in the December report. Section 5 continued until late in January. Trans-Jordan complained of one raid from Nejd on January 25th. Up to the end of February the Hejazi Government had alleged a raid from Trans-Jordan on a date between February 3rd and 7th and two others on February 10th and 13th. On three occasions His Majesty's High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan drew the attention of the Legation at Jedda to reports of preparations for raids. These reports were duly communicated to the M ini stry of Foreign Affairs. The Hejazi Government suggested that the first report had its origin in certain measures taken to collect taxes in the Wadi Sirhan. They indignantly denied the later report and ascribed them to the activities of Captain Glubb, the desert control officer in Trans-Jordan who had been appointed in pur suance of the programme adopted by His Majesty's Government last autumn. 13. Correspondence also passed regarding various 'raids alleged to have taken place in the latter part of 1930. In this, as well as in the correspondence relative to the raids and rumours of raids mentioned in the last paragraph, the Legation sought to impress on the Hejazi Government the importance of taking measures on their side as efficacious as those adopted in Trans-Jordan and more especially of arranging for direct communication between the authorities on both sides of the frontier, as provided in Article 3 of the Hadda Agreement. The correspondence thus bore not only on particular raids and rumours but on the general situation. Its details were, however, submerged in the crisis to be described in the following paragraphs. 14. General Frontier Situation. —While the correspondence mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs was proceeding, the visit of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin toJedda at last enabled Sir A. Eyan to carry out on February 3 his instructions [ De cember Report, Section 5 (c)] to discuss the general situation of the frontier orally. He took the Sheikh over the whole of the recent ground, reproached the Hejazi Government with their failure to reply seriously to the British Memorandum of October, disposed of the interim reply which had been their only attempt at a direct answer up to date and strongly deprecated the practical condonation of Nejdi raids in Fuad Bey Hamza's Note of November 29. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's reaction was unexpectedly favourable. He indeed made play with arguments on his own side. He developed the thesis that His Majesty's Government were really responsible for Trans-Jordan and that their interposition between the parties served as a protection to Trans-Jordanian raiders. He manifested openly the hostility of his Government towards Captain Glubb, a hostility dating from the time when that officer was employed in the Southern Desert of 'Iraq. He explain ed, however, that the Hejazi Government were preparing a statement of the measures they were taking on their side of the frontier. He added that the King was taking active steps to bring Article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation. His Majesty had appointed Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Zeid, the former Hejazi Agent at the MacDonnell investigation, to be Inspector of Bedouin on the frontier, En-Neshmi had been removed from the Governorate of Jauf. The Sheikh asked for suggestions as to the best means of providing for the communication contem plated in Article 3 of the Hadda Agreement, 15. Before this conversation was reported home a storm of indignation had been aroused in Downing Street by a report from Captain Glubb. This report dealt mainly with the situation resulting from the last considerable raid from Nejd, which had taken place in October and the victims of which were the Howaitat tribe. Captain Glubb's main conslusions were that the Howaitat, deprived of the camels then captured, were in a state of starvation and could not easily be res trained from counter-raiding, specially as their 800 or more camels were known to be pasturing close to the frontier on the other side ; that Ibn Sa'ud seconded by En-Neshmi was directly responsible for the raids conducted or encouraged by the latter in 1930 ; and that the King was pursuing a deliberate policy of seducing the Howaitat into his own allegiance, a plan which, if successful, would be disastrous to British prestige. Captain Glubb's views were endorsed, subject to some differences on points of detail by the principal British authorities in Trans-Jordan, including His Majesty's High Commissioner, who expressed a even more serious view of the consequences of a secession of Trans-Jordan Bedouins to Ibn Sa'ud, in view of the difficult situation it would create in the event of trouble in Palestine. 16. On February 6 the Foreign Office instructed Sir A. Ryan to make the strongest possible representations. As these instructions had in effect crossed his report on his own recent action, he suggested that, having regard to the more favourable turn taken by his conversations in Jedda, it might be unwise to take so strenuous a line as that contemplated at home. There ensued an active corres pondence the result of which was that the Foreign Office consented to an attempt being made to reach an understanding with Ibn Sa'ud but indicated the lines on which the representations were to be made to him in a precise memorandum, the terms of which were in no way to be weakened and a copy of which was to be left with the King, if Sir A. Ryan thought it advisable. Every effort was to be made to obtain a definite reply within four days and the King was to be informed, if necessary, that this was expected by His Majesty's Government. 17. On receipt of his final instructions His Majesty's Minister, who had con templated a strong but conversational [onslaught on the King, thought that, as the basis of the representations was to be a long memorandum in set terms, it would after all be better to communicate it first to the Hejazi Government and see the King afterwards. His Majesty's Government having concurred, the Legation forwarded it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on February 28, slightly modified in accordance with suggestions made by His Majesty's High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan. The memorandum was accompanied by a short covering Note requesting an early audience to discuss the question and intimating His Majestv's Government's desire to obtain a definite reply to their memorandum as soon as possible. A separate Note sent earlier in the same day, also under instructions, strongly repudiated the aspersions which had been cast on Captain Glubb in the course^of the conversations and correspondence in February.18. Tn taeir memorandum of February 28 His Majesty's Government pro- pounded the following points m the nature of suggestions or demands with the necessary explanatory comments :— ' (1) Noting Ibn Sa'ud's expressed readiness to bring Article 3 of the Hadda agreement into operation and having in view the proved necessity for immediate co-operation between the authorities on both sides of the frontier, they proposed, in pursuance of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's request for suggestions as to be' method of initiating such co-operation, that Captain Grlubb and Ibn Zeid should meet to examine all representatives and claims regarding raids since August 1 ; (6) to arrange for immediate restoration of loot on both sides ; and (c) to arrange'for the intercommunication of information and mutual restoration of loot in future. (2) They asked that Ibn Zeid should be invested with full executive powers and that he and Captain Glubb should have power to call upon the representative Sheikhs to put forward claims, etc. (3) Having explained the inability of the Trans-Jordan authorities to main tain the recent improvement of the situation unless immediate steps should be taken to return the loot captured from their tribes since August 1, His Majesty's Govern ment dwelt on various flagrant features of those raids, including the proved culpability of En-Neshmi and his public statement that Ibn Sa'ud permitted raiding into Trans-Jordan, a statement widely believed and not effectively disproved. They said they ' must insist that if this has not already been done, the strongest measures should be taken to counteract the effect of En-N hmi's action in giving countenance to raiding and to make it publicly known that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz expressly disavows and condemns it '. They expressed hope that a recent report of En-Neshmi's appointment to the Command of tribal forces would prove to be unfounded. (4) They asked the Hejazi Government to inform them as soon as possible that they agreed to the proposed meeting and that Ibn Zeid would receive full powers to deal with the matters proposed including the immediate restitution of camels and other loot captured from Trans-Jordan tribes since August 1. They added that Captain Glubb would be authorized to arrange for the restitution of any loot identi fied as having been taken by Hejazi or Nejdi tribes. (5) Finally His Majesty's Government, having regard to the urgent necessity for restoring the camels looted from Trans-Jordan, offered British co-operation in the Wadi Sirhan, if the Hejazi Government should find themselves confronted with any practical difficulty in returning it immediately. 19. The sequel to this firm all-but-ultimatum will be related in the next report. To complete the present section it is only necessary to add that during the period under review it was decided under Captain Glubb's advice to introduce various modifications into the scheme adopted last autumn for the improvement of the fron tier control on the Trans-Jordan side. 20. Dtuzg Refugees in Nejd. —The question of the disposal of Sultan al-Atrash and his followers, who have for some time been in Nejd close to the Trans-Jordan frontier, again engaged attention early in the year. There were last year two alternative proposals, viz. , that Ibn Sa ud should be asked to move them further into the interior or that arrangements should be made for the party to be allowed to settle in 'Iraq. No decision had apparently been taken up to the end of February. The presence of the refugees so close to it is a thorn in the side of Trans-Jordan. According to one account, which cannot be vouched for, the French are for their part displeased with Ibn Sa'ud for affording hospitality to the party. • ' I raq. 21. Bon Voisinage, etc. —Following on the transactions related in Section 6(a) of the December Report and after further consultations between Baghdad and London, King Feisal telegraphed to Ibn Sa'ud on February 7 proposing that his Prime Minister should take advantage of a recess of the ' Iraq Parliament to visit Jedda immediately after Ramadhan in order to sign the Bon Voisinage Treaty, and discuss all outstanding questions including extradition. A Baghdad telegram to the r'nlnnial Office of February 8 showed that Nun Pasha also proposed to deal with claS trade facilities, and pilgrim traffic, besides showing and explaining to Ibn MC59FD6 Sa'ud the ne^ Traq Trans-Jordan Treaty (wMcit he was to sign at Amman af and discussing the case of Ibn Mashhur. Ibn Sa'ud replied at once in terras of cordial acquiescence. Things looked all the rosier because it was known that the 'Iraq Government were not so uncompromising about extradition as might have been supposed from their letter of the middle of December and becauase Ibn Sa'ud on his side, accepted in a letter written by his Minister for Foreign Affairs on Jan uary 29 King Feisal's explanation regarding his £30,000 award, adding only that the money would be paid when a settlement of other outstanding questions had been reached. A more conciliatory letter of the former point was addressed by the 1ra&lt;j Oovernment to the Hejazi Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February I . 22. Alas for the roses that bloomed in Baghdad ! When Ibn Fa'ud was at the height of his pleasurable anticipation and full Of preparations for the reception of Nuri Pasha, the latter sent a message on February 18 through Sir F. Humphrys and Sir A. Ryan expressing regret that owing to delay over pending oil negotia tions, he was compelled to postpone his visit. TTts delay aroused suspicions in the Hejazi mind, which the Legation in Jedda sought to allay. Things would not have been so bad, had the delay been short or had not the Baghdad press announced that Nuri Pasha was to visit Jedda on Ibn Sa'ud's invitation to discuss the Arab Alliance. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin came to see Sir A. Ryan on February 26, waving a Baghdad newspaper in which this tendentious statement was attributed to JSTuri Pasha himself. In the course of a long conversation on the whole position Sir A. Ryan administered all the soothing syrup he could but the outlook was not a Happy one at the end of February. 23. IhnMashhur. —This question of course bobbed up again. It always does. On January 7 the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote a mild note to the Lega tion paying a tribute to King Feisal's attitude and enquiring as to the number and names of the companions of Ibn Mashhur whom it was proposed to hand and the arrangements proposed for their delivery. While this was still under consideration, the Minister produced a further Note of January 29, which alia strongly resented the responsibility of His Majesty's Government for the .surrender of Ibn Mashhur and explained that he had the King's instructions to discuss the matter orally with His Majesty s Minister with a view to elucidating the attitude of his Government. The Note put two specific questions as to (1) what had passed between His Majesty's Government and the French Government re garding the passage of Ibn Mashhur through Syria and (2) what would be the atti tude of His Majesty's Government if Ibn Mashhur should enter territory under British influence, a-fj., Palestine or Trans-Jordan. The Note ended with an offensive remark that on the rep!} depends, to a great extent, the degree of confidence to be placed m official Government promif es 24. This Note led to two conversations, the first with the Emir Feisal and Sli eikh Yusuf Yasin on January 31, the second With the Sheikh alone on Februarv 1. Sir A. Ryan engaged m them not only because of the wish expressed bv the Emir but also because he wished to give His Majesty's Government plentv of time to consider their attitude. In the first conversation he stated the position as he himseli saw it, giving reasons why in bis opinion His Majesty 's Government had never had a formal responsibility for the return of Ibn Mashhur, thomrh thev had done all m their power to promote it. He strongly objected to the concluding phrase in the Minister s Note and elicited a lame explanation that it referred to the va ue not of British but Iraqi promises. The second conversation was acrimo- mous but fertile. ? 5 o cro PP ed U P a g ain in tlie discussion on February 26 (see nara- graph 22) of the general position between-Iraq and Hejaz-Neid Sheikh YW remarked that hi. Government had been willfng to postpone tie Ibn Malldte question until it could be discussed with Nuri Pasha and had refrained from pub licity. He accused the Iraq Government of having rushed into print with their version and suggested that the Hejazi Government might have to alter their attitude He was referring, it appeared, to the leading article in the 'Near East' of Februarv 5' v attention to the letter in the same paper of December 25' m which Mr. Philby, a person known to be m the closest touch with thetieiaS Government, had publicly ventilated their grievance in more ovfr^ro I ? than they themselves had officially given it, for Mr; Philby had not onlfaccusedHis Majesty's Government of failure to fulfil an obligation but had stated that the obligation was one which they had admitted. The rest of the conversation on this point is not worth recording. 26. On February 2 the Legation had forwarded to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a list received from Baghdad of persons and property which they prepared to hand over on the frontier at any date convenient to Ibn Sa'ud. In reply to an advance intimation of this on February 1, Sheikh Yusuf remarked that no arms were mentioned. This gave rise to some inconclusive correspondence between Sir F. Humphrys and the 'Iraqi Government and Sir Francis thought the matter had better be left for Nuri Pasha to discuss in Jedda. As for the Emir Feisal's Note of January 28, which directly affected His Majesty's Government, they had not replied to it up to the end of February. Kowait and Bahrain. 27. Persian Gulf Negotiations. —There were no important developments in January and February in connection with the proposed discussion of Kowait ques tions, or, as Ibn Sa'ud would like it to be, a general discussion of ' Persian Gulf Questions A certain amount of correspondence passed on incidental matters with results which may be summed up as follows;— • * -5 ^ V ; H 1- V v? * - -• .. ■ r 1, - (а) The proposal that the Political Resident in Bushire should visit Ibn Sa'ud [December Report 7 (a)] followed the King to Riadh but reached him too late to be acted on. On his return to Mecca, he addressed a friendly letter to Sir A. Ryan on January 28 expressing regret and offering to receive Colonel Biscoe in Jedda. This suggestion was negatived by His Majesty's Government and Sir A. Ryan was ins tructed on February 4 to return a suitably polite reply. He conveyed the substance of this through Sheikh Yusuf Yasin but owing to various delays postponed any direct communication to the King until he could make it orally. The general position at the end of February was that it was hoped that an opportunity for a meeting between Ibn Sa'ud and Colonel Biscoe in Nejd might present itself later, and it was consider ed that there was no such emergency about the Kowait questions as to necessitate their being discursed before the autumn. Meanwhile it appears from various reports of the Political Resident that there has been a certain rapprochement between Ibn Sa'ud and the Sheikh of Kowait. (б) A suggestion was put forward in February that Colonel Biscoe might take advantage of Ibn Sa'ud's invitation to Jedda to write himself to the King. It was considered at the Legation that it would be better not to do this and to confine action for the time being to the communication referred to in the preceding sub paragraph. (c) His Majesty's Government decided in February to take a firm line with the 'Iraqi and Hejazi Governments regarding the allocation of the £10,000 paid by the Hejazi Government last summer in fulfilment of the promise given by Ibn Sa 'ud to Colonel Biscoe in January 1930. [See Report for September to November, 11(6).] It was arranged that £7,000 should be given to 'Iraq and £3,000 to Koweit, as originally intended. The necessary drafts were sent by the Legation to Baghdad and Bushire on February 10 and the Hejazi Government were duly informed. They did not reply but it is clear from the earlier correspondence and various conversa tions that they are unlikely to contest the allocation, which interests them only as far as it will affect the total amount eventually payable to 'Iraq under the settle ment mentioned in paragraph 23. [d) A question which arose early in 1930 regarding the treatment of Bahrainis in El-Hasa gave rise to instructions to His Majesty's Minister in May to make general representations on their behalf to the Hejaz Government, if he saw no objection. The execution of these instructions having been delayed for more or less accidental reasons. Sir A. Ryan reconsidered the matter on his return from leave. On February 10, 1931, he reported that in his opinion it would now be preferable to postpone action pending developments in connection with the Hejazi Law on Nationality and the possible general discussion of Persian Gulf Questions. 28. New Trade Route. —Little more was heard in January and February of the proposed new route for pilgrims and trade from the Hasa Coast to the Hejaz (Decem ber Report, Section 8). The matter still appears to be engaging attention, however,8 In the course of general conversation at Mr. Philby's tea party on February 28, Ibn Sa ucl admitted that it was intended to bore for water at Has Tanuran, which has been thought of as a possible site for a future port. His Majesty said that no actual boring had taken place but that he had ordered a start to be made after Ramadhan. 29. Yemen and A sir .—There were still no signs in January and February of any serious repercussion on the relations between the Imam and Ibn Sa'ud as a result of the latter s annexation of Asir. Both sides have been reported to be strehgthening their military forces. In January the Italian Government manifested in London anxiety lest the two parties should come to blows and suggested that they and His Majesty s Government should exert a moderating influence on the Imam and the King respectively. His Majesty's Minister was authorized, if at any time he re ceived categorical information pointing to a danger of conflict, to make such re presentations as he might consider useful. No situation arose up to the end of February which would justify such intervention and on February 28 Sir A. Ryan was directed to take no action. It seems improbable that Ibn Sa'ud, in his present financial straits, would embark on an adventure in the extreme South, though the temptation may ultimately be too strong for him; and there has been nothing to shew that the measures which the Imam has almost certainly taken on his own side of the Asir frontier are more than defensive. i • — . ^. n February 14, the Foreign Office reviewed the position in regard to Asir in an important paper addressed to the Colonial and India Offices. It analysed the legal situation as regards the consequences of Ibn Sa'ud's action on the status of Asir and as regards the Treaty between Great Britain and Asir concluded in 1917. The legal conclusions were doubtful but tended, as regards the Treaty of 1917, to the view that, even if it had not previously ceased to operate for other reasons, it• must now be regarded as having lapsed owing to the apparent extinction i! u 6 £ 1S1 as an i n ^ erna tional person and as not being in its nature an instrument the benefits and obligations of which could be held to have passed to a succession TT^ii/r • 0 ^ er ^ ian d the Foreign Office cited the agreements reached between is Majesty s Government and Italy in the course of the Rome Convention of 1927. The final conclusion from all these considerations was that, in Mr. Henderson's opinion, it would be best, subject to the concurrence of the departments addressed, to instruct His Majesty's Minister at Jedda not to commit His Majesty's Govern ment to recognition of the absorption of Asir into Ibn Sa'ud's dominions or to take im Pty* n 8 Sllc h recognition without further instructions. It was suggest ed that the position regarding the 1917 Treaty should be left intact in view of the possibility that it might usefully be invoked, if a turn of the tide should restore some measure of independence to the Idrisi. HI-—Relations with States outside Arabia. British Empires Si. Courtesies.-—E\s Majesty the King telegraphed congratulations to Ibn ba ud on the occasion of the anniversary of the latter's accession and a suitable reply was returned after an interval just long enough to admit of its having been ruc Wn XT- v, ^ ud himself at Riadh. After correspondence with the Foreign 6' His Majesty s Minister attended various ceremonies on Januarv 8 and 9 notmthstandmg the recent death of the Princess Royal, a bereavement on which' m his father s absence, the Emir Feisal telegraphed condolences both to His Maiestv the King and to the Legation in Jedda. The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London nost- poned his reception m honour of Ibn Sa'ud's accession until after the Court had eone out of mourning. Ihe deferred reception was held at the Hyde Park Hotel on rebruary20. ^ U11 Z2 Consuls at Bombay and Singapore.—The question of the proposed appoint- ment of Hejaz-iNejd Consuls at Bombay and Singapore [December Report, Section discussed between Sir A. Ryan and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on Februarv 6 after it had been decided that the Singapore appointment might be agreed to in principle subject to safeguards roughly similar to those suggested for Bombav Sir A Ryan had been authorized to handle the matter on the lines suggested m his telegram of December 29. He obtained from the Sheikh an admission tW such appomtments must be the subject o£ international agreement. He empha sized the readiness of His Majesty's Government to agree to the appointments ini r' b 9 ^ ^ nec f ssit 3 r fOT safeguards for pilgrims and asked for an rS P i ^ ^ on j uls w . ere appointd, Ibn Sa'ud would be prepared to ^ 0nSllls ^ dommmns. Both points were clearly unpalatable to the Sheikh who promised to submit the matter to the King but did not return to the subject up to the end of February. 33. Money Order Agreement with India. —The Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department intimated to the Hejazi Director General of Posts, etc., by a letter of December 31 their readiness to waive the proposed claim in the Money Order Agreement regarding interest on outstanding balances. Up to the end of Feb ruary, however, the agreement was still unconcluded owing to difficulties of pure form. ^ 34. Hejaz Railway.—On February 6 Sheikh Yusuf Yasin expressed a wish to discuss on some future occasion the question of the Hejaz Railway, which had been in abeyance for a considerable time. He did not return to the subject up to the end of the month. His Majesty's Government are not anxious to pursue this sub ject unless it is forced upon them and Ibn Sa'ud's personal attitude is obscure, as it is not certain how far he really wishes to raise the question or merely allows it to be played with for the edification of Moslems. 35. Ihn Sa'ud's Buying Proposals.—Tha King's request that His Majesty's Government should act as his intermediary for purchases in Great Britain [July- August Report, Section 4 (c)] was carefully considered during and after Sir A. Ryan's visit to England on leave. The conclusions reached were embodied in a Foreign Office despatch of January 15 prescribing the reply to be returned. Ibn Sa'ud was to be informed that His Majesty's Government could not act as buyers on his behalf but they expressed willingness to give advice in connection with particular transactions of importance, as they had done in the case of the Mar-' coni wireless contract (September-November Report, Section 5). Sir A. Ryan was to urge upon the King the desirability of doing business through estabhshed houses. He was given discretion to point out the advantages presented in this respect by Messrs. Gellatly Hankey &amp; Company, an old-established firm with wide connections and to impress on the King the importance of following sound methods, as regards punctual payment, etc., if his Government wished to do business with British firms on favourable terms. Owing to pressure of other affairs, these instructions had not been carried out up to February 28, 36. France. —The negotiations for a Treaty between France and Hejaz-Nejd were resumed when the Hejazi Ministry of Foreign Affairs returned to life at the end of January. Progress appears to have been made but both sides have been reticent. It is partly clear that France will not insist on the slavery article (Decem ber Report, Section 11). The French Consulate hoped to find some way round the difficulty over the Algerians at Medina, which is apparently not disposed of by the new Law on Nationality (paragraph 56). 37. Italy. —The negotiations for a Treaty between Italy and Hejaz-Nejd were also resumed early in the year. Italy also apparently intends to abandon the slavery article. The Italgin Consul spoke to Sir A. Ryan vaguely of obtaining some substitute for it in the form of a declaration by Ibn Sa'ud but gave no indica tion of what exactly he had in view, if anything. Otherwise there has been much reticence about these, as about the French negotiations. 38 Germany .—The German Government apparently decided some little time ago to make Herr de Haas [September -November Report, Section 18 {h)l Consul at Jedda, but he had not up to the time of writing made any communication tq his future foreign colleagues. He is without official experience and may be having difficulties in getting his position clear with the Hejazi Government. There are two versions, one that he wished to present credentials of some sort to the King ; the other that he has applied for and is awaiting an exequateur. Meanwhile he appears to be a somewhat enterprising business man and has been first favourite in the competition for the Government benzine contract, formerly held by Messrs, Gellatly Hankey &amp; Company on behalf of Shell, but not renewed for 1931. E gypt. QQ Pny »prn1 —The Egyptian Consul is understood to have continued his con- veJL'* view toa^ settlement between Heiaz-Nejd and Egypt. A few MC59FD A r10 days after his return to Jedda (December Report, Section 12) the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs denied in an interview given to a Cairo paper that the Consul had been instructed to carry on negotiations although it was admitted that Monsieur' Achmouni had brought back a letter from King Fuad to Ibn-Sa'ud in reply to one from the latter. 40. Aida Incident. —A small incident which might have complicated relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Egypt occurred on February 7-8th. Admiral Tomlin, head of the Egyptian Ports and Lights Administration, had projected a visit to Jedda in the course of a cruise of inspection in the Administration's vessel ' Aida'. He had informed the Egyptian Government and, supposing them to have made the necessary arrangements, arrived in Jedda on February 7th. The Egyptian Government had in fact done nothing, although a belated telegram reached the Egyptian Consul more or less simultaneously with the ' Aida's ' arrival. The Hejazi Government took great offence. On February 8th they addressed oral en quiries to Sir A, Ryan, who, though he had actually heard of the impending visit from Suez on February 6th, naturally disclaimed any concern in the matter. Later in the morning the Egyptian Consul called at the Legation in a state of great aS arran g e d for Admiral Tomlin to call on the Acting Governor of Jedda and had learnt that the latter had been instructed not to return the call. As the matter threatened to be disagreeable and to involve a British Officer in the Egyp- tian Service, His Majesty s Minister offered to use his good offices as a friend of both parties and was able to put the matter in such a way that the Hejazi Govern ment relented. Not only was the Admiral's call properly returned but presents of sheep etc., were sent on board the ' Aida The impression left by the incident was that, although Ibn Sa'ud had mounted his high horse, not without reason, he was pleasd enough to ride out of the affair on a friendly British intervention. 41. Other Powers—There is nothing of importance to record. The Persian Legation remained closed during the two months (December Report, Section 14). The Netherlands Charge d Affaires was absent from Jedda on a tour in the Sudan for two or three weeks and left again on February 26th to visit Aden, Kamaran, the Yemen, and if possible, Hadramaut, between which country and Java there is eaid to be much intercourse.

TdhiciVj tt Route. The question was raised in February whether a renewed effort should be made this year to obtain Ibn Sa'ud's consent to British aircraft flying over the Hasa Coast. (See report for July-August, Section 24.) The Legation was informed towards the end of February that the project of pearling flights between Bahrain and Iracj had been dropped. His Majesty's Government were, however, anxious to secure general facilities for the use of the El-Hasa route by British air-craft, whether military or civil. His Majesty's Minister was given discretion as to how much should be asked for in the first instance and as to how and when the matter should be broached. The objective was, not to recjuest general permission to fly over Nejd territory, but to ensure that any air-craft compelled to •enter or alight therein, should receive general assistance and good treatment; that no objection should be raised to the despatch of assistance by air, if necessary ; and that the pilots should have knowledge of the position of landing grounds between Koweit and Bahrain, of which there should preferably be three to be spaced a,t intervals of about 60 miles and to be chosen, if possible, in consultation with the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. These instructions were issued on Februarv 26th. V.—M ilitary M atters. 46. General. —There is nothing definite to record about military movements- Reference has been made in paragraph 29 to alleged despatches of forces to Asir- The King would appear to have brought back a good many Nejdi fighting men on his return from Biadh to Mecca. Their prowess as dancers has been described in paragraph 9. 47. New Regular Army. —The organization of a regular army in the Hejaz, though very embryonic, has made some progress. The Director of Military Orga nization mentioned in Section 26 of the September-November report gave place shortly after his appointment to another Syrian ex-Turkish Officer, German trained, named Faudhi-al-Kowokji, This officer fought against the French during the Syrian revolt and came to the Hejaz as a refugee. The results of his efforts to create a regular army were seen at a review in Jedda on the King's Accession Day. The march past consisted of two detachments of infantry, about 600 men in all, reasonably workmanlike and disciplined ; pack animals with various equip ment and about 100 men in charge ; two armoured cars ; a disorderly route of less than 40 horsemen posing as ' cavalry ' ; and a much more impressive camel corps of from 300 to 400 men. Although the army is being organized in the Hejaz, most of the men in it appear to be Nejdis. The Bedouin review on February 27th (paragraph 9) began with a small turn out of regular infantrymen. These after performing their European evolutions ; ought and obtained the King's permission to take part in the war-dance. Faudhi Bey seems to be a man of intelligence and initiative. He told Sir A. Ryan in February that he intended to start a school lor N. C. Os. This is probably sensible as trained ex-Turkish Officers are available for present requirements in the higher ranks. It appeared from Faudhi Bey's conversation that the King's ultimate ideal is to have a regular army for the whole of his dominions. VI.—N aval M atters. 48. British. —The Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, arrived in Jeddah on February 13 in H.M.S. ' Lupin/' and stayed three days. The opportunity was taken of discussing with Captain Dicken various matters of naval interest includ ing the following:— (а) Restrictions if any to be placed on searches for arms in Hejazi territorial waters and in dhows of Hejazi nationality outside them. (July- August Report, Section 34.) (б) Possibility of more frequent visits to Jedda and of reviving the practice of visiting other ports. (c; Naval salutes for Hejazi dignitaries. A practically complete measure of personal agreement was reached on these subjects, but, as final decisions have still to be taken at home, any further account of them is deferred owing to considerations of space.12 49. French. —The French sloop ' Baccarat ' visited Jedda from January 6th to 10th. The officers were much in evidence during the festivities in honour of the King's accession. 50. Rear-Admiral Deville, Commander-in-Chief of the French naval division in the Levant, arrived at Jedda from Port Sudan in the naval yacht ' Diana ' on February 18 and left for Suez on February 20. This was the last stage of a lengthy journey by land and sea across Syria and 'Iraq and round from the Persian Gulf. The Admiral was good enough to call privately at the British Legation and expressed much appreciation of the courtesy he had received throughout his journey from British authorities. The ' Diana ' accorded a salute of 13 guns to the Acting Governor of Jedda, to whom it had been decided that H.M.S. ' Lupin ' should not give a salute in view of his subordinate position and the un settled state of the general question. VII.—P ilgrimage. 51. Forged Rupee Notes. —See December Report, Section 19. No definite news reached Jedda in January or February regarding the progress made by the French authorities in Syria. It was suggested towards the end of February that it might be well for the member of the Legation Staff who dealt with the matter last year to address a final letter to the broker in Syria in order to disarm the sus picion that might result from complete silence. This suggestion was referred to His Majesty's Consul-General at Beirut for his views on March 9. 52. Movement of Pilgrims. —A much reduced pilgrimage was still anticipated at the end of February, although the prospect as regards numbers was perhaps a little better than in December. The ' Umm-al-Qura ' of March 13 put the total of arrivals up to date at 20,337. The total number of Dutch East Indian pilgrims, including the last arrivals in March, is about 15,000, not including children, or rather less than half the figure for last year. Pilgraim ships from India brought 1,679 pilgrims up to February 28. On this same date 397 had arrived from Malaya. It is difficult to estimate the probable number of Egyptians, who are for obvious reasons late starters. The Khedivial Mail Steamship Company would appear to have lost the contract for transporting them but the information in Jedda on this subject is meagre. It is stated that the pilgrimage from Algeria has been pro hibited for sanitary reasons, a decision which, if confirmed, will seriously affect the movement from French North Africa as a whole. 53. Control of Nigerian Pilgrims. —Arrangements were made more or less informally in February for the Commissioner at Port Sudan to visit Jedda in order to discuss this question further, with a view to the elaboration of a scheme which might in due course be proposed to the Nigerian Government as an effort to secure their main desiderata without overtaxing the means at the disposal of the Sudan Government and the Legation in Jedda. (December Report, Section 21.) VIII.—S lavery. 54. The number of slaves manumitted by the Legation in January and Februa ry was 3, all of whom were male. One other man, an Abyssinian, took refuge but &gt; relinquished his ^desire for freedom. There is reason to suppose that the local authorities have taken measures to make it more difficult for slaves to obtain access to the Legation, e.g., by prohibiting the movement of negroes in the interior with out permits Information of this kind is difficult to control. A concrete instance of obstruction of another kind occurred on January 17th when the Acting Gov ernor of Jedda, acting under instructions from Mecca, shewed hesitation in giving the necessary paper to enable a freed slave to be embarked for Massowah next dav. The notice given was admittedly short but, in order to discourage the tendency to obstruct, the Legation telegraphed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mecca with the result that orders were given in time for the man to be embarked ac cording to plan ; but only after the Legation had by considerable use of the tele phone tracked the progress of its own telegram through all stages.

On the other hand the sa^ to seek further guidance from His Majesty's Government on various mrtters L' Sr™n ^ n0t taken 6th ' w ^en instructi^s were m»ter| 7 ;^f?r w 6 ' 6 i ° structions reache&lt;i Jedda Sheikh Ynsuf Yasin had inti- mated that the Hejaz Government were anxious to get on with the new law and expressed a wish to discuss the matter unofficially. This led to a conversation on -^e biuary 4th, to which Sir A. Eyan consented rather than run the risk of seein^ an unsatisfactory new law promulgated without previous discussion. It appeared from bheikh Yusuf lasm s explanations that the Hejazi Government proposed to meet the views of His Majesty's Government on two important points, the wording of Article 3, which originally asserted the Hejazi nationality of all persons born in the Hejaz, without right of subsequent option; and the wording of Article A, which m its original form provided that any foreigner 'residing' in the Hejaz who wan not in possession of documents proving his nationality would be deemed a Hejazi as from the date of the law. The Amending Regulation pro mulgated shortly after the above conversation provides more satisfactory texts of those two Articles ; although His Majesty's Government would have pre ferred Article 3 to be given such a form that Hejazi nationality acquired by birth did not take effect until the child had attained his majority, subject then to a right of option ; and the new wording of Article X is not so precise as could be wished. The Hejazi Government could not see their way to accept a sugges tion of His Majesty's Government that the words ' who have in the past ' should be omitted from Article 6 or that in practice the clause containing them should not be applied retrospectively. 58. From a practical point of view the amended law seems unlikely, if it is faithfully applied, to impose any hardship on British subjects and protected per sons. In his converr ation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on February 4th, Sir A. Ryan intimated that he would not consider the acquisition of Hejazi nationality by a child born in the Hejaz of British parents as necessarily precluding the Legation frcm intervening in certain circumstances on behalf of the child and its parents. He had in mind such a case as that of the technically Hejazi minor daughter of a British subject being abducted, in which case it should be possible to intervene at the instance of the injured father. 59. It is important to note that the Law has now been expressly extended to the whole of Ibn Sa'ud's dominions, though without any express mention of Asir. 60. Beacons at Yanho. —Two beacons were swept away by storms in December and January thus increasing the danger of approaching this always difficult port. As it is principally frequented by Khedivial steamers the Legation strongly urged that the beacons thould be restored without delay. This work had not been completed by February 28th but the prospect of its being done was good, helped perhaps by a personal conversation which Mr. Hope Gill had with the Amir of Yanbo on his voyage to Suez at the end of January. The Khedivial Company themselves propounded a scheme for supplying a complete outfit of five or six bea cons at a little over £100 each but the Hejazi authorities found this beyond their means and preferred to undertake the essential work themselves. 61. Approach to Jedda.—Sir A. Ryan had some general conversation with the Emir Faisal, during the latter's formal visit on February 1, about the desir ability of port improvements. The Emir assured him that the whole subject was receiving earnest consideration. Inshallah !14 62. Indian Visitors. —Three members of tlie Round Table Conference an nounced their intention of paying short visits to the Hejaz on their return. Two of them, including Sir Akbar Hydari, abandoned the visits. The third, Nawab Mar Jang, Foreign Minister of the Nizam of Hyderabad, arrived with his family on February 10th and left on February 15th after visiting Mecca and Medina. The Legation had asked for ordinary facilities. The result was that Ibn Sa'ud took complete possession of the Nawab and himself made all arrangements as for a royal guest. 63. Yacht ' Sister Anne —The yacht ' Sister Anne ', having on board the owner, the Hon'ble Mrs. R. Fellowes (a French lady, Decazes) and two other ladies visited Jedda in February. She called at Yanbo on her way north, with the assent of the Hejazi Government intending merely to lie off for the night. In the event the ladies were very hospitably welcomed on shore by the local authori ties. 64. Legation Staff. —Mr. Wikeley returned from sick leave on January 20 after undergoing an operation for appendicitis in Egypt. Mr. Hope Gill went on long leave on January 30. 65', Book on Stamps. —Captain C. C. Lewis of the Legation Staff projects a book on Hejaz-Nejd stamps since 1926. His Majesty's Minister has asked unofficially on his behalf for facilities and permission to dedicate the book to Ibn Sa'ud. Sheikh Yusuf's reaction in February was favourable. 66. Meteorological, —After the middle of January the climate was unusually clement until the end of February, not much hotter than in a really warm English summer, minus the rain, of which there was very little. Owing to Mr. Hope Gill's absence it is proposed to reserve the meteorological record until the May-June report and then, if possible, to give the figures for the first six months of 1931.16 APPENDIX. t J : I , ' Nationality Law. Consolidated text shewing the effect of the Amending Regulation of February 1931 on the Regulation on Hejazi Nationality promulgated on Rabi-al-Awwal, 1345 (September 29 j - Al ' en(lments m the original text are shown in italics.

Article IV.

Article V. Hejaz nationality may be granted by a special royal irada to any Moslem, when' Buch appears to the advantage of the Hejaz. Article VI. A Hejazi cannot adopt foreign nationality, either in the Hejaz or abroad, without proper authorization from the Hejaz Government, which can only be by royal irada. Article VI of the Amending Kegulation adds the further provision that ' Hejazi or Nejdi nationals who renounce their nationality and become naturalized as nationals of a foreign state without permission of the Hejaz-Nejd Government will not be allowed to reside in or return to the Hejaz or Nejd.') Article VII. Hejazis who accept military service under a foreign government without previous authority from the Hejaz Government may lose their Hejaz nationality. Such persons may also be prohibited from returning to or residing in the Hejaz. Article VIII. A woman of alien nationality who marries a Hejazi becomes a Hejazi, and will not lose her Hejaz nationality on termination of the marriage, unless she resides abroad and re-adopts her former nationality^ A Hejazi women who marries an alien reassumes her Hejaz nationality on termination of the marriage. Article IX. When a Hejazi adopts, a foreign nationality, his young (minor ?) children do not assume that nationality while they are resident in the Hejaz. If their residence is in a place other than the territories of the Hejaz or Nejd and the nationality requlation of the country in which their father has been naturalized does not entitle them to adopt that nationality they will remain Hejazis orNejdis smh veguMton m their father has been naturalized entitles them to adopt that nationality they will have the right to revert to Hejazi or Nejdi nationality when they reach the age of 18 if they choose to do. so.- Article X. (Modified throughout). Every p Hejaz or Nejd at the date of the promulgation of the Regulation on nationality of Rabi-al-Awwal U45 shall he deemed Hejazi or Nejdi unless his foreign Article XI. This regulation is to be considered effective as from the date of promulgatioii. Our Viceroy is charged with the application of this law. (Article IX of the Amending Regulation empowers the Viceroy to issue instruc^ to the application of the provisions of both Regulations.

Sir, / H th reference to Sir R. Olive's telegrasi No, no of the 14th May regarding the ill-treatment suffered by Bahreinis in Persia at the hands of the Persian authorities, I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter from the India Office relative to the recommendation contained in paragraph 10 of tile despatch No. 2350 of the 5th May, addressed hy the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India, to the effect that the moment has now come to inform the Persian Government that unless they undertake definitely to release tnoae Bahrein! subjects already conscripted, and to cease at once their further persecutions of Bahreinis in Khuzistan until the question has been finally settled, the special privileges at present enjoyed by Persians|resident in Bahrein, under which they are subject only to the jurisdiction of the Political As en t and not to that of the Bahreini authorities, will be discontinued, and they will be treated in all respects as Bahreini subjects* 2 * Prima facie it appears only reasonable that, if the Persxan Government insist upon treating Bahreini subjects in Persia as Persian subjects, the Sheikh of Bahrein should likewise insist upon treating Persian subjects in Bahrein in the same manner as Bahreini subjects. It is clear, however, that if the course recommended by Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe is adopted, there is a danger that the issue may not remain confined to the treatment of Bahreinis in Persia, and that of Persians in Bahrein. The possibility must be faced that a threat of this nature may move the Persian Government to adopt counter measures by challenging the status quo in the Persian Gulf in otiier ways, e .g. in regard to the present position at Hen jam, the facilities now enjoyed by Imperial Airways on the South Persian air route, or the visits of British warships to Persian ports. There is the further responsibility that thegw Persian Government would protest to the League of Nations / ' regarding the treatment of Persian nationals in Bahrein» and would take the opportunity of asserting once more their claim to sovereignty over these islands* 3» For this reason I consider that the question whether it would he wise to adopt Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe's proposal must largely depend on the degree to #iich it can be held to he likely to have the desired effect.. It is possible that the Persian Government care little for the welfare of Persian residents in Bahrein, and will not he moved to accord Bahreini nationals in Persia more favourable treatment by the knowledge that otherwise their nationals in Bahrein will lose certain privileges which they at present enjoy. In such circumstances the sole results of the action now proposed would presumably be on the one hand that the Persian Government might retaliate against British interests or press more actively their claiaas to sovereignty over Bahrein, and on the other that Bahreinis in Persia would in future be persecuted to a muc|r greater extent than at present* 4, Before deciding whether to instruct you to address the Persian Government in the sense suggested, I shall be glad to learn whether such a threat to the Persian Government, and the actual withdrawal of the privileged position at present enjoyed by Persians in Bahrein, - should it become necessary in the last resort to carry the threat into effect, - is in your opinion likely to result in any improvement of the treatment at present meted out to Bahreitiis in Persia.

[E 4740/455/91] No ., x. Mr. Dodd to the Marquess of Read 18.) (No. 494.) My L WTT n -p + at o ' 9, 1931. oi . i. reference to Mr. Secretary Henderson's despatch No. 472 of the 21st ultimo, I have the honour to report that I am not in favour of adopting the measures of retaliation suggested by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ^ ;n ^ eai ? s . 0 \ coerc ^ n g the Persian Government into modifying their treatment o Bahi emis m Persia, nor even of threatening the Persian Government with such retaliation. In my opinion, such a course is unlikely to achieve the desired result of ameliorating the situation of Bahreinis in Persia. The Persian Government cannot be credited with any such tenderness for their subiects as the contrary supposition implies. I fear that the Persian authorities' zea] fiiight even be whetted in hunting down their victims. '' ll ' proposal to treat Persian subjects in Bahrein as subjects of the sheikh does not appear to me even to be logical. His Majesty's Government and the sheikh have all along maintained that Bahrein is a State'mdependent of and distinct from Persia. Persians are aliens in Bahrein, and I can see no grounds on which they could reasonably be regarded as Bahreinis. It would be logical and consistent to withdraw from Persians the special privileges enjoyed bv them in common with other foreigners. 3. The Political Agent, Bahrein, who has been staying with me for the last three days, has privately informed me that he Avould not regard with equanimity the termination of his jurisdiction over so large an alien colony, since it would have the effect of undermining his influence. On the other hand, the closing of the Persian schools and the interdiction of the Pahlavi cap would be an even sorer offence to Persian amour-fropre, and if any such measure of retaliation be resolved upon, it is this which he, for his private part, would recommend. But I am, speaking personally, unable to approve of inflicting hardships on these Persians for the sins of their Government, of which they are innocent. 4. The attitude of the Persian Government in this question has been, in their own eyes, consistent. For them, Bahrein is part of Persia, and Bahreinis Persian subjects. It follows that when legislation is passed making life more burdensome for Persian subjects, such as, for instance, the conscription law, Bahreinis must shoulder the burden with the rest. When I complained of the persecution of Bahreinis to the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently, he wished me to accept this view. He did not deny that conditions had become more burdensome for Bahreinis; but he argued that his own son had been conscripted. To ask the Persian Government to exempt the Bahreinis is to ask them to abandon their claim in favour of that of His Majesty's Government. It is true that the Minister of Court did undertake to see to it that Bahreinis were not molested. That undertaking was, however, a derogation from the Persian aspect of the status quo, and has since been, in fact, dishonoured. On the other hand, any such measure of retaliation as that suggested to Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe would be an actual and admitted breach of the st on the part of His Majesty's Government. It would be proclaimed as such. This departure would place His Majesty's Government dialectically, if not morally, in a disadvantageous position. It would be taken by the Persian Government as justification for any counter-measures in the Persian Gulf which they chose to take—although I scarcely believe that the Persians' timorous character would allow them to take any very drastic steps. It would, however, assuredly lead the Persian Government to seize the occasion loudly to reassert their claims to the sovereignty over Bahrein. They might even protest again to the League of Nations. 5. But some day the negotiations for a general treaty will presumably be reopened; and an overt breach of the sta by His Majesty's Government now might handicap the British representative from the start. It would be [254 s—7]2 preferable that he should be in a position to make capital out of His Majesty's Government s innocence of such a breach in the face of gross provocation. To me it seems improbable that any useful step can be taken on behalf of the Bahreinis apart from the settlement of the claims to Bahrein sovereignty in principle. This settlement can hardly be achieved save as part of a general treaty settlement; and in this respect, the sooner negotiations for a general treaty can be resumed the better. 6. As mentioned above, I hardly anticipate that the Persian Governmer would counter a move against Persians in Bahrein with a move against British interests elsewhere in the Gulf. But one cannot be sure. And, if British prestige is suffering from the impotence of His Majesty's Government to protect Bahreinis from Persian oppression, the loss of prestige which would ensue from such a humiliation as expulsion from Henjam would have still more violent repercussions. 7. In their present frame of mind, the Persian Government resent what Feroughi calls the exercise of unwarranted pressure. The lesson of the failure hitherto to obtain an extension of Imperial Airways' permission to fly along the Persian coast by a refusal to reopen the Duzdap Railway in default of it should not be forgotten. Such pressure as that recommended by Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe would appear to the Persian Government as unwarranted, and would be resented, and might make them still less sympathetic to the desiderata of His Majesty's Government. 8. Recent legislation requires that agricultural landowners should be Persian subjects. What effect this has had upon Bahreini landowners' loyalties in Khuzistan I am at present unaware, and I am making enquiries. But most, if not all, will, I anticipate, prefer to accept Persian papers and keep their land. If this conjecture proves to be correct, the problem of protecting Bahreinis will have been solved by events for an important part of them. 9. In conclusion, I may add that the Persian Government may be encouraged in their attitude towards Bahreinis in Persia by their general attitude on the question of Persian nationality. This is typified in the provision of the nationality law by which any inhabitant of Persia is a Persian subject unless he can prove to the satisfaction of the Persian Government that he is of foreign nationality. In accepting or rejecting the proof, the decision of the Persian Government is final. I have, &amp;c. (For Charge d'Affaires), L. BAGGALLAY.* ' III 1 • / Confidential . Uo.740-S of 1931. British.

Sir, / I hare the honour to invite a reference to Foreign Office letter lo.B 4740/455/91 of 6th October 1951 to the India Office, a copy of which was forwarded to me under India Office endorsement No .P. ki. 6404/31, and to Mr.Dodd' s despatch 10.494 of 9th September 1931 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, regarding the treat ment of Bahrainis at Mo hammer ah. 2, There would seem to be a misapprehension of the scope of my original proposal in paragraph 2 of Mr^Bodd's despatch. He appears to be under the impression that I proposed that Persians in Bahrain should be regarded as Bahrain subjects. I did not make any such proposal. In paragraph 10 of my despatch Ho,235-S of 5th May 1931, I recommended that the Persian Government 'should be informed that the special privileges at present enjoyed by Persians resident in Bahrain, under which they are subject only to ♦ the . forwarded to Political Agent, Bahrain under P.L. Ho♦747-0 of 10/11/31, for information. &amp;the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and not to that of the Bahrain authorities, will be discontinued, and that they will be treated in all respects as Bahrain subjects. H Possibly it i is th© last sentence ohat led to the misconception^ but as X spoke a little further on 'the abolition of the capitulations' 1 in Bahrain, I think my meaning was sufficiently clear, I neTer intended for one moment that Persians should be regarded as Bahrain subjects, but merely that they should be subject to the Bahrain courts in exactly the same way as British subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Persian courts at the present time. 3, In the next paragraph Mr.Bodd quotes certain private ■ ' . f- remarks made to him by the Political Agent, Bahrain, vthile equally desirous that some measures should be taken in order to protect Bahrainis in Mohammerah, Captain Prior differed some- ' ' ' ' »■ ■ . ' x •• ; ; ; , \ t .. . what as to the methods to be adopted. If I may be allowed to say so, I think it is a little unusual to quote in official I '' ' ■ ' ' , ! . ' ' ; ' ..

The Bahrain Courts however are at least as fair as the Persian Courts, and probably a good deal less venal* I cannot see therefore that any undue hardship would be ■ ■ i , , : , ' , : , ' . : &gt; ! . . j * •., ' ' ' . • / , ' , . f ■ 4 f ' i ' ' i j &gt; 1 .4 ' 1 inflicted on them, and in any case their hardships would be trivial compared with those of the innocent Eahrainis who have ' i been imprisoned and forcibly conscripted to serve in a foreign array* Should no sympathy be given to them ?5» In paragraph 4 of his despatch Mr.Dodd states that the Minister of Court undertook to see that the Bahrainis were not molested and admits that this definite undertaking has : been dishonoured. He states that the undertaking was in the Persian view a derogation from the Persian aspect of the status quo, I confess I am unable to follow this argument. «hen she general agreement regarding the maintenance of the 3 .atus quo was entered into Bahrainis in Mohammerah were not seriously siolest^dj but one of the issues between Eig Majesty* Government and the Persian Government was that of Bahrain, which naturally directly involves the status of Bahrain subjects. Soon afterwards owing to the failure to settle the Bahrain question the persecution of Bahrainis commenced and an undertaking was given by the Minister of Court to His Majesty's Minister that Bahrainis would not be molested, and I submit that this undertaking was given as part of the f . • . : . • . ? general agreement to maintain the status quo, and that the dishonouring of the undertaking was a breach of the status quo# Mr, Dodd contends that the measures of retaliation suggested by me would be an actual and admitted breach of the % status quo on the part of His Majesty's Government, 1 on the other hand consider that the Persians have already deliberate- ly broken the status quo in admittedly dishonouring the undertaking which they entered into and that we are entitled therefore to take measures of retaliation. This view seems to have been shared by Sir Robert Clive in his telegram So. 83 to the Government of India (Ho,110 to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) of 26th May 1931, &gt; v 9, I would submit that in this matter there is a good deal more involved than a mere question of prestige, a word which ..,f s 4 1 \ - 1 ■ ; '. r f / I whicn I personally dislike nowadays. Under the Bahrain Agreements of 22nd December 1880 and of 23rd March 1892 the shaikh oi Bahrain has undertaken on no account to enter in any agreement or correspond with any power other than the British GoTernment, nor without the assent of the British Government to consent to the residence within his territory of the Agent of any other Government. Since therefore the Slrnikh is precluded from corresponding or entering into negotiations with any foreign power it is, I think, incumbent on the British Government to protect his interests and his subjects vis a -vis foreign powers. He has handed over full control of his foreign relations to us and it is therefore for us to protect his rights and those of his subjects, and I submit that Ms subjects are just as much entitled to our protection as are the subjects of a feudatory State in India. \ ' v .' ■ ■ • ; ; ; ■ This view is strengthened tor the fact that in the annex to Chapter XXII (November 1923) of the Consular Regulations a list is given of British-protected States, and among them are shown the 'Principal iJative States of India' and Bahrain', and section 10 states that the provisions of the chapter apply not only to British subjects, ..... but also to persons trho enjoy British protection on other grounds, and reference is given to the annex. It was as a recognition of this obligation that Bahrainis were issued with passports as British protected subjects, and confident in the security of these documents some of them proceeded to Persia in pursuit of their normal avocations, and many of them were engaged in trade and petty commerce in Mohammerah long before the Persians revived their absurd claim to Bahrain. All of a sudden in support of their contentions the Persian authorities come along and ...J I « «»D« ., *&gt;■ and institute a very cruel perseotition of these unhappy individuals. His Majesty's Minister takes up the xaatter with the Minister of Court who gives an undertaking that pending a final settlement of the matter the status quo shall be maintained and these individuals should not be molested# A few months later this undertaking is dis- , honoured, the persecution is intensified and these holders ; - .w , ^ ^ J , ' T , i , ; of British passports are informed that unless they agree to accept Persian nationality they will be put into prison* their British passports are forcibly taken from them, and they are conscripted. 7.

February 29th, 1932. j My dear Biscoe, /P 1 My despatch No, 54 of 29th February about Bahreinis, paragraph 5, This enquiry is prompted by the consideration that the most important thing about the Persian claim to Bahrein is that unless we bribe the Persians to make a formal withdrawal they will continue to harass those Bahreinis who are so unfortunate as to have chosen a home in Persia, Apart from this it doss not seem to matter much whether the Persians withdraw their claim or not. This being so, it is desirable to know how many Bahreinis are really affected in order to obtain a proper prospective. If there are some thousands (which I believe there are not) obviously we must maice a considerable sacrifice for the sake of paying what we may regard as our debt of honour to Bahrein, But if there are only /one Colonel H,V, Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.I33&gt; 1% I BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. one or two (I realise there are not quite so few as that) then it is absurd that we should pay some big price, say a slice of territory in Baluchistan or the formal renunciation of a million pounds of debt, in order to secure the withdrawal of a claim that the Persians have no hope of puluing into practical effect in any future that we can envisage. I am aware that ethically this is not quite sound. In principle one Bahreini is as mush entitled to our care and protection as a thousand, but in practical politics one man rarely counts as much as a thousand. If the number of non-land owning Bjhreinis is verv small, it seems to me worth toying with the idea of arranging in some way or another for their wholesale removal from Persia. I know that this would cost money, but His Majesty Government seem able to produce funds for much less profitable objects. should be interested to 3.earn whether you think the idea wholly fantastic. The land-owning Bahreinis fall into a class of their own. You have already told them, I believe, that they /cannot\1&gt;W y io ^ BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. cannot have it both ways. In this connection I enclose a copy of a letter that I sent to Monypenny In December. I have not yet had his reply, but I should be very glad to have your observations upon the point raised therein. So far as the fatal nord 'prestige' Is concerned, am I right in thinking that (a) the harm has already been done so far as our failure to protect Bahreinis can do it and (b) it is the protection of Bahreinis in fersia that the Bahreinis of Bahrein care about rather than the academic aspect of the question and that if the problem of their fellow -countrymen were solved by their whole sale removal from Persia or any other method they would mind our taking no further steps to secure the withdrawal of the claim?13.S /r&gt; &gt; frK British Legation, Tehran, JL December 28th,1931. My dear Monypenny, Please see Doctor Lincoln^ letter enclosed in Galloway's despatch Ho. 78. It rather looks as if the Persian authorities intend to let the question of the status of Bahrein!s lie dormant for the present. But it is bound to come up again for definite settlement — prohbly in the course of next year. We must assume that this settlement will restilt in Bahreinis being recognised by Persia as foreigners in the full sense of the term : and when that point is reached it seems probable that the Persians will display some energy in making applicable to Bahreinis the terms of the law regarding agricultural land held by foreigners. And then - still dealing in the word 'probable' - these Bahreinis may find themselves hastily selling or even being expropriat ed at alfigure well below the normal market value. Of course, for the present, Bahreinis being Persians in Persian eyes their land is theoretically safe (but perhaps the safety is precarious as in the pas Bahreinis though claimed as Persians have been kicked out of Persia), and it is tempting to let sleeping dogs lie. £ The normal advice to give these people if they really mean that they are absolutely determined not to accept u, Persian nationality would be to sell out ostentatiously ratheii than risk being confronted with an actual or potential forced sale. But I imagine that these folk are hardly equipped to understand such advice ju* that, even if it could be got into their heads, local conditions are such that their endeavours to follow it w uld be likely to make trouble. , , In a/V \1U U .-v r -2- 1 i f In a word. I feel singularly helpless: If you can make an opportunity of disucssing the question with Doctor Lincoln, with an eye especially on the prohahle post-general | 1 treaty situation I shall he very grateful.

Sir, With reference to your despatch ho. 199-3 dated the 1st April 1932 I have the honour to inform you tnat from enquiries made I have obtained the following information regarding Bahrein! residing within this Vice-Consulate jurisdiction: 1) The number of Bahreinis,who do not own agricultural property is approximately 5800 men as below j - (a) Kohammerah 1700 (b) Busbah and suburbs including Abadan 4100. 2) Total number of Bahrainis living within the jurisdiction is approximately; 8100 souls.

Of these the total number of Bahrainis owning agricultural property is relatively insignificant, namely, about-322, Ji rs-v' He estimates the number of men who do not own agricultural property as approximately 5800,viz. Mohammerah 1700, Gusbah and suburbs including Abadan 4100, the balance consists of women and children. Actually, for the moment the treatment of Bahrainis is not an acute question for the simple reason that the Persians are not at present carrying on conscription opera tions in liohammerah, and it is to conscription that the Bahrainis chiefly object, Lincoln tells me, however, that directly the Persians recommence conscription at liohammerah the issue will again become an acute one. How, as you will see, the number of Bahrainis settled in Mohammerah is considerable and does run into several thousands. In these circumstances I am ifraid the idea of arranging for their wholesale removal from Persia is hardly feasible. Firstly, it would involve a very large expenditure. secondly, it would, I think, raise a very acute issue at Bahrain, and lead probably to a violent anti-Persian f ♦ ♦ H. Hoare, Esq. .C.M.G., ' s Minister,I ty'Mr ' ' . If \ i /r?) ■m 9 m f anti-Persian agitation there. The Bahrain view naturally is that their subjects have a perfect right to pursue their normal avocations in Persia in exactly the same way as a very large Persian colony pursue their normal avocations in Bahrain, They would consider that if Bahrainis are turned out of Persia they have every right to turn the Persians out of Bahrain, and though they would probably not do this, feelings would, I think, become very embittered# On the other hand, as I pointed out, the only acute issue really is conscription. There are many other pinpricks but these I do not think we can resist# # Forcible conscription, however, is a very definite issue, and if we could arrive at some modus vivendi with the Persians, by which in practice Bahrainis should not be forced to serve in their army, then, I think, the question can be regarded as settled# As regards the last paragraph of your letter I do not think that it can be said that the harm has already been ^ done so far as our failure to protect Bahrainis can do it# \ When the conscription issue is revived the question will again become acute and we shall give a further example of our inability or unwillingness to protect Bahraini interests. On the other hand, your view that the Bahrainis at Bahrain only care about the practical aspect of the matter and are entirely indifferent to the academic aspect is absolutely correct# I do not think any Bahraini cares two straws about the Persian claim to Bahrain# It causes them no practical inconvenience since, while many Persians wish to go to ahrain, very few Bahrainis have the smallest desire to come to Persia. Further, my own personal view, which I give for what it may be worth, is that Arab opinion regarding us nowadays is that we are a great deal weaker than we were formerly and that we are either powerless #••powerless or unwilling to help our friends. On the other hand they believe that where our own interests are directly threatened we must male e a stand and know that in the last resort we are strong enough to resist the Persian claim to Bahrain. It is obvious to the meanest intelligence that it is in our interests to resist this claim and every Arab thinks that we are certain to do so, and therefore there is not the least need to take it seriously# I am therefore not in favour of making the scaliest concession to the Persians for the abandonment of their claim to Bahrain, which from the Gulf point of view causes us no practical inconvenience at all* On the other hand it is desirable in the interests of our prestige among the Arabs and general reputation for fair dealing to try and do something to protect the subjects of a small State, for the control of whose foreign affairs we are definitely responsible, and I would therefore urge that, if in any way feasible, we should take up with the Persians the one clear and definite issue of conscription.i /iM '■M /i7 No. 322-a of 1932.

This would be thoroughly bad from every point of view and might drive us to appeal to League.

It appears to me that there is no escape from one or other horn of this dilemma and I believe Minister of Court has sufficient intellectual horn sty to realise fctei that it provides convincing argument to meet criticisms which he appears to fear regarding Unjustifiable surrender of Persian rights. Only objection I can see is that lie will perhaps go back on his qualified agreement that we shall have facilities at Hen jam. However, this danger will con- tinue to exist until Treaty is definitely settled and it cannot be helped* We can make it more difficult for him to be obstructive in respect of Henjam if we spontaneously offer docking facilities (see Government of India tele- gram to Secretary of State for India# Ho. 1111) with further offer to provide for dock on favourable terms whenever the Persian government wish to order one.

Bahrainis are conscripted because the Persian Government choose to regard them as Persian subjects, and if the Persians refrain from conscripting tinea they weaken their case. As far as I remember you agreed with thtse views, which are also generally those of His Majesty's Government, 4. I think in reply to His Excellency's complaint there fore you had better explain to him, verbally at the present stage, how the matter stands. That while I fully sympathise with the hardships his subjects have to undergo in Persia, and with his feelings on the subject, I do not think that such reprisals as are possible against Persians in Bahrain, will bring about the end which His Excellency has in views the better treatment of Bahrainis in Persia. You had better quote me, and not His Majesty's Government, as I do not think His Excellency has ever been informed of the latter's views. You might further inform His Excellency that I hope to discuss this matter with him when I visit Bahrain next month. 5. There is, however, another aspect of His Excellency's proposals. ^uite apart from the question of reprisals, prima facie it might well be desirable for more control to be exer cised over the Bahraini Persian community, who are troublesome at times, than is done at present. If, for instance, the Persian ....3 Persian solaools in Bahrain are, as stated by His Excellency, hot-beds of anti-Bahrain propaganda, then some control would seem to be advisable. His Sxoellency* s proposals are four in number. (1) Persians would no longer be appointed or elected on public bodies. (2) Their schools, if allowed to continue, would be subject to inspection and the control of the Depart ment of Education* (3) The wearing of Pehlevi hats would be disencouraged. (4) Perhaps measures would be taken to prevent the permanent alienation of property into the hands of Persians. From the aspect indicated in this paragraph please let me have your views on each of these proposals, purely from the point of view of the expediency of putting them into practice. If you / are in favour of (l), (2) and (4) for example, kindly let me have details as to how the State proposes to carry them out. I have the honour to be.

Dated 6tii ( received 7tJi ) May 1933. Minister for foreign Affairs states that according to information received from (iovernor of Gulf Ports (1) Government of Ba&amp;rain iiave publisiied notice calling on Persian subjects to register at Political Agency and stating tnat those who do not comply will be treated like all otner foreign subjects. (2) Government of Bahrain were dismissing all Persians employed by Oil Company at Banrain. I presume tnat (1' is of old standing and applicable to all foreigners over whom Political Agent has juri sdiction. As regards (2) I should propose to reply tnat Oil Company is American and tnat any way if Government of Bahrain are pressing it to dismiss foreigners they are only copying the Persian Government tnemselves in their dealings with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.

I would venture to draw attention to two points in connection with the reply wmch His Majesty's Minister proposes to jaajce to the axxegation mat the Government ox Bahrain were dismissing Persians in the employ the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited.

The facts are! (i) On the S7th %hruary 19S9 the Government of Bahrain issued an 'Alan (Pro clan at i on) ordaining that persons hows in Bahrain of foreign parents would, unless registered in the Agency, he considered for all purposes as subjects of the Bahrain 'itate . On the 30th March 1933 the Bahrain jSovernment reissued their 'Alan of the 27th February 19S9.

He apparently held the opinion that the Officer holding his appointment should visit the Persian Gulf, though it had not been done before,3» 6, The question of foreign Consular representation has assumed a new importance witli the development or an American (in fact,if not in theory) Oil Field in Bahrain® At present our local relations with the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited are friendly; they recognise our special position and,so lar as I am aware,are content to come to the Political Agent I ot Justice,legal formalities and so on® But this may not always 'be so and,with a growth in size and influence ol the Company, ^ may come a change of attitude;and it is always possible,though I have no reason to think so at present,that we may in the future' have difficulties with them in defence of the rights of the Bahrain Government or in other ways• It must be remembered that | American interests have just secured the Hasa Concession and so may develop into a very powerful influence in the Persian Gulf, ?, I have recently been asiced to do a number of what may De termed Consular acts hy various members of the American Community: the oath of allegiance required under the new passport regulations of the United States of America has 'been administered to persons requiring to renew their passports: certain visas on passports have been given: certain formalities required by the United States of America Customs Department have been effected: documents have 'been attested: a marriage 'between two Citizens of the united States of America was registered by my predecessor. The fees appropriate to the various matters have been paid. In one or two cases the authorities of the United States of America themselves suggested •so their nationals that 'legalization' by the Political Agent would be acceptable. 8. I shall naturally do my best to ensure that no difficulties occur,which may give rise among the American Community to a wish to have their own Consul on the spot, (4)the work, 'but with a rapidly growing Cocimmiity^nd. the possibility of difficulties,will increase• y• The time must inevitably come when difficulties will arise. Indeed,a difficulty threatened only a few weeks ago, when there was a possibility (I am told that the betting was at one time 6 to 4 onI) of another marriage taking place. In tne case of the marriage mentioned above one of tne parties was a missionary of the American Mission,and both were content to be married by a Minister of the Dutch Reformed Church• I am not sure that the other couple would have been so content. Immediately would have arisen the question:- 'You have not the authority to carry out an ordinary every day act like marriage; yet you have a Treaty under which you say that we cannot have our Consul here to do these acta; what is to be done about it?' 10. Apart from any question of Treaty riguts,it would be most undesirable to have a Consul of the United States of .America in Bahrain,as with the Oil interests at his back,he would be liicely rapidly to acquire a powerful position - indeed, he might well tend to supplant the Political Agent. Moreover^ if any one country were to be permitted to establish a Consulate, it would be difficult to refuse the same privilege to others - especially to Persia (though this would mean the disappearence of her claims to sovereignty) and to Sa'udi Arabia. I have reason to believe, more over,that the Bahrain Government would view with anxiety the possibility of the establishment of any foreign Consul in Bahrain. 11. The immediate question is what attitude the Political Agent is to adopt,if and when the .American Consul at Baghdad repeats his visit to Bahrain (as he may well do in the coming cold weather),and if he shows signs of Consular activity or asks, whether there is any objection to his,for example,issuing a (S)(6) I 61 5. passport $ or solemnizing a marriage, Seitner of these acts can toe performed by the Political Agent for a Citizen of the united States of America, 12, I do not know,and should 'be grateful if X might he informed,whether our agreements with Bahrain,or our special position in the Persian Gulf,have ever been brought formally (or informally) to the notice of the Government of the united States of America., 13. If so,the Consul might himself refrain from attempt ing to carry on Consular work,or if he were to attempt to do so,might be asked to desist in virtue of our Agreements with the Ruler of Banrain,which had been communicated to his Government, 14, If the position has not been communicated to the Government of the United States of America,I think that on the first occasion,it might be sufficient (if the Consul were to show signs of activity) for the Political Agent to draw the Consul's attention to the Exclusive Agreement of 1892, Then,if the question were to arise of the Consul performing on the spot some specific act,which was not within the powers of the Political Agent,the Political Agent might say tnat,as a matter of courtesy,he wouia raise no objection on that particular occasion provided that the request for the act was made by tlie person concerned to the Consul through him (the Political Agent), The Political Agent might add,if it were to appear necessary to do so,that the question of future procedure would be referred to His Majesty's Government. 15. It would be idle,at the present stage,to attempt to forecast the circumstsnces which may then arise and to recommend any line of action,but it may not be out of place to suggest that we should be guided by the following general principles (a) that the appointment or a Consul for tiie United States of America, would not be acceptable,6. (la) that to make the Political Agent also Consul for the United Sta-tes of America would he unsuitable and might give rise to embarrassing complications, but (c) that tiie Government of the United States of America might be asked to empower the Political Agent to do on their behalf such acts of a Consular nature as might appear to be necessary to the welfare of the American Community in Bahrain, I have the honour to be Sir* Your most obedient servant, f Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent,Bahrain,Confidential No: C/244 Political Agency, To The . in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Mr. Mallet has now received from Bahrein a reply to his enquiries on the subject from which it appears that these proclamations were originally issued on February 27th, 1929 (Ssfand 8th, 1307) and that they were merely republished on March 30th, 1933 (Farvardine 10th, 1312).

Thie registration differs from that of British subjects and British protected per Ron s ( in its true sense) perforwed under the Bahrain Order in Council. The Idea underlying the Proclamation of the Bahrain Oovernnent was that the children horn of foreigners residing in Bahrain are, at any rat# while in Bahrain. Bahrain subjects for all tmrposes, 'but it was recognised that as the Bbalkh had handed juris diction over foreigners to the British Government (i.e. the Agency Courts) and also as there ralftit he cases In which individuals might prefer to remain tinder the jurisdiction of the Agency Courts, it was necessary to avoid making the ^Voclamatlon definitely compulsory.&gt;1 ' /. .■ ]%{&amp;. i V^- ' \ -S- / 3* A few ( I quote fro» »amory, per- liaps a dozen or so) people have 'reprtstor ed' themselves. But registration in this natter has a too legal tang. In practice they are simply noted in a hook ( so that the Bahrain Government and the Agency Courts know, which authority in to deal with then) as being foreigners, who, though 'bom in Bahrain, wish to remain under the jurisdiction of the Agency Court. 4. ^he real virtue of the '?roclaraation is that the children of Persians (#10 are r the chief foreign community residing peimanently in Bahrain) become subject to the jurisdiction of the Boh rain Courts, for thev do not register in the Agency, and so in the process of tlrae the British protected Persian ( mho is a perfect nuisance and a fruitful source of petty litigation in the .Agency Court) will by a natural process cease to exist. v 5, I would suggest that the matter should, if possible, be allowed to lie quiet.&lt; CoDy.

I wonder if, at the sane time, it will he possible for vou to find out what is to he done in the mtter of calling at Bahrain, in the event of the Awe rlean Minister staying with Skinner or the Mission. He is, of course. In Bahrain purely a private person, and it would he better frow the local point of view if he called first, but I should like to know whether Oovemnent consider that the Political Agent should, in view of his standing, show hlw the courtesy of a first call. If he comes to stay with we, the matter will solve itself and I would, of course.

Dear Gastrell, I return the letter from the Resident to Laithwaite, I have no suggestions to add and I agree that it would be best to leave the matter as it is at present. 2. The Bahrain Government regards all persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents as being subjects of Bahrain unless they are regis tered at the Agency. In this resreot we define a 'foreigner' as a person not born in Bahrain or a person born in Bahrain but registered at the Agency as a foreigner. This regulation of ours is weak in one noint, we have made no Drovision for minors. I think it would be un desirable to issue another proclamation on the subject at present but if you approve I will send out a circular to all departments stating that minors will be assumed to belong to the nationality of their father until of age. 3. Sooner or later there must occur a test case on the subject, already we have dealt with several young Persians born in Bahrain in our Courts but there has been no complaint at the same time I feel sure that sooner or later there will be a complaint. HUM aa 19sThe regulation has been in force for several years and has been running smoothly. Apparently the . ersian Government only became aware of it when the Alaan was renewed.
