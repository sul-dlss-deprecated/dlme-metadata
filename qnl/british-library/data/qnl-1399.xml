From, THE POLITICAL SUPERINTENDENT, FPtONTIEU UPPER SINB. To, THE COMMISSIONER IN SIN'D. Jacobabad, 31^ Decemhcr 1SG9. Sir, I have the honor to forward Captain Harrison s report No. 57, dated 28th instant, giving the information called for in your letter No. 825, dated loth idem. 2. It will be seen that Captain Harrison states the Mercenary Brigade to be as under, viz :— 3. On receiving the above, I had a conversation with Captain Harrison and His Highness' Vakeel upon the subject of numbers and cost, and reminded the Vakeel that my having previously stated the strength of the Mercenary Brigade to be about 2,000 men, was not put forward on the exclusive report of the Sirdars ; but that in presence of the Sirdars themselves, he (the Vakeel) had admitted the strength and cost then given to be correct. 4. Having explained this, I was informed that Captain Harrison had not included the Khan's ' Umla/' a body of Household Cavalry, composed of Putans and Belooch mounted on the Khan's horses. I could not ascertain the exact numbers of this body from Mahomed Khan on the present occasion. 5. Thus it appears that the information given by the Sirdars was substan tially correct. Indeed, we have yet to learn whether it was understated or not. 6. 'With regard to the diameter of their Troops, the information which Cap tain Harrison himself gives in his 4th para, shows, that out of the 800 men of which the body was composed at the time referred to (l861-6.&gt;), 600 supported the usurper Sliere Dil, and only 200 remained faithful to their master, the present Khan (Khodadad), thus proving how completely the Khan, whoever he may be, is in their power. Hegular Cavalry . ... Artillery Body Guard Infantry Regiment of Infantry 200 78 400 800 Total 1,478I ( 89 ) 7. In fact, not long afterwards, the leader of the body killed Shere Dil Limself, which, combined with Sir Henry Green's strongly expressed opinion of them, seems to decide the question of character as a whole. 8. Captain Harrison however speaks well of a ' great number of the Body Guard,' r and states that ' the Cavalry'' are for the ShengtuofLodv Giunl... 400 mog ^ p ar ^ Hindustanis and Seikhs, who were 'well Cavalry ... ... 200 l behaved and respected.' Nothing however is said of the character of the ' Fighting Regiment,' who do the detached duty in the country. My own experience of these Troops verifies Sir Henry Green's, so far as it has gone. T allude to what occurred last spring during the negotiations with the Murrees, when I had occasion to request His Highness' Vakeel to write to the ' Captain' Commanding at Bagh, to request him to be so good as to restore the arms and mares treacherously taken from the Murrees, and that proper compensation would be given for them at once. The insolent and insubordinate' reply which the Vakeel received was, ' that when Us. 300 were paid down in ' ready money, the arms, &amp;c. would be given up— not before. ' I threatened to write to the Khan reporting this ' Captain,' but refrained from doing so at the earnest solicitation of the Vakeel, who said that it would ruin him (the Vakeel) for having shown me the man's letter. Thus I indirectly obtained evidence of the character of one Commander of a body of men, whose character throughout the country has been already described ; and when the time comes for enquiry, we shall know to whom the Murree Chiefs refer, as inviting and aiding plundering parties in Eastern Cutchee. 10. Captain Harrison states that during the time he was at Kelat cc only te one or two people complained that the Sepoys had pilfered their fruit.' 11. It seems strange that even ' one or two' complaints reached Captain Harrison, because as a rale, none would either be made to, or received by him against any of the Khan's servants at the Capital; the Khan himselt being present—particularly too, after the orders issued in your letter No. 20(5, dated 1st May 1868, which positively prohibited his receiving any complaints what ever, except through the Khan himself, 12. For the same reason I do not consider that either he or I are in a posi tion at present to offer a reliable opinion as to what Sirdars and tribes are really friendly to the Khan as a Despotic lluler, in contravention of the organisation of the Khanate as a Military Confederacy, and what not;—but 1 am quite clear as to which of these forms of Government is best suited to British interests ; and from what I know of the feeling of the country which 1 have watched( »0 ) quite independently during the revolutionary eri&amp;is of the last 18 montlis, I think it would be very dangerous for us to reason ourselves into the belief that the present calm is that of contentment, or that a Despotism of Khanazads will ever govern Belooch and Brahooes in the proper sense of the term. 13. Captain Harrison, in the Gth para, of his letter under reply, when advocating the continuance of the present strength of the Mercenary Brigade, states that ' the disaffected considered themselves strong enough to cope with ' the said force on several occasions.' 14 Bearing in mind Sir Henry Green's experience in the Murree tribes, I believe that ' the disaffected'' knew perfectly well what they were about, and that in an actual melee they would have received support against the Merce naries, otherwise the 3,000 under the Jam at Kelat in May last would never have ventured to entreat Captain Harrison to remain neutral, and leave them to fight out their quarrel against the more than double numbers on the side of the Khan. 15. In conclusion, I beg to quote for your information paras. 13 to 17 of a report No. 482, dated 14th December 1860, from Captain Sandeman to the Commissioner of the Derajat Division, from which it will be seen that Kelat affairs are viewed by Punjaub Officers in the same popular light in which I have endeavoured to lay them before the Government for consideration. '13. There is no doubt of the fact that Extract above referred to. the Khanate of Kelat is in a state of anarchy, and it behoves our Government fairly to enquire into the cause. I have en deavoured to descover it, and I will now place before Captain Saudeman s report. • you the result of my enquiries.' tc li. It is asserted that the Treaty our Government made with the State of Kelat was entered into with the Khan and his Nobles, i. e. the Brahooe Confederacy ; but that this was merely in theory, for in practice we failed to carry it out in accordance with the constitution of the Kelat State.' &lt;c 15. For instance, I understand that such Nobles as those of Sarawan and Jhalawan declare that in our arrangement for the reduction of the fees taken on Kafilas, the incomes of the Chiefs were reduced, while no arrange ments were come to for the subsidy being distributed according to the loss each had sustained by such reduction. They further declare that the money thus granted, so far from being employed for the benefit of the Khanate, is spent by the Khan on Mercenary Troops, who are a standing menace to them, this being contrary to the constitution of the State. They affirm that these and other like causes have driven them into rebellion.^( 91 ) ' 16. With the above state of affairs before us, it is obvious that our pre sent policy lias not succeeded, and that however much we may desire to act solely with the Khan, treating him as a Despot, the constitution of the State does not admit of our doing so. I will now proceed to show how our doing so is not a safe-policy, and that it has already shook our present successful arrange ments with the Murrees to the foundation.' '17. I have already mentioned the defeat of the first Noble of the State, Moolla Mahomed of Sarawan, and his brother confederate. Since then he has made several attempts to renew the war, but from various causes, has desisted, lie is described as a-Chief of excellent disposition, and to have great influence in the Khanate. Since commencing this report, I have heard that he has left Seebee and joined the Bejuranee Murrees, who reside near the Bolan pass. What will be the result, the future will determine. Were he an evil disposed man, from his well known influence over this tribe the results would certainly be very serious. His being a well disposed amiable Chief of high position in the Khanate, renders it all the more essential that his case should be enquired into. It is surely time for our Government to interfere, when we find that the Khan of Kelat's mismanagement of his Khanate has led to the peace and administration of that part of the Punjab border being placed in much jeopardy, for such is truly the case/' I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. PIIAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier. Me mo : hy the Commissioner in Sind, The first part of this letter only reiterates Colonel Phayre's views on the Kelat Government question, formed after an experience of 18 months at Jacobabad. Heferring to the latter part of this letter, quoting from Captain Sande- man's report, I would observe that that Officer residing at a distance from Kelat, and hearing only casually of its politics, has greater difficulties in form ing a correct opinion than those who have been intimately concerned in the(92 ) events connected with that country for many years past. The jeopardy he alludes to, proceeds from the lawless acts of the Murrees and Boogtees, which have been in play for fully half a century; to ascribe it solel}'' to the present administration, is not correct therefore. The question of successfully con trolling and managing hereditary cattle-lifters is no easy one, and has puzzled more powerful Governments than that of Kelafc. His Highness the Khan has however done his best to remedy this evil, and is prepared to con tinue his eftbrts on a good plan being shown to him. W. L.
