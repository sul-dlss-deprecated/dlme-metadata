Behind them a lone donkey is tethered.Although the clarity of the image is seriously compromised by fading, there appears to be a telegraph mast or flag pole along the right edge of the left-hand image, extending across to the right-hand image.Some distant figures and a boat are visible along the shoreline.InscriptionsLower right, in pencil, alongside image: ‘86’Below image: ‘Panorama of British Residency and Sea front. 23.
