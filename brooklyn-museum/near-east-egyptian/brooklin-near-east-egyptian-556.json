Palaces, estates, and temples employed dozens of craftsmen to fashion luxury and ritual wares. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPotters used two principal materials: alluvial silt (soil deposited by the floodwaters of the Nile) and soft desert shale called marl. Silt contains iron oxides and fires red; marl, rich in calcium carbonate, fires to a buff color. To make both clays more workable, potters added straw, crushed stone, or pulverized pottery. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPotters constructed vessels by hand or on a wheel. Hand building involved shaping the clay manually and with simple tools. To create vessels on a wheel, artisans rotated the clay rapidly on a low, flat turntable and let centrifugal force pull it into shape. Spiral marks, evident on several examples in this case, indicate wheel manufacture.", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-04-12", "date_added": "2016-04-12 20:12:55", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "09.889.842", "object_id": 3284}, {"accession_number": "07.447.444", "object_id": 4210}, {"accession_number": "07.447.448", "object_id": 4212}, {"accession_number": "07.447.449", "object_id": 4213}, {"accession_number": "07.447.470", "object_id": 4218}, {"accession_number": "07.447.473", "object_id": 4219}, {"accession_number": "07.447.474", "object_id": 4220}, {"accession_number": "07.447.475", "object_id": 4221}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "37.347E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "id": 156357, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/37.347E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/37.347E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 77, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 154, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 308, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 617, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1235, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/37.347E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "unedited master file", "caption": " <em>Storage Jar</em>, ca. 1426-1390 B.C.E.
