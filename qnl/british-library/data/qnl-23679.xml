The Rules and Orders of the Grovernor-Gexieral in Council regulating the conduct of public servants in respect of borrowing monej, receipt of complimentary addresses and other matters are contained in the enactments printed as an appendix to the following rules and in a number of Despatches, Circulars and Resolutions issued at various times. The form of the orders has thus become obscure and confusing and the Government of India have thought it desirable to reproduce their substance in the shape of a compact set of rules which are now issued for the guidance of Government servants. 1. In these rules,— {a) ' Government servant' includes every person holding or exercising any civil office, T , , .. other than a menial office, under the interpretation. ^ ' Government; {b) 'Native of India ^ means a person of unmixed Asiatic descent permanently resident in India. 2.

Any Government servant may accept a complimentary present of flowers or fruit or similar articles of trifling value. The practice of giving such presents should however be discouraged. When a gift of substantial value cannot be refused without giving offence, it should, unless the Government of India by special order otherwise direct, be delivered up to the Government. 3. A Government servant may not, without the previous sanction of the local Grovern- [ Home Depart ment, receive any complimentarv or valedictory mellt ( Public ) Resolu- Public demonstrations in honour of Government ^ i • i ' ^ j. i j , • tionuo. 29—1629-45, servants. address, accept any testimonial presented to him, dated the 22nd j ul ; or attend any public meeting or entertainment 1887; Home Depart- held in his honour; nor may he take part in any similar acknowledgment of the services ment l^eaolution no, of any other Government servant, or of any person who has recently quitted the service of d ated'thu eth^May Government. 1898 ; Home Depart- The rule admits of the following exceptions ^^ted the («) The Head of any Government or Administration may receive an address. 8th August 1910.] [(j) At the request of any public body a Government servant may sit for a portrait, bust or statue not intended for presentation to him.

If a person not expecting to be in office obtains a gratification by deceiving others into a belief that he is about to bo in office, and that he will then serve them, e may be guilty of cheating, but he is not guilty of the offence defined in this section. 'Gratification.' The word 'gratification' is not restricted to pecuniary gratifications or to gratifica tions estimable in money. 'Legal remuneration.' The words 'legal remuneration' are not restricted to remuneration which a public servant can lawfully demand, but include all remuneration which he is permitted by the Government which he serves, to accept. &lt;c A motive or reward for doing/' _ A person who receives a gratification as a motive for doing what he does not intend to do or as a reward for doing what he has not done, comes within these words.

A has committed the offence defined in this section. (S) A, holding the office of Resident at the Court of a subsidiary Power, accepts a lakh of rupees from the Minister of that Power. It does not appear that A accepted this sum as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any particular official act or for rendering or attempting to render any particular service to that Power with the British Government. But it does appear that A accepted the sum as a motive or reward for generally showing favour in the exercise of his official functions to that Power. A has committed the offence defined in this section.

A has obtained a valuable thing from Z without adequate consideration. (6) A, a Judge, buys of Z, who has a cause pending in A's Court, Government promissory notes at a discount, when they are selling in the market at a premium.

The Government of India however consider it undesirable and impracticable to define by rule the precise limits within wlrch criticism of Government by a Government servant who also owes allegiance to some public body for which he is a member should be permitted, and the}^ are in agreement with the view of the Punjab Government that Government servants who are on deputation or on foreign service or who are members of local bodies should not be precluded from giving expression to views which are at variance with those stated by Government, when a proposal of Government relating to a local body or other authority whom a public servant represents is under discussion. But his observations should be confined to the manner in which the proposal of Government will affect the interests of the local body or authority, and to sugges tions for alternative proposals where it is proposed to move Government to re consider its orders and should not include general criticisms of the policy of Gov ernment. His criticisms should be directly relevant to the interests of the body or authority whom he represents, and should be moderately worded. When the orders of Government are final his part in the discussion should be confined to anexplanation of the extent to which they affect the interests of the local body or other authority.
