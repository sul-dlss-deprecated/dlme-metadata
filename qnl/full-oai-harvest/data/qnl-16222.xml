At present, Mirza Naeem is advancing against Lingah with a Persian force.The letter explains that the Resident has withheld a demand for the withdrawal of these troops, as the Resident thinks it will illustrate the vulnerability of Persia's ports on the Persian Gulf if British oversight and control was removed. It notes that this may induce the Ameer-i-Nizam [Amir-i-Nizam] to grant concessions to the British in exchange for restraining Shaikh Sultan ben Suggur.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023667520.0x00000a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
