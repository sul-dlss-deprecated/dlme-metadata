Vy^il The following incident reported by the Residency Agant, Sharjah, may interest you. Two raiders of the Awamir tribe recently went off with some booty from the territory of the Shaikh of Hamriyah, who pursued and caught them up. One of the raiders agreed to give up his share of the booty. The other, stouter-hearted, made the sporting suggestion that the Shaikh should let him away on his she-camel as far as he, the Shaikh,could see, and then pursue him. If the Shaikh was successful in overtaking him, then his share of the booty would be returned, otherwise he would keep it. The Shaikh agreed, .gave the raider the start agreed upon, rode after him, overtook, fired on, and wounded him so severely that the latest news was that he was on the point ox death. 2. The whole affair reminds one of one of the old Scotch, or North Country, ballads, and probably will form a Trucial Coast ballad: the Arabs are very good at that sort of thing. 3. Incidentally it shows that in spite, of an air route, air facilities, and the general opening up of the Trucia- Coast, the folk there are still quite ’primitive’, and have • their own waySjpeculiar perhaps in our eyes but quite satisfactory in theirs, of settling their own affairs.

I visited Sharjah, A1 Ajman and Debai in ,, SH0DI3HAIf ,, between 30th August and 1st September, exchanpin^ calls with the 'Residency Vrent and the Shailchs of these places. 3?he revival of a blood feud dating back to about 1920 was threatening to develop into a War between Sharjah and A1 Ajman, three subjects of the latter Sheikh dom having recently fired at ( but missed ) Shaikh T *achMum, ^ the father-in-law of the Shaikh of Sharjah whilst being received by him at h : s house, after which they rode off. The Shaikh of Sharjah who complained said that Ajman had threatened him and had many Bedouin allies whilst the latter informed me that he himself had given the order to fire and whatever happened intended to attack Shaikh Bachmum and knew that it meant war between Ajman and Sharjah. As there were a number of British subjects in both Sheikhdoms and the Imperial Airways Aerodrome and Best House was at Sharjah it seemed something had to be done about the matter. After lengthy and protracted interviews and the consumption of considerable quantities of sherbet and coffee and sweet meats combined with a little forceful persuasion a meeting of the two ruling Shaikhs was arranged at irihich they rubbed noses and over clasped hands and in the name of Allah made a solemn declaration that no further quarrelling would take place for a period of 4 months during which time negotiations would be entered into with a view to concluding a formal and peimanent peace.

The Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah is furious that Sharjah is now to get the Imperial Airways Concession, although originally I understand he appeared indifferent as to whether Ras al Khaimah was chosen or not. He complains that his land was the first to be selected and that he has been very badly treated. He realises now of course that whichever territory is chosen, the fact of establishing an Aerodrome there, will in time bring in much grist to the mill, such as B.I. boats calling there, extra employment, etc. It is primarily a case of sour grapes and he accused the Sheikh of Sharjah of M selling his country to uhe British'. 1932. 9.

The cousin of Sheikh Sultan bin Salim came on board to call on me accompanied by 3 notables. I asked him why the Sheikh himself had not come on board and he said he was busy. On being pressed, one of his entourage informed me that the Sheikh was a. ”little angry” with the British Government for the following reasons:- (i) Because a Petrol Barge was brought to Ras al Khaimah without his permission. (ii) Because two years ago a Sloop had ’imprisoned’ four or five hundred of his subjects while they were engaged in pearling on the Banks. 18. I directed the Sheikh's cousin to tell the Sheikh he was adopting a very foolish attitude.

A( Sir, y ^ | With reference to your endorsement NC.F-66-N/31 dated the 25th May 1931 paragraph 2, I have the honour to report as follows cn the circumstances cf the murder cf Shaikh Ahdur Bahman hin Saif cf Hamriyah. The murdered Shaikh had an elder brother called Abdullah who, cn his death, left three small sons one cf whom, the murderer, was called Saif, these children were brought up in the house cf Abdur Bahman. Some time after, the mother cf the three boys had a quarrel with the wife of Abdur Bahman and left for Shragah but the children remained cn for some years in the house cf Abdur Bahman. When the boys grew up they demanded their father’s property which, they said, amounted to ks 10,000,. Abdur Bahman at first denied the existence cf any such property but later premised to give the boys some money when some pearls which he had sent to Bombay were sold. About this time Saif and his brothers were engaged in a pewrling venture which did not turn cut a success and ended in leaving them in much reduced2 jr m circumstances. It is evident from subsequent happenings that the thought that they had been defrauded of their inheritance must have preyed on their minds» particularly on that of Saif. At this time Saif was deviding his time between Shargah and Hamriyah, but at the time of the murder he was actually in Hamriyah. On the day of the murder Saif accompanied his uncle Abdur Bahman to the Mcsotue and in the middle of prayers he got up and went outside. Entering an Arab house near by he took a rifle and returning to the Mosque shot his uncle Abdur Rahman. Subsequently Saif and his brothers proceeded to the murdered Shaikh 1 s house and killed the younger son and wife of Abdur Rahman. Abdur Rahman’s elder son, Hamad, has lived in Debai for the last three or four years ever since he tried to turn his father cut of Hamriyah. He appealed to the Shaikh of Umm-al-^aiwain for support in his claim to the Shaikhdcm of Hamriyah. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain sent for representatives of the people of Hamriyah and asked them if they were willing to have Hamad as their Shaikh/fhey, however, refused to have and sc the Shaikh of Umm-al~Qaiwain informed Hamad that he could do nothing more for him. At the present time, therefore, Saif is Shaikh of Hamriyah though I believe that Hamad has by no means given up hope of obtaining the Shaikhdcm. As he is not one of the Trucial Shaikhs and has no treaty relations with the British G-cvernment no question of his recognition, or of taking from him the customary undertaking to fulfil his treaty obligations arises. Hamriyah is a fief of shargah but in 1923 Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad of Shargah gave3. Shaikh Ah&amp;ur Bahman hin Sail* of Hamriyah a letter recognising the latter’s independence and since that time Hamriyah has been virtually independent. The question cf his formal recognition hy Ocvernment has been under tt* my consideration for some time and I was about to address the Government of India on the subject. In view&gt; however* cf the murder of Abdur Rahman bin Saif I think that it would be preferable to leave matters as they are. The question can be considered afresh if any changes in the situation on the Trucial Coast or in cur requirements there render this desirable.

Saif bin Abdullah and his brother were expelled from Hamriyah and Shargah and left for O^atar on the 8th October 1931. This Saif, it may be remembered, hs.d murdered his uncle, Abdur Rahman bin Saif, on the 5th February 1931. Early in the month of April, however, they secretly returned to Khan village near Shargah and organized a plot with the help of three inhabitants of Hamriyah to assassinate the present Headman of Hamriyah, Shaikh Humaid bin Abdur Rahman. They offered Rs.500 to Humaid^ slave Karwish to murder his master. The slave agreed and received 100 cartridges from them but went straight to his master and exposed the plot. He was instructed to demand part payment in advance which he did and Saif bin Abdullah and party crossed from Khan to Hamriyah in a sailing boat and hid in the house of Rashid bin Muhammad, in order to be on the spot as soon as the murder had been committed. On hearing from KarwashKarwash that the plotters had arrived, Shaikh Humaid accompanied by his followers came out of his fort and tried to arrest them. He at last found them in an isolated house, locked from the inside. An encounter ensued in which two men were fatally wounded, and Said bin Abdullah was arrested but the chief plotters Saif bin Abdullah and Majid bin Abdullah escaped to Khan village and thence into the desert. Humaid bin Abdur Rahman then complained to the Shaikh of Shargah that the maritime truce had been infringed as the attack had been made by sea. The Shaikh admitted the offence and handed over the boat to the Residency Agent, who had it burnt.3QNI Any further communication should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l. quoting M.Q1017/51” 9 th May i^/51 With reference to India Office letter of the 16th April, No.P.Z/2257/31, and previous T correspondence, I am commanded hy My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copy of reports #iich have heen received from the Commanding Officer, H.M.S.

On February 6th X received a report by telegram from the Residency Agent that on the night of January 31st the Shaikh of Shargah accompanied by Abdur Rahman and an armed party had surrounded his House and demanded the return of the slaves. The Residency Agent himself at the time was in another house and heard from the villagers of what was happening and it was apparently only through the inter vention of some of trie leading ausr&amp;h Inhabitants of the I have new received from the Captain of H.IS.S. for the information of the Government of India. 3. larly in January of this year three slaves bethe Town that AMur Bahnan was prevented from forcibly entering the house# H#M.S.'Hastings* was at Henjam at Uie time and I telegraphed to her Oaptain, who was in charge bl£ in the absence of tne Senior Naval Officer in -Bombay, asking him to proceed to the Trucial Ocast and make enquiries into the facts of the case# On February 16th, while I was at Muscat on tour, I received his reply that the Shaikh had not been present in person but that in other • respects the Besidency Agent’s report ms correct. He further stated that the only explanation the Shaikh had to offer was a ridiculous story that he had heard a ru mour that H.M.3#'Cyclamen' which had recently left the Erucial Coast, had landed Khalid, ex-Shaikh of Shargah, and that he was concealed in the Besidency Agent’s house. The Shaikh had therefore summoned Abdur Rahman to his assistance in case Khalid attempted to regain the Shaikh- dom. His route had led him past the Agency and this had given rise to a false impression. Before definitely deciding &lt;M the action to be taken I thought it would be as well to discuss the matter verbally with the Captain of H.M#3.'Hastings’and the Residency Agent, and 1 therefore proceeded in H.M.S. 'Folkestone' to Khassab and met Hastings there, the Besidency Agent being on beard the latter ship. They there gave me a detailed account of what had happened, and as there seemed no doubt about the facts of the case it was clearly a matter that called for prompt action, firstly, in order to show the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast that we would brook no interference with slaves seeking their freedom and secondly to protect my Agent on this Coast, who lives without a guard of any kind. Khan Bahadur Isa informed me that unless someseme immediate action was taken, the prestige of His Majesty*s Government on which depended his safety, would suffer a serious set hack and that it would hot he safe for him to remain any longer at Shargah, though he would serve anywhere else on the Coast. After this interview I despatched my telegram Nc.T.39 to the Government of India describing what had taken place and reaemunanding that the Shaikh should he called upon to surrender Ahdur lahman on hoard ship within 24 hours or failing this to pay a fine of Hs.2,000 and 100 rifles within 4 days. In the event of non- compliance I recemmended that the jekxx warship should he authcriaed, after giving due notice, to destroy a tower outside the town. On the 24th /ehruary I received intimation that my proposals were apjgn^ed ^d at once telegraphed to the Captain of I#M.S.'Hastings'^tc arrange to deliver the ultimatum. On the morning of the 25th February, the Captain of the 'Hastings' interviewed the Shaikh on hoard his ship and called upon him to deliver Ahdur '^tahman within 24 hours. It was further explained to him that until he had complied with the demands of His Majesty’s Government his salute would not he fired. At noon on the following day at the expiration of the ultimatum, a deputation from the Shaikh arrived on hoard. Ahdur Rahman was not present and it was clear * t* that their intention was to prccastinate and if possible secure to some modification in the terms of the ultimatum. It was then explained to them that the time for talking was past and that as Ahdur Rahman had net been produced His Majesty’s Government required the Shaikh to pay Rs. 2,000 fine and deliver 100 rifles. Further, if this order was not complied with by Boon, Monday the 2nd March, the Captain would take whatever action he considered necessary to enforce the demands.4 ( '4V V. , About 11 a.m* on Maroti 2nd, the son of the Residency Agent was sent ashore with instructions to warn British subjects that unless the fine was paid in full# firing would start at midnight* About 1 p*m. the ahaikh with a large following was observed on the beach. The Residency Agent was sent ashore to warn him tnat unless he had brought the full amount of the fine# he would not be received, ae was found to have brought only Rs.l2Q0 and 60 rifles and the party was turned back. At 9.30 p.a. the Shaikh arrived on beard# accom panied by his tfazir# his younger brother and a few merchants. He paid the fine in full and handed over 100 old model rifles# maiAly Martini 450. It had been stipulated that ail rifles should be breeoh loading and serviceable --six rifles were net passed and the Shaikh was ordered to replace them by midnight. The six rifles were replaced by 11 p.m. I think that the imposition of this fine and the surrender of the rifles will probably have just as good an effect as the deportation of Abdur Kanman would have had. It has touched the pooKots of the Shaikh and the leading inhabitants and they may be trusted to curb Afcdur Rahman’s activities in future, while I understand that the leading inhabitfints have given a serious warning to the Shaikh. The promptness with which action was taker undoubtedly impressed the population and it will serve[a useful object lesson to the Shaikhs of the Trucial Ocast that the British Croverament intend to insist that they shall act up to their treaty obligations as regards slavery, and will pro tect their representative.

This is a rather tiresome development, and it is to be hoped that as the time-limit draws near^its expiry, the Sheikh will think better. It nay be that the Sheikh*s request tlmt Abdur Rahman should be examined by the Political Resident in person is reasonable. One of the weaknesses of our position on the Trucial Coast is that we are dependent primarily for our information on the reports of the Residency Agent who, himself an Arab (and in this case, in view of past- history, presumably not well disposed towards Abdur Rahman), nay find it difficult on occasion to break away from local prejudices and to forego an opportunity of furthering his own interests. A/A compromise would be that Abdur Rahman should submit to examination on board the 'Hastings': but he is probably reluctant to put himself in our hands unless he knows definitely what his fate is likely to be. Ror the moment there is nothing to do but to await developments, may receive sorxe comment from the Political Resident t during the weekend. u 25^/7-&gt;7 • s} ^DL.^ICAL COMMITTEE 1 MAR I95jIMinute Paper.

The earlier history of Abdur Rahman is given in the submission on P.Z. 760/31. It will be seen that he has once before been deported from Shargah for alleged complicity in an attempt to murder the Residency Agent. The present telegram, read with that on P.Z. 760, shows that he has again become a storm centre in this little Principality and that, if matters are allowed to slide, the consequences may be unfortunate. The Trucial Coast has in the first place a bad reputation in connection with the slave trade and, as the Resident says, it is important to keep the Sheikhs up to the mark in regard to their treaty obligations to put this trade down. On a different point, the Residency Agent (an Arab) is our sole representative on the coast, and in the interests of maintaining our position, it is important that his safety should be assured by us. The Resident’s recommendations, which are accepted by the Government of India, are summarised in the last paragraph of his telegram of 18th February. It will be seen that he anticipates that, even if the Sheikh allows Abdur Rahman to escape into the interior (and so avoid deportation to Aden), it seems probable that difficulty need not be anticipated in securing a fine and the surrender of a certain number of rifles from him. The Resident does not contemplate that at the outside it will be necessary to - go/ . _go beyond destroying, after due notice, a tower outside his town, with ’’practically no risk to life”. been sent to the Naval Conmander-in-Chief, East Indies, instructing him to carry out the proposed measures against Abdur Rahman subject to the approval of the by the First Lord, who added to it that it was essential that the Government of India’s approval should first be obtained. It appears 'unnecessary to consult the Foreign Office (to whom the case has been mentioned demi- officially); no international reactions of any sort need be apprehended from acceptance of the Resident’s recommendation; and on various occasions in the past the ; Government of India have themselves felt able to give the necessary approval in cases such as this without first coming home.

He says that on the evening of 31st January shortly after 2 (sic)-, aloop had left, his house at Sharjah was surrounded by about 100 armed men under Abdurrahman Bin Mohammed who are (sic) {? annoyed at) release of slaves* Residency Agent was in another house* Some of leading inhabitants deterred Abdurrahman from forcibly entering house and reported matter to Sheikh of Sharjah, and after about two hours men withdrew* Commander of man~of~war Hastings called on Sheikh for explanation, and his only excuse for the outrage was ridiculous story that he had heard that man-of-war Cyoluman (sic) had landed Khalid p ex-Sheikh of Sharjah, and that he was concealed in Residency Agent’s house* Sheikh had therefore summoned Abdurrahman to his assistance in case Khalid attempted to regain Sheikhdom, and his route had led him past Agency, which had given rise to false impression. It is essential to show Trucial Sheikhs that we will brook—«2« r&gt; brook no interference with slaves attempting to obtain freedom., and expect tnem to fulfil their treaty obligations, and also ^tfill punish severely any insult to the Residency Agent. His safety in this primitive part of the \i oild. uepends entirely on our support. I met him yesterday in Khassab, and he informed me personally that he considered that it ^phla be unsafe for him to continue to reside in Sharjah unless serious notice was taken of incident* Further, it is clear that Abdurrahman is in no way reformed or grateful for clemency x extended to him by the Government of India* Thera is little douht hut that Sheikh was implicated in Gujq matter^ but, in any case, he gave guarantee ci-Gj m ° m for Abdurrahman« s good behaviour when the latter returned from Aden, and must be held responsible for an outrage committed in his town* I therefore recommend that Abdurrahman should again be deported to Aden for such period as may seem good to Government* Residency Agent considers it improbable, however, that Shaikh of Sharjah will surrender him, and he will probably escape into the interior* I recommend therefore that Sheikh should be called on (l) to surrender Abdurrahman on board man-of-war within 24- hour b j (2) failing this to pay fine of Bs*2,000 and surrender 100 rifles within 4 days. In unlikely event of Sheikh failing to comply, man-of-war should be authorised, after due notice, to destroy , be .c-wer out si do town.

Previous Papers 4475b 1000 5.30 This appears to be a local incident of no special importance. Hamriya is a village on the coast of Trucial Oman, eight miles south-west of Umm-al-Qaiwain town and oix miles north-east of the town of Ajman. The Sheikh has no separate treaty with us, 4 and is not recognised by us as an independent ruler or entitled to a salute. Criminally a dependent of Shargah, he appears subsequently to have transferred his allegiance to Umm-al- Qaiwain, and in 1927 hostilities between Shargah and Umn-al-Qaiwain in which Hamriya sided with tne latter were composed by the senior naval Officer (cp. P. 5735/27, flagged). Abdur Rahman, tne father-in-law of the then Sheikh of Shargah and 'uncle of the r present Sheikh, was banished in 1926 fer four years,/years for his suspected complicity in the attempted rrurder of the Residency Agent. The period of banishment was subsequently reduced to three years, and ^bdur Rahman returned to Shargah in 1929, the Sheikh undertaking responsibility for his continued rood behaviour. The Senior Naval Officer’s report, when received, may throw more light on his complicity in the present incident and show whether his conduct was such as to call for any action. iA.UStur*-k —IT/A^c (38 words) 908 4 Q TELEGRAM , ]?rom Political Resident in Persian (COPIES Gulf to Secretary of State for CIRCULATED) India, repeating telegram to Government cf India* Dated Bushire 5 7th Pehruaiy^ 3931.
