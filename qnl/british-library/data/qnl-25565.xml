E. MY telegram No. 379 of 19th. December. Tehran, December 24, 1914. [December 24, 3'50 p.m.) At the request of Minister for Foreign Affairs, my Russian colleague and I went to the Palace yesterday afternoon to discuss matters with himself and Prime Minister. 1 had been led to believe that financial situation was to have been topic of conversation, and I should have excused myself had I known that Russia’s policy in Persia was to be sole object of meeting. Prime Minister made a long speech, which can be resumed in a few words. He requested that Russian troops in Azerbaijan should be recalled in order that Turkey might be persuaded to cease from her violation of Persian territory. He protested against use Russia was making of Shuja, pointing out effect such action had on public opinion, and he solemnly assured us, upon his word of honour, that Persian Government had most faithfully conformed in strictest sense to neutrality Shah had proclaimed, and that our two Governments had been misinformed if they had, as he understood, some suspicion that the Cabinet had shown sympathy for Turkey. My Russian colleague appearing unwilling to reply, I took up the third point, and said that it was true that some doubt had been expressed as to whether protests addressed to Turkish Government had been couched in very determined language. I was, I said, quite prepared to accept His Highness’s assurances, but I felt it my duty to call the serious attention of Government to fact that the munshis of the Turkish Embassy, the German Legation, and the Austrian Legation were organising a formidable propaganda against us quite openly, and, as far as I could ascertain, quite unchecked by the Government. This appeared to me an infringement of neutrality of a friendly State. The Prime Minister replied that recent Russian action in Azerbaijan had done more than any propaganda to irritate public opinion. My Russian colleague then spoke much in the sense of Petrograd telegram No. 821 of 20th December to you, and made little or no concealment of the fact that Russia, or rather Russian military authorities of the Caucasus, looked upon Shuja as necessary to protect them from a possible Turkish flank attack. He added, although he personally saw fairness of the Persian request for recall of Russian troops, he was sureYhat it would have most deplorable reception at Petrograd, where he much feared that present good-will of the Cabinet would become even more suspected. He also hinted at possibility of further measures still more distasteful to Persia being taken. He consented, however, to submit request upon the reiterated and determined demand of the Prime Minister, who put forward all the oft-used arguments to show why he considered it in the interest of Russia, as much as in that of Persia, that troops should be withdrawn. On being asked for my opinion as to what is the chief cause of grudging ill-feeling towards us, I could only say thatl advent of Shuja in part he is now playing appeared to me to have much incensed public opinion. Believing it to be most important in interests of all that some compromise should be made, if possible, I suggested that, if Russian Government were able to withdraw their troops, Persian Government should guarantee withdrawal of Turkish troops from Persian soil, whilst Shuja should be left as generalissimo of all Persian troops in Azerbaijan, with Vali as Governor-General. (End of R.) Even the most ardent friends of Russia have deplored to me recently uncon- ciliatory attitude of Russian Government, which they point out is doing much to swell ranks of Turco-German party. Unless Russian Minister for Forei [1172—970]\ persuaded to look upon Persian question in a more conciliatory spirit, and to believe the assurances of Cabinet Ministers, who are, I am convinced, well disposed towards us, I much fear it will be impossible to stem the tide of popular feeling setting^ strongly against us. If police and gendarmerie remain loyal, it is probable that hand of Government would not be forced, but it is hard to determine what might be moral effect upon other Mussulman peoples of a religious movement, even though it proved unsuccessful.

Buchanan to Sir Edicard Grey.—(Received December 19, 12*40 p.m.) (No. 815.) Petrograd, December 18, 1914. PERSIAN Minister called two days ago and begged me to use my good offices to relieve tension which he feared was rapidly growing between Russian and Persian Governments. His own Government, he admitted, had been ill-advised in addressing protest after protest to the Russian Government about Russian troops, but the latter’s attitude wdth regard to Shuja, Medjliss, and present Persian Government was causing him anxiety. Situation might become critical, as both Germans and Turks were employing secret agents and distributing bribes with a view to stirring up trouble with Russia. He begged that I would treat what he had told me as private and confidential. I took advantage of a conversation which I had alone with Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon to impress on him necessity of adopting a more conciliatory attitude towards the Persian Government. A man like Shuja might perhaps be useful at the present moment, but it was but natural that the Persian Government should object to his acting as he was doing without their authority and to his receiving his instructions and supplies [?] from Russian consul-general at Tabriz, just as if Azerbaijan was a Russian province. If his services were indispensable, Russian Government should have represented this at Tehran, and should have endeavoured to induce Persian Government to authorise him to take measures to ward off invasion of Turks. It may not even now be too late to do this, and I would therefore put forward personal suggestion that his Excellency should approach the Persian Government with a view to regularising his position. Minister for Foreign Affairs denies that Shuja was acting by Russian orders, though he might have received assistance in the shape of rifles. He would, he said, consider my suggestion. I then read him Tehran telegram No. 375 of 16th December, explaining that Sir W. Townley’s attitude had been misrepresented. It would, I thought, be a great mistake for his Excellency to insist, as I gathered from aide-memoire summarised in my telegram No. 806 of 16th December, that it was his intention to do, on dismissal of the whole Cabinet. He ought to be contented with strengthening of it by the admis sion of one or two new members. Minister for Foreign Affairs eventually said he would be satisfied if Ala-es- Saltaneh and Moin-el-Vezareh were got rid of and if Vossuk-ed-Dowleh and Farman Farma entered Cabinet. He blamed Sir W. Townley for not having taken his Russian colleague into his confidence, as it was entirely owing to his silence that misunder standing had arisen. As regards Medjliss, I begged his Excellency not to press for its dissolution. It might, however, be possible, from a remark recently made to me by the Persian Minister, for new Cabinet to arrange that its sittings should be suspended till war was over, owing to its present number being only little above necessary quorum. His Excellency said that some arrangement of this kind might be sufficient. Since writing the above, I have received and communicated to M. Sazonof your telegram No. 1203 of 17th December, begging him not to act for the present on my suggestion with regard to Shuja. ' 'His Excellency said that if I would send him an aide-memoire, giving your reply [? to Russian Ambassador], he would see what he conld do. He repeated, however, what was reported in my telegram No. 806 of 16th December as to impossibility of sending Russian force. (Repeated to Tehran.) 1 I 72—814CONFIDENTIAL ( h I C , Q V \J l y RUSSIA Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 20, 9 a.m.) Petrograd, December 19, 1914. (No. 819.) (December 20, 8‘40 a.m.) IN tlie course of the conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs reported in my telegram No. 815 of 18th December, I said I wished to speak to him seriously on the subject of Persia. I had, however, no instructions to do so, and anything that I said must be regarded as expressly my own personal views. His Excellency had often told me that in his eyes friendship with England far outweighed all Persian interests, and that when war was over we shonld find no difficulty in coming to an understanding about Persia. I begged [? with respect to] differ from him, and in order to refresh his memory with regard to divergencies of our views, 1 read him that portion of my despatch No. 192 of 25th June which recorded my conversation with Emperor. His Excellency remarked at all events question of collection of taxes had since been regulated. I said even if this was the case views of two Governments with regard to future of Persia were diametrically opposed. His Excellency had recently spoken to me of an effective | control to be exercised by two Governments in their respective spheres, and had even mentioned the word protectorate. We, on the contrary, wished to avoid any step that would savour of partition. What had united the whole British Empire in the war in which England and Russia were allies was the violation of Belgian neutrality, and one of the principles for which we were fighting was the right of small nations to live independent without being absorbed by their more powerful neighbours. In 1907 England and Russia had recognised this right in the case of Persia, and were Russia to advocate her partition Russia’s former critics in England would accuse her of having no more respect for treaties than Germany, f Could, moreover, his Excellency affirm that Russian Government, or, rather, Russian consuls, had during last seven years honestly endeavoured to uphold principle of our agreement? To this Minister'for Foreign Affairs replied that when 1907 agreement was concluded Russian Government believed in Persia’s recuperative powers, but that now situation was hopeless. I remarked that this change for the worse was mainly due to the action of Russian consuls. I then proceeded to say that after the war Great Britain and Russia would be the two most powerful world Empires, and that if they remained friends the world’s peace would be assured. It was therefore essential to remove the only likely cause of friction. His Excellency had spoken of a settlement of Persian question at end of war. My personal view was that we should then be so absorbed by peace negotiations that we should have no time to spare for Persia, and that, peace once signed, we should all want a holiday and leave Persian question to take care of itself. I therefore thought, while signature of any new agreement might be left over till peace had been concluded, we should now resume our conversations at point at which they were broken off last summer and discuss, at any rate, general lines which that agreement was to take. Before submitting this suggestion to you I should like to know his views. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he was ready to begin such a discussion at | any moment either here or in London. It was useless to entrust it to our Ministers &gt; * at Tehran in view of their somewhat strained relations. Though fully realising pressure of work imposed by war, I am strongly of opinion that we shall be in better position to negotiate before, rather than after, conclusion of peace. If you approve our doing so, I would venture to submit certain con- * siderations. In first place I am convinced that there must be complete revision of 1907 agreement. Azerbaijan is irretrievably lost to Persia, and Russia is determined toa ffiiis Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma jesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when~~done with unless required for official use.y U S S I A. Your telegram No.815 of December 18th and 819 of December 19th. I am glad you havo spoken so fully to Minister for Foreign Affairs. You can tell him that I agree that Persian agieement must be revised and I shall be ready to enter upon discussions when there is opportunity. But we can hardly begin them while the war is in a critical state and we are all working under great pressure. Meanwhile you should again impress upon Minister for Foreign Affairs that trouble with Persia will make trouble with Mahommedans elsewhere and be serious embarrassment to us in prosecution of war. Any high handed action just now at Teheran with regard to central Government or Mejliss is most undesirable. We cannot become a party to it, for it might gravely prejudice our position in India and would increase influence of Turkish propaganda amongst Mahommedans everywhere who hither to resist it. I would therefore beg Minister for Foreign Affairs for reasons of large policy to give most definite instructions to Russian Minister and Agents in Persia to avoid high handed action and adopt a conciliatory attitude to Persian Govern ment. As regards collection of taxes by Russians it is stated that some £60,000 colle cted has not been paid to Persian revenue.

If Russian force cannot be sent and Minister for Foreign Affairs believes Shuja can be of use I agree with your suggestion that he should endeavour to regularize Shuja's position. Nor do I raise objection to the two personal changes deelyed by Minister for Foreign Affairs in Persian Cabinet (your telegram No.815 of December 18th) if they can be effected without undue pressure. But unless Russian agents in Persia adopt a con ciliatory policy especially at Teheran the Turco-German propaganda will succeed in exciting all Persia against us. Good relations with tho Central Government at Teheran are the only barrier to the trouble that this Turco-German propaganda will cause in Persia and elsewhere if it succeeds, I should even be prepared to join in a small loan to Persian Government if by that means it could bo kept to gether and its favourable attitude be secured while the war lasts. We should do all we can to enlist and support efforts of Persian Government to suppress popular excitement and counteract pro-Turkish feeling. (Repeated to Tehran).Immediate and ^nfidential.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 1G, 10‘55 p.m.) Tehran, December 16, 1914. 375.) (December 16, T55 p.m.) I MUST protest emphatically against false interpretation of my words and actions contained in summary of Russian aide-memoire telegraphed by Sir Gr. Buchanan in his Excellency’s telegram No. 797 of 14th December. My Russian colleague suffers from a very short memory or from inability to repeat correctly what has been said to him. The facts are as follows :— As soon as it was decided that Medjliss should meet at an early date, the members of the Moderate party, which forms the majority of the chamber as at present constituted, made up their differences with the Democrats and sent an emissary to me to say that they wished to leave the Cabinet a free hand as long as the wmr lasted, but that in order to do so they must have a Cabinet in which they had confidence and to ask my advice. Ain-ed-Dowdeh was the statesman, my informant told me, whom they would prefer to form new Cabinet or to assume prominent position in Mustaufi-ub Mamalek’s Cabinet. I replied that I wms sure that my Government would appreciate the desire of the Medjiiss to do nothing to render present difficult situation more difficult, and I exhorted my visitor to impress on his friends the necessity of conciliating Russia, whose great stake in Persia made it right that her interests should receive special consideration. I urged that Vossuk-ed-Dowleh or Saad-ed-Dowleh should be included in the Cabinet, and pointed out that Ain-ed-Dowleh’s presence might be misinterpreted, suggesting that his place might be taken by Farman Farma. I did not speak to my Russian colleague because I felt sure that he would misunderstand my motives or misrepresent my action, and I decided to go away for a few 7 days during Moharrem in order that any Cabinet change that was to take place might be made in my absence. This I did, taking an English telegraph clerk with me that 1 might be in constant touch with the legation. On my return I found nothing had been done, and when I saw my colleague I told him what had passed and the reason wdiy I had left Tehran, which, I said, was in order that he should not be able to say, as he had done most unjustly in the case of the present Cabinet, that I had formed a new one. I said that for this reason I did not propose to take any part in further negotiations. Russian Minister replied that it v r as all the same to him w r ho formed the Cabinet, that after eleven months’ experience of Persia he had come to the conclusion that whoever w r as Minister for Foreign Affairs or Prime Minister it made no difference, and he always had to deal with the detestable Muin-eTVezareh. He positively refused to give me any lead as to whom he u ? ould like to see form the new 7 Cabinet or enter the present one. There is no Cabinet crisis, as will be evident from the above, and I cannot be accused of refusing to act wdth a colleague who appears to be unable to discuss the situation intelligently and refuses to make any suggestion beyond Saad and Vossuk-ed- Dowleh, taking special pains to make it clear that Petrograd, not he, is supporting them. As 1 told my colleague at our last interview, 1 have no objection to Vossuk-ed- Dowleh, but I am impotent to [group omitted : ? persuade] Medjliss to legalise him or Saad.

FarmanFarma read me yesterday a letter from bis estate agent at Soujboulak dated ten days ago. He said that a Turkish force of 300 men had arrived with some 600 Turkish Kurds, hut that they had not succeeded in making any recruits among the tribesmen. This report confirms information received from other sources that there is no great danger of a serious Turkish incursion, and it is hard to see where the 50,000 men mentioned in the Russian aide-memoire were to come from. Modern Persia has never seen such a force assembled, and thousands here generally become hundreds or even tens on closer scrutiny. It is true that one cannot claim much strength for present Cabinet {I dubbed it weak when formed), but I cannot see any sort of ground for suspicion that it has any sympathy with Turkey, and I have no hesitation in asserting that Mutessarif of Kerkuk had no reason for saying that Turkish troops had crossed the frontier with the consent of the Persian Government. As soon as Turkey’s incursion was reported here, a strong protest was addressed to Turkish Ambassador and to Turkish Government through Persian Ambassador at Constantinople. The Petrograd Cabinet does not appear to be aware that there is strong feeling here in favour of German-Turks. This has so far been successfully muzzled by efforts of Cabinet, which cannot in justice be called ill-intentioned towards us and which shows but little trace of general hatred of Russia and her policy in Persia which is felt here by all classes, even by those who for private reasons have to appear well disposed towards Russia. It is possible that a Cabinet such as M. Sazonof_ desires may be formed in due time, but anything in the nature of high-handed action such as would appear to be intended in last three paragraphs of Sir G. Buchanan’s telegram is, in my opinion, much to be deprecated at a moment when a spark would suffice to ignite a popular conflagration against a Cabinet which refuses to listen to the daily appeals of the sacred men of Nedjef and Kerbela. Present rumour that German Emperor and his people have embraced Islam is believed by many. (Repeated to Petrograd.) [1172—797]C ON KLDENT1A l PERSIA Sir W.

Such telegrams are sedulously circulated by Turkish adherents and make no small impression on the populace, which is restless under goading of Turkish and German emissaries. Farman Farm a assured me yesterday that situation is becoming disquieting. Hip object was not improbably to impress on me the necessity of a strong man like himself being appointed Minister of the Interior, but one cannot afford entirely to ignore warning of an influential man, who declares that his adherents are falling away because of his known anti-Turkish sentiments. Sardar Assad Bakhtiari, who, although blind and infirm, knows much about what is going on, assured me, on the other hand, that there is no cause for apprehension.

(December 17, 7’20 a.m.) I HAVE received aide-memoire from Russian Government to the following effect: — According to recent information received by Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a Turkish detachment accompanied by Kurdish cavalry recently arrived at Soujboulak, announcing intention of expelling Russians from Azerbaijan. There is danger of local Persian Kurds, numbering some 50,000 horsemen, joining Turks to attack and plunder Tabriz. Russian force could not be sent so far from Caucasian base, and in these circumstances role of Shuja, who has great influence among local tribes, becomes of utmost importance. Persian Government fail to grasp the danger to Tabriz, and, inspired only by their suspicion of Shuja, instead of supporting him, do all they can to thwart his plans. General attitude of Persian Government of late gives ground for suspicion that Tehran Cabinet’s sympathies are with Turkey, and perhaps Kerkouk Mutessarif was not far wrong in saying in his letter to Shuja that Turkish troops had crossed the frontier with the consent of Persian Government to rid them of Russians. Russian Government insist on danger of present situation in Persia and serious consequences that may ensue, and hope that His Majesty’s Government will assist them in promptly remedying state of affairs. Onlv way of so doing would be to replace present weak and ill-intentioned Cabinet by another, and bring to bear an energetic activity inspired by feelings of good-will *towards Russia and England. Henceforth it would seem necessary that representatives of the two Powers should agree at once to announce [group undecypherable] at Tehran determination of the two Governments to put an end to present situation. Russian Government propose formation of Cabinet under presidency of Mustaufi- ul-Mamalek, with Farman Farma as Minister of Interior and Vossuk-ed-Dowleh as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the other members to be chosen by these three in agreement, and decision to be communicated to Shah by the President. Eventual opposition of the Medjliss could be got over by further reducing the already restricted number of deputies so as to bring about a dissolution through absence of necessary quorum.

' MY telegram No. 372 of lltli December. Russian Minister called on me this morning to ask in the name of his Government if I would co-operate with him in endeavouring to persuade Persian Government to authorise Shuja to organise resistance to advance of Turks into Azerbaijan. I replied' that I could not take any action in the sense desired without your instructions, and on being pressed for my personal opinion by my colleague, I added that it seemed to me rather too much to urge Persian Government, however unofficially, to recognise as their champion a man in whom they had no confidence, and that I was further convinced that they would never agree I continued that it appeared to me rather a mean way to endeavour to drag Persia into the quarrel, and it would look as if Russia wanted her faithful Shuja to do work for her which would make Persia a belligerent, because she has no troops to spare for the purpose herself. I expiesse my opinion that it was one thing frankly to seek Persian co-operation if that was wanted, making such conditions as Persia might feel justified in asking, but that it was quite another story to, as it were, trick her into becoming a belligerent through the actions of a man who is looked upon as a rebel. My colleague scorned greatly ashamed of his mission. &lt; Russian Minister said that Turks have not left Soujboulak, but are now busily preparing a further advance, and have looted Russian consulate. Minister for Foreign Affairs complained to me that Shuja intercepts the telegrams from Soujboulak, and that Government is consequently not aware of what is happening there. (Repeated to Petrograd.)

YOUR telegram No. 1190 of 13th December. I communicated to Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning substance of Tehran ,ogo telegram No. 372 of 11th December, and expressed hope that Russian Government would either cause Shuja to leave or would, at all events, insist on his ceasing his military activity. His Excellency said that he had sacrificed Shuja in order to be agreeable to His Majesty’s Government, although, as Governor of Tabriz, he had rendered Russia and Russian commerce invaluable service, but that it had been impossible for him to prevent his returning to protect his own property^ On my reminding him of corruption and gross cruelty of which he had been guilty, his Excellency declared that he was not worse than other Persian Governors in these respects, but that any Persian who was friendly disposed towards Russia was sure to incur hostility of British Legation. Whatever his faults, Shuja was one of the few strong men in Persia, and it was thanks to him that Russian consul had been able to return to Soujboulak. His Excellency, who showed considerable irritation at my having reverted to the subject, insisted that at a moment like the present, when there was danger of Turkish attack, a strong man like Shuja might be very useful. His Excellency then gave me aide-memoire, of which I am sending translation in a separate telegram, complaining of present Persian Government, whom he descubed as weak, incapable, and openly hostile to Russia. On my remarking that,.unfortunately, Russia had never done anything to gain Persian sympathies, his Excellency protested, saying that it was thanks to Russian intervention that Turks had not some time ago incorporated the whole of Urmia district. His Majesty’s Government, he said, would never realise that Russia as a limitrophe country had most impoitant inteiests to licpiidate, and though they were continually complaining of what Russia did, he must [group undecypherable] confess that he did not understand what their real policy was. Rreplied that it was to maintain Persia’s independence and integrity in spirit of 1907 agreement. His Excellency assented, but said that he would like to know how this was possible with a moribund country that could not stand alone. We should be no more successful wilh Persia than we had been with Turkey. In any case, only thing to be done was for us to come to some definite understanding about Persia when the war was over.

What Shuja had done was to drive off an incursion of Turks and Kurds between that place and Matbara, where his estates are, and in so doing he was rendering Persian Government service. As conversation again turned on moribund condition of Persia, 1 remarked that, though what his Excellency had said on the subject might be true, I could not feel any sympathy for policy pursued by Russian Government. It seemed aimed at putting an end to sufferings of the sick man hastening his death while we were endeavouring to prolong his days in the hope of one day restor[? mg hisj health.

Turkey needed these ships for purpose of her general policy. . , tt&gt; i ^ As to the closing of the Dardanelles, Turkey had to take this step because England had ordered Turkish ships to be treated as enemies, a ad [?

The British complaint that Germans had been taken into the service ol Turkey was unjustifiable, because it is clear that their services were only required lor 1 •y’l Pijl. ' England is accused of having engineered Balkan war, and of having used her influence to secure Turkish territory in Europe for Balkan States after the war. Mr. Asquith is quoted as having said, after the reoccupation of Adnanople, that Turkey would be doomed by Europe unless she evacuated the city. It is ^g 1 ^ 1 that Great Britain has, moreover, vainly intrigued _ against Turkey m Arabia and in Persian Gulf. The British Government is also accused of having co-operated with Russia in preventing the carrying out of the necessary measures of reform in Turkey; Morocco and Egypt are mentioned as instances of British deter mination to put an end to Islamic countries. The Anglo-Russian _ Convention does not escape notice, and attention of people is called to manner m which Persian independence and integrity have been preserved by England and Russia. p nCiAr | Finally, it is pointed out that British policy towards I s )am has always been based on Mr Gladstone’s statement in House of Commons m 1894 that as long as this cursed book (the Koran) exists on earth there will be no peace.

Russian Government have considered question of recalling troops from Khorasan and Mazandera.^, They point out that presence of Russian troops cannot be regarded in any way as a violation of Persian neutrality, since these troops entered Persia long- before the Russo-Turkish war in order do secure safety of Russian foreign institutions and subjects and to maintain that order which the Persian Government have hitherto been unable themselves to enforce. In fact, small Russian detachments in Khorasan and Mazandera^were more in nature of reinforcement to local consular guards. Moreover, withdrawal of their troops would, in opinion of Russian Govern ment, far from satisfying the Turk s, merely incite them to more persistent efforts towards the attainment of their mam object, namely, recall of Russian detachments at Kazvin and in Azerbaijan. As regards Meshed, Russian Government point out that prompt suppression of active anti -Russian propaganda being carried on there as well as in Asterabad and v^) -' ^AlazanderaVhas been due exclusively to presence of Russian troops. They add that Meshed, under a weak, aged Governor-General, has been hitherto unable to produce Persian force capable of maintaining order, and that Persian Government by total lack of funds will not be in a position to create such a force.

R. {November 24, 1914, 3'30 p.m.) AT a meeting at the Russian Legation, at which Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Russian Minister, and myself were present, Prime Minister expressed request that Russia would withdraw her troops from all places in North Persia other than Azerbaijan. His Highness expressed his regret that Russian Government had not agreed to withdraw their troops from that province before, but recognised, much as he still wished it were possible, that it was too late to do so now. He argued that task of Persian Government would be made much easier if the Russian troops were withdrawn from other places in Persia, because people hostile to neutral policy of Government would then have less occasion to jeer at a neutrality which consisted in tolerating the presence on Persian soil of troops of a foreign country at war with a Mussulman State. It transpires that Turkish Ambassador has lately used threatening language, and has said that if Russian troops remain in parts of Persia other than Azerbaijan Turkey will no longer consider herself bound to respect Persian neutrality. Russian Minister represented that if Russia were now to concede Persia’s request it might well be considered by general public as a yielding to Turkey’s threats. This might not discourage, but rather encourage, party in favour of Turkey. It would, I think, be well, as far as it may be possible, to make some concession to Persia in direction of this request. State of country does not necessitate presence of Russian troops in Mazandaran and Meshed, but it would be well to keep them at Kazvin and Resht until the war is over. A specially good impression would, I think, be male if the troops were with drawn from Meshed, and such a step could hardly be construed by public as a yielding to Turkish pressure. My Russian colleague is telegraphing to Petrograd in this sense. (Repeated to Petrograd.)CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan (Petrograd). (No. 1106.)

He added that Turkish success or increase of territory could not fail to be contrary to Persia’s benefit. He stated, in conclusion, in what Minister for Foreign Affairs considered to be a somewhat menacing tone, that Russia’s future attitude towards Persia would depend on latter’s behaviour in the present crisis.

When he had sent telegram to Russian Ambassador embodied in your telegram No. 1008 of 11th November it had not, he said, struck him that, were Persia to place herself openly on our side, she would be running a very serious risk. He was, moreover, convinced we should never induce her to take an active part with us in a war against another Mussulman State. He was therefore compelled to withdraw his original proposal. His Excellency then handed me an aide-memoire, of which following is a summary :— “ After due reflection Russian Government had arrived at the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to propose to Persian Government that they should co-operate with us. It was very improbable that a Mussulman country would take such a step, and, moreover, Persians, having no army, would be exposed to attack in some region, such as along Turco-Persian frontier or between Zohab and Mohammerah, where neither Russian nor British troops could come to her assistance. “ Russian Government accordingly proposed that the two legations should assure Persian Government of friendly sentiments animating Russia and Great Britain, as well as of their firm intention to maintain integrity of Persia and invite her, without actually allying herself with the two Powers, to give them all the assistance in her power. “ Persia would thus merely have to act in the same manner as she did during Russo- Turkish war of 1877. “ The two legations would give Persian Government to understand that in the event of a favourable issue to the war they can count upon certain compensation.” [Group undecypherable] added that if you wished it he was quite ready to omit reference to compensation contained in concluding paragraph, as Persian Government might interpret it to mean our readiness to give latter financial assistance.

As no absolute guarantee however can be given them that Russian troops will not be withdrawn we have thought it advisable to add that they would do well to hold themselves ready for this eventuality and that renewed instructions have been sent to Russian Vice-Consul to facilitate their journey to Tabriz should this become necessary (ends)'.- Repeated to Retrograd.10 From Viceroy, 12th November 1914. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram of 9th November. If as would appear from Townley’s telegram 298, lltli October, and 300 of 14th October, Turkish Khurds accompanied by Turkish troops at instigation of Constantinople violated Persian territory, there would appear to be no objection to Russia advancing through Azerbaijan as this could be explained on the ground that Russia was thereby ensuring integrity of Persia which we now mutually agreed to guarantee. If,^ however, violation by Turkey is not established, I think Russia should, if possible, be dissuaded from taking such a serious step as the violation of Persian neutrality even at the cost of some military disadvantage to herself. For Russia to do so without some such justification as suggested above would undoubtedly create a hostile feeling in India towards our Allies, and indirectly towards ourselves and estrange Mohamedan sentiment especially in Afghanistan, by which our interests would suffer. It might also possibly affect us adversely in eyes of other neutral powers. As to persuading Persia to join Allies she would doubtless be most reluctant, but might be induced to do so by (1) guarantee of continued integrity and real independence including withdrawal after war of Russian garrisons in North Persia, (2) guarantee against reprisals by Turkey, (3) money, e.y., the cancellation of outstanding debts to us and to Russia. For reasons given in my official telegram of 10th September, I am strongly opposed to any promise regarding Nejef and Kerbella. By inducing Persia to join Allies we should escape embarrassing question of neutrality at Abadan and Moham- merah, German intrigue and influence would be eliminated from Persia, and effect on Moslem opinion would be to our advantage. Persia’s excuse might be necessity of giving every facility to Powers who have jointly guaranteed her integrity and independence, while violation of her territory by Turks if established and interference with Persian shipping on Shat-el-Arab would supply specific casus belli. If 4 ersia lefuses to join Allies and Russia persists without adequate arid reasonable justification on violation of Azerbaijan, I think we should as far as possible dissociate ourselves from such action as being inconsistent with our attitude towards Germany on her violation of neutrality of Belgium and with our role as protector of weak against the strong, both of which ideals have appealed to the imagination and sentiment of people of India and have popularised war. Any countenance by His Majesty’s Government of perverse ^o^-T^kion m Persia would have contrary effect and might have serious results in this country at a time when it has been denuded of troops.X CONFIDENTIAL. ox ^ ■) “r-r-’ic- Sir Edward Grey to Sir G, Buchanan (Petrograd). (No. 1015.) _ _ Foreign Office, November 12, 1914, 11 a.m. IN continuation of my telegram No. 1008 of 11th November. I hope Minister for Foreign Affairs will understand that desire not to see Persian neutrality violated arises solely from the embarrassment that would be caused were we to appear in attacking Turkey to do anything analogous to German action in violating neutrality of Belgium to attack France. I am therefore most anxious to promote suggestion of Minister for Foreign Affairs to induce Persia to take our side. Meanwhile, the presence of Russian troops in Azerbaijan, as before the war, to keep order, which Persia herself is unable to secure, need not be affected, and, if Turkey violates the neutrality of Persia, the Russian Government or His Majesty’s Government will be entitled to take any action through Persia against Turkey that the situation requires. It had occurred to me that a strong offensive by Russia against Turkey might diminish the power of Turkey to attack Egypt, but I understand that Russian military authorities consider that everything depends upon the success of their offensive against Germany, and that nothing should be allowed to divert Russian forces from this object. We share this view so entirely ourselves that we have at times retained only two battalions of regular troops in Great Britain in order that we might send the utmost we could to fight in Belgium and France. For the same reason we are prepared to run some risk in Egypt, or at any rate not to retain forces in the east for an offensive against Turkey. But I should like Minister for Foreign Affairs to know that however much we or Russia may assume a defensive attitude in the war with Turkey, while the issue against Germany, on which all other issues depend, is pressed to a successful conclusion, we regard the conduct of the Turkish Government as having made a complete settlement of the Turkish question, including that of the Straits and Constantinople, in agreement with Russia inevitable. This will of course be effected after Germany is defeated, whether or not Turkish rule is overthrown in the course of hostilities meanwhile. (Repeated to Bordeaux, No. 931, and Tehran, No. 284.)

Already two false stories have made no small impression—one that Russian troops at Kazvin were marching on Tehran, the other that Russian Cossack officer had endeavoured to take familiarities with Persian woman in the bazaars. Although the two Governments have decided not to assist Persia financially any more, I think excellent impression would be made, and a good work done, if some money were found for the police and the gendarmerie, as it appears to me really important that Imperial Government should have these forces to depend on at least as long as the war lasts.

Her neutrality will thus become fictitious and tiresome as it will not be possible to regard Persian Government’s protest This is regrettable and Russia's attitude towards Persia will not fail to cause unfavourable impression among Mohammedan nations and even an outburst against Russia and England which they are so anxious to avoid. danger, namely to persuade Persia of the necessity - from the point of view of her prestige and dignity - to place herself on our ride, to cease all relations with our enemies and to give us her help so far as she is able. On their side, Great Britain and Russia could not only renew to Persia their firm decision not to impair the integrity of her territory but also promise her in the event of a success ful issue from the war against Turkey, compensations, namely the Shia sanctuaries of Nedjef and Kerbela. Such action would, in Monsieur Sazonow’s opinion, create a most favourable impression in the^.Mussulman countries both to wards Great Britain and Russia.

H i Sir, Sin-e the outbreak of hostilities in Eur ope the Persian Government have been uonsidaring the de - sir ability of making a public; declaration of Persian neutrality. It was felt ? however »that such an announce ment was needless,and the matter dropped until the occurrence of several incidents on the frontier of Azerbaijan,in which Russian and Turkish troops were dirootly or indirectly concerned,brought jt home to them that hostilities migfrt break out between the two above-named Powers,and that Persian territory might be cos 6 the theatre of war. On the 30th ultimo,in the course of a visit I paid Eis Highness on his weekly reception day,the Minister for Foreign Affairs broached the subject. He explained that the Government was much concerned at the possibility of Azerbaijan being devastated by e.ntending armies,and that they were seriously considering the advisability of Persia making a public declaration of neutrality. Ala^us-fultaneh added that he had spoken to the Turkish Ambassador who had replied that Persian neutrality could not be taken seriously so long as Russ ian troops were in occupation of Persian territory,but undertook The Eight Honourable Sir E.Grey,Part. ,K.G. ,M.F. , etc etc etcundertook,in the name of hie Oovexnment.that the Turkish troops on the frontier would be withdrawn fox some distance ,if l.ussian troops evacuated Azerbaijan, and that possibly Turkey might even demobilize. The Minister represented that PersiSa would risk a good deal to safeguard one of her richest pro vinces from the horrors of war. It was therefore pro posed to ask the Russian Government to withdraw their troops,in order that Turkey might no longer have an excuse for maintaining a force on the frontier .whose very resence was a constant menace to Persia's peace, since it had created much unrest among the frontier tribes,who were making constant incursions into Pers - ian ter itory,both in those parts where they came into collision with F.usBian troops,and in the regions where the wild Persian tribes proved their only opponents. I represented to i&amp;iti Ala-us-Sultaneh that Bussia could hardly be expected to withdraw her troops from Azerbaijan on the mere assurance of the Turkish Ambassador .whose attitude since the war began had been far from friendly,and who was at that moment actively occupied in a hunt after brigands on the Per - sian side of the frontier which seemed hardly judicious at a moment when war was in the air ,and a collision with the T.ussians,or at least friction,was likely to ensue. I then asked what steps the Persian Government proposed to take to make good their neutrality,and to secure protection for the lives and properties of for - signers in Azerbaijan. I pointed out that a mere ru - mour that I.ussia was about to withdraw her forces from theU1 the UTumia district had produced a panic,which shown the T.uesian Legation the undesirability of going on with the movement at the present moment. The Foreign Minister answered that the Gov - eminent proposed to resuscitate the old military force that had never really been disbanded,although they have not ox late been summoned to Join the colours. This force would be supplemented by certain tribal levies, and,after consultation with Eerdar I.eschid,the 0^ Act ing Governor General,the abinet had satisfied themselves that a reliable force of about 20,000 men could be collec ted. I replied that such a semi-irregular force jfl as that he described had small attraction for me and that a considerable sum of money would be required for its up keep, Ala-us-fultaneh then said that the Government also proposed to send the Valiahd to Tabriz at once,as they felt confident that the presence of the Heir Appax - ent in the capital of Azerbaijan would do much to inspire a feeling of confide nee, and produce a mor^ normal state of affairs than hast existed for a long time,. His High ness added that the matter would be finally considered at a rabinet council the following day,and that he would communicate with me after the meeting. Bedore taking leave of the Minister I advised him to take the Russian Minister into his confidence,and ascertain his views. Ala-us-Bultaneh replied that he would have done so,had M.Korostovetz called upon him that afternoon. IIZO I went to see my Russian Colleague the follow, ing aorning and told him exactly what had passed between the Foreign hinistei and myself the previous afternoon. Late on the evening of the 1st instant the Chef do Cabinet came to see me in the name of thev Minister for Foreign Affairs,to tell me that the Cabi net had decided to take action in the sense sketched by Ala-us-Sultsneh the previous day. Moin-ul-Vezireh added that it was estimated that the creation and ma in- ten^n^e ox a xorce of 20,000 men in Azerbaijan would cost about £450,000 and it was p oposed to ask the British and F.ussian Governments to supply the money, as an advance. I answered that the rafrinet woud do well to put all idea of getting money for such a purpose from the two Governments out of their head; I felt sure that His Majesty’s Government would not give the money,and it seemed hardly reasonable to suppose that the Bus si an Government would both agree to withdraw their troops from Azerbaijan , and advance a la»ge sum of money for the upkeep of an inefficient force to take their place, be had previously been discussing a pro posed arrangement with the Bussian Bank,under which that institution w ,uld advance a million tomans to pay off the loan of £100,000 made to the Persian Govern - ment about 18 months ago by the Imperial Bank,which is secured on the Northern land-tax,the proviboe of Azer baijan being excluded. I suiggested that the Imperial Bank might possibly be willing to advance the money refunded upon some other security. I urged the Chef de Cabinet that no time shouldshould be lost In submitting these proposal, to the T.ussian Kinistar as th« matter in hand primarily con - earned the Russian Government. Hoin-ul-Veaireh replied that it was proposed to ^ u.Korostovets to meet the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affaire Ui mimu at the latter's house the following afternoon and suggested that I also should be present. I said that I would ooae p. ovided that the Russian Minister was willing that I should assist at the interview. M.horostovets having consented,we met on Friday afternoon,the 2nd instant, at Ala^us-f ultaneh's house. The Prime Minister explained the views of the Persian Government in somewhat similar language y( to that used to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and laid especial stress upon the earnest desire of the Per si an Government not to see Azerbaijan ft* become the theatre of war between Russia and Turkey. He explained that the only way to avoid this,in the opinion of the Persian Government.was for Russia to remove a possible cause of friction by withdrawing her troops. He ex - pressed his conviction that if this was done Turkey would not only respect Persia's neutrality,but would withdraw her troops from the frontier, tl it transpired that he and the Minister for Foreign Affaire had called upon the Turkish Ambassador that morning,when His Ex- cellency nad repeated the assurances previously given. VGien Kustofi-ul-Mamalek had finished speaking he looked towards M.Korostovetz and awaited his answer. Instead of replying,the Russian Minister turned to me and said that he would first of all like to hear the views of his British Colleague. I replied thatI, fi-ltiiiough. i'fc appeal ed “fco iae *ttxaP h© was Pii© pio— pei person to spwak first,I was quite ready,einoe he desired it,to give my opinion. It appeared to me,I said,quite natural that Persia should desire to prevent by every means in her power Azerbaijan from becoming a battle field upon which pussia and Turkey should fight out their quarrel,but she must bear in mind that the presence of '.ussian troops on Persian soil had no connection whatever with the present situation. Tiuseia had been cons trained, in the protection of her own interests,to send troops to N. Per si a, and that she maintained them there now was no menace to Turkey,who had of her own freewill mobili zed her forces in Asia Hinor ,when it was clear that Russia harboured no hostile designs against her. Turk ey had moreover Judged the moment opportune to press £ certain claims by force of arms against dwellers on the frontier who were unde stood to enjoy some measure of Russian p: oteotion. Such action r as calculated to p oduce friction. It was not fo me,I said,to Judge whether ox not the present was a suitable moment for Russia to withdraw her troops,but I had reason to believe that such a movement had been considered and that it was qot improbable that Turkey*© attitude had caused the idea to be abandoned. It seemed to me,I added,that Persia should produce much more conclusive assurances than those of the Turkish Ambassador before she could ask Russia,on the strength of such assurances,to withd aw her t oops. M.Korostovetz then stated that he enti rely agreed with what I had said,and expreo^ed his ap preciation of the desire of the Persian Government to see the Russian troops withdrawn. He twice repeated that,although he did not always agree with the Persian Government,iz; Government, he did bo in this aTtl&lt; ular in^tauac • and fully ey^PftthiBed with them. **o was aioful to lay etia® upon the faut that this wae only hia personal opinion, and that su h opinion had no value. After some itucthe? convex feat ion it war agreed that the Minieter for Foreign Affair© should address a note to the X’USFian ^inirter stating that Fereia was anxious to deolare hex neutrality, and asking i.uferia to withdraw her troops, in order that the easne might be rendered effmot ive and beyond cavil. The note was to add that the fuvkieh Anbassadoi had given aesurance© that the Turkish troop© would be withdrawn from the frontier, if the Bus si an troops evaluated Azerbaijan. Monsieur Korostovetss agreed to receive the note but did not precise to do more than transmit it to Petrograd. X have the honour to ©n .loee a translation of the note, a ©usEiaary of whioh * submitted to you in my telegram Ko.294 of the 3th instant. My Bueeian aolleague has informed me that monsieur Saaonoff iia£ replied that he eaomot agree to withdraw the Buseian troops, because he ,on©idexa their presenoe to be neoes&amp;ary to guarantee order and safety of Buerian© and other foreigners, fhe reply adds that Persia oannot do this her ©eld as ©he has no capable for ^e at her disposal, and that a state of anarchy would ensue if the troops were re.ailed, su h as would provoke Turkish intervention despite the as? urances given by the AmbaB adox. As regards the-e a^ruran.es, they were either never so categorical as the Persian ^iniFtecB cade out ox the Ambassador has altered hie tone upon the receipt of in structions from Constantinople^ Hi© Excellency ha© sine# our conversation told the Busrian minister that he never under took that the fu kieh troop© would be withdrawn from ^ or.* tier, if the Busslan© evaluated Azerbaijan, axuS called attentionattention to the diesimulaiity of tto Eituation, the SurkB being on theii own texiitosy, whexeae the fauEBiansa axe on foreign soil, tie averts that all he said war, that Turkey would xeepeot Pexeia'c; neutrality and it wil be t notioed that the Peisian note olaiae no mo e. It was a natural^surmise that the Turkich Ambasa- ador had instigated the Per elan Government to take thie step. The faot that ix umntan en ne ensitated tho use of his name lent additional colour to this theory. It is box© than possible that he may have hoped that Turkey would benefit, if the Russians could be persuaded to withdraw, but 1 do not think that he inspired the idea. From the moment that the r wa» broke out the Fere Ians have been watching eagerly to L see jfrf the withdrawal of the Russian troo,* would nob follow.

November from Hussion minister for Foreign Affairs to Russian Ambassador in London:- 'Following instructions have been sent to Tiflis and Tehran: it is important from every point of view that our military operations in Persian territory should weigh as lightly as possible on the population which should be spared in every respect. Apart from other considerations our own economic interests in Azerbaijan, one of the chief markets for our produce, would be the first to suffer from the impoverishment of the Province. Please instruct our military authorities in Persia in this sense. I should add that the British Government is anxious as to the effect that the war may have in Egypt, Afghanistan and India. The impression produced on Moslem feeling will depend considerably on the nature of our military operations in Persia and we should therefore be all the more careful to spare the country and population. It is evident that it is most important to avoid anything which might arouse feeling against us or stir up Moslem fanaticism which would entail the greatest danger to Russian interests also'.111 fOi'TIDES TIAL.

Both Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have requested me to state that Persia’s action was not due to any outside influence, and that Government merely sought to prevent, if possible, Azerbaijan from becoming the theatre of war between Russia and Turkey in order to save what they consider a sorely tried province from the horrors of devastation. They profess to believe that friction likely to lead to hostilities, sooner or later, might have been avoided had Russia consented to withdraw her troops, but think war inevitable now that she has refused to do so, since repeated frontier incidents, which are of almost daily occurrence, must produce intolerable situation. In spite of their disappointment, tone of the Ministers was more anti-Turkish than anti-Russian, but should war break out and hostilities be waged in Azerbaijan, Persian Government will probably be powerless to prevent Kurds, Shahsevans, and others, who have grudges against Russians, from carrying on guerrilla warfare. It is to be hoped that other parts of Persia would remain quiet, but there can be but small doubt that all Persia would dearly love to seize the opportunity to have a shot at the hated Russians.

It is argued that Turks will hold that this neutrality [?] must be [figures omitted] a farce as long as Russian troops remain in Azerbaijan. Russians will therefore be requested to withdraw their troops, and it is asserted that Turkish Ambassador has given formal assurance in the name of his Government that if Russian troops evacuated Azerbaijan Turkish troops will be withdrawn to a distance from Persian frontier and will possibly be demobilised. In order to guarantee order in the regions to be evacuated, Persian Government propose sending Vali Ahd to Tabriz at once, and to create strong tribal force. For the latter purpose money is required, and I understand that it is proposed to ask the two Governments to make an advance of 200,0001 each under the special circumstances. I have advised Persian Government that they would do well to seek money required for the Azerbaijan force elsewhere. I added that I am well aware that Russia is most desirous not to quarrel with Turkey, but that it appeared to me hardly leason- able to expect her to withdraw her troops and also find money to pay foi a force to replace them. I suggested that perhaps the financial agreement sketched in my immediately preceding telegram might afford basis for obtaining money if the Imperial Bank of Persia could be persuaded to waive its claim to immediate reimbursement and agreed to transfer loan to some other security. Maliat collected by Russian consuls might also perhaps amount to useful sum. , , . ^ As I rather from my Russian colleague that his Government is most anxious to avoid war with Turkey, in order not to raise Eastern question which might be accompanied by complications in Balkans, it has appeared to me desirable to rendei ail the assistance that I could in the furtherance of peace. _ Persian Government have so far behaved most Loyally in calming public excitement and in throwing cold water upon Turkish and German incitements to Persians to join in a holy war against Russia.

On his refusal fortress was bombarded for eight hours. The hostile Kurds lost twenty killed, many wounded. Russian troops lost three killed and eight wounded. Kurds escaped by night. Turkish troops have occupied two villages of Sonai which were awarded to Persia by Commission. Their movements in vicinity of frontier are aggressive, and what with this and with vagaries of Russian military authorities, further incidents are likely. “ Russian consul informs me that disturbances have taken place at Urmia and also at Sujbulak.” IfT/ 931 — 1375 ]Register No. ^-A X ^ ^ Minute Paper. 3$'7 6 Secret Department/ Dated Dec. . 19lQr Date.

Viceroy of India Has repeated to me, under date 30th August, official communique which it is proposed to publish in the event of a declaration of war between Great Britain and Turkey being imminent. I read text of declaration to my Russian colleague and my French colleague yesterday for their confidential information and as there is considerable talk in Tehran about Turco-British relations at present and mucn bellicose nonsense is indulged in by young Chauvinists, I took occasion of visits that Imam Juma and the Prios Minister paid me yesterday afternoon to explain that^ Turkey's action respecting the 'Goeben and Breslau had been most improper and that our relations are some what strained in consequence. I urged upon both that steps should be taken to put a stop to expressions of open hostility to Great Britain and her allies, and I especially impressed on the former that he should use influence to check any tendency which might be displayed towards a religious demonstration. I also suggested that Ulemas of Kerbela and Nejef mighu be warned not to encourage hostility to Great Britain and her allies. me Imam promised to do as I aeked, tut assured me that people realised fully all that Hia Majesty's GovernmentGovernment tiave Gone for Persia and that there is no danger of a display on their part of serious hostility. The Prime Minisuer said that where religion is con cerned, one can never answer unreservedly for a people, hut he assured me that even if the worst were to happen the Persian Government would observe strict neutrality and he promised to take all necessary measures to curb any attempt at a demonstration. He added confidentially that were it a question only of hostilities between Great Britain and Turkey, we could count on finding Persia's sympathies (all, he added deprecatingly, she had been left to fight.with) on our side, but he could not conceal from me that so great is hatred for Russia in Persia that he could not promise more than neutrality now that politico.! considerations have caused us to fight side by side. At my instigation, the Russian and French Ministers are warning Russian and Swedish officers of Cossack brigade and gendarmerie respectively to be prepared lor a possible anti-Christian outbreak in fostering of which, perhaps without counting the cost, German agents are busy by propagating ail sorts of lying stories about German successes. I do not anticipate smallest trouble, but in a country like Persia forewarned is forearmed -</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000175_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/478</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000175</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/478</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 3516/1914 Pt 1 'German War: Persian attitude towards Turkey'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1914/1915</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-21T22:14:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (164 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 164; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
