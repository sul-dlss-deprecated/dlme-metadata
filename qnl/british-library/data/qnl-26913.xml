Pol.Sxt.16380/48 LETTER Sir Rupert Hay, KCIK., CSI., fjahrein. V(/ould you please refer to your D*0* letter Lo.17(35/202) of 19th April about the tluscat Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and i&lt;avigation« 2* ith regard to the general question of the succession by the dominions of India and Pakistan to the Treaty rights and obligations of the former Oovemment of India, the United iCingdom Government * s views may for your own background information be summarie ed as follows* The present dominion of India continues the international personality of the former India and has succeeded as a matter of international law to the latter’s membership of U.li*0. and all other existing international organisations and specialised agencies.in which India artidpated before the 14th August 1947* It is for Pakistan to take the necessary steps to gain admittance to these bodies in her own right, and in this she will have the support of the United Kingdom government* Similarly as regards international rights and obligations, the United Kingdom Government's view is that the present dominion of India hi s prima facie inherited all the former India's n international obligations, and is entitled to claim the rights and advantages associated therewith. The position is, /however 4however, cowplicated by the Tact that the former India has not continued in a unitary form. The nev. dominion of India clearly cannot be bound in international law by obligations which can only be carried out in territory which is not under her effective control, nor can she claim the reciprocal benefits associated with those obligations. Certai; of those obligations, (for example, those relating to frontiers) run with the land and consequently pass by automatic operation of law to whatever successor authority becomes sovereign authority in the territory to which the obligations attach. Other Treaty provisions which equally cannot be performed in the new India, but which have application to the territory and inhabitants of Pakistan will not automatically pass. It is, however, open to Pakistan to secure the continued application to her of these Treaty provisions by accepting the obligations and claiming the benefits of them, and thus establishing herself in a position corresponding to that of the new Indio There are also other Treaties, multi-lateral and bi-lateral, having no localised application whidi India has inherited, but which will not pass to Pakistan, in regard to which arrangements need to bs made so that Pakistan can assume the position of an independent party in regard to them. 3. The above, as I have said, represents the Onited ..ingdom Government’s view of the general position. The Governor-General of India on the 14th iiugust, 1947, made an order entitled the Tn^or) /IndependenceIndependence (International Arrangements) Order 1947, of which a copy is enclosed, purporting to register an agreement between the Governments of India and Pakistan which would determine their action in the international field. The Order itself, we are advised, has no force in international law; it has legal force only as between the two Dominions and is not binding upon any foreign Government. It gave legislative force y in the municipal law of India and Pakistan to an agreement between the two countries. Its value in international law is merely as a declaration of the intentions, so far as they themselves are concerned, of the Governments of India and Pakistan plus such statue as it may acquire internationally by general consent, whether expressed or implied. The two Governments, however, have recently shown a disposition to adopt the view that their position as regards international agreements and organisations has been regularised once and for all by that Order and that they are entitled vis-a-vis other countries to rest their cases upon it. This is a matter of some delicacy for the United Kingdom Government, since we do not wish to become embroiled in wrangles between the two Governments on matters of succession, nor do we wish to get into the position of either seeming, or accepting liability, to give publicly any interpretation of the Order or any views on the question of succession. The Commonwealth /RelationsRelatione Office recently wrote to tlie United Kingdom High Coraaiaeioner in Pakistan (Garter* a letter to crafftey-Smith of 11th June) setting out the position on the above lines, and asking him to be guided by it if opportunities occurred to get these points discreetly into the head of the Pakistan Government* 4. We have thought it best to set this out at some length. I now turn to the particular case of the uecat Treaty of 1939* Go far as India is concerned, the view of the U n ited Kingdom Government is, for the reasons explained above, that the Treaty is definitely binding in respect of the Dominion of India. As regards Pakistan, the Muscat Treaty does not appear to contain any obligations of the type which run with the land and which therefore automatically pass to Pakistan. If Pakistan decides to accede to the Treaty there is no difficulty. If, however, she claims to be a party to the Treaty by succession, it will rest with the Sultan, not with us, to decide whether to admit that claim. You will 'be aware that the Cctffinonwealth Relations Office wrote to the Government of Pakistan on 16th September 1947, suggesting that the Government of Pakistan might examine the i.uscat Treaty of 1939 and inform the United Kingdom Government in due course of the attitude they wished to adopt when the Sultan raised the question of this Treat *s application to Pakistan The views of the Pakistan Government have not ^et been recel/od, and a reminder is being sentto them. Meanwhile f we feel that it would be better to delay replying to the Sultan, at least ineofar as the position of Pakistan is concerned and preferably as regards Indian position too. 5. At the same time, hov/ever, there is no question whatever but that the provisions of the Treaty applicable to nationals of His Majesty and British ships and aircraft (as defined in -article I of the Treaty) apply to the nationals, ships and aircraft of Pakistan so long as she reitiains in the Consaonwealth, and the viev/s set out above in regard to Pakistan's position in international law as regards succession to Treaties, etc. should not be allowed in any way to derogate from the rights which persons, ships and aircraft of Pakistan domicile or registration enjoy as nationals of II.U., British vessels or British aircraft. This means, inter alia, that the important Articles 13-16 dealing with Jurisdiction will continue to apply to Pakistan nationals qua nationals of His Majesty. There is no objection to this being made clear to the Sultan, as a separate issue from thiB question of India's and Pakistan's succeseion to the Treaty, if at any time the necessity arises. 6. Copies of this letter and yours under reply^ are being sent to the United Kingdom High Commissioners in India and Paidstan.y V. lH^-'l-POafelGN OFFICE, S.w.l ( 3 ) (T 8679/68/378) 19th June, 1957 V&gt; Dear Clauson, With reference to your letter P.Z.1534/37 of the 31st M.rch to Brenan I enclose a copy of a letter from McAlpine at the Home Office regarding the case of Yusuf Nassar. We agree that for some purposes (diplomatic and consular protection) Muscatis should he regarded as British protected persons, and if Yusuf Nassar is a native of Muscat - as to v/hich McAlpine says the High Commissioner for India is making enquiries - we think that a certificate of nationality might he issued to him describing him as 'Subject of the Sultan of 'Muscat and Cman - British protected person.'

Dear Dunlop, Please excuse my delay in answering your letter of the 8th April in v/hich you asked for our observations on the case of Yusuf Nassar, the Muscat! in South Shields who is applying for the grant of a Seaman’s Certificate of Identity. Our previous papers were at India House and we were held up some time for lack of them. In our view, Yusuf Nassar is an alien until he is deemed otherwise. If you therefore decide that Muscat may be treated as a British Protectorate and if it is a fact that he was oorn there (this, I understand, the High Corrrnissioner for India is investigating at the moment) we should grant him his certificate as a British Protected Person. The decision seems to me to rest with you. In reply to your enquiry about the man’s passport, the enclosed copy of a police report will I think, give you all the information you need. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) C.B.MCALPINE. W.L.Dunlop, Esq., O.B.E.Chief Constable’s Office, South Shields, Your ref. N.1856/2. 28th May, 1937. Jay ref. ARO.1/291. Yusuf NASSAR - R.C. 251411 - 22, East Holborn South Shields . I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, together with enclosure regarding the above named. I have caused Nassar to be seen and he informed one of my Officers that the letter to the Home Office dated 15th November, 1936, was written on his behalf by Said Hassan, 33, Great George Square, Liverpool, ana that he meant to imj^ly that he had applied for a .Passport eight months previously; also, that he had been informed by the Police that he was not a British Subject. He further stated that he has never held a Passport, and there is no record at this Office of one having been issued to him. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed)Alex I). VUlson.

Home Office, Whitehall, London, S.U. 1.131S4/37 dated k5th Febi»u©ry My dear Brem n # y m may remember tliat I vTrote to you on the 11th December last, No. .2.8383/36 9 about a .-uacati called Yusuf Nasser who had applied in this country for a seaman’s certificate of nationality. I now enclose a copy of e letter from Adams of the Hi^h Commissioner’s Office? which summarises the case, points out tiiat there is no use in the High Commissioner for Indie issuing a Certificate of Nati nality unless the recipient is a British protected person, and asks whether iuscatis are, or are not, British protected persons. Muscat is undoubtedly an indeoendent sovereign State, and His Majesty’s overment have no ri Lt by treaty to control its internal administration or its foreign relatione. Actually His Majesty’s Government is the only power maintaining a Consular Officer at try in practice to t iusct?tfftd bb’' f 6 ’i rKJBeftrld ve NO. 26 1 JUL 1937 T.V.Brenan, Bsc, oIbVb., ^ GRETARY « POLITrOAL AND Foreign Office. SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFI QB treat/2. treat Unseat as a protected State like Bahrein, Koweit, etc. But v/e have to avoid doing so in theory: for instance, in the recent case of the dhow, thought to be Muscat1, wh ch was arrested by the Persian Government, we were careful to instruct Hi a Majesty's Minister at Tehran tl at if any for-rial representations were to be made to the Persian Government, it would be desirable to obtain special authority from the Sultan of Muscat to act on his behalf. Similarly, in regard to air navigation in uscat territory we took care to get the sultan to ask us to be his agents for communicating with the French and Dutch Governments. On the other hand, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is included in the Annexe to Chapter XXII of Consular Instructions, which purports to give the States whose subjects are British Protected Persons. Again, it may be relevant to refer to Beckett's note of the 15th Pay, 1935, &gt;f which a copy was sent to Laithwaite under cover of Hendel's letter of 18th July, 1935, io.E.3400/3400/91. Beckett said that he had no reason to dissent from the view that ^or the/■mmmmmsmmmmam 3. the puri^osee of jurisdiction in atar v/e rahould regard natives of Muscat as British protected arsons and not as foreigners, nationals of a Moslem 3tate» This seens to mean that, while huscat is a completely independent Btate, Musoatis may for some purposes he regarded as British Protected lersons; and, if this is so, it might possibly be open to us to say that for the purpose of receiving seamen* s Certificates of Nationality v/e might regard Muscatis as British Protected Persons, and thus enable them to obtain employ ;ent in British ships in the same way as Kowoitis, Bahreinis, denis, etc* I am afraid I have held up Adams* letter for some little time owing to pressure of work, and I should be grateful if you could let me have the Foreign Office views as so&gt;n as conveniently possible* It seems desirable, however, that we should get a considered view and be able to settle the point once and for all* Yours sincerely.

There is, however, no point in our issuing a certificate unless we can describe the holder either as a British subject or as a British protected person. A certificate in British subject form would exempt him from registration under the coloured Alien Seamen’s Order^and render him eligible for engagement for sea employment: it would also put him in the first category of those to be employed under the Shipping Subsidy Rules. A certificate in British protected person form would not exempt him from registration, but the holder of such a certificate is normally permitted to register and he then becomes eligible for engagement for sea employment: he also comes within the scope of the Shipping Subsidy Rules.INDIA HOUSE, TELEPHONE * TEMPLE BAR 8484 ALDWYCH, LONDON, W.C.2. ^ A coloured seaman who holds neither certificate would rank as an alien for all purposes. He would not be eligible for sea employment unless the Home Office permitted him to register under the C.A.S* Order (a course not normally allowed to new-comers), and a ship wishing to qualify for the subsidy could not engage him except in special circumstances. 3* We now have an application for a special seaman's certificate of nationality in which the applicant has been definitely certified to be a Muscat subject.

Ho, I16-S of 1936* Bushire, ohe I3i;h February 1936 Lily dear Glaus on, Gould you please refer to the last two sentences oi paragraph 1 of your demi-official letter Bo, P.3, 7185/35, dated the 14th October 1935, on the juridical position of subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf vis-a-vis the Rulers of other similar States. 2* The position can be summarised as follows:- A. Bahrain . (1) Subjects of other Arab States in the Gulf are juridically treated as British protected persons, i.e. they come under the Political Agent not the Shaikh. It would appear that when the Political Agent issued the notice reierred to in paragraph 2 of India Office letter Bo. P.Z. 7185 covering all ioreign subjects, it should presumably only have covered Qataris and Nejdis (Saudi subjects). But, as in practice, jurisdiction over foreign subjects and British protected persons has been exercised for many years by the Political Agent without any objection from the present Shaikh, there would hardly seem any necessity now to raise the question of our right to this jurisdiction. (2) Subjects oi Kuwait, Muscat, ^atar, and Trucial Sheikhdoms are not registered as British protected persons, because for the purposes of registration, as opposed to jurisdiction, they have not been regarded as 'British subjects', although the term includes British protected persons (see Article M.J. Glauson Msquire, The India Office London. 2/£ (1) of '“file Bahrain (Amendment) Order in Council, 1922' and in the definition in Article 4 of 'The Bahrain Order in Council, \ 1913'). As far as I am aware, no person in these categories has ever asked to be registered as a British protected person, though they come under the Political Agent if involved in civil or criminal proceedings, B. Kuwait. Individuals in question are not treated as British protected persons i.e, they come under the Shaikh not the Political Agent - vide Dickson's telegram No. 295 of 7th October 1935 to me, repeated to Secretary of otate for India under his No. 296. C. Muscat . Individuals in question are treated as British protected persons i.e. they come un^er the Political Agent not the Sultan. 3.
