Cotton Way, First Assistant to the Political Resident Persian Gulf concerning a washed-up buoy and connecting the Chief of Abu Dhabi with the island.Correspondence discusses Germany negotiating with the Porte for acquisition of a coaling station even though the island did not seem suitable for this purpose.
