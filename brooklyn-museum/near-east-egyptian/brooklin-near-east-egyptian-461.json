The Apis bull was a manifestation of the god Ptah and an intermediary for that god as well, thus endowed with oracular powers. At the death of an Apis bull, the underground burial chambers where his mummy would be interred were opened for a period of seventy days. During that time, private individuals would erect stelae and leave votive offerings for the deceased bull, asking for benefits like good health and longevity for themselves and their kin. This bronze is quite likely such a votive. </p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 752, "title": "Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "05.367_SL3.jpg", "id": 166732, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/05.367_SL3.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/05.367_SL3.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 75}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 151}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 303}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 607}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1214}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/05.367_SL3.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "scanned from casted transp; inaccurate color", "caption": " <em>Apis Bull</em>, 381-343 B.C.E.
