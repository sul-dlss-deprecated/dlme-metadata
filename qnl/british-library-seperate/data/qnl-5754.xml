They contain a record of current local events, news and information and were regularly submitted by the Aden Resident to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department at Delhi, who then circulated them to the India Office and Foreign Office in London. The newsletters contain information about Turkish troop movements in Yemen; the changing relations and frequent outbreaks of hostilities between the numerous Yemeni tribal chiefs and in particular, the state of their allegiance to either the occupying Ottoman Turks or the British Government, identifying them accordingly as either Turkish or British stipendiary shaikhs. Included in the Resident’s reports are the sources of his information: shaikhs, officials, merchants, traders and travellers visiting or writing to him at Aden, as well as news received from the British Assistant Resident stationed on Perim Island.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ottoman Empire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000bb#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000bb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
