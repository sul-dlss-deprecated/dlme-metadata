The ruling stipulated that compensation for violations of the Maritime Truce should be paid direct to the injured party, but the Shaikh is arguing that as he is responsible for his own subjects that payments should be conducted through him.It contains an argument from the Resident that the ruling may in fact cause the British more embarrassment than it delivers in benefits, and recommends that the Resident is left to be guided by the circumstances of each case.The item has three enclosures, arranged in reverse order:1. List of compensation payments for violations of the Maritime Truce between 1841 and 1851 (Enclosure No. 3).2. Translation of a letter from Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur [sic], Chief of Rasel Khymah [Ra's al-Khaymah] to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 30 September 1852 (Enclosure No. 2).The enclosure expresses the Shaikh's disagreement with the Court of Director's ruling that compensation payments should go direct to the injured party. It questions how compensation can be effectively arranged without reference to subject's rulers.3. Translation of a letter from Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur [sic], Chief of Rasel Khymah [Ra's al-Khaymah] to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 30 September 1852 (Enclosure No. 1).The enclosure expresses the Shaikh's willingness to allow the terms of the Maritime Truce to remain in force, and also that he is in favour of the truce being renewed, or a lasting peace established. However, he mentions that he has an issue with the idea that compensation payments are to be made with no reference to the ruler.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000011#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
