He adds that it will be possible to regain possession of Hasa amicably in ala a few months. The purport of this telegram, so little in harmony with the result of the recent negotiations between the Turks and Bin Sa’ud at Kuwait, is believed to be due to the inspiration of Saiyid Talib, who is said to have telegraphed to Constantinople in a similar sense. It is certain that the Vali is strongly influenced by Saiyid Talib, and that, being a man of indolent character, any suggestion involving the post ponement of a difficult question would be welcome toTelegram - P, / t i From The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla , To The Political Resident in the Persian Gnlf, B n a h i r e .

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Basra, reporting that troubles are brewing on the Tigris and Euphrates, and as to relations between the Vali, Bin Reshid, and Bin Sand. 1 have, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir L. Mallet. (No. 32.) Sir, Basi'a, May 16, 1914. I LEARN privately that during the recent meeting which took place between the Vali and Bin Reshid the Vali asked the Amir whether, if necessary, he was in a position to reconquer Hasa and restore it to the Turks. Bin Reshid is said to have professed his willingness to do so, and to have stated that he merely required the co-operation of 200 Turkish soldiers for the purpose. It is reported here that Bin Sand has intimated to Bin Reshid and Ajeymi-es-Sadun that he is no longer their friend, and that he will take hostile measures against them. I am informed that, when the Turkish Commission met Bin Saud at Koweit, the Mutessarif of Hasa presented the latter with a letter from Enver Pasha, together with a revolver and a Korau. The letter requested Bin Saud to restore Hasa to the Ottoman Government. Bin Saud, in reply, is reported to have sent Enver Pasha his own dagger, and to have informed the Commission that El Hasa Was his property, and therefore he could not hand it over to the Turks, as he was the Amir of Nejd. There seems to be trouble brewing on the Tigris, and I hear that Sheikh Ghadban- el-Benaiyah of the Beni Lam is lighting with Fahid-el-Ghadban and Juwai between Amara and Ali-el-Gharbi. Arab activity was noticeable in that part of the river when the “ Blosse Lynch ” with Mr. Bullard on board passed down this week. The Arabs were assembling and shouting their “ hosa ” or war cry, and a number of corpses of persons who had presumably fallen in a recent affray were seen stretched on the bank in charge of a caretaker. Trouble is also reported on the Euphrates, and Shattra-el-Muntific, which is occupied by a Turkish garrison, is said to be besieged by x\rabs of the Senajir section of the Abuda tribes. Disturbances are also reported at Suk-es-Shiyukh and Nasrieh. A force of soldiers, gendarmes, and some artillery left Basra with the commandant of gendarmerie on the 14th instant for Shattra-el-Muntific. I am informed that Ajeymi-bin-Saidun, who is naturally incensed at the Vali’s treatment of his relatives, as reported in my despatch No. 29 of the 9th instant, is collecting his tribes with the intention of attacking Zobeir and Basra. The population of Zobeir are said to be under arms. The great part of them favour Ajeymi. There is some agitation among the inhabitants of Basra in consequence. The mudir of police, Behij Bey, who apparently took it on himself to criticise the action of the Vali in sundry matters of local interest, and reported unfavourably on his Excellency’s conduct of affairs to the Vali of Bagdad and Constantinople, has been summarily dismissed by the Vali from his post, and was deported to Bagdad by the steamship “ Mosul” on the 14th instant.

Camp Nakhl, Slnaitic Peninsula. ay., of An n S o About the beginning of January 1914 or perhaps even earlier the Turkish Government sent the following consign** ment of arms and ammunition to Ibn Rashid by the Hedjaz Railway from Damascus to the station on that line ( 1 think Tebuk) for Telmar, destined for Hail* 'Three railway-goods waggons full, said to contain 3 Mountain guns, breech-loaders, with 5GO rounds of shell (shrapnel) apiece, 30,000 rifles or carbines of Mauser or Mannlicher 5 shot magazine pattern with bayonets, with a whole waggon**ful of boxes of ammunition for these rifles (number not obtainable). These arms have not ell yet been transported to Hail, more than half of the consignment being reported to be still lying at Tebuk (?) and Teimar at the beginning of May. At the same time a motor-car was also sent by the Turkish Government to Hail in the charge of thrae Europeans (said to be Christians), by the same route. It is not improbable that the three men were artillerymen. Up to beginning of tay they were reported to be still at Hail. All responsible Arabs whom I met assured me that these arms were intended by the Turkish Government to strengthen Ibn Rashid*s hands for a war on Bin Baud - this intention I would add appeared to be no secret among the tribes to the north and east of Hail and I heard it confirmed hf.' several important Sheikhs likely to be in a position to know. It was also rumoured that the Turkish Government intend to descend on Bin Baud from the Periian Gulf after he has been thoroughly well engaged by Ibn Rashid in QaBim. Gn the face of it this would undoubtedly X be the best policy for the Turks to pursue if they do really contemplate theretaking of the Hasa province. l urMsh anissary to hail It was reported that a high officer of the Turkish Government with special and secret orders and despatched dir ct from the Central Government and Constantinople, travelled hy rail to Tehuk (?), the station for Teimar, and thence to Haile On arrival at Hail he found that Ihn Rashid was away in the northern desert near Samawah or Abu Ghar and consequently after a belt of three days, the high officer left by the direct route for Baghdad* It is said that he was at Hail during the last week of Karch or early in April* This officers visit is also said to have been connected with the expected attack on Bin Baud* He is described as a very fair man and a Christian, sent specially by the Central Government* Lurder of Zmll Ibn Bebhari Hews was received by me in the vicinity of Haiyaniah (not on map) that on about the 10th April (regret that I have not the exact date at hand) Zamil ibn heblian, hitherto referred to (In Kuwait reports) as the guardian and maternal uncle of the young Amir Ibn Rashid (baud oin Abdul Aziz bin Meta'ab) together with Sebhan f his brother Ali and two sieves or sej^ants were murdered under the orders of the young Amir Rashid and Baud as^Saleh ibn Sebhan* The following details will serve to explain the circumstances and motive leading up to the crime* It will } be on record that after the Amir of Hail (Abdul Aziz bin Meta^b) had been killed in battle (about 190b I thluA.) ^4- Abdul Aziz 'Bin Baud' the ruling power at Hail was usurped by the sons of Hamud bin Obeid, who murdered all, young Ibn and old, belonging to the fetx Rashid family with the exception of a child, Seud bin Abdul Aziz bin Meta'ab, who escaped, having been secretly transported to Medina by Zamil ibn Sebhan his maternal uncle, Afetr some years inMedina during which the sons of Hamud bin Obeid quarrelled among themselves Zamil brought the boy back to Hail and established one again the rule of the Ibn Hashid family with himself as the guardain and ’de facto* ruler during the boy's minority and his cousin Saleh ibn Sebhan as Measurero Th$i^ rule endured until sometime in 1913 9 when the boy having reached man's estate (he is now about 20 years of age) Zamil ibn Sebhan withdrew from active government which passed into the hands of the young Amir* At the same time Zamil was much respected and liked by the whole Sharamar tribe for his just and generous rule, while the boy Amir is described as capricious and even perhaps not cuite sane. At all events the Shammar tribe, without whom the ruler of Hail is helpless, desired that Zamil should be definitely the Amir, This was naturally resented by the young Amir although Zamil had more than once refused the honour; the young Amir Saud bin Abdul Aziz had for his bosom friend Saud as^Saleh ibn Sebhan, a lad of his own age (about) and it appears that these two came to the conclusion that the only way in which to obtain the support of the entire Shammar tribe was to remove Zemil and, so to speak his cliaue. With this end in view ? one morning (about the 10th April) after Ibn Rashid had successfully raided the Thaffir and Badur tribes near Abu Ghar, a slave rode up behind Zamil and shot him in the back as all the Sheikhs were on the march to a new camp. Sebhan and All (brother of Zarail) seeing whet had happened jumped on to their mares and fled, but were rounded up with their slaves by other slaves of Ibn Rashid's entourage s brought back and cut down with swords. Meanwhile it is reported, that Baud bin Abdul Aziz the Amir and Saud as-Saleh went on riding without taking any particular notice of the tragedy being enacted. The crime was execrated by every Arab whom I met and it was considered impuobable that the Shammar tribe would follow the young Amir after it if any member of the Ibn Sefehan family chose to call upon themnot to do so* Ibn Rashid took the precaution of sending despatch riders to Rail to make sure of matters at the capital and it was from one of these that the details given above came to my knowledge. Arab opinion seemed to be unanimous that the day was not far distant when Bin Saud or his deputy would rule in At the seme time from all that I can gather it would seem that Bin Baud will have some difficulty in withstand ing an onslaught of all the Shammer, Harb and other tribes which follow Ibn Rashid, supplied as seems probable with modern magazine arms and if they can be brought to combine for any length of time under Ibn Rashid’s banner.

(June 23, 2*47 p.m.) FOLLOWING is a repetition of telegram No. 58 from consular officer at Basra :— “Bin Sand has accepted position of Vali and commandant of whole Nejd directly dependent on Constantinople. He acknowleges that he is Ottoman subject, and will hoist Ottoman flag. I understand that he will decide whether there shall be Turkish troops in his vilayet or not, but as to that and other conditions I hope to telegraph more fully in a few days. “ Sultan has telegraphed to Talib congratulating him on his success in this connection.” [600—429]7 \ 4 - 'i 1 Sir ArtHur Hirtzel, NOTE. i I J I have been through the papers which you were good enough to have sent to me and apparently som of the information which I sent to the political Resident at Bushire from Riadh has never reached Government -- the reasonnmay he that as I wrote to Mr Lorimer privately, the letter may have been destroyed on reaching Bushire some six weefcs after his death. I reached Riadh on the 0th March and found active preparations being made for the collection of a large fore by Bln Saudj I stayed and travelled with Bin Saud until the 15th and during this time had many opportunities of ascertaining his feelings and intentions. I would add tha being on exceptionally intimate terms with Abdul Aziz and his whole family he frequently showed me the confidential correspondence passing between him and other Arab Chiefs, amongst them Sayid Mahomed al-Idrisl, the Imam Yahyah of Sana’a, Bln Sha’alan the premier sheikh of the great Anai- -zeh tribe and others of lesser importance, as welll as his communications with the Turkish authorities. I did my best to discourage his confidences seeing that I had no official status, but as he insisted they may now be useful Bin Saud was aware of the advent of Turkish tro$ and the new wall of Basra, Suliman Pasha, in Riadh before I met him in March, and fearing that the troops were in- -tended for a descent on Katif, OJair and Hasa he had 1s- -sued orders for a general mobilization of his troopsd.e. townsmen and villagers as distinct from the nomad Bedouin, who do not count for much). This mobilization only called up a small proportion of the available fighting strength eff each village — some 30 per cent was my estimate after many enquiries— but even then Bln Saud had anything from 5000 to 7000 well-armed and mounted men ready to his hand. The military efficiency of Bin Saud’s^arrangements will be realizeda realized when it is understood that some of the villages are nearly 150 miles from Riadh, that the mobilization was practically complete within a fortnight, and that 1000 men were despatched and posted In the coast villages (particu- -larly Katif) within the first week. Bin Saud told me that he was forced to make these preparations as he could not risk allowing the Turkish troops to effect a landing on the coast unopposed. He in- 5 -tended no aggressive action but was determined on a vigor- -ous defence. He was exceedingly anxious as to what reply he would receive from the political Agent, Bahrain, to his 1st Babi-ath-Thani 1552 letter of the 26th February 1914 and what steps, if any, would be taken by H.M’s Government in the event of tie - - - - - Turkish troops making for the coast. My post ation did not permit of more than counselling patience , deprecating any hostile movement and suggesting that in aity- negotiations which might be attempted he should be careful to remember that he had given us (when he met Major Trevor and myself at Ojair in December) certain provisional as- -surances regarding the Trucial Chiefs and British traders on the coast. He said he had no intention of committing himself definitely to the Turks so long as he had any chance of arriving at an arrangement with the British Gov® -ment or at leastof obtaining our support or good offices in his negotiations with the Turks, but at the same time he could not wait indefinitely and continue to maintain a large force in the field; and, unless he could obtain some sort of assurance he would be compelled to make his own ar- f —rangements in order to obtain a temporary respite a^ sat from having to remain continually on guard. He told me then that the the two conditions upon which the Turks would certainly insist would be (a) the re-establishment of their former garrisons, and (b) the exclusion of ail foreigners, the former he would never agree to whatever happened, and thought that by accepting the latter he might be able to buybuy his desired respite, though he saw that such acceptance would probably close the door to any further negotiations with the British Government, much as he desired an under- -standing with them. The reports of the subsequent negoti- -ations in April near Kuwait show that Bin Saud has not wav -ered in his resolve, nor do I thin* that he will so long as he can fence with the Turlcs, and continues to cling to his hope of drawing H.M* s Government into any arrangement which he may make with the Porte. So much for Bln Baud’s own attitude, which I am con- -vlnced will not alter until he has despaired of obtaining the countenance or good offices of H H i£ , s Government in his efforts for an arrangement with the Turks. One reason and that the most cogent for Bin Baud’s determined attitude is that he feels himself strong enough to oppose the Turks especially if he can keep the other great Arab Sheikhs firm in their resolution not to permit any further aggression or encroachment in Arabia by the Turks. During the past year there has arisen a loose kind of confederation or alliance between the following Chiefs#! — Bin Saud, Imam Yahyah, Sayid Mahomed al-idrisl. Bin Sha’alan and the Sharif of Mecca, with only ibn Rashid the Shammar Chief left outside the coalition. The basis of tlB alliance is that the allied chiefs should endeavour to set- -tle their differences by agreement or arbitration as war between them only weakens all parties as againt the common enemy (viz: the Turks), that in the event of any aggression by the porte upon any one of these Sheikhs all should com- -blne for resistance and mutual help, ibn Rashid has been left out of the confederation because the present ruler is a boy who cannot be trusted, who is hand in glove with the Turks and has no real authority over his own tribesmen. Whether the Turkish Government is aware of this combination or not I do not know but I presume that it is for it has been at great pains to strengthen Ibn Rashid with arras and treasure within the last six months. Before I left Kuwait on4 on the 3rd February I had heard rumours of large consign- -ments of arms being despatched to Hail for ibm Rashid from Damascus; at Rladh Bin Saud told me that he had certain information to the same effect and that they must be inteid -ed by the Turkish Government for use ggainst himself; in the north-central desert the news was confirmed; and final- -ly I was informed in the vicinity of the Hedjaz Railway by Chiefs in jj^ositlon to 3aiow, that some 30r000 rifles (ail magazine arms of Mauser or Mannlicher pattern) with bayonets had been railed from Damascus to the station ( (? Tebuk) on the Hedjaz line for Teimah, that hundreds of boxes (accurate numbers were not obtainable) of ammunition accompanied the arms together with three breech-loading mountain guns (each said to be accompanied, I think, with some 500 shrapnel shell apiece) and that the consignment filled three large Railway w aggons; further that three Europeans ^ (probably European Turks) had taken a motor- -car by the same route to Hail at about the same time (i think in January) who might be artillerymen for the moun- -tain guns, in the northern desert it was common report thfct these arms were intended for Ibn Rashid and that he would probably make a move against Bin Saud within the yefr'u — » perhaps in the autumn. Bin Saud may have received accurate information later of the quantities and description of arms and of the plans concerted between Ibn Rashid and the Turks and it is some such knowledge I think which probably accounted for his uncompromising and somewhat truculent attitude at Kuwait towards the Turkish deputation sent to Interview him. It is action of this kind in the face of correspondence of tte description reported by the Political Agent at Kuwait in April which causes Bin Saud to view any Turkish proposal with the greatest suspicion. From all that I heard throughout Central Arabia I feel convinced that the old methods of Turkish intrigue. o5 of setting up one Arab Sheifch against another, will no long -er have the success of past times in maintaining even that shadowy semblance of Turkish sovereignty over them which has hitherto passed unquestioned; throughout the country I was struck by the contempt with which the Arabs all re- -garded the Turkish Government, its troops and its civil officials. In attempting to show of what little account in fail Arabia Turkish authority really is I am only en- -deavouring to explain that present Turkish methods invite further disasters. I am aware that His Majesty’s Government are com -mitted to a policy of supporting and maintaining a strong Turkey in Asia and such a desirable result can be brougit about in Arabia so much the better. Unfortunately the Turkish Government appears to have no conception of its ovn weakness in Arabia, nor of the power and strength of the Arab Chiefs, nor does it appear to realize what are the probable consequences likely to ensue should forcible raea- -flures have to be resorted to in the end. The reports from Kuwait ^describing the course of the negotiations with Bin Baud I think sufficiently bear out the above view. The nearest parallel to the Turkish difficulties with Bln Baud which I can draw is our own case in Somaliland only exagg^ri. -ated ten times worse. Knowing something of the country, its difficulties in transport, supplies and the like#/, I would hesitate to suggest that less than two divisions , completely equipped for a long desert war,, would be able maintain to re-establish and/effectively the former Turkish occupa- -tion of the Hasa provinee. The Turkish occupation before May 1913 was not effective in any sense and only existed because Bin Saud was/more occupied elsewhere; he could havs carried out his coup of May 1913 at any time in the last five years. So far as my limited knowledge goes_, the Turkish Government does not appear to be in aposltlon at present to undertake6 undent alee any sxpedltions in Arabia, nor indeed for many years to come* it must also be remembered tbat any future campaign against one ShelKh is exceedingly lively to raise the whole of Arabia against the Turks* It may be argued that the Arab tribes have not the necessary cohesion to ^ maintain for any length of time a united front against the Porte. To a certain extent this is true but at the present moment years of falsehood. Intrigue and oppression on the part of Turkish officials combined with the disastrous loss of Turkish prestige resuitling from the Tripoli and Balkan wars have had their effect. Moreover the Arabs have now found a leader (Bin Saud) who stands head and shoulders above any other chief and in whose star all have implicit faith. The other sheikhs of the Arab alliance refer all kinds of matters to Bin Saud for his advice, more especial- -ly those affecting their relations with the Porte. I am convinced that present Turkish methods in Arabia, if persisted in,will end in disaster— Turkey has not the power to coerce Arabia and should matters, with Bln Saud in regard to the Hasa province for instance^ come to a head, the probable result will be a combination of all the Arab tribes , the expulsion of Turkish troops and officials from the Hedjaz, Yemen and Asir and the establishment of aa independent Arabia with a loose form of confederation of which Bin Saud will be the head, while the holy cities of Mecca and Medina will pass under the absolute rule of the Sharif^ family with the consent of Bin Saud. I admit that it is always rash to prophesy but I have hoard the subject discussed so often in Arabia on these lines and by so many widely separated Chiefs that I cannot avoid the conclusion that the Turkish Government is at present riding for a veiy bad fall in its present Arabian policy. If the British policy of a strong Turkey is ever to be realized in Asia the Porte must be convinced of its mistake#, however unpalatable the process may be. The only solution/ ^ 60 7 solution which I can see Is a radical change on the part of the Porte towards a more straightforward and honest pol- -cy with the important Sheifch©,#/ Most of them are quite willing to accept Turkish suzerainty so long as it is one only in name and does not import meddling in their affairs. In the case of Bin Saud for Instance —all he desires is to he left alone as the ruler of Nejd, which he is now in fact allowed to collect his own taxes and customs and to admlnis -ter the Shara f a Law in the old time-honoured way, if the Porte would nominate him Mutaserif or Wall of Nejd on these conditions he would he willing to pay it a nominal tribute in a lump sum per annum and I feel sure would loyally keep his part of the bargain as a Turkish vassal. He has no am- -hitions to become the Khalif of Arabia, and though his com -mending influence will no doubt lead all the other chiefs more or lessduring his lifetime I do not think he would ev® embark on a campaign to set himself up as sultan of all Arabia , It may be $ 9 ^$ said that any solution on the lines suggested above will leave the whole of Arabia open to the exploitation of Foreign powers. Great and otherwise. At present no Great Power has any real interests in Arabia with the exception of Great Britain, whose interests are $ confined to the coast-line, though I believe Italy is said to be trying to develops interests in Asir or Yemen. The discussion of this aspect of the subject requires more aco* -curate and more extensive knowledge of^recent events than! is available to me| therefore it is with diffidence that I venture to suggest for consideration that with^ the port© recognized and supported by His Majesty’s Government as the Suzerain Power in Arabia and provided that the Turkish Gov- -emment dealt frankly with H.M's Government in matters regarding Arabia no Foreign Power would find it an easy proposition to make good a footing in the country, especial -ly as8 ' i apart from the fact that along nearly the whole littoral British influence is paramount and of very considerable account even in those portions actually administered at the moment by Turkey. To sum up, the difficulties of the problem in Arabia are:— (a) The utter inability of the Porte to coerce Arabia at present or for many years to come. (b) The strong position in a military and geographical sense with which Nature has endowed the Arabs. (c) The probable coalition of ail Arab tribes in the event of attempted coercion. (d) The desire of H.M’s Government to promote a strong Turkey in Asia without detriment to legitimate British interests. The remedies so far as I can venture to suggest them seem to be:— (1) The acceptance by the Porte of the de facto in- -dependent status of the gre,t Sheikhs whilst mai -talning a nominal suzerainty. (2) A franker and more honest attitude by the Porte towards the great Sheikhs. (3) Less suspicion on the part of the Porte towards British policy in Arabia with recognition of the special position which Great Britain there enjoys (4) A frank Invitation by the Porte for British co-op -eration in Arabian affairs. 26.6.1914NOTE CUr*. Sir Arthur Hlrtzel, In the papers you had sent to me and also in others which came to me officially in Kuwait I have notic- that Sayid Talib of Basra seems to be regarded as a ♦deus ex machina 1 or solver of all local ills in Arabia and Meso- -potaraia* I cannot understand how he has acquired this MW position , or rather he has managed to maintain it in the reports of our own officers. The man is a strong,wilful, utterly unscrupulous djt character usually heavily in debt and consequently import- -unate . He has a dozen or more murders to his credit &amp; holds Basra in the hollow of his hand by means of a band of armed men who occupy his house there liKe a fort, issu- -ing thence to execute their masters behests in the mat- -ter of replenishing his exchequer when required. No wall at Basra is ever able to carry on his ad- -ministrative worfc: unless he first agrees to be the willln? tool of Sayid Talib. Bln Saud , SheiXh Mubaralt, and Sheifch Khazal all subsidise him with a regular monthly or annual salary sole- -ly to protect themselves from continual extravagant deraanis acompanied by threats. Not one of these Chiefs however would trust Sayid Talib with any negotiation on their wwn behalf. Sayid Talib generally induces the Central Govem- -ment to depute him as their envoy fnr the solution of their difficulties in Mesopotamia, the local Wall generally being his strongest supporter for the simple reason that unless sayid Talib is allowed some of the pickings always available on these occasions, matters usually come to a deadlock through his instrumentality. 26.6.1914—m mriii im From , n'i'X LLyiol $o• 1494 of 1914.

In continuation of my letter No. C.—16, dated 29th April, I have the honour to report further on the subject of Bin Sand and the Turkish Govern ment. , 2 . As stated in my last letter, the Turkish deputation headed by Saiyid Talib, son of tue Nakib ot Basrah and Enclosure No. 2 . Saiyid Umar Pauzi Beg, Chief of the Stall at Basrah, arrived in Kuwait on the 29th ultimo in Shaikh Sir Mubarak’s launch “ Mishrif ” which had been placed at their disposal. The same day the Order of the Osmanieh was presented to Shaikh Sir Mubarak without ceremony and in the presence of a few persons only. During the morning of the 30th idem the Shaikh sent for my Agency Mulla and asked him to let me know that the deputation were pressing him to accompany them on the occasion of their visit to Bin Sand. I replied through the Mulla that, as I had already informed him. His Majesty’s Government had no objection to his good offices being afforded to assist in the negotiations; and, to put his mind at rest, addressed to him the official letter which forms enclosure (1) to this report. The Shaikh replied to me the following day as given in enclosure (2). 3. During the whole of 30th April and 1st May the deputation were engaged in discussing the terms which were to be put before Bin Sand, and om the morning of the 2nd instant they proceeded to Subaihiyah whence they returned on the 4th. , 4. I called on Sir Mubarak yesterday and he informed me of what had taken place. His version, which is confirmed generally by reports which^ have reached me from other sources, is probably substantially correct. The Turks first announced to Bin Saud their scheme for settlement, which was that he must first of all accept the reposting of Turkish garrisons in Katif and U jair and their reinforcement by additional posts in Hassa: that all the forts in Uiair and Hassa must be surrendered to them ; that all cannon and small arms captured must be made over to the Turkish troops; and that he is to have no connection whatever with any foreigners or foreign Power. In return for these conditions they agreed to recognise his autonomy ; to allow him to collect all taxes, &amp;c., and to give him verbal, though not written, per mission to retake Katar and Trucial Oman when he chose Bin fcaud s scheme was then stated to them; it was that he should retain Katif, Ujair, and Hassa under Turkish suzerainty: should pay them £T3,000 per annum as tribute money and should be at the disposal of Turkey, with his men, m the event of armed assistance being required. The subsequent discussions turned upon the reinstatement of the Turkish garrisons : the deputation insisted upon this condition and Bin Saud refused to give way. After some time harsh words passed between him and Saiyid Umar, the latter was rash enough to say that if Bin Saud would not accept this condition he would be compelled to do so, whereupon the Amir started up and half drawing his sword ordered Saiyid Umar to leave the assembly, and any possibility of successful negotia-ions an nears to have been at an end from that moment. The Turkish deputation returned to Basrah in the Shaikh’s launch on the night of the 4th instant, and are to report^ Gonstantinople the failure of their negotiations. India, Fonek No 2 1 .ut ECffETARY’3 dated ;v1 A.Y 19142 5. Sir Mubarak lias from time to time made to me explanations of his position in connection with this matter, and summed them up during our interview yesterday. He regrets not having been able to accept the invitation of His Majesty’s Government to take part in the negotiations, but informs me that in any case nothing could have induced Bin Saud to accept the condition regarding the return of Turkish troops to what he regards as his ancestral domains. He adds moreover that he has had experience of the Turks all his life, and that he cannot seriously urge Bin Saud to submit to them without a guarantee from us. In regard to the Turkish deputation he felt obliged to assist Saiyid Umar Fauzi Beg to a certain extent, first because he was the representative of a foreign Power with whom his relations are friendly, secondly, because he was his guest on the occasion of his visit to Kuwait, and thirdly, because of the friendship which exists between himself and Saivid Umar’s father. He did not want the Yali of Basrah in Kuwait as it might have been difficult to refuse to him that which he could decline to do for Saiyid Talib, and he had felt all along that he could not help in the negotia tions. I received in silence this statement, with part of which at least it was impossible not to feel sympathy. 6.

But as to mediation between him and the Turkish Government, I must positively keep away from that and have informed the deputation accordingly.

Enclosure. Extract from a letter from F. E. Crow, Esq., C.M G.,1 His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, No. 28, dated the 2nd May 1914. As reported in my telegram 35 of 28th April Inst, the Commission appointed to effect a settlement of the Hasa question with Bin Saud left Basrah in the Shaikh of Kuwait’s launch for Kuwait on the morning of the 28th ultimo. The Commission consisting of Saiyid Talib Bey Naqibzadah as President, Major Beha ad Din Bey, Chief of the Baghdad Staff, Major Omar Pauzi Bey, Chief of the Basrah Staff, who had previously visited Kuwait, and Sami Effendi Mutassarif of Hasa, was accompanied by Burner Bey, a Basrah lawyer. Muhammad al Nama, Arab notable and landed proprietor, and Abdul Wahab Mandil and Abdul Latif Mandil; the latter are Arab notables and landed proprietors and represent Bin Saud at Basrah as agents. I understand that the instructions to the Commission are to settle the question in a friendly way and that they \iill meet Bin Saud at Kuwait. Ihe 1st class of the Osmanieh has been conferred on Shaikh Mubarak by the Sultan and, as the decoration had not arrived at Basrah, an order was borrowed from Saiyid Talib Bey, presumably the same, and sent to the Shaikh by the hands of Barhan ad Din Bey, Public Prosecutor of the Basrah Appeal Court, and Hilmi Effendi, Director of Public Instruction. These gentlemen travelled with the Commission on board the Shaikh’s launch. On receipt of the decoration from Constantinople, it is to be handed to Saiyid Talib in return for the one he lent. The judicial authorities -were very loth to part with the Public Prosecutor, whose services are required in the Courts where much business awaits him. A letter addressed by the President of the Court to the Yali pointing out the inconvenience caused by the Public Prosecutor’s absence from his post and the consequent delay to the business of the courts was not well received and the Vali explained that it was only fair to the Public Prosecutor to give him the chance of making a little money. Some irritation seems to have been caused in the Serai by this observation.In any further communication on the subject, please quote 23753/14 Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. June 4th, 1914 J Sir Immolate. I am directed 'by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter P.2022 of the 27th. it ultimo on the subject of the relations of Sheikh Bin Saud of Nejd with the Ottoman Government. I am to state in reply that recent despatches from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople have impressed him with the importance of avoiding at this particular juncture any action of a nature likely to lend colour to the suspicions already strongly entertained at Constantinople that His Majesty’s Government are supporting Bin Baud’s policy of making himself indepen dent. It seems to him essential that His Majesty's Government should proceed very cautiously. The situation has been informally but carefully explained to Hakki Pasha, and it has been suggested by His Highness to his Government that he should be authorised to discuss the question here with the view The Under Secretary of State India Office.fs' (23753/14) ■ to a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at here. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey considers that nothing should he done until the result of Hakkl Pasha's suggestion is known. I am to add that point 'd' in the Viceroy's telegram of !'&amp;y 23rd. to which your letter calls special attention does not appear to Sir E. Grey to he open necessarily to the interpretation that the Turkish conditions definitely preclude any connexion or inter course between Bin Saud and foreigners: the condition would seem merely to provide that any communication between Bin Saud and foreign Powers or their agents should take place through the Ottoman authorities, - a view which appears to Sir E. Grey entirely correct, and one in regard to which His Majesty's Oovemrneno would not be justified in encouraging resistance on the part of Bln Saud, a Turkish subject, and specifically recognised as such by the Anglo-Turklsh Convention of July 29th, 1913. Sir E. Grey is, in fact, convinced that it would not be compatible with our engagements that Bin Saud should be treated otherwise, or that independent(23753/14) (Hi) independent communications with him should be held except in cases where they cannot he avoided; and he trusts that instructions in this sense will he issued. Prom a recent hut informal communication made hy Hakki Pasha, there appears to he little douht that the Ottoman Government are persuaded Bin Baud would come to terms with them were it not for British influence and the hope of British support. Sir F.. Grey fully recognises that arrangements must he made to protect British interests, hut only subject to the sovereign rights of Turkey. Sir E. Grey has no objection to the bestowal of the decorations to which you refer on the occasion of the official celebration of the King's birthday on the understanding that the information contained in the final sentence of the Viceroy’s telegram is definite.

CONFIDENTIAL. [May 18.] Section 3. [22042] No. 1. Sir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 18.) (No. 335.) Sir, Constantinople, May 12, 1914. IN his telegram dated the 8th May, which I repeated to you in my telegram No. 281 of the 9th instant, His Majesty’s consul at Basra reported the return from Koweit of the Turkish mission charged with the negotiations with Bin Saud. The moment appears to me an opportune one at which to review the question of His Majesty’s Government’s relations with Nejd from the Turkish Government’s point of view. The policy of His Majesty’s Government, as I understand it, has been directed to three ends only, namely, (1) to secure to British subjects free access to and proper treatment in Nejd, and more especially in the coastal regions ; (2) to avert developments in that region which would disturb the general peace of the Gulf and the performance of British duties there ; and (3) to prevent, or at least postpone, anything which might lead to a general Arab outbreak, and so endanger the integrity of the Turkish dominions in Asia. His Majesty’s Government having, by the agreement of the 29th July last,, recognised the entirely Ottoman character of Nejd and the El Hassa coast, it appears to me that the three aims just described can only be pursued consistently with that agreement by allowing the Porte to impose on Bin Saud', in fact, in so far as the El Hassa is concerned, the position which, as between ourselves and the Turkish Government, he is admitted to occupy in theory; in other words, to require either that he shall administer El Hassa as a Turkish officer, or allow the Turks to administer it themselves. So far as the first aim is concerned, Bin Saud might or might not, as an autonomous potentate, treat British subjects more favourably than the Turkish Govern ment would do. As for the second, there may be rival advantages in both alternatives,, hut I consider that there is something to be said in favour of having to deal with a Government which has now recognised our special position m the Gulf, should that Government be able to assert effective control over El Hassa. Turning to the third object, it is obviously impossible to foresee the course of events in the Ottoman Arab world generally, but I think, on the whole, that the chances of an upheaval might be increased rather than diminished if an influential and centrally placed chief like Bin Saud were to consolidate his power and extend it permanently to the seaboard. . .. ^ tt- I have analysed what I conceive to be the objects of the general policy of ^ His Majesty’s Government in regard to Nejd, because it appears to me that recent British action may give rise to apprehension in the minds of the Turkish Ministers that His Majesty’s Government are in reality pursuing another object, namely, that of estab lishing relations with Bin Saud which will in some sort reduce him to a state of semi-dependency on Great Britain. i t • i • , , It must be remembered that a series of coincidences have occurred which might encourage this suspicion in the Turkish mind. A month before Bin Saud s descent on El Hassa the British agent at Koweit visited him in the interior. Early in the present year he was visited by other British officers, with the result that Hakki Pasha was instructed to make a complaint in London. _ . T) . In March an endeavour of the Porte to enter into direct negotiations with Bm Saud through the emissary Omar Fauzi was foiled owing to the coldness of the Sheikh of Koweit, a British protege. At the beginning of April the commercial interests of the British India Company made it seem desirable that the British agent at Bahrein should , give them a written recommendation to Bin Saud, a step which, however innocent the objects of the mission, was again open to misconstruction. Finally, when Bm baud eventually agreed to meet the Turkish Commission, it was arranged that the meeting should take place at Koweit, and he was visited twice by the British agent there while the negotiations were in progress. When to these is added the lively interest which [2136 s—3] Coy 7 to \ LD MAY 1914 ' ' ! % ] *5) )\A&gt;2 f? tSt^vLchtoTakki pX&gt; n which P TXr aL! J^orte wa^ reproached witk the'reputed suggestkns^ medktk'n^^cari 'only \&gt;e that our aUitude wilf V. viewed tQ ® ay w well founded the Turkish suspicions “^7 be, even f. they exist, but it appears to me that, having concluded the agreement of July last, which secures us solid advantages in return for certain definite concessions to the Porte we are for the time debarred from doing anything which may be calculated to uphold Bin Saud as against the Ottoman Government. I think that, so long as t iere is any prospect whatever of the Turkish Government arranging matters with him by the dilatory and obscure methods of Oriental diplomacy, we should leave both sides severely alone“ it any rate in appearances, and should only intervene diplomatically if it became clear that the Porte are contemplating military measures, which falaat Bey assures me is not the case. As a matter of fact, I believe the Porte will strain every diplomatic resource in order to secure a settlement on the lines of practically recognising Bin au independence in the interior while regaining control of the El Hassa ... So far as I myself am concerned, my principal reason for urging the desn ability of refraining from further intervention of any kind for the present is that I consider it impossible to expect the Turkish Government to believe in the innocence of our motives and intentions. If we speak to them of a new situation of fact they wl j 1 s ay new situation dates from before our agreement with them of July last. If we say that our only desire is to promote peace in Arabia and the integrity of the Empire, they will say, or father, think, without saying it, that for ns to treat Bin Sand m a way which he^and all his neighbours will construe as a sort of recognition of his de /octo indepen- deuce is a singular way of helping them to keep their Empire together. If we say that we have axes to grind in the Ottoman world in Turkey, and foresee no profit to ourselves in an upheaval, they will receive our assurances with the politest Other events have recently occurred which, taken in connection with the affairs oi the Gulf, may have increased the Turkish suspicions of the trend of British policy. _ The Aziz Ali agitation, which moved Arab opinion over a wide area, and m connection with which my action was purely humanitarian was rendered hable to misconstruction by the indiscreet violence and partisanship of the Times^ It was the conviction of the Grand Yizier that Aziz Ali had been employed by the Khedive in connection with his endeavours to persuade the Sheikh of the Senoussi to make peace with the Italians, and it is not impossible that the Turkish Government may have some sort of evidence to support this supposition. Being at peace with Italy, they could not obiect openly to such action on the part of Aziz Ali, but they have certainly resented the Khedive’s intrigues with the Senoussi if the violence of the Grand Vizier s language respecting His Highness is any index of his feelings in regard to them. ^ It is permissible to assume that some members of the Turkish Government suspect that His Majesty’s Government, or, at any rate, the Egyptian Government, were privy to His Highness’s activities, which they may regard as a further indication ol tfritisti interference in Arab politics. .. , , , , I do not wish to exaggerate the risk of arousing Turkish suspicions, but it must not be forgotten that there are people here whose interest lies in maintaining an atmosphere of distrust between Great Britain and Turkey which makes it additionally important to avoid any cause of offence.

The Turkish plans in regard to the negotiations have again changed. A letter of which a translation is attached was received on the 12 th instant from Saiyid Talib.

Sir Mubarak has promised to inform Saiyid Talib of the arrival of Bin Sa'ud at Subaiyah some 20 miles South of Kuwait where he is expected to be in about ten days' time; the party will then come to Kuwait, and if Bin Sa'ud is still in the neighbourhood when they arrive the meeting may take place, but it is doubtful whether Bin Sa'ud will consent toIq axi interview as he is said to he determined to give no reply other than that contained in his letter to Saiyid Talih, the enclosure to my letter No.C.12^dated 7th Instant. 3. Possibly the position of affairs may change when and if the deputation have found that a gersoaal discus sion fails to modify the attitude of Bin Ba'ud in regard to the negotiations, but it would apparently be advisable to press the Turkish Government for an early reply to the Foreign Office memorandum of March 9th last, and, if possible, to induce them to abstain from further attempts to arrange matters without our assistance pending the consideration of such reply by His Majesty's Government.Letter from Saiyid Talib of Basrah to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak as Sabah, dated 15th Jamadi^al-Awal 1332 (11th April 1914)• After compliments, According to the orders of the Horae Department the solution of the present local difficulty, i.e. that between the Government and the'Amir Bin Sa’ud, has been entrusted to me, and I have asked for a special arrange ment® In compliance with my request the Chief of the Staff at Baghdad, he whom you have already interviewed Saiyid Umar Fauzi Beg the Basrah Chief of Staff and formerly Mutasarrif of Firan, (and I), we three are to interview the aforesaid Amir, who, according to your invitation is shortly to be in the neighbourhood of Kuwait. So we hope you will complete this memorable deed and that it (the meeting) may be at Malah or in some suitable place favourable for a conference; and that you will inform us of that by telegraphing to Fao or by a special messenger, it is for you to decide. And I will bring the decoration with me and present it to Your Excellency. We hope for an early xapix reply, and salaam. Some 10 miles S. of Kuwait.CONFIDENTIAL.

Grey, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter No. C.-16, dated the 29th April 1914, which I have addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure. No. C-16 (Confidential), dated Kuwait, the 29th April 1914. From— Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Incontinuationof my letter No. C-15, dated the 22nd instant, I have the honour to report further on the subject of Bin Sa’ud and the Turkish Government. 2. The Turkish representatives did not come to Kuwait last week as had been arranged. By the mail of the 22nd instant Shaikh Sir Mubarak received a letter from Saiyid Talib stating that he had written to Constantinople for more precise instructions in regard to the terms which he was to make with Bin Sa’ud, and that he had heard in reply that the question was still under discussion but. that instructions would be furnished to him. The party has arrived this morning in Sis Mubarak s steam launch “Mishrif” which has been for the last month or so lying at Mohammerah. 3. On the evening of the 26th instant Bin Sa’ud arrived at Subaihiyah with a large following, and early on the morning of the 27th the Shaikh sent his Secretarv to inform me that he had written asking the Amir to come to Malah, which is about half way between Kuwait and Subaihiyah, for the purpose of meeting me there. During the day the R. I. M. S. “Lawrence ” arrived with your endorse ment forwarding for necessary action by me telegram No. 256-S. from the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, and I explained to Shaikh Sir Mubarak in the afternoon that portion of its contents which concerned himself. Late in the evening came a reply from Bin Sa’ud to the effect that he would be at Malah on the following morning and hoped that I could come out then as he was anxious for a meeting as soon as possible. I accordingly went out ^yesterday taking with me the telegram above referred to. 4. After the usual polite enquiries I commenced the interview, at which nobody else was present, with explaining to the Amir that portion of the telegram of the Government of India which was intended for his information. I could see that he was disappointed, and at first inclined to think that he had been allowed to foster hopes which were not to be realised, but I had no difficulty in removing this view by the explanation that it was the Turkish Government who had declined our offer of mediation and that His Majesty’s Government obviously could not force upon them assistance which they did not desire. I informed him as instructed that there was now no objection to direct negotiations taking place between him and the Turks, and that the views of His Majesty’s Government had been conveyed to the Porte. 5. In reply, the Amir said that he did not intend to make an independent arrangement with the Turks unless he were forced to do so because they were never faithful to their engagements and in a very short time, it might not be more than two months, things would be as bad as ever in Hassa. He asked me what were the views of His Majesty’s Government which had been conveyed to the Porte. I replied that they concerned the provisional undertakings into which he had enteredwith our officers at Bahrain. He remarked that he had no further information regarding the conditions which the Turks would demand of him, but that they would never allow the presence of foreigners at Katif and that, in the event of an agreement being arrived at between him and themselves, they would undoubtedly compel him to keep such persons out. 6. I here thought it best to tell the Amir plainly that I had no authority to go over the old ground again, neither had I come out to persuade him to take a, course contrary to his inchnations, but that my duty was merely to carry out the mstruo tions which I had received. He then asked me whether, should he persevere with the answer alreadv given to Saiyid Talib (vide the enclosure to my letter No C.-12 dated 7th April), there would be any chance eventually of securing the mediation of His Maiesty’s Government. I replied that probably in that case the Turks would ask for that mediation which they had now declined in the hope of securing an agree ment without it; but Bin Sa’ud appeared to think that they would prefer war to that and went on to question me regarding the preparedness or unpreparedness of Turkey for war from which I saw that he was carefully considering this alternative. Before our interview closed he asked me whether His Majesty’s Government would give him an assurance that the Turks would never be allowed to take hostile action by sea aeainst the coast between Kuwait and Bahrain, as, he said, with that assurance he was prepared to defy them indefinitely, but I replied that I had no information on the subject beyond that already given to him in regard to Bahrain and its waters. 7. I confess that I returned to Kuwait without a clear idea of what course Bin Sa’ud was likely to take, in fact I doubt whether he has himself come as yet to a definite decision. That he would prefer to persevere in his refusal to accept any arrangement which was not guaranteed in some form or another by His Majesty s Government I am convinced, and that Shaikh Sir Mubarak and other friends have inspired him with that confidence in us which he lacks in the Turks is certain; but he seems to fear that in default of a definite promise such as that referred to above he might be left to face attacks by sea as well as by land which would be more than he could repel; and he may on this account feel obliged to make the best terms possible for himself at the approaching conference. In the latter case I regard it as m the highest degree probable that he will use every possible means to draw His Majesty s Government into the negotiations, e.g., by accepting, under the plea of compulsion, conditions from the Turks which he knows we will be loth to recognise owing to the interests assailed. 8. I hope to be able to report further within the next few days, and in Anew of the interesting position which now exists here am sending a copy of this letter direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to save time.

I attach a translation of a letter from Bin Sa ud to Sir Mubarak which the latter handed to me during an interview on Monday. It represents an interesting piece of oriental diplomacy, the original document will be shewn to the deputation by the Shaikh with the remark that he has done what little he can but this is Bin Sa’ud’s reply; his face will thus be saved vis-a-vis of his guests while the attitude of Bin Sa’ud remains unaltered. 4.

Bin Sa’ud sent a confidential messenger with this letter who had an interview with me. He said that Bin Sa’ud would like to have another meeting with me, and asked if I could arrange it. I replied that I should like very much to see Bin Sa ud again, but I did not think it would be advisable for me to go and meet him now, without sanction from superior authority, as possibly, in view of the pour parlers going on in London, such action might be open to objection. . In an y case 1 c o u W not add anything to what I had said at the former inter view and in my letter No. 514 as I knew nothing further. Ihe messenger said that Bin Sa’ud had received a letter from Shaikh Mubarak suggesting a meeting with Binbashi Saiyid ’Omar Beg at Kuwait. I said that as tar as I was aware, there did not appear to be any immediate neces sity to arrive at a settlement, and recommended delay. The messenger however seemed to think that Bin Sa’ud would feel called upon to go if he received' another letter. My impression is that Bin Sa’ud intends to go and have a meeting m any case, and is naturally very anxious to know first whether the British Govern ment has been able to do anything for him.

The Porte having informed His Majesty*s Ambassador that they had great hopes of arriving at a satisfactory settlement with Bin Baud them selves it was decided by His Majesty^ Government for reasons of general policy not to press mediation. This decision was influenced by the belief that the negotiations were to be conducted through Shaikhs of Moharamerah and Koweit in whom His Majesty’s Government have such great confidence. We now authorise you to acquaint Bin Gaud through Political Agent that there is no objection to his (Bin Sand’s) negotiating direct with Turks and that Porte have been informed by His Majesty’s Government of their views. Sheikh of Koweit should be informed at same time that there is no objection to his affording his good offices to assist progress of negotiations. Sheikh should also be made acquainted with the four British desiderata detailed in memorandum of March 9th to Hakhi pashi viz. (a) Non-interference by Bin Baud in politics and territory of Arab rulers on Gulf including Katar. (b) That Bin Saud should cooperate as the Arab rulers do in putting down piracy and in the maintenance of maritime truce generally. (c) Similar action in regard to suppression of Arms Traffic. (d) That British traders should be allowed to go to Katif and should receive proper treatment there.

Section 2. ^ [21324] No. 1. Sir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 13.) (No. 319. Confidential.) Si rj Constantinople, May 8, 1914. I transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Basra r respecting the negotiations with Bin Sand. The anxious enquiries of the new Yali of Basra respecting the relations with Bin Saud and the objects and intentions of His Majesty’s Government in regard to him no doubt reflect the feelings of the Turkish Government, and when Talaat Bey assures me that he has absolute confidence in the intentions of His Majesty’s Government to abide by the letter and spirit of the agreement of the 29th July, 1913, it is probably but an Oriental manner of intimating that he has strong suspicions of British loyalty. Since the date of Mr. Crow’s despatch of the 7th April Bin Saud has arrived at Koweit, so that |it would seem that Sheikh Mubarak must have somewhat modified his previous attitude and have decided to take some part in the negotiations between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government, which, I imagine, it is desirable, should succeed, unless His Majesty’s Government are desirous of acting as mediators in order to ensure that there should be nothing in any agreement which may be made of a nature hostile to British interests. My reason for venturing to question the wisdom of deprecating the bestowal of a Turkish decoration on the Sheikh at this moment was due to a desire not to give any pretext to the Turkish Government for suspecting that His Majesty’s Government were attempting to intervene to prevent an understanding with Bin Saud, as it occurred to me that the object of the Porte in decorating the Sheikh at this juncture might be to secure his good-will and assistance. From a remark made to me by Talaat Bey, I gathered, however, that you had already spoken to Hakki Pasha on the subject, and that the bestowal of the decoration would be deferred if the deputation which was to confer it had not already reached Koweit. Should the negotiations break down there is always a risk that hostilities might be engaged before the mediation of His Majesty’s Government, even if it had been accepted by Turkey, could take effect. It would seem, therefore, much to be desired that the negotiations should succeed, and, quite apart from the impression which would be created here, in the highest degree unfortunate if they should break down owing to any impression created in Bin Sand’s mind that His Majesty’s Govern ment are indifferent to their success. # . . I have been careful to explain to Talaat Bey the reasons for the interest which His Majesty’s Government are bound to feel in the question, but even if^ I had been successful in convincing the Minister himself, it is certain that suspicions of our intentions must exist in the minds of many of the subordinate officials, suspicions which will only be increased by the transmission of letters to Bin Saud, signed by the political agent, however innocent their contents. s I have, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. V* A Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir L. Mallet. (No. 23.) _ . -7 r* i m gj r Basra, April i , 1914. WITH reference to your Excellency’s telegram No. 21 of the 2nd April and the visit of Major Omar Fauzi to Koweit, I have the honour to transmit the following extract from the diary of the political agent at Koweit for March, which has just reached me. I send this information in case it does not reach your Excellency from other sources :— “At an interview which the political agent had with the Sheikh of Koweit at Mohammerah, Sheikh Mubarak informed him that the new Vali of Basra exchanged visits t 2136 ”- 2 J X [^pyto^dla] £ ']; v -■ r f C' i &gt;■ t rl * j l L 9 WAY19Hwith him when passing through Mohammerah, and enquired from him anxiously- regarding the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Bin Sand, and their objects and intentions in the Arab country on the shore of the Persian Gulf. The Sheikh returned diplomatic replies. He said that it was quite a mistake to think that Bin Saud had received or would receive any assistance from the British in his rebellion against the Turks, and that His Majesty’s Government had no object in Eastern Arabia so far as he knew beyond the protection of their nationals and proteges and the encouragement of their interests and the preservation of law and order generally 7 . The Vali also questioned Sheikh Mubarak regarding his relations with England and was told in reply that the friendship which had existed between his Excellency and the British Govern ment for generations was a source of strength and satisfaction to the ruler of Koweit. To this the Vali is said to have returned no answer. “ At another interview which the political agent had with Sheikh Mubarak on the 20th March, the latter informed him that a Bimbashi had arrived from the Turkish War Department, in Constantinople, with orders to try and induce Sheikh Mubarak to arrange an interview between him and Bin Saud, if possible, at Koweit. The Sheikh told the Bimbashi plainly that this was out of the question. The latter then asked him for a letter to take into Nejd, introducing and recommending him to Bin Saud. Sheikh Mubarak replied that all he could give would be a brief note quite devoid of recommendation of any sort. The envoy replied that such a communication would be of no use. He has since had other interviews with Sheikh Mubarak, but so far as the political agent has information has received the same answers. “ Sheikh Mubarak asked the political agent on the 20th March whether he approved of the replies given to the Bimbashi, and was told that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s representative, he was wise in declining to be mixed up in matters which did not concern him. There does not appear to be any truth in the reports which have reached Bahrein. Sheikh Mubarak, who has received no communication from Bin Saud, is strongly of opinion that the anti-Turkish feeling among the Arabs of Nejd is so strong that Bin Saud will not find it possible to make any compromise with the Ottoman Government, even if he wished to do so. The Bimbashi left for Basra by the mail steamer of the 25th March.” I will keep your Excellency informed by telegraph of any developments as instructed. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW.CONFIDENTIAL.

The fact that such a communication was made could not well be conveyed to Bin Sa’ud, and would not therefore earn is latitude and from the general trend of the correspondence, I gather that the ^indeTendent action ” against which the Secretary of State desires Bin Sa’ud should be warned is not so much warlike preparations to repel a possible invasion as some form of entangling alliance which might injuriously affect British interests. 'With both sides engaged in warlike preparations, which, from recent t „ nn ]i]( ( &gt;ly to lead to active operations, it may be hoped that the ZsMkv oTsuch an understanding between Bin Sa’ud and the Turks is a remote P O « b nrl Colons as active hostilities do not result, and this eventuality is being carefully watched, it would seem, from our point of view, that both parties could not be better employed.

Referring to Foreign Department telegram No. D.S.-166 of 17th March to your address, it may perhaps be observed that Bin Sa’ud will be more likely to accept with gratitude and readiness any arrangement which we may make on his behalf with the Turks if they, as well as he, are asked to defer action pending the result of the negotiations. Captain Shakespear, who was at Riadh on the 10th ultimo, informs me that Bin Sa’ud had then already heard of the Turkish attempts at mobilisation, and it will naturally be more difficult to restrain him unless such preparations on their part are suspended. Letter from His Excellency Saiyid Muhammad ’Arif bin 1 usuf, Wali of Suriya (Syria), to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak as Sabah, dated 12 Eabi-ul- Awwal 1332 (9th February 1914). After compliments, The bearer of this letter is my son, Binbashi Saiyid ’Umar Fauzi, who is sent to you by His Excellency Anwar Pasha, the War Minister of the Ottoman Govern ment, to discuss with you that which concerns the welfare of the countries and peoples, and, by your means, to come in touch with Abd-ul-Aziz bin Sa’ud. So it is hoped that you will furnish him with your advice and supply him with a letter to the person referred to, saying that this, my son, is the confidential agent of the Minister alluded to for the discussion of all matters relating to those parts (Nejd) : also that meeting him is meeting me, and to trust him is to trust the Government and the Minister above-mentioned. And I pray that God will give you (Mubarak) prosperity and success in what lies before you, you will then gain from this affair great future reward, universal praise, and the approval of the Sultan.

After compliments, In addition to what Your Excellency has learned from the letters which I placed before you when I arrived here and that which I have represented to you verbally, I beg to lay before you (in writing) the special mission in which I am employed by the Minister for War, Anwar Pasha, namely, that I should meet His Excellency the Amir Abd-ul-Aziz as Sa’ud and discuss with him in a friendly manner measures to terminate the present difficulties which are not hidden from Your Excellency : and my hope from you is that you will write a letter to the aforesaid Amir asking him to come to some place which you consider suitable for our meet- conference, which may be close at hand to enable me to communicate with the \\ ar Minister by telegraph. I have hopes that you and I may agree in this matter, so that through us the shedding of Muslim blood may be avoided, and thereby you will gam future reward from Heaven and praise from our Muham madan brethren, and salaam. Letter from His Excellency Anwar Pasha, Ottoman War Minister, to His Excellency Sir Mubarak as Sabah — undated. After compliments, Know, oh brother, that the Moslem world is at the present time attacked by enemies loin a sices and places and that it stands among them all practically without a helper or supporter. Moreover her own people have deserted her, and the enemies have come in between her and them by means of tricks, lies, and decep tions Now we, her friends, in obedience to the Divine command and the incum- K-n seivice of the revealed religion, have decided upon guarding zealously what is °f“ to Isla!n and collecting those who profess the unity of God as proclaimed bythe prophet, hoping that every zealous and religious Muslim will extend to us the hand of help and faithful service in the cause of religion and will act according to the saying of the great guide (Muhammad) “ The Faithful in their mutual affec- t ion, sympathy, and cohesion, are like a human body all parts of which cry out if any limb complains And since you are numbered among Muslims we call upon you by this letter to take these matters to heart! and God is the witness and on looker : there is certainly no permanent value in Government, property, or anything of these perishable things, the object of all is to do the will of Heaven and to exalt the Divine creed in Divine territory “ if there is good knowledge of God in your heart good will come to you even from what is taken away from you ” (Koran), and salaam.

It is not hidden from Your Excellency that the exalted Government is occupied with the settlement of Nejd matters, and their chief object is to avoid bloodshed and the rise of hatred among Muslims, and we have to ask help from honoured persons, such as yourself especially, as we ought to be working together in this matter, seeking for Divine favour that our efforts may be crowned with success. We hope for your valuable opinion and profitable help according to what you see to be advisable, and trust that you will disclose to us how to get to the root of the matter so that we may succeed in the affair. When I see you I will speak upon the subject, meanwhile I hope for an answer from you, and salaam.

May Heaven prolong your life! The settlement of Nejd affairs has been committed to His Excellency the Wali who has written to Your Excellency a letter which I enclose, and since you are of the first of those whose opinions are profitable, you are requested to help energetically in this important matter so that it may be carried through with great success. Blease point out what should be done in the matter, and salaam. C48FD 3 45 (83) No. 1070 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 11th (received the 20th) April, 1914. From— Major S. G.

The Shaikh asked me what reply he should give. I said that Bin Sa’ud should be told to continue to act in conformity with the advice given to him by Major Trevor, and to abstain from further action for the present. His Excellency then told me clearly that what Bin Sa ud desired was the same position as that assured to the Shaikh of Kuwait under the recent Ang o- Ckish Agreement, viz .,autonomy with British protection under Turkish suzerainty and added that, in his opinion, any other arrangement would result m endless trouble in the future for the Arabs, for the Turks, and for ourselves. I replied that the question had been referred to His Majesty s Government, and thatBin Sa’ud’s best chance of obtaining a solution which wouhi be satisfactory to himself would be implicitly to adhere to the instructions which he had received.

Sir P. Cox, in his “ memorandum, of guidance^, for Major Trevor at his meeting with Bin Sa ud in December last, observes that “ it may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our media tion if possible and the local state of affairs at the moment leads me to fear that, notwithstanding Hakki Pasha's apparent readiness frankly to exchange views at the discussions which have recently taken place in London, the replies of the Porte to the representations of His Majesty's Government may be purposely delayed pending the result of the efforts which are being made locally to effect a settlement with Bin Sa'ud, a settlement which, whatever its exact terms may be, will certainly be opposed to our interests, and fatal to the future peace and j prosperity of certain regions adjoining the Persian Gulf. Translation of a letter from Abd-ul-Aziz Bin Sa’ud to Saiyid Talib of Basrah, undated. After compliments, I was very pleased to receive your letter signifying your devotion to the Exalted Government (Porte), which devotion I share, as you know, brother, that I am the first in wishing well to that Government and country. And it is with great grief that I have to ask you to represent to the persons charged with the business that although I do not waver in allegiance to Islam or turn from obedience to the Porte there are things that I cannot do. Please present my good wishes to Anwar Pasha, the present war minister, and assure him that I also desire the union of Islam and the binding together of separated hearts, and moreover that I am grate ful to him for having sent His Excellency Saiyid 'Umar Fauzi Beg for the establish ment of friendly relations and for the latter having brought a valuable present in the shape of the noble Koran. But it is not hidden from you that the affairs of our country at the present moment are in a very strange condition, of which indeed the description is impossible, and that I am not responsible for this. If the Government’s intentions are really to protect the country from various dangers and to gather Islam together in obe dience to the Khalifate then this can only be done by diplomatic measures followed *His Ma esty’s Government is meant here. ^ Proclamation, ^ and it IS for the Porte to accomplish this with those people* whose good qualities cause the countries of the world to remain in repose, whom we know and on whom we depend and do not wish to displease by actions contrary to our promises to them.

And as for the valuable present, I accept it, and hope you will convey my excuses, and salaam. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. 0-48 F. £5,-13-4.14, 38— B.A.fib Decypher of telegram from Sir L.

Latter brings with him Turkish decoration for Sheikh of Koweit. Probable date of meeting 22nd Aprd or later. These reports are confirmed by Basrah. With reference to memorandum of 9th March, it is important to the Government of India to be made aware, if possible, before direct negotiations commence, whether His Majesty’s Government have received satisfactory assurances from Porte that our Gulf interests will not be prejudiced by terms of settlement; and if not, whether any informal action through Sheikh of Koweit or our local Political Officer is permissible in order to secure our design. The evident anxiety of Turks to push through direct negotiations makes us somewhat doubtful of their intentions in above connection.From Viceroy, 20th April 1914. Foreign Secret.

Political Agent at Koweit reports that Vali Basrah has written to Sheikh informing him that Porte bestows on him Order of the Osmanlieh, first class, and. intimating his desire to visit Koweit forthwith for investiture! Sheikh regards proposed visit as a card in the Turkish negotiations with Bin baud, and would rather Y T ali did not come. He suggests pi’oposing to proceed to Fao for the purpose. This suggestion commends itself to us, as we consider that visit of Yali to Koweit at this juncture might be inconveniently misunderstood. Bin Sand would derive a wrong impression of our attitude, and the Arab public a false idea of existing position in regard to Koweit generally. Seeing that we ourselves have designedly refrained from decorating Sheikh pending the publication of convention and decent lapse of time, perhaps this fact could be mentioned to Hakki Pasha, accompanied by suggestion for postponement of investiture. In case Sheikh should be ultimately drawn into negotiations with Bin Sand we would suggest, if you see no objection, our acquainting him with nature of British requirements as specified in memorandum to Hakki Pasha, dated 9th March.

Sir: - fc/U: On the I3th September last, as you are aware, a letter was addressed to this Department by the direction of the Secretary of State for India, enclosing a telegram from the Viceroy, which contained the following passages 'There can be no doubt, so far as India's interests are concerned, that the existence in Asia of a strong Turkish power, friendly and reformed, will be a safeguard against interference with India from the west; it might even be the indirect means of Persia’s integrity oeing maintained.

Our responsibilities would be increased thereby, and G-reat Britain, it may be observed, would have to bear a share of the increase. 'It is our strong opinion, therefore, that every effort should be made to avoid action likely to lead to the partition, either now or in the future, of Turkey’s Asiatic possessions, and that His Majesty’s Government should pursue consistently the policy of maintaining the Turkish Empire while reforming and strengthening it”. I am to request that the despatch No . 193 of (*/ ; u j from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople , of which a cony was sent to you on the 30tn ultimo, may be read in the light of the above soatement oi policy, and I am to observe that, in view of the importance of a successful settlement being reached of the negotiations now taking place between the Ottoman Government and Bin Baud through the Sheikh of Koweit, Sir E. Grey on considera tion has grave doubts as to the wisdom of conveying to Bin Saud a warning, as proposed in the telegram of March 16th to the Viceroy, against acting independently oi His Majesty’s Government. It(12320/14) It is true that direct negotiations have, in a very informal manner, taken place between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government; but Sir E. Grey feels that this does not, in existing conditions afford sufficient justification for an intimation being conveyed to a Turkish subject that he should not negotiate with his own Government, especially having regard to the terms of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of so recent a date as July 29th, 1913. If, as the Government of India may apprehend, terns are agreed between the Ottoman Government and Bin Baud wnich are inconsistent with British rights, or unfair to British commercial interests, or opposed to the political duties oi Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, the remedy, in Sir E.Grey’s opinion, would lie in direct negotiation with the Ottoman Government. The adoption of this procedure, and the dis continuance of direct communications of a questionable nature with Bin Saud may possibly, Sir E . Grey holds, cause some minor local inconvenience in the Persian Gulf; but such inconvenience would in all probability be of short duration and it is desirable to incur it rather than to run the risk of the graver dangers so forcibly portrayed in thes»*o ^ (12320A4) the Viceroy’s telegram of last September I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, ^ fir'In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote and address— The Under-Secretary of State, , Foreign Office, a London. “ ■ \ ' ■' I I -e- J I I '-v . 1 ; The Under-Secretary oj State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for and, by direction oj the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paperU) Foreign Office, .Ah, 2&gt;&lt;o , ign- Reference to previous letter: Description of Inclosure.

IN my despatch No. 1021 of the 20th December last I mentioned a rumour that some leading Arab chiefs contemplated holding a congress at Koweit or elsewhere with a view to bringing pressure to bear on the Turkish Government, which showed some signs of uneasiness at the attitude of the Ottoman Arab world. In paragraph 11 of his summary of events for the three months ending January 1914 the acting British consul-general at Bagdad reproduces the same rumour, with the added detail that among those to be represented at the congress were the Grand Sherif of Mecca, Ibn Sand of Nejd, Ibn Rashid Jebel Shammar, Ajeymi Sheikh of Muntefik, and Seyyid Talib of Basra. Although Colonel Erskine goes on to state that the projected conference is unlikely to be held, the report is significant in view of the dissatisfaction which prevails among Ottoman Arabs generally, and the list of names given is an indication of the possibility of the great chieftains on the Arab fringe of the Empire sinking their personal differences in order to enforce nationalist aspirations as against the Central Government, which is directed by the Committee of Union and Progress, and which they still regard as pursuing a Turkifying policy. So far there had been little sign of cohesion, the Grand Sherif having been at open enmity with Ibn^ Sand, for instance, and Ajeymi having been until recently an avowed enemy of Seyyid Talib s. The Grand Sherif’s attitude being of special interest in consequence of his recent application to Lord Kitchener, I enclose a memorandum which I have had prepared concerning him. As for Ibn Saud, his occupation of El Hassa last year is an eloquent demonstration both of his power and of his feelings towards the Central Government. Seyyid Talib’s influence in Basra, the skill which he has displayed m consolidating it, and the relations which he maintains with Koweit and Nejib are well known to His Majesty’s Government. If these leaders were to combine either in a constitutional agitation for devolution or autonomy or in an avowedly Separatist movement they could undoubtedlv cause much trouble. In this connection I may refer to that part of my despatch No. 117 of the 24th February last which deals with the wider aspects of the Aziz Ali case. 1 i p u a It is still impossible to say what real prospect there may be of any united Arab movement. That the Central Government is on the alert is perhaps indicated by the fact that energetic military Valis on whom the committee can rely have been within the last few months appointed to Bagdad, Basra, and the Hedjaz. Ibn baud has bee negotiating terms of submission to the Government. The Grand Shen . , Abdullah, who is a deputy in the Turkish Parliament, has come on from Egypt to Constatinople by invitation from them, and according to accounts which I have hea he appears to be nervous as to what may await him here. I have thought it prudent to abstain from showing any particular interest m the Arab question in my conversations with the Grand Vizier and other Ministers m view of the^uspicions which it might arouse, as the Turkish Government are pro^ of the inclination of the Arabs to look to His Majesty s Government for sympat y_ tteir movement and even for eventual protection if they are their imienendence I have reported m my despatch No. 11/ of the ^4tn ultimo t e lan^ua/e which has been held to Arab officers in the Turkish army who have visited His 0 Majesty's Embassy, and have enquired what would be the attitude of His ajes y « Government in certain eventualities. As I am disposed to see m the lecent outrages at Basra, which are principally directed against British subjects an * e P a ^ of the Arabs to force the hand of His Majesty’s Government in the direction ol intervention, I informed Mr. Crow on the 17th ultimo that I could not recommem t e despatch of a British man-of-war to the Shatt-el-Arab. e V ;,We of The need for caution is apparent at the present moment, when there is evidei ce a concerted movement.on the part of the Arabs. If these projects should mature, and [2067 3 ! 7 -5] L 8 APR 1 SI4 ; . ' n ' v H 9 APR19U ) V 12 (jw A if the Arabs are eventually successful in defeating the Ottoman armies the loss of the Caliphate would probably follow, when, shorn of a further large portion of territory and of the religious leadership, Turkish rule, as it exists to-day would presumably disappear Europe might then be faced with the question of a partition of the Turkish Empire which might easily produce complications of a serious nature, whilst it is _ Suit to estimate what might be the effects on India of a prolonged struggle for the possession^ view of the great issues at stake, the present Govern ment would do all in their power to avoid bringing matters to a point at the present moment and that they will probably temporise with the Grand Shenf-at any rate, until they have either divided the Arabs and feel that they are m a position to face them with certainty of success. ^ l^e &amp;c ’ T mtlQ M ATT TTT r Clq Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum on the Position of the Grand Shemf of Mecca. THE position of the Grand Sherif of Mecca differs considerably from that of other Arab potentates inasmuch as he is always invested with his authority by the Sultan s firman and is in close touch with the capital, where several _ members of Ins ^ly ordinarily reside. Any given Grand Sherif might quite conceivably put himsel at the head of an Arab movement, and, if he wished to do so, his alleged descent rom e Prophet and membership of the Koreish tribe would doubtless be a valuable asset, but in order to gain any widespread influence he would have to start almost from the beginning, and, in the case of the present man, I think he would have to Irve down a past in which, while working for his own aggrandisement, he has posed very defmiteiy as the representative of the Central Government. The following is a sketch of his recent history so far as it is known to me :— During the last years of the old regime Sherif Hussein Pasha was a member of the Council of State here. Towards the end of 1908 he was appointed Grand Sherif in the ordinary course of succession, his predecessor, Abdillah (who seems to have been Grand Sherif without proceeding to Mecca), having died that year. He was then about fifty-six years of age. On his arrival he created a good impression, and it was hoped that he would not prove extortionate, and would restore security in the country about Mecca. In reporting, his appointment to the Foreign Office Sir G. Lowther spoke favourably of him, and mentioned that some months before, at a time when there was no prospect of his becoming Grand Sherif, he had gone out of his way to express his friendship towards England. Since his appointment it cannot be said that he has done anything definite to alleviate the pecuniary burdens of the pilgrims. On the other hand, although insecurity continued to prevail on the roads in 1909, no robberies were reported to the embassy in the three following years until nearly the end of 1912, when there was a recrudescence of brigandage. Meanwhile the Grand Sherif was engaged in consolidating his own power, and his success in doing so was facilitated by the frequent changes of Valis, most of the nominees to that post having been men of little account. He and his sons took a considerable share in military operations, which, though undertaken in the name of the Government, contributed to his own aggrandise ment. Thus, in 1910 he conducted an expedition against the Nejd ruler, Ibn Saud, which ended in a paper success for the Turkish Government, though the promises made by Ibn Saud were never kept, and extremely bad relations subsisted between him and the Grand Sherif throughout the following year. In 1911, again, he (the Grand Sherif) and his sons campaigned in Asir, and in July he actually succeeded in relieving Ebha, which had been besieged by the followers of Idris for many months. By 1912 the position as reported by His Majesty’s late consul was that the improved pilgrimage conditions which followed the constitution had been superseded by a renewed policy of extortion on the part of the Grand Sherif and that his authority had grown vastly while that of the Yali had sunk to nothing. When in the summer of that year three Indians were found murdered in the Medina district the consul was assured that the guilty parties were emissiaries of the Grand Sherif, who had been ordered by the Government to withdraw his son and his Bedouins from Asir, and who, so the informant said, was deliberately seeking to create disturbance in the Medinadistrict so as to convince tlie Government of the necessity of bringing it also under his authority. However that may be, there was certainly a recrudescence of brigandage, as mentioned above, towards the end of 1912. _ i . n „ While the Grand Sherif has stood for the authority of the Turkish Govern ment as above described, vis-d-vis chiefs like Ibn Saud and Idris, he has not been veil-disposed towards the Committee of Union and Progress. His own son Sherif Abdullah, sat for Mecca in the first Parliament, and in the packed Committee Parliament of 1912 he was able to put in one son for Mecca and the other Faizal, for Jeddah. They played no prominent part in parliamentary life here, but it is significant that in 1911, some months before the second election, the committee ebbs in Mecca and Jeddah “ died a natural death.” It is also interesting to note that the two best-known Sherifs resident in Constantinople, Ah Haidar and Jafer, are close allies of the committee, the former having been for a time Minister of Uvkat and bein^ now Vice-President of the Senate, while Jafer toured Syria m the committee interest at the time of the 1912 elections. Now these brothers are reported to be bitterly hostile to the present Grand Sherif. Ah Haidar is the head of the dispossesse Motalhb branch of the Shereefian family, and is said to cherish the ambition o becoming Grand Sherif himself. . tt„ qo •_ Under all these circumstances it is easy to understand how anxiously Hussem Pasha must have viewed the advent of a young and possibly energetic Vaii. in doubtless explains his sending Abdullah Bey to Lord Kitchener A.s s 'l seq ^ report of an amicable settlement of his differences with the lurks, it is difficult to foim an opinion as to the sincerity of either side. It is conceivable that statesmen here may have thought it best not to seek for trouble, and the Grand Sherif may _ nosition sufficiently menaced to make it worth his while to risk everything on P rlpfinuce of the Central Government. On the other hand, Constantinople may feel th ETgS..£ gone ». far, .»d «to Grand Sh.rif •a,,.h„kth.ub.™. = of a rival friendly to the Committee and already a candidate for the post, incr ■ SK 3 S Ik. y&lt;&gt;“S - ™ » “ “* reception here.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] 2Z '■ turkey. \ [March 30.] CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, Constantinople, March 25, 1914. ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 193 of the lBth March, I had an opportunity last night of speaking to Talaat Bey abont the situation at Basra, and I mentioned the Butterworth case and told him that an attempt had been made quite recently to rob the house of His Majesty’s consul. Talaat Bey was much concerned and said that he would do all he could to improve the policing of the town, and that want of money had alone prevented them from doing this sooner. After the loan had been granted, they would set to work. In view of these circumstances and of the extreme financial pressure, I am not inclined to advance a claim for compensation for the Butterworth murder unless you instruct me to do so. „ . , T i w ,, x , As Talaat Bey seemed to he in a very friendly mood, I thought that there would he no harm in referring to the Arab question, and I enquired what was now the disposition of Sayid Talib. He replied that Talib was now on good terms with the Government, and that Sheikh Khazal and Sheikh Mubarak were also friendly and would help them to settle matters with Ibn Saud. I said that I presumed that in those circumstances the Government had come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Arabs about their representation m Parliament, and he replied that this was so, and that the Arabs were now quite satisfied. A new Arab senator had been appointed that day, which had given satisfaction. . Talaat Bey added that I knew that the Government were nowadays very wise and prudent, and that they meant to settle their differences peacefully in future and not by tti ord 6 7 replied that I had reported in that sense to you, and that your recent speech showed that you had confidence in the assurances given to me.

Grand Vipisr was atlffer than on previous occasion, seemed to be suspicious of Lord Kitchener's interest in the case, and made light of Egyptian public opinion, which, ho said, had been manufactured and meant very little. I f Asia ware to be liberated, there would be no guarantee that he would not intrigue with Arabs; under taking on the part of Egyptian Government or of Governor of Cairo would be worthless.

Memorandum communicated to Hakki Pasha, March 9, 1914. BIN SAUD-. The subject being a complicated one it has seemed more convenient to draw up an informal memorandum for the personal information and use of his Highness Hakki Pasha. , . In August last it was explained to his Highness that Bin Sand, by the fact of ms assumption of control at Katif and Ojair and the coast-line of the El Hassa province, had now entered specifically into the sphere of Gulf politics and commerce ; and that important British interests and obligations in the Gulf (e.g., in connection with the maintenance of the maritime peace, the suppression of piracy, and the arms traffic , the settlement of pearling and slavery disputes) made it impossible for us to ignore Bin Sand and pretend to treat the province and coast of Hassa as politically derelict. We must necessarily have relations with someone in dc facto authority, and the lurks having evacuated the region we must deal with Bin Sand and were glad to explain the position to them. The above communication was an obviously frank and friendly act prompted by our desire to act with them in a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation. Hakki Pasha received the communication very favourably, and replied that the Porte was already in negotiation with Bin Sand and that if occasion for our mediation arose it would be taken advantage of. v 1 , In spite of this friendly response by his Highness we know from reliable local information that just after this exchange of communications, or conceivably just befoie it, the Ottoman Government were endeavouring to arrange terms with Bin Sand, some of which were clearly directed against the British Government and British interests. Thus, according to our information, the following are the conditions which the Loite are endeavouring to impose on Bin Sand as the price of his partial autonomy. 1. The readmission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hassa, as formerly. ... n v &lt;&lt; r ,, 2. The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers by direct iaimans issued by the Sultan. 3. The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of £ T. 3,000. 4. The reference of all communications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6 . An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor car-services. Incidentally, the Minister of the Interior has since informed His Majesty’s Ambassador (1st December, 1913), that the Ottoman Government had decided to recognise the recent fait accompli in Nejd (El Hassa) by nominating Ibn Saud a&amp; Mutessarif of that district. The first three of the six conditions above quoted refer to matters with wnicn we are not immediately concerned, but considering the frank communication made to Hakki Pasha in August by His Majesty’s Foreign Office, it would not be unnatmai that His Majesty’s Government should be greatly surprised at the terms ol the latter three, especially 4 and 5 , and, if the information proved to be correct, should feel constrained to protect strongly against them. . ^ The only explanation of such conditions would appear to be that tne roite mistrust the assurances already offered of our readiness to co-operate, and that they fail to appreciate the difficulties in which we are placed by the^ continuance ol the present unsatisfactorv state of affairs between themselves and Bin Saud. We fully recognise that Nejd is an Ottoman province, and have no desire to interfere in it, but for the reasons already given we cannot ignore Bin Saud now that [2067 7—1] i, r igWiARlSI'■ Copy to 5 rjd’a 13 MAR 19142 he is in occupation of the coast-line.

There is nothing in these conditions to which either Bin Sand or the Porte can take the least legitimate objection; at the same time it is only natuial that while expressing his readiness to accept the obligations involved, Bin baud should in return desire the friendly offices of the British Government in the composition of his quarrel with the Turkish'authorities, and should ask us to deter sheikhs in relations with us from harbouring tribal enemies of his. We had no wish to intrude ourselves, but the terms of the conditions which, as we hear, the Porte now seek to impose on Bin Sand, show so little friendliness toward ourselves, and are so impossible of acquiescence, that we are obliged to return to the subject. &gt; ... . We are primarily concerned to see the last three conditions withdrawn, but we should also be glad to see a satisfactory arrangement come to with Bin Sand by the Porte, under which as a corollary of their decision to regard Bin Saud as ex officio Mutessarif of El Hassa, they should approve and take cognisance of his undertaking to comply locallv with our four desiderata above detailed, and, while reserving the right to take in the last resort whatever action they may deem necessary, should, by way of friendly co-operation with the British Government for the preservation of peace and good order in the Gulf, agree to refrain from hostile action by sea against the El Hassa coast, without first consulting us, and giving us an opportunity of friendly mediation if such be possible.

TURKEY. Section 1, [March 7.j [Amended Copy.] [ 10244 ] No. 1 . Foreign Office to India Office, Sir, Foreign Office, March 7, 1914. WITH reterence to previous correspondence respecting Bin Sand and his relations with the Ottoman and British Governments, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a minute by Mr. Parker recording a conversation with Hakki Pasha. I am to state that, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, the fact that information regarding the recent meeting between British officers and Bin Saud has come to the knowledge of the Ottoman Government renders it necessary that the utmost care should be exercised in regard to any future communications with that chief, as it is clear from the language of Hakki Pasha that such communications do in fact tend to give rise to grave suspicion on the part of the Ottoman Government. Sir E. Grey is farther of opinion that, in view of the language of His Highness, the utmost caution should be observed at the interviews which are to take place with Hakki Pasha next week, in order that the Ottoman Government may be reassured as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Sir E. Grey believes that the Ottoman Government, if treated with frankness, will show themselves prepared to meet the reasonable requirements of His Majesty’s Government, but he is anxious to dispel any erroneous impression which may have arisen that British policy is directed towards attached to the Convention signed on the 29th July, 1913, and to the north of tnat line, excepting Koweit, the territory was Turkish, and formed part of an Ottoman province ; the Ottoman Government was, therefore, greatly concerned to hear that communications had been made by us direct to an Ottoman subject in territory recognised as Ottoman, and that any communication should not have been addressed to the Ottoman Government. I said that curiously enough this was the very subject about which I wished to speak to him, and that the appointments I had already fixed for him at the Foreign Office on Monday and Wednesday were in order that he might have a full and trank interchange of views with Sir Percy Cox, who was shortly going to India, and with Sir A. Hirtzel and myself. We felt that it would be of great value for such an exchange to take place about our mutual interests in the Gulf, and about Bin Saud in particular. The meeting to which His Highness had referred had in fact taken place. Hakki Pasha would recollect that some months ago I had spoken to him about His Majesty’s Government being able and willing to use their good offices in order to effect a reconciliation between him and the Ottoman Government, and His Highness had, after reference to Constantinople, expressed his Government’s appreciation of our offer, which, if later need should arise, they would be glad to avail themselves of, but that weakening the Ottoman authority in Nejd, as such a policy would be inconsistent with that of upholding the integrity of the Ottoman Empire to which reference is made in your letter of the 13th September, 1913. I am, &amp;c. 1.XX, W. LANGLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. I GALLED on Hakki Pasha to-day with reference to the Turco-German negotiations, and he took the opportunity of saying to me, under instructions, that it was persistently reported at Basra that His Majesty’s Government had, through their agents in the Persian Gulf, entered into direct relations with Bin Saud with whom a meeting had, it was alleged, taken place. This had created a very painful impression at Constanti nople, for the British Government had solemnly recognised that west of the blue line [2067 &lt;7-1]they were themselves in negotiation with Bin Sand and they hoped soon to reach a Now,^however, no substantial progress seemed to have been made with Bin Saud by the Ottoman Government, and meanwhile there had been great unrest on the Trucial Coast and near Muscat, there were fears that Bin Sand, if His Majesty (T Government treated him with coldness, would retaliate by forcible action against the tribes under our protection, and we could not face with equanimity the prospect of having to send a large expedition to quell any disturbances which flight arise. is and the fact that our merchants were damaged in their interests by being excluded from El Katif, made it necessary for us, from the force of circumstances, to address some communications to Bin Saud ; but we were so far from wishing to undermine the Ottoman authority, or depart from an attitude of strict neutrality to which His Majesty’s Government intended to adhere, that we had already arranged with Sn r. Oox to meet Hakki Pasha in order to have a full discussion. _ Hakki Pasha said he had no authority to discuss the position with Sir P. but he would agree to meet him provided it was understood that the discussion shou d be tentative and non-committal. The Ottoman Government meant to re-establish their garrisons in El Hasa, and they would deeply resent it if Bin Saud received any encour agement from us. I repeated that we were and would remain neutral, but we had certain interests to protect on the Trucial Coast, and we must also insist upon our merchants having access to El Katif as to every other portion of the Ottoman Empne . we had, however, heard it stated that the Turks wished to exclude us from El Katif even for purposes of trade. Hakki Pasha said he could not think that this was really the case, but he impressed upon me that the Ottoman Government attached great value to our formal and binding recognition of the Ottoman province of Nejd, for Parliament was soon meeting and they would have to make full use of this in justifying the many concessions they had made to us, with regard to El Katr, the Aden delimitation up to the Ttuba A1 Khaila, and the Turco-Persian frontier ; and if now they found that we did not in fact recognise Turkish authority in Nejd the agreements with us would be most unpopular : in fact the Ottoman Government would be bound by their engage ments to us, and we 'should evade our own to them. 1 impressed upon him very clearly and repeatedly that there was no question of any such evasion;—a situation of fact had arisen and must be faced, and for this purpose we wished to meet him in friendly discussion. If we had not wished to deal with the matter in this open and friendly way we should not have proposed to him in the summer to use our good offices to effect a reconciliation. The discussion was quite friendly, but I feel that the situation is delicate, and that unless it is carefully handled the Turks may make difficulties. Foreign Office, March 7, 1914.— Many 'thanks hor Sir P.Cox's memor- -andum about Bin Saud, I agree with him as to the procedure to be hollowed,but there are one or two little points as to past events which I do not quite agn- ee with. I will mention these when I meet,but I thought it well that he should know,behore we are in Hakki Pasha's presence,that I agree with his proposals Por dealing with the situation. Yours Sincerely,Ava^-&gt;- ^ in AUt^ust .last we explained to the i orte (or to jakki lEoha) that tin Laud, by the tact oi nii -aasumption of control at Katif and t jair and the coast-line of the connexion with the tj^inienance of the .aritime peace 9 the ?ince and coast of I as politically derelict* to nmst neeeftBarily hare relations with someone in : 'de facto' authority and the urks having evacuated tlie region we must deal with Bin Laud and were glad to explain the position to the??n The above communication was an obviously frank and friendly act prompted by our desire to act T*ith them in a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation. f akfci Pasha received the come 5 unication very favour ably tin August Ci)) and replied that the forte was already in negotiation with Bin baud and that if occasion for our mediation arose it would be taken advantage a1 • In spite of this friendly response by fakki Pasha we know from reliable local information that just after this exchange of communications, or conceivably juai before it, the lurke were endeavouring to arrange terns with Bin *. :&gt;aud, some of which were clearly directed against the British Government and British interests. Thus, accord- t ing to our information, the following are the conditions which the Porte are endeavouring to impose on Bin Gaud as ery disputes) s^ide it impossible for us to ignore .in Laud and pretend to treat the pi o-1 as the price of his partial autonomy; ( 1 ; The re-admission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Vaasa, as formerly• (2) The appointment of Kasi© and other judicial officers by direct 'farmaris ,, issued by the aultaru (5) The payment by Bin Taud of an annual revenue of 3,000£ Turkish. (4) The reference of all consnunications from Foreign lowers ofc their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. (b) The exclusion of all Foreign merchants and Agents from the nrovince. (6) An undertaking from Bin Baud not to give concessions to any foreign como&amp;nies for Hallways or motor car services. Incidentally, the Porte havo since informed ills Tajesty’s Ambassador (1st bee. 1913), that they had decided uo recognise the recent fait accomplji in ^ejd (Al Vaasa) by nominating Ibd S&amp;ud as fc.utessarif oi that district. i rhe first 3 of the 6 conditions above quoted do not refer to matters with which we are immediately concerned, but considering the frank communication made to Bakki iasha in August by ! is Vajesty'a Foreign Office, Fis ,Tajesty , s Government cannot but be greatly surprised at the terms of the latter three, especially (4) and (5) and are constrained to protest strongly against them. The only explanation of them would appear to be that the Vorte mistrust the assurances offered by fis ajesty’s Oovemment of their readiness to co-operate, aid fail to apnreciate the difficulties in which we are placed by the continuance of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs between themselves and Bin Baud. As tAs explained above in the opening paragraph of this r te# w@ cannot ignore Bin &amp;aud now that he is in occup ation of the coast line. ut there is no secret regard ing our requirements, that we require of him, for the maintenance 0 and protection of our interests is (1) That he should not meddle in the territory or poli tics of Arab principalities in the Uulf including Trucial Coast and hatur, (2) That like other Shaikhs on the Arab side of the $ulf he should co-operate for the observation and main tenance of the aritime truce; i.e. the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of intertribal hostilities by the passage &gt;f armed dhows at sea, (Z) That he should co-operate for the suppression of the Arms Traffic. (4) That British Traders should be freely admitted to Katif and properly treated while there. 'her© in nothing in these conditions/which either in •aud or the i orte can conceivably take the least legiti mate objection; at the aame time it is only natural that while emroMing his readiness to accept the obligations involved. Bin aaud should in return deeire the friendly offices of the British Government in the composition of his quarrel with the Turkish authorities, and should deter Shaikhs in relations with us from harbouring tribal enemies of his. , e had no wish to intrude ourselves but the terms of the conditions which, as we hear, the i orte now seek to impose on i'in ^aud, possess such an unfriendly nearing towards ourselves and are so impossible of acquiescence, that we are obliged to return to the subject. ie are primarily concerned to see the last 3 condilions— condition* (aa listed by me above) withdrawn, 1 » 2 1 we * ould also be glao to see a satisfactory arrangement come to with Bin 3aud by the Porte, under which as a corollary of their decision to regard Bin Saud as er officio ilutess&amp;rif of El Hassa, they should apnrove and take cognisance of his undertaking to comply locally oJbove. with our four desiderata detailed, and should by way of friendly co-operation with the British Govern ment for the preservation of peace and good order in the Gulf agree to refrain from hostile action by sea against the £l Hassa Coast, without first consulting us, and giving us an opportunity of friendly mediation if such be possible.From— J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. I Rave the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, No. T.-806, dated the 20 th December 1913 , a C0 Py the letter, marginally noted, which _ . . * has been received from the Political Agent at rJahram in regard to a request of Bin Saud for a pass authorising him to procure certam arms and ammunition. o action seems possible at the present time, but the letter / amplifies the |. c ^ * remark made in paragraph 11 of the enclosure to my letter No. 24, w %ated the 4th ; January 1914, while for an earlier notice of Bin Saudis relation to the arms trade : I would refer you to my predecessor’s letter No. 1669, dated the 26th May 1913.

India, Foreign Secretary^ Mo 4 M, dated 22 JAN 1914 'j $ I have the honour to report that in the course of a conversation at Ojair on the ! 16th instant. Bin Saud asked me if I could give him a pass authorising him to procure from Muskat, for the use of his forces, 4,000 Martini Rifles and Carbines, of which 1,000 should be Martini Metfords, with 400 rounds of ammunition per rifle. 2. In reply, I informed him that I had no power to grant such a pass, but that I would refer the matter to you. Bin Saud enquired when a pass or an answer to his request could be obtained. I replied that as the number of arms applied for was a large one, it was probable that the question might have to be referred to the Government, which would naturally entail some delay in getting a reply. I also added that it was possible that the answer might also be delayed by the question whether such a pass could be granted at the present moment, in view of his diffi culties with the Turkish Government, and of the neutrality of the British Government in the dispute—possibly the grant of such a pass might be considered an infringement of neutrality. 3. I am not, of course, in a position to make any useful remarks on this point, but I think that Bin Sand’s request shows that he wishes to co-operate with us in respect of the Arms Traffic, and (leaving aside the question of neutrality), I would respectfully suggest that it would be advisable to encourage Bin Saud to obtain his arms in a legitimate manner. Otherwise, he will doubtless attempt to smuggle them by sea or overland from Muskat; if he can obtain any there, or he may get them from Jibutil to some port on the Red Sea and thence overland across Arabia. 4. Bin Saud stated, and Captain Shakespear confirmed the statement from ! personal experience, that modern small bore magazine rifles are useless to Arabs in the desert, as the sand speedily makes the mechanism useless. There is also the objection of the impossibility of re-charging the cartridges for such weapons. For these reasons Bin Saud requires Martinis for his men, and for the same reasons the considerable number of magazine rifles recently captured from the Turks are practically useless to him. 5. I may add that Bin Saud gave me most explicit assurances that the arms were required solely for the use of his armed forces, and were not in any way for trade purposes and would not be sold. 6 . If the pass cannot be granted now, I venture to suggest that it mirht be given when the negotiations between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government are completed, or are in a fair way to settlement. C614FD T* .( ■ As:/2 No. 24, dated Bushire, the 4th (received the 12th) January 1914. From— J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Delhi. In continuation of my predecessor^ letter No. 4005-M. of 2nd December 1913, 2. In forwarding this report to the Government of India, I would remark that our position between Bin Saud and the Porte is somewhat difficult. On the one hand we have recognised as belonging to Turkey the province of Hasa, which Bin Saud at present governs as an independent ruler, and which he wishes to retain. On the other hand, it would be imprudent to shape- our action on the assumption that Bin Baud's retention of Hasa will be permanent or indeed more than tempo rary. At the same time it is impossible, regard being had to the local interests of British subjects and proteges, that we should continue to treat Hasa as a region politically derelict and having no administrative head with whom we can deal in matters affecting British subjects. 3. Every free bargain has two sides and must contain, if it is to be accepted, some element of advantage to both parties. With due regard to this principle a mutual arrangement seems not impossible, in regard to certain points, between ourselves and Bin Saud ; but in respect of the practicability of an accommodation between Bin Saud and the Turks, (and the outlook is less promising. 4 . Bin Saud is willing that British subjects should reside and do business in Hasa. He would protect them and would, in practice at least, recognise our right to represent their interests. It appears to me that, if our subjects who are desirous of trading in Hasa take advantage of his present disposition, a valuable point will have been gained by us, and that Bin Saud will himself benefit, and will be conscious of benefiting, by the mere fact that subjects of ours whom we trust him to protect reside in his territory. He cannot but be aware that he lays us under an obligation by encouraging them and that we on our part will seek every means of maintaining a situation more favourable to our people than that which existed under the Turkish regime. British subjects who are desirous of proceeding to Hasa are now being permitted to do so, and I am authorising the Political Agent in Bahrain to enter into such correspondence with Bin Saud as their concerns may hereafter necessitate. In this way, perhaps, one part of the Bin Saud problem will be solved without further discussion, and in a manner making it difficult for the Turks, should they subsequently reoccupy Hasa, to resume their former attitude to British subjects there. To consolidate the position, I I recommend that a Native Agent be at once posted to Katif to act as medium of communication between the Political Agent in Bahrain and Bin Sand’s local governors. The Turks could hardly obtain the removal of this agent if, on recover ing ’ Hasa, they found him holding an established position in the province. 5. Other matters which, it seems to me, might be settled directly with Bin Saud at the present time are that of his relations with the Shaikhs of Katar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settle under their protection. These questions arise from Bin Sand’s own position as an Arab Chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Bin Saud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Shaikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to induce them to restrain or expel refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence was shown to be injurious to Bin Saud’s legitimate interests. A reciprocal arrangement of this nature should now, I venture to think, be proposed to Bin Saud . through the Political Agent in Bahrain. 6 . The crux of the present negotiations is Bin Saud’s virtual request that we should intervene between him and the Turks in order to secure to him the govern ment of the province of Hasa on an assured, autonomous, and probably hereditary basis. Here it seems to me that, the views of the Porte and of Bin Saud being at bottom irreconcileable, there is small prospect of our interposing with success, and that we should, therefore, in the interests of good relations both between our selves and him and between ourselves and the Turks, not be too forward in our inter position. Bin Saud is, from the Turkish point of view, a very recent and only|V A '\ 3 momentarily successful rebel, and nothing can be offered to the Turks on behalf of Bin Saud, so far as I can see, which would appear in their eyes at the present moment an advantage worth purchasing by the concession to him of a single point. There can be no doubt that the Turks hope and expect to drive Bin Saud out of Hasa by force of arms ; if not now, then in the course of a few years. The best line of action for them is undoubtedly to maintain their claim to Hasa as a province of the Ottoman Empire and to postpone attempting to enforce it until they feel them selves stronger,—a line which they will in all probability follow. As time passes, however, if Bin Saud remains in adverse possession of Hasa, the Porte may become disposed to negotiate with him, possibly with our assistance. Three-cornered negotiations may then perhaps take place with some hope of a settlement accept able to both parties being reached, but at present circumstances are not propitious. 7 . In short the most expedient course for His Majesty’s Government is, I j venture to think, to take in hand at once, as indicated above, the questions which seem capable of direct settlement between their Political representatives and Bin Saud, at the same time informing Bin Saud that his position in Hasa is a question in which they can only mediate between him and the Turks with the consent of both parties, but that they will do their best to support him in this manner. In fulfilment of this promise if authorised an effort might now be made to obtain, in the words of Sir Percy Cox’s memorandum enclosed in his letter No. 4005-M., dated 2nd December, 1913 “ an undertaking from them {i.e., the Turks) not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Sand’s control without a previous exchange of views with us.” In making these recommendations, I do not lose sight of the fact that Bin Saud, if left to himself, may conclude with the Turks some arrangement unfavourable to British interests in Hasa ; but, should he do so, it will be open to His Majesty’s Government to take such action as is required for vindicating the in terests threatened. No. T.-805, dated Bahrain, the 20th December 1913. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to Sir Percy Cox’s letter No. 3669, dated the 2 nd December 1913, instructing me to proceed to Ojair in company with Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Kuwait, as soon as Bin Saud arrives on the coast, and to interview him there ; in reply I beg to submit the following report of our proceedings. 2 . As already reported in my diary I had heard (through Shaikh Isa) that Bin Saud would arrive at Hasa about the middle of Moharram, so that when Captain Shakespear arrived on the 7 th December, having been kindly given a passage on the flagship by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, I knew that there would be some little delay. 3 . On the 12 th December a special messenger from Bin Saud arrived with letters for Captain Shakespear and myself, explaining his delay in reaching the coast and saying that he would be at Ojair on Monday, the 16th Moharram (15th December 1913). I at once replied by the same messenger stating that Captain Shakespear and myself were ready waiting in Bahrain and that we would start for Ojair on the morning of Sunday, the l^tli December (15th Moharram) and if the ^ weather was favourable would reach there on the same night. 4 . Having obtained a “ boom ” through Abdullah al-Gasebi, Bin Saud’s agent at Bahrain, I accordingly left Bahrain on the moruing of the 14th December, but, owing to being becalmed for several hours en route, we only arrived outside the reef off Oiair about midnight. The next morning (Monday, the 15th December) when malang our way into the port a little before sunrise we saw Bin Saud’s camp beincr pitched on the sand-hills about a mile east of the Custom-House and Serai (the'only buildings or habitations of any description at Ojair), and gathered that Bin Saud had already arrived. I landed with Captain Shakespear at about 8 a.m., and we were received by Bin Saud with great politeness on the shore outside the4 a&lt; ti' //! i Serai. After a short interview in the Serai Bin Sand called for horses and we rode to the camp with him accompanied by a large crowd of horsemen, who on the wav gave us an “ ardtha ” or welcoming ceremony, which consists in galloping furiously to and fro in front of honoured guests, shouting, brandishing swords firing off rifles, etc. * ° u 5. Bin Saud told us that he had arrived about half-an-hour before we did and was exceedingly cordial and friendly. The friendly personal relations existing be tween him and Captain Shakespear, resulting from their meetings at Kuwait and in the desert, put us on good terms at once, and made our subsequent interviews easy. On arrival at the camp we found that Bin Saud had caused a very large tent to be pitched for us, and done all he could in other ways to make us comfortable inter alia by, getting one of the best cooks in Bahrain over and entertaining us sumptuously in Arab style during the whole of our two days’ stay. 6 . On the day of our arrival and the greater part of the next day, Tuesday (16th December), we discussed with him the points mentioned in the memorandum attached to Sir Percy Cox’s letter under reply. The result of these discussions is set forth in Memorandum I attached to this letter. After we had discussed these points Bin Saud raised the question of the policy of the British Government in Katar and Trucial Oman with special reference to their attitude in regard to enemies of his who might take sanctuary in these states and then use them as a base for intriguing against him, or as a retreat after inciting some Bedouin tribe to revolt against hini He said that of course he had not the slightest objections to fugitives from his wrath taking refuge with the neighbouring Shaikhs in accordance with the usual Arab custom, provided that they did not use their sanctuary as a base for intrigue • but if they did so he would be compelled to take steps for his own safety. The gist of this conversation is recorded in Memorandum II attached to this letter. ^ 7. After business had been concluded at the final interview Bin Saud volun teered to show us in confidence the conditions which had been proposed by the Turkish Government and himself as a basis for settlement of his future position The document he produced and read out to us was in the form of a draft agreement containing 11 articles five of which had been suggested by Bin Saud himself and the other six by the Turkish Government. The terms proposed by Bin Saud in sisted on complete autonomy for the region actually controlled by him special reference being made to his right to the coast-line and to the appointment and contro! of all local officials. The terms proposed by the Turkish Government laid down a partial autonomy for Bin Saud under the suzerainty of the Sultan with the following conditions :— (1) The re-instatement of the former Turkish garrisons in the Hasa nro- vmce. ^ (2) Kazis and other judicial officers to be appointed by diiect “firman” by the Sultan. (3) The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents of Foreign Powers. ( 4 ) All communications from Foreign Powers ' or their representatives'to be referred to the Turkish authorities for disposal. (5) The payment of an annual revenue of £T. 3 , 000 . ( 6 ) No concessions to be given by Bin Sand to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car services. 8 - ^ ?!• co i ldlt i lon ( 6 ) above some conversation took place, from which we gathered that Bin Saud would not be averse to giving concessions under British good^ffices ° U d hlS P0Sltl ° n be re ^ llaiized 01 in some way assured through our 9 . I would add that during the discussions, on more than one occasion, Bin ^ d made ^ cl e a r that h e would prefer that any reconciliation between himself and the Turks should be carried through under the auspices of the British Govern ment because he had no faith in the permanency of an} arrangement made,direct ly with that Turkish Government. ^ » 10. Before leaving Bin Saud sent instructions to his Deputy at Katif that he 1 iid permit British subjects to enter and trade and open shops, should they arrive5 at Katif and should protect them ; and that he should communicate with the Poli tical Agent at Bahrain regarding them should any questions arise. H-. hhe formal and private discussions which took place Bin Saud was I most friendly ; he seemed very much in earnest and most anxious to do whatever he could to meet the wishes of Government and to obtain their support. We repeatedly told him that the British Government could not give him any assurance that they would keep the peace, as he expressed it, on the Hasa coast; this of course is what he wanted, but he realized that it was impossible. The tangible results of our interviews with him were that he at once agreed to accept and protect British traders in Katif (and no doubt in other places on the coast should they want to go there) and to postpone making any settlement with the Turks until he marches north in the spring, i.e., for three months. Bin Saud also stated in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast states, and I think that Memorandum II shows that he has no desire to act con trary to the wishes of Government in these regions. Further , I am of opinion, f and Captain Shakespear shares my view, that there is not the slightest doubt that should His Majesty’s Government consider it desirable to use their good offices to effect a settlement between Bin Saud and the Porte, by which he would remain “ de jure ” ruler under Turkish suzerainty of the territories cf which he is at present “ de facto ' ’ ruler, Bin Saud would be only too glad to make a formal arrange ment with the British Government on the remainder of the four points men tioned in Sir Percy Cox’s memorandum, viz : to co-operate in the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, and in the preservation of the Maritime Truce. In connection with the Arms Traffic question I may mention that Bin Saud has made an application to be allowed to import rifles for the use of his troops ’.this is being dealt with separately in my letter No. 806^of the 20 th December 1913, but it shows, I think, that Bin Saud means to work with the British Government in the matter. 12 . In the course of cur conversations with Bin Saud we gathered indirectly that he would probably accept autonomy under the suzerainty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan with the payment of a trifling revenue (or tribute) to Turkey if necessary, as an acknowledgment of the suzerainty. Should His Majesty’s Gov ernment see fit to try and effect a settlement between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government, it would seem desirable, I respectfully submit, to take some definite steps within the next two months, i.c -.,—say before the 1 st March,— of which at least a hint could be communicated by me to Bm Baud before he goes north in the spring in order to save him from making some arrangement with the Turks which might be hostile to our interests. In the meanwhile if one or two British subjects who have been pressing me to allow them to go to Katif are permitted to go there, it will, strengthen our position in resisting the conditions regarding the exclusion of foreigners, which the Turks particularly desire to impose upon Bin Saud. 13. In conclusion I would observe that only Bin Saud, Captain Shakespear, and myself were present at any of the interview's at which politics were discussed, and I should like to say that the exceedingly friendly and cordial attitude of Bin Saud at the meeting was due to his friendly feelings towards Captain Shakespear. The latter’s knowledge of the language and ways of the Bedouin from Central Arabia was also most helpful and his presence was mainly responsible for any favourable results which may follow from the meeting. /.—Memorandum of interview with Bin Saud on 15-16th December 1913. In order to make his position clear Bin Saud began by giving an account of the history of Nejd, from his point of view, of which the following paragraph is a resume:— His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for gene rations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself was an Arab Chief whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European Powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighing the merits of different Governments as they five as nomads, and when oppressed move off to another lo cality. When Ibn Rashid attacked the Bin Saud family, the latter eventually won )6 through, in recent years he (Abdul Aziz Bin Saud) himself has been able to consoli date his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Katif. As ,s well-known these places originally belonged to his family and did not pass into the hands of the Turks by fair conquest, but by stratagem, m., by fomenting dis cord between two members of the family, Abdulla and Saud the sons of I&lt;aisal, and bv supporting one against the other. Eventually when Abdulla was successful the Turks in return for their help, retained their garrisons m the Hasa province, and actually took over the government of it, though Abdulla was made titular governor. After a' time the Bedouin Arabs finding that the local Turkish Government was weak and impotent took to indiscriminate raiding, thereby causing great chaos and want of security, while the more respectable and responsible portion of the po pulation became dissatisfied with the Government because it was unable to put a stop to the reign of lawlessness. In the meanwhile he (Abdul Aziz Bin Saud) was approached by Arabs, not only of the Hasa province but also of Baghdad, Basra and other places who were equally dissatisfied, and became convinced that the whole Arab world scorned the Turkish rule. Finding that the province of Hasa, where our word runs ” was being oppressed and bled by the Turks, and having been asked several times bv the people of the province-to intervene, he eventually determined to take the bull by the horns, re-occupy the province and ask tor the support ot tap British Government. 2 At this stage it was pointed out to him that our first object in arranging this personal interview was to find out precisely in what way he wanted the assistance of the British Government, seeing that he was aware of the friendly relations between the British and Turkish Governments and of the neutrality of the former m res pect of the diife 1 enees between him and the latter. In reply Bin Saud stated that what he was concerned with was his honour, the honour of his house, and the pre servation of his ancestral rights. He desired to renew and maintain the ancient friendship between his familv and the British Government and to have his position secured. He was led to ask the British Government for assistance because he had seen how that Government had dealt with Kuwait, Bahrain and other places and had realized that they were to be trusted. Bin Saud added that he wishes to have nothin^ to do with any other Power although he has already been approached by the Turkish Government. He feels that he must make some terms with them to sale- l guard his position, if the British Government disappoint him. _ He wants to know definitely what their expressions of goodwill really amount to, m order to be able to secure his own position. 3 . At this point he was asked to explain himself rather more clearly. He re plied that all he wants is to be left in peace, and he sees that the British Govern ment keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf except m this small section—the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the Maritime Peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as “defacto” ruler, he would be satisfied; if not he would have ‘To trust in his own sword,” He feels convinced that the British Government could secure this result by diplomatic means if they so desired. 4 At this point it was explained to Bin Saud that we could give him no such assurance, and moreover we were convinced that the British Government, in view of their friendship with the Turkish Government, could not do so either, as any such assurance at the present time would obviously be directed against the lurks. 5 . He said that the Turkish authorities had written to him proposing that he should come to terms; the draft conditions laid down that the ‘‘ status quo ante should practically be restored, that he should not accept any representatives nor subiects of Foreign Powers in his territory, and that he should not hold any com munication with any Foreign Power except through the Turkish authorities. He i sa id that he thought the Turks would be ready to drop all the conditions m the pro posed agreement except the questions of the conduct of foreign policy and of the admission of foreign agents and foreign subjects. These he thought, were their principal demands, and if he conceded them, the Porte would probably agree to leave him m peace as “ de facto” ruler -how would the British Government view such an agreement ? „ , . 6 It was pointed out that if. he continues to be the “ de facto ruler of the Hasa coast, it would be absolutely necessary for the local British authorities tohave direct communication with him and his local officers for the settlement o various commercial, pearling and other disputes, which constantly arise, not to mention the apprehension of fugitive offenders and absconding divers. British Government, therefore, would in all probability have to take P question of the prejudice to their rights and interests which the existence of any clause excluding their representatives and subjects would entail. 7 In the discussion which followed Bin Saud said he would be glad to co-ope- | rate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic and in the maintenance of the Maritime Truce, and would also agree not j to interfere in tire politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast and ' “^ub-, jects and representatives in his territory provided that the British Government would aive him the assurance mentioned above. In fact, he went further than j this and said lie would be willing to consult the British Government m aU mipor- , tant matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated to him h | it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. 8 In the course of his remarks Bin Saud pointed out that, though he claimed the Trucial Oman and Katar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his foil- there he was quite willing to meet the wishes of Government in regard to C HetntedSonly reafon which restrained him from overrunnmg Katar and possibly Trucial Oman, after he had occupied Hasa and Katif was desirc not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government. Q Bin Saud pressed the urgency of making a definite reply to the Turkis p o 1 «' a t an earlv date and said that correspondence had already been going on posals at an y ,. u „’ us t 1913 ) but that he had delayed doing so m the hope that His Majesty s ^ern mere ^ o{ the meetmg would draw working ,„n4».on. to «»lo meeting was nece ® sa ^ , • igin2 between his officers on the coast and local local disputes and questions a g the necegs of such a meeting ia reC o g - Bntishofficials. tact -' ve ^ f ge p tem ber (Shawal) last His Majesty s Gov- nised a f h s n ° d ^medIhe Turkish Government (through Hakki Pasha) that as he ernment had mtormea rue p • qri n u if the British Government (Bin Baud) had reached the shore ^ d for the protection of th( dr own inter- would be With him, while at the same time maintaining a striffily neutral attitude and desiring a speedy reconciliation be ween him and th Bin Saud reverted to the concluding portion of the previous 11 .

Bin Saud then be realised that the entire exclusion of foreign SpriseS—f U the Hasa coast was impossible at the present time,8 in fact it has already existed for years. Accordingly he proposed to reply to the Turkish overtures that the questions between him and the Turkish Government ap peared to him to be matters which could be better discussed at a personal interview, that he would be moving to the northern end of his territory in the spring after two or three months, and that he suggested that the Wali should meet him then some where in the neighbourhood of Basra. He would add (and would also inform his agents in Basra and Baghdad) that his recent meeting with British officers at Ojair had iis raison d’etre in the necessity for making some arrangement to faci litate communication between his officials on the coast and the neighbouring Bri tish officials in regard to the settlement of commercial and pearling claims and cases arising between British subjects (and proteges) and the local people; the apprehension of fugitive offenders; and the co-operation of his local officials in cases of piracy. 13. As Bin Saud was frank enough to tell us the lines of his proposed reply, we ventured to say that its terms seemed to us unobjectionable and asked him whether he had any objection to our communicating its general tenour in our report; to this he replied that he had no objection, but that he hoped that the British Govern ment would see therein an earnest of his sincere desire to arrive at a modus livendi with them, and would exercise their benevolent good offices on his behalf, 18th December 1913.

Note .—In order to prevent any misapprehension the note of our interviews from which this memorandum has been compiled were translated to Bin Saud, and he agreed that they were an accurate resume of our discussions. CONFIDENTIAL. II .—Memorandum of questions raised by Bin Baud regarding Katar and Trucial Oman. After the discussion on the subject of arranging a modus vivendi with Bin Saud had been finished, he said that he had another matter to discuss with us. He then asked us what was the policy of the British Government in regard to Katar and the Trucial Oman states. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters; in the case of the Tru cial Chiefs we had certain agreements of long standing regarding the Maritime Truce, the Slajfe Trade and Arms Traffic to which we held the Shaikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Katar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo-Turkish Convention, and said that we presumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference. Bin Saud said that there was a possibility that enemies of his might take re fuge in some of these states and plot against him and foment trouble—he instanced the case of his relatives, the Araif, who are now in Katar—and asked what the C.f., Bahrain and Kuwait Diaries, 1912-13. attitude of the Government would be in re gard to such cases. We said that we were unable to state definitely but would be glad to refer the matter to higher authority with a view to getting the point settled as soon as possible. He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people it might be necessary for him to take reprisals and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid. 18th December 1913.

I have the honour to report herewith the substance of ^conversation which recently took place between Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah and myself, as it may be of interest in view of the Anglo-Turkish Convention so lately concluded and of the Porte’s declarations therein recorded. The Shaikh may perhaps have exaggerated what actually passed, 'pour se faire valoir\ but I see no reason to doubt that the story has a foundation of fact. 2 . Some ten days ago the Shaikh’s agent in Basrah, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr, was summoned by the Acting Wali and after much eulogy of Shaikh Mubarak together with adjurations to secrecy, he was requested to inform the Shaikh that the Grand Vizier and the Minister for the Interior desired to discuss some secret matters personally with the Shaikh over the telegraph wire and that if the Shaikh could see his way to fix a day and time when he would be present in either one of the Turkish telegraph offices at Fao or Basrah, the ministers named would converse direct with him from the Porte. Abdul Aziz replied to the Acting Wali that he was sure the Shaikh would be averse to the suggestion unless he could be given some indication beforehand as to the subject of the intended discussion. On this the Acting Wali said the matter was secret but seeing that Abdul Aziz was already in the Shaikh’s confidence he supposed he might divulge the outlines of the proposed discussion. The Porte intended to appoint a Wali to Basrah at an early date, and the post might be conferred on the present acting incumbent or another but in any case the Porte particularly desired to obtain the closest co-operation between the Shaikh and the Wali, more especially in matters concerning the desert tribes and Nejd ; it was also intended that the Wali should be given orders to consult Shaikh Mubarak in any and every matter likely to cause controversy whether in Basrah itself or in the desert: in short, the Wali would be required to consult the Shaikh of Kuwait in all matters relating to the Basrah Vilayet and the Arabs in Arabia and would be expected to conform to his suggestions. Abdul Aziz is said to have replied that from what he knew of the Shaikh he thought it most improbable that Mubarak would agree to mix himself in matters so far beyond his range, and which might lead to his becoming entangled in serious difficulties with the desert tribes, apart from the tax on his time and resources which an acceptance of the position indicated would entail; he would, however, inform the Shaikh of the conversation. The Acting Wali then closed the interview with more eulogy of the Shaikh’s loyalty to and friendly relations with the Porte, pointed out the great honour conferred on the JSliaib.ky the trust reposed in him anj the Sultan’s desire toobtain his co-operation on so extended a scale and particularly requested that the matter should be kept secret even from the Shaikh’s bosom friend, Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan. 3. In relating the story to me Shaikh Mubarak said he had no intention of agreeing for the suggestion seemed obviously a manoeuvre designed to shift to his shoulders the unpleasant burden of controlling the desert tribes, in which the Turks had failed so lamentably, whilst he personally would remain always ready to their hand, should the Turkish authorities require in future an excuse or a scape-goat on which to fasten any further consequences of their own inaptitude. He said he had requested Abdul Aziz bin Salim to convey to the Acting Wali his appreciation of the honour conferred in inviting his co-operation and to say that he regretted he had his time very fully occupied with the administration of his own territories, people and tribes, that he was an old man, and that he could not presume to advise the distinguished officials the Porte might appoint to the charge of the Basra Vilayet, who would naturally be better informed regarding matters in their own province than was possible for the Shaikh, living as he did at a distance. 4. I thanked the Shaikh for his frankness in telling me the story and contented myself with observing that though the scheme theoretically might have advantages for the Porte I could see none in it for the Shaikh of Kuwait, but rather a probability of unending difficulties with the desert tribes, Ibn Rashid and the Amir of Nejd, the almost inevitable result of the equivocal position in which he personally would be placed ; that, as he well knew, the prosperity of his port and people depended very largely upon his maintaining good and amicable relations with the chiefs of the interior of Arabia.1 No. 4005-M., dated BusMre, 2nd (received 17tli) December 1913. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Ill continuation of previous correspondence ou the subject, I have the honour to report progress in connection with the proposed meeting with Bin Saud. 2. He having informed me that he would be returning coastwards after Resident to Foreign, telegram No. 1791, dated 23rd the Id^ul-Haj (10th November) I Wrote I intended to be at Bahrain on or about the 18th November and hoped he would expect news of his movements on arrival at Bahrain. The same day that I reached Bahrain however a messenger came in from Bin Saud with a letter saying that my letter had found him in Qasim at too great a distance to admit of the possibility of reaching Ojair by the 21 st November, hut that he was hurrying in and begged me to meet him on the 10th Muharram at Ojair. This it is impossible to do without missing the mail by which I have arranged with the permission of Government to proceed on leave, but if this meeting is to take place at all it is urgent that it should be brought off as s^on as possible, and I therefore instructed Major Trevor verbally to undertake it in my behalf accompanied by Captain Shake spear. I beg to attach a copy of my letter in that connection to Bin Saud and of the “ sailing directions ” which I have handed to Major Trevor, and I trust that higher authority will see nothing in them to which exception can be taken. 3 . X also enclose for the information of the Government of India a copy of of the terms which the Porte hopes to make with Bin Saud. It seems to me that the final item, if the report proves well-founded, is one to which we should take exception, if it is contemplated to leave Bin Saud in control of Katif and Ojair, and I therefore venture to recommend that a timely decision be arrived at as to the course we should take^ for the protection of our interests in case the present report, in regard to this item, is confirmed. The Government of India will not have forgotten the correspondence which has passed in recent years regarding the representation of our commercia in terests at Katif and the continued desire of British Indian traders to settle there. Our right to be represented has been recognized in principle and, apart trom the capitulations, there seems no reason we should tolerate atM^resh anmn- friendly compact between the Porte and Bin Saud, to the continued prejudice of our rights and interests in this connection. Memorandum setting forth the position as regards Bin Saud for guidance at the time of the contemplated meeting with him. It is highly important to have in mind to start with a clear understanding the policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Turkey resulting from recent developments of the general political situation in Europe and tbe Middle East; on which policy tbe attitude of Government towards the question of Bin Saud and his relations with the Turks is based. fa mil xt hn.vincr bpftn relfiS'ated to Central Arabia for the last 40 years October. to him on the 27th October saying that would make it convenient to meet me at Ojair on or about the 2 1 st, and that I No.C.-24, dated 18th November. a report from Captain Shakespear stating according to current rumour, tbe nature7 2 is a danger to our general interests in the Gulf and to our relations with the Arab Principalities, unless we have a working understanding with him. This is recognised by His Majesty’s Government. Thus the Secretary of State for India addressing the Foreign Office on the subject on 13th August, last wrote “ * * they (the Government of India) cannot afford to make him their enemy and they propose to enter into a friendly exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position. “It must of course he realised that Bin Saud, in return for a friendly attitude towards us, may ask for our support against the Turks. It will b e necessary then to make it clear to him that His Majesty’s Government, whil e willing to use their good offices to bring about a reconciliation, cannot under take to support him, but must maintain the strictest neutrality.” A few days later as the result of deliberation between His Majesty’s India and Foreign Offices, the following instructions were telegraphed to the Govern ment of India by the Secretary of State (on 21st August) :— /p. ’(xJJjk &lt;fj- )U i f luul Utt, J- 0 • “ The Amir must be made clearly to understand, if he asks for our support against Turkey, as a quid pro quo for complying with our wishes, that while we are willing to do our best to reconcile him with Turkish Government, we are unable to support him {i.e^ against the Turks P. Z. C.) and are bound to keep a strictly neutral attitude Later still, this time in connection primarily with the general subject of Eailway enterprise within Asiatic Turkey, the Government of India in making comment on certain aspects of the negotiations, telegraphed to the Secretary of State on 8th September, as follows :— “ * * * There can be no doubt from the point of view of Indian in terests, that a strong and reformed Turkey in Asia will act as a safeguard to India from interference on the part of Foreign Powers from the west, and might even in an indirect manner result in the maintenance of Persian integrity. Now that His Majesty’s Government have come to terms with the Turkish Government, as regards their respective interests in the Persian Gulf, they have nothing to fear from Turks and every advantage to gain from friendly relations with the Porte. * * * * The Government of India are there fore strongly of opinion that His Majesty’s Government should spare no effort to avoid any measure likely to contribute to the partition of Asiatic Turkey either at the present time or hereafter and that His Majesty’s Government should pursue a consistent policy of reforming strengthening and maintaining the Turkish Empire ’\ The above extracts indicate the policy of Government sufficiently clearly. As regards Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud and the imminent meeting. It is apparent from the correspondence with him that on his part he is primd facie anxi ous to establish relations with us, hut seeks a more definite exposition of our attitude in regard to his relations with the Turks than mere expressions of good-will and the declaration of neutrality. It has been suggessted to him that he should explain more fully in wbat way he would expect us to evince our good-will and in response to this he has replied that he would like to have a meeting with a British representative and discuss the position with him in person. It seems therefore to rest with Bin Saud to open the discussion by stating frankly in what direction it is that he desires the expression of our good-will or our co-operation. On our side we have explained to the Porte that now that Bin Saud has come down to the shores of the Gulf and controls certain Gulf Ports, he must be regarded by us as having entered the sphere of Gulf politics and we cannot ignore him but must find a modus vivendi with him for the protection of our own interests, wffiile at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral altitude in regard to the estrangement prevailing between Bin Saud and the Porte. It would also appear that we have expressed our willingness to promote a reconciliation if desired to do so.‘*nrr- — — 3 Hakki Pasha to whom the communication was made appeared to be grati fied rather than offended by it, and later on, apparently at the beginning of Enclcsur, to Foreign D.port^oot Endowment 0ctober i' 1 thanking His Majesty's Got- No. 2627 -e. a., dated isth November 1913 . ernmeut tor their friendly offer, he stated *) that the Porte was actually in negotiation with Bin Saud and would not fail to avail itself of their help if necessity arose. It may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our mediation if possible—meanwhile the meeting between Bin Saud and a British representative will he taking place. It is probable that in course of discussion Bin Saud, referring to Resident's letter No. 338 of 11th September and to our desire that he should refrain from interfering in the territory or politics of other Arab Principalities on the Coast, and co operate with us for the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, will revert to his previous suggestion and enquire whether, if he gives us satisfactory j undertakings under these heads, we shall be prepared to guarantee him immu- j nity from attack by sea. * Our recent warning to the Porte that they would not be allowed to use Bahrain as a base for attacking Bin Saud, amounts indirectly and practically to a partial substitute for such a guarantee, and if Bin Saud makes a bargain with the Turks by which he is confirmed or left in his present de facto position and if we can also reach an understanding with him, with the cognizance of the Porte, providing for ; (i) Non-interference in territory or politics of other Arab Principalities in the Gulf including Katar. (ii) Co-operation for preservation of Maritime Truce and suppression of piracy. (iii) Co-operation for suppression of the illicit arms traffic. (iv) Admission of British Indian traders to Katif as of old, and accept ance ffnecessar^ of a Residency Agent to look after them, it is possible that His Majesty’s Government might see their way, especi ally in view of the fact that Bin Saud's co-operation in suppression of arms i traffic prevents his arming himself, and of the practical impossibility of the Turks putting troops into Katif without using Bahrain^to obtain an undertak ing from them not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Baud’s control without a previous exchange of views with us,the result of which would probably be that we should be able to compose the quarrel. Lastly, it is possible that the question of Katar and the status of Bin Thani may come up in course of the discussion. In this connection I think it will be well if the text of a portion of the article of the Anglo-Turkish Conven tion relating to Katar is translated to Bin Saud :— “ The Imperial Ottoman Government having renounced all claims concern ing the Peninsula of El Katar, it is agreed between the two Governments that the said Peninsula shall, as in the past be governed by Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his successors. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declares that it will not permit the Shaikh of Bahrain to interfere in the internal affairs of El Katar nor to encroach upon the autonomy of the country nor to annex it”. It might be added that as the result of this agreement the present Turkish garrison will be withdrawn in due course. Dated 22nd November 1913 (=22nd Zilhijjeh 1381).

I have under stood your remarks about it being impossible for you to arrive before 10th Muharram 1332. I am very sorry that*it will thus not be possible for me per sonally to have an interview with Your Honour as it is inevitable for me to leave Bushire by the mail leaving on that date and it is not, possible for me to delay. But it makes no difference. Inshallah an interview will take place on the date asked for by you, between Your Honour and Major Trevor, British Agent at Bahrain and Captain Shakespear, British Agent at Kuwait on mv behalf, and they will be ready at Bahrain about that time, and will await news from your side from Ojair. In conclusion, I bid you farewell with regret and trust that a meeting may take place between us sometime in future, and that your affairs will prosper in the meanwhile. (Usual ending). % ...

Presumably these sums were paid for Saiyid Talib’s assistance in the nego- tiations with the Turks. &amp; The execution of the Qatif merchant, Abdul Hussain bin luma, has already been reported in my summary for the month of July. Dr. Harrison who has only just returned from A 1 Qatif confirms the account that Abdul Hussain’s letters to the 1 urkish authorities were sent to Bin Saud by Said Talib. It is perhaps needless to say that Dr. Harrison’s visit to AI Qatif was in no way encouraged by the Political Agent, Bahrain, who does not appear to have been consulted. Dr. Harrison, according to his own account, was very well received.^ He is enthusiastic about the improvements already effected in Qatif by the Amirs officials. Several old springs have been reopened and cultivation has increased. To a letter however m which Dr. Harrison sought permission to travel in Najd, no reply has been received from Bin Saud. I. have . the honour to state that reports received from the Political Agent. Bahrain writing under date the 25th July, mention that Bin Saud has paid to Saiyid Tahb at Basrah through Abdul Latif Mendil a sum of Rs. 20 000.

In this connection I would draw attention to Captain Shakespear’s letter to Sir a. nirtzel dated June 26th in which he refers to a loose kind of confederation between Bin 5aud and various other chiefs, directed against the Turks. It is possible that the existence of the negotiations in connection therewith; have either given colour to the report in question or have been deliberately misrepresented by the Turkish envoys in order to foster a notion of the complete success of their mission.

I attach a translation of this document and also a translation of a congratulatory telegram which accompanied it. This telegram is supposed to have been sent by Anwar Pasha the Minister of War to Bin Sa'ud. It will be observed that no mention whatever is made in the terms of the agreement of foreigners of the interests of Foreign Powers.3„ It is knov/n that Ahd-uI-Latif Mandil has recently visiteci 5in Sa’ud in Riadh, hut this solution cannot he accepted until some confirmation of the report has arrived from Bin Sa^d himself. Sir Mubarak is much disturbed at the thought that Bin 3a‘ud could have Concluded a formal agreement without consulting him, and has sent off a messenger to to Riadh to ask for details. Unfortunately he cannot return for some ten or twelve days, hut I will inform you as early as possible of the reply. 4.

To The Hon*hie Lieut-Colonel Sir P.Z.Cox, K.C.I.E..C.S.Io Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Sir, In amplification of my telegram T !o.725, dated 23rd June 1914, repeating to you the telegraip dated 23rd June sent hy His Mnjesty's Consul, Basrah, to the Embassy at Constantinople, on the subject of Turkish negotiations with Bin Se'ud, I have the honour to report that news has been received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the effect that Shaikh Mujbil ath Thakair, an influential Najdi merchant, resident in Bahrain, whose brother’s daughter was recently married to Bin Sa'ud, has informed the Political Agent, Bahrain, that he had Interviews with both the Turkish representative and Pin Sa’ud. Both parties informed him that an arrangement was eventually arrived at, 2. Shaikh Mujbil did not see theft ext of the agreement but he understands that the Porte was allowed to station 5 soldiers at each of the following places, •Cfjair, Qatif and Jubail to keep the Turkish flag flying but that no other Turkish garris/ons would be placed in passa or Najd, Bin Sa’jJ3 receives a monthly allowance of £ T 250 as ruler of Hassa. He collects customs dues, deducts expenses of administration and pays Turkey l/10th of the balance. I He XXX flies his own flag. Bin Sa’ud's prestige in Bahrain has been greatly enhanced by these rumours, It is thought that he hasagreed to exclude foreign traders and has been given M carte to blanche” against Qatr. On the other hand, fthe Political Agent, Kuwait has never heard any such story and apparently discredits it; I was myself inclined to do so on first hearing it, as I did indirectly before Shaikh Ifujbil reached. Bahrain, when lie was on his way from Kuwait. However the Political Agent, Kuwait, writing on the 16th June, agrees that further correspondence has undoubted ly taken place between the Turks and Bin Sa'ud but Shaikh Sir Mubarak professes that he knows nothing on the subject. A Kuwait report says that the Turks have agreed to X leave Bin Sa'ud in possession of Hassa and Qatif on payment of a yearly sum of money. As far as one can venture to make any prophecy on these conflicting rumours, it 'uuld seem that the Turkish envoys have failed to arrive at any definite understanding with the ' Amir but have patched up some va$@e truce v,r ith Bin Sa'ud, which the latter mil be fX/XX free to abide by or neglect as he pleases and u; hich they have misrepresented to Constantinople as a. binding agreement. The next few weeks should show whether the 'Amir will show any hostility to British traders and the only matter that affords me any concern lest the 'status quo' should be altered to the detriment of British interests is that Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah is not very communicative. I have, etc., Sd/9 S. G. Knox, Major, Offg.
