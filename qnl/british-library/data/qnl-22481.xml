TPE OFFICE OF THE AIR STAFF LIAISON OFFICER, BAHRAIN. 12th April, 1947* miBARKATION SERVICES - PERSIAN GULF. Air Headquarters, Iraq is negotiating a contract with Messrs. Cray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., Bahrain for the landing and shipping of Service cargo and personnel at Bahrain. 2. The rates quoted for cargo are stated to be controlled by the Government of Bahrain and are From Manama Anchorage to Manama Jetty (i) General Cargo Rs.7/8/- per ton (iij Bag Cargo Rs.f?/-/- per ton 3. The question of the admissibility of the rates quoted raises several points that require elucidation, and it would be appreciated if you would supply the answers to the following A. For what purpose does the Bahrain Government control the landing rates, how far these rates are artificial (for political or other purposes) and how far they bear a reasonable relationship to the actual cost per ton for the work performed ? If it is substantiated that these rates are artificial and provide, in effect, a substantial unnecessary profit to the agent B. Is the Bahrain Government prepared to negotiate any special landing rates in respect of R.A.F. and other Military cargo ? It is also advised that of the controlled landing rates payable to the agents, an amount of 5/o is payable by the agents to the Bahrain Government by way of indirect import tax C. Whether this is normally met by the agents out of the controlled commercial rates or is added to their bill as an extra ? D. Whether the Bahrain Government is prepared to waive the in respect of all R.A.F. cargo landed or shipped and if not, whether they have any legal right to insist on its payment ? In addition, an 8 annas stamp fee is levied by the customs authority in respect of every bill of entry E. Whether the R.A.F. is exempt from this local stamp duty in respect of imports ? 4 HoBoM* s Political Agent, The Agency, BAHRAIN. (P.R.M.W TT.T.TA MS) Wing Commander Air Staff Liaison Officer. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. .CONFIDENTIAL . No.C/531. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 3rd of May, 1947. To The Air Staff Liaison Officer, Bahrain. MEMORANDUM. (T \ j ' * Reference your memorandum No. A3L0/107/9/l/0rg. dated the 12th April, 1947. 2. Your paragraph 3.A. The Bahrain Government controls the landing rates because it has granted a monopoly to Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., for the landing of cargo from ships belonging to lines for which that Company are agents. Clearly, if these rates were not so controlled the tendency would be for the monopolist to charge excessively. It is not possible &amp;SLKxk (without full access to Messrs. Gray Mackenzies* accounts) to say, in any exact way, what relationship the present charges per ton bear to the cost of the work performed. All that can be said is that the Bahrain Government consents to raising of the charges with the greatest reluctance and that they are jealously scrutinised by the local mercantile community. B. The Bahrain Government have recently consented to an increase in the landing charges, equating them with the rates given in paragraph 2 of your letter. These rates were agreed upon, it was stated, to cover the actual costs of landing cargo and to allow a reasonable profit. It is possible that the Bahrain Government would be prepared to allow special landing rates for R.A.F. and Military cargo provided Messrs. Gray Mackenzie also agreed to such rates. C. The h'% is met by the agents out of their controlled commercial rates. D. The Bahrain Government would have to be addressed to enable a reply to be given to this query. The 5% is a royalty and it has a right to impose it. E. The R.A.F. is not exempt from the local stamp duty in respect of imports. 3. The delay in replying to your letter is regretted. ATTESTED.

NS.MB mm MTRAGT OF LANDING AGRK ia£&amp;jL-£jL M T hat the ships agents will pay to the Customs authorities a Royalty of five percent of the landing charges collected by them. In each Delivery order issued to the importer the ships agents shall enter the amounts of the landing charges recovered by them so that the Customs authorities may keep an appropriate account. The Royalty shall be paid to the Customs authorities at the end of every month. If it is proved by experience that this method of recovering Royalty of 5 % is inconvenient, the matter can be re-arranged by discussion between ourselves and the Political Agent on some better basis. In any case the payment will be monthly ,l ./ /^~/ /a t&gt;r / yhkyj , ^^' L ' 0 - rVo US’l- of/o 7 / y//t&gt;£ 61 ■ 0 '' Apparently M/s. Gray Mackenzie have felt unable to inform R.A.F. that they recently increased rates or that the Bahrain Government only control rates to the extent of fixing a ceiling. We may enlighten R.A.F. and dispose of questions A and B. The 5$ payable to Bahrain Government from landing charges is a royalty, though Gray Mackenzie doubtless pass it on to the public. Please see C|rt*le 9 of landing agreement - extract submitted below. Question C seems something the R.A.F. should ask G.M f s themselves. Regarding question D. The right Of the Bahrain Government to tax and levy charges seems axiomatic, but please see Article 4 of 1861 Treaty. We may ask them if they would be willing to forego the 5$ royalty on R.A.F. cargo. Regarding S. Please see pages 1 and 13 of file 7/5-A. The Stamp fee is not levied by the Customs where the bill of entry covers an article exempt from Customs duty. D.F.A.
