It is understood that the Khedive’s forth coming, visit to Syria was the subject of discussion. The Turkish Minister is understood to have left Berne in order to see the Khedive off from Zurich.

The Germans are stated to have lately sent Baron von Richthofen to tell the ex-Khedive that the past was '•forgotten and forgiven'. The latter is further alleged to have told the Turks that Great Britain had invited him to act as an Intermediary between the Egyptian Government and the Mussulman chiefs in Arabia, but that he had refused to do so. The Turks then, believing that he had real influence in Arabia, accept ed his offer to undertake a similar mission on their \ ■A! ^ behalf.

An attempt is reported to have been made at the beginning of October on the lives of a German Colonel and an Austrian Major who were proceeding in a motor car to call on Enver Pasha at his residen ce in Nishantash. Two cadets of the Military School fired four revolver shots at the motor car when it was passing iawim. The German officer was killed on the spot and the Austrian wounded.

The following information has been obtained from a friendly neutral and a personal friend of mine, who left CONSTANTINOPLE on the 15th October: 1 . When he left CONSTANTINOPLE, the Cabinet were discussing the question of oalling up all men who had paid 'Bedel” (military exoneration tax). I NVEE PASHA and TALA AT BEY were strongly in favour of this owing to* lack of menj HAL)L BEY was opposed thereto. Since then it was apparently decided to oall up these men, at least, for certain classes, (see report No.0 462 of Nov. bth). Originally the 'Bedel” was Turkish Ltq 43 for each mobilisation. This, a few months ago was altered to Ltq 30 per annum. (£27.5.5d.) In future no 'Bedel” will be accepted. 2 , All the 17 year old boys are being called up. Two Greeks of 17 years of age in the employ of the standard Oil Co. CONSTANTINOPLE, where my informant is employed l^o, were oallel up Just before informant left, and their offer of 'Bedel was refused. 3 # All Mohammedans from the occupied territories (MACKCONIA, DOBBTOJA, eto.) are being oolleoteri '.nd enrolled. Informant says a number of train-loads of those men were coming in to OOB8IABTIIIOPI1 from the dlreotion of AI 2 IAHOPIE, when he oame through. 4 . All the troops ^diioh passed through COBSEAHTIHOPLE from ASIA on the way to WlBi UDJA. oame across from HAIDAF. PASHA at5 . During June, July and August, quite a number of Austrian and German guns and gunners arrived at OQHSTAHTIJfOPIE and were thence sent by steamer to PAHDKKMA. Informant himself saw at least 30 guns, ranging in size from 6 inch long ^uns to 8 and 10 inoh Howitzers, Ho /runs have passed through OOH9TANTIHOPLE since the 1st of September. 6 # Ammunition, motor-lorries, wagons, war material and Red Cross supplies are coming through to 002 ;STAHTIKQPX£ daily at the rate of on© or two trains of fifteen and eighteen wagons each, per day, 300 wagons of chrome ore which were brought over from PANDFRMA and intended for Germany, have been stopped by the lurks at the frontier and not allowed to go out of the country. Coal of a very poor quality and in small quantities Is being exported to COHSW-HTWOPIE from the SIX HA district via PAHDKJ.MA., ZUNGUIDAIC (Black Sea). Coal la being Imported at the rate of about two steamers per week, steamers of 2/3000 tons, the prioe of this is £8 per ton ex quay. 9 . A good many of the British prisoners are being used on the BAOBAB railway: particularly is this the case with mechanics and submarine crews, 10 . 1'here are now-not more than 2/3000 German and Austrian troops, all told, in and around CONSTANTINOPLE. There were more some months ago, Especially wm this the case with officers. Three months ago, most of the officers were recalled and went back to Germany and Austria. 11. The 'GOFBEN' is generally considered 'hors de combat'. She has quite lost her speed, her boilers are badly worn, several of her runs are said to be useless, and she has never been properly repaired after she struck a mine at the entrance of the Black Sea end of the Bosphcrus. The 'BIXSL1U' still continues to scout In the Black Sea. and can do 22 to 12 . £3 knots.12, One. large submarine has been seen in the BOSPHOBUS during the last three months. Informant fe' Is certain that this is the U.52. (This is probably the same submarine as reported in my report Ho.01504 of Sept. 5th. Informant in that oase, however, reported it as being U.51). 13 , A very light single railway was built some months ago from Head of the GOLDFH HOBK to the BLACK SEA. 14, The oost of living is increasing daily: bread of a particularly inedible quality is sold to the poor at the price of 2 d. per fcilo loaf; this is black and made of maize, potatoes and a little flour. A 100 kilo saok of flour costs Ltq 14 (fl2.14s.0d.)• 15 , Ho wheat whatever is being exported from TURKEY and very little comes in from the Interior. A large American College in COHSTAHTINOPLE imported its supply of flour from BULGARIA. 15 . a new German Ambassador to CDHSTAHTIUOPliS was appointed, as the former Ambassador oould not get on with the Turks. Specific reasons were not given, but rumour has it that his difference with the Turks originated with his strong opposition to the Armenian massacres. 17 . jwo Englishmen from Smyrna, named tit ins on or Hadkinaon, father and son, druggists, were brought up to Constantinople early In October, haring been arrested for espionage. It Is stat.d that letters In Invisible ini re found In their possession and that th y hare confessed to the authorities. It is said that the father may be let off, but that the son will be shot. A Creek named iCyriakldes was arrested at the sam time, but he committed suicide or died on the way to Constantinople through Ill-treatment.BULOaIIA * 4? 18 17 year old boys are being called up* Informant, who stopped in Bulgaria for a day, and who o&amp;rae through t &gt; Switzerland with four Bulgarians (these were all 17 years of age) was informed by them that they had been called and medically examined, but being found unfit, were allowed to come on to Switzerland to continue their studies* They said, however, that they expected to be recalled at any moment* Hew recruit* are now receiving about six weeks training in depots before being sent to the front* 19 # In the first week of October, an aeroplane passed over Sofia and dropped one bomb near the railway station and a second boml which fell into the private Office of the Minister of War at the Ministry and knocked this to pieces.

Rumour had it, that when he was released, he was offered an apology by the Swiss Federal Council, this is denied and it is unlikely that there is any truth in this statement.

Reed. 15-11-16. to From our Representative with the Italian General Headquarters. rom the Italian Admiralty Intelligence Division, 6th Nov. : -- TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE EX-KHEDIVE and THE GERMAN EMTEROR. The following article recently appeared in the M TRIBUNE DE GENEVE’ 1 under the heading n Un vollier mysterieux et des millions pour tim soulevment en Egypte”. The following is the translation from the French, be^ne- 'A curious incident took place during the autumn of last year near the Egyptian coast in the shape of the cap ture of a sailing vessel on board which were three indi viduals who wanted to land secretly on African soil. Nothing more was then heard. Today we learn from a private source that the affair * is common knowledge in Egyptian-Young Turk cirlces in Switzerland, and that these three were concerned in some German Turk intrigue against Egypt. On the other hand we learn that the German Emperor is reported to have given, in 1915, two million marks to a Musulman Prince with which to create discontent among the Arab tribes on the Egyptian frontiers. By tUs means the British Army would be prcoccupiod at the moment of a German- Turkish attack on the Canal. The attempt failed and the- 2 * Prince, being faithful to the plans of 'illiam II, has incurred the implacable hatred of that monarch. The German Emperor’s displeasure has followed him to Swit zerland where he is actually a refugee”. The inner history of the above article would appear to bo the following. The ’’Tribune de Geneve' was iitpired by the secretary to the ex-Khedive. ABBAS HILMI as'ked Germans that a credit account should be opened on his behalf at the Deutsche Bank. The German Government refused, on the grounds that the ex-Khedive must render an account of the 7 million francs which were advanced to him at the beginning of the war. This sum was destined for two purposes, 2,000,000 marks being for Pan-Islamic propaganda in North Africa and 5,000,000 francs were to be used in preventing Italy from entering the war. as regards the second item the plan was to have been as follows:- Urged on by YEGHAN Pasha, his chief advisor who boasts of many friends in the Italian political world, the Khedive proposed to Baron CIRSKY, the German Ambassador at VIENNA, that YEGHAN Pasha should be employed through his Italian politital friends to secure Italian neutrality, for which the reward was to be the 5,000,000 francs. The German Government demurred but finally ended by opening a , credit of this amount on behalf of the Khedive with the ’’Dresdener Bank”. The money was drawn out by ABBAS HILMI and YEGHAN Pasha was sent on a mission to Rome. Nevertheless Italy entered the war and the Khedive who was then at VIENNA had to leave Austria in disgrace. To quiet the claims raised by the German Government, ABBAS HILMI had to repay 1*000,000 francs in cash to the Dresdener Bank.-3- Report has it that the greater part of the money remained with the Khedive and YEGHaN Pasha who to pre vent it being seized by Germany have deposited it in Swiss banks in the name of MdllD LAUSANGE* the mistress of the Khedive. The sequel to this move is that the lady in question refuses to return the money and hopes with this weapon to effect her marriage with the Khedive. The latter after much effort has only obtained from her 150,000 francs. Since the German Government has resolutely refused a fresh advance the Khedive is resorting to a species of blackmail against the German Emperor by means of the Press. He is in need of money to satisfy importuning Anglo-French creditors and to pay for large purchases of land in Egypt. His advisors have suggested this Press campaign in the hopes that the German Emperor will relent in his favour bather than have his secret schemes of Pam- Islamic propaganda exposed. It remains to be seen there fore whether tho present article be followed by ethers. Ihe Khedive is reported to have told his intimates that the continuance of the opposition by the Central Empires to himself would lead him to sign a voluntary abdication of his throne in return for a pension sufficient to secure him a decent competency.

I have, etc., (Signed) A. Henry McMahon.Translation of documents taken on Prisoners after the BIR MAHDAT Patrol ac tion. -£rj^_, copy of a let ter received from Egypt , In the name of God, the Merciful, the Com passionate, on behalf of myself and of all us loyal Egyptians, I beg to submit to H.I.M. the Great Sultan of Sultans, Sultan Mohammed, may God grant him victory, that our own Mohammedan Empire has more right to govern us than oppressors. We therefore beg of our own Government to relieve us of those people, who have no mercy on our young ones, or any respect for our old men. »Ve are a nation who are noted for our loyalty to your Imperial Government, and a people whose hearts are full of love towards you, and our religion bids us to obey and follow you. I beg hereby to explain that state of affairs to which we are now subjected. We are now in a state which moves the solid rock into compassion for us. John Grenfell Maxwell, the General Officer Commanding the frustrated British troops in Egypt, arrived and the first thing he did was to collect money from us by force, and he has even given orders to remove the jewels from the heads of women. He also ordered camels to be collected without paying for them. He gave his support to the foreign creditor against the native debtor without hearing the latter’s statement. Consequently all properties, buildings, and lands have now fallen into the hands of the Jews and Copts, the enemies of the Faith. Proclamations were stuck on the walls tnat Egypt has now become an English Protectorate under a Sultan.Sultan. Some of our men and our children were taken to the Dardanelles. Later the criers were sent out to proclaim that the country was under Martial Law, and the Military Authorities have the power to inflict capital punishment, flogging, detention, or deportation. In consequence of this, every man suspected was sent to prison and flogged. The Azhar Mosque, the great religious school was closed, the Ulema was insulted, and the scholars' rations stopped. Those who have been interned have the floor as their bed, and the sky as their roof. itfho is to come to our support? Who will come and relieve us of these oppressors? Our brethren in religion, were you to see the submission of the faithful to the pride of the infidel, were you to see the women of the faithful raped.*.' Vie await the arrival of your troops with impatience. Anger is smouldering in our hearts, like fire in the wind, when you come, we will support you. There is many a hero among us who would sell his soul for the sake of your victory. It is an honourable thing to die under the shadow of the sword of the Moslem faith. They have caused us many a trouble and hard ship. We shall never forget our children who have lost their fathers in the conquest of the Sudan, and yet it is called the 'English Sudan', without attributing any thanks to Egyptians. Can we forget the gallows of DENSHAWT? You know that you are the troops of God on Earth. He will give you victory over those against whom he directs his anger. We see that in these days the infidels are perplexed,perplexed, and do not know what to do. I saw all their fortifications. They are very simple, and could not withstand the attack of your advanced guard. Where is the energy of Islam? Where is the Arab valour? Where is the Faith? God said: 'Obey God, the Prophet, and your men of Authority.” Who lias more right to be obeyed than our Great Sultan, the shadow of God on earth. Consider what our Sultan has done in the Dardanelles. When the enemy attacked the Dardanelles in order to satiate his thirst for blood, our just Sultan provided the Dardanelles, and garrisoned it with thousands of heroes and brave warriors. They besieged the enemy by land and by sea, and defeated them completely, and the wounded of the Allies in Egypt have been clothed with the clothings of frustra tion and submission. Ask God therefore to lengthen the days of our Great Sultan, and keep him victorious for ever. The fortifications of the enemy can do you no harm, and their troops cannot stand before the troops of the Faithful. Have no compassion on those of them who ask for compassion, and have no mercy on those of them who cry. It is sufficient to see their efforts for preaching the religion of Christ. They have deprived us of the fruits of our homes, properties, and cultivable lands. They live in luxury, and we live in misery. Why should these people be allowed to use the people of God as if they were instruments or stones, as if we were but figures without souls? We, your brethren, are wrapped in the clothings of humiliationand submission. Where are you, People of the Koran? Come for our support; rise up, and break our chains. l£-Q.ur brethren, the Respected Arabs. !• This is a copy of a letter, received from a notable in Egypt, which he submitted on behalf of all the Egyptians who are now moaning under the oppression of the English, the enemies of the Illustrious Moslem Eaith. We publish it as it came, without adding one word to it. We publish it in order to acquaint all Moslems of the suffering of their brothers in Egypt. Where are those in whose veins flows noble blood? Take up arms, and rise up like lions, to rescue your brother Egyptians from the talons of the English Monster! Hereby our brethren in faith cry out for our help. Let us go to their help. Let us say in our voice •We are ready, oh Moslems of Egypt! We are coming, fear no evil.' Oh! Moslems, only think of the oppression of that frustrated nation; how they oppress and ill-treat El Islam; how they rape the women. Can any man, who has a spark of faith in his heart, hear of those atrocities, and fail to burn with religious zeal, and Moslem valour, and rise up to break the chains of our brethren the Egyptians? Yes! We will rise up, and God will be with us, and will give us victory over those infidels, and with the help of God, the Moslem flag and Ottoman Crescent will be hoisted over Egypt. 2. Amongst other things which show the atrocities and savage nature of the English, is the information *■ given to us by our messenger that an English force camecame out from KANTARA to BIH EL ABD. There they took as prisoners two men and four women, of those Arabs who are friendly to us. They were not satisfied with insulting and ill-treating the women, but raped them in presence of others. Such atrocities are not heard of among the savages of Africa. They are a mean and degraded race, and deserve curses from everyone. In order to show you the reverse of such action, we will inform you of an incident which took place at NEKHL before these incidents. Some women, whose husbands are friendly to the English, from the tribe of Medakhal, have fallen into the hands of our men. They were brought to the Port of Nekhl. The Commandant of the place set the women at liberty, and sent them back to their homes, and said that we are honourable people, and do not touch women. Our religion and honour prevent us doing them any harm. We are only fighting men, who are fighting for the religion of God. Just make a comparison between this incident, a.nd those caused by the English, who are the worst of God’s creatures, who show enmity to Islam and its people. Yes! they are the enemies of God. May the curse of God be on them, and on all who follow them!!In any further communication on the subject, please quote Na 191528/1 .

Sir, I AM directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that he considers it desirable to bring to your notice the general principles which the Egyptian Government desire should be observed in deciding claims to Egyptian nationality, as the treatment of such claimants as British protected persons must necessarily depend on the attitude adopted toward them by the Egyptian authorities. Natives of Egypt applying for British protection have hitherto been required to show that they were born in Egypt, that they are not domiciled in any part of the Ottoman Dominions, that they are not in the service of the Ottoman Government, and that they have taken no special steps to retain Ottoman nationality. Ihese instructions, which date from a time previous to the declaration of a British Protectorate in Egypt, attach primary importance to the fact of birth in Egypt, and lesser importance to the question of domicil. Under the new Egyptian Nationality Law, a person born in Egypt and still domiciled in that country is regarded as Egyptian absolutely. A person domiciled but not born in Egypt is regarded as Egyptian unless he leaves the country. This arrangement is of course of a provisional nature only, as the question of Egyptian nationality can only be deiinitely settled at the conclusion of the w r ar with Turkey. Its effect, however, is to attach more importance to an existing connection with Egypt than to the accident of birth in that country. For example, a person who, although born in Egypt, has severed all substantial connection with the country would be regarded as having been, immediately before the repudiation of Ottoman suzerainty, Bis Majesty’s Consul [2GG]2 an Ottoman subject not specialised as an Egyptian, and as now remaining an Ottoman for all purposes. Jews, Syrians, and Armenians trading abroad should not be treated as Egyptians by reason of their having been born in Egypt, unless they ha\ e maintained their connection with the country. The closeness of the connection required might possibly vary according to the nature of the need for consular assistance. Persons travelling with Egyptian passports in which they are described as domiciled in Egypt should be assisted in returning thither, irrespective of their place of birth. A person basing a claim to British protection on the fact of long residence in Egypt, although not born there, should not necessarily be refused assistance on the ground that he has no passport if he can establish the truth of his statements independently of such a document. It is obvious that the application of these principles, if left to the discretion of Consular Officers, would in practice entail considerable difficulty. The High Commissioner for Egypt has, however, expressed the wish that all cases should first be referred to Cairo, and I am therefore to instruct you in no case to issue a passport to an Egyptian until you have received the authority of the Egyptian Government. Copies of this Circular are enclosed for transmission to the Vice-Consuls under your superintendence. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, W.

The Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.Translation • In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate - Praise he to God and Prayers and Peace on the Great Leader, the Prophet of God and his Friends and followers. If you wish to conquer for God, God will give you support. To the Egyptian Nation It has been your destiny and bad luck that you, who were born free by the will of God, your fertile extensive land, with all that it contains of blessings and resources, along with your heavenly and omnipotent religion - that all these, should become subject to the ambition of an inconsiderate few (Crusade nations), whom poverty and the love of conquest led to your country and whose sole purpose in thus doing is simply to enslave the free and avail themselves of your resources. Yes, those foreign nations have gathered around you like hungry lions gathering around their preys and have exchanged and deal with you as if you were chattels or goods bought and sold in the market. They have enticed you with all the outward show and attractions of their civilisation, so that, ignorantly and blindly, you have followed them and, as if hypnotised by their allurements, you were led by them into dangerous ways and manners. Several times, distress and calamities have befallen you, which ought to have served as an example and reminder, and yet you have been all along negligent, reckless and ignorant of the consequences ofof such a conduct. You never seem to realize the motive of tills treatment. It is very strange that while you are numbered in millions and are the descendants of the great conquerors, should submit to such a life, the life of slaves, in your own country - slaves to a few of the nations of the Cross who have rushed on you from all directions with view of robbing and subjugating you. Ponder a little over the antiquities found in your land, which thousands of tourists come every year to see, and admire the magnificence and greatness of those who built them. These are the works and arts of your grandfathers before which those tourists bend the knee in admiration and reverence. And should any of the intruders tell you that you are not the descendants of those great men, just read over the history and it will tell you that Al-Sultan Saladin El-Aiyobi, the Sultan of Egypt, fought the Christian kings for tens of years with troops composed of your Egyptian ancestors, Turks and Kurds. And those wars, called the Y/ars of the Crusaders, terminated by the absolute victory of his armies over the Crusaders 1 armies, the defeat of Richard the Lion-hearted and the capture of Louis, King of Prance. And after all this has taken place, are you satisfied with the oppression and poverty, and do you like this life, over which death is much preferred, and can you always bear this ill-treatment which even a sheep would kick against? Do you do all this while God has granted you His mercies and gifts in abundance? You cannot stand all this unless you are absorbed in your pleasures, indulging in wild amusement and extravagance, for you dodo not seem to hear the voice of warning and your eyes do not see the actions of the wicked* Think of Prance, England and Russia - has any weak person ever been saved from their hands, and has ever a Moslem nation been immune from their evil, and can this concise letter contain all the wrongs and tyrannical acts committed by Prance in Tunis, Algeria, Morocco, Sudan and the great desert, for she has done there inexplicable things and your brothers, in those places now governed by them have lost both their personal and religious liberties, and have been driven to war in Europe like sheep, obliged in spite of themselves, to fight their brothers in creed, the armies of the Khalifat - which act has been pro hibited by God on all the believers, Por, what do you think of those who draw their swords against His armies that fight for the restoration of Islam*s glory and the liberation of all Moslem nations from the Western yoke and oppression? Is it possible to put down in black and white all what the Russian barbarians have done to 30 millions of the Moslems of Asia, and the least that can be mentioned of their deeds, consists in ruined mosques and abused souls? And it befits us here to throw a light on the acts of England, the enemy of humanity and liberty, the oppressor of the Islamic nations, and the destroyer of the Eastern civilization. It is also impossible for us to explain all her acts in detail, for the deceit and crime committed by her in her colonies are far greater than a tentn of the devil *s doings and of such subtlety and malignance, that Nero, Timerlink or Hulago would be ashamed of. And those who do not believebelieve in this, should visit India where they will prove for themselves the truth of these words; for there he will find things that would tie his tongue and hold him spellbound. There the visitor finds thrones trodden under feet, liberty massacred and hostility and ill-feeling prevailing among what remain of the once Princes of India, so that there is scarce ly any friendly feeling between any of them towards each other. And all this is due to England s activity in sowiiig the seeds of distrust and enmity among them. But, with all this, I cannot but believe that our brothers, the Indians, are now well prepared to avail themselves of this opportunity and revolt against this rule - an opportunity which might never come again. Let me then entreat ray brothers, the Egyptians, to avail themselves, as well, of this opportunity which God has sent them and save their country from the hands of this terrible enemy. 0 My brothers - You have been under the English occupation for over 30 years, and with what result? Before they entered your land, you had been living under a liberal constitutional administration, and the first thing they did was to deprive you of j all this blessing and to abolish your neputy Legislative Assembly. Your local industries were flourishing and your manufactured goods sold in foreign markets, but the English have done their best to fight out these industries as well as all your rich resources and revenues, until they have been utterly wiped off, thereby creating a state of unemployment to the people, and a great need for foreign articles even for the simplest manufactured goods and cloth. BeforeBefore this miserable occupation, your country was full of resources which flowed out to other countries to supply them with wheat, barley, maize, peas, etc*, out the intruders have been always active in alluring you by other things until you neglected this source of wealth, which in turn, flowed into their land to keep their factories going, and in a word, wished to see Egypt turned into one big farm for their home industries. They deceive you by improving the Finance, but all the good thereof pours down their pockets by way of salaries and purchase of Government articles, at exorbitant prices, from their country. They claimed having improved the irrigation systems, but it is you who had begun it before they occupied the land. Ask them where are the Egyptian weaving factories, which, had they been left running, would necessarily by the rule of evolution have attained such a state as to be able now to cornpete with the best European weaving factories. Or, where are the cap (tarboush) factories, which, had they not been destroyed by the English, would have permitted you now to export large quantities of those two articles, aside from meeting the country’s own needs for them, and the support of thousands of workmen and employees, who have become now idle frequenters of coffee houses and whom we see in numerous numbers everywhere. Ask those intruders and aliens, who sing the praises of the occupation in your ears - Where are the schools that used to exist in Egypt before the occupation and from which graduated great noted men, some of whom are still in your midst until this day. Where is the School of Languages and the Wiilitary SchoolSchool and what has become of the Sailors and Artillery Schools??? Where are the Schools of Engineering and Medicine where the students used to acquire those professions in their own tongue and which, if remained until to-day, under the auspices of a national Government, would have coped with the best European Universities* Ask them about the Navy which still exists in name only - and where are the 25 battleships which belonged to Egypt before the occupation? And where is the great arsenal for shipbuilding and repairing, which five thousand Egyptian workmen were employed on? Where is the Egyptian army and its Egyptian commanders? Where are the Egyptian troops who fought in the battles of Thrace, Macedonia, Russia, Greece and Crete, and who constituted an active member in the body of Islam? By these factors the glory of a nation is built and not by laying down modern streets or building improved fashionable quarters, or creating music halls and public amusement places, such as Luna Park, which tend to demoralise men*s character and sacrifice women’s honour and respect and I do not believe you have forgotten the many cases of evil done in those places. Before the occupation you used to walk free, masters of your own selves, owners of your own lands, with no debts or liabilities to encumber you, but now, alasJ the banks have absorbed your wealth and rendered you overburdened with their heavy interest, and toe English policy has reduced your elders and princes into inconsiderate beings fighting against everlasting poverty - thanks to the new laws enacted byby the occupying Government in order to have your wealth pass over to the pockets of the foreign money lenders and capitalists, and ultimately, to render you poor ana inactive, thus facilitating for herself your subjugation and obedience. You have become a by word and a subject of mockery for the foreigners. You have been granted by the occupation the liberty of sexual intercourse, thereby losing your authority in your homes and, thus, you became unable to protect the sacred honour of your wives, sisters and daughters. You used to defend the propriety and honour of your homes as a lion defends his den, but new, your girls have passed from under the control of their fathers, to follow the enticements and deception of unprincipled men leaning them down to the abyss of eternal infamy and shame, while their fathers stand back with folded hands unable to rescue them or revenge themselves because the new laws enacted by the British prevent them from doing so, and only content to shed tears over the shame brought upon them by the doctrines of Christendom. Before the occupation, national dignity and stolid character prevailed in you with a great dis trust for those who conspire against your religion and Koran. But now, why should 1 find you so utterly changed, after the invasion of your land by those despicable foreign races,even reduced to a state of servitude and considered as aliens in your own land? Look at the Sudan. It was you who sacrificed all that was dear to you for the sake of its reconquest Your armies and your sword, coupled with your millions of pounds, re-opened it at a great price to you. And when victory was attained and ohe oudan gsined overover once more by you into your legitimate ownership, the deceitful occupants sprang up and hoisted the English-Ottoman (Egyptian) flag and claimed a legal right of ownership in the Sudan* You were forced to accept those terms in spioe of you and thus surrendered part 01 your land to them* They left you nothing but claimed everything for unerase Ives until you came to be considered as subordinates while they became your chiefs. Have you never heard of the Egyptian soldiers in the Sudan? They are treated like servants and should not be called soldiers, but porters and servants. # Ask the liberal Egyptian officers about the doings of those criminals in the dudan. The occupation has sown the seeds of diversity and hatred among you, until you became disunited and antagonistic one towards the other, as if you do not belong to a religion, the principle of which is unity or to a country, the motto of which is union. The occupation brought into your midst a gang of Christian missionaries, who, under its protection and auspices, stand out auu preach their creed, denounce the Prophet of Cod (Prayers of God on Him) and blaspheme against the Koran. They even do not mind, after all this, to call you - the believers in one God - to believe what their Bible and Gospel contain of false tellings and absurd stories. And with all their abomination and blasphemy, have you been able to contradict or object to them by any words or deeds? You know your failures and understand too well that your Government is outwardly Islamic, but inward lyInwardly and truly Christian. Why should you then back out from supporting your religion and defending your Koran? And what has prevented you from rising up against those deceitful and atheists? With what power and solidarity are you prepared for them, for God says:- 'Prepare for them your utmost strength in men and horses, for by that you put fear into the hearts of God's enemies and yours'? How have you surrendered to them your moral and substantial rights, while God says to the believers:- 'Thou art uplifted and dignified over the atheists to fight in the cause of God, not fearing any blame'? on: Now is the opportunity and if you lose it, you will leave eternal shame and dishonour to your descendants after you. Unite and do not be separated. Let the Albanians and what has befallen them serve as an example to you - those people who were robbed, persecuted and severed, by the Europeans, from the Ottoman Government, the protector of Islam and promised national liberty, but now their land and all what they possess are under their mercy. They have repented now, but it is too late. You have obeyed the English and accepted their rule, thereby disobeying your Koran which commands you to obey God only and your own chiefs. You have been too quiet and submissible, and extravagant in your gifts to those despots, but they recompensed you in humiliation and subjugating you to such a degree that you have become like slaves and strangers in your own homes. Have you forgotten what God says:- 'Do not be low and sorrowful for you are high'?High'? Have you doubted in God's promise and he is most truthful? Have you forgotten the terror of Denshwai and what was done there to the old and young? Have you forgotten the days when they imprisoned your free and made them subject to all atrocities? Wonder! Do you really count 13 millions of Moslems and you bear to live so lowly, subjugated by a few thousands of English soldiers? Where is the dignity of Islam? Where is the religious zeal and the Arabic enthusiasm? Where are all your historic deeds? Have you forgotten the battles you waged against the Greeks in Mura when your great fleet supported the Ottomans in Navarin and would have crushed the enemies, had it not been for the treason of the European Powers and their fanaticism against the Islam? Have you forgotten how Europe incited the barbarous people of Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria to persecute and commit all sorts of atrocities with the Moslems of Thrace and Macedonia - and all that was done in the name of the Cross and Christ, and now they grudge those Moslems the least amount of equality, declaring that we are lower than those barbarians and unable to attain their human ideals and principles? My brothers! Have you forgotten what befell your Islam brothers in the Balkans when their massacred bodies blocked the roads and their blood flooded the mountains and the plains and their women fleeing in horror across the plains? Have you forgotten when they pierced the pregnant women with their lances, when they dragged your old men to the scaffold, your young men to the gravesri'i graves and your virgins into infamy? I wonder why you have been so much led by illusions so as to believe that the English possess an indomitable fleet and great armies that would stand unconquered in the face of destiny, and a King &lt;vhom day and night obey. You are misled and deceived, for this war has shown that the English are the weakest of nations, unable even to defend their ov/n islands for their enemies. England declared war against Germany and everyone thought that the day of resurrection was at hand and the English battleships, f which count over 600, would disturb the whales in the ocean and the angels in heavers and would reduce, with the fire of their guns, the mountains into ashes and would take all means to make her enemies die of famine and misery. These were all fancies and illusions, hut what has time proved? You read daily the war news. Have you heard of one single victory achieved by the English fleets? Or have their armoured battleships been immune from the submarines and mines of their enemies? Don^ you read of what destruction their battleships every day in the Dardanelles meet with? Haven’t you heard of what befell their troops in Gallipoli (the cemetery of the English)? They had hoped to enter Constantinople (Dar el-Khilafat) within two weeks, hoist the cross on the great dome of the Aga Sofia mosque and drag the Sultan of Islam down from his throne, but you know what loss they have met with during the four months they spent before the impregnable forts of the Dardanelles and its big guns. You have seen with your own eyes how they filled your country with their wounded. Ask the seas about their killed and drowned. 0] The failures and defeats of the English fleet have becomebo numerous, as to leave an everlasting dent of shame on England and an example to other nations. All England’s strength had been an illusion, otherwise show us one event where she proved to be powerful in the efficiency of her officers or the discipline and bravery of her soldiers, or once where her fleets could protect themselves whether in narrow seas or wide oceans. Oh Egyptian brethren! *ie , who are your brethren in Islam, feel grieved to see that we enjoy religious liberty and administrative independence, which are granted us by Imperial Firmans, whilst the English break their covenant with you and attach to their dominions your country, Egypt, which is the flower of God on Earth and the key of Holy Land, after they have repeatedly given promises and covenants that they have no ambition in your country. We feel grieved to see the leader of Christianity and the enemy of Islamic nations having the rule over the key of the noble Haramain and of the road to the lord of all creatures. We have, therefore, trusted in God and made our resolution to offer you help in arms and men, and our troops will, by the help of God, enter your country and get into your towns and villages. We have warned them not to transgress on their Moslem brethren and be straight with the Copts of Egypt as long as the Copts are straight with them and fulfilling their first covenant with Islam; but if they break their covenant, they will be treated accordingly. Let it also be known to you that our troops will help you to regain your properties, cultivable lands and buildings, from the usurers.uQ have instructed our troops and. those Egyptians who join them that they should attack the subjects of those i-owers now fighting El-Islam and the Power of the Grand Khalifat - take hold of all their possessions - money, properties and furnitures and to pursue and kill them wherever they find them. But neither you nor our troops should kill an infant v a woman or an old man or a monk who secludes himself for the worship of God. And he of them, who gives up his arms to you, you should not kill but take as prisoner until the war is over. All the booty you take shall be yours and shall be distributed amongst you by the senior officers who are commanding our troops in accordance with the Mohammedan law, some as did our Prophet in his con quests. Should any of the Moslems help your enemies against you, or should he reveal to them any of your secrets, he should be treated as a spy and a traitor. ue are still in war with the Italians who have transgressed on us and no peace or truce has yet been concluded with them. Therefore, and as they have treacherously declared war on the grand Khalifat, in order to please the English, the French and the Russians, the lives, properties and furniture of Italians also in Egypt, are your own property and the property of those Egyptian heroes who join our troops. All other inhabitants of Egypt ought not to be molested, and he who molests any of them will be acting against our wish and order and the will of uod and prophets. This is a proclamation to all Moslems in Egypt and the Sudan and an order to the fighting heroes of the Jehad, from the ’’Senoussi Family*.N.I.D. 3728 1675 The Director of the Intelligence Division presents his compliments to the Under Secretary of State for India, and begs to forward, for his infor mation, the attached copy of a translation of a captured Turkish Proclamation, Copies have also been sent to the Foreign Office, War Office, Coramander-in-Chief, East Indies, and Vice-Admiral, Eastern Mediterranean, Admiralty War Staff, Intelligence Division, 15th December, 1915JL \0X N 4675 !9i 1. In the r^ne of God, the Merciful, the compassionate. Praise be to God and prayer and salutation to the mightiest leader the Prophet of God, his companions and such as follow him. 'if you seeh victory, victory is at your hand”. r Psople of Egypt, You are assailed by the wiles and schemes of treacherous nations of the Cross, to the end that your wide and glorious land, your sweet and blessed rivers, your exalted and pure religion, your own persons which God declared free the day you were bom - that all these may become a pledge in the hand of certain nations of Christendom, whom need and hunger have thrown upon your land, whom your own natural generosity has encouraged to seefc dominion over you. To-day they are in your country with no intent but to turn your freedom to slavery, your glory to abasement and to seize for themselves the good things you possess. Nay, they have fallen on you like hungry beasts upon the prey, they portion you out like goods and chattels in the market place; you are become their spoil and plunder. They seek to beguile you with the show of their spurious civilisation and blind your eyes with their evil inventions, that they may rule over your hearts and numb your sensibilities and lead you in painful and pernicious paths. Thoughtlessly you submit, blindly you follow their guidance; despite successive warnings and continued disaster M you still stand heedless and bemused', you are ignorant of the vicissitudes to come,2. come, you never reflect for » moment on your enemy's treachery and sinister designs, you, who are millions in number and are descended from the mightiest of victorious warriors, v/iu you be pleased to live humiliated in your own country, slaves to tyrannous and rapacious Christians wno upon you from svsry sid. 9 ? Lift up your eyes to the ancient monuments in your Imd. The thousands of travellers who visit them yearly bow in adoration, lost in wonder at the science and know ledge of your forefathers of old. Detractors and evil hearted men among your enemies may deny this noble lineage. But if you examine the books of history, you will know that Saj^ ad-Din a]-Aiyubi, Sultan of Egypt waged war for decides with armies drawn from your Egyptian ancestors and from the Turks and Kurds. Those conflicts which men call the crusades, ended in the victory of the Sultan's arms over the combined forces of the Franks, the overthrow of Richard the Lion-hearted and the capture of King Louis of France. Will you accept humiliation and abasement, will you be content with an existence worse than death, will you endure a tyranny intolerable even to the beasts of the field? Will you do all this after God has bestowed on you all his gifts; after He has overwhelmed you, as no other nation with His bountiful and glorious mercies? How can I behold you plunged in pleasures and obedient to base desires, your ears deaf to cries of warning and your eyes blind to the deeds of them that work iniquity! France, England, Russia - are the weak ever safe from their hands? Has any Muhammadan people ever escaped their cunning? How can this brief space contain the list of infamies France has done, the injustice she has practised in Tunis3. Tunis, Algiers, Morocco, the Sudan and the Sahara? Nay, her deeds are beyond description and beyond number. Even now your brethren in Morocco under French rule are bereft of their personal and religious freedom. Driven like cattle to the battlefields of Europe, they are forced to fight their brothers of the Faith, the armies of the Caliph of Islam, whom to oppose or disobey is forbidden by God to all true believers, what think you of anyone who draws the sword against the Caliph's armies which are fighting to restore the glory of Islam and set its lamp on high and free the Muhammadan nations from the tyrannous yoke of the West? As for the barbarians of Russia no pen can describe how they have dealt with thirty million Muhammadans in Asia The lightest traces of their influence there are ruined mosques, minds distraught, and human souls held in low esteem as though their value was nothing. Here we would put together some facts concerning the doings of England, that enemy of humanity, warring against freedom, trampling down Muslim countries, destroying the civilisation of the East. What a tale we have to tell! In treachery and crime the Devil and his hosts could not achieve a tenth part of what England has done in her Islamic possessions neither could Nero or Tamerlane or Hulagu vie with her, though the iniquity of these in the earth was great enough. Let anyone go to India and there he will see appalling and » r frightful things which no tongue can utter - kingdoms over thrown and freedom done to death, the few remaining Indian princes consumed with mutual hatred and jealousy, no two of them living in accord - and »11 the result of British intrigue. There—4. Therg you win find t,h 9 blight of oppression «nd grinding tyrsnny, the heirs of glory enslaved, the sons of chieftains in bondage. I doubt not that our brothers in India are this day prepared to spring, ere ready to seize the opportunity which time may never again bestow, i can upon my brethren the Egyptians at this critical moment which the Lord has ordained for the rescue of their l^nd from those manifest enemies. Brothers, you hsve been in the toils of the English ^ccup^tion more then 30 ye^rs *nd whet is the result? ’Then the Pnglish landed in your country you were enjoying freedom and constitutional government. Their first act of oppression was to take away this privilege and abolish your tribunals established by popular vote. Your native manu factures were flourishing and prospering in all markets, but the English made ceaseless war on this the staple of your life and source of your subsistence, till at length your manufactures stopped, unemployment increased, and you became dependent on foreign countries for the most paltry manufactures ^nd simplest textiles. Before that baneful occupation, your country was full of good things, abound ing in fruits, supplying many nations with the produce of its soil - wheat, barley, maize and beans; but the invaders went on deceiving you and cajoling you to make a change, not at all from love of you or the desire to help or enrich you; their aim was to make the whole of agricultural Egypt tributary to their factories and workshops. They claim to be doing you a favour by putting your finances in good order, but all the good of it returns to their own pockets by way of official salaries and employees wages and in5. snd in buying their necessities from England at exorbitant prices. They claim also to have improved your irrigation, but you yourselves had started upon that worfc before they arrived. Ask them what bas happened to the tread factories of Sgypt, which if they had been left alone would by natural development have rivalled the factories of Europe. That has become of the works where tarbushes were made and the sugar factories? Had not the English spoiled them, you to-day would be profiting by the export of vast quantities of these goods besides supplying the home demand and giving shelter to thousands of workmen and servants who are now lying about idle in coffee houses over the length and breadth of the land. Ask those who defend the occupation of your land by these foreigners, v/hat has become of the old Egyptian centres of learning which produced those distinguished scholars, of whom but a few remain in your midst, and what has been the fate of the military, naval and gunnery schools, where are the schools of medicine and geometry at which the pupils used to study in their native language, and which if they had survived till now in the shelter of a native government, would rival the greatest universities of Europe? Ask them what has happened to the navy of which nothing is left but the name, those 25 ironclads Egypt had before the occupation, and the shipyard which used to employ five thousand Egyptian workmen building and repairing steamers and ships of war. ''here is the Egyptian army with its Egyptian commanders? Where are the Egyptian forces who fought under Egyptian generals in the wars with Rumelia, Russia, Greece and Crete as an active number of the body of Islam? Verily the glory and honour of the nation cannot be built6. built except on these foundations, it does not depsnd on the building of cssinos »nd theatres, the laying out of streots, the planning of squares, and pleasure gardens like the Lunar Park where morals are corrupted and the chastity of women and youths is destroyed, and ai] kinds of vice and iniquity is practised as I am sure you know perfectly well. Before the hated occupation you went about in freedom and happiness; you were the lords of your country an&gt;i the owners of your fields; you were not then burdened with debts or a prey to money-lenders. But how do you find yourselves to—day? The banks have eaten up your wealth and property and bent your backs under a load of interest. British policy has condemned many of your leaders and mighty men to sad distress and perpetual poverty. This is the virtue of those baneful laws which the new government lays down to the injury of the native population. Your wealth is taken away and dispersed among usurers and foreign owners in order that you, having become impoverished, may be the more easily seduced and humbled. You are become a morsel in the mouths of men and a target for the contempt of foreigners. The English have granted you immoral license with the result that you have lost authority in your homes and have no power to protect your household and defend your daughters. Time was when each one of you would have battled for the honour of his house and family like lions for their lairs. But now the cloistered virgin slips from her father's hands, seduced by promoters of crime and corruption to haunt houses of evil fame, and the poor father whose happiness has been ruined and his life embittered by this so-called English freedom may do nothing but look at his hands and weep and endure1 7. endure all the sh^rae and disgrace that Christianity has heaped upon him. Thus are you stricken hy the disaster of English occupation, each of you jealous for his morals and filled with hatred of those who are subverting your religion and your Koran. Once you held sway in your own land, but how do you fare to-day? Your state is quite the opposite, for base men now are wielding the power, while you live as strangers in your native country, servants of the invader. The English wrenched the Sudan from you after sedition and lawlessness had there devoured thousands of your sons. They took it back (from the Mahdi ) by means of your guns and swords and the sacrifice of your dearest blood and the millions of pounds you spent in sending an expedition there After the victory was yours and the country again under your power, those treacherous invaders hoisted the English flag over it instead of the holy flag of Turkey (or Egypt), claiming that the Sudan was theirs by legal right which you must perforce recognise. You accepted this in humility and were compelled to surrender to them your country. If they had even made a just division and given you some of the profits and official posts in the Sudan, however few. But no, they seized everything for themselves, so that now they are the lords and you their servants. You are told of those regiments of the Egyptian army who are compelled to serve under the English in the Sudan, how they merit the name of porters or menials rather than soldiers. You need only ask any unbiassed officer in the Egyptian forces to know how those English scoundrels behave in the Sudan. The occupation has also fostered enmity and hatred amongst yourselves until relationships of kindness and consideration between man and man have been cut off, and you8. you live ss strangers to one another, as if you had not a religion founded on the divine Unity, as if you were not bound together by a common nationality, whose watchword is '’There is One God'. The English send among you missionaries of the Cross preaching Christianity. They take them under their wing and protect them by word and deed, at the same time inciting them against the Muslims and urging them to attack the true religion; consequently none of these missionaries hesitate to stand up in this Muslim country and, in the midst of a Muhammadan company, blaspheme the Prophet of God as they wish, and revile the noble Koran to their hearts' content. This done, they wil] actually try to win over followers of the One God and His Omniscient word to the teaching of their falsified Torah and their garbled Gospels full of shallow and nonsensical stories. Prom those offensive missionaries you endure all kinds of slander and ridicule, insult and obscenity, but are you able to redress those wrongs either by physical force or words of remonstrance? You know well that the cause of your impotence is your submission to a government which is Muhammadan in outward form but a Christian and alien thing at heart. Why then will you not vindicate your religion and defend your Koran from injustice? what should restrain you from combating these liars and getting to grips with the infidels? What strength and might are you preparing against them in accordance with the word of God. 'And prepare ye against them the utmost of your strength, and if ye have horses, affright the enemy of God and your enemy with them'. How can you submit to them and give them the management of your affairs, when God, describing thethe Believers has spoken thus: 'Vanquishing the infidels, they fight in the path of God and fear not the reproach of ny ? Surely your opportunity is come: see that you do not lose it, for thereby shame and disgrace would be registered in history against your generation and you would do posterity an everlasting wrong. Do not become separated, but stand firmly together. Take a warning from the fate of Albania. She fell into the hands of plunderers after other nations of Europe had deluded her into dreams of independence in order that they might separate her from the Imperial Ottoman Government, the protector of Muslim communities; and now Albania repents when repentance is of no avail. f You submit to the laws of the English and obey their commands and prohibitions, thereby disobeying your Koran which charges you to obey no one acicept God and his Apostle and those who are placed over you in legitimate authority. You are far too meek and submissive; in the matter of your country's wealth and your own favours you make too many concessions to those tyrants. They reward you by despising your advances and holding you in contempt, believing you » • weak spirited. Though you are their neighbours you are strangers in your native land and suffer humiliation by your own firesides. Have you never pondered on the word of God: 'Grieve not nor despair, for ye shall be exalted?' Do you doubt the word of God who is the most true Speaker, or do you suspect the promise of Him who is the most cer tain to fulfil? Have you forgotten the horrors of Dunshuwa and what these cruel tyrants did there to old bowed men and innocent boys? Have you forgotten the days when they seized your free brethren and cast them into dungeons, there to suffer the agonies of death? I marvel0 10 . you, thirteen .millions in number, content with a life of slavery in your native land under the domination of a few thousand English soldiers, where is the old valour of Islam. Where is your religious pride, your Arabian honour, your traditional glory? Have you forgotten the days when you destroyed the Creefcs in the Peloponnesus and the occasion when your mighty fleet would have assisted the Imperial Government in Hafarin, but for the European powers and their common hatred of Islam and the Muslims? Do you not, remember how ^urope incited the worst of her barbarians- Montenegrins, Greeks and Bulgar s - against the Muslims of Rumelia, how she urged i^hem to destroy those Muslims «nd commit atrocities amongst them in the name of the Cross and t,o the glory of Christ? Not only do your enemies in ^urope dsny you the smallest measure of equality and freedom, but they dare to assert that we are lower than tnose barbarians of the Balkans and can never attain their standard of humanity. Have you forgotten the days when your brother Muslims in the Balkans were decimated till the ways were choked with their corpses, the mountains and plains drenched in their blood and the freeborn daughters of your people scattered over the land, or how women with child were ripped up and unborn babes destroyed with the sword? Have you forgotten how those haughty infidels drove weak old men to the shambles and the innocent young to their graves and your pure women to unnamable abominations? You know how you were influenced by their propaganda and their lies, till you believed that the British fleet could conquer Destiny, that British armies could cover the whole e«rth and annihilate night and day with their mighty strength. The truth of the matter is now made terribly plain.plHin. This ^uropsan w^r has revealed that the English are hopelessly impotent even to defend their own island and guard their seas against aggression, when England declared war on Germany, men thought, that the Judgment Day was coming, that the 600 ships of the British navy would torment the monsters of the deep and the angels in Heaven, that they would destroy mountains and nations with a deluge of fire, that they would close in on their enemies and hold them in thrall and leave them a heritage of pain and misery, so ran the fancies and speculations of men, but what has time revealed? Among the war news that you read daily do you ever find a single victory to the credit of the British ^leet? Are their warships ever safe from enemy submarines and their torpedoes? Do you not read how their dreadnoughts are daily sun* and destroyed in the Dardanelles and the disasters their troops are suf fering in Gallipoli, that grave of Englishmen? They boast ed that they would enter Constantinople in a couple of weeks and raise the cross over the dome of the Ay a Sofia, that they would arrest the Sultan in his own capital and cut the caliphate at the root. But after four months spent before the impregnable forts and mighty guns of the Dardanelles they have achieved nothing but the destruction of their ships and the wastage of their armies. You have seen them fill your land with their wounded men; you may ask the ocean about their drowned and slain, continued disappointment and disaster has been the portion of the British fleet, till now the shame and disgrace of that nation is a byword everywhere. Their greatness is discover ed to be purely fictitious and their strength mere words. If this is not so, point out to me any country where, after a full year of warfare, the English have a single achievement to their12 . to their credit, despite the shill of their leaders and the boasted valour of their airoies; or tell me of any sea in the world where their greet fleet can find security. Men of ygypt, now is the time for freedom, now is the hour of salvation; now is the opportunity to defend your religion and rescue your fatherland, you need not fa»r the government of occupation now, for it is fully occupied elsewhere; you need not dread the power of Bri- i.ain, for the slightest movement on your part would bring its whole structure tumbling down, you are Muslim warriors numbering tens of millions; with determination and unity you could work miracles; you could challenge the mightiest powers in battle, especially since you hold the Suez Canal / which is lifce the heart or throat of your enemy. The only opposition is a few thousand trembling cowards; what poor stuff they are this war has demonstrated, if you do not remember how craven and weak they showed themselves in the Sudan war. Rise then, in God’s name; do not throw away this glorious chance in dallying and hesitation. Take a lesson from your heroic brethren the Senussi warriors of Barca and Tripoli who hold death in contempt when fighting for their faith and fatherland, who dare to stand up as equals against a strong European power like Italy. Your own eyes have seen how God inscribed victory on the Muslim banners and aided with His holy spirit the champions of Kis pure religion, for “Often will a small band vanquish a host if it please God who is ever with them that persevere'. Brethren of Egypt, we who are your brothers in Islam cannot bear to drink our fill of the religious freedom and. t ^noiXUmlosne^ni r : ■ nittirep ani t&gt;ti«ets&lt; r i 5 ' ^ r 5 Cf a ^ &gt; • . rr , i ' i T ' •■ * ^13. and political Independence granted us by the Sultan’s decree and look on unmoved while the English break their oath with you and violate their plighted word; while they added to their dominions Egypt, the quiver of God upon earth, tne key to His holy places, and this after their repeated assurances that they did not covet your land and had no design to rob you of freedom and autonomy, ^re cannot bear that a power in Christendom and a foe to Islam should crush you in the gate of the sacred cities, in the path that leads to the Prophet of God. Therefore, putting our trust in the true King, we are resolved to succour you with our swords and our lives, with God’s help our arraiea shall enter your country and win through to your cities and villages. We have charged them not to mate war on brother Muslims, not to hold lawful spoil a man's rightful property or wife or family, to be just to the copts in Egypt as long as the copts fulfil their stated obligations to Islam and show no hostility, our armies wil l he .p you to recover those estates and townships which money lenders have stolen, till every one of you has his Plundered property and wealth restored. w e give order to our troops and their brother Muslims of Egypt who may join then to attack the subjects of those powers hostile to Islam and the Imperial caliphate, to seize all their money and goods and to hunt and slay them at sight. At the same time our soldiers and yours are bound to observe the laws of God and to do no violence to children, women, aged men or Monks. Do not shed the blood of any man who lays down his arms, nor injure him; but keep him prisoner till „he end o; the war. All the booty you take shall be divided14. divided and shared amongst you by officers in the higher commands of our army in accordance with the Muhammadan law observed by our honourable Prophet ln his cwpsigns. If any Muslim be discovered assisting the enemy against you or giving him secret information, he shell be punished as s spy and a traitor. Since w e are still in a state of war with Italy,no truce having beer declared and no terms of Peace established between us, and since she has made war treacherously against the Imperial Caliphate at the instigation of England, France and Russia, the lives and property of Italians in Egypt shall be lawful spoil to us and our Egyptian confederates, it is illegal for any of our men or their Egyptian comrades engaged in this holy wa - w violence to the property or household or life of others than those herein mentioned. God has spared the blood of covenanters and forbidden the Muslima to infringe tneir rights, and whosoever breaks this law ranks as an enemy.
