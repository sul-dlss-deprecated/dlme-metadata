The letter explains at length that the Resident has made it clear to the Arab chiefs that British intervention can only extend to preventing piracy, and maintaining general peace at sea.The letter further requests more clearly defined instructions for the Marine Department, as the Resident does not think that their current guidance covers the situations that are likely to be encountered.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000016#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
