Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.— 410 ARAB ALLIES OF THE TURKS. In the hope of compromising the Arab Movement and obtaining some assistance in their own winter operations, the Turks have been pressing their attentions on two Arab chiefs in particular, the Emir of Hail (Sand ibn Abdul Aziz er-Rashid) and Ajeimi Saadun of the Muntefiq. The stage now reached in the negotiations with these individuals offers several features of interest and significance. It may be premised that we have been in a favourable position to follow the negotiations to their present issue thanks to sure information received from time to time. The two Gf.O.C.’s, at Damascus and Medina, were trying all last spring to get the Emir of Hail to come westwards to their line of communications, and Fakhri Pasha even spread reports of Ibn Rashid’s compliance before at all assured of it. At last, on August 17, the Emir did appear at Medain Salih with about 1,000 followers including Rashid ibn Leilah and Abdul Hamid, delegate of the IVth Army. He was received by the Gr.O.C., 2 nd Composite Force, with all honours in spite of the unfortunate adventures of his advance party {see pp. 316, 321, 330) and his recent loss of Teima to the local Anazeh (pp. 330, 342). Whether the Turks knew also that he had been virtually turned out of Hail by his own people, is uncertain. During Ibn Rashid’s stay at Medain Salih his truculent and insubordinate following gave a good deal of trouble, and both the local G.O.C. and the Gf.O.C., H.E.F., quickly tired of their guest. After seeing the quality of his men, Fakhri seems to have abandoned all thought of committing the defence of Medina to him. A dispute soon arose over the lavish supplies which Damascus was sending down for the Emir. Seeing his own men going short, while Ibn Rashid was piling up far more than his followers required, and the latter were openly selling their surplus, the G.O.C., 1 st Composite Force, tried to withhold some of the consignments and get a committee of distribution appointed. The Emir, however, promptly complained to Damascus and the G.O.C. received an emphatic snub. Then a second difficulty cropped up through a demand of the Emir that bounties, over and above the 20,000 pounds Turkish which had been handed to himself, should be given to “ volunteers ” of his following. This time Damascus supported its Hejaz officers in their refusal, on the ground that it was for the Emir to pay his own men, and that, if they, the Turks, once began giving, they would never be able to stop, since whatever was given to Bedouins was always considered insufficient. Nor did Damascus care whether the “ volunteers ” dispersed or not ; and it told Abdul Hamid Bey so “ sans phrase.” So far from giving any help to his hosts, the Emir harped only on one theme, the duty of the TurksI — 411 — to recover Xeirn&lt; 3 . for liiui, his iiltiiniite object, &amp;S Ifftkliri Sfiw, being to get back to Hail with all the supplies lie could accumulate. Bein o ' in direct communication with the Chamber at Constantinople by means of telegrams, whose contents were unknown to f akhri, he made the latter’s position very uncomfortable. At last, on September 26, unable at Medain Salih to get any undertaking about Teima, the Emir left for Medina. Here he could and did bombard Fakhri in person. The only result, however, up to date has been to confirm the Pasha in his view that Ibn Rashid considers it more blessed to receive than to give, and that once the Teima road is opened, and the Emir has revictualled Hail, nothing whatever will be got out of him. Fakhri therefore has put up to Damascus the strongest objections against a Teima expedition on military grounds, the water en route being insufficient, the opposition to be expected being strong, and the present position on the rail way not permitting of the detachment of infantry for such a purpose. The only thing to do, he thinks, is to temporize by jnaking a show of preparation for such an expedition, professedly to take place at some unnamed date in the future. Jemal at Damascus, agrees with this policy, and hopes to keep the Emir quiet meanwhile at Medain Salih, to which point he has now returned or is about to return. There the matter stands. It is perfectly clear that no good is going to be got out of this “jungle youth ” of an Emir, and that Fakhri Pasha knows it better than anyone. So far from threatening any accession to the enemy strength in Hejaz, Ibn Rashid is a positive asset to King Husein’s cause. Long may he remain on Turkish hands ! His agent, Rashid Leilah, however, has been summoned to Constantinople and, if he obtains no satisfaction for his master there, relations may be expected to be strained to breaking point. Ajeimi Saadun is a different and more serious proposition. Since his striking letter to the Emir of Riyadh (see p. 119) last January, declaring his unalterable fidelity to the cause of the Caliph and the Turks, we have heard till lately little that is reliable about him. Some subsequent negotiations between him and Fahad ibn Hadhdhal (see p. 259) raised a hope that he might be beginning to relax his hostility to us ; but later we learned that he was making renewed offers of help to the Turks, it being reported that he undertook to raise 20,000 fighting men if properly paid, supplied and armed. The negotiations were making good progress before the recent disaster at Ramadi ; but this has caused a set-back and Ajeimi is now less willing, being affected by the consequent general depression which we hear, on the best authority, has pervaded the enemy’s Euphrates force. He has raised his terms, and if he ever promised 20,000 men, offers now to raise only 1,200 camel- riders, for whom he needs carbines and pay. The rates are to vary according to whether he has to provide their camels or not, but, in any case, they seem to be below the rates which ourExpeditionary Force pays to friendlies in the field. He stipulates further for a gift of light field guns and machine-guns and the co-operation' of a regiment of Turkish Camel Corps. His own contingent he hopes to raise from his Muntefiq and from Duleim and Anazeh tribesmen, but not from any Shammar elements (an indication that he is not well with Ibn Rashid at present) : and he promises to drive us off the Euphrates from the Shatt el-Arab to Nejef, and to seize the Basra-Nasriyah railway. As for cash he asks a good deal for himself, his brother Hamid, and his nephew, Yusuf, and also for his dme danmee, Mohammed el-Barak el-Aseimi, and the latter’s brother, Yusuf. This man, an old foe of Seyyid Talib at Basrah, was originally responsible for Ajeimi’s reconciliation with the Turks and adhesion to the C.U.P. The Germano-Turk command of the “ Yilderim ” Armies has accepted Ajeimi’s terms in principle, and is providing gold for the immediate use of the G.O.C., Euphrates Force. Hitherto Ajeimi’s co-operation has not proved much worth while, and his behaviour during the original Turkish attempt to retake Basrah and ever since does not argue that he is a persevering and energetic man of war. But the Yilderim command should know what it is about, and on our long Euphrates flank, a mobile desert force is undoubtedly to be feared. It should be added, however, that the Turks do not appear to rely implicitly on Ajeimiorto be prepared to fall in permanently with his demands. They hope to make use of him only at the first and to be able to dispense with him later. Meanwhile they are seeking to suborn other tribal elements as well, with a sum of money ear-marked expressly for the purpose. ARABIA. North-West. Raid near Bir esh-Shediyah. The following report, dated October 10 , has been received from Major Lawrence, C.B. :— “I left Akaba on September 27, to test an automatic mine on the Hejaz railway. In view of the possibility of wider operations in October, I took with me Lieutenant Pisani, of the French section at Akaba, and three educated Syrians (Faiz and Bedri el-Moayyad, and Lutfi el-Asali), in order to train them in anti-railway tactics. We marched to Rum on September 29, where we stopped three days. Lieut. Pisani had fever, and I spent the time in showing him and the others the preliminary work of mining and arranging with Sherif Hashim, a Shenabra, who is O.C., Rum, details of the Bedouin force required. Feisal’s orders to him41 o were to go where, when, and as I wanted. In an endeavour to get over the difficulties caused by Audah Abu Tayi’s pretensions, I appointed Sheikh Salem Alayan (Dumaniyah) to be O.C. Bedouins, and asked for only Dumaniyah and Darausha tribesmen, about forty in all. This number would have been enough to deal with a wrecked train, and easy to handle in the Fasoa district, (for which I was bound), where the wells are small. However the enormous haul of booty in the train blown up early in September near Mudowwarah had completely turned the heads of the Huweitat, and hundreds clamoured and insisted on taking part in my new expedition. We had a great deal of difficulty, and in the end 1 accepted nearly 100 Darausha, and fifty Dumaniyah, including every Sheikh in the two sub-tribes. All others were refused. A feature of the Huweitat is that every fourth or fifth man is a sheikh. In consequence the head sheikh has no authority whatever, and as in the previous raid, I had to be O.C. of the whole expedition. This is not a job which should be undertaken by foreigners, since we have not so intimate a knowledge of Arab families, as to be able to divide common plunder equitably. On this occasion, however, the Bedouins behaved exceedingly well, and everything was done exactly as I wished ; but during the six days’ trip 1 had to adjudicate in twelve cases of assault with weapons, four camel-thefts, one marriage-settlement, fourteen feuds, two evil eyes, and a bewitchment. These affairs take up all one’s spare time. We marched up Wadi Hafri (which drains into el-Gaa, N.E. of Rum, a central basin into which W. Hisma and W. Rabugh also pour) to its head near Batra, where w 7 e watered with some difficulty owing to scarcity of supply, and the numerous Arab families at the well. The area between Batra and the railway is % full of Arab tents. From Batra we marched on October 3 to near kilo. 475, where I meant to mine; but we found Turkish guard posts (of fifteen to twenty-five men) too close to the suitable spots. At nightfall, therefore, we went away to the south, till midnight, when we found a good place, and buried an automatic mine at kilo. 500'4. The nearest Turkish post was 2,500 m. away on the south. On the north there was no post for nearly 4,000 yards. The mine-laying took the five of us two hours, and then we retired 1,500 yards from the line and camped. On the 4th no train passed. On the 5th a water-train came down from Maan at 10 a.m., and went over the mine without firing it. I waited till mid-day and then, in two hours, laid an electric mine over theautomatic. The Turks patrolled the line twdce dail y, but one may- usually reckon on their all sleeping at noon. We then disposed the Arabs to attack the train when it should come and waited till the morning of October 6 for one to arrive. The line here crosses a valley on a bank twenty feet hhdi and 500 yards long. The bank is pierced by three small bridges’ at intervals of about 200 yards. We laid our mines overthesouthernmost of these, took the cables along the track to the midmost (the firing position), and put two Lewis guns in the northernmost, from which point they were in a position to rake the embankment. From this northern bridge ran up westward a two-foot deep torrent bed, spotted with broom bushes. In these the men and guns hid till wanted. On the 6 th a train (twelve wagons) came down from Maan at 8 a.m. It arrived only 200 yards in advance of the lurkish patrol (of nine men), but this gave us time to get into position. From the open bed of the valley in front of the line, where I was sitting to give the signal for firing, it was curious to see the train running along the top of the bank with the machine-gunners and exploders dancing war-dances beneath the bridges. I he Arabs behind me were beautifully hidden, and kept perfectly still. The explosion shattered the fire-box of the locomotive (No. 153, Hejaz), burst many of the tubes, threw the l.c. cylinder into the air, cleaned out the cab, warped the frame, bent the two near driving wheels and broke their axles. I consider it past repair. Its tender, and the front wagon were also destroyed, wfith one arch of the bridge. The couplings broke, and the last four wagons drifted backwards downhill out of fire. 1 was *too late to stop them with a stone. A Kaimmakam, General Staff, appeared at one window, and fired at us with a Mauser pistol, but a Bedouin blazed into him at twenty yards, and he fell back out of sight and I hope damaged. [We have heard since he got back safe to Maan: he was one, Nazmi Bey.] The eight remaining wagons were captured in six minutes. They contained about seventy tons of foodstuffs, “ urgently required at Medain Salih for Ibn Rashid,” according to way-bills captured with the lot. We carried off about a third of this, and destroyed another third or more. The Turkish killed amount to about fifteen (twenty ; see p. 415). Some civilians were released, and four officers taken prisoner. The plundering occupied all the energies of our Bedouins, and Turkish counter-attacks came up unopposed from N. and S. I rolled up the electric cables first of all, and as they are very heavy and I was single-handed, it took nearly three quarters of an hour to do this. Then two chiefs of the Darausha came to look for me. I went up to the top of the bank, hoping to fire the train, but found about forty Turks coming up fast and only 400 yards off. As the nearest Bedouins were 1,000 yards away and they were all on foot, driving their laden camels at top speed westward, I felt that it would be foolish to delay longer alone on the spot, and so rode off with the two Arabs who had come back for me. We all reached Rum safely on the 7 th, and Akaba on the 8 th, where I found telegrams asking me to go to Suez and on to G.H.Q., E.E.F. The raid was intended as an experiment only, and was most successful. The automatic mine failed, but I proved able toI — 415 — keep 150 Bedouins in a camp 1,500 yards from the line for three days without giving the Turks warning of our presence, m spite of the regular patrols passing up and down the line. Ihis means that the rank and file of the Arabs, as well as the sheikhs, did as I ordered. The complete destruction of a captured train, and annihilation of relief parties, will he easy, as soon as I have the Indian M.G. section to support me in the actual action. The Lewis gunners on this occasion were two ol my Arab servants, trained by me in one day at Rum. They killed twelve of the enemy’s casualties, but of course went off to get booty immediately afterwards. M. Pisani, Faiz el-Moayyad, and Lufti el-Asali, are now, 1 think, competent to lay mines by themselves. 1 was very well satisfied with all three of them.” Intelligence. Imperative orders were sent by King Husein to Zeid to move on (see p. 899). He announced, in reply, that he would leave Wadi Ais for Wejh about the 10 th, and on the 15th he actually arrived at the latter place with his personal following. When Ins army comes in, he asks that 1,000 men with 400- horses and forty camels, be shipped to Akaba, while the rest march by land. However, though Feisal still asks for Zeid and his force, it is questionable whether they will be of any use at Akaba, and it is not yet certain what will be done with them. The appear ance of cholera at Akaba (see below) futher complicates the matter. Xo solution of the financial question between the brothers has been arrived at yet, Feisal professing his inability to send Zeid the money to pay off his arrears. Zeid, however, has now reduced his claim from £30,000 to £ 10 , 000 . The King has promised £100,000 to Feisal whenever he shall definitely have broken the railway between Maan and Medina, and Feisal intends to make an effort very soon to earn this reward once for all. As for raids on the line, we print above (p. 412) Major Lawrence’s report on his success between Bir esh-Shediyah and Akabat el-Hejazia on October 6 . The enemy’s official return of killed in this affair is twenty. In the previous raid at Harret Ammar the Turks admit twenty-seven killed, forty-two wounded, and two engines destroyed. These two disasters have led to orders being issued by the G.O.C. Syria and Western Arabia (new title of Ahmed Jemal Pasha “ the Great,” who has now, it appears, returned to his post at Damascus) about extra guards and armament of trains. The Southern commands (H.E.F. and 2nd Composite Force), however, are not able to carry these into effect for lack of sufficient troops and machine-guns. Meanwhile the G.O.C., H.E.F., has been experimenting with land-mines to be placed in the passes (or rather to be announced as about to be placed there) to frighten Bedouins away from the southern— 416 section of the railway, and he believes a good effect has already been produced. There appears to have been a fatal accident during these mine-experiments at Medina. The Bir Nasif-Bowat raid, mentioned on p. 399, resulted in the destruction of 650 rails besides the four culverts. On October 7, a Turkish patrol, between Mali tab and el-Hadhm stations, lost nine prisoners and its commandant (wounded), before reinforcements could arrive. We have also received news of an earlier affray (some three weeks ago) near Wadi Ethil, in which the Circassian fedai Cavalry a turbulent regiment now under 300 strong, was engaged with a force under Mursuq et- Teheimi. The former lost a company commander, Mirza Bey, and seventeen, men, besides twenty-five horses. On the same night 500 rails were damaged between Wadi Ethil and Tebuk by a party which bivouacked on the line all night. Mursuq et- Teheimi is an ex-servant and secretary of Feisal, and reported a brave and energetic leader. He is followed by some elements of the Beni Atiyah, a tribe which Major Lawrence reports to be much more numerous than usually supposed. The Seil Matara-Zumurrud raid, also mentioned on p. 399 , resulted, we now hear, in the destruction of 230 rails, and two culverts, one with four arches and one with two : also of seven telegraph poles and three kilometres of wire. The damage was made good in about forty-eight hours. On the evening of October 14 an attack was made on a north-bound train between Bueir and Istabl Antar, and the telegraphic communication between these two stations was cut. The train was held up for some time, and apparently the engine ran short of fuel and water and had to go back to Bueir. We know no further details ; but, as the Arabs are in force near Istabl Antar and moving north, we shall probably soon hear news. Oil, butter, and meat were all unobtainable at Maan last week and the troops had to exist on cereals cooked with water only. Nor was there any money there (Damascus has again refused a request from the H.E.F. for coined money). Scurvy is making headway in the 2nd battalion, 162nd Regt. at Medain Salih, and the remedial measures taken have proved inadequate. On our own side cholera (not yet fully established to be Asiatic), as indicated above, has broken out at Akaba owing, it is thought, to some contamination from inland. Though only a few cases have occurred so far, the mortality has been disquieting. All possible measures are being taken by Cairo to combat the disease, and if possible, the beach wells will be closed, and purer inland water brought down to the camp. Now that Jemal “ the Great ” is back at Damascus, applications from the G.O.C.’s in the Hejaz are getting more sympathetic hearing, and it looks as if some reinforcements, to enable the Wadi Musa expedition to be carried out, will be sent down to Maan. Solicitude is also being shown for the condition of the. Hish forest wood-cutters, Circassian and Armenian, and/ inwr ip ! ? — 417 — money for the purchase of fuel and of wood for new buildings at Maan is being provided. The high percentage of desertions, not only from the Hejaz forces, but also all over the Asiatic theatre, is causing grave anxiety to the Turkish military authorities. In the Maan area our own planes have been keeping up the offensive since September 29, and a state of panic has been main tained at Maan station by Flight-Commander Stent’s visits. On one occasion he exploded a munition dump and on another narrowly missed the G.O.C. who had just finished his breakfast. The bomb went through his window and killed three servants, llusta, Fuweilah, and Delagha have been bombed also, the last, unfortunately, while occupied by a few friendlies. The Turkish planes at Maan are inactive, partly owing, it is reported, to “ rattening ” committed by the aviators themselves to escape the obligation to meet us in the air. The G.O.C. reports all the country around hostile and the Sherarat to have joined the “rebels.” The raid to Shobak, mentioned in our last issue (p. 400), seems to have been mismanaged, the objective having been needlessly evacuated after a few hours, to the damage of Feisal’s prestige. I he latter has called in the commander responsible and will destitute him. Meanwhile the supply of wood from the Hish forest causes undiminished anxiety to the Turkish military authorities. They have repaired the Hish-Aneiza light railway, which the Arabs were able only to tear up, not destroy; but supplies have been coming down very unsatisfactorily. The G.O.C., H.E.F., has been warned he can expect no fuel from this source, and must supply himself and the L. of C. up to Muadhdham by the demolition of all secular buildings in Medina city. Interrogation of five Egyptian soldiers recaptured during Major Lawrence’s recent raid on the railway did not reveal anything particularly new except some details about the supply of spare rails possessed by the Turks. It seems that a quantity of new rails is kept at all the stations along the line, the smaller stations averaging 200-250, and the larger ones about 400-500. All the broken rails are carefully collected and stored at different stations. One prisoner added that he saw engine shops at Medam Saleh. At the latter place a camp of Arabs was seen consisting of “ quite a lot ” of tents : these men were said to belong to Ibn Rashid and their attitude towards the prisoners was ot a most truculent sort. A statement, which reached Mecca recently, that Aawwaf Shaalan had come m to Abdullah’s camp, in Wadi Ais, is not true, Nawwaf being now m Jauf while Nuri remains at or near Ivat, since the recent narrow escape of father and son from Damascus But two of Nuri’s nephews are in Hejaz viz the AMS m ’ d Khali '’ th6 latte ‘ of h-, in fact visited— 418 — The Erair Mohammed es-Sand {see p. 401) had a very large following of armed Wahabis (said to have numbered 7,000 ? ) on his recent pilgrimage to Mecca. King Husein felt some apprehension and, therefore, had the reception camp pitched as far away as Ria es-Seil, seventy miles out of Mecca. But all passed off well. [ Late News .—Increased activity.

A telegram from Gallabat reports that an army, collected by the Negus Waldo Giorgis and led by four Dejazmaches, has defeated Dejaz Ababa of Simyen, whose force surrendered. though he himself escaped. This is perhaps the same person as Ganiazmach Ababi stated, evidently prematurely, on p. 221 as having surrendered to Waldo Giorgis some six months ago. Details of the defeat of Lij Yasu, reported in the last Bulletin, have now been received. It seems that, • having managed to collect a force considerably outnumbering that of the Shoans, Lij Yasu was able to surround the Government troops in Dessie and to frustrate several attempts on the part of the Fitaurari to cut his way out. Had Lij Yasu been content to invest the town, want of food would soon have obliged the Fitaurari to risk everything in an attempt to break through Lij Yasu’s lines, with the chances of success strongly against him. On Saturday August 26, the 7,000 men of Negus Waldo Giorgis, under Ras Iman, arrived from Yejju and attacked the rebel troops on the north side of Dessie but failed to break their line and were only saved from disaster by a sortie on the part of Ras Kassa ; Ras Iman was, however, killed in the fighting. This success probably emboldened Lij Yasu’s Chiefs to attack the Fitaurari himself on the following day. The latter had, however, strengthened his position by strong stone walls which broke the first attack and threw Lij Yasu’s army, which consisted largely of badly armed peasants, into such disorder that they were easily routed. The losses in the actual fighting were small, but the pursuit, which was carried on for eight days, resulted in the massacre of many thousands and from all accountsno M ' — 419 — mercy was shown to the population of Wollo who had been misguided enough to adhere to Lij Yasu’s cause. The fate of Lij Yasu himself, who had as usual remained well outside the danger zone, is still a matter of uncertainty, it being variously reported that he succeeded in escaping to the Danakil country, and that he was killed. Magdala and the other strong places of Wollo are said to be in the possession of the Government troops. This action may therefore be regarded as decisive so far as the Northern Provinces are concerned, for even if still alive, it is not likely that Lij Yasu will remain a source of danger to the Government, as there is small probability of his securing further support in Abyssinia proper, though he may yet give considerable trouble owing to his influence among the Moslem tribes. We arc informed that the Danakils and Somalis along the railway were prepared, on their own confession some days previous to the battle, to rise and cut the line the moment they received news of the expected victory of Lij Yasu and that Herr Von Syburg warned his adherents on August 26, the day before the fight took place, that important events would shortly happen and that they must be prepared for them, thus affording reason to believe that Lij Y r asu was, up to the last, in touch both with the Moslems and the German Legation. The belief that Lij Yasu is dead rests upon a report of a certain Fitaurari Mashasha to his chief, Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis, that he had himself killed him in the fighting round Dessie. Hapta Giorgis, however, decided to keep the report secret and every officer from his army returning to Adis Abeba was arrested and confined to his house. This was done in accordance with Ras Taffari’s wishes and it is possible that his intention was to make his enemies in Adis Abeba believe that the Fitaurari was still fully occupied in the north, he being in fact, at the time, at Worra Hailu, six days’ march from Adis Abeba. Ras Taffari was fully informed of the fact that a counter revolution had been planned for September 27, the first anniversary of the disposition of Lij Yasu, the object of which was to be his own arrest. The Empress is implicated in this but merely as the tool of Dejaz Igazu and his brother Naggadras Hasbi, who are supported by Ras Demisie, Dejaz Marid and a few other chiefs. The Mahal Safari, or body-guard of the late Emperor Menelik, form the nucleus of the force at the disposal of the conspirators.’ Ras laffari sent for 2,000 of his own Harrar troops, nominally to relieve his own special guard, and delayed sending the latter back to Harrar, thus retaining a force of 4~,000 men on whom he could rely. news extends, he was to give the Mahal Safari a province hi the Arussi with orders to march at once, and a few days earlier he ordered Ras Demissie to return to his own district. Demissie did leave Adis Abeba, but was still within a day’s march of the town on the date above mentioned. rRas Taffari appears to have taken all precautions possible and it will be interesting to learn the issue. This projected revolution has nothing to do with Lij Yasu’s schemes and neither the Moslems nor the Germans are concerned in it. Its effects should therefore be confined to Adis Abeba. If Ras Taffari wins through, he can then arrest Dejaz Igazu and all the members of the old Government ; if, however, he fails, we shall see a considerable amount of fighting, as it is unlikely that the Fitaurari and Ras Kassa would accept the new state of affairs. Ras Abata is reported dead, but even his own son has been kept in ignorance of his death which, with that of Lij Yasu, should the latter be confirmed, will not be announced until the crisis is over. NOTES. Population of Baghdad. In anticipation of racial claims which are sure to be made sooner or later for Baghdad and neighbourhood, it is of interest to transcribe from the latest Sal Narriah the following figures of population, communicated last July by Arab Bureau, Baghdad.

Kaf (pronounced Ljaf), at its head, is grouped popularly with Wishwasha, Nebkh, Ithra and Jerjer, as el-Geraia or Geraiat el-Milh, on the ground of common possession of vast saltworks which seem to have escaped mention by European travellers. Major Lawrence found the wadi alive with snakes, of which some half dozen varieties, ranging from nine to three feet in length, are poisonous. His party lost three men from snake-bites. It is particularly dangerous to water after dark, as the wells and pools are then full of snakes swimming about. In the daytime they are to be found in every bush. There and in the country to the south many ostriches were seen, but none was caught. Major Lawrence and three others breakfasted off one of their eggs, boiled over a fire of gelignite sticks ( !) : it was about a month old. They obtained a good deal of oryx meat and saw several of these heavy-headed antelopes, very suggestive of oxen. The Huweitat had a fine baby oryx in their tents. After the war it ought to be arranged that this interesting species be represented by live specimens in London. Another desideratum for the Zoo, by the way, is a maneless lion from the Karun or Euphrates. Maps of North- West Arabia. Major Lawrence, as a result of his journeys in north western Arabia, reports that all existing maps leave much to be desired. The Arab Bureau Maan sheet (1:500,000) he found to be not bad as a sketch of the general lie of the country ; but the railway, he feels sure, is shown too far to the East, a mistake which leads to the underestimating of all distances from it in an inland direction. The Royal Geographical Society’s 1 : 2 , 000,000 sheet he condemns for all the Wadi Sirhan and Jauf region, especially_ in its placing and spelling of localities. Miss Bell’s traverse from Kaf to Seba Byar, the most important of the A uld Ali watering places, he found to be good but too slight. Between Maan and Akaba he condemns all our maps, British, German and Turkish alike; e.g., an important watershed between the Hisma (he doubts the general application of this name to all the large plateau area usually so-called, and thinks it is to be used only of a single wadi) and Wadi Ithm, some eight miles south-west of Guweira, is nowhere properly marked. It is certainly very desirable to run a route-survey up Wadi t un, and to get the position of the railway fixed at several points between Maan and Medina. Major Lawrence’s own route- sketches are not yet to hand. Yemen Letters. Certain letters have come to hand from prominent persons m the Yemen, addressed to King Husein at Mecca, but they furnish little indication of any real partisan feeling in that area.They are chiefly of a non-committal nature, and display a conditional loyalty of a typically Arab description. For instance, Nasir Mabkhut el-Ahmar says that we “ are bound to obey him (the King) and execute his orders ” but stipulates that “assist ance must be forthcoming from a strong Power which should supply foodstuffs and ammunition.” Definite money payments are made a sine qua non both by certain notables of the Hashid and by Ali ibn Ihram : the former relate how they used to receive monthly salaries from the Turks, but are now “ willing to join the King providing they receive the same salaries,” while the latter states that both the tribes, Hashid and Bekil “ are anxious to serve the King, but in return he must fix salaries for them.” Throughout there is no positive statement about action taken or pledges given, and it seems from the letters as if it was unlikely that the writers and their following would initiate any military steps without financial and material encouragement. Aden News. A landing party from one of our warships was recently fired on by Arabs at Khor Omeira (about sixty-five m. W. of Aden), the result being two men wounded. This was an unexpected event, since that coast is usually friendly : it may have been due to the innate tendency of the Arab to let off his rifle on the slightest provocation (which, owing to an accident, there was in fact), or the men may have been a party of “ Milleh ” from Lahej. In any case the incident need not be looked upon as serious. In consequence of reports indicating the movement of enemy guns northwards, a reconnaissance in force was made from Aden towards Hatum, which was partially successful in forcing the Turks to reveal their gun-positions : they appeared to be occupying the same lines as before. Nothing heavier than a Mantelli gun was used against our troops. The Turks do not look like evacuating Lahej itself, anyhow for the present, though a withdrawal of some of their advanced posts seems not improbable in the near future owing to the steady pressure of our own forces. On the strength of reliable information that the enemy was sending, on October 9, a force of 300 Turks and 100 Somalis against Shuqra with the object of capturing Abd el-Qadir, a small party of infantry with some guns was despatched on a warship to Shuqra on the 12 th. No sign of the enemy was, however, found. (See p. 409 for a previous report.) Shahtur Traffic on the Euphrates. Supplementing the information given on p. 159 about shahtur traffic from Jerablus, the Mesopotamian E.F. Intelligence Summary of September 3 conveys the report of a man who floated down stream all the way to Ramadi last July in twenty days, his stages being Jerablus—Deir, seven days ; Deir—Anah, six days ; Anah—Hit, four days ; Hit—Ramadi, three days. His shahtur. winch had a crew of four and was coupled withanother, both carrying grain, travelled for ten hours per diem ; thus the whole voyage occupied 200 hours. This is the minimum time stated on p. 159 and faster than earlier experience would have pronounced possible, except on the spring flood. The Euphrates, however, is still running fairly full in July, and it appears that the waterway has been deepened and buoyed by German enterprise at some points, which used to cause delays, £.(/., in the Fatihat Khidhr Ilyas passage (see p. 159), near Haditheh island, the present wireless station of the enemy, and for some forty miles above it. The informant said, that he found from three to four feet of water all the way, and that launches could pass everywhere. He saw some seventy shahturs under construction, supervised by Germans, in the boat-yard at Jerablus, and stated that six men now build a pair of these craft in ten days. This rate must, however, vary with the size required ; for all shahturs are not of equal dimensions. Emil Kir sch. The following interesting account of the adventures and end of the Mullah’s German (Jew ?) armourer (see p. 594), who had formerly been in the Abyssinian service, is extracted from H.M. Commissioner’s Somaliland Report for August:— “ Emil Kirsch is dead. Accompanied by his servant, he escaped from Tale about the middle of June, and marching by compass, headed for the northern coast with the intention of surrendering at the Italian port of Alula. After many days’ wandering without food or water, his strength gave out, and he ordered his servant to leave him and go on. The servant staggered on until picked up by some friendly tribesmen quite close to Leskhorad. A Warsangeli party was despatched immediately to search for Kirsch. They found his remains and brought in some of his effects. The servant, one Ali Ahmed, a native of Nyassaland, is intelligent and well-travelled, and the following precis of his information with regard to Kirsch, whom he served for four-and-a-half years, may be accepted as reliable. ^ Kirsch was a mechanic who had travelled extensively in East and South Africa mending typewriters and other machines. The outbreak of the Great War found him on board ship en route for Jibuti. Disembarking at that port, he hastily made his way to Abyssinia, where he remained till August, 1916. In that month three-cornered negotiations took place between the German Consul, Lij Yasu and the Mullah’s envoy, as a result of which Kirsch wa S&lt; sent to Tale to repair the Mullah’s machine gins, rifles and (imaginary) artillery, and to make ammunition, tie was given to understand that he was going on a five months’ contract inclusive of journeys, and Lij Yasu gave personal security for Ins safe return. He appears to have had little idea ol the hazardous nature of Ins enterprise, but he was soon to be disillusioned On arrival at Tale, he was allotted quarters in the mam defensible work, and in these quarters he was virtually a— 424 prisoner. However, he set to work mending rifles and manufacturing ammunition, and he received no actual illtreat- ment until he failed to carry out some of the impossibilities demanded of him. For example, his protests, that he could neither manufacture guns without material and plant, nor mend maxim-guns without component parts, were met with buffeting and abuse, while his request to be allowed to return to Abyssinia on the conclusion of his contract was received not only with threats, but with actual manifestations of the most revolting- atrocities. His last months at Tale were well nigh intolerable, and he frequently contemplated suicide. Finally, he escaped, by letting himself down the wall with a long rope and a grappling- iron, only to perish on the road. Eight Bagheri who had formed the guard oyer his quarters were executed forthwith. It is significant of the Mullah’s distrust, that .never once did he admit Kirsch to audience during his stay at Tale.” The House of Sheibi (Beni Shaybali). The Kiblah (No. 116) announces the death of the aged Sheikh Mohammed Salih, head of the Sheibi Shaybah family, and hereditary Keeper of the Key (or, rather, the gilt padlock) of the Kaabah. A year ago he was appointed first Vice-President of the King's Legislative Council, though not credited with enthusiastic loyalty to the regime. The Keepership of the Key now passes, by King Husein’s order, to the next brother, Abd el- Qadir, also a member of the Legislative Council. This family— tiie sangre azul of Mecca, as Burton called it—is of so ancient and authentic a nobility that it puts “ Bourbon and Nassau ” into the shade. If we smile at the popular legend which traces the family and its privilege to an old woman (Shaybah), whom Abraham and Isaac found in possession of the site of the new Kaabah they had been commanded to build, and bought out with a promise of the key to herself and her sons for ever—at the same time we know that the Sheibi have enjoyed their privilege since Moawiya’s day, if not the Prophet’s—generation after generation for at least 1,200 years. Perhaps, indeed, much more, for the Kaabah is pre-Islamic, and it was the long established Meccan aristocracy (e.g. the Umayyads) that the Prophet compromised in the matter of the local sanctuaries. History relates that, during the anarchy of the eleventh century, when Abbasid prestige was dying and the Alids had not yet rivetted their grip on Mecca, the Sheibis enriched themselves, like any Barons of mediaeval Europe, by transferring all the gold and silver gifts from the Beit Allah to their own private possession.ARAB BULLETIN.

P-1 “ h ma I v Said ’ 1 think ’ tliat 5 £OTa war time ilgrimage, that of 191^ has been a great success from every point of view The number of sea-borne Pilgrims was con- siderably less than last year, but those from various parts of Arabia were nearly twice as many. The multitude which assembled at Arafat is estimated at 58,000, of which the principal parties from outside the Hejaz were P Apart from public security and health, which will be touched on later, the most outstanding feature of this year’s i gi image was, perhaps, the presence of the Emir Mohammed ibn Abd er-Kahman es-Saud (brother of the Emir of Neid) who came attended by 7,000 armed Arabs. His father, the imam, started for Mecca, but got a touch of sun four yTY 8 out on the road and had to return. The Emir Mohammed was well and hospitably received by Kino- Husein and he and his people were very well pleased with the manner in which they were treated. It says, I think, a great deal for King Husein that no unpleasant incident is reported, when it is lemembered that Wahabites are regarded to a very great extent as heretics by the orthodox Moslems, and particularly by Meccans and Hejazi Arabs. A curious side light is thrown on the attitude of Ibn baud s family towards King Husein by the following : Emir Mohammed wrote when at Mecca asking the King to lend him £ 2,000 and to give him seven male and eight or nine female slaves^ The mother of the Imam Abd er-Rahman and one of the wives of Ibn Saud also wrote to the King asking him for a present of clothes, etc., for themselves. All the presents were given. Public Security. No leport of any untoward incident has been received. Information from many sources all proves that the road to Mecca and on to Arafat was perfectly safe, and King Husein appears to have done everything possible to make the journey of the Pilgrims as comfortable and easy as possible. At the time of writing (October 11 ) no complaint of any sort has been received from the Pilgrims. Public Health. I his was very good ; there was no case of plague or cholera, and I understand that the causes of the few deaths which occurred From Nejd „ Yemen ,, Sudan (Takruris) „ various eastern tribes . about 12,500 . about 6,000■feast. r . — 426 — were practically all either old age or a type of diarrhoea. I think there is little doubt that this clean bill of health was hugely due to the improved quarantine arrangements at Jeddah and the greatly improved medical arrangements made at Mecca and Muna. General. The number of pilgrims arriving by sea at Jeddah was small (some 2,030, excluding Takruris from the Sudan) ; but the arrangements for quarantine, landing, housing, etc. worked smoothly and the charges made were—as far as has been ascertained—in accordance with the liing s schedule of fees. Names of various important chiefs who attended the Pilgrimage w ill be given in a full report to be forwarded later. It is satisfactory to know from Husein Puhi that, on practically every occasion on which King Husein addressed assemblies of Chiefs and Arabs during the Pilgrimage, he emphasized the fact that Great Britain was the firm and true friend of the Arabs and that without her assistance the Revolt would have been impossible.” ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Raids on the Railway. (a) Northern Section .— The most important operation during the past week has been the siege on October 18-19, capture on the 20 th, and retention till the 21 st, of “ Hill Post 4,” about half-way between Dhat el-Haj and Bir Hurmas stations, by an Arab force, drawn from Beni Atiyah, Huweitat, Rowalla, and Sherarat tribesmen. This is one of the intermediate posts lately established, where stations are twenty kils. apart or more. With what strength it was held we do not know. The only in dication is that its garrison, together with the first force sent to its relief, totalled 180 men, of whom 103 were killed or captured. The Arabs seized the post, together with a detach ment sent at midnight from Bir Hurmas, in a relief train, which they derailed. They held on firmly to the Post, but beyond destroying a few rails in three different places and about a kilometre of telegraph wire, did no demolition, probably for lack of explosives. It does not appear that they had any European officer with them, and their commander was probably Mursuq et-Teheimi. To have paralysed the Hejaz railway for three days is very much to his credit. The Turks did not report “ All clear” till late on the 22nd. The enemy had shown great concern about the affair and, after the G.O.C. Maan had declared himself unable to help owing to his Wadi Musa expedition {see below), Ahmed Jemal Pasha, though no longer at— 427 — * is H. 2 -in Damascus, sent imperative orders that the best battalion ot a weak reoiment ot the 48th Di vision, then on its way to Kerak should be detached, and that transport for it and other reinforcements should take precedence of all other demands of both the Syrian and Yildernn commands. Eventually the first battalion of the 152nd Regt. was sent down fronf Amman station, and having effected its object, is to remain with the 2 nd Composite korce. In clearing the line it co-operated with a force sent up from the South. There have been indecisive skirmishes at other points—near Bir esh-Shediyah, on the 17th, where about 100 Arabs were dispersed by an armed train assisted by one of the Mean planes f near Harret Ammar (or el-Amara) on the 19th, where the Arabs lost a man and some gun and other ammunition and had some wounded ; and near (xhadir-el-Haj, where a considerable body of Arabs was prowling on the 20 th. (5) Southern Section. —W e have heard of a raid effected on the night of the 17th between Abu Naam and Stabl Antar, in which ooO rails were destroyed : and of a smaller affair near Bowat, which resulted in thirty-eight rails having to be replaced. The first of these raids may be the same, or part of the same, operation, which has been reported to us from Wejh as having destroyed 800 rails ; but the date given for this destruction was October Jl. That total of rails is, no doubt, far above the tiuth ; but there is no good reason to reject the further inform ation that the lurks lost fourteen killed and twelve prisoners, besides material. A German, whose name is given as “ Miral Kohnen ( = Miralai Kohn ?), is said to have been among the killed. Other Wejh reports of breaks near Toweira and Abu laqa, each resulting in preposterous totals of rails destroyed seem to be belated echoes of affairs already reported. Wadi Musa Operations. Following urgent recommendations from Damascus, and in the belief that Feisal’s main attack would be directed towards TVadi Musa, the G.O.C. 1 st Composite Force moved out all the troops he could spare on the 20th towards Fiji and had, on the 21st, a seven hours fight there with an entrenched Arab force. The result, according to enemy report, was the destruction of the fortifications and the repulse of the Arabs. But it does not appear that the latter dispersed. Indeed an Arab report states that the} counter-attacked and took prisoners and animals. This is probably the Arab version of what the enemy represents as a voluntary retirement, after the battle was over, to Ain Busta, owing to a call from Maan for troops for Dhat el-Haj. The enemy report gives fantastic figures of Arab casualties (including British officers !), following an inflated estimate of their total forces. The Turk’s own casualties are stated as twelve killed and ninety-four wounded.■Bfesask. ,4k — 428 — General. The intentions of Nuri Shaalan continue to disquiet the Turks, who evidently have no doubt that he means business on the side of the Revolt. He has sent letters to Sherif Abdullah, who is sending 1 him same arms in return. Abdullah has reported the adhesion of the sheikhs of “ Hait and Haweet” (so the names reached us), whose villages are situated he says “ three nights from Hail between el-Hutaimieh and Aneizah ” and “would form a base for an attack on Hail.” He means undoubtedly the old “ free ” villages, Hayat and Huweyyat, in the Harrat Kheibar, which are inhabited mainly by negroes (these withstand the local malaria better than anyone else) with a mixture of half-caste and settled Huteim, but are owned by absentee Wuld Suleiman Sheikhs. Their adhesion is, doubtless, a consequence of the recent capture of Teima by the Anazeh : for, like that place, these eastern Kheibar villages used to own allegiance to Ibn Rashid though never to the Turks. Abdullah wrote to his father, that these were “ the only villages with palms left to Ibn Rashid after losing Qasim—Their people are rich, numerous, well-mannered, accomplished and intelligent.” Abdullah proposes to send them 1,000 rifles and to appoint a Judge in el-Hayat. The Austrian instructors at Maan are having a hard time for lack of decent food and money, the value of Turkish paper having depreciated over eighty per cent in the locality. Cholera at Akaba. Up to the latest advices it has not been possible to make a bacteriological determination, but the responsible medical officer does not doubt that it is true cholera. Between the 14th and 24th there were twenty-five cases and twenty deaths, all among Bedouins and Sherifan soldiers, except one Egyptian, a telephone operator, who died. On the 24th there was no fresh case. The infection was carried, it seems, by Arabs who had come from Tebuk ; but we have no independent evidence of cholera there. The Turks, on the other hand, know of the Akaba cholera. The medical authorities are finding preventive measures difficult, owing to the dirt and indiscipline of the Arabs, and the number of open wells. Disaffection among the Harb. It has been expected that tribes of central and southern Hejaz would soon give trouble on realising that the King’s policy is to ignore their claims for subsidy since military operations ceased in their area. Disaffection has come to a head first among the Hawazim Harb. It is reported that a French Moslem officer and five Algerians, accompanied by two Sherifs, have been held U P ^y a force of 200 men three days out from Yambo on their way to Sherif All’s camp, and robbed of everything except sufficient food to take them back to Yambo. The tribesmen concerned declared their intention of doing likewise to all and— 429 — sundry till their claims shall be satisfied by the King, to whom meanwhile they renounce allegiance. They have also held up a supplies caravan on its way to All. The latter, however, has received his October allowance of money all right. Later inform ation sa^ that the Masruh Harb are also disaffected, and th”t supplied^by^he Turks!'' bril ™ g them witl * nn further fresh cases of cholera at Akaba up to October 2 /. We know tliat the food problem at Medina has readied a crisis, the bread reserve having been exhausted on October -O, and the local date crop having failed owing to hot winds. Orders about supplies to Hejaz, issued some time ago n Damascus, have not been carried out, and fresh orders, issued last week, are not likely to be more effective.] The Wadi Musa Area. ± L^ut.-Col. P.C. Joyce sends the following, under date October 12 :— (a) Raid on Shobak. oaa . was undertaken by Sherif Abd el-Mu’in with some wOO Bedouins. Malud Effendi and some thirty men of the regular Arab ^Corps with two machine guns also took part at Abd el-Mu m s special request, although it was against Malud’s judgment to proceed with such a very small force. Shobak was occupied without any resistance. About 120 Arab inhabitants on loot and about twenty horsemen came out and welcomed the lent, and the remainder of: the population took no part against him ; but neither did they offer any active assistance. The thirteen gendarmes, who composed the garrison, immediately came over to Malud and were sworn in to the Sherif s service Abd el-Mu in then proceeded to the railway line between lias el-xiadid and Aneiza and tore up about 300 rails. He was assisted by the local Arabs and there was no opposition. He then went to Hish, about four miles south-east of Shobak which was guarded by only one company of Turks. The Arabs had ?AA V l° U o 1 A y A r f ei 1 Ved ne 4 WS that the whole of the woodcutters, some /00 to 800 Arabs and Armenians, were ready to join them on arrival. This venture however did not succeed ; the Arabs were unable to deal effectively with the company guarding the forest and the woodcutters all collected together in the middle of the forest to await events. Eventually Abd el-Mu’in and the Arabs drew off having captured some twenty prisoners and deserters.— 430 The effect of this withdrawal was bad, and many of the Arabs who came to join Abd el-Mu’in returned to Shobak. The Turks were reinforced from Ras el-Hadid by a company of infantry with two mountain guns, and eventually Abd el-Mu’in had to retire south. Malud Effendi extricated his people from Shobak with some difficulty and had a few wounded by shrapnel. The thirteen gendarmes, whom he had previously captured and sworn in, seeing how matters were going, again changed their politics and returned to the Turks. The whole raiding party sub sequently returned to W adi Musa. The raid, though in some respects regrettable, may have a good effect. It has demonstrated to the Sherifs that the ‘ tip and run ’ operations, to which they had been accustomed in the Hejaz, will not suffice in Syria. The people of Shobak, I firmly believe, are entirely with the Sherif, but they have had sad experience of the heavy hand of the Turk, and until they see a reasonable chance of protection for their own people, can scarcely be blamed for being somewhat cautious about arousing the anger of their oppressors. The raid also demonstrated more than ever the necessity of a trained Arab Legion to occupy and defend points captured by the Bedouins. The Arabs in Syria are used to regular troops, and Bedouin allies alone are not sufficient to overcome the fear of Turkish reprisals. I saw a good many of the Wadi Musa Sheikhs in company with Jaafar Pasha. Khalil el-Halili appears to be the most influential and has done much to help Malud Effendi. They appear to be thoroughly in sympathy with the Arab Movement, were free in giving information and expressed themselves in perfect readiness to accompany and take part in any raiding or demolition parties in the district. Their greed for money and food equals in every respect that of the Hejaz Arabs, but I consider a great deal more work can be got out of them. They regularly picket the hills round Wadi Musa and without their assistance Malud Effendi’s position would be a difficult one. The visit of Jaafar Pasha did an enormous amount of good, and by freely expressing himself merely the servant of Sherif Feisal, he did much to make the local population realise that the regular troops were part of the Arab movement and directly under Sherif Feisal’s orders. The climatic conditions of Wadi Musa and Delagha are probably not quite realised. The cold is intense (October 1 to 7 ) both in the wadis and on the hills. Sheikh Khalil el-Halili informs me that by the middle of November not a Bedouin remains in the district (except those living in a few houses) : they all proceed east with their flocks and camels to a warmer climate. This is a somewhat serious outlook and means that, by the end of November, the whole protection of Wadi Musa will devolve on the Arab Legion. o— 431 The Meccan troops I saw were already looking miserable enough. They will not withstand the winter unless well supplied with warm clothing and good food. This point must be thoroughly realized about Meccan troops probably not being able to stand the winter season in the mountains. There is a probability they may have to be withdrawn south.” Jaafar Pasha s Reconnaissance. “ This was accompanied by myself, Sherif All ibn Husein,- and a mixed escort of some forty, Syrian and Bedouin soldiers. The route was Akaba—Grueira—Delagha—Wadi Musa—Delagha —Grarandil—Wadi Arabah—Akaba. We found the road (thirty miles) up Wadi Ithm rough and stony till after Wadi Bateiha was passed ; but a working party of about twenty-five Egyptians is improving it, and it should be fit for cars by about October 20. At Gueira the old Turkish telegraph office is the only standing building. Water has to be carried about one and a half miles, and this is sufficient for only about 500 men. Animals have to go five miles for a limited supply. Rashid Effendi commands about 400 infantry, and eighty mounted troops with one 15-pr. field gun, one mountain gun and two machine guns. Drill and discipline showed improve ment, some of the hT.C.O.’s having evidently had German instruction. The Arab officers seemed keen. Onward to Delagha is about twenty-five miles due north by a road lying west of the main road to Fuweilah. Water at Helwa el-Beida, about eleven miles north in a deep wadi a mile west of the road. The descent is precipitous and much time is wasted by watering here, as animals are unable to ascend with a full load ; water appears plentiful and good. Up to this point the road is fairly good and I consider motor cars could be got along it. After leaving Helwa el-Beida the track becomes very difficult; animals can only go in single file and it is quite impossible for wheeled traffic. About four miles south of Delagha the track leads into the Delagfia-Garandil road. This is a chaussee, and although much out of repair, is comparatively easy going, and the whole distance between Hel wa el-Beida and Delagha is within easy striking distance of enemy mounted troops stationed at Abu Lisal. It is surprising that hitherto they have not made any attempts to raid our convoys for Delagha and Wadi Musa. These proceed without escort or protection of any kind beyond the Bedouin pickets on the hill-tops, who would undoubtedly give warning of any enemy movement, though probably do but little to check it. Delagha lies at the head of the Wadi Delagha, a wide depression overlooked by very high hills. There is a lot of cultivation in the vicinity but it is not yet sown, and plentyof raiming water ; but no trees or buildings. The Arab garrison consists of some 450 men with two mountain guns and two machine guns; the troops are mostly Meccans and looked to me of very poor quality, of bad physique and badly clothed ; but the officers appear confident of their fighting qualities. The Bedouins here have offered great assistance in picketing the hills, but mostly appear to take orders from the Syrian officers and pay but little attention to the local sherif. Jaafar Pasha and myself rode out to Gebel Um Semouga, about three miles south-west of Delagha, and from this point the Turkish positions of Abu Lisal and Um Rega were plainly visible at a distance of about four miles. The strength of the force at Abu Lisal is estimated at a tabur (about 700 to 800 men) and a company (about 200) mounted troops. Their actual strength in mountain guns is not known, but there are certainly two of these, which constantly open fire on the Bedouins at extreme range. The garrison of Um Rega is estimated at a company of infantry and some mounted troops. It is situated about five miles north of Abu Lisal and on the main Gueira-Busta road. From Delagha to Wadi Musa, via Tieyieba, the distance is about twenty miles, the road for the first two miles following the main Maan-Garandil road ; then it branches north and follows the slopes of a high mountainous range overlooking the Wadi Thabra and the M r adi Tieyieba. The whole of the Wadi Arabah and the country west of it are plainly visible, and the scenery is magnificent. The track is impossible for anything except pack- animals and even for these progress is slow. It could never be made fit for motor-cars or wheeled traffic. There is much culti vation on the slopes of the hills and a considerable number of stunted cedar trees grow on the western slopes. There is a plentiful supply of water along the road at Um Rajif, where there are ruins of an old Roman village and a large cistern, about seven miles noith ot Delagha. There is also plenty of water at Fieyieba and in Ain Ainub. All through these mountains there are numerous springs, known only to the Bedouins. Tieyieba con sists of about twenty-five to thirty mud houses. Jaafar Pasha was greeted enthusiastically by the‘inhabitants who all expressed their loyalty to the Arab cause. The inhabitants live in desperate fear of the Turks and with some reason, since they have no pro tection except their own pickets on the hill tops, and the Turkish position of Ain Bust a lies only six miles to the east. From Tieyieba to Wadi Musa is about seven miles The w a '!- i V! e 7 dH ® c , ult; aiKl llhlst be at least 4,000 feet above the \\adi l habra. I here is a spring at Ain Ainub four miles north O-f iieyieba, where are also ruins of an old village. From this point the road begins to descend into the Wadi Musa. Wadi ilusa, or Fiji, lies on the wadi bed which is about a mile wide at this point. It is surrounded on all sides by high mountains and all approaches are easy for defence. At the same time thedefensive line is so extended that it would require a comparatively large force to ensure the safety of the position. The present Arab force consists of about 300 mounted men, two mountain guns, and four machine guns. It is composed of Meccan troops and Syrian and Baghdad Arabs and looks of poor quality ; but the C.O., Malud Effendi, is one of the best officers in the Arab army, and can be relied on to put up a stout defence. The highest hills dominating the position are held by regular troops ; more distant hills are picketed by the Bedouins. Jaafar Pasha and myself inspected the whole position and made some altera tions in the dispositions ; and as much as is possible has been done with such a small force available. The troops are suffering much from cold which is intense on the hill tops, and there are a few cases of dysentery. All the available blankets have been sent from Akaba, but still there are not sufficient. The natives in these parts wear sheepskin-lined abbas and soldiers, there fore, with one blanket only are suffering much from cold. Jaafar Pasha and myself made from here a reconnaissance of the Turkish position of Ain Busta about four miles south-east of Wadi Musa. Not much could be observed beyond fortifications on the top of the hills, and about 200 horses and mules saddled up in the wadi below. There are estimated to be a tabur of infantry, and about 500 mounted troops at Ain Busta, but up to date no demonstrations have been made against Wadi Musa. From Wadi Musa to Delagha the road traversed was the same as we arrived by. Me reached Delagha a few hours after the place had been bombed by one of our own aeroplanes. There was a considerable amount of indignation among the Arabs, but on the whole they took it very well, and understood the great difficulties pilots have in recognising the various places. From Delagha to Gfarandil the distance is about twenty-two miles. With the exception of about five miles, which lies in the bed of the Wadi Garandil, the whole of this is a made road cut out of the sides of the hills. The road is much out of repair, and in its present state impassable for cars: fifty men working- seven or eight days could repair it, and it would then be worth a reconnaissance, with a view to getting cars all the way from Akaba to Delagha via the Wadi Arabah. There is no water on the road, but water is obtainable at Bir Earned about two miles north of the road, and about seven miles from Delagha. Garandil is situated at the mouth of the Wadi Arabah, and was evidently the site of a large Turkish camp. Concrete water- troughs had been erected, and there are the remains of a large bakery. The present garrison consists of 150 Arabs (non-regu lars) under a sherif, and the place should be easily defended from an attack either east or west. From Garandil to Akaba, the distance is about forty miles. The road runs down the bed of the Wadi Arabah and there is a good deal of heavy sand ; but I think a track for motor-cars— 434 — might be found, and a reconnaissance be worth undertaking. There is good water at Ghadian and bad water at Ain Diffiya, which appears fit for animals only. Along the whole route travelled there was no grazing of any kind for animals, and it was necessary to carry forage for the whole way.” (c) Deserter s Information. “Mulazim Subhi, of the M.G. Corps at Hish, who, after writing to Sherif Feisal, deserted to Akaba on October 19, has stated the Turkish strength at Ras el-Hadid (rail-head) and in the Forest, at the date of his departure, to be two taburs of 146th Regiment and one tabur of 161st Regiment, with two mountain guns and four machine guns (two of these under orders for Maan). Xo cavalry except the handful of gendarmes at Shobak. The infantry taburs were much under strength, and all three together totalled under 800 men (e.g. one company^ nominally 200 strong, was in reality under fifty). Sami Bey is O.C. The force is picketted about on high points overlooking the Forest, and the soldiers have to help the woodcutters in order to keep up the supply. There is no reserve of cut wood. Sami Bey had refused to undertake an attack on Wadi Musa unless heavily reinforced, pleading that, if he moved troops from Hish, the supply of wood could not be maintained and the Arabs would rush his posts. Jemal Pasha came to Hish about October 10 , but no fresh troops followed his visit. No reprisals were taken against the Shobak Arabs after Abd el-Muin’s raid {see p. 429), the order to the troops oeing to abstain from interference with the local popula tion, whatever its known disloyalty. Subhi says that the first British air-raid on Maan killed thirty-five and wounded fifty, and each subsequent raid has added to the casualties. All loco motives are run into sheds as soon as planes are sighted. (This statement was to be tested on October 21 by one of our planes.)” NOTES. Abyssinia. Further official news from Abyssinia brings our knowledge of events there down to September 28, that is, one day beyond the date of the expected revolution. So far nothing had happened though plots and intrigues of all kinds were in progress It appears more probable than before, that Lij Yasu is really dead • k« news from the north was still being kepi secret, all messengers arriving thence being confined to their houses and allowed to communicate with no one. There is a further rumour that I &lt; ? 10 r S 1S las c ’ le&lt;) £rom illness, colour to which is Ult &gt;y the fact that thirty men, coining from Has Kabada, who it the rumour proved true, would take over the command were43.5 I made to take an oath of silence and were then shut up. The death of theFitaurari would be about the worst thing that could happen to_ the country. Has Taffari would be forced to call in as Minister of War either some adventurer like Igazu, or else Dejaz Balcha, the only strong man left in Abyssinia. This might result in the country remaining quiet ; but the policy would become anti-European. Shukra and the AM Fad/. u The prime factor dominating the Fadli imbroglio is the age of Sultan Husein ibn Ahmed, and his fear of a Turkish invasion on the lines of the inroad into our Protectorate and the capture of Lahej. Lhe old Sultan defected to the Turks through fear. He also hates the House of Abdali, and was not averse from accepting certain Lahej lands belonging to the present Sultan of Lahej, now a refugee in Aden. There is constant chaos in Fadli tribes. Another element leading to discord was the bad blood existing between the Aid Fadl and the Lower Yafa. It is an old story and relates to their respective claims to a° water-channel. The Lower Yafa Sultan (lately deceased) received a fancied affront in Aden some years ago and refused acceptance of his stipend. Friendly relations between him and the Aden Residency were stopped. The new Sultan is an unknown quantity. Ali Said Pasha, at Lahej, has tried to reconcile these discordant factors and thus to effect what the Aden Residency, owing to Yafai contumacy, has not been able to achieve. This the Pasha tried to do in order to enhance his political prestige as a Moslem general working for the unification of Moslem rulers. Some few Lower Yafa people have gone to Lahej. Several Fadlis followed their Sultan there, if, in the first instance, we had given Sultan Husein of Shukra the arms he asked for, and if we had consented to his proposal to send H.M.S. “Jupiter” to that port and disembark the 600 bluejackets, I believe the present contretemps would never have arisen. It was, however, thought politic to force the Sultan to show his hand, and chastise his unruly subjects—the Haidara am Mansur. This he did not do, and these miscreants appealed to Ali Said who sent reinforcements to their H.Q. at Dirjaj. Sultan Husein prefers our benefits to those of the Turks, whom he at heart detests. He merely succumbed to ‘ force majeure,’ as did the Haushabi Sultan when the Turks marched down through A 1 Museimir to Lahej. Sultan Abd el-Kadir, the chief’s grandson, has remained pro- British. He is a smart youth and expects the throne at the chief’s demise, which cannot be long delayed. Abd el-Kadir has often asked for armed assistance. He controls a portion of the chief fighting clan, the Marakisha, and also the Nakhai tribesmen. We have all along demurred to any very visible demonstration on his behalf, because we did not want to offend the old Sultan who, at heart, is pro-British. On the death of Sultan Husein the throne will pass to Abd el-Kadir, though Ali Said Pasha hasintimated that he will himself nominate a successor ; he has, furthermore, drafted and circulated new treaties which, before the conclusion of peace, all our proteges will be required to sign, and which will place all the Hinterland of Aden under Turkish control. Before I left Aden, in April last, the grandson was sent forty rifles and ammunition and he was given special facilities to get supplies by his own dhows from Aden. If we advance ourselves from Aden, the future of the Fadli country is assured to us and to our influence. The Arabs require an example and will then flock to our standards.” H.F.J. Makalla Politics. “ I he Sultan, SirGhalib, and his minister, Seyyid Husein ibn Hamid, are pressing for assistance in money, arms and ammunition to resist internal intrigue. This intrigue has gone on for many years, and the chief actors are the Kathiri Sultans, who lack a seaport. Their merchants carry on lucrative businesses in Java and Singapore. They are full of enterprise, while the Sultan is fond of ease and quiet and of keeping things in his own hands, lor years the people—backed by the Seyyids—have intrigued against the Sultan’s rule, and before the war they were in communication with the Imam of Sana. Now that the Turks are within our Protectorate, these, too, have incited the Kathiris, and the famous Seyyid Abdul Rahman Ubeidillah, to rebel against Sir Ghalib. Ghalib’s minister is the real ruler of his master s domains and he wields considerable influence. So long as he is on tour he can control the situation. His weapon is to present liberal doles and stipends to the Kathiri rulers for distri bution to the swarming masses of Seyyids who really control Kathiri politics. When, however, the minister returns to Makalla, intrigue breaks out afresh. I do not think the Makalla Sultan is in danger of invasion, i- alwa y s asserted that he has complete domination over c f. intei ; land - this is not the case. Witness the ‘ Temple Syndicate for exploiting minerals, coal, etc. This concession had to _ be abandoned^ because of the stolid opposition of the people inland, and this opposition was more than Sir Ghalib con d overcome. Makalla is loyal to the core, and the moral ettect of our monetary support is incontrovertible. He asks for guns and would have his gunners trained in Aden. I think the moral effect of this assistance will be far reaching The machinations of the society called the ‘ Jamaiyat al-Hakk ’ were anti-dynastic. Funds were to come to Hadramaut from Java Singapore and, I believe, from India. Ghalib pooh-poohed the power of this society, which was republican in form, Ld of late rfmmerhd mX, 1 I T'd '™ 8 ° f ft Societ &gt;'’ which 1 fancy is simmering. Makalla is far removed from Turkish aggression or interference ; but it is essential for us to keep up otr fnfluence theie. sympathise, however, with Kathiri aspirations, which— 437 are m keeping with the Arab genius, whereas Sir Ghalib would import Hyderabad ideas of government into his realm. He is too autocratic for his people. I think, however, that, in the circumstances, we have no option but to bolster up our province, and that liberally. In the event of an advance against the lurks from Sheikh Othman, Makalla would not come into the spn 6 i 6 of operations at all. Our advance is the only remedy for scotching 1 urkish, Tmamic and all internal intrigues whatever.” H.F.J. Koweit Supplies. The vexed question whether, of late, supplies have been reaching the Turks and Ibn Rashid from Koweit, is still in doubt according to a Baghdad telegram of October 21 , which informs us that a large caravan of 3,000 camels, led by two Sinjarah Sham mar sheikhs, has hurried off with dates and rice from Koweit without there having been time to impose on it certain guarantees prescribed by our political and military authorities in Mesopotamia. On its arrival this caravan had brought a warrant from Turki ibn Saud, which stated that the Sinjarah were now on his father’s side, and that their dira was become part of his Emirate; but none the less it was wisely determined to take certain pre cautions to avoid eventual leakage of the caravan’s purchases. Among these was the stipulation that it should be accompanied on its return to lurki’s H.Q. by our P.O., Koweit, Col. Hamilton. This officer, after being anticipated by the hurried departure of the caravan before he has received his instructions, followed it up towards Qasim, and judgment must be suspended on its bona fides till his report comes to hand. The size of this caravan, imper fectly controlled by its chief headmen, seems to have embarrassed Koweit and conduced to its premature departure. “ Alfred 1., King of Arabia.” Those who see the Arab Bulletin may as well be warned once for all against any scheme or project whatsoever, in which a certain Breuil, of Paris, known to the Surete and self-styled “ Vicomte de Breuil,” is concerned. He is, apparently a compound of vanity, folly and knavery, who, in 1905, put out a ridiculous document under the style and title of “ Alfred L, King of Independent Syria and Arabia ” (he translates this name into Ferid when writing to Arabs). To such dignity he professed to have been elected by an assembly of twelve “ Emirs” (needless to say, wholly unknown persons, if existent at all) at Ayun, which was to be the capital of the “ Kingdom,” with a a royal domain” in Qasim, Jebel Shammar, Woshm, etc. Presumably this is Ayun in N.E. Qasim. All this and the pther fantastic nonsense concerning the resources and constitution of his “ Kingdom ” might be disregarded as sheer lunacy, if it were not clear that, from time to time, Breuil gets others to associate themselves with him and tries to launch financial schemes. Bythe latest of these, that has come to our knowledge, he hoped, in conjunction with two Englishmen (one apparently a “pigeon, the other—? ?, whose names can be furnished if desired), to secure a large order from the British, government for the exploitation of the alleged vast wheat resources, of the Hadhramaut, which, in fact, can barely supply its own inhabitants, year in and year out. This scheme was scotched last July, but perhaps not in time to save the “ pigeon ” from putting up a considerable sum of money for expenses of promotion. Breuil has tried more than once to communicate with the King of Hejaz, and though certain of his letters have been stopped, some may have got through by other channels. He was in Jiddah (as also in South Arabia) before the war, and was compelled there to admit, before the French Consul, that he had no right to the style of Vicomte. He has been before the French courts for “ escroquerie ”; but he will probably be heard of again, as he is at large and has saner associates. The Oman Rebellion. News about the progress of the rebellion against the Sultan of Mascat is very rarely vouchsafed to us, but from the simple item that the fort of Rostaq surrendered to the Ibadhi “ Imam” on August 12, we see clearly that the movement is very far from quelled. Rostaq is an old seat of the present Mascat rulers. Errata. In our last issue (No. 66 ), on p. 410, in the second paragraph, for “G.O.C. 2 nd Composite Force,” read “ Gr.O.C.

No. 68.— 439 HEJAZ AND EGYPT. history of Hejaz, since the expansion of Islam established it in the world’s eye, has been governed by the fact that it can neither finance nor feed itself. The primitive economic difficulties of the towns, Mecca, Medina, Jiddah, Yambo, etc., as well as of the rural districts, settled and un settled, were aggravated as Hejaz gradually developed into a goal of pilgrimage from all parts of the'East, the pilgrims including a large proportion of persons whose demands were on a higher plane of civilization. Though the Hajj brought money into the country, at the same time it compelled expenditure on the safeguarding and watering of routes, on accommodation, on entertainment, on upkeep and embellishment of holy places and on many other accounts, which taken together went beyond native means: and, although food caravans usually accompanied the pilgrims, these did not bring nearly enough for the whole sojourn, which often extended to months. Taif can supply Mecca, in a certain measure, with vegetables, fruit and meat, but the Holy City itself has no grazing anywhere near it for a considerable head of livestock, and none but isolated patches of lean corn-land. Medina is the only district in Hejaz, which produces any surplus of dates, and its crop is uncertain. Roundly it may be said that Hejaz, as a whole, has never been able to supply its local needs with either cereals or pastoral products ; that its chief cities, since they became places of pilgrimage, have depended on external subsidies for their municipal expenditure, and have not contributed to general revenue ; that nothing to speak of can be raised from the rural Hejaz population without causing it forthwith to cease producing its own food ; and that the indirect revenue to be derived from customs duties has never proved enough to offset the extraordinary administrative expenses involved by the pilgrimage. Nor have the resources of the contiguous and neighbouring districts of Arabia ever been of a kind or a measure to make good the deficiencies of Hejaz. In the way of food, Qasim sends it butter, and the Ateibah steppe, mutton ; but their moderate supplies are subject to much fluctuation through droughts and insecurity of transit. The Asir Tihamah has, in a good year, a little wheat, maize and millet to spare. More than one attempt has been made by Emirs of Mecca in the past to exploit the resources of the Yemen on behalf of Hejaz. These efforts have never come to anything, not so much because the caravan roads are very long, arduous and perilous, as because Yemen has next to no foodstuffs to spare. With coffee and kat cultivation to maintain, its comparatively dense popula tion grows no more cereals, and keeps no more livestock, than suffice to feed itself. Yemen exports neither corn nor cattle worth reckoning in consular trade reports. Hejaz, therefore, for the last ten centuries at any rate, has had to depend on external purveyors, who, inevitably have— 440 — become external protectors ; and of such the successive lords of Etrvpt have filled the part during almost the whole period—from the dynasty of the Tulunids to that of Mohammed Ah. It was so as early as the tenth century. Snouck-Hurgronje, the most competent European historian of Hejaz, writes (Mekka I. p. 54): “In the year 969, as the chronicles tell us, the Fatimites acquired at a great price first place in the Pilgrimage to the exclusion of the Abbasids, and ever since then the honour of mention in the Friday prayer has gone to the highest bidder... ‘ Hejaz is always dependent on Egypt for its means of life ’ wrote a geographer (Mokadassi) a few years later ; and if the Nile flood did not reach its accustomed height, Mecca went hungry for a year.” Whoever possessed himself of Egypt, conquered, ipso facto, p[ e j az —Saladin first, then the Mamelukes, then the Circassian Sultans, and finally the Ottoman Turks. The lord of the Nile for the time being needed no more display of armed force, than usually escorted the Mahmal, to assert himself in Mecca. He held the key of the larder and that was enough. The sub servience of the Grand Sherifs left little to be desired for many centuries. They professed Shiah tenets with the first Fatimites, and proclaimed their faith in the Caliph Hakim. When Selim “the Grim” sent to claim the dependencies of Egypt, they were as good Sunnis as any Turk. Their subsequent access of independence in the eighteenth century was independence not of Egyptian supplies, but of political control, while anarchy reigned on the Nile and dry rot on the Bosphorus. The moment Egypt passed once more under a single strong ruler Hejaz came obediently to heel—the more readily for having experienced, during a decade of Wahabite supremacy, what it is to hanker after flesh-pots. It is onl y since the middle of the nineteenth century that this economic, and consequently political, bond has been somewhat relaxed. With the opening of the overland route and the frequentation of the Red Sea by steam craft, the Indian granary entered into more serious competition with the Egyptian than theretofore, and by 1858 Indian traders had grown numerous enough at Jiddah to bring about our first armed intervention in Hejaz affairs. At the same time the Porte, seeing Egypt slipping ever more and more out of its control, initiated a policy designed to knit Hejaz and the other Arabian provinces directly to Constantinople—a policy which was to lead ultimately to the construction of the Hejaz railway. Symptoms of this policy were drastic interference in the succession of the Sherifate, the reigning house being dispossessed twice, in 1851 and 1880, by Ottoman mandate ; increase of the Hejaz garrisons ; taken in regard to Yemen from 1870 onwards, and in regard to Hejaz by Othman Pasha in the eighties ; and, as important as any, Midhat’s occupation of Hasam 187L l Ins last step was only part of what was planned, for tlie subjugation of Nejd‘ had been hoped for ; but even so, it gave the lurks command of the ports, including Koweit by which Iraq supplies enter central Arabia. Thus established more firmly on both sides of the Arabian peninsula, Turkey made tentative efforts to compete with Egypt in the supplying ° . l' ie caravan track from Damascus was garrisoned moie efficiently, and surra to the tribes along it was increased and regularly paid. With the opening of the Suez Canal, the way lav open for steamers, mostly manned by Anatolian Greeks, but sailing under the Turkish flag, to transport the products of Anatolia and Syria to Red Sea ports ; and, by an understanding- arrived at with the Emir Mohammed ibn Rashid in the eighties caravan traffic from Iraq and the Gulf, vki Hail or Qasim, to Hejaz was encouraged. In 1903 the Hejaz railway was begun ; by 1908 it was complete to Medina 5 and in two years moi&lt;y but for difficulties of terrain, reinforced by strenuous opposition from the Harb, whom the Grand Sherif was covertly supporting, it would have reached Mecca, and continued on its way towards Qunfudah and the Yemen. Such Ottoman measures, however, have had but little effect. Mecca is still nearly 300 miles from railhead by difficult and dangerous roads, and consignments to Medina * from the productive Syrian area compete, in cost, with those from Egypt and the Sudan no better than consignments from Iraq compete in speed of transit. Transport even by sea from the Levant is at a great disadvantage with that from Suez and Port Sudan by reason of greater coal consumption and the burden of Canal dues. The only possible rival of Egypt in the Jiddah food market is India, handicapped by distance, if till the last two years somewhat favoured by rail and port facilities. Moreover, at best, she can be an economic rival only, not a political one. We have changed the political status of Hej'az, but neither we, nor any others, have changed its economic status. Someone outside must still pay for its government and provide its food, if the former need is arranged for we may be easy about the latter. Egypt, the Sudan and India, will meet it in the future as in the past. But who shall finance Hej'az ? Even if the new Kingdom should be stretched to include some considerable part of Syria, it could not expect to get its expenses of administration out of that country. Syria is rich only by a moderate standard, and for long enough to come it will need for itself every piastre it can raise. In the still less probable event of Iraq j'oining up with Hejaz, it will be in scarcely better position to help. It has its own ruined house to set in order. This being so, there remain some four possible alternative sources of the necessary financial grants-in-aid. (1) Efkaf properties ? This means has actually been put forward as a practical proposition. But most of the richer vakufs are situated— 442 — • i + ' oil livelihood will still be Turkey after this war, and m wbat m all i , f 6 r the upkeep o£ mosques, Itl tedrf sehs ^™^what not. Moreover the sum required ? bv a free Kingdom of Hejaz will be much m excess of the total of the Ottoman surra allowances, which used to be charged on efkaf properties in Turkey sequestered by Mahmud 11. (2) Peter’s Pence ’ from the Faithful all over the world ? Well—one would be sorry to be King Husem s Chancellor of the Exchequer, introducing a 1 y id g et on estimated receipts from that source ! (3) Christia Powers ? If any of these should finance the Kingdom of Hejaz openly and directly, when there is no longer war for an excuse that kingdom will fall into such discredit in Moslem eyes that it will cease to be worth financing at all. (4) Some external Moslem state or states ? Which of these can be conceived able and willing after the settlement of the present war ? Certainly none of those that will preserve independence. And of the others is there any but Egypt that could do it ? The argument, therefore, leads us back to something not unlike, in fact, the status quo ante 1850 by whatever name it shall come to be called m, say, tyio. ’ • nan IDRISI’S OFFENSIVE. In our issue, No. 61, p. 365, we printed a statement about agreements reported by Xdrisi to have been made between him and certain Yemen elements, including Hashid and Bekil tribesmen, for a combined offensive, ostensibly against the Turkish garrisons in the Yemenite Tihamah and northern highlands. Idrisi proceeded to ask for the subsidy and supplies which had been promised to him by us in the event of his enlisting the Hashid and Bekil. After some demur, due to the difficulty of verifying Idrisi’s statements and of devising guarantees that his objectives should be such as would serve the purpose of the Allies, H.M. Government decided to fulfil its part of the pact ; and, on October 17, Aden sent Major B. R. Reilly, Assistant Resident, np to Jeizan with the total sum allocated by H.M.G., and instructions to interview Idrisi. If satisfied with his statements and plans and assured that he would accept a British liaison officer to accompany his operations, Major Reilly was to hand over the money. Food supplies were to follow. On October 21 , Major Reilly telegraphed from Jeizan that his interview had been satisfactory except in respect of the acceptance of a liaison officer. To this Idrisi firmly objected, pleading that it would indispose his tribesmen to him. Nevertheless, it was decided that the whole sum of money, rather than, as had been suggested, an instalment, should be handed to him, he being told that no more— 443 would be forthcoming for six months. He fully accepted our formula of policy ; but how far he will, or can, act up to it remains to be seen. The offensive must await the arrival of arms and supplies, the assembling of fdrisi’s own tribesmen and the enlistment of others, e.g., Hashid, in numbers which we cannot, at present, forecast. Om o\vly course has been guided rather by a sense of honourable obligation than by sure and certain hope of decisive action by Idrisi against the lurks. It is not intended that his offensive should be directed against the Imam Yahya, unless the latter should choose to send forces to fight side by side with Turkish troops. Nor, since Hashid and Bekil tribesmen, and many leading Zeidis, are among Idrisi’s proposed allies, can the offensive be regarded as a threat to the prevailing creed of the Yemen highlands. Should Idrisi, as he professes to desire, advance primarily against the Turkish garrisons of northern Yemen, his operations will be almost entirely in the Tihamah, and he will hardly, touch Zeidi country at all. Still less will he do so, if he should attempt to round up the Turks in Asir itself. We are under no obligations to the Imam Yahya; but we bear him no malice for a pro-Turk attitude, which he has been in no good position to avoid or change ; and it is our policy to support, rather than weaken the Zeidi Imamate, as an engine of f overnment. Whenever we shall have settled accounts with the urks ourselves, by expelling them with our own arms from Lahej and the Aden hinterland generally—the only action which can possibly decide the south-west Arabian issue in our favour— we expect the Imamate to range itself without rancour on our side, and to resume commercial relations with Aden. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Sheriftal Forces. There is almost nothing of importance to report about the Sherifial forces, although certain plans are ready, and the means to realize them have been organized and got under way. The sanitary-condition of Akaba having improved, (no fresh case of paracholera, which the disease is now stated to be, for five days up to November 6 and no case under suspicion), Sherif Zeid and his force of some 2,000 men are being transported from Wejh and Yambo to Akaba. Arabs, guarding the Qasim road for Sherif Abdullah, are stated to have seized a convoy of 380 sheep and 265 camels (whether laden or not is left uncertain) on its way from Nejd to Medina. Some fresh engagement between Turks and Arabs has taken place in Wadi Musa, and an Arab success is rumoured, but, as yet, not confirmed.— 444 — W e have had no indication of any fresh interruption of the railway or of telegraphic communication during the week. the Turks for their part, have been redistributing their L. cd O. troops’on a more systematic plan, the chief changes involving strengthening of the garrison in the Hish-Aneiza district, strengthening of machine-gun sections and establishment ot some additional intermediate posts, &lt;?.//., between Hill Post four and Bir Hurmas. The 161st Regiment has made another appear ance in this area, its 2 nd battalion now having its H.Q. at Demirbash and the duty of guarding the Hish light railway and forest. The strength of the 2 nd Composite force is repoited officiallv at the end of October to be 1,722 rifles on the battle front. 'This total includes 2/152nd Regiment which has been reduced to 197 rifles only. Reports, which we are not able to confirm, have come to us, via Mecca, that Fakhri Pasha has declared Medina in a state of siege, and has commandeered all dates and stopped all supplies of cooked food. Also he is said to have withdrawn to Medina all L. of C. troops from Hadiyah and south of it, while those north of that point have_ been concentrated at Medain Salih. I he capture and consolidation of Bir Saba by our troops will render communications between the E.E.F. and Feisal’s army more easy and secure and it should now be possible to open up a route via, I afileh to Kerak. Sherifial Mission to Sinai. Bir Saba affects also the mission of Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza to the Sinai Bedouins, which was arranged, in concert with King Husein, and sent out, via Auja, to Asluj about the middle of last month. It seems now hardly worth while to maintain such a mission. The patent fact that Bir Saba, the administrative centre for these Bedouins, has passed under our power will be of far greater avail in Sinai than Sherifial propaganda. The emissary, therefore, will be withdrawn shortly. Prisoner s Information. A Cadet officer of the 2 nd Camel Battalion, captured in the Bir esh-Shediyah raid (see p. 412), states that Lieut.-Col. Kemal F &gt;ey, C.G.S., Ylllth A.C., with two or three staff officers, was on the train. It was doubtless one of this party who leaned out of a window and fell back again on receiving the pointblank fire of a Bedouin. Being in the hinder part of the train, which ran backwards down the gradient, these staff officers were not captured. The cadet officer’s account of the contents of the train is fairly accurate ; but either designedly or ignorantly he has mistaken the locality of the affair, and reports it to have taken place south of Akabat el-Hejazia. He states that a reserve of wood fuel is kept at Maan for military emergencies only.— 445 NOTES. Hejaz Railway, Abu Naam to Bowat. Our railway route report is so deficient in detail south of el-Ala, that all and any information about the track thence to Medina is welcome. Lieut. A T . W. Clayton, M.C., who has been attached till lately to Slierif Abdullah’s army, has visited the line on various occasions between the Wadi Hamdh bridge, just north of Abu Naam station, and a point north, but within sight, of Bowat—a stretch of about seventy-one kilometres, or rather under forty-five miles. He sends, under date October 9 , some notes. 4'he main bridge crosses Wadi Hamdh, which has been ascending parallel with the line from Jedahah, about one and a quarter miles north of Abu Naam. This bridge is of solid masonry with fourteen arches, twelve to fifteen feet in height. Just north of it, where the mountains come down close to the rails on the east, is a Turkish post with entrenchments, sangars, and sand-bagged huts. South of it the line passes over three culverts, the first of three arches, the second of four and the third of three (square-topped), before reaching Abu Naam, where a fresh block of hills, behind which Wadi Hamdh bears away from the track, approaches on the east. The line makes a considerable south-westward curve between the main bridge and the station. From Abu Naam the south-westward direction is maintained for some two and a half miles to a point known as el-Magrah, whence the line turns south along the bottom of a shallow valley averaging seven to eight miles in breadth. The slope on either hand towards the distant hills is very gradual but steepest on the east. The level is broken only by a few stony undulations a few feet high, until after Stabl Antar station is passed. Just south of this point the foothills of Jebel Antar on the west approach within two miles and are continued to the line by a succession of isolated stony kopjes, on one of which is a Turkish post. The valley then opens out both east and west, but most on the west, into the plain of Jurf Lankomi, in the south-west of which, under the flank of Jebel Akrad, lies the Teitad oasis. The line runs on due south descending gradually to Bueir, the most important of the stations hereabout. North of the station, about 250 yards away, are a culvert and a Turkish post ; and barracks and tanks succeed on the left hand till the station is reached, ft has a sand-bagged pumping-station, some sheds and a house for the O.C.—all joined up by trenches.’ Water carried from here supplies the underground reservoirs of Stabl Antar, Bir Nasif, and Bowat. Continuing from Bueir the railway runs on south over very flat and open country for about nine miles. Then hills close in both east and west and the line has to traverse a narrow pass and descend by a corkscrew curve to the Wadi Hamdh again, which— 446 slants in from north-east. A gorge called Ruwei el-Hasak runs into the pass from the south and is held by a Turkish post. Another post guards the northern mouth of the pass. Bir Nasif station lies about five miles farther on the left bank of the Wadi Hauidli. It was not actually seen by Lieut. Clayton, who could only get a general view up and down from a point a little beyond it to the south. The line continues along the left bank of the Wadi Hamdh, rising gradually to Bowat station. There are scrub vegetation and some well grown trees in the wadi ; but more than that Lieut. Clayton could not see. He states that in the hills along this stretch of the railway, especially near Stabl Antar, there is a surpiising amount of water, which, if Abdullah’s Arabs were more enterprising and disciplined, would make the establishment of bases within raiding distance quite easy. Shehab Family. The news that two young officers from Hasbeya, of the Moslem branch of the Shehab family, who were taken prisoners at Beersheba, wish to throw in their lot with the Arab Cause (they state that they have long been members of a Secret anti- Turk Committee), recalls memories of a time when the Shehabs, led by the famous Emir Beshir of the Lebanon, were our very gxxxl allies. That was in the days of Sir Sidney Smith, Ibrahim Pasha, and the siege of Acre, nearly eighty years ago. But, while we welcome these recruits to the Arab Cause,'we must not imagine that they will bring in with them any important Lebanon or anti- Lebanon elements. The Shehabs, both Moslem and Maronite, aie a ruined family without influence now-a-days; and the Moslem part of it has been in 1 urkish service for some generations, occupying minor administrative and clerical posts. As the Syrian Personalities” volume will show, some of its members have been put by the Arab Committees on their “ Black List.447 — ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Wadi Musa Operations. Lt.-Col. Joyce has sent us at last Malild Effendi’s account o£ the battle at Elji on October 21 (^see p. 427). It conflicts, needless to say, with the enemy account, which stated Arab casualties at a figure nearly equal to the whole Arab force really engaged, and multiplied its strength sixfold. The Arab defenders numbered about 450 u regulars,” - made up of two companies Camel Corps and two Mule M.I., with two quick-firing mountain guns and four machine guns. As auxiliaries they had sixty Hudheil under Sherif Abd el-Mu’in and 120 local Naimat Arabs. The whole Arab force, therefore, w^as a little over 500 strong. The enemy, estimated at four battalions infantry (probably under strength), one regiment cavalry, and one company M.I. with six quick-firing mountain guns, two quick-firing field guns and two old ditto, attacked in three columns from Hish, Maan and Ain Busta, assisted by an aeroplane which flew out twice from Maan and bombed the position. After heavy bombardment, the Turks captured the outer works, the Bedouin auxiliaries retiring to hills south of Elji, while the Mule M.I. held on to the hills on the north, and subjected the Turks, attacking from east, to a cross fire. Only one small party of the latter got down into the wadi and was soon expelled. What the Arab Camel Corps did is not stated, but may be guessed from Jaafar’s strictures {see below). To wards evening the Bedouins worked round from the south to the Turkish left flank and forced a retirement, capturing twenty men ; and after dark, by harrying the retreat, they took also four teen men of the Medical Corps with twenty camels and ten mules. The Turks, who had to abandon some of their wounded, lost sixty killed, while Arab casualties are reported to have been forty all told : they had a mountain gun and a machine gun put out of action, the latter by a direct hit from the aeroplane. The defenders afterwards reoccupied all positions. Jaafar, in his comments, speaks w T ell of the Mule M.I. but not of the Camel Corps, with certain of whose officers he is dealing summarily. Since this battle the Wadi Musa garrison has been increased to 800 infantry with two mountain guns and four machine guns, while the mounted troops are to be withdrawn! to Akaba to be reorganized. The news of a subsequent Turkish attack on Wadi Musa, mentioned on p. 443, proves to have been a belated reference to the battle of October 21. Rumour, at present unconfirmed, reports that Audah abu Tayyi and his Hiuveitat are attacking the Shobak-Hish district and the railway about Aneiza.Railway Raids. (a) Northern Section.—UxiYsm\ et-Teheimi, with whom was Sheikh Mutlukh abn Jemian of the Beni Atiyah and some 400 tribesmen, has reported on the Hil! Post Four affair of October 18-20 (see p. 426.). He says his men attacked and captured not only this post, together with two patrols coming from north and south respectively, but, previously, a post north of Wadi Ethil, held by twenty men ; here they cut 650 (?) rails at kil. 710, isolated a relief train coming up from Tebuk, and wiped out a body of forty to fifty Circassian cavalry sent from the same place, who put up a stout resistance ; also they attacked a post of seventy Turks camped on the line between el-Hadhm and Mahtab, who offered little opposition and were all killed or captured, as was another party of s.eventy sent out from Tebuk. Altogether the two Sheikhs claim to have taken over 250 prisoners and killed 300 ; but though Lieut.-Col. Joyce thinks these totals not very far above the mark, the Sheikhs’ own premisses and enemy accounts argue that, all told, the enemy losses did not exceed, say, 250. It remains, however, a very creditable and useful performance on the part of unassisted Bedouins. In spite of recent reinforcement, the enemy reports that this section of the line is still very vulnerable, the 2 nd Composite Force having a very large proportion of sick and useless men. There has been some damage done to the railway about November 5 between Bir Hurmas and' el-Hadhm, but it seems to have been quickly repaired. On November 9, a fairly strong force of Arabs, divided into three parties, was operating at kil. 603, between Dhat el-Haj and Harret el-Amara. They held up a patrol under an officer until reinforcement arrived from the former station, and then they retired, having, presumably, inflicted losses on the patrol. One of the Maan planes, flying towards Dhat el-Haj, was put out of action by its motor overheating from lack of water, and it is doubtful if it can be repaired. On November 11 , a bridge near Khirbet es-Sumra, north of Amman, was blown up as a two-engined train, containing “ Kuchuk ” Jemal Pasha, G.O.C. VUIth Army, his staff, some soldiers and Labour Corps, was passing over it. The Pasha was not hurt, but his A.D.C. and some twenty others were killed The two engines were derailed, and, presumably, the bridge was wrecked. General. According to information given, on November 1 , by Aziz Jlfiendi, lately returned from the vicinity of the southern section of the railway, the Anazeh now holding Teima are 1,000 Wuld Suleiman tribesmen under Sheikh Mashan el-Awaji; with then, are 400 Ageyl, from King Husein’sarmy, under Sheikh Shlash, a Shammar tribesman. Ibn Rashid has moved his camp three hours eastward from Medain Salih, fearing attacks from railway raiders,149 / I V but lie remains absolutely debarred from Teima or Hail. His relations with the Turks continue strained, and special convoys of supplies are no longer sent to him. He has to get what he can from the ordinary stores of the 58th Div. at Medain Salih. The enemy has used the recent respite from railway raids to push considerable fresh supplies to Medina. The Military Commissaire Greneral himself has gone down the line from Damascus to Tebuk and Medain Salih and concerted measures for a more reliable train service, proposing even that Cardiff coal, of which he says Germany sends Turkey 400 tons daily, should be supplied to Maan. The Medina aeroplane which recently bombed the Arabs, inflicting three fatal casualties, is reported crashed near Bir Nasif and removed to its base a wreck with petrol-tank pierced by rifle fire. There is such a shortage of benzine now in Syria, that none is to be sent down the line for some months to come and we are unlikely to hear much more of enemy planes in Hejaz. The ration strength of the H.E.F. is \ stated to be at this moment, in round figures, 14,000 with 100 guns, forty-one of these being machine guns. It has 13,424 rifles, and 3,515 transport animals. The rolling stock available on the railway for its use is computed at twenty locomotives and 400 trucks. In view of the possible fall of Jerusalem, the question of evacuating Medina and the L. of C. is causing grave concern to the Turkish Higher Command. Sherif Zeid with 1,500 followers has arrived at Akaba, from which all quarantine restrictions have been removed till further orders. [Late News .—Sherif Abdullah’s parties were operating on the railway, between Stabl Antar and Bowat, on November 10 - 12 , but' we have no detailed report of their achievements. About the affair near Dhat el-Haj on November 9, we have received further information which indicates that the Arabs made some captures. It is proposed to reinforce 2 nd Composite Force at once by bringing up Camel Corps from Medina and Mule M.I. from el-Ala, both to march by road.] MESOPOTAMIA. The Diwaniyah Episode. The following account of an episode, which has hitherto remainded obscure, reaches us from the Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, and, though the events, which it relates^ belong to military operations somewhat outside the sphere of this Bulletin, we publish it here for its singular interest as an illustration of racial character.- mamawmiwmwmBa i!:il the fall of had barely “ The operations on the Tigris which led to Baghdad were so rapidly executed that the Turks j time to withdraw the small body of troops which held the distant post of Samawah on the lower reaches of the Euphrates. After the capture of Kut, Ahmed Bey, who was in command at Samawah, hurried northward. As he passed Diwaniyah lie left behind him, under charge of the garrison, consisting of a single gendarmerie battalion, a party of sick, together with their gendarmerie escort, from Samawah. On the fall of Baghdad most of the Ottoman officials at Diwaniyah evacuated the town, after distributing arms among the inhabitants and the local Shabanah to enable the place to protect itself if necessary against the tribes. As for the gendarmerie battalion, a difference of opinion appears to have arisen within its ranks as to the right course of action. A second lieutenant, a Circassian, by name Mohammed Hachim Farrukh, held,according to his own account, that they should remain until tin 1 Turks could relieve them, and on the ground that those who wished to withdraw were traitors, he caused the Commanding Officer to be hanged and he shot with his own hand two other officers. Nevertheless, the greater part of the battalion left Diwaniyah and made its way north, and it is possible that Mohammed Effendi might have done the same if he had been aware that the British were already in occupation of Fallujah ; but no authentic account of the military situation reached him and he continued to expect the speedy return of the Turks. He was left with about sixty men, some of them Turks, the rest Russian Mohammedan subjects from the Caucasus who had been taken prisoners early in the war and had accepted service in the Sultan’s army. They occupied a warehouse and an adjoining caravanserai on the bank of the Euphrates. It was an advantageous position, for the walls of the warehouse were stout and the rooms high, enabling the garrison to dominate the low buildings of the town which they could bomb at pleasure. A deep trench were cut by them down to the river bank to enable them to obtain their water supply. Apart from Mohammed Effendi’s force, there were a Sanitary Corps not under his command and a few Turkish wounded in the Serai, a building in the middle of the town. I he wounded men gave themselves up to us in the middle of duly and the Sanitary Corps in the beginning of August. The townsfolk of Diwaniyah, fearing equally the tribes beyond their gates and the Turkish garrison entrenched within their limits, begged early in Mav that a representative of the British (Tovernment might be appointed to them, and the administration be taken over by us. In the middle of Ma V a number of the principal tribal sheikhs of the district came in to Baghdad to pay their respects, and being informed that a Government representative could not be sent them until they had expelled their guests, they undertook on their return to Diwaniyah to put an end to Mohammed Effendi’s resistance 1 his, however, proved to be a more difficult matter than they i *451 anticipated. Mohammed Effendi defended himself with such success that his opponents gave up the attempt to dislodge him and declared that they could do nothing against him without guns. Early in June Salih Effendi Milli, an Arab resident of Baghdad who had been Mutessarif of Diwaniyah some years ago under the Turks, was appointed A.P.O. As long, however, as Mohammed Effendi held out it was not feasible for Salih to take up his duties at Diwaniyah ; he therefore remained at Dagharah until the atmosphere cleared. In reply to a communication which he sent at this time to Mohammed Effendi, calling upon him to surrender, the latter demanded that he and his men should be allowed to return with their arms to the Turkish forces and be given a sum of money to cover the expenses of the journey. Meantime an assurance had been obtained from the Russian Military Authorities that any Russian subjects in Yuzbashi Mohammed’s detachment should, on surrender, be guaranteed against punishment for bearing arms with the Turks. This promise was conveyed to Mohammed Effendi through the A.P.O. at Hillah (a British Officer) by the hand of an Arab officer of Shabanah ; but Mohammed Effendi refused to surrender except to British soldiers, on the plea that the Shabanah officer would not be able to protect him from the vengeance of the tribes who had suffered losses during the course of the hostilities. The position was increasingly unsatisfactory. I here was a universal desire in the town and district that Mohammed Effendi should be removed. Local politicians were unable to understand why so small a force should not be dealt with summarily by ourselves, and drew from the circumstance conclusions un favourable to us. His presence was a source of irritation and disturbance in the town and among the tribes, who were growing more and more restless, and it not only delayed the arrival of Salih Effendi, who, as above explained, had to remain at Dagharah, but also prevented the effective assumption of control of the Hillah—Diwaniyah road by the Hillah Shabanah police, so that trade was at a standstill and a general feeling of uncertainty and unrest prevailed. In duly the General Staff wrote to Mohammed Effendi intimating that we were prepared to send a British escort to take his surrender, but Mohammed still maintained his refusal to surrender except to force majeure in the shape of regular troops, and although desertions among his Turkish followers has reduced his numbers to some thirty-three men, his attitude became more confident, as well as more truculent, with the lapse of time. He now no longer thought it necessary to remain within the walls of his warehouse, but appeared openly in the streets of the town. The population lived in terror of the bombs which he did not hesitate to use if they showed any■W — 452 — opposition to his orders. Provisions he obtained by bartering military stores with which he was well supplied. Early in Au&lt; &gt;ust he tried to open negotiations with the powerful sheikhs of the Kbaza’il, doubtless in the hope that they could be induced to give him a safe conduct to Ajeimi’s camp ; but the Khaza’il sheikhs, who have suffered bitterly for the last twenty years at the hands of the Ottoman government and are perhaps more consistently anti-Turkish than any other tribesmen on the Euphrates, handed the letter to the Civil Commissioner. It was undesirable to allow r this state of affairs to continue. On August 27, a couple of aeroplanes were sent to bomb Mohammed’s detachment, and though no casualties were caused, the effect was prompt. He and his men, numbering twenty-eight, forthwith surrendered on August 29, to the official’s of the town! Sahh Effendi appeared on the scene on the following day, was ieceived w'ith acclamation as British representative and sent up the prisoners to Hillah whence they were conveyed to Baghdad. Mohammed Effendi, a fine upstanding man about forty years 0 age, stated that his prolonged resistance was due to the fact that he had constantly received news of Turkish successes from casual Arab informants and was under the impression that he was certain to be relieved. Moreover he held it to be beneath his dignity to surrender to towmsmen or tribesmen and was doubt less confirmed in this view by his fear lest they should exact retribution from him for the casualties for which he had been responsible. The British aeroplanes, however, convinced him that we were determined to put an end to the business and were in a position to carry out this resolve, and he lost no time in cfiviim himself up. He put the final touch of comedy to the'whole episode by offering to serve either ourselves or the Sherif in any I He f\ ld ’ tl (t ! OU8 ' 1 ' l ' i *' w0 ' in s ' vil1 be accepted by ethnologists) that as a Circassian he was of wood Arab descent and traced Ins lineage to the Quraish, a circumstance s erf m t ““ the more willing to carry his sword to the jn A 1 ,S 1 t e T d th!lt ’.

The Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, sends the following statement of the situation at Kerbela in September last. “Itwill be remembered that the town of Kerbela has suffered at the hands of the Turks more acutely than any other part of the Iraq during the course of the war. In May 1915, a month after the battle of Shu’aibah, the Ottoman Government made an ineffectual effort to re-establish its somewhat relaxed authority in the two holy cities, on the plea that they were harbouring deserters. On that occasion the brunt of the attack was borne by Nejel ; but Kerbela also succeeded in gaining a partial independence. The townsmen were led by a local sheikhly family, the Beit Kamunah, represented by two brothers Mohammed Ali and Fakhri ed-Din, who are men of very considerable wealth and influence. They are related to the ruling house of Persia, their grandmother having been a daughter of Path Ali Shah. But the position of Kerbela was still very precarious ; for, though it was for the moment united against the Turks, it was threatened by the jealousy of the big tribal sheikhs of the neighbourhood, especially the Beni Hasan under the two brothers I mran and Alwan, sons of Saadun, who might at any time join the Turks in an active offensive. Accordingly, in October 1915, Mohammed Ah entered into communication with Sir Percy Cox, then at Kut, and after a preliminary exchange of letters, proposed that we should undertake to make him hereditary and autonomous ruler of a sacred province extending from Samarra to Nejef. We were at the time engaged in the advance which preceded the battle of Ctesiphon, and it seemed probable that we might shortly be in close touch with Kerbela. The C.P.O. sent Mohammed Ali a friendly but colourless answer together with a small present in money for which he expressed effusive gratitude. There for the time the matter dropped, our withdrawal from Ctesiphon having changed the political outlook. We remained, however, in communication with Mohammed Ah and from time to time sent him money to assist him in retaining his adherents and maintaining his position at Kerbela. In April 191(! the Turks madea second and more determined effort to subdue Kerbela. Accusing Fakhri ed-Din of having stirred up the Ansar sheikhs to aid the townsmen against the Beni Hasan, they surrounded his house and arrested him. Thereupon the town rose and after a sharp contest drove out the Turks and established an administration under the Kamunah brothers. Mohammed Ali, who continued to be in communication with ourselves, repeatedly expressed his fear of the return of the Turks and begged for assistance against them. The well-grounded anxiety of the holy towns continued until the fall of Baghdad. A few days after that event Mohammed Ali came in to see the C.P.O. and after a short stay in Baghdad returned home with a454 — mandate to maintain order until such time as it was possible for us to deal specifically with Kerbela affairs. Short of the appointment of a, British officer with an adequate personal guard, a course which at the time was not feasible on military grounds, this was the only practicable alternative ; but before many weeks had passed it became evident that the arrange ment was not wholly satisfactory to the town. The Kamunah Zadah were said to be using their privileged position to pursue their own schemes, and a growing dissatisfaction was apparent among the other town sheikhs, chief among them the Awwad family, represented by Abdul Kerim el-Awwad, a man much more typically Arab than the Kamunah. He would possibly have more influence in the town than they, but for the disadvantage that he is poor. Although the Kamunah were no doubt making hay during a period of sunshine, there does not appear to have been much justification for serious complaint, and on the whole Mohammed Ah ran the administration well and kept the town quiet. But from the point of view of the British authorities there was a more serious grievance against the brothers. A brisk traffic in supplies with the enemy was started from Kerbela. Large caravans were reported to have come both from Damascus and Aleppo to seek foodstuffs, and the Turkish force on the Euphrates received constant supplies. The men of the Kubeisah oasis took a lively part in these enterprises. While Fahad Bey ibn Hadhdhal was at Baghdad in June, a large Syrian caravan arrived on the outskirts of Kerbela and began openly to load up. Fahad Bey at our request sent word to his son, Mali rut, to stop these proceedings ; the goods which had already been purchased were seized and brought in to his estate at Ghazazah. The owners were finally obliged to sell them and depart empty. After Fahad Bey’s agreement with us the transmission of goods by way of the desert was to some extent stopped, but with the connivance of the Kamunah the trade continued furtively along the Euphrates, through Mas’ud and Jannabiyin country, where Fahad Bey had not yet established control. It was impossible that the Kamunah Zadah could be ignorant of what was going on. There was indeed abundant evidence to the contrary. Of Mohammed Ali the best that could be said was that he passively connived in the traffic, while Fakhn was an active participant. The town police, whom Mohammed Ali, as representative of the Government, had in his employment, were used to escort safely out of the town goods destined for the enemy, and two retainers of the Kamunah Zadah were accustomed to sign the necessary passes. Cloth, rice, wheat and coffee were the favourite exports. While the large profits to be derived from the levy of fees of £1 and even £2 on each loaded camel were probably sufficient in themselves to explain the Kamunahs’ behaviour, it is also possible that they had come to realise that under British rule their grandiose personal ambitions stood small chance of materialising andf,lV'- v r,\ vere ^ lc ^ ne ^ to listen to the voice of the tempter, i he 1 arks were undoubtedly carrying on extensive propaganda among the Euphrates tribes, coupled with promises of autonomy when the Iraq should be restored to the Porte. Rumours of a rapprochement between Fakhri and the Beni Hasan sheikhs, formerly so hostile to the town sheikhs of Kerbela, and of com munications between him and Ajil ibn Samarmad, the powerful Sheikh of the Zubeid who has not yet made submission, were not reassuring. In any case, supply to the Turkish troops on the Euphrates could not be permitted to continue. On September 7, the Civil Commissioner summoned Fakhri to present himself at Baghdad on the 9 th. He complied immediately, and on his arrival it was explained to him that his undoubted participation in and encouragement of trade with the enemy had made his presence in Kerbela incompatible with military interests and that he would be sent to India as an officer prisoner of war. He accepted with resignation a decision which could scarcely have been unforeseen by him. The following day Mohammed Ali also received a verbal summons from the Civil Commissioner, through the Intelligence Officer at Kerbela, to come to Baghdad. He expressed himself willing to leave next morning, but subsequently, having received news of Fakhri’s internment, he declined to go, though given hadh 7 ca halht (assurance of personal safety) by the Intelligence Officer. The Civil Commissioner therefore despatched to him a letter by the hand of the Nawab Mohammed Husein Qizilbash, an Indian subject and a well known inhabitant of Kerbela, who has been, since the occupation, employed in the Political Office in Baghdad, explaining the reasons for the action taken with regard to lakhri and adding that since, in view of what had happened, it was not considered in the interests of the administration that Mohammed Ali should continue to act as Government Agent, a British Officer had been appointed A.P.O. If Mohammed Ali under existing circumstances preferred to retire from Kerbela, the Government would make arrangements for his residence in comfort in some other place or town in the Iraq to be agreed upon. After some hesitation Mohammed Ali agreed to obey the original summons and come in to Baghdad. In this decision he was largely swayed by the advice of Sheikh Husein Mazandarani. the leading Mujtahid of Kerbela, who urged him strongly not to disobey the orders of the Civil Commissioner, at the same time reminding him that the British Government in no wav resembled the Ottoman, and that promises of security given by us might safely be trusted. The part played by the leading iVlujtahid of Nejef, Seyyid Mohammed Kadhim Yazdi, who is the most revered of the Shiah l lema of the Iraq, was not less satisfactory. In reply to an appeal from Mohammed Ali to intervene on behalf of Fakhri, he said that he had long since retired from the world;if they wished for his opinion on the Word of God he was pre pared to give it, but he would not express any view on affairs of state. Incidentally he observed that he had no intention of declaring a Jihad against aeroplanes and motors. He consented, however, to put in a plea that the office of Kiliddar, lately held by Fakhri, might not be removed from the family. I'or the present Mohammed All’s son, Hamid, has been left in charge. Mohammed Ali is now in Baghdad, staying with the Naqib, who, at the C.C’s request, kindly invited him to be his guest until a house could begot ready for him. Ultimately he will probably elect to take up his abode in Kadhimein. He arrived in time to see his brother Fakhri before the latter left for Basrah and India. By a curious coincidence Fakhri has as his companion on the voyage Mohammed Effendi, the officer of gendarmerie who recently 7 surrendered at Diwamyah. I he last occasion of their meeting was in 1916, when Mohammed was with the I urkish troops which attacked Kerbela. The conjunction though entirely fortuitous is conducive to salutary reflections. Major Pulley is installed as A.P.O. at Kerbela and the town is perfectly quiet. According to private information volunteered by one of the Ulema of Kerbela, who has arrived at Baghdad, the religious heads of the Kerbela community are highly delighted with the removal of the Kamunah brothers, with whom, lor the sake of their personal immunity from molestation, they have been obliged to keep on outwardly cordial terms, though the truculent Kamunah excesses and oppression have been a continual source of anxiety. The support, which the authority of the Adminis tration has had in this matter from the leading Mujtahids, both at Nejef and Kerbela, has been a matter for extreme satisfaction.” ABYSSINIA. We are still without news of further developments at Adis Abeba later than what has already been reported (see p. 434) ; but more details of the causes which have led to the foreshadowed crisis have come to hand. 1 he position of the Empress is not in question. Having once been crowned, she will probably remain on the throne for her lifetime. She cannot, however, as a woman, exercise personally the supreme power in Abyssinia and must content herself with acting through a representative who thus becomes the actual head of the Government. For the past year this position has been occupied by lias Taffari in his quality of Heir Apparent, and it is only of late that his right to this position has been in any way called in question, although the Council of Ministers have always— 457 — maintained that his decisions ought to be referred to them for sanction before being carried into effect. So long as Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis was at the capital all went smoothly enough ; but, on his departure and after the fall of Bituaded Haili Giorgis, the leadership of the council passed to Dejaz Igazu who at once began to intrigue with the Empress against Ras Taffari with the idea of getting all the power into his own hands. It was an easy matter for him to persuade the Empress that the Ras was exceeding his powers and was reducing her to the position of a mere puppet on the throne and, at the same time, to spread the rumour that Ras Taffari w 7 as selling his country to the Europeans, thereby creating a hostile atmosphere among the lesser officers and ignorant soldiery and preparing the way for a coup d'etat. The execution of the plot was timed for Mascal, the principal religious feast of the year, when the national and religious feelings of the population can most easily be stirred, and Dejaz Igazu counted on the support of his god-father, Ras Demisie, and of the Mahal Safari, the latter being a composite body of some 30,000 men made up of the imperial bodyguard and of all the servants, artizans and hangers-on in the palace, and dependent solely on the Emperor of the time. Ras Taffari, by ordering, as already reported, Ras Demisie to proceed at once to his country, by collecting in Adis Abeba 5,000 of his Harrar army, and by granting a district in the Arussi to the Mahal Safari, succeeded for the moment in disorganizing the plot and the feast of Mascal seems to have passed off quietly. The main point remains however untouched, and the question for the future is whether Ras Taffari or Dejaz Igazu is to exercise the powers of government under the Empress. While it is probable that Ras Taffari must win in the end, there is no denying that Dejaz Igazu has for the moment many points in his favour. The Empress tacitly supports him, and his followers are concentrated in the Ghebi, while the adherents of the Ras, as well as his troops, are scattered in the town. Taffari himself, however, is obliged to live in the Ghebi ; if Dejaz Igazu, therefore, ever feels himself strong enough, it would be an easy matter to arrest and chain Taffari up before any support could reach him. It is doubtful that Dejaz Igazu would dare to attempt such a stroke now that the strength of the rival parties is fairly evenly balanced, and probably no decision will be come to until Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis returns to Adis Abeba. If no incident occurs before then to precipitate a crisis, it is believed that the Ras intends to make the Fitaurari Bituaded and Prime Minister with full powers to re-organize the govern ment ; and the first step to this end would probably be the dissolution of the Council of Ministers—a measure which would put an end to Dejaz Igazu’s influence.458 — NOTES. Tekrit. The news o£ Greneral Maude s capture of lekrit, the birthplace of the great Saladin, is only less welcome than that of the occupation of Gaza and most of southern I alestine by General Allenby. Tekrit is the northern frontier town of the Baghdad district on the Mesopotamian bank of the Tigris and the last settlement of any importance on either bank for over 100 miles as one ascends the river. Beyond it, on the northward road, lies almost continuous steppe desert, with rare spring or well water, as far as Shura, the first real village, which is less than thirty miles south of Mosul. Qalah Sherghat, the ancient Asshur, where a German expedition has been excavating for nearly twenty years, lies over sixty miles above Tekrit. It has been developed by the Germano-Turk command into a considerable road-station, but, like all the Tekrit-Mosul road, it can be harried by the Jerba Shammar from el-Hadr, and is surrounded by desert. We can now close the caravan track from Tekrit to Hit, which has been developed of late by the Turks, and they can only open another, and considerably longer one (over 100 miles) from Hit to Qalah Sherghat by conciliating or terrorising the Shammar. The Duleim, hitherto their allies, also range in these parts. Tekrit itself is a place of some 5,000 inhabitants, who live of their gardens and the profits of rafting trade downstream and the ferry to the left bank of the Tigris. They have numerous primitive river- craft. In the wars of the 11th to the 13th century armies often chose Tekrit as their point of passage. More about Shahturs. Later Intelligence Summaries from the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force supplement the information given on p. 422. It appears that Birejik is building shahturs in great numbers, though Jerablus is still the general assembling yard. They are towed back by man power, after finishing their trip, a deserter having seen forty a day being dragged up stream. On September 2 , there were seventy-five pairs of ordinary shahturs in the yard at Jerablus, and also four designed to carry especially heavy weights. An agent, considered “fairly reliable,” states that he left Jerablus on September 2 , in a convoy of twenty-five shahturs carrying 250 infantry, ammunition, supplies and entrenching tools. They reached Hit on September 19. Yon Miicke is said to be now at Meskineh.SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN. No. 70.SECRET. Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel., Cairo, November 21, 1917. No. 70 SUMMARY. RAMADI AND THE TRIBES. ARABS IN THE EAST INDIES. ARABIA. Nejd. Visit to Riyadh.RAMADI AND THE TRIBES. It has taken a little time to appraise even the first ettects of the Kamadi victory on the local tribes, but the I ohtical Office, Baghdad, is now in a position to give us the following information, under date November 16 : The effect has been conspicuous first and foremost on the hostile ^Duleim tribe, whose co-operation with the Turks upon their Euphrates L. of C., and also on the desert road from Hit to Tekrit, has long been of importance to the enemy and handsomely paid for. The paramount sheikh of the Bedouin sections of this tribe, Ali ibn Suleiman esh-Sharqi, who has a house at Ramadi, surrendered to our troops there, and with Sheikh Hardan, chief of the A1 Bu Dhiyab section, proceeded to Baghdad to offer the tribe’s submission in form. This was accepted and the two chiefs were sent back to Ramadi to make good their promises by active help-to our forces ; but, no-one being certain how long they will wear their coats turned outward, each has to send a son to be kept at Baghdad in guarantee of good faith. The Zobaa tribe also, which ranges near Khan Maqdam and the rail-head of the Decauville line to Baghdad, and for some time has been harrying the road from Fellujah to Mahmudiyah, has bowed to the blast, and its Chief, Dhari, has made reluctant submission. As for the great Zobeid tribe, which ranges across the Jezirah from Hillah on the Euphrates to Kut on the Tigris, it has not yet come in definitely ; but Ajil ibn Ali Samarmad, its chief in the Hillah district, who has always kept aloof from us and has now gone to the Shatt. el-Hai, is reported to be shaken, and ready to take an opportunity of submitting, if his face can be saved. Ajeimi Saadun is still out against us, though he has not had much success in raising from the Bedouins about Hit and Kebeisa the levies he promised the Turks {see p. 411). He has been on a visit to the enemy at Hit, but is now back at his own camp at Bir el-Lussaf in the desert some seventy miles south west of Nejef. The great Anazeh tribes of the Shamiyah and the north Syrian Desert are all showing friendly dispositions. Fahad ibn Hadhdhal is encamped between Kerbela and Nejef, and beside him is now T the other great Amarat chief, Mohammed ibn Mijlad, newly returned from the Pilgrimage with a letter from King Husein. But he is not quite at one with Fahad, whose claim to control the Dahamishah section he contests. He swears, however, that he is as much our friend and ally as his rival. Col. Leachman, who is looking after him and his brother, Jazaa, chief of the Zebinah sub-section, proposes to put his professions to some proof. The Seba are coming slowly southward under Mohammed ibn Murshid, Ibn Fiqiqi and Ibn Qurdush, and have— 461 — Padang to prepare the way for German penetration of western Sumatra and the establishment of some controlled port, such as Sabang, to compete with Singapore. They are said to number 40,000 in Java and Celebes alone. Many of them are rich business men, wdio form a kind of informal Trades Union among themselves, and advance their political power by effective and enlightened means, e.g., the founding of schools or colleges, and also religious associations, in which their exceptional knowledge of Koranic literature gives them first place. The result is that their social influence is far greater than their relative numbers warrant. “ Singapore and Penang ” adds Mr. Warner, also “carry an influential core of Arabs, closely related to the Java and Celebes Arab settlers; but the Arabs of Java consider themselves— and are considered by their Singapore brothers—as the leading community. But this preponderating influence, due partly to wealth, partly to larger numbers and partly to longer local standing, wielded by the Arabs in the Dutch East Indies, is to some extent balanced by the respect for British administration and justice held by the British subjects, the Singapore and Straits Arabs.” The author says it is now to us, the British, and no longer to the Germans that the East Indian Hadramis look. It was not so three years ago. Then the “ German propaganda had turned the Arabs judgment. German influence, subsidization by the German Consulate-General with its monetary promises and its Turkish alliance, moving on the steady well-calculated German system, had supplanted all other influences, and the opening phases of the war began to clinch the matter to our disadvantage. In Batavia, the power of Mongus, the Arab 4 captain ’, was a most potent influence for evil. Mongus had the Turkish Consul-General entirely at his mercy ; he had the main part of the vernacular press as his organ ; and he voiced in no uncertain fashion the belief which he felt in the German propaganda with its specious Islamic promises. Even in Singapore, where they had amassed under British protection such large fortunes, the Arabs were beginning to feel the agitation. But Seyyid Omar Alsagoff, the head of the community, in spite of the efforts which the Germans no doubt made to influence him, stood firm in his loyalty. Though decorated in the past by the Sultan of Turkey ; though holding- large house property in Mecca and Arabia ; though wedded to a Turkish lady—he nevertheless used all his undoubted power in preaching loyalty to Britain, offering his house at Jiddah for any purpose to which the British Government might desire to put it. On Turkey joining the Germans, an active pro-German campaign was energetically carried out The vernacular press in Batavia, etc., published articles by the Turkish Consul-General, written in Malay and Javanese, decrying the British and emphasizing the German advance. Vague but splendid promises were freely thrown out, and there— 462 — is no doubt that the Arabs and many of the Sarikat Islam leaders believed in these and also in the speedy downfall of British power.” This propaganda, however, has failed of its purpose, and at this moment the Hadramis, who have become interested in the Arab Movement and particularly in the Sherifial Revolt, are turning towards us, in the hope of obtaining better com munications with Arabia, and greater freedom of intercourse with their homeland. They have been sorely tried by our necessary measures of control at Singapore and Aden, the two inevitable stages on their route to and from Hadramaut. What they ask is, according to Mr. Lee Warner, thus expressed. “ You ought to make a consular post of Makalla with a British officer. If that is impossible because you British think the Sherif might be offended, surely you can appoint at Makalla an Arab official from one of your known supporters in the Straits. “ Thus you could prove your active sympathy with us. Give us also a post office, and a money order system direct. Later, perhaps you might establish a telegraph and abolish all these passes, photographs, consular certificates, questions as to why we wish to go to our old home, why we wish to take so much money to our old parents, etc., etc., etc.” The petitioners pointed out that they, the Hadramis, are still “the intellectual leaders of Islam in the East. If we helped them now in the sense above indicated, they would easily obtain the withdrawal of practically all the Arabs from Mongus and the Germano-Turkish party ”. Commenting upon the full Report, of which the above is only a partial precis, Lt.-Col. H. F. Jacob writes :— u What the Arabs in the East Indies require is ‘■help’ from us to have free intercourse with Hadramaut. Many of these people are directly subjects of our Sultan, Sir Ghalib of Shihr and Makalla, but an equal number are Kathiris whom Sir Ghalib claims as his subjects but cannot win over to his side except with large sums of money. These Kathiris have long wished to expand, and to gain their own port east of Makalla. This Sir Ghahb would strenuously oppose, as he fears they will then set up a kingdom of their own and work for direct communication with the Aden Residency. I am bound to say that it is mainly tins long-standing difference with the Sultan of Makalla and his suppression of their ideals that has driven the Kathiri Sultans and people to seek help elsewhere, and for this reason thev have intrigued with the Imam of Sanaa before this war, and lately with the urks. I never believed that this intrigue would affect us closely m Aden, but it naturally upsets the autocratic rule of our Dultan on Ghahb, and so he makes the most of it. It may be said that we are bound to uphold Sir (jhalib’s authority ; out, as a matter of fact, his authority inland is far 1 Jfrom strong, as many incidents in recent years have conclusively proved, in putting all our money on Sir Ghalib, we are bound to withstand kathm progress and thereby cannot but offend the susceptibility of Arabs in the East Indies. We have never admitted the validity or existence of the Sultan’s absolute rule over the Kathiri, or, indeed, the fact of the extended influence— which he asseits does exist in his own Hinterland ; but we have assented to his acquiring what authority he can by the tactful use of largesse. It is manifestly better to have one ruler, if stiong, than several; but the genius of the Arab peoples is diametrically opposed to our wish, and Makalla is too far from Aden for our power to be fully known there and exercised. Sultan Sir Ghalib is little more than a nominal ruler, and the sooner we recognise facts, the sooner will intrigues there cease, and Hadramaut begin to develop ; and only then may we hope to have the Arabs in the East Indies content. A local Post Office and Telegraph Office in Hadramaut would largely benefit the Hadramis, who earn their livelihood in Java and Singapore. It would, of course, at the same time make Hadramaut less dependent on Aden, looking to the Treaties as they to-day stand. Curiously enough, the suggestion came from Sir Ghalib himself in the early part of 1914 ”. ARABIA. Nejd. Visit to Riyadh. The following has been received through the Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, from Dr. P. W. Har rison, of the American Medical Mission, Bahrein, who went up to Riyadh, in August last, on a professional visit to Ibn Saud :— “ The trip to Riyadh is not an extremely hard one, even in summer, unless the effort is made to travel very rapidly. From Hassa to Riyadh the journey may be done in six or seven days in comparative comfort and in the spring it would be a pleasure. Most of the territory passed over seems utterly barren, but the strip of sandy desert, or £ Dahana ’ as the Arabs call it, abounds in excellent forage. This serves to support nothing more than thousands of gazelle ; but if an occasional well could be sunk in this area the number of sheep, camels, etc., that could be raised would be almost unlimited. The country from Hassa to Abu Jifan and from there to Riyadh (this was the road travelled both going and returning), contains nothing which suggests any mineral resources to an untrained eye. In places the country is somewhat rough, more particularly between Abu Jifan and Riyadh, but no mountains are seen, nothing indeed, more than comparatively low hills.464 — The most complete peace and quiet reign everywhere. Unprotected caravans travel anywhere without tear. A camel- load of silver money revenue from Hassa on its way to Kiyacih, accompanied our caravan of nine individuals ; it _ was quite unescorted by soldiers, but this fact did not even excite surprise or comment. Hassa is the commercial centre of Central Arabia. Its capital city is made up of three divisions, one of which is called the ‘Kut ’ or Hofuf. Bedouins come here to sell ghee, etc., and to buy dates and other things they wish, in numbers that are simply tremendous. I was assured that nowhere in Arabia could they be met with in equal numbers. The local resources are large. Date gardens stretch for miles. There are some fifty or seventy odd centres of population m addition to the capital, and many of these contain several thousands of people. A closer touch with the outside world would bring about a very con siderable commercial development owing to the fact that the principal product, namely dates, is superior in quality to anything raised elsewhere. These are disposed of to poor advantage now, owing to very inferior packing, none whatever going to Europe. Hassa’s population is for the most part Shiah in religion, the artisans, gardeners, etc., belonging to that section of Islam. The Sunnis are for the most part property owners, and form a sort of aristocracy both of money and position. The place is tolerant and would welcome more contact Avith the outside world, especially if such contact was obviously profitable.* The religious and political centre of Central Arabia is Riyadh. Judging from the character of the people, it will remain the centre. It is a small place, smaller than Amarah. Apparently a large part of the population is made up of those connected in some way with the ruling house. It has no independent commercial importance, nor has it any prospect of attaining to such. A narrow rim of date gardens surrounds the town. Water can be obtained in many places, but only at a depth of ninety feet, more or less, which makes irrigation very laborious. The soil appears to be excellent. The people are all Sunnis and Wahabis, although this latter term they dislike. They consider themselves Hanbalis. Abdul Aziz ibn Saud is not to them a political leader. He is their religious head. It is on this basis that he commands the devotion of the Bedouins and is gradually uniting them behind him. His military strength depends on his success in uniting the numerous tribes and it is easy to see that nothing occupies his effort and attention as much as this does. The members of the different Bedouin tribes visit him in great numbers his guest houses frequently containing a thousand or fifteen hundred . * The above in regard to Hassa is based on a residence of four days and is of necessity largely gathered from conversation, etc., rather than from personal observation.of them. They are cordially welcome to stay as many days as they wish, the customary Arab rule of three days being quite suspended. No one goes away without a gift, which appears to average in value certainly several rupees. Riyadh is the centre of the organization of the £ Ikhwan’, a Bedouin society which exists to promote the spread of pure religion, in the extreme Wahabi sense, among the different tribes. The abolition of all intertribal warfare is one of its cardinal doctrines. Three hundred and more of these ‘Ikhwan’ are being educated in Riyadh to be religious teachers of the different tribes. They are supported by the Ruler, and to join their number anyone of the ‘ Ikhwan’ has only to signify his desire for similar training. r £he society numbers many thousands in many different tribes and supports the present ruling house in Riyadh enthusiastically. Very little is heard in ordinary conversation concerning the present European war. The Bedouin knows very little about it and cares less. The city dwellers are better informed, but they say very little because they dare not. As far as can be judged Nejd is pro-British only because the ruler compels it. The war has had almost no direct effect upon the people. Rains in the desert and good date crops in the cities have made times rather better than usual. Abdul Aziz, the ruler, is an Arab of very unusual endow ments. A courteous host and a natural gentleman, he is a ruler of great force and even severity. He has acquired a considerable knowledge of the world and shows great intelligence in his grasp of present conditions. There is no doubt of his warm personal regard for several of the British Political Agents whom he has met, most of all for the late Captain Shakespear and for Sir Percy Cox and Captain Loch. His admiration for the British administration of India and the Gulf is very great, though not unmixed with criticism of certain things, particularly the character of some of the native under-officers. In his opinion the campaign in Mesopotamia has not been without mistakes as, for example, the failure to assign at least one steamer to passenger traffic upon the fall of Baghdad, so that Arabs travelling in and out might have carried the news everywhere, and so have secured the maximum influence on Arab attitude. He feels too, that adequate management might certainly assign to the carrying trade of the Gulf two steamers instead of one, thus securing for Nejd,along with the other districts served, bi-weekly visits, instead of the considerable hardship of the present irregular monthly service. His own personal relations with the British, however, seem to have afforded him the greatest pleasure and there can be no doubt of his conviction that his own best interests and those of his country are to be advanced by cultivating present pleasant relations. It is easy to see that he is anxious to promote further association with the British and looks forward to increasing its intimacy.”I ' Ml; — 466 — North-West. Intelligence. Uarl&gt; Unrest. Since the events related on page 428, there has not been any fresh manifestation of unrest among the Harb, so far as we know ; but disaffection certainly continues, in not only the Masruh and Hawazim but some other Beni Salim clans. It is to be attributed in part to solicitations by Ibn Rashid since he has been hi the Medina district, in part to the sinister influence of Sheikh Husein Mubeirik, who still lurks in the high ground behind Rabugh, but more to the stoppage of Harb supplies and payments by King Husein. After all, have not these Harb clans robbed all and sundry for centuries on the Medina-Mecca roads ? They hardly know any other way of life, and still expect to be bought off as in the past. The King does not seem seriously perturbed, but is using the situation as a lever for obtaining an increase of his subsidy. Sherif Ali sent Sheikh Baraka to the Hawazim to see what could be done to keep them quiet, and declares that, in any case, he can dispense with their alliance and get up his supplies through Juheinah country. Our representative at Jiddah has some suspicion of the governor, Sherif Muhsin, hereditary Emir of the Harb, in all this matter. Railway Raids. (a) Southern Section .—The operations of Sherif Abdullah’s and Sherif Ali’s parties noticed on page 449 have resulted in the burning of Bowat station, the destruction of enemy posts south of Bowat and north and south of Stabl Antar station, the annihilation of a Turkish platoon and Arab occupation of this station itself for several hours. So far as we can unravel the course of events, they happened thus. During the day of November 11 , an Arab attack was made with artillery on Bowat station and though it was repulsed with the aid of reinforcements sent from both south and north, a part of the permanent wav was destroyed. During the night following the line was cut north and south of Stabl Antar, and on the morning of the 12th an attack was made on the station. After bombardment, the Arabs charged, and though beaten off for the time from the station itself, they captured an advance post on the north and another on the south, together with a platoon which sallied to the assistance of the latter from the station barracks. These posts had resisted _ stoutly. Later the Arabs seem to have got into the station with two guns and four machine guns, and by their fire they drove back a relieving force, sixty’ strong which had come down from Hadiyah. The latter, ’ however’ succeeded m clearing the line to the north, and holding on till nightfall ; then it retraced its steps under cover of darkness and rushed btabl Antar again. What happened immediately after that we do not know, but, on the 15th, a detachment sent up * iff— 467 from the south relieved the station and found its garrison reduced to twenty-six men of whom thirteen were wounded. The enemy reports his missing at two officers and sixty-five men ; but, as lie has not included his own wounded (or, perhaps, his killed), in these figures, his total casualties, at Stahl Antarand Bowat together, may safely be put at least as high as two hundred. The relieving force, which was commanded by Ghalib Bey, then under took a raid towards the oases of the Jurf Lankomi plain, Tchad (see p. 445) and Kattar, but unable to bring Abdullah’s Arabs to battle or pursue them far, returned to Bueir. From information given by Capt. Depuis, who has arrived slightly wounded at Jiddah, it appears that, prior to the above affair, Bowat station had been held awhile and burned out by Sherif Ali’s force, assisted by French Algerian elements. Its garrison and those of some posts towards Hafira were cleared out. Capt. Depuis got his wound in one of the latter encounters, being left alone with his Algerians and gallantly extricating himself and his men. (5) Norther?i Section .—A telegraphic report from Lt.-Col. Joyce about the Dhat el-Haj affair of November 9 or 10 , (see pp. 448-9) states that the Arab captures amounted to*- an officer and twenty-seven men, who have all been brought into Akaba by the Beni Atiyah. These tribesmen encountered a train which stopped to put off a wood cutting party of forty men, who, before proceeding, attacked the Arabs, and, according to report, were all killed or captured. But it is not clear whether one fight or two took place, whether the officer and twenty-seven men prisoners came from the wood-cutting party or from a post attacked previously. Since then the line and telegraph have been cnt again south of Maan, on or about the 17th. As a sequel to the Khirbet es-Sumra raid (see p. 448), a strong attack, of which we have no details, seems to have been made on el-Hasa station on November 12 or 13. A bridge, presumably that of three arches, twenty-five feet high, just south of the station, was blown up and remained still unrepaired a week later. General. The 2 nd Composite Force is fast losing strength. Against 1,722 rifles at the end of October, it reports 1,576 in the middle of November, while 2/152nd Regiment has fallen from 197 rifles to 148. The Austrian Instructional Mission at Maan (see p. 428) has been ordered back to Damascus at once. Following on the disaster to the Palestine Army, an interchange of views about the position and future of the Hejaz Forces has been taking place between Damascus and Medina. I he plan approved at present involves a reduction of the H.lt.I., the victualling of Medina for a year’s siege, and the withdrawal of all other troops (i.e., balance of H.E.F. and the two Composite Forces) to Amman, leaving the Holy City to the protection of its owngarrison and entrenchments. It remains to be seen whether a year’s supplies can be got down the line. Complete evacuation of the H.E.F. in one operation has been judged certain to prove disastrous in both a political and military sense : but the plan now approved offers the Arabs several chances of bringing about such disaster piecemeal. Meanwhile the Line Commissaire General, Shevket Pasha, is to stay at Medina and supervise preparations. [Late News .—Sherif Abdullah reports that the enemy lost two officers and 122 men killed and two officers and seventy- seven men prisoners, in the Stabl An tar—Bowat affair, noticed above. Since this total of prisoners coincides very nearly (reading a seven for a six, or vice versa) with the enemy’s report of missing, it may well be that the total of killed is also not far wrong. Abdullah, who has an advance camp in Jebel Antar, reports that he has occupied Jebel “ Rohays ” (? = Ruwei, see p. 446). Capt. Depuis supports the Arabs’ reports that their own casualties were very light indeed. Ferhan el-Aida and his Anazeh have broken the railway near Jedaha. The G.O.C. 1 st Comp. Force has been ordered to send the 7th Cavalry Regt. and the Circassian Cavalry to Amman. Both are weak units. A battery accompanies them. Hamad es-Sufi, the Ferabin chief from Bir Saba, is now at Akaba.] NOTES. Koweit Supplies. In continuation of what we published on page 437 we now hear that Colonel Hamilton arrived at Bureidah on October 30, and was well received by the Emir Turki, I bn Sand’s son, and bv the governor and townsfolk. Turki assured Colonel Hamilton that lie was taking every precaution to prevent leakage of supplies from Qasim to either Medina or Hail, and that, to lessen the possibility of it, the friendly Aslam Shammar and Ibn Hadhdhal s tribes were now commissioned to do most of the carrying trade from Iraq and Ivoweit. He had not intended to vouch tor the large caravan which has caused the recent trouble ( 6 -^ p. 437), but merely to give the Shammar elements in it sate conduct as far as Koweit, through his own tribes.

Y e now hear that, after the capture of the outlying positions, the fortress surrendered with but little fighting. A triumphal entry was made, and orders were given to destroy the town and level the fortifications to the ground. Messengers to Adis Abeba from the north profess complete ignorance of the fate of Lij Yasu, of whom nothing has been heard since the battle at Dessie. Owing to the death of Ras Abata, Governor of Dessie, Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis is still detained there, and reports that he cannot leave until a strong man has been nominated as successor. As this matter has not even yet been discussed, though it was known for some time that Abata’s illness must end fatally, the return of the army is likely to be postponed for some time.ARAB BULLETIN.

Director, Arab Bureau.- 471 — THE ARAB LEGION. ntl,„, The i fir f t dra u’ c 1 om ,P r T isin g twenty-eight officers and 357 othei ranks from the Arab Legion, trained at Ismailia, has been sent to Akaba for service with Sherif Feisal’s forces. The hones with which this Legion was planned some months ago were set out ,n our No. 53 (p. 263). They have been so imperfectly realised m practice, and appear so little capable of realization wi i the material at the Allies’ disposal, under existing political conditions, that the original plan and organization of the Legion must come up for drastic reconsideration. The matenal has consisted in the main of volunteers from amonp' prisoners of war, sent in the greater part from India. Certain omcers and men, mostly Syrians, had been selected in Eoypt previous to the arrival of the Indian contingent; but it was not till the latter disembarked about two months ago that definite incorporation could begin. It had been hoped that the Legion might be used in the Palestine campaign, but it was soon manifest that this destination would arouse such various and dissonant political passions among its heterogeneous elements (including some sixty-five Christians and thirty-five Jews), that there was nothing for it but to put beiore the men in training the simple purpose of joining the forces of the King of Hejaz and fighting for Arab Unity under his banner. This course was the more inevitable since the contingent from India had had that destination and that alone put before it when invited to volunteer, and had already shown an uproarious disinclination to be delayed or diverted from it; and it was very soon clear that, if the Legion was to be officered only by men of the same races as its rank and file, its use in conjunction with European troops was wholly impracticable. The task of training a unit which had none but such officers, and these in many instances inefficient or contumacious, put as severe a strain as could be conceived on the Europeans in charge of the Ismailia base, who were in the unsatisfactory position of having responsibility without direct authority. It is to their great credit that they imposed in so short a time a veneer of discipline and some military cohesion, which enabled the draft to go off at the last, making a fair appearance and likely to come up to the not very high standard of Hejaz “ regulars.” But whether it is at all worth while to train a second draft for Hejaz, after the experiences we have had, is more than doubtful. There are left now at the Ismailia base only half-a-dozen undesirables out of the first material (who will probably be re-interned), and some 226 recently arrived recruits from Yemen. About the latter there is little question but that they must have British officers; nor is there any question either that they must not follow the first draft to the Hejaz. They have no touch with King Husein whatever, and it is perfectly futile to talkrBfatfirflfnrri — A i 1 f ft — 472 — to them about Arab Unity, whether under his fla^ or any other. They are purely mercenary material, which only its own chiefs, or Europeans can lead to any useful purpose ; and it should be noted that these particular Yemenis, recruited at Aden, regard themselves as British subjects, and expect to fight with British forces. They might usefully be returned later to Aden, to form the nucleus of a native army there. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Akaba Operations. It was reported by Lt.-Col. Joyce on the 22 nd that the Turks had evacuated Ain Busta and concentrated upon Abu Lisal. This latter post now has two battalions of infantry with four mountain guns and four machine guns. The Turks are holding a line from Abu Lisal to Ain Dor, and were being attacked at the time the despatch giving the above information was sent. The problem of holding Elji and the Wadi Musa is causing Feisal anxiety ; all supplies and especially forage are a difficulty, and at present sufficient blankets are not forthcoming for troops used to warmer climates. Yet, for reasons rather political than military, Feisal is very unwilling to relinquish the first settled village he has taken from the Turks, the occupation of which he considers to be an outward and visible sign of his intention to move northwards. Cholera at Akaba. It has unfortunately, been found necessary to re-impose quarantine restrictions on Akaba as from the 22nd inst, and to close all Red Sea Arabian ports, except Jiddah, to arrivals from the infected area, there being no possibility of satisfactory isolation and control at such places as Wejh or Yambo. This precautionary action has arisen from two cases ending in death, on the 18th and 19th of the month respectively, one an Arab merchant of Akaba, the other a Bedouin. The medical examina tion established Asiatic cholera in each case. There had been also an earlier case on November 11 —a Turkish prisoner, who died suddenly while awaiting embarkation for Egypt. He had been twelve days in Wadi Musa and eight in Akaba. As the “ cholera recurrence reaction ” in this case was found to be faint and the case seemed unique, no quarantine was imposed in consequence. We have heard of no further deaths or suspected cases up to the 25th. «# «*473 — Railway Raids. {a) Northern Section .—We have received news through Akaba, that, on November 7, a party under Major Lawrence and Sherif Ali ibn Husein blew up a twp-eugined train somewhere on the line west o£ Deraa. The casualties of the enemy are stated to have been considerable. . The original objective of this party was found impossible to attain, and it seems to have retraced its steps to Kasr el-Azrak, and from there to have undertaken certain operations against the Hejaz railway in conjunction with other parties. The whole stretch from Zerka to el-Hasa has been attacked at various points. The same ^Akaba information states that a Beni Sakhr party, under Sherif Husein Shakrani, has broken “an important bridge’’ north of el-Hasa, taking forty-five prisoners, including Sami Bey, Kaimmakam of Maan, and a BimMshi of the Medical Corps, and fifty-six rifles and much other booty. This, no doubt, is the bridge guessed on page 467 to have been south of the el-Hasa station and broken on November 11 or 12 . It is probably the stone bridge of six twenty-five foot arches about thirty kilometres up the line under Jebel Hafira. The raid south of Maan, mentioned on page 467, on or about November 17, took place at kil. 510, north of Akabat el-Hejazia. It resulted in the destruction of a dozen rails, and the cutting of the telegraph wires. Lieut. Pisani was with this party which has now returned to Akaba. (5) Southern Section .—Sherif Abdullah has sent in a further report of the Stabl Antar operations {see pp. 466, 468), raising the Turks captured to ninety-three, and the killed to 250. He says all intermediate enemy posts are now withdrawn, and troops are concentrated in stations only. He is trying to capture one of these, and is in strength in the southern part of Jurf Lankomi, in spite of an extended reconnaissance made to Abu Lelu, fifteen kilometres west of Jedaha, by Grhalib Bey. The break between Bueir and Stabl Antar was reported still un repaired on November 20. Ferhan el-Aida, acting from the east {see p. 468), and a party of Sherif Abdullah’s troops, acting from the west under Sherif Shakir, on the 19th-20th, destroyed two culverts and 550 rails near Jedaha. On enemy reliefs coming up from south (Ghalib Bey’s force) and north, the Arabs retired, but apparently continued to menace Hadiyah. (Sherif Abdullah reports four culverts broken and twelve kilometres of rails destroyed in the above affair. No doubt, as usual, he means demolitions here and there over a total length of twelve kilometres.) In the hope, no doubt, of getting some Bedouin help in this region, Abdul Hamid Bey, the Turkish Commissary with Ibn Rashid, has asked that the Fuqara chief, Sheikh Shehab, a Turkish stipendiary now detained at Damascus, be sent down to el-Ala.474 — General. A force of about 1,000 Anazeh tribesmen left Wejh on the 21 st for Teima, where they will constitute a Sherifian garrison. Some reinforcement is certainly needed east of the southern section of the railway, since it is reported that the Harb, ranging east of Medina, have followed the example of the Hawazim and refused to allow Sherifian operations there. The Hawazim themselves seem, for the moment, appeased. Sherif Sharraf has taken up a reconnoitring party from Jeyadah towards el-Ala with a couple of mountain guns. His success will depend on whether the enemy s Mule M.l. has been sent north, in obedience to orders against which the local O.C. has protested. There is no doubt that the central section of the Maan- Medina line is in a very precarious case, the L. of C. troops and 2 nd Composite Force having over forty per cent of their strength unfit, and their animals in a very weak state. Deserters are said to be coming in freely from Medina and in a very weak state. Basil Pasha, O.C. 2 nd Composite Force, has been given some weeks leave and his command has been taken over by Atif Bey, late O.C., Damascus district, who, in turn, is succeeded at Damascus by Munib Bey, late O.C., Kerak. Someone, probably at German instigation, has been carrying off, without authority, two Nabathaean funerary statues from the rock-tombs near el-Ala. We have photographs of these taken in situ by Pere J. Jaussen before the war. \_Late News .—Colonel Joyce informs us, nnder date November 23, that the majority of the Darausha and Dumaniyah Huweitat have gone eastward. The tribe is very anarchical and refuses to recognise Audah or anyone else as Paramount Chief. Mohammed ibn Jazi Colonel Joyce regards as a bad type of Bedouin. His clans are at present in the Gueira—Fiji district, as are also the Suleimaniyah, Neiamat and Rikabat clans. The Beni Atiyah are concentrated at el-Ayana. King Husein’s youngest son, Zeid, has gone up to Gueira and been well received by the garrison. Captain Depui, with a reconnoitring party, mounted, accompanied by guns, and composed of Algerians and Arabs, leached, on October 29, the well of Dersiya, only eleven kilometres fiom Medina and four kilometres south-east of Muheid station. Here a deserter joined them. They were not attacked.] Asir. Idrises Projects. We have received Major Reilly’s full report of the mission which he undertook in October to Jeizan (see p. 442) • also General Stewart’s covering despatch to the High Commissioner and copies of certain letters communicated ' by Idrisi. The mission, on which Major Reilly was accompanied by Lieut.— 475 — Guise (Intelligence Officer) and Mr. Ali Ibrahim (Interpreter), was more worthily received than previous missions have been, and its two interviews with Idrisi took place in the open day! Idrisi s motor-car was brought out, and the officers were shown the country about Jeizan and some of Idrisi’s agricultural enterprises ; but they were not encouraged to proceed, as they desired, to the fighting front in the Abs country. They had opportunities of talking to the Hasliid and Bekil chiefs' who were at Jeizan ; but, unfortunately, Nasir Mabkhut’s very indifferent state of health prevented Major Reilly from having much conversation with the most interesting 1 of them. © The Hashid and Bekil chiefs actually at Jeizan, or known to be taking part in actual operations for Idrisi, or expected shortly, were (beside ISTasir Mabkhut himself) the following important Hashid sheikhs: Masud el-Barak, Salih ibn Ma’id Moghrabi, Ali ibn Rafai, Jubran el-Ghashim—all of the Dim Udhrah—and also Hasan Mukbil Fara of the Dim Fari, Salih ibn Muslih of the Himran (Nasir Mabkhut’s nephew), and the Sheikh of Kharif Qudemi. The Bekil were represented by Ibn Hebeish of Sufian, Nagib Ali Husein Mahfal and Yahya ibn Yahya esh-Shaif (the two last not actually arrived at Jeizan). About 1,600 Hashid tribesmen are stated to be now under arms at el-Khushm above Raigha and in the hills, and ISTasir Mabkhut talks of calling out some 8,000 more. The Bekil could add 4,000 to 5,000 men under Yahya ibn Yahya esh-Shaif. A third of these ask for rifles ; all need ammunition, and all are reported ready and willing to fight—if well paid. So far, therefore, Idrisi has justified his claim to have numerous Hashid and Bekil tribesmen at his call on certain simple conditions. As for his own forces, he says that, at present, he has in the field 5,000 of his home tribesmen (of Abu Arish, Sabbiyah, Beni Marwan, Masareha and Jaafara) and 5,000 auxiliaries from the allied tribes of Beni Abs (part only), Aslam and Nashar. He is maintaining outposts along the hills from the Abs country to Jebel Khaulan esh-Sham, and towards Saadah. The Rijal el-Ma, who are fighting independently about Ebhah, are said to have 7,000 men out. They look to Idrisi for ammunition, and he proposes to leave the Ebhah Turks to their enterprise. As for Idrisi’s own plan of campaign, it is unnecessary here to go into it in detail. Briefly the first phase is to consist in the capture of Loheiya, Jarb and Zahirah by a coastal march, while Hashid and Bekil make a descent from two points on the inland flank of the Beni Abs country. Thus Idrisi hopes to isolate the Turkish forces in the latter region (he estimates them at about 3,000 men), and to starve them out. This would be the second phase. When these operations have been accomplished, he proposes to move on south, and join up with rebel elements of|!i i tlie Zaranik and Udein Arabs, and also of the Ismailiyah tribes. These three on their own account, wish to attack Zebid, Taiz an Menakhkh ^respectively. So Id,-isi hopes to clear the whole Tihamah of Turks and occupy m their room. Now, if we assume that Idrisi means business this time, his plan has one or two significant features. .. . n 'i Tt is to be entirely a Tihamah campaign. This is as it should be ii almuch as lramitous provocation of. the Zeid, Imam will be Voided (though Yahya will not like the Idris,’s entry into the Yemen Tihamah) and the Turks are to be the primary objective of attack. Moreover, it promises no collision with King Husein. But, on the Xr hand t is to serve directly Idr,s.’s territorial ambition to nossess himself of the lowlands down to Mokha. In sanctioning h,s Full plan, we are, presumably, prepared to see him enthroned some day at Zebid, vice Sabbia, and if we promote ,t son h ot Lobe,ya we are going to help to put him into Zebid and Hodeidah. In a word Idr,si is out against the Turks not for mrheaux mux but because what Ins soul desires above all things is in Turkish hands. (9) It is to tie a long campaign, whose second objective alone, the capture of the Turks in the Abs country, must take months Idrisi, who proposes to put about 20,000 men into the field, postulates a rate of pay which works out at nearly £30,000 a month for Ins Hashid and Bekil auxiliaries alone, in addition to subsidies to duets, to the liijal el-Ma etc. etc., (be is paying £25 to £30 a month, as it is, to certain chiefs’ and’ wishes to buy off Ibn el-Heij for a lump sum of some £2 000). We have given him a dole which certainly will not last him a month. Both he and Seyyid Mustapha are well aware of this fact, and they mingle with their gratitude and their cordiality unmistakable hints that they regard our present as only an instalment on account. They are, doubtless, looking to be subsidised on the same scale as King Husein. The facts being as they are, what shall our action be when, in much less than the six months term (see p. 442), the inevitable demand for a further and larger instalment of subsidy is put up by Idrisi ? By giving him what we have now given in the way of money, and will give in the way of supplies, we have acquitted ourselves of our original promise. Beyond this we are not morally bound to do more than provide him with a safe retreat, should his offensive fail. In all else we must consult first and foremost our own interests. How are these involved in the success of his full plan ? Some notable success we cannot refuse to help him secure if possible, except at obvious sacrifice of our prestige and influence, seeing how we are, and have long been, involved with him : and this success could hardly be less than the attainment of his tw 7 o primary objectives, the capture of Loheiya with the rest of the northern Yemen Tihamah, and the reduction of the 3,000 Turks in the Abs hills. Even this much, as has been indicated above, will certainly require us to make earlier and greater calls on our resources, than we contemplated. Granted, then that we have seen Idrisi through those first two phases of his offensive, how about the sequel ? There are less than 1,000 Turkish soldiers in all the rest of the Tihamah and unless Idrisi’s move on the south country should draw awayconsiderable enemy strength from the Highland garrisons or the Lahej Expeditionary torce, it will be of little military value to us. Further it will bring up certain questions. ( 1 ) Ho we want Idrisi at Hodeidah ? (2) Ho we want to see Zebid, that ancient seat of Moslem religious learning, sacked by the wild Zaranik ? (3) Ho we want, in the interest of future peace with the Imam, to bring the Beni Yam, who are Ismailiyah, and truculent semi savages, once more on to the Hodeidah-Sanaa road ? They held Menakhah for twelve years before 1872, but were then forced back into remote Nejran by the Turks, leaving behind them only the small clan of the Makarimah with two or'three other Ismaili tribelets in the hills. Once they had recovered that lost Emirate, would they accord with Idrisi any better than with the Imam ? As for the question of Taiz and the Udein Arabs, it would seem to be related to future operations of our own in the Hinterland so much more closely than to Idrisi’s plan of campaign, that it were best considered apart from the latter. The conclusion of the whole matter seems to be this. Should we on our side re-occupy Lahej, and Idrisi, on his side, take Loheiya, would not our interests be best served by our leaving Idrisi, the remnant of the Turks and the Imam to settle among themselves and by them selves the case of the rest of Yemen, while we held a watching brief, perhaps from a vantage point at Hodeidah ? The letters appended to Major Reilly’s report comprise one from ten chiefs of the Rijal el-Ma to Idrisi, protesting their accord, detailing desperate fighting all day and every day, and asking for rifles and ammunition, but not for a muqaddam (Idrisi must have been pressing one upon them). “ Our people,” they say “are a strange folk. If one of us finds a muqaddam or any one else set over him, he will turn away the hearts of all his fellows .... If a muqaddam, not of us, arrives here, he will experience trouble, worry and risk! ” In another letter, the same writer is still more candid about his people : “ Rijal el-Ma and Asirare greedy people. You must put a spy among them.” Of the remaining letters most are missives from the Imam (we take them on Idrisi’s responsibility alone) to various chiefs, preaching defence of the One Faith (“ This matter hangs between Kafirdom and Islam ! ”) and reproaching some for their defection and others for their misconception of himself. “ We have spent all our resources for Hashid and Bekil and others .... With thousands we buy corn for them in the markets and always at exorbitant rates, although we do not get such revenue from the country as was got by the Qasim dynasty .... We have a tract of aridity, where everyone looks but to his own interest, and to secure his needs out of the Imam, as if the Imam were collector of the revenue of Egypt ! ” That Yahya should speak thus of himself as not of the Qasim dynasty, to which the Imams before his father certainly belonged, confirms our information that he does not descend from a ruling house. H.Gr.H.— 478 — LIBYA. Situation in Cyrenaica and Tripohtania. Desoite his previous announcement that he would be returning Despite ms pie Sevyid Mohammed Idris was still almost immediately to Dedaiim, . f rom bolding a conference with the Italians on several matters, amongst them r -Sy established, post at M ’^ h As the Il ians ha™ not removed this post.it is apparent that bins P‘«“ s &amp; ' satisfactorily dealt with at the conference. Meanwhile All Pasha el-Abdia Who was sent by Idris to interview the High Commissioner, has returned to Akrama, and Idris has written a letter expressing his gratitude for the treatment accorded to his delegate . 1 It is 8 possible that Idris has been waiting at Akrama for the return of his delegate and that by now, he has definitely set out for the west again. There has been no further news of the I urkish agents m Cvrenaica but it may be assumed that their activities have not abated Undoubtedly the news of the Italian withdrawal on the Isonzo front will be fully exploited by Nun and his satellites, who are of course kept well primed by the Turkish wireless. On the other hand it may be taken equally for granted that the news of the disaster to the Turkish army in Palestine has been religiously suppressed. Of the Turkish prisoners captured at Gedabia some months ao’o and sent by Idris to Kufra, the redoubtable Musa Pasha el-Yemeni is reported to have died en route. News has reached us from a French source that camels are reaching Kufia fiom the Borku district and are being bought up at high prices. All recent information about this remote stronghold of the Senussi faith points to the sway of Idris being generally acknowledged there. It may, therefore, reasonably be supposed that this purchase of camels merely indicates a desire on the part of the owners of gardens to dispose of their date crops. At the same time the presence of a fairly numerous party of Turkish prisoners renders the situation worthy of attention. In past years the natives of Kufra have not been above raiding Dakhla Oasis at the conclusion of the date season. Some time ago a suggestion was submitted by the Italian Government that an informal and friendly meeting should take place between a British and an Italian officer for the purpose of discussing the question of native traffic across the western frontier at Solium. The suggestion has now been approved, and the proposed meeting will shortly take place. It is interesting to note that the Italian Government has temporarily suspended the issue of all passports into Libya and has requested us to postpone for the present the repatriation of a certain number of Tripolitan internees, which had previously been agreed upon.* - r — 479 — As regards Tripolitania, news from this region is very scarce, and that which does reach us from Italian sources, is generally so out of date as to be practically useless. . The necessity for a British intelligence agent both in Tripoli and Cyrenaica is very apparent and urgent at the present moment, and representations to this affect have been made to the proper quarter. From various reports of a not altogether reliable nature it seems that a good deal of fighting has been going on in the vicinity of Tripoli and Homs, during both October and early November, but with what result is unknown. As has been remarked above, the set-back to the Italians elsewhere has undoubtedly been published broadcast throughout Tripolitania and will be effectively exploited by Nuri in his appeals to the tribes of the hinterland for recruits. Submarines still continue to arrive frequently at Misurata with money and material, and the W.T. station there, said to be staffed by German personnel, is in direct communication with Constantinople. A telephone line is now said to run from Misurata to Sert where Ramadan Shitewi has his most eastern outpost manned by three to four hundred armed Bedouins. Seyyid Ahmed is also somewhere in this Sert district and is reported by Idris to have definitely joined the Turkish party. In any case his influence is now a negligible quantity, for almost a year has elapsed since his ignominious defeat at Siwa, and he is still a homeless wanderer. To sum up, the situation in the west can in no wise be considered satisfactory whilst we are still without reliable means of observing at first hand the activities of the Turkish party in that country. In this direction, a concession has recently been obtained from the Italian Government which has authorized inter-communication between the Governor of Libya and the Italian Military Attache in Egypt. It is to be expected that this arrangement will considerably expedite our receipt of Italian intelligence from Tripoli and will enable us to keep a more efficient check upon the movements of Ramadan and Nuri. With Idris adequately supported and equipped by the Italians there is little to fear from any demonstration eastward by that combine. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the Italian Government has now sanctioned the supply of 1,000 rifles, four mountain guns with 150 shells, four machine ' guns, 220,000 rounds of ammunition, seventy-five swords and 200 pistols to Idris. The High Commissioner has been requested by the Italian Government to sanction the supply from Egypt of certain material asked for by Idris which is not available either in Cyrenaica or Italy, including four motor lorries and two motor Cars, 1,000 uniforms and a certain number of transport animals. In any case the assistance sanctioned by the Italian Government greatly improves Idris’ position vis a vis the Turkish element in his territory and provides to some extent a strong counter to the persuasive propaganda of this party.NOTES. The Abu Ras Affair. From more than one source Aden has learned that the X)hu Mohammed and Dim Husein are far from considering the Abu Has affair settled (see pp. 304, 319, 355, 366, 384, etc.). In fact, the Imam Yahya is reported to have refused to pay over the promised blood-money. lo put off the threatened recrudescence of tribal rebellion, the lurks are stated to have sent two of their inculpated officers to Sanaa for trial, viz., Husni Bey, of Ali Said Pasha’s staff and Elias Bey, Kaimmakam of Ibb ; but it will surprise no one if the tribes regard this measure as a mere blind. Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, also inculpated, refused, it is said, to accompany the others, probably because he had a shrewd suspicion he would ultimately be made by the Court sole scapegoat. He hates Turks and Imam about equally. An unconfirmed report, states, however, that he was arrested subsequently by 150 of the Imam’s men and haled off ; but this is very doubtful. Meanwhile the great Bekil tribes are vowing vengeance. Boundary of the Aden Protectorate. Our attention has been called to a serious mistake about the Aden Protectorate on page 179 of the “ Handbook of Arabia 1 ol. /., where an eastern boundary has been indicated which is neither recognized nor contemplated. The information on this matter at the disposal of the compilers of the Handbook was not quite up-to-date. Colonel Neiccombe. Readers of the Arab Bulletin will be glad to know that Lieut.-Col. S. F. Newcombe, D.S.O., taken prisoner by the Turks at the beginning of our Palestine advance early this month, has suffered, according to such information as can be obtained, no hurt and was well treated, prior to removal to Damascus. He is the first officer on the Staff for Arab Operations who has fallen into Turkish hands. He had some narrow escapes in Hejaz, where he displayed the same obstinate audacity. Jeizan. 1 he officers^ who undertook the mission to Idrisi in October, include in their report (for which see p. 474) a description of Jeizan and its neighbourhood. The place itself is only a village, built mainly of brushwood but possessing four stone houses. 1 he population is about 3,500. It has three torts, only one of which, some 300 yards south of the village is m good repair. Our officers thought it well placed, as’ it r&gt;481 commands all approach whether by sea or land. Jeizan has no nearer water-supply than holes dug in the bed of Wadi Jeizan about three miles north-east. It stands on a small promontary protected by a parallel reef some 150 yards out at sea. Inland o£ the village lies a belt of mud flats some three miles across and six miles in length. Beyond this stretches level cultivated country up to distant hills. Our officers visited a village, es-Sowana, about four miles east of Jeizan, and found it had good water from twenty-foot wells. The situation of Sabbia, twenty-three miles north-east and at the foot of two sugar-loaf hills, could be made out. Aden News. The Aden Field Force sent out a. strong reconnaissance to the Turkish lines at Jabir on November 22, reaching these at dawn. In spite of vigorous resistance the enemy, who had eight guns, was driven out and his defences were destroyed. His total casualties were about fifty, including many dead left on the ground. Our casualties were one British officer killed and twenty-eight Indians, killed and wounded. Our reconnoitring force then returned to its own lines. Jauf and the Wadian. In correction of certain statements made in our No. 33 (1916) pp. 502-3, Mr. Douglas Carrnthers, Hon. Secretary, U.Gr.S., who has been working upon the late Captain Shakespear’s MSS. for the past two years, and plotting the general cartographic data for northern Arabia, sends the following note:— “ Shakespear’s route from Haiyyaniya to Jauf was across belts of sand for the first sixty-five miles ; for the next 120 miles it was in and out of Nefud or ‘ along depressions and low hills at foot of Nefud,’ until he reached the open, level plain which lies immediately to the south of the Jauf depression. Musil’s volcanic tract about the headwaters of the wadis forming the Wadian, is away to the north of Jauf, half-way between Jauf and Jebel Anaza. This Harrah evidently does not extend much further east, otherwise Leach man would be sure to have noted it. Aylmer and Butler probably crossed the edge of it between the Wadis Gharuba and Ugrah—western affluents of the Arar—for they noted the ‘ ground covered with black rocks, which renders travelling somewhat difficult.’ This point is about sixty miles due east of the point where Musil records it. Between Hazil and the Wadi Khar is ‘rough stony ground,’ and there is a steep 150 feet drop into the Wadi bed.”SECRET. Arab bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, December 5, 1917. No. 72. SUMMARY.

K. Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab bureau.— 483 — THE PROBLEM OF MEDINA. Our advance in Palestine has put the Turks in a quandary about their Hejaz forces which, all told, have a ration strength of about 23,000. These are in danger of being cut off and lost to an army which wants without delay every trained man it can get. The peculiar politico-religious value of Medina to the Ottoman Empire caused all the earlier counsels of prudence to be rejected by the Higher Command, and these troops, drawn originally from among the best in Turkey, have been left till the last minute. If they are to be saved, it is now (he., within the next few weeks) or never. As things are, the enemy strength on the long L. of C. is barely adequate to hold it. If it be depleted at all, the L. of C. must be abandoned. Since, however, the Medina garrison, according to latest reports, is in such a weakened state that its fit men are not more than enough to hold the town and outposts, it cannot reinforce its own L. of C. or replace any considerable drafts taken from the latter’s guards. In another case, were military considerations the same, authorities so well informed and advised as the Turkish would unquestionably order the whole of these forces to prepare for evacuation, and at the earliest possible moment to endeavour to get back to a distant base, from which they could be redistributed to a properly supported front. But this case is unique, and certain conditions governing policy in regard to it are peculiar. Notoriously, the powers that be in Turkey are convinced that general peace is not far distant. They believe it will be concluded, at the best, on status quo ante bellum terms ; at the worst, uti possidetis! On this conviction they are disposed to gamble. Therefore, seeing the immense importance of still holding the Medina card in their hand at the Peace Conference, they will not regard military reasons alone or primarily in regard to the Hejaz. While, however, they want still to hold on to the place for some months at the least, at the same time they urgently need Hejaz troops elsewhere within the next few weeks. Since the effective strength of the actual Medina garrison leaves even now little margin of safety, and that of the L. of C. troops no margin at all, the only possible way of realizing both their desires is to withdraw fro m Medina only the ineffectives, and from the L. of C., if any strength at all is taken, the whole strength. This means that before very long, if the Turks manage to keep the Hejaz railway open, the city of Medina may be left to a garrison of 3,000 to 4,000 men, cut off from all the lest of the Ottoman forces by an interval of at least 400 miles, and without possibility of communication by other means than wireless telegraphy or native blockade runners. It will be a forlorn hope, a match against time, for a garrison so circumstanced is bound to waste apace. But it is not quite so desperate a venture as at the first blush it might appear. The Turks, in this case, count three special points in their favour. First, the proved capacity484 — of their Anatolian troops, under stout hearted commandeis such as Fakhri is, to stand long sieges with communications cut and supplies short, and without such loss of discipline or heart, as other armies would suffer. Second, the proved inaptitude of pure y Arab forces for making any impression by greatly superior numbers on strongly fortified positions. Third, and most important, at Medina, as at Jerusalem, the sacrosanctity of the position they propose to hold. Even if this should not deter its assailants from using effective weapons, especially guns, valuable capital could, an would, be made out of their aggressive action throughout the Moslem world, and King Husein might well find victory worse than de feat. The force of this third point will be appreciated when it is recalled that the Turks’ main position at Medina, according to the best Arab information, is a small fortified area round the Haram itself. Into this they have brought their rail-head by a pro longation of the line through the city walls, and in the Mosque precinct they have their main ammunition dump and supply store. It will be impossible to bombard them there without damaging, and perhaps blowing up, parts of the Mosque and even the Prophet’s Tomb itself. If the Sherifial commanders feel themselves debarred, as very likely they will, from using guns against this position, they can only invest it and trust to the slow certainty of waste, and the chances of epidemic and treachery—both good chances, but no more. They will hardly hasten the end, even if they should succeed in reducing the outposts and cutting the spring-water conduits from Ain Zerka and Kuba. There is ground water at no great depth all over the Medina oasis and Fakhri has an efficient well-sinking detachment. But he might be reduced to contaminated water, and so the chance of epidemic would be increased. The Turks hold but an indifferent hand in Hejaz, but they will play such cards as they still have for all they are worth. Should they succeed in finding a thoroughly fit garrison to leave in Medina—fit to stand a year’s waste—and in evacuating all the unfit and the remnant of the civil population, and withdrawing these, together with all L. of C. troops, to Maan or Amman, they will have scored. If disaster, partial or complete, overtakes the evacuating force, we shall lead on points, but not yet have won the game. Fakhri will still hold a troublesome hand. It will be necessary, at our great expense, and to the political and military embarrassment of King Husein, to keep the Arab southern armies in being for many months to come ; and a centre of hostile propaganda and rallying point for reactionary sentiment will remain in full activity in Hejaz. How far the' Turkish G.O.C. and any helper like I bn Rashid (should he elect to be shut up with his present friends) may be able to spread poison among the surrounding tribes, will depend on the closeness of the investment. Abdullah has shown that he can close a small circumscribed area effectively for three months, and if the outlying posts, which the\ — 485 — Turks may begin by trying to hold outside the walls of Medina, to safeguard conduits or for other reasons, can be driven in, there is no reason why the investment should not be very nearly as complete as that of Taif. But even so, it is hardly likely that all ingress of tribesmen and supplies and egress of propagandists can be prevented by Arab besiegers, as month follows month. Difficulties in the way of any evacuation whatever are of course obvious ; but it is idle to discuss these here and now, since it is on action yet to come both by the Arabs themselves and by our Palestine forces, that their full import will depend. Sufficient to note at present that, in any case, should the Turks hold on to Medina itself, we may expect the Hejaz problem to remain, for a good long time to come, almost as embarrassing as ever. D.G.H. HUBER’S GEOGRAPHICAL WORK IN ARABIA (1879-1884.) Mr. D. Carruthers has forwarded to Cairo the following :— O “ It is thirty-three years since Charles Huber w r as murdered by his guides near Rabugh, on his way back into Nejd from Jedda, and although his journal and field-notes were subsequently recovered, worked out and published, there has appeared as yet no criticism of them. This is partly due to the fact that, in spite of our great increased knowledge of Northern Arabian topography, since Huber’s day, no traveller has been over Huber’s own special area, and therefore his work has not been called into question ; but a deeper reason is that, until quite recently, a real interest in the details of Arabian geography had not been sufficiently aroused. The plotting of Huber’s route-surveys was accepted as it stood ; but we now find it necessary to go back in all cases to the original field-notes. A close study of Huber’s work is essential to all who would follow the course of Arabian exploration. It is also most important to remember that the results of his Second Journey, as published by the Asiatic and Geographical Societies of Paris, are not sufficiently accurate in the light of present-day knowledge. There are many obvious errors in the text, and the maps can be greatly improved by careful re-plotting. Not one word of Huber’s Journal d\m Voyage en Arabic can be spared. His work will stand as the basis of all map- making in the regions he traversed for many a long day ; and Huber is likely to be our only authority on certain regions for many years to come. Considering that this energetic traveller covered, in his two journeys, some 7,000 miles of route (ever}^ day’s march of which is recorded) and that travellers in Arabia,n — 486 — even if passing between the same two points, rarely follow exactly the same route, we recognise that it will be long before Muber s work is checked and replaced by more reliable surveys. W ithout Huber’s work our maps of Northern Arabia would be very poor things in fact, it would be difficult to make a map at all, foi it is only on the foundation given us by his reliable surveys, checked by his astronomical positions, that it is possible to make use of other travellers’ maps and notes. On his First Journey Huber was actually travelling about eleven and a half months, covered some 4,000 miles, and fixed the latitude of nine positions, including Teima, el-Ala, Kheibar, Mustajidda and Nejef. The results were admirable, but are in no way to be compared with those of his (Second Journey. The latter form a Journal, which is a marvel of observation and careful survey-work. On this journey, 1883-1884, he was ten and a half months in Arabia, and about five months actually on the march, covering some 3,000 miles. His field-notes were kept up without a break over 163 days of travel, and the amount of wmrk crowded into one march, is shown by the fact that his daily journal often extends to four large octavo pages of print, and in cases where there were inscriptions to copy, sometimes to as many as eighteen pages. There are sixty-eight astronomical observations recorded, none of which have been superseded : in fact w 7 e are still dependent upon Huber’s position for such important centres as Hail, Teima, Teb.uk, Akhdar, Medain Salih, Aneiza, and Jauf, as w^ell as for numerous points in between. Too much cannot be said for the conscientious manner in which Huber carried out his work, ft is very rarely that he breaks down in his continuous record of compass-bearings and times. The latter v r ere estimated with great care, and he repeatedly checked his reckoning by walking for a given period and counting his paces. The re-plotting of his route-survey is a lengthy and somewhat laborious undertaking. It is necessary to be constantly on the look out for errors in the text; for instance, West appears \ery often when it is quite certain it must have been East in his original. _ There are many misprints in the daily records of hours his times going bdckwavds whilst he travels forwards ! There are also some rni sprints in com pass-bearings ; and further, all the compass-bearings have to be reversed, Huber’s 360° being due south, Jiis 45° at our 135° and so on. Huber and his companion Euting do not always agree. Also M. J. Hansen, who compiled the maps at the end of the ‘Journal’, in some ( rises wiongly interprets Huber’s original ; and in cases where Huber has two traverses over more or less the same ground (as between I eima and febuk) Hansen made no attempt to adjust the two so as to form one map. To make the latter is the most difficult part of reconstructing his work, but none the less it is essential,— 487 — • A most .valuable part of Huber’s contribution to knowledge is the material he collected from native information This is hidden away m all sorts of unlikely places througW his Jouriial As an example we find the following; entries immediately succeeding each other. Dec, 1st : ‘ Ton jours la fievre, etc. Dec. 4th ‘ I am a little better to-day.’ Dec, 6th * fwo men of Jauf whom I questioned concerning the Wadi birhan gave me the following details,’ and there follows a list of sixteen^ wadi affluents of the Sirhan depression, with all proper names in original Arabic, with description of source, length and ultimate destination of each, and also a sketch map of routes between Jauf and the Hauran. (Ten days later this was supplemented by another three or four pages of notes collected fiom another source.) Dec. 7th, He gives a complete inventory of a native house in Hail (names in Arabic) with a description of each article, supplemented by sketches, altogether occupyino- twelve pages of text. Dec. 8th. An observation for latitude. And so on each day, whether travelling or at rest, he gives us, besides his ordinary entries for time and direction, some stray note on hydrography, the copy of an inscription, a piece of local history, or a panoramic sketch of his surroundings. It remains to be proved to what extent Huber’s information is reliable, for instance, he notes some forty names of waterings in the Nefud borders. Of these I can at present only identify six on other authority. But as our knowledge increases I have no doubt many, if not all, of these localities will be found to exist. The first piece of Huber’s work to be re-plotted was the route between Jebel Druz and Hail : this is appearing on the Jauf sheet of the one million series. As a notable instance of the results obtained by re-plotting, Jubba is moved twenty miles to the east of its former position, thus straightening out the route between Jauf and Hail, and modifying that rather unlikely right- angle in the route between the Aleim, Jubba and Kena. The portion now in progress covers the area between Tebuk, Feima and Medain Salih, extending eastwards to Jebel Shammar. Accepting Huber’s latitudes, direction, and a mean between his times, the position of Medain Salih and Muadhdham are moved still further to the east than they are on the revised ‘ Wejh ’ sheet, the distance between the railway and Teima being again shortened considerably.”■MHUBH i i 1 si i a — 488 — ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Railway Raids. ^ _ («) Southern Section.-Sheni Abdullah s f e ] ,ort t0 father on his Stahl Antar operations of November 11, \2, dealt with by us in previous issues, has come in, but scarcely .increases our information. He lost one of his best lieutenants in . eri Suleiman ibn Abdullah el-Jizam, and also five other ranks The report, however, by stating that Sherif Ah s attack on Bowat station was undertaken in co-operation, corrects our impression that it took place some days earlier and was followed by a second less successful attack. There was only one attempt on Bowat, which took place on November 11. Ah’s artillery bombarded the place and (as Abdullah reports) exploded an ammunition store and set a “fort” on fire : but it does not appear that the Arabs took, much less, held the station, though they captured the fort in question and seem to have wiped out its garrison. Ihese Arab despatch writers use a style which our most picturesque reporters mio-ht envy. “ The fighting was worth seeing,” writes Abdullah, “the armed locomotives were escaping with the coaches of the train like a serpent beaten on the head. So too the official epistolary style. “ And now, 0 excellent Agent! ” writes King H use in to Major Jfassett, “would you allow me to ask vhethei the despatch of tw r o or four aeroplanes would make any appre ciable difference to Great Britain’s total of aeroplanes, which are like the locusts in number ? ”. [Since the above was printed we have received from Colonel Bremond the report of Lieut. Kernag, who led the French artillery contingent in the attack on Bowat on November 11 . The report, which is of interest through the light which it throws on Arab methods of fighting, confirms our statement that the station at Bowat was not captured in this engagement. The Arab force, consisting of six mountain guns, under Lieut. Kernag, two companies of mitrailleuses, a company of infantry, and a company of engineers, in addition to some 250 Mujahidin and 1,500 Harb, including 500 Beni Mohammed, (the whole under the command of Sherif All), marched at noon on the 9th from Jaffar, reaching its final point of concentration in the neighbourhood of Bowat the following morning, the remainder of the day being spent in reconnaissance. On the 11 th the attack was opened shortly after dawn, by a bombardment of the Turkish position by Lieut. Kernag’s mountain battery, the general plan being, after the demolition of the enemy’s works by the artillery, that the infantry and Bedouins should rush the position, with the primary objective of seizing and destroying the station buildings and permanent way, and with the secondary objective of gaining time, i ! Iby delaying the arrival of reinforcements from Medina, for the operation undertaken simultaneously by Sherif Abdullah at Bir Nasif. By 8 a.m. the Turks had evacuated their advanced positions with the exception of one post which continued to hold out, and upon which the fire of the whole battery was now concentrated. By 9 a.m, as it appeared that the latter work was sufficiently demolished, the Bedouins attempted to rush it, but were driven back by the rifle fire of the Turks. At 9.30 two sections of guns were switched on to the main enemy position covering the station, the remaining section continuing to engage the advanced work, which still maintained its resistance and from which the sections engaging the station were subjected to a somewhat heavy rifle fire. By 10 a.m. the station buildings were in flames, but at this juncture Turkish reinforcements, consisting of a company of engineers with a gun, arrived by train from the north, shortly followed by a battalion of infantry with two guns and two machine guns railed up from the south. Neither train was able however, to reach Bowat owing to extensive demolitions to the line both N. and S. of the scene of action providently carried out during the preceding night. The Turks accordingly began to repair the line under cover of their guns, but by noon, not awaiting the completion of this task, their infantry and machine guns moved up to support the threatened posts at Bowat, whereupon the Arabs, already considerably shaken by the moral effect of the Turkish gun-fire (though the actual loss sustained therefrom was negligible), commenced their retirement this movement being completed by 3. p.m. During the whole action the Arab casualties amounted only to one officer and five Bedouins wounded. In some interesting observations upon the general conduct of this engagement, Lieut. Kernag lays stress upon the utter lack of co-ordination in command, and of discipline among the Arab officers. The offensive spirit is also wholly wanting to the Arabs generally—the infantry refusing resolutely to advance beyond the screen of their artillery, with the result that throughout the greater part of the action the guns were actually engaged in front of the infantry which it was their role to support. Similarly in the final retirement the artillery were the last unit to withdraw !] On November 27, the line was broken and there was fighting between Seil Matara and Zumurrud. This raid, if not done by the Ferhan-Abdullah combination, which has been acting latterly near Hadiyah, was probably the work of Sherif Sharraf and his reconnoitring party (see p. 474), or of both forces acting in concert. Aziz Effendi has gone up to the railway for demolition work, taking some Turkish deserters with him as decoys to attract more.(b) Northern Section.— A later report, which puts the train- demolition effected by Major Lawrence’s party on November 11, instead of November i (see p. 4/o), makes it ceitain that ^this is the same event as that recorded on page 448, at Khirbet es-Sumra. There has, therefore, been only one two-engined train affected, and the locality of Major Lawrence’s feat was south, not west, of Deraa. He lost eight men killed. On the other hand it is far from certain whether Sherif Husein Shakrani (see p. 473) got one train or two. It looks rather as if he got one about November 17, taking seventeen prisoners, and another later, taking prisoner’s, etc., as stated on page 473. General. Nuri Shaalan has sent his brother, Mohammed, and also his nephews, Khalid ibn Sattam and Ferhan ibn Fahd, on a mission to King Husein. The Kiblah states that they arrived in the middle of November and were met outside the city of Mecca by the notables and high government officials. They conveyed assurances of Nuri’s loyalty and co-operation. Jemal No. I, has sent not only Sheikh Shehab (see p. 473) to el-Ala but also Suleiman Rifada, the Billi chief, who has been for some months in Damascus. Ibn Rashid, who has incurred a blood feud with the Aida Anazeh, is keeping close at Medain Salih. The Anazeh, who left Wejh on November 21 (see p. 474), vow they will take revenge upon him. It is thought he will make for central Arabia soon. (Late News .—Up to December 3 no further suspected case of cholera or para-cholera at Akaba since November 19, but one of true Asiatic cholera from there landed at Suez in the interval. According to Arab report, sent late last month, by Sherif Ali to King Husein, lakhri has had the railway buildings outside the walls blown up ; this if true, looks like concentration in the town preparatory to some measure of evacuation. Scurvy is serious at Medain Salih. Major Lawrence returned to Akaba at the beginning of December.]MESOPOTAMIA. Attitude of the Notables in the Basrah Sanjaq. On the occasion of the transfer of the Civil Commissioner’s Head Quarter Office to Bagdad, Captain A. T. Wilson, who has acted hitherto as H.C.P.O. at Basrah, was entertained at several gatherings in Basrah and in A bul Khasib, the adjacent district on the right bank of the Shatt el-Arab. On these occasions speeches were made by the local notables and conversations of considerable interest took place. The inhabitants of the Basrah Sanjaq seem to have accepted the British occupation as an accom plished fact, and are now occupied with lively anticipations of the advantages which may result. No underlying political hostility w r as perceptible ; the rapid development of Basrah in the matter of roads, bridges, lighting, water, telephones, ice-machines, etc., has turned the mind of all classes in a practical direction and all are anxious to share in the improvements introduced. Those notables of Basrah whose houses are near the electric and water mains begged that these might be fitted with electric light and fans and given a water connection. A universal desire was expressed for further educational facilities. It was pointed out that better schools were needed so that it should not be necessary to send boys to India where they did not get on well and were not welcome. The reorganisation of the Civil Hospital was a subject of general satisfaction. At a reception held in the hospital it was inspected by all present and genuine appreciation was shown of the great improvements effected and the simple but comfortable conditions under which the patients lived. Speeches were made expressing the gratitude of the community for the labours of the Civil Surgeon, Captain Borrie, and for the action of the Government in enabling him to equip the hospital so adequately. A request was made that the good work might be completed by the appointment of a lady doctor or nurse to visit women in their houses and give them instruction in medical and sanitary matters. Action is being taken in this direction and enquiries are on foot whether a suitable candidate can be found. A meeting of merchants, largely composed of Jews, was marked by a cordiality which was possibly somewhat exaggerated. References were made to the great opportunities which lay before the mercantile community of Basrah after the war. It may be noted that the Mohammedans are perhaps a little anxious lest the enterprise of Jews and Christians should give them an advantage to which they are not entitled by social status or tradition. It is not unnatural that, with a population already concerned with the prospect of peaceful prosperity, the demands made on their resources by military requirements should seem increasingly irksome. Chief among these is the drain on labour. At Abul Khasib, the richest date growing area on the Shatt el-Arab, this point was emphasized. The landowners experience great^ diffi culty in getting labour for their date gardens, the military— 492 — demands being so heavy that the supply of agricultuial labour is now insufficient. The date groves are deteriorating and the landowners have to choose between the alternatives of letting this go on, or paying a price for labour which leaves them no margin of profit on the sale of their dates. The prices fixed for dates, though generous, are still below what had been expected. An earnest hope was expressed that our demands on labour would cease with the war. Although it was recognized that much labour would be needed for military demobilization and for develop ment, the landowners urged that it should be sought in Persia, India or elsewhere, so as to set free the agricultural classes of the Basrah Sanjaq who cannot be replaced from other sources. Moreover the skill to tend date gardens is not quickly acquired. The labour question was touched on in Basrah also, but in the town itself the inconveniences attendant on billeting are more immediately pressing. A plea was put forward that the notables should be accorded more favourable treatment with regard to exemption from the operation of billeting regulations, whereby nearly all the good houses in the city have been taken over by the military authorities. In spite of these drawbacks, a general confidence in British administration was apparent, and all classes seem to be actuated by a desire for progress. The leading notable of Abul Khasib ended his speech by saying : “ We now have justice and security; provided these are maintained everything will follow.” NOTES. Reconciliation of the Harb. ^ We have now received from King Husein, through Major Bassett, copies of letters, signed by 'a large number of Harb chiefs, in reference to the action taken by the King and his son, Ali, in the matter of the Hawazim robbery of a French party &lt;md of Ali s supplies {see pp. 428, 466). Sherif Ali reported on November 6 that he had recovered all the French rifles and sent t em to Yambo, and was expecting the captured ammunition also to be returned immediately. The Sheikhs chiefly inculpated were el-Khattabi el-Haznm and el-Zaheri (Dhaheri). All the letters disown these sheikhs, and assure the King of loyalty and perseverance m the war against his enemies. ' The principal Signatories are as follows. For the Beni StOim 1 W a whole, Sheikhs Asa£ ibn Saad el-Jazz and Fadl ibn Ahmed Fahd ( they are weakminded who do not look to the flvin r W A SP °F 'T 11 t n h , eir chieFs t0 settle matter in your ta\oui ). for the J/ayamsa (=the Jahm ?) seven names leaded by bheikh Ghaneim.

Sheikh Aidh A wad Wasil of unknown clan (“all worthy of being Arabs should part from el-Khattabi”).

For a clan or clans unidentified, Glathit ibn Alyan and seventeen more (“ we never break our promise”). For the Ahamda?, Sheikh Saad ibn Murshid ibn Mutlaq el-Ahmadi. For the Bahalah, Sheikh Ali ibn Murshid and fourteen others (“ the people of Rahalah which has never practised treachery”). Finally, for the guilty Haicazim themselves, Ahmed ibn Nabih el-Heneiti and thirty-nine more (The Forty Thieves!), who s«y “the true people of Hawazim await your orders and beg your forgiveness.” Other Harb clans not specified may be represented among the signatories of the above letters. Sheikh Hindi ibn Mehmil el-Khannia, who writes a separate letter of sympathy, may be Sheikh Hindi of the Ateibah Berqah, some of whom are known to be with Sherifs Ali and Abdullah. Germans from Abyssinia. It is stated that the two Hermans, who came down from Abyssinia and, after various adventures, were caught by the French and taken to Jibuti {see pp. 317, 374, 384), have been tried and condemned as spies. They will be shot there, unless they appeal to the Court of Cassation in France. Their names are Holtz and Carmelitch.» SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN. No. 73. ISECRET.

Fathers Janssen and Savignac, who, prior to 1914, had been familiar with regions lying immediately east of the Jordan, have supplied a series of notes from which we take the following extract* relating to the country as far north as es-Salt. This country is likely to become shortly the scene of Arab operations. “ ( 1 ) El-Kerak. —This is the name of the region included between the Wadi el-Hesa and the Wadi Mojib. This name comes from the town of Kerak which always was the capital of this country and is situated more or less at the centre and on the border of the plateau at the foot of the mountains. At the time of the Crusades Kerak was the principal Frank fortress of the ‘ Land Beyond the Jordan It was built on the top of a hill extending towards the south, and surrounded on all sides by deep valleys excepting at the southern point where a small mountain pass linked it with a neighbouring height. This mountain pass has been cut by a wide ditch and the Franks had placed at this extremity of the hill the Citadel which a second ditch on the north isolated from the rest of the town. The whole of the Citadel is still standing in spite of the ruins accumulated inside ; the Turkish troops are quartered there in big vaulted halls dating from the Middle Ages. The walls of the town still exist for the greater part of the two kilometres which they measured originally. The present town of Kerak is entirely included in this mediaeval enclosure of which it occupies hardly two-thirds. It includes a certain number of buildings, Governorate, military hospital, a big college, missions, house of the Sheikhs oi the Mujali, etc ) and a number much more considerable of miserable houses and huts in which lives a population the great majority of which is semi-nomadic At the time of our last visit, in March 1912, the town had not yet recovered from the ruins accumulated by the Turkish soldiers who fifteen months earlier had sacked and burned the Mussulman quarter. At that time there were hardly 1,000 inhabitants, not including the garrison (about 500 men). Many it is true had already taken to the Desert. One would not be far from the truth in estimating at 2,000 souls the population of Kerak when all are told. The inhabitants belong to different tribes, many members of which dwell continually under the tent. I here is a flourishing Christian community among them. Kerak possesses a Latin Mission with two schools, one of which is for girls kept by Sisters, a Greek Orthodox Mission and a small English Protestant Mission. Owing to the presence of the government officials and of an important garrison there are many shops and stores * [Not having the original French of the Notes before us, we have had to reproduce a translation, which we have not been able to check.]— 496 — where Bedouins of the region come for their requirements. The merchants in general come originally from Damascus, or Hebron. Among them a certain number of speculators lend money to the Arabs on their yearly crops and thus obtain control of important stocks of cereals on very cheap terms. In 1912 all the barley of the country had been cornered by merchants from Hebron. There is no water in the town and the people have been compelled to dig cisterns and huge reservoirs. But on the other hand, at the foot of the hill in the valley on the west especially, springs are very plentiful. One of the most important of these and the one nearest to the Citadel is called Ain el-Franji (the spring of the Franks) and it gives its name to the first part of the big Wadi Kerak which descends to the Dead Sea. All along this ravine winds a small path, which there had been a question of converting into a carriage road leading to the sea at Ghor Mezraa. Goods and people would make use of this highway, taking afterwards a steamer up to the north of the Dead Sea, whence one can easily reach Jerusalem by carriage. This highway is expected to become the most direct and rapid route between Kerak and Jerusalem. For some time a motor boat and a large sailing boat have plied between Ghor Mezraa and the plain of Jericho ; this is a private enterprise. At present there are four or five vessels worked by steam or petrol, belonging to the Government _ and used for the transport of grain. The plateau of Moab is in reality very rich in wheat and barley, and this plateau, with Belka, supplies the greater part of the requirements of Jerusalem and its surroundings. Besides the town of Kerak there is no other inhabited centre of any importance in this region but simply a few villages more or less insignificant with 250 or 300 inhabitants apiece. Let us mention, to the south-south-west of Kerak, Kathrabeh, Irak and Khanzireh. Moteh, on the road to Tafileh, is rather a collection ot stores than a village. Abandoned during a part of the year the locality is full of animation when winnowing-time for the gram comes in. Numerous installations are put up for that purpose all round, and it is there chiefly that, before the construction of the radway line to Medina, the Arab tribes from the north of the Heyaz came for their supplies. During the months of August and September big caravans flocked in and Moteh took the appearance of a vast grain market. Moteh is dt BvL ? f° 1T ^ t i he i Pla ^ ° £ the fir8t hunter between first defeated 16 ^ 1 ro P het ’ s bands, which were at Moteh 6 About three-quarters of an hour to the south of Moteh one finds Jafar a sanctuary devoted to the Moslem heroes of the battle of Moteh One akn Q ^ i ! to the sanctuary. “ I *° See&amp; a £ew houses close A colony o£ Turcomans had settled down at Leiun on the road from Kerak to Katraneh ; but this place being 3 unhealthy— 497 — was abandoned. About four hours to the north-east of Kerak a considerable group of Christians of that town settled down among the rains of Khirbet Samakyeh in order to devote themselves to the cultivation of the surrounding lands which they sowed for their own account and that of some sheikhs. Before the war the Latin community of Lerak was preparing to settle down definitely and almost to a man at Samakyeh which had become a small town of about 500 inhabitants. Half an hour from there the Orthodox Greeks established a similar village—Hemud. The other ruins on the plateau are abandoned. At Rabba, the ancient Areopolis, there are only two or three houses of recent construction. Kasr Rabba, one hour further north, contains the ruins of a temple with one house and a cistern by the side of it. Deraa and Mezraa, in the Ghor Mezraa near the shores of the Dead Sea, contain only a few old houses abandoned during a great part of the year. The inhabitants of the region of el-Kerak are therefore mostly Bedouins. One word on the springs in this country. To the west and south-west of Kerak water abounds. One finds springs nearly everywhere in the deep valleys, at the bottom of which they often give birth to small streams. In the district of Katrabeh, Irak and Khanzireh especially, the country is well watered. On the plateau on the contrary water is rare. The most important water is the big spring of Lejun four hours away from Kerak and three hours away from Katraneh. Water flows also in the lower part of the Seil Saideh, one of the tributaries of the Arnon. Two hours and a half to the north of Samakyeh, to the east of Kasr Rabba, one finds the spring of el-Balua. One also finds in the region large cisterns well known to the Arabs, which are owned by different sheikhs of different tribes. A celebrated spot in all the country, which deserves special mention, is Jebel Shihan to the south of Mojib. On this peak is a well-known Moslem sanctuary from which one obtains a commanding view in all directions. (2) El-Belka .—The Belka which succeeds to Kerak on the north contains three principal centres which have each their special features. These are Madaba, Amman and es-Salt. The region of Madaba, often contested in antiquity by the Ammonites and the Moabites, answers exactly by its nature to the country of Moab. One has everywhere the same prospect— the same mountains well watered to the west; the same feiti e plateau in the centre; the same desert to the west; very often the same tribes live on both banks of the Mojib, which divides the country in two. The two sides of this huge ravine are very steep, often precipitous and nearly everywhere impassable. Traian’s Roman road, followed by the present road from Kerak to Madaba and es-Salt, traverses the wadi to the south of the rums of Diban, the ancient Biblical Dibon. From 800 metres abovewmum i ' f — 498 — sea-level one comes down to less than 100 and then again to 800 metres. A second path runs a little to the east of the preceding one and then blends with the Roman Road on the southern slopes of the Madaba height. without doubt the one built by Mesa, King of Moab, and is mentioned on the Cenotaph of 13iban as one of the big achieve ments of the monarch. ‘ It is I who built the road of the Arnon.’ Reasts of burden may follow any of these paths but with trouble, especially the second. Madaba was forty years ago an abandoned ruin in which three small Christian tribes, having emigrated from Kerak, settled down. Under the leadership of intelligent and energetic mission aries, the settlement prospered in spite of difficulties of all sorts created by the surrounding tribes. Madaba has to-day a population of 2,500 nearly all Christians. This population is honest in every sense of the word and sympathetic. The town is built on the top and at the foot of a small hill in a fertile and well cultivated region of which it is the centre and its further development appears most probable. There are at Madaba a Greek Orthodox Mission and a Latin Mission served by Sisters of the Rosary. Madaba is the seat of a Mudir who has under his orders a dozen horsemen and soldiers. The surrounding country is full of ancient ruins, a certain number of which are those of cities which were prosperous. For a number of years agriculture has developed steadily. The Bedouins who think it dishonourable to till the soil have called up the fellahin from the mountains of Hebron or Jerusalem, and from Nablus, and the latter come to plough and till the soil and afterwards keep for themselves a share of the crops. A certain number of these fellahin, having no interest in Western Palestine, have finally settled down near their work and built themselves homes in the midst of the ruins some of which are developing into little villages. Thus for instance the ruins of Main to the south-east of Madaba, Hawara, Jehil to the east, Mindwa to the north-east, Jizeh in the district of the railway. I his latter locality appears to have a brilliant future on account of the neighbourhood of the railway. There is a Mudir ot Wadi Wale but there is no locality of that name. The Mudir lives sometimes in a small isolated house built in the wadi by the water-side on the road from Kerak to Madaba, sometimes in a tent with his administrators the Hamaideh : and from time to time he comes for a holiday to Madaba. Fhe chief supplies of water in the region are: the numerous wells of Themed to the west of Kalaat Dabaa or Kasr el-Belka; farther west the Wadi Wale, the chief tributary of the Mojib; to the north of the Wale, Ain ez-Zerka or spring of Zerka- Main ; in the latter wadi are some celebrated rising at a temperature of 45° and even 60° cent. spring sulphur springs . .. - - An hour and an halt to the north-west ot Madaba one finds the two big springs of Jedeideh and the Ayun Musa, where J ' 1 ^ ° for their water when then ', w n^i o the people of cisterns are dry. Finally, Madaba go hours L a two499 to the north of the last locality, appear the splendid spring of Ain Hesban and ruins of the same name. Amman .—The ancient Rabbath Ammon of the Bible, and Philadelphia of the Grecian and Roman epoch, is one of the finest ruins beyond Jordan ; its theatre can accommodate 1,000 spectators. The town is built on the top of an isolated hill where the Acropolis stood, and in the valley all along the River Jabbok which takes its source a few feet farther away. A colony of Circassians has settled down in the midst of the ruins in the valley and now forms a big village of about 1,800 inhabitants, with a Mudir at its head. A few people from es-Salt and from elsewhere have also come to settle down in the locality. The station is three-quarters of an hour away down stream on the right bank of the wadi and just by the river. Round about Amman one finds several Cherkess colonies. The most important is that of Wadi Sir, two and a half hours to the west. It is a big village of 1,000 inhabitants with pretty and neat wood houses, very different to the dirty houses of Arab villages. Water flows plentifully down the valley and plenty of trees and vegetation remind one of some French country village. Two short hours to the south of the Wadi Sir is the colony of Naur. There are two other colonies to the north of Amman along the Zerka : the one near Ivalaat ez-Zerka and the other at Yajuz, half-way between Kalaat ez-Zerka and Amman. The two last had just been built, when we visited them some ten years ago. All these Circassians are devoted to the Ottoman Govern ment and many of them serve in the Gendarmerie. 1 he plateau round about Amman is mountainous; it is fertile and the Circassians have worked towards the development and the culture of the lands upon which they chiefly live. Es-Salt. —Es-Salt is the seat of the Kaimmakam of the Bel ka and the true present capital of the country. It is quite a town with about 20,000 inhabitants. This population includes about 5,000 Christians of whom a little over 1,000 are Roman Catholics, nearly 3,000 are Greeks and several hundred are Protestants. There are a flourishing Latin Mission with Sisteis of the Rosary, two Greek Churches, and an English Protestant Mission with a doctor and a hospital. The Turks also have several schools. One and a half hours to the south-east of es-Salt one finds the little Christian village of el-Fehes ; there is another at Er-Rememim three hours to the north-east; they each possess a Latin Mission. Besides these localities one only finds in the region the village of er-Rumman, inhabited b_\ a colony of Turcomans, to the north of er-Rememim on the road from Amman to Jerash. The region of es-Salt is very mountainous but mteisected by very fertile, well watered valleys, some of which are partly cultivated. The Wadi Shueib, in which es-Salt is situated, is a real garden on the outskirts of the town. The mountain slopes o500 — are most favourable for the vine cultivation ; and the grapes of es-Salt are celebrated. The Jebel Osha, to the north of es-Salt, is the highest point in all the country. From this height one obtains a splendid view of the valley of the Jordan and of Western Palestine. The numerous springs of es-Salt give birth to a river which flows into the Jordan ; such is also the case with the springs of the Wadi Sir. One and a half hours to the south of the village of this name on the right side of the valley, one finds the ruins of Arak el-Emir (Tyros of the historian Josephus), the renjains of a palace or temple and of a village, and also some caverns in the mountain sides. [Note by Arab Bureau.—This statement practically ignores a large semi-settled Bedouin element whose numerical distribution greatly alters the population figures, as given above : e.g. Kerak and its immediate environs have, in reality, many more inhabitants than es-Salt. The whole region is much better peopled and cultivated than the above extract suggests.] ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Railway Operations. (u) Southern Section .—In the whole of his recent fighting, including that at Stabl Antar and that between Seil Matara ami Zumurrud which lasted from November 27 to about December 3 . Sherif Abdullah claims to have killed 250 Turks, and captured ninety-three men with 300 rifles. He also claims to have destroyed 1,000 rails between Seil Matara and Zumurrud. A va^ue unconfirmed report states that Aziz Effendi also has destroyed 600 rails between Hadiyah (otherwise called Hareimil) and Urn Hasheim. We do not know whether the last named place is north or south of the first. (5) Northern Section.—We can now correct previous informa tion about train demolitions in November. Only two trains Avere destroyed, the first at Khirbet-es-Samra on the 11th (see p. 490), the second near Jebel Hafira a few days later. The latter tram was proceeding between Farafra and Menzil at about 7.30 a.m. The engine was destroyed, with its driver but the fii eman escaped. A Furbish and a German officer Avere killed trying to escape from the wreck. The train was carrying’ a convoy of fifteen or twenty sick men, whom the Arabs left in their waggons. Several waggons were destroyed, and three officers and other prisoners Avere brought away. On the 17th Sbpi-if Husein Shakrani (or, rather, Fat el-Moayad, who was the“ leader, supported by Sheikhs Suleiman 'and Trad o£ the Abu Nueins section o£ the Beni Sakhr) broke a bridge near el-Hasa and captured seventeen prisoners.— 501 — While the Turks hold the railway line itself in fair force, they keep very few iney in such places as Tafileh and Kerak off the track, and they will probably abandon the Hish Forest when the expedition already organised by Feisal to attack enemy posts east of the Dead Sea, begins to move north from Wadi Musa. Medina G arrison. Captain Depui has passed to Major Cornwallis a corrected copy of his estimate of the Medina garrison and list of the staff personnel, compiled originally in October last. The chief feature is the evidence of wastage. According to Capt. Depui, the 42nd Regt. has now a total strength of only 650, its 1st battalion at Bir el-Mashi being 250 strong and the other two 200 each. The 55th Regt. has a total of 050, of whicli the 1 st battalion, distributed along the railway up to Bowat, supplies 390. With Camel Corps, 300 men—Heavy Artillery, 150—Railway Battalion (1 coy.) 80—Depot troops, 200, and 350 men in hospital, Capt. Depui makes ont a grand total for the H.E.F., Medina Section, of only just above 3,000 men. If, as reported from other sources, forty per cent of these are unlit, Medina is in preUy bad case. Sherif Ali has been bombarding the delajilah outpost and reports that he has destroyed a gun and inflicted numerous casualties but he had two of his own guns put out of action. Maan Operations. The Arabs have occupied Ain Busta with a company, having two machine guns. The Arabs now hold el-Batra, Bir Nasara, and Fuweilah, all in the neighbourhood of the main pass, Nagb esh-Shtar, on to the Maan plateau ; and a track for armoured cars is being pushed on up the pass. The first battalion, 178th Regiment, is reported to have been so badly cut up at Fuweilah that it has had to be reformed. Its O.C. was sent to Damascus for court-martial. General. Quarantine restrictions in regard to Akaba were removed on December 5. Captain Depui told Colonel Wilson at Yambo in the latter part of last month, that the Sultani Road from Rabugh northwards was then far from safe for the passage of Sherifial parties, although since the incident in October, mentioned on page 428, Algerian detachments, on their way to and from Sherif All’s Camp, had, as a matter of fact, traversed it unmolested. Sheikh Husein Mubarak has regained some control over the Zobeid Masruh and is in the Rabugh neighbourhood, though with no great following. Captain Depui thought that European officers should, for the present, take only the Juheinah road inland, as he himself proposed to do.[ Late News .— The Jazi section of the Huvveitat, accompanied by Sherif Nasir, is threatening Shobak and Hisli, and when the reinforcement of mounted “ regulars,” now on its way from Akaba, has got up, a move on Tafileh and Iverak, in conjunction with Beni Bakin' and Terrabin, will be made. The Beni Atiyah, with Merzuk el-Teheimi, have moved up to the railway between Mudowarrah and Tebuk. Ibn Rashid is reported blockaded by tribesmen in Medain Salih.] A Raid. 1 left Akaba on October 24, with Capt. Gr. Lloyd, Lieut. Wood, R.E. and the Indian Machine Gun Company. The Indians took two Vickers, and 1 took two Lewis guns with me. We marched to Rum (October 25) and thence across El-Gaa and up W. Hafir to near Batra. We crossed the railway just south of Bir el-Shedia and reached el-Jefer on October 28. Capt. Lloyd returned to Akaba from there. Sherif Ali ibn Husein overtook us, and the party marched to Bair, picked up Sheikh Mifleh el-Zebn and fifteen Sukhur and reached Amri on November 2 . On November 5 we camped at Kseir el-Hallabat, and on the 7th failed to rush the bridge at Tell el-Shehab, and returned to Kseir. Thence the Indian M.G. Company with Lieut. Wood, returned to Azrak. I went with sixty Arabs to Minefir, blew up a train at Kil. 172 on November 11 and reached Azrak on the 12th. My intention had been to reach Jisr el-Hemmi on November 3 , but this proved impossible, since rain had made the Jaulaan plain too slippery for our camels, and the Turks had put hundreds of woodcutters in the Irbid hills. This closed both the north and south roads, and left Tell el-Shehab (Bridge 14) the only approachable bridge in the Yarmuk valley. My first plan was to rush it by camel marches of fifty miles a day. This idea also failed, since by their best efforts the Indian Machine Gun Company were only able to do thirty to thirty-five miles a day, and even this pace cut up their camels very quickly, owing to their inexperience. They all did their best, and gave me no trouble at all, but were simply unable to march fast. I decided, therefore, to raise an Arab force, and descend on the bridge in strength. The Abu Tayi refused to come, only fifteen Sukhur would take it on, and I had to rely mainly on thirty Serahin recruits at Azrak. They were untried men and proved little use at the pinch. For the last stage to the bridge, as hard riding was involved, I picked out six of the Indians,’ with their officer, and we got actually to the bridge at midnight on November 7. It is a position of some strength, but could, I think, be rushed by twenty decent men. The Indians with me weie too few to attempt it, and the Serahin, as soon as the Turks opened fire, dumped their dynamite into the valley and bolted. In the circumstances 1 called everyone off as quickly as possible and went back to Kseir el-Hallabat. The Indians withus were very tired with the ride, which was a fairly fast one, of ninety miles in twenty-two hours. The Bedu and the Sherif wanted to do something more before returning to Azrak, and had the Indians been fitter, we could have put in a useful raid ; but they were tired and had only half a day’s ration left, since all extra stuff had been placed at Azrak. The situation was explained to the Sherif, who said it would be enough to mine a train, without making a machine gun attack upon it. The Bedu agreed, and we went off together. The party was composed of Sherif Ali with ten servants, myself with one, twenty Sukhur and thirty Serahin. None of us had any food at all. We went to Minifir, to Kil. 172, where I mined the line in June last. As the Bedu had lost my dynamite at the bridge I was only able to put 30 lbs. into the mine, which I laid on the crown of a four metre culvert (about eighteen feet high) and took the wires as far up the hill-side toward cover as they would reach. Owing to the shortage of cable this was only sixty yards, and we had to leave the ends buried, for fear of patrols. A train came down before dawn on the 10th, too fast for me to get to the exploder from my watching place. In the morning of the 10 th a train of refugees came up at four miles an hour from the south. The exploder failed to work, and the whole train crawled past me as I lay on the flat next the wires. For some reason no one shot at me, and after it had passed 1 took the exploder away and overhauled it, while a Turkish patrol came up and searched the ground very carefully. That night we slept on the head of the wires, and no train appeared, till 10 a.m. on November 11. Then a troop train of twelve coaches and two locomotives came down from the north at twenty miles an hour. 1 touched off under the engine and the explosion was tremendous. Something must have happened to the boiler for I was knocked backwards and boiler plates flew about in all directions. One fragment smashed the exploder, which I therefore left in place, with the wires. The first engine fell into the valley on the east side of the line; the second up-ended into the space where the culvert had been, and toppled over on to the tender of the first. The frame buckled, and 1 doubt whether it can be repaired. Its tender went down the embankment west, and the first two coaches telescoped into the culvert site. The next three or four were derailed. Meanwhile I made quite creditable time across the open, up-hill towards the Arabs, who had a fair position, and were shooting fast over me into the coaches, which were crowded with soldiers. The Turkish losses were obviously quite heavy. Unfortunately many of the Serahm had no rifles, and could only throw unavailing stones the Turks took cover behind the bank, and opened a fairly hot flic at us. They were about 200 strong by now. Sherif Ah brought down a party of twenty-two to meet me, but lost seven killed and more wounded and had some narrow escapes himself before getting back.The train may have contained someone of importance, for there were a flagged saloon-car, an Imam, and a motor car in it. I suspect someone wanted to go via Amman to Jerusalem. We riddled the saloon. The Turks, seeing us so few, put in an attack later which cost them about twenty casualties, and then began to work up the slopes to right and left of us. So we went off, and reached Azrak next day. This mine showed that sixty yards of cable is too little for firing heavy charges under locomotives. 1 had first to survive the rain of boiler plates, and then to run up a steep hill for 400 yards under fire. By good chance it was impossible to carry off the wire, so the performance cannot be repeated till more comes from Akaba. The march also showed the staying qualities of the Bedouins. They rode ninety miles without food or rest on the 8 th, ate a small meal on the morning of the 9th and sat out hungry two nights and three days of bitterly cold wind and rain (we had not the satisfaction of being steadily wet, but were wetted and dried five times) till the evening of the 11 th when we killed them a riding camel; after which they rode into Azrak cheerfully. The Recent Pilgrimage. A closer analysis of the constituents of the last Hajj shows the following distribution :— T.E.L. NOTES. Wahabites (with Mohammed es-Saud) ...

The incident at Muna, mentioned on page 401, seems to have followed on an attempt by some Yemenis to march under a Turkish flag to Arafat. Mutawwifs and Imams in Hejaz. The 395 licensed religious guides in Hejaz are all under the control of Sheikh Ahmed es-Sabahi of Mecca. They are apportioned thus, according to latest information :— Mecca . Jiddah . Total. For Indian pilgrims ... ... ... 70 30 100 For Javanese pilgrims ... ... ... 110 40 150 For Egyptian and Persian pilgrims ... 75 20 95 For Sudanese pilgrims ... ... ... 30 20 50 395 Mecca has 120 Imams to lead prayer in the Haram. The office is hereditary, but only half the total number are also Khatibs, licensed to preach the Friday sermon. Of this superior sixty, thirty-five are for the Hanafi sect, fifteen for the Shafei, and ten for the Malki. The Hanbali, of whom are the Wahabites, are thus left unprovided for. Wahabites at Mecca. According to reliable information there was no friction with the Wahabite contingent which accompanied the Emir Mohammed es-Saud on the recent Pilgrimage ; but so lively was King Husein’s previous apprehension that he sent a strong force of tribesmen, under Sherif Hamza el-Feir, to meet the Wahabites on the way and disarm them if their intent seemed hostile. The 8 i D -ht, however, of 400 women and children in their train reassured Sherif Hamza. The Wahabites were prevented, as far as possible, from mixing with the Meccans and the Mutawwifin were forbidden to have any dealings with them, lest trouble should arise from clandestine exactions (e.g. the fraud habitually practised on the simpler pilgrims at a certain place neai the Kaabah wall, and resulting in the extraction of an extra fee on the plea that the Archangel Gabriel himself is waiting there to be tipped !). Strict orders against intermarriage with Wahabites— 506 — were issued to the Meccans. Both the armament and the military bearing of Ibn Sand’s men impressed our informant considerably, and they beat the Sherifians decisively in a contest of horsemanship and use of arms, held before King Husein at Muna. Idrisis Campaign. The only sign of Idrisi and his Hashid auxiliaries having got to work, has come to us in the Aden Letter No. 32, of November 24, which reports certain rumours : ( 1 ) that, following a fight near Loheiya, on October 23, in which the Turks lost twenty-five killed and ten wounded and Idrisi’s force at least as many, Ghalib Bey had to bring down three companies from Hajjur, to strengthen the Abs garrisons : ( 2 ) that the Imam’s officials and soldiers have been turned by Sheikhs Nasir Mabkhut and Hizam es-Saar out of the following towns in and near the Hashid country Fa wilah, Hajja, Rida, Kaukeban, Aids and Amran. Appended to this Aden Letter is a translation of a lom&gt;’ document signed by nearly a hundred names and purportimr be the Hashid and Bekil agreement with Idrisi. Among°the signatories we do not detect any of the best known Hashid names e.g. Nasir Mabkhut, Masud el-Barak or Snlili Muslih though two chiefs at the head of the list may be members of the family of the first named. On the other hand we do detect names which seem to belong to Aden Hinterland tubes e.g Muqbil Naji. Till further light is thrown on this document, it is hardly worth while to attempt an analysis of its signatories. ^ Colonel Hamilton’s Journey.

Cornwallis. Major, Director, Arab Bureau.PAN-TUHAN AND THE ARABS A Report, dated early in November, circulated and probably seen by most readers o£ the Arab Bulletin, purports to reproduce the views of someone very well acquainted with Turkey, concerning the genesis, development and future programme of the “ Turanian Movement From internal evidence, we may conclude safely that this person is a member of the Turkish Opposition in partibus inUdelium. What he states is exceedingly illuminating and interesting, but being obviously “ tendentious ”, must be received with reserve. The primary object of this speaker evidently was to divert us and our Allies from the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, by demonstrating that a Turkey, still clogged with Arabs and in consequence still predominantly Islamic, would be much more comformable to our interest in the future than a Turkey, free of the Arabs, divorced from the leadership of Islam, and concentrated on the pan- Turanian ideal of one nation from the Hellespont to China and from the Caucasus to Afghanistan. His policy, in fact, is the same as that of certain optimistic Turkish exiles, who, as soon as Gaza was ours, demanded to be installed forthwith, under our guarantee and at our charges, as salaried provisional admini strators of southern Palestine ! Bearing in mind, however, his parti pris, we may learn from this Turk’s statements something more about the Turanian Movement than either “ Tekin-Alp ” (Dr. Cohn) or our other sources of information have told us. The most prominent features, new and more or less true, of his exposition are as follows :— 1 . That the leading part in the conception and promotion of the Turan Movement was played by the Deunmeh Jews of Salonica. The speaker explains with much plausibility the motive of the Deunmeh in this matter. The Salonica Jews, he says, unlike most Oriental Jews, have grown rich by their own efforts without foreign help. This they have accomplished by exploiting the Turks, and, therefore, they regard their own future prosperity as bound up with the continuance of an Ottoman Empire. ' In their anti-Moslem zeal, they advocate the abandon ment of the Arab provinces, being further disposed to that course by a desire not to be involved with the impecunious Palestinian Jews and the American and other supporters of the latter, whom they have always kept at arm s length. 2. The backing of Germany. This is financial, intellectual and moral. According to our present informant, it has become active since the loss of Baghdad discredited the u Mitteleuropa ” scheme. The Germans have abandoned Berlin-Baghdad for Berlin-Bokhara, and now look to their future control of a solid Turki belt, running up the heart— 508 — of Central Asia, both to indemnify them (and more) for the loss of Mesopotamia, etc., and also to enable them to strike at the British Empire and eventually recover all S.W. Asia. In the meantime, says our Turk, they rely upon Great Britain being blinded by an illusion of present success to the catastrophe they are preparing for her all the more surely. To obtain this end in the future the Germans will, if necessary, sacrifice their Turkish allies in the present. 3. These Jewish and German in fluences dispose a majority of the C.U.P. to be not only willing, but anxious, to cede the Arab Provinces and have done with pro-Turk Arabs and with Islam and pan-Islamism. It is admitted, however, that this majority is still held in check by a very powerful and determined minority. It is the latter, presumably, that Germany is secretly preparing to coerce and betray. The speaker ended by improving his occasion. Has England, he asked, the statesman capable of grasping the fact that the loss of the Arabian provinces will be the signal for an irresistible expansion of Turkey in another and far more dangerous direction ? On the other hand, he concluded, Turkey’s retention of these provinces, under some form of local government, would strengthen the hands of all moderate and pro-British members of the C.U.P. and help them to knock out Jews and German-paid adventurers. We are not converted. It would take a good deal more than this interested argument to convince us of the necessity for ensuing no better end than the exchange of one set of Turks for another in the Arab provinces—Opposition for Government or Majority for Minority C.U.P. The Young Turk, as men say, i s son of the Old Turk, and the Old is the father of the Youncr. Plus ga change, plus Test la me me chose! We do not deny for a moment the main contention of this Keport that the Ottoman Turks are looking to a new world in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan, the Central Khanates and Eastern I urkestan to redress the balance of the old. Further there are powerful Turanian elements lying outside, but adjacent to, that central Asiatic belt which will sympathize with, assist and possibly join up with the Movement, notably the Tartars of Kazan, the lurks of the Crimea, and, perhaps, the Afghans and the Mongols. But whether it is in any way possible to realize such a continuous pan-Turk belt and make one nation throughout it, is quite a different question. The difficulties, so luditlv finished aside by the Turkish pleader, are very great — difficulties, geographical and ethnical, caused by the Armeno- ft/fUrd Caucasian and the Persian interruptions of the belt fl '° m |? 1S s P ecial Pleading, our Turkish counsellor impairs his power of conviction by begging two imnortant questions, begged already by “ Tekin-ffp and a/ otherNeo-Turanian propagandists. First, that the Ottomans, the least Turki of Turks, will continue to control the new Turki Nation if they shall have succeeded in promoting it. Second, that Germany, whether through the Ottomans or otherwise, is certain to have that Nation’s sympathies, and to direct its policy against Great Britain. D. G. H. JEMAL AND THE ARABS. Ahmed Jemal Pasha has been figuring of late in the old role of the pro-Arab Turk, which, despite all Syrian and Arab blood on his hands, he still regards as his to play. On the last day of November he was in Beirut making a speech at a municipal banquet, held in his honour; and, with the help of that champion of Syrian liberties, Sheikh Asad Shuqeir, to render into the speech of his beloved Beirutis the rude, but honest, Turkish of their Friend, he delivered an apologia, which is not without interest. It was the morrow of the loss of Jaffa and the eve of the loss of Jerusalem 5 but the last event he assuied Ins hearers would never come to pass any more than could the fall of Medina. If anyone was saying Turkey was about to collapse, it could only be one of the miserable few whom he had hesitated, from misplaced kindness, to exile at the first. He had always spoken in the warmest terms of the Syrians : they were his brothers whose interest was his own. He stood for them and they for him, even if he had, to his regret, hanged a good many of them at one time or another. Was not Fever really moie responsible for this ? And when all was said and done he, denial, was bound by Moslem Law under which hanging is normal At least he had done his best to produce one mind among Moslems, even if he had failed in the capital object with which he came to Syria, the delivery of Egypt from the British ; and to illustrate his zeal in the past for unity in Islam and the Arab race, if not his success, he detailed at' some length his correspondence with leading Arabs since the opening of the war, notably with Sherit Husein and his sons. His overtures, he admitted, were never met quite in the spirit wfth which they were offered. Sherit Feisal, after being sent by his father to Damascus at Jemals request, and forwarded by the latter to Constantinople, swore at Jerusalem, when he had heard all the lurks had to say, to Je “ a martvr for his country”, and then disappeared for six months leaving no address : Sherif Ali brought 4,000 men to Medina as requested, but had the bad manners to demand the control of the city as the price of co-operation on the Canal, to accede to such importunity, however, would have been too clear a proof of weakness. However Jemal does not bear malice, and having— 510 — - been supplied with new cards by revelations from the Russian Foreign Office, he told his hearers at Beirut that he had reopened the game by writing to Sherif Husein a candid statement of what the latter had and had not to expect from his British allies ; and lie had great hopes that the Sherif would repent at the eleventh hour, and return to the bosom of Mother Turkey, deserting the anti-Islamic Britons. 1 his letter has not come into our hands, but two others, dated November Id, and no doubt pendants to the first, have been communicated by Sherif Feisal, to whom and to Jaafar Pasha respectively they were addressed. I hey are good letters, by whomsoever composed, and irreproachable in tone. To Feisal, ? Jemal writing under the inspiration of religious duty, speaks of high policy. I he Y oung 1 urks entered the war to stay the degradation of Islam, to live in majesty and independence or perish with honour. Where severity was necessary to that end they were severe, and feisal himself had admitted that the end justified the means adopted. If the latter really thought he could establish such an Arab government as would ^secure independence, dignity and splendour for Islam, Jemal could understand his action. But if, as was known now, Palestine is to be International, Syria French, Irak and Mesopotamia British, how could such an Arab government ever be ? The spectacle of the British in Palestine should be enough ! It was not too late tor an amnesty and negotiations, in the best interests of Islam, if beisal would come to Damascus under safe conduct (a supple mentary letter froin^ Sheikh Mohammed Bedr ed-Din, an old pllce) ° Sheritkl fami, - V ’ su &amp;g' ests Maan as the meeting r 1ai ' 1 ,aafai ' 18 remi “ ded his Iiei ‘°ic past, when lie was aiding Islam to conquer Egypt by striking from the West - this is rV he P rTn T hen his ac ti°n is alone rendering SaWlin^r f^°rl A en W to invade the country which Sal ad m defended. Will not Jaafar come and talk this matter over at Damascus? On Jemal’s military honoui he shall thereafter return in peace. ^ These letters have gone on to King Husein who has Ocnn.i.i,a,, a.,: “ r ‘‘' y - '• * '* UT eati e ™ al ,’n,r eSe ' t rT^’V is a c,Irious illustration of how failures Hk F 8y 'T 10111 r ,fteri »g tlle common lot of St ‘rr his Syi ' im ' strou ^ o ' &lt;i ^ xTeTot s r;rt.'oXmm — 511 — bowstring or the Bosphorus would infallibly have awaited him. He has obeyed, even gone on to Berlin, been everywhere more courted than castigated, and returned to smile on his dear Beirutis and Damascenes. No doubt he can claim achievements to set off his failures. He has induced us to spend millions on the defence of Egypt, and divert armies sorely needed elsewhere; he has combed out Syria till it has not a head and hardly a hand to make rebellion. But he must have something more to rely upon than that. Probably his strength lies in his championship of Islam—sincere enough because he has made this his line in public life, and he can be false to everything but his own interest. Among prominent Ministers he is the only one who stands for that, and greatly as the “Turanians” would like to have him and all ot her pro-Islamic Turks out of the way, they dare not put him out. The majority of ordinary Turks in the Empire still believe in Islam and the necessity of retaining the Arab provinces and they, probably, still believe that Jemal believes. Therefore Jemal remains, sine die, however Falkenhayn may rao-e or Enver imagine a vain thing. D. Gf. H. ABDULLAH AND THE AKHWAN. The following are notes of the talk of Sherif Feisal during a conversation which I had with him on December 4 : “ It is not fair to condemn my brother, Abdullah, without reserve. He is taking no part in the war against the I urks, because his whole heart, his head, and all his resources are engaged in the problems of Nejd. He is king of the Ateibah and of pai t of the Meteir and Heteym, and is daily increasing his hold on the outliers of Qasim and Jebel Shammar. I he responsibility for order in Western Nejd has always lain upon Abdullah. When my Father came to the throne he found all the border tribes in a turmoil, and Abdullah led expedition after expedition against them (while I crushed the Idrisi, by the help of the Turks) until his name was feared from Taif to Shaharah, and all the chiefs of the Ateibah came to him for orders and directions. In those days we were beset by our religious enemies, the Wahabis and'the Idrisis, and were fighting for our lives. After that there was peace until we had revolted against the 1 urks and marched to Wejh. Then again began troubles in Nejd. Abdullah Garrisoned Henakiyah, and Ibn Sand took alarm. Once more he has sent out all his missionaries. The name ‘ Akhwan,’ which you use is not properly applied to the converts. It began as the title of the brotheihood of preachers. Now it is used loosely of the disciples also. The Akhwan take over all the Senefiyeh tenets, especially the saying that Mohammed was a man with a message, who is dead. Theyadd stricter rules of consanguinity, veil their women even in the house, are fatalists to a forbidden degree, and hold as first principle the law of Jihad, at the call of the Imam and the Ulema. 1 fear always that to-morrow, when the stress comes, they will reject the authority of the Koran (in the interpretation of which they differ greatly from us), as they reject the Prophet to-day. Their imam is Ibn Sand, but the title is not significant; yet they regard him as the head of their tarika and submit themselves wholly to his orders. He pays the salaries of all the preachers, many hundreds of them ; but the moving spirit of the whole is one of the Ulema of Riyadh. They appeal only to Bedu, and sow discord between them and the hadhar. Riyadh (or the aalim village near it) is the centre of the new doctrine. Eight out of ten Nejd Bedu follow the Akhwan, and the Taif branch is rapidly winning over the tribes of Northern Yemen. The Zobeir men are influencing the Shamiyah Arabs ; one fourth of the Shammar have allied themselves to it, and only the energy of Nuri has kept it out of the Anazeh. The converts stir each other up to a pitch of extreme fanaticism, but their subjection to the college at Riyadh is absolute, and the college is the creation of Ibn Sand, who pays and feeds the preachers. He insists on peace at present, and is friendly to you. He suffers Ibn Rashid to exist till he has converted the other Shammar. When his time comes he will direct the force of the Bedu in turn against the settled peoples of Arabia: taking piece-meal, first Qasim, then Hail, then the Hejaz, then Iraq and Syria, he will impose everywhere the new doctrine, and sway the peninsula. Abdullah is making head against all this. The first step in his ambition is to win the Shammar, and in this he is making- steady progress. He has lost the Heteym, who have gone over to the new faith ; but his hold upon the Ateibah is very strong and he is daily confirming it. Without the Ateibah Ibn Saud can never take the Hejaz. These measures are defensive, and so far as his means go, Abdullah is extending them. He is also carrying tie war into Ibn Sands camp, in Qasim, the weak point of the Akhwan scheme. Aneizah, Bureidah and Rass are comfortable towns. heir young men have enlisted in our, and the Turkish Government s, ageyl, and there learnt tolerance and the use of indTll ,1 ley T'f' ; lft u three or four years to their homes, ami tel! the people ot the Hejnz government, where the savagery humanitv oTV e ,’ Y ™ 1 '’f k' Saud - is ^ftened bv the humanity ol the ruler to accord wijth the spirit of the time.

If we fail, all our efforts and victories over the Turks will be wasted. Great Britain will not profit by the Arab revival, if the tomb at Medina and the Haram at Mecca are destroyed, and the pilgrimage is prevented. Abdullah is fighting all our battles, and if he has no leisure to campaign against the railway meanwhile, he should not be judged too harshly.” ^ T.E.L. ARABIA. North-west. Intelligence. Bailway Operations. &gt; (a) Southern Section .—News came, just too late for our last issue, through Sherif Feisal from Mersuk el-leheimi, that Mohammedibn Gasseb (an Atiyah (?) chief) at the head of a party of fifty Arabs had mined and derailed a train proceeding southward from Kalaat el-Akhdar on or about December 12. It contained the two chiefs sent down expressly from Damascus by Jemal Pasha, Suleiman Pasha Rifadah of the Billi and Shehab of the Fuqara, each accompanied by a son. The first especially had a train of followers, and an escort of sixty to seventy soldieis accompanied them. Either by the explosion or in the subsequent fiediting Suleiman Pasha and his son, Eid, were killed together with a, dozen of their followers. Shehab and his son were captured, but in the contusion contrived subsequently to escape. The escort is reported to have been wiped out before the reinforcements, hurried up from north and south, could dri\e in the outposts put out by the Arabs to delay them. Having very short time at their disposal, the Arabs could not loot the whole train, which was loaded with supplies for Urn ^ Rashid among other things ; but they succeeded in carrying off 300 rifles, and L.T.24 000 in gold—the last being part, doubtless, of the cash which has been promised to the H.E.F. for winding up its affairs The whole operation, by which a singularly consistent and impracticable pro-Turk Arab of importance has been removed, illustrates the zeal and effectiveness with which a Bedouin force will carry through an attack, if their reward depends on their own exertions. Akaba Operations. Colonel Joyce wrote on December 4 that the forward base at Gueira was being steadily formed, and all available came s sent up with supplies and military stores. _ Sherif Feisal intern s shortly to attack Abu Lesal, where there is believed to be one— 514 Turkish battalion, estimated at 500 to 600, with three mountain guns, four machine guns, and a very few mounted troops. The Arab levies will be concentrated at (jueira, Helou el-Beida, and Delagha, which are all within easy striking distance of Abu Lesal. No very important military results are likely to be obtained, even if the attack is successful, but the operation will at least afford an opportunity of testing the Arab troops, who are as yet practically untried. The Arab levies have been withdrawn from Elji (see pp. 447 and 475) and their place taken by some of Sherif Zeid’s Ateiba and Ageyl, supported by two Indian mounted guns and two machine guns. The severe cold in this part of Arabia is having a somewhat depressing effect on the Sherifian army. [Late News—kz\z Effendi reports that he destroyed 100 rails and three bridges on the 12 th inst. between Seil Matara and Urn Hashaim, which is presumably north of Hadiyah. (See p. 500.) MESOPOTAMIA. Journey from Bayhdad to Sinjar. A lepoi t has leached us from Arab Bureau, Baghdad concerning the journey of Sheikh Mutluq, who was sent by the O.P.O. on a mission to Jebel Sinjar, and has now returned/ He took, both going and returning, the nlmost unknown Wadi lharthar route, striking the valley at the well of Abu Khashab one day from Istablat. Hence, with camels provided by the A1 hu Saqr, under Ehalaf ibn Suwein, he rode northward a crow- % distance of 130 miles m sixty hours, the actual distance covered being increased to near 200 miles by the windings of the wadi, whose series of salty wells had to be followed. The Sheikh has given the following scheme of his route, all places mentioned being wells. 1 Aim Kliasluib, parallel with Samarra. (&gt; hours, Uweisijah.

The Sheikh met Hammu Sharu, the Vezidi chief, in Jebel Sinjar and brought back from him a friendly but temporising letter, such as a marked rebel, isolated near strong Turkish forces, might be expected to write. As regards the Jerba Shammar, the Sheikh reports that Asi, with the greater part of the Shammar, is to the north of the Sinjar near Nisibin, where they go in summer for water and pasturage. The Tai are in the foot hills between Nisibin and Mardin. Both tribes, when they are in these pasturages, are under the thumb of the Turks. They will come south after the first rains. Mutluq heard nothing of any attempt on the part of the Milli Kurds to cut the railway. Humeidi ibn Far ban is now on the Zab. It is rather surprising news that Sheikh Mutluq passed everywhere for an emissary of King Husein and was assured of honour and welcome in that capacity. But there are evidently numerous feuds to be compounded between tribes which profess common adherence to the Sherifian cause : e.f). Sheikh Mutluq was not admitted to Ubeid country because of a feud with the Shammar, and Hammu would not venture into the same country as the Duleim. ABYSSINIA. According to recent reports the crisis expected at the end of September passed away, and the normal state of passiv e hostility of the various intriguing elements towards one another has been resumed, none venturing on a decisive step against his rival, lo'azu is not strong enough to act in the absence of his god-father, lias Demissie, who, by order of the Empress procured by Laffari, retired to his province, while the crowd of palace hangeis-on known as the Mahal Safari have been pacified by the grant of part of the province of the late Has Lul Segetfor their exploitation. Meanwhile each party watches the other, wishing* but not daring, to pounce and put its leaders in chains. ^ On the one hand is Igazu wit!) his supporters, Azzaj Gizau, AfaNegus I elahuny Lorn Chief Justice), Ganiazmach Bavena (Public Works), and Lij Wassem (Posts and Telegraphs) ; on the other, Has Taffari, whose position is fortified by the return to the capital of the victorious F itaurari Hapta Giorgis, lias Kassa, who has been appointed Governor of Dessie in the place of the late Ras Abate, and who is the one man whom Taffari really trusts Dejiu Mulugeta wlio to his orminal post of Minister for Foreign Affairs has added that of n i - ,,ii, i im,.,, Minister of Finance formerly held by gazu, Dejaz t&gt;eru,— 516 — has been given the promise of Sayu formerly belonging to Jotei, and Dejaz Wasseni. The Fitaurari acts as peacemaker and temporizer, a well-meant but wholly futile role, the parties being divided, not on questions of policy with any semblance of patriotic concern, but of profit and personal interests oidy, and are there fore fundamentally irreconcileable. Sooner or later, it is probable that one party or the other will find itself in chains, an experience which most Abyssinian Ministers enjoy sometime in the course of their career, fgazu has already once been in chains, during which time he was relieved of £70,000 which he had stolen from public funds ; Haili Giorgis is in chains now. The position may at any moment be reversed, and if so, the reversal would probably be to the interest of Abyssinia as well as to that of the Entente. The weakness of Ras Taffari’s position is that while, as Heir to the Throne, he has assumed the position of Regent, he has never been properly recognised as such by the Council of Ministers, who claim that their constitution by Menelik gives them a prior right to the administration of affairs. There is still no definite news of the fate of Lij Yasu, of whom nothing has been heard since the defeat of his forces at Bessie. The very circumstantial account of his death, reported by the man who claimed to have achieved it, has since been somewhat discredited, and it may be that Lij Yasu, according to his wont, avoided the dangers of battle and is still in hiding somewhere among the Danakils. The report of the death of his Commander-in-Chief, Ras Imer, proves unfounded, but he is a prisoner. Lij lasus other general, Serabezu, is, however, dead. Since the above went to press we hear that both the Fitaurari and Ras Ivassa, who returned with him to Adis Abeba related that Lij Yasu is alive and is thought to be in hiding in (he Ada! country, never having been within six miles of°the fight. Those, however, who have long experience of Abyssinia aie b\ no means convinced of the truth of this statement and think that the Government are keeping Lij Yasu’s death secret as they did that of the Emperor Menelik. In addition to his own province of balah, has hassa has been given Bessie and the Aussa territory, the province of the late Ras Abata.

Lady Anne Blunt. The death of Byron’s granddaughter, whom we still call by the name she had made familiar to students of Arabia, rather than by the title, Baroness Wentworth, which latterly had devolved upon her, removes the last of the Victorian explorers of Arabia, except her own husband and Charles Montagu Doughty. Until Miss Gertrude Bell went to Hail in 1914, Lady Anne remained the only British, or indeed European, lady who had been in Central Arabia. She died from weakness at the age of eighty in the Anglo-American Hospital at Cairo on Saturday, December 15. Besides her published volumes, written in collaboration with her husband, she leaves, in MS., a book dealing with the horse in Arab history, for which she drew on Bedouin tradition, especially that current among the Muteir. It is hoped that an arrangement will be made to render this book accessible in some provisional form, pending full publication after the war. Lady Anne had various relations with the Arab Bureau, and took a lively interest in its activities. Sinai Arabs. Sherif Feisal has been doing his best to establish good relations between ourselves and the Bedouin of Sinai and Southern Palestine. At his suggestion the following sheikhs, who were with him, have been sent to present themselves to our representative at Bir Saba : Hassan Abu Abdun {see p. 20), Ibrahim Abu Rakik (? Rakkayik, see p. 20), Salem el-Zerei, Azzam el-Hezeil, Muslem ibn Khafira and Gaddu’ el-Sufi. He has also requested that Sheikh Abd Rabboh Abu el-Hussein, who was formerly with the Turks and captured by us at Khan Yunis, should be pardoned and released. Some of the Sinai Bedouin are still hostile, and the Sawalha Arabs are said to have no intention of surrendering. Many, however, have recently come in to the authorities at lor and Abu Zenima. It is reported that Sheikh Suleiman el-Kabriti of the Terabin tribe {see p. 147), intends to surrender as soon as the state of his health permits. Idrisis Campaign. Reports from Kamaran indicate that fairly heavy fighting has taken place in the Beni Abs country. Idrisi, who is concentrating his forces with a view to an advance on Loheiya, states that further reinforcements have reached Jeizan, including contingents under Sheikh Jubran el-Ghashim, Nakib Yahya ibn Yahyaesh-Shaif and Ibn Hebeish of Sufian {seep. 475), and from several tribes under the control of Nasir ibn Mabkhut, such as the ’Usaimat and the Kharif.ARAB BULLETIN.

(a) Southern Section.—K Turkish 2nd Lieutenant of the l/55th Regt., Mohammed Tewfik, captured near Stahl Antar late in November, states that, at that date, there were a,bout 1,000 spare rails at Bueir station and varying stocks at other stations. Broken rails were collected and remade at the Medain Salih workshops. The train service was irregular, but had never been interrupted for more than three days at a time. There are plenty of repair gangs. As for food on the L. of C., only meat was scarce, the sole supply being sheep furnished by Ibn Rashid. The latter had a narrow escape on his return journey from Medina, the line being cut just behind his train while it was in Stahl Antar station. Another 2nd Lieutenant of the 2/55th Regt., Ahmed Hamdi, has reported that, on November 11 , Ali’s artillery wrecked the Bowat barracks and exploded all the rifle ammunition there. Major Cornwallis reports from Abu Markha that, owing to recent heavy rains, broken culverts, temporarily filled in with sand-bags, have had to be repaired afresh by the Turks. We have had other confirmatory evidence of disastrous floods along the railway line during the past month. General, Major Cornwallis writes (under date December 14) that, when Sherif Ali was in camp at defer, messengers arrived from Sheikh Aqab ibn Ajil, of the Abdah Shammar, maternal uncle of Ibn Rashid, bringing a present of six horses and six camels laden with semn, which are believed by Sherif Abdullah to have been sent as an “ olive branch ” by Ibn Rashid himself. When the latter was at Medina, Sherif Ali approached him through intermediaries of whom Sheikh Aqab was one, but received an evasive answer, in which Ibn Rashid said that being a guest at Medina, he could not in honour come over then, but that, when he should be again at el-Hejr (Medain Salih), he would see if he could get out of the Turks’ hands. He is virtually a prisoner, says Abdullah, (we have confirmatory evidence of the truth of this) and has made one unsuccessful attempt to break out towards Hail. Abdullah is inclined to accept his repentance, if definitely offered, but only on the strict understanding that he takes the field against the Turks. Failing that, the Sherifial family would favour his supersession at Hail by Dhari ibn Fahd el-Ubeid, who is now at Mecca : but they*are aware that the Shammar are not very willing to see the llbeids preferred to the elder Abdullah branch of the Rashid house, from which last have sprung all the— 520 — greater Emirs. Bat Dliari ? in any case, was better, thought Abdullah, than the self-seeking Subhan. A further report written on December 20 states that Ibn Rashid has sent an unfavourable reply to a letter from Ferhan el-Aida. In it he rejected the latter’s overtures but offered his services as intermediary if the King would recognize the error of his ways and return to the Turkish fold. It is not impossible that the 1 urks got wind of the communications which were taking place and dictated to Ibn Rashid the above replv. The Sheikh of Feima, Ali ibn Rumman, has gone to Mecca. The Sherarat are anxious to resume their old position at Teima, from which they were driven half a century ago by the Emir Telal, and Sherif Abdullah favours their restoration, since they will then be able to assist Ferhan el-Aida with an excellent body of fighting men. The following important Sherarat sheikhs came with thirty followers to Abn Markha, while Major Cornwallis was there : Kasib and Khalaf el-Lihawi, Misnid ibn Freih Mohammed and Fadh ibn Duweiri, Khalaf ibn Wardah’ Khuweiran es-Sebeihat, Shahban ed-Deilawi, and Hamid ibn Kehaiyim. Abdullah proposes to move his camp to Ain el-Turaa, about twenty miles west of Abu Naam, as soon as the tribesmen have collected again and from there to make another and more energetic attack on the railway. He seems to have been deterred tor a month or more past by pessimistic advice from his Syrians that it was useless to attempt railway stations, Seyyid Hilnn especially takmg tins view; but Colonel Wilson and Major Cornwallis have persuaded him to the Ain el-Turaa move and renewed activity. Unfortunately Colonel Wilson has now tallen ill and has had to come to Egypt. fAkht b n1 nah ’- S T iM P or .

A report from Wejh states that thirty-five Turks with a mountain gun and a machine gun deserted about December 28 from Ivhilis, a post described as being three miles south of el-Ula and one hour west of the railway. These Turks are expected to arrive shortly at Wejh. / deserters' Information. Food for the Turkish army in Palestine was, until recently, sent by boat from the Kerak district to the north of the Dead Sea. The port of Kerak is Glior Mezraa, whence supplies of wheat, barley, durra, tibn, goats, sheep, etc., were transported either to Ehdeib, west of the d or dan mouth, or up the river to the Jericho bridge. Deserters state that for this traffic about twenty boats were being used, two of which carried thirty to thirty-five tons each ; and there were three motor launches which could tow these boats in calm weather. One motor launch has been taken to Salt, and,is probably destined for Lake Tiberias. Ehdeib was recently bombed by our aircraft, as a result of which some twenty boatmen deserted ; but there are said to be about seventy remaining. Kerak produce went also to Katrani station, and thence both south to Medina and north to Deraa. The Turks paid twenty medjidiehs (£3/6/8) for 180 kilos, of wheat, and two medjidiehs for the transport of this quantity either to Gfhor Mezraa or Katrani. The army was regularly supplied with salt from Jebel Udsum, on the south-west corner of the Dead Sea. In the winter months the salt is said to break away from the mountain and to be found on the shore ready for loading. Deserters report that, about the middle of December, all the boats at Ehdeib had been sent to the Gfhor Mezraa to load and return as soon as possible, and the latest news, which comes from Akaba, is that the Turks are destroying all the stores of wheat they can lay hands on in the Kerak area. They intend, apparently, to evacuate this district, where they are believed to have four battalions estimated at 2,500 men. The local Arabs are hostile to them, and believe that Sheikh Qader Mujali, who was imprisoned bv the Turks and died, was poisoned by them. [Late News .—A recent report states that the Kerak Arabs are in open revolt and are besieging the Turkish garrison. With reference to Ahmed Jemal Pasha’s letter to Sherif Feisal, reported on page 510, King Husein has instructed Feisal by telegraph that he should reject without hesitation all proposals from Jemal.]— 522 — Nejd. A series of telegrams from Baghdad, dated December 20—21, acquaints us with the general outlines of the British Mission s conversations with Ibn Saud. As regards two points in dispute with the Sheikh of Koweit, it has been agreed ( 1 ) that the Ajman are no longer to be protected by the latter and allowed to range at will on Ibn Sand’s borders, but must either come into territory directly under his control or join Ibn Hadhdhal and maintain friendly relations with us ; ( 2 ) that the local Hawazim tribesmen will be recognised as definitely Koweit subjects and free of Ibn Sand’s taxes. As regards the leakage of supplies from Koweit, Ibn Sand holds that he cannot be made responsible and that it is for us to deal with the matter by blockade. Ibn Sand is taking no active measures against Ibn Rashid, and he gave our representatives an estimate of the latter’s armament and potential man-power which is very greatly in excess of the probable facts, his object obviously being to induce us to supply and arm himself against all possible eventualities. Nor did he appear to have taken into account the change wdnch has come over Ibn Rashid’s relation to the Turks during the past three months, and his greatly decreased importance as their possible ally (see p. 519). He could, indeed, hardly be expected to appreciate our view that Ibn Rashid is not of serious concern, except as a helper of the Turks, and that once detached from the enemy he might as well continue in power, as a factor in a desirable balance of eventual power among Arabian chiefs. One inember of our Mission, Capt. Philby, is continuing his journey right across Arabia to Taif. If he accomplishes this trip without mishap, he will put King Husein (who declined to guarantee a British officer’s journey in the reverse direction) in the dilemma of having to admit either that he is less able to frank a European through the Ateibah than is the Emir of Nejd, or that he had motives for refusal other than those he stated to us. [Later news tells us that Capt. Philby arrived safely at Taif, and is now at Jiddah.] LIBYA. Situation in Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. The period that has elapsed since the publication of the last bulletin under this heading (No. 71, page 478) has been uneventful, although, as usual, rumours have been plentiful. Mohammed Idris is now known to have left Akrama and must be either at Gedabia by now or in its immediate vicinity. Before leaving Akrama Mohammed Idris was visited by the Governor of the Western Desert, Major Royle, who had been despatched by the High Commissioner to convey to Idris the news of the Italian concession in the matter of supplying him with certain— 523 — war material. Idris expressed some dissent at the smallness of this concession and took the opportunity to submit a detailed list of his requirements. He was, however, considerably gratified by Major Royle’s visit, no less than by the presence of armoured cars in his camp, which news he took care to inform Major Royle would not be long in getting west and would doubtless be construed by his enemies to mean that the British armoured cars were actually assisting him. The armoured car is what the Arabs chiefly fear in these days. The situation as regards Bayed Ahmed has now had further light thrown upon it by the arrival at Gedabia of the coastguard deserter, Mohammed Saleh, who was Bayed Ahmed s chief military adviser during the Benussi occupation of the Egyptian Oases. Some time ago Mohammed Idris wrote to Bayed Ahmed presenting him with an ultimatum to the effect that he (Bayed Ahmed) must either submit to Idris or else retire to Kufra. Mohammed Saleh’s visit to Gedabia is probably connected with this ultimatum, and it will not be very surprising if we hear presently that Mohammed Idris and Bayed Ahmed have come to terms. 'In any case Mohammed Saleh’s intentions m visiting Gedabia cannot have been otherwise than genuine since, in order to reach his destination, he had to pass through two of Idris s out-posts in the Bert region. It may, however, be concluded with some assurance that his connections with the luikish pai ty in Tripoli have ceased, for it is not likely that he would venture into Idris’ headquarters as a Turkish agent. As regards the possibility of an eastward move by Ramadan and Nuri, the latest news comes from All Pasha el-Abdia, the delegate whom Idris sent to the High Commissioner and who has now returned west; according to Ali Pasha, Ramadan and Nuri are despatching two columns, one to seize Idris and invade Cyrenaica, the other to attack Siwa via Jalo and [t 18 possible, however, that in sending us this report, Ah Pasha has permitted his desire to assist his master to run away with ins pen as it is to the interest of Mohammed Idris to picture the situation in the sombrest tones, lest we be disposed to imagine that he was in no need of assistance. In any case interesting and authentic news should shortly be forthcoming from Idris himself at Gedabia. ... j n In the enemy camp the old friction between Ramadan and Nuri would appear to have broken out acutely once moie. Ramadan who lords it at Misurata has apparently been m the habit of extracting tolls and levies upon all that passes throug i his hands in the way of supplies from Turkey. He lately _ ie up a large consignment of Turkish gold destined for Ami and also refused to send reinforcements required by Nun. JNuri is said to have remonstrated saying that he would return to Constantinople if Ramadan did not keep the Iripolitan Ara s better supplied. It is not likely, however, that Ramadan w permit the breach to widen to that extent for he must realize V -— 524 that to quarrel with Nuri would be to seal his own fate. Cessation of the supplies brought to Misurata by submarine would necessitate the disbanding of his forces and whilst depri\ - ing him of the main source of the authority and prestige he now enjoys would further cause his own people to revile him for killing the goose that laid the golden eggs. fn the Western Desert of Egypt the latter days of November were marked by a strange, and as yet unexplained visit of an enemy dirigible which was seen over Dakhla and Faiafia Oases and was subsequently seen crossing the Mediterranean on its return journey. About the same time a strange seaplane was reported over Matruh and later a machine said to be an aeroplane was seen going north to sea over Bagbag. The Sudan Govern ment has also reported an aeroplane with a black cross seen by natives of Dongola during the same period. Whether there is any connection between the various machines reported is not yet discernible. As regards the present unsatisfactory situation in respect of reliable intelligence from Tripoli and Cyrenaica, the Italian Government has now been approached with a request for per mission for the establishment of a British Intelligence officer at Benghazi. D.B. NOTES. Asir. According to Aden Weekly Letter No. 33, dated December 8 , Idrisi is making active preparations for his attack on Loheiya and Zeidiyah and is confident of success. He has established H.Q. at Madaya, half-way between Jeizan and Midi, and has collected about 2,000 Hashid and Bekil tribesmen. It is said that Sheikh Ahmed Pasha of the Beni Jami has come over to him, and that Hadi ibn el-Heij will join also if Loheiya falls. There were four minor engagements with the forces of Ghalib Bey and Ibn Thawab of the Abs during November. The Turks are reported to be negotiating with the pro-Idrisi sections of the Rijal el-Ma, who like all the Asiri Highlanders, are suffering from want owing to locust devastation. Yemen. Though cereal crops on the Highlands have been unusually abundant this year, and prices of native foodstuffs rule very low, the Yemen 'Burks are reported by a Jew merchant, who has come through from Sana to Aden, to be in very low water. Their treasury is empty, and the Zeidi districts have refused taxes. The civil and military officials of the vilayet are at loggerheads—probably a recrudescence of the original jealousy manifested by the G.H.Q. Staff towards the vali, Mahmud NadimPasha. It is popularly believed at Sana that, before spring, if nothing occurs to alleviate their situation, the Turks will abandon the Highlands, and concentrate in the Tiharaah. The Imam Yahya is stated to have recovered much of his power and to be maintaining an attitude of neutrality, only to a very moderate extent supplying Turkish needs. He protects the Sana Jews. The British prisoners are said to be all well, and not subjected to any special hardships. Husni Bey, who has arrived at Suda to be tried with Elias Bey («£&lt;? p. 480), is now said not to be the staff officer of that name, but the late 0.0. at Fiyush. Mohammed Yasir Muqbil, who has been dangerously ill, lias not gone to Suda yet, but has sent an agent to represent him at the Abu lias trial. Aden. On December 20 we sent out a strong reconnaissance through Jabir to Hatum, which the enemy occupied aftei our retirement, and which we then bombarded with good results. The Turks appear to have withdrawn their main lines to Bir Nasir Muqbil and Bir Amir, putting out strong patrols at Hatum, Jabir and Mahatt. Abyssinian Neivs. Events show that, for once, Abyssinian officials told the truth in declaring that Li] 4 asu was not dead. He has tinned up iu the Aussa country, a few days journey from Jibuti, with a following of about 150 men, and it is reported that his intention is to attempt to cross the railway eastwards in order to join the Mullah. Warnings have been sent to the Abyssinian, french and British authorities which it is hoped will result in this adventure being checked. The Sherifs Subsidy. About a half of the subsidy for the present month was sent to Sherifs Abdullah and Ali ; most of the remainder was allotted to Sherif Feisal for himself and Sherif Zeid, the King retaining only one tenth for expenses at Mecca and Jeddah. It was only found necessary to send an actual consignment of gold to Akaba for Sherifs Feisal and Zeid. Goldin the Hejaz usually finds its way to the merchants at Jeddah and has been used by them in the past to pay for their imports, which come mainly from India and partly from Egypt. Instead of having to send out the actual gold, an arrangement has been made toi the issue of drafts on the Bombay branch of the National Bank of India by Gellatly, Harikey and Co. at Jeddah. 1 he gold paid into the latter in exchange for these drafts is handed over to the British Agent at Jeddah and used for the next month s subsidy, thus being circulated in the Hejaz and not leaving it 1 he tnal adjustment is made between the Foreign Office and the Indian— 526 — Government, the latter recouping the Bank at Bombay. For Egypt a similar arrangement for drafts on the National Bank at Cairo has been made. Corrections. In our preceding issue, page 513, the suggestion that the gold looted from Suleiman liifada’s train was intended for the H.E.F. is less probable than that it was Secret Service money to be used by the two chiefs, and perhaps by Ibn Rashid also, in buying over tribes.

In conversation with Colonel Wilson and myself the Emir Abdullah on numerous occasions referred to our treaty obligations with Ibn Saud and the Idrisi which, he said, would always be fully upheld by his father and himself. He always spoke sincerely and gratefully about the help which he has received from the British Government, and of the assistance which he expected in the future in the moulding of the Arab race. He wishes to bring about unity and concord in the Arabian Peninsula by peaceful means, and considers that this can best be attained if the several principal chiefs are completely independent in their own dominions, on the proviso that they make some recognition of the suzerainty of the King of the Arabs. He said that the greatest handicaps in conducting the Arab revolt, leaving out of account the attitude of Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, had been the lack of trustworthy subordinates in the Arab ranks, which had thrust an unfair burden on the shoulders of the King and his four sons. It would be useless for the King to try and dominate the Peninsula by force with such lieutenants, even if he wished to, and he, personally, would like to .see a number of strong and friendly rulers, governing justly their subjects and acting fairly by their overlord. In this he shows a greater wisdom than his father, who, I suspect, would prefer a collection of puppet rulers with himself as the one strong man. In the remarks which follow, the Emir may seem to depart from this ideal, especially in his attitude towards Ibn Saud, but it must be remembered that, at the present time, relations between them are not far from the breaking point, and that he feels that he must make out the best case possible for his own side. It is quite probable that he does not himself believe all the charges which he has made, for he admitted getting most ot his information from certain border elements who were Wahhabis to Ibn Saud and Sunnis to him and who might be reaping an advantage by selling false information to both sides. He is merely carrying on the duel which began when his father originally claimed the Ateibah. He has gained ground during the last year by lavish gifts to their chief sheikhs, and Ibn Saud—having little money—has countered by intensifying his Wahhabi campaign. This has alarmed the Emir who^ is, perhaps, inclined to exaggerate his real feelings when speaking to us. But, strained though the situation is, it is not necessarily incapable of solution. I cannot speak of Ibn Saud but many conservations with the Emir convinced me that he will act fairly, if fairly met. He frequently referred to the responsibility which rested on the organisers of the Arab revolt, of making the countries more peaceful and prosperous than they had been undei 4— : , 1 ! — 10 — the rule o£ the Turks, and said that all their efforts would have been in vain if civil war followed on the removal of the restrain- ins: Ottoman hand. . As we have long suspected, he has ambitions towards seeing his father in the position of Caliph and feels strongly that the Arab nation will never advance until it has treed itself from t le religious domination of Constantinople. He fully realizes the obstacles in the way and is not at all inclined to rum the success of his scheme by any rash or premature action. 1. I bn Sand vis a vis the Turks and Hejaz Government. The Emir showed very plainly that he dislikes Ibn Sand and is profoundly distrustful of his intentions. His view was that Ibn Sand had, up to the presenb time, played a clever game which had been successful in deceiving us as to his real aims. He probably liked us, and he certainly disliked the Turks, but, in spite of that, he had realised that it was to his interest to keep in with them and the Rashid secretly, for, once they had disappeared from the Hejaz, King Husein would be the most powerful man in Arabia and his own schemes would be thwarted. This contingency was more to be feared by him than any danger from the English or the Turks. Basing his policy on these considerations, he had_ secretly squared Ibn Rashid and the Turks and then made his tieaty with us. What has been the result ? He had been consistently inactive, pleading lack of money and arms while all the time he was helping the enemy by allowing supplies to pass from the East to Hail. Emir Abdullah was certain that he was in direct communication with Fakhri Pasha at the present time, and under took to try and intercept his messengers as proof. He did not explain why he had not already done so. Ibn Sand had endeavoured to play the same game with King Husein as he had with us. East year he .had publicly alluded in the mosque at Bureidah to the Sherif’s revolt, hailing him as the saviour of the Arabs and exhorting everyone to join the Holy Cause against the Turks. Secretly, however, he had instigated his Imams to preach a counter propaganda. His letters to the King had throughout been extremely friendly in tone and well calculated to impress anyone who was not on his guard. They were all a part of his policy of deceit, but were partially inspired by fear. The crowning proof of Ibn Sand’s insincerity was contained in his replies to two letters which the Emir had sent him, the first in March 1917, and the second after Ibn Rashid had reached Medain Saleh. The Emir was unable to produce copies of these letters, but one morning wrote down, in the presence of Colonel Wilson and myself, the gist of the first. Its translation runs as follows :— “ Let it be known to my brother the Imam that I am here as one of the best allies [supporters] to him viz, in what would be in the interest and for the welfare of the Arab communityn __ 11 _ and for its prestige. From what I have experienced all this long time, I find I cannot help telling you frankly that the fact of your remaining in the ‘ Imara’ [Emirship, namely that you keep your post as Emir] of your Fathers and Forefathers is in dispensable to our cause [or interest]. We also wish that the family of Abdel Aziz ibn Abdel Rahman should be next to \ ou in authority [or it might mean succeed you] as this would ensure unity and exchanging friendly feelings between you and ourselves, as in this way the Arabs will become powerful and will be looked upon with respect [or awe]. I inform you that this idea is common among us, namely my Father and Brothers, and I am giving you this information in my capacity of being a member oAhe Royal Family, and as Foreign Minister to the Hashimite Government. . “ Therefore, be easy at mind and form your relations and interests with H.M. the King according to these communications.” [Note. Words in brackets are inserted by translator; original Arabic is rather obscure.] ’ The Emir stated that this letter was received with great pleasure by Ibn Sand, who read it aloud in his assembly and acknowledged it suitably, saying that he was the Kings servant and would give him all help in his power. On the strength of this statement and after Ibn Rashid s retreat to the railway, the Emir wrote the second letter to Ibn Sand saying that the moment for attacking Hail was favourable and inviting his co-operation. Ibn Sand acknowledged the receipt of this letter, but entirely ignored the proposal, merely making general enquiries about the Emir s health. At that time, said the Emir, Hail was entirely unprotected and its inhabitants and the neighbouring tribes bewildered and without a leader or a policy. With Sherifian l-lp ,t S Ml would have been a certainty and he could only conch.de that Ibn baud had some ulterior motive in refusing the offer He had sa nothing about the future possession of Hail but had been quite prepared to see it fall into Ibn Sand’s hands. 2 2. Ibn Saud and the Wahabi Danger. For several days after our arrival, the Emir professed to make light of this movement which, he said, had been dangerous two years ago but had since declined. On the arrival of the news of Sultan ibn Bijed's raid, however (see note m this Bulletin), he veered round and continued, during our stay, o emphasise its seriousness. He placed all the responsibility on Ibn Saud who, he said, was fanning the flame ol fanaticism to further his own ambitions. . The movement was a difficult one to counter, since all the central Hejaz tribes entered Ibn Sami's territory every year to net dates, and were there exposed to the full blast of W ahabi influence. Inducements to remain were offered to them, th 1 ■ ;l12 — shape of presents of rifles and money, and any who professed the Wahabi faith were given places in which to settle. Ibn Sand, not content with perverting visiting tribesmen, had sent preachers among the outlying tribal elements of the Hej az. Their methods were slow and insidious, and the rigour of their tenets appealed to the fanaticism which was latent amongst ignorant Bedu. There was only one way to treat such gentry, and that was to kill them, for they were undermining the religious foundations of the State. Colonel Wilson pointed out that the British Government would naturally do everything in its power to better the relations between Ibn Baud and the King, but that it had always been its policy to refuse to interfere in religious matters. The Emir replied that, if Ibn Sand could not be restrained with our help, the King and he would be bound eventually to take such steps as were necessary. No one was more anxious than himself that matters should be settled amicably, and he had even gone the length of suggesting that his brother Zeid should marry a girl of Ibn Baud’s family. (It will be remembered that the King claimed this as his own idea at Jeddah recently.) 3. Treaty and Tribal Rights. The Emir admitted that the three predecessors of Sherif Husein had relaxed their hereditary control over the eastern tribes and said that one of the first acts of the latter, on assuming office, had been to write to Ibn Baud reclaiming the ancient rights of the Sherifs of Mecca to the control of all the Ateibah and all the Harb. Ibn Baud had naturally resented this and had done his best to keep the tribes with him. He had been unsuccessful and the matter had been legalised by the Treaty of 1910. The Emir laid great stress on this Treaty, which he claimed to be still in operation. The main points, he said, were Ibn Baud’s recognition of Sherif Husein’s rights over the Ateibah and Qashn. Ibn Baud had agreed not to tax the Ateibah and that Qasim should pay a. yearly contribution of L.T. 4,000 to the Meccan Treasury. The Emir admitted that the latter had never exacted any payment from Qasim, but claimed that his father had been content with Ibn Baud’s admission of his rights. If Ibn Baud would abide by this treaty, there would be no future trouble and he intended at an early date to ask his father to guarantee officially to the British Government the future independence of Ibn Baud and his descendants within the boundaries and under the conditions laid down in it. This guarantee His Majesty’s Government would be asked to convey to Ibn Baud. Colonel Wilson asked for a copy of the Treaty which the Emir promised to obtain from Mecca. . I pointed out to the Emir that the Ateibah were numerous m JNejd, that they hold large stretches of grazing land and many wells and that it seemed hardly reasonable to expect that IbnSaud would he content with an arrangement which miodit cause him a great deal of trouble and from which lie would reap no benefit. The Emir replied that they would go to Ibn Saud on small matters but would have the right of ultimate appeal to the King. The distance between ISTejd and Mecca would prevent this from being used too frequently. He foresaw no difficulties; in his own phraseology, it would be as easy as drinking a glass of water. [Note. —It appears that the King does not share Abdullah’s views about this treaty for in an interview a few days ago with Commander Hogarth at Jeddah he described it as obsolete.] 4. The Idrisi. The Emir’s attitude about the Idrisi was more sympathetic than one would have expected. He recounted at great length the history of the Ebhah campaign and concluded by saying that he had been sorry for Idrisi’s downfall, for he had fought well against the Turks and his influence had been good. The Idrisi’s present inactivity he attributed either to a secret understanding with the Turks, or lack of power, or jealousy of the King. He had made a great mistake at the beginning of the Arab revolt by not sending an Emissary to Mecca with an offer of co-operation. The King had been annoyed by this omission, and his suspicions of the Idrisi’s intentions had led him to protest strongly when Idrisi troops occupied Kunfudah. The Emir thought that his father had made a mistake in this. At the present time, the Emir is reserving judgement. As soon as the situation permits, he intends to go to Mecca, study the whole question carefully with his father, and then probably move south with an army, at the same time inviting the co-operation of the Idrisi. This should put the sincerity of the latter to the proof. The Emir said that he wished to re-instate the House of Ibn Aidh in Jebel Asir itself {i.e., over the tribes of Beni Mugheid, Beni Malik, Alqam el-Hul and Rabia wa Rnfeida) but he saw no reason why the Idrisi should not expand to Kunfudah and the hill districts to the east—providing the tribes would accept him. Similarly, he might extend his dominions south to include Hodeidah. Everything depended on himself. If he acknowledged the King as his overlord, and helped him whole-heartedly against the Turks, he would reap his reward. From what he knew of him, he thought his co-operation not unlikely, and he was inclined to regard him as the most hopeful instrument of future Arab unity. 5 . The Imam. The Emir did not speak at great length about the Imam, but is evidently suspicious of his intentions. He said that when Medina had fallen, and he had realised that the Turks were in ahopeless case, the Imam would doubtless rise against them and establish himself in Sanaa. After that, he would probably try to win over the Sunni tribes and occupy Hodeidah. The Emir evidently has au eye on Yemen and said that he presumed that, since we had no treaty with the Imam, we would raise no objection to the King attacking him if he proved intractable. K.C. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. The civil population of Medina have for some months been in great distress through lack of food, housing and clothes. An Arab merchant named Hueit, who recently arrived from there at Yambo, reports that all who remained, numbering about 3 , 000 , had been turned out of the town without food or shelter, and were only able to purchase a few dates with difficulty. They had requested Fakhreddin to provide them wdth rations, but the Pasha replied that he could do nothing for them. There is much sickness due to hunger both among soldiers and civilians, and cholera, too, has appeared. Most of the garrison are said to be anxious to surrender, and, according to Hueit, openly expressed their intention of doing so at the first opportunity. They are all in rags, and rations consist almost entirely of lentils and dates. Bread is vcrv scarce, and an ardeb ( = 438 lbs.) of wheat or barley fetches L.T. 18. Last year’s date crop amounted to 27,000 ardebs, all of which has been stored. A small quantity of supplies is occasionally brought in by Arab traders, but Hueit believes that this does not amount to more than a camel load of sugar and tobacco per week. Other information shows that in the action at Jelajila (see Bulletin 7n, p. oOl), Fakhreddin withdrew most of his troops fiom the icmaining positions to reinforce Jelajila, even bringing sick men from the Medina hospitals, and that if the Arabs had simultaneously attacked other positions they might have penetrated the city. 1 I here have been persistent reports from the Hejaz that r akmeddin has been recalled and has left Medina, where his officeis tlneatened to murder him, but there is no confirmation of this news. Shei if Abdullah s plan of campaign, as agreed upon with Lolonel \\ ilson and Major Cornwallis (see last Bulletin) was to attack the line between Hediyah and Bueir with his main force, while Aziz Effendi operated in the neighbourhood of BirJedid, and Sherif AH attacked Bowat andHafira ; but as Abdullah has now gone north to Marebba, it is probable that this plan has been modified. His available force consists at present of about 7,000 Bedouin, three to four hundred trained Syrians, an Egyptian army detachment under Davenport Bey, and a trench detach ment under Captain Idaho. He has nine guns and sixteen machine guns. His principal commanders are Sherif Sharraf and Sherif Shaker. At the end of December the whole garrison of a Turkish post near Toweira, numbering sixty-two men, with a gun and a machine gun, surrendered to Abdullah. The post referred to is no doubt that of Khilis (see last Bulletin). According to reliable information from Akaba, the rams have done great damage to the railway south of Tebuk. The culverts over Wadi Akhdar and Wadi Ghudei aie believed to have been washed away, and no train had passed this sector for fifteen days. „ On January 1, British armoured cars, with halt a battery ot ten pounder guns, attacked a strong post seven miles north of Tel el-Shahim without definite result. Ihe guns then shelled Tel el-Shahim (about fift } 7 miles south of Maan), damaging the station and destroying some trucks. ihe cars advanced, unsupported by other troops, and completely silenced enemy resistance by machine gun fire. The ground is suitable for cars between Tel el-Shahim and Mudowara, but the line is defended by a series of small, strong _ posts on the neighbouring hnls. The Arabs contemplate operations in this sector ot the me. _ On January 4 , two of our aeroplanes bombarded the luikisn post at Uheida, about ten miles west of Maan, and the barracks and station buildings at Maan, where a direct hit was obtained on the power station. A Turkish aeroplane has crashed three miles east of Maan, the pilot and observer being killed. At the beginning of January Sherif Feisal’s army occupied Abu Lesal and Marigha (probably Maghaira on the 500,000 Maan sheet) while the Turks withdrew to a line covering Maan and stretching from Uheida to Semana (position uncertain). Sherif Nasir, with Abu Tugeiga and Bern Sakhr Arabs, then advanced on the Hishe Forest and Shobek, winch he occupied, apparently, without opposition. I he loss of Hrshe, which was the most important source of fuel supply for the Hejaz rai way, is a serious one for the enemy. Moving eastward from Shobe , Nasir’s forces attacked the railway and occupied Jauf el-Derwish station, thirty miles north of Maan, where a gun, two machine guns, some rolling stock and prisoners have been captured Che A r obs also took thirty prisoners at Kalaat Aneza stat . Another party under theGrab officer, Mowlud Elfend. is reported to be holding the bridges at Ghadir el-Haj, south of Maa . The Arabs west of the Dead Sea are well disposed towards the King of Hejaz, and it is expected that Sherif leisal will take steps to establish friendly relations with them.— 16 — f Later News .—In the raid on JauE el-Derwish reported above, Sheri 1* Nasir’s force killed eighty of the enemy and took 200 prisoners, including seven officers. 1 heir booty also included twenty-five mules, while rolling stock and two engines were damaged. Further operations in this area have been delayed by intense cold and heavy falls of snow and hail ; ten of the Arabs died from exposure on one day. On January 9, our aeroplanes again bombarded Maa.n station, where they dropped nearly half a ton of bombs. 1 he lurks have withdrawn from Uheida, and are holding a line three miles west of Maan, between Wadis Semna and Semana. Sherif Ali telegraphs that his troops have completely destroyed Misarbo bridge between Hafira and Bowat, and cut a kilometre of railway between Bowat and Bir Nasif. They are further reported to have attacked Kawil, near Hafira, where they killed seven men, four mules and three camels, and captured two mules and seven rifles. Misarbo and Kawil are both unidentified.] The Jtead Sea. The following information has been supplied by Fere Janssen, who is well acquainted with the country round the Dead Sea :— (a) The island and peninsula of Rujm el-Bahr, which are given on most of the maps of Palestine, no longer exist, having been covered by a rise in the water level. All boats plying in this part of the lake, and in the mouth of the Jordan, must be careful to avoid grounding there on the submerged Rujm el-Bahr Peninsula or on other mud banks. The name Rujm el-Bahr is given now to the coast near the former peninsula. (b) The winds rarely blow north or south on the Dead Sea. The prevailing wind is from the west, but in March heavy southerly gales are frequent. In heavy weather, when the wind is blowing from the west, shelter can be obtained by lying at a number of points on the west shore of the lake under shelter of the cliffs or steep mountain sides of the lake. There is a cove, into which boats can enter, at the mouth of the brook Kedron (Wadi el-Nar). This cove is good shelter when strong west winds are blowing. Shelter is usually obtainable on the eastern shore of the promontory of el-Lisan, but this is much exposed on the rare occasions when the wind blows from the north. (c) Roads near the Dead Sea .—From Ras Feshkhah, on the north-west coast of the Dead Sea, to Engeddi (Ain Jidy), the west coast of the Dead Sea offers no sort of thoroughfare, not even a mule track. I here is no long stretch of beach along which animals could move, and between such of the stretches as exist theie are successions of cliffs or steep hillsides running sheer into the water. From Engeddi to Jebel Usdum (Sodom) there is a track practicable for pack animals running alon 0- the beach. The track from Jerusalem to Engeddi, and part of the descent from Engeddi to the water, run through very broken— 17 country, and some of the descents cannot be negotiated by laden animals. Loads have to be man-handled over these places near the Dead Sea, and where the track descends to the beach the going is very bad. Pere Janssen states that he was only able to get pack horses down this stretch by putting horse blankets and mats on the slippery rocks, on which animals otherwise came to grief. South of Engeddi the beach track is quite possible for pack animals with their loads. The only difficult point is at Kalaat Umm Baghak. Here there are a number of boulders and large smooth stones on the track, but these could be removed in a few hours by a working party of a dozen men. After Jebel Usdom, the Nugb, or pass through which the track j)asses before entering the Grhor, is difficult, as it runs for some distance through a rock cutting only eight or nine feet wide. (c?) Pere Jaussen confirms the statement of other authorities to the effect that the Ghor is almost impossible for animals in winter owing, not to the depth of the marshes, but to the extreme slipperiness of the surface. To cross from the south west to the south-east side of the lake in winter, a detour is necessary following the southern edge ot: the Ghor. (&lt;?) The greater part of the eastern coast of the Dead Sea is impassable. The mountains of Moab fall very steeply into the water, and there are many stretches of cliffs. Part of the west coast of el-Lisan is also precipitous and unapproachable from the water.— 18 NOTES. Idrisi’s Campaign. The Idrisi’s tribal army, which appears to be continually increasing in numbers, began its advance southwards from the Beni Abs country on January 5. Che Turkish officials at Loheiyah are said to be removing their families and goods with a view to evacuating the town ; but the garrison, on the othei hand, is reported to have been doubled. 1 he Imam is taking precautions against a possible aggression on Idrisis part, and a report from Kameran states that 3,000 ol his troops, undei Abu Naib, arrived on the Beni Abs frontier at the end of December. Mustafa Idrisi, in a private letter from Aden, states that a battle took place on December 12 between the Idrisi forces and the Turks, in which the former killed fifty Turks including an officer, and themselves lost eleven men killed and seven wounded. Yemen. Mahmud Nedim Pasha, the Vali, has recently visited the Imam, probably in connection with the Abu Has murder trial. It appears that this case, of which so much has been heard during the last six months, has at last been settled by the payment of 28,000 dollars to the Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein by Sheikh Mohammed Hash* Muqbil. Mahmud Nedim is also reported to have arranged with the Imam that all the Turkish garrisons in the Highlands (see Bulletin No. 61), shall be released for service in the Tihama, their place being taken by Zeidi troops, whom the Imam is now collecting in southern Yemen. This tends to confirm the information furnished by the Jewish merchant from Sanaa, which was mentioned in the last Bulletin. The Imam’s attitude, however, is by no means clear, and it is believed by persons arriving at Aden from Dhamar and Yerim that he intends to attack the Turks in the event of their retreat from Lahej. This view is strengthened by the fact that Seyyid Mohammed Derwish (see Bulletin No. 56) has become his representative in the Riyashiyah district, but is at the same time operating against the Turks. The brother of Mohammed Derwish has been killed at Riyashiyah in a fight with the Turks and their adherents. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan (see Bulletin No. 61) appears to be on the move again. It is reported that he has with him a force of 2,000 men, and that an encounter took place with the Turks near Debhan in which nine Turks were killed. His son is said to have seized the Turkish magazine at Zebid and removed the arms and ammunition, and it is certain that disturbances are going on in that region. Aden. On January 5 we occupied Jabir and Hatum (see last Bulletin) with the^ object of disclosing the enemy’s position. At first, the opposition was slight, but afterwards the enemyopened heavy shell fire and delivered a determined attack, when our troops retired. Sharp fighting ensued, the enemy firing large quantities o£ ammunition. Our aeroplanes eo-operated effectively. Reports indicate that the losses o£ the enemy were heavy. Both Arabs and Turks are deserting frequently from Ali Said Pasha’s camp, where great uneasiness prevails. The efforts o£ the authorities to raise additional Arab levies have met with the scantiest success, and the neighbouring population anticipates a general Turkish retirement towards the Yemen in the near future. Abyssinia. A telegram from Adis Abeba states that Lij Yasu has appeared east of Dessie with a thousand men. This news must be an unpleasant surprise for the Abyssinian Ministers, who were recently of the opinion that the Prince was no longer capable of raising a following. The capture of Jerusalem has made a profound impression on the Abyssinians, who are gratified that the Holy City, where there is a community of Abyssinian monks, is now in the hands of a Christian power. Sultan ibn Bijad. Sultan ibn Bijad, who was converted some years ago to Wahabism, recently attacked Sheikh Bijad ibn Ommeyyad of the Ateibah, killed him and one or two of his clan, and capturec their flocks. Other Ateibah sheikhs sought redress from the Kins: of the Hejaz, and Emir Abdullah affected to regard the incident as part and parcel of Ibn Sand’s Wahabi movement. It is fairly certain, however, that it was nothing more than a tribal raid. Correction.

I saw King Husein for the first time on January 8 and between that date and January 14, when I left Jeddah, I had ten interviews with him, none lasting less than an hour and a half, and some over three hours. My mission was occasioned by the arrival of Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby, I.C.S., who had come overland from Riyadh to Jeddah by way of Dhrumah, Wadi Sbei, Khurmah and Taif, a new route of which it is hoped he will give a description in a later issue. With thirty-five Bedouins of Ibn Sand’s following, drawn from various tribes, he accomplished his remarkable journey in very fast time (twenty-one days riding) and without mishap of any kind. I was to confer with him, and between us we were to try to smooth over the difficulties which had arisen from time to time between King Husein and ibn Sand, whose confidence Mr. Philby had gained during his stay in Riyadh, and to secure a working arrangement between them in the interests of Arab Unity. I was commissioned further to inform the King about the intentions of the Allies regarding Palestine, and to arrange some minor matters about his representation on the London Arab-Jew-Armenian Committee, his Cairo Agency, etc. On the subject of Ibn Saud I found the King very impracticable. Mr. Philby’s unheralded appearance, out of the blue,” had (not unnaturally) irritated his susceptibilities. Mr Philby had come across under a mistaken belief that he would meet Mr. Storrs at Taif. Cairo did not know he was intending to come till he was well on his way and could, at the best, have given King Husein only a short week’s notice of his probable appearance at Taif. This was not, however, done, for fear he miuht be turned back and a worse complication ensue. Added to 'reasonable annoyance at this was the King s uneasiness about the impression which that arrival might make m view o Jemal Pasha’s recent imputation of annexationist designs to the Allies. What, he asked, would the people of the Holy Land think of an Englishman having come at his pleasure to lail and down to Jeddah ? Would not all say Hejaz was sold to the British Everyone knew about Mr. Philby : “ he had become like the sun in the sky !’ 7 Accordingly King Husein was in no mood to be conciliated with Ibn Saud, whom he fears as leader of a Revival Movement which is anti-Meccan, and hates for an irreconcileable obstacle to his Kingship of the Arabs—in his view the sole possible condition of Arab Unity. He brought up all Ins old charges of treachery against Ibn Sand, to wit (1) Correspondence v^th Fakhri Pasha; (2) Expedition of Turkish money to Yemen (3) Failure to push the campaign against Ibn Rashi 1 ti Oasim • and when confronted with Fakhri s own letters, entrusted by Ibn Sand to Mr Philby, in one of which Fakhri complains ot never receiving replies, thkKing refused to hear or read them.Protesting, however, {pro forma) his personal goodwill to b Sand and (con amove) his readiness to do anything Great Britain required of him, even to turning the other cheek, he rea i y agreed to keep the peace on his side, to maintain correct relations, to avoid such a contentious subject as suzerainty, and to recognize Ibn Sand’s right to deal with the Ateibah in his own territory. But his head, not his heart was convinced ; audit was doubtless no small satisfaction to him in the end to refuse Mi. Phi by permission to return through Hejaz to Taif, against which possibility he had already guarded himself by summoning the curavan. which been left there, to the inaccessible precincts of Mecca. On the other major points of my commission I found the King reasonable. He declared himself quite in sympathy with 5 both International Control in Palestine and the encourage ment of Jews to settle there, and he volunteered the remark that the course of the war must inevitably modify m ceitain points the agreements of the Allies with himself. He asked only to be informed frankly and fully of such proposed modifications and the reason of their necessity should it arise. But, of course, like everyone else, he is waiting on the progress of events and keeps certain reservations in his own mind. His faith in Great Britain’s power and good faith is unbounded and he places himself. unreservedly in her hands. She is “ the great sea in which I, the fish, swim,” said he, and “the larger the sea, the fatter the fish ” ! In indulging in “bluff” about his own influence and military power, and also about his local omniscience, he does but follow the lead of all belligerents. He is not in fact so sure of the security of his present position, of his future sphere, or of his ability to control the Arabian situation here, there and every where vi et armis, big as he talks of his sons and his Hejazi levies. Nor was I, for my part, so sure of his omniscience of Arab politics; and dark hints of trouble on the Gulf Coast, vague assertions about Rashid affairs, and nebulous views about the tribes on the Euphrates left me unimpressed,—the more, since I detected lapses of his memory about one or tw 7 o points of recent Hejaz history. King Husein brought up the subject of his title at every opportunity. As is well known, he signs himself “ King of the Arabs” or “the Arab Country” in communications with Arabs ; and his officers so describe him in official documents. But the Allies do not recognize the title, and he holds that it would make all the difference in the world if they did. He is more set on this recognition than on anything else. His argument is that exhortations to the Arabs to unite are empty words until one single personality be designated on whom they shall unite. He admits that Arabs as a whole have not asked him to be their King; but seeing how ignorant and disunited they are, how can this be expected of them until he is so called ? Which is amm 23 plain circular argument described about one point, but with some reason in it none the less. The Iving is sincere, 1 could see, in his Arab patriotism, but his personal attitude is genuine Old Whig. He desires with all his heart that his race should form a nation and be free and federated, but—under himself. He alone can direct its new destinies. His family is the noblest in Arabia; indeed he probably recognizes no other genuine Arab nobility than that of the Ilejaz ashrqf (see later p. 24). Who else, he asks, in Arabia, Syria or Iraq stands enough above his fellows to be King of the whole? Indeed, in Syria and Iraq who conceivably could be elected even to local sovereignty . I here is, in fact, no one. He said again and again that, if we think him unfit to be King of the Arabs, he will bow to our judgment; but then he must quit Hejaz and, functus officio, end his days m the shadow of our peace in Egypt. The one thing he cannot do is to remain a King under any other Arab Suzerain Mecca can never take second place. In this contention he floutsperhaps unwittingly, the lesson of a long history, which Seyyid I ah &gt;, oi one, could expound to him. He shows himself so open-eyed about the real capacity ot his race, and the level o£ political sense to which it has fallen, that, undoubtedly, he will accept for it, when the time comes, a measure of tutelage and protection far more drastic than the Syrian intellectuals will hear of. He says that he tells his people nothing of his plan for them in the future ; he has many things to sav unto them, but they cannot hear them now. So he halt shuts his eyes to much he knows, as well as we is amiss. But the time is near when he will begin to let out his message and to settle many accounts. Meanwhile he admits ere is murmuring against him in Mecca and Jeddah as well as else where • and he keeps a hand (not always a light one) on the curb. He rules virtually without Law ; tor his emasculate Sheria is of very narrow application ; and, m consequence, does many arbitrary things , 1 fome necessary enough some from imperfect knowledge and experience o ec01 * bottomless inevitable factors. Not unnaturally, m view of the botton .. demands of his ever shifting forces, his chief F eo ccupation is money ; and he conceives fantastic schemes for ^e'lmg his budo-et He wants trade to make reasonable profits but those refits to accrue to his Treasury ; and it is hard to persuade him that this result will only be obtained at the same moment as t c extinction of trade ! His main disability for good government land well he knows it) is lack of good subordinates. He has hardly a man of ability whom he can trust, let alone a man of any experience or knowledge of government, as this is understood in Europe. . r- o . • 7 This difficulty reappeared when the question o J delegate to the Lonhon ikbUew-Armenian Comm, tee came rq Ttip Kino - barred at the outset, any Syrian or Iraqi, and tnen had absolutely no’ one to nominate who could speak a Luropean r’-. /J i' 9 • 4— 24 — language passably. The King said he would never send anyone who had been mixed up with Turks and plainly hinted distrust, on that ground, of the existing members of the Committee in London. I gathered that he does not like the idea of any Committee of this sort dealing with his interests, and feels its independent uncontrolled action to be incompatible with his claim to be single and sole spokesman of the Arab Nation. On the other minor matters he made no difficulties. He was very cordial in manner even to Mr. Philby, whose advocacy of Ibn Sand roused him to considerable heat; and some plain words about our treaty obligations to Ibn Sand, which I said to him before taking leave on H.M.S. u Hardinge,” were well received, considering all things. He came off to the ship, inspected the crew, spoke to the Indian Moslem members of it, fired guns with his own hand at targets, smoked cigarettes (out of politeness, for he is a non-smoker), and tasted most of the various refreshments offered to him. He concluded the collation with mid-day prayer on the bridge, and then went off in a launch over two miles and more of very lumpy sea, of which he made light, as an old hand at sambnk sailing. He left the impression upon me of a very astute obstinate man, of quite exceptional physical vigour, keen intelligence, much courage, and sometimes surprising diplomatic sense and comprehension of outside affairs. He is born to rule, but, probably, not to rule much farther than his eyes can see. If he is ever to be King of an Arab Nation, that nation must be a federation of sovereign sta/tes with local autonomy so complete, that his shadowy suzerainty will stand simply for a symbol of unity and accord. J D.G.H. King Husein's Talk. In the course of the week spent in Jeddah I took occasion to elicit from King Husein information on various topics, of which some had but little relation to the objects of the mission confided to me. The King likes to talk at large about his country, its histon and the experiences of his own long life ; and encourage ment of this propensity made the obligatory daily calls upon him more pleasant and disposed him to be amenable about contentious matters. The following notes represent the information which he imparted on some of those topics. (a) Sherifs and Seyyids. TJ . This topic came up in response to a leading question about bin si s right to his title, Seyyid. The King replied evasively thatnt was not an Arab custom to enquire too closely into anv man s claim of descent; but he made his implication evident by going on to say that countless Moslems have assumed the title seyyza,. without warrant, and that, even among ashraf, only those ot Hejaz, whose families have remained there continuously from the I rophet s day, can prove their descent, It is the practice for;o —- the Hejaz sherifial clans to report births and deaths once a year at Mecca ; these are entered in the official register, which has been kept from time immemorial. Thus there can be no possible doubt about Hejaz sherifs. All sherifs are seyyids, but compara tively few seyyids are sherifs, since the latter are confined to direct descendants of the Prophet, whereas the former include those claiming descent from his agnates. The King spoke dubiously about the Yemen ashraf and scouted the idea that the present imam or any of the Qasim House had a connection with Hejaz ashraf. Among the latter only the descendants of Sherif Mohammed abu Numei are entitled, by custom, to the Emirate ; and the succession has in practice been further narrowed to the house of Barakat, which has parted into some five clans. The Asir Abadilah are an offshoot of the true Meccan clan, but number only some seventy families. The Juheinah owe their sherifial status to the settlement of Abu Talib on Jebel Rudhwah. (fb) Idrisi Family. I asked the King how the Idrisi family had come to super sede the Sherifs of Abu Arish. He replied that Sherif Ali ibn Husein, when driven out of the Yemen Tihamah in 1849 by a combination of the Turks and the Imam, lost everything and retired utterly impoverished to Mecca, where he died. But his family are still leading notables at Abu Arish. Incidentally, the King related a lively story of this Sherif Ali, who had been governor of Zahriyab, routing a Turkish force and killing a Governor, after stimulating a small body of a hundred and twenty horsemen with qat to semi-intoxication. The original Ahmed ibn Idris established himself as an alim at Sabbia in quite a small way, and his son and grandson were mere faqirs, who sat at the founder’s tomb and collected alms. _ The family acquired thus a certain amount of wealth. But its political importance dates only from the present Idrisi, who set up as a miracle-monger after his return from Egypt. I he Furks remained quite ignorant of his grovying power up to 1910, and he (King Husein), when asked, could tell them little beyond the fact of his existence. In the revolt of 1910, Idrisi was of much less account than the chief of the Beni Mugheid ; but the incompetence of the Turks in their campaign against the latter prevented them from proceeding to Sabbia after the relief of Ebhah. Thus Idrisi survived till, in the Italian war, he received large consignments of arms and money and became of serious local account. (c) The Asir Campaign of 1910. The Asir revolt, headed by the chief of the broke out when Abdullah Pasha was G.O.C. officer, though a Ferik, had been sent down to three taburs, because he had fallen out with the and he was put under a vali, Emin Bey, who Beni Mugheid, Hejaz. This command only Young Turks : had previouslyi — 26 — been superintendent ot Cnstoms at feamsui , and s still in Mecca as Mimster of Wafct. Emu ^sem, tnea to discourage the Turks from sending troops to Asn, but on Abdullah Pasha dying suddenly, Constantinople d^ e on an expedition, and he, the Emir, consented to co-opei«_ prevent it from doing more harm than necessai) to the • izzet Pasha came down to Jeddah with three troopships and fire French-speaking staff officers with moustaches turned up « « Kaiser On Ids invitation the Emir went down to Jeddah, though warned by the Meccans that Izzet’s intention was to seizeMbs person. However nothing of the sort happened t e Emir treated the staff with contempt; and he only advised Izzet in the interests of the Arabs. They went on together to Quntudah, where sixteen taburs were collected. 1 hese were put into camp at Joz, where they contracted cholera and could not move tor four months. Finally Feisal, whose relations with the urks were very indifferent (he shot one Turkish officer point-blank for incivility), had to do their work for them, and it was he who relieved Ebhah. The Emir urged Suleiman Pasha, who had taken the command, to proclaim an amnesty, but on this being referred to the Porte, the reply was that Suleiman must decide and not the Emir. Therefore the amnesty was never granted Had it not been for subsequent mistakes by the Beni Mugheid chief, the Turks would not have stayed in Ebhah ; but now they have managed to corrupt all the people of that neighbour hood and make them thoroughly bad Arabs. Izzet Pasha went on to the Yemen, where he brought about the entente with the Imam, having been persuaded by Emir Husein that this would prove m the long run far cheaper for the Turks than continued war and annual expedition of troops from C onstantinople. (d) Germans in Hejaz. Mr. Philby, while at Tail, was assured that a party of ten or twelve German officers had lived there before the war ; though, since they went out only by night, no one could say he had seen them. They made a practice, said the informants, of beginning music and uproar at the hour of evening prayer. I asked King Husein in general terms whether the Turks had brought Germans into Hejaz, and he replied that no German went inland except Oppenheim, who came down, in 1915, as far as Ayun outside Medina. A report of the fact reached Emir Husein in Mecca and he tackled Ghalib Pasha on the subject, but received a denial. He pressed the point, however, and Oppenheim was quietly sent north again, Ghalib continuing to deny his having arrived. He did not enter Medina. Oppenheim had met Sherif Husein when the latter was living at Stenia, on the Bosphorus, before 1908, and had tried to pump him about Hejaz, under cover of historical investigation. I asked specifically about Mecca and Taif, and the King denied that any Germans were ever there. As for Germans on the coast, he told me little that wasnew, except about a party, brought down early hi 1915 bygone of the Damascus Jezairis, a son of Abdul Qadir Pasha. 1 hey called at Jeddah and went on to Qunfudah, intending to sow mines in the Bab el-Mandeb straits, and cross to Somaliland ; but Husein warned Port Sudan. Afterwards he called their guide to Mecca and expostulated with him. About the “ Emden ” party, he told me only that it was he, who at Turkish request, arranged for their conveyance from Lith. Sherif Mohsin had told me previously that their subsequent assailants were Zobeid Harb, but not led by himself. He had gone to Mecca after sendiim out four scouts to meet and report on them. I hen report was not credited at first at Mecca ; but latei Sheiifs Abdullah and Zeid set out to the rescue. After Jeddah the survivors wished to continue by land, but Emir Husem dissuaded them and the Turks from the attempt. (e) Qasim Expedition of 1910. The orhhn of this was a meeting of chiefs attending the Pilgrimage m 1909. Emir Husein addressed them., pointing out the-absurdity of their submitting to exploitation by the Emirs of Neid and Jebel Shammar, and offering to protect their independence and that of the Qasim towns. They went away to refer the matter to the Paramount Chiefs of the Harb, Ateibah, Sbei and Muteir and to the Qasim notables, and returned after some months bringing the assent of all these. Huse.n subsequently went up to- Qasim with a small force o£ only 250 camehnen and 150 cavalry, and captured Saad, the brother of the Em.r of Ne]d The latter then agreed to an arrangement of which the chief terms were that the four tribes above named were to be tree of taxation by either Ibn Sand or Ibn Rashid, that the Qasim towns were to choose their own Emirs, and that they should, m any case, pay 3,000 medjidiehs each to Mecca. This last provision, however, had not been enforced. (/’) Natural History. The King talked at length on this subject, which is a favourite one with him, but said little that was new to me, except that, in buying camels, enquiry should always be made whether particular animals were reared in wooded districts , foi, it not, they will never browse off trees. They can, however, often be fed either with balls of tree shoots made up with water, or by shaking down the leaves of the wahat or trees, the came Is following the men so engaged from tree to tree. Even chopped up palm-fronds are use°d. Arabs trap coneys in steep-sided holes, covered with a thm screen of grass and sam. . g Kino himself had known an animal burrow its way out, helped by other coneys, opening a tunnel from the outside . D.CJ.H.— 23 — ARABIA. North-west. Intelligence. Colonel Joyce sends the following account of the attack on the line by armoured cars reported in the last Bulletin :— “ The cars left Grueira at 9 a.m. on December 30 and arrived at a point about twelve miles west of Mudowara by sundown. One stretch of about a mile of soft sand caused considerable delay ; otherwise the going was good. On December 31 a reconnaissance was made in a tender, and from observation it was decided that the route we were following would lead straight to Ramleh station, and in order to accomplish the objective it would be advisable to strike further north. Finally a road was found which emerged on to the railway line about four miles north of Tel el-Shahim station. “ On the morning of January 1 a reconnaissance was again made, on foot, which showed that the line between Tel el-Shahim and Wadi Rethm station was defended by three small entrenched posts, two on hill tops and one dug in near a large seven-arch culvert due east of our point of observation. Owing to the nature of the country it would have been impossible to approach the line in order to lay a mine without being observed, and as there were no Arabs co-operating, the idea of laying a mine had to be abandoned. It was accordingly decided to attack the entrenched post near the culvert above referred to. It was quite realised that it would be almost impossible to capture this post by armoured cars alone, but by attempting it, it was thought probable that other troops would be sent to reinforce, and these might prove a good objective for the machine guns of the armoured cars. “ The ten-pounder gun came into action at 1,500 yards from the position, having somewhat misjudged the distance. It came under a very hot rifle fire and had to be withdrawn after firing a few rounds. The armoured cars approached the post and fired several belts from their maxims into it at close range, but the numbers of casualties inflicted were not ascertain able. There was no way of enfilading the fort, and as no definite result could be obtained by maxim gun fire the cars were eventually withdrawn. A small party of the enemy arrived from the south in the meanwhile and occupied a hill about 800 yards west of the railway line. Two or three rounds from the ten- pounder mountain gun soon dislodged them. “Two armoured cars escorting the ten-pounder mountain gun then proceeded to Tel el-Shahim station, and the mountain gun fired about thirty rounds high explosive with good results. Station buildings were hit, and trucks standing in the station were destroyed. The armoured cars approached the station and fired on the windows, doors, etc., of the building and completely silenced all enemy resistance from this point. The cars contain4 . \ V (&amp;&gt; 1 — 29 ~ such small crews that it was impracticable for them to leave the cars and endeavour to capture the station. The garrison had retreated to a probably entrenched position east of the station. The co-operation of other troops would be necessary to accomplish the capture of posts of this kind. “ The arrival of armoured cars on the railway line was undoubtedly a surprise to the Turks ; although the cars have been for nine months in the Hejaz, this was the first occasion on which they got within effective range of the line. The results of the reconnaissance were satisfactory, and future operations should produce more definite results. The country has not previously been reconnoitred, and although the surface is fairly u-ood there are water courses and other features to be negotiated which render freedom of movement for cars difficult until they become acquainted with the country. The reconnaissance obviously disorganised traffic arrangements, and as far as could be ascertained no trains passed on December 31 and January 1. One engine and a truck were proceeding from north to south and on hearing the bombardment at Tel el-Shahnn returned northwards again.” r . . T Writing from Akaba under date January o, Colonel Joyce stated that Slier if Mastur, with a large force of Bedouins, was then at Wadi Iftan (about twenty miles south of the Dead Sea) with Tafila for his objective. Sheikh Diab el-Amran, the chief sheikh of Tafila, had written to Sherif keisal informing him that on the arrival of a Sherif, Tafila would be handed over, but expressing a hope that the place would not be captured eithei by the Ibn Jazi or the Abu Tayyi Huweitat. The force under Sherif Nasir, whose successes were recorded in the last Bulletin, consisted of Bern Sakhr, Abu layyi, and about 300 mounted regulars with a gun and machine guns. As regards the railway in the Tebuk area, Colonel Joyce writes : “ The floods south of Tebuk have evidently very seriously damaged the railway line. Sheikh Mohammed el-&amp;ha S1 b amved here yesterday. He has been m that d.stnct for nearly a month and in close observation of the railway line, and he definitely assures me that no trains have passed either north or south lor a period of sixteen days prior to Ins leaving that sector. 1 he hoods have come down, and all culverts from Wadi Ghudei to Wadi el- Akhdar have been washed away. These are obviously the culverts which had previously been destroyed by dynamite, and which, instead of re-building, the Turks merely filled up temporarily Sa’ad Sikini, the Ageyl who destroyed a tram and killed Suleiman Pasha ibn Rifada, has arrived in Akaba and has furnished me with the following details. His demolition ta was only a small one, and they had to wait five days for the arrival of a train. One train from south to north P^sed duiii this interval, but that day they were engaged ,« tribal ^ and were unable to dynamite it. I he tram they eventually destroyed was proceeding from north to south and contained ten— 30 carriages. The contents of the train were flour, foodstuffs a truck of horses, about fifteen Turkish officers who were proceed ing to Tebuk to relieve the officers there, and one carriage containing Suleiman ibn Rif ad a and his staff. The engine was completely destroyed by the explosion, but the Arabs were disturbed in their looting operations by the arrival of Turkish reinforcements. They, however, succeeded in capturing L T 24 000 in gold and five horses, and destroyed a considerable amount of foodstuffs. Five Turkish officers were killed, and Suleiman ibn Rifada and several of his staff. 1 he remainder ot the people on the train made good their escape in the melee. Sherif Mohammed Ali and a section of the Beni Atiyah, and with them Captain Pisani and a French section, are at Um Shatia, and are continuing the operations against the railway line commenced bv the armoured cars on January 1. Sherif Zeid left Akaba on January 5, and will probably be sent north by Sherif Feisal. Sheikh Yusuf Khosherim is representing the Sherifian authorities in Akaba during the absence of both Emirs,” The Arabs have now occupied Tafila (twenty miles north of Shobek) and captured the whole garrison of eighty Turks. Sherif Nasir withdrew from Jurf (wrongly called Jauf on our maps) el-Derwish after a few days’ occupation and his Huweitat have gone to the wells east of that place. It is reported that 300 Turks have arrived at el-Hasa from the north. We now learn that severe fighting took place at the Hishe railhead before the 'Turks, numbering some 000, withdrew to Kalaat el-Aneizeh. Sherif Abdullah, influenced by certain of his Syrian officers, has recently shown some reluctance to undertake any serious operations against the railway. According to deserters’ information, there is a plentiful supply of wood near the line both north and south of el-Ula, and several large wood-cutting parties are continually at work, especially at a place three stations south of Medain Saleh. The garrison of the latter place is reported to consist of 500 men with four Mantelli guns. Captain Depui, the French officer with Sherif Ali, reports that an Arab patrol of Masruh Harb stopped a lorry containing five Turks near a post called Suluj, about ten miles north-west of Medina. The Turks were killed, and rifles, equipment and ammunition Avere taken. On the arrival of reinforcements the Arabs retired on Dersiya, three miles south-east of Muheit station. Another party of Sherif All’s Arabs recently attacked a Turkish convoy eight miles east of Medina on the Shakra road. The convoy surrendered after a stiff fight, and the booty is saidto have included forty-five camels, forty-five goods, 160 sheep and ninety loads of bread. Deserters from the Hejaz Expeditionary Force continue to come in, and all agree that great damage has been done to the line-in this area. The railway bridge at Hadiyah is reported to have been washed away. NOTES. Akhwan Converts. Among the recent converts to the Akhwan sect are leisal, Watban and Lafi, of the Dueish section of the Ateibah Parts of the Doshan got religion some months ago. Feisal became converted shortly after he had left Sidi Abdullah s camp. He has already sold off his camels, and assumed the white imama. It is thought that he will settle in Dukhna, the Akhwan village shared by the Ateibah and Harb, but Simian and Dahana are other Dueish Akhwan colonies, and he might prefer either of these Of the Hejna Atban, Sheikhs Nijr and furki have gone over to the new Wahabi movement, with Bijad abu Khusheim. Ghalib and Ali el-Himerzi, Naif el-Jithami and Naif el-Kueis are also converts, while Mohammed ibn Hindi is suspected. Ibn Shleiwi has refused to have anything to do with it. _ The converted Muteir are mostly living at Artawiya, wnici seems likely to become one of the headquarters of the militant Akhwan. Ibn Skeiyan, Mohammed el-Hawamil, ^ be l ha . 11 . f' Lafi Azeir el-Sfeini (of the Hawamil), ibn Sbeiyil of Athla, Mohammed el-Mizeini (of el-Gereiyat) and Mohammed ibn Mrjal of Nifi are prominent Muteiri converts. i c u Of the Harb, Nahis and Feisal el-Dhueibi, Dhaar el-Saada, Zeid el-Hilali and Thellab ibn Ali are adherents. Some ol the Furm sub-chiefs are rumoured to have joined. All the above have been converted since 1914. 1 .It. L. West of the Dead Sea. In the early part of the month, Arabs reported that there was a Turkish force of 500 to 1,000 men with machine guns and 400 horses, about ten miles south-east of Jerusalem It was accompanied by the German, Fritz Franck and its intention was to attack Deir'ibn Obeid, six miles east of Bethlehem. C e‘ ta '“ of the Ibadiah and Sawahiret el-Wad tribes were said to be assisting the enemy. Up to the present, no confirmation of this report has been received.Anti-British Propaganda. It is reported from Geneva that the ex-Khedive has received 2 , 000,000 francs for carrying on anti-British propaganda in Egypt and Arabia. Many prominent Egyptians in Europe are being summoned to Constantinople to assist in this movement. The letter from Jemal Pasha to King Husein [see Bulletin No. 74 ) has become known in Sherif Abdullah’s camp, where it has created considerable stir, and there are those among his followers who will use it in the interests of Turkish propaganda. It is reported from Mecca that there is a coterie there, including several of the local notables, who are strong supporters of the claims of Sherif AH Haidar, the Turkish nominee for the Emirate. Speech by Ahmed Jemal Pasha. Ahmed Jemal Pasha is reported to have made an anti- German speech at Beirut early in December 1917. The Turks, he said, had entered the war to rid themselves of interference by Europeans, but the result had been that they had handed them selves over to the Germans, a savage race, worse than the British, between whom and the Turks there could be nothing but mutual hatred. He himself was accused by them of being the cause of the rupture between Turks and Arabs. Aden. AH Said Pasha’s force, at and near Lahej, was estimated on December 8 at 1,790 men, with twenty-six guns and four machine guns. This force includes about 200 Somalis, some of whom are believed to have come across from Somaliland recently. About fifty camel loads of gun ammunition are known to have reached Lahej from the Yemen during December. In the fighting on December 20 {see p. 7) the reported Turkish losses were three officers and twelve men killed and about forty-five wounded. IdrisVs Campaign. On the 17th instant, after a preliminary bombardment by H.M.S. “Iox, Idrisi’s troops attacked Atan near Loheiyah. The attack was at first unsuccessful, but Aden reports that it was about to be renewed. Correction.

In the following report, dated Zilfi, October 27, 1917, Lient- Colonel Hamilton gives further details of his journey to Nejd (see Bulletin 73). “ I left Kuweit on the evening of October 9, after saying goodbye to Sheikh Salim at his palace at 4.30 p.m. Our first camp was at Sirrah wells about two hours distant from Kuweit. My .party consisted of the Agency Arabic writer, Khan Sahib Mulla Abdullah ibn Abdulillah, and the camel escort under Abdul Aziz ibn Hassun with five Bedouin rafiqs and three camel drivers. For additional security Sheikh Salim provided me with six rafiqs from his own Bedouin guard. I took with me a Portuguese lad of sixteen years of age, one of my boatmen, Ali, and a negro sent by the Sheikh of Muhammarah. We were a party, therefore, of twenty souls, and had with us thirty-one riding camels, thirteen of which were lent by His Excellency the Sheikh of Kuweit. The party was on the same scale as that which I arranged for Mr. Storrs in June last and was, I consider, a model in size and composition ; in size because it was strong enough to repel small gangs of marauders, and in composition because composed of rafiqs from the tribes of Ajman (two sections), Shammar (two sections), Dhafir Muteir (two sections) and Anazah. We were somewhat delayed by the Shakra caravan, which Sheikh Salim wished us to go along with as far as Safah, and we did not leave Suleibiyah, thirty-four miles from Kuweit on the boundary of the Sheikh’s territory, until October 13. The pace of the caravan was so slow that I decided to leave it, and we made for the wells of A1 Qara’ah which we reached on October 17 at about 9.15 a.m. This march from Suleibiyah should not take more than four days for a good-moving party with baggage, and we were greatly delayed by trying to keep in touch with the Shakra caravan. At Qara’ah, and camps between it and the Safah wells, were about 300 Shammar tents under Idhar ibn Radhi, a young man of about twenty-seven years of age, who came m to see us while we were resting under canvas during the middle hours ot the day before we reached the wells. Ajman and Shammar are now camping between Zubeir, Jahrah, Kuweit and up to the edge of the Qasim Dahanah, where the Muteir are concentrated. Alder halting practically two days at Qara’ah to rest the camels we marched to Gayyiyah wells on the early mornnig ot October 23, the fifth day out from the last camping place _ Here we were met by Watban el-Dawish (of the Muteir), his son, Riddan, and his cousin, Mohammed ibn Fahad el-Askar. We were anxious to cut short our stay at Gayyiyah hearing that Feisal el-Dawish, head of all the Muteir, was at Artawiyah and had joined the Wahabi brotherhood, called Ikhwan. Artawiyah is a hotbed of Mohammedan bigotry just now, and there is nolove lost between these Ibmtans and aii} (A the “j oie ^ civilized folk who inhabit Kuweit and Basrah. The P la ^ ^ of Metawwa, or overseers, who punish offences of a le nature such as slackness in attending prayers, and even smoking tobacco, by thrashing the delinquents. . , ., While talking to Watban, his cousin Mohammed ibn rahad el-Ashar repeatedly smote the ground, boasting of the importance of the Muteir. He said there were 35,000 people m Artawiyah ‘ yes bv God, and more’—while Watban remarked, and God mant that this (settlement) may advance the Faith —so we may Take it that the Muteir are going m hot and strong for this revivalist movement. As we left Gayyiyah, our party, one and all, including the Muteir rafiqs, the greatest smokers amongst us, cursed Artawiyah and all connected with the place. We reached Zilfi without further incident ]ust before mid day on October 25. We were well received by the Emir Osman el-Mohammed, with whom we dined. Next day we visited both towns of Zilfi, the old and the new. They are separated by a distance of just under two miles. The inhabitants of ilti appear to be'friendly, but here, as elsewhere in Nejd, so 1 am told, there is a large and increasing number of Ikhwan. I sent a camel rider to Bureidah, with one of the Emir of Zilti s sons, taking a letter to Turki ibn Saud announcing my arrival here and intended journey to see him at Bureidah.” Colonel Hamilton’s account of Artawiyah is confirmed by Sheikh Feisal ibn Ferhan el-Jerba, of the Northern Shammar, who passed through Artawiyah on his way from Riyadh to Kuweit. Sheikh Feisal, who was returning from a visit to the Sherif, arrived in Baghdad at the beginning of November. He states that Feisal el-Dawish has built himself a large qasr at Artawiyah and that his example has been followed by several minor sheikhs. A numerous colony is established round the wells, the water of which is sufficiently plentiful to admit of cultivation being carried on. Feisal el-Jerba had no sympathy with the stringency of Wahabi regulations touching tobacco, but as a good Mohammedan he felt obliged to testify to the punctual attendance at prayers on the part of the community. It was clear, however, that he had not enjoyed his stay at Artawiyah, nor does he feel any love for the Muteir who looted him west of Rass, on his way from Mecca to Riyadh. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Operations. Maan was bombed by two aeroplanes on January 25, several direct hits being obtained on the station and considerable damage being done to buildings and rolling stock. A few miles w r est ofMaan the aeroplanes observed about 200 Turkish cavalry and scattered them with machine gun fire. On the following day the Turks made a reconnaissance in force against Ain llheida {see p. 16) which the Arabs had occupied a few days before. The enemy employed cavalry and a mountain gun, but were repulsed by the Sherifian garrison and retired on Maan. Sherif Zeid, meanwhile, had arrived at Tafila, having orders from Sherif Feisal to push on to Kerak with the least possible delay. Sherif Nasir, Jaafar Pasha and Mulud Effendi were also in the neighbourhood. Tafila had surrendered on the loth after a little fighting, and the number of Turks captured there was 150 (not eighty, as reported in the last Bulletin). Major Lawrence, writing from there on the 22 nd, reported that the inhabitants were divided into two hostile factions, who were much afraid of each other, and there was shooting in the streets every night. Flour and barley were very dear and difficult to find, and there was a serious lack of mules and camels. The Sherifian officers, however, were arranging to police the town and organize supplies. The situation was complicated by the presence of a colony of Moors, who had been besieged by the Arabs, and a party of seventeen destitute but, apparently, well fed Armenians. A force of local Arabs, under Sherif Abdullah el-fiaiz and Hamud es-Sufi, of the Terabin, (adds Major Lawrence) had gone to Mezraa, on the Dead Sea, to block any leakage of supplies westwards from Kerak ; while Sherif Mastur was going northward to Seil el-Hesa, about half-way between Kerak and Tafila. Letters had been sent to the Kerak Arabs, whose attitude^ was doubtful. Rifaifan, the head of the Mujaliyah, was believed to be pfo-Turkish, but Husein el-Lura, the other leading sheikh, was secretly pro- Sherifian. News has since been received of the occupation of Mezraa by the Arabs, who captured sixty prisoners, including two officers, and burnt a launch and six sailing boats. On January 26 a large force of Turks from Kerak attacked the Arabs at Seil el-Hesa, where severe fighting took place. This resulted in a brilliant victory for the Arabs, who killed 500 of the enemy and captured 250, including Hamid Bey, O.C. 48th Division. Only about fifty Turks escaped in the direction of Kerak and all officers were killed or captured. The booty consisted of two powerful Austrian mountain guns nine automatic rifles, twenty-three machine guns (including fifteen German Maxim machine guns) and 800 rifles. About ^00 mules and horses were also taken and distributed among the Bedouin.

The Arabs, whose casualties were light, remained concentrated in the vicinity. (b) Southern Area,—On January 20 Sherif Abdullah carried out a successful operation against the railway m the neighbourhood of Wagir, between Hadiyah and Jedaha, 1 he Arabs destroyed eight and a half kilometres of hue and nineteen culverts. They bombarded Wagir all day, but were themselves attacked on both flanks by Turkish infantry and artillery. A field gun fired on them from Hadiyah, and two mountain guns arrived from that direction, while from the south came 400 infantry sixty Camel Corps, four mountain guns and .some machine guns. Major Davenport telegraphs that the Arabs stood the shelling well, but their casualties were slight and they had no killed. ° The Turks had fifty to seventy casualties and lost nine horses. Three Turkish prisoners were brought in. On January 30 it was reported that the line was still unrepaired, and mine-parties were waiting for repaii tiains both north and south of the break. On the 31st a trench party mined a repair train, carrying rails and wood, between Ahu Naam and Istabl Antar. Two engines, a tender and three wagons were completely wrecked. General, Sherif Feisal’s army includes about 3,000 trained Arab troops, thirteen guns and twenty-five machine guns. With Sherif Abdullah are 450 trained troops, four guns and six machine guns. Captain Depui reports that Fakhreddin Pasha intends, if he is compelled to evacuate Medina, to withdraw by the Hail road ; and that most of the dates which were stored at Medina have been sent to Syria with a view to evacuation. . The latter statement is denied from other sources. ^Later News. —East of Kalaat Aneizah the Arabs have brought down an enemy aeroplane and captured the pilot. The Arab garrisons at Delaglia and Wadi Musa have been moved nearer Maan, to Mreigha and Ain Busta respectively.Ihe break in the line between Hadiyah and Jedaha, reported above, has now been repaired, but very badly owing to shortage o£ nuts and other material. Sherif Abdullah has again attacked the railway south of Hadiyah, and reports that 3,000 rails and seven culverts were destroyed ; twenty of the enemy were killed and thirty captured.] NOTES. The Ansariyah. It is reported that the Mutessarif of Latakia, Reshid Talih Bey, left for Jebele on January 4 with 100 gendarmes and proceeded thence to Kerdaha. Here he collected 200 Kalbieh volunteers and set out to punish the Karahla tribe {see 1917 Bulletins, p. 341) who have revolted and are harbouring deserters and criminals. The expedition does not appear to have been successful. Aden. The Fadli Sultan, Husein ibn Ahmed, has written to Aden expressing his readiness to meet Major Reilly at Shukra or elsewhere, and asking that a doctor may be sent to him as he is very old and sick. This letter indicates a marked change of attitude on the Sultan’s part {see Bulletin 56, p. 305.) The Arab levies are said to be deserting from Ali Said Pasha’s army. According to reports reaching Aden from the Yemen, Mahmud Nadim Pasha is coming down to Lahej. Yemen. A force of about 1,000 Zeidis has reached Ibb from the North, accompanied, according to rumour, by the Imam s son. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan (of Mirab), in a letter to the Aden Resident, states that the Imam is secretly assisting the anti- Turkish movement, and has sent this force to co-operate with the British when the latter attacked Lahej. ft is reported fiom Kamaran, however {a) that he has recently supplied the Turks with ammunition, and ( 5 ) that he has suggested to ihe Yali that they should evacuate the Yemen and retire to Medina, and has offered to assist them in doing so. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan reports that Yahya ibn Yanya esh-Shaif has made his peace with the Vali, who has paid him large sums of money ; but we have no confirmation of this from other sources. I dr is is Campaign. According to information supplied by H.M.S. “Fox,” Nasir ibn Mabkhut arrived at Idrisi’s camp at Midi on January 9, and was placed in command of one half of the army. At that time the main Turkish force in the neighbourhood of Loheiyah was at Zahirah, about eight miles inland. On the 11 th the coastal— ?&gt;8 — portion of the Arab army, under a Shenf Hassan, was moving southwards to Dhabir, twelve miles north-east of Loheiyah. On the 13th and 14th the “Fox” bombarded Atan, a lurkish post some miles inland from Loheiyah, and commanding the water supply of that place. Encouraged by this bombardment, the Arabs, who had hitherto shown a disinclination to advance, attacked Atan on the loth, but in a half-hearted manner and without success. Ihe “Fox” bombarded the post again on the 16th and 17th, and some skirmishing took place on shore, in which the Turks are said to have had fifteen men killed. The enemy, however, had strongly fortified themselves in Atan, and held a line of communication between Atan and /ahirah, which was the main depot for Turkish supplies. The Arabs, meanwhile, were complaining of lack of food and ammunition. The organization was undoubtedly bad, and while the sheikhs themselves were loyal to Idrisi, their men were said to be deserting in considerable numbers. Idrisi, however, was still hopeful, and on the 23rd his army again moved southwards. Nasir ibn Mabkhut marched from Gauda to a point south-east of Atan, cutting the line of communication with Zahirah. The local sheikhs, of the Beni Jami and other tribes, were now coming in to join Idrisi and bringing hostages, and Sheikh Osman, one of the leading men of Loheiyah, expressed his willingness to assist the invaders. He reported that the Turks were anxious to evacuate Atan, and were endeavouring to obtain camels for that purpose. On the 26th considerable fighting, in which the Arabs were successful, took place in the neighbourhood. Thirty-three Turks and only five of Idrisi’s men are reported to have been killed. There is still a strong force of Turks under Ghalib Bey in the Beni Abs country, where Sheikh Mohammed Tahar is Idrisi’s commander. Idrisi himself was still at Midi at the end of January. The Governor of Hodeidah has recently paid a visit to this front, where the Turks are well supplied with ammunition. The Situation at Hail. According to the statement of a deserter, there are no Turkish troops at Hail at present, and the town, which has five gates, is practically undefended with the exception of a delapidated wall on the north and east. The population numbers 5,000 to 6 , 000 , and some of the 10,000 rifles supplied by the Turks have been issued to them. They donotlike either the Turks or the Emir, but they fear the latter. Politically, they would follow the lead of the Shammar, who are said to be going over freely from Rashid to Ibn Saud. The latter is believed by the people of Hail to be in league with King Husein, and, according to informant, no supplies are reaching there from Kasim or Koweit, nor are any sent thence to Syria. During the Emir’s absence from Hail, his representative there is his slave, Said ibn Mohammed.— 39 Abyssinia. According to a despatch' from Adis Abeba, dated January 10 , Lij Yasu made his reappearance at Kabue near Batye, south east of Dessie, with a thousand men. Troops were being despatched northwards under minor officers, but Kas Kassa, the new Govenor of Dessie, bad apparently no intention of leaving the capital himself. It is hardly likely that Lij Yasu can raise any large following in the Wollo country, which was so recently laid waste by the Government troops (see Bulletin No. 66 ) but reports from Dessie indicate that very little loyalty to Ras Taffari exists, even among the army of occupation. In the smaller provinces lying between Wollo and Tigre, it appears that the inhabitants are engaged in setting up republics and electing presidents, and have abandoned the practice of appealing for justice in the name of Menelik, Zauditu or the local Ras. Ras Wolye of Edju complains that it is useless to give orders as they are not obeyed. Dejaz Kassa, the son of Ras Seyum, is in revolt against his father, who is still at Adis Abeba (see Bulletin No. 62, p. 376). Fighting has taken place in Tigre between Dejaz Kassa and his uncle, in which the former is believed to have been successful.SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN. No. 79.SECRET. Arab bureau.

Major Lawrence writes from Tafila under date January 26 : u A Turkish temporary regiment, commanded by Hamid Fakhri Bey, acting G-.O.C. 48th Division, and composed of 3/151, 1/152, a murettab battalion of 150, with a company of gendarmes, a detachment of 100 cavalry, two Austrian quick- firing mountain guns, and twenty-three machine guns, was railed to Kalaat el-Hasa station on January 19, and left Kerak on January 23 to retake Tafila. The troops had been hurriedly collected from the Hauran and Amman commands, and came forward from Kerak short of supplies, and leaving no food and few men there. On January 24, they came in contact in the afternoon with our patrols in Seil el-Hasa, and by night had driven them back into Tafila. The Sherifian officers had laid out a defensive position on the south bank of the great valley in which Tafila stands, and Sherif Zeid left for this about midnight, taking with him the sixty regulars and 400 irregulars (.Ageyl, Bisha, Muteir) who had come with him from Akaba. The Sherifian baggage marched away at the same time towards Buseira, and everybody thought that we were running away. I think we were. Tafila of course panicked, and as Diab el-Auran (the busy bodied sheikh) had given us ominous reports of the disaffection and treachery of the villagers, I went down from my house before dawn into the crowded streets, to listen to what was being said. There was much free criticism of the Sherif, distinctly dis respectful, but no disloyalty. Everyone was screaming with terror, goods were being bundled out of the houses into the streets, which were packed with women and men. Mounted Arabs were galloping up and down, firing wildly into the air, and the flashes of the Turkish rifles were outlining the further cliffs of the Tafila gorge. Just at dawn the enemy bullets began to fall in the olive gardens, and I went out to Sherit Zeid and persuaded him to send Abdullah Effendi (the machine gunner and the junior of our two officers) with two fusils mitrailleurs to support the peasants who were still holding the northern crest His arrival stimulated them to a counter-attack m which they'drove the Turkish cavalry back over the near ridge, across a small plain to the first of the low ridges falling into Wadi el-Hasa. He took this ridge also, and was there held up, as the Turkish main body was posted just behind it. ihe fighting became very hot, with huge bursts of Turkish machine-gun hie and a good deal of shelling. Zeid hesitated to send forward reinforcements, so 1 went up to Abdullah’s position (about seven miles north of lahla) to report. On my way I met him returning, having had five men killed and one gun put out of action, and haying finished his ammunition. We sent back urgent messages to Zeid to send forward a mountain gun, any available machine guns, and what— 42 men he could collect, to a reserve position, which was the southern end o£ the little plain between the Hasa valley and the Tafila valley. This plain is triangular, about two miles each way. The opening lay to the north, and was a low pass, through which the Kerak road ran, and up which the Turks were coming. The sides of the triangle were low ridges, and Abdullah’s charge had taken all the western ridge. After Abdullah had gone I went up to the front, and found things rather difficult. It was being held by thirty Jbn Jazi Howeitat, mounted, and about thirty villagers. The Turks were working through the pass, and along the eastern boundary ridge of the plain, and concentrating the fire of about fifteen machine guns on the face and Hank of the rather obvious little mound we were holding. They were meanwhile correcting the fusing of their shrapnel, which had been grazing the hill-top and bursting over the plain, and were beginning to sprinkle the sides and top of the hill quite freely. Our people were short of ammunition, and the loss of the position was obviously only a matter of minutes. A Turkish aeroplane came up and did not improve our chances. 'Hie Motalga horsemen were given all the cartridges we could collect, and the footmen ran back over the plain. I was among them, since 1 had come straight up the cliffs from Tafila, and my animals had not caught me up. The mounted men held out for fifteen minutes more, and then galloped back to us unhurt. We collected in the reserve position, a ridge about sixty feet high, commanding an excellent view of the plain. It was now noon, we had lost about fifteen men and had about eighty left, but a few minutes later about 120 Ageyl came up, and my men with a Hotchkiss automatic, and Lutfi el-Aseli with two. We then held our own easily till H p.m. when Sherifs Zeid and Mastur came up with Kasim and Abdullah, one Egyptian army 2-95 mountain gun, two \ ickers, two large Hotchkiss, and five fusils mitrailleurs, with twenty mule M.I., thirty Motalga horse, and about 200 \ illagers. 1 he I urks were trying to shell and machine- gun our ridge, but found difficulty ' in' ranging. They had occupied our old front line, and we had its range (d ,100 yards) exactly, as I had paced it on my way back (this mountain country is very difficult to judge by eye). We mounted all our matenals on our ridge, and Rasim took all the mounted men (now about eighty) to the right, to work up beyond the eastern loundaiy ridge. He was able to get forward unseen, till he had turned the Turkish Hank at 2,000 yards. He there made a dismounted attack of ten men and faxe fusils mitrailleurs. keeping his horse in reserve. Meanwhile the Turks had just five Maxims and tour automatics on the western ridge of the pass, and opened on our centre. We replied with Vickers and Hotchkiss, and put' twenty-two rounds of shrapnel over the face of the mound A reinforcement of 100 men from Aima now reached us (they had refused Shenfian service the day before over a question of wages, but sunk old scores m the crisis), and we sent them, withSMMtfttllMi _ 43 __ three Hotchkiss automatics, to our left flank. They crept down behind the western ridge of the plain till within 200 yards of the Turkish Maxims, without being seen, as we opened across the plain a frontal attack of eighteen men, two Vickers, and two large Hotchkiss. The ridge was a flint one, and the Turks could not entrench on it, as we had found in the morning ; the ricochets were horrible. They lost many men, and our left flank were finally able by a sudden burst of fire to wipe out the Turkish machine- gunners and rush the guns. The mounted men then charged the retreating Turks from our right flank, while we sent forward the infantry and the banners in the centre. They occupied the Turkish line at sunset, and chased the enemy back past their guns into the bed of Wadi Hasa ; where their cavalry in reserve put up a check that was not passed till dark. Our people mostly gave up the pursuit at this point (we had had no food since the day before, and the cold ’was pitiful) but the Bedouins of Kerak took it up and harried the flying mob all night. Our losses were about twenty-five killed and forty wounded. The Ibn Jazi Howeitat, under Hamad el-Arar, did splendidly, and the villagers were very steady and good.” The figures of the Turkish losses were given in the last Bulletin. Four more machine guns have since been brought in, raising the number captured to twenty-seven. A JOURNEY ACROSS ARABIA FROM UQAIR TO JIDDAH. 1. Uqair to Riyadh. Towards sundown on November 15, 1917, the dhow, into which we had stowed ourselves and our effects on the morning of the previous day at Bahrain, and in which we had spent two weary days and a very uncomfortable night instead of the seven or eio-ht hours usual under normal conditions, found the.wind at last off the Uqair headland and sailing into the harbour cast anchor alongside the pier. We were warmly welcomed on behalf of the ruler of Nejd by the local Emir, and spent the following day seeing the sights of Uqair such as they were and in making preparations for our onward journey. The port of Uqair consists of a large khan, a lew oftces belonging to the local agents of Hasa merchants, the house of the Emir and the quarters of the local garrison in a little fort—all situated on the foreshore between the sea and the sandhills. On the edge of the latter is a well which supplies the place with water and a small guard-tower for its protection from marauders. The permanent resident population of Uqair is_ nil, but an excellent harbour—inaccessible under present conditions _ to ships of any great draught—gives it some commercial importance, and necessitates the residence of a number of officials and a garrison, as also of the agents of merchants interested in trade between the interior and the outer world.— 44 — By midday on November 18 our preparations were complete and our caravan of some thirty camels and half that number of asses (the famous white asses of Hasa which are largely used in the carrying trade between the oasis and the sea) started off on its journey inland. The distance between Uqair and the eastern edge of the Hasa oasis is roughly about forty-six miles, which we accom plished in two days (actually about fourteen and a quarter hours), the whole journey being over an utterly desolate, tumbled mass of sand ridges. There is no scarcity of rough desert vegetation, while occasional depressions between the ridges of sand bear quite a considerable crop of dwarf date palms and other bushes which betray the presence of water—indeed there would seem to be at least three lines of route between Uqair and Hasa on all of which water, good, bad and indifferent is found at frequent intervals. We followed the central of these routes via Suwad, a broad depression covered with dwarf palms at a distance of three miles from the coast, Lassaf three and a half miles further on, Abu Khayala another one and a half miles on, at all of which places water is obtainable, across the Umm el-Dharr depression to the ridge of Jasra, whence, looking upon the eastern sea for the last time, we descended to the depression of Buraiman, a cheerless oasis of dwarf palms, where excellent water is to be had in numerous water-holes. Here we camped for the night about fifteen miles from the coast, resuming our journey early the following morning over a waterless tract of sand, the first section of which is known as Nuqaiyat el-Aish and the second el-Ala owing to its rather higher elevation, to the brackish wells of Shatar, on the edge of a saline depression called el-Sabkha, some two to three miles broad. This we crossed in a south-westerly direction, our course hitherto having been about W.S.W., to'its further edge, where we re-entered the sands. A small patch of dwarf palms called Alkhisa was reached a few miles further on, and our road now passed oyer a switchback series of sand ridges called Nuqairat oyer which the going was distinctly good until the last and highest sand ridges of the Barr ebHasa were reached. From the summit of these we looked down upon the long black line of the Palms of Hasa and another three miles over flat plain brought us to the gates of the little village of Jisha. The northern route across the sandhills is perhaps more often selected for the journey to Hasa than the one we had followed trom which it diverges before Jasra is reached. Thence passing nVu- 6 rig i h y 0r . 110 ^ h °£ the Jasra ridge it strikes water at )ahdiya, el-Zuqain Abul Mans, Makku in the Sabkha depression and Khuwaimj, and eventually rejoins our route near el-Khisa. rtu tt d soutliern line Passes water at Naba, south of the Umm el-Dharr depression, el-Ghina and Muraizib, south ot yhatar in the same saline depression. It is worth remarking that the water at Makku and Muraizib, which from all accounts— 45 — are situated like Shatar on the edge of the saline depression, is sweet, while that of Shatar is practically undrinkable. The Barr el-Hasa, as these sand hills are called, is frequented indiscriminately by all the eastern tribes, but so far as one could gather our line of march was through the west of the Beni Hajar, to the south of whom are the Manasir and Murra in that order, the latter extending down to Qatar and Wadi Jibrin, while the Beni Khalid and Ajman occupy the northern marshes, the latter extending parallel to and north of Kuweit. Jisha is a dingy little village, a rough square in shape surrounded by a turreted wall each side of which is about 200 yards in length. The houses are of rough limestone found in abundance in the quarries which surround the village, and the population, which is largely agricultural, numbers perhaps some 3,000 to 4,000 souls. On the following day we struck through the oasis in a W.S.W. direction, a short march of just over ten miles bringing us to Hofuf, the capital of Hasa and at the same time the gateway of the oasis on the west side. The Hasa oasis thus extends to a depth of some seven or eight miles from east to west, but I had no means of forming an idea of its length from south to north. It comprises two distinct belts of palms, each several miles deep, separated from each other by a bare level plateau and running north and south, the western belt standing at an elevation of about 100 feet above the level of the eastern. The magnificent gardens of the latter oasis which contains the villages of Jafar and Fudhul on our course, Amran, Sabat, Markaz el-Qara and Munaizila to the north, and the village of el-Taraf to the south, are watered by a complicated irrigation system dependent on the two main streams of Birabir and Wajjaj. The western belt which contains a good deal of rice cultivation but whose date groves are distinctly inferior to those of Jafar and Fudhul, is watered by a considerable number of streams, of which the most important are the Khudud, the Haqal, the Ain el-Harra, which is a hot spring issuing from the ground near Mubarraz (north of Hofuf), and the Umm el- Khuraisan. The water of the last named enjoys the reputation of providing an unfailing test for the black dye used in the colouring of abas, only the best dye being able to stand the test of immersion in this stream, whose dark colour speaks eloquently of many disappointments. All these streams originate m springs issuing from the ground within the limits of the oasis itself. Of Hofuf, where we remained two days inspecting the town and its environs and enjoying the society and hospitality of Abdullah ibn Jiluwi, the Emir of Hasa, it is unnecessary to speak at length. Our time passed pleasantly enough, but our European clothes proved such an obstacle to free movement that we decided to discard them henceforth in favour of Arab apparel, and on the afternoon of November 21 we moved out to^ the suburb of Ruqaija. Camping here under the walls of the Khizam4(5 — fort (two miles west of Hofuf) we removed the last traces of our European identity and early on the following morning begun our march to the Wahhabi capital. Our caravan now consisted entirely of camels, though two small donkeys attached themselves to our party and braved the hardships of the road to the end. The personnel of the caravan comprised our three selves, a few cavaliers provided as escort by Abdullah Jiluwi, Sheikh Dhib and his son, of the Beni Hajar, on their way to receive their tribal allowances from Ibn Saud, and elements of the Dawasir, Murra and Qahtan tribes and a self- invited semi-lunatic Patlian journeying to Mecca—a merry party as it proved, though our own lack of experience of Arab travel made it a little difficult at first to appreciate the aversion of our companions to sustained exertion and long marches. They in their turn were doubtless equally incapable of appreciating our reasons for travelling only by day, as night marching is obviously the most comfortable and expeditious way of travelling over the eastern desert. Be that as it may, we had taken all precautions to provide ourselves with an ample supply of water and, though the thriftlessness of our Bedouin friends reduced them to serious straits before we reached Abu Jifan, we ourselves experienced no shortage of water except for washing purposes. It took us five and a half days to cover the 130 miles of desolate desert between Hofuf and the wells of Abu Jifan, our course lying W.S.W. over the most utterly barren, grey, rock steppe it has ever been my lot to traverse. The afternoon of the first day brought us to Ghar el-Shuyukh, a large ledge of rock overhanging a bare depression in the steppe ; the next day took us over similar country broken only by the broad sandy depression of the Wadi Faruq, at the further edge of which our eyes were refreshed by the sight of three small acacias in the little ravine of Wadi Shajara. The steppe leading up to the Wadi Faruq is called Nala and that beyond it Rubaida, a section of which, in which we camped for the night, being distinguished from its monotonous surroundings by the name of Shaba. Rubaida and^ Shaba are in reality indistinguishable from the Summan which we crossed on the third day into a depression called Raudhat el-Baidha. Thence traversing the bare steppe land of Malsuniya and the stone-strewn plain of Salabikh and a depression of similar character called Sasra, we entered the Dahana at midday on the fourth day. The Dahana at this point has none of the characteristics reported of it further north and is a very typical bit of ordinary Nafudh, the sand ridges being of modest dimensions and much bioken up in their scheme of arrangement. The goino’ was sandy throughout, but quite good until near the further end where it became alittle heavy. From the Rijm el-Shuwair cairn, which marks the eastern entrance to the Dahana, to the Marbakh tract, where it ends, the distance, covered was just over twenty miles. Roughgrazing was plentiful, and the sand showed the traces of great herds of gazelles crossing and recrossing our path, though we did not have the good fortune to fall in with any of them. The Masbakh tract into which we passed on the fifth day is a flat sandy plain covered with minute dunes. From its western edge begins the plain of Urma, a great expanse of bare gravel- strewn country sloping very gradually westwards up to the summit of the Urma ridge, which drops down abruptly into the Turabi plain beyond, the escarpment standing out perhaps some 300 to 400 feet above the plain. As we approached the ridge the country began to be more broken up, and occasional ravines or shallow depressions crossed our path or were seen at a short distance on either side. One of these depressions on our line of march was the Raudhat el-Dhulla, a fairly extensive patch of acacia shrubs and other vegetation, a few miles beyond which we dropped down into the deep cleft of the Abu Jifan. The Abu Jifan gorge is situated about 1,300 feet above sea- level, its high boulder cliffs being about sixty yards apart at the spot where the wells are situated. The gorge runs down from east to west presumably into the Turabi plain and contains over twenty known wells, of which, however, only three are in regular use at the present time. Abundant and excellent water is reached about ten to twelve feet below ground level, and the wells now in use are lined with large slabs of limestone. After a short halt to allow camels and men to drink their fill of the welcome water, we resumed our march. For a short distance we followed the gorge and then turned west up a passage leading to the edge of the Urma escarpment, down which a precipitous zigzag path, which we left the camels to negotiate riderless, led to a deep bay in the escarpment covered with acacias and known as Abu Khishba. From this bay we emerged into the Turabi plain and turning north-west skirted the edge of the Urma ridge, near a prominent headland of which, called Khashur Asa, we camped for the night ( 1,000 to 1,100 feet above sea-level) having marched about seven miles since leaving the wells. Here a mighty wind, arising without warning during the night, levelled our tents to the ground over our heads and we slept among the debris of our camp till morning, which dawned cold and cloudy with a strong north wind. We now marched in a W.N.W 7 . direction, gradually diverging from the line of the Urma ridge across the Turabi plain, abroad well-covered depression between the Urma and the distant hills of Kharj. We camped for the night a few miles short of the Aqla wells, and the following day, marching still W.N.W., ascended the gentle gravelly slope of the Jubail ridge, which in its general features is an exact facsimile of the Urma ridge. 1 he Abu Jifan gorge here finds its counterpart, minus the wells, in the double gorge of Shaib Abbanas near the western extremity of the ridge,— 48 — which ends further west in a sudden drop down a steep escarp * ment into the Wadi Sulaiq. From the top of the ridge we had a magnificent view of the great range of Jebel Tuwaiq before descending into a maze of low tumbled hillocks through which we dropped easily into the Wadi Sulaiq. Camping here for the night under the shadow of the Jubail ridge we were up betimes next morning to cover the last stage of our journey. A gentle rise of fourteen miles over absolutely bare steppe brought us to the top of a low broken ridge, called the Muqharrizat, from which at last we looked down upon the gardens and towers of Riyadh, a thin black line of palms stretching north and south down the valley to Manfuha, which was visible in the distance to the south. At this point we were met by messengers sent out by Ibn Saud to welcome us to his capital and, continuing our march down the bare .slope towards the city, came upon Colonel Hamilton who had ridden out with a small party to meet us. The whole cavalcade now moved on, reaching the edge of the gardens one and a half miles from the Muqharrizat ridge just after the city gates had been closed for the midday prayer. As it happened to be a Friday, we had to wait a considerable time in the shade of a garden wall outside the city before the signal was given that the prayers were over and the gates open to receive us. Remounting our camels we soon entered the north-eastern gate of the city, and a short distance down the main street we found ourselves at the palace gates. Here we were met by Ibn Sand’s myrmidons and conducted immediately through a vast concourse of people to the audience chamber on the -first floor, where Ibn Saud and his father, the Imam Abdel Rahman, awaited us. Etiquette did not permit of Ibn Saud taking a prominent part in the interchange of greetings which followed, so long as his father remained in the room ; the latter accordingly withdrew after a decent interval on the plea that we must°be tired, and we were left alone with the Wahhabi ruler whose welcome of us was extremely cordial and friendly. For the rest we were provided with quarters in the palace and during the ten days I remained at Riyadh every facility was placed at our disposal lor seeing the city and its surroundings. Much time was of course spent in interviews with Ibn Saud him self, whose eloquence was tireless and most impressive, but with the exception of Ahmed ibn I hunaiyan of the Saud family and Abdullah Said Effendi, a native of Mosul trained to medicine in Constantinople and Paris, we saw little of other local personalities. In any case considerations of space do not permit at present of any attempt to describe them or the city itself. M&gt; 01 iginal plan, based, it must be admitted, on a mis conception of the state of affairs obtaining in Central Arabia had been to continue our wandering in the direction of the Qasim and Jebel Shammar. I he turn of events, however, did not favourthis development for the time being, but somewhat unexpectedly confronted me with a strong temptation to journey in a very different direction, to which I succumbed. ’ Ibn Saud fell in with my plans and did everything possible to further them and it was thus that on December 9, leaving my companion behind, I set forth with a Bedouin escort of five and thirty men in the direction of Taif. H. St. J. B. Philby. THE SIRHAN AND JAUF DEPRESSION. The following was contributed in October last by Mr. D. Carruthers as a result of cartographic researches preparatory to the compilation of the 1 : 1 , 000,000 map of the above region. More recent observations by Major T. E. Lawrence may modify some of Mr. Carruthers’ data and conclusions. “ This self-contained basin is the principal physical feature of the Southern Hammad. Its influence on the lines of communication is evident, for, whereas its trough forms the highroad between Syria and Jebel Shammar, there are no frequented routes crossing it diagonally, and although it presents no serious obstacle in itself, it will probably be the cause of diverting all east and west traffic in the future—whether motor or railway. The Sirhan depression may be said to begin at Kasr Azrak —at least it is here that travellers from Syria first note the floor of the valley. It extends south-eastw r ards as a well-defined hollow for 200 miles to the neighbourhood of Jebel Adhara, twenty miles west of Jauf. Here it seems to lose its definite character ; the hills cut in on the north, and the Nefud sand-bed approaches on the south. The Sirhan depression appears to bend to the south and to merge into the sands. According to Huber’s native informant,—‘ it loses itself near the wells of Sfan,’ which seem to be about fifteen miles south-west of Jauf. All travellers note a change in the general aspect of the wadi east of the group of wells which are marked by different authorities as Jerawi, Serar, Arfagia, Magooa (Meikum) Sebeikha—according to the actual wells visited. Taking the 500 metre contour, which happens to mark out in a general manner the bed of the wadi, the Jauf—Skaka region would form a separate little basin, divided from the Sirhan by a very slight barrier. This divide would scarcely be noticed by the traveller approaching from Jerawi, until he reached the edge of the little escarpment that drops into Jauf ; but overlooking this region from the hills to the north the impression would be that the Sirhan and Jauf basins were one ; as doubtless they used to be. Another notable point is that the Jauf-Skaka basin must be extended so as to include a large area to the north-east of the latter oasis, as far as Jebel Mghaira (Amghar) twenty miles— nO — away. According to Aylmer and Butler, the region from Skaka right up to the foot of Mghaira appears to be ‘ the bed of a lake long since dry.’ Jebel Mghaira is more truly a Jal —an escarp ment forming the eastern limit of the depression. I have come to these conclusions from an analysis of Huber’s aneroid readings. These needed careful adjustment between Azrak and Jauf on the strength of the late Captain Shakespear’s and Miss Gertrude Bell’s very reliable series of altitudes, which check Huber at Kasr Azrak and Hail, while they check each other at Haiyyaniya, and are themselves checked independently on the Hejaz railway at Ziza and Mudowara. The 500 metre contour lines are drawn approximately on to spot heights taken by the above-mentioned authorities and by Leachman. They roughly outline the beds of the Jauf and Sirhan depressions, and show the land-fall towards the Euphrates. The surface of the Sirhan is practically of the same level throughout its extent ; in places it sinks to a lower level, for instance in the neighbourhood of Kaf, where Huber records an altitude of 498 metres ; he notes that it is said to be the lowest point in the basin, which it probably is, if the existence of moisture in the form of salt marshes and bogs proves anything. If Huber’s altitude for this locality is reduced, in the same proportion as his other readings have had to be, it becomes 276 metres. The margin of the depression is quite definite, and we know the watershed of the whole basin fairly accurately, except towards the east. We do not know what lies between the escarpment of Mghaira (Aylmer and Butler) and the Nefud, but we do know that Shakespear could see this feature all the way from the Nefud edge forty miles distant, which seems to point to there being no rising ground between. In fact, it suggests the possibility of the Wadi Sirhan having once had an outlet to the Euphrates. In this case, had Jebel Druz sufficient rainfall, it might have been the source of a 600 mile water-way ! and anyway the Sirhan and Jauf basins would have been inland seas. We should know a little more on this matter had we the knowledge Musil must have gained on his journey from Kara to Jadaidet el-Arar, making a wide circuit to the east into the northern part of the Lubba tract. The Wadi Khar drains most, if not all, of the region to the east of Jauf. We know it for 200 miles between Hazil and Bahr-i-Nejet ,* it is a big wadi with a four-mile-wide bed where Leachman crossed it north-west of Hazil. Westwards of this point we only know of it by report, as having its^ head in the Lubba tract. From Shakespear’s altitudes in this region it looks as if the Khar must turn south wards into the sands at a point about 10(1 miles east of Jauf. The lowest part of the gap between the Nefud and Mghaira is m its northern portion, where Musil found the Wadi Ab- el-Kur, probably an affluent of the Khar, and if so its main head. Although only recently discovered, Huber knew of it from native information, recording it—with the Arar— 51 — -—as the last of the wadian system. This wadi we know reaches to within twenty miles of the eastern limits of the Janf-Skaka depression. Eastwards the Ab-el-Knr is continued in Leachman’s Belgur (Ab-el-Kur) depression, and further it may go to the Khar direct, or first into the Arar, which almost certainly finds its way into the Khar. The actual area which drains into the Sirhan and Jauf depressions is about 36,000 square miles. On the west the watershed is that of the Jordan, the Dead Sea and the isolated basins along the Hejaz railway. It runs from Jebel Druz (at Orman) along Jebel Sefa to Jebel Raha west of Bair, and so on across the Ard es-Suwan to the eastern end of Tubaik. South of this we area little less certain, but it seems as if the south-east flanks of Jebel Tubaik and all the drainage from the Fejr region—to within forty miles of Tebuk—falls into the Sirhan. On the north and east, the watershed is in the unexplored region between Jebel Druz, Jebel Aneza and Jauf. We know it more or less from notes in Musd’s pamphlet ‘ Kord Arabien 1908-9. A straight line from Jebel Druz to Jebel Aneza and south to Jebel Mghaira would not be far out. Musil says he followed the water-parting between the Euphrates and Sirhan on his route from Jebel Aneza to Skaka. On the south, the Eefud destroys our knowledge of the hydrography : all we know is that the flooi of the sand-bed falls from w T est to east. The Sirhan and the Nefud form a sort of barrier across North Arabia. But a clear gap exists between the two, there bemf three or four miles between the hp of the Jauf basin and the first sand-dunes : this is said to be hard level ground ; a little further east Shakespear was on a ‘ very flat plain’ for some way before he came to the edge of the escarpment. The Blunts described the region between the eastern end of the basin south of Kara, and the sands — 4 a flat black expanse of gravelly soil covered with small round pebbles absolutely level and baieot vegetation.’ Westwards the gap merges into the most smooth and level tract it is possible to imagine — 4 Basaita’ the Arabs call it, 4 the out-stretched.’ Further to the north-west this plain connects with the Ard es-Suwan—a desert of almost as even a character. East of the gap the same featureless country stretches on the line of the Wadi el-Khar to the neighbourhood of Neief We have no knowledge of any remarkable physical features in the shape of sand-belts, hills or escarpments in this region ; the drop would be roughly 550 metres in 350 miles. Motor vehicles attempting the run between the Euphrates and Jauf should aim at starting on the line of the Wadi Knar, (it is probable, but not quite certain, that the ultimate destination or the Khar is in the low ground at the north-west corner of the Bahr-en-Nejef.) Either bank could be followed. We know of only two small tributaries entering the wadi, at about fifty miles up from the west. It seems doubtful whether there are any entering from the east, as the Batn appears to take all the drainagein that direction, and the Wadi Hisb runs parallel at no great distance. Therefore, the south bank may prove to be the best going. As regards the region to the west of the Khar, there is an 80-100 mile stretch of unknown country ; but I believe the ‘ Wadi an ’ and its hill-country to be quite separate from the Khar region. Probably the Wadi Arar marks the end of the rough country of deep-cut wadis, and stony hills typical of the Wadian territory. South of the Arar Leachman records ‘grassy plains’ merging into the Ab-el-Kur depression, but beyond this he comes to the rough Guraiyat tract with ‘ an irregular surface, and the going very bad,’ a region of ‘disintegrated limestone with many inequalities and low hills.’ This changed to typical stony ‘ Hajara ’ before reaching the Khar. From the Wadi Khar to Jauf the best line may be had via Hazil, keeping in a line due west from the latter watering, along the Hajara between the Nefud edge and the rough Guraiyat tract. But a better line may be to take off from the Khar west of Samit and strike south-west in order to get into the easy country lying to the south of the Arar, and north of the Guraiyat. There is apparently a recognised route between Jauf and Nejef, passing along the course of the Ab el-Kur direct to Samit. Musil was actually making for Samit, when he altered his plans, and turned north, across the Ab-el-Kur to the Arar. Euting records the waterings between Jauf and Meshed Ali as Hazil, Sebeika, Raheimeh.” ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. {a) r lhe attack on Jurf el-Derwish. Colonel Joyce sends further details of the fighting at Jurf el-Derwish station, reported on page 15. The Beni Sakhr under Sherif Nasir numbered about 500, and were reinforced by Nuri Bey Said with one company of mounted infantry, four machine guns, one mountain gun, two demolition detachments about fifty strong, and a small French contingent with Hotchkiss automatic rifles. ^ 1 his force attacked the station on January 12 . The demolition parties during the night had cut the railway line north and south of the station, and a position was occupied by a section of the mounted troops before dawn, about 700 yards from the I inkisli position. At dawn the mountain gun and two machine guns opened fire on the Turks and took them completely by surprise. They replied with ineffective fire from a mountain ^ n ‘i j. 16 . jab mounted troops then advanced, supported by a 1 the Beni Sakhr, and the Turks retreated on the station abandoning their gun and machine guns.— 53 Both Arab guns were then directed against the unfortified station buildings, and after a few shots the Turks surrendered. The Turkish casualties were twenty killed and wounded and 150 prisoners, including seven officers, civilian employees and five engine drivers. Two engines and seven trucks, which had been unable to get away owing to the demolition of the line, were found in the station, and a considerable quantity of supplies. The Bedouins, as usual, went mad over the latter, and left all the djmamite and explosives behind in order to assist in the looting, and it took five hours before the explosives could be brought up and the/engines and the seven trucks destroyed. The station buildings, water supply, points, etc., were also blown up. A six-arch bridge north of the station should have been completely destroyed, but this was imperfectly carried out and the bridge was repaired by the Turks about twenty-four hours after the Arab troops retired. The total Arab casualties were two wounded. It was impossible for the Arab force to remain in occupation of the station as the Bedouins all dispersed with the loot, and the regular troops were too few to deal with lurkish reinforcements arriving from north and south. Following close on the Jurf el-Derwish success came the news that the Turks were evacuating Hishe, and Sheikh Diab el-An ran, head Sheikh of Tafila, sent to Sheri! iNasir infoiming him that Tafila could be occupied without opposition and that the inhabitants would deal with the small l urkish ganison, Hit that the occupation of the village by Bedouins would be resented. A company of infantry was sent forward from Wadi Musa, and Shobek and Hishe were occupied by Arab troops after slight resistance. The Turkish troops at Hishe were withdrawn to Anezah. The railway line between Anezah and Hishe is now completely destroyed' ; the Turks removed a portion and the remainder has been torn up by the Arabs On January 15 Sherif Nasir entered l ahla ynd the • oarrison of gendarmes surrendered. He was joined on the - 0 th bv Sherif Zeid with his following of Bisha and Ageyl, mid Gaafar Pasha with two companies of regular Arab troops arrived from Wadi Musa. (5) The Attack on Mudo.wara. In the attack on Mudowara station, reported in the last Bulletin, the Beni Atiyah, under Sherif M ohammed Ah do not seem to have behaved well. They were not really out to fight, and had refused even to leave Abu Sawana until Sherif Feisal had sent to Gueira and received money to pay them. The other Bedouins with Feisal were the Amran, under Sherif Hizzah, and a section of Howeitat, under Sherif Hashem. They were supported by 100 trained Arabs escorting two guns. “ The attack, writes Colonel Joyce, under date January 31, “was unsuccessful as regards its* full objective. The position was strongly fortified54 and defended by about 300 infantry, two guns and three or four machine guns ; the Bedouins would make no attempt to storm the fortified hills overlooking the station, and without infantry co-operation all the assistance we could offer with our guns and aeroplanes was in itself insufficient to completely silence enemy resistance. One detached post held by twenty Turks was rushed and captured, five Turks being killed and fifteen taken prisoners. The ten-pounder mountain guns on Talbots did excellent work, and their high explosive and shrapnel must have caused severe casualties. They were in action the whole day at a distance of 2,000 yards from the main Turkish defence^. The French con tingent operating from the north-west fired 104 rounds from their mountain gun, and would have ably supported any advance, had the Bedouins attempted it. The action of armoured cars was much hampered by soft sand. They dismounted machine guns and raked the enemy defences at close range, but infantry support was not forthcoming. The R.F.C. rendered valuable support, and dropped over th ree-quarters of a ton of explosives on Mudowara station and the defensive posts. Communication with the ft.F.C. was impossible except by means of simple ground signals, but on their own initiative they bombed the enemy aeroplane which landed at Mudowara on the morning of the 23rd, and rendered it unserviceable to leave by air. On the morning of the 23rd all Arabs returned to Abu bawana by Sherif Feisal s order, having run out of ammunition and water. I he attack would probably have succeeded had the Bedouins rushed the position at dawn. Major Maynard and myself had made a careful reconnaissance of the position previous to the attack, and advised Feisal to make the attempt, for once the Turks had manned their positions they were really formidable ones to take by storm. Sherif Feisal and Nuri Bey, however, were in favour of a preliminary bombardment. It is difficult to combine modern weapons with Bedouin tactics. They sat on the hills and watched the bombardment with great interest, and each shell fired or bomb dropped was assisted on its way by feivent imprecations that it would fall on the heads of all the Turks and destroy them ; as to co-operating by an infantry advance, no attempt at it was made. The Sherifian artillery was so ineffective as to be negligible. The Arabs were in no way disconcerted by their failure to take the station, and are now concentrating for a fresh offensive.” Sherif Abdullah's Operations. On February _7, a detachment of Abdullah’s army, accompanied by Major Davenport, ambushed a Turkish wood cutting party south of Bir Jedid. Five Turks were killed, two wounded, and five mules captured. The enemy then opened ic th a mountain gun and attempted to encircle the Arabs who retired.The same force attacked the line between Bir Jed id and Toweira on the 8 th. Major Davenport reports that the Arabs rushed some posts across the open in splendid style, while French and Egyptian demolition detachments, using 4,000 charges, destroyed seven miles of railway and telegraph line and eleven culverts. An enemy attack from Bir Jedid was driven back. All the afternoon a Turkish gun shelled the Arabs, who, however, suffered no casualties. It was reported by prisoners («) that Fakhreddin Pasha had just left Medina for Syria, and (A) that the train which was wrecked near Abu Naam (see p. 36) was conveying some of the inhabitants of Medina northwards. (d) General. The victory of Seil el-Hasa is considered by Sherif Feisal to be of great political importance. It definitely compromises all the inhabitants up to Wadi Hasa and generally strengthens the Arab Movement. The head sheikh of Tafila is still reported to have Turkish leanings, but the majority of the people are entirely pro-Sherifian. The present Turkish garrison is reported to consist of three battalions, but so much under strength that their total does not exceed 600 men. Enemy aeroplanes are now active in the Kerak area. An Arab post has been placed on the Kerak-Mezraa road. On February 12 over 1,000 lbs. of bombs were dropped on Katrani station by the Australian B lying Corps. Bourteen direct hits were obtained on the railway, rolling stock and station buildings. A patrol of twenty Turks was captured on Bebruary 10 , five kilometres south of Wadi Ethil, by Beni Atiyah undei Ali el-Hadaydi. The Arabs severely damaged a train by means of an electric mine, an engine and two trucks being derailed. Sherif Ali reports a patrol engagement near Ibyar Ah (five miles south-west of Medina) where the Arabs captured twelve men, twenty mules and two riding camels. Between Medina and Makheif (unidentified) the whole of an enemy patrol is stated to have been killed and fifteen rifles taken. NOTES. Me,sopotamiati Neics . Colonel Leachman, writing under date December 22, 1917, considers that Mohammed ibn Mijlad (see Bulletin 70, p. 459) is entirely untrustworthy. He had been camping with Ajeimi at Shabikhah (seventy-seven miles south-west of Samawah) where the latter is still encamped with two to three hundred men. Fahad— 56 — ibn Hadhdhal was moving up the Wadi Ubaiyidh, which was running after the recent rains. He is now in his dotage and extremely difficult to deal with, as he will promise everything and do nothing ; but his health is, unfortunately, excellent. Colonel Leach man reports that the Sibaa Sheikh, Githwan ibn Murshid, to whom he gave some dates, has no personality, but is well-mannered and modest. He complains that he has been turned out of his lands near Sukhnah. Some of the Hadidiyin, with an agreeable sheikh, Sufuk el-Itajam, also visited Colonel Leachman and received dates, and they, too, reported that they had been driven out of their lands near Aleppo, apparently by Germans. According to their statement, not a tree remains in the Aleppo gardens, all having been cut down as fuel for the railway. Hashim ibn Muheid, of the Fedan, was reported to be north of Jebel Bishri. His father committed suicide, and he himself is said to be not wholly sane. At the end of November Nuri Shaalan sent a letter from Jauf to the authorities in Mesopotamia, asking for leave to buy camels from the Amarat near Kerbela. These camels, he stated, were required by the Sherifian forces, and were, in fact, subsequently supplied to Sherif Feisal’s army. The Kufra-Farafra Road. The following information comes from a reliable source :— The most easterly town in Kufra (Kebabo) is Boema. The surrounding country is very rich, and produces wheat, barley, tobacco, maize, water melons, raisins, etc. Water is good and plentiful. East of Boema, the country is largely sabakha, but dates are cultivated. This sabakha extends eight hours’ march (about thirty-two kilometres) east of Boema to Ain Gedid, a single well with a plentiful supply of good water belonging to the family of Gedid, of the Zwiy tribe. There is a house there, and a few date palms. From this point, the Darb Dwahil (or Darb Farafra), runs east to Farafra. A motor-car, with a good guide, could probably run along this road to Ragabet Mobarak (five days march, about 225 kilometres), where the large sand- dunes start, this sand extends for seven days’ march (about 515 kilometres), to Maatan bu Mungar, where there are a well and four or five date palms, and an old house.SECRET.

CoitNWALUS, nirevtor, Arab Irnreau.— 57 SITUATION OF THE SHERIFI A.N REVOLT. Five months ago—at the beginning of October, 1917—the situation of the Arab Revolt was summarized in Arab Bulletin, No. 65. The Northern army, under Emir Feisal, then held the line Akaba—Gueira—Fiji (Wadi Musa). The beginning of March, 1918, finds the left wing of that army thrown north across Wadi el-Hasa from a base at Tafila, while a flying column has occupied Mezra, the port of Kerak on the Dead Sea. J his statement indicates an advance of about fifty miles to Wadi el- Hasa (or seventy miles to Mezra), the intervening country including Shobek, the Hishe forest with its valuable wood supply, and Tafila with its cornlands. Feisal’s centre has been pushed forward about thirty miles from Gueira to Ain el-Beida, and is now watching Maan station from a distance of less than six miles and Maan town from about four miles. Feisal himself has definitely left Akaba and now has his headquarters at Gueira, with an advanced headquarters at Tafila. His right wmg has been extended south to Abu Sawana, some twenty-fiye miles north-west of Mudowara station, and is operating against the sixty miles of railway between the hitter station and Maan. All these moves amount to considerable progress and they have brought the Sherifian arms for the first time into settle agricultural districts of Syria proper with good prospect of further advance shortly : for Kerak is known to be, upon the whole, disaffected to the Turks, and only weakly held by a ore of indifferent morale. Its capture will rob the enemy of a valuable grain district and ensure practicable communication across the Dead Sea with the right wmg of our forces m Palestine, even should touch not have been established previously hv land round the head of that sea. ' The Southern army has not made so marked wi adv^ one nart of it under Emir Ali, havm S done practically nothing fn the interval except throw forward its left wing towards the iZl oT smah enemy pofs The rest of this force has been content with watching the outposts of west and witli occasional, and rather futile, .util e ) 1 ■ The other part of the Southern army, Emir Abdullah s force, &amp; s A rti « be encamped some six irnles^^^ ^ m railes _ it has effected at one time or another, during the period under review a desultory series of demolitions, winch ’ at ^ ^ '‘^Gteverely larger scale than formerly, and appear to have taxed se , •r f pnpmv’s supply of spare rails, at least that of bolt , if not the enemy^ PI • . pq by w i n ter rams, inter-58 — the southern section of the railway is so far reduced that, at the. present moment, Medina no longer looks to be supplied by that channel, and is virtually isolated. _ That is the Arab military situation on the map. in the most important area of operations, the north, notably advanced ; on the enemy’s line of communications, advanced, though not greatly ; in the south, much as it was. If looked at from another point of view, that of strength in comparison with the enemy, the situation shows, both on paper and in fact, somewhat more marked improvement all round. I he Northern army has received during the period about 1,000 lecruits for its contingent of regulars, in addition to a force biought up from Wejh by Emir Zeid, which previously was inactive with Abdullah. It has also been joined by Bedouin contingents from tribes of better fighting quality than were available previously, e.g., Huweitat (Ibn dazi) and Beni Sakhr. With these some Turkish regular troops in considerable strength have been met in the open and defeated more than once, notably in the recent battle at Seil el-Hasa, where over eighty per cent of an enemy force, above 600 strong, were accounted for. In equipment Feisal’s army is also considerably stronger than it was. Auxiliary services of aeroplanes and armoured cars have been provided for it, and it is well supplied with guns and with personnel who can use them. It is, however, still conspicuously short of transport and, therefore, of food and means of protection against cold. Abdullah’s army is largely drawn from fluctuating contingents of Bedouins of inferior fighting quality, whose spirit has been impaired by various causes—by the winter cold (the Bedouin campaigning season is summer), by protracted failure of supplies due to certain manoeuvres of those responsible for transport from Yambo, by enemy propaganda, and, most of all, by the slow payment of promised subsidies. The last cause has particularly affected the Harb in both Abdullah’s force and All’s. On the other hand, the Juheinah, for what they are worth, have kept loyal, and the Ateibah contingent, though worth even less, has been favoured at the others’ expense, while a new and energetic auxiliary has been found in Ferhau el-Aida and his Anazeh. lo the latter and to the co-operation of a French Algerian detachment, Abdullah has chiefly owed such enchanced success as he claims in his raiding operations during the past five months. I he real improvement of his military situation, however, consists more in the relative decline of enemy strength opposed to him than in increase in his own forces ; and this is absolutely true of Ali, whose-army in itself is not so numerous as it w r as a year ago, and has not added to its gun power. 1 uu u teady d f ay ° £ l)oth fche enem y’s 2 nd Composite Force an n a!

Intelligence reports published from time to time in the Bulletin have illustrated the decline of the enemy’s L. of C. troops on the southern section of the line, and Medina garrison, among whom the average battalion strength has fallen to below 200 effectives, scurvy is rife, morale is low, mounted troops and aeroplanes are no longer available, and food is so short that all civilians have been sent out of Medina. In relation to Feisal both the composite forces have also declined in strength, neither having been able to retain their mounted units, or to replace damaged aeroplanes. From lack of reinforcement, withdrawal of units to the north, and the effect of Arab raids, the man power of both forces has declined even more seriously than that of the H.E.F. Neither Maan nor Tebuk would be able any longer to keep out Feisal’s regular forces, were these able for their part to push an assault home. The left wing of the northern Arab army is, of course, in less favourable case owing to its gradual approach towards the bases of the Turkish Fourth Army. By concentrations and reinforcements from Deraa the enemy’s forces opposed to it grow, rather than diminish, in strength, but at the expense of reserves which would be available otherwise for the Palestine front. So far so good : but there are less satisfactory features of the situation. The Arab regular troops, on whose recruitment, equipment, and training so much has been expended, remain an inefficient and unreliable element of both armies. Their material is in great part bad, because it is drawn from ^warlike settled populations like the Meccan, or from races with little sense of discipline, like the liejaz fellahin, or from formei constituents of the Ottoman army, serving voluntarily alter bem 0 prisoners of war, but mostly of indifferent morale, insubordinate, o“influenced by divergent political aims. The old antagonism of Syria versus Iraq is rife m the army, and both elements disaoTee with the Hejazis. Officers are more seriously affected by this partisan spirit than their men, and, with a few exceptions they have proved an almost worthless^ lot, under whom troops ha we little chance of being either trained or led to airy go military purpose. The Syrian officers are worst m respect of political intriguing, and they have given much evidence of an anti-European chauvinism which has mcreased of late, th^ks t suspicions about secret agreements among the Allies. I he lesu has 1 been that the volunteer officers have been an obstruction, o the whole, rather than a help to getting on with the war, especially in Abdullah’s force, where the indolent character of the Lmn ha offered inducement and scope to their chauvinism. ’Idie Bedouin elements are little concerned with such politics, and by retaining none of them long in the field at one time and calling in ever fresh elements to replace those outworn oi dis- Jrr ' 4 heartened the Emirs have succeeded in maintaining their irregulai forces 'at about the original pitch, notwithstanding tlie nomad s atute distaste for sustained action and winter campaigning The grievance however, that some of the tribesmen m the field, and more a who are behind the front, nurse about their pay and subsidies is growing with time Large as is our allowance to Kinir Husein, and liberally as he appropriates it to his sons armies, it cannot pay for both the fighting forces and those who are not needed to fight. The King’s policy is to pay only those Bedouins actually fighting, or necessary to the army because it operates in their territory, or likely to be needed for future fighting He, therefore, incurs the reputation of neglecting former helpers and friends, such as the Harb, who were so necessary to him a year or more ago when the scene of operations lay on the Medina-Rabegli roads. Some clans of this tribe have already retaliated for his neglect by stopping and looting the Southern army s supplies, and as Emir Abdullah, who dislikes the Harb, and lavours their Ateibah enemies, is not likely to call out the former tribesmen again for service, we shall probably hear more of their besetting the Medina roads and inciting others to help embarrass King Husein at home. The enemy’s long L. of C. is still not cut definitely, though, as stated above, it has almost ceased to be of practical service to the Turks, at any rate south of el-Ala. Nowhere as yet, however, have the Arabs held on for more than three days, at the outside, to any station or other point captured on the line, nor have they wrecked any of the larger bridges. YV hen at last a definite cut is made, it is more likely to be north of Maan than south. Immediately ahead of what may be regarded as the Arabs’ main offensive front, the Wadi el-Hasa line, the position is, that the rural Kerak Arabs, both Moslem and Christian, have openly come over to the Sherifial side, and are ready to co operate at once in a further move of Feisal’s army northward. But the Mujaliyah, who are dominant in the town of Kerak itself, still sit on the fence, while Emir Zeid, who is in command of Feisal’s advance force, hesitates to advance, deterred partly by the continued cold, partly by nervousness about operating in a new country under conditions unlike those of Arabia proper, but most of all by the natural inertia and weakness of purpose which he shares with some of his brothers. Hence the delay which has succeeded the successes at Tafila and Wadi el-Hasa. It is especially to be regretted, because a strong force of the Beni Sakhr is willing and ready to operate in the Arab cause n° r th of Kerak again, and Bedouin forces should be used, when ready, without more procrastination that} can be avoided.— 61 JOURNEY ACROSS ARABIA. II. Riyadh to Taif. The trip to Taif once decided upon, it did not take long to make the necessary preparations or to call in the camels from their grazing grounds, and before midday on December 9 , Ibn Sand having previously in my presence given the most explicit instructions to the leaders of my party that my slightest wish was to be considered his command, we mounted our camels before the palace gates and in a few minutes issued from the city by the south-western gate. My intention at the moment of starting was to journey to Taif by the ordinary Hajj route and, having finished what I had to do there, to return by a southern route down the Wadi Dawasir to Sulaiyyil and thence back to Riyadh. The whole journey, I calculated, would take about forty to fifty days if all went well. As it turned out, however, circumstances necessitated the prolongation of my journey to Jeddah, whence I found to my great chagrin 1 was not destined to return —at least by land. Riyadh is situated at an elevation of about 1,750 feet above sea-level, in a valley jutting out perhaps a mile to the northward from the direct south-easterly line of the Wadi Hanifa, which is locally known as the Batin at this point. Our course to Daraiyya accordingly lay to the north of the wadi, along the high ground on its' left bank, and it was not till we reached Daraiyya itself that we actually entered the bed of the wadi, of which, however, we obtained glimpses from time to time. The line of Jebel Tuwaiq lay to our left front, and the rough steppe over which we travelled is known somewhat vaguely as the Hishat el-Daraiyya, resembling in general appearance the bare slope of Muqharrizat which we had traversed while approaching Riyadh from the east. At a distance of a few miles from the capital we crossed a depression running down into the A adi Hanifa called Abu Mahruq, at whose confluence with the wadi stood a few small palm groves. Beyond this we entered a ravine called Maidhar in which to our right stood a fort and well with some signs of cultivation around them. Ascending the stony steppe ahead of us we obtained a last glimpse of the palms of Riyadh fiom its summit, and soon reached a newly constructed well on the road side in a depression at the end of which, on the edge of the Wadi Hanifa, stood the village of Arqa (Arja) and a considerable mass of palms. . 0 , , . Ahead of us stood the cairn called Rijur el-baud marking the position from which the guns of Ibrahim Pasha converted the stately city of Daraiyya into a maze of rums to be tor ever a prominent landmark in the troubled history of Nejd under the dynasty rf Saud.^ ^ mjles to the north-west o£ Riyadh, in a wide bulge o£ the Wadi Hanifa whose high rocky banks |62 — were fortified by a wall of immense circuit and great gates, and bastions whose remains, still massive in their desolation, tell the story of the downfall of the proud capital just a century ago. In the middle of the wadi itself stands the massive rock on which stood the palaces and city, now a massive- of ruins, and around it along the sandy bed of the torrent lie extensive palm groves and terraced corn fields protected from the torrent by masonry walls. In and among the palms appear the hamlets of Malwi, el-Dhahara, el-Ghasiba, el-Auda and el-Ub which collec tively make up the modern town of Daraiyya, and extend in the order given northward up the valley, to the point where the two sides of the Wadi Hanifa converge again on a narrow opening perhaps about 150 yards across. The Daraiyya area extends about four or five miles from south-east to north-west and is about one mile across at its broadest point. Its population may be anything up to 10,000 souls of the mixed composition common to Nejdi habitations, the ancient stock of Beni Tamim mingling with Dawasir, Qahtan and other elements. Camping for the night under the ruins of Taraifa, as the old city is called, we pursued our course the following morning in a north-west direction up the Wadi Hanifa, which, after the last ^ palm groves are passed at el-Ilb, continues between precipitous cliffs, varying in height from 100 to 200 feet for about two and a half miles to Malqa, a prosperous little palm grove belonging to Ibn Saud himself and standing at the edge of a little ravine, which flows down from the east into the Wadi Hanifa at its continence with the Wadi Ammariya coming 1 down from the west. From this point the ordinary Hajj route follows the upper course of the Wadi Hanifa north-west via Jubaila, reputed to be the first settlement established in the wadi, Ayaina, Sadus and fiaisiya round to Dhruma, but a hasty consultation decided to deter the prospect of visiting these places to some later occasion and to continue our journey up the W r adi Ammariya. We accordingly turned west into the heart of the Jebel luwaiq whose great rock buttresses ran down on both sides of the wadi, hemming in its broad bed with a wall varying in height from 200 to 500 feet. Three miles up the waTwL e Xe'^Shsi Wa Ih ab n t , W - N - W -’ We l &gt;assed the ' ow deserted age of Shajaia Abu Qubas, once prosperous and well covered slusrjs - s , ,, Coil .|! nui ng u p the wadi we came after another three miles ^foot V ^ Vei 7 Picturesquely situated at The present villao-p ^ &lt;UH ( 1111 7 i emm iscent of past prosperity, e present village is a mere shadow of its greater predecessor to he t 'tt? nL a T ng a £or f ‘ stumps reduced water faiC it |a fuVrf'th 1 ' 8 TT d ° W ” P 6 Valle &gt;’ % me raiiure of the wells however has only been63 — partial and water still remains sufficient to enable the little village of perhaps some 500 inhabitants (mostly Dawasir and Suqur Anaza) to cultivate enough corn and palms to suffice for its maintenance. We were now in the centre of the Tuwaiq system of which one ridge lay to our left, while we skirted the foot of another to our right, following the continuation of the Wadi Ammariya which here bends round to the south of west, ever ascending towards the plateau, which forms the main core of Jebel Tuwaiq and feeds the ravines subsidiary to the main drainage channel of Wadi Hanifa. The tortuous bed of the wadi, narrowing into a difficult defile as it neared the edge of the plateau, brought us after a march of some eight miles to the foot of the Shaib Saqta, a narrow ravine, up which our path, exceedingly difficult for the camels, led over large boulders to the edge of the great plateau, locally known as el-Dhahara and lying at an elevation of about 2,800 feet above sea-level, i.e. over 1,000 feet higher than Riyadh. Marching for another two miles across the plateau we camped near the Shaib Makhlab, one of the tributaries of the Wadi Ammariya. To the south of us at no great distance ran a ridge called el-Hamra, while to the north the view extended far over the undulating plateau towards Haisiya and Sadus. East ward lay the broken country over which we had travelled during the day and westward stretched the plateau as far as ej^e could see, though from the summit of a prominence near by I was able to obtain a view of the western extremity of the plateau and the jagged escarpment which terminates it. We had now covered thirty-one and three-quarter miles from Riyadh. Next morning a march of two miles in a south-west direction across the plateau brought us to the edge of the roughly indented escarpment of Jebel Tuwaiq and to the top of the magnificent Saqta gorge, which drops down precipitously some 500 feet or more to the plain below. Here avc dismounted and great difficulty Avas experienced guiding the camels, especially the baggage animals, down the steep rocky path, but in three-quarters of anThour we had negotiated the perilous passage and stood in the plain below. Looking back I AA^as much struck by the resemblance of the escarpment to a great natural fortress, with some dozen massive bastions of sheer rock situated in a wide semi-circle and connected with each other by the clear cut line of the rido-e. The projection of the bastions to right and left cut off the°view of the Tuwaiq ridge, Avhich I afterwards saw extending into the far distance north and south with occasional massive 'projections into the valley—a long line of sheer precipitous rock negotiable only in a few places, the easiest passage of the Tuwaiq range being along the Wadi Hanifa route debouching into the plain at Haisiya, as already mentioned, while another pass is said to lie further south of the line Ave64 — followed. The Saqta gorge is by common consent the most difficult of all the passes and is on this account seldom chosen for the journey. # . y.. The plain now descended in easy steppes to the Uhruma va,lley, the edge of which we reached after marching three miles. A number o^asrs dotted the valley, which runs roughly north and south between the edge of the Tuwaiq range and a ridge of low hills beyond which to the westward could be seen the sands of Nafudh Jan. Round the qasrs is a considerable amount of barley cultivation, and southward of them lie the villages^ of Muzahimiya, Ghat Ghat, anew Akhwan creation, and Maghrafiya, none of which we had time to visit. Striking across the plain diagonally to the west we passed a number of qasrs on the way, and after a march of some six miles entered the palm groves of Dhruma, a square-built walled town standing in a clearing among the palms and reputed to contain a population of some 10,000 souls. 1 did not think that the appearance of the town warranted this estimate and should be inclined to put its population at not more than 6,000. We were delayed here by the pressing invitation of the mukhtar to partake of his hospitality, to which we the more readily acceded as our host was a man of some repute as a warrior, and enjoys the distinction of having been the first man to scale the walls of the Hofuf fort when Ibn Saud wrested it from the Turks. In due course we resumed our march and four miles further on passed the wells of Jan Saibani, almost immediately entering the sands of Nafudh Jan. Although only two miles broad from east to west, this little Nafudh proved to be by far the most difficult to negotiate of all the sand tracts crossed during our march. Rising by successive precipitous waves to a height of several hundred feet it descended even more abruptly into the narrow depression of Maanij, in which is situated a prominent ridge of dark rock. Under this we were glad enough to halt as the rain which had threatened to descend upon us throughout the last two days began to come down. We were now tifty-one miles distant from Riyadh and about 1,800 feet above sea-level, but the temperature, which was nearly 52° Fahrenheit at 6 a.m. on the plateau of el-Dhahara, dropped to 49° at 6 a.m. on the following day at Maanij. The weather conditions were most unpropitious, and the rain was coming down in a steady drizzle when we struck camp on the morning of December 12 and passed almost immediately out of the Maanij depression into a second Nafudh called Quuaifida, which extends about twelve miles in depth westward but presents no difficulty to camel traffic. The rain became worse and worse and by the time we reached the further end of the Nafudh we were drenched through, while the prospect of having to encamp in the sodden plain beyond was so unattractive that we decided to pitch camp where we were, though it was not yet midday, as the sand at least secured us from being flooded out. Our decision was prudent as the rain became— fin (JOW) v y touch heavier during the afternoon, when we were safely under canvas, and the temperature at 3 p.m. stood at 42 - 8°. Next morning at G a.m. the thermometer read 41‘S 0 , the rain having continued throughout the night, but I resisted the urgent entreaties of my companions for delay and insisted on a start. Accordingly at 7.30 we were in the saddle descending on to the great plain of Maruta, sloping gradually upwards by easy steppes to the edge of the third line of Nafudh, called Nafudh Dalqan, some twenty miles distant. The rain had left its mark on the plain, which in parts was a shimmering mass of water and in other thoroughly sodden. At two and a half miles from the eastern edge of the plain we passed the wells of Tubraq, of which three are in present use and contain excellent water near the surface, all being lined with stone, while others have fallen into disuse. Water was however no consideration to us now, as rain-water collected from the pools and puddles in which it lay is considered infinitely superior to any well water and in my opinion fully justifies the preference given to it, as there always seemed to be a slightly brackish taste in the water even of those wells which are reckoned sweet. Three miles further on we left the wells of Sudaira about half a mile to our right, the southern extremities of the Tuwaiq being visible in the far distance in the direction of Hauta, while the shadowy outline of a distant range began to show up to westward, this being the Ardh range, whose prominent double-peaked mountain called Idhuain Shamal, or “the ears of the north,” was henceforward a landmark to steer upon. Just before reaching the edge of the Nafudh Dalqan we passed the Dalqan wells, three in number and containing drink able water of inferior quality. This Nafudh is not ol great extent, being somewhat less than two miles from east to w r est, and on the western edge of it we halted for the night, taking for the first time since we left Riyadh the precaution of turning aside from the main track into a hollow, for we were now on the furthest eastern boundary of the Ateibah s haunts and no longei entirely secure from molestation, though our party had iepie- sentatives of the Ateibah and indeed of all the tribes of Centra Arabia to pilot us through in safety. In view of this precaution, it struck me as somewhat strange that at intervals during the night our Ateibah rafiqs went out to the four corners of our camp and announced 'in a loud voice who we were and whence and whither journeying, incidentally also inviting anyone who might happen to be within earshot to come in to partake ol any meal that might be going, or of coffee. It is curious that thoug i this procedure was followed nightly till our arrival at fait, we had but very few responses to our invitation. Next morning we traversed the great bare plain of Hadba Qidhla, seventeen miles in breadth, with the Ardh range ever becoming clearer before us, until at last we cios^ed t e i £— 66 ■apni torrent bed of Harmaliya, wldcli descends from the Idhuain Shamal and runs southward along 1 the face of the range into the Shaib Quaiiyya, a ravine running from west to east through the main body of tlie range. A little way up this ravine we reached the village of Quaiiyya, consisting of a typical square-built Nejdi village surrounded by a wall, with detached walled palm groves, each containing a small &lt;j(isr for the protection of its owners, scattered up and down the valley. Dallying a short while to visit the local Emir and see the village, we continued up the valley to Mizal, about three miles up—a village similar in all respects to Quaiiyya, and surrounded, like it, by detached walled gardens. These two villages constitute the administrative and commercial centre of the Ardh group of villages, some twelve or fifteen in number, most of which are situated to the northward under the shadow of the great Idhuain Shamal. At one time the Emir of Quaiiyya, of the Beni Zeid section of the Beni Tamim, was recognised as the ruler (on behalf of the house of Saud) of the Ardh district, but the enmity of the Arrafa section of the Beni Khalid, long settled in Mizal, had necessitated a division of authority, and the district is now divided for administrative purposes into two halves, dependent respectively on the Emirs of Quaiiyya and Mizal, each of which perhaps contains a population of from 4,000 to 5,000, while some 20,000 to 25,000 would probably be something like a correct estimate of the settled population of the whole district. Mizal lies about 2,600 feet above sea-level and is about 107 miles distant from Riyadh. Beyond it we continued our march next day p)ast the little palm-surrounded village of Ibn Saadan into the depression of Quai, whose qasrs and the cultivated fields dependent thereon extend as far as the ridge of el-Jidd, which appears to be the local name of this portion of the back bone of the Ardh range. This lies north and south, from north of Idhuain Shamal, along el-Jidd to the distant ridges of Jafar and Fara to the south, of which I obtained an excellent view from the depression of the Sardah valley, which runs north and south between the main section of the Ardh range and a confused mass of foothills which lie to the west of it. The distance from Mizal to the edge of the Sardah valley was seventeen miles, the valley itself is about three miles broad, and another five miles march brought us to the end of a wide, nameless valley which separates the Ardh range from a second but generally lower range to the west of it called el-Hamra. The Ardh range, which extends some thirty-one miles in breadth from east to west and runs north and south as far as eye could see, is the first of a series of mountain ranges which constitute the highlands of Fiejd proper, and it appears that the term Nejd in its strictly geographical meaning is applicable only to this vast mountain tract, though usage has extended it to cover practically the whole territory of the Wahhabi dynasty.— 67 — The depression between the Ardh and el-Hamra system is about three miles broad, and we were soon at the other side passing np the slope of the Hamra range, a wide clearing between the foothills, thickly covered with acacia shrub, leading us in due course to a low ridge beyond which we entered the wide plain of Ruwaidha, and at a distance of ten and a half miles from our entry into the foothills pitched camp before the gates of the walled village of Ruwaidha. The Hamra range is of somewhat irregular formation, and consists of scattered groups of ridges, the more important of which run in a more or lesscontinuos line from north to south at some distance west of Ruwaidha, while smaller ridges or individual peaks dot the slope round Ruwaidah, which stands nearly 2,900 feet above sea-level and is 145 miles distant from Riyadh. The population, which may number some 2,000 souls, is mainly of the Suhul tribe, the sole remnant of the tribe in these parts, since the main body was driven out of its original haunts eastward by an invasion of the Qahtan. Like Quaiiyya and Mizal, Ruwaidha is ruled by a local Emir, and is the administrative centre of the Hamra district, which contains a number of small villages and qasrs scattered about among the hills wherever water is found. {To be continued.) ARABIA. North-West. Intell'ujence. Fakhreddin Pasha is reported to have left Medina on February 6 by a caravan route east of the railway, which he probably joined in the neighbourhood of Hediyah. It is now certain, however, that he has not gone to Syria, but is still in command of the H.E.F. A Moor from Medina, who reached Yambo on February 6 , reports that Fakhreddin is improving the town by straightening and widening the streets ; houses are pulled down without com pensation, and a women’s labour battalion has been formed to clear away the debids. Until the beginning of December fresh meat was fairly plentiful, but the Arab patrols then began to watch closely all approaches to the city, and the supply of sheep and goats ceased. In January a thousand civilians remained, but it is believed that these were all expelled early in February. A prisoner reports that the Manain tribe, in the neighbour hood of Jurf el-Derwish, are Sherifian in sentiment and, indeed, participate in Bedouin raids on the railway : but at the same time they receive money from the Turks, to whom they give warning of impending attacks. I he Manain are a more or less settled tribe, and are said to number 160 families.— 6&lt;S — [Late News .—On February 18 a party of Bedouins who were advancing against the line between Abu Naam and Stabl Antar were attacked by enemy Camel Corps under the direction of Fakhreddin and Ibn Rashid. It is believed that both sides suffered severe casualties, but the Arabs, who were outnumbered, fought well and the enemy eventually retired. Fakhreddin is now reported to have returned to Medina taking Ibn Rashid with him.] NOTES. Idrisis Campaign. Idrisi’s troops have been in occupation of Loheiyah^and Atari since February 18. Said Mustafa reports that the enemy retired leaving four killed, including an officer, and about twenty prisoners. More of the local tribes have joined Idrisi. The total enemy forces on this front recently consisted of about 2,000 Turks (most of them being in the Beni Abs country) and 2,000 to 3,000 Arabs. They held a line stretching from Loheiyah to Kufl, in the Hajur country, some fifty miles inland. The eastern part of the line was held by Arabs only. Major Reilly reports that the following sheikhs from Idrisi’s army met him off Loheiyah on January 15 : — 1 . Nasir Mabkhut. In local command before A tan, with headquarters at Gauda (three or four miles north of Atan and four miles inland from Marabiyah, the landing-place). Had with him 800 Rashid and Bekil and 600 local Arabs of the Beni Jama and Beni Mar wan. Described by Major Reilly as somewhat enfeebled, but a fine-looking old man who dominates the other sheikhs. Expressed his desire to get into touch with the British authorities at Aden. 2 . Yayha ibn Yahya esh-Shaif. Produced a letter pur porting to come from the Imam, offering him a large sum of money if he would compass the death of Idrisi; this seems to dispose of the report mentioned on page 37 . 3. Nagi ibn Ahmed esh-Shaif, nephew of ( 2 ). Wounded in the subsequent fighting. 4. Masud el-Barak {see Bulletin 61, p. 365). 5. Ahmed ibn Yayha Fara of the Dim Fara Rashid {see Bulletin 49, p. 197). 6 . Sherif Laid ibn Mohammed ibn Ashraf el-Jauf. Not known. 7- Abdullah Suleiman Habash, of the Beni Jama. 8 . Mohammed ibn Ahmed, sheikh of Habl. The commander of Idrisi’s main coastal army was Sherif Hassan abu Mismar ( ? of the Beni Shihir et-Tihama). This man impressed the British officers who met him on shore unfavourably, and his casual manner was in marked contrast with the courtesy of Nasir Mabkhut. At Medi Major Reilly interviewed Idrisi, who stated that his total forces in the field numbered about 16,000, of whom half69 — were Hashid and Bekil. Of the Beni Abs two thirds were on his side and one third with the enemy. The Turks in the Beni Abs country, numbering about 1,500 men with twenty guns, could only obtain their supplies through the Waazat tribe, from Wadi Mur, being surrounded on all other sides. The Waazat under Ahmed Basha ibn el-Heij were co-operating with the Turks in Hajur, where they were opposed by Idrisi forces under Ali ' ubran el-Ghashmi of the Hashid. Ibn el-Heij is believed to have written lately to Nasir Mabkhut, offering to desert to Idrisi if the latter supplied him with money. He appears to be at personal enmity with Ibn Thawab, who commands an Arab force with the Turks in the Abs country (see Bulletin 47 , p. 168). The Beni Jama were until lately divided between Idrisi and the enemy, but have now nearly all come over to Idrisi. Their sheikh, Ahmed Pasha, an uncle of Abdullah Suleiman Habash (see above), has been captured by the Turks and taken to the Abs country. The Beni Marwan who are with Nasir Mabkhut are said to be good fighters. Idrisi told Major Reilly that to the Hashid and Bekil he pays $13| a month per man, out of which they buy all their rations except some flour, grain or rice. To every twenty-five men there is one asif to whom $11 extra a month'are paid, and to every 200 men there is one sheikh who gets $40. Nasir Mabkhut receives $700 a month, and several of the other important sheikhs $300 or $200 each. The Hashid and Bekil sheikhs said that they trusted Idrisi and Said Mustafa—the latter is generally respected—but that the rest of Idrisi’s people were dishonest, including Sherif Hassan abu Mismar, whose business it was to distribute the rations. There is considerable ill-feeling between the hillmen and the local tribesmen, and while the former complain of the bad distribution of food, the latter are dissatisfied because they receive no pay. The Zaraniq are expected to co-operate in the near future with Idrisi (as they did in the autumn of 1915). Munasir Saghir, of Taif (about fifteen miles south of Hodeidah), one of their most important sheikhs, has sent an agent to Jeizan to discuss a plan of campaign, while Said Mustafa has been deputed to proceed to the port of Jah to meet Sheikh Hassan ibn Yahya Fashiq, chief of the southern section of this turbulent tribe. There is some reason to believe that they are acting in agreement with Sheikh Mohammed Hasan Yemen. It is reported from Aden that the Yali, accompanied by 100 Turks and 500 Arabs, is making a tour of inspection of all the court-houses in Yemen, and that Ali Said Pasha has sent an escort to Mawiyah to bring him to Lahej. Thirty camel loads of gun and rifle ammunition reached Lahej from Mawiyah in the middle of January. The Turks in Yemen appear to be— 70 — remarkably well supplied with ammunition, and deserters confirm previous reports that this is manufactured at Sanaa. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan with 400 men is said to be on his way to join Idrisi. A messenger whom the latter sent recently to the Zaraniq returned with the news that the Turks had evacuated Beit el-Faqih and Zebid. Another report states that Mohammed ibn Yahya, presumably the father of the claimant to the Imamate {see Bulletin 58, p. 324), has been bought off, and that the Imam and the Turks together are paying him $50 a day. A courier arrived at Aden on February 2 with a letter signed by Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahid, the principal sheikh of the Ibb district, Mansur ibn Ali ibn Abdullah, of Uddain, and other sheikhs of those places. The letter expressed a desire to enter into an agreement with us against the Turks. It contained the usual request for financial assistance, and an offer to hand over to us the towns of Taiz, Ibb and Mawiyah after the Turks had been ejected by the Arab forces. According to information received from a reliable source at Sanaa, the Imam’s attitude towards the Turks has changed in so far as he has refused them further supplies and money. He has also declined to dispatch Zeidi troops to the Lahej or Beni Abs fronts when requested to do so by the Turkish authorities, or to part with the two Turkish battalions placed at his disposal. It is believed at Sanaa that he has understandings with Ibn Sand and King Husein. Bias Bey (Bulletin 71, p. 480) has been appointed Kaimakam of Bajil, but it is believed that he will act for the present as Mutessarif of the sandjak of Hodeidah. Libya. Mohammed Zwiy, formerly O.C. Siwa and a strong partisan Seyyid Ahmed, deserted the latter in November 1917, and is now reported to have taken up a middle position, geographically and politically, between Mohammed Idris and Nuri. At the moment he is more friendly to Idris, and is constantly sending raiding parties against Ramadan {see page 5 ). He has some guns and machine guns, and a well organised and equipped force containing no Turkish or Syrian officers. Ajeimis Movements. A telegram from Baghdad reports that Ajeimi has left Bir Washraf, on the Darb Zubeidah, for Jumeilah (some sixty miles south), and is making for Leinah and probably Hail. Fahad ibn Dugheim of the Amarat is said to be with him. Haji Atiyah {see Bulletin 41, p. 70) who recently gave trouble and was outlawed, has remained behind in the hope of obtaining pardon from the British authorities, and is in the &lt; eseit north of the Batn with the Beni Salamah, a semi-nomad tribe of Iraq.

The morning of the 8 th day out from Riyadh found .... negotiating the continuation of the Hamra slope beyond Ruwaidha. The recent rains made the going somewhat difficult over the mixture of sand and light clay of which the surface is composed, but matters gradually improved as we approached the watershed of the Hamra system which we reached after a march of nine miles from Ruwaidha. The downward slope was now towards the west along a broad valley traversing the main line of the Hamra range, through gaps in which a distant view was obtained of the third of the Nejd ranges called Damkh running north and south beyond the Haliban valley. Proceeding down the eastward slope for about three and a half miles we reached the qasrs and cornfields of Qusuriyya, an outlying village of the Hamra district which proved to be the last habitation seen by us until we reached Khurma. Hence a o-entle rise up a pass through the Hamra range, to the south of which in the distance lay the small villages of Huhura and Sadiya,brought usin twenty minutes to the edge of the Haliban plain at the further edge of which about eleven miles away stood out the Damkh range in all its grandeur, while far to the south in continuation of the Hamra ridge appeared the great mountain mass of babha. Here the pilgrim track strikes across the plain almost due 'south-west to the wells of Haliban in a shaib of the same name which runs down the middle of the valley diagonally towards the edge of the Damkh range. The recent ram had, however, rendered us independent of wells and we marched west-south west towards an opening in the hills which we reached m tune to camp in a little hollow protected from view by low hillocks, called Samra Haliban. , .. , We were now about 2,800 feet above sea-level at a distance of 180 miles from Riyadh, and the lulls ot the Dam i iai&gt;ge towered above us perhaps some 2,000 feet or more the lofties mass of all being the Ghurur ridge at some distance to the noi , while the ridges of Nafsa and Kahila filled m the space between Ghurur and fur camp, and Farida stood somewhat to the south of our line of march, which on the following day penetrated the mime in a south-west direction along a broad clearing terminate Xfr some eighteen miles of march by the depression of Sha b O^aa rumniig north and south and forming the wester Dahqa, run „ tern. Far to the south we saw from time to time during this march an important range called Idhqan - ic ssnstn , , : y,pries of such depressions which collectively constitute the Wadi Sirra. The main channel of the latter was72 — reached some five or six miles further on, being one of the main drainage channels of the Nejd highlands which it drains south ward with a slightly south-easterl } 7 tendency into a large sand tract called Nafudh Dahi, apparently situated to the north of the Wadi Dawasir. About three miles further on we entered the Nafudh Sirra where begins a vast confused tract of sand interspersed with rocky ridges and extending westward to the edge of the Wadi Naim, which forms the boundary between the Ateibah and Subai tribes at this point, the Qahtan lying to the south of them around the mountains of Sabha, Idhqan and Hasat el-Qahtan whence they extend southward to the confines of Wadi Dawasir and into the wedge formed by the Wadi Tathlith to the south-east. The Nafudh tract, into which we now entered, extends some fifty miles or more from east to west and we camped within its borders on two nights. Various sections of it carry local names, e.g. N. Sirra in the neighbourhood of W. Sirra, N. Junaih round the hill of that name, N. Sakha round the Sakha wells, Shaib Raddadi further west and N. Bis liar a contiguous to W. A aim, while each of the many ridges which occur at irregular intervals among the sands has also a distinctive name, e.g. the Alam ridge on the eastern fringe of the Nafudh, the Zeidi range in which we camped the first night and which runs down a considerable distance to the southward, the solitary Jebel duniah, so called from the resemblance of what can be seen of the hill above the sands to the outspread wino-s of a raven, the little peaks of Mukhyat, the Idhn and Karsh ridges and a host of little ridges interlacing towards the western extremity of the sands and ending in the sand-covered ridge of Abu JNubta from which one passes into the Wadi Naim. The whole of the tract is famed among the Bedouin for its excellent grazing but enjoys a very scanty rainfall.

This proved however, to be an exceedingly easy Nafudh to negotiate, as a flat depression called Khudud traverses it in a W .S.W. direction along the hue of om march and it was not necessary to enter the actual sands un i we were within six or seven miles of. the furthei end. , ^ From this point our course followed a succession of apparently saline depressions until we emerged on to the Subai p am.

Their plan had been completely successful, but they were as relieved as we to find that our business was as innocent as theirs, and we were soon on amicable terms, but the negotiations had taken some time and we were compelled to halt for the night where we stood. The Shaqra caravan did the same and the next morning we parted on our different ways with mutual expressions of goodwill. Before long we passed out of the Nafudh on to the Subai plain, and traversing it for twelve miles in a south-westerly direction made our midday halt in the vicinity of the Rughailat mounds, a mile due west of which stood the bushes of Dhalma, as the end of the storm-channel of the Wadi Subai is called . 5 Three miles further on we reached the wells of Qunsuliya, situated close to a ruined fort dating back to the days of the great Sand. Most of the wells, about seven in number, contain water of inferior quality at about twenty to twenty-five feet below ground level, and only one of them has water suitable for human consumption. Moving now roughly parallel to the line of the Wadi Subai, discernible a ' JOut a Tn ^ e away, we continued our march over the suncracked plain, covered with a litter of dead Tarfa bushes. AH round us were obvious signs of the passage of flood water, wide local accounts attribute the destruction of what must have fromVe^i Subai ° f ^ bU8he8 to optional flood After a march of twelve miles we halted in a part of the plum known as el-Taraf, and the next day a long march of s/mt'd whirli'' ''Vl' 8 '' esl&lt; , l ' l y 'J'' e&lt;:tl ' n across a succession of visible n tt^V W Wadi S,lbai from t 1 * Harra, now wadi itself^and to'^ '! south-west, brought us into the Khurma in its bed. 6 ‘ ate I )la,ltatlons ai| d village of moment ™! 8 “werfalf lit In^TT’l '- 1 * 0 at ^ thet^^r^hf into'or’ 'the 1 ' 6 ^ 6 llei 'r e ^ COn ' ecti ™ ''i* 1 ' tribesmen with the local h' m ir o a , USe - f of the ''-vodus of the the latter had incurred the displeasure of' l ’ e ^ embracing the Wahhabi fodi i t le ^ iei M of Mecca by Wahhabi faith because hi fa T 01 '. pe , rha P s ^ embraced the and that the Sherif of Mecca hadAmn^ ? her l E ’ s dis P lea . sur e, Taraba and the Buaum tribo ‘u , lnmisslolie d the Emir of occasion offered The Diace w t ^ e re ^ s ^hurma as the place was therefore virtually in a state of— 75 — siege in the sense that no exit was allowed to its people in the direction of the Hejaz, while the warriors of the Snbai and Buqum were trying to outmanoeuvre each other in the vast plains between Qunsuliya and the Hadhu hills. This was a decidedly unwelcome piece of news to us, though the Shaqra party, which we had met in the Arjal Subai, had warned us that something was amiss. The village of Khurma is an unwalled shapeless collection of houses in the middle of an extensive plantation of date palms which stretches several miles up and down the wadi. Eastward of Khurma, in the wadi bed, lies the little plantation of Sulaimiya and eastward of the latter along the lower course of the wadi down to the D halm a lie the wells of Wutta, Hunnu, Shudhu, Hujaif, Barida and Hanifa in that order from west to east while Turaba lies south-west of Khurma in the upper reaches of the Wadi Subai (locally known as Wadi furaba at that point) at a distance of some thirty or forty miles. At Khurma itself and below it water is obtainable almost anywhere in the sandy bed of the zoadi at a depth of a few inches be ow the surface and very excellent water it is. village when fully inhabited contains perhaps some o ,000 or 6,000 inhabitants and lies about 3,000 feet above sea-level at a distance of nearly 370 miles from Riyadh, which we had traversed m fourteen days So far the iourney had thrown much valuable lighten the hydrographic problems of the central band of the peninsular, which”if^ny observations may be trusted slopes distinctly to tie routhward from a point a good many mdes north of my route from the Wadi Haiiifa on the east to the eastern edge of the Shifa plain, the slope presumably reachmg its lowest point some where in the great depression of Wadi Dawasir. nlain drains eastward into the Wadi Nairn and westward into the finds of the Arial Subai, but the drainage appears to have no MlytShrd tLfihrmdfsulli, which is Continuation of 4-1 \\r r TnroKi does not in its main channel form any pait the gr-t d^ge ^ —C The cmCaryCpCr to ^fCWaSfe smids'oftt Subai plain or m seasons of h^vy ^od again ^ ^ the Arjal Subai from n l lth f A There is however, a branch of pent-up flood to north 01 sou . , • p p 0 (f from the the Wadi Subai called S ha Cf r ^un^ream of K hurma al ,d, main u-adi several y';;Syjr e rthe Harra and ‘Hadhu collecting the drainage of ,™ ies flows out north-east through a erge -vumbe ^ “nllja, whence it joins the across the plain to a point i them limits of the Key! Shaib Jann, issuing ^ lom ,, ^r a( q e l-Kiyah and thence into highlands, and passes ommto the Wadi w y the great depression of Wadi Rumim .Roughly speaking, therefore, it would seem that the slope of the peninsula is to the north-east to north of a line drawn from south-west to north-east along and in continuation of the Shaib Shaba, while to the south of this line the slope is south wards towards Dawasir, between Wadi Hanifa and Wadi Naim, and to the west of the latter the land lies more or less level and is drained only by evaporation and absorption up to theSubai plain. Leaving Khurma before sunrise on December 23, we reached the edge of the Shaib Shaba after a seven miles’ march slightly to the north of west over the Tarif plain, and thus crossed the boundary between the Subai and Buqum tribes. Henceforth our course lay through broken country scored by numerous broad shaibs thickly covered with acacais through which we moved in momentary fear of coming upon bands of either tribe out on business. From time to time we saw parties moving about in the distance and made detours to avoid any possibility of coming into contact with them. In this we were successful throughout the day eventually camping in the Shaib Qurainat several miles short of the Hadhu range after covering twenty-five miles from our entry into the Shaib Shaba. Next day we resumed our march soon after 5 a.m. and after covering some three and a half miles entered the Hadhu range, the main mass of which extended to the far distance southward of our course, which lay through a tangled mass of sand-strewn ridges detached from the main range and known as the Barqa, Two miles on we crossed the acacia-covered shaib in which about a mile to our left lay the wells of Burain. Proceeding thence along a broad valley we found to our dismay on topping a low lidge that we were right in the middle of the Buqum tribes whose flocks and camels occupied the plain ahead as far as we could see. They were equally surprised to see us and made their concern evident by their frantic efforts to drive off their flocks to either side in order to leave the coast clear for the expected , 0ur I however, rode forward with some ot the Harb and Ateibah of our party to allay the fears our sudden arrival had aroused and, satisfactory explanations having ' jeen given we were soon passing through the midst of their flocks and herds, the valley making a beautiful picture with the sheep and camels among the Bedouin tents in a setting of sandy i S,CaCia Sbrubs bl ' oke11 P^ches of verdure, the result or lecent rams. twent^'in'l tbG ^ bl&lt;blu ran &amp; e f rom east to west was about Heiaz^hill ( f. a on ^ °ep westerly course, distant views of the rido-es of thp^Bn^V^ u 6111 ^ ° bta ^ ne ? as we , ’ ose a hove the last the^broad nl d ' ^ l '° ,n ^hch h&gt; due course we entered Hadhu ^-nno; on SO,,tl ' betweeu tlle . trie east and the Heiaz ranges to the west for some Ten nflhs ,b( \ bak,)a P lam hi a south-westerly direction Ateibah in whosp ’ P aS81ri § 011 the way numerous camps of the e h, 111 Wh ° Se ran S e n °w ^und ourselves once more, weCamped for the night of Christmas Eve in the open. ^ On Christmas morning, the 17th day from Riyadh, we rose at 3.45 a.m. and, leaving our baggage animals and about half our party behind to come on at leisure, the rest of us covered the remaining thirty miles of the Rakba plain in about six hours of rapid trotting and drew rein only at the edge of the W adi Aqiq, flowing here north-eastward along the edge of the foothills of Hejaz. At the edge of the wadi lay the palm groves and terraced fields of the little village of Ekhaidar, passing which and bearing south-south-west to south we hastened as fast as the broken nature of the ground permitted, up rough ravines lying along the course of the Wadi Aqiq, over boulder-strewn ground gradually rising in level, and past little villages m the hollows, until shortly before 4 p.m. we entered a short narrow pass from the summit of which we looked down on the lair valley of fait m its magnificent setting of mountains outlined against the setting snn. 6 Descending the southern slope of the pass we followed the upward slope of the valley past little viHages surrounded by orchards until we reached the great white palace of bhubra standing sentinel over the approaches to the • Here ^ were met by a guard of honour sent out by the local Lmn, an moved in procession through wondering crowds to the northern entrance of Taif, whence we were conducted to the house of the Emir Shurta or chief of the Police, there to be enter atnedwi h lavish hospitality and genuine cordiality, on behalf of the E , bv the Emir Shurta and his establishment during our sta). b} We had now arrived at our destination, having covered r»“ £ 3?;; i ^ the lap of luxury, for all too short a period as it subsequently turned out to our dismay .

Of the 10,000 rifles given him by the Turks a large proportion have passed into the hands of anti-Rashid tribes. The people of Hail dislike the Emir intensely, and are adverse to his military service ; nevertheless, if Hail was attacked they would rally to him and defend the city.

The majority of them are living in great distress, especially the women and children, who are miserably clad against the bitter cold. Many of the children are almost naked, an suffering much from the lack of any medical treatment iwo cases of children going blind owing to neglect were brought before the British Medical Officer.

Badr Rumaiyidh also came m to us at Nasiriyah in 1915, but became hostile after the fall of Kut. The northern section of the Dhafir (Bulletin 44, p. 118) who occupy the desert south of Samawah and Khidr has now come within the sphere of our influence. Lizam ibn Dhiraa, the chief of this section, has a feud of long standing with our ally, Hamud ibn Suweit, the nominal paramount sheikh of the whole tribe. Lizam will not consent to a reconciliation with Hamud, but undertakes to prevent the passage of supplies to Ajeimi. Ajeimi’s southward movement, reported in the last Bulletin, was due partly to the impossibility of obtaining supplies from the Euphrates, and partly to the difficulty of keeping in touch with the Turks owing to the attitude of the Anazeh. It is reported that fighting took place at the end of last year between sections of the Duleim and the Shammar, and that the following of ISFigris ibn Qaud deserted him. Nigris is the chief sheikh of the Bu Nnnr section of the Duleim who inhabit the Gezirah between Ramadi and Hit, and has recently thrown in his lot with the Turks. Fahad ibn Hadhdhal of the Amarat is at present sixty miles south of Shethata, at the junction of Wadis Tabal and Ubaiyidh. His camels are in poor condition, but grazing will now improve as abundant rains have fallen. Githwan ibn Murshid of the Sibaa is at Qaarah, and Mujhim ibn Muheid of the Fedan at Shaib Aghani, fifty miles further south. It appears that Feisal ibn Ferhan (see Bulletin 59 , p. 343 ), who visited Mecca last August has but little influence with his tribe, the Jerba Shammar, and his plan of co-operating with the British has accordingly been abandoned. Abdel Aziz ibn Ferhan and his son Ajil Laser, being jealous of Feisal, refused to join him and have now returned to northern Mesopotamia,NOTES. Somaliland. The position of the Mullah’s Haroun remains unchanged at Tale. Most of his animals are in very poor condition owing to the continued drought. Two Dervish forces are believed to be concentrated for an attack on our friendlies, one in the Jidali district, the other at Walwal and Wardair. At the beginning of December Ena Ali Sherri concentrated a large force of Warsangeli and attacked the Dervish stock grazing in the Surud hills. A severe engagement ensued in which the raiders lost 150 killed and the Dervishes about 100. The Warsangeli, however, brought back some 300 head of cattle. A settlement of all outstanding questions between the Ogaden (Bulletin 57, p. 317) and our western tribes was effected in December, but unfortunately the Ogaden Her Ali have subsequently not only declined to carry out the terms of the settlement, but have again raided our tribes and taken 6,000 camels. It is also doubtful whether the Ogaden Rer Haroun will abide by the settlement. Yemen. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan reports that the majority of the Yemen sheikhs are favourable to Idrisi. It is reported _ from Aden that the Imam is sending reinforcements to Lahej, and from Kameran that he is proceeding personally against Idrisi. The Kathiri Sultan has asked Ah Said 1 asha for assistance against the Sultan of Makalla.

It is strong y held bv the Turks, but the Arabs are apparently making pnW They also claim a success m the Abs country on March 2.Ji r MB*? himABYSSINIA. It is reported that Lij Yasu has occupied Batye, south of Ankober. His force probably numbers from 500 to 1,000 men, including the Danakil chief Abubuker. At Adis Abeba httle interest is shown, and up to the first week of February no force had been sent against him. Preparations have been made for au expedition to the north to reinstate lias Wolye, whose Wollo subjects have proclaimed a republic in Edju and elsewhere (see p. 39). No attempt lias been made to divert a part of this force against Lij Yasu ; in fact it is possible that the expedition may never start at all, in spite of the fact that Dejazmach Balcha and other chiefs have come expressly from their provinces with their armies. An Abyssinian officer whose information is trustworthy states that luj Yasu could have been capture'! with comparative ease in the early days at Magdala (see Bulletin 45, p. 138), but the chiefs Bas Demisse, Dejaz Marid and others, who were his friends, made no attempt to fulfil their duty. After his defeat at Dessie in August, 1917, Lij Yasu retreated into the desert, where he was ill and unable to move for t/wo months, at a, spot not more than five days from Ankober. The officer referred to urged Ras laffari to send and capture the Prince, but the former would not act, although he knew that there can be no peace for the country while Lij Yasu is at large, and there are many who openly declare that they would welcome his return to power. t Officers who were with Lij Yasu until lorced to leave mm by want of food state that the Prince is determined, on the resumption of power, to invite the Germans to undertake the protectorate of Abyssinia with himself as ruler. If the expedition to the north is cancelled it will be another instance of the manner in which the interests of the people are subordinated to those of the Ministers, who refuse to recognise that the welfare of the country is being sacrificed to their seltish aims and intrigues. When the idea o£ the expedition was mooted, parties were found for and against Ras fattaiis departure in command. Gradually the foimei paity game streno-th as it was realised that it was an excellent opportunity to get rid of the Ras ; and it is said that the Empress even offered him the Negusship of the north in Negus Michael s plice. Ras Taffari saw through this and ordered all the Ministers to accompany him on the expedition, whereupon they accomplished a volte face, and decried the expedition as a waste of time and m0ne fn Adis Abeba the Ministers and Chiefs are mainly against Ras Taffari, whom they accuse to the Empress of usurping her power and of enriching himself at the Government s expense by Em private commissions. It is true that he takes commission , but on the other hand he gives generously ^ * e may be that he is thus gaining popularity with the lower classes.— 84 The only man who stands aloof from these intrigues is Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis. It was believed at one time that he would be made Prime Minister with a full measure of power, but probably he has refused to take office until he sees how the situation is likely to develop. The Government is supposed to be short of money and ammunition. The cartridge factory has remained closed for months owing to a quarrel with the Director, and even if it reopens there is only sufficient material for 100,000 cartridges. The shortage of ammunition, however, would not in itself prevent the Abyssinians from resisting invasion, as the soldiers are willing to go into action with a mere handful of cartridges, trusting in their swords and clubbed rifles. A Treasury official recently admitted the shortage of money as well ; but he added that the treasure buried at the Gebbi by the Emperor Menelik remained intact, and was to be used for the purchase of goods for the army in the event of invasion. Fighting has taken place in Tigre, and lias Seyyum and lias Guksa, the two principal Tigrean chiefs who have been detained in Adis Abeba for months past, have left for then- provinces. Reports from Tigre are contradictory as usual ; the last is that Dejaz Kassa attacked his uncle by order of Ras Taffari and defeated him. Owing to raids made by the Danakils in Italian territory, the Eritrean Government sent troops to the border, and the Italian Minister at Adis Abeba warned the Abyssinian Govern ment that he would hold them responsible for the consequences. About two months ago a Danakil force attacked the Italians and were utterly defeated, a hundred of them being killed including an Abyssinian Fitaurari. lias Taffari has expressed his unqualified regret to Count Colli, but is obviouslv incapable of controlling the Danakils. Abyssinia is more than ever in a state of chaos, and perhaps the principal cause is the dual control of the Empress and the Ras, from which the intrigues of the Ministers spring. Pas Taffari, though patriotic, is too weak to carry the Ministers with him. He would probably like to relinquish his post and retire to the quiet of Harrar, were he not obstinate enouo-h to desire to see the end.PALESTINE LETTER. loth March, 1918. Deportations. As showing how the deportation of the Arab population is being carried out by the enemy the following Orders obtained from the late Mudir of Jericho are of interest. 1 . Each Division will select a Military Committee, which is to co-operate with the Elders and Mukhtars. '2. Ten days rations will be issued to each person. The population will only take with them such cattle as have young or are long in calf. The remainder of their possessions and cattle will be transported later by the military authorities, and receipts taken from the Elders of the villages will be kept. 3 . The transport of household effects being at present impossible, these must be collected and a depot opened in each village. These effects will be forwarded later. A few villagers must be left behind to guard these. 4 . Pillaging to be punished with death. 5. The population must move to Jenin by mule tracks between the Jordan and the Nablus road. The Mudir of Jericho is responsible for their safety and must telegraph to Jenin the number of persons coming there. The Turks and Zionism.

On March 6 a large number of livestock was brought in and many Arabs from the Bir Saba and Khan Tunis tribes were present: Jaffa Area. During the past week a meeting at which about sixty of the chief Moslem and Christian inhabitants were present was convened at Jaffa. Six Christians and as many Moslems were appointed to establish a committee to further Moslem and Christian interests on the same lines as the Jewish Committee. A petition has been addressd to the Military Governor, Jaffa, on the subject. Economic. The general fall in the price of tood and commodities continues. The Egyptian note continues to fluctuate. Turkish silver and nickel are still being bought up for clandestine trade with the north. Jewish Politics. The scheme of the Jerusalem Zionists, under the leadership of Mr. Hoofien and Dr. Thon, to weld all sections of the Jewish Community into one strong united body is reported to be making headway, in spite of the opposition of a section of the Askenazim Jews. The Zionist scheme involves the election of a Jewish Central Representative Committee of forty-three members of all Jewish rites, whose duty it would be to collect all sums subscribed abroad and distribute them to the deserving poor, and also to promote and assist industrial and other organisations, gradually abolishing the old system of promiscuous relief. The opposition consists mainly of Orthodox Askenazim Jews of Austro-Hungarian origin, who dislike the idea of unification either lor social reasons—the Orthordox Askenazim considering themselves socially superior to the Sephardim—or because, the greater part of the funds sent from abroad being contributed by Askenazim congregations, the Sephardim would benefit by what was not intended for them.— H7 — ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. A report has been received from Sherif Zeid of an engage ment near Kalaat-el-Hasa on February 25, between a small force of Arabs and a German cavalry patrol, in which the enemy was eventually forced to withdraw with a loss, according to the report, of thirty men killed. At the beginning of March considerable enemy forces, which had been concentrating at Kerak, Hasa and Jurf ed-Derwish, left those places and marched in the direction of Fafila, which they occupied about a week later. I heir advance was delayed by the energetic action of Zeid’s Huweitat and Beni Sakhr, who harassed their lines of communication. I he Sherifians, however, were unable to withstand the attacking columns, which were estimated at three Turkish infantry battalions, two squadrons of Mule Mounted Infantry and a few German infantry and cavalry, with eight guns and two machine-gun companies. On the 10 th, Sherif Zeid telegraphed that after heavy fighting, his army had been obliged to evacuate Tafila and had taken up a defensive line at Shobek. On March 3 and 5, Kalaat el-Aneizeh was bombed by British aeroplanes, and several successful raids have been made on enemy encampments and concentrations along the railway. On the 7 th Maan was bombed by four aeroplanes, and direct hits were made on the engine sheds and telegraph station. herif Abdullah's Operations.

Their losses in men are not known, but the Turks are said to have had forty-six killed. In the fighting near Bir Jedid on February 8 (see page 55) the Turks lost fourteen killed and nine prisoners. On February 23, Major Davenport wrote that Ibn Rashid was in Wadi Um Hashim, near Hediyah, and was Hying a flag similar to that of the Sherif, whereby he had entrapped several Bedouins. He had about 200 mounted men with him. The Turks were reported to have established a Darb el-Arab (Arab Bureau) at Melayha, one day’s journey east of Jebel Ohod and were paying Bedouins at the high rate of L.T. 20 a month. They had already enrolled 400 of the Huteim. Most of the Juheinah had disappeared from Abdullah’s camp and were said to be dissatisfied with him ; according to a later report, they have made an organised raid on his supply dump. This was doubtless done as a protest and to secure the payment of their salaries which are said to be in arrears. There are indications that enemy efforts to seduce the Bedouins from their allegiance to King Husein are meeting with a certain measure of success, but the distribution of gold is the most effective form of propaganda which either side can undertake. Major Davenport telegraphs that Sherif Abdullah ibn 1 hawab, one of the best of the Bedouin Commanders, made a successful attack on Jedaha on March 12 , capturing prisoners and camels. General. Sherif Ieisal’s army was recently estimated at about 18,000 men apart from trained troops. It included 5,500 of the Beni Sakhr (Zebn, Chaabineh, Ibn Zuheir and Khurshan sections), 3,000 Huweitat (Abu layi, Ibn Jazi, Naimat and minor sections), 1,200 Ageyl (from Central Arabia), 2,300 Beni Atiyah, 700 Serahin and 600 Druses. In addition there were some 3,500 of* the Tafila and Kerak Arabs and about 1,500 from other small tribes. t - i o ~ Abdullah tbere were about 2,000 Ateiba, 3,00( Juhemah, 2,500 Anazeh, and small sections numbering 300-50C each ot the Hai-b, Huteim and Moahib. The actual numbers non m the held are probably less than half the above, which represem potential strengths. Sheiif Ali usually has about 7,000 Bedouins in the field drawn exclusively from the Harb and Ateiba. From All’s camp it is reported that 500 refugees who hac been expel ed from Medina have arrived at Bir el-Mashi; and that the railway from Medina to Bowat is nearly clear of Turkish troops. JNOTES. Libya. It is reported by the Italian Government that a force of three native battalions, three squadrons, two batteries, and armoured cars is being concentrated at Ghemines with the object of assisting Mohammed Idris. There are reports from several sources to the effect that Idris is collecting all the troops in Eastern Oyrenaiea, Dor el- Abiar and Bu Gouge and moving them westward. He has instructed his new Commander-in-Chief, Said Safi ed-Din (Bulletin 58, p. 327), to raise levies in Western Cyrenaica. Seyyid Ahmed is said to be at Gakhleba, sixty miles south west of Gedabia.

They also had a strong position and a big gun at Beit Makhai. The Idrisi troops held Jaburiyah, from which place they bombarded Atari. Severe fighting was reported in this neighbourhood on February 7. Yusuf Hassau, Kaimakam of Loheiyah, and Bah jet Bey, Kaimakam of Zaidiyah, were endeavouring to raise recruits among local tribes such as the Zaalia and Boajia, but their efforts were unsuccessful, the Arabs demanding pay and supplies which the Turks were unable to provide. The Boajia, who live south of Loheiyah, were more disposed to join Idrisi. He had already won over the Masaraha, and the following sheikhs of the Beni Yam (see Bulletin 71, p. 477) were reported to be on their way to join him ; Mohammed ibn Ali el-Izzi, Sultan Hassan ibn Munif, Sheikh Hassan ibn Jabri ibn Juman, and Sheikh Jabir ibn Mana ibn Jabir. These sheikhs were believed to have with them 1,200 tribesmen, 400 camels and thirty horses. On February 4 fighting took place in the direction of Hajur.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.— 91 PALESTINE LETTER. 18th March, 1918. The occupied territory undoubtedly is settling down. The peasants of the Ramleh area have succeeded (much to their credit considering the shortage of draught animals) in sowing eighty per cent of their lands, and the crops of all kinds promise very well, the “latter rains” having come up to time and abundantly. We hear of something like normal conditions re-established in the south also, the weekly market at Beersheba being well attended, both by tribesmen and by villagers from the Khan Yunus area, and showing a very fair head of live stock for sale. Agricultural conditions are not so good in the Jerusalem district, where the enemy was given more time to carry off draught cattle ; but a good deal has been done to help the peasantry there, especially by provision of seed, and the recent abundant rains have fa\ ouied late sowings. Unfortunately there has been much damage done to plantations and vineyards, partly by the enemy’s action, partly by destruction of stone walls, which admits of goats getting at the trees. It is asked that barbed wire should be provided by us to replace these walls, the removal of which has mainly been due to our own road-makers. As regards public security there is not much to complain of in the occupied area. _ As for towns, the food problem still gives trouble in Jerusalem, there being a great many destitute P” ot ^ denominations. Our official distribution of food payment—a wise condition in the case of a parasitic and hoar g population which must be induced to use its own resources- LYit is understood that provision for destitute persons ,s to be undertaken by the different religious co ™Tonoh tte however, plead shortness of cash, an , cun y ' ,' ^ Tewish community not the least loudly, m spite .

Returning refugees, e.g. the Armenians, are also creating economic problems which demand solution. Public security, however, has so far improved that the hour at which all citizens must be at home has been put later: but it is probable that further restrictions on domestic lighting will have to be imposed in the interests of shipping. The people seem alive to most of the tricks and methods of popular government and are fertile in complaints and deputations. Their minds are much exercised at present about coming taxation, the fish tax, assigned to the Ottoman Public Debt, being particularly obnoxious to them. No change, however, can be made in that, under the international principle of carrying on occupied territory pending a peace settlement. The question of collecting arrears of Ottoman taxes for the Turkish year 1333, however, is different, and the case put forward that, owing to extraordinary exactions by the enemy before his evacuation, and the abandonment of so many houses, these arrears ought to be written off, may be listened to. On the whole, political officers report a distinct improve ment in public feeling. There is, however, a considerable malcontent element among the Moslem inhabitants who are divided in aims, some desiring to live in future under a Turkish suzerainty, others under a Sherifian, of whose advent they seek a sign. The former party is strongest in the towns, the latter in the villages and among nomads. All are apprehensive of what oui Government and the future may hold in store for the Zionists, and there is no doubt nothing hampers so greatly our local relations with the existing non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine, as the vagueness of our declaration in favour of Zionism. It is idle to suppose that any one in possession can feel at his ease in a .Promised Land ! from the enemy side of the lines come many reports of great shortage not onlv of food, but of clothes, boots and other necessaries. n Mid-Syria the Government requisition has amoune o iom thirty-seven to fifty per cent of the cereal Crops, fpf k 1,1068 . aie very high, an oke of sugar, for example, etchmg from sixty to 100 piastres.

On the retreat of Sherif Zeid’s forces, reported in the last Bulletin, the Turks occupied Rashidia, two hours south of Tafila. They did not advance south of this on the Shobek road, and the detachment at Rashidia withdrew, alter a short stay, to Towane. The greater part of the enemy troops are believed to have left the neighbourhood of Tafila for the north, and on March 16 Sherif Nash* left Shobek with the object of reoccupying Rashidia and Tafila. Southern Area. No operations are reported in the neighbourhood o£ Medina. Sherif Ali’s inactivity is explained partly by the indifferent state of his health, and partly by the fact that his Syrian and baglidadi officers are usually opposed to any proposal for action. An officer prisoner captured in December 1917, states that no supplies were then reaching Medina from Hail.

In a letter written on January 15 from the Ghunaimi country, Kadi Atik ibn Ahmed Bakar of Behan [see Bulletin 35 p. 541) mentions having met in the course of his travels a certain beyyid Abdel Ban el-Ahdal, a former agent of the Imam. This notable, who had with him seven Zeidi military leaders, had lately deserted the Imam on account of the latter’s friendship with the lurks. I he sheikhs and tribesmen of the Ghunaimi country have resolved to cease payment of tithes to the Imam and to promote a rising against him. ^? di y ik further reports that the son of Seyyid Mohammed el-Hadi and presumably the claimant to the Imamate—intends the Pa ilhn V&gt; M 1 Ade a ' Vlt ' 1 . e ‘ ters fr 01 ” ! »is father and certain of the Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Husein sheikhs.

Ihese positions were bombed and machine-gunned by seaplanes on the 23rd, while some skirmishing took place between Arabs and lurks The latter had a gun at Beit Makhai, two miles noitn or Jebel Kudmieh, which held up the very half-hearted advance of the Arabs. On March 3 bombs were dropped on Zahiran, m consequence of which the local Arabs wished to surrender, but Ismail Bey, the Turkish commander, prevented them from doing so. It was now decided to give up the idea of taking Jebel Kudmieh by storm, and to surround it and starve out the garrison When the “ Fox ” left Loheiyah on March 5 the encircling movement, as reported on page 81, was progressing favourably, the chief obstacles being the Turkish posts at Beit Makhai and Beit Ahmed Pasha. Of Seyyid Mustafa Idnsi, Captain WVfllaston, R.N., writes : U The long hours of hard and exasperating work and the responsibility of his position might have been expected to tell their tale in his appearance or unflagging good humour, but little trace of such effects was noticeable. The greater part of the time he spent ashore at A tan, which he visited nearly every day, and in his rudely extemporized headquarters there or at Loheiyah he was continually writing, organizing, or exhorting his men, who seem to love and respect him and honestly try to follow his wishes and obey his instructions.” According to a deserter, the Turkish headquarters are at Jarb, from where supplies are distributed, and between Jarb and Jebel Kudmieh there is a Turkish post at Abu Karsh, in the Waazat country. Twelve hundred of the Beni Yam (see p. 90) are reported to have arrived at Medi on February 12. The news of the capture of Loheiyah has given much satisfaction throughout the Yemen, and it is expected that other tribes will rally to Idrisi. An Aden telegram of March 22 reports that his followers continue to increase and now include some of the Wayidat tribe. East African Natives. In connection with the spread of Pan-African or Pan- Islamic propaganda in East Africa, it would be interesting to ascertain what is the attitude of the great numbers of native porters who have been employed during the campaign. These men have been forced to serve in a cause about which they are ignorant and indifferent. “ In the course of this experience,” writes Major Foster, of the King’s African Rifles, “they have observed that a negro can wield the special weapons of the European with a degree of efficiency comparable to that of the European himself. They have seen these weapons turned by their own people against white men, and without doubt the particular respect in which the lives of Europeans were held bythem has already been weakened. The numerical inferiority of the whites has been demonstrated and they are for the most part incapable of realising that this inferiority is merely local. It is reasonable to believe that these are the views likely to be held by the repatriated native, and bearing in mind that he will have money enough to support himself in idleness for a considerable time, a very promising field for the spread of Anti- European propaganda will be created. It is on this account that the large numbers of repatriated natives will require careful observation, and arrangements to this end have been made.” Similar news will no doubt be spread by the native soldiers when they return to their homes in various parts of Africa. Turkish Liberals. Turks in Switzerland who are members of the new “ Society of Peace and Progress” are endeavouring to get into touch with the Arabs in Hejaz. Their avowed policy is the overthrow of the Unionist regime, which is represented as imposing its programme of bloodshed and massacre on the reluctant Turks. The representative of the society in Switzerland is Kemal Midhat Bey, who predicts the imminent collapse of Ottoman power. Personalities in Turkey. It is reported that Jemal Pasha No. II. has replaced Ahmed Jemal Pasha as Governor-General of Syria, and has taken a house for his family at Beirut. Ahmed Jemal acted as Minister of the Intelior during the absence of 1 alaat at the Russian peace negotiations, Enver acting as Grand Vizier. The ex-Khedive was staying at the Pera Palace Hotel, Constantinople, in January last. The local Eo’vntinns cravp bim Meccan News. Abyssinia. eba reports that Negus Waldi tuation in northern Abyssinia iscausing grave anxiety. It is feared that the provinces of the late Negus may adhere to Ras Seyyum’s son, who is in revolt against his father in Tigre. On March 21, according to a later report, 700 chiefs unanimously resolved to demand the dismissal of the Council of Ministers. They intend to approach the Empress in conjunction with the Abuna. Jebel Shammar. A Bedouin who deserted from Ibn Rashid at the end of January reports that about 1,500 of the Hail townsmen are armed, and about 2,500 pro-Rashid tribesmen. Both the townsmen and the Shammar are loyal to the Emir, but they both dislike the Turks and object to his pro-Turkish policy. This informant does not believe that any of the Shammar have gone over to Ibu Saud, but they have no desire for conquest outside the Jebel. The Ikhwan propaganda has not hitherto spread to Hail, and .the fact that it emanates from Ibn Saud would militate against its success there. Libya. Mohammed Idris is believed to be at Suetina, where Italian instructors are training his men in the handling of mountain and machine guns recently received from the Italians.

Mohammed Salih, the coastguard deserter.— 99 — » A JOURNEY ACROSS ARABIA FROM UQAIR TO JIDDAH. III. Taif to Jlddah. Situated at an elevation of some 5,100 feet above sea-level in nn oval shaped valley set north-east by south-west in the eastern foothills of the Hejaz mountains, Taif is essentially a sanatorium or summer health resort for the inhabitants of Mecca. The valley is traversed by three mountain torrents, namely, the Wijh, which descends from one of the mountains of the Hejaz range called Barad and flows past Taif itself, the Aqiq, w r hich descends from a lower ridge called Ghuwair and, passing through the suburb of Aqiq, is joined by the Wijh below, i.e, north of Shubra, and finally the Qaim, which waters the lower or northern section of the valley and joins the Aqiq low 7 er down in the foothills. The combined streams flow north-eastward under the single name of Aqiq, eventually issuing out of the foothills on to the Rakba plain at the village of Ukhaidhar and continuing to Ashaira on the Hajj route from the Qasim and even—if local legend speak true—to Medina in years of heavy flood. Round the valley, which extends about six miles from north to south and two from east to west at its broadest part, stands a fringe of low ridges, beyond which to the south and south-west runs the main range of the Hejaz mountains Qarnait and Barad being the highest visible points—while north and east are the eastern foothills, or Manahi as they are called. Within the valley itself stand a considerable number of isolated mounds and low hills and ridges, in the interstices between which are the villages and orchards which make Taif famous. The town of Taif itself is situated in a broad open space about two-thirds of the way up the valley, i.e. towards its southern extremity, and is of no great size, consisting perhaps of not more than 500 houses, of which quite a disproportionate number are fine villas of white masonry mostly empty at the time of my visit and tenanted only during the summer months. Square m shape, the town is surrounded by the ruins of what was once a wall, each side of which is about 300 yards long. At the mg _The distances given in this and my previous notes must be understood to be entirely provisional pending the final working out ot my results and their adjustment to established positions. For the section between Ruwaidha and Shaib Qurainat on the eastern edge of the Hadhu ranoe, the rate of three and three-quarter miles per hour was adopted by the ^Survey authorities at Cairo owing to some confusion m my notes ; this is obviously too high a rate and greatly exaggerates the distance actually traversed. I think a rate of three miles per hour woMd ^ ^ the mark; some fifty-seven miles should therefop be d^ distance noted between these points and the total distant to Taif should be reduced to about 707 miles.)100 north-west corner stands a fine old fort, which suffered a certain amount of damage during the bombardment of the town by the forces of Sherif Abdullah in the opening stages of the Shet ifian campaign, while beyond it, just outside the walls, aie the large low square-built barracks, similarly damaged and now used only as a stable for camels. Outside the southern wall stands the white mosque of Abdullah ibn Abbas, whose remains and those of two of the Prophet’s relatives, namely Abdullah el-Taiyib el-Tahir and Mohammed el-Hanafi are buried in the mosque precincts and are venerated by pilgrims. A quaint suq runs through the town from north to south, but at this time of the year it presents a somewhat desolate appearance, and practically nothing is procurable in it but local products. The Sherif’s palace and courthouse are in ruins, having been reduced to that state by the Turks while they held the town, but most of the other villas are in fairly good order as the town was apparently not promiscuously bombarded by Abdullah’s artillery. West of the town are the suburbs of Qarwa and Salama, containing a number of fine villas belonging to Mecca merchants ; south of it lie Matina, Huwaiya and Shahar, also consisting mainly of villas and orchards ; east is the dilapidated slum of el-Yumana, inhabited entirely by mendicants from Yemen ; northward lies the magnificient six-storeyed Shubra palace, the property of Ali Pasha, situated at the edge of the best garden of the valley, through which runs the perennial stream of Ain, which apparently rises at the foot of the Barad mountain and flows past Taif in an underground aqueduct to the southern extremity of the Shubra gardens where it emerges above ground. Round Shubra are a number of villages, Aqiq to the west and Umm el-Khubz, Hizam, Qamla and Milaisa to the east and north-east, while further down to the north-west are the scattered hamlets of Qaim. Taif has three gates still standing in remnants of the old wall, whose ruins as a matter of fact now- give access to the town on all sides. Of the old gates the Bab el-Sell faces north, the Bab el-Ri west and the Bab ibn Abbas opens southward towards the mosque. The total permanently resident population of Taif and its suburbs cannot, I think, exceed some 5,000 souls, but this number would doubtless be doubled at least by the annual summer influx of visitors, whose numbers have apparently largely fallen off during the war—the Sherif and his nearer relations have discontinued their visits since the Arab campaign opened. Arriving at Taif late in the afternoon of Christmas Day, I was content during the next tw T o days to abandon myself to the enjoyment of the hospitality of Sherif Hamud, the acting Emir, and his officials, and very pleasant it w T as to us all after our recent strenuous exertions to take our ease in the little earthly paradise of the vale of Taif, partaking of its abundant fruits and101 of its cheese and milk and honey and wandering in its gardens, the like of which my companions at least had never seen before. Time, however, was precious, and on the morning of December 28, in response to a message from Mecca, I said good bye to my genial hosts, and leaving half my party behind to await my return, set out on the last stage of my journey, confident—alas on insufficient grounds—that I should revisit Taif before returning to the desert. Issuing from the town by the Bab el-Seil we retraced our steps of three days back to Shubra, and thence diverged from our previous route in the direction of Qaim, the first of whose hamlets we reached in rather less than an hour after leaving Taif. us am and a which Wadi We now descended a short rocky pass into the Qaim valley, and passing the remaining hamlets thereof, left the little village of Marisia nestling in the rocks on our right, and the village of liaghadh similarly placed on our left. Crossing the Qaim wadi at this point, we debouched on to a broad open space between the Raihab ridge on our left, and the Qunna ridge on our right, and travelling almost due north crossed the Shaib Judaira about seven miles from Taif, the village of the same name lying about a mile to our right. We now left the area of habitations and cultivation behind struck across the sloping plain north-eastward for three half miles until we reached the cross ridge of Qumai, runs down from the western hills eastward towards the Aqiq on our right and forms the watershed of the foot hills, the wadis southward of this point all running down into the Wadi Aqiq and so discharging into the eastern plain, while the complicated ravine system lying to the north of die ridge trends north-eastward for a space and bends^ round again north west, until it finally discharges into the Seil el-Kabir, and so in rliiG course into the grent westward dnunno,^ channel of tie Wadi Fatima. , Crossing the Qumai ridge by a short steep pass called Hi el- Wudaira we descended into a maze of boulder-strewn ravines thickly covered with acacias, the Shaib Aneizah leading into the Shaib Rajifa and this into the considerable torrent bed of the Seil el-Saghir four miles beyond the Qumai ridge. L ie Seil el-Saffiiir—a tributary of the Seil el-Kabir runs north east and Its sandy bed is thickly covered with vegetation betokening an ample supply'of water, which is, as a matter of fact, of excellent quality and available m abundance at a dept of a few inches beneath the surface. * ., , Cross!m&gt;- the Seil el-Saglnr we ascended the Naha ridge, and turuino- to the north-west twisted and turned among the narrow passao-es between the foothills which closed m on ns from every side until we emerged into the broad torrent bed of the Shaib Talah down which we proceeded north-east for a short space. Turning out of it up a narrow ravine leading north-west we soon reached the formidable pass of Ri el-Manhut, having covered— 102 four miles since issuing from the Sell el-Saghir. 1 he ravine here is entirely barred by a wall of rock, up which a paved way has been constructed leading to a narrow passage either hewn or blasted through the solid rock. Above this passage on the hill side stand the remains of a fort, built apparently long ago to defend the pass against an enemy, but now in ruins, and beyond the passage the road descends into the Shaib Raqad by a broad paved roadway similar to that on the other side. The Hi el- Manhut is certainly a position of immense defensive possibilities and forms a very picturesque gateway to the sacred land of the Hejaz. Proceeding between the high rocky cliffs which form the sides of the Shaib Raqad we turned westward up a ravine called Seil el-Ghurban, about one and a half miles further down, and a few yards further on ascended the steep pass of Ri el-Zallala up which the going over large smooth boulders is precarious for camel traffic. The summit of the pass gave us a magnificent glimpse of the hills beyond the Seil el-Kabir, which we soon reached after negotiating the steep descent from the Ri el- Zallala. The Seil el-Kabir, where we halted for the night, is about twenty-two miles almost due north from Taif, being a wide torrent-bed running from west to east through a wide circular gap in the surrounding mountains. Westward a narrow gap in the main barrier of the Hejaz hills marks the point where the Wadi Yamaniya flows out towards the Tihama ; eastward stands * a range which turns back the waters of the Seil north-eastward towards the Wadi Fatima and over which passes the main route to Ashaira ; southward lay the foothills through which we had wended our way during the day, while north of us lay the broad plain of Buhaita sloping down on the west to the Jusumain gap of the Wadi Yamaniya and northwards towards a tumbled mass of foothills which contain the upper reaches of the Wadi Fatima. By the side of the wadi stands a miserable little village called Seil and a few huts belonging to the Sherif, in which we lodged for the night, marking the point at which all pilgrims from the direction of Nejd assume their Ihram garments if bound for Mecca. We had descended some 1,800 feet during the day, the village of Seil being situated at an elevation of 3,370 feet above sea-level. The following morning we marched in a north-easterly direction over the Buhaita slope for three and a half miles, when we reached the Sunfara ridge, crossing which we reached the entrance of the Wadi Haradha a mile further on. Here we re-enteied^ the hills and followed the line of the broad wadi between high banks of bare rock for four miles when the Wadi Bash, which is thelocal name of the lower reachesof the Seil el-Kabir, came in from the right. Continuing in the same direction we soon reached the confluence of three big wadis, namely the Haiadha, which we had been following, the Birri coming in from103 — ^ and tb . e Shamiya. a mighty wadi from the north-east so called because down it comes the great inland pilgrim route from Fatima ^Afrh' ‘’“'“f ^ ‘ S ^ l 116 U PP er section of the Wadi j ad “ a ' „ At f ‘i 18 . P 011 ' 6 , we w r ere abou t thirty-three miles nearly due, north o£ Tait and henceforward our course lay west-south west with occasional variations down the Wadi Fatima (known in ^ wionssectiomas Wadi Sha,niya, Wadiel-Laimun, Wadi Zubam, Hai i el-Mun and hnally Wadi Fatima m that order downwards) ' tT® ‘“‘''ed north-west into the Jiddah hills at Bijadiya. llie Wadi phamiya varies in breath from 100 to 300 yards and is lined on both sides by continuous ridges of hills of varying; height, through which at intervals tributary ravines come down into the wadi from either side. The storm channel varies in breadth from about 50 to 100 yards, its course zigzagging from side to side of the wadi, in which at intervals earth terraces, sometimes twenty to thirty feet m height, are built up for cultivation purposes these being entirely dependent on torrent irrigation and fed by channels into which the flood waters are forced bv orushwork obstructions in the storm channel itself The culti- vators of these terraces are generally the wild mountaineers of the Hud hail tribe who come down from their hills after heavy tails of ram, but so far as I could gather such cultivation is extremely precarious and unreliable. Three miles down the wadi we arrived at a large stretch of these terraces by the side of which stood a few solitary huts known as Umm el-Khair. Opposite this place stands a higdi precipitous hill called Haliana, at the top of which on the other side is reputed to be a village with palm groves, which, it is said, can be reached by camel—not by ordinary camels, it is true, but by those of the small and hardy Hejazi breed trained for moun- tam work. Here or hereabouts the tributary Wadis Kharan, Namra, and Umm I akhr discharge into the Shamiya, the first named from the lelt and the other two from the right. From Umm el-Khair we marched eleven miles through the same unvarying scenery of wide wadi bed lined with bare high crags, through which descended Wadis Glmlwa and Izhal from the left, Wadi Sammu from the right, on the upper reaches of which, high-perched on a hill but invisable to us, stands the village and palms of Sufaiya, and Wadis Qirdha and Qutba from the left in that order as we descended the wadi. At this point the Wadi Shamiya comes abruptly to an end, giving place to the Wadi el-Uaimnn through a narrow gap formed by the protrusion of a cross ridge from the rocks on Hie left:. At the head of this gap stood the first palm grove of the village of Madhiq, and beyond it for about three miles we passed through the most lovely scenery of palm groves and orange and banana plantations, lucerne fields and vegetable gardens, occupying the broad gap between the rough crags on either side, to the main group of buildings of the village itself situated on a spur of the hills on the right.— 104 — We were now forty-seven miles from Tnif at an elevation of only 1,300 feet above sea-level in the midst of scenery which though tropical in character far surpasses in beauty that of laif, though the climate was a little oppressive in comparison with that of the latter place and the high desert behind it. Two miles march on the following morning brought us to the sprint* of Ain Jadida situated at the head of a wide bulge in the wadi.° Here as at Madhiq there is a large area of cultivation dependent on perennial irrigation from a newly discovered spring, while to the left we could see about a mile distant the pidm ui-oves of Saul a in the Wadi Yamaniya just above the point where it descends towards Mecca through a gap between the Mudarraj and Haradh ridges. Southwards _ over Saida, we obtained a magnificent view of the high mountains of the Hejaz range rising tier upon tier into the far distance. &amp; The Wadi el-Laimun here turned west-north-west for two miles where it gave way to the A adi Zubara down which we marched due west for two miles, then north-west for three miles to the pyramidical hill of Abu Khasaf, from the summit of which, it was said, Mecca is visible. 1 he Wadi Zahra here came in trom the left and we continued north-north-west for two-miles to the confluence of the broad Wadi Dharaa with the Wadi Zubara. Hence looking east we saw the high range of Suda, whose primitive tribesmen eke out their existence by the sale of the best honey of the Hejaz. Turning west we marched for five miles to a spring called Ain Mubarak, round whicli stand scattered habitations and a considerable area of cultivation. At this point the Wadi Zubara turns north-west, but w r e continued our march south-west for five miles and north-west for six miles th rough the scattered hills and valleys of the Shautan tract to WYziriya, where we re-entered the Wadi Zubara, here a valley of considerable breadth closed in on the north by a long flat ridge and open on the south side from which we approached it. Here again is a perennial spring around which there is a considerable amount of cultivation and here w T e camped for the night only eighty feet above sea-level and seventy-one miles distant from Taif. To the south and south-east of WTtziriya could be seen the high ranges of the Hejaz hills while to the south-west lay the high ridges of Sadar and Mukassar and Dhaf, the easterly extremities of the coast range. IS'ext morning our course lay south-west as far as Bahra w T hence a north-westerly run of some twenty miles brought us to Jiddah. At a distance of four miles from Waziriya w r e crossed the coast road from Medina to Mecca running from north-west to south-east, and a mile further on the Wadi Zubara gave way to the Wadi el-Murr, a valley about tw o miles broad bordered on the left by the low hills between us and Mecca and on the right by the high hills of Sadar and Mukassar along whose foot lay a number of populous and prosperous villages each surrounded by tm I — 105 — • a considerable area of palm groves. The first of these was Jmnum at the foot of Sadar to our right beyond which lay Abu Arwa and Humaima in the gap between iSadar and Mukassar. Six miles dowm the wadi w T e entered the Wadi Fatima properly so called at the village of Murshidiya which consists of a number of large villas and little hamlets scattered over the broad bed of the wadi. To our right under the lee of Mukassar lay the village of Muqawwa (apparently the Medua of our maps) and from the left came in a broad wadi on the western edge of which stood the considerable village of Shumaisi nestling in the folds of the Shumaisi hills on the Mecca—Jiddah road. Resting for a while at Sherif Muhsin’s country villa in Mur shidiya for breakfast we resumed our course down the wadi, now about two miles broad between the hills which lined its sides. Passing the village of Rikani in the folds of the hills on our right, we soon discerned the narrow opening in the Shumaisi hills to our left through which emerges the Mecca—Jiddah road and telegraph line, and two miles further on we found ourselves on the road itself. In five minutes we reached the village of Hadda, consist ing of a few dingy houses and a large masonry mosque standing in a considerable area, of palms. From Hadda we rode at a rapid pace south-westward down the wadi, following the sandy track of the Mecca—Jiddah road past the solitary well of Umm el-Qurun (two miles from Hadda) to the fort of Bahra, a large square building built on a little eminence and still showing signs of the bombardment to which it was subjected by the Sherif’s forces during their advance on Mecca. This was two and a half miles from Hadda, and half a mile further on we passed through the large village of Bahra itself. The village consists mainly' of straw-built huts, but the* Snq, along both sides of which stand a large number of booths of similar construction, seemed to be doing good business as we passed through. From Bahra we slanted across the wadi towards the hills on the right, and passing the post of Sudaiyan, situated in the wadi itself on the edge of the road, we Reached the fringe of the hills close to the fort and tiny village of Bijadiya, the fort being placed on an eminence which effectually commands the road in all directions. This was about three miles from Bahra fort. Here we left the Wadi Fatima behind us to pursue its south westerly course towards the sea between its borders of hills ever diminishing in height, and ourselves struck north-west through the coast range of hills of low elevation. The road through the hills is broad and level for the most part, a track well scored by the passage of countless caravans and guarded at intervals by watch towers held by small garrisons. The first of these was the conspicuous white circular tower of Nuqtat el-Baidha, one and a half miles from Bijadiya ; a mile further on stood the post of Kathana, perched on a hill at whose base along the road stood a few booths for the sale of light refreshments to passing pilgrims.106 From Kathnna the road descended fairly steejdy to the cave of Ghar el-Sauliya in the Wadi Sauliya whicly flows south ward ^ to join the Wadi Fatima. This spot once enjoyed the reputation of being the home of brigands, but the apparent security in which solitary travellers and even women pass along the road at the present time without escort suggests that the times have changed. We now ascended the Wadi Sauliya to a pass called hi el-Ahmar, on one side of which stood a watch tower and a few booths, and three miles further on we passed the ruins of what was once the post of Mizal. The hills were now rapidly thinning out, and at a distance of half a mile from Mizal we topped a low ridge to look upon the sea. The thin blue speck widened as we moved on, and in a few minutes a broad blue band stretched across our front from right to left. A few yards on we reached the post of Raghama, perched on the last ridge of the coast range, and before us The land sloped down to the water’s edge on which stood out the bold outline of the towers of Jiddah silhouetted against the blue. Gladdened by the sight we urged our jaded beasts to a final effort to the tune of Bedouin songs ; in due course (he six miles, which, still separated us from our goal, were covered, and at 3.45 p.m. on the last day of the year the vanguard of our party, leaving our stragglers to follow in our wake, streamed into the town of Jiddah through the Mecca gate. Thus ended my journey across Arabia from sea to sea, a distance of some 820 miles accomplished in thirty-four days of actual travel. As I have already noted, my hopes of returning whence 1 came by way of the W adi Dawasir were to my great disappointment frustrated by • circumstances beyond my control, • but as I write I am on my way back to re-enter Arabia from a more hospitable shore and to rejoin, I hope, the merry band of whom I took leave with the liveliest regret when Fate decreed the parting of our ways. H. St. J. B. Philby.107 — i2&gt;f PALESTINE LETTER. 29th March, 1918. 1. h'nemij Territory. The economic situation in enemy territory appears to be growing worse. Large quantities of grain have been requisitioned, especially in the A jlun area, and the extensive purchases of wheat by'Germans, which are reported from Aleppo, Damascus, Rayak and Tul Keram, have sent up prices. The Germans are reported to be buying for gold without questioning the price and sending much of’ the wheat so obtained to Germany. Distress has consequently been caused in many areas. On the other hand crop prospects appear to be generally good in the Hauran and Moab (Kerak-Madeba area) for, though the area sown is decidedly less than last year, the weather has been particularly favourable to the crops. The present very high price of grain indicates that reserve stocks are very small. The good harvest of 11)16 was so heavily requisitioned by the Government (18|^ was taken over and above the vshur) that the peasants of the Nukra plain have been living from hand to mouth ever since. The increasing unpopularity of the Germans, both among Turks and Arabs, appears to be a direct result of the economic stress. Agents report several fracas, and one states that an attempt by Falkenhayn to obtain control of civil as well as military stores and consequent friction with the Valis of Beirut, Aleppo and Damascus was the cause (more probably one of the causes) of the German Marshal’s recall. In this connection a remark ascribed, by an unusually well-informed agent, to a German officer at Beirut may be quoted : — “ We have not come here to free the Turks from the English or to defend their country, but to take them by the scruff of the neck should they attempt to surrender or make a separate peace.” Typhus is rife in the camps in Lebanon and the Bukaa. At the end of February there were forty-seven cases including nine officers, at Rayak alone. 2. Occupied Tnemy Territory. The slow improvement in the economic situation continues » to be maintained, both in the plain and in the Judaean hill country. As in previous reports the Intelligence Officer at Bethlehem emphasises the appreciation of our military adminis tration manifested by the inhabitants. A similar report comes from Mejdel where even handed justice and incorruptibility of judges are evidently novelties. A Municipal Council, composed of five Moslems, ^ two Christians and two Jews, lias been convoked by the Military Governor of Jaffa and has held its first meeting.On March 22, the Franciscan Cnstode— i.e. the head of the Administration of the Franciscan Mission at Jerusalem—received orders from the Vatican to recognise the French religious protec torate over the (Catholic) Holy Places, which he had previously declined to do. On March 23, the Solemn Entry into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was attended by M. Picot and the French Mission, to whom the full customary honours were paid. 2?id April, 1918. Agricultural conditions continue to be very favourable on the lower ground, the crops in the Mejdel district being judged the most promising seen for seven years. Four thousand kilos, of potato-seed have been served out. As the rainy period draws to an end, the irrigation of the Jaffa fruit groves b'gins to give concern. This is done from wells, mostly fitted with pumps, worked by oil fuel. On the application of the growers, a con siderable supply of oil is being procured from Egypt and will be distributed by the O.E.T. Administration, according to acreage and engine power : but, of course, against payment. Enquiry is .now being made into the needs of the several plantations. Collection of taxes on crops has begun, wholesale adjustment having to be made in many cases where the estimated area under cultivation, as returned by a village at sowing time, proves to be greatly below the truth. The mere fact of taxation being enforced at all is undoubtedly a disappointment to the ignorant peasants who had heard that nothing of the kind would be exacted for five years. This feeling will not be lessened by the decision to collect also dues allocated to the Ottoman Debt. Some tax-collectors, it is reported, have already been attempting to make the illicit gains associated with publicans from time immemorial in the east. The method adopted is to exchange the Egyptian money received into metalliks, purchased at a heavy discount, and pay the latter into the banks at par. Measures are being taken to stop this ingenious traffic. Another little game of exchange has been detected at Bethlehem, Hebron and Gaza. Arabs from Akaba have been purchasing Turkish Lira notes against British gold at a rate of eight or nine to the pound sterling : these are re-sold at Akaba (by, it is said, the Reis el- Beladiyah) to a Jeddah dealer at a small profit; and thence, no doubt, they are to find their way, at a further profit, to some point where they are still current. The distribution of food by the Religious Communities at Jerusalem is reported to be working better, and improving steadily. There have been no fresh cases of tyhpus. The recent occupation and subsequent evacuation of Salt has thrown on our hands some 1,500 Armenian refugees, part of the 7,000 reported to survive in the southern trans-Jordan lands from those driven down in 1915. Armenians are proving rather- 109 ?• a difficulty to our administration, in both Jaffa and Jerusalem. At the latter the community is reported to be divided into two factions, between whom disturbance is anticipated, and will have to be dealt with in much the same way as the Turks used to deal with it. Educational demands are beginning to be pressed every where. In Jerusalem the budget for the current year has been approved, and in consequence, the necessary teachers have been appointed to two preparatory boys’ schools, a teachers’ school, a kindergarten and three Moslem Kuttabs. It has not yet been found possible, however, to re-staff the German establishments, such as Schneller’s Institute, and Tabitha Cumi at Jerusalem, and accordingly these have not been taken over. The German orphanage is said to be out of funds. Ten French Sisters of various orders have been allowed to come up to Jerusalem for educational and Red Cross work. The ceremonies of the Latin Easter passed off at Jerusalem without a hitch, the traditional compliments being accorded by the Franciscans and others to M. Picot, as representative of France—though without marked enthusiasm. A curious side light on the sort of ecclesiastical atmosphere which envelops Holy Places is offered by a recent row between Latins and Greeks at Bethlehem, because the latter swept the forecourt of the Church of the Nativity. The sacred privilege, to avoid further dissension, has now been assumed by the Municipality. With the arrival of the Zionist Commission, of which an advance party is already in Palestine, it is to be expected that Arab apprehension will become acute : and it is hoped that no time will be lost in making known as widely as possible the real policy of the Commission, which is understood to be opposed both to expropriation or exploitation of existing land owners, and also to any Jewish political control of Palestine. For the very moderate number of Jews, expected to desire to settle there, it is considered that the almost derelict crown lands, and unappropriated marshy and sandy areas will provide ample scope. To inspect the possibilities of such lands, to look into the economic condition of the existing colonies, to resolve difficulties which have arisen about Jewish Relief funds, and to give practical expression to the idea of a Jewish University at Jerusalem—these are the main objects of Dr. Weizmann’s Commission.no ARABIA. North-West. Inteliujeiice. Operations. At the end of March British troops advanced through Salt and scientifically destroyed over ten miles of railway south of Amman as well as a bridge to the north, afterwards returning to the Jordan valley. They captured 700 prisoners, fonr guns and many machine guns. The threat of this advance caused the Turks to evacuate Tafila, Kerak and Madeba, and to concentrate on the railway. In the southern area some of Sherif Abdullah’s Arabs made an attack on outposts at Abu Naam, which was held by two companies of Mule Mounted Infantry and one company of Camel Corps. Fifteen Turks were killed and three captured. Ferhan el-Aida is reported to have attacked Medain Saleh. Ibn Rashid’s men counter-attacked but were fired on by both sides and lost men and camels. Two Turkish patrols, from Jedahah and Wagir, were ambushed at the point where they met,'losing ten killed and five prisoners. Present Situation at Wejh. Bimbashi Bright writes from Wejh under date March 21 :— “Sherif Sharaf arrived here from Jeyadah on February 21. Unfortunately he had delayed his return to Wejh for a fortnight more than was anticipated, but as soon as he was settled in Wejh the necessity for action was impressed on him. Since the beginning of the month there has been considerable activity in the Suk here, and large numbers of Bedouins, especially Billi, have been in to pay their respects to Sherif Sharaf and to receive pay and supplies. Sherif Sharaf has been constantly occupied in the Meglis with them, and from all accounts lias treated them with a firm hand. Each sheikh has had to say how many Haggeens he can provide, and Sherif Sharaf has told off a Mamour to each section ; and unless the promised number of camels and men are forthcoming the monthly pay of that section will not be paid. At one time there was a certain amount of bad feeling between Hammad Mongara (Sheikh of Billi) and Sherif Sharaf over supplies, but this seems to have now been settled. Most of the important Billi sheikhs have been in, but as every one is very reticent it has not been possible to find out precisely which, nor the numbers of Bedouins promised. Hamid ibn Rifada and Ibrahim (now paramount Sheikh of the Bilh) aie still here and intend proceeding to Mecca to interview the King on the arrival of the “ Borulos.” I have met Ibrahim in company with Sharaf; his attitude seems quite friendly and everything points to all the Billi having now come over to the side of the King. With Hamid ibn Rifada there is— Ill also a certain Sheikh Eid ibn Kahad, who is said to be Suleiman Pasha’s cousin and was on the train with Suleiman Pasha when the latter was killed. He afterwards deserted from the Turks and is now going to Mecca with Hamid and Ibrahim. (See 1917 Bulletins, p. 513. Apparently the Eid there mentioned was not Suleiman’s son and was not killed.) At present the only indication of the numbers of Billi who have now come over is the fact that Sherif Sharaf has asked to be supplied with Turkish ammunition for about 1,200 rifles belonging to Bedouins who have left the Turks for the King. Sharaf’s intention is to attack the railway in two places-^- south of el-Ula with one party and north of Medain Salah with the other. Sherifs Hassan and Mohammed and Aziz Effendi left for deyadah on March 9 with 900 complete charges in all. They are to lead the southern party. Sherif Sultan left for Jeyadah on March 14 to lead the northern attack ; the base from which this attack will be carried out will be a place called Thurba. He took with him two electric exploders completely fitted, one for his own party and one for Aziz.” Note. —The Billi have been of little use since the beginning of the revolt and too much should not be expected from this new concentration. General. A brakesman on the Hejaz railway, who deserted from el-Ula in February, states that twelve engines were then running between Maan and Medina. They ran over the following sectors, returning after handing over their freight: Maan to Mudawara, thence to Tebuk, thence to Medain Salah, thence to Hediyah, thence to Medina. Each sector took one day to pass, and engines often had to stop to get up steam, the wood fuel being very poor. Before the war, the journey from Maan to Medina was accomplished in eleven hours. Another reliable deserter reports that five or six train-loads of supplies have reached Medina from Maan during the last few weeks and agun,amachinegunand 700 rifles from Meshed. Itisnow believed that Fakhreddin has no intention of evacuating Medina. It is reported from Yambo that, as a result of Sherif Feisal s demolitions of the railway, all spare rails south of Maan have been used up except 1,000 at Medina, which will be kept there for repairs in that area. A large quantity of spare rails had been previously brought from the Haifa—Afule radway. Dhahri ibn Rashid, a cousin of the Emir of Hail, is now with Sherif Abdullah. He is a pleasant, intelligent man of about thirty-five years of age, and reputed to be a good judge of a horse. He quarrelled with the Emir some years ago, and has since been with Ibn Sand as one of his Emirs and more recently with King Husein at M ecca. ft is reported that most of the Harb have left Shenf Ah owing to non-payment of their subsidy. Only the Beni-112 Mohammed are still with him, the Turks beino’ in possession oi their property, which is round Medina. I he enemy is believed to have offered some of the tribes larger subsidies than those given by the Sherifs, and certain of them are suspected of taking money from both sides. Many of the civilians who were driven out of Medina were given the option of going to Syria or working as woodcutters along the line. One of those who chose the latter alternative recently deserted to the Arabs and was interrogated at Wejh. He states that he worked at Bediya (Bedai), el-Ula, and between Zumurrud and Bir Jedid. These sources of supply seem to have been exhausted some months ago, but a more recent one was between Meshed and Sell Matara, six kilometres west of the railway. The branch line which ran to this woodcutting area is now being taken up. At el-Ula there are at present rather over a thousand civilians, who are living principally on dates. [ Late News .—Kerak has been occupied by a detachment of Sherif Feisal’s army under Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza. The weather in the Maan area was still intensly cold during March, and made successful operations against the railway impossible. A raid which was attempted from Abu Lesal resulted in the death from exposure of eight men and all the transport camels. A heavy fall of snow took place towards the end of the month.] NOTES. Jebel I marie. Mr. Philby writes : — “ On page 105 of the Arab Bureau edition of Guarmani’s ‘Northern iNiejd’ it is stated with reference to Guarmani’s mention of the ‘Jebel Imarie : that ‘we have no proof of the existence of any such land feature as shown on the maps of 1850 and thereabouts.’ I notice however that the 1917 edition of Hunter’s map (48 miles-1 inch) published by the Survey of India retains a tentative ‘Jebel Amariyah or Aridh ’ in the region of longitude 44°-45 0 and latitude 23°, running presumably W.S.W. by E.N.E. I certainly heard Amariyah frequently used as an alternative name for the Ardh range or at any rate for the ridge of el-Jidd which constitutes its backbone and through which the 11 ajj route passes close under the hill of Amar, so called from the fact that a well of that name is situated in a Shaib running down its113 western flank into the Sardah valley. Doubtless this well gave rise, in the loose geographical diction of Central Arabia, where wells are such important features, to the general appellation of Amariyah for the whole ridge, and Guarmani was certainly correctly informed when he noted the range as being the (eastern) boundary of the Ateibah range as it still is. Where el-Meskeb is I do not know. The early maps misplaced ^ Jebel Imarie ’ as running east and west along the direct Hajj route from Aneizah, presumably on the authority of some native of Aneizah, who was assumed to have travelled direct, whereas it would seem that he must have travelled south to join the Nejd-Mecca track, probably at Dhruma. Quaiiyya, Haiiban and Ruwaidha are similarly mis placed very considerably to the north of their correct positions. ihe Ardh range including the el-Jidd or Amariyah ridge appeared to me to run practically due north and south and should be placed roughly along longitude 45° to 45J°, the Hajj route traversing it via Quaiiyya, Mizal, Ibn Saadan and Quai villages roughly along the line of latitude 24°. The western boundary of the Ateibah in this tract is the Wadi Naim which separates the quadruple mountain range of Nejd proper from the great Shifa plain. If a straight line be drawn north and south along the Wadi Naim to the village of Sija and an east to west line be drawn from the latter place to Marran and thence a line be drawn south down the eastern edge of the Rakba plain to the latitude of Taif, the area enclosed by these lines comprises the range of the Subai and Buqum (only between Khnrma and the Hadhu range) ; outside this area, westward to the Taif hills, eastward to the eastern fringe of the Ardh range, and northwards roughly from the borders of the Qasim to some point south of Medina, lies the sphere of the Ateibah.” Ajlun Arabs. Two Arabs who claim to have been sent by the Ajlun sheikhs have arrived in our lines in Palestine. They state that towards the end of January the Mutessarif of Deraa and the Mali of Damascus summoned the Ajlun sheikhs to Dema, informed them that Nuri Shaalan, who had made a compact with the British and the Sherif, was in the Syrian desert near Azrak, and requested them to attack him. Some old rifles were issuod to the sheikhs on their expressing their willingness to operate against Nuri, and 400 “ volunteers were assembled, but soon deserted, after which an order was issued exempting them from military service. Conscription had not been enforced upon the Hauran and Ajlun people owing to their habit of desertion. They were, how - ever, compelled to supply an unpaid corps of woodcutters. The general feeling in Ajlun is favourable to the British and the Sherif.114 A&lt;len. Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, recently paid a visit to His Excellency the High Commissioner to discuss the situation in south-western Arabia. He was accompanied by the Sultan of Lahej, Sir Abdul Kerim ibn Fadl ibn Ali, and his suite. The Sultan received the insignia of a K.C.I.E. at the hands of H.R.H. Field-Marshal the Duke of Connaught. His suite consisted of Sultan Muhsin Fadl, Sultan Ahmed Munasser, Emir Salah Saad and Sheikh Mohammed Fadl. Idrisi’s Campaign. The investment of the Turks on Jebel Kudmieh was continued during the early part of last month. Communications were cut between the Jebel and Zahirab, and the enemy, according to Seyyid Yahya, Mustafa’s agent, have been for some weeks completely surrounded. On March 8 they were said to have provisions and water for one month. Two thousand of the Waazat are reported to have sur rendered to Idrisi, leaving their children as hostages. Abyssinia. From Adis Abeba comes the satisfactory news that, on the demand of the army, the Council of Ministers has been dismissed (see p. 83). The military leaders insist that the Empress and the Regent shall in future exercise autocratic power with the advice of Hapta Giorgis, the Minister for War (p. 84).SECRET.

Affairs in Nejef, . population ol Nejef, apart from the Ulema and their train of students and dependents, is divided into two tribal factions, the Zuqurt and the Shumurt, the leaders of which played an important part in the ejection of the ’Ottoman Government during the first year of the war. The tribal sheikhs, Seyyid Mahdi ibn Seyyid Salman, Haji Atiyah, Abu Qulal and Kadhim Subbi of the Zuqurt, together with Haji Saad ibn Haji Radhi, of the Shumurt, took over the administration of the town after the troubles with the Turks in May 1915, and a few months later entered into correspondence with us. Of these four men, Seyyid Mahdi alone can be described as coming of a respectable stock ; his father before him was a recognised leader of the Zuqurt. Haji Atiyah had pursued, before the war, with varying success, the career of smuggler and highwayman ; Kadhim Subbi had risen to his present position from that of coffee maker in Atiyah’s house, and Haji Saad had begun life as a butcher. Incessant friction has always marked the relations of the factions of the four sheikhs and of the quarters of the town controlled by them. As figure-heads of the town in its resistance to the Turks, the sheikhs acquired, as at Kerbela, an importance which they had not previously enjoyed, but their sudden rise to power was not a subject for unmitigated satisfaction to other elements. The sheikhs carried out their task with more profit to themselves than benefit to Nejef, except in so far as they prevented any effective re-establishment of Turkish authority. The Mujtahids, first among whom is Seyyid Mohammed Kadhim Yazdi, probably the most influential Shiah Divine now living, and such families as that of the Kiliddar, men of wealth and education, accepted the domination of the tribal sheikhs only because the alternative was the still more distasteful domination of the Turks ; the merchant class suffered from their exactions and from the unchecked lawlessness of their followers. Their rapacity may be guaged from the fact that Haji Atiyah, who immediately before the war was a man of no means, had, by the spring of 1917, amassed very considerable wealth from municipal exactions, assisted no doubt, latterly, by judicious trading with the sums which from time to time he, in common with other leading sheikhs, were receiving from us for the main tenance of the resistance of Nejef to the control of the Turks. Immediately after the conquest of Baghdad, the town sheikhs came in to see Sir Percy Cox, but we were not then in A position to substitute any other authority for that which they exercised. In August 1917, a Government Agent was sent to Kejef in the person of Hamid Khan, a relative of the Agha Khan, but he was unable to do more than hold a watching brief. His chief— 116 difficulty was that the police were selected by the sheikhs from their own following ; the execution of Hamid Khan’s orders depended on their endorsement by the sheikhs, and the police were ever ready to take active part in the quarrels of faction and quarter. In the autumn, shortage of supplies made the situation still more difficult, and led to the first open breach of the peace. On October 29, Fahad ibn Dugheim, a sheikh of the friendly Amarat tribe, came to Nejef with a letter from Colonel Leachman, P.O. Desert, asking that he might be furnished with a considerable quantity of grain. The stock of &lt;&gt;Tain was already dangerously low and when it was known in the bazaar that Fahad ibn Dugheim had been supplied with ten tons of wheat, the price of wheat, barley and rice underwent a sudden increase. On the following day, Fahad ibn Hadhdhal, paramount chief of the Amarat, sent in a caravan of a hundred camels for grain, on passes signed by himself. This was probably in excess of what the town could spare, and the inhabitants rose in immediate protest. Such of the Bedouin as had entered the town were hunted out, and on November 1-2 a demonstration by the townsfolk was made round the Anazeh camp outside the walls. Shots were fired, a camel was killed, three rifles were stolen but were subsequently returned, the camp was looted, and during the process the Anazeh claimed that some of their camels disappeared. Hamid Khan, unable to grapple with the situation which had arisen, begged the Chief Commissioner to relieve him. In view of the great importance of developing the food supplies of the Euphrates and of checking Turkish propaganda, it had been decided to send an agent to Samawah, and a Political Officer to the Shamiyah district. The P.O. Hillah went on a visit of inspection to Samawah, where he ultimately remained as Political Officer, and the newly appointed P.O. Shamiyah made at the same time a preliminary tour of his district. Hearing of the trouble between the people of Nejef and the Anazeh, he visited the town on November 4, and arranged a settlement on the basis of compensation to the Bedouin for the losses they had incurred, to be paid in by the four tribal sheikhs within a period of ten days; but on his return from Samawah, whither he had gone to meet the P.O. Hillah, he found that, although the appointed day was past, the full amount of the compensation agreed upon had not been paid. Seyyid Mahdi was ill and confined to his bed ; Haji Saad was away at his country establishment; neither of these two worthies, it may be noted, had produced his share of the stipulated sum. An attempt to put pressure on Haji Atiyah and Kadhim Subbi, the only sheikhs present, led to a sudden disturbance instigated by Atiyah, during which the sarai was repeatedly attacked and its windows and furniture broken up. Wmd was sent by the ringleaders to Kufah and Abu bukhair, the latter being the official headquarters of theShamiyah district, and riots, similar to those in Nejef, occurred during the afternoon, led in both places by the police, who were iSFejef men. The sheikhs of the Beni Hasan and its constituents, who are the most influential tribesmen round Kufah, behaved on the whole well, and helped to quell the disorders. ^ Neither here nor among the Fatlah, lower down the Euphrates, was there any evidence of a desire on the part of the tribal chiefs to take part against us, though Ajeimi had un doubtedly been doing his best to foster unrest. Agricultural operations occupied the attention of the sheikhs. They were busy with the sowing of seed, received as an advance from the Government, as well as with the clearing of canals and the construction of dams under the supervision of an Irrigation engineer. The preservation of order was essential to them in order to complete this work, and to assure the gathering in of their harvest, and these considerations weighed heavier in the scale than the incitements of Atiyah or the windy promises of Ajeimi. Equally gratifying was the attitude adopted by the men of religion. The Kiliddar gave material assistance to the P.0, during the riot, and have since been uniformly helpful, while Mohammed Kadhim Yazdi complied at once with the request of the P.0, that he should act as mediator. On his advice Haji Atiyah and Kadhim Subbi asked and obtained pardon. The advisability of strengthening our hold over the fertile Euphrates area had already been agreed upon in principle, and in the first week of December, the C.-in-C, visited the Euphrates valley. He summoned the town sheikhs of Nejef to interview him at Kufah, but Atiyah did not comply, and asked to be granted an interview at Nejef. This was refused. He was told to come to Baghdad to see the C.-in-C. under assurances of complete immunity. Troops were sent down the Euphrates in the course of the month and posted in small numbers at Hillah, Kill, Kufah and Abu Sukhair. At the same time posts were established from Nasiriyah at Samawah and Shinafiyah. It was considered inadvisable to place a garrison in Nejef, which is a town of over 40,000 inhabitants, and would require a garrison of considerable strength. The location of a mixed detachment at Kufah would, it was anticipated, have the desired indirect effect on the tranquility of Nejef. In spite of these measures, the state of affairs in the town showed no improvement. Haji Atiyah refused to visit the C.-in-C. at Baghdad, and both he and Kadhim Subbi maintained a truculent attitude towards the P.O. The Government agent was as powerless as before, and the religious and commerical communities suffered from a lack of security which was inevitable as long as Nejef lay at the mercy of the town sheikhs. It is certain that Ajeimi was active in hostile propaganda.Seyyid Hadi el-Zuwaini, the leading man of Jaarah, who had shown himself consistently pro-British, was the recipient o a letter from Ajeimi, which he forwarded to the (y-ni-O. In tins document he was urged to roll up his sleeves and join his brothers in Nejef in defence of the Faith and of the Ottoman Government. Similar letters must have reached other notables of the Shaimya i province, but they fell, as before, on unfruitful ground. Seyyid Hadi is one of the landowning seyyids who aie ^ feature of the Euphrates valley, where their estates are found scattered from Musaiyib to Samawah. As a class they are almost invariably anti-Turkish ; in their double character of landlord and holy man, they have great influence among the tribes, and theii moral support is of no little value to us. The alienation of the leaders of the Shiah community by the Turks has been of the first importance in our dealings with Kerbela and Nejef. In both towns we have been confronted with the private ambitions of the sheikhs who, for their own ends, were anxious to preserve the authority they had gained during the anarchy of war, but we have met with no hostility from the religious element which, if it had been in opposition to us, would have proved a formidable adversary. Seyyid and Mujtahid have viewed with a favouring eye the steps we have taken to bring about orderly government. On January 12, 1918, Haji Atiyah passed from covert to open rebellion. In the morning of that day, the Indian cavalry stationed {it Kufah were out training, and passed under the walls of Nejef. Haji Atiyah gathered his followers together under the pretext that an attack on himself was contemplated. They fired on the cavalry from a wall near his house, and a trooper was killed. The cavalry rode on without firing on the town, and the dead man was brought in and buried by order of Hamid Khan in the afternoon. Some British officers were in the bazaar when the outrage took place, but suffered no inconvenience. Haji Saad summoned his men to form a guard over them, and himself accompanied them out of the town. On the following day a British aeroplane flying over Nejef was fired upon, but the attackers were dispersed by some of the sheikhs. These events cleared the air. Haji Saad, Seyyid Mahdi, and a number of minor sheikhs, alarmed at matters having gone so far, came into Kufah on January 14 to see the P.O., and returned on the following day, at his request, bringing with them Kadhim Subbi. Haji Atiyah, seeing himself isolated, fled into the desert with a very small following ; he had for some time past been making preparations for a hasty departure should it become necessary. He is said to have plenty of money with him. So far as is known, he has not up to the present joined Ajeimi, and, judging from a letter written after his departure to the O.-in-C., he did not at first abandon hope of a free pardon. He has, however, been outlawed. A fine of 500 rifles, or their equivalent in cash, was imposed on the town of Nejef, together with theunconditional surrender of the eldest son of Haji Saad, a dangerous rogue named Karim. If these terms were refused, the town was to be blockaded and the water supply cut off after opportunity had been afforded to the well-disposed Ulema to withdraw to Kufah. The fine was paid on the appointed day, January 31, but Karim took to his heels and the sheikhs were excused from producing him after giving a signed assurance that he had left. He also has been outlawed. As soon as the incident was closed by the payment of the fine, a British A.P.O. took up his residence in Nejef. The allowance hitherto paid to the leading sheikhs will be discontinued, and a proposal for the organisation of an efficient police service is under consideration. The A.P.O. is at present lodging in a house within the town, the property of the Kiliddar, but, with a small personal guard, he will ultimately reside in a khan which stands a few hundred yards beyond the east gate of the city on the Kufah road. This 'khan was built by Haji Atiyah, mainly, it is said, out of the ill-gotten gains which he had accumulated after the abandonment of Nejef by the Turks, and was dedicated by him in an inscription composed in English, and surmounted by a representation of the Union Jack, to the victorious army of Great Britain. PALESTINE LETTER. Ajjril 10, 1918. News and rumours of the German offensive on the Western Front have had inevitably some effect on native feeling in Palestine, and cause credence to be given to those malcontent elements, which are in the habit of prophesying that our occupation is to be shortlived and of advising the continued concealment of arms. On the other hand the Turkish Minister at Berne, a little more than a month ago, was evidently of opinion that his country cannot hope to hold Palestine again on the old terms ; for, among other peace provisions adumbrated by him, appears Home-Rule for that region. An uneasy impression, created by the transitory nature of our recent operations east of the Jordan, has also to be reckoned with. Measures have been taken, however, to reassure the population on this latter head, by explaining the objective of those operations, and the Salt refugees in Jerusalem seem less affected by their exile than might have been expected. Besides the Armenian element among them, a considerable proportion is composed of families which were short of the means of sub sistence and anxious in any case to reach some place where food is more abundant. It is proposed to compensate all according to the measure of their ultimate losses when a definite settlement in regard to Salt has been arrived at. Meanwhile it is a120 — satisfactory sign of general feeling that no difficulty whatevei is being met with in raising a native police force. Applicants, able to offer substantial guarantees for good behaviour, are more numerous than required. . . The chief desire of the better class in South Palestine is to secure increased facilities for external trade, especially with Egypt. All sorts of contraband methods have been tried, but with little success, and till the pressure on transport is less, legitimate traffic can hardly be encouraged further. Internal trade is looking up, more and more shops being reported re-opened in the towns. Good results are being obtained by the Palestine Relief Fund, now amalgamated, more or less, with the American Red Cross. But in Jerusalem a severe strain will be put upon it by the influx from Salt. All accounts, received from agents in enemy territory, ■ indicate coming scarcity, even when the new harvest shall have been gathered. Not only will Syria be very short, but also North Mesopotamia, in both cases owing to lack of labour at the time of ploughing and seed. Large German purchases during the winter have aggravated the situation, and starvation, leading to rioting, is reported from cities of North and Mid-Syria. In Aleppo there are said to have been, during the winter, from forty to fifty deaths per day from shortage of food, while the mortality among all kinds of domestic animals has reached eighty per cent of the total livestock of the district. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. After the destruction of the railway south of Amman by British troops, the Arabs looted the station buildings at Khan Zebib, Jizeh and Leban, which the Turks had temporarily abandoned. More recently the Arabs have made several attacks on the railway north of Maan, but details have not yet been received. A construction train near Kissir station was attacked by the Royal Air Force, 800 lbs. of bombs being dropped, and many falling within effective range of the train. Amman station was bombed by eight machines on April 3 ; 1,200 lbs. of bombs were dropped on station buildings and rolling stock, and 2,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition were fired at a train near by. The British army in Palestine is now in touch by motor boat to Mezraa with Sherif Feisal’s troops at Kerak. The railway between Amman and Jizeh, which had been destioyed by British troops (see p. 110), is reported by our aeroplanes to have been repaired.\ 1 — 121 Southern Area. On the evening of March 29 an Arab demolition party under Aziz Effendi successfully raided the railway between Meshed and Sell Matara, destroying 450 rails, a bridge and a number of telegraph poles. The Moahib (see Bulletin 4o, p. 97) have attacked Ibn liashid at Medain Salah ; they killed four of his men and captured eighteen camels. Exceptionally heavy rains have again fallen, and are expected to cause serious damage to the line. The flooded area extends from Medina to Zumurrud, and Major Davenport himself was prevented from crossing the Wady Hamdh. The King is sending 300 trained infantry from Mecca under Yuzbashi Mahmud el-Kaisuni, acting Minister for War, to reinforce Sherif Ali. An improvement in the tribal situation is evident, and a large number of Arabs who were lately neutral or pro-Turk have arrived in Sherif Abdullah’s camp. Sheikhs Shehab and Sultan of the Fuqara, with 500 to 600 followers, and 3,000 Sherarat with 1,500 riding camels came in at the end of March. Their appearance made the local Juheinah realize that they were not indispensable, and incited them to fresh activity through fear of losing their subsidies. The attack on a Turkish post near Abu Naam, reported on page 110, was carried out by Emir Dhahri ibn liashid, and that on patrols between Jedahah and Wagir (p. 110) by Sherif Abdullah ibn Thawab. NOTES. Expedition to Goz Belair. The force which the King despatched southwards from Mecca (see p. 96) has been followed by another force of 350 Hudheil under their leading Sheikh, Ibrahim Pasha, with one old mountain gun and two machine guns. The destination of these troops is Goz Belair, a village about eighteen miles due east of Kunfudah, which is occupied by a Turkish detachment. King Husein has been reticent about the object of this expedition. It is too small to engage any of the more important Turkish posts in A sir, or to make its way south to districts where its presence would cause friction with Idrisi, and it is presumed that it is intended to reassert the King’s jurisdiction amongst the coastal tribes south of Lith and to attack the post at Goz belair it circumstances are favourable.Idris?s Campaign. The operations against Jebel Kudmieh continue to be assisted by British seaplanes, which cause intense delight to Idrisi. They are having a great moral effect and causing many of the Arab levies to desert the Turks. On March 22, the Idrisi Arabs attacked the Turkish post at Abu Karsh {see p. 95), killing eight Turks and losing two of their own men. Nasir Mabkhut was relieved of his command before the capture of Loheiyah, and is said to have left Midi with the Hashid and Bekil. Idrisi apparently considers these mercenaries unsatisfactory, and is now relying on Tehama tribesmen such as those of Abu Arish, the Masareha, the Beni Mar wan and sections of the Beni Abs, Beni Jama and Nashar. The inhabitants of Wadi Mur have definitely joined him, and the Boajia country, with the port of Khoba, is now under his influence. The Turks, meanwhile, are pushing up reinforcements from Hodeidah and have enlisted some of the Beni Suleil in the neighbourhood of Zeidiyah. Yemen. It is reported that letters from the African coast have recently reached Ali Said Pasha via Khoka. They were probably brought by Sheikh Isa, a Danakil chief. The Abu Has affair is again creating difficulties for the I urks. Hassan ibn Kasim Abu Has, chief akii of the Abu Harbah section of the Dim Mohammed, has arrived in southern Yemen from Barat at the head of 3,000 to 4,000 tribesmen. It appears that the Government endeavoured to conciliate the Dim Mohammed by appointing as Kaimakam of Ibb Haji Muhsin Abu Ras, a relative of the murdered Naqib Hassan. They have now dismissed Haji Muhsin, and Hassan ibn Kasim, his uncle, is accordingly preparing to raise a rebellion against the Government, and also to overthrow Sheikh Nasir Muqbil of Mawia. He is at present to the south of Ibb near Sayani, and has received promises of support from the sheikhs of the Dhi Sufal district (south-west of Ibb). I he Imam has delegated his representative at Nadhira (east of Ibb), Seyyid Yahya ibn Mohammed esh- Shahari, to find a peaceful solution, but the Zeidis have rejected the Seyyid’s intervention. Sherif Ahmed Muhsin of Behan has sent his brother, Sherif Aasir, to Aden. The latter stated that the Sheikh of the vhaulan et- lawal, who dwell south-east of Sanaa, and certain Hashid chiefs have signed an agreement to co-operate against the lurks. ° Abyssinia. In consequence o£ the death of Negus Waldi Giorgis, n poi ted on page 9-6, it was feared that his province of Begyemdir nng join 1 igre in revolt. It seemed likely, indeed, that a large part of Northern Abyssinia would declare its independence unless Ia powerful force was sent northwards by the Central Government. Orders were accordingly given for the army at Adis Abeba to start immediately, and for fifteen thousand troops to come up by train from Harrar, while Ras Taffari prepared to take command in person. The chiefs and soldiers, however, according to a letter from the capital dated March 16, openly refused to march, and the impotence of the Government had never been more clearly revealed. Whether its authority has since been strengthened by the dismissal of the Ministers, reported on page 114, we have not yet heard. For some time past the soldiers have been discontented, mainly owing to the greed of their chiefs, who keep for themselves the lands and money which the soldiers claim as their due. The Harrar troops, being better treated, are more disposed to obey orders. Dejazmach Baleha, one of the strongest men in Abyssinia, recently sent a letter to the Government asking to be relieved of his functions as Governor of Sidamo, and allowed to retire into private life, as he could no longer serve a Government he so utterly despised. Great commotion was caused in the Council of Ministers, but no action appears to have been taken. The Empress wishes the provinces of Waldi Giorgis to be given to her husband, Ras Guksa, and while some support her, others contend that they should be returned to their hereditary chiefs. Meanwhile it is probable that the widow of the Negus, an ambitious woman, is intriguing to keep them herself. In the town of Adis Abeba disorder is again rampant, and every night shots are fired and houses robbed. Ihe leading merchants are proposing to close their shops, and in the surround ing country caravans are pillaged and no satisfaction can oe obtained. Gold in Hejaz. The following note l^as been written by Dr. John Ball of the 'Egyptian Geological Department on one of the geological specimens collected by Mr. Philby during his recent journey. It was found in the Wadi Fatima between Umm el-Khair and Madhiq, Mr. Philby’s attention being arrested when examining the specimen by a yellow speck which suggested the presence of gold. , “ I think this is a highly crushed kornpls, perhaps an intensely altered clay rock. ‘The fibrous structure suggests that it is from a fault or other place of intense crushing. The rock contains here and there tiny yellow specks and flakes One of the yellow flakes tested in the Government laboratory by Mr. Pollard gave a reaction for gold and hence either was gold or contained gold. It would not be unusual to find specks of iron- pyrites in the hornfels and it may be that the specks are pyntes, containing a trace'of gold; on the other hand the specks are rather a darker yellow than pyrites ordinarily appears and it may be that they are pure gold. If there is a large quantity of the— 124 — rock, it would I think be worth while to collect more specimens, selecting those which show yellow metallic specks most abun dantly, and have them assayed for gold. If the rock is, as I fancy, from a fault zone it may easily have been impiegnated with gold from solutions circulating in the fault. Population of Baghdad. It has not yet been possible to take an exact census of the inhabitants of Baghdad but from the estimates made in connection with rationing the Civil population the figures appear to be approximately as follows :— 105,292 Rusafah (Left bank) ... 80,292 Karkh (Right bank) ... 25,000 ... 50,206 8,230 Composed of :— Chaldeans ... ... 4,817 163,728 Syrians _ ... 1,381 r— Gregorian Armenians ... 988 (of whom 341 are refugees). Armenian Catholics ... 353 Roman Catholics (Latin) 225 Protestants ... ... 156 Greek Catholics ... 130 Jacobites ... ... 580 The latest Turkish estimates available (see Bulletin 66) give a much higher figure which for purposes of comparison is given here :— Moslems ... ... ... 110,000 Composed of Arabs ... 101,200 Kurds ... 8,000 Persians ... 800 Jews ... ... ... 80,000 Christians 12,000 202,000 The discrepancy is no doubt due in part to the inaccuracy of Turkish figures, but chiefly to emigration and the wastage of war. For example, in the reduction by 30,000 of the Jewish population which, if the Turkish estimate was approximately correct, has to be explained, some 10,000 are known to have gone to Basrah since the conquest of Baghdad while a large number escaped from Baghdad while it was still in. Turkish hands. The pre-war population of Kadhimain and Adhamiyah was set at 25,000 for the former (Arabs 10,000, Persians 15,000), and 8,000 for the latter. The Kadhimain figure seems to be largely in excess of the present population which in December 1917 was reckoned for supply purposes at 13,500, plus babes in arms who were not included. This is a liberal estimate. The present population of Adhamiyah is probably not more than 5,000. The inhabitants of Kadhimain are all Shiah Mohammedans, those of Adhamiyah all Sunnis. Moslems ....

On Friday, the 29th, it was decided that m v 'T. of developments of the military situation elsewhere we must bring our occupation to an end before the enemy forces in the neighbourhood could be disposed of. On the following day the inhabitants were warned of our intention and invited to with draw westwards should they fear for their lives in the certain event of a I urkish reoccupation. The exodus began to a small extent the same night about 9 p.m., but not in great numbers till the evening of Easter Sunday, and it went on till late on the Monday, our troops evacuating at 7 p.m. that day. The refugee families mostly went down to the Jordan on foot, comparatively tew having any animals, and, so far as is known, they were not molested on the road. At the Ghoraniyah Bridge-head and Jericho they were almost all picked up by lorries and conveyed up the long ascent to Jerusalem. Before this exodus, Armenian refugees, to the number of just over 1,600 souls, found by our troops in Salt, had already made their way to Jerusalem, having, not unnaturally, taken earlier advantage of their freedom. They, therefore, should not be reckoned among those whose exile was occasioned by our withdrawal. The rest, the native inhabitants, who took refuge in Jerusalem, number over 4,000. In addition, some hundreds, mostly of the richer class, Avhich possessed animals, had made their own way to Bethlehem and Hebron. These are largely Moslem, and as they are fending for themselves, they are not included among the refugees for whom we shall provide. Of the latter, collected in Jerusalem, only 278 are Moslems, being, in the main, dependents or adherents of three chiefs who had taken an active part on our side during the occupation and felt themselves too seriously compromised to await the return of Turks, accompanied, in all probability, by some of their natural enemies, the Circassians of Ain Sir and Amman. The balance, amounting to 3,871, consists of Christians of .all denominations, including a few European Sisters of the Rosary and the like. Roughly speaking, they represent immediate district. The actual figures, supplied from Jerusalem, are: Men. Women. Children. Total. Greek Orthodox 332 548 1,076 1,956 Greek Catholic 83 92 286 461 Syrian Orthodox 38 96 83 217 Latin Catholic 156 258 506 920 Protestants 63 68 186 317 672 1,062 2,137 3,871 Christians and Moslems alike are a handsome folk of Arab physical type, and few present any appearance of having been— 126 — either downtrodden or underfed. But the great inajot ity belong to a very poor class, which possessed little more than do the rank and file o£ a Bedouin tribe. Of what they did possess, however, they have been able to bring away virtually nothing, their substance having consisted almost entirely in the house they lived in and the land they tilled ' Their lot is unfortunate ; but those, who have had to care for them thus far in Jerusalem, have been surprised by the small case they make of it. Obviously they do not see them- gpjygg quite as we see them. Apart from the fact, to which they bear witness, that they include a proportion of habitually indigent families which welcome, rather than otherwise, the chance of living on charity in a fatter land, and intended in any case to migrate into British Occupied Territory, the great majority belong to a population which has settled comparatively recently and still retains nomadic habits, such as tenting during the hot months. People accustomed to the annual ycnla migration (to use the Anatolian term) do not regard or feel detachment from their houses and lands nearly so acutely as a really fixed population does. Further, the Relieving Officers at Jerusalem and elsewhere were surprised equally by the gratitude shown for the very meagre and indifferent ration of barley-bread and grain (rice or millet), which was all they were at first in a position to distribute. This attitude of the refugees perhaps offers evidence, less of their simplicity or honourable character, than of the poverty in which the majority had been existing previously. If their domestic lot had been simply to get a day’s bread by a day’s toil, it is not so wonderful, that a day’s bread (even inferior) without toil should fill them with gratitude, not unmixed with astonishment. Be that as it may, it has been decided, with undoubted wisdom, to provide for them on a higher scale, while they are on our hands. The ration to be distributed will consist of bread, meat, onions, lentils or beans, rice, salt, cotton-seed oil, and wood. Bread, for example, will be lb. men, 1 lb. women, and | lb. children under ten years, other than those at the breast. Meat will be distributed three times a week at the rate of 4 oz. men, 3 oz. women and 2 oz. children. Condensed milk, 1 oz. daily, will be supplied for children under three years of age. For the constant supply and distribution of this ration, however, as well as to relieve Jerusalem of idling crowds and possibilities of disturbance of the peace, it is necessary to collect all, who are entirely dependent on us, into a camp to which transport is easy. A suitable site therefore has been chosen, and prepared about half a mile from Junction Station, to which the refugees and their subsequent supply can be trans ported by the railway. Other things being equal, a camp on the eastern edge of the Judaean plateau would have been preferred to one in the Shephelah. Salt is an upland town and its people- 127 — ( are not accustomed to the heat, which obtains on the Palestinian lowlands in the summer, now imminent. Moreover, the nearer the camp to the Trans-Jordan lands and the more visible the hills of Salt, the more likely that from time to time, families would creep back homewards of their own motion, automatically reducing our responsibility and our difficulties of supply. Wherever the camp is, it is not to be enclosed, and no impediment is to be offered to families or individuals taking themselves off, provided they understand that they fend thereafter for their own living, whether as harvesters for hire, or by self-repatriation. Even if Salt be thought too dangerous, the Madeba and Kerak districts will attract some who feel home-sick ; and there is little doubt that, should the present Turkish reoccupying force be withdrawn, for any reason, from Salt, many refugee families would chance trouble with Circassians and other Moslems who have remained at their home, and go back as their harvest season draws near. Unfortunately, however, the highland districts of Judaea under our effective control are ill-watered, where readily accessible to transport vehicles. The Bethlehem area, for example, which seems suitable on other grounds, has barely enough water for its existing inhabitants, its chief springs being used to supply the Jerusalem aqueduct, which would, of course, run great risk of both depletion and contamination were a camp of some 4,000 souls established near its head. The refugees to be concentrated at Junction do not include the Armenians. These it is proposed to accommodate with their fellows at Port Said, where the men—a very strong sturdy lot on the whole—will find inducements to join the Legion d’Orient in Cyprus. There will also be, doubtless, a small proportion, consisting of the well-to-do class, and mainly Moslems, who will elect to fend for themselves from the outset, living either on their own resources or on those of their friends or relatives in the Occupied Territory. To some of the leading chiefs and notables we have given, or shall give, a money gift or allowance sufficient to dispense them from having to herd with the rest. But the O.E.T. Administration, which has undertaken the organisation and care of the camp at Junction, is preparing to receive up to a maximum of 5,000 souls, the majority (over fifty per cent) of whom will, of course, be children. The camp, which is on ground good in summer, though it would be soft in winter, will have no wire except round the isolation hospital ; and all that is possible will be done for sanitation and cleanliness, washhouses and apparatus being provided. The direction will be in the hands of a Commandant, who will have under him “ Q ’’ Officers, Interpreters, etc. The medical staff will be under a British M.O. and will include a Syrian M.O. (from Salt itself), a Staff nurse and Matron, probationer nurses, sanitary supervisors, dispenser, and men to look after the disinfectors. A company of Egyptian infantry will act as guards. A free camp for a large body of untutored and undisciplined people of both sexes is a bold128 — experiment, tried in consideration of the circumstances under which the Salt refugees have come to be under our protection at all. The authorities, are prepared to learn much by experience. It is proposed to institute, for example, conveyance of the daily rations from the railway, half a mile off, by the people them selves. This plan may easily break down in practice, where there is no constraint. Sanitary and washing regulations offer another probable bone of contention between the staff and a population accustomed to go as it pleases, and insensible to what most offends our senses. For meals, a spoon and drinking vessel apiece are to be provided : sufficient dixies are at hand, and probably some kind of metal platter will be found for each mess. But such things cannot be got all at once in Palestine. Distribution into messes will probably resolve itself into grouping by families, and if quarrels over water, use of fire and so forth, are to be minimised, the control will be wise to let the people group and re-group themselves as far as possible. It is hoped that, if we are not in a position to repatriate the refugees within a short time, individuals will go off harvesting, or even, after a while, either find their own way back east of Jordan or be absorbed into the Palestine population. But it must be confessed, the chances of an Arab camp population materially reducing itself, so long as it can live at free rations and is not required to work, are not verv great ! D.G.H. TRAFFIC BETWEEN DAMASCUS AND KOWEIT. hheikh Alian ibn Hassan Ahmed of the Beni Sakhr, an intelligent youth of about twenty years of age, was captured with Lieut.-Colonel Newcombe, D.S.O., last October and taken to Damascus. I here he escaped from his guard and took refuge with friends, who arranged for him to join a caravan returning fi om Damascus to Hazil, Hayyania and beyond. The following information given by him, the main outlines of which there is no reason to doubt, shows that a considerable traffic now takes place between Damascus and Koweit. His caravan was joined at Dhumair by several others which were returning together for the sake of safety. He was told that these had all arrived at Damascus during the previous month laden with cloth, sugar, coffee and petroleum from Koweit. he combined caravans numbered, according to his estimate winch is probably exaggerated, several hundred men and 5,000 camels, the latter being owned or hired by Mohammed Bassam o amascus^ or by merchants of Qasim, Hail or Kebeisa. At idayyama, which was reached in about thirty-two days, the party split up, some going to Koweit, some to Hail, while Alian with— 129 the remainder proceeded to Aneizah which they reached after ten days. From Aneizah he went to Sherif All’s camp via Rass with a caravan consisting of fifty riding camels for sale and twenty camels laden with semin, cloth and sugar, a journey which took him twenty days, and from there he travelled by Yambo to Cairo. He states that the passage of supplies from the East to Damascus has increased greatly since last summer. The camel- men of his party told him that previously very few caravans had got through and that their own arrival had caused a great slump in prices at Damascus. It is common rumour that Ibn Baud is responsible for encouraging the trade, though whether as a means of increasing his revenue or as a result of an agreement with the Turks is a subject of doubt amongst the Arabs. The traffic is in the hands of the merchants of Damascus, Qasim, Koweit and Hail, those of the latter professing themselves to be from Qasim when they obtain goods at Koweit. When application is made there for permission to send merchandise to the interior, the destination is, of course, given as Qasim or Nejd. Caravans proceed to Zilfe where Ibn Muammar, Ibn Baud’s Boreida representative, takes dues from them at the rate of L.T. 1 per camel. This revenue is popularly supposed to go into the coffers of Ibn Baud. The caravans then go via Hayyania to Jauf, where Yuri Shaalan mulcts them to the tune of another L.T. 1 per camel, and from there they are seen through to Damascus by one of Yuri Shaalan’s men, generally Bheikh Shahwan of Bkaka or his representative. Alian states that traffic also exists between Qasim and Medina, but this is more risky as the Hejaz Emirs, have parties on the road to stop all caravans. Aneizah. All the people he met at Aneizah were pro-Turk and anti- British, chiefly, it seems, because they were getting more money from the former. Exaggerated reports of German and Turkish successes may also have influenced their feelings. The townsmen seemed to like Ibn Baud and to accept his overlordship as a matter of course. They had little good to say of King Husein or his sons, whom they regarded as kafirs, but considered Sherif Abdullah a man to keep in with since he was generous with his money. Ikhwan. Informant saw a few Ikhwan at Aneizah and Rass. They are chiefly concentrated at Ghut-Ghut, Dukhna and Artawiya and are said to muster about 6,000 armed men. Ibn Baud seems to have them firmly in hand, and Alian thought there was little chance of a large or rapid spread of the movement. He— 130 found its adherents extremely unpopular amongst all to w 10 m he spoke, and their custom of carrying out the death sentence for such offences as smoking or shaving the beard did not at all appeal to the easygoing population of Aneizah. He heard that most of their recruits were obtained from the survivors of their raids, which appeared to be carried out about once a month. Recruiting is stimulated among these by offering the alternatives of death or joining the brotherhood, but subsequent desertion is frequent. Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is on good terms with the Shammar and has recruited a good many of them. They have agreed to keep the peace on condition that Ibn Saud keeps open the trade routes and stays in his own country. Should he attempt to advance against Hail, they would oppose him strenuously. His relations with King Husein were not reputed to be bad, but with Sheikh Salim of Koweit they were distinctly strained, and he was said to be collecting recruits from Qasim with a view to possible hostilities. The Ateibah. All the Ateibah met with by Alian were strongly pro-Sherif and were looking forward to a raid on Hail, which they thought would be undertaken by Sherif Abdullah as soon as the Turks had been cleared out of the Hejaz. MESOPOTAMIA. Tribal Disputes Regulation. Soon after our occupation of Amara, Nasriya and Suq es- Shuyukh, it became clear that some specific legislation was necessary to enable Political Officers to dispose of civil and criminal cases in their aistricts without referring to the Courts established in Basra, Amara and Kasriya. A Regulation was accordingly drawn up on the lines of the North-Western Frontier Criminal Regulation. It gives Political Officers authority to deal on tiibal lines with the questions arising in their jurisdiction, and at the same time invests them with full magisterial powers to try cases which it may be inexpedient to refer to arbitration. Repoi ts have now been furnished on the workino’ of t is egulation which, after eighteen months’ experience, has shown itself extremely useful. At Nasriya, Suq and Oalaat Salih a permanent standing Majlis has been instituted, composed of leading citizens, Sunni and Shiah. A sheikh of the Sabueans is called m when any case involving a Sabaean is referred to the Majlis. At Nasriya and Suq disputes of a131 — purely municipal nature are from time to time submitted to the Majlis by an Order of Reference and in this capacity its members form a bench of honorary magistrates. At Qalaat Salih, where almost every dispute arising outside the Municipal limits has been referred to the Majlis, a verdict has in most cases been returned, but sometimes the matter has been referred for decision to a local Mufti, where both parties were Moslems, or to a Sabaean priest where both parties were Sabaeans. At Amara 266 civil cases have been dealt with under the Regulation and 175 criminal cases. Of the former eighty are recorded as having been settled and of the latter forty-four, but this record must not be taken to indicate that the remainder are pending, as frequently the disputants go off and do not return, having settled the matter amicably by arbitration or by oath. Tribal disputes are usually referred to the head sheikh, who calls on other sheikhs of the tribe if necessary for advice, and deals with the case in accordance with tribal law and custom. When the issues involve more than one tribe a special Majlis of representative sheikhs may be convened. This procedure does not necessitate any interference by Government in tribal usage and is liked by the tribesmen. At Qurna a Majlis is appointed to consider important cases, minor disputes are referred to the sheikh of the tribe in which the case arose or to the Rais el-Baladiyah if they fall within the limits of the Municipality, while in a third class of cases a neutral arbitrator is selected. No case of the last named class has arisen except disputes between villages which have been settled by the Mudir of the Nahiya. Under the first heading come chiefly inter-tribal quarrels and murders. Murder cases cannot be left solely to the decision of the tribal sheikh who might be influenced by some private partiality, but in dealing with these cases tribal custom, as administered by a Majlis, is not wholly satisfactory in our eyes. The tribesman legaids the exaction of blood money payable to the relatives of the murdered man as of greater moment than the punishment of the murderer and is apt to be content with the former without awarding other punishment. , It has been found that, as a rule, when the duties ot the Mailis have been fully explained to the members at the beginning of the trial, their awards have been honestly given, m accordance with what they think right. Their decisions are interesting, helpful, and usually sensible. The assessment of blood-money is a matter which could not be undertaken by a law court of sufficient standing to try murder cases. If the case were trie in a court at Basra the assessment must still be referred to the Mailis, involving a double series of proceedings Moreover, the local Mailis, with its witnesses on the spot, is able to amy out the work with greater expedition than could be possible foi a court at a distance, and the prompt despatch of business is a great asset in tribal disputes.W‘2 It is noticeable that the decisions of the Political Officers and arbitrators have been accepted by the parties, which shows both that they have been reasonable and also that they have fulfilled tribal conceptions of justice. The Regulation has resulted in taking a heavy burden of work from the shoulders of Political Officers, whose decisions would not in any case have been as satisfying as those of the sheikhs, and it has the further advantage of raising the position and increasing the responsibility of the latter by conferring upon them small judicial powers. PALESTINE NEWS. 1. Enemy Territory. A captured Medical Officer of Arab nationality, described as intelligent and trustworthy, states that the Sherifian revolt has caused a split in Mohammedan circles in Syria, and that wffiereas formerly the Mohammedans were united, their political attitude has now become a matter of nationality. Turks and Arabs have become enemies at heart, whatever outward appearances may be, tor the latter are secretly in favour of the Allies and the Sherif. here are very few Arabs in the Turkish army who are not looking tor an opportunity of deserting to the British or the Sherman army, and there is now no talk of the unity of Islamic people, tor this has been superseded by racial feeling.

Before the arrival of the Zionist Commission, the attitude of leading Syrians and Palestinians in Egypt had passed through a phase of uncompromising opposition to a gradual realization oi' the forces at the back of Zionism and a grudging admission that perhaps its aims were not as black as they had been painted, and that under certain circumstances the population might even benefit from a Jewish “invasion.” At heart, however, they retained a deeply felt fear that the Jews not only intended to assume the reins of Government in Palestine but also to expropriate or buy up during the war large tracts of land owned by Moslems and others, and gradually to force them from the country. These apprehensions were fostered not only by their previous experience of a rather undesirable class of Jew, but also by the attitude of the local Jewish Committee, which, possibly owing to a lack of orders as to what course it should adopt, was unable to give them any satisfaction. Everything possible was done by British Officers to allay their fears but here again an ignorance of the exact programme of the Zionists made the task of convincing more difficult. On the arrival of the Commission, the state of affairs was explained to Dr. Weissman who lost no time in meeting the leading Syrians and Palestinians and explaining the Zionist aims. He told them that it was his ambition to see Palestine governed by some stable Government, that a Jewish Government would be fatal to his plans and that it was simply his wish to provide a home for the Jews in the Holy Land where they could live their own national life, sharing equal rights with the other inhabitants. He assured them that he had no intention of taking advantage of the present conditions caused by the war by buying up land, but that it was his object to raise to a higher state of efficiency the existing Jewish colonies and to provide tor future emigrants by taking up waste and crown lands orwnicn there were ample for all sections of the community. e saic that it was his hope to establish technical and other schools which would be open to all and by which the Moslems and Christians could benefit equally with the Jews. He reassured them about the inviolability of the Moslem H'-LY a ^ es ar ' Wakf properties, and spoke sympathetically ot the Arab revolt against* Turkish’ oppression. By tacit consent, the language Question was not pressed by either side, and the proposal ot the Palestinians to institute a mixed Commission of Christians Jews and Moslems which should work to strengthen mutual good feeling and remove causes of dissension was left over foi future cons'deratmm ^ ^ ^ £rank aTOWa J 0 £ Zionist aims has produced a considerable revulsion of feeling amongst the Palestinians, who have for the first time come in contet with European Jews of good standing. They have had the convictionforced on them that Zionism has come to stay, that it is far more moderate in its aims than they had anticipated, and that by meeting it in a conciliatory spirit they are likely to reap sub stantial benefits in the future. Suspicion still remains in the minds of some, but it is tempered by the above considerations and there is reason to hope that it will gradually disappear if the Commission continues its present attitude of conciliation. It should be noticed that the Palestinians tend more and more to divorce themselves from the rest of Syria and that most of the criticisms are now coming from Syrians who, having no direct interest in the matter, seek to disguise the fact by an exaggerated expression of concern. K.C. TRIBUTARIES OF THE EUPHRATES. Mr. D. Carruthers sends the following remarks on the western affluents of the Euphrates between Basra and the Wadi Hauran :— “Until recently the western and south-western watershed of the lower Euphrates basin was but vaguely known. We have now learned that it runs across the heart of the Syrian Hamad in a more or less straight line north and south. Further south it takes in an even wider expanse of country, and actually reaches to within two hundred miles of the lied Sea. The nature of the country has made it exceedingly difficult to trace the main wadi systems. Many wadis are known in their upper courses, but their ultimate destinations are not. Some we are aware enter the Euphrates, but we have no knowledge of their origin. There has been much guess work in map compilation, and many errors have crept into the later maps. We are now m possession of so many route traverses and diaries of travellers who have crossed, or seen, a portion of this region, that it seems to be a suitable moment to tabulate the facts, and to attempt to unravel the problem. lor instance, Chesney has thirty-four wadi names across his route between Basra and Palmyra; Ihielman, m 1872, between Kerbela and Palmyra, noted only six by name ; the two routes take more or less the same line, am cioss ,ind lecross^ each other. Of these names only two cornea e . ns is a fair example of the existing confusion. I he most curious fact is the difficulty of finding the ou on o ie k_yi lan desert wadis into the Euphrates valley. Jne would expect to be able to recognise the mouth of a wadi which may have half a dozen heads, and has come for 200 miles, l et the upper courses seem to be more clearly defined than rf We know o£ onl y five important wadis astssr,139 — while by adding the Hauran arid the Saab we have the total number of big wadis which drain into the lower Euphrates from Arabia and the Syrian Desert. But by following a line from north to south, say, one hundred miles from the Euphrates under the western watershed we can enumerate the names of a score of wadis ! “ Apart from the Suab and the Hauran in the north, and the Rumma in the south-east, by far the greater number of these wadis drain into that western extension of the Euphrates basin which lies between Ramadi and Shinafiyah. Practically the whole of the Wadian district—whose deep wadi-channels are so numerous that the Arabs themselves cannot enumerate them— drains into this comparatively small area. The Wadi Khar also, which reaches to the Nefud edge east of Jauf, has its destination in the Bahr-i-Nejef. Yet, in spite of the large extent of country drained, we only know for certain of the Khar and the^ Burdan as carriers of the drainage into this basin, the big wadis of the Wadian—such as the Hamir, the Arar, and the Tebel with their score of affluents—are still left hanging in mid-desert ; we do not know their ultimate destination, beyond the fact that they drain into the region between the Bahr-i-Nejef and Ramadi. ^ “According to report (see Miss Bell’s ‘Amurath to Amurath, n 131) the three great wadis in this region are the Hauran, Burdan'and Lebaiah (really the Ubaidh). These are said to stretch right across the Syrian Desert and even to have then sources on the Jebel Hauran. The fact that there is a watershed between the Euphrates and the Jebel Hauran namely, the Jebel Anazeh and Jebel Laha, does not have its place here ; but e native idea that the Hauran, Burdan and Ubaidh are the mai wadis is important. The Hauran we know over a course of two hundred miles, but the Burdan only exists as a named ica and has never been connected with the big wadis to the west— the Hazimi and the Ghadaf. The same hoWs good of he Ubaidh, except that there seems eveai less ''kebhood °£ its bei g the recipient o£ any of the Wadian dramage.

North-West. Intelligence. Northern Operations. On April 19, British armoured cars and Egyptian Camel Corps attacked the railway near Tel el-Shahm and captured all Turkish posts between that place and Wadi Rethem. Aeroplanes co-operated in the attack on Tel el-Shahm itself, and the station surrendered during the evening of the same day. Two officers and fifty-two other ranks were captured, together with 80,000 rounds of ammunition, twelve cases of bombs, 200 rifles and considerable quantities of flour and other foodstuffs. One Egyptian was wounded. On the following day the British units occupied Ramleh station, which had been evacuated. On the 21st a reconnaissance in force was made against Mudawwara, which was found to have been reinforced by a relief train from Tebuk, and had a garrison of 400—500 men with two lon&lt;&gt;' ramm Austrian guns and two Mantellis. Five miles north of Mudawwara the telegraph was cut and a ten-arch culvert demolished the troops retiring for the night to the neighbourhood of lei el-bhahm. On April 22 they attacked Wadi Rethem.

Arab casualties are estimated at sixty killed, including three officers, and 120 wounded, including eighteen officers. French gunners took an honourable part in the attack on Maan. 1 he objectives of these operations, which are proceeding, are two, viz. the capture of Maan and its garrison, and the definite isolation of the southern part of the Hejaz railway, by a permanent severance of communication with the north. YY bile the former of these has, up to the time of writing, failed to materialise, the latter would seem to have been gained, providing that the Arabs take advantage of the opportunity created and by persistent harrying prevent the Turks from repairing the very extensive damage between Maan and Mudawwara. If operations to this effect are vigorously conducted, railway communication between Medina and the north should now permanently cease, a result which would entail the withdrawal of all 1 urks south or Maan into Medina and other isolated stations where they could be closely invested and eventually starved out. At the woist tie fact that the Southern Hejaz proved itself totally unable to provide assistance to the jeopardized garrison of Maan is o gooc augury for the future, and the result of actions of the last two weeks cannot fail to have a depressing effect on the morale of the Turkish troops and a correspondingly beneficial ettect on the Arabs.

The anti-Sherifian element is said to be reasserting itself among the notoriously unreliable population of Kerak, and to have ejected the Sherifian representatives. Jt is reported that supplies are finding their way from this district to the Turks at Kutrani, and also from the Madeba district to Salt. The Madeba Crops promise well this year owing to the abundant rains ; wheat, oats and durra only have been sown. Delegates from the main body of the Beni Sakhr, who are concentrated a, few miles north of Madeba, have arrived at Jerusalem. They have expressed their hatred of the Turks and offered their services should they at any time be required. The delegates include also representatives of the Ghanamat, Isa and Hajaya tribes, and are headed by Sheikh Fahad ez-Zeidan of the Beni Sakhr. They state that the tribesmen have buried all their feuds at the Sherif’s desire. Murzuq et-Teheimi, one of Sherif FeisaPs best officers, is with the main body. Duringour recent raid on the Hejaz railway near Amman, many of the local Bedouins took part in the fighting on our side or looted the property of the Turks and Circassians. The Turks have not yet had an opportunity of undertaking punitive measures against these tribes, but the latter are well aware that they will have to suffer for their action sooner or later, unless the enemy is defeated in this region. Should the occasion again arise, theiefoie, there is reason to believe that they will co-operate with us even more actively than before. . ^ G reported, however, that no great severity was shown to the inhabitants of Salt when the Turks re-occupied the town on the morning after our retirement.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.W — 145 — SITUATION AT KUWEIT. Colonel Hamilton, Political Officer at Kuweit, makes the following observations on the position of Sheikh Salim and his relations with the Bedouins and with Nejd : — “ Sheikh Salim is not gifted with any excess of brain and his vision is very narrow. He is quite ignorant, also, of the ways of the great world. But these defects are compensated by a profound knowledge of his own people, especially of the Bedouins among whom he has spent many years of his life. Thus his talents, though limited, belong to the category of essentials in an Arab ruler or man of action and it is by their exercise that Salim has established himself in a brief space of time very securely in the sheikhdom. Salim spent a considerable number of years among the Bedouins and the key to his character lies in this phase of his life-history. Quarrelling with his father, the late Sir Mubarak, he was banished from Kuweit; but I am told the banishment was partly, at least, self-imposed, in that a little pliability and show of submission on his part would have ensured his recall and pardon at any time. However, so strong was Salim that he preferred to quit his home and all the amenities of a sheikh s existence in Kuweit and to dwell in the desert for seventeen long years, summer and winter, rather than knuckle under to his father. And throughout this period he retained Ins father s confidence to the extent of holding command of the State forces In fact he served his father with perfect filial loyalty in spite of the latter’s aberrations from the path of true religion, which were trail and wormwood to his own dour and strictly orthodox nature. A reconciliation took place in 1912 when Salim came back to his house in Kuweit, wdiich his ironical parent had in the intervening years leased to the Christian missionaries. ' His authority over the tribes, as over his own people, was somewhat shaky about last June 01 Ju y. T nll o ue ? within and without, fostered by Sheikh Khazal aiffi Ibn Saud fboth of whom command strong parties m the 1 rmcipaiity), threatened to drive him to distraction, the more so as we were at the same time adding to his unpopularity by insisting on his tightening the blockade and discriminating between tribes, friendly or otherwise to us, in the matter of granting supplies. But Salim did not budge; he would not bend the knee to Ibn Sand or tone down his moral severity to suit Khazal. At the same time he brow-beat his own subjects, publicly insulting his officials such as the Customs Master, if_ the latter showed the least restiveness or inclination to side against him Curing this period I backed him up with the idea of planting him firmly m the saddle and restoring some sort of Government which m Jabir’s weak hands had almost collapsed. He soon turned the corner, and at the end of July I left him with some confidence I H' I :— 146 — Soon after my departure, however, Ibn Saud, who had already begun to tax the Awazim, a tribe regarded by Ibn Sabah as his very own, induced them to leave Kuweit and settle in his own territory. Then, I think, Salim began to look around him for friends in the desert. Naturally these were the Shammar and Ajman. These quickly took the hint and by the beginning of October the Ajman had moved down en masse into Kuweit territory under the leadership of the Hithlein. I his in the &lt; game of desert chess was Salim’s reply to Ibn Saud’s “ Check,” and the move put a somewhat ditt'erent complexion on the board. Ibn Saud’s next move had to be a defensive one. His position in Qasim was not altogether comfortable in spite of a tacitly acknowledged truce with Hail, because his forces had dispersed to their homes in the south. He found it expedient, therefore, to temporize with the Shammar. He allowed them into his territory on condition that they camped round the wells of Artawiyah, and his son Turki, then in charge of Qasim, gave them passes for supplies in Kuweit. So the Shammar, courted both by Riyadh and Kuweit, have had the run of their teeth both in Qasim and Kuweit, thus upsetting our blockade arrange ments, but Salim had scored a diplomatic triumph. On my return to Kuweit in October, I found that great changes had taken place both in Kuweit itself and in the desert. Salim’s foreign policy was voted clever by the people of Kuweit. He had gained much prestige as a statesman. He had become more affable and tolerant, blockade restrictions were relaxed and he had grown to be almost popular. Not that popularity is an attribute that one would ever associate with a character like his; still, Salim had developed considerably and I felt that he was bent on taking a line of his ow r n. On the whole, I consider Salim has achieved a definite personal success due entirely to his own efforts. One much regretted that this success was gained to some extent at our expense, I mean as regards calling in the Ajman and Shammar and relaxing blockade restrictions. But one could not but admire his success in overcoming internal and external opposition by his grit and daring. He has since tried a fall with us over the establishment of a Blockade Post, but in that he was up against too big a proposition and I am hoping that the result will be a warning to him as well as a ground for increased mutual respect between us. And if only the question of the Shammar could be settled by their abandoning the Turks and coming over to our side, I believe that we should not do badly in taking Salim as a counsellor, and using him as a lever for our policy in Central Arabia. Khazal is Mesopotamian. Ibn Saud is ambitious and has his own fish to fry. He will never work as our man to the extent that Salim might possibly be induced to work. :. r ^ ia . ve enough to show that, to all appearances, Salim’s -position in Kuweit is secure and his relations with the merchants (he is a keen trader himself) are good. Were this not the case,- 147 — he would hardly have taken so firm a stand in the matter of the Blockade Post, for this was actually the first time since his accession that he had failed to comply with a definite request from us. As regards the relations of the townsfolk and the Kuweit tribes, they are those of any village grocer and countryman in any country at any time. The one wants to sell and make money; the other must buy and pay and try to look pleasant over it. I think the yokel hates the grocer and the latter sees nothing but defects in his customer’s character. . u , Relations between Kuweit and Riyadh have been just about as bad as they could be, short of actual hostilities. ^ refer o course to the respective governments ; lor many on both side are against their own rulers. There may be various other causes at the root o£ this state of things, but the question °£ ™POi tence for Kuweit is the maintenance o£ the balance o£ P 0 '® 1 Central Arabia. Kuweit, which before helped the exiled Ibn Saud to recover Nejd in order to redress the balance against Ibn Rashid, now dreads Ibn Saud’s ambitious designs. The late Sheikh Jabir who was all for a quiet life, let desert politics slide Ibn Saud was able to do what he liked out of ^kThy and in a single year the influence among the tribes built up by Mubarak with so niuch money and toil had crumbled away Jhe Mnn.ir who had for some time been regarded as a Kuweit tribe, drifted back to Ibn Sand, and now, since they have come under thf influence of tl le Ikhwan movement whose nucleus is at Artawhah ni their own dira, they are bound to K^dh, literally body and soul, and thus lost to Kn ' e ' , , succeeded to the shiukhdom a year ^ iv ed so mlmh anyone all that had been lost by bis biotbei, ha g, • bow of his life in the desert among the tribes and knowing now •nportent to Kuweit it was to '-ding out the at once set about repan mg ’ ;h 7 trTbeat up the Hinterland, younger members of the Sabah fam y ^ q y mentioned, ensuecP lbn ’^d^m^'that he was in the right in taxing took place ^ o t t he tii y^/‘“tum W in Octobfr that Mm made any - complaint to us. I told him tha ‘Xt^Tould see us, we might have put ma ters |^ h *&gt; ^ there j at once what could be done m Rit aa.i. attention to the article -tackled the question, drawing Ibn baud f 3 . Uat eral behind of the treaty and reminding him of Kuwe it Kuweit which ^g ^^'g^Awazim had quitted Kuweit r e 'r.^,,dIot U dowi; hito Hasa; but as both terntonal and148 tribal boundaries are recognized in Arabia, his rejoinder^ would not hold water unless his claim to be overlord of all the Bedouin were conceded. However, he knew that he was in the wrong. He was ready to waive the point and send back the poached tribe, but wanted a quid pro quo. That consisted in a demand that Salim should turn out Ibn Sand’s recalcitrant tribe, the Ajman, and cut off relations with the Shammar, Ibn Sand’s enemies and the enemies of the dear British Government. To return to the story of July. W hen Salim saw that Ibn Saud really meant to put on the screw, instead of asking us to help, he flew at once to the traditional policy of his house, i.e. called in to his aid the Shammar and allowed the Ajman back into Kuweit territory. Since then he has had his standard out and his young nephews with it ready to resist any intrusion. Only the other day Salim, talking about the Subaih raid which he attributes to the instigation of Ibn Saud, remarked to me “ I only refrain for the sake of the Government; otherwise, thank God, I am strong—I have power.” I realized that the tension was very great when l reached Kuweit in October, but I felt that my travelling from Salim to Ibn Saud was the surest way to prevent a rupture, and so it was. Everywhere in Nejd we were met with stories ol the outbreak of hostilities but sensible men agreed that this was most unlikelv in the circumstances or my mission and the rumours were discredited. At Riyadh, as a result of my talks with Ibn Saud, I was able to pave the way to a pax. If Salim would write Ibn Saud a polite letter of request, and if he would entrust its delivery to a man who was persona c/rata at Riyadh, Ibn Saud would reply as politely and would return the filched Awazim. But Ibn Sabah must evict the Ajman. The earlier conditions have all been fulfilled and it only remains for the Ajman to be taken away, under the wing of the British Government, for there to be no ground left for further serious disagreement. At Riyadh I heard nothing but abuse of Salim and Kuweit. Salim was stingy, they said, a curmudgeon, not like his charming brother, the late lamented Jabir. He did not treat Ibn Saud’s men, when these passed through Kuweit, with the respect due to their master s station. The people of Kuweit were slack Mohammedans, they averred, mixed up as they are with Christians and Shiahs and such like. I he Ikhwan, a powerful religious society, with a following among all the tribes of Nejd, go so far as to say that the Kuweitis are surer of damnation than even the English ; the latter, poor things, are ignorant of the true religion, while the Kuweitis know, but do not follow it. In fact there is a strong prejudice against Kuweit in Riyadh. Not so in Cpsim. raid ah, it is true, does not love Kuweit anv more ian lyiyadh, but^ the other towns are more in sympathy with Kuweit than with Riyadh. Wahabism is dreaded by the townsmen of Nejd. I heir feelings are much the same as the modern Englishman’s towards Puritanism, A few yearsexperience o£ a 01d Noll and Praise G^od B.xrebones in the 17th century have given us a horror o£ that regime which has lasted down to the present time. The same is the feeling of the average Mohammedan towards the Wahabi. If the Ikhwan movement threatened to bring back Wahabism, Kuweit and the Shammar would again be called on by the Qasimis to rid them of the bugbear. , . . , Abdul Aziz ibn Saud is backing this religious moyement heavily. He conceives that it will help him to realize his ambition to establish an Arabian Empire once more. Already he is beginning to look out for opportunities to encioac y on territorial as well as tribal boundaries ol other sheikhs. He is a terrible boaster. His latest effort, brought 8 t ® other day and retailed to me by the latteig is that he will pi. his standard at Malah (eight miles rom Kuweit) as hit ancestor did. Abdul Aziz himself told me that all the ° Central Arabia, including the coast line o£ the Hotn 1 • to Oman, belonged to him, and as for the mercWs of Kuwe , had they not all come from Nejd am cou 'y. . , . j, themselves of their nationality as Nejdis or cease to be his sub ectef Salim and the Ibn Sabah are pondering these things ambitious i ^ ^ Abdul Aziz and Salim apart, there aims were not enough to y e . e P . 0 r t i ie tW o chieftains remains the sharp contrast m the f • dghi be tween them whicb wouW seen* “ SI, 8 heroic, boastful and brave in an impossibility, ion oa • i ' vp a preat orator and the Achilles style, hearty, generous &gt; m l e ’|j; |n is smaU in an inordinate lover of women ant p He too seeks stature, close-fisted, secretive, cac &lt;^ , flows him and moreover solace in the only pleasure s 0 £ Kuweit, but manages to get hold of many f P* ett f ™ msp ection.

It is as if the inhabitants were waiting apathetically to know the will of God as to their future destiny—under which King! To this universal peace, there seems only one excep- tion, viz. the unsettled quarrel between Ibn Saud and the Ajman. Only the restless spirit of Ibn Saud gives any cause; for anxiety among the Arabs. For these reasons I myself do not expect any startling developments of the local situation ; yet one s opinion must remain somewhat in suspense for the present. What will be the effect of the blockade from Kuweit, if stringently enforced, both on the Kuweit and the Hinterland tribes? What will the Ajman do, when turned away from Kuweit? Above all what is Ibn Sand’s game? These are some of the pieces to come into play. Much depends on whether Ibn Saud continues in his present policy of masterly inactivity en attendant a reaction against the ISherif, or the development of the Ikhwan movement, of which he is the patron and on which he places so much reliance. An independent Arabia under the aegis of Nejd is his political aim in a nut-shell (with himself, bien entendu, in the centre of the picture as the religious and secular head of the Confederation). What that means to the rulers of coast Sultanates, anyone can perceive; it is for the civilized to come under the yoke of the uncouth Bedouin, a condition of which they have a genuine abhorrence. All the coast sheikhs will unite against him if he attempts to put that plan into execution. We, too, should support the coast civilization, and in such an event might find in Kuweit, Qatr, Bahrein, as well as in recalcitrant Hasa, unstable Qasim and even, perhaps, in Hail itself, a most useful counterpoise. But I do not think it will ever come to that. Abdul Aziz is not a fool, nor is he the stuff that Mahdis and Mad Mullahs are made of. For such a campaign he would be without resources and his Bedouins would starve. He knows this well enough and understands that such a proposition is a very different one from that which his Wahabi forbears had to deal with, when they overran the Peninsula. Above all I do not believe that the Bedouins could be induced to fight against us. They do not hate us; they like us. 1 heir fanaticism is directed more against Mohammedans ; Turks, Shiahs and all who venerate Mohammed to the point of worship are blasphemers to them and anathema. M e English are good easy-going heathen, just, kind, respectable, and plenteously provided with the needful. 1 do not underrate the furore of religious movements, but I do believe that Wahabism is a spent force and unacceptable to all but the political fanatics of .Riyadh and the hungry light-headed nomads of Central Arabia. The Ikhwan movement would only become dangerous were we to attempt the mad task of penetrating Arabia; then, perhaps, the dormant national sentiment would be aroused and give substance to the move ment, and the necessary driving force to make it a real live thing.’'— 1.51 TURKEY The Budget for 1918. A. report lias been received of the speech of Javid Bey, the Turkish Minister of Finance, on laying the Budget estimates ol 1918 before the Turkish Chamber of Deputies on February 21, 1918. (See Bulletin 48, p. 179.) Javid Bey said that the decrease in estimated expenditure, L.T. 51,000,000 against L.T. 53,000,000, was more apparent than real, as certain items which figured in last year s estimates had been omitted in the present ones ; for instance, the sum of L.T. 3,170,000 for the Railwav Administration which now procures the necessary funds, by the conclusion of various conventions and agreements approved by the Chamber. He drew attention to the great increase in the charge for Military Pensions. 1 us ae risen from L.T. 2,500,000 in 1916 to L.T. 3,900,000 m 1917, and now stood at L.T. 5,500,000 in 1918, for 183,234 pensioners, the members of whose families were 379,289 in number, and 4avi&lt; Bey added that he thought that this number would not lie the quarter of those who would receive pensions. He estimated the normal expenditure o( the country attei the war at L.T. 40,000,000, and said that it would then be neces sary to establish a Budgetary equilibrium, but did not explain how that desirable result was to be arrived at, . . , , t With regard to the estimates of Revenue, he explained that the estimate for the Land and House Tax had been .ncreased from L T 1 700,000 to L.T. 2,100,000, that tor the Sheep lax trom LX 1'200,000 to L.T. 2,500,000, because it has been doubled by a special Law, and that for the tithe from L.T. 4,100,000 to kx 8\800,000 owing to the great rise m the price of cere ^ This sum of L.T. 8,800,000 was a min.muinXgure ^1,^116 believed that this year the tithe would reach L. • -o &gt; L.T. 13,000,000, as it had done last year. Fins, said J y» w‘is a striking proof of the disadvantages of the Lithe System, under whiA the distress of the population g.ves rise to an inCr Th7fp?rnTrfidtw^“n e round numbers, L.T 14,000,000. but as he anticipated extraordinary Military expenditure to^he extent of L.T. 60,000,000, it would be necessary to find a_o L.T. 74,000,000 for the coming year. I revision was •Orem^ made for the first six months by the recent loan of L. L 36,000, ccmcluded in Germany, of wh4 four millions m -arks were ear marked for certain purchases, in Germany and Austria, roi their further requirements, he had decided i possible no to .ssu any more paper money, but to raise an J^teriia 1 Loan at A per cent interest and one per cent bmking Fund, the mte est to be naid in gold, and guarantees similar to those for foieign loai &gt; to to lodgef with the Ottoman Public Debt Administration. J e revenues allotted to the service of this loan would be collected in paper money. Six weeks before the coupon was due, the OttomanPublic Debt Administration would present this paper money to the German Government, which would exchange it for gold, to be paid over to the holders of the Internal Loan Bonds. This would offer a double advantage : (1) by convincing the population that Turkish Notes were as good as gold ; and (2) by withdraw ing so much paper money from circulation. Javid Bey thought that the Internal Loan ought to bring in L.T. 50,000,000 to L.T. 40,000,000, but, at a moderate estimate, as there were very iTT/-»r.fo in r l 1 n»'l7-£jvT no’ ■ nor’ ppninfp.ppsf, m nnln few investments in Turkey offering five per cent interest in gold, there ought to be no difficulty in finding at least L.T. 20,000,000. If the Internal Loan failed, they would apply to Germany for a further loan and only if that resource failed them would they resort to a further issue of paper money. Javid Bey then made an elaborate statement showing that the cost of the war to Turkey, up to the time of speaking, was from L.T. 220,000,000 to L.T. 230,000,000. Coming to the question of Turldsh indebtedness he stated that the new debts, including what was due for military requisitions and loans from Austro-Hungarian Banks, amounted to L.T. 233,000,000, to be added to the old debt of L.T. 155,000,000, making the total public debt of Turkey L. T. 388,000,000. He insisted on the point that, financially speaking, Turkey had only been a very light burden on Germany, from whom she had received in marks, in L.T., in gold, and in silver, not more than L.T. 70,000,000, equivalent to the expenditure of the German Army for a period of twenty-five days. Germany had thus made less sacrifices in money for Turkey than she had done for Bulgaria. Javid Bey took credit for the fact that, during the war, the lurkish Government has collected and lodged in the Ottoman Bank L.T. 8,700,000 for interest due on the old debt to the Enemy Creditors of Turkey. He dealt at some length with the question of paper money, the total of which is L.T. 138,000,000, and the real amount in circulation is, according to his reckoning, L.T. 90,000,000 to L.T. 95,000,000. He then drew attention to what he considered the most serious danger to the country, namely the enormous increase in prices of almost all commodities, independently of the fictitious rise caused by the unfavourable rate of exchange of paper money. He gave the following instances :—at Beyrout before the war the price of wheat was P.T. 1^- the oke, to-day, it is P. T. (^ in coin, or an increase of 500%. At Konia before the war, petroleum cost P.T. 2 the oke, it now costs P.T. 40 in ^in, or an increase of 2,000%, and if paid for in paper, it costs Javid Bey’s speech, which ended with a flowery patnotic peroration, is said to have been loudly applauded by the Lhamber of Deputies, which is quite incapable of criticizing the fallacious and misleading statements of which it is made up.

During the operations in this area reported in the last two bulletins, moie than 550 Turkish prisoners were captured. Refugees report that a state of anarchy prevails at Keiak, the population being divided into pro-Turk and anti-1 m r sections. The former, which is headed by Sheikh Ritaitan, appears to have got the upper hand and is ill-treating the Christians ; among these are some 2,000 Armenians who are said to be in danger of starvation. On the withdrawal of the iurkish troops a large mob looted the Government buildings despite the efforts of Sheikh Rifaifan to prevent them The latter is believed to have left for Salt towards the end of April to meet Kuchuk Jemal Pasha and probably to request him to send forces to Kerak. According to a later report, six 1 urkish otticeo from Madeba and 150 cavalry from Kutrani have now reoccupied the town at request of other members of the Mujah ^mily, an the inhabitants have been forced to return or refund the value o all the Government property which they looted. 1 f ^ ^ are said to be arranging convoys for the transport suppl • from Kerak to the railway. p | a ' d t0 co-operate with it east of the Jordan.

Just before daylight the Arabs attacked Zumuriud and kept the garrison in the fort. They engaged the gun of the fort and kept it employed, so that when daylight broke it was not able to do any damage to ourselves as we were returning across the open. Only about four shells were fired into the retiring force, and the Bedoflins stuck to the gun for a good hour after day-break.' The Arabs have forced the I urks to retire from the Jebel to the Station at Istabl An tar. On April 22 a French detachment with a contingent of Sherarat destroyed six kilometres of railway and telegraph line, one twelve-arch bridge and two culverts between Toweira and Bir Jedid.

Money is flowing in from abroad, a sum of £30,000 having come in the shape of remittances to persons residing in the Jerusalem district, chiefly for purposes of relief. Large numbers of people are employed on the roads and high salaries are being paid. The cost of living is higher than before the war, and perhaps higher than before our occupation, but the good wages the people, now receive enable them to pay their way, and if imports are steady and prices controlled, the population should have nothing to complain of. In spite of rumours of impending Turkish attacks and of the definite defeat of France by Germany, England being left to carry on the war alone, the Egyptian Bank Note has risen to full value ; this rise is chiefly due to growing trade activity.— 155 — The wheat and barley harvests are drawing near, and are reported to be particularly good this year in the southern maritime plain ; and i£ the supplies from east of Jordan could also be secured, the economic situation would be a satisfactory one. Owners of vineyards, and fig and olive orchards are busy plough ing and digging, and as the rains have been abundant, there is every prospect of a large supply of grapes, figs, olives, olive oil, etc. in the autumn. Tlie grape crop of Salt is said to be worth about L.T. 100,000 per annum, and this year it is expected to be unusually good. There are also a large number of horses, cattle and donkeys in good condition in the Salt neighbourhood. Some dissatisfaction is shown by the Christians of Bethlehem on account of the non-compliance of tne local Bedouins with the order to surrender all arms. Ihe Christians in genenn have handed in their arms, and they are disturbed by the^ fact that they are left unarmed whilst the Bedouins still retain theirs. Several of them have applied to keep them on the ground that they are employed in the fields and vineyards outside the town, and must have some protection. , The non-Jewish population in occupied territory «rea y appreciate the action of the Government in not allowing the sale or transfer of land at present, and are hopeful that their interests will be safeguarded in future.

Reports from the Yemen indicate that the capture of Loheiyah by Idrisi and his subsequent operations m the Beni Abs and Beni Jama districts were considered by the Turkish authorities to have created a very serious situation. Aot only di Husni Bey acting Governor of Hodeidah, and llias Bey, now Kaimakam of Bajil, display great activity in endeavouring to enlist the support of the Tehama tribes, but the Vah and the G.O.C. of the Yemen Army Corps, Ahmed Tewfik Pasha, both visited this front during March. I here is reason to believe that they decided on the recapture of Loheiyah, but the only success hitherto achieved by the Turks, in this neighbourhood was the engagement at Mur (see p. 134), where the Ldiisi force consisted mainTy of Beni Yam tribesmen (see p. 95). The Sheikh of Mur, who some time ago announced his allegiance to Idrisi and offered to fight for him, has novy arrived at Midi where he has furnished guarantees of his good faith. The Vali returned to Bajil at the beginning of April, and is believed to have again visited the Idrisi front with the object, inter alia, of effecting a reconciliation between Tbn el-Heij and Ibn Thawab (see p. 69). It is confirmed that all the Hashid and Bekil mercenaries have returned to their homes. Nasir Mabkhut is said to be lying ill in his native village. Yemen. The Vali has summoned the notables of Zebid to meet him at Marawah, probably to arrange measures for checking any movement on the part of Sheikh Mohammed Hassan, whose secret overtures to the British have caused him grave concern. A special messenger reached Sanaa in March bringing despatches from Enver Pasha to the Yemen authorities. He is said to have travelled from Constantinople in ninety-four days via Nejd. The financial condition of the vilayet is described by a reliable authority as being very critical, and war contributions have been exacted, not for the first time, from the British Indian community to enable the Government to tide over its immediate pressing needs. Customs duties levied on merchandise in the Tehama have been increased from five to twenty-five per cent, but the receipts at Bajil and Marawah have considerably declined owing to the paucity of supplies now going to the interior through Idrisi ports. It is unfortunate, however, that the illicit traffic between Jibuti, Eritrea and Yemen ports has increased appreciably. The Lahej bazaars are reported to be well stocked with all kinds of supplies, but prices are still very 7 high. A report from Perim states that the Turks have attacked the Zaraniq for refusing to pay taxes, and that forty-seven Turks and sixteen Zaraniq have been killed.Aden. A punitive expedition, consisting of about seventy Turks and Somalis, was recently sent against the Subehis (Bulletin No. 50, p. 219) who had refused to pay taxes. The expedition appears to have been successful, as Shahir el-Mansuri, their leading sheikh, and eight of his akils were taken and brought to Lahej. It is reported that they have been tried and committed to jail for an indefinite period. On April 9, Seyyid Ahmed Pasha of Taiz arrived at Lahej and was received with honours by Ali Said Pasha. His visit was partly for the purpose of enrolling Arabs for military service, which hitherto has met with little success, and the latest report states that he has left with Hassan Husni Bey, Head quarters Staff, on a tour of inspection south of Lahej. He is also believed to have persuaded Ali Said to send reinforcements to the Loheiyah front. On April 14, 150 Somalis arrived at Lahej from various camps to the south ; they were paraded in the square in front of the Palace and left for Hodeidah the same evening. They were followed next day by sixty Somalis and one company of Turkish infantry. The remainder of the Somali battalion, some hundred men, have apparently refused to serve m the Yemen.SECRET.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau,— 159 — PALESTINE NEWS. Salahiah College, Jerusalem. Ahmed Jemal Pasha founded the so-called Salahiah College at the beginning of 1915 in the precincts of the Church of St. Anne, in imitation of Saladin who maintained a famous college in the same place. Jemal’s idea was firstly to ingratiate himself with the Arabs by giving them an Arab University run on apparently liberal lines, and secondly, by putting his own men on the staff, covertly to create pro- Turkish and pan-Islamic feeling. Like many other Turkish enterprises it began with a flourish and ended in smoke. It acquired a reputation as a eentie of pan- fslamic propaganda, but it is now clear that practical 1\ nothing of this kind existed. Sheikh Sha.'wish was at first the moving spirit, but attei a month or two he had differences with Jemal and left. I he Director was a certain Jemil Bey who being by descent an Aleppine could just be called an Arab. He had, however, become thoromdilv Turkish, his wife was a daughter of l urkhan Pasha, former' Ambassador at Petrograd, and he could scarcely write Arabic. Though credited with being fanatical, he seems to have exercised very little influence. He concerned himself it at a ll only with the business side of the college, and took long trips to Germany buying laboratory apparatus which was presented bv Enver The sheikhs on the staff seem to have been woiti} bid men who knew a little of their subjects but were neither capable nor desirous of exercising any political influence on 1 1 boys What influence existed in the college at all seems to have been that of the more modem Arab teachers, and as ™ch inust have been diametrically opposed to the object 0 . Turkish appears to have been taught m a very dilatory way. Instruction in ordinary subjects was in Arabic. There were between 200 and 300 boys-all Moslems^ including about ten who came from Medina and one oi two from remote places like Morocco, Tripoli and Kazan, who Wpened to be in Syria when the war began. There were onh Uo k There were no fees, the boys benig ^nght, clothed housed and fed gratis. The yearly budget was L. T. iO.OOO (^0 and besides this the bulk of the supnlies-fcKHl |ml obtained gratis from the Turkish aim) . - ' , . paid. The school appears now to have been moved to Aleppo. Examination of Correspondence. The following general conclusions may be drawn from the examination of cofrespondence passing through the hands of the Censorship in Occupied Enemy territory : . Letters written by Jews are almost without excepti favourable to the British occupation and adnunistration as com pared with Turkish rule. There are some complaints ot the— 160 — dearness of living, and delays in affording facilities for trade and travel, but allowances are made for the difficulties arising from the state of war and the requirements of the army. Little or no hostility is shown towards other races and religions, ihis is perhaps due in part to the present elation of the ^ Jewish population caused by the visit of the Zionist Commission and their belief, somewhat too freely expressed, in the early establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. With regard to correspondence in Arabic, letters^ from Syrian Christians are almost unanimous in their expression of satisfaction with our occupation, but they express great appre hension on the subject of Zionism. There are comparatively few extracts to hand of letters from Moslems, although these form a large majority of the population. This is partly accounted for by the large number of illiterates among them, while they have few correspondents in Egypt or in Allied and neutral countries. Armenian correspondence seems unanimous in expressions of joy at the arrival of the British, appreciation of the conduct and bearing of our troops, and desire for vengeance on the Turks for their cruelties to the Armenians. Some Armenian merchants, however, express the fear that undue favour is being shown to the Jews, who may thus be enabled to monopolize the trade of Palestine. Much importance cannot be attached to the few letters from Germans in Jerusalem and Jaffa which pass through the Censor’s hands, as these would naturally be cautious and reticent under present circumstances. But it is gratifying to note that they all recognize the moderation and humanity with which they have been treated, though they sometimes express their feelings rather grudgingly. Pr&lt;&gt;paganda. Propaganda work is in full swing in Jerusalem. Newspapers and illustrated matter are distributed in four reading rooms and ten cafes and barbers’ shops. Telegrams are posted on Notice Boards at three of the city gates and in the principal street inside the city, and a reader has been engaged who visits all the cafes and city gates, as well as the Haram esh-Sherif, and reads aloud the news to the illiterate, showing them the illustrated matter. He is a favourite and in great demand. The publication as propaganda of General Allenby’s despatch has had a remarkable effect on public opinion. The discovery that the British defeated the Turks with only two Army Corps was a revelation to the people of Jerusalem, who were under the impiession that the British fighting force numbered at least a quarter of a million.ARABIA. North-West. fntelligence. Northern Area. Jerdun station has been reoccupied by the lurks. On May 3 a repairing party on the line near that place was attacked by Arab regulars, who again damaged the line and took about twenty-five prisoners. As a result of recent operations south of Maan, commuiuca- tion with Mudawwara has been completely cut, no attempt having been made by the Turks to re-establish the posts between these places In order, however, to ensure the permanent destruction of this sector of the railway, an Egyptian demolition party has left Akaba to destroy an important water supply at 1‘asoa and the terraced escarpment at Batn el-Ghul.

The following information has been supplied by General Staff, Force in Egypt, under date May 9, 1918 :— Mohammed Idris, with Ali Pasha el-Abdia, was still at Suetina on April 15. He has 800 men in training under four Italian officers and thirty N.C.O’s. Some of the Arab sheikhs are reported to have agreed to send one third of their men to be trained as soldiers. The outpost line consists of posts a day’s journey apart, each of about forty men with stronger detachments on the flanks, at Marade and on the coast near Marsa Brega.

The following notes have been contributed on this subject:— The Committee of Arab Brotherhood. The despotism of the Committee of Union and Progress and its disparagement of the Arabs in its press and clubs at Salonika and other places at the beginning of the Revolution produced in the minds of many enlightened Arabs a desire to establish a Committee to protect the rights of their nationality. This project was strengthened by the refusal of the Unionists to accept Yusuf Bey Shetwan as member for Benghazi, and Shafiq Bey Moayyad as member for Damascus, in the first session of the Ottoman Parliament. The Arabs, accordingly, resolved to form the Committee known as “The Arab Brotherhood,” and appointed a Central Organization in Constantinople and branches throughout Arabia. It was at the end of August, 1908, that pourparlers began between the founders to establish this society ; in September they completed its programme, a printed copy of which came to Syria in the beginning of November. Its members included Shukri Pasha el-Ayyubi, the late Shafiq Bey Moayyid and Arif Pasha Mardinli. It onlv lasted until April, 1909, when the Groveinment suppressed the Committees which had been founded by non- Turkish elements. Its programme was to guard the rights of the Arabs w ithin the Turkish community. The Kahtaniah Committee. Some of the Arab officers who were in Constantinople at the first announcement of the Constitution kneuq from the state ments of Turkish Unionists and from the official l&gt; a peis w hic thev read in the head office of the Committee of Union an Progress in Salonika, that Javi.l Bey, Drs. Nazim and Nm and many of their Unionist friends had placed £400 000, collected by subscription, with several Jews at Salonika. Lins was done with the obiect of working for a Unionist Turkish administration to which 111 the nationalities of the Empire should be subjected by fc ' &lt;e '[-’ 0 r this reason the officers in question agreed with their fellow-countrymen whose patriotism was beyond suspicion to form a Secret Committee which they called The kahtania . This was formed in 1909 with branches m all Arabia. The most influential member of the Committee was Sekm el-Gezain, Lieut.-Colonel on the Staff. . . , i ij The principles of the Committee were that the Arabs shou d depend on their own efforts and instruction; that they should have the same rights as the Turks m the Ottoman Empire , that the injustice from which the Arabs were suffering only existed— 160 — because the latter did not demand their rights; that it was consequently the duty of every member of the Committee to incite the Arabs to do so, though being faithful Ottoman subjects, and that if the Government rejected their lawful and just claims the Committee would take the measures necessary. The Arts Club, 1909. After the Proclamation of the Constitution the Young Arabs came in great numbers to Constantinople to finish their studies. At the dissolution of the Committee of “ Arab Brotherhood” several of these students, in agreement with the Arab deputies, formed a Club to serve as a means of liaison for all Arabs living- in Constantinople. It adopted a definite programme and its chairman was Abdul Kerim Khalil (sinceexecuted by the Turks). Its objects were to allow the young Arab students, the deputies and all Arabs coming to Constantinople to know each other, to discuss their grievances and to work for and defend their rights, in such a way as not to trample on the rights of anyone else. I his club remained open till the beginning of the war, when the mobilization having called to the colours the greater number of its members, the Club was closed. The Committee of the Covenant, 1909. This Committee was formed at Constantinople by civil fitary officials. Its founders entered into relations with the Kahtaniah, and the two Committees were united. Their programme was dissiminated in the Army. The Committee of the Covenant resolved to enter into reations with all committees existing outside Constantinople before the war. a u^ S evei 7 man who speaks Arabic and fives in Arabia, whatever be_ his creed or religion, should be respected an lave full lights in Arabia. It demands autonomy for the x ra js, am expects its members to work for Arab interests, as the i urks work for theirs, without showing hostility to the latter. hevolutionary Committee. Of this Committee nothing was ever discovered except its name. n spite of several attempts the Unionists never knew and fi erson . e onging to it. It is possible that it never existed as on y an idea in the over-heated brain of certain people. ihe Committee of Reforms, 1910. deckWl that , of the Balkan war the Arab patriots of tho nvlVf 6 a mim ^ ra tive anarchy which existed on account reor^aifiz^t^on^ P f° u 7 °! the Un “ c°uld only cease by the exneiMenppfl ° • 16 at ™ lnistrat i°n, and by placing capable and dEsTflT m 7 G°r nment P° sts: question na 6 issed and it was decided to elaborate plans of reform tendingto give to the Ottoman nation a system based on decentralization. The Government promised to place this plan in execution without delay, but failed to keep its promise, which convinced the Arabs that the Unionist Government did not want reforms but wanted to keep the Arabs in submission to their authority. The Committee was dissolved at the conclusion of the Balkan war. Decentralizaton Committee, 1911. In consequence of the increasingly despotic methods of the Unionists, the Arabs in the Chamber of Deputies created a party with the name of the “ Liberal Moderate Party,” and all who opposed the Government rallied to it. This was in the year 1910. In 1911 the party of Union and Liberty, “ 1’Entente Liberale,” formed a party composed of all the elements—both non-Turkish and Turkish—who were not members of the Committee of Union and Progress, The programme of this party was decentralization. At the same time a great number of Arab deputies encouraged their constituents to claim openly their rights, and committees were created throughout the Empire under the name of Decentralization Committees. This policy was never recognized or authorized by the Government, Its authors were, on the contrary, accused of conspiring against the unity of the Empire and of' wishing to detach Arabia from Turkey to deliver it to Europe. It became a practice of: the Unionists at Constantinople to accuse all those who opposed the Government of being members of the “ Party of Decentralization.” But all who read the programme of this party, which has been printed and published, and 0 the proceedings of the Arab Conference at Paris m 1913, can see that the charges of the Committee of Union and Progress were without foundation. The above societies are described by Ahmed Jemal Pasha in his book “ La verite sur la question Syrienne,” published in 1916. In that book he deals also with one other, “ Le reveil Libanais, which, he states, was eventually amalgamated with the Party of Decentralization.— 168 — SYRIAN NEWS. A well educated and intelligent Armenian deserter gives the following account of the treatment of Armenian deportees in Northern Syria :— In the Municipalities of the towns there are special officials who register the names of deportees, and who are supposed to provide food and shelter for those in need. As a matter of fact, food is never distributed, and the deportees, mostly women and children, suffer greatly from hunger, and are obliged to eat herbs and grass. At Aleppo there is a workshop to provide work for deportees, but it can only employ a very small proportion of the total number. At Hamah, Homs, Damascus, Kuneitra and neighbourhood the Armenian deportees are able to earn their living thanks to their industrious habits. At Damascus, especially, they are doing fairly well in various branches of trade. Armenian women, girls and children of the poorest classes try to make a living by selling bread in the streets. I he same informant reports as follows on enemy propaganda in Northern Syria :— In all important towns, tea-rooms, reading-rooms and Intelligence offices are established with the special purpose of cultivating good relations between Turks and Germans. German newspapers, magazines, and more particularly illustrated albums representing German victories are supplied in these establish ments. These publications insist on the fact that in spite of the Allied blockade German warships and merchant vessels navigate the seas fearlessly, and often visit oversea countries to get raw materials. Much space is also devoted to the exploits of German submarines. Many articles are published to impress on the reader the idea that physically, as well as morally and intellectually, the Geimans are superior to the Allies. German scientific methods aie explained to audiences composed mostly of Turkish officers, and these efforts are having a considerable effect on the minds of those who have the destiny of the country in their hands. Briefly, this propaganda serves to convince the leading element m lurkey that Germany is really the most powerful nation in the world, and that nothing on earth can defeat her armies. Needless^ to say, these ideas do not reach the masses, w 10 are quite indifferent to all kinds of qiaours. whether German, English, French or Russian. Hundreds of Turkish boys are sent to Germany and Austria tor the purpose of technical education to serve in the advance ment ot trade and industry in Turkey. An intelligent Jewish refugee, who arrived in the British im.s 10111 Galilee, states that several thousand camels, laden with goods from Mesopotamia, reached northern Syria last winter. Damascus and Beirut were flooded with these goods and thelocal markets greatly relieved. This statement appears to confirm the report by Sheikh Alian (p. 128) on traffic between Damascus and Koweit. A Syrian Medical Officer captured on April 30 states that harvest prospects in Syria were good, but that less land than usual had been tilled and sown, labour was wanting, and farmers could not get the necessary manure owing to the lack of trans port. The livestock in the country for agricultural purposes was not more than twenty per cent of the normal, and in miserable condition, and grass forage only was available for the civil population, as grain was too dear. Fuel was very scarce, and even the olive trees were being cut down. 1 he silk industry in the Lebanon was practically dead ; the people were rooting up the mulberry trees and planting fruit and vegetables. Sheikh Abdul Aziz Shawish is reported to have left Constantinople for Syria with presents for Ibn Rashid and other cluofs In Damascus the Germans have about ten shops selling hardware, leather, cloth and military outfits. They do very well as they get their goods by rail from Germany without any difficulty. The owners of these shops were German civilians in Damascus before the war. The prices are the same as those of the native shops, but the goods are far superior. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. at that place and at Batn el-Ghul, a two other vans. Eight kilometies c were removed.— 170 — i! 1 On May 14 the enemy re-occupied Jerdun with three companies o£ infantry and three guns. On May 17 Arab regulars, supported by aeroplanes and two armoured cars, again attacked and temporarily gained a foothold in the station, but they were heavily counter-attacked with machine guns and bombs, and were compelled to withdraw on tlm arrival of an armoured relief train from Kalaat el-Aneizah, losing thirty-five killed and about fifty wounded. They took fourteen prisoners, and the enemy’s other losses are believed to have been heavier than theirs. . British aeroplanes are active in bombing and dispersing enemy working parties on the railway north of Maan. The gendarmerie occupying Kerak (see p. 161) have now been increased to twenty mounted and forty dismounted men under the command of a Major Osman Bey. Sheikh Rifaifan has been made Mutessarif of Kerak and received a Turkish decoration. Sherif Feisal, however, has received a letter from Sheikh Kerayim el-Mujali offering to arrange a combination of the pro-Sheri £ elements of the Mujali against Sheikhs Rifaifan and Husein el-Tarawnah. Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza (see p. 153) who is under the orders of Sherif Nasir, Feisal’s principal commander in this region, has been instructed to advance, if possible, to the Kerak plateau to support Kerayim. Sheikh Metgal, of the Faiz section of the Beni Sakhr, has been collecting recruits for the Turks, and is believed to have raised some 300 tribesmen. Inhabitants of Hebron going to Kerak and Tafila, and refugees going to Hebron from those places, complain of ill- treatment by Bedouin between Bir Saba and the Ghor. Cases of highway robbery and murder have occurred, the victims being in some cases volunteers going from Hebron to join the Sherif’s army. Many more would probably volunteer if they were not afraid of these Bedouin. Armenian refugees from Kerak have also been robbed by the Bawarsha Arabs at Kefrabba, an hour’s journey south of Kerak ; these Bedouin were instigated by Sheikh Rifaifan, who is anxious to prevent the escape of the Armenians. Some hundreds of them, nevertheless, have arrived at Hebron and been sent on to Jerusalem. They complain bitterly of their treatment by the Mujali and especially Rifaifan, who makes them work for him as slaves. Southern Area. Sherif Abdullah has moved south with 400 regulars and about 6,000 Bedouins, and had reached Bowat on May 8, Sherif Ali having sent a force with three guns to join him there. He has deputed a force of 500 Arabs to watch the eastern road from Medina, and a convoy of 300 camels attempting to reach the city has been captured by Sherif Nasir ibn Ghalib.— 171 On about May 10 a party of Sherif Abdullah’s Arabs damaged the important bridge over the Wadi Hamdh near Abu Naarn. On the afternoon of May 11 the southern wing of his army, under his personal command, attacked the defences of the large bridge south of Bowat. The attack was well carried out and several enemy posts were captured, but owing to lack o artillery support the bridge itself was not reached. 1 he Arab casualties were two killed and one wounded ; the Turks hast about twenty killed, twenty-four prisoners, and about thirty dive rifles. On May 12 Sherif Abdullah proceeded to Sherd Ah s headquarter ^ detachment p as destroyed a^ nine-arch bridge at Malal, west of Muheit (see Bulletin 26, p. ^1).

A distinct Arab Bureau for Palestine has been instituted at Jerusalem by the Commander-in-Chief, E.E.F., under the control of his department of Political Intelligence. The staff placed in charge has been lent by Arab Bureau, Cairo. Some difficulty has been experienced in finding a suitable permanent location for the Bureau at Jerusalem, but this is being overcome. The purpose of the new Bureau is, primarily, to be a house of reception for those Arabs who come into Palestine from, or on behalf of, our Sherifian allies. These are often Bedouins, who after delivery of their messages, disappear into the purlieus of Jerusalem and fade away without notice unless more hold is kept on them than it has been possible hitherto to keep.^ The new Bureau will register the arrival of such, arrange their lodgings and keep track of their movements. Also it will supply a place of reunion, where some hospitality can be extended Arab-wise, meetings, when desired, can be held, and the necessaij me lation with the British administration can be exercised. It should prove very useful, in the immediate future, as an assistance to the Arab 'recruiting committee, which is being sent to I alestme bv Sherif Feisal. However much we desire to leave such a committee to do its work by itself in its own way, we know by experience that Arab incapacity for organization and ignorance of European administrative methods will inevitably cause such a committee to apply to us for constant control, information and help. Secondarily, the Bureau will serve as a centre for Intelligence about the state of affairs beyond the Dead Sea and the Jordan, and incidentally, for propaganda. But it is not h,tended that it should assume so much the chai-acter of an European office, as the Arab Bureau m Cairo. _ ^ 01 ^ nd more like a semi-Arab house run by a staff jointly Bntn native The best of the Salt Moslem chiefs has been engaged o h^ the reception of the Arabs and it is hopedJiat Jerusalem notables will attend from time to time, telegraphic address is “ Arbur, Jerusalem. IBN RASHID. About seven months ago the relations of the Turks to then- “only Arab ally,” the Emir^Saudibn “ ^^een r'lkXTr’'tryho induce Fakhri Pasha to orgamze an exnedition for the recovery of Teiina had there »| e n P U P ^rmiyZe' auXrizZn of a Teima expedition, but also guns— 174 — small arms, ammunition, money and food supplies for his personal use. Abdul Hamid Bey, the delegate of the Fourth Army, stayed with the Emir to look after and watch him on behalf of Ahmed Jemal Pasha, and the O.C., 58th Division, had to see to the wants of the Emir’s camp, which contained a considerable and, according to deserters’ reports, truculent and unruly following of mujahidin, brought down, in August, 1917, from Hail. i'hey had been about a thousand strong, but there is reason to believe that they had already diminished in number, chiefly because the Emir failed to pay them for doing nothing whatever. He had had, and would have again, passages of arms with the Turkish military authorities about their pay ; but he never succeeded in inducing even his best friend, Jemal Pasha, to find cash for the purpose, the Turks having no confidence whatever that they would get any return for their money. Thanks to this question, the Emir’s relations with Abdul Hamid Bey were strained. Nor were they better with the O.C., 58th Division, who, after grumbling at having to pass on to Ibn Rashid scamp during three months special supplies of better quality than he and his troops received, now found himself ordered to draw on his own commissariat for the Hail men. Shortly afterward, the Emir, pleading fear of air-craft and raiding parties, moved his camp to a point among the Heir rocks some distance east of Medain Salih station, and was presently aware of hostile Anazeh tribesmen of the Fuqara and Aida tribes, with whom he was at blood feud, hovering on his desert Hanks and maintaining a loose blockade of the Hail roads. In the hope of relieving his situation Abdul Hamid Bey asked for the release of the Hiqara chief, Shehab, from Damascus. That situation, however, continued unrelieved for a good three months, and before long the O.C. made of it an excuse to picket the ? a,lip h lri ° rde r ^t only to confine the unruly mujahidin t .1 bounds, but also to control communications which he suspected were passing between the Emir and his blockaders. from Hn 11 ' COmpl T e f’i: UK °- C - ^ 0t a rap knuckles from Damascus ; but he had good reason, as we know, for his suspicions, since Sherds Ali and Abdullah had both tried to tamper with Ibn Rashid, through Sheikhs Aqab el-Ajil and redlT 6 Th^V 6 ^^-J elj ’ an . d 1 had received temporising verbal replies. The Emir did not wish to break with the Turks while there remained any hope of a successful issue of his ao-ent’s mission to Constantinople ; and if that, in the end should fail did ^ ^ - ** - the tor„ ,l„ Emii- to commit l,i,„„lt. Ho' cnmo ,?1„ ,S The h ’assumDtfoP° ‘r p 8 '!'' cam l&gt; &lt;md inspected the mujahidin. Uie assumption, which Fakhn appears then to have made evident, that these men were under his own supreme command( — 175 — gave great offence to the Emir. He was left, however, no choice but to comply with mn order, that he should take two hundred selected camel-men under his leadership and move southward towards Hadiyah in company with a Turkish force of double that strength, commanded by Fakhri himself. It was this column which surprised Abdullah Mudhaifi and his Bedouins on February 18 (see p. 68), and caused momentary panic in Sherif Abdullah’s camp, and momentary question in our minds whether, after all, Ibn Rashid might not still have to be reckoned with as a serious factor on the enemy side. Further knowledge, however, of the circumstances under which he had . taken the field soon dispelled any fear, and prepared us for what followed. After a short stay in Wadi Um Hashim, he and his camel men went back to Medain Salih, where, during his absence, the cam]) had been attacked by the Anazeh, without much effect ; and shortly afterwards a' number of letters from him, captured by the Sheridans, showed that he was exceedingl\ unlikely to be of any more use to the Turks (see p. 93). In these he expressed deep distrust of his allies and masters, and practical certainty that his Agent was being detained in the north without prospect of securing any of his demands. So matters continued thioug i March and April, the Emir’s sulky existence at el-Hejr being relieved only by the necessity of resisting an occasional Anazeh raid (see p. 110). According to the credible report of a Medmote refugee, the Emir was contemplating departure lor Had all this time About March 20, according to this informant, his waktl wrote secretly to a supporter of the Emir m Medina, warning him to -join up as soon as possible at Medain Salih, or fadm to tilt, to go off direct to Hail ; and in April Sheikh Shukn of he Fuqara received a letter from Ibn Rashid himself, stating tha he had done with the Turks, but did not intend coming mto Kiim Husein. This letter was passed to Sherif Abdullah, and word was sent to the Anazeh to watch the Had roads. The Emir had warned the Turks that, fading satisfaction ot his requests through Rashid ibn Leilah, he should try to go back to Had He offered his good offices there m the matter ot tian, - mission of supplies, if he were himself fnrm^d - two and other munitions for his journey. the Turk sh m htaiy authorities were not unwilling to be rid of him and , , desired to send him off in as favourable a temper as might be, but their promises continued unfulfilled till news arrived of extensive demolitions effected on the railway and the attack on Maan about the middle of April. We^^^bihty of guns, and other supplies being sen C( )^ n if -mined t ] ie o r\ l*’ Q irmo- time to come, seems to have deteimmeu me F^mir to make an end of the matter ; and on April 30 he starter off Lrth eastward^ in the direction of Teima, with a considerable An * Hp seems to have left part of his mujahidin behind, in consequence of some outbreak or mutui).176 — It is not, however, to be inferred that Ibn Rashid himself has broken definitely with the T*tirks, although in a recently captured mail, he is reported to show himself unfavourable to them, and to refuse to help their supply transports. The presents, which Sheikh Abdul Aziz S ha wish and Nairi Bey are said to have brought down to Syria for him, will, no doubt still be duly forwarded to Hail. The reports that have come to hand concerning the Emir’s subsequent adventures must be taken with reserve. Certainly he succeeded in reaching the neighbourhood of leima without being seriously molested, though Ferhan el-Aida is said to have followed his tracks. Either he went too fast, or was in too great strength, or (not unlikely) he had made an arrangement with his blockaders. Somewhere near Teima, however (the place mentioned, Teima el-Awazi, must be one of the two or three small oases which are known to exist outside the main walled town) he was set upon (according to a report transmitted by Sherif Sharaf to Sherif Abdullah) by one Khalaf ibn Paid, said to be an Anazeh, and if so probably a Wuld Suleiman, chief leading Teima folk. The Emir is said to have suffered heavily, losing sixty-one men, of whom thirty were killed, and also some eighty-five of his camels and eleven of his horses. Another report definitely mentions Wuld Suleiman assailants, who took twenty horses and fifteen camels ; but whether their attack was different and subsequent to that mentioned above is not clear. Afterwards the Emir is said to have escaped north-eastwards, leaving Teima on his left hand, into a waterless district (the Nefud ?), and we have since heard that letters from him, dated at Hail, have fallen into Arab hands. What will be done to him, or what will he himself elect to to do, at Hail ? The body of three hundred Ateibah tribesmen, who were bidden on their way home from Feisal, to threaten Hail, in order to call Ibn Rashid off the Railway, will, presumably, refrain on finding him flown ; and we have no reason to suppose that Abdullah has sent any force to support them. The Emir will therefore have to reckon only with those of his own house hold, and his own town and tribe. What their attitude will be towards him, it is futile to speculate. We have no very recent report of public feeling in Hail. It is sure to be influenced mainly by the supply question. If food cannot be procured in sufficient quantity except from Mesopotamian markets, agreement with us vill be demanded of the Emir. If the Ivuweit contraband route can bring enough supplies (see p. 180), as it very probably does at present, overtures will not be made to us yet, and certainly none to King Husein. The latter is nervous about the possibility of Ibn Rashid making an independent agreement with us, which would bar the realization of Sherifian ambitions Jebel Shammar, and would like us to treat with the Emir if at all, only through himself. But to accede to this wish would be tantamount to recognizing Husein’s right to be— 177 — u King of the Arabs ” ; for on no other ground, could he claim to control the destinies of Hail. Other elements of uncertainity in the question are the actual dynastic position of the Rashids ; the present feeling of the Shammar towards the Emir ; and the eyes with which I bn Saud might view the latter’s restoration. The Rashid dynasty has always been ruled, largely, by the harem, and subject to rapid mutations by the expeditious method of family murder. Are those, who have controlled Hail for nearly a year, for or against Emir Saud now ? Is there any likely successor? The Shammar have been a much divided tribe for some time past, some standing in with Ibn Saud, some with the Sherifian cause and ourselves, some with the Turks and the Emir. Should the Emir re-establish himself in Hail in independence of King Husein, tbn Saud is more likely to come to an agreement, with him, than to attack him. In any case the situation in Jebel Shammar in the near future is likely to have more than an academic interest for ourselves. ARABIA. North-west. Intelligence. Northern Area. Sherif Nasir and his Bedouin force have kept up their useful pressure north of Maan by rushing the station at el-Hasa on May 25 and taking seventy prisoners and some machine guns. This operation was followed up by the occupation of Farafra station, whereby the total of prisoners was brought up to 125, includ ing three officers, and of machine guns to four. These occupations, however, are never intended to be permanent. Sherif Nasir’s force cannot be provisioned for more than ten days at a time, and he must proceed by guerilla methods only. Two days later a regular Arab force, supported by armoured cars, attacked the railway south of Jerdun, and the cars broke up a strong counter-attack from Maan. The enemy suffered thirty casualties, while the Arabs had an officer and four other ranks wounded. Enemy air-craft have been causing casualties among Feisal’s detachments, and he asked on May 29 for counter action by our Air Service against Kutrani. It appears, however, from our information that Kalaat Aneizah, where alone there are hangars, is the real source of the trouble.— 178 — Southern Area. SheriE Abdullah’s forces attacked Bowat again on May 19 while those of Sherif All went for the line near Hafira. Neither force accomplished much, the defences of the Bowat bridge being found reinforced. The station, however, was damaged by tour hours shell-fire. An armoured train came up from Medina, but the Arabs had already succeeded in rushing one strong detached post. Other outlying posts formerly occupied were found evacuated. Frencli Algerian and Egyptian detachments wrecked about five kilometres of permanent way north of Bowat: and this break, together with others effected previously, we are informed has not been repaired. A repair train is reported stranded in Bowat station without wood or water, and with the line broken north and south. . On May 21 the Fuqara under Sheikh rahad are reported to have captured an officer and 100 camels near Medain Salih ; and on 24th the Erwa Juheinah, of whom we have not heard, since the surprise of Abdullah Mudhaifi on February 18, attacked a post between Abu Naam and Stabl Antar, killing seventeen Turks and capturing thirty-six with forty rifles, forty mules and three camels. Altogether Abdullah’s irregulars seem to have been commendably energetic of late. _ # Sherif All has carried out his intention of moving his headquarters back to Bir Derwish, trom which he reports that he finds the defences of Bir el-Mashi evacuated at last. Ali proposes to raid the roads east of Medina to stop supply convoys and has himself gone in that direction with a small mounted column, two mountain guns and four machine guns. His main body remains at Bir Derwish. According to recent hearsay information, the Ageyl of Qasim still push very small convoys through, attracted by the very high prices offered by Fakhri. On May 12, according to Captain Depui, the Turks were again evacuating women and children. General. Of the two small expeditions despatched by King Husein on his own account to outlying districts on which he has a very precarious lien, if any at all, that to Joz Belair is held up, having lost the Abadila Sheikh, Sultan, and is waiting for reinforcements ; that to Khurma has presumably arrived by now and established the garrison which the King considers necessary to counteract Riyadh influence in the place. He states that the local Emir has been trying to levy zakat and he seems to infer, rather than to know, that this was done on Ibn Sand’s behalf. Meanwhile it is to be suggested by us to Ibn Saud that he withdraw his agents thence, if any there be. But to which potentate the place may rightfully belong it is impossible to say Perhaps to neither. Dr. Weizmann, the leader of the Zionist Commission, accompanied by Major Ormsby-Gore, is to pay a flying visit to IEmir Feisal at, or inland from, Akaba, and left Suez for that port on June 1. It is hoped that Lieut.-Colonel Lawrence may be able to meet him on arrival and introduce him to the Emir. King Husein came down on May 27 to meet Colonel Wilson at Jiddah. Among other things occupying his attention are the dhow-traffic question, to which we shall refer in our next issue, and the question of his own “Kingship of the Arabs”, which he never allows to sleep very long ! NOTES. King Husein and Ibn Saud. King Husein has sent to our Agent at Jiddah, under date May 15, a letter in which he expresses more plainly than usual his personal view that the Emir of Riyadh is not playing an honest game, but using the protection, which he secures under our treaty with him, to go counter to our interests in Arabia. “ You have already been informed,” the King writes, “ of the oppression of, and encroachment against, the I ribes who have been firmly bound to the Emirs of Mecca from ancient times to the present day, in a way clearly pointing to his (Ibn Sand’s) intention to override their local rights. Yes, such encroachments and intentions, nay greater than these, should not be attended to in view of the present situation and what may result from it (ironical). This is our way and^ course of action especially since he accepted money from Medina and sent it to el-Yemen and since he refrained from opposing Ibn Rashid and “ But our object, now, in informing you of this is the effect on men’s minds, inasmuch as he is known and famous through his alliance with Great Britain ; and his rise to-day and his determination to commit such acts, and anything leading to discord, firmly establish and point to the fact that he is following the path of Ibn Rashid in helping the policy of the lurks. His intention to help them against us, while he is an ally of Great Britain, who is managing our affairs—this is the importan point which will produce anxieties of all kinds in the minds of all people of the country and will affect the course of the orderec political life of the country which continues and, God willing, will continue.” . . , The King, however, concludes his letter with an assurance that the force he has sent to Khurma will avoid encroachment on Ibn Sand’s territories ; and at a subsequent interview which Colonel Wilson had with him at Jiddah for the express purpose of impressing him with the necessity of keeping on terms with— ISO — Ibn Saud, the King placed himself unreservedly at our discretion, putting his two hands to his forehead in the attitude of submission. The truth about the tribes in question (see p. 27) is that King Husein is claiming a right which, on Sherif Abdullah’s evidence (see p. 12), had virtually lapsed. If it had not been exercised during three preceding reigns, that is since the Emirate of Abdullah, it is very unlikely that it was exercised pre\dously while the Emirs were puppets in Egyptian hands or under Wahabite domination. Further, there is no doubt that the allegiance of all of these tribes is a very precarious plant, whose roots need constant feeding with gold if it is to survive at all. The natural instinct of the Sbei, for example, who are in question at Khurma, makes them look rather to Riyadh than to Mecca ; for they are Hanbali, with Wahabite sympathies : and King Husein, knowing this fact, has tried to coerce them through another tribe, the Buqum. We may confidently expect, therefore, constant recurrence of this sort of trouble, not merely in the Asir hinter land, but also anywhere in the great Ateibah country. A fourth tribe, claimed for the Sherifs, namely the Meteir, seems also to have been going more and more Wahabite of late. K mveit—Damascus Contraband. 1 he same Arab, whose report on the above subject was given in our No. 86 (p. 128), has been back at Jauf el-Amr and returned. IIis outward journey took him nine days. What he has lo tell now is, on the whole, confirmatory of his previous information. He found Nawwaf ibn Nuri es-Shaalan in residence at Jauf and up to his neck in contraband business. No doubt his father, Nuri, is equally guilty. Nawwaf pockets L.T. 1 per camel and takes a share of the petroleum carried, while other Rowalla notables levy a mejidieb or two when and where they can. A big caravan of 2,000 camels laden with cloth, petrol and sugar, chartered by Mohammed el-Bassam, was halting at the moment on its way to Damascus. Ibrahim el-Hablani, a big merchant of Aneizah, was in charge, and he was to proceed north under the conduct of Sheikh Shawan, Nawwaf’s man. The route would lie through the harm via Rueishid, Juweif and Dhumeir, care being taken to give Jebel Druz a wide berth. The original consigners at Kuweit are two members of the Sagr familv, Hamad and Shahin, together with Mohammed el-Thanaiyan and usem er-Rumi. In Qasim the traffic has the energetic support of 1 ahad el-Maamir, Ibn Sand’s governor of Boreida, the obscene individual whom Raunkiaer and Shakespear encountered. He tarns his toll per camel. Other men of Qasim in the trade are Ibrahim Humeidi of Boreida, an Ageyli, and other Ageylis of Aneizah v ] z. Suleiman el-Ghurmas, and Ibrahim er-Ribdi, while filial el-Mtein of Kuweit, and Abdul Aziz Omar of Zubeir are co-operators. Caravans break up on leaving Qasim into small )odies, and go via Hayyaniya, Hazil and Truba to the Jauf1S1 — rendezvous. With this traffic going on and halt Qasitn getting rich on it, we need not discredit the report that King Husein’s shares are very low there, and our own not much higher. But we need not necessarily accept all the common Jauf talk of Ibn Sand’s own connivance in the trade and communications with the Turks. From the Euphrates side Kabeisa used also to do an active contraband trade in cotton and other commodities. Small caravans of fifty camels passed to and fro on a roundabout Damascus road via Jauf and fetched stuff up from Kuweit. King Husein's Grandfather. The events, which led to the Dhawi Zeid losing the Emirate of Mecca and the grandfather of the present King being installed and retaining power, are worth rescuing from obscure contem porary authorities which record them. In or about the year 1827, the Emir Yahya, son of the Emir Serur, regarded Ahmed Pasha, who was acting in Hejaz for Mohammed Ali of Egypt, as an enemy ; and, finding that Shambar, a nephew 7 of his owm was in frequent relations with the Pasha, he stabbed the suspect in the precinct of the Kaaba. Yahya then took to flight, and joining the Harb, raised them against the Egyptians, and defeated Ahmed Pasha in a battle at Arafat. As matters seemed to be taking a serious turn, Mohammed Ali represented to his suzerain that it w 7 as not prudent to allow the Emirate to remain always in one Sherifial family, and having under his hand, in Cairo, Sheri! Mohammed ibn Abdul Mu’in el-Aun, of the elder (Abadila) branch of Mohammed Abu Numei’s descendants, and grandfather of King Husein, he invested him with the Emirate and sent him to take possession with five battalions of nizam and a thousand Moo'hrabi horse. The new Emir, Mohammed, landed at Yambo on October 5 ; and, with the reinforcements brought by him, Ahmed Pasha was enabled to assault Taif, where Yahya was installed. The latter fled, but was captured and sent to Cairo. It was not, however, till Emir Mohammed had received at least one sharp lesson in subservience, that Mohammed Ah allowed him to feel safe on his throne. u , . i Four years later, when the Pasha of Egypt had invaded Syria, Sultan Mahmud II tried to restore die Dhawi Zeid bherit Abdul Mutallib, a young son of Ghahb Emir before ahya ibn Serur, was then living at Brusa. Mahmud sent for him to Constantinople and with gorgeous ceremonial created him Lm of Mecca, presenting him, after the investiture, with his royal portrait framed in brilliants. This was noted as an anti-Islamic proceeding characteristic of a free-thinking ti ip i. Mutallib was sent off to Asia Minor to join Husein Pasha, then on the march to reduce Ibrahim Pasha to obedience : but news of the Turkish disasters at Homs and Beilan forestalled the iunction and it was not till nearly twenty years later (IcSolJ that Abdul Mutallib was able to supplant Mohammed Ah s1&lt;S2 — nominee. He was turned out again five years later; but had a second and briefer tenure of power m his old age, after the assassination of the present Kings uncle, Husein, at Jiddah in 1880. Arab Commission in Palestine. . . A small mission, consisting of three prominent Syrians resident in Egypt, has been allowed to spend a few days ui Palestine, in order that it might visit Jerusalem and Jalta, acquaint itself with the actual political and economic state of the Arab-speaking population, and report to us on its principal needs. It was given every facility by our military authoiities and it seems to have been well received. It found Jaffa, of course, troubled with more serious economic problems than Jerusalem, where the questions at issue are mainly political. At the latter place it was occupied with combating the very natural apprehension felt about Jewish aims, which even the careful and moderate speeches of Dr. Weizmann have not robbed of their terrors. At Jaffa the same apprehensions were added to jealousy of Jewish trade, and the economic problem presented by the irrigation and maintenance of the town s staple culture, oianges. The members of the Mission believe that their visit has had a calming elfect on public opinion ; and they are proposing to our administration various remedial and subventive measures, through which they think, present distress and commercial embarrassment may be tided over, and the Arab-speaking population may get a fair chance from the opening of the next agricultural season.

Abyssinia. The revolt against the Council of Ministers, reported on p. 114, was directed by the lesser officers and supported by all the troops in Adis Abeba. The officers pointed out that the country was lapsing into chaos and that the Ministers were merely enriching themselves at the expense of the public, and they demanded the abolition of the ministerial posts, the arrest of the individual ministers and an examination of their accounts. The Empress and Ras Taffari submitted to these demands, and the ministers, with the exception of the Fitaurari, were arrested and deported to their private lands, being allowed to take only thirty followers each and to appoint representatives to go into their accounts. The Army further insisted that the Empress and the Regent, with Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis as adviser, should take over the sole responsibility of the Government.

Attempts at reconciliation by the priests having failed, Dejaz Kassa has been declared an outlaw and excommunicated. He is said to be making his way to Wolkait or Simyen in the hope of obtaining adherents. Simyen has been given to Dejaz Ayalei and Wolkait to his brother Dejaz Admasso. To Ras Gfuksa has been given Gondar and Begyemdir, provinces of the late Waldi Giorgis. These appointments meet with general approval, as the three chiefs in question are known and liked in their new districts, with which they have been connected in the past. Dejaz Kabada, now ruler of Gore, is carrying out a policy of trade obstruction, and declines to recognize as legal any of the acts of his predecessor, Dejaz Ganami, declaring that nothing which has been done between the death of Ras Tesama and his own return to the district is valid. Consequently all concessions and acquisitions of land granted or authorised during the interval are treated null and void. There are constant quarrels between Dejaz Kabada and Dejaz Bern of Sayu as to the governorship of the Gambeila district, which is claimed by both of them, while the Government declares that this district is Crown property and that neither of the two Dejazmaches has any jurisdiction there. Dejaz Kabada is a drunken debauchee and entirely unfitted for any post ot authority, and it is hoped he will be removed before long.SECRET. Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, June It, WJS. No. 92 SUMMARY. SITUATION OF THE SHERIFIAN REVOLT. IBN SAUD AND HIS NEIGHBOURS. TOUR IN KHARJ. ARCHAEOLOGIST ENEMY AGENTS.— 185 — j7^ SITUATION OF THE SHERIFIAN REVOLT. Four months have passed since the last summary of the general situation was issued in Arab Bulletin, No. 80. Then Emir Feisal had thrown his left wing across Wadi el-Hasa, and, from his headquarters at Ain el-Beida, was operating with his right against the section of railway between Maau and Mudowara. His later movements have all tended to concentrate the northern and central portions of his forces, which are now holding the Semna position, 5,000 yards to the south of the town of Maan, dominating it with the station ; while from his head quarters at Abu Lissal he keeps the Turkish garrison in Maan loosely invested. Raiding operations have been entrusted to Sherif Nasir, who with his flying column, is harassing the enemy’s line of communications between Maan and Amman. The stations north of Maan have had a chequered history during the last few weeks, Jerdun, for example, having changed hands no less than four times ; while so persistent are tlie Arab raids on the line, that up till now the enemy has been unable to repair the breach between Maan and Jerdun. The tribal situation in the north however is, at the moment, less promising that it was. After much shilly-shallying, Nun Shaalan has made it quite clear that he does not mean to help anyone but himself, and he and his son are actively promoting enemy trade through Jauf el- A Mr. The Rowalla policy is prac tically also that of all the great Anazeh aggregate in the Syrian Desert. From the Amarat in the south-east to the feclaan m the north all stand outside the revolt and carry on as of old. While there is evidence that the Druses of the Hauran are more definitely anti-Turk than they were and ready to come out a^ soon as they are supported by an adequate Arab force the bem Sakhr, the Belqaa tribes and all tribal Arabs lying north of these have, not unnaturally, been discouraged both by our two with drawals from es-Salt and by Feisal’s failure to hold Kerak, wheie t he pro-Turk Majalli chiefs are now supreme While some ot the nomadic Beni Sakhr keep the field with the Huwe.tat, most ( ,f the tribesmen who own lands, have been compelled to patch u &gt; a pelce wTth the Turks and hold their hand till better tunes. Of the Belqaa tribes, almost all are still loyal to the Sheiifian cause and us* but Sultan ibn All el-Dhiab is definitely pro-1.urk and try in a hard to regain his paramount influence and take his old confederation with him. A northward move, either by Feisa or bv us will very quickly put a new complexion on this tubal situation ; but till such amove can be P«~t « ^““ less to exited, anv active Bedouin co-operation north vutiam. ‘ P The attack on Maan itself, made on April 10, was not an fiTlhe^bXoV the' IX m'ttte” comparatpy 8 heavy— — 186 — of the enemy Higher Command, which was forced not only to leave the garrison of Maan to fend for itself, but also to suffer the wholesale destruction of the line to the south. L he situation of Maan at the present moment is not unlike that of Medina in the early stages of the Arab revolt, temporarily cut off from its base, surrounded by a superior force, but well armed and provisioned and daily expecting relief. The inhabitants of Maan (the town itself is about a mile distance from the station^ are in communication with Feisal, and were the defenders to give any clear proof of weakness or fail to supply the local people with provisions, the potential enemy within the gate might prove dangerous. It is to the south of Maan that the chief success has been scored, and one of the primary aims of the Hejaz operations attained. The whole of the line between Maan and Mudowara— a distance of sixty miles—has been in our hands since the middle of April, so that systematic destruction of bridges, culverts, station-buildings, reservoirs, rolling-stock and telegraphs has been carried out. To make good this havoc in itself would be a task calling for a large number of men, and probably more material than the Turks could well supply ; while even were the siege of Maan raised and the Arabs forced to withdraw, the enemy would have to repair the line in a waterless region subjected the whole time to the hornet-like tactics of the Arabs. It is more than probable that the Turks themselves are still in ignorance of the extent of the damage wrought in this sector. Arab operations offer little encouragement to the would-be prophet ; but it does seem at last as if Medina were permanently severed from Maan and the North, and the garrisons of the intermediate posts and stations were faced with the alternative of either running the gauntlet of the besieging Arabs or starving. So far as the southern Sheridan forces are concerned, one of the most satisfactory signs of the times is the change in the attitude of many hitherto neutral or covertly hostile tribes. More than a thousand of the Billi have come in to Sherif Abdullah, while over 8,000 Sherarat and 500 or 600 Fuqara have promised allegiance. This cannot but have a salutary effect on the local tribes who have been rather too sure of their position ; they now realise that unless they bestir themselves, the subsidy, thev had come to look upon as an assured income, will be diverted to the newcomers’ pockets. Abdullah s forces have done a great deal of useful work on the line. They have disposed of several small Turkish parties, and damaged over 5,000 rails and numerous culverts over a distance of 400 kilometres. The weather has been a most useful all) in this respect, whole lengths of line and embankment having been swept away by sells. Early in May, Abdullah marched south with a mixed force of Bedouins and u regulars ” and joined hands with Ali at Bowat. I he combined force now numbers ovei 12,000 men. Ft is satisfactory to be able to record theincreased activity of Ali round Medina, perhaps the most satis factory feature being the weakness confessed by Fakhri in permit ting the demolition of the railway within twelve miles of Medina itself. As regards Medina, the last incoming train arrived during the second week in April, and now that Ali’s cordon has been drawn closer round the city to the East, there is little chance of the garrison being able to obtain such scanty supplies as formerly reached them from the blockade-runners of Qasim. In fact Ali’s force has intercepted more than one party of these traders, who had been tempted by the high prices offered by the Medina com mander to anyone who would run a cargo through. The position of the beleaguered garrison, according to the reports of refugees, is serious ; the men receive only a small daily ration of bread and dates. Unless the report be true, that Fakhri has sown a large area round Medina with wheat, the garrison can look for no further supplv of food till the date harvest, four to five months hence. IBN SAUD AND HIS NEIGHBOURS. We have received interesting notes of conversations between Colonel Hamilton, our Political Agent at Kuweit, and the Emir Abdul Aziz, at Riyadh in November last. Although developments have taken place since, these Notes contain nmch information of political value in relation to current events. W e give therefore the following extracts : /. Ibn Sabah and the Ajman. “Ibn Sand’s attitude towards the Ajman has undergone no change. He considers it quite hopeless to arrange any terms witlAhem, as they are born and sworn enemies of ins and are notorious even among Arabs for treachery and disregard of al contracts. They do not obey their sheikhs and frequency set at non edit tribal customs of fundamental importance. Moreover the Ajman have not abided by the terms imposed upon them by the Government with Ibn Saud s consent and approval, as &lt;lr. up at Kuweit in November, 1916 As soon as Ibn ^ to gather the clans for his march upon Ibn ,S'd nmKr all the sheikhs of the Ibn Hithlam, went off to Ibn Rashid a d takinn Stetion upon his flank immobilb/ed a large proport,cm of Ibn Sand’s force L \contributed to the general failure of ins intended offensive. They have only come in now because hey Ire hard up for provisions. Ibn S-ul cpside^ and -thniv will convince him of the contrary, that Ibn Sabah s (ha im o KuweTt) allowing them to enter his twritones - a^mctly unfriendly act and is so undeistoo \ a ia • ’ ^ pj s with 1 bn Sabah are entirely on account tribes taxation of the Awazim (who, be says, with all the dcs\\H If — 188 — really belong to his confederation) is, he hints, his reply to Ibn Sabah’s unfriendly conduct in harbouring his enemies the Ajman. He greatly dislikes Salim personally in spite of the fact that Salim is so strict a Moslem, so severe a Puritan, that he is as Wahabi as any man jack of the Nejdis. Salim is close-fisted, he says ; but another reason, I suspect, is the mutual jealousy, felt in this instance to a greater extent by Salim than Ibn Sand. Just as the latter complains that we have shown in comparison with him undue favoritism toward the Sherif, so Salim asks me why we subsidise Ibn Sand to the extent of £5,000 a month, implying, though of course not saying, that we do nothing for himself. ^ * u There is much to be said for Ibn Sand’s attitude towards the Ajman. From old times these tribesmen have been rebels. Time after time Ibn Sand and his forbears have been compelled to inflict severe punishment, but the A jman have proved incap able of reform, remaining natural rebels—a sort of local Irishry, for whom there is no remedy but to be placed outside the Pale. It is acknowledged universally that the Ajman do not obev their sheikhs in ordinary times, though ready enough to follow them and obey them implicitly in war. Their best friends and blood connections, such as Ibn Sabah, admit that they are unreliable and notorious brigands even among Arabs. 1 hoped last year that the tribe had perceived the necessity for a policy of friendly submission to the British Government and that they would remain passively in the tract allotted to them between Kuweit and Zubeir. They however chose to go after Dhaidan,the friend of Ajaimi and the Shammar, who gave out to them and others that the 1 urks were about to send 30,000 men down the Shamiyah bank of the Euphrates to help their partisans. It must be remembered that Ibn Sand has great difficultv in managing the great confederation of tribes which have acknow ledged his religious and secular leadership. According to him thev consist of Muteir, Awazim, Beni Hajar, Manasir, Ajman, Beni \nalid, Beni Abdullah, Qahtan, Duwasir, Sbei, Salmi, Anazeh, Ateibah and Harb. That is to say, practically all the tribes of enha Arabia. Over some of these his dominion is somewhat shadowy no doubt, and, as regards the Harb at least, it is in dispute with the Sherif. vi ni &lt;U l i 1U I he question of submission to Ibn Saud wrt i i Dhaidan himself and learnt from his lips that the tribe won &lt; prefer to wander for ever in strange (liras rather than to return under Ibn Sand, f have little hope that he is likelv to prow eomp iant . le will probably take the tribe with him for vh, i , wii K i dir '- 11,11 Sa»&lt;l says that the fwo hX : r; rel,el 10 ? a, .' W '‘ ut l-ssim muster more y'' .! lat ^ th ' Sabah or Zubeir have not the ( to fl,em, he will undertake the job. Tbri Saud knowsthere is a likelihood that we shall take him at his word in this instance and is prepared to move upon a signal from us. My opinion is that the Ajman, who have grown weaker as a result of their wanderings, will cave in to Ibn Saud, unless the Shammar give them asylum or we take responsibility for them again at Zubeir or elsewhere. 2. Ilm Rashid. u Ibn Saud says that to capture Hail is a very big matter. He and his forbears have been fighting for the past forty years with this object in view, the net result being nil after alternations of partial successes and severe disasters. Never have they been within sight of the conquest of Hail and the Shammar. The strength of this tribe lies in several factors which it is important to remember. To begin with they are a single united tribe; secondly, Ibn Rashid is himself a Shammar sheikh. ^ ^ ^ “ Add to this that the Shammar are stiff fighters ynd are always ready to take on superior numbers of mixed Nejd clans. They are redoubtable antagonists and if in full force, as they mio-ht'be were any serious attempt made upon Hail, it is very doubtful if any combination of tribes could defeat them, at least in or near Jebel Shammar. And failing a coup de main there would probably ensue a desultory siege of the. town and hills. The Turks might render relief ; and m any case, unsupported by regular troops, a loosely held together Bedouin confederation would soon tire of the job and break up. “ Ibn Saud thinks that the economic lever applied by means of a strict blockade would be the most effectual means of bringing the Shammar over. This however, he realises, is scarcely piac- ticable, with the A slam and other sections exempt and engaged all the time in blockade running. If we treated ali the Shammar as a corporate body, and refused to have an) further relations with Ibn Tuwalah and other sections now posing as friendly until the whole tribe submitted, there s not the slightest doubt that the Shammar would be isolated to such an extent that they would have no alternative but to sunendei. ThTscrew must similarly be put on the Anazeh, they ^ be 'TtiA: tTS-in Te 3' Centra, 1 Arlan tmffic 8 should be in bis hands; that he ^up^tioif of u nbipf market towns under Butisli occupauo. suzerainty ; and that these agents should be consulted before any export passes are granted. 3. The Sheri/ of Mecca. King' o£ the^Hejaz, ^ ofEtag^f— 190 — receiving large subsidies from us and not only has gathered round him all the clans of the Hejaz and neighbouring districts, but has also drawn to his side all the Ateibah and Harb, tribes which I bn Sand claims as belonging to him. Latterly large numbers of Ageyl or Nejd townsmen, attracted by high pay, have levanted to the Sherif from Anazeh, Bureidah, Sharqah and Mudhnib. These Ageyl represent some of the best fighting stock in the country. The Emirs of Anazeh and Mudhnib assured me that no less than 4,000 of them had joined the Sherif’s forces from Qasim alone, and these do not include Bedouins. “In the course of conversation Ibn Saud has frequently appealed for equality of treatment with the Sherif. He hints that we have left himself in the cold while doing everything for his rival. He complains that we have not given him due credit for his espousal of our cause and uncompromising hostility towards the Turks ; he even claims credit for the fact that, but for his benevolent attitude toward the Sherif and his holding the Sharamar in check, the former’s rebellion would have had no chance of success. He said that he had resisted many tempting offers from the Turks who were always attempting to reopen negotiations with him. As proof of this latter statement he showed me a letter from Fakhri Pasha, Commandant at Medina, asking him why he had not replied to his friendly letter of the year previous. I saw also the letter referred to. Both appeared to be quite genuine. If he has been carrying on any intrigue it has been with Fakhri Pasha’s superiors at Damascus or elsewhere. It is rumoured and universally believed that he has received subsidies from the Turks, and while marching through Woshm I was told that a party of nine Turkish and German officers had just cleared out of Riyadh and passed me near Shaqrah going in the opposite direction. This I hardly think likely : in fact it is very improbable, though some of Ibn Sand’s entourage are pro-Turk, or at any rate in favour of a policy of hedging against a possible return of the Ottoman Government. It is not an uncommon occurrence, as we have found in Mesopotamia also, that where there are two rival sheikhs or sections and one is for us, the other turns pro-1 urk. In the case of Ibn Saud and the Sherif we have befriended both, though naturally doing most for the Sherif who has rendered such great services to the cause. Ibn Saud however thinks we should treat both equally. His mind harps on the question of the post-bellum conditions and oscillates distressfully between the disadvantages that would accrue to him according as the war should result in the victory of the Allies or the Central Powers. We have sometimes thought that his possession of Hasa, a district of such great importance to his Emirate, from which he expelled the Turks a short time before the war, would be an overwhelming argument in our favour, Decause he could only hope to keep it by holding on to our skirts. But such, 1 am reliably informed, is not really the case. Whichever side should win, he does not believe he will be allowed ito hold on to Hasa for long, in view of the well-known cupidity and acquisitiveness of Great Powers. What is certain is that should the Allies win and the Turks be driven out of Arabia he will have the mortification of finding his rival the Sherif firmly established as an influential and powerful monarch able to count on the support of Great Britain and the Mohammedan world ; while he (Ibn Sand) remains a mere Bedouin chieftain, as he was before the war, but with the Shammar and Northern Anazeh irretrievably lost and the Sherif claiming overlordship over the border tribes. If, on the other hand, the Central Powers conquer, as he thinks they will, he will have the satisfaction of seeing King Husein go down, while as regards his own position he relies on his political acumen to drive some sort of bargain with the Turks. “ This does not mean that Ibn Sand is pro-Turk. He hates the lurk as his ancestors did, and he likes and admires the British, infidels though they are. But it is a matter of policy, and when policy is concerned he must regard the matter entirely from the point of view of self-interest, i.e. the interest of his dynasty and the Wahabi faith. He will not be induced to take any action unless the object is justified primarily in these interests: in other words he has got it into his head that he is not going to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for us or for any one. This is perhaps the reason why fbn Saud has not attempted seriously to take Hail or performed any noteworthy feat during the war. He hopes that when our subsidies cease, the tribes now supporting the Sherif will return to their former allegiance. He says that the Sherif is already on bad terms with some of the Harb, and told me one day with manifest elation that the Barqah section of the Ateibah had been converted in a body to the ‘ Ikhwan,’ a religious brotherhood, which Ibn Saud is fostering to the utmost of his ability. “If the view of Ibn Sand’s policy which I have endeavoured to set down is correct, it can be seen how foolish it would be to expect any thorough going co-operation from him even if more liberally subsidized. Indeed it is quite probable that any additional subsidies we might give him would be used to buy back Harb and Ateibah chiefs who are now with the Sherif. “What would fully satisfy Ibn Saud is as follows (but considerable modification of it would be accepted !) :— “(i) That we should observe towards him the same policy of trust and confidence as we pursue in the case of the Sherif. “ (ii) Treating him on an equality with the Sherif, we should acknowledge his hegemony in Nejd, Central Arabia and its dependencies ; and, as we have conceded the style and title of His Highness King of the Hejaz to the Sherif, we should proclaim himself as His Highness the Hakim (or Ruler) of Nejd. “ (iii) That all tribal allowances made by us to the tribes of Central Arabia, including the Anazeh and Ateibah, Muteir, Sbefi Beni Hajar, Qahtan, Dawasir, Manasir, Ahl Murrah, Beni4 f !«[ |:i] — 192 — Abdullah, Sahul, Ajman, Shammar and Dhafir, should be paid through Ibn Sand and the British Resident accredited to him. “(iv) That the British Government should be permanently represented by a Political Resident. u ( v ) That the control of the caravan traffic to the interior from Kerbela, Samawah, Khamisiyah, Zubeir, Kuweit, Qatr and other markets should be delegated to Ibn Saud and his British Resident, the former keeping agents at each of these markets. “(vi) That subsidies should be granted him, with war material, and the loan of engineers and instructors in proportion to the magnitude of operations expected of him or of the armed forces he is required to keep up. u (vii) That we should assist him to re-establish trade in the ports of Hasa by arranging for a regular steamship service with India. u (viii) That the terms of an agreement on these lines be reduced to a formal document or Treaty similar to the existing Treaty. In the second treaty the position of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud would be defined and the succession of heirs of his body would be guaranteed. On his part Ibn Sand would agree to act in subordinate co-operation with us in an offensive and defensive alliance, engaging specifically not to enter into any sort of relation with any other Power but the British, or with any Arab Chief or nation, whether under our protection or under the protection of another tribe. TOUR IN KHARJ. A member of the Nejd Mission, Lieut.-Colonel F. Cunliffe Owen R.F.A., made a short round in December^ 1917, from Riyadh into the district of Kharj (or Yemamah) which les south ot Aridh. It had not been visited previously by R n U u°n ean ex ^ reme noi 'G&gt;-eastern corner, through p ’f Captain Sadlier passed in 1819 on his way to find Ibrahim as la. hough Colonel Owen does not say so expressly, we un erstan that the. particular motive of his excursion was a esire to see the Fmir’s horse stables, and to test the truth of reports that, the main breeding and grazing grounds of Neid are ni a taij. In another part of his Report he expresses some fn , ap f 01,Um f lt at tlK ; horse-supply of Nejd as a whole, where he saw 1] 110116 to b^ 1 'export even at prohibitive prices : but he nYlTdA !'° h '' dred Ugli-class animals, to whose breeding ol ltl T?

Ehey are not dipped or groomed, and thehoof, shod with plates, is allowed to grow long. They scale up to fifteen hands. Of inferior animals there is no abundance. Colonel Owen reckons that, in Nejd, not one Bedouin household in ten possesses a horse. Colonel Owen seems to have found Kharj a grazing country, as it had been reported, with much cultivation and appearance of material prosperity in the Suleimiyah district. Good tracks lead from one village or town let to another. His outward route lav through Masani, three quarters of an hour’s march from Riyadh, from which point he bore south-east away from Wadi Hanifa towards the main Toweiq range. He passed through a considerable foothill tract, in which he saw a good deal of grazing among the rocks, and reached the crest of the range in about seven hours going from Masani. The slope is more gradual on the south, where Suleimiyah lies in a wide plain, about forty miles from Riyadh. The Farzan stream (see Arabia Handbook, i., p. 360) is blocked with growths, and the cultivation is irrigated, not from its waters, but from numerous wells and springs. The Emir’s stables lie an hour and a half’s walk from Suleimiyah on the Dilam road, and Yemamah lies an hour distant. Beyond mentioning that there is irrigated wheat cultivation all round and that cotton, originally imported from Egypt by Ibrahim Pasha, is grown, Colonel Owen unfortunately does not describe either Suleimiyah or Yemamah in his report. He went from the latter town to Dilam by way of the Emir’s stables, the journey taking five hours, across wheat fields at first, then over a vast open plain with scrub, where cattle were grazing, and finally through hummocky sand-hills to the date-groves of Dilam. The last he found a prosperous, clean, well-kept town, the most important place in the district and the centre of very extensive gardens ; but he is desperately economical of description ! From Dilam, Colonel Owen went north to Naajan, a poor village among sand hummocks, and then made towards Hair in a westerly direction, leaving behind him a southerly offshoot of the main range, which skirts the Yemamah plain. After Wadi Ausat is left, the sand changes to fertile plain, and about four hours from Dilam the northern foothills begin. The crest of the main range is passed in another hour and a half. Thence there is a drop through rocky country in a westerly direction to Wadi Hanifa, whose valley is followed up for three hours to Hair. This is a small settlement in the bed of the wadi, which is there joined by Wadi Dhrumah. There are very large date-groves and abundant water. Crossing a low rocky spur and a plain Colonel Owen reached Masani again in four and a half hours march from Hair. We could have \yished for a good deal more descriptive detail about this hitherto almost unknown country; but must be thankful for small mercies.— 194 — ARCHAEOLOGIST ENEMY AGENTS. The enemy has been making quite as much use as we have ot‘ the archaeologists, who were engaged in the excavation or exploration of Ottoman territory before the War. The familiarity with out-of-the-way localities and with native ways and means of transport which such men possess, and the close relations, generally much more intimate than a consul’s, which they have held to native populations, obviously fit them for special missions and agencies. Reference has often been made in this Bulletin to one of these, Max Freiherr von Oppenheim (see especially page 26), who, at one time, was the chief German missionary to the Arabs. Just before the War, he was con ducting excavations, in which the Kaiser took a peculiar interest, at Tell Helif, near Ras el-Ain, the Baghdadbahn railhead. Very well known in Syria, as in Egypt, he did not enjoy a good reputation either for morality or humanity ; and despite his Hebrew origin, he was not reputed to be well understood or liked by either his Semitic or his Kurdish employees. Another well known excavator is, in all probability, the Hauptmann Andrae, who is, or was very recently, at Aleppo at. the Central Control of the Missions on 'the Euphrates and the Tigris. This man is no doubt Walter Andrae, who, for nearly twenty years, was in charge of the German excavation of Asshur, at Qalah Sherghat on the Tigris. He speaks Arabic well and has had frequent relations in the past with the Mesopotamian tribes. Therefore it is not surprising that, when lately it was desired to counteract the southward movement of the Anazeh towards our sphere of influence, Hauptmann Andrae was selected to visit the ex-chief of the Fedaan, Hachim Muheid, and per suade him to come down to Rakka and take steps to assert himself against Sheikh Mujhim, whom the tribe had elected to follow. Whether Andrae succeeded in delivering his letter is not known to us: his mission must have been seriously hampered, if not prevented, by our raid down the Euphrates to north of Heir, which occurred as he was on his way. Pieusser, the chief of the u Missmont ( = Mission Mon- tafik P) organization which was formed to rouse and support the Muntafiq chief, Ajeimi, and embarrass us on the Euphrates front, was foi some yeais Andrae s subordinate at Qalah Sherghat, and like his chief, is an able man of good address. His capture, with a part at any rate of the Missmont papers, by our cavalry during the Anah laid, has put Baghdad in a better position to speak of his activities than we are. He has found there at least one former acquaintance in Miss Gertrude Bell. Major Sarre, who has now gone back to Europe, after a long spell on the I urco-Persian frontier, directing Persian propaganda for Ins Army Group, is no doubt Dr. Friedrich Sarre. attached before the War to the service of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, at Berlin, and well known in Syria and Mesopotamia.He has travelled m Asia. Minor, and written a book Hewe Klemasien ; was one of the conductors of the German excavations at feamarra; and has long been a trusted buyer for the Museum as well as a successful collector on his own account. He is married to a daughter of the late Karl Humann, the excavator of Pergamos. and long resident in Smyrna, and himself had for some years a house on the Bosphorus. He speaks English well, as does Ids wife • but he is a less attractive personality than Andrae. He seems to have spent an uneasy and unfruitful time on the Persian frontier : but he is a clever man without too manv scruples, who could be dangerous. I rolessor Ferdinand von Luschan, an Austrian physician icsident in Berlin as Director of the Volkskunde Museum, and a personal friend of the Kaiser, is one of the Central Committee for diiecting German propaganda in Turkey. He excavated Sinjerli in north-west Syria (close to the eastern exit of the Baghdadbahn from Mount Amanus) more than twenty vears ago. and he has travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Northern Mesopotamia, on whose populations he is the leading anthropo logical authority. He speaks English well and before the war was often in England where he had many friends. He is a man of much distinction and charm of manner, whose heart is certainly more in science than in politics. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. The main item this week concerns a Turkish railway inspection patrol of twenty infantry and thirty camel corps, south of Kutrani station on June 2. The whole patrol is said to have been captured by the Huweitat. Enemy planes are imported still operating actively from Kutrani (though there are no hangars there), paying daily visits early in the morning and about four o’clock in the afternoon, to Sherif Nasir’s camp in Wadi H asa. Feisal again asks for help from the K.A.S. His former request (see p. 177, where Kalaat Aneizah should have been Amman) was responded to by two vigorous bombing raids upon Amman station on June 3 and 4. The second was effected by the largest number of machines (nineteen) which have yet flown in one formation east of the Jordan. Besides numerous direct hits observed during both raids on camps, dumps, station buildings and permanent way, a hangar was hit and collapsed. A subsequent air reconnaissance established the fact that great damage had been done all round. Three, if not four, enemy planes have been put out of action in this region lately j one made a false landing near Kutrani and was burnt by its pilot before his capture.— hh; — News from Kerak, up to May ^9, states that, besides the thirty gendarmes already there, 150 infantry arrived from Damascus, via Kutrani, on May 26. They brought a mountain gun and four machine guns. Probably they are a detachment of the 74th Regiment. Southern Area. Sherif Abdullah has reported that, on or about June 5, his detachment, under Fauzan el-Harith, attacked the railway near Toweira, and wiped out two enemy posts, killing thirteen and capturing twelve of the defenders. The} T cut 1,000 (?) rails, blew up four culverts and destroyed many telegraph poles, and also the engine and four trucks of a water train. The report adds that no recent demolitions in the southern area have yet been made good by the Turks. These include apparently a new break by a party of Sherif All’s force operating between Medina and Mukheifur (?) about June 3. The number of rails claimed to have been cut is obscure in the telegram ; perhaps it is 1,700. North of this region, between Mabrak en-Naqa and Dar el- Hamra, Sherit Sheraf has been exploding charges at three points, and has cut a large culvert. He broke up an enemy repair gang, killing one, and capturing six. This appears to have taken place about the end of May. It is now reported that, about May 18, an irregular force of Beni Mohammed Harb, left by Sherif Abdullah encamped about three miles from the railway north of Bowat, was attacked by the 1 urks and lost over eighty camels and about the same number of sheep, as well as two men killed and three captured. The Bedouins for their part killed five and captured four of the enemy. I he I urks brought a mountain gun and a machine gun into action. A 1 urk of Balikesr, who deserted from el-Ala. on April 25, states that for one and a hall months previous to that date no through train from south or north had reached el-Ala. Local trains only ran. The garrison was on half rations. The native population had been reduced to 600 to 700 souls. It is note- woith\ that, out of thirty deserters from various points of the linu, who have come lately into \\ r ejh, twenty-seven are classed as urks, two of the balance being Kurds. But some discount niust be allowed for a proportion of Aleppines and other north Syrians who are so classed because they speak Turkish more readily than Arabic, but nevertheless are Arabs. General. . . Husein went back to Mecca on June 5. At one of his interviews with (Alonel Wilson—on May 31—he raised once more very msistently the old question of his title. He based his emand to be ' King of the Arabs” not merelv on alleoed promises of ours, but mainly on the necessity, in our interest, as in his, before the Moslem world and history, that— 197 — |g. the destruction of a strong unifying force in Islam should be followed by construction of a new unity. If that is not to be where will he stand in the eyes of the Faithful, seeing the part he las played. and what use is tbere, he asks, in his maintaining his revolt. ^ It this demand proceeded purely from a motive of self- interest it would be easier to deal with : but there is no doubt the King is sincerely pleading the common cause of Islam when he adumbrates^ the restoration of something like the Ummeyad Empire to include Iraq : yet it is a wholly impracticable dream, based on much misapprehension of history. We can only hope that time will modify the King’s ambition and reduce it to the more practical scheme which is, we know, in his son, FeisaPs, mind. I he King knows, of course, that no actual progress can be made towards the realization of his ideal, till the Turks are conquered : but he seeks a sign of our intention bv asking for our formal recognition of the title he assumed a year and a half ago. What chance there is of its acceptance by, e.&lt;j. Ibn Sand, 'readers of pages 189, 190, above can judge ! It is reported that the Biludiyah subsection of the Masruh limb ha\e been looting stores at Rabngh, at the instance of Sheikh Husein Mubeirik. In consequence King Hnsein has ordered that transport of supplies to Rabugh from other parts of Hejaz shall cease for the present. Yemen. Letter from the Imam. Three letters have been received recently by the Resident at Aden from the Imam Yahya. All are more conciliatory in tone than usual, and the last reads like that of a would-be ally. Below his seal, and after compliments and reference to a previous communication, the Imam writes:— “ We do not think that the British Government will consider the other (Yemen chiefs) to be better than ourselves. “If there is any difficult} 7 on your part in admitting our claims as presented by us, we assure you that we shall continue to remain neutral and, God willing, exercise patience. # # # # * “ We trust that your Great Government will be just. As to what you mention regarding your allies, and their desire to partition out our country which our ancestors had ruled for centuries, we.are sure that the British Government, whose noble position amongst the Powers is well known, will not approve of such action and will not consent to ignore what they had formerly recognized to be the right of our aforesaid ancestors. Such recognition is referred to in the Treaty, of which a copy was sent to us recently by you.198 — “ Neither we nor our ancestors have at any time done any thing to compromise our interests. “All the hardships suffered during long years of war (with the Turks) are well known to have been endured for the sake of maintaining our independence. “ We have therefore a prior right to the consideration of our claims by the Great Government—now and at all times in the past.’' Dated Jumad-el-Akhir 17. 1336. [March 30, 1918]. I his letter, however, must not be taken at its face value. The Imam is far from putting himself in our hands yet, or proposing to help us against the Turks ; but he is trying to find out whether, as the price of a future agreement with himself, we would, under any circumstances, throw over Idrisi, and admit his own claim to control the Treaty tribes of the Aden Hinterland. He thinks these conditions not for ever impossible and he is opening his door a little way, while he watches our continued inaction at Aden and gleans what news he can of our fortunes in the war elsewhere. NOTES. Dhows off Hejaz am! Asir. The question of dhow traffic in the Red Sea was brought tc the ore again about two months ago by a complaint from Kine Husem that supplies were being smuggled from Massawa tc Birk, and thence to the Turks and Turkophil Arabs. This was probably an excuse for the King to hark back to his old wish bat he should control one of the Idrisi ports and have his own patrol dhows, a proposal which it was most inadvisable tc -&gt;anc ion Meanwhile a couple of Hejaz dhows with passes for Lith and Massawa were intercepted by the Red Sea Patrol near d -Roinari, a few miles south of Kunfida, one of them ^ f*r° Turkl8h d f serters and some -303 ammunition.

The steady drain of gold to the Hejaz for the subsidy beiran to create a serious outlook- for the future of the JigyptL gold reserve some months ago (see p. 7). In November 19 Va,, arrangement was made at Jiddah whereby the merchants into whose hands the gold eventually gravitated, could pay it into a ritisli bank at that place, in exchange for drafts oii India, the gold being then used again for the next month’s subsidy. A large part of the subsidy, however, now goes to Akaba, where no sue arrangement has been in force, owing partly to the absence f a i ny “ te n . k &gt; ? nd P artl . v to the very limited size of the market there. I his last factor again was caused bv lack of accommodation on the boats going to Akaba, the cargo* space on which was always so far filled with military stores and other requirements for Sherif Feisal’s army, that it was almost an impossibility to ship private merchandise. For some months however, local merchants had been most insistent in their requests for permission to send goods to Akaba. At the same time the drain of gold was growing serious, as nearly all the specie sent to Akaba was lost to Egypt: some found its way to Damascus and some to the gold bazaar to be made into ornaments, and much was probably hoarded : a certain amount did find its way to the Jiddah markets. Eventually an arrangement was made with the National Bank of Egypt whereby cheques could be issued by the Base Commandant at Akaba'in return for gold paid into him bv merchants. A proclamation was issued forbidding the import of gold into Egypt and authorising the compulsory exchange for notes of all gold found on persons returning from Akaba and the Hejaz, Finally the Naval authorities agreed to obtain a special steamer for the Akaba trip only, so that merchants could send goods there and attract the neighbouring tribes and Feisal’s Army with wares from Egypt and England. This scheme is only in its inception at present ; but it is hoped that it will not only succeed in drawing the gold to Akaba but have a good effect politically in increasing British prestige in Western Arabia.200 — Ibn Rashid. Besides the inference drawn in our last issue (p. 176) from the telegraphic report, which reported the capture of letters from Ibn Rashid, dated at Hail, we have had word from Baghdad that the Emir reached home about May 25. followed by Sheikh Aqab ibn Ajil, who went on to Linah and sent his son, Majid, forward to meet Captain Leaehman in Fahad ibn Hadhdbal’s camp near Shethathah. v A copy of Sherif Shakir’s letter, describing the pursuit of ibn Rashid, has now come to hand, and we learn that the Sheikh Khalaf, mentioned on page 176, is, as there guessed, of the Wuld Suleiman. His full name is Khalaf ibn Gay ini el-daaferi. He wrote that he was at a place called Subh, when he witnessed the defeat of Ibn Rashid. He added that Shammar tribesmen co operated in heading the Emir off into a waterless tract. A separate convoy of twenty-five camels, under the conduct of a slave of Ibn Rashid’s, carrying tents and saddles, was taken bv the “ Arabs of Ibn Hamrur ” and the slave was killed. It appears, from Major Davenport’s letter now received, that the news of the escape of Ibn Rashid from Hejr was very ill received by Sherif Abdullah, who flew into an ungovernable rage, because he thought that, if the fugitive got away, he was likely to surrender to us in Mesopotamia, be well treated, obtain our support, and “ have the laugh on ” the Sherifs. Khu nna incident. King Husein’s own account of this matter, as given to Colonel Wilson, is that the trouble arose from the chief sheikh of Tvhurma, a sherif, named Khalid ibn Derwish, turning Waha bite and denouncing the King. The population took sides, and a deputation of the loyal went to Mecca, where the King ordered them to separate (heir flocks, go to an appointed place, and wait. Before, however, help could come, the loyal villagers got the better 0 . e disloyal, expelled Sherif Khalid,and released two imprisoned emissaries ol the King. I he Meccan force now sent up will secure loyalist interests and police the place. Needless to say the vmg assumed throughout his own indefeasible right to Khurma. Administration of Sherijian Syria. In view of Feisal s inability to spare for administrative work any °t the yew really capable and trustworthv * officers he has, King H usem has told Colonel Wilson that he proposes the simple pan o &lt;,i mg a . lejlis \n w\\ occupied village or town, and leav- mg it to nominate a provisional governor, whether a local man or not, for the duration of the war.

J Idrisi Campaign. A letter has been received from Seyyid Mustapha el-Idrisi, dated at Laheiya, May 22. In this he gives the Idrisi account of the fight at Mur in April {see p. 134). His total of Idrisi losses confirms what were reported before, and increases the figures—thirty-six, including three sheikhs, having been killed, and seventy wounded. But on the enemy side he now states that eighty-four Turks were killed, including five officers. Inclu sive of Arab auxiliaries, the Turks lost, he says, 108 killed, and had a large number of wounded, including three officers. There seems no reason to question these figures. Seyyid Mustapha further reports a fight at Hajur, about the middle of May, in which Idrisi lost nine killed, while the Turks had twenty-five of their own number and ten of their Arabs killed, and two Turks were taken prisoners. He adds that daily skirmishes occur in which the enemy always loses three or four killed. The Vali, Mahmud Nadim, returned to Sanaa from the fighting zone, says Mustapha, greatly depressed, and the impres sion in Yemen is that the Turks are becoming very weak. Idrisi proposed to make a general attack about May 27 : but, if he carried out his intention, we have had no news of it. The rumour of an Idrisi defeat, which was current in Jiddah about a fortnight ago, referred to a date prior to that of the proposed offensive, and is now shown to have been baseless by Seyyid Mustapha’s letter.202 — Sinai. Durino- the latter part of May we had a patrol out in the Mukhsheib 0 district in chase of a gang of seven brigands, led by one Shabluk, whose centre is Moghara where some rifles are hidden. They operate against the flocks of local Bedouins as they move from pasture to pasture. The patrol was successful in cap turing four of the band, with seven rifles and some ammunition, as well as a deserter from the Egyptian Labour Corps. Libya. Submarine landings at Sirt and Misrata are still reported, and important Turks with German officers are said to have been disembarked in May. The desertion of G 1131 el-Sudani, with some hundreds of men, from Seyyid Mohammed Idris to Seyyid Ahmed, is confirmed. ' ‘ In other respects Seyyid Mohammed Idris seems to be keeping his end up. The raiding party which he sent out last February towards Fezzan under Shushan el-Garm, has returned to Jedabia with 300 camels and 600 sheep, besides a lot of Turkish gold coin. These were taken from the Hasana Arabs of Wadi Shiyati. n . News from Jaghbub says that food is short, and there is no communication with Siwa. ' The present population of mixed Hassa, Dorsa, Harabi (or Abeidat) Arabs and Sudanese, is about 500 souls. The Senussi school is open and has about 100 pupils, old and young. The Italians have had a respite from the larhuna since Suleiman Baruni went to Constantinople; but not from the attacks of Sheikh Sof ben Guma at Zanzur, Zawia, Gargarese, etc. Ramadan Shitewi is finding his Bedouins desert to Seyyffi Ahmed or Seyyid Mohammed Idris, the former of whom is increasing in influence, owing to Turkish support. Armenians and Arabs. The following is the translation of a telegram sent to King ' Husein by Boghos Nubar Pasha, President of the Armenian Delegation in Paris. “ To His Majesty the most illustrious King of the Hejaz :— I am filled with gratitude and overwhelmed by the favour Your Majesty has deigned to show in expressing to me your valuable sympathy with the Armenian people and declaring, in terms not less lofty than impressive, that Your Majesty associates the Armenian cause with the noble cause of the Arabs who, faith ful to the sacred law of their religion, are fighting under Your Majesty’s aegis, for the oppressed and for the triumph of justice and liberty. The Armenians will cherish for all time the memory of the help and the kindness of Your Majesty who, having pity on their sufferings, struggle for their deliverance. May God preserve the precious life of Your Majesty and crown it with all His blessings! ”SECRET Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, June 18, 1918. No. 93. SUMMARY. FEISAL’S ARMY IN MAY. ARABIA.

Joyce, D.S.O., lias sent in from Aba Lissan, under date May 31, a comprehensive report on the operations of the Sherifian Northern Army during May. We reproduce extracts from it here, not only because it adds details previously unreported in the Bulletin, but also in order that earlier discrepant information from different sources may receive final correction Col. Joyce prefaces his report by saying that it is most difficult to obtain a correct estimate of Turkish casualties, and that his figures are probably very much less than the losses actually inflicted. For the Hasa and Fareifra affairs there are no figures available. The report then continues, enumerating first the operations undertaken with the Arab regular troops. £ *-i The f ? rSt hal£ o£ the month was employed in demolishing the railway line between Maan and Mudawara, and organising a base at Fejeij _ (four miles south of Udruh) from which Sherif Zeid and Nuri Bey Said were to operate against the railway line north of Maan. This force consisted of about 1,200 regular troops, two 18-pounder field guns, four 2‘95 mountain guns and two companies machine guns. The French contingent also operated with this force. On May 9 the demolition parties operating south of Maan returned to Aba Lissan, having .successfully completed, in the Batn el-Ghul area, demolitions which consisted of 1,500 rails, cut on curves of minimum radius and maximum gradient, and the escarpment destroyed. For the last part of the above, compare pages 161 and 169. The original construction of the permanent way between Batn el-Ghul and Wadi Rethm stations was the most difficult engineering work on the whole Hejaz line. There is a fall of over 500 feet in about five miles, which has to be effected by a series of loops, along the face of an escarpment composed of rotten material. The average gradient is almost one in fifty on the main descent. “On May 11 Sherif Zeid, operating from Fejeij with the regular troops commanded by Nuri Bey, attacked Jerdun station. The attack was a complete surprise, and after a somewhat feeble resistance the garrison surrendered. Three machines, R./V.F., co-operated, and to the accuracy of their bombing of the Turkish positions the Arab troops attribute their success. The French contingent, with two mountain guns, under Capt. de Rivoyre, also rendered valuable assistance. 150 prisoners were captured, and also one mountain gun, three machine guns and a large quantity of ammunition, equipment and food. Thirty of the enemy were killed. Arab casualties—two officers and seven men wounded. The water supply at Jerdun being completely exhausted, the Arabs withdrew. Major Maynard accompanied the Arab army, and the following demolitions were carried out : two sets of points, 200 rails, seven wagons, large concreteunderoroimd water-tank, one culvert o£*fifteen foot span 400 yards south of station, and two bridges of seven and eight arches respectively partially destroyed about 4,000 yards south of Jerdun.” This account should be compared with page 169, as it supplements and corrects in several particulars the account given there. “On May 17 Arab regular troops again attacked Jerdun. Turkish communications having been restored with the north and it being apparent that reinforcements had arrived, it was feared that, unless the line was again broken, the Turks would be in a position to undertake offensive operations against Semna. The reinforcements brought the garrison of Jerdun up to about 400 rifles with several machine guns and two field guns. The attack, though carried out with much bravery, was unsuccessful. The leading Arab troops, commanded by Rashid Ali, a Baghdadi, got into the station and took a field-gun and eighteen prisoners. A large number of Turks also held up their hands, but on these being approached, heavy machine gun fire was opened on the Arab troops from a rear trench which had not surrendered, and quantities of bombs and hand grenades were thrown: practically all advanced troops were killed or wounded. Rashid Ali and six officers and twenty-three men were killed and 101 men were wounded. All of those who fell into Turkish hands were reported to have been instantly killed but later this report- was found to be untrue. At this juncture an armoured train with reinforcements arrived from the north and the Arab forces were compelled to withdraw. The Turkish losses were estimated at forty ; and eighteen prisoners were captured. Although the attack failed, there appears to be no doubt it completely upset Turkish arrangements, and the reinforcements originally destined for Maan are still hung up at Anazeh and Jerdun.” A less complete account of the above appeared on our page 170. “ On May 26 an attack by a force of regular troops supported by two armoured cars was made on a fortified post halfway between Maan and Jerdun, with a view to cutting the line and destroying two high single-arched bridges in the vicinity. The Turks evacuated the post before the attack developed, and satisfactory demolitions were accomplished. The two bridges were destroyed and about 300 rails broken. Enemy artillery was active from both Maan and Jerdun, and, later a strong m i an try counter-attack was delivered from Maan. This was coin pietely broken up by the armoured cars who estimate they in icted thirty casualties. After completing the demolitions the ra s withdrew. Arab casualties: one officer and five men wounded. This operation is first mentioned on pajee 177. What comes next has not been recorded in the Bulletin. ‘a of — 205 — ^ “On May 26 Major Maynard, escorted by two armoured ears, proceeded south of Maan and carried out the following- demohtion^ at Kd.dSO, Wadi abu Halufa, a 9-arched brid^ twelve feet high, total span thirty-eight yards; at Kil. 482 ^a 6-aiched bridge, total span twenty-six yards ; at Kil. 495’ KiTtxn tr i irtj hl 8’ , b s pan fifty yards. North ’ iiib 480, there are four bridges partially destroyed.” o onel Joyce then turns to the operations carried bedouin irregular forces. After necessitated by our evacuation indisposition of tribes within co-operation, he continues that it to cut the line north of Maan marched north from F Beni Sakhr out ny recording the change of plans of Salt and the subsequent reach of the Turks towards iemained absolutely necessary Accordingly u Sherif Nasir about May 18 with the Howeilat, t) . . a lew of the Rowalla and two companies of Ao’evl' Rassun Bey, with a detacliment of about 150 regular troopsMd AT m - OUatai 1 n ^ uns , and £our machine guns, proceeded with S her if Nasir, and Captain Peake and Captain Hornby, with a demolition party o£ Egyptian Camel Corps and a large quantitv of explosives, also accompanied this force. On May 2o, the line having been cut the previous nioht north and south of the station, the Arabs, supported by the artillery, charged in on el-Hasa and captured it. Sixty-five prisoners were taken and two machine guns ; the Arabs lost seven wounded. I he following demolitions were then carried out : three buildings ; one water tower and two tanks capable of holding 100,000 gallons each ; one steam pump and engine ; one windmill pump ; two engine-filling stand-pipes; one open truck; four sets of points ; one well blown up and filled in with rubble from the water tower ; three large bridges ; 1,200 rails cut and two more large bridges destroyed between Hasa and Fareifra ; one cutting blown in. “ On May 24 Fareifra station was captured; sixty prisoners and one machine gun were taken. The following demolitions were carried out: station buildings destroyed ; three trucks ; two sets of points ; one trolley ; one water-storage tank. “ On May 26 a train proceeding north from Jurf ed-Derwish was attacked and forced to return having detached a water truck which was destroyed, and further demolitions were carried out on the line between Jurf and el-Hasa, including one bridge. Arab troops were much harassed by enemy aeroplane action from Amman. One officer was killed ; ten men were wounded and a number of animals were also killed. “ Operations are still continuing but great difficulties are being experienced to keep up supplies of rations and explosives.” The above very materially supplements the accounts given on page 177 ; and adds one operation not recorded there, that of May 26. [Bridges have since been blown up between Kutrani and Sultani, and many more rails have been cut, the total length206 — destroyed being now nearly fourteen kilometres. Cut rails and sleepers have been levered off the embankments and the grading of the line destroyed. Nasir’s force, comprising Abu Tayi and Darausha Huweitat, duwabra, Manaiin, Naimat, Mahmudiin and Beni Sakhr elements, is slid in effective occupation of the broken sector.] ARABIA North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. Of late, the principal activity has been in the air. Amman has again suffered severely from a R.A.S. raid (the third this month), thirteen of our machines flew over the town and station on June 11, dropping over 2,000 lbs of explosives. Excellent practice was made, no less than twelve direct hits being made on camps and animals in the neighbourhood of the station and village, which were also hit. The hangars, which were damaged in the last raids, were again hit. hive days later twenty-six machines participated in an early morning raid on Kutrani which was most successful, u &gt;0^0 lbs. of exposives were dropped, and the station building's, as well as a troop train, were set on fire. The camps round the station were not spared, receiving 6,450 rounds from machine guns in addition to several bombs. A Projected attack on Jurf did not take place, owina; to e&lt; ouin ae' o co-operation. Under cover of a lone ranee bombardment, however, further demolitions were carried out on the l.ne, and on the 14th some Rowalla rushed Turkish posts vveen , ur am Anezah, capturing fifty-one prisoners and a 5T T l i y h '? d only three casualties ; the Turks are r6poi ted to have suffered severely. rei r, f statements of an intelligent Armenian confirm the repeat ot the damage wrought in the previous attacks {see p. 195) flomn-if Vy Ti n0t ku0Wn before -tell of the destruction of a • , lhe saw one of our machines drop a bomb m nne H I™' 3 for Madeba - Two Germans, who was looted by Z’ W ° Unde,J ’ “ ie load ° f Nawwaf ihii 's'o' 1S trallsblbo ' °f a manifesto signed by SheHfia , -r, f T , ° ne of tbe leade ‘'« of the pro- ohennan paity of the Beni Sakhr : ^ Mfmbnr ° ma,1y See ^ ie ^ aiz—Mithqal, Abtan, an orde, T 16 o£ the •' Be informed that ones who tf 8 &gt;eel .

A telegram, dated June 10, has been received reporting the capture of a Turkish officer, and the destruction of 100 rails between Bedai and Bowat. An agent, who was sent lately into Medina and stayed in the place fourteen days, says that Ateiba, Harb and Huteim tribesmen have been importing food for the garrison. Hearing this, Sherif Abdullah ordered the Harb sheikhs to move their camps farther from the town. The agent found plenty of works constructed, chiefly of the sangar type, but weakly, manned. Turkish soldiers, taken near Bowat by the Arabs, were emaciated and wearing women’s garments. Forty Turkish M.I. on mules and forty Camel Corps are reported to have saddled up recently, ridden to Ain Turaa and surrendered to Sherif Shakir. Major Davenport reports well of the Bedouins, who attacked the line on May 23 near Bowat, and with French and Egyptian help, wrecked six kilometres of track and telegraph, and three culverts. He also reports well of the Bedouins of Ali’s force and indeed on all its constituents except the officers, who, unfortunately, distract the well-intentioned Emir. General. A Medinote, who was sent up to Damascus by Fakhri Pasha and has since come down to Sherif Ali, via Jauf and Kasim, states that, in March last, he saw in Damascus one of the big Koweit caravans of a thousand camels. It had brought sugar, coffee and cloths. The first two commodities were sold at half a Turkish lira an oke. These caravans are private ventures for the most part, and cloth goods are their chief commodity. Very little government stuff is brought by them. What there is, is petroleum. When our informant was at Anezah in Kasim, about a month ago, he heard that Ibn Sand was refusing passes for all destinations except Kasim, and that a big caravan had been stopped by the British.Idrisi Defeat. On Friday, June 7, a concentration of Turkish forces attacked fdrisi’s army near Rassas (see sketch-map in our No. 90). Fighting continued all day, and on the morrow the enemy was able to cross the wadi and capture Beit Husein. He is reported to have lost heavily in doing so, but Idrisi’s army suffered more severely, losing not only about forty killed, but two guns. Pressing on, the Turks reoccupied el-Atan two days later. This point commands the source of the main water supply of Laheiya, and, evacuation of the latter town by the Idrisi army, on the 11th, became inevitable. A Council of War was to be held at once at Midi between our representatives, and Seyyid Mustapha and Idrisi himself. Pending further and more detailed information, we have only to say that it appears, from Major Tippetts’ report, under date May 28, from Laheiya, that this reverse seems to have followed an attack made by the Idrisi troops, on May 31 or June 1, on Beit Ahmed Pasha, a village on the southern edge of the Wadi Mur valley. There is a good deal in the reports of both Major Tippetts and Nasir ed-Din Ahmed, Political liaison officer with Idrisi, to show that a reverse was not unlikely to happen. Not only was shortage of ammunition and supplies imminent more than a week before—largely due to prodigal wastage by Idrisi’s uncontrolled levies—but the disposition of Idrisi’s troops in small bodies, their licence to go off campaigning where individual chiefs might think fit, and the inflated incapacity of their generals, were bad signs. Seyyid Mustapha himself is reported megalo-maniac and convinced (Luxor effendi that he is !) of his strategic competence. He appears to have taken very ill the advice and assistance which Colonel Bainbridge offered him. The recent advance on Jebel Milh was wholly unauthorized by the higher command and resulted in waste of ammunition, very ill compensated b} 7 some seventeen 1 urkish casualties. Major Tippetts states that the Laheiya townsfolk were expressing a very low estimate of the fighting value of Idrisi’s levies in their neighbourhood. Yemen. We have referred more than once (see e.g. pp. 156, 201) to recent activity of the Yali of Sanaa in touring his province and more particularly the Tihama part of it. His object has been two fold (1) to raise money ; (2) to get recruits for the “ milli ”, or Arab irregular, levies. We have already exposed the serious financial situation of the Yemen on page lo6, and it appears that the pay of all the troops is greatly in arrear. The Yall’s representations to the towns and villages of the central Tihama, from Bajil and Hodeida to Zebid, are said to have produced very little money. As for Milli recruits, Ali Said Pasha is meeting with increasing difficulties in getting themcommander of the Sherifian force, met his death through the trickery of some of the Beni Zeid. In the first action that took place between the two forces eight of the Beni Zeid tribe were killed. They then made overtures to Sherif Sultan el-Abadila and asked him to a reception in his honour, having told the Turks that they would seize him. To this Sherif Sultan proceeded, with only a few personal followers. When he saw that he had been invited by treachery, he attempted to escape, but was surrounded and killed. Some rumours say that he met his death by his horse being shot and he being thrown to the ground where he was picked up by the Arabs, who afterwards killed him by inserting poison up his nose ; others report that he was hit in the stomach and died two days afterwards at Joz Belair. Mohammed Areifan regrets this Sherif’s death, as he was a strong man and well able to deal wdth the situation. He has not much opinion of his successor Sherif Basha, and holds that, the only Sherif capable of filling this vacancy is Sherif Mohsin, Kaimakam of Jiddah, who is w r ell known down there and has a certain following ; but the King says that he cannot spare him from Jiddah. To make any headway in that direction the King should have a force of at least 2,000 rifles ; then informant thought the Beni Zeid and Belair would all come over to him. To-day, seeing such a small force opposed to the Turks, these tribes do not think the King has any strength behind him, and con sequently they attach themselves to whoever gives them most food and money. They are divided between the Turks and the Idrisi and a certain portion of them hold a watching brief between the two. Mesopotamian Chiefs and King Husein. it is a growing practice of Shamiyah chiefs, who are either dissatisfied with financial arrangements made for them by our authorities, or afraid to tender submission direct to us, to offer to join King Husein, as a step to the attainment of their desires. Obviously it is not a practice to be encouraged. Since Mohammed ibn Mijlad of the Ainarat Dahamisha tried it on, in order to get round our arrangement with Fahad ibn Hadhdhal, both Saud es- Subhan, of the Shammar, and Hamud es-Saadun, of the Muntafiq, have taken the same course. The first, who has proved quite useless to us on the whole, is dissatisfied with his subsidy as now reduced (see p. 201) : the second, a man of bad repute, wdio has never come into us, though he once got as far as Suq es-Shiyuk, evidently w 7 ants to break wdth his brother Ajeimi (who also has written to King Husein saying he would like to make his peace but fears the hostility of our administration). The immediate cause is stoppage of the Turkish subsidy. He has sent a delegate, one Grhazi es-Saadun, across, who has reached Shenf Abdullah’s camp and gone on to Yam bo and Mecca. Thelatter seems to have talked about 200,000 Mimtafiq follovvino' his master ! If Hamucl brings, in the event, fifty Saadun retainers, it will be all we should expect. The Mnntafiq never follow any one chief and least of all Hamud es-Saadun. King Husein is, naturally, anxious to see these chiefs come across to him, as outward and visible witnesses to his own prestige in the East; but both cases must be decided, in the first and last instance, by Mesopotamia. The question of Baud Subhan’s subsidy can be settled only there.. As for Hamud, be is an outlaw at large, and there is nothing to prevent him making oft' westward, if he chooses ; but he will have to go back again to the Euphrates before his peace can be made.SECRET.

Sherif Abdullah has sent in to King Husein a first instalment of the letters captured from Ibn Rashid’s party at Jauf {see p. 176, etc.), and with them a covering despatch, describing Abdullah ibn Dakhil’s action. Says Abdullah :— “God prospered the undertaking, and be (Abdullah ibn Dakhil) killed all the men of the detachment, and captured the letters which are enclosed. These letters are worthy of publication in the ‘ Kibla,’ because they contain a weighty complaint from the last of the Arab Emirs to remain in the shadow of the Turks, and proclaim what he suffered in the way of insults despite his patience and steadfastness towards them. It will be an argument against such as blame tho.se who rise against the Turanians. Two of the captured letters are formal notifications to the G.O.C. 4th Army, at Damascus, and to Enver Pasha at Constantinople, of Ibn Rashid’s departure from Medain Salih and arrival at Hail on the 6rd Shaban. But each contains the same sort of complaint. To the G.O.C. the Emir writes : _ “We have already sent you numerous telegrams asking permission to return to our home and setting forth the nature of our treatment at the hands of your officers especially Fakhii Pasha ; but no change of treatment has resulted. We also complained that the necessary supplies did not arrive ; but we got no answer at all, because he—the above-mentioned -suppressed the outward and inward telegrams until we were in despair. Meanwhile, distracting news of disorders at home was leaching us, so that we were compelled to depart; and to-day we have arrived, asking God to prosper the result for the glory of om religion and country.” To Enver the Emir speaks more forcibly “ Since, moreover, we had observed our religion and taken refuse with the Government, we tarried long in Medain, namely ten months, enduring the bad treatment of your officers, especial!} Fakhri Pasha. We have repeatedly written to you about this, but fate did not vouchsafe us an answer, because he withheld it while (other) telegrams were going to and fro without hindrance. At last the doubt entered our mind, is this a studied insult from preiudiced people, or from the Government ?—which God forbid 1 He, who takes refuge with a righteous Government voluntarily and of good will, does not deserve such treatment. Nor is it right that evil and prejudiced insinuations should be made against us far and near, the result of which 1 have seen in so many ways that enumeration would be tedious. Certain other letters more intimate and informing were also captured. One from the Emir to his agent, Rashid ibn Leilah, throws fresh light on the former’s relations with the lurks. Owing to its uncouth colloquial diction, we have not been able to ' interpret quite all of it; but its general purport is clear enough.“ The cause o£ our departure from el-Medain is well known to you We have been patiently enduring insult for a whole year. Our very food was refused us, and we were humiliated and oppressed in Medain under Fakhri. Every day we were upbraided by him and by his Mamurs 11 ... . Abdel Hamid has had us guarded by night. We asked Fakhri for riding animals and waterskins, and though there were plenty in Medain, he refused them. We asked permission for our force to depart when we went to our Dira, and every night we were slaughtering one of the riding animals. While we remained at Medain we were between Fakhri and the others. 1 myself suffered from hunger and privation. We were constrained to eat even bitter vetch, which we secretly bouadit from the private soldiers, to whom it was given as forage for their mules ” The Emir goes on to give Rashid instructions about rejoining him at Hail. There is only one way—by Jauf—whether the railway be really cut or not, and passage that way will depend on Nuri Shaalan, about whose actual politics the Emir expresses himself doubtful. Rashid is meanwhile to keep on as good terms as possible with the Ottoman Government with which the Emir is not yet prepared to break : (apparently) he still hopes to get a machine gun which Fakhri had sent to Medain (this passage is obscure) and also to recover an Aleppine clerk, who had been withdrawn by Abdel Hamid Bey on suspicion of communicating information about Ottoman affairs. The Emir further informs his agent that the British have given Ibn Saud four q.f. guns and five machine guns; and another reference to the same facts makes it clear that Rashid is to use this information as a lever to get an armament for Hail out of the Turks, before he leaves. Finally the Emir says about his financial position :— “ Thus we were in great distress about expenses. There is no money here. We wrote from Hail .... as you know, and this is a matter like fire and wood, and the money we received in Medain at first we spent on dried dates and bitter vetch.” We shall await a further consignment of these captured documents before commenting on them. But it may be said that, according to information we have received, Nuri Shaalan will let Rashid ibn Leilah himself pass through to Hail, but proposes to hold up any armament or supplies he may try to carry with him. What may happen to Sheikh Abd el-Aziz Shawish and Hairi Bey, if they accompany him (they are reported to have started, or to be about to start, from Damascus), we do not know.EMIR HUSEIN AND JEMAL IN 1916. King Husein has forwarded to us copies of certain letters which passed between himself and Ahmed Jemal Pasha in April, 1916. They contain some interesting references to enemy offensive plans at that time, namely the despatch of Hairi Bey’s picked force of 3,500 men, with the Stotzingen Mission for Yemen (see Arab Bulletin, 1916, p. 272) ; and the expedition towards the Canal, which resulted in the Katia affair of April 23. In regard to the former of these undertakings, Jemal wrote to the Emir, on April 2, that the first train conveying the detach ment for Yemen was timed to reach Medina in ten days’ time. He laid stress on the fact that the transport of these troops from Aleppo was holding up rolling-stock, belonging to the Palestine and Haifa railways, which was wanted for the Egyptian Expedition; all possible despatch must therefore be used, and a camel regiment, wanted back from Hejaz, should be put on the returning trucks, so that none need be sent later specially to move it. He then enters into the question of the mujahid regiment which the Emir has raised, promising to send at once 500 rifles for it and L.T. 5,000 ; and in a second letter, dated April 9, he presses for its concentration at Medina, because the Egyptian Expedition is on the point of departure. In his reply the Emir stated that the said regiment had no equipment, nothing having been sent in response to his frequent requests. As for the L.T. 5,000 now to be sent by Jemal, if the sum was in paper, it would be worth only about a quarter of its face value, and how was it to be distributed among 1,500 mujahidin ? Finally, he tells Jemal, with evident disgust : “ It is not worth your while to worry about their pay and equipment ; 1 will pay the expenses myself for the second time.” Jemal states further, in his first letter, that “ under the Sacred Banner of the Caliphate German and Austrian troops are coming to participate in the Jihad.” The Emir, in his reply, confines his comment to these words: “ The arrival of Austrian and German forces will inaugurate a new chapter in the history of Islam !” Finally in his first letter, Jemal informed the Emir that the latter’s son, AH Bey Effendi, had had “ an insignificant and purely personal disagreement with the O.C. Medina garrison ” (compare Arab Bulletin, 1917, p. 509), of a kind which he (Jemal) had taken steps to obviate in the future. As for Feisal Bey Effendi, says Jemal in his second letter, he could not be spared from Army H.Q. for a single instant. Something in these strained relations with the Emir’s sons must have led Jemal, in a letter not before us, to suggest to the Emir a discussion on the succession. Possibly Jemal had hinted that the Porte would not be likely to approve Ali or Feisal after recent experiences. The Emir’s reply ends with a curt rebuff-— u You and I ”, he says to Jemal, “ cannot discuss the affairs of the Emirate and the succession of the Sherifate.”— 216 ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. . A mishap to a British officer, Lieut. Ashley Powell, detailed to collect intelligence in Feisal’s camp, happened as our last issue was in the press. Lieut. Powell had accompanied Major Maynard and his armoured cars to the neighbourhood of Jurf ed-Derwish, and momentarily lost touch with the party. While he was alone, he was accosted by five stray Bedouins, who finding him resist them, stabbed and beat him, stripped off his clothes, and took a considerable sum in gold. His wounds were less serious than they easily might have been, and are now reported healed. If his assailants were men of Feisal’s irregular force, and especially if they were from the Rowalla, known to have been taking part in a raid on Jurf at that time, an awkward situation might arise ; but, so far as we know, they were unattached land-lopers, such as abound in the region. Southern Area. Nothing has been reported to us, except, by a telegram dated June 17, a raid by Ali’s forces on the railway between Bowat and Hafira. The demolition is stated to have amounted to four hundred rails. Ali himself appears to have returned to Bir Derwish from east of Medina, while Abdullah has moved his headquarters to a point west of Hadiyah. A certain Juheinah sheikh, Mohammed ibn Mahid, has been captured by Bedouins of Sherif Abdullah’s force. We have known nothing of him before, but are now informed, under date June 22, that he has been working with and for Fakhri Pasha ; and, evidently, Sherif Abdullah attaches importance to his capture. Bimbashi Bright sends from Wejh, under date June 8, the following statement of the Arab forces, based on Wejh, at the date of despatch :— u Regulars. —Harb: 60 men under Sheikh Abeyd. Hudheil: 400 men under Sherif Mohammed ibn Ghalib. Ageyl: 100 men under Sheikh Ibn Jerboa. Syrians : 80 under Aziz Effendi. Various: 150 men (Meccans, Syrians, and Baghdadis) under Ismail Lff. el-Gazzaz and two junior officers. These live in the Fort at Wejh, and small parties of them, trained in demolition, are attached to the Bedus for raiding expeditions. There are also two Sherifs who go out as Sherif Sharaf’s representatives with the various demolition parties—Sherif Hassan and Sherif Sultan. ^ The recent £5,000 received by Sherif Sharaf from Sherif Feisal has all been paid in wages to these regular troops ; the Bedus have had none. Their armament is two Turkish mountain guns, 75 m/m. ; two maxim guns, Mark II. ; two mitrailleuses Hotchkiss auto- matiques ; for all of which there are squads trained in the handling.Bedus. —The sheikhs who take the most active part in Sherif Sharaf’s operations are :— 1. Hammad Mangara of the Barakat. He operates chiefly to the south of el-Ula, based on Jeydah. The Barakat is the biggest sub-tribe (‘fukhud’) of the Billi, and after the Rifada family, Hammad Mangara is the most influential sheikh. He was on bad terms with Suleirfran ibn Rifada, and favoured the Sherif. 2. Abdullah ibn Muhenna of the Saheima. He operates usually from el-Ula to Dar el-Hamra. Highly thought-of bv Sherif Sharaf as a capable leader. The Zibala sub-tribe and the Saheima go together. 3. Hamad abu Shamaa of the Abu Shamaa (Moahib). Operates around Dar el-Hamra. Aziz Effendi says that these northern sub-tribes are keener on raiding and better to deal with than those operating to the south of el-Ula, and also their Dira is better watered. Summer watering place, ISFeshafah. Hamad abu Shamaa has a paternal cousin, Ibrahim abn Shamaa, who acts as his Wakil in drawing supplies, etc. Only the Billi and Moahib receive pay from Wejh and the number reckoned as supposed to draw such pay is 6,000 men. Sherif Sharaf says that £20,000 would be sufficient for one month’s pay ; and that if he could only have one month’s, it would be sufficient to enable him to go out personally and undertake bigger operations. The following draw supplies from Wejh :— Small sacks rice or flour per month. Anazeh: Ferhan el-Aida 1,500 Riyal Heis 1,200 Awaji 600 Fejir (Fuqara) (Sheikh Sultan) 1,000 Billi ... 2,000 Moahib 600 Beni Atiyah 1,500 To make up for the lack of pay, Sharaf has been issuing the Arabs with a two month’s supply at one issue (but to last two months). As for ammufiition, Mauser ‘SOI Turkish is at present most in demand. This is because the Arabs prefer the Mauser rifle to the British pattern and take into use any rifles captured from Turkish Prisoners of War or deserters, ft is said that a rifle sold in Jebel Shammar will fetch £30. The Sherifian sarraf at Wejh says he has a book in which are recorded all rifles issued from here to the Arabs since the commencement of the issues ; and it is possible that he has all those issued from Yambo written down.”General. King Husein reports that calm has been restored at Khurma and that the people are settling down. It is clear that a considerable number of Akhwan missionaries have been at work in the Khurma and Tarabah districts ; but there is no reason for believing that they are supported by aught but their own fanaticism. Sherif AH has telegraphed to his father that a convoy of 1,800 camels is leaving Hail for Medina under strong escort. He says his information is certain, and he has shown his belie! in it, not only by sending a strong force to intercept the blockade- runners, but also by asking his brother, Abdullah, to co-operate. It is, however, difficult to believe, unless the camels are being- sent unloaded to replenish Fakhri’s transport, which we know to be in great need of animals. If Ibn Rashid is obliging Fakhri in this way, in spite of bitter personal grievances, it must be by superior order from Damascus, and in the hope of receiving his reward from Constantinople in the shape of much-desired guns (see p. 214). All Ibn Rashid’s heart is evidently set on o-ettino- an armament which, he thinks, will enable him to be independent in Hail and snap his fingers at Ibn Sand. We shall no doubt hear more of that convoy, if really it has started. NOTES. Ibn Rashid. Ibn Rashid, was well received at Hail, according to Sherif Sharaf’s information. The absence of Rashid ibn Leilah was a relief to the townspeople, who are anti-Turk now, and will support the Emir only so long as he keeps away from the Ottoman Government. Letters, which he wrote to the latter on arrival, went up to Jauf el-Amr, where Sheikh Abdullah ibn Dakhil, of the Ageyl, happening to be buying horses for Sherif Abdullah from the Anezah, intercepted them and forwarded them to his master. The Emir is said to have sent a message to the Sheikh of Koweit asking to be supplied from there. Ajeimi es-Saadmi. An Anazeh sheikh, Kazim el-Jidi, who left Kerbela four months ago for Mecca, was caught two days north of Linah by Ajeimi’s men and kept twenty-five days a prisoner. Liberated by a Shammar raiding party, he got through to Boreida and Rass and so to Emir Ali. He has written a letter to Sir Percy Cox, in which he says that Ajeimi has only about forty followers, chosen as rajiqs from different tribes and sections to ensure his personal safety. With these he lives by raiding caravans. The— 219 — tribes are very tired of him and of the insecurity he occasions, and would gladly help to round him up. It is probable that his Turkish allowance, like that of his brother Hamud (see p. 211), has either been stopped or is being irregularly paid. Abortive Turkish Mission. We heard about two months ago that a special mission to the King of Hejaz was contemplated by the Turks, its leader to be either the late, or the present, Sheikh el-Islam. It was to go down to Medina, and thence try to get into touch with Mecca and the King, and make certain propositions to the latter in the name of Islam. We never attached any importance to it, knowing that, with the railway in the state into which it had then lapsed, the Mission had practically no chance of getting through. It has now been reported that no one of its members ever went beyond Deraa. The Sheikh el-Islam returned home some time ago, and two minor members, Essad Effendi and Sabri Hoja, after reaching Deraa, were recalled. The Grand Mufti of Damascus, who probably knew better than his colleagues the state of the railway, fell ill opportunely and never started south at all. Turkish Finance. In regard to the financial expedients devised by Javid Bey and mentioned in our article on his Budget speech (p. 151), the following has been written by the same hand which was responsible for that article :— “ The utmost efforts are being made to popularize the new Turkish internal loan. Subscribers are to be given their first six months’ interest at b% at the same time as they pay their subscription. All interest will be paid in gold which Germany is said to have undertaken to supply. Bonds will be redeemed twice yearly, on October 20 and April 20 of each year. The bonds to be redeemed will be drawn by lot and payment for them will be made in gold. All transactions connected with the Loan will be free of tax, stamp duty or other government charges. I he Loan is guaranteed by the excess levenue of the Ottoman Public Debt and the receipts of the Aghnam or sheep tax. (Note.—The Aghnam has hitherto been one of the few taxes not mortgaged in some way or other.) Fhe Service of the Loan will be in the hands of the Imperial Ottoman Bank. “In spite of these inducements, the Ottoman Government does not seem over confident of obtaining the necessary sum from the interior alone. An attempt will be made to put the Loan on the Swiss market. Ottomans abroad are invited to subscribe and even enemy subjects will be able to participate owino- to the suppression of the formalities required by the Law'of January 24, 1331 (1915). “The 4 Hilal ’ (April 12) says that the Mint is coming £T30,000-40,000 in gold daily for the payment of interest on the Loan.— 220 — “It is reported that by these resources Javid Bey hopes to reduce the premium on gold in the country, or, in other words, to raise the value of Turkish Notes.” Turkish Bank Nates in IJejaz. King Husein informed Colonel Wilson recently that Turkish notes to the value of L.T. 4,000 have been imported from Akaba and impounded by the Jiddah Customs. They are to be returned, by the King’s order, to the Akaba merchants who consigned them. This statement should be compared with the report from Palestine, on page 108, concerning the purchase of Turkish notes by Akaba agents, which was detected in March last by our officers at Bethlehem, Hebron and Gaza. Turkish Women. An Arab, who left Constantinople early in April and has come through to Cairo, via Damascus, Jebel Druz, and leisal s Camp, has much to say about the Turkish women : and since his talk, whether well founded or not, helps to breed certain ideas on this delicate subject, which go abroad among Arabs, it is worth recording here. He says that discarding of the veil is becoming general, especially among the many girls now employed in telegraph and telephone service. The women of the capital exert enormous political influence and, on the whole, support Jemal’s party. Worse features are the great increase of brothels, and the infection of a large part of the population—the informant says ninety per cent—with venereal disease. Women in the streets solicit quite shamelessly, catching hold of officers, chiefly Germans ; the latter, thinking the same licence held in Damascus, raised a riot there by free handling of women. The result was the dismissal of the German Chief of Police. The Austrians behave more decently, and are much less detested. I T nrest in Anatolia. The same informant reports that public insecurity is rife in Anatolia, even along the railways. Paid Effendi, M.P. for Jerusalem, was robbed on the way to Bozanti of AT 1,500 in gold, and a merchant was robbed and murdered in our informant’s train. Brigands infest the Brusa and Aidin provinces, and the Government, unable to find men to send against them, tries to buy them off. Soldiers sent to the front are handcuffed and kept in locked railway carriages. There is no longer the slightest military enthusiasm in Anatolia ; the people are sick of the whole thing, are outraged by the irreligious practices of the leaders, and have been giving ear to the Syrian exiles in their midst. Jiddah Sanitation. King Husein, in the course of his efforts to cleanse the Augean stables of Jiddah, has turned his attention to the poisonous receptacles existing at present in the mosques forablution purposes. They are usually sunken pits with no device for running off waste, and water remains in them from month to month. Ablution water is to be kept in future in free-standing cisterns with taps for drainage. The King is also building new public latrines and seeing to the levelling of old roads and construction of new ones. The new customs-sheds are a very creditable improvemei 1 1. The Idrisi Defeat. We have learned no further details of the set-back in Idrisi’s operations, which has resulted in the evacuation of Laheiya and the loss of all the guns there and with the Southern force. A British ship off the port however, managed to render one or two of these guns useless to the Turks. Another of our ships has embarked Seyyid Mustaphaand Nasreddin, together with Colonel Houston, for Midi, where measures for the recovery of Laheiya and Atan are to be concerted. We are assured that bad general ship and bad management on the part of Idrisi’s commanders are alone to blame for the misfortune, not any shortage of money or anything else supplied by us. Naval Marks on Asir Coast. Sheikh Mohammed Areifan, who has recently been down to the neighbourhood of Joz Belair, reports that our Kaval Sui vev marks are being removed not only by Arabs, paid by Tuiks for the purpose, but also by Turkish soldiers themselves. There is a kind of emulation among the latter about bringing in these trophies, and a successful raider is much applauded. Billi and Moahib. Bimbashi Bright sends the following note on these tribes, in touch with whom he has now lived for many months : — “ The particular sub-tribe of the Rifada family is the Maagla. This is small in number and was very pro-Turk in the time of Suleiman Pasha. Ibrahim and Salim are the two sheikhs. il ' Salim is, I understand, the eldest son of Suleiman ibn Rifada, but as he is ‘of a troubled understanding’, Ibrahim is virtually the head of the family, and Salim spends all his time with the Bedus in the desert. “ It is said that the Wabsa and Aradat are also particular sub-tribes of the Rifada family. The Aradat certainly are ; but it is not certain whether Ibrahim or Hamid* is the principal sheikh. The Wabsa have a chief sheikh named Auda and possibly another one named Ruga. There is a sub-tribe of Moahib called Munasir—Sheikhs Hamad and Maied. “ There appear to be five sub-tribes of Moahib m all, viz. 1. Abu Shamaa. 2. Derain. 3. Guian. 4. Fuadala. 5. Munasir. Of these Nos. 1 and 4 are the most important. When one talks of the Billi, it is understood to include all the Moahib : they are reckoned as a s ection of Billi. * The honours are divided.V'2'2 Arab Bureau, Jerusalem. Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza has come in to Jerusalem from (jrhor es-Satieh, and been entertained in the new cate-club which has been opened in connection with the Arab Bureau. He was delighted, we hear, with the amenities which this institution offers to Arab visitors. The club is in an ex-German coffee-shop on the main road, near the Jaffa Gate and communicates at the hack with the garden of the house used for the residence ot the officers of the Bureau and the lodging of Arabs ot quality. This house, formerly in German hands, is set back against the city wall, with a terrace and garden dividing it from the low lock-up shops which form the road frontage, three ot these shops, including the cafe, belong to it, and two are rented out to Jew tradesmen. Coffee, tea, etc. (no alchohol, ot course) are supplied in the cafe to those who have cards of membership, o-iven gratis to approved Arabs. Arabic literature, news-telegrams, etc., are provided, and informal talks and addresses are to be given, when members are assembled in the evening. Libya. ' Seyyid Ahmed, “Ottoman Viceroy of North Africa,” is now reported established, with Mohammed Zwiy, at Qasr Sirt; but, apparently, he is still at odds with Ramadan Shitewi. Ishaak Pasha, who is said to have definitely replaced Nuri as Ottoman commander, has been trying to reconcile the feud, but, so far, without success. It is stated that Prince Osman Fuad, second son of Prince Salaheddin, a young man of twenty- three, who has served in the Prussian Guard Regiment, is now in Tripolitania, having landed at Misurata from a submarine. The enemy is said to have reoccupied all Fezzan, having driven out the forces of Mohammed el-Abid towards Kufra, where their leader lies ill.SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN No. 95.N SECRET, No. 95.

In regard to the first attempt on the Mellal bridges Major Davenport writes: — “On May 11 S her if Abdullah moved his whole force up to the attack at noon. “ I he Bedouins all moved off and got to their positions quickly ; but the Baghdadi officers at once began delaying the guns and were nearly an hour late in getting into position. The two E. A. mountain guns were sent one to each flank, one on Jebel el-Gharaba and the other at tne Kashm el-Gazeil. The two lurkish field-guns were placed at Jebel el-Ivhejdla opposite the bridge defences. 1 moved the French and British demolition parties up to Jebel el-Kheyila. When I got there 1 found the Baghdadi officers in a great state of fear, although as yet the Turks had not fired a shot : they had placed the gun behind a high hill which they could not possibly clear. Sherif Abdullah ibn Thawaband a lot of Bedouins came up to me and remonstrated about the way the Baghdadis were behaving in not bringing the guns into action, when they were waiting to advance. The Sherif told me the officers had said the Turks must not see them and they must not see the Turks, and had refused to move the guns. He asked me to order them out. I said I was afraid I could not give an order to the Sherif’s troops, but I would go and see what I could do. I found the officers all in a state of panic and they gave many excuses for not coming away from the mountain. I then told them what I thought of them, left them, rode back to- the Sherif and told him I could do nothing with them, and that it was up to him to force them into action. I said I would support him with Sherif Abdullah, if the officers caused trouble. “Ibn Thawab then went clown with a lot of Bedu and forced the guns to come into a fire position. The Bedu had drawn their knives and were making suggestive gestures across their throats, implying that that was how they intended to treat the Baghdadis if they did not come into action. Eventually they began firing, and the Bedu under Sherif Abdullah ibn Thawab were already running across the open to the Turkish positions. The fire of the field-guns was disgusting, but the two mountain guns did excellent practice on the Turkish works. “ Just at dusk the guns were all withdrawn and the Bedu were closely engaged with all the Turkish posts. I sent the four E.A. machine guns up under Captain Clayton, M.C., in the evening, to assist the Bedu, but they did not succeed in getting into action. About an hour after dark the Bedu had taken three strong Turkish posts.— 224 — (1) The J uheinah under Sheikh Dakhil Allah el-Kadi, one on the left. , n . .. rn , , (2) The Ateibah under Sherif Abdullah ibn 1 hawab, one in the centre. . (3) The Huteim under Sheikh Said, a post looking on to the Wadi Hamdh. u As soon as these three posts had been taken the y-arched bridge detailed to the French was clear, and in another two hours they had blown it up. After dark I called in the Egyptian machine guns and moved the demolition party up towards the big bridges; but as the Turkish defence was still strong and the Turk machine guns were playing on the approaches, 1 retired my men to the camels and waited to see what would happen. In the meantime the Shararat Arabs had got into the outer works of Bowat and driven the Turks into the station buildings, but they were unable to do more than this and retired bringing in three prisoners from the station. “ The Beni Mohammed and Ateibah under Sheikh Sultan el-Abad had been working round Gazeil Post all night, but were not able to progress far, as they were held up by the Turk bombing parties ; but, nevertheless, they worried the post till well after dawn the next day. About two hours before midnight I got a message from Sherif Abdullah saying he did not want me to advance further until the bridge defences were taken. I replied I would hang on hoping they would be taken before dawn. “ About midnight I got another message by word of mouth from Sherif Abdullah by the Emir Dhari ibn Rashid, saying he would not be able to take the bridge defences that night.” The second attempt took place a week later :— “ On the I9th Sherif Ali’s army began moving into position soon after dawn. I left Sherif Ali at Jebel el-Kheyila and proceeded with the Egyptians to the Kashm el-Gazeil, where I was close to the bridges and could view the whole of the operations. The bombardment again started late, and the firing of the' 15-pounder guns on the bridge defences was very indifferent. “ I went to the Turkish mountain gun at the Kashm el- Gazeil, where I found an officer named Mustapha Effendi (Baghdadi). He was firing very indifferently at the Turkish posts 900 yards off on the lull. I pointed out to him that the Turks were coming out and entering the lower defences by the bridge, and that they would make a good maxim target. He then brought up one machine gun which he pretended to bring into action, and, as far as I could make out, broke the lock and put it out of action. I asked him to bring up the other gun, and he seemed deliberately to put this out of action too. I then pointed out that the Turks and their machine guns were now all down in the lower defences of the bridges: he then made a show of firing, and when the fire got close, he put this gun out of action.“ Thetwo 5-inch howitzers were doing pretty good practice with 50-pound Lyddite shells, but when I suggested to Mustapha Effendi that he should tell them they ought to shorten their range, he put the telephone out of action. Mustapha Effendi got orders for the infantry to attack. He sent for the officers ; every officer said he was too ill to move, and the men eventually went forward under the Shawishes. “ I could see the attack would never be pressed home, and as at this time I received a note from Sherif Ali to say that Abdullah had run out of water and had no hopes of taking Bpwat, I rode over to Sherif Ali and begged him to concentrate all the artillery fire on the lower bridge«defences, because, I said, we still had time to destroy the bridges. He immediately ordered all the guns to open fire on these. “The 15-pounder guns began to start and then shut up; the howitzers pounded away well, but as the telephone was cut, they had no one directing their fire. I went back to my position and found the infantry returning under machine-gun fire from the Turks. 1 asked them what had happened. They said there were no officers out to lead them, and as the Shawish who had been leading them had been killed, they had come back. The French, at this time, I could see in the far distance demolishing the line north of Bowat, and from Medina a train had come out and was shelling our right. “At dusk I asked Mustapha Effendi if he was not going to attempt to make an attack, but could get nothing out of him. A little later this officer came and said, if I would go ahead with the demolition party, he would follow with the attacking party. I had given my oath to Sherifs Ali and Abdullah that I would not advance on the bridges until the defences were taken, and Sherif Abdullah had sent a personal escort with me consisting of Sherif ibn Mutallib, Sheikh Ali el-Haweifi and about fifty Bedouins. These were furious with the Baghdadis, and told them plainly that they considered them traitors. “ About an hour after dark Mustapha Effendi again came to me and said, all the defences were in his hands and that he had orders from Sherif Ali that we were to blow up the bridge. Sheikh Ali el-Haweifi would not hear of me going and said it was all an invention on the officer’s part to get my party wiped out. He asked me to go forward and have a look for myself. We got to within about 500 yards of the Turk positipn and I lighted a match to see what would happen ; we at once came under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from the Turks. “ When I came back I ascertained from soldiers 1 met retiring, that there was not a soul in front. They had all come back. “ Shortly after this I retired my party about six miles for the night, and sent my Arab A.D.C. to Sherif Ali to say what had happened. “ I received a message from Sherif Ali to say, would I move to Harad and wait for him there ? I did this.“ About three hours after daylight Sherif Ali came up. He had l)een deserted by all his officers, and with the assistance of his slaves, was bringing' in his guns and Avater -columns himself. I told him all about the officer, Mnstapha, and that I considered he (the Sherif) had been let in by his officers. He assured me he had no intention to gi\ 7 e in because he had failed, and said he was going to try and Avorry the Turks by mystifying them and raiding them and moving his oavd camp about.’’ Lieut. Garrood adds some details on the demolition work carried out at PWat in all the attacks. We give the following extract:— “ Advantage was taken of the brilliant moonlight to make a good examination of the state of the railway before the demolition. It was very evident that there is a dearth of sleepers. In very many places one sleeper took the place of two, and occasionally 'the spanning Avas nearly two-and-a-half times the normal. “ The rails were for the most part whole ones. The insulators on telegraph poles were a mixed lot. Many of them Avere badly smashed but just serviceable. “ The large bridge blown up Avas of three spans. It consisted of masonry in cement piers, and the line was carried by rolled steel ‘ l ’ beams. The explosion left it a complete wreck and tore up the line for a good distance on either side.” Major Davenport’s full report of his visit to Sherif Ali’s camp (see p. 207) is also now to hand. He was pestered (as Avas also Sherif Abdullah, while there) by the Syrian and Baghdadi parties among the officers, each complaining of the other. The officers have abundance of female society and IWe in considerable luxury. So far as the cam]) goes, organization is good, especially in regard to the supply of food and water ; but artillery stores are in utter confusion, and none of the officers either keeps his guns well or understands them. They hold fancy ranks without regard to their competence. Mules Avere in good condition, but the Australian horses looked very feeble. There are practically no Bedouins in the camp, and Major Davenport believes that no Harb sections, except the Beni Mohammed, are uoav in the held. Many of them are undoubtedly trading with the enemy. When Major Davenport took his leave, he thanked the Sherif for allowing him to approach so near Medina. Ali replied frankly that, in the Rabugh days, he had had to adopt a very different attitude, because the Bedouins were unfamiliar with the sight of Europeans inland, and could not be trusted to forego Turkish rewards for the heads of British officers. He was uneasy even when Colonel doyce appeared at Bir Derwish a year ago (see our Ao. 54, p. 279), but nothing untoward '227 occurred, and since then British officers* had become much better known, and, for the most part, liked. He confessed he had asked Major Davenport partly as a test case, and, thanks be to Dod ! , not a Bedouin had growled. In the future he would not hesitate to invite British officers. DAWASIR AND NEJRAN. Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby, I.C.S., at present Political Agent at Riyadh, has accomplished another pioneer feat of exploration by reaching Dawasir. We are informed that he arrived there on May 30, and hoped to be back in Riyadh about June 18. To what point of the long u Wadyan ” he pushed we are not informed, but, presumably, at any rate to Dam and the compara tively settled and fertile district reported to lie round that town {see Arabia Handbook,’ i, p. 375), which acknowledges the suzerainty of Ibn Saud. Mr. Philby had planned to return through Dawasir last January, had King Husein allowed him to go back to Laif. Now, evidently, he has succeeded, from the other side, in exploring a region, hearsay reports of which have excited the curiosity of most Arabian travellers, from Niebuhr to Burton, Doughty and Leachman. While in Dawasir, Mr. Philby noted much traffic, especially in coffee, passing up from Yemen by way of Nejran. About the latter district, which has been seen only once by a European (Joseph Halevy, a French Jew, travelling as a Jerusalem Yemeni rabbi in 1870), he evidently heard a good deal, and he reports that the educated class among the Beni Yam, who inhabit it, and also among the even less known Qahtan, who range between it and Dawasir, is inclining towards Ibn Saud, partly from some sympathy with Akhwan ideas, partly in order to enjoy settled government. A chief of the Fahnad (?) section has recently been to Riyadh, and the chief of another section, the Rashid, was going to accompany Mr. Philby thither on his return. Presumably, these are Yam chiefs. Their tribe is of the Ismaili sect, and follows the Agha Khan, being the largest group of his adherents in the Arab-speaking countries. Next in importance comes, of course, the better known Lebanon group. About five hundred Yam—these tribesmen habitually take mercenary service—have been, or still are, with Idrisi; and we reported recently (p. 210) that a party of them was lying up for a Turkish convoy from Medina to Yemen in the spring of 1917, but failed to intercept it. The Turks have never exercised, or even claimed, authority in Nejran. We await with impatience further news from Mr. Philby, and hope that, in consideration of the great importance, political, ethnological and cartographical, of his visit to one of the darkest corners of Arabia, we may have as full a report as possible, whether for publication or not.— 228 — taker but the information then given to me was exaggei*^. following are the true figures : Majid .. Tasham 100 Jabir Mani. 105 Husein ibn Jabir. 151 Sultan ibn Husein. 124 Husein ibn Zeid. 480 (of this number 1G were killed at Murj. “ Jabir Mani is the chief sheikh, but he is a very hot-headed and impulsive person. Sultan ibn Husein is older than an} other, and generally acts as spokesman. He sets forth his case very lucidly and briefly, and is a very intelligent man with brilliant eyes, commanding presence and venerable appearance. The youngest sheikh is Husein ibn Zeid, who is a man of tew words, and looks a born commander. His dress is also neater than the others. The Yam are ordinarily very dirty and grasp ing but handsome and pleasant, I asked Sheikh Sultan why they were wasting their time and not using it in raiding the enemy country, or fighting a pitched battle in order to turn tie Turks out of ‘ Jebel Milh ? He replied that the Yam had paid their toll at M ur, and would do nothing more now till the end of their term. He said that the Idrisi had treated them shabbily, for he did not send any clothes or presents to their sheikhs aftei the fight at Mur. This appears to be the only explanation of the lethargic attitude of a tribe well known for its fighting qualities. Northern Area. We are almost entirely without news about operations either at Maan or on the railwav to the north. The only information from Feisal's headquarters is that Sherif Yasir was attacked, on June 22. at el-Hasa bv an enemy column of two battalions with a field bat ter v and two machine-gun companies, which had come from Kutrani. Hasir stated that, after a sharp fight, he drove the Turks back to Fareifra, killing twenty and taking fifteen prisoners, including an officer. But, since he added that enemy reinforcements were arriving from the north and he expected the attack to be renewed, his action can only have checked for the moment the push southward, which is intended to relieve Maan. Certain northern and eastern tribes, we hear, are getting impatient for action : but. if they can be kept quiet till we are able to ARABIA. North-west Intelligence.supply them and make effective use of their enthusiasm, it is rather t;o our advantage than otherwise that Maan should continue to strain enemy supplies and transport and to keep a considerable force echeloned along the line of communications from Amman. Troops so employed suffer much in health and temper from the insecurity around them, the summer heat and the shortage of water. Meanwhile every effort is being made to reinforce Feisal’s regular army, and Arab recruiting has been going well of late. There is difficulty, however,, in inducing trans-Jordan refugees, e.g. the Saltiyeh, to enlist except for operations in their own particular districts. A British air-raid, carried out by fifteen machines on the station, camps and aerodrome at Amman on June-23, had success ful results. A survey party, sent in May to fix astronomically various points on the railway between Maan and Tebuk, has successfully accomplished its task—a most important cartographical gain. Southern Area. We have heard little of importance, beyond what is contained in the reports dealt with separately on page 223. A telegram from Sherif Abdullah announces that, on June 21, a party of his carried out extensive demolitions between Seil Matara and Meshed stations. He claims 600 rails over a stretch of about five kilo metres and two large culverts. Also a Turkish intermediate post was burnt. General. Ho further news has reached us from Khurma, and indeed, no statement of the particular situation there, which caused King Husein suddenly to demand guns and rifles for Mecca, has ever come in. A reinforcement of eighty-two men, however, with two old Turkish guns and two machine-guns, was despatched from Mecca on June 13, and that was about all the King could send. His forces are, of course, all up in the north quite out of reach, and there is no doubt that Taif and Mecca lie dangerously open to attack from Central Arabia or from the south. The force of 800 or so Bedouins sent up originally to Khurma W as commanded by Sherif Hamud ibn Zeid, younger brother of Sherif Shakir. Khalid, the rebel Sherif at Khurma, is of the Abadila clan, and a former friend and close adherent of the ruling family in Mecca. Sheikh Husein Mubeirik, of the Zobeid Harb, is still in the hills behind Rabugh and leading the life of an outlaw. According to Sheikh Mohammed Areifan (who is, to a certain extent, his man for tribal reasons), he sits on the fence, unwilling to break with the Turks, because he understands that on the same fence sat or still sit, greater men than he, e.g. the late Suleiman Rifada, of the Billi, Ibn Rashid, the Imam Yahya and lastly,— 230 — Ibn Saud. The loyalty of the last to os in this war, says Areifan,,is not commonly believed among Arabs. King Husein has refused grace to Husein Mubeirik till he has committed himself irretrievably against the Turks. [ Late News.—Northern Area .—On June 24 the Arabs captured a complete convoy of ten mules, carrying supplies and munitions, between Aneza and Jerdun. Further demolitions have been carried out south of the latter station. On June 30 Maan was heavily bombarded, the reply being weak. There has been an inter-tribal row between the Howeitat and Beni Sakhr which lias delayed operations, but is being settled. Desertions from Maan to Feisal are now from four to five men per diem. On June 28 the Southern Arab column, composed largely of Beni Atiyah, captured the station at Kalaat el-Ahmar (Harret el- Amara) and remained in possession, demolishing rolling-stock and track. We hope to have further details to record. The above is all that our air-observers were in a position to see. Southern Area .—Sherif Abdullah reports that, about June 27, his demolition column destroyed both rails over a long stretch of track between Abu ISTaam and Stabl An tar ; and also all telegraph poles over the same distance. 1 II Yemen. The Imani s Claims and Demands. The Imam Yahya has sent into Aden a fresh batch of letters, dated May 5. Those addressed to our Resident contain little but generalities about ancient treaties, ancient friendships, ancient rights. More illuminating is a letter to his agent, Nagib Abdel Wahid ibn Ahmed el-Khaulani. In this the Imam says that he would have attained his “object” long ago, had we given him assistance (presumably that object was expulsion of the Turks, but it is not specified). Why do we support Idrisi who falls back two steps for every one he gains and is hated by all Yemen ? He himself (the Imam) only wishes to bring peace to his people, who are of a boorish habit and character ; but to do that he and our only friend. Therefore he asks us to aid and abet him to recover all that his forbears ruled, including the Tihama and the Aden hinterland except Lahej, which^ last he renounces for the sake of that one just man, the late Sir Ahmed Fadl. Also he more than hints that he wants to go forth and conquer a good deal that his forbears did not rule. 1 he plain hint that avc are to choose between the writer and Idusi, and the demand for an absolutely free hand m territorial acquisition are new and unwelcome features of this letter. For the rest the Imam reiterates his former conditions, including those agreed to by our Resident in his letter of March 20 (whichwe know the [mam had received before writing on May 5 ) and adds two new ones. One of these, intended to subserve his territorial ambition, is that we agree to communicate only through himself with all u Yemen ” (U, South-West Arabian) chiefs, except the Abdali Sultan : the other, that we emmoe not to interfere m internal Yemen affairs. The first traverses'; with out mentioning it explicitly, (he Resident’s stipulation that all and any of our stipendiary and treaty chiefs must be kept outside the discussion : the second might be agreed to in return for such an undertaking about external affairs as is embodied in all our treaties with briilf chiefs, combined with some valid guarantee of the interests of British subjects, and perhaps also of all Christians and even Jews. It must not be lost sight of that, in the past, independent Imamic Government in Yemen has been about as bad and ineffective as a government can be. Final]v, we hope that the Imam will not be armed by us, till we have every reason able assurance that the arms will be used against, not by, the* I urks ! ^ NOTES. Prayers for the Caliph. Enquiry has been made lately about the practice .actually followed by Imams in the Friday prayer, in regard to mentioning the Turkish Caliph, in various parts of the Moslem world now dominated by powers at war with Turkey. In Egypt, we are informed officially, an unnamed and unspecified “ Khalifa of the Muslamin ” is recommended to God’s grace in the same prayer as is put up for H.H. Sultan Fuad. This leaves to the Faithful much the same secret discretion as was exercised, in the 18th century, in Great Britain when the toast of “The King” was drunk without t a name. In Baghdad, the practice is not so uniform. In the larger number of mosques, it is like the Egyptian, i.e. an unspecified Khalifa is prayed for ; in a few, no Khalifa is now prayed for at all ; in about half-a-dozen, the Ottoman Sultan is still mentioned by name ; in two or three, King Husein’s name has been substituted since his public repudiation of the Ottoman Caliph, published in the Kiblah last January. In Hejaz, no Khalifa is mentioned in the Khutbah now. The use of “Emir el-Mumanin ” as a title for King flusein in the prayer, reported in January from Yambo, was apparently an isolated instance, due to the personal and interested action of a local official. In Palestine, the present practice is like the Egyptian. Hiisein to Ibn Sand. Copies of two letters from the former to the latter, dated respectively February 8 and May 7 of the current year, have reached us. Both are reproachful, sarcastic and distinctly acrid— 232 — in tone, and it is not surprising that replies to them were heated Thp first lays on Ibn Sand responsibility tor all the Ateiba troubles, because he had armed the Ghat-Ghat gang O-Atowan fanatics: pp. 64,129), and it adjures the son ° £ luf^ns and father of Turki to open his eyes and see that such ruflian are unworthy of his religion, his valour and his igm y- beginning and the end of this matter are with God , do you choose what you will do ! ’ n i • The second letter repeats the reproach, and denies ai accusation that the pulpits of Mecca have denounced the people of Neid ; it states, however, that the said pulpits ask God to destroy, among other people, Mubtadiyah, i.e. those who initiate new doctrines ! The King claims to protect Ateibah wherever they are, and alludes to a letter he had written direct to fahad ibn Maamir, Ibn Baud’s Emir in Boreida—a letter to which, we know, Ibn Baud objects, not unreasonably, as a very incorrect communication for Husein to send to one of his (ibn hands) officers. Incidentally we learn from another allusion a new tact about the events following Ibn Sand’s defeat at Jerab (se&lt;? 1917, pp 126 346). The Shammar brought down to Medina the flags captured from Ibn Sand; but Sherif All interfered and prevented their display by the Turks in the market. Arabs and Jews. The Kiblah, No. 183, of May 23, contains a liberal article on the Jewish element in Palestine. Its gist is as follows : The Mokattam had written on the efforts ol the Zionists m Palestine and their endeavours to develope the country in agri culture, etc. At the same time the Mokattam advised the natives to take example from the foreigners (apropos of the visit of the Zionist Mission). The Kiblah adds its voice to that of the Mokattam in hoping that the inhabitants will accept that advice. It is said that Idle Jews form one tenth of the population in Palestine, and whether this be correct or not, it is enough to indicate that, if such a small community is capable ol such great deeds, other people may well take it as an example. The Jews are a very capable nation, and their failure in the past was due only to the fact that they were persecuted and cut-off from the means of progress. It is noteworthy that Jews have come from all parts of the world to inhabit Palestine, whereas the original inhabitants ol Palestine have emigrated to other parts of the world. The number of the former, therefore, has increased from 14,000 to 45,000. This was solely due to their love of their country and home. The natives of Palestine, therefore, ought to unite and work together, as their holy books and traditions instruct them to unite for the common welfare. The Jewish case is a sort of school or lesson for them, and they ought to profit by it. The societies and clubs, which have assisted the Jews, are indirectly assisting other elements among the natives. These last are receiving a good example, which they should follow.Shamiyah Chiefs. King Husein lias behaved correctly about the offers of Saud Subhan and Hamud Saadun {see p. 211), recommending both to carry their cases in the first instance to Baghdad. The two messengers sent by the former, named Anbar ibn Guma el-Sabah and Anad ibn Eid el-Sherifiran, will sail for Basra, via Bombay, early in July. As for Hamud Saadun, the King says he has a friendly feeling for him, but rates him a man of no power or influence. The King has, evidently, been a little hurt by our disinclination to let him act mediator for these two chiefs, and, very likely, he cherished no ultimate design whatever. This sort of mediation is the most ordinary thing in the world in Arab politics, and it cannot but have seemed somewhat strange and ungracious of us not to accept it from the bherif. Tribal Troubles in the Hamad. It has been reported to Sherif Feisal that a great many camels have been filched of late from Rowalla and Howeitat herds, and that these tribes suspect Amarat thieves, acting under the orders of Fahad el-Hadhdhal and Jazaa el-Mijlad, the chief of the Zebinah sub-section and younger brother of Mohammed, the Dahamisha sectional chief. In order to stop this thieving and obtain redress, Audah ibn Zaal, of the Howeitat, and a Rowalla chief are going overland to Baghdad to state a case on behalf of their two tribes to our Mesopotamian authorities. We were not asked to sanction their mission, but merely informed that they were going. And, of course, we have not heard the other side of the case. We. gather, however, that Captain Leachman, who is with the Amarat, thinks it is six of one and half a dozen of the other—as it usually is with Bedouin camel-thieving ! Mohammed Nasrr Mukbil. The well known Sheikh of Mawiya is being heard ol again as leader of a recruiting party among the Amiri and Shairi tribes, on behalf of Ali Said Pasha. He is reported to have arrived at Dhala on May 17, and to have been joined there by a considerable force of Turks sent up from Lahej on May 24. But a further report says that he had gone on to Kataba, whither the Turks were to follow him. W r e do not feel quite sure that the motives of these movements of his are really as represented by the Aden agents. It is quite as likely that the Turkish force i/hunting theldawiya sheikh, as that it is co-operating with him. Haiti and Kathiri. The Kaiti Sultan has written to Aden, under date May 19, that the Kathiri delegates from Singapore {see p. 90 ; but Nasir : )lM Omar has taken the place of the first one there named) were to leave in two days time with Seyyid Husein for the Hadra- maut They appeared to be in earnest and willing to do all ii i if i-'rS ' . — 234 — they could to get the agreement ratified, whicli they had made provisionally with himself. He hoped that the tvathnu chiels of the Aid Hadramaut would themselves come down to MaUlla to clinch the matter. Subsequently, ho has had a satisfactory letter from those chiefs. Abyssinia. Unrest and uncertainty were still the order of the day up to May 22, the date of our latest official despatch from Adis Abeba*. There is a strong current working to undermine lias Taffari, but the Shir Alequas (Commander of tlm -thousand) is the only officer at present maintaining an attitude of open hostility. The rest of the malcontents, mostly younger officers, are content to talk, defame, obstruct and work on the impress by insinuations that the lias intends to supplant her. Geimano- Turk influence is at work to produce an impression that 1ms Taffari has sold the country in advance to the Entente Powers. He is apparently a weak, if well meaning, man, who rides the breaking wave of anarchy wherever it may carry him. Om Legation, however, thinks the summer at any rate will pass quietly. . . w n Dejaz Kabada Mangasha is taking over, as lias, the YYolIo province, where Lij Yasu’s supporters have recently defeated a punitive expedition sent to Battu. His own late governorate of Wollamo has been in a state of disturbance, owing to the Gallas actively resisting the Abyssinian officers, who, on learning of their leader’s prospective transfer, went raiding about the district for stock and slaves to take off with them. Dejaz Kassa, in the north, looks like being forced over thy Italian border, having failed to collect any following in Wolkait and Simyen.TT ,.JLJ-lAEa SECRET.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.HEJAZ RAILWAY, EL-ULA TO BOWAT. ^ The difficulty of' procuring a route-report of the Hejaz Railway, south of el-Ula, the last point to which Christians used to be allowed by the Turks to travel, is notorious. Therefore Major W. A. Davenport, M.C., who has been engaged in operations on the line at various points south of el-Ula since the spring of 1917, was asked to collect from notebooks and reports, and to tabulate, his observations. Since he has been concerned primarily with attacks on stations and posts, his report deals chiefly with these ; but it makes a notable contribution towards the complete account of the line which is desired. It should be compared with Lieut. Clayton’s report on the section from Abu Naam to Bowat, printed in our No. 68, p. 445. u El-Ula .—I have not actually seen the military part of the station, but in 1917 obtained a distant view of the native quarters, which seemed to consist of many houses and a large grove. It is now reported from native sources that the military station has been much strengthened in defences, and that the Turks have connected a large spring by an aqueduct to the station. The railway valley looked about 4,000 yards wide here. “ The country west of el-Ula consists of masses of hills as far as the Wadi Jizzil, and is very waterless. In 1917 it was found impossible to keep near the line for lack of water. I even tually found water in the Wadi Jizzil by digging forty-six feet, and four wells were bored, now called Bir Salim ; the water was salty but just drinkable. These have now been buried by this year’s seil. Therefore the country between Wadi Jizzil and el-Ula forms a very good barrier against attack from the west, on account of the nature of the country and the impossibility of keeping any body of men out from the Wadi Jizzil more than forty-eight hours. a El-Bedai .—Nothing known. u Meshed.— Here the railway runs through a narrow wadi with clift'-like red hills on either side. I got fairly near the station in 1917 ; in the dark it seemed to consist of one building and a very long platform. “ Sell Matran .—From Meshed the railway comes out into an open plain about ten miles broad, and runs past a fortified post about seven kilometres out of Meshed. In 1917 there was quite a quantity of wood on each side of the railway ; now it seems to have been mostly cut. “ The station at Seil Matran itself consists of one square, two- storied, well-built building, and a platform about fifty yards long surrounded by trenches ; opposite the door of the building, in the middle of the line, there is a cement basin with a pipe run- nino- to a bio’ cement tank under the building, and the only water supply is this. Therefore it is entirely dependent on train- service for water.— 236 — “ From the station, the line runs south over an open plain for about eight miles, and then enters the mountain gorges, where begins a°regular chain of sangar defences between stations up to Abu Naam. “Zumurud. —The line enters mountains between several strong- posts and bears slightly west and runs through a chain of posts to Zumurud, which consists of one big square building. On a hill close to the station there is a post with a mountain gun so placed that it can fire on to the camel-tracks running to Seil Matran and the approaches to its own fort. It is reported that there is a well, but that the water is too salty for drinking. The wood near the station seems to have been all cut down for fuel. About two miles west of the station, in a cup in the mountains on the old Pilgrimage Road, is an old square fort in fairly good repair ; outside this fort are two big wells with ample water, and inside is a splendid big masonry-built well with inexhaustible good water. In July 1917, Col. Newcombe and myself seized this water and held it for several days against the Turk ; but the disadvantage is that the outer station defences on the hills can fire directly on to the approaches of the fort. In February 1918, when passing, I sent scouts to have a look at these wells, and they were reported blown in by the Turk. “ From Zumurud the railway twists through a narrow valley until about seven kilometres out. There the T urks are reported to have a strong post, and to be boring a well, blasting through the rock with the explosive they have picked up on the line. They have reached water, and it is believed it will be good, when the taste of explosive wears off. All the line here is protected by small posts, and many curved rails are used in construction. “ Bir Jedid, known by the Arabs as Soweira. I have not seen the actual station, nor do I know what its water supply is. All round the post is a ring of fortifications, and last time 1 visited it they used one mountain gun and two machine guns. Here the Turks have been using the wadis running to Jebel Nahar for fuel-cutting. Close to this station, inland about fifteen miles, is a water supply at Smar (this also is only five hours’ ride from Zumurud), which makes it possible for a force to assemble on water unseen in the mountains, and remain in the vicinity of the line. From Bir Jedid the line winds like a snake on curved rails to Toweira ; there were originally many culverts, but these have now all been destroyed and the Turks have filled them in with sand. “ Toweira .—I have not seen the station, nor do I know what its water supply is ; but in the defences in the hills there was a mountain gun. From here again the railway winds through the mountains over many destroyed culverts to a strong post known as Wayban, about seven kilometres out; it is reported that there is a mountain gun here. The line then coils through a narrow valley to Mudahrij, which fort I did not actually see as there was a strong fortified hill between me and it; the hills on the other•* side of the line were also strongly fortified, and there was a mountain gun that can fire up and down the line. The line then proceeds, still through mountains, to Hedia. Hedia, known by the Arabs as Hareimal. I could not see the station, as it lies low down, and is surrounded by strong defences. 1 counted twenty-two posts in a circle round it, and there were a mountain gun and a biggish howitzer. The Wadi Tabji crosses the line here, and the bridge is reported to have about twenty arches and to be well fortified. There are a pump ing station and a wireless installation. On a still night you can hear the wireless for about five miles. As far as Hedia there are only two strands of telegraph wire ; after this a soft copper tele phone wire is continued as far as Jedahah. Continuing south, the line takes a bend round some fortified hills, and comes into the open, passing a long line of sangars running east and west, and runs about five miles to Jebel Hamra el-Hedia, where, under some strong post, it makes a very sharp hairpin bend and runs through a valley in the mountain ; after leaving this it runs about two kilometres straight, leaving Jebel Athlam three miles to the west, and then, with a long steady curve, enters a big cutting through a ridge of black lava. “El Wagga, known by the Turks as el-Tranji, which means the Cutting. At the north end there is a strong, roughly-made fort; this formerly was surrounded -by land mines, but they were mostly exploded by our shell fire. The cutting seems to be about 300 yards long, and at the southern end there are sangars and tents overlooking the Wadi Alhui, which crosses the line here, and is a big thoroughfare to the east. It used to be held only by infantry ; it is now reported to have a gun and a machine gun. From here the line takes a bend south-west and then runs straight through a very sandy valley, in which all the culverts have been destroyed. To the east the mountains are close to the line ; on the west about one-and-a-half miles away are long stretches of lava cut through with wadis. “ Jedahah .—I have notseen the station, but the garrison chiefly lives in the fortifications, which consist of a hill west, up which the telephone line runs to a signal office on the top. Round this there are a ring of sangars and a gun that looks like a pom-pom. The hills east of the line are also all fortified, looking down on to the Wadi Hamdh. Jedahah is said to have no water supply ; but about four miles west there is Bir Abu el-Hilla in the Wadi Hamdh, where you only have to dig about six feet for water ; but the Turks have filled these wells in and mined the ground round to prevent people from digging for water. “ This Signal Post is evidently a very important point in the railway defences. From it it must be possible to see all the Hamdh Valley as far as Umm Salilah, the junction of all the wadis, and thus the Turk gets a good view of movements of evervbody to the Wadi Ais and the direct line of water to the coast. The telephone warns el-Wagga and Hedia of any m:— 238 movement or reason for alarm, and, by flag, the Hamdh Bridge defences and Abu Naam. I tested this system by trying to capture some Turks who were working below the defences, and when we were spotted and had to move out, I had a good opportunity of seeing the system. A few minutes after the alarm was given,'! could see all defences from the Hamdh Bridges to el- Wagga being manned, and out from Abu Naam came mounted troops. After that it was not practical to stddy the matter furthei. “ From here the railway enters a valley about 2,000 yards wide, with hills close to it on the east. When it reaches the Wad’i Hamdh, it takes a right-angle turn to the east under cliffs ; then goes south again, and proceeds to cross the valley of the Hamdh. There are two big stone bridges ; the first one consists of twenty-two arches, of which two have at some time been blown up and have been filled in with sandbags ; the second bridge is about eleven arches. East of the railway and in the centre of the wadi, close to the two bridges, is a strongly fortified black ridge covering the two bridges. From here the Hamdh runs due east, then turns south, and runs parallel with the railway to Medina. The line now runs straight to Abu Naam. On the east, there is a range of high hills close to the railway ; on the west, there are wadis and a collection of smaller hills. u Abu Naam .—Two big square stone buildings, a water tower and a pumping station. At the present moment, close to the station, there are two squares of wooden and matting stables with two squadrons of cavalry in them. On the high hills east of the station there is a strong fortified post; while to the west there is a ridge of low hills which are strongly fortified, and a field gun is dug in. From here the Railway is visible running through the Wadi Umm Hashim to Istabl An tar. On the east, is a long range of hills close to the railway with small posts on it ; west, there are about five miles of open plain. “Istabl Antar .—The stations seems to consist of one building only, and on the east there seems to be a camp ; to the west, there is Jebel Antar (or Fahala) which has a strong post on it. From here the railway enters a large open plain and runs to Bueir. “Bueir .—I have not seen the station, but it is reported to be big, with workshops, water, and water-storage tanks. From here the line still runs in a big plain to Bir Nasif. “Bir Nasif .—Nothing known. “Bowat .—North of Bowat the hills again come down to the railway ; on the east there is a low range of hills between the Hamdh and the line ; on the west there is a succession of hills about two miles from the line, all intersected by wadis. Bowat itself consists of two square buildings, and is used as a wood- dump for fuel. The station is chiefly defended by a small hill close by with a mountain gun and two machine guns. From here the line runs through low lying hills, intersected with wide wadis, to el-Muerda, where there are numerous posts, and many strongly built large culverts ; evidently a large flow of water— 289 — crosses the line in this neighbourhood ; but from el-Muerda to bowat lately every culvert and bridge has been totally destroyed and the lurks have filled them in with sand. From el-Muerda the railway crosses a large watershed until it reaches the Mellal bridges (1 believe the Turks name them Gazed). On the east close to the line, is a strongly fortified ridge of hills • on the west about 2,000 yards of open plain. These bridges consist of a big six-arched stone bridge then a high embankment, and then a large bridge of twenty-seven arches, of which the centre'three have, at some time, been destroyed and filled in with masonry ; then comes an embank ment and then a bridge of eleven square openings. All this is strongly defended from the east, and machine guns have been dug in to sweep the bridges. In the rains there must be a tremendous flow of water. Under these the seils of Melha, Dulma, Bowat, Hurad, Gefr and Melal all join up and, seeming to be known as the Seil Mellal, flow under the bridges and thence direct to the Hamdh. k ‘ Just south and west of the bridges a ridge of hills comes down to the line ; the eastern point of this is known as the Kashm el-Gazeil and is 900 yards distant from the bridges. This ridge really commands the whole line, and if held, would permanently close it, as the western end of the ridge rests on the road to Medina, via Bir Darwish. On the railway below this ridge there is a small conical hill, which has been dug into and fortified. It is known as Gazeil, and was originally an old Hajj post before the days of the railway. It now acts as part of the bridge defences, and probably holds about 100 infantry. “ From here I have not seen the railway ; but it seems to go into hills again and run up a valley through Hafira and Muheit, and then to bend round Jebel Ohod to Medina. “In the rainy season the Turk has to perform enormous labour to keep the railway running. I am told the embankment has sometimes become so sodden that, before now, railway service has had to stop for three months in peace time. This year there were exceptional rains, and at the big bridges the flood flowed over the top. In *the valleys the ballast was often entirely washed away from under, bending the rails. The Turk used to pick the line up, relay the bed and straighten the rails ; raiding- parties would then blow the line up for him, and the Turk would relay it; then would come a sandstorm and cover the line feet deep for miles ; the Turk would come out and remove the sand, and so ad infinitum! “From Abu Naam to Seil Matran there is a tremendous number of culverts, and with the exception of the big bridges, these have been systematically destroyed and the Turk has filled them in with sand. The railway, in the rains, is obviously dependent on its drainage system for its efficiency, and the rains of 1918-1919 should do it enormous damage, as the drainage system has been broken up.240 — THE LOSS OF LOHEIYA. The diaries o£ Major Tippetts and Captain Nasr ed-Din Ahmed, Politicial Liaison Officer, have come to hand, for the period June 7 to June 15, and contain an account of the events leading to the evacuation of Loheiya by Tdrisi s troops, and ot the evacuation itself. It all began with a Turkish feint on Beit Mokhai, which drew out the Idrissian troops from Beit Husein for a fight lasting far into the night of June 7. The next morning, while the tired men were drawing their rations, eating and sleeping, the Turks came suddenly upon them, causing a stampede of all arms to Atn (Atan), except for a small party of hill-Arabs and others, wdio fought with the two guns till these were put out of action and abandoned. Then they retired with a loss of sixty dead to Atan, where, and at Kumri'ah, nearly 1,600 fighting men were now collected. Major Tippetts rode out to Atan, but though he found Seyyid Mustapha doing his best, the general morale was bad and there was utter lack of organisation. Diversions (unauthorised) by the garrisons of Abu Halik and Jebel Juda against Rassas proved fruitless, and no counter-attack on Beit Husein could be organised. The next day the hostages and prisoners kept at Loheiya were embarked for Midi. Early in the morning of June 10 the Atan garrison retired on Lohei} 7 a without warning and without firing a shot, after some 1,200 paid troops had deserted from there and from Kumriah, together with all the Beni Marwan irregulars. The Turks opposed were about 600 regulars and many Arab irregulars ; but more were reported to be on their way down from the Abs country. The influx raised an acute water difficulty in Loheiya, and during the night of the 10th there were two deaths from thirst—not surprising since sea water had to be mixed with sweet water for the troops ! Some water came in by dhows in the afternoon of the 11th, and for a time, on the promise of water sufficient for next day from H.M. Ships, a plan of attacking Atan again was favoured and the hills round Loheiya were manned, but, for lack of water-supply, insufficiently. Finally, about 5 p.m., evacuation was decided upon on grounds of the impossibility of getting water-supply or defence works organized in any satisfactory manner. A British landing party removed the breaches of two 15-pounders and one 5-inch howitzer just before dark ; all ammunition and stores possible were removed in dhows, but some 200 cases and some flour had to be left; and at 5 a.m. on the 12th the Arab troops were embarked. Many of them had scattered and only some 400 were actually evacuated. Arab auxiliaries of the Turks entered the town that afternoon, about 5 p.m. and looted what they could, most of the inhabitants having got away into the interior or to Murk Island. The wounded Arabs had been embarked and sent up to Jeizan by dhows, and many refugees, after being supplied with water from— 241 H.M. Ships, went up the coast in the same way. Supplies and ammunition were sent to the Abu Halik garrison. The Jebel Juda garrison was withdrawn with its mountain gun. Idrisi’s troops have now retired on Habl and cannot take the offensive or some time. So far as we can understand^ their total loss in guns amounts to five. TRANS-JORDAN ARABS IN 1917. Abdul Kadir, ex-Kaimmakam of Tafila, captured there m December 1917, has responded to interrogation with a long statement about East^ Jordan politics. His tribal information is unsystematic and faulty, and his views on tribal sympathies are m the main out of date, being based on data nearly a year old. w hd e his general ideas on Arab politics are not unsound, his particular experience of the situation immediately preceding oui advance into South Palestine is worth reproducing, as a help to understand the subsequent situation. Being, early in 1917, Mudir of Madeba and Assistant Kaimmakam of Salt, Abdul Kadir was approached by Belkawiyeh and Beni Hasan representatives, professedly desirous of joining the jihad (really, no doubt, in quest of cash, arms and food). “ He referred this request to his Mutessarif, who asked Jemal Pasha whether the offer could be accepted. The latter referred the matter to the Government, who sent to es-Salt a certain Lieut.-Col. Mohammed Ali Bey with the title of ‘Commander of the Tribal Jihad.’ This officer proceeded to enrol ninety per cent of the tribesmen as volunteers ; but soon trouble arose chiefly on account of the incapacity of the officer and because the Turks refused to distribute money to the tribesmen and their Sheikhs. Bad administration and lack of hard cash soon caused the ardour and warlike spirit of the volunteers to cool down considerably. The Government had given the ranks of Major and Captain to the Sheikhs and those of 1st and 2nd Lieutenant to the notables, at the same time informing them that they would receive the pay of gendarmes ! As a result of this there were only 200 ‘patriots’ who drew the LT. 4 per month due to them, and they took good care that they received this money in cash, for, although uncivilised, they had already discovered that there was a great difference in the value of cash and paper. “At the present day the policy of the Turkish Government is to leave these tribes alone as much as possible. From Deraa southwards all purchases are paid for in cash. The Government has purchased a large quantity of produce which has all been sent towards Damascus. About eight months ago a German merchant, authorised by the Turkish Government, bought 300 wagon-loads of corn which were despatched by ‘ grande vitesse.’— 242 — This German was the bearer of an order from the Government to the effect that all civilians and soldiers were to grant him every possible facility on pain of severe punishment. In addition to this, a peremptory telegram was sent by Jemal rasha confirming this order. . .... “ Many of the tribes had been desirous of participating in the Jihad, but the great objection to their being recruited was that they are not accustomed to training and discipline. The Turkish Government then decided to use them for fighting hostile tribes in their own way, and was on the point of issuing the necessary orders when the Beni Sakhr demanded that the payment of the Agricultural Tax should be postponed for one year, alleging that the method of levying this tax was unfair. The system in force was the following:—Should the produce of the land in any one year be less than in the preceding year, instead of having to pay a proportionately smaller tax, the tribes were required to pay on the average yield for the two years. The Beni Sakhr stated that the smallness of the produce was not their fault, but that of the Government assessors. Since, however, their complaints met with no response, they took matters into their own hands and chased the government assessors out of the country. The Government thereupon incited the Belkawiyeh to attack the Beni Sakhr. Abdul Kadir, in his official capacity as Administrator of this district, was obliged to carry out Jemal Pasha’s orders, and three days later the Belkawiyeh, with 1,000 well equipped and armed horsemen, attacked the Beni Sakhr, looted and burnt their villages and killed a considerable number of notables and others. These events took place towards the end of 1917.” ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. (a) Northern Area. Further news about the capture of Kalaat el-Ahmar (Hallat or Harret el-Ammar)* arrived when our last issue {see p. 230) had gone to press. From it we learn that sixty prisoners, including four officers, and also a machine gun, were captured. A locomotive and the station tank were wrecked, and permanent way and culverts were demolished for a considerable distance. The Arabs and our motor-gun section O then withdrew, unaware, unfortunately, that the garrison of Mudowara had evacuated their station and marched off north, *Idallat el-Ammar is the correct Arab name ; but Turks say Harret. Kalaat el-Ahmar is an invention of the railway people, which has got into all our maps.— 243 — leaving an important water-supply as well, doubtless, as much material of war at the mercy of any attacking force. The re seating soldiers^ themselves also, over a hundred strong, could have been caught in the open. 6 A part of these, however, about forty strong and including home officers, did not reach Maan. Having halted short of water while the rest went into Maan to despatch a relief convoy back’ they were rounded up on July 3, together with those who were returning from Maan to their relief, with many animals, by a party of Howeitat scouts sent out from Feisal’s headquarters. Altogether, fifty Turks were captured, and ten more are said to have died on the march. Another Howeitat force of 150 riders was sent south to Mudowara, as soon as the situation had been realised at Aba Lissan. These will, no doubt, find the station re-occupied by a relief force from the south, but weakly held. A locomotive and seventeen trucks were seen there by our airmen on July 3, and two days later our planes returned and were not fired upon. Successful raids have been carried out by our Air Force. One, on Kerak citadel, on July 2, registered nine direct hits. L he second on Kutrani, on J uly 5, heavily bombed and machine- gunned the force there. The third, on J uly 2, was directed against Maan village, where, according to refugees who have come in subsequently, many casualties and much damage resulted. An armoured car reconnaissance east of the railway reached the Jafar wells (six in a group with abundant constant supply) where 200 Howeitat tents of Abu Tayi were found. Proceeding thence to the Bair wells (three giving a fair constant supply), the observers found Sheikh Audah ibn Zaal with thirty Howeitat tents, and a mounted section of Rowalla under Mujhim Shaalan. Southern Area. A refugee, who left Medina in the early part of May, has imparted rather unusually interesting and apparently reliable information about the place at that date. He is Said Mohammed, a Tunisian of Sfax, a man of education and substance, and as an owner of date groves, he gives important testimony that, owing to the abundance of rain last winter and spring, the date crop in Medina district is likely to be a bumper one. Normally the yield is about one and a half million kilos., but this coming season two millions are expected. When the informant left, only about 500 civilians all told were in the city, and the regular troops were almost all in the outer defences and on the railway. Several of the town gates had been removed and burnt for fuel. As for railway plant, spare rails were exhausted and many sidings had been taken up ; one large locomotive (No. 21) and a small one, used for water-trains, were alone serviceable, and no through train had left or arrived— 244 — for two and a half months. Money and a special van of books and documents travelled by the last train to leave. For tiansport purposes Fakhri had about 500 camels and as many mules. An Arab Yuzbashi, of Haifa, who deserted from el-Ula on May 30, states that there are no new rails left there, but only some 2,000 mended spares. Only two out of six sidings still remained in place. As to supplies for the garrison, they came from Medina monthly. Besides these some forty to fifty kilos, of dates were held in reserve by the native population, but little grain. If pressed for the latter, the townsmen would revolt. The best dates (Mic) are hidden ; others sell at P.T. 25 the oke. There is a certain leakage of grain, coffee, sugar, tea and rice from the Sherifiaii Billi, but it is fortuitous and inegular, and now impeded by a special patrol of Sherif Sharaf’s. Troops are weak as the result of a scurvy epidemic last winter. Some Jewish engineers in the place used to get the 1 ossische Aeituny and the Berliner TcLqeblcitt and spread news of German victories, which was believed. ’ Abdel Hamid Bey left Medain Salih for Medina on the day of Ibn Rashid’s departure. He had been the main propagandist among the Arabs. Supplies to the Rifada sheikhly house had stopped, pending Sheikh Ibrahim Rifada’s submission, and the local agent of the family, one Sahni (?), is not allowed to leave el-Ula. Another deserter, who left Medain Salih on June 13, says that engine fuel is found only by using old sleepers, all collection of wood from the desert having ceased. Ibn Rashid, who had been receiving of late only one camel-load of grain per diem, killed three camels for meat on the day of his flight, being without other supplies for the road. 1 hat he fled secretly and in anger, is evidently the popular local belief. (General. From a letter, dated Ramadan 13, sent to Sherif Sharaf by Sheikh Shlash ibn Mohammed, the commander of the Ring’s Ageyl at Teima {see No. 69, p. 448) ; it appears that the place is short of food. A Sa’ah of grain {i.e. 1/48 of an ardebj costs five dollars. Sherif Abdullah has been supplying Teima from his stores (or has been supposed to be supplying it); but, presumably, there has been some breakdown, and therefore, Sheikh Shlash appeals to Sharaf. The latter, however, having no camel transport of his own, cannot comply. Nor can he send up dynamite, which also is demanded for some purpose unknown. Ali Suleiman esh-Sharqi, principal sheikh of the Duleim {see No. 70, p. 459), has sent an envoy with letters to King Husein and Emir Feisal. Their purport is not yet known to us. ^Late News .— Northern Area. —On July 4, the Arabs rushed a post between Jerdun and Aneza and took fifteen prisoners ; they demolished the track over five kilometres distance, and again wrecked a partially repaired bridge. Desertion is increasing, twenty, including an officer, having come in from Maan in three245 zJ ^ — days. So far as Maan itself goes, it has been relieved by the arrival of some 300 all ranks of the 75th Regiment, with six machine guns, on July 3 ; but though about 300 men are repairing the line between Fareifra and Hasa, and work is going on at three points, railway communication is a long way from re-established, and our air reconnaissance on July 6 observed broken bridges as far north as Wadi Sultani, between Kutrani and Hasa. General .—Sherif Ali reports that the convoy of 1,800 camels for Medina, mentioned on p. 218, has turned back, finding all roads closed. Ibn Rashid, he says, will now try the Qasim road to Koweit.] NOTES. Khurma. Col. Lawrence, lately arrived from Jiddah, sends the following :— “ Ibn Saud began to collect Dhikat (a semi-religious tax) from some sections of the Sbei this year, thus reviving his custom of four or five years ago, Shortly afterwards messengers front the Sherif, demanding the same tax, were imprisoned by Sherif Khalid ibn Elwi in Wadi Khurma, Khalid (a lean fanatical silent man, said to be more capable than his elder brother Naif) was made Emir of Khurma by the Sherif years ago. He was converted to the Nejdean Religion four years ago, and was last year confined in the Sherif’s prison at Mecca, On his release on Abdullah’s intervention, he paid a secret visit to Ibn Saud, an old friend of his father’s. The imprisonment of the Sherifian messengers was an act of war, and Khalid at once collected his followers. Only the converts joined him, and they were a mixed lot of Beni Thor Sbei ; Jithima, Khararis (whose sheikh, Naif, is in prison in Mecca), Shlawa and Hamarza Ateibah ; and many Kahtan. The Kahtan were those formerly in the East, who fled from Ibn Saud over the Ajman affair, and have since been living in the upper reaches of Wadi Dawasir. They are not in any way under Khalid, and have only joined temporarily, for the Religion’s sake. Khalid began by expelling the other Sbei, and all the villagers and freedmen, from.Wadi Khurma, into the main valley Truba, of which it is a tributary. Wadi Truba (Tharba or Tarabat) runs south-west into a cultivated plain in Jebel Areysh, of the Goz aba el-Air (Joz Belair) district. Khalid proposed to instal converted peasants in the palm-gardens in their place. His brother, Naif, then waylaid and killed four Ageyl, two Ateibah, and four women, Sunnis from Mecca on their way to Khurma for the summer. They refused to be converted, but nevertheless Khalid protested against their slaughter.— 246 — The Sherif now sent against them a very ragged force, comprising Hamarja, Biyasha, Sbei, Mowalid, Hedhlan (Hudheil) and other Meccan sweepings, with two brass saluting guns and two automatic rifles, under the incompetent Sherif Ali, brother of Shakir ibn Zeid. They were surprised by night on Bir Goreish by an inferior force of Kahtan, and fled without resistance, losing fourteen killed, and their artillery. Khalid then repented of his action, and went off to Ibn Saud with fifty-four riders and his trophies, to beg for help. On his way he crossed an Ateibah raiding party, under Fajir ibn Shelawih, on its way to Dawasir. The two parties fought, and Ibn Shelaiwh took thirteen camels, four horses and the artillery, killing four of the converted, and losing only one himself. Khalid fled towards Riadh. The Kahtan are not likely to remain long in Wadi Khurma, and Naif ibn Elwi cannot hope, with only the Beni Thor, to keep the other Sbei indefinitely out of their properties. If Khalid fails in his mission in Aridh, the complete collapse of his movement may be expected. The Sherif hopes to enrol a new force in Mecca to retake Khurma, but is trying to conscript the town Bedouins at half wages, and in consequence has made no progress.' Should he make further attacks upon Khurma, with the materials at his disposal, he may reasonably be expected to suffer further reverses. If, however, he acquires wisdom enough to accept the temporary loss of the district, and if Ibn Saud maintains his present correct attitude, then no extension —or prolongation—of the rising need be feared.” At rash Family. The Turks are reported to be courting the Hauran Druses assiduously through the Atrash sheikhs. One of the latter, escorted by 200 horsemen, was at Damascus early in May, and was entertained at a great dinner in a hotel. The festivity was marred by the collapse of a balcony which resulted in nine deaths. According to the Journal de Beirut of May 11, the Ottoman Government has offered the following decorations to members of the family. To Sheikhs Nesm, Mutidh and Faraz, the Osmaniyeh 2nd class : to Sheikhs Nesib, Mustapha and Abdul Ghaffar, the Mejidieh, 2nd class. We should conjecture that the first three names represent the section of the Atrash which actually presented itself at Damascus : the other three sheikhs, vvho represent the ruling houses of Suweida, Salkhad and Umm Roman, have long been pro-Sherif, and their decorations, no doubt, are bread cast upon the waters by the Turks, rather than rewards whose acceptance was assured. Libya. rr . ^ } Limoured that Nuri (see p. 222) has come back to 1 ripolitania, and will supersede once more Ishaak Pasha, whohas failed to reconcile Seyyid Ahmed and Ramadan Shitevvi. The latter is said to have had the former’s messenger to the Tarhnna killed some time ago, and his despatches taken ; after which there was a certain amount of skirmishing between patrols of the two rivals. The Turks try to stand in with, and supply, each impartially with money and munitions. Their faction is reported to have prevailed in the Sokhna Oasis, and the Sheikh of the Awlad Suleiman, with 700 men, has gone over to Seyyid Mohammed Idris and is now at Merduma. Abdul Jebil is encamped near Jedabia, in the capacity of an officer of Idris’ army. Sherif el-Gariani commands Idris’ out post line with his H.Q. at Maatan bu Jidaria, north of Menshi. A British officer, who knew Nuri in Tripoli in 1911, thus describes him : “ This half-brother of Enver is now about 28 or 29 years of age.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.249 FEISAL’S ARMY IN JUNE. Colonel Joyce has less to report for June than he had for May, intermittent fever among the regular troops (400 cases) and shortage of munitions having limited operations. The abortive attack on Jurf timed for June 9 (see p. 206) is related in more detail. It appears that on that day five planes bombed the defences effectively, but the Arab army was not in position and could not follow up the attack. Next day three planes again bombed the station and Sherifian and French guns co operated ; but again no attack followed, the regulars and the Bedouins not working together. Altogether the affair ended in a futile long-range bombardment, and Colonel Joyce lays the fault at the door of Nuri Bey. The rushing of Turkish posts on the 12th (not the 14th as on p. 206) was not the sole work of the Bo walla, for two companies of regulars with two French guns were engaged. On June 18. four Turkish planes bombed Nuri Shaalan’s camp at Azrak, inflicting several casualties among men and animals. As a result the camp has been moved to Kasr el-Amra and Nuri’s Sherifian tendencies have notably stiffened. About the affair of June 22 near el-Hasa, related on p. 228, Colonel Joyce adds nothing material. He mentions the armoured car reconnaissance to Jafar and Bair (see p. 246) and the Kalaat el-Ahmar affair ; but up to the date of his despatch he had not received details of the latter. We can add one or two facts to those already published concerning operations. By comparison of the original strength of the Mudowara garrison with the numbers captured by the Howeitat—fifty of all ranks—and the number who died on the march—ten—we deduce that nine men of the captured lot must have been soldiers from Maan, who had brought out a relief convoy. Two officers were among the captives. The air bombardment of Kerak, mentioned on p. 243, is reported to have wrought great havoc, causing between eighty and one hundred casualties in the Citadel, and a machine gun and one mountain gun were destroyed by direct hits. ARAB RECRUITING AT JERUSALEM. A Dinner was given by the Arab Recruiting Committee of the Emir Feisal at the Grand New Hotel, Jerusalem, on July 4. e* Two hundred notables were present, including the Military Governor of Jerusalem, the Mufti of the Hanafites and the Mufti of the Shalltes, Major Haddad Bey, Lieut, the Hon. E. Feilding, Capt. Machray, and other officers. Lieut. Adib Effendi Wahbi, Head of the Arab Recruiting Committee, thanked his audience for their presence. He sketched250 — in brief detail the Arab Movement. Next, he read a message from Emir Feisal, in which he recounted the glories of the Arab Cause and the successes of the Arab Army. He concluded with a warm tribute of thanks to King George and Great Britain and urged* every able man to join the Army of the Grand Sherif. Sheikh Ali, the Poet, spoke extempore. He stated that an individual was worse than useless, unless a member of, a strong, united community. The particular community at the moment was the Arab Army ; therefore he advocated most strongly that all who could, should join. He ended with a graceful tribute to the British Allies of the Arab Nation. Ibrahim, the Priest, drew a comparison between the condition and life of the Arabs under the Turks and as they now stand under the British Government. He mentioned the Turks’ atrocities, their pillaging, murdering, leaving all to starve, compelling all to join the army, pushing them into the line of lire, like animals, not giving them a sufficiency of food or clothing. Not so the British Government, which forces no one to join the army against his will : it is self-supporting and does not call upon the people to provide it with any food. Nay, rather, it provides lood and drink for the needy, and dispenses justice and equity in its administration. He then touched lightly upon the fact that the British Government was the first to bring a full and good supply of water to the Holy City. He ended by entreating all to strain every nerve to liberate their country and, by immediate and concerted action, to accomplish this by bringing recruits in their thousands to the banner of the Emir Feisal. Hassan Effendi abu Sut urged them to seize the present opportunity and live up to the glorious traditions of their ancestors. Said Effendi spoke at some length. He said that the Arab Cause was a sacred one ; that the present struggle was one of the Arabs striving to free themselves from their Turkish oppressors. He said that the Turks put forward their warriors as being- greater than the Caliphs, and wished to change the language of the Koran into Turkish instead of Arabic—facts which loosen the religious tie which once bound the Turks to the Arabs. Then he thanked God that there were nations which stand up for justice, namely the English, who are helping the Arab Nation to-day. He then appealed to the people with passionate elocpience and urged them to avenge themselves on the Turks, who rob them and ravage their woman. He implored them to help the enlistment for the Arab Army and volunteered there and then to enlist himself, if someone would care for his dependants. Mahmoud Yazim el-Beis began his speech by saying that his predecessor had mentioned the word a Revenge ”. There were good Turks as well as bad Turks. The Arab Nation’s bounden duty was not only to avenge itself for the evil perpetrated by the Turks, but also to show itself a constructive nation, ableto keep itself, and shame the inept and destructive Turkish regime. Yusuf Effendi Yeysh el-Lazki.—This man walked straight into the Hall, saluted the picture and banner of the Grand Sherif Husein Ali, after which he made a stirring speech'. As a volunteer himself he had shown that he was ready to shed his blood for the cause. He pointed out that the mere presence of so many notables, and especially of the Mufti of the Hanafites, and of the Shafites as well, proved the sacredness of the Arab cause. The Military Governor of Jerusalem thanked the former speakers for their testimony and tributes to our noble King George V and his Allies, and paid the same to Husein Ali, King of the Hejaz. He proclaimed that the Arab Movement would bring back the ancient lustre of past Arab greatness. He then touched upon the excellent performance of Shakespeare’s “ Hamlet” given for the Arab volunteers by the Muktataf ed- Darus, and quoted the famous epigram “ To be or not to be, that is the question ”. He applied this saying to the Arab Nation, and said that the Arab Nation will become great or remain lowly in proportion to her efforts during the present opportunity. He expressed his sympathies with the Arab Movement and said that Great Britain was the avowed ally of the Arabs. He brought his speech to a close by paying a glowing tribute to Husein ibn Ali, King of the Hejaz, whereat there was prolonged applause. THE TRUGIAL COAST. Dr. P. W. Harrison of the Arabian Mission, Bahrein, whose accounts of visits to Qatif and Riyadh have been published in former issues (Nos. 58, p. 329 and 70, p. 462), has now been to the Trucial Coast, and has reported under date April 27, 1918, to our Political Agent at Bahrein, on his return from Abu Dhabi, where he was the guest of Sheikh Hamdan. “ I spent nearly a month in that town, treating not only Sheikh Hamdan himself for a chronic ailment, but also the townspeople, in considerable numbers. The sheikh himself was not markedly benefited; but he was exceedingly grateful for the attention shown, and for the work among the people of the place. A considerable number of operations were performed besides the medical work. “At the request of Sheikh Rashid of Umm el-Qaiwein, I spent some ten days there, primarily for the purpose of perform ing a slight operation upon the sheikh himself. This was a simple matter, and quite successful. During the ten days of my stay, the local people were treated both medically and surgically, as opportunity offered, and they seemed to appreciate252 the service very much indeed. As a part of this trip, I also spent two days in Ras el-Kheunah. This was at the personal solicitation of'Sheikh Sultan, the younger son of Sheikh Salim, who is hopelessly paralyzed from an apoplectic stroke dating some three months back. The service rendered was little more than examination and diagnosis, but I was able also to repair the hare lip of the younger son, Sheikh Sultan, a service which he appeared to appreciate greatly. The brevity of my stay made any considerable work among the people quite impossible. A few were seen, however, and the utmost cordialit} 7 was manifested everywhere. “The trip was terminated by a stay of a week to ten days in Dubai, at the invitation of Sheikh 'Said ibn Maqtum. The people were exceedingly cordial, and it was possible to give the sheikh the medical advice he desired, and also to do a certain amount among the people. Much more might have been done, if the available stock of medicines had been adequate. “ The need for medical services was everywhere extreme, and such services are greatly appreciated. I was even asked by some of the leading men of Sharjah, whether a petition to the proper parties might secure the permanent establishment of medical work in that district. “ As to the political situation, it is obvious that by far the strongest sheikh in that region is Hamdan of Abu Dhabi. This is universally recognized by the Arabs themselves, and it remains to be added, that not only is he the strongest in point of inherited power, but in his own personal qualities as a ruler, he is quite in a class by himself. He is sincerely and strongly loyal to the British Government, to such a degree indeed, that probably the most potent motive, that could be brought to bear upon him, would be the possibility of some special recognition or decoration from that Government. Sheikh Rashid of Umm el-Qaiwein is a much less admirable type, though still a good sheikh as Arab rulers go. He is a man of large wealth, and his principal interest appears to consist in preserving and increasing it. It is perhaps safe to say that the most effective motive in influencing him would lie in that direction. Sheikh Said of Dubai, is a very affable and democratic-mannered man, reckoned among the Arabs, and correctly so, as a weak ruler, having very little comprehension of the world outside, and fearful of any increase of British power or influence in his territory. He is without doubt the weakest of the sheikhs that we met on the trip ; and at the same time the least intelligent, and most prejudiced against all progress. The young Sheikh Mohammed of Ras-el-Kheimah, who is assuming the duties that Salim, his father, can no longer perform, promises exceedingly well. He is unusually intelligent, and apparently genuinely interested in the progress of the people under him. “ On the surface nothing is met with but the most cordial loyalty to the British Government. But it is not difficult to see that, underneath, this loyalty is considerably tempered. In thefirst place the increase of British power is feared, because it is felt that its ascendency means the disappearance of slavery. This feeling, however, is confined chiefly to the small upper class that is rich enough to own slaves. The ordinary Arab would be little disturbed by the disappearance of slavery, unless interested leaders stirred things up. There is also a wide-spread fear that the advent of the British would result in women’s freedom from the domination of men to a very dangerous degree. I was not able satisfactorily to investigate the origin of this surprising feeling. u On the other hand the people, from the poorest to the richest, have come ro realize very keenly their economic dependence on the British power, and when the shortage of tonnage made it necessary to eat Karachi rice, the German Kaiser was most warmly cursed by all classes. There is perhaps no section that prizes the visits of the steamers more than Oman has learned to do, and which realizes more adequately its dependence on the Bombay markets both in selling pearls and in buying rice. It is not too much to say that as far as self- interest makes an Oriental loyal, the Oman people are thoroughly loyal, and that the feeling about the slaves is a very small thing in comparison of their thorough-going conviction of British power, and of their own dependence upon it.” ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. The Howeitat party, sent south to Mudowara (see p. 243), arrived there on July 4 and has now returned, reporting that it found the station and all positions reoccupied in strength. It did not, therefore, attack. There have been small affairs near Fareifra on July 4, and near Maan on July 5. In the first a Turkish reconnoitring party on its way towards Wadi Hasa was engaged by Sherif KTasir’s troops and driven back with a loss of six killed, the Arabs having three wounded. In the second, an enemy cavalry patrol of five men was captured with its animals. Maan, according to a deserter, was short of petrol at the beginning of the month and almost out of aeroplane bombs. It has, however, only one plane available, and that patched up. It says a good deal for its pilot, Fehmi, that he flies at all. The O.C. Maan is evidently beginning to turn out the civil population of the town, which is both a drain on his supplies and a potential danger to his defence. Three hundred have come in to Zeid’s headquarters at Uheida—not a particularly gratifying accession to Feisal, who probably can make little use of the menwhile he has to feed the women and children. Since then thirty- five more have reached Cheida. At the same time unfit soldiers, to the number of thirty officers and 200 other ranks, have been evacuated northwards from Maan. Nawwaf Shaalan has left Ziza, after some dispute with the Turks, and has joined his father, Nuri, at Kasr el-Amra. Thence both the chiefs have been sending proposals for immediate co operation to Feisal. Nuri says he dare not go to the Hauran as usual for corn, for fear of coming within reach of the Turks. Southern Area. Over fifty prisoners were taken in this area during June. The following statement of the actual strength of the 53rd enemy division, under Acting O.C., Tahsin Bey, with headquarters at el-Ula and area extending from Toweira to Muadhdham, has been compiled by Bimbashi Bright from P. of W. information : — l/178th Regt. ...

Northern Area .—Kutrani station and camps were bombed on July 15 by our Air Force, and subjected to very heavy machine-gun fire. Several direct hits were observed, one upon a train full of troops. Two days previously, our planes observed and attacked a large drove of unladen camels proceeding south near Kissir station and followed at some distance by a body of enemy (Circassian ? ) cavalry about 400 strong. No trace of this convoy has been seen since, and it is thought it was proceeding to Madeba district to bring back corn. General .—Teima (see p. 244) is to be supplied by Sherif Sharaf on Feisal’s order. Wejh has the necessary supplies, but has to wait for camels.]NOTES. Ibn Sand's Mobilization. A telegram from Mr. Philby at Riyadh, under date June 25, informs us that Ibn Saud, has gathered under his son, Turki, a strong raiding force to attack the Shammar. It is drawn from the Dhruma, Wadi Hanifa, Kharj and Sedeir districts, but it also includes a large Akhwan contingent from Ghat-Ghat and another place (name lost in transmission), perhaps Artawiyah. Ibn Sand himself proposed to take the command early in the current month and Mr. Philby was to accompany him. Turki estimates his total muster at 10,000 men: but Mr. Philby suggests the half of this figure as probably about the truth. We hope the presence of Mr. Philby will help to keep a force, containing so considerable an element of fanatics, within bounds, more especially as its activities will coincide more or less with the moving of pilgrims towards Mecca. With Turkish propa ganda as active as it is in the peninsula, the gathering less than two months hence will not be free from danger and anxiety for King Husein : and although we do not credit the story, which comes to us from Yemen, that a Zeidi force is to go up in pilgrim guise with hostile intent, it is far from unlikely that both Yemeni and Yejdi pilgrims will give trouble. Incidentally Mr. Philby’s message shows that he has returned in safety from his Dawasir expedition (see p. 227). [Since the above has been in type, a letter has arrived from Mr. Philby from Riyadh, under date May 5, which reassures us about Ibn Saud’s intentions at anyrate. Being short of money, he is going out against the Shammar, in uncertain hope of bringing about the fall of Hail by cutting its communications. Should he succeed, he looks for pecuniary reward from us. Turki is to operate from Qasim. The whole plan has been cut and dried, evidently, for the last two months. Abdah Shammar sheikhs have been sending messengers to Ibn Saud to beg supplies : but Majid ibn Ajil, Aqab’s brother, was told roundly that, while Shammar were welcome to settle temporarily in Hasa as Ibn Saud’s guests, any of the tribe found between Ibn Saud and Hail would be treated as enemies. Mr. Philby thinks business is meant this time.] Tdrisi Affairs. The Yam mercenaries (see p. 228) duly returned home about May 21, their contract with Idrisi having then expired : but it is reported that some of their ulema, who went on ahead, were captured by the Turks. Idrisi is said to be trying again to recruit Hashid and Bekil tribesmen, while a Zeidi force under the Abu Ras sheikh is reported to be on its way to co-operate with him. If this last news is true, it indicates that no satisfactory result of the Abu Ras murder trial (see pp. 7, 18, etc.) was ever arrived at.256 — Turkish Officers in Nejd. Mr. Philby writes under date, May 5 :— “We (or rather Ibn Sand) captured a Turkish officer a few days ago. Unfortunately he was only travelling on transfer and with, presumably, verbal reports, as the letters he carried were mostly private ones and of little interest. He actually passed through Riyadh in the disguise of a Darwish, but news of him came in time to allow of his capture before he slipped away. Another officer, however, appears to have got through some weeks ago, unless his bones are bleaching on the desert, as our prisoner’s letters mention his departure from Ibha via Riyadh to Medina.” Supplies from Qasmi. Mr. Philby writes under date, May 5 :— “ Ibn Saud has recently received letters from Ajaimi, Fahad el-Dughaim and Mohammed ibn Turki ibn Mijlad asking him to let them get supplies from the Qasim—at any rate indirect evidence that they are not already doing so. Personally I believe the leakage from the Qasim is trifling, and Ibn Saud has recently dismissed the Emir of Zilfi from his post for complicity in the business—his letter announcing the dismissal was one of the curtest and outspoken documents I have ever seen—‘ From Abdul Aziz ibn Saud to Uthaimin (contemptuous diminutive of Uthmau ! ) God has not endowed thee with grace and your low tricks have come to my hearing.

The following notes are taken from a report furnished by the Commander-in-Chief of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, as a result of information obtained through the capture of Lieut. Preusser in March last {.see Bulletin No. 92, p. 194) and otherwise. The enemy Intelligence Service on the Euphrates consisted of two distinct organisations, viz :— 1. The Muntefiq Mission, known as Missmont. 2. The Euphrates Group Intelligence Organisation. Captain Andrae {see p. 194), the officer in charge of tribal affairs on the Headquarters Staff of the Yilderim Army group, dealt with all matters affecting tribes, while actual contact with them was maintained through organisations called Liaison Groups. 1. The Muntefiq Mission left Aleppo on August 30, 1917, reaching Hit on September 24. Its leader was Dr. Conrad Preusser {see p. 194), an orientalist and archaeologist of repute, wffio had as subordinates a Turkish Gendarmerie officer by name Yusuf Effendi, and a Corporal, afterwards Vice-Sergeant-Major Langenegger. The latter was an Arabic scholar and a Doctor of Science. The military rank of the personnel in the German Intelligence Service is no indication of the ability or social standing of the individual. (Low rank, however, is a distinct handicap with tribal Arabs.) Preusser and Langenegger were the only Europeans with Missmont. It was, however, the intention to add several others for active operations in conjunction with Ajeimi against the British lines of communication. The Europeans collected and compiled topographical information ; but all other Intelligence was obtained by Arab spies, especially sheikhs, priests and other notables, whom Missmont assiduously cultivated. At important centres there were a number of spies who were forbidden to leave their.posts, while special N.C.O. and officer spies, generally Arabs, made periodical journeys behind the British lines. Although they could easily pass themselves off as peaceful inhabitants, and thus gain access to military centres, their information was often misleading. Missmont busied itself with the dissemination of propaganda to incite the tribes against us, and to get them to undertake active operations against our lines of communication. To this end hundreds of rifles were issued to Arab sheikhs, and money was spent lavishly. Preusser, who was intimately associated with Ajeimi, spared no expense in fostering the Nejef rebellion. In four months he paid Ajeimi L.T. 6,100, besides affording arms and equipment for a force of 1,200 horsemen and camel-riders. Preusser himself intended to accompany Ajeimi in a great raid against the Nasiriyah railway and the Euphrates lines of communication below Kerbela. However, our victory at Ramadi on September 29 last, broke both the power of Ajeimi and the influence of the Germans.— 258 — A conference was held at Hit on October G, and henceforth. Ajeimi’s main aim was the extortion of further subsidies from the Germans. Preusser, who was buoyed up by tidings of a Euphrates offensive, was still further discredited when this was abandoned, and the influence of his combination steadily waned. To add to his troubles, the Turks began to place difficulties in the way of direct relations between Germans^ and Arabs. Preusser complained of this passive resistance in a note to Yilderim in February last. The reply was : “The Turkish Ministers of War and of the Interior have demanded the discontinuance of all relations between Germans and Arabs : hence the resistance. Do not initiate any further undertakings for the present.” There could be only one logical result, and on March 5 the blow fell. Yilderim decreed the dissolution of Missmont in view of the Turkish objections referred to. The Mission was therefore wound up ; Arab affairs was taken over by the V ith Army, and Preusser was on the point of leaving Mesopotamia when he was captured at Haditha on March 27 with part of his records. 2. The Euphrates Group was a distinct organisation, run on different lines and with a different aim. Its main function was political, and though it served the immediate object of inciting the tribes against us, it pursued always its aim of “ peaceful penetration ” and the furtherance o£ German influence and prestige. Inasmuch as it was essentially a military institution, it naturally overlapped Missmont, and there seems to have been some friction between the two organisations. Contrary to Missmont’s practice, this group paid its agents badly, and useful sheikhs received only doles, while the Euphrates group looked on Missmont as spendthrifts who “ queered their pitch.” This group apparently was not stinted in any way, and its more niggardly poliey seems to have been due to the parsimony of its leader, Captain Rohde of the German General Staff. He is said to have been an exceptionally able man, the life and soul of the 50th Division. He did a great deal besides Intelligence work, and was practically C.G.S. to the Divisional Commander. He was an expert Turkish scholar, who had served with the Turks in the Tripoli and Balkan campaigns. He fell ill before our attack on Khan Baghdadi and was invalided to Aleppo on March 20. His first assistant was Vice-Sergeant-Major Boyes, a man of English extraction whose famity had lived in Germany for several generations. He had been in the German Navy and lived in India for nineteen years. He was sent to the Euphrates to examine Indian prisoners of war and to get in touch with Indian troops in our lines. He spoke English and Hindustani, and had received special instruction at the Dolmetscherschule in Berlin, where linguists are taught the military organisation and military phraseology of the armies against which they are to be employed. His second assistantwas Corporal (jrebhardt, a highly educated man of good family, who spoke several languages well. He was formerly on von der Goltz’s staff, and in 1916 was trained for six months in Intelligence work under the German military attache in Constantinople. In September he arrived in Baghdad and was employed in travelling up and down the river, collecting economic information of all kinds. He apparently co-operated with purchase officers, supplying them with information, though he did not purchase himself. Under Rohde’s supervision he worked out a scheme for supplementing from local resources the food supplies required for the army, which was to carry out the contemplated offensive against Baghdad last winter. ARMENIANS IN SYRIA AND TURKEY. An intelligent and trustworthy Armenian gives the following account of his escape from Damascus to Akaba and of what he saw and learned of the internal troubles of the Turks :— Itinerary. A party of forty Armenians left Damascus on April 24 by night, and hid themselves in a village an hour’s journey to the south-east. After travelling for twenty-four hours they reached Suweida in the heart of the Jebel Druz, where they spent two days resting after their hurried flight. Mugheir, a village south west of Jebel Hauran, was reached in twelve hours, and here they hired a Druse with six camels. Disguised as Bedouins, the fugitives marched southwards, keeping to the railway as long as they dared ; but after four days wandering in the desert, their guide took himself off with his camels. Several days later, they fell in with some nomads from whom they hired a camel, and continued their journey southwards. This time they decided to keep to the railway, which they crossed between Aneza and Jurf ed-Derwish. Still trending westward, they entered a valley, and after an hour’s march, as night was falling, they were fired on by Turks from the direction of Maan. They had no casualties, and at once retraced their steps for some distance, and then turned southwards. Only eleven days after they had left Damascus, they fell in with a troop of camel-mounted infantry, who, to their great relief, proved to be Sherifians. These showed them true Arab hospitality, and gave them food and ammunition to enable them to reach Akaba.— 2(50 — Report. On the night of February 5, 1918, the walls of the Gover- norate and all public buildings at Damascus were placarded with the following proclamation :— To the Turkish Government. Why do jmu not open your eyes ? You must not follow in the footsteps of Germany. Germany’s policy and her Government’s attitude towards her subjects, are contrary to the principles of Islam. To Enver, Talaat and Jemal. You, who have co-operated with Germany, have ruined, devastated and outraged the country. You have behaved most cruelly towards your nation and the whole responsi bility falls upon you and your Government. This is the first warning that has been given you : should you not change your policy, serious consequences will result. Several innocent Arabs, undergoing imprisonment for desertion, were hanged on the charge of having been accomplices in the above incident. A further indication of the hatred felt for the Germans in Damascus was seen the day the news arrived that the British had occupied es-Salt. The Arab mob plundered a number of wagons loaded vsith wheat destined for Germany. In the outlying villages feeling runs high. In April a number of peasants revolted, and the Turks being unable to cope with them, were finally compelled to send for artillery to reduce them. Thereupon the insurgents took to the mountains. In'Turkey itself insurrection is rife. In the Alexandretta- Toprak Kaleh-Keller district au Armenian band commanded by one Topal Hagop is abroad, and to him deserters from the army resort. Another band, 400 strong, operates between Gurun, Malatia and Aintab, its leader being Bozan Pasha, an Armenian from Malatia. In the Zeitun mountains, Armenian deserters from Zeitun, Albistan and Ala Dagh have formed themselves into bands of raiders ; while in the vilayet of Adana yet another small band of Turks under a notable of Payas, one Papanun I and killing the Ogl u M i istafa, is harassing the Government gendarmerie in the mountains round Payas. The escape of this party of forty men from Damascus into the Druse country and along many miles of the Maan-Damascus railway, shows what little assistance the Turks can count on in Syria, and the lamentable state of their communications. No difficulty was experienced in purchasing German and British rifles and ammunition from the Druses,—a fact which confirms an earlier report of the sale of large numbers of rifles in Jebel Druz by the Germans. I— £61 — ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. Desei teis report that the water reserve at Jvalaat Aneza is exhausted, that the only supply is brought by trolley, and that the well at Jurf ed-Derwish has all but given out. This shortage must seriously embarrass the I urks, who are trying to repair the line between these two stations with rails taken from the Aneza- Jerdun sector. It may also account‘for the comparatively large number of deserters who have come in—thirty-seven in two days, of whom twenty-two were Turks. An explosion was heard from the direction of liutrani on duty 14. At first, owing to the great intervening distance, nothing was visible, but an hour later smoke was seen. Southern Area. Sherif Sheraf reports that, on July 5, he damaged 500 rails and a culvert of twenty-five arches between Khishm es-Sana and Dar el-Hamra, and attacked a post between the latter station and Matali, damaging 1,000 rails. Most welcome proof of Sherifian vigilance on the Medina- Hail road has appeared. Sherif Abdullah reports that, about July 10, Arab forces surprised a detachment of fifty Turkish cavalry and some infantry under the command of Abdul Hamid Bey el-Masri, lately IVth Army delegate with Ibn Rashid, bound from Medina to Hail. The encounter was a most successful one, the entire party of Turks being either killed or captured. Among the slain was Abdul Hamid el-Masri. It is reported that important papers were captured, and we wait with impatience details of Fakhri’s message to Ibn Rashid. The statement of the prisoners that Fakhri is sending three taburs from Medina to Hail lacks confirmation. r General. Since the position was last reviewed (see p. 245) the King has taken action to assert his authority and recover his lost prestige in the Khurma district. On July 15 it was reported from Wejh that Sherif Shakir had been despatched from Wadi Ais at the head of 800 men, with four guns and six machine guns, and on the same day Yambo reported that ammunition and supplies for 1,000 men for one month had left that place for Shakir at Bir Derwish by Emir Abdullah’s order. The latest report gives Shefa as Shakir’s destination. Shefa is a desert escarpment of uncertain size lying across the Mecca-Boreida road some 250 to 300 miles from the former place. If the report is to be credited, Shakir’s intention, apparently, is to intercept any reinforcements coming from Qasim. An advance party of— 262 wm Wahabis, said to number 4,000, is reported to be at Ghat-Ghat and Dukhna, about four days east of Taif in the Wadi iurba district, under Ivhalid. There is reason to believe that this news is old and refers to Ibn Baud’s mobilization against the Shammar (see p. 255). Khalid’s nephew is said to have been killed in an encounter, and Ins followers routed (the affair reported on p. 246 ?). Colonel Wilson has asked King Husein the extent and object of Shakir’s expedition. The King says that Shakir, as Emir of the Ateibah, would re-occupy Khurma, but that he would not be provided with guns or machine guns. He feels keenly the blow to his prestige and amour-propre, and is bent on taking vengeance on Khalid. [ Late News .—The ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to be held on July 24, has been the subject of a cordial exchange of messages between Dr. Weizmann and Emir Feisal. The latter writes regretting that he will be unable to leave his headquarters to attend the ceremony to which Dr. Weizmann has replied, “I trust we may rely on your sympathy in the establishment of an institution which is designed to promote progress and education for the benefit of all communities alike”.] NOTES. Idrisis Situation. Reports written by Lieut.-Colonel A. M. Houston on July 3, after his return to Kamaran (see p. 221), and by Captain Nasreddin Ahmed, on July 2, tell us how the situation developed after the evacuation of Loheiya (see p. 240). Abu Halik held out till June 29, but fell as soon as the Turks attacked it in earnest. It’s fall was precipitated by a stampede of the Beni Jami on the Idrissian right wing, which let the Turks in on the flank of the Mikhlaf el-Yemen plainsmen in the centre. These broke on receiving a cross fire, and the hillmen on the left, who had been making good progress, had to fall back again. Captain Nasreddin seems to think the Beni Jami were loyal and that the fault lay with Idrisi’s Commandant who left them unsupported. Idrisi’s paid troops retired northwards on Buheis and Habl. Not only the army, but the Arabs of Idrisi’s immediate following seem completely demoralised, and their ill temper finds vent in blaming their chief for having called in British advisers. In consequence, Idrisi showed himself very anxious to be rid of the latter, for a time at any rate, and speeded his parting guests by all means in his power. He seemed hardly less anxious to send off Seyyid Mustafa to Jeizan. Idrisi, who said he would— 263 — resume the struggle after Bairam and continue for ten years if necessary, with or without our help, has preferred requests for sea-planes (on the usual “ moral-effect” plea) and for Italian ammunition to supply the eastern tribes (Aslam, Nashar, etc.) who, having an Italian rifle, but little ammunition, remained, he alleges, perforce inactive while the Turks were concentrating on the Loheiya front. Idrisi’s prestige is fallen very low at present, and he does not look like retrieving his defeat. Tribes of Sinai and Palestine. The Arab Bureau, Cairo, has in preparation, and partly in the press, a compendium of the Arab tribes of Sinai and Palestine, the latter to include the trans-Jordan lands up to the edge of the Syrian desert. It will thus comprise the tribal elements of the Sinai Peninsula, the Tih, and the Negeb, none of which comes into the Admiralty Handbook of Arabia, while all are usually omitted from Handbooks of either Egypt or Syria. It is time to rescue these tribes and their chiefs from this “ two- stools” position ! Further it is proposed to deal with the tribes of the Gaza-Jaffa district on the one side and the Hebron- Jerusalem district on the other, with those of the Ghor up to lake Tiberias, and as far as possible with the other small nomadic groups occasionally found in Samaria and Galilee. Finally it is to include the important tribal elements of the trans-Jordan districts from Maan in the south up to, at any rate, the Yarmuk in the north. Should it prove possible to obtain fresh and reliable information on the Jaulan-Lija tribes, such as the Fadl and the Naim, the Oasis of Damascus will be the northern limit. On the east, it is desired to exclude the great tribes of the Hamad proper and to limit the treatment to those tribes only which habitually come into, or have permanent holdings in, the arable area. Thus the Beni Sakhr will be included, while the Rowalla will not. The Jebeliyah, on which there is a little new informa tion, will probably be taken in, but not the Wuld Ali, because, though groups habitually tent in the Jaulan, the main body of the tribe remains out in the Hamad and for the most part ranges north of the proposed limit. Also it is part of the Anazeh and had better be considered in connection with the other tribes of that great aggregate, who lie outside the purview of the present compendium. Lieut.-Colonel A. C. Parker, Military Governor of Sinai, has very kindly undertaken the revision of the tribes of his region, working over a draft originally compiled from recent reports of the Frontier Districts Administration and the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. Lieut.-Colonel T. E. Lawrence will revise, with the help of his Bedouin bodyguard, the account of the Howeitat and other south-eastern tribes. The Kerak, Belkaa, Salt, Ajlun and Ghor groups, including the Beni Sakhr, have been re-done in Jerusalem by Lieut. J. P. K. Groves from careful comparison of refugee information, with help from British political agents actually in the trans-Jordan lands. It has proved possible264 — and necessary to amend very materially the earlier Handbook information which was based chiefly on Janssen. At the same centre some fresh information has been obtained about tribes further north and east, but it is less reliable and less detailed. Curiously enough, the tribes of Western Palestine itself, such as those of the Hebron district, and the nomadized fellahm who tent between Bir Saba and Jaffa, have caused the most difficulty and delay to the compiler. We hope, however, to have surmounted all obstacles in a few weeks and to produce an authoritative instalment of that complete compendium of West Asian tribal units which is much to be desired. Baghdad has already done great service, and lately has added to all it has produced on Irak, a much needed account of the Southern Kurds. Survey on the Hejaz Railway. The work of a Survey party, sent to the Hejaz Railway, was mentioned on p. 229. Captain Bamford, its leader, has now returned and is working out the results. Unfortunately, owing to difficulties of transport and some failure on the part of local authorities to appreciate the necessity for making special arrange ments, the party did not get farther south than Tell Shahm, and had to confine the rest of its work to the region of which that station, Maan and Gueira are three angles. An effort is being made to resume the work with the special intention of procuring an accurate determination of Tebuk, or of some kilometre point as near it as may be. What Captain Bamford and his assistants, however, have succeeded in doing is of great importance and very revolutionary. It is not so much that Maan will have to be moved about four miles south-east on our maps, as that fell Shahm is a great deal further out of place, and that when this is moved, the line of the railway, as now determined between those two points over a sector of about fifty miles, looks like falling very seriously west of its accepted position in the southern sectors, unless it makes some unsuspected deflection to eastward before or after Tebuk. In connection with this it may be observed that a careful independent sketch of the railway between el-Ula and Medina, with the country west of it, which Major Davenport and Lieutenant Gar rood have based on many traverses, does actually transfer the line a good deal to the west of its position on the Wejh sheet (1 : 500,000), and, with it, the position of Medina itself ! This may well be, for it is more than probable that such longitude observations, as have ever been taken in the Holy City, leave much to be desired. Between the ten or a dozen points astronomically fixed by Captain Bamford, a number of traverses and shots will enable a much more reliable sketch map to be compiled than has been possible hitherto: and pending his reports, all work at the Survey of Egypt upon the revision of the Maan and Wejh 1:500,000 maps has been suspended. The Royal Geographical Society will be well advised to go equallv slow with the production of its 1:1,000,000 sheets of Arabia.* Abdul Hamid diey. 1 he rule d.e morbus does not hold in war, and perhaps never held east of Suez ; so we may say candidly that Abdul Hamid Bey, called “ el-Masri,” whose death is reported above (p. 261 is no loss. We first became aware of this Egyptian in Arabia as Ottoman representative at Hail in the earlier part of 1917. He seems to have left there for Mustajiddah after a quarrel with Rashid ibn Leilah, but he accompanied that individual and his master, Ibn Rashid, to the railway in August and remained, as delegate ot Jemal “the Great” and the IVth Army, charged to see to the Emir’s interests and needs, and pass on to him cash and supplies sent from Damascus. Their mutual relations, however, were quickly strained—so much so that Abdul Hamid’s recall was asked for at one time by the H.E.F. But Jemal insisted on his remaining at his post, and he developed into, virtually, the Emir’s jailor at el-Hejr, their relations going from bad to worse, owing to the refusal of the Turks to pav the Hail mujahidin (see p. 174). What the Emir thought of the delegate’s role in regard to himself may be seen from his captured correspondence (p. 214). On Ibn Rashid’s departure—or flight—Abdul Hamid went at once to Medina (p. 244), having been ordered to rejoin the fugitive without delay and resume his old position at Hail. There is no indication that Ibn Rashid connived at his disaster on the road, but it is hardty likely that he will regret the non arrival of his former jailor, supported by Ottoman troops ! Abdul Hamid has been reported to us (by an officer deserter from Medain Salih last February) to be a man of about thirty- five, tall, with yellow skin and black beard, commonly believed to have “deserted” from Egypt late in 1914. From another good source we learn that he was once a follower and agent of Sheikh Abdul Aziz Shawish. It is possible that he is identical with Abdul Hamid Seyyid, a lawyer, lieencie-en-droit of Paris, of a well-known and wealthy Gharbiya family, who left Egypt with Ismail Kamel in September 1914 to join Mohammed Bey Farid and the ex-Khedive in Constantinople, and was rumoured to have gone into the Turkish Army. He was known in Egypt as an extreme Nationalist, bitterly anti-British and violently pro-Turk, and, while in France in 1910, he tried to organise a demonstration against Mr. Roosevelt on the latter’s return from delivering the famous “Get On or Get Out” speech, against which Sheikh Shawish had already protested so noisily. On the other hand, if “ Masri ” is really his surname, and not a mere descriptive epithet, he is probably an ex-medical student of that cognomen, who left Egypt more than two years ago, and was heard of soon afterwards in the Turkish Secret Service in Switzerland. Since then his where abouts have not been known for certain.Libya. Whether Kmi Pasha has really returned is still in doubt, since a new staff is reported to have arrived from Constantinople and to have taken over from Nuri’s officers. Suleiman Baruni is still at Constantinople : consequently there is a lull in Tripo- litania, and Sheikh Sof ibn Gfuma, of the Mahamid, is at Agarbin, awaiting his return to move on Tripoli town, while Mahdi Sunni of the Zawiya is idle at Misda. Ramadan Shitewi is reported to have made it up at last with Seyyid Ahmed, on being assured that the latter is really the representative of the Ottoman Caliph in Africa, and il a move is made on Homs and Tripoli, he will join with his forces. Mohammed Zwiy is in Kasr Sirt. Fezzan is quiet. Seyyid Mohammed Idris is going backwards and forwards between Jedabia and Suetina, and Safi ed-Din is at Jedabia with a force of 350 men and some guns destined for the outpost line. There seem to be no changes in Idris’ dispositions and very little activity. Ska mi yah Chiefs and King Husein. Mesopotamian Chiefs are continuing to use King Husein as nn intermediarv (see p. 233). Fahad ibn Abd el-Muhsin el- Hadhdhal, Mujhim ibn Muheid (see No. 52, p. 251) and AH ibn Suleiman esh-Sharki have sent representatives to the King, to declare their allegiance. The King is evidently gratified by the implied recognition of his influence, and sees, in these deputations, a response to his general exhortation to the Arab world. The delegates called on Colonel Wilson, and explained that their former alliance with the Turks rested solely on the common ground of Islam.FEISAL’S ARMY IN EARLY JULY. Colonel Joyce’s report, dated duly 13, throws light on the escape of a part of the Mudowara garrison to Maan, and deals with operations in the northern area from July 1 to July 11. From it we learn that the premature return of the motor-gun section and Indian machine-gun detachment from Hallat el- Ammar (see p. 242) was due to faulty transport arrangements. The Arab command had undertaken to send a convoy of rations from Akaba, but failed to do so. Nevertheless, the cars kept the field till the last day’s ration had been consumed. The attack on Hallat el-Ainmar by the Beni Atiyah was carried out with great dash. Without waiting for the ten-pounders to come into action, they rushed the station at dawn, accounting for the entire garrison of sixty-four at a cost of seven killed and eighteen wounded. The following day, arrangements were made to attack Bir Hurmas; but in the afternoon, the Beni Atiyah, against the advice of Captain Scott-Higgins, declared their intention to attack Dhat el-Haj. This plan, however, was also abandoned, owing to shortage of rations, and it was decided to send a part)' to Akaba for supplies and money. The motor-gun section, immobilized during the Bedouins’ abortive discussions, was compelled to return for supplies. Demolitions on the line, which could have been carried out, were not effected. Under the original scheme, it was intended to capture Bir Hurmas, and thus gain possession of the whole section of the line between the two stations, in order to utilise to the utmost the limited supply of explosives. The damage actually effected has already been recorded (see p. 242). The Beni Atiyah are remaining in the el-Ayana district and further developments may be expected in due course. The air-raid on Maan on July 2, deserters report, did great damage to the town, and the casualties among the garrison and townspeople amounted to fifty. A sergeant of the Flying Corps at Maan, who deserted to the Arabs, was heavily fired on by the Turks whilst making his way to Semna, but escaped unhurt. He reports that the supply of bombs is all but exhausted, and that the Turks are endeavouring to substitute mountain-gun shells with bomb actions. The partially repaired bridge, wrecked by the Arabs on July 4 ( see p. 244), is that crossing Wadi Hamman, about six miles north of Jerdun. None of the previous demolitions in this area had been repaired. Deserters are unanimous in testifying to the disappointment of the Maan garrison at the arrival of only three hundred and fifty men as a reinforcement. They had been led to suppose that a force large enough to enable them to repair the line, and even to take the offensive, would be sent; whereas three hundred and fifty men scarcely made good casualties and sick, to say nothing of desertions.The railway line in the Jerdun-Jnrf sector is held by a series of strong posts, each within range of the other. This system necessarily curtails raids on reinforcements and convoys ; the advantage of encirclement or a flank attack on the post is lost, and it is much more difficult to obtain possession of a section of the line for demolition purposes. Thus on July 11, armoured cars, sent out from Abu Lissal, returned with their mission unaccomplished, owing to the presence of these posts and to the inaction of the Arabs, both regulars and Bedouins. The Turkish cavalrymen, captured by an armoured car patrolling south of Maan (see p. 253), state that among a party of five or six men who reached Maan from the south was one of Fakhri’s staff officers, bearing important dispatches from his chief. He came from Medina to Dhat el-Haj by train and thence by march route. One or two Beni Atiyah were bribed to escort the party. ROUTE REPORT: MALBATHA TO KHEIF HUSEIN. The following notes are taken from a report by Captain Clayton, who was instructed to inspect the Darb ei-Hashaim from Malbatha to Yambo. Malbatha is about twelve miles south west of the railway between Abu Naam and Istabl Antar. (The section from Kheif Husein to Yambo has been dealt with in a previous report, see No. 60, p. 353.) “The route from Ain Turaa to Kheif Husein is practicable for motor cars. I doubt if a pick and shovel would be needed the whole way. 1 met a dozen or more hamlas totalling some hundreds of camels, all heavily loaded with grain. My escort said they were Aneza or Huteim, who were going to cross the railway near Seil Matara, though 1 should have thought this was rather far north for the latter. 1 his route is clearly a sort of main road from Yambo to the interior, as there are several well-trodden tracks all the way. It has a weak point as a camel route, and that is lack of water. (Major Davenport believes that water could be obtained by borino.) from Malbatha, to Kheif Husein is more than twenty-five hours at Tmmla pace : add three or four more for Ain Turaa. 1 found no water, though I saw several dry pools. Brief details : one hour west, veering nearly to south through confused hills -the loute is difficult hut possible for cars. Three and a half hours almost due south to the top of Magrah Turaa, the surface is generally smooth, and in places, is as good as a motor track. The macjrah, a word preferred locally to the more general wadi, is a broad depression running due south, rising as it goes ; the eastern side is higher than the western.’— 2(59 — There is no main wadi hed, and the depression is intersected by small water channels. Seven and a hall: hours almost due south through undulating, hut not difficult country, to Jebel Umm Hashim. I he magrah now ceases, and the road winds through small hillocks. But as there are ranges of high hills a few miles distant, on either side, the route retains its general character of a natural line of communication between north and south. Two hours from the beginning of this stage the Wadi Sabak, running down from the small well of that name, debouches on the left, debel l mm Hashim is a long ridge, a few hundred feet high, with several sugardoaf peaks, barring the almost straight route hitherto followed. A slight detour south-eastwards is made over a short, fairly steep, but not difficult naqb 1 practicable for cars— the only naqb met with so far. Four hours down a narrow wadi slightly east of south takes one past the southern end of the Umm Hashim ridge. At about the third hour a well-defined track runs in from the east, leading, I was told, to Sabak, el-Alag and el-Ogda. At the end of this stage begins the sandy surface, characteristic of the rest of the journey to the sea. Here, though 1 failed to see the junction myself, the track joined the usual route to Abu Markha. Ten hours almost due south to Kheif Husein : going sandy ; one low naqb covered with big boulders. The track has been partially cleared over the worst part of the naqb. u As I had no watch, the time throughout is a rough cal culation based on the sun. I think the chief difficulty of the whole journey would be the sandy wadies between ISTakhl Mubarak and Yambo ; and that if cars could negotiate these, they could easily manage the part of the route that I reconnoitred.” ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. The chief incident we have to record is an unsuccessful attack by the Arabs on Jerdun on July 21. The Arab regulars were not supported by the Rowalla and Howeitat, who scarcely took part in the action, and they consequently suffered com paratively heavy losses. The Sherifians had seventy casualties, while the Turks lost seventeen men killed and twenty-seven wounded. A ha 7 nla was intercepted on the way to Maan and bombed bv one of our aeroplanes on July 19. According to a deserter the Turks had four men killed, and five wounded, and in addition, six animals were killed, labia el-Hamra, half-way between Maan and Jerdun, fell to the Arabs, who killed sevenTurks and captured twenty-three. One officer, three men, and a convoy of camels, hound for Jerdun with water, were also captured. Demolitions were carried out by night between Maan and Jerdun on July 20. Two officers who deserted from Maan, report that the supply of Hour is exhausted, and only four thousand kilogrammes of grain are left. A fresh battalion of Turks has arrived at Kutrani from Constantinople, while at Fareifra two thousand Turks are concentrated with machine guns, artillery and five hundred transport animals. The Turkish troops are still being watered from Kutrani by motor-trollies, which ply regularly between that place and Fareifra. On July 29, Bedouins captured twenty men and a sergeant, who were endeavouring to repair the telegraph wire between Aneza and Jerdun. Southern Area. Local agents in Jiddah affirm that eight hundred Ateibah recently left the northern army because Feisal had not paid them. The King’s version of the affair, given to Colonel Bassett, is that the Ateibah are unable to stand the northern climate, and are being sent back for service in the southern Hejaz ! Sherif Ali has advised the King of a raid by one of his detachments on a Turkish camel corps post, near Bir Ali, in which fifty-four Turks were killed, including Ahmed Rifaat, their commander. One hundred camels were killed, and sixty rifles and eighty-one camels captured. The Arab losses were three men and seven horses killed. [Note. —This report should be accepted with reserve. It is intrinsically improbable that a hundred camels would be slain in what was admittedly a mere raid, to say nothing of the extraordinary disparity in the casualties of the two parties.] According to information .collected by Sherif Sharaf from native sources early in July, the supply of grain at Medina will be exhausted in three months. Last year’s old and rancid dates have been issued as rations, and more than half the garrison is said to be sick. Medina’s distress is reflected in el-Ula, which has received no supplies since the despatch of two hundred sheep and some dates two months ago. Supplies are at a low ebb, and though in June the garrison secured a haul of thirty-seven thousand sabs of grain (about one thousand seven hundred bushels), by confiscating stores hidden by the natives, it was at once absorbed by the demands of the daughter garrison stations. Only a small supp ] y of grain was available for sowing this year, and, moreover, the native farmer will not plant that another may reap. The number or palms in el-Ula is said to be fifty thousand, and it is estimated that twenty thousand of these will bear fruit, which should supply the needs of the oord Division for two or three months. Considerable unrest is reported among the civil population, and the sheikhs have even discussed co-operation with the Sherif : but the fear of the Turks is upon them, and so far, no steps havebeen taken to organise a rising within the town. The able-bodied male population is estimated at a thousand. Eye-witnesses deny the report p. 244), that Bedouins supply the Turks with tood. If any grain were offered for sale, it would be snapped up at once by the civil population, who are in straits. [Late News.—Northern Area .—On July 26, the Turks attacked and occupied l abia el-Hamraat a cost of six men killed and seventeen wounded. An Arab counter-attack, made the following day, was unsuccessful. A convoy of fifty camels, and from two hundred and fifty to three hundred men and a machine gun company reached Maan on July 28. A satisfactory flow of deserters continues to come in—twenty-two were dealt with between July 28 and 30. Southern Area .—Sherif Pasha’s presence in Mecca confirms the report on page 272, of the fall of Dauqa. Leaving a detach ment in the south on outpost duty, he has reported himself to King Husein with the remainder of his force, in the hope of joining in the Khurma venture.] NOTES. Abdul Hamid and Ibn Rashid. In the light of a later telegram from Jiddah, it appears that the affair reported on page 261 was not the complete success claimed by Sherif Abdullah. The hostile party numbered forty- three men, under Abdul Hamid Bey. Of these, only the leader, another officer named Ali Khalil, and five men, were killed. The full story is not yet to hand. Sheikh Hedeiban el-Geheishi, the leader of the Sherifians, reports that he captured the tents and rifles of the whole party, but only the officers and a few men were slain, the rest making off on their camels. Probably Hedeiban’s men abandoned the pursuit so soon as plunder offered. It is noteworthy that the sheikh describes the enemy as Muzeinat and Mugheir Harb, not as Turks. The King has handed over all the documents captured from Abdul Hamid. They have just reached Cairo and are being translated. One is a letter from Ibn Rashid to Abdul Hamid, protesting his loyalty to the Turkish Government, and repudiating any suggestion that his departure from Medain Salih was an escape. Why should he escape from the Government with whom he was on the best of terms? He says that the road to Koweit has been blocked for two months past, and that a caravan which set forth from Medina some time ago, was waylaid and looted by Sherifian Arabs (see p. 245). Sheikh Hedeiban reports that he captured letters addressed to Ibn Rashid and the Turkish authorities, but no such letters have yet reached the King, who is making enquiries about them.Sherijian Overtures to Ibn Rashid. King Husein reports that •Abdullah has communicated with [bn Rashid in Hail, assuring him of his consideration and regard if he will join him, and suggesting that he has nothing to hope for from the Turks, who will not trust him. The Emir replied that he was willing to consider the matter, but must be given time ; meanwhile Abdullah must tell no one. Ibn Rashid's motives have previously been explained [see p. ^1S). It is hardly likely that he will commit himself until he knows that the prospect of obtaining guns from the Turks is hopeless. At the time he wrote to Abdullah he must have been expecting Abdul Hamid el-Masri from Medina. Asir. The Turks, according to the story of a local agent in Jiddah, have captured Dauqa, about twenty-five miles north of Kuntida. Dauqa was for some time the headquarters of a small Sherifian force, despatched from Mecca in March last {see page 96). The news is, at present, unconfirmed, but in view of Sheikh Mohammed Areifan’s report, made last March {see page MO), that the force was insufficient and the com mander incompetent, there is little ground for doubting that yet another of King Husein’s “side-shows” has failed. The same informant added that the Dhawi Haraz Ashraf have made secret overtures to the Turks, offering their allegiance. Possibly the Dhawi Hasan Ashraf are meant. The latter are a powerful, piratical tribe, mustering some three thousand or more fighting men, who inhabit the maritime plain from just north of Lith to Hamdh (see No. 55, page 288). they have always been intolerant of control, whether Turkish or Sherifian, and if the above news is true, it may be assumed that they have not been influenced by any feelings of loyalty to the Turks. Idri si's A ffairs. A report has been received at Aden of an engagement between l urks and Idrisians at Dar el-Has(P) on July 16, in which the Turks, who were the aggressors, were worsted. They are said to have had one hundred casualties, while Idrisi lost tffirty kb ed and ten wounded. Idrisi’s efforts to recruit Hashid and Bekil tribesmen (see page 255), have met with a certain measure of success. Two hundred and fifty of the former, and V ? W o£ the iftter, tribe have come in, and it is reported that ‘ulherents^ 11 ^ esh ' Shaif 18 ex P ec ted, together with his . ie P°rts that Idrisi’s southernmost port r ?Mprlt l 16 18 fleeting troops at Abs, Maawiz, Habl and Medi, with the hope of marching south.

Seyyid Husein expects to brine; the atlnn Sultans to Aden in the first week of September to ratify e reaty. the Resident at Aden is at present unable to communicate with the Sultan owing' to a monsoon. r rhe Jerusalem Executions. f^e execution of Ahmed Arif el-Huseini, the ate Alum of Gaza (see No. 38, p. 19), was heard at Jerusalem, on the first day of Bairam. A memorial service, to which many people were invited by Tahir Effendi Daudi, father-in-law ot the Mufti, was held at the tomb of the victims. The dead man s little son and daughter read a speech and poem, which greatly affected those present. Incidents such as these serve a useful purpose in contrasting the ruthless methods of the Turks with the present regime in Palestine. Libya. In spite of their many differences, a modus vivendi seems to have been arranged between Seyyid Ahmed and Ramadan Shitewi. Fhe former is to be the civil representative of Ottoman power in Tripoli and ^yrtica, and the Governor of the country, while Ramadan is to remain, independent of Seyyid Ahmed, in com mand of all the troops at present under his influence. The final arrangements with Ramadan are to be made by Yusuf Bey ibn Shitwan and Sadik Pasha. These latter, and several Turkish officers, have recently landed from submarines. It will be interesting to see how long the artificial agreement between the rival principals will stand the strain of events. Already it is reported that a convoy of Harabi Arabs, bringing money to Seyyid Ahmed from Ishak Pasha, were robbed and massacred by Ramadan’s orders. Lij Yasu. The Commissioner, Berbera, telegraphs, under date July 21, that travellers have returned from Jibuti, whither they had gone to join Lij Yasu, reporting that the latter has died of fever in the Danakil country. The Commissioner is disposed to credit the report. Lij Yasu’s death is also reported throughout Ogaden. The Abyssinians are said to be concealing the news. It will be remembered that a false report of this prince’s death, on a previous occasion (see No. 74, p. 516), was widely credited.SECRET. Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, August 20, 1918. No. 100.

Our hundredth number offers occasion and excuse for a retrospect of the career of the Arab Bulletin since it started more than two years ago. It has changed its character in some respects during that period, as it has changed its name: for it began as “Arab Bureau Summaries” published under the authority of the Foreign Office, but in connection with the General Staffs at that time. The Arab Bureau which had barely attained to a separate existence, was dovetailed into the Military Intelligence Office, Cairo, directed by Brig.-Gen. G. F. Clayton, and widely known by its telegraphic address, “Intrusive.” The Headquarters of the General Staff, then at Ismailia, issued an Intelligence Bulletin, and to this “Arab Bureau Summaries” were originally intended to be a supplement, the first suggestion of them having been made by Captain, now Lieut.-Colonel T. E. Lawrence. Half-a-dozen numbers followed the General Staff model, being typewritten by the Roneo process. The idea of printing soon arose, partly owing to imperfect execution of the reproduc tive process, which made the sheets difficult to read, but more from the existence of a small confidential military staff at the Government Press, which, having at that time light work, was able to take on the printing of the Arab Bureau Summaries as its chief duty. For the first number so printed, a new name, “ Arab Bulletin ” was adopted, and when the earlier typewritten issues were printed off immediately afterwards to complete the set, the name was made restrospective. It had been proposed at first to issue numbers, not every day like the Intelligence Bulletin of the General Staff, but at short irregular intervals, as necessary matter came in. Seven numbers accordingly appeared in twenty-four days of June 1916. But the adoption of printing inevitably retarded production, though the Press gave every facility, and by October the Bulletin had fallen to four numbers a month. A year later even this rate proved for a time impossible to maintain, as the confidential work thrown by the General Staff and the Admiralty on the Government Press increased rapidly. The difficulties became so o-reat in the latter part of 1917, that the Bulletin was on the point of either returning to Roneo or disappearing altogether. Fortunately, however, other pressure decreased at the Press, and it became possible again to produce a weekly issue. On the whole this rate has been sustained up to the present, the Press doing its part regularly and promptly if the Editor does likewise. Since it was as easv to write it in decent English as in bad, and much more agreeable, the Arab Bulletin had from the first a literary tinge not always present in Intelligence Summaries. This quality turned, in one respect, to its disadvantage. Coupled with good type and paper, it seems to have impaired the respect paid to the' confidential character of the Bulletin by some of itslimited circle of recipients. The Arab Bureau soon learned that its publication was in gratifying, but very inconvenient, demand. It began to go the round of large departments, both Military and Civil ; it was'not always kept within official precincts ; and unauthorised knowledge of its existence led to certain demands to see it regularly, which could not be resisted. Towards the end of 1917 the list of recipients was revised and restricted, and other precautions were taken to preclude the dangers of over circulation ; but some uncertainty how far it goes still remains to render the task of editing delicate and difficult. This uncertainty, added to the comparative slowness of the production of this Bulletin, and the ever increasing interval which the Editor knows must elapse between the date of its production and the date of its delivery into the hands of most recipients, led to considerable modification of its original purpose. Instituted as a Summary of the latest Arab Intelligence, it has developed rather into a medium of considered appreciations. Its actual reason for existence, as it appears to the present writer (its first editor, who has continued to edit it ever since except during certain intervals of absence from Cairo) is threefold. Firstly, it aims at giving reasoned, and as far as possible definitive, summaries of Intelligence, primarily about the Hejaz and the area of the Arab Revolt (Cairo being in closer touch with this than with other Arab areas), and secondarily about the other Arab-speaking countries-—such summaries to be compiled, as far as possible, by those in possession of all news, secret or other wise, but not necessarily to contain all that news. In practice, however, it has not been found possible for the staff, to deal equally with all, or nearly all, the Arab-speaking area. Arab Africa, foi instance, for which it is dependent on the Force in Egypt s Intelligence and the Frontier Districts Administration, has passed more and more out the Bulletin’s purview. That part of Syria, which is still in enemy hands, can hardly be dealt with at all to any good purpose. Mesopotamia and Iraq are left to the M.E.F. and the Mesopotamian Political Department, except as regards affairs east of the Euphrates. On most of the Grulf regions, for which we are dependent on the Government of ndia, information is seldom vouchsafed. In the beginnino’ the Arab Bulletin had-taken on too wide a field : and some distant areas outside the special competence of its members have had to be jettisoned—-for example, Persia. Others, like Abyssinia and oomaliland, which were introduced later into its scope, had better ae dropped out of it again, since the Arab Bureau can add little or nothing to the official reports circulated independently. Secondly, the Arab Bulletin aims at giving authoritative appreciations of political situations and questions in the area with which it Can deal at first hand. Thirdly, it aims at recording, and so preserving, all fresh historical data concerning Arabs and Arab-speaking lands, and incidentally, rescuing from oblivion any older facts which mayhelp to explain the actual situation : likewise, any data of geographical or other scientific interest, which may be brought to light by our penetration of the Arab countries during the present war. It is part of the Editor’s purpose that a complete file of the Bulletin since its beginning should be indispensable to anyone who hereafter may have to compile, for official use, a history of Arabs during the last three years, an Intelligence Handbook of any Arab district, or even a map of Arabia. As full an index as possible has been issued at the end .of each year, on the presumption that Departments and officials receiving the Bulletin, keep complete files, and have these bound for future reference. We have some reason to know that this presumption is not altogether justified. Needless to say, this threefold aim has neither been kept always in view nor fully realised. Nor has it been possible to act up to any respectable standard of Arab scholarship—the variant orthography, which each Index reveals, would refute any such claim ! But the fact that the Bulletin has been suffered to reach its hundredth number and approach a thousand and a half pages, may be taken as consolatory evidence that it fills a felt want in the present war. D.G.H. CENTRAL ARABIAN POLITICS. Mr. Philby has furnished in'telegrams, the last being dated July 24, the following information about the political situation in liiadh since April last:— It appears that when he rejoined Ibn Sand in April, he found him greatly disappointed with the outcome of his negotiations and firmly convinced that he had only the Sherif to^thank. Mr. Philby'pressed him to maintain effective control of Qasim, and exercise pressure on the Shammar to stop smuggling ; at the same time urging him to undertake an attack against Hail, and promising him a favourable settlement of the Ajman question. The Emir was assured that our engagements with the_ Sherif involved nothing that could prejudice his interests, or militate in any way against his absolute independence. In response to Ibn Sand’s plea of lack of funds, Mr. Philby advanced him certain monies lying at Uqair on condition that he attacked the Shammar. Ibn Saud accepted the money, and agreed to open an offensive at the beginning of Ramadan, and preparations were made accordingly ; but a series of untoward events such as the Koweit blockade, the attack on Khurrna and tribal difficulties arising out of the conflicting interests of himself, Mesopotamia and Koweit, caused him to stay his hand, and it was soon evident that he was suspicious of our policy and inclined to listen to public opinion, which openly demanded action against— 278 — the King and the Ajman. Mr. Philby is apprehensive lest public sentiment prove too strong for the Emir, who, he asserts, has pledged himself to go to the assistance of Klmrma if it is again attacked ; and also to take vengeance on the Ajman if we do not restrain them. Ibn Rashid is but a fourth in Ibn Sand’s list of enemies: the Sherif, the Ajman and Ibn Subah. His grievance against the two last has been aggravated by an attack, made by a mixed force of about one hundred Ajman and Aslam Shammar, under the protection of the Awazim,on Ibn Saud’s Subai adherents, between Qatif and Hasa. The assailants, who had previously attacked and plundered a caravan of Ibn Saud’s, were routed. These raids were organised and initiated in Koweit territory, and aroused public anger in Eejd. On July 24, Mr. Philby reported that Ibn Saucl had handed him a written statement in which he complained that he was not being protected from the aggression of the Ajman and King Husein, and must, therefore, repudiate his undertaking to attack Ibn Rashid and to accept responsibility for the leakage of supplies to the enemy, unless definite guarantees were at once forthcoming from His Majesty’s Government. The first of his demands was that the British Government should guarantee him absolute immunity from attack or interference of any kind by the Sherif. The vexed questions of the Ateiba boundary and Khurma would, presumably, come within the purview of this guarantee. His next point was that we should guarantee that the Ajman and Shammar elements under our protection should not enter his territory for any purpose what ever without his permission ; and those who were not under our protection should not be allowed to enter territory in our occupation or Koweit. On receipt of satisfactory assurances from the British Government he expressed his intention to move against Ibn Rashid at once. Thirdly and finally, he asked that the blockade should be in British hands, or all goods for Nejd landed at Bahrein or Hasa ports. So far as the Sherif is concerned, the soundness and justice of his position in regard to the rebellious Emir of Khurma, have already been asserted in these pages. The undeniable extension of the Ikhwan movement among the fierce and lawless sections of Arabs in the remoter parts of his territory could not but be disquieting to the King, who is by no means deaf to the warnings of history. One of the strongest proofs of the King’s loyalty to his promise to abstain from action against Ibn Saud, is his attitude to the overtures of the Ajman. Their paramount chief, Ibn Mithlein, and his predecessor Ibn Theidan, have sent hirfi a letter, signed by them and the influential sheikhs of the tribe, openly declaring their hostility to Ibn Saud, and declaring their allegiance to him. The writers, though asking for the King s advice, hint that the pressure of events may lead them into open war against Nejd. It is evident that they are cognisant of the strained relations between the two rulers, and the stress they lay on their friendship for Ibn Subah is almost an openr m i ? &lt;■ invitation to the King to join in a combined assault on his enemy. The King has manfully resisted the temptation to dally with this project, and has advised the Ajman delegates to apply to the British representative at Koweit for advice and instructions, reminding them that his policy and ours are identical. As for Ibn Rashid, his patience would seem to be exhausted. He has apparently abandoned all hope of receiving the longed- for guns from the Turks; and the last of the pro-Turk Emirs has made overtures—timid and halting—to Abdullah. He cannot be ignorant of the approaching crisis at Khurma, and his move ments in the near future are of the utmost importance in this connection. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. Nuri Shaalan, though not for the first time (see No. 41, p. 55), has pledged himself to support the Arab movement. His message to King Husein, dated August 8, backed up by the concentration of his forces in the vicinity of the railway, is full of promise for the future. Nuri says :— “ Yesterday I arrived at the headquarters of your victorious army at Abu Lissal, to co-operate in the sacred jihad Your Majesty has proclaimed against the Turks, who deem it lawful to shed Mohammedan blood. Ask God to grant us success, for the benefit of the nation, and to assist me in doing good work, so that I may gain Your Majesty’s kindly approbation.” King Husein, who has given Nuri £5,000 from his subsidy, responds:— “I have received your message with pleasure, and welcome you with open arms. Your adhesion to the Arab Cause is a good omen for the future of all the Arabs, and is a cause of pride to me personally. My sons are your sons. May God preserve you, and may your presence refresh the eyes of the people and the country.” On the morning of August 8, Mudowara station was carried by a brilliant assault, and the garrison overwhelmed. The Turks lost thirty-five killed, and six officers and one hundred and forty- six men—including twenty-six wounded—were captured. A considerable quantity of military stores, including two guns and three machine guns, was seized. The attackers had one officer and six men killed, and two officers and eight men wounded. The destruction wrought in this area was most thorough. A large steam-pump, a windmill-pump, a water-tower with its tanks, and two wells, seventy-five feet in depth, were ruined.el-Haj was bomb Maan on Augusi weighing one hi governor’s house. hundredweight, tell in the courtyard of the Southern Area. An Arab post at Tetid, near Abu Naam, Sherif Abdullah reports, was attacked by the Turks after considerable artillery preparation. The assailants were beaten off, losing titty-two men killed and sixteen prisoners. Another attack is expected, as the Turks are anxious to get possession of the palm-trees in On August 10 Sherif Ali reported that his force was leaving Bir esh-Sharufi, with the intention of attacking Jeleijila. In front of Ohod one of his patrols captured three Turks. * The situation at el-Ula, outlined on p. 270, has become intolerable, according to one of its sheikhs who has arrived at Weil). He offers to organise a rising against the lurks, it b her it Abdullah will attack the town, and King Husein has ordered Sherif Sharaf to go to Wadi Ais to discuss a plan of action. Mr. Philby reports that the economic situation in Hail is such as to cause Ibn Rashid anxiety. Stores, accumulated in the past, are not yet exhausted, but, except for the small quantities brought by Bedouins from Koweit and Zubeir, no new supplies are forthcoming. These facts will no doubt exeicise then influence on Ibn Rashid’s decision {see above p. 279). General.t» 'f t- r ' NOTES. Syrians in England and King Husein. The Syrian Community in Great Britain, at a meeting presided over by Sir Mark Sykes, in July, sent a message of gratitude to King Husein and his troops for their valiant stand against the common oppressor of the Arabs. A spirit of self- sacrifice was shown by the members of this small meeting, which collected a sum of no less than £2,218. The King, in his reply, says, “ Your noble resolution is a proof that you are emulating the dignity and honour of your ancestors. I accept with gratitude your munificent offering.” The King has given £1,000 to the Jerusalem Moslem Benevolent Fund, and £600 to the fund for the relief of the refugees from east of the Jordan. Emir Feisal, for whose personal use £500 was given by a single donor, has also allotted this sum to the latter fund. The Plight of Madeha. At the end of July, twenty fugitives from Madeba arrived in Jericho. They report that a systematic attempt to denude the town of all its materials was to have been made by Turkish soldiers, who were luckily recalled before they could carry out their instructions. The unhappy inhabitants are between two fires : if the Turks hold the town, everything is requisitioned ; and if the garrison be withdrawn, they are at the mercy of any numerically superior tribe with whom they are at feud. To make their lot even harder, the Turks have ordered the Arabs under their influence, to kill anyone who attempts to cross to the British lines. The worst fears of these refugees have been realised. According to' a later report by an agent, Abu ’1-Ghanam, one of the most influential sheikhs of the Belqa, has joined hands with the Zebn section of the Beni Sakhr, in an attack against the Madeba Christians. The latter can only muster about three hundred and fifty rifles, and it is unlikely that they will be able to resist this formidable con centration of Arabs, who have an intimate knowledge of the whole terrain. In the opinion of a Mnkhtar of Madeba, one Khafif el-Khuri, who has reached Jerusalem, the Turks care for none of these things ; but it would appear that one at least of the local sheikhs—Abu Sitta of the Awazim—is deterred from taking part in this expedition by a wholesome dread of British reprisals. Emir Feisal is endeavouring to bring pressure to bear on the two turbulent tribes. Dhow Traffic between Eritrea and A sir. force for over two years, has been provisionally relaxed so far as trade between Eritrea and Jeizan is concerned. In the opinion of experts, the blockade has fulfilled its purpose, and the time has come when it is possible to meet the wishes of the Italian mGovernment, and, subject to certain restrictions, to _ permit a traffic which will enable them to import cattle foi their canning factory at Asmara. Dhows, up to a maximum of fifteen, will be allowed to ply only between the ports of Massawa and Jeizan. The authorities at Aden, in conjunction with the Italian staff, will determine the nature of contraband, and also limit the import of any non-contraband commodity which could be of use to the enemy. Idrisis Affairs. It appears, from the report of .a local agent, that the Turkish success at Loheiya was in no small measure due to the active co-operation of certain Arab sheikhs. Loheiya was their brte noir, for its capture by Idrisi had resulted in the diversion of the extensive caravan traffic which used to find its way through the Beni Abs and Wayidat country—where Yahya Ali ibn Thawwab and Hadi ibn el-Haij levied toll—to the coast route through Habl and Loheiya. Ahmed Pasha Habash, chief of the Beni Jami clans, was' liberated by Ibn Thawwab on his undertaking to induce his tribesmen to fall upon Idrisi (though an earlier report suggests that the Beni Jami remained loyal after all, see p. 262). The name of the scene of the engagement of July 16 between Idrisi and the Turks {see p. 272) is now reported as Dar el-Hasni. Ghalib Bey {see No. 73, p. 506) was killed, together with two prominent pro-Turkish sheikhs. ... . . Captain Clayton has taken up the duties of Military Liaison officer with Idrisi. He reports that Idrisi’s troops, after concen trating at Medi, marched south and re-occupied Abu Halik, while the Jebeli contingent remained at Habl. Lhe lurks have taken Menaza. Captain Clayton will assist and advise Idrisi in military affairs, endeavour to restrict his operations to action against the Turks and their Arab allies on the Beni Abs and Loheiya front, and restrain him from dissipating his forces in small local encounters. Yemen. Aden has recently been visited by two delegates from the Arabs of the interior. The first, Sheikh Abdullah ibn Abdul Wahid of Ibb, the Resident reports, w T as made a Pasha on' the occasion of his visit to Constantinople in 1907, and holds three decorations, headed by the Hamidieh first class. He came to solicit an alliance with the British Government, and our co-operation in an ambitious programme which included a scheme for capturing the Turkish garrisons of Ibb, Taiz and the country to the south. He had fortified himself with agreements signed by many sheikhs of the Ibb and Udein districts, among whom are Mansur ibn Nasir of Jebel Hubeish, and Mohammed Abdul Wahab of Badan, who pledge themselves to support him with men and money. Our recent experience in the Yemen is not such as to encourage petty military alliances in this region—ventures, which even if successful, would only complicate an already difficult political problem, and would involve the hostility of the Imam Yahya, who vigorously opposes the pretensions of smaller men in a district he has asked us to regard as his. Therefore, it has been decided liberally to entertain and reward Sheikh Abdullah, giving him to understand that his goodwill is appreciated and welcomed by us. In any case, the offer of co-operation comes a little late, as Turkish troops have been actively engaged in crushing rebellions in Jebel Hubeish and Jebel Badan for some time past. The second visitor, Sheikh Mahyub ibn Ali Kuleibi of el - Hada, came with a message from his uncle and brother, offering to seal a pact of friendship with the British Government. Id-Kuleibi belongs to the el-Kalaba clan of the Beni Mohammed, itself a sub-tribe of the Bakil. El-Hada lies to the east of Maabar, and borders on the Beni Dhubyan country. Letters which Sheikh Mahyub bore from thirteen small sheikhs of el-Hada, Dhu Mohammed, and Khaulan, were seized and destroyed by Seyyid Ahmed Pasha, from whom he barely escaped with his life.ISECRET.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau,THE CALIPHATE. The Arab Bureau is indebted to Lieut. F. R. Rodd, General Staff Intelligence, for the following translation of “ Appunti sulla natura del ‘ Califfato ’ in genere e sul presunto ‘ Califfato Ottomano,’ ” by Carlo Alfonso Nallino, Professor of History and Islamic Institutions at the University of Rome. The work was printed by the Italian Foreign Office in 1917. We propose to publish the translation in instalments. CHAPTER I. The Nature of the Caliphate. 1 Mohammed had founded a religion and a state at one and the same time; 2 during his lifetime both had the same territorial extension. In his capacity of Prophet and Apostle of God he was the only religious authority. In his own con ception, and in that of his followers, this function admitted no delegation of spiritual or other powers, nor of the trans mission of such powers after his death by inheritance. Divine revelation, says the Koran, definitely closed with Mohammed, after which believers had to follow his teachings faithfully and no more. In the religion of Islam there are no traces of religious hierarchy or brotherhoods of priests. . A parallel to the Christian theory of Sacraments or intermediaries between God and the individual is completely absent. To find any thing which resembles in the least degree the spiritual powers of the Greek, Catholic or Protestant clergy, one must search among those late developments of Islamism which occurred some six centuries after Mohammed, that is to say in religious con fraternities. Here we do find real spiritual power and care for the spiritual welfare of the members. These can only, however, be said to exist in the relations between master and the adept, who eventually forms part of the community after a novitiate of his own free will. In no case do they affect either doctrine or ritual. The only succession to Mohammed to be considered after his death, was that of the sovereignty over all the Islamic state which, founded as it was on a common religion, was radically different from those relations politically and socially prevalent in that part of Arabia previous to the rise of Islam. The questions which arose were whether, when the Prophet’s political activities were at an end, the ancient separatist policy of the tribes was to return ; or whether the state which had arisen at Medina was to continue its existence unchanged,— 28 () — and in this case to whose lot the sovereignty was to fall. Neither the Koran, which for Moslems is the Word of God and not the word or work of Mohammed, nor the Prophet himself had left any indication on this head. On the evening of the same day on which the Prophet had breathed his last, the opinion prevailed after several hours of violent discussion, that the political unity of the Moslems had to be maintained. Abu Bakr was elected “ Head of the State of Islam ” ; the title of “ Caliph ” (Khalifa) 3 also appears to have been given to him at this time. Lhe word Khalifa in Arabic signifies as much a “ successor in a public position as a “ representative ” or “ vicar of a higher authority in a more limited and special capacity. In the choice of this word two verses of the Koran concerning Adam and David respectively may, I think, not improbably have had some influence. Historically speaking, therefore, the Caliphs are successors of Mohammed in “ ruling the whole Moslem state, that is to say, the Universality of Mohammedans ” ; this is presupposing, as in fact was the case for several centuries, the absence of Mohammedan peoples under non-Mohammedan rule. In a manner, at first sight inexplicable to Europeans, these universal Sovereigns of Islam, as indeed all other Moslem rulers, while possessing executive and judicial powers without limitations are absolutely devoid of any legislative power, since this legis lative power, properly speaking, can only be the sharia or Divine Law, which the doctors or “ulema” alone can interpret. In the religious sphere the only attributions of the Caliph, as of any other Moslem sovereign, are, to protect the Faith against internal and external enemies with the weight of his secular arm, and to see that the public ritual, consisting in common prayer on Fridays, is regularly celebrated. This character of the Caliphate which necessarily devolves from its historical origin, is fully recognised in theory by jurists and Moslem Sunni writers. As an example, I translate here part of the famous Islamic catechism concerning the Caliph, written by Abu Hafs Omar el-Nasafi, who died 1142 a.d. I have chosen this book not only on account of its celebrity, but also because it is one of the texts prescribed in the “ Madrasas, or higher schools of theology and religious law, at Constanti nople ~ “ Moslems cannot exist without an Imam 4 whose duties are to cause Islamic law to be observed, apply the punishments laid down in the Koran, defend the frontiers, train the army, collect the tithes, reduce rebels to obedience as well as thieves and brigands, cause public prayer on Fridays and other feaststo be held, give judgment in controversies between persons, receive testimony on legal questions, supervise the marriages of minors who have no guardians, divide the booty of war, and similar matters. The Imam must be a visible personage, neither hidden nor awaited in the future. 5 He shall be of the blood of the Koreish tribe and not of another ; but be need not necessarily belong to the sub-tribe of Hashim nor to the descen dants of Ali. 6 That the Imam should be infallible or without sin is not a requisite, nor yet that he be superior in merit to his con temporaries ; 7 on the other hand a condition is that he should be suitable to hold absolute power, that he should be a good governor, and that he should be capable of enforcing the obser vance of the Law of Islam, and that he should be capable ol defending the frontiers of Mohammedan territories and safe guarding the right of the oppressed against the oppressor. The Imam may not be deposed by reason of evil moral conduct or ol tyranny. This brief definition of el-Nasafi clearly shews that the Caliph is neither more nor less than the Supreme Monarch, to whose care the interests of all Mohammedans and the main tenance of their political unity are entrusted. He is secular head of all the territories of Islam, the supreme judge, the Commander of the Army, the Defender of the Faith by means of the sword; but he is not the interpreter of the Divine Law, nor Arbitrator of a man’s spiritual conscience. He has no powers over doctrine or rite, with the exception, possibly, of assuring, in his capacity of supreme authority of the state, the regular celebration of public worship. Anyone might object that if this were so, it is strange that the Catechisms, which ought to be concerned only with religious things, consider the question of the Caliphate. The Sunni Moslems, however ; argue that since the Shia sect gave the Imam a divine form and made the question one of doctrine, this had necessarily to be discussed in their theological works in their efforts to oppose heterodoxy and the mistakes arising therefrom, though they are prepared to admit that per se the matter should not have entered into the field of religious belief. This course was obviously called for to warn the Faithful against the mis statements of the Shia sect. 8 Sunni Islamism has never admitted a supreme head of the Moslem religion. A Church or hierarchy of Priests does not exist. 9 Religious unity is maintained by the doctors (ulema) who are the “ heirs of the Prophets ”, and not by the Caliph. The doctors alone were responsible in the past for elaborating the doctrines, ritual and canon law, without any interference on the part of the Caliph or other sovereign. It is the duty of thedoctors alone now to safeguard the unaltered maintenance of tradition, and to decide on the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of new teachings and new customs. In all these matters the common consent of the doctors, and not the will of the Caliph, prevails. In certain cases, naturally, acute differences of opinion, which have lasted for several generations, have arisen between doctors, but these have eventually gone to form, as it were, an average opinion or compromise. The Ulema are not a body of the state, but private savants on whom public renown, and not the authority of the Govern ment or academic diplomas, has conferred the title of doctor. Only those who have accepted the appointment of judges [kadi or mufti) become public officials, or, in other words, legal advisers of the Government on abstract theoretical questions. Books of law and religious science continually advise the doctors to avoid undue intimacy with sovereigns and the per sonages of the state. They show how some of the most illustrious Ulema obstinately refused the appointments of judges offered them by Caliphs, and do not fail to demonstrate that the desire to “ ingratiate themselves with high political authorities such as Caliphs and Emirs has not been the least oi the causes which led to the falsification of tradition about Mohammed by means of pronouncements or actions justifying these authorities. Recalling what has been discussed in the foregoing pages, we may say that the Caliph is the “ Prince of Believers ” and the universal monarch of Moslems, but not the head of the Moslem religion. Before questions of doctrine or rite he is a simple believer, bound by the traditions as they are maintained by the Ulema. He is the Defender of the Faith of Islam and an enemy of heresy only in so far as European Emperors, Kings and Princes, in past times, were also Defenders of the Christian Faith and enemies of heresy. The Caliph only differs from other Mohammedan Sovereigns (Sultans, Kings, Emirs, etc.,) by the fact that his sovereignty extends, or is supposed to extend, over all the Mohammedan world; and by the fact that his ideals are the maintenance of the political and territorial unity among Mohammedans, and the conquest of all Infidel States as soon as his resources allow. The position of the Caliph in the Moslem world corresponds fairly accurately with that of the Emperor or Universal Monarch of Christianity, according to the conception of Ghibelline jurists in the middle ages. 10 They held that Kings, Princes, Dukes, etc., were only legitimate sovereigns in any country by the right conferred on them for that territory in their feudal investi ture by the Emperor. Similarly, according to the ordinarylaw of Islam, Sultans, Kings, and Emirs are only legitimate if the ruling Caliph has delegated authority over a certain region to them, that is to say, has invested them with temporal or feudal power. In the extract from el-Nasafi, quoted above, it is clear that two requisites are indispensable, according to the Sunnis, for a Caliph; first, that he should be descended from the Koreish tribe, and secondly, that he should be capable of govern ing. On the latter requisite depends the condition that he should be of age which, according to the Moslem law, coincides with puberty, a boy being considered legally incapable of o-overnment. The second condition also implies that he should be physically capable, that is to say, that he should not be blind or deaf, and that he should be sound of mind and of sufficient education. ETNasafi does not mention the other indispensable conditions, namely that he should be Moslem and that he should be a free man ; but this would, in reality, have been superfluous, it being an axiom in the law of Islam that no non-Moslem or slave can exercise power (ivilaya, imperiuni) over the Faithful. It may be worth adding that jurists consider the elevation to the rank of Caliph a contract between the individual and the Mohammedan community. I his cannot be perfect without the baia or presentation of homage by the representatives of the community. 11 The appointment may take place by election, if a vacancy has occurred, or by the Caliph designating an heir to the throne during his reign; but even m the latter case the individual designated must already be a major and must have formally consented. The presentation of homage by the representatives must also have taken place. Even during the periods when the Caliphate was hereditary, namely in the dynasties of the Ommiads (661-750 a.d.), and in that of the Abbasids (750-1258 a.d.), it was always considered to be a form of true election on the part of the representatives of the community, or a designation of an heir to the throne previously approved by the community. Minors were always excluded,' and eldest or other sons, brothers or other relations were freely chosen. To render clearer what I shall have to say later on, I will add here that one of the outward and visible signs of sovereignty is the invocation of the blessing of Cod on the name of the ruling sovereign of Islam during the khutba, or Friday prayers, which are held in so-called “ Cathedral ” Mosques. In failing to name the Sovereign towards the end of this khutba when the preacher calls down the blessing of God on all Believers, rebellion is proclaimed against him, and the history of Moham medan peoples goes to show the very real effect in theory andpractice of this detail.* 2 The Caliph’s name, as Sovereign of all Mohammedans, must be mentioned m the khutba and after his, that of such other Sultan, King, or Emir, as the Caliph has invested with power over the territory in which the sard khutba is held. If no Caliph exists, the prayer during the khutba is offered only for the Moslem sovereign of the territory itself. 33 Notes on Chapter I. (1) . This memorandum only deals with the Caliphs of the Sunnis and not with the Caliph, or better, Imam, as he is known, in the small sect of Moslem Shias, who are mostly Persians, and in whom for the moment we are not interested. (2) . Mohammed only became head of the one State on his migration [sm] or Hejira from Mecca to Medina in Septembei, 622 a.d. His death occurred on a Monday which almost certainly corresponds to June 8 , 632 a.d ; the date of his birth is unknown. It was only decided in the Caliphate of Omar (634 -644 a.d.) that the Moslem calendar should be calculated in lunar months from the beginning of the Arab year during which the Hejira took place, that is to say, from sunset of July 15, 622 (since the Arabs, Hebrews, and at one time even people in Italy, considered the beginning of a day of twenty-four hours to be at sunset and not at midnight). To this is due the mistake in many European books which place not only the beginning of the Moslem era, but also the actual migration, (not “ flight ”) of Mohammed to Medina on July 16, 662. (3) . It is not clear that this title had already been given to Abu Bakr, at least officially. The matter is only certain as regards his successor Omar (63*4-644 a.d.). In any case it is worth noting that the title Khalifa has always been more used historically and in literature than officially. In public documents, inscriptions and coins, the Caliph, according to the rule laid down by Omar, is always designated with the title of Amir el-Muminin, that is to say “ Lord of the Faith ful,” and he used to be addressed by courtiers, private individuals and officials, with this title and not with that of Khalifa. (4) . Theologians and jurists are in the habit of reserving the title of Caliph for the first four sovereigns, Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman, and Ali, as being the only persons, who, besides being illustrious companions of the Prophet, also governed exclusively according to the laws of the Koran or the comments of Mohammed. All the later sovereigns were called Imams or Chiefs, as being those who introduced innovations into the Government and public administration, not based on the Koran or the Sunna. In fact, just before the paragraph translated, w T e read inel-Nasafi: “ The Caliphate lasted thirty years, after which it became a Kingdom and Emirate ” that is to say, it became a Government not different from any other non-Moslem sovereignty. The thirty lunar years—equivalent to rather more than twenty- nine solar years—correspond to the period between the death of Mohammed (632 a.d.) and that of the fourth Caliph (661 a.d). (5) . This is an attack on the supernatural Imam of the Shia sect, who is supposed to have vanished at a certain moment and to remain hidden until his reappearance at an unknown later time. He is then to return and bring the Golden Age back to earth. (6) . This also is an attack on the Shias whose Imam is limited by divine right to the descendants of Ah. It is also an attack on the fanatical partisans of the Abbasids, who main tained that the Caliph had to be a descendant of the Hashim. a subtribe of the Koreish. Mohammed and All belonged to the Hashim. They declared that the previous Caliphate of the Ommiads was illegal, as they were of the Koreish tribe but not of the Hashim branch. (7) . Another attack on the Shia doctrine. (8) . As a result of the decreased importance of the theory and practice of the Shia sect, Sunni catechisms, drawn up for the use of schools during the last thirty years in Turkey and Egypt, have come to omit anything to do with the Caliphate or Imamate. (9) . The councils of doctors summoned by the Abbasid Caliphs, are pure inventions by the Christian Greek Savvas Pasha, author of that unfortunate and harmful book called “ Theorie du droit musulman,” which has caused so much confusion among Europeans who are not Arabic scholars. Such councils never occurred in the Islamic world. (10) . A parallel, which does not escape the attention of certain Arab authors, as example, Ibn Abi Dinar, who wrote the history of Tunis in 1681, and dealt with Charles V’s ex peditions against that place. He observes how the latter assumed the title of Imbiratur : “ a title belonging to German sovereigns, muluh al-alman, whose sovereignty is very ancient and whose Emperor is what the Caliph is for Moslems.' (11) . This baia also takes place for other sovereigns. It occurred, for example, when Husein Kamel was made Sultan of Egypt in December, 1914, and when the present Sherif of Mecca, Husein ibn Ali, declared his independence of Turkey. It is in constant use for the Sultans of Morocco and the Beys of Tunis. (12) . In Arabic writers, the expression “ in such a country the Khutba is held for ‘ X ’ ” is equivalent to saying that “ X ” is recognised as legal sovereign in that country.(13). This article of Law among Moslems is scrupulously observed at the present day, hence article 7 of the Ottoman Constitution of December 24, 1876, says: “ The cancelling and the appointment of Ministers; the conferring of public appointments, of honours and decorations; the appointments of Chiefs of privileged provinces according to their rights; the coining of money ; the mention of his name in the khutha ; the drawing up of treaties with foreign states; the declaration of war and peace; the command of military and naval forces; the carrying out of military operations; the observance of the laws of the sharia and other laws of the State ; the drawing up of regulations for public administration . . . the convocation and adjournment of Parliament; the dissolving of the Chamber of Deputies ... all these are part of the rights of His Holy Majesty the Padishah (Sultan). CENTRAL ARABIAN POLITICS. Jim Saud and Turcophile Arabs in A.nr. In the hope of winning over Ibn Saud, says Mr. Philby m a telegram dated July 30, Muhiddin Pasha, Commandant and Mutessarif of Asir, has dictated a letter to the Lmir describing the peace and prosperity of Asir under the lurks benign^ mle. The letter is signed by four of the leading sheikhs of Asir, by name, Mohammed ibn Dhuleim, Sand ibn Abdul Aziz, Hasan ibn Ali and Husein ibn Zeid. These men profess loyalty to the Sublime Islamic Government of Turkey, and regret that Aejd should idly look on, while the British effect the destruction of the Faithful. ' They hope that Ibn Saud will soon bestir himself. It must be admitted that Muhiddin has well chosen the moment for his overtures. The prestige of the Turks in southern Asir must, necessarily, have been augmented by the defeats the Idrisi has suffered, though in the north some of the tribes have kept faithful to the King. Moreover, in Sheikh Abdullah ibn Abdul Wahhab, the leading Imam, according to .Mr. Philby, he has found an advocate. The former states the case thus : if the British cannot restrain the Sherif and the Ajman, they cannot be relied on, and Ibn Saud should take action at once ; if they can and do not, their perfidy is patent. Mr. Philby is able to report, however, that the sheikh was satisfied that the best course would be to await a communication from the British Government, supported meanwhile by a written guarantee from Mr. Philby. The first three sheikhs are extremely powerful in Asir, though there is no reason to suppose that they are willing to risk muchfor the sake of the Turks. Unfortunately, we are entirely without information as to the religious feeling in Asir, though we know that a few of the Yarn, who live in Nejran, to the south-east ot Asir, have come under the influence of the Wahhabis and have corresponded with Ibn Saud. It is quite possible, therefore, that they have succeeded in implanting their doctrines in Asir itself, which lies nearer home. The Yam tribe is of the fsmailiya sect, and so unlikely, as a whole, to sympathise with the \\ ahhabis ; on the other hand, it has generally shown a pro-Turk bias, so that its co-operation is not impossible. Mr. Philb) r, s guarantee, given in ignorance of H.M.G’s support of the King’s action at Khurma, will probably involve us in a charge of bad faith, and, incited by Abdullah ibn Abdul Wahhab, Ibn Saud might be tempted to temporise with the Turks in Asir. On the other hand, his geographical position in relation to his enemies is unenviable. On the east lie Koweit and the Ajman, on the south the Sheri!,' and on the north Ibn hash id. (It is doubtful whether even an alliance with the Turks would secure him against his hereditary foe.) Therefore, on the whole, it is unlikely that anything serious will materialise from these Turco-Nejdean negotiations. Ibn Saud and the Sherijians. On August 6, Mr. Philby reported that Ibn Saud was in possession of letters which Sherif Abdullah wrote, on July 13, to Dhari ibn Fuhaid and Hadhdhil ibn Hadhdhal, Sheikhs of the Shiyabin section of the Ateiba. In his letters, which evidently did not impress the recipients who passed them on to Ibn Saud, Abdullah says, first, that the Sherif and Ibn Rashid have made peace, and negotiations are proceeding between them regarding affairs both north and south, and that God is supporting him against the rebellious Ibn Saud ; secondly, that he is in command of a punitive force, concentrated near Bquran with a view to ^ attacking Khurma. [Bquran may stand for Burain, thirty-five miles west of Khurma.] He announces his intention to move to the Shudhub wells in Wadi Subai, about a day’s journey east of Khurma, where he enjoins the Ateiba to meet him. The action of Abdullah, in thus running contrary to the King’s policy and repeated assurances to us, cannot be too strong!} condemned. The King was informed at once, and strongly urged to write to Abdullah and Shakir that his honour is pledged to refrain from aggression against Ibn Saud.“W - —' — 294 — DAWASIR AND NEJRAN. A telegraphic summary of Mr. Philby’s report on his journey from Ifiyadh to Davvasir, dated dune 2o, has just been received. As Mr. Philby furnishes extremely interesting information about a section of Arabia, unknown to the most famous Arabian explorers, we make no apology for reproducing his summary report pending the promised complete account, with a map. Mr. Philby’s route was as follows :— Outward ' journey. —Riyadh-Kharj-Aflaj-Hamam-Suleiyib- Tamra-Kimida-Wadi (381 miles including detours). Return journey. —Wadi-Tuweiq plateau via Haddar-Hamar- Sitara-Ghail-Hauta-Hair-Riyadh (295 miles). The journey occupied fifty days, twenty days more than Mr. Philby had anticipated, owing to the adverse effect of the heat on the camels. He fixes the oasis of Wadi, which is about nine miles in length, on longitude 45, latitude 21, Suleiyil lying about forty miles due east. Wadi Dawasir starts at the junction of Tathlith, Bisha and Ranya, and runs through the oasis, and later divides Tuweiq, passing close to Suleiyil into Biadh and eventually into the great desert, about forty miles away. Mr. Philby states that he heard everywhere enthusiastic praise of I bn Sand’s administration, which, in five years, has established security for the traveller in the south, where formerly brigandage and tribal warfare were rife ; the routes west and south of Wadi beyond Ibn Sand’s effective boundaries are still uncertain, the various Yam tribes being the worst offenders against law and order. The Dawasir tribe occupies the whole tract between Kharj and Wadi and the plateau of 1 uweiq from Haddar southward. North of Haddar are small groups of Anaza, Suhul and Matara up to Hauta, which is held by the Beni Tamim, while the Aleiya section of Tuweiq is held by A1 Shamir, akin to the Ajman. The Suhul occupy Hair, while Kharj contains Qahtan and Dawasir elements. Kharj and Aflaj contain running streams fed by un fathomable lakes, while rivulets were still running in some of the Tuweiq gorges. In Kharj and Aflaj extensive remains of an old and forgotten civilisation still linger—a civilisation of which the present inhabitants know nothing. One of the principal remains is an extensive and complicated system of irrigation by Karizes, which, to Mr. Philby, suggested Persian influence. The people everywhere are “ moribund and feckless,’’ enjoying the carnal pleasures of dates, coffee and women, yet preparing themselves with great intensity, by prayer and fasting, for the pleasures of the next world. The standard of living is extremely low : meat is rarely eaten, and flour, and even rice, are practically unknown. Milk and dates are the staple diet. There is a brisk trade in Yemen coffee and piece-goods from India via Hasa. All village dwellings are of mud.The general attitude of the population towards Mr. Philby was passively unfriendly. At Dam trouble might have occurred. The messenger, sent in advance to announce the arrival of the party, was assaulted, and the villagers sent out a force to obstruct their advance. However, two days, spent in the exchange of abusive letters, satisfied the local amour propre. Seven days were spent in Wadi, but the oasis of Hauta, where the people are reported to be more aggressively insular than the other natives of Nejd, was not visited. News of the war has not penetrated Wadi, though it is reported there that a fight took place recently between Idrisi and the rmain, each of whom was accompanied by a British officer. The climate on the whole was good, very dry, hot by day, and delightfully cool at night. There were regular winds which kept down the temperature. The highest temperature recorded in Aflaj was 114°, while on many (lays in Wadi and on the plateau 100° was not reached. The minimum temperature in Kharj was 59° and in Wadi 70°. ARABIA. North-West. intelligence. Northern Area. Colonel Joyce, writing from Abu Lissal on August 13, explains the causes of the failure of the attack on Jerdun on July 21 {see p. 269). Emir Feisal appears to have guaranteed the co-operation of four or five thousand Bedouins, but the latter attended only as spectators. It was unfortunate, too, that two of the Sherifian guns broke down after firing a few rounds, and, though aeroplanes and an armoured car co-operated, the enemy cruns were not silenced, and continued to fire all day. The Sherifian infantry advanced with great dash to within three hundred yards of the enemy position, where they were held up by the converging fire of four machine guns. Despite the total lack of supports or reserves, they held their position for six hours, and finally withdrew in good order, bringing their wounded with them. The Arab losses were somewhat heavier than the Turkish, but against this must be set the considerable demolitions carried out, under cover of this attack, north and south of Jerdun. Tabia el-Hamra, which had been attacked and occupied by a small section of the Sherifian Camel Corps on July 20 {see page 269), was evacuated, in defiance of Feisal’s orders, by Sheikh Hissar and the Amran, who withdrew to Tahuna. Turks from Maan immediately re-occupied the post. A demonstration against the place was made on July 26 by two companies of the Arab army, supported by two armoured cars. The latter opened296 a hot fire on the Turks, who, according to a deserter, had six men killed and seventeen wounded, but, as little infantry support was forthcoming, the post was not re-taken. The Arabs, who lost three men killed and ten wounded, maintained a most accurate and effective bombardment. Arab activities have, so far, prevented the repair of the line north of Aneza, despite the fact that the Turks have worked on it night and day. Two demonstrations against Semna, during July, were easily repulsed. The Turkish concentration north and south of Kutrani has curtailed the activities of the Beni Sakhr from the west of the line. The Turks there detached a strong mobile force^ with artillery and machine guns, to destroy the Arabs under Sheikh Marzuk in Wadi Hasa, and on July 18, after a night march, they took up a position on the hills overlooking the wadi and opened fire on the sleeping Arabs. The latter made good their escape, losing about ten men killed and wounded : Sheikh Marzuk was wounded. The force successfully extricated itself through its mobility and the smart handling of two small mountain guns by a few Arab regulars. A comparatively small quantity of explosives and food was abandoned, but on the other hand eleven Turks were captured, and the Turk’s casualties are known to have been considerable. I hey made no attempt to hold the position, and retired to Kutrani the same night. The British and Australian Air forces attacked the usual objectives at Amman and the station at el-Kastal, direct hits being obtained on all targets. Over two tons of bombs were dropped, and several thousand rounds of small-arms ammunition were fired with good results. Southern Area. Sherif Ali reports his return to Bir Darwish after a four days engagement at Jeleijila in which he claims to have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. He says that twelve Turks deserted to him, including one officer, and that he lost two men killed and five wounded. The engagement was broken off through lack of ammunition, and damage to live guns, the damage not being due to enemy action. A later, and less prejudiced account, asserts that the Arab losses were seven killed and twenty-seven wounded, and that, of four guns damaged, two were put out of action by hostile shell-fire. A later telegram from Wejh assigns Tetid, the scene of the skirmish recorded on page 280, to a position nine miles south west of the line between Bueir and Istabl Antar. [Late News .—Deserters from Aneza station report .that the new wells there are now supplying Jurf and Aneza stations with water.■ — 297 — NOTES. Koweit-Damascus Traffic. It is reported by Mr. Philby, under date August 1, on the authority of a trustworthy informant who was recently in Hail, that Ajeimi’s caravan of eighty camels duly arrived from Koweit. It is also reported that, about the beginning of July, a caravan of. a thousand camels left Hail for Damascus bearing accumulated stores of smuggled goods. This information hardly tallies with that previously furnished by Mr. Philby (see p. 280). However, there seems little doubt that some camels left for Damascus, because it had been arranged that Ibn Leila should accompany the caravan on its return journey. Shammar and Nejd. Mr. Philby reports that Ibn Rashid shows no sign of any intention to move, and still remains at Hail. He adds the interest ing news that Ardwan ibn Ramal has asked E urki—ibn Saud s son and Commander-in-Chief (see p. 255) for aman, but Tuiki has replied that he cannot negotiate with one living in enemy territory, and that he and his followers must reside in Nejd in a place to be appointed. Ardwan ibn Ramal is unknown to us, but one Gbadhban ibn Ramal in 191(1 was reported chief of the Ramal, a sub-tribe of the Sinjarah Shammar. Probably, as Ardwan bears the tribal patronymic, he is either Ghadhban s successor or a relative. Presentation of C.M.G. to Jaafar Pasha. On August 18, at General Headquarters, the Commander- in-Chief presented the Insignia of the Order of St. Michael and St. George to Jaafar Pasha el-Askari. The ceremony was carried out on parade, with all military honours. Idrisi’s Campaign. A telegram from Aden, dated August 24, states that Arabs east of Jebel Milh ambushed and captured a Turkish convoy of thirty loaded camels, together with the rifles of the escort^ who fled in all directions.

The usual European conception of the Caliphate, on account of which the policy of many States towards the Ottoman Empire and their own Moslem subjects has been distorted, may be expressed as follows :— “ The name of Caliph signifies the supreme head of the religion of Islam, the spiritual chief of all Moslems, or, in other words, the High Priest of Islam, dhe Sultan of Constantinople is Sultan in so far as he exercises temporal power over his own Ottoman territories, and Caliph in so far as he has supreme spiritual powers over all Sunni Moslems, irrespective of their political nationality.” As a result of this completely erroneous conception, certain practical corollaries, which are equally mistaken, have arisen {a) Islamism is inconceivable without the supreme spiritual authority of the Caliph in the same way as Catholicism and the Catholic hierarchy are inconceivable without a Supreme Pontiff. (b) Therefore, in order to avoid acts of religious persecution, all European States having Moslem subjects must guarantee the liberty of their relations with the Caliph, whose authority and existence must be recognised and respected ; this in the same way as it would be impossible to prohibit spiritual inter course between Catholics and the Holy See. (c) In such cases where the Ottoman Sultan-Caliph s union of temporal power, which is limited to Ottoman terri tories, and spiritual power, which extends over all Moslems without distinction, is considered too great a danger, the policy of any European State should be directed towards obtaining or provoking among Moslems a form of declaration or pro nouncement against their supreme spiritual authority, that is against the Caliph. Furthermore, this policy should tend towards recognising as Head of Islam a person chosen among the Arabs who is subjected to the European power obtaining or provoking this declaration. The premises on which these corollaries are based are ialse. An Armenian of Constantinople, D’Ohsson, is responsible for having introduced the theory into Europe, and for having made it a sort of doctrine for European diplomacy in the nineteenth century. In his “ Tableau general de 1’Empire Ottoman ”,— 300 — published in Paris in 1788 and following years, he discusses “ The Pontiff of the Moslems ” and “ The Priestly Authority of the Sovereign.” This is not the place to enquire into the reasons of the misunderstanding; the principal one is that of language, owing to a mistake in the meaning of the Arab word Imam ; another reason may have been political, which led D’Ohsson into this serious mistake, in contradiction to the Arab texts, which he himself translates in other places. The worst of it was that this first mistaken theory had serious effects on the policy of European States. CHAPTER III. The End of the True Caliphate. The so-called Ottoman Caliphate. The Origin of the Myth of the Caliph’s Spiritual Power. The Caliphate definitely ceased to exist in 1258 a.d when Hulagu Khan and his Tatars conquered and laid waste Baghdad. They ended the Caliphate of the Abbasids whose race was destroyed. From this moment the Caliphs ceased to exist in word and deed. 1 None the less, four years later, in 1262, there appeared in Egypt an individual of dark complexion who declared he was a member of the Abbasid family and had escaped the massacre of the Tatars. The Egyptian Sultan, Baibars I (al-Bunduk- dari), of the Circassian or Bahrite dynasty of Mameluks, decided, for his own ends, to believe this individual in spite of the im probability of his story. 2 He solemnly recognised him as Caliph and obtained from him the investiture of Sultan of Egypt. 3 In this way Baibars hoped to be condoned by public opinion for having ascended the throne by murdering his pre decessor with his own hand. He also hoped to increase his personal dignity in the eyes of other Mohammedan princes, who no longer received their power at the hands of a supreme authority. Thus arose in Egypt an ephemeral Abbasid Cali phate, which was, however, purely nominal; since, in addition to not being recognised by the majority of Mohammedan sovereigns, it delegated all its power to others. This Caliphate did not even mint coins in its own name, whereas this is one of the most important emblems of sovereignty among Moslems ; it only retained the payment of certain subsidies and the in vestiture of all new Sultans of Egypt. In time some princes outside Egypt appear to have asked for their investiture at the hands of this debased Caliph, but he never possessed any religious character, or moral or material authority among the ulema.In 1517 the Ottoman Selim I conquered and overthrew the Mameluk Sultans. The Abbasid pseudo-Caliph el-Mutawakkil was brought to Constantinople as a private person but was able, after Selim’s death, to return to Egypt, where he died in 1543, or, according to others, in 1538. With him the artificial resurrection of the Abbasid Caliphate disappeared for ever. At this time the Ottoman Sultans were reaching the height of their power and were terrifying Europe. Owing to the adulation of Court writers, the title of Caliph and certain men tions of the Caliphate may be observed creeping in to the dedications of books among the long official designations of the Ottoman Sultans. This literary flattery 4 was in complete opposition to the Islamic doctrine that the Caliph had to be of Koreish origin. Documents, coins, inscriptions, etc., issued by the Sultan direct did not bear the title of Caliph among the pompous Turkish designations which only, and exceptionally, mention in a confused manner among other epithets Khilafit Benahi (“ Refuge of the Caliph ). The first case in which an Ottoman sovereign appears explicitly and officially designated as Sultan and Caliph at the same time, is in an agreement concluded with foreigners; and, even in the European version of this, the title of Caliph is shown in a new and arbitrary meaning. The agreement in question is the treaty of Kiichiik Kainarge, of June 21, 1774, between Abdul Hamid I and Catherine II of Russia. In it, Abdul Hamid appears with his titles of Sultan, but in Article 3, in which he binds himself to recognise the full independence oi the Tatars of Crimea and Kuban, he states that they, in an) case “ will behave towards him as is laid down in the laws of their religion, without, however, compromising their political or civil liberties, according to the customs of the Islamic religion as it exists among other Moslems 5 in that His Sultanic Majesty is Supreme Caliph of the Mohammedans.' The ability of the Ottoman delegates succeeded in deceiving the Russians by a non-existent spiritual sovereignty and obtaining what the treaty, according to the Russians’ intention, was to remove, namelv Turkish sovereignty over the Tatars. The Ottoman Ambassadors played on a misunderstanding and on the ignorance of their opponents. 6 They were favoured in this by the fact that the Emperor of Russia, as head of the Greek schismatic Church, assumed the role of religious patron over the Moldavians, Wallachians and other members of this Church in Ottoman territories. Hence the invention of a Caliphate or Islamic Pontiffate, held by the sovereign at Constantinople, did not appear absurd in the eyes of the Russians, but seemed rather a fair exchange. 7 Islam, however, is not what European— 302 — diplomatists in their imagination had construed it to be. According to the real laws of Islam, the only consequence which could and had to result from Article 3 of this treaty was the necessity for temporal investiture of the Khan of the Tatars, by the Sultan-Caliph, and the despatch or appointment of Kadis or judicial officials and Muftis by the Ottoman Govern ment. These consequences, however, appeared even to the Russians to have an obvious appearance of vassalage towards Turkey, and of political, but not religious, dependence. In consequence, on March 10, 1779, the Convention elucidating the treaty of Kiichuk Kainarge had to be held at Amali Kavak, near Constantinople. In the long Articles 2 and 3 an attempt is made to reconcile the recognition of a Caliph and the complete political independence of other Islamic States towards him. An absurd distinction is made between the temporal and spiritual powers of the Sultan. The dual capacity of the Ottoman sovereign and the Khalife supreme de la religion Mohametane is mentioned. Facts, however, again demon strate the absurdity of the situation, and Russia was obliged to impose on Turkey the Convention of December 28, 1783, concerning “ previous treaties and the delimitation of the Crimea ”, which abolishes Article 3 of the treaty of 1774, and Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the explanatory convention of 1779, definitely abolishing all Ottoman so-called religious or spiritual interference with the Tatars. The illusion of a religious Caliphate should, therefore, have disappeared completely among European diplomatists. But soon after appeared the evil influence of the Armenian D Ohsson, who, as stated in Chapter II, in 1788 developed the theory of the hierarchic nature of the Caliphate in Europe. This theory is absurd from the historical point of view, and one that no Moslem has ever sustained, but it proved to the Turkish Government an excellent, and unlooked for, method of regaining morally, influence which was gradually being lost materially. Above all, the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II (1876-1909), a century later than the treaty of Kiichiik Kainarge, understood how the mistake, which was already wide-spread in Europe, would allow him to work towards a position of Turkish Pan-Islamic leadership among the more than 150,000,000 Moslems subject to Christian powers. In spite of at first keeping, in official titles and on coins, only to those epithets of his Sultanic role, the Turkish Government ended by overcoming all scruples and decided, for the first time, in a document addressed to its subjects, that is,7L.U-&amp; — 303 — in the Constitution of December 24, 1876, to accept into public use the attributions of the Cahphate. Articles 3 and 4 of this Constitution read as follows :— Article 3 : The distinguished Ottoman Sultanate, which the supreme Caliph of Islam holds, shall be occupied by the eldest of the race of Osman, in accordance with ancient traditions. Article 4 : H.M. the Sultan, in that he is Caliph, is pro tector 8 of the Moslem religion. He is the Lord {huhimdar) and Sovereign {Padishah) of all Ottoman subjects. In spite of this, official documents emanating from the sovereign direct, avoid mentioning other titles than those of the Sultanate. Abdul Hamid II realised that it was illegal to assume the Caliphate before the great majority of Moslems, and was content to reach his goal indirectly. One of the means used, for example, was to print at Constantinople collections of khutbas in Arabic for Friday prayer in which his name occurs. 9 These khutbas were then recited without any omissions m Indian and Malesian Mosques, gradually giving the impression that t e Turkish Sultan was Supreme Monarch of the world of Islam. Above all, Abdul Hamid II always took care to appear as pro tector of the Moslems, even if they were subjects of European Governments, in a manner somewhat similar to that m which France has for so long taken upon herself the role of protector of Christianity in the East. Turkish Consuls playing on the European belief in the religious character of the Caliphate, have often succeeded in acquiring an excessive influence over the Moslem subjects of other States, and especially in British P Characteristic of what I have been attempting to show, are the unilateral and bilateral agreements of the two contracting narties forming the Italo-Turkish treaty of Lausanne of October 1912 The functions of the Sultan of Turkey as Caliph are solemnly accepted in the unilateral Italian agreements (Roval Decree of October 17, 1912). They are, however not mentioned in the bilateral agreements {Modus procedendi oi October 15 1912, treaty of October 18, 1912), nor m the lurkis i unilateral agreements {Firman of the Sultan, dated October 17, 1Q121 m all of which latter the sovereign of Constantinople figures purely and simply as the Sultan In a solemn treaty the Turks could not make statements which were absurd imn the Moslem point of view. Notes on Chanter 111. . . , • 1 Naturally no attention can be paid to the machinations of individual Caliphs or isolated dynasties, which never obtained recognition of their aspirations among other sovereigns. As— 304 — an instance of these may be quoted one which occurred imme diately after the fall of the Abbasids, when the Hafsite Sultans of Tunis adopted the title of Emir el Muminin —Lord of the Faithful. This is a special designation of the Cahphs; but their Caliphate never went beyond this, though they maintained their title officially till their fall in 1534 a.d. 2 Arab historians, contemporary or directly subsequent to these events, referred to the matter in a disrespectful manner. Abulfeda, writing in Syria in 1329, heads his chapter on this : “Mention of the recognition of an individual as Caliph , and, in the course of his narrative, speaks of the so-called Abbasid as “ the black Caliph.' A modern Turco-Arab, Hasan Husni el Tueirani, wrote a pamphlet in 1891 in favour of the Ottoman Caliphate, but considered the so-called Abbasid an impostor. 3 It should be noted that Baibars, not being an Arab by race and, therefore, in no way descended from the Meccan tribe of Koreish, could not himself have aspired to the Caliphate. 4 A symptom which has occurred also among other than Turkish sovereigns! 5 Quoted from the original Italian version of the treaty (see de Martens Recueil des principaux traites, Goettingen 1791-1801, Vol. IV, page 612), which alone bears the signatures and seals of the plenipotentiaries of both parties. The French translation, which the Russian Government subsequently had printed and published in 1775, renders the mistake even worse by saying : “ Ils se regleront a 1’egard de Sa Hautesse comme ‘ Grand Calife du Mohametisme ', selon les preceptes que leur present leur roi . . . ' Similarly, the other French version given by G. Moradounghian, Recueil d'actes internalionaux de VEmpire Ottoman, Paris, 1897-1903, Vol. I, page 322 : “ Et qiie S.M. Le Sultan est regarde comme le Souverain Calife de la religion Mohametane ...” The Turkish text, which was made for Moslems, could not contain a similar mistake, and therefore reads : “ Since my personal sovere : gnty maintained by equity is that of Head (Imam) of the Faithful and Caliph of those confessing the unity of God ...” Similarly, the Italian text speaks of “ customs of religion ”, and the French version : “ ceremonies of religion.” But the Turkish version reads : Umur i diniye we mezhebiye —Religious affairs pertaining to the mezheb, or of the Hanafite school of canon law (ritual, civil, judicial and penal). The Turkish text is contained in the Muahedat Megmuasi, Constantinople, 1294-1307 a.h., Vol. Ill, page 256. b Or in any case they made use of it with pleasure if what D Ohsson writes is true. He states that the credit of thesubsequent convention of Ainali Kavak is due to the Comte de Saint-Priest, the French Ambassador, “ dont la sagesse sut concilier, dans une negociation aussi epineuse, les interets de la religion d une part, et de la politique de Fautre, entre les deux puissances contractantes.” De Saint-Priest may, therefore, have been the inventor of the spiritual powers of the Caliph ! 7 This does not appear absurd to Europeans who are not versed in Moslem affairs and who look at the East through Western eyes. They are unable to imagine a defined religion without an ordered hierarchy, a religion which does not need an intermediary between the individual and God, and without spiritual powers. They seem to want at any price to find a Sovereign Pontiff in Islamism, not to speak of Bishops and Priests, and even to see in Moslem prayers something corres ponding to Mass and Christian Sacraments. 8 Note : “ Protector ” Qiami) and not “ Chief ”, which for a Sunni Moslem would constitute a heresy. See above. 9 It should be noted that in these khutbas the sovereign at Constantinople is always referred to as “ Saltan ” and not as “ Caliph ” or with the titles of Caliph, whether the prayers in question are for the Ottoman Empire or for any other country. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. There has been a dearth of military news from the Hejaz during the past week. Two bombing raids were carried out, on August 26 and 27, on Maun and Anaza stations respectively, by the Royal Air Force. It is now reported that the two airmen who were compelled to land near Shobek on August 13 {see p. 280), were captured by Sheikh Suleiman ibn Tarif and Sheikh el-Jamami. These men handed them over to Jemal Pasha at es-Salt. Southern Area. King Husein reports that the Harb have intercepted reinforce ments on their way from Muheit to Hafira. Twenty mules and some rifles were captured, and the owners were slain.- Major Davenport tells us that, stimulated by his success at Tetid {see p. 280), Abdullah sent a party to blow up the railway between Toweira and Wayban. The latter claims to have damaged two thousand rails. He then sent a party to the north,— 306 — ctiid claims to have blown up a similar number of rails at bail Matran. Two charges are used to a, rail by the Arabs, so that about one thousand rails were destroyed in each case—equivalent to about five kilometres of railway line. NOTES. King Husein and Fakhri Pasha. On August 19, King Husein addressed a letter to Fakhri Pasha, in which he points out the hopelessness of the garrison’s position, accentuated by the recent fall of Mudawwara. There follows a catalogue of trifling successes scored by the Sherifians, concluding with a scornful reference to the condition of Fakhri’s men, captured near Tuweira, whose food was hibnah, a herb beloved of goats ! Responsibility for further bloodshed must rest on Fakhri, but, if he will surrender with all his men and give up all arms, military and railway material, the King guarantees not only their safety, but also the inviolability of their personal property and effects. Fakhri himself will be conveyed with all honour' and consideration to a special place of internment in Egypt, where increased comfort awaits him. “ 1 take God and the Angels of His throne to witness,” says Husein, “ that every promise made herein will be fulfilled to the letter.” 1 he Medina Commander is given one week to make up his mind ; the King warns him that no discussion of terms and no half-measures will be tolerated. The tone of the letter, rightly severe, is hardly tactful. The King’s reference to “your obstinacy in pouring out the blood of innocent Moslems in Galicia” was uncalled for ; and the choice of the word mutaqal (though now used quite frequently for “internment camp,” it smacks of the prison) is hardly likely to appeal to a man of Fakhri’s mould. As all reports show that the prolonged resistance of the garrison is in no small measure due to this man’s proud and resourceful spirit, it is, perhaps, a pity that he was not spared these pinpricks. Ibn Saud-Ajman-Aslam-Kuweit Blockade. In order to deal with Ibn baud’s complaints about the blockade and the Ajman, the following measures have been taken. All permits for goods exported to Nejd will be signed by our blockade officer, on a voucher and demand from Ibn baud’s agent. Goods for Iraq tribes will only be sent when the demand is supported by a letter from their Political officers, and the Koweit tribes must have their demands, on the basis of their minimum requirements, backed bv the sheikh himself. With regard to Ibn baud’s complaint against the Ajman, measures have been taken to summon their six leading sheikhs, who will be told that further support from us will*entirely dependon their behaviour. They must give a fresh undertaking in writing not to cross the Anglo-Koweit boundary, giving approved hostages as a guarantee of the fulfilment of the promise. The Aslam and the other four sections of the Shammar now in our sphere, will, similarly, be called on to provide hostages for their good conduct, and must understand that they may not enter or camp in Koweit territory, nor raid east of the Batin—Koweit s western boundary—and a line prolonged from the head of the Batin to Zubeir. There is little doubt but that the sheikhs concerned will demand that similar restrictions be placed by Ibn Sand on tribes with whom they are at feud. The Suhai of Khurma. The following geographical and tribal information about Khurma is taken from a telegram of Mr. Philby’s dated June 6, which has only just reached us by post. It should be compared with the information from the same source given on page 74. The permanent population of Khurma is about three thousand, mostly negroes ; but the owners of the palm groves, Bedouin of the Subai tribe, swell the population in the date season to ten thousand. The Subai is a tribe with some sections m eastern Neid on the Anna plateau, and the remainder between Wadi Naim and Shaib Shaba. This tract includes Khurma and Wadi Subai, and is bounded by the Ateiba on the east and north, and by the Buqum and Qahtan on the west and south respectively, the Ikhwan movement has made considerable progress among the Subai, who have a flourishing settlement at Dhabaa in K harj, which was founded last year, and contains five hundred armed men ; while the Subai of Khurma have adopted the Ikhwan tenets more or less en bloc. [Note by Arab Bureau: From information supplied to Colonel Lawrence {see page 245) it appears that onlv some sections of the Subai have gone over to the Wahhabis, and that those who held out against their propaganda were expelled by Emir Khalid, who proposed to hand over their properties to converted peasants.] Billi and Moahib. In continuation of his notes, published on page 221, Bimbashi Bright sends the following information about the Rifada family: ° “ The family is divided into two main branches: on the one side, the sons of Suleiman Pasha, and on the other side Hamid ibn Rifada and his brothers Mohammed, Hamud and Rashid. There is an old quarrel between the two parties—a blood feud. About eight years ago, at a time when Hamid and his brothers were taking refuge with the Huweitat, a raid occurred between the Billi and the Huweitat in which another brother of Hamid (not mentioned above) was killed. Ihe King patched up a tem porary peace between the two branches during the recent visit of Ibrahim and Hamid to Mecca. Since this visit Ibrahim and his308 — brothers receive £90 each per month from the King, and Hamid receives £40, but there is no love lost between them. Hamid’s followers number six hundred of the Maagla sub-tribe of Billi. Hamid is not very popular : he looks rather villainous and has a wall-eye. There was a certain amount of friction recently between the children of Suleiman Pasha (four sons and two daughters) when his estate was being divided and the Sherifian sarraf at Wejh was called in by the family to give a ruling. The sum total of camels owned by Suleiman Pasha was ninety, but he had a good deal of small cattle. He had £ 1,000 debts in the suq at Wejh. Another enemy of the Rifada family is Hammad Mongara, Sheikh of the Barakat, the largest sub-tribe of Billi. Before Suleiman Pasha’s time, Hammad Mongara’s people held the over-lordship of the Billi. The King was said to be very averse to appointing a head- sheikh of Billi when Suleiman Pasha was killed. His idea was to sit on the fence and offer the sheikhship to whoever showed up best in the war. The total males of Billi are put at 10,000-12,000.” Ldrisi’s Affairs. Nash* ed-Din, writing from Medi on August 3, reports that about eleven hundred and fifty Jebelis arrived there under the leadership of Nash* Mabkhut and Jabran el-Gashum. They demanded a monthly salary of fourteen dollars with a daily allowance of a quarter of a dollar for coffee, sugar, etc. besides the usual ration of flour. On Idrisi’s refusing the daily allowance, they left Medi in disgust; but they were recalled and negotiations are proceeding. Idrisi, in a letter to Colonel Wood dated July 30, says that it was not Glialib Bey who was killed (as reported on page 282) but his staff officer. Damascus-Hail Caravan Traffic. It was reported by Colonel Leach man on August 27, that a caravan from Damascus to Hail was recently held up, one hundred and forty miles west of Kubeisa, by the Suqur, a section of Amarat Anaza. The caravan, which was conveying two mountain guns, rifles and ammunition, fifty thousand liras and supplies of clothing, was allowed to proceed on payment of a bribe of one thousand liras. Yemen. On August 24, the Resident at Aden forwarded a report that the l urks have handed over to the Imam, the whole of the Yemen as far as Dhala and Qataba. Representatives of the Imam, with one hundred Zeidis, are reported to be at Lahej. From the Abdali Sultan come the reports that Mahmud Nadim,— 809 — Toveinor of the Yemen, has arrived in Lahej with a man of considerable influence in the Sanaa district, one Seyyid Kasim el-Aziz, overseer of lVaIjs, who is said to be the Imam’s repre- sentative ; and that Sherif Abdullah ed-Domain has arrived in the laiz district with a force of Zeidis. His purpose is unknown and enquiries are being made. If the news of the lurkish bargain with the Imam is to be ciedited rumours of the probability of such a transaction have been current in the past—a possible interpretation is that the I urks hope, if driven back by a column from Aden, to secure their retreat by making a virtue of necessity in handing over territory they cannot hold. Sheikh Abdullah (see p. 282) states that the Governor of the Yemen visited Ibb in April and May last, and he thinks that then a bargain was made that the Turks should hand over the whole of the hwa of Taiz, which includes the districts of Ibb, Ldain, el-Kameira, el-Hajaria and Qataba, to the Imam in exchange for a loan. It is probable that Sheikh Abdullah came down to Aden to endeavour to come to terms with us before the agreement was ratified. Both he and the Sheikh of Udein are averse to being under the Imam, and would resist to the utmost. From Kameran comes the report that owing to a quarrel between Ghalib Bey, Yahya Ali ibn Thawwab and Hadi ibn Ahmed el-Heij, chief of the Waazat, the latter has ceased to support the Turks. The report is confirmed by an agent, who states that the Turks and their partisans were removed from Abs to Jebel Milh. The importance of this news, if it can be relied on, is obvious.SECRET. fill ' 1 No. 103. Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, September 10, 1918. , 111 SUMMARY. THE C A LIPH ATE —co u tinned. ARABIA.

The Ottoman Caliphate and the Treaty of Lausanne. The mistaken conceptions concerning the nature of the Caliphate of Islam and the so-called Caliph of Constantinople, among European diplomatists, have been discussed and criti cised in Chapters II and III. They were, however, accepted in the various agreements which went to form the treaty of Lausanne of October 18, 1912. This treaty presupposes 1 :— 1. —That the Sultan of Turkey is also Caliph (Article 2 of the Royal Decree, October 17, 1912). See the whole of Chapter III. 2. —That the Caliph is supreme head of the Moslem religion and of the ecclesiastical hierarchy (implied in the above- mentioned article, and also in paragraph 2 of the Modus Pro- cedendi of October 15, 1912). See, however, Chapters I and II, and the second half of Chapter III. 3. —That calling down the Blessing of God on the name of the Caliph in the Friday Khutba, is a recognition of his spiritual powers, and, therefore, religious homage on the part of the Faithful (Article 2 of the Royal Decree mentioned above). See, however, end of Chapter I. 4. —That the Chief Kadi of the territory is the chef religieux, or, in other words, a sort of Bishop depending from the Caliph— or Pope of the Moslems ; also that the Naib or local Kadis are a sort of chefs religieux, or Parish Priests, depending from the Kadi (Article 2 of the above-mentioned Royal Decree, and paragraph 2 of the Modus Procedendi). It is, on the other hand, perfectly well known that the Kadi and his Naib are merely magistrates administering justice, according to the canon law of Islam, in the name and place of the Sovereign who nominates them, and who can replace them as he likes. See, however, Chapter I, and, for example, Articles 1800 and 1801 of the Megella, or Ottoman civil code, besides any manual of Mohammedan law. The result is that the Treaty of Lausanne leads to the following consequences :— (a) The Italian Government, in recognising officially the existence of a Caliph, and in obliging its North African subjects to mention him in their Khutba, has declared its occupation of Libya illegal, and has proclaimed the Caliph the true sovereign of the population.r -- — 312 — ,4 rl (6) In obliging its Libyan subjects to recognise, in the hultan of Turkey, the existence of a Caliph, the Italian Govern ment was running counter to the belief of a large proportion •of its subjects, who themselves realised that the Sultan lacked one at least of the essential requisites of a Caliph according to Moslem tradition. B (c) In admitting that the Chief Caliph of Libya should be nominated by the Sheikh ul-Islam at Constantinople, 2 and in deciding that his salary should be paid by the Imperial Turkish Government (paragraph 2 of the Modus Procedendi, and Firman o the Sultan), and, finally, m agreeing to the nomination of no local Kadis by the Chief Kadi, the Italian Government lam ed over the native legal administration to a foreign Government and renounced no small part of its own sovereign ghts. It further confirmed the illegality of its occupation of Libya and placed in a foreign Government’s hands the whole of the Wakf Administration of the country. The lta lian Government came to admit a sort of vice- Sultanate in Libya by accepting the following conditions By allowing a special representative of the Sultan, in his apacity as Caliph, for the so-called safeguarding of religious Procedltd^ 1 ^ f 1 ! 1 ' 0 *! 11 ’ and P ara g ra P h 2 the Modus become^h’ °h\ a i he I ? per,al Firmm cal!s him . and, as has ome the habit in subsequent publications of the Italian ScTe'that - 5 b7 fUrther admittin g&gt; ^ a special cle, that le susdit representant est aussi reconnu a I’effet ottohant t e V m . t ^ et h d \ 1 ’ Empire Ottoman et des sujets ottomans ...

In 1912 , however’— 313 — soon after the Italian occupation, the inhabitants of Tripoli asked for and obtained, first verbally and then officially, the re-introduction of Malakite law (Decree by General Caneva, commanding the Expeditionary Force, dated July 30, 1912). In the Treaty of Lausanne, this point was not brought up ; but if the various articles were applied in their entirety, the Hanafite Kadi would come from Constantinople, and would nominate his local judges according to the Hanafite school. So, despite a solemn promise made to the inhabitants, the latter form of Moslem justice would again be observed. The Treaty of Lausanne, like that of Kiichuk Kainarje, founded, as it was, on mistaken premises in complete contradiction of existing Islamic institutions, was immediately seen to be unrealisable. Its application would have meant a continual depreciation of Italian sovereignty. Steps had to be taken that neither the Kadi should be nominated, nor that he should appoint the local judges ; on the other hand, in his absence, the administration of native justice and of the Wakfs became irregular. The result of this situation was that a series of difficult questions arose with the Ottoman Government and with the native population. They were only ended by the new declaration of war with Turkey, followed by the annulment of the agreements of Lausanne (Loyal Decree, August 22, 1915). This bears a striking similarity to the end of the Kiichuk Kainarje agreements. It is interesting to note how little attention Turkey paid to real religious interests in her negotiations with Italy. In the Treaty of Lausanne no mention is made of the Reis ul- Ulema, the College of Ulema, Muftis, Imams, or-other persons having real religious functions devoid of political interests. According to the Treaty of Lausanne, on the other hand, the “ religious chiefs ” are the Caliph and the Kadi. It appears worth while repeating that this error in considering the Caliph and the Kadi “ religious chiefs occurs only in the unilateral Italian agreements of Lausanne ; the Turks were careful not to introduce heresies of this nature in unilateral Turkish or bilateral agreements. Attention is again drawn in this matter to the various editions of Article 3 of the Treaty of Kuchiik Kainarje. Certain newspapers and politicians attempted to justify the phraseology of the Treaty of Lausanne by declaring that it conformed with the agreement between Austria-Hungary and Turkey over the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (F'ebruary 26, 1909). In reality, the only similarity is the right of having the khutba said for the Sultan “ in his capacity of Caliph.” This is a right which has survived from the period 1877- 1908 of the Austro-Hungarian administration under Ottoman— 314 — sovereignty, and is, in a country where Mohammedans number only one-third of the total population, of considerably less importance than in Libya, where the population is entirely Moslem. So far as the rest of the agreement is concerned the difference is considerable. The Turkish Government explicitly recognised the complete sovereignty of Austria-Hungary over Bosnia-Herzegovina, 5 which she was never willing to do, so far as Italy was concerned, over Libya. There are no traces there fore in the Turco-Austrian Treaty of those manifestations of Ottoman sovereignty which were accepted in the Treaty of Lausanne. There is no question of the despatch of a Naib-ul- Sultan, nor of a Kadi, and, therefore, no interference in the legal or Wakf administration of Herzegovina. In the Bosniac organisation there is a faint trace of a Reis ul-Ulema, but in this case he has an entirely religious function and is head of a commission of ulema or doctors, instituted to supervise the religion and practice of Islam. This individual is appointed by the Emperor of Austria from three candidates proposed by a Bosniac commission of Austrian subjects. The commission, after the appointment on the part of the Emperor, requests a certificate of investiture for the new official from the Sheikh ul-Islam at Constantinople. The candidate must be an Austro- Hungarian subject and can be removed by the Emperor. It is apparent, therefore, that there is no similarity between the Bosniac Reis ui-Ulema and the Libyan Kadi. At the Treaty of Lausanne the Ottoman plenipotentiaries succeeded in distorting, to the advantage of their own country, certain ambiguous and innocent formulae of the Turco-Austrian protocol of 1909. In Article 4 we read : “ Les droits des fondations pieuses (wakf) seront respectes, comme par le passe, et aucune entrave ne sera apportee aux rapports des musulmans avec leurs chefs spirituels qui dependront comme toujours du Cheik-ul-Islamat a Constantinople lequel donnera Finvestiture au Beis-ul-Ulema.'’ But the protocol in no place explains what these chefs spirituels are. Since, however, with the exception of the above-mentioned formal investiture of the Reis-ul-Ulema, there are no traces of any relations between Moslem officials and Constantinople, and since the Ulema, to whom alone the title of spiritual heads could be applied, are private savants (see above), it is perfectly clear that the Austro- Hungarian Government made no concessions, with the exception of some phrases devoid of meaning. This was possible for two reasons. The Young Turks, who had only recently come into power, were imbued with superficial western ideas and almost incredibly ignorant of Moslem affairs. Again, one of the two Ottoman delegates who signed the agreements, was the ChristianArmenian, Gabriel Noradounghian. The paragraph recently quoted, which, as we have seen, was only a clever piece of flattery on the part of the Austrian Government, was transformed into the following in Article 2 of the Royal Decree of October 17, 1912 : “ Les droits des fondations pieuses (wakf) seront respectes comme par le passe et aucune entrave sera apportee aux relations des Musulmans avec le chef religieux appele Cadi, qui sera nomine par le Cheik-ul-Islamat et avec les Naibs nommes par lui-meme ...” After what has been said above, nothing need be added to show that, instead of following in the footsteps of the Turco-Austrian agreement, as we believed, the opposite was accomplished. 6 Notes on Chapter I V. 1 As I said in the preceding paragraph, the mistaken premises are only to be found in the Italian versions of the Treaty. 2 So Article 2 of the Royal Decree quoted. But the Firman of the Sultan of the same date says : “ Nous nous reservons . . . la nomination du Cadi. ,, 3 That is to say “ vicar ” or “ substitute ” of the Sultan. The ambiguity was evidently desired by the Ottoman delegates to give the impression of a “ Vice-Sultan.” 4 In the eyes of Moslems this was all the more evident, as the Turkish Government in none of its bilateral or unilateral agreements recognised Italian sovereignty over Libya. It only conceded “ une pleine et entiere autonomie ” to the population of Cyrenaica and Tripoli {Firman of the Sultan). 5 Article 2 of the protocol reads : “ . . . Le Gouvernement ottoman reconnait d'une facon expresse le nouvel etat de choses en Bosnie-Herzegovine cree par la dite decision.” (This refers to the autograph letter of the Emperor, Francis Joseph I, to Count Aehrenthal, his Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Emperor hereby declared that his sovereignty extended over Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that these territories were, therefore, annexed to Austria-Hungary.) 6 It should be noted that, by virtue of the Austro-Turkish Treaty of April 21, 1879, during the whole period of Austrian administration (1879-1908) under the dominion of Ottoman sovereignty, the chief Kadi sent by the Turkish Government for Bosnia-Herzegovina, resided at Sarajevo. The protocol of 1909 suppressed him.ARABIA. North-West Intelligence. Northern Area. Considerable execution was done at Akaba by two hostile aeroplanes which appeared from the direction of Tebuk on August 26. Our aeroplanes endeavoured to engage them, but were unable to get into touch with them.. The casualties reported are thirteen killed and eighteen wounded ; in addition eighteen animals were killed and wounded. On September 5 and 6 the Turks made two attacks on Farah el-Hasa, seven miles west of el-Hasa station. On both occasions they were driven back with loss. Of the Arabs two or three men were killed and several wounded. On the night of September 7 the enemy carried out night attacks north and south of the Sherifian positions at Semna. To the south they failed completely, losing ten men killed besides an unknown number of wounded ; on the north they were successful in effecting a temporary lodgment in the Arab position, but were driven out by a counter-attack the following morning. Southern Area. There has been a satisfactory revival in the activities of the southern force. Twenty-one deserters have come in from Meshed, of whom two are officers. They report that the con viction that they are abandoned to their fate is spreading among the garrison. Sherif Abdullah reports that, on September 1, a train was wrecked near Abu IsTaam. Sixteen Turks were killed and ten captured, and the engine was destroyed. In this sector, says Abdullah, the Turks have only four engines left. He reports on September 9 that he attacked the Turkish positions at Mahulia and Sadikia, killing nine Turks and capturing forty-three. Hasan ibn Safar, of the Wuld Mohammed section of the Harb, was in command of the Sherifians. Mahulia and Sadikia are nakhls in the neighbourhood of Medina.317 — NOTES.

He paid him three months’ allowance in advance, and, in C A 0 f;i im ci tl0n Wlth I ^ v n Saud ’ arran ged that Dhari should harry the Abda Shammar Dhari was to write a monthly letter reporting progress. Mr. Philby reports that, a month later, Dhari wrote to Him from bafwan, and it appears that before leaving Hafar he signed a pass for about five hundred camel-loads of goods which passed through his blockade to Hail. Later, on July 10, Mr. Philby points out the real significance ol Dhari s move from Hafar. It appears that when Mr. Philby, Ibn baud and Dhari were together, the Emir took Dhari into Ins confidence with regard to Turki’s contemplated attack on the Abda and binjara and charged him on no account to leave Halar; and if the Shammar retired before Turin, to cut off their retreat. Dhari, who, it appears, had provisionally accepted rnendly overtures from the Sinjara shortly after Mr. Philby’s departure for Dawasir, was loth to go to war with the Shammar the s P here o£ operations. The result was that the Abda, withdrawing before Turki’s advance on the Aiibba wells, leached, unmolested, the Bashuk and Hidaqa wells south of Lina. n i n U i 1 p ?P ued the Shammar to Bashuk, to find that they had tied to Lma, three days distant. The Bashuk wells could not supply the needs of Turki’s force, and he, therefore, returned to Apbba, and thence to Bureida, declining the risk of a march to Lma, with only the inadequate watering-place of Mardhuma between Thus ended the first phase of Ibn Sand’s campaign against the outlying Shammar. Elsewhere, Mr. Philby writes under date July 11 :— . U Turki opened the anti-Shammar campaign about the eginmng of Ramadan. He concentrated at Artawiya with six bairaqs (nominally one thousand apiece), supplied by the Ikhwan or Artawiya, Ghat-Ghat, Fureithan, and contingents from Riyadh Rharj, Dareiya and Dhruma, with, perhaps, other oddments ”.

In consequence of this, the King has closed the Hejaz markets to them. The Dhawi Hasan have replied by looting caravans coming from, or going to, the Hejaz, and holding up and levying toll on, all Hejaz dhows returning from the Asir coast. Doubtless, we have here the explanation of the report on page 272, where we correctly guessed that the Dhawi Hasan Ashraf were intended. ISECRET. ARAB BULLETIN. No. 104.SECRET.

The Arguments in favour of the Ottoman Caliphate and the Possession of the Holy Places. The first and most important condition for the existence of a Caliph at the present day is not only that he should have absolute territorial sovereignty, but that also the majority of Mohammedans should recognise him, that is to say, that other Moslem rulers, Sultans, Khans, Beys, Emirs, etc., should consider themselves nominally vassals and should derive their legal right to rule from his regular investiture. In the absence of this condition it is evident that a Caliph cannot exist, but he can only be an individual aspiring to the Caliphate. It is well known that no independent Mohammedan prince in Arabia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, etc., 1 has ever applied, or ever does apply, to the Sultan of Constantinople to legalize his own sovereignty through investiture. This is a clear sign that to-day the princes of Islam do not recognise the effective existence of a Caliphate, Ottoman or otherwise. A second condition, based on history and on the sayings attributed to Mohammed, is the public canon law of Islam which required the Caliph to be descended from the tribe of Koreish, to which Mohammed, and the majority of his con temporaries living at Mecca, belonged. This essential condition is not found among the Turkish sovereigns. The question may therefore be asked : how were the Sultans of Constantinople able to become Caliphs ? European books do not discuss the first difficulty, and state that the second was overcome as follows : When Selim I conquered Egypt in 1517 and brought the so-called Abbasid Caliph el-Mutawakkil (see Chapter III) to Constantinople, he obliged him to renounce in his favour the right to the Caliphate. If this were true, the cession would have been illegal and void from the Moslem point of view. 2 As a matter of fact, this is a mere story which European authors have found quoted in D’Ohsson’s book of 1788. No mention is made in the abundant Arab and Turkish contemporary chronicles of an event of such capital importance in the Mohammedan world, 3 nor is there any indication of it in official or other histories compiled at any later date by Turks or Arabs. In other words, to find the first mention of this event, recourse must be had— 322 — to contemporary Moslem writers who have discovered the in cident in a European book. The silence of historians is confirmed by what has been stated in Chapter III, namely, that, officially speaking, the Sultan of Constantinople appeared for the first time as Caliph in the Treaty of 1774 with Russia. Even here the title is only used as a clever diplomatic subterfuge to deceive the Russians and to maintain sovereignty over the Tatars, who had been declared independent. In the eyes of his own Moslem subjects the Sultan was proclaimed Caliph for the first time in the constitution of 1876. In Europe another argument is adduced in favour of the Ottoman Caliphate, It is only germinating in D’Ohsson’s book, but was viewed as of great importance by several politi cians after the outbreak of the European War. I refer to the effective possession of the Holy Places of Islam, that is to say, of the holy territories (haram) of Mecca and of Medina, which their respective Sherifs (Barakat Ibn Mohammed, so far as Mecca was concerned), ceded to Selim I in 1517. 4 The argument is ingenious, but mixes the cause with the effect. A prince does not obtain the right to become Caliph by the fact of his possess ing the Holy Places ; but, on the other hand, he who is recognised as Caliph by the community of Islam becomes, ipso iure, Lord of the Holy Places as of all territories inhabited by Moslems. He has the right to govern them directly or to delegate the rule to some other prince by investing him with the power, and, in this case, maintaining for himself only the supreme sovereignty. In the time of the Caliphate the absolute independence of the Holy Places, as of any other territory of Islam, would have been legally inadmissible. It would have been an abnormal condition and an act of rebellion ; but one in no way infringing the legal theory of the Caliphate. 5 The Caliphs, even without armed intervention, would have ended in obtaining recognition from the rebels themselves under pressure of Moslem' public opinion. If the Sultan of Turkey had really been Caliph, the present revolt of the Sherif of Mecca with his proclamation as King of the Hejaz, which, as a matter of fact, he only occupies in part, would have had no effect on the Caliph’s position or dignity. Notes on Chapter V. 1 There is no need to mention that the inhabitants of Morocco have always opposed any attempted interference in their affairs on the part of the Turks, and any aspirations to the Caliphate on the part of the Ottoman Sultans. Characteristic of this is the fact that in Algeria, during the Turkish domination r A.B23 and during their protectorate, which only ceased on the French occupation, the sovereign at Constantinople was considered as a Sultan and not as a Caliph. Phis is evident not only from historians, but also from the inscriptions of public monuments, which entirely omit the characteristic designations of the Caliph. 2 This for the following reasons : (a) That a Caliph cannot abdicate in favour of another person, but may only, and in agreement with the Moslem community, designate his successor as stated in Chapter I. (b) That, in any case, baia {see Chapter I) in favour of the Caliphate of Selim I would have been necessary ; it never took place, (c) That Selim I, being a Turk and not of Koreish origin, could never have become a Caliph. 3 These inform us that Selim I, the conqueror of Egypt and Syria, liked being called “ servant of the Holy Places ”, a title until then used by the Mameluk Sultans of Egypt. 4 This occurred when Selim I conquered Egypt and Syria and brought to a close the Mameluk, Circassian or Bahrite dynasties reigning there. Mecca and Medina were under the sovereignty of the Mameluks. When they fell, the Sherifs of the two holy cities made haste to recognise the sovereignty of the conqueror, and it is even recorded that the son of Sherif Barakat, head of the Embassy sent to do homage to Selim, presented him at Alexandria in the month of May or June, 1517, with the keys of the Kaaba on a silver plate. Naturally this is only a recognition of sovereignty over the Holy Places, and not a recognition of the Caliphate, as has recently been stated in Europe by many after D’Ohsson. 6 History quotes many cases in which Mecca with or without Medina, for shorter or longer periods, was not under the sover- eignty of the Caliphs : among other instances during the last years of the fourth Caliph Ali, who reigned in 656-661 a.d., owing to the activities of Othman’s party ; again from 681-692, during the Caliphate of Abd el-Malik, through the activities of the anti-Caliph Abd Allah Ibn el-Zubair; again in the tenth century through the heretical Qarmatians; and again in the thirteenth century in the course of the Zeidite Imams of Sanaa. But nobody ever concluded from these facts that the rights of the Caliph and the Caliphate had lapsed.— 324 — CHAPTEE YI. The Consequences of the Mistaken European Conception oi the Existence and Nature of the Caliphate. From what has been said in Chapter I it is apparent that the recognition of the Sultan of Constantinople, or any other Islamic prince, as Caliph, signifies for all true Moslems a ^ co g' nition of political, and not spiritual, sovereignty over all the followers of Mohammed, including the subjects of European powers. It further signifies seeing in him a Monarch, who, with the help of God, will eventually restore the unity of all the Faithful, and will gradually liberate them from the yoke of the infidels and from all those innovations contrary to the Skeria, which they have introduced into Moslem territories. In other words, to recognise a Caliph is to give grounds for hoping in a final and complete conquest of the European world by the Mohammedan. For Moslems, the Caliphate had been dead for centuries and was only a glorious memory of a better age. The resus citation of the idea during the last century is due to the lack of knowledge of Moslem affairs displayed by European Govern ments. It was believed that the sympathy of all those Moslems subject to European dominion might be obtained by safeguarding their spiritual welfare in providing a Caliph who was thought to be the High Priest of Islam. Europeans ingenuously believed that this High Priesthood pertained to the monarch at Con stantinople who could at one and the same time be temporal Sultan of Ottoman territories and spiritual Caliph of all Mohammedans. During the second half of the nineteenth century the Moslems began to take advantage of this mistake in Europe. Turkey by now was the only Mohammedan State capable in any way of withstanding the Christian Powers, and to whom the Sunni Moslem reaction against European extension an extension which was slowly swallowing up Moslem territories and attempt ing to impose its wishes on the few still independent States could look with any degree of faith. Thus, with the assistance of European ignorance, Abdul Hamid II began his well-conceived Pan-Islamic policy. The Caliphate and political Pan-Islamism are one and the same thing. We have seen at the end of Chapter I how the faithful, subject to European States, in offering prayers to the Sultan as Caliph on Fridays, are not performing an act of grace towards their own spiritual head, but are rendering political homage to him, thereby implicitly declaring Christiansovereignty unlawful. As Snouck Hurgionje has repeatedly written, the Sultan receives recognition of his aspirations through the ignorance of European Powers, in a manner different from that which they intended, yet more consonant with the historical and legal principles of the Mohammedan religion. The majority of Sunnis ; in their need of a political centre of action against Europe, waive the difficulties which their own doctrines raise against the Caliphate of the Ottoman Sultans. Anyone following the native press must be aware that those Mohammedans who are not Ottoman subjects turn towards Turkey, not because they believe the Moslem faith in danger, but because they hope for the eventual restoration of the unity and political independence of Islam. It would be easy to quote innumerable examples of this, but I will content myself with an extract from a long anti-Italian article written by an Indian at one time residing in Cyrenaica, and published in the Cairo Nationalist newspaper El-Alam. on September 25, 1912. In discussing the rumours of peace in the near future between Italy and Turkey, the writer sorrowfully draws attention to the continual European occupation of Moslem territories. He declares that Turkey is the only State capable of resisting similar disasters, and concludes : “ My belief in this is due to the fact that Khutbas are recited in the name of H.M. the Sultan m all the territories of Islam, though the Ottoman Government does not hold them in its effective dominion. 1 It would be difficult to be more explicit than this. In accepting the Ottoman or any other Caliphate, Moham medans are fully aware that they are deceiving their Christian masters, and that they are living in a chronic state of political protest. It is really rather curious that European States should be competing with one another to revive artificially an institution which died of its own accord many centuries ago, and which, in its existence, is completely opposed to their own sovereignty over regions inhabited by Mohammedans. I cannot repeat too often that the Caliphate is nothing but a universal sovereignty of Islam, or, in other words, a form of political Pan-Islamism. The doctors or Ulema, whose duty it is to maintain the unity and integrity of their religious doctrines, have never had spiritual, moral or bureaucratic relations with the Caliphs. For a European State with Mohammedan subjects the recognition of the Caliph does not signify a provision for their religious or spiritual needs, but merely an introduction into its government of a germinating, but nevertheless, dangerous foreign sovereignty. The risk of serious political trouble is run in the event of the majority of Mohammedan people recognising a different Caliph. Lastly, it contributes to the maintenanceamong Mohammedans of the faith, that at some possibly not far distant time, that glorious past, when the infidel States trembled before the world-wide power and conquests of Islam, may dawn for them again. Note to Chapter VI. 1 An exaggeration on the part of the writer, since, in Morocco, in Algeria (after the French occupation), in the independent Arabian States and in those of Central Asia, Khutbas have never been offered for the Sultan of Turkey. SOUTHERN NEJD AND DAWASIR. We gave on page 294 a telegraphic summary of Mr. Philby’s report on his trip to Southern Nejd and Dawasir. His full report has just come to hand, but we do not propose to publish it in extenso until we receive the map, which is being copied, in Baghdad. To future geographers and students of Arabian affairs, a study of Mr. Philby’s travels and researches will be indispensable. The following extracts from his report are of general interest, and are quoted pending the publication of the work as a whole :— It is not surprising that Kharj, saturated as its soil must be by the floods brought down into the valley year after year by a great drainage system is, or rather I should say once was, a fertile tract renowned for its prosperity. That prosperity is but a dim memory now, having long given way to decay which broods over the scattered evidences of a glorious past, inscrutable as Fate, intensified by a century of strife only recently ended. Yamama, that great city of the past, is choked with sand ; Firzan and a nameless city on the eastern ridge, both of an older date than Yamama, are now but heaps of debris, and the life-giving springs of water are nearly dead from disuse or misuse ; in fact, the northern section of the valley is a sorry sight, and the scene of prosperity, on a greatly modified scale, has shifted to the central part of the district where Dilam, the modern capital, is surrounded by a number of fairly prosperous settlements, entirely dependent on wells. Apart from the fact that it is one of the most important drainao;e collecting centres in Arabia, the distinctive features of the Kharj valley, whose height above sea-level rises from 1.400* feet at the north-eastern corner to some 1,700* feet * these and all like figures will probably have to be reduced, as my aneroid on this occasion gave 1,950 as the lowest height of Riyadh, whereas on my previous journey my results placed Riyadh at only 1,750 feet above sea-level.at its apex to the south, are the spring of Firzan with the subterranean aqueduct or Kariz of the ordinary Persian type [here called Kharaz or Saji (Saqi)] leading from it to the gardens of Sulaimiya and a series ot three bottomless, presum ably spring-fed reservoirs, from one of which flows a perennial, but exiguous, supply of water in a narrow open channel called Saih, which irrigates the lucerne fields of Ibn Sand’s stud farm of Qurain, while subterranean aqueducts like that of Firzan, but now run dry, connect the other two with the same channel. These reservoirs, known collectively as the Aiyun of Kharj, are situated close together about six miles south of Sulaimiya under the cliff of the Biyadh (the central reservoir called Ain al Dhila lying in a gaping cleft at the foot of the cliff itself), and it is, I firmly believe, to them that the district owes its name, though local etymology is not with me and derives the name from the fact that in days long past this valley was the source (makhraj) of the corn supply of Mecca ! I base m}^ opinion, which involves a change of spelling (namely Kharq, meaning a cleft) but none of pronunciation, on the analogy of the name of Ajiaj derived from a precisely similar phenomenon, on that of at least three localities called Khafs, all of which are named from natural reservoirs in great rock clefts attributed to the falling of stars, and generally on the fact that Arab geographical nomenclature is so largely based, for very natural reasons, on phenomena affecting the water supply. An actual instance of the use of the word Kharq to signify a cleft of this kind is supplied by the extraordinary grotto hill called Makhruq which is one of the sights of the Riyadh oasis. However, whatever the etymology of the name may be, there is no doubt whatever that these two sources of perennial irrigation were the backbone of the district in the. past and the cause of its great prosperity. Each of them is overlooked by the debris of a forgotten city ; the one astride of the northern extremity of the Firzan ridge, and the other ou the summit of the cliff behind the reservoirs. The very situation of these cities, raised well above the level of the plain in strange contrast to the settlements of the present day huddled up in the middle of the various oases, suggests the sojourn of an alien race. Moreover, the debris that remains is not of the mud buildings known to the modern Arab, but of stone and mortar, disposed in countless circles of various sizes, each outlined by large blocks of stone round its circumference, the interior space being filled in with rubble and mortar and generally traversed by a diameter of stone blocks similar to those of the circumference. The circles rise to a point at the centre about four or five feet above ground-level, giving the appearance of a vast number of cairns set in rows along the slopes of the ridge. Their average diameter seemed to be about six to ten yards, while the biggest I saw was no less than forty-five yards across and about six feet high in the centre, with huge blocks of rock round the circumference,— 328 — and a traverse of similar blocks running north and south across it, broken by a central gap facing east and west; in the inter stices between the traverse and the circumference lesser circles were scattered about. Of the two groups of ruins that of Firzan is the more perfect and distinctive, owing to the greater use in its construction of large blocks of stone, whereas the circles of the other are largely of rubble and smaller stones. Finally, the effect of foreign influence is enhanced by the solid workmanship of the subterranean aqueducts and the intricate irrigation system of which they form part ; the type is found elsewhere in Arabia—in the Aflaj district, at Qatif and, doubtless, at other places ; and there can be little doubt that the Kariz of Qatif dates back to times when Persian influence was predominant on the coast. Is it possible that Kharj itself, and, if Kharj, the Aflaj also, owed their prosperity to Persian settlements, long since wiped out by successive waves of Arab invaders from the south ? It seems to me not altogether improbable that the very name of the race which prospered in this fertile valley in the days of yore still survives in a form corrupted by forgetful centuries, Firzan—Fursan—the Persians. KHURMA PAST AND PRESENT. The following extract from a communication of Mr. Philby, dated August 18, is of interest as giving fresh data about the boundaries of the border-tribes between the Hejaz and’Nejd and the questions of jurisdiction which are involved therein :— “ As already pointed out, Khurma is only ten miles east of the unquestionable boundary of the Buqum and Subai tribes, namely Shaib Shaba. The question at issue, therefore, is the jurisdiction over the western section of the Subai tribe whose capital is Khurma and whose eastern boundary is Wadi Naim, one hundred and twenty miles east of Khurma. The adjudication of Khurma to the Sherif, therefore, necessarily implies extending the boundary of the Hejaz to a line about two hundred miles or more east of Taif. This brings up the question of the Ateiba highlands extending another one hundred miles eastward of Wadi Nairn, and, as the Sherif claims jurisdiction over the Ateiba, the boundary of Nejd falls back very nearly to the line Tuwaiq.” It will be remembered that several months before there was any trouble at Khurma (see Bulletin No. 41, page 69), Emir Feisal stated that about five years ago Ibn Saud had agreed, through his brother Saad ibn Saud, to recognise the Sherif’s authority in Wadis Khurma, Bisha and Ranya. The Sherif was recognised as overlord of the Ateiba, and Ibn Saud as overlord of the Qahtan. Ibn Saud was to hold sway in Wadi— 329 — 2,^3 Dawasir to the point where it becomes Wadi Ranya. It is important to note that it was about this time that Khalid was appointed Emir of Khurma by the Sherif, whose overlord ship was only challenged when Khalid seceded and the Wahhabis found themselves in the majority. In a report from Jeddah dated September 7, it is stated “ it is fairly certain ” that the Ateiba, Subai, Buqum and Dawasir elements situated in the districts of Wadis Khurma, Turaba, Subai and Ranya have been nominally subject to the Sherif of Mecca for the last fifteen years. The rival powers of Mecca, Nejd and Hail during the last hundred years have tried in turn to bring these districts under their rule, but success has chiefly fallen to Nejd. The great Saud, who ruled, almost unchallenged, from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, subjected the tribesmen of these districts, and to Nejd they belonged until the ignominious flight of the Saud family to the Eastern Coast in 1891. The new Rashidite power then laid claim to them—a claim which the Emir of Mecca was not slow to rebut. The dispute seems to have dragged on till the fall of the Rashids in Nejd in 1902, when the Turks placed the districts under the Emir of Mecca, who sent Sherif Sultan ibn Raja to Turaba as his representative. The influence of the Meccan Government has always been somewhat restricted by the Wahhabi sympathies of a considerable section of the inhabitants, and also by the familiar Arab preference for authority remote— where authority must be conceded—in this case that of Nejd, the town of Turaba being only a hundred miles distant from Mecca. Our information is too slight to justify a final opinion as to the rights and wrongs of these tribal questions ; for the present we can only record such evidence as is brought to light, in the hope that its sum total will eventually provide the material for a just appreciation. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Northern Area. Useful demolitions were carried out on the railway between Jerdun and Anaza, on or about August 20, and this section of the line still (September 5) remains cut. Emir Zeid reports that the Turks occupied Tafila on September 3. No resistance was offered. Lieut.-Colonel R. C. Buxton, who commanded the detach ment of the Imperial Camel Corps which accomplished the destruction of Mudawwara in August {see page 279), has now sent in a detailed report of the operation. He reached his— 330 — objective from Kubri, the point of departure, in fourteen days, travelling via the Mitla Pass-Nakhl-Akaba-Rumm. In addition to the damage already recorded, over two thousand yards of rail to the south of the station were completely destroyed. Prisoners were used in the demolitions. The assaulting infantry were supported by a Talbot car and aeroplanes, which effectually bombed redoubts. Recently a mobile force of Turks, in two columns, left Jurf and Hasa with the object of occupying Tafila, Shobek and Tuwana, when, if successful, they doubtless intended to attack the Arab bases on the Maan plateau from the north and west, probably in conjunction with an attack from Maan itself directed against Semna and Uheida. Tafila and Tuwana were occupied without fighting, as was Shobek for a short time ; a further advance, however, was prevented by a small force of Arab regulars supported by Beduins, who, on September 18, repulsed the Turks at Dosek, killing and wounding forty men, and compelling them to abandon rifles, horses, and mules. The morale of these forces appears to be at a low ebb, and the latest report indicates the abandonment of the more ambitious part of the enterprise. They will probably endeavour to withdraw to the railway—a movement which, owing to the hostile attitude of the Beduins and their shortage of transport, will be fraught with danger and difficulty. Between September 11 and 15 the Turks in Maan made five attacks on Semna, all of which were repulsed. The prompt and effective measures taken by Emir Zeicl, together with the loyal co-operation of the Beduins, have thus restored the situation. Emir Feisal left Abu Lisal for the north on September 10. He has been been joined by the Rowalla under Nuri Shaalan and fifteen hundred Druses. The tribal situation justifies the belief that results of far-reaching importance may be attained in the near future. Emir Zeid wires to his father, under date September 19 : “ Pilot Murphy shot down a German aeroplane between Azrak and Deraa, the two aviators being killed. He is the first pilot of your victorious northern army to fell an aeroplane, and his accomplishment deserves reward.” Southern Area. It is reported from Yambo, under date September 2, that the Turks seized thirty camels from the Beduins. In revenge, the latter attacked a Turkish patrol near Hafira, killing eight, and capturing two. A later report from Wejh states that the Beduins hold two Turkish officers and thirty men who were captured at Bedai. Hammud Mongara reports that he killed six Turks at Bedai, and captured two hundred and fifty sheep. An enemy patrol was put to flight by the Arabs who captured four hundred and twenty sheep, five hundred pounds in gold and the baggage of the Turkish officer in command. A deserter fromt 1 w — 331 — el-Ula states that the date crop there has been purchased by the Turks. One train per month still arrives from Medina, bringing dates, wheat, raisins, and a little meat, olive oil and semn. Major Davenport reports that, with a view to encouraging desertions among the Turkish garrisons, he has arranged to send parties on to the hills, near the Turkish posts, to light fires at night, and to make smoke fires by day. It has been learned that the Turks are often afraid to desert because they do not know where to find water. With a view to ensuring their good treatment by the Beduins, rewards are being offered for all Turks brought in alive. £3 per officer, and £l per man, is paid. In a letter from Sherif Ali to the King, dated Dhu’l Qada 24, he states that the King’s letter to Fakhri Pasha [see page 306) was sent to Jeleijila. The Commander telephoned to Fakhri Pasha, who told him to send on the letter and to treat the messenger with all consideration. He ordered the man to return at the end of the eight days stipulated in the King’s letter. General. Colonel Bassett reports, under date September 12, that, according to information received from a trustworthy source, Shakir and a force of about two thousand Arabs are encamped at Marran somewhere between Khurmaand Mecca. [Kote. —This is riot Marran on the Mecca-Aneiza road.] Shakir has not been to Khurma at all, and his activities are stated to be confined to patrolling. The people of Taif are showing signs of nervousness, and a desire to move into Mecca. It is probable that Shakir is endeavouring to settle the disturbance by peaceful methods. Reports received from Mr. Philby seem to show that the Ateiba have not been giving Shakir the support which he expected, and that important sheikhs are throwing in their lot with Ibn Saud (see page 317). An organised attempt is being made in Jebel Druz to encourage desertions from the enemy’s forces. A sort of rest- house has been opened, and deserters are fed and cared for there before being brought down to the Arab army. Over a hundred men have been secured in this way. A trustworthy agent reports that he was told by a native of Madeba that Sheikh Sultan of the Adwan was recruiting Beduins to fight against the British. The Ghanamat, despite the protests of their chief Salim abu’l Ghanam, are said to have thrown in their lot with Sultan, who has sent appeals for co-operation to the Beni Hasan and Beni Sakhr. So far as our information goes, his appeals were fruitless. [Late News:—Northern Area. Brilliant success has attended the operations of the mobile column of'Emir Feisal’s northern army. On September 16, an important bridge and a section of the railway near Mafrak, south of Deraa, were destroyed, and a Turkish post was captured with— 332 — its garrison. The following day, the column moved to Tell Arar, north of Deraa, capturing the station and the defending force, blowing up the bridge across Wadi Dahab and systematically destroying the railway north and south as far as Ghazale and Deraa respectively. The garrison at the latter place endeavoured in vain to hamper the work of the demolition party. Simul taneously, a detachment, marching west from Tell Arar, occupied the village of Mezerib in the Hauran plain and took possession of the water supply there. The station itself was next attacked, and the whole garrison was killed or captured. The telegraph line was cut and very extensive demolitions were carried out east and west of the station, so that communication between Deraa and Nablus, by rail or telegraph, was rendered impossible. During the night, the area of railway demolitions was extended west of Tell esh-Shehab to about half-way between Deraa and Tiberias. On September 18, the force moved south to Nasib, and attacked and occupied the station. The big viaduct north of the station was blown up, and several kilometres of railway were completely destroyed. On the following day, long sections of the line, north and south of Mafrak, w T ere also rendered useless. During the operations, one Turkish and two German two-seater aeroplanes were destroyed. The losses of the Sherifian force are very slight. In addition to the material captured, over two hundred prisoners have been taken. The importance of these operations is obvious. Since September 16, road and rail communication between Palestine and Damascus has been denied to the Turks, and the withdrawal of their Fourth Army, now in progress, will be a task of no small difficulty. Maan has been evacuated, and the pursuing Arabs have occupied Jerdun. Emir Feisal’s detachment of regulars is commanded by Brigadier- General Nuri Said. The Shaalan sections of the Rowalla are under the orders of Sheikhs Khalid and Trad, and the Hauran peasantry and Druses are working in conjunction with them, the whole force of auxiliaries being under the command of Sherif Nasir ibn Ali of the Beni Husein. Southern Area. Sherif Abdullah reports that he has damaged seven hundred rails and one engine and four trucks near Toweira. In the accompanying action eighteen Turks were killed and seven captured.]333 — NOTES. King Husein and Jaafar Pasha. In No. 207 of the Qibla, dated Dhul Qada 12 (August 19), the following proclamation appeared :— “ We have been honoured by the receipt of the following proclamation from the exalted Hashimite court: Whereas the title of Commander-in-Chief applied to Sheikh Jaafar, one of the chiefs of the Army in the Northern Hashimite camp, is current in certain circles, both in conversation and in private letters, and whereas this is inconsistent with the truth, and the Arab Government has not conferred this title on anyone nor defined the ranks of the commanders, as other governments do, and whereas the said Sheikh Jaafar is undertaking the supervision of a section of that army and no more, now therefore the above explanation is imperative.” The effect of this notice was, for a time to paralyse the activities of the Northern Army. Emir Feisal on August 29 telegraphed his resignation to his father, and all military operations were suspended for several days, a mutiny among the men only being averted by the tact and initiative of the officers. The situation was the result of a misunderstanding, augmented by intriguers in Akaba and Mecca. The intervention of H.E. The High Commissioner and General Allenby brought King Husein to reason, and his last messages show that he appreciates their action, and that, so far as he is concerned, the matter is satisfactorily ended. King Husein and Yemen Tribes. King Husein continues to receive communications from sheikhs of distant tribes. In the beginning of this month, he received a letter from Yahya ibn Yahya esh-Shaif, the chief of the Bekil, who refers to previous correspondence with the King, and tells him that he collected all the sheikhs of the Hamdan and explained to them the contents of the former’s letter. He and they present their homage to King Husein ; Yahya adds that he is sending two of his sons to the King via Aden, He says: ‘•All are ready to obey your commands and answer your call. We are all striving to obey and submit to Your Majesty in all that tends to cement the brotherhood of Moslems in this world and in the world to come.” The Resident at Aden reports that some of the envoys have actually arrived at Mokalla, but that it is undesirable they should come to Aden at present. He has, therefore, given instructions for them to be held up at Mokalla. Letters for warded to Aden by Yahya’s two sons—Haji ibn Ahmed and Mohammed ibn Yahya—indicate that their business is with us and not with King Husein. It w T ould seem, from the mention of a former messenger, one Seyyid Hamud ibn Ali, who is, probably, the brother of their principal sheikh, Sherif Salih ibn Ali, that the King is negotiating with the Hamdan esh-Sham.— — 334 — Arabian Rulers arid the Pilgrimage. Qasim townspeople confirm an earlier report that Ibn Sand is restraining his tribesmen from taking part in the pilgrimage, with the threat of outlawry. Ibn Rashid on the other hand, has despatched a thousand Shammar pilgrims with complimentary messages to the King and an assurance of his allegiance. A similar number of pilgrims has arrived from the Yemen. Abdul Hamid Bey. The obituary notice of Abdul Hamid Bey el-Masri, which appears on page 265, seems to have been premature. According to a recent report from Mr. Philby, he was near Hail in August last. The responsibility for the statement that Abdul Hamid was killed, rests with Abdullah. Sheikh Hedeiban el-Jeheishi merely reported the death of one officer. Idrises Situation. The Resident at Aden reports that he has seen Captain Clayton and agrees with him that the situation is not so black as painted by Nasr ed-Din. Idrisi has executed a volte-face, and asks that Captain Clayton may return. El-Atn was occupied by Idrisi’s forces on September 6, and, at the request of Said Mustafa, H.M.S. “ Odin ” shelled Loheiya on September 11. On the following day Idrisi’s forces entered Loheiya. They hold Gfanda also, but Turkish troops, posted on a hill half a mile east of Loheiya, still command the Ganda-Loheiya road. Yemen. A telegram from Aden, dated September 16, states that the report that the Turks have handed over the Yemen to the Imam fee page 308), is confirmed by local agents.SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau— 335 — THE DAWASIR TRIBE. . Tile following notes are taken from a report by Mr. Philby written from Riyadh, and dated July 28 : — . sma ll a proportion of the Dawasir is in any sense Beduin that the tribe hardly comes within our purview here.” So says the compiler of the Handbook of Arabia in his survey of the nomad tribes of Arabia, basing his assumption on the fact that elements of the Dawasir tribe are found scattered far and wide in settled life in the towns and villages of Nejd and even further afield. He might have said the same with equal truth of the great northern tribe of Anaza ! For are not the Anaza to be found settled down in all the villages and towns of Nejd down to far Hariq and further Aflaj ? And has not the Dawasir colony at Bahrain its counterpart in the Anaza colony at Kuweit ? Thus it is ever with the great nomad tribes, the tide of migration flows and ebbs, but ever and anon it leaves some small remnant high and dry far beyond its normal limit. As it has been with the Anaza so it has been with the Dawasir, and so, under the influence of religion, it is happening with other great nomad tribes—the Qahtan, the Ateiba and the Muteir. In all cases the main body retains its nomad spirit and habits, and it is only of such old remnants as Tamim and Hanifa that one can say that as nomad tribes they have ceased to be. Little is known by the Dawasir themselves, or by any one else of whom I had opportunities of enquiring, of their origin, or of the manner of their coming to their present haunts. So much they know that they came from Yemen whence the reputed ancestor of the tribe, Zayid, having obtained permission to migrate from the ruler of the land, arrived at Wadi Dawasir some centuries ago—perhaps two or three, or even more. In the Wadi they took up their residence as the guests and proteges of the original owners, of whom no trace or tradition remains, unless, as I think, their remnant is to be sought in the loose confederacy known as the Abat Dawasir, which neither claims nor is admitted to blood relationship with the Dawasir, but is inseparably linked with them by an immemorial tradition of alliance, and ranges through the same marches. So far as one can gather, the sup planting of the original holders of the land by the Dawasir took place by a process of peaceful penetration and absorption. The sons of Zayid waxed prosperous amid their new surroundings; but, much as the tribe is now abused and held in contempt for its lax observance of the nomad moral code, I never heard it said that they had come into their patrimony by treachery to their hosts. Starting from small beginnings in the oasis of the Wadi, whence they doubtless pastured such flocks as they had in the sand billows of Nafudh Dahi to the north, and the unprosperous sand and shingle plain to the south, the Dawasir gradually spread eastwards and northwards practically across the wholebreadth of Arabia. The extremities of their present range are roughly the Raiyaniyya mountain on the west and the province of Hasa on the east. Their northern boundary, which marches with the Qahtan, Subai, Suhul, and Shamir, runs from Raiyaniyya along the northern edge of Nafudh Dahi to the Tuwaiq barrier, thence along the northern boundary of the Aflaj hill district, and thence along the eastern slope of Tuwaiq, following the western edge of the Kharj valley, from whose further extremity it runs to the Aqla wells in Turabi plain and on to A1 Jafiya wells on the Anna plateau, whence, striking across the Dahana and Summan, it ends on the borders of Hasa. Southward, the boundary of the tribe runs from Hasa across the Summan and Dahana to the well Wasiya in Arina, and thence along the northern fringe of the Riyadh, past Kharj and Aflaj, to the eastern extremity of Wadi Dawasir, along which it runs westward through Sulaiyyil and the Wadi, back to the Raiyaniyya mountain. The A1 Murra march with the Dawasir from Hasa to the eastern extremity of Wadi Dawasir, and the tribes of Yam along the Wadi itself. Within the limits of this vast tract the tribe owns all the villages of the Wadi, Sulaiyyil and the Aflaj plain, some part of the oasis in the Aflaj hill district, and considerable holdings in Kharj, notably at Dilam. Both nomad* and settled elements share in the ownership of the palm-groves and corn-plots of these oases, the latter dwelling in permanent habitations of mud, therein to guard and cultivate their holdings ; while the nomad element ranges the beautiful pasture lands with the common flocks and herds. The best pastures are Nafudh Dahi, the Maqran area, the Kharj valley, the Anna plateau, and the Dahana and Summan. Water is abundant in the Dawasir territories, where, owing to the presence of the high barrier of Towaiq, some precipitation is almost certain to occur in most years. Sheep and goats they have in plenty ; horses but few, and those of miserable stature ; but their main wealth lies in their vast herds of camels—large, heavy-bodied brutes of a darkish dun colour—suitable rather for draught purposes than for riding ; the cow camels are renowned for their heavy yield of milk. I bn Sand’s annual revenue from the Dawasir camels, collected at the rate of one sheep or goat per five camels and converted into cash at the rate of five dollars per sheep {i.e. a tax of one dollar per camel per year), amounted last year to some sixteen thousand dollars ; but it should be noted that the tax is collected thus : namely, nothing on a holding of less than three camels ; one sheep on holdings of from three up to nine camels ; two sheep on holds of from ten to fourteen ; three on fifteen and so forth. Making due allowance for this method of assessment, a fair computation of the camel holding of the tribe would be, perhaps, thirty thousand camels, exclusive of youngsters which are not taxed and animals actually out to hire which are taxed on the loads they carrj^ each trip. A complete enumeration would probably discover not less than fifty thousand camels in the possession of the Dawasir tribe.337 — It is somewhat difficult to arrive at anything like an exact computation of the population of a tribe scattered over so wide an area, but I think, as I have already noted, that it is fair to assume two nomads for every settled person. On this basis I arrived at an estimate for the Wadi sections of seven thousand settled inhabitants (excluding negroes), and fourteen thousand nomads,—or twenty-one thousand in all. The total of settled and nomad elements of Sulaiyyil may be some five thousand in all, while the Aflaj plains may support some ten thousand settled Dawasir (excluding negroes), with a corresponding nomad element of twenty thousand. The total population of the Dawasir by this computation is some fifty-six thousand souls, to which should be added the settled and nomad elements of the Aflaj hill district and Kharj—say a total population (of course excluding all settled elements outside the proper tribal range), for the tribe of from sixty thousand to seventy thousand souls. I do not think that this figure errs in the direction of exaggeration. The Dawasir are noted among their neighbours as a factious, fanatical and ungenerous community, and (until recent years) ravaged by perpetual internecine dissension and warfare, in wffiich every hamlet’s hand was against its nearest neighbour and every section at mutual feud. Wahhabis by religious persuasion, they rival the worst of the Ikhwan in their narrow, fanatical outlook on life, the settled element being in this respect worse than the nomad ; for the former, seldom moving beyond the limits of their narrow oases, are secure from any infection by the generous impulses of the outer world; while the latter, seeking a precarious livelihood in the Hasa markets and even in the pearl fisheries beyond, besides retaining somewhat of the more humane codes of their pagan forbears, comport themselves more gently with the stranger. A relic of the old pagan days is the practice of female circum cision, which, rejected as heathenish by the village folk of the oases, survives in full force among their nomad brethren as it is said to do among the Manasir and Beduin tribes of Uman. This practice appears to be unknown among the neighbouring tribes of Qahtan, A1 Hurra, and Ateiba (and of course the more northern tribes) who, on this score, make merry at the expense of the Dawasir. The common salutation of the Dawasir, badu or hadhr, is Salam alaikum ya Muslimin ! ”— 338 — Northern Area. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. In oar last summary of operations on page 332, it was reported that communications between Palestine and Damascus were entirely destroyed by the Arabs in the north, while the Semna force had occupied Jerdun. In the absence of a detailed report of the operations of the Arab regular column working in co-operation with the Druses, Ruwalla and Khurshan, we can do no more than record the successes, which have resulted in the destruction of the Turkish Armies, achieved by the Arabs fighting on the right wing of the advancing British forces. The mixed force—which had concentrated near el-Umtaiye, south-east of Deraa,—captured Itzra and Ghazale stations on September 26, and occupied Sheikh Saad and Deraa on the following day, capturing about fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty machine guns. On October 1, an Arab force under Sherif Nasir entered Damascus. The remnants of the defeated Turkish Armies and the garrison of the town, amounting to about eight thousand men in all, were captured. The Maan group, harassed by Arabs, reached the vicinity of Zize, where it was surrounded by the Beni Sakhr and the people of Kerak. The whole force, numbering rather over five thousand, was in great straits owing to want of food and water, and surrendered to a detachment of British cavalry on September 29. Southern Area. Deserters from Meshed, who have recently come into Wejh, repoit that a train, carrying rations, runs once a fortnight from Medina to Meshed. The rations are inadequate, and three-quarters of the garrison are sick with scurvy. Fakhri Pasha is obtaining fuel from Bedai and Bowat. Eight hundred lails have been brought to the latter place for the construction of a light railway to bring away wood. The laying of the track is not yet completed, and meanwhile camels are carrying the wood. 1 he prisoners had been at least a month in the hands of the Bedums. One Mohammed el-Mughreibi Futeir arrived at Yambo on September 11. Accompanied by five slaves, he came on a mission from Ibn Rashid to the King. Emir Abdullah, how ever, detained him pending Ibn Rashid’s answer to Abdullah’s conditions. Mohammed, in an interview with the Commandant S tamho, stated that it was a sine qua non with Ibn Rashid that the King should have no agreement with Ibn Sand, and that, essential as was the unity of the Arabs, Neid must be excluded from that union. He added that it was proposed tokeep the proposed Shammar-Mecca alliance a secret until Ibrl Rashid s forces were fully equipped, hut he would not say whether the agreement provided for joint military action against Ibn Saud either now or in the future. We know of fbn Rashid’s failure to extract supplies and aims fiom the Turks, and this last move of his calls for no surprise. Mohammed el-Mughreibi said that he hoped to be able to produce letters, written by Ibn Saud to Ibn Rashid and to the Turks, suggesting alliances against the King of the Hejaz. Abdul Hamid Bey el-Masri (see page 334) has fled to Damascus. No Turkish officers are now in Hail, nor would it be safe for them to remain there. Two deserters, who left Medina a short time ago, state that there is considerable privation there, notwithstanding that supplies of dates and sheep reach the garrison from Hail convoyed by Ibn Rashid’s men. It is stated that no less than fifteen hundred sheep per month are sent in this way. On September 6 or 7 one of Sherif Abdullah’s detachments attacked an enemy patrol from Ayun, killing six men and capturing four. About the same time, Sherif Ali captured, eight men of a Turkish patrol from Bowat. East of Medina he also killed eight Turks who were patrolling at A walk General. Husein Effendi Ruhi reports that he learns from a trust worthy source that the King has imposed moderate counsels on Shakir, who proposed to advance on Khurma. The King ordered him to remain at Marran—sixteen hours north-west of Khurma—and to send food to the population of Khurma who are reported to be in want. Mr. Philby, writing from Boreida on September 10, says that Ibn Saud set forth on an expedition the preceding day. He refused to allow Mr. Philby to accompany him on the ground of Ikhwan fanaticism. [Late News.—Southern Area. Emirs Ali and Abdullah deny that large quantities of dates and sheep reach Medina, as stated by Turkish deserters. They say that the roads east and north of Medina are commanded by their detachments, and although occasionally small supplies slip through the cordon, the passage of a large convoy is impossible. However they have ordered increased vigilance on the part of the patrols.]NOTES. The Ikhwan and the Wahhabis. The following information, which rests ultimately on the authority of Dakhil Allah el-Kadi, a sheikh of the Juheina, was furnished by Miralai Abdul Mejid Bey :— The Ikhwan are a powerful and influential body who have gained control of the Wahhabi movement. They are an ecclesiola in ecclesia. Their meetings and deliberations are held in secret, and any one who discloses what transpires is instantly punished with death. To mark outwardly their separation from other men, they have adopted a distinctive mode of dress, shave their moustaches, allow their beards to grow and wear a white turban. The name Mutawa, which has come into use recently, is given to those who accept the tenets of Wahhabism. The word is said to denote one who is utterly submissive to the teaching. It may be, therefore, that they wish to cast off the name Muslim and yet retain its doctrinal significance, or the word may merely signify a convert. The Wahhabis have introduced innovations into the marriage laws, all tending to greater laxity in sexual matters. They do not go on pilgrimage, and even the holy place, built by Ibrahim and Ismail, is unclean to them because the Sherif has set foot in it. Mohammed himself, though admittedly a prophet, is to them a mere mortal whose authority is no greater than his fellows, since all are equal in the sight of God. Ibn Saud is openly referred to in Beduin circles as the head of the movement, and his connivance at the open immorality of his followers has given it great impetus. He has strengthened his position by prohibiting the ghazzu within the fold of Wahhabism, and it is said that he does not take zakat from his dependents. Furthermore, he is famous for his sagacity in deciding law-suits, and the arrangements he makes for their speedy disposal. Politically, the whole movement constitutes a growing menace to the orthodox of Mecca. Direct intercourse between the Sherifians and the Wahhabis must now be most difficult. The latter do not hesitate to preach that the Sherif is a Kafir. Any man who has served with the Sherif may be divorced by his wife, and if, on his return, he finds her married to another man, he has no redress. All his clothes and belongings are laid out in the sun for four days ; his family, relatives and friends refuse him the salaam, and he is boycotted until he has cleansed himself of his defilement. Ibn Saud has made capital out of the unsatisfactory position of King Husein in the Hejaz, and many of the Ateiba, Ageil and Harb have seceded from the King. Abdul Mejid estimates that the members of the society number about three hundred thousand. King Husein’s view of the importance of the Ikhwan, may be deduced from the following excerpt from his letter datedSeptember 18:—“ I consider it of vital importance that His Majesty’s Government should compel the Emir Ibn Sand to abolish and disperse what he calls the Ikhwan—that political society in the cloak of religion. This I desire as an Arab and a Muslim : for, verily, the fundamental principle of this -society is the blotting out and annihilation of Arab interests. Therefore, while this society exists, no work will be of the least advantage.” King Husein and Yemen Chiefs. King Husein has sent us a letter from Mohammed Hasan ibn Sinan appealing for help against the Turks with whom he is at war in Jebel Ras. The writer says he has appealed in vain to Idrisi for arms and ammunition, and he is willing to obey any orders from the King. He complains most bitterly of the tyranny of the Turks, who are commandeering animals, grain and money unchecked. Mohammed Hasan (see page 156) is one of the holiest Shafei sheikhs in the Taiz district and the southern Tihama, and is the head of the Tariqa esh-Shadhilia. He quarrelled with the Turks last October, and made common cause with the Bakil. As a result, he was ejected—at any rate temporarily—from Mirab. Since then he has kept in touch with the British, and has been a thorn in the side of the Turks. Recent reports from Aden note the presence of a Turkish column in his district; doubtless, the writer is referring to its operations in his letter. Ibn Sand and the Ajman. The Mesopotamian authorities have decided that it would be impolitic to adopt the drastic measures at first proposed (see page 307). They are of opinion that the Ajman cannot be coerced by threats or the taking of hostages. Their leading sheikhs have been warned that, if raiding continues, their subsidy will be discontinued. They reply that they cannot restrain their followers from this time-honoured pastime. Mr. Philby has been informed of this, and that Ibn Sand is at liberty to take action against the Ajman, provided that he does not entangle himself in hostilities with Koweit or endanger the safety of the Basra-Nasiriya railway. Idrisi’s Situation. According to a telegram from Aden, dated September 23, Idrisi, though holding Ganda and Atn, has evacuated Loheiya. The situation is obscure. Kaiti and Kathiri. An agreement has been concluded between Sir Ghalib ibn Awad ibn Omer and Omer ibn Awad ibn Omer, the Sultans of Shehr and Mokalla of the one part, and Sultans Mansur ibn Ghalib and Muhsin ibn Ghalib A1 Abdullah of the other part, providing inter alia, that the district of Hadramaut shall be a dependency of the British Government under the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla.The Ivaiti Sultans of Shehr and Mokalla recognise the A1 Abdullah Sultans as overlords of the Shanafer, ruling over the towns of Siwun, Terim, Teris, A1 Gharaf and Mariama within the Hadraraaut. The A1 Abdullah Sultans bind themselves not to interfere in Hadramaut affairs, except in the above-mentioned towns and villages : and, further, to accept as binding the treaty which was made between the Kaiti Sultan and the British Government in 1888, and to negotiate with the British Government through the Kaiti Sultan of Mokalla. Both parties agree to suspend hostilities and to conclude a peace without demands for compensation on either side. They agree to absolute freedom of trade and impartial taxation of their respective subjects. The British Government, in consideration of the acceptance of the above terms by the Sultans of Mokalla and Kaiti, will endeavour to settle all disputes which may arise between the parties, subsequent to the date of this treaty, by arbitration th rough the medium of their resident at Aden. Great satisfaction at the settlement of their long-standing differences is expressed by all parties, who are coming to Aden this month to hold a conference with the Resident there.SECRET. Ar&lt;ib liureav, Savoy Hotel, * * 4 Cairo, October 22, 1918. &lt;1 No. 106. SUMMARY. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FOURTH ARMY. THE WAHHABITE MOVEMENT 4 ARABIA. North-West. I ntelli ii'ence. ci (a) Southern Area. (b) General.343 - THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FOURTH ARMY. With the two thousand camels, given us in July by General Allenby, we calculated that we could afford to send up to Azrak, for 'operations about Deraa, an expedition of four hundred and fifty camel corps of the Arab regular army, four Arab Vickers, twenty Arab Hotchkiss, a French battery of four mountain Q.F. '65 guns, two British aeroplanes, three British armoured cars with necessary tenders, a demolition company of Egyptian Camel Corps and a section of camel-Ghurkas. Besides these, Sherif Nasir and myself had our private body-guards of Arab camel-men. This made our total force one thousand strong, and its prospects were so sure that we made no provision (and had no'means) for getting it back again. The supply problem, especially in petrol and ammunition, was a very great one, and we lived from hand to mouth, without, however, ever being in serious need. The force left Ab el-Lissan in detachments early in Sep tember, and concentrated, without accident, to time at Azrak on the twelfth of the month. The distance from Akaba to Azrak was two hundred and ninety miles, and we used the wells of defer, Bair and Ammari on the way. At Azrak we had meant to collect the Rualla and descend in force on the Hauran, with direct assault on Deraa, which was only held by five hundred rifles— but this plan was spoiled by the unfortunate outburst of the King of Hejaz against Jaafar Pasha and the senior officers of the Northern Army, since the crisis he provoked upset the whole local temper, and delayed me in Ab el-Lissan till September 4. As a result, the Rualla never came together, and we had to modify our schemes. In the end, we decided to carry out a flying attack on the northern, western and southern railways at Deraa, with our regular troops, the Rualla horse under Khalid and Trad Shaalan, and such Hauran peasants as should be brave enough to declare for us. As we sat at Azrak we put in a strong bluff towards Amman. Money was sent to Mithgal with very secret instructions to collect barley dumps for us and the British, in our combined surprise attack against Amman and Salt on the 18th. The Beni Sakhr were to mass at Ziza to help us. The rumour of this, and the rumour of our simultaneous intention on Deraa, confirmed by other factors supplied them from Palestine, kept the Turks’ eyes fixed on the Jordan and east of it, where their lines were very long, expensive in men, and, despite their best efforts, inevitably vulnerable to a force of our mobility and range. On the 13th we left Azrak and marched over the long Gian el-Khunna into the basalt screes of Jebel Druse. The Egyptian and Ghurka units were sent westward to cut the Amman line by Mafrak, but, owing to a misunderstanding with their guides, never got so far. However, our Bristol Fighter the same day, brought down a German two-seater in flames near Umm el-Jimal: so all was well. We got to Umtaiye, thirteen miles south-east of344 — Deraa, on the 15th. This (and its neighbour Um el-Surab) were our forward bases, as about them were many cisterns of water of last year’s rain. We were at once joined by the male population of the nearest villages, and by Sheikh Talal el- Hareidhin of Tafas, the finest fighter of the Hauran, who had come to me in Azrak in 1917. He had agreed to be our guide, and marched with us till he died near Deraa, helping us day and night, our sponsor and backer in every village. But for his energy, courage and honesty, things would have gone hard with us many times. It was still necessary for us to cut the railway between Deraa and Amman, not only to give colour to our supposed attack on the Fourth Army, but to prevent the reinforcement of Deraa from the south. It was our plan to put ourselves between Deraa and Palestine, to force the enemy to reinforce the former from the latter. Had we merely moved troops from Amman to Deraa we should be doing Palestine no good, and should probably have been rounded up and caught ourselves. The only unit now in hand to do this cutting—since the army must go forward at once—were the armoured cars, which are not ideal for the purpose, as you are almost as shut in to them as the enemy are shut out. However, we went down in all the cars we had to the railway and took a post of open-mouthed Turks too suddenly for them to realise that we were hostile. The post commanded a very pleasant four-arched bridge (kilo. 149) about twenty-five metres long and six metres high, with a flattering white marble inscription to Abd el-Hamid. We wrecked all this with one hundred and fifty pounds of gun-cotton, and did what we could to the station. On the way back we had a mishap to one of the cars, and a vile road, so did not catch our army till after dawn on the 17th, going down to the line near Tell Arar, five miles north of Deraa. We suppressed a little post and some Kurdish cavalry, and put our demolition party on the line. The French blew up part of the bridge, and the Egyptians, working up the line towards Ghazale, did six hundred pairs of rails before dark on our new “tulip” system.* Meanwhile we climbed to the top of Tell * After long experiment we found this the cheapest and most de structive demolition for a line with steel sleepers. Dig a hole midway between the tracks under a mid-rail sleeper, and work out the ballast from the hollow section of the sleeper. Put in two slabs of guncotton, return the ballast to the hole, and light. If. the charge is properly laid, and not in contact with the sleeper, a 12-inch fuse is enough. The gas expansion arches the sleeper eighteen inches above the rail, draws the metals six inches towards one another, humps them three inches above the horizontal, and twists the web from the bottom inwards. It drives a trough a foot deep across the formation. This three-dimension distortion of the rails is impossible to straighten, and they have to be cut or scrapped. A gang of four men can lay twenty “tulips” in an hour on easy ballast, and for each two slabs (and single fuse) you ruin a sleeper, a yard of bank and two rails. Tim effect of a long stretch of line planted with these “tulips” is most beautiful, since no two look just alike, HArar, which commanded a complete view of Deraa, about four miles off, and we realised that there were nine enemy machines on the aerodrome. Our Bristol had been badly shot about, so they had no competition to fear, and for a time they did what they liked to us with bombs and machine-gunning. We had luck, and used our mountain guns and Hotchkiss for what they were worth, but were getting much the worst of it, till our only surviving machine, a B.E. 12 from Azrak turned up and sailed into the middle of the show. We watched with very mixed feelings, for the four Turkish two-seaters, and their four scouts were all of them much more than its equal in the air : however, by good hap or skill the B.E. came through them and led the whole circus of them away westward, and after to Ghazale, in pursuit, while we took advantage of our respite to organize and send off a mixed column to Mezerib, to cut the Palestine line. Just after this was done, the B.E. came back again with its attendant swarm, and telling us that it had finished its petrol, landed near us and turned over on to its back in the rough, while a Halberstadt came down and scored a direct hit on it with a bomb. Our pilot was unhurt, and with his Lewis gun and tracer bullets was soon most usefully running about just outside Deraa in a Ford, cutting the railway to prevent any kind of sortie of rolling stock. We reached the lake at Mezerib about one p.m.,and by two, had taken and looted the French station. The main station on the Palestine line proved too difficult, and we waited till three for the Camel Corps and guns to arrive, and then attacked it formally, and carried it by assault a few minutes later. As our oidy demolition parties were on the Damascus line, still demolish ing, we could not do anything very extensive, but cleared the station, burnt a lot of rolling stock and two lorries, broke the points, and planted a fair assortment of “tulips” down the line. The interruption of their main telegraph between Palestine and Syria, here and at Tell Arar, bothered the Turks a good deal. We spent the night at Mezerib, and were joined by hundreds and hundreds of the Hauran peasants : during the night some of us marched to within three hundred yards of Tell el-Shehab,intending to attack, but found that a German colonel with guns and rein forcements had just arrived. It was a consolation to know that on the critical 18th of the month we had moved the reserve regiment at Afuleh up to meet us, and we also pleased ourselves with blowing up the line west of Shehab, and, further west, at Zeizun. Next morning we did some leisurely work on Mezerib station, and then moved past Remthe till mid-afternoon, when we were in position west of Nasib station. After considerable resistance and artillery work, we were able to carry the post on the big bridge north of the station, and to blow up the bridge. This was my seventy-ninth bridge. It had three seven- metre arches, Avas about twenty-five feet high, and had piers five feet thick—quite one of the finest we have destroyed.We slept at Nasib and next morning marched gaily away to Umtaiye, speeded by a field gnn which came to Nasib by train, and shelled our tail vigorously. At Umtaiye we rejoined the armoured cars, which had returned direct from Arar after cover ing the demolitions : and as we had that morning seen an enemy aeroplane land near the railway west of Umtaiye, we at once took two cars down to look at it. We found three two-seaters there, but for a deep gully could not rush their aerodrome. Two got up and troubled us, but we were able to put one thousand five hundred bullets into the third, and finished it. On our way back the other two machines returned from Deraa with bombs, and swooped at us four times; however, they placed them bad!} 7 , and we escaped nearly unhurt. Armoured car work is fighting deluxe, but they give a sitting shot to a well-handled plane. All the rest of the day at Umtaiye we were much bothered by enemy aircraft. 1 hat night (the 19th) an armoured car, with the Egyptian and Ghurka units, went down to the railway about kilo. 154 and blew up some culverts and many rails. The object was to hinder the repair parties which (with escort of guns, machine guns, and infantry) were hard at work on our destroyed bridge of the 16th at kilo. 149. We were also able to engage the repair train (by armoured car and Ford) at eighty yards range, and persuade it back to Mafrak at top speed. Next day I went on to Azrak, thence by air to Ramleh, and returned on the 22nd to Um el- Surab, with three Bristol Fighters. Before these finished breakfast they had been up twice, bagged a Turkish two-seater, and driven down three scouts. After this the Turks troubled our air no more ; and after breakfast I went again to Azrak, and returned to Um el-Surab in the evening with Feisal and Nuri Shaalan, to meet the Handley-Page. It turned the scale in our favour through all the Hauran. Next day the regulars went down to bridge kilo. 149, as its repair was nearly finished, and after a sharp fight drove off its guards, including very persistent German machine- gunners, destroyed more of the line, and burned the timber framing which the Turks had erected in seven days’ work. I he armoured cars and French guns did specially well to-day, and the Rualla horse under Nuri Shaalan personally. Nuri is quiet, and retiring, but a man of few words and great deeds, intelligent, well-informed, decisive, full of quiet humour, and the best Arab sheikh I have ever met. His tribe are like wax in his hands, and he knows what should be done and does it. The British forces had now (September 24) advanced to such a point that the Turkish Fourth Army, whom we had arrogated to ourselves as our birds, were ordered back to cover Deraa and Damascus. As a result of their haste and our holding of the tail way, they abandoned the idea of falling back from Amman b\ rail, and proceeded towards us by road with all their guns and transport. We sent our cavalry at them, and forced them to leave the guns and carts between Mafrak and Nasib. Theyalso lost a lot ol men, and what had been a formal column of route became a confused mass of fugitives, who never had time to reform again. It seemed to us, however, that we might now venture to put ourselves between Deraa and Damascus (at some such point as Sheikh Saad) so as to force the immediate evacuation of the former : we might then hope to be able to do business, not only with this mob of the Fourth Army as it emerged from Deraa, but with such remnants of the Palestine Army as escaped by Semakh and Irbid. Accordingly, the camelry, guns, and machine guns, marched northward on the 25th, till, on the afternoon of the 26th, they were able to descend on the railway and cross it between Ghazale and Ezra. This move took the Turks (by now panic-stricken) com pletely by surprise. The railway had been opened for traffic (after our damage of the 17th) on the previous day, but we now cut it again—and it remained cut till the close of operations, and penned into Deraa six complete trains, which are now ours—took Ghazale with its two hundred men and two guns, took Ezra, held only by the Algerian, Abd el-Kader, a pro-Turk religious fanatic, and a good deal of stores. We then passed on and slept near Sheikh Miskin. The Turks received fantastic reports of our strength, and ordered the immediate evacuation of Deraa by road, while the Germans burnt their five remaining aeroplanes. This gave us a total of eleven enemy machines accounted for by our force since September 13. At dawn on the 27th we reached Sheikh Saad, in time to take prisoner two Austro-Turk machine-gun companies on their way to Kuneitra to oppose the British advancing by that road. We then stood on the hill at Sheikh Saad, and watched the country-side. When we saw a small enemy column we went out and took it: when we saw a large column, we lay low. Our excuse must be physical exhaustion—also we were only nine hundred strong. Aeroplanes now dropped us a message that there were two columns of Turks advancing on us. One from Deraa w r as six thousand strong, and one from Mezerib, two thousand strong. We determined that the second was about our size, and marched the regulars out to meet it just north of Tafas, while sending our Hauran horse out to hang on to the skirts of the large column, and some unmounted peasants to secure the Tel el-Shehab bridge, which the Turks were mining. We were too late (since on the way we had a profitable affair with an infantry battalion) to prevent the Mezerib column getting into Tafas. They strengthened them selves there, and as at Turaa, the last village they had entered, allowed themselves to rape all the women they could catch. We attacked them with all arms as they marched out later, and bent the head of their column back towards Tell Arar. When Sherif Bey, the Turkish Commander of the Lancer rear guard in the village, saw this he ordered that the inhabitants be killed. These included some twenty small children (killed with348 lances and rifles), and about forty women. I noticed particularly one pregnant woman, who had been forced down on a saw- bayonet/ Unfortunately, Talal, the Sheikh of Tafas, who, as mentioned, had been a tower of strength to us from the beginning, and who was one of the coolest and boldest horsemen I have ever met, was in front with Auda abu Tayi and myself when we saw these sights. He gave a horrible cry, wrapped his headcloth about his face, put spurs to his horse, and, rocking in the saddle, galloped at full speed into the midst .of the retiring column, and fell, himself and his mare, riddled with machine-gun bullets, among their lance points. With Auda’s help we were able to cut the enemy column into three. The third section, with German machine-gunners resisted magnificently, and got off, not cheaply, with Jemal Pasha in his car in their midst. The second and leading portions after a bitter struggle, we wiped out completely. We ordered “ no prisoners ” and the men obeyed, except that the reserve company took two hundred and fifty men (including many German A.S.C.) alive. Later, however, they found one of our men with a fractured thigh who had been afterwards pinned to the ground by two mortal thrusts with German bayonets. Then we turned our Hotchkiss on the prisoners and made an end of them, they saying nothing. The common delusion that the Turk is a clean and merciful fighter led some of the British troops to criticise Arab methods a little later—but they had not entered Turaa or Tafas, or watched the Turks swing their wounded by the hands and feet into a burning railway truck, as had been the lot of the Arab army at Jerdun. As for the villagers, they and their ancestors have been for five hundred years ground down by the tyranny of these Turks. Our Rualla horse were then sent on straight to Deraa, with orders to scatter any Turkish formations met with on the road, and to occupy the place. They had two or three fights on their way down, and took Deraa station at a whirlwind gallop, riding over all the trenches, and blotting out the enemy elements that still tried to hold the place. Next morning they brought us three hundred mule-mounted infantry prisoners, and about two hundred infantrymen and two guns. The Turks and Germans had unfortunately burnt their stores before we took it. The regular troops spent that night—a very uneasy night it was—at Sheikh Saad. We did not yet know that we had won, since there was always a risk of our being washed away by a great wave of the enemy in retreat. 1 went out to see our Haurani horse, near Sheikh Miskin, where they were tenaciously clinging on to the great Turkish column from Deraa, giving much more than they were getting. At midnight I was back in Sheikh Saad, and found Nasir and Nuri just off for Deraa : we had a race, in which my camel-corps beat the headquarters horses and joined Trad Shaalan in Deraa village at dawn. We had some little work to do then in making the necessary local arrangements. ftAfterwards I rode out westwards till I met the outposts of the Fourth Division (British) and guided them into Deraa. They only stayed there one night and early on the 29th they left for Damascus, after assigning to us the duty of right-flank guard. Accordingly, we marched up the Hejaz line, which suited us very well, for first our three hundred Rualla and Abu Tayi horse, and then our nine hundred Rualla camels, caught up with our Hauran cavalry harassing the Turkish Deraa column near Mesmiye. Elie aeroplanes had reported this column as six thousand strong. At Sheikh Miskin on the second day it looked about five thousand strong. At Mesmiye it was said to be three thousand strong, and at Kiswe, where our horse headed them into Greneral Gregory’s Brigade, there were about two thousand of them. The whole of this gradual attrition was the work of the irregulars, since the Arab Regular Army, not being skilled camel- men, marched little faster than the British cavalry, and never came into action after Deraa. The Kiswe fight was a satisfactory affair. The Turks came along the valley of the Hejaz line, in a long, straggling column, halting every few miles to bring their guns into action against the Arabs. Nasir knew that the leading brigade of the Fourth Division was nearing Khan Denun, so he galloped forward with his slaves, and Nuri Shaalan and his slaves, about thirty in all, headed the Turkish column off between Jebel Mania and the trees of Khiata, and threw himself into the trees to delay them till the British were ready. The British had not seen or heard of this enemy column, and were in order of march, but as soon as they had learned what was forward they got their cavalry to north, west, and south of them, and opened oji them with their Horse Artillery. It was just sunset when the affair began, but before it was too dark to see, the Turks were a scattered mob, running up the steep slopes of Mania and over it, in their ignorance that the Wuld Ali and Abu Tayi were waiting for them there in force. This ended the history of the Fourth Army. Old Auda, tired of slaughter, took the last six hundred prisoners. In all we had killed nearly five thousand of them, captured about eight thousand (as we took them we stripped them, and sent them to the nearest village, where they will be put to work on the land till further notice) and counted spoils of about one hundred and fifty machine guns and from twenty-five to thirty guns. Our horse rode on that evening (September 30) into Damascus, where the burning ammunition dumps turned night into day. Away back at Kiswe the glare was painful, and the roar and reverberation of the explosions kept us all awake. In Damascus, Shukri el-Ayubi and the town council had proclaimed the King of the Arabs and hoisted the Arab flag as soon as Mustafa Kamel and Jemal had gone. The Turk and German morale was so low that they had marched out beneath the Arab flag without protest: and so good was the civil control that little or no looting took place.Hash*, old Nuri, Major Stirling and myself, entered the morning of October 1, receiving a tremendous but impromptu greeting from the Moslems of the town. I think I should put on record a word of what happened after w r e got it. I found at the Town Hall Mohammed Said and Abd el-Kadir, the Algerians, who had just assumed possession of the provisional civil government, since there was no one in Damascus who could tight their Moorish bodyguard. They are both insane, and as well pro-Turkish and religious fanatics of the most unpleasant sort. In consequence I sent for them, and before the belediyeh and the shiyukh el-harrat, announced that, as Feisal’s representative, I declared Shukri el-Ayubi Arab Military Governor (Ali Riza, the intended Governor, was miss ing), and the provisional civil administration of the Algerians dissolved. They took it rather hard, and had to be sent home. That evening Abd el-Kadir called together his friends and some leading Druses, and made them an impassioned speech, denounc ing the Sherif as a British puppet, and calling on them to strike a blow for the Faith in Damascus. By morning this had degenerated into pure looting, and we called out the Arab troops, put Hotchkiss round the central square, and imposed peace in three hours, after inflicting about twenty casualties. The part played by the Druses was an ignoble one. We had never expected them to join the Sherif, and had therefore excluded them from our calculations of war-wages. After the British victory in Palestine they began to believe that perhaps they were on the wrong side : so when we came forward the second time to Deraa they all collected round Sultan el-Atrash and Husein abu Naif, our two firm friends in Jebel Druse, clamouring for military service. Sultan believed them, and marched to Ghazale to join us with about one thousand five hundred of them, all mounted. They hung round behind our horse, never entering the fight, and waited until Damascus was taken. Ihey then paraded before the Sherif, and began to loot the inhabitants. After the Arabs checked them at this and drove them out of the town to Jaraman, they came to me, and said that their real feelings were pro-British. As they were the only people in all Syria to volunteer for service against Egypt in 1914, this was hard to credit, aud 1 gave them little satis faction. Ihey are greedy braggarts Avho soon knock under to a show of force.351 — THE WAHHABITE MOVEMENT. We give below a translation—made in the Arab Bureau, Cairo,—of an account of the Wahhabite movement, taken from Tagbuch einer Reise in Inner-Arabien, written by Professor Julius Euting, the Archaeologist and Explorer. Euting’s sojourn in Hail dated from November 1883 to January 1884 :— “ Shortly before the middle of the last century, there arose, in the heart of Arabia, a simple man who felt himself called to be the reformer of Islam—Mohammed, surnamed Abd el-Wahab, the son of a poor shepherd, Suleiman, of the tribe of the Beni Tamim. Born in the year 1116 a.h. —that is, 1696 a.d.— in the small village of el-Ayena, he had pursued his pious studies at Basra, Baghdad and Damascus, and gone on pilgrimage to the holy places ; but it was just through this personal intercourse with the pillars of orthodoxy and from observation of what went on at the holy places, that he acquired a profound abhorrence of the excrescences of his religion. The mechanical system of ritual To which orthodox Mohammedan theology had gradually shrunk ; the mere formality of the acts of piety, prevailing especially at the holy places at Mecca and Medina ; the venera tion—bordering on idolatry—of numerous local saints, filled him with loathing and wrath, and he determined to protest openly against them. He was little loved, on account of his fanatical nature, in Horeimeleh, where he had settled ; and even in his native town—el-Ayena—he made himself so hated that he had to flee to Deraiyya. That was about the year 1750, probably earlier. Here he succeeded in converting Sheikh Mohammed ibn Saud of the tribe of the Wuld Ali (of the Anaza), and through this combination of religion and politics he provoked a movement which was to shake the whole Islamic world. The principles of his doctrine—which he claimed did not differ in any particular from the original and pure religion of Mohammed—were as follows. There is only one God, and no intermediary is needed between men and their Lord. All the prophets were but bearers of the divine message, and have no claim whatsoever to personal veneration. Saints are there none; priestly privileges are to be condemned ; splendid ceremonies and costly temples are also evil things. Burial shrines with their heaped up treasures are places of idolatry, and, therefore, are to be condemned to destruction. The enjoyment of tobacco, the wearing of ornaments and fine raiment—especially silk—is sinful, just as every outward expression of worldly pleasure, music, dance and games. On the other hand, incumbent on all believers are prayer five times a day ; the keeping of the month of fasting ; the pilgrimage to Mecca; the payment of the believer’s tax (originally one hundredth part of his income) and the duty of war against all false co-religionists, who are to be treated as the equals of unbelievers (kujfar) and idolaters (gmushrikin).— 3.52 — The warlike Sheikh, Mohammed ibti Saud, understood how to translate this teaching into practice. After fifteen years spent in petty wars, he had completely converted, that is to say sub jected, the district of el-Aridh in the interior, as also the littoral strip of territory of el-Hasa on the Persian Gulf, and was able to leave to his son and successor a well-secured dominion. The latter, Abdul Aziz, born in 1721—died 1803 (reigning from 1765 to 1803), extended his dominion in rapid and suc cessive victorous campaigns far beyond the boundaries of Nejd. Every campaign was announced beforehand to his adversaries accompanied by the demand of conversion and submission. Attracted by rich booty, the forces of the Wahhabis increased to an undreamed of extent, and they undertook the most foolhardy expeditions with utter contempt for death. I will not enumerate in detail their many undertakings in all directions. These would have been unnoticed in history had they been confined to the interior of Arabia. The Mohammedan world was first stirred when the pilgrims of the Haj were attacked by the Wahhabis. This first happened in the year 1783 and w^as repeated several times afterwards. This state of things lasted a considerable time, until the Porte, as nominal protector of all Moslems, bestirred itself to oppose the spoiling and oppression of the Faithful. Neither the great age nor the blindness of the founder of this sect, Mohammed Abdul Wahhab (who died in the year 1791, aged ninety-five), impaired his ardour to fire the religious zeal of his followers. His successor, Husein, also blind, succeeded in keeping enthusiasm alive by fervent preaching. In the spring of 1801, Saud, the son and future successor of Abdul Aziz, undertook a foray of pillage and destruction to Kerbela on the. Euphrates. There, at the grave of Husein, the son of the Caliph Ali, the most revered shrine of the Shias, priceless treasures and votive offerings had lain heaped up for centuries. No wonder that an expedition there should appear seductive. On the feast of the Bairam, April 20, 1801, the Wahhabis appeared before Meshhed Husein, destroyed the sacred relics and massacred the temple guards and priests. This was done with such un thinking haste that, when it came to seeking the hidden treasures, there was no survivor to be found who could reveal the access to the subterranean vaults. However, the accessible booty was a sufficient prize. . . . The expedition against Mecca, undertaken in the year 1802, was at first fruitless ; but was resumed in the following year and ended with the sack of the town and the beheading of twenty Sherifs. The holy places themselves were still spared on this occasion. In the samp vpnr 1 rm was assassinated by a fanatical Shia in revenge for the spoliation of Meshhed Husein. The son of the murdered man. the illustrious campaigner to 1814. In #6 no 1804 he over})owered Medina, and caused all the treasures to he carried off from the grave of the Prophet. The great pilgrim caravans, the official Turkish and Egyptian ones as well as those of Persia and the Yemen, ceased. It was not that the Wahhabis wanted to suppress the pilgrimage itself ; but they could not endure that the pilgrims should tread upon Arabian soil in the unauthorized company of foreign soldiers. Arab national feeling, embodied in the Wahhabis, was no longer willing to tolerate Turkish and Egyptian tutelage, much less armed intervention. In two successive years, 1806-7, the Mecca Caravan was com pletely stripped. In 1809 Sand made his entry into the two holy towns as a pilgrim ; and in 1810, on the same occasion, he caused the grave of Mohammed at Medina to be opened ; all jewels, swords, lamps, and other treasures to be taken away to Deraiyya and the black stone of the Kaaba to be broken in pieces. Though the Wahhabi movement had thus, at the summit of its power, subdued the whole peninsula by blood and arms and filled the courts of Stambul and Teheran with terror, it already bore within it the germ of decay. The heaping up of countless treasures in the capital necessarily induced a corruption of simple customs ; luxury, favouritism and pride were the order of the daju As an example, Sand was not ashamed to wear a gold-embroidered mantle worth two hundred thousand piastres. Oppression, spoliation and the high blood-tax called forth discontent among the tribes and drove some of them to emigrate. Only a renewed threat from without could hold the Wahhabite state together. The storm was not long in coming. The plundering of the holy places ; the violation of Mohammed’s grave ; the slaughter of so many believers and the tangible loss of the Asiatic provinces were bound eventually to waken the Sublime Porte from its careless slumber. Mohammed Ali Pasha of Egypt, later to become viceroy, was chosen as the suitable scourge for the Beduins, and entered on the project gladly. Did it not afford him the opportunity of using this campaign as a school for the building up of an army experienced in war, indispensable to him for his secret plans in other directions ? What the Romans had to suffer in their ignominious expedition to South Arabia under Aeliu's Gallus (25-24 b.c.), and perhaps similarly the Assyrian conquerors of an earlier age—befell the Egyptians; hunger and thirst; the inclemency of the land and climate ; epidemics, rapid exhaustion of man and beast ; difficulty of transport; and untrustworthiness of guides—proved far more dangerous enemies than the Beduin hordes. In October 1811, the Egyptian land army, supported by a fleet brought together with difficulty, set forth for Arabia. At its head was Mohammed Ali’s youthful son, Tusun Pasha, only sixteen years old. The first advance against the enemy failed completely. At the next, in 1812, things went better, when Medina, Hanakiyya, Jeddah and Mecca were occupied. In 1813 Mohammed Ali went to the front himself, and—not without854 sly calculation—offered prayers, as a simple pilgrim, at the Kaaba and the prophet’s grave. Reinforcements of soldiers, horses, and camels had to be procured from Egypt to replace the excessive losses of the army ; and not until the viceroy (on January 10, 1815) had defeated the Wahhabis—three thousand strong—at Bessel, could an advance into the interior be thought of. Mean while, Sand had died in April or May 1814, and his son Abdullah (1814-19) reigned in his stead. The latter made overtures for a peaceful settlement, but the viceroy abruptly rejected all negotiations as coming too late. Matters of State called Mohammed Ali back to Cairo, and at his departure he caused Ibn Sand to be informed that he would send his son, Ibrahim Pasha, with a great army, to lay waste the whole land in order to deliver him dead or alive to the authorities at Stambul. And he kept his word. Of the vicissitudes of the war of 1816-17, which was fought with great bitterness and cruelty on both sides, and in which Ibrahim Pasha spared no money to corrupt and placate those who submitted to him, the only outstanding fact is the final catastrophe of the conquest and destruction of Deraiyya. On April 14, 1817, the Egyptians began a bombard ment of the Wahhabite capital. Heaven itself seemed to lend its aid to the death-defying defenders, fired to fresh exertions by the women, who, amid a rain of bullets, brought up powder, shot and jars of water. On June 21 an extraordinary whirl wind arose over the Egyptian camp. Fire broke out and spreading with alarming rapidity, reached the powder magazine, and exploded with a terrific detonation two hundred barrels of powder and two hundred and eighty cases of cartridges and bombs. Many men and beasts, as well as half of all the supplies, were thus destroyed. Neither this terrible event, nor the lack of food, nor even devastating sickness could subdue a man like Ibrahim Pasha. All sorties of the enemy were brilliantly repulsed. With new supplies and one thousand six hundred fresh troops he resumed the attack twenty-five days later; and while Khalil Pasha, with three thousand auxiliaries, was on the way, he staked all on an attempt to seize the town without extraneous aid. After a heroic defence, Abdullah ibn Saud, left at the last with a bodyguard of only four hundred blacks, was compelled to surrender on September 9, 1817. Ibrahim Pasha paid a tribute of sincere estee/n to the bravery and noble bearing of his adversary. He caused him to be brought to Cairo, and Mohammed Ali seemed disposed to pardon him. Not so the Porte at Stambul. It insisted on his delivery and simply had him executed—1819. After the sack and destruction of Deraiyya, Ibrahim Pasha returned with his army, having set up a greedy official as the Governor of Nejd. All heavy material which he did not need on the journey he left behind in the country ; remains thereof at Hail are the old cannons and also an anvil of an Egyptian field-forge.How long the Egyptian occupation lasted, its territorial extent and the vicissitudes it underwent, I will not venture to set forth, because the sources of our information are as scanty as they are unreliable. Only so much is quite certain, namely, that at the latest in the year 1849, even the last shadow of Egyptian influence in Central Arabia had disappeared. This was maintained only by the proximity of the military force, which the Turco-Egyptians in 1824-27 and 1833-36 displayed in their campaigns in the southern Hejaz, and in the mountains of Yemen against the warlike tribes of Asir. In the thirty years between the destruction of Deraiyya and the complete evacuation of the interior by the foreigners, the Wahhabites were able to concentrate once more. What brought them together was the common hatred against Turks and Egyptians. The cause of this feeling among all Beduins (who, it cannot be denied, possess noble and chivalrous sentiments), is the deep disgust which they entertain for the oft-experienced faithlessness, trickery and perjury of the former. Just as the Wahhabites had been compelled to realise that it was a vital mistake for them to contend with disciplined armies outside the borders of the desert, so, for their part, the Egyptians had to confess that they could not maintain themselves in the centre of Arabia without senseless sacrifices, and that in no circumstances could the occupation of the land be made profitable. Therefore, the desert for the Beduins, the fixed cities for the soldiers and officials. And so it is still to-day. The idea that the littoral of Arabia consists of regular ordered and inter-connected Turkish administrative districts is a gross error; there are only a few small garrisons with their immediate surroundings where the Turks have anything to administer—just as far as their guns and rifles carry. Beyond those limits in plain or mountain, all that ceases, or exists at the most in the colouring of the map. Though we are comparatively well informed about the first period of the Wahhabite power which ended with the destruction of Deraiyya in 1817, our knowledge of subsequent events in Central Arabia is all the poorer. Here the indifference of the Beduins to dates leaves us in complete uncertainty. If one asks them for a historical date one may perhaps ascertain the da}^ of the week, or be given some proximate feast; but information with regard to the year can seldom be obtained, still less con firmation, so that accounts of comparatively recent events differ one from another quite unbelievably by several years. Moreover, there is also an unholy confusion of the names which recur again and again in several generations and degrees of relation ship : Abdullah, Abdul Aziz, Saud, Feisal, and so on ; together with the common appellation of the ruling family, Ibn Saud. I must, for the time being, decline any attempt at accuracy, and can only relate, at third hand, that Turki, the son of the Abdullah who was executed in Stambul, is cited as the fifth W r ahhabite356 — chief. He is said to have held the Wahhabites together— 1820-32. Hi s son (number six) Feisal is said to have reigned 1836-66 (P), and to have been succeeded by (number seven) Abdullah. From that point onwards I find but a wild confusion of names and dates. One thing remains certain, that, outwardly and inwardly, the Wahhabite state with its new capital, Riadli, shrank upon itself more and more.” The second volume of. the work cited did not appear till 1914, when Eating’s notes were edited by his old pupil, Enno Littmann. The following note occurs on page 227 : “ In the autumn of 1913, newspapers announced that Ibn Saud had pressed forward to the Persian Gulf, seized Qatif, and was in process of subduing even Oman and Muskat. He is said to be planning the conquest of Mecca and Medina once again.” A. G. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Southern Area. lebuk was seized by Arab forces on October 12, two hundred Turks and several machine guns being captured. The Turks evacuated all their posts north of Kalaat el-Akhdar, not without molestation from the Arabs, who harassed their with- drawal, capturing considerable quantities of material and supplies. Sherifs Ali and Abdullah are concentrating their forces near the railway and the Beduins are flocking to their standards. A telegram from Mecca dated October 15 states that the Ivmg has received news from Emir Ali that Fakhri Pasha has sent to the latter a verbal request for a three days’ armistice. This has been refused. General. ■ ^ ie eiltr T ^ ie ^herifian troops into Damascus the attitude of eighty per cent of the population was one of frenzied enthusiasm. The demonstrations of joy exceeded all expectations, and the dissentient groups, which undoubtedly exist, have, for tie time being, judged it wise to join the majority. The i genan element with about six hundred followers, attempted to assume civil control, and when turned out, made inflam- niatory speeches calling upon the mob as Moslems to expel the let mans, the tools of the Christians. The reactionaries were suppressed by the Damascenes. The local attitude towards the British is one of gratitude, mixed with a slight suspicion that w® are interested. Tim Christian community, which had hopes ol foreign conquest, is disappointed.357 — The situation in the Lebanon is at present involved. The expulsion of the Turks took place almost without bloodshed, and local Moslem committees immediately took control and hoisted the Arab flag, but received no support from the Sherif : in consequence, since October 1, no government has existed. In Damascus, existing machinery continues under the Arab Military Governor, all officials being Arab. Sanitation, public lighting, tramways and police, are being restored to peace standard, but the complete neglect of these in 1917 by the Turks and the disappearance of all local draught animals in the last fortnight, make progress necessarily slow. Home Rule has been declared in the Hauran, under the general control of the Arab Military Governors, for provincial needs. The system, when communications can be restored, will be as in 1914. On its own initiative the Arab population of Northern Syria has been as prompt as the Lebanon to raise the Arab flag. Palmyra on the east and Kalaat el-Husn on the north have already declared their allegiance to King Husein. No further progress report has been received, but the movement may be expected to spread as far as the Antioch-Meskene line. [Late News.—Southern Area .—The total number of prisoners taken at Tebuk is considerably larger than at first reported. Four officers and three hundred other ranks were captured, and the booty includes four mountain howitzers and six machine guns. In a letter to his father, dated October 12, Sherif Abdullah reports that recent raids, initiated by him, have brought in seventy prisoners.]358 — Khurma. NOTES. Mr. Philby reports, under date September 25, that Ibn Shuleiwih, a sheikh of the Maqata section of the Ateiba, recently attacked Khurma. [Note.— Ibu Shuleiwih is possibly the son of Shalih, a chief of one or two sub-sections of A1 Bisasah, which forms a unit of the Maqata division of the Barqa of Rukba. The popularity of diminutive forms of names in Nejd has been noted by Palgrave, and an interesting example, will be found in Bulletin No. 97, page 256.] The Ateiba, at first successful, were attacked and defeated by the Ikhwan, Ibn Shuleiwih and his nephew being slain. The last phase of the fighting occurred at Hufeiyira in the neighbourhood of Harrat Qishab. The tribal situation is obscure. According to a recent report from Mecca, the Maqata, under the Sheikh Sultan ibn Himayid have gone over to Wahhabism. Sherif Shakir is reported to have moved from Marran {see page 339) to Muweih Hakran, which he left for an unknown destination. It appears that an engagement between Shakir and the Ikhwan subsequently developed.at the Hunnu Wells, sixteen miles east of Khurma. Mr. Philby’s news of the encounter is gathered from the reports of certain Ageyl, who, having no stomach for the fight, made off on their dhaluls before the en counter began. They state that Shakir’s force was annihilated, and he himself captured. Confirmation of this report is lacking. An edition of the Qibla, which has not yet reached us, apparently prepares the way for an admission of defeat by the Sherifians. Mr. Philby’s information, which does not tally with that coming from Hejaz sources (see page 339), is that Shakir was the aggressor and attacked on King Husein’s instructions. This is assumed as a matter of course by Ibn Saud, who seizes the opportunity to decline responsibility for the actions of the people of Khurma and their allies. At the same time, however, he undertakes^ not to intervene, provided that the King takes no uither action against him and that we help him in his campaign against the Shammar. His guarantee is somewhat shadowy, seeing that he will not pledge himself to restrain the Neidis irom going to the help of the people of Khurma. Fakhri Pasha has sent letters to Ibn Saud congratulating hun on the victory of the Ikhwan over “ the rebel Husein ” and oireimg him arms, ammunition, machine guns and money. He does not, however, explain how he proposes to send them! Ibn Saud s Campaign against the Shammar. ti tWO P^V c ^P a ^^ es and Hail are again at war. . )I1 ^ au( ma y claim to have won the first round on points : he has heartened his supporters but apprised the enemy of his intentions The following account of hostilities is taken from a telegram of Mr. I hilby s, dated September 23 :—Ibn Rashid, ignorant of his adversary’s intentions, left Hail about September 7 on a raid against the Harb whom he attacked at Humeiliya about September 11. His capture of thirty camels cost him ten men killed. Learning of Ibn Sand’s approach, he hastily returned to Sabaan to collect his baggage. Meanwhile Ibn Sand, waiting three days at Farafia for a contingent from Ghat Ghat, did not reach Quseiba till September 13, whence he marched next day to the Ajfar wells, one day’s journey east of Hail. A force of Shammar, who had been watering at the es-Sidr wells, one day east-north-east of Hail, decamped, and Ibn Sand learned through patrols that Ibn Rashid was keeping the Eid '»©n September 16 at Sabaan. On September 17, Ibn Sand marched to es-Sidr, whence he sent out two parties under Lahad ibn Muammar and Feisal ibn Hashra, himself following with the main body. (For the dubious antecedents of the former'worthy see Bulletin No. 91, page 180.) From his scouting parties Ibn Sand learned, first, that Ibn Rashid had returned hurriedly 7 to Hail, leaving Ibn Shureim with the baggage in qasrs at Sabaan ; and, secondly, that the Beni Yasraf Shammar, with great herds of camels and ^heep, had occupied the line Hhaba-Akass-Sefaila : the latter place is about a mile east of Hail. Meanwhile, leaving a garrison to defend Hail. Ibn Rashid took up his stand in the hill-stronghold of Maaiwij Baqa, about three hours north-east of Hail. Ibn Sand first turned his attention to the Beni Yasraf. The Ikhwan killed thirty of them, and captured one thousand five hundred camels and three thousand sheep. The Nejdian losses amounted to only two men and three horses killed. Their cavalry then rode round the walls of the Shammar capital challenging the defenders to come out and fight. The garrison replied with rifle fire. Ibn Sand then held a council of war at which it was decided that no attack should be made on the Maaiwij Baqa stronghold, and withdrew his force to es-Sidr, intercepting en route a small convoy of camels conveying ten thousand rounds of ammunition from Hail to Maaiwij Baqa. He reached Ajfar, and on the morning of September 22 set out for Quseiba. On September 26 Mr. Philby reported that Ibn Sand’s force there numbered six thousand of whom five thousand were Ikhwan. All, save nine hundred horsemen, were mounted on camels. Orders have been issued for a general mobilization of the forces of Central Nejd, which are estimated at twenty thousand or more, though it' is doubtful whether they are all equipped with modern rifles. Ibn Sand’s plan is to throw out scouts to watch Ibn Rashid’s every movement and to use Tarafia as a base for continual raids. If Ibn Rashid leaves Hail, Ibn Sand will at once advance on it. Mr. Philby considers that the honour of the Shammar is at stake, and that Ibn Rashid is bound to collect the Shammar forces and accept the challenge.360 — News reached King Husein on October 8, that a great fight had taken place between the two rivals to the north-west of Bureida in the direction of Hail, and that the casualties on both sides were heavy. The King by no means welcomes these hostilities and affects to regard four-fifths of the Shammer as his own adherents. Personal Relations between King Husein and Ibn Sand. Mr. Philby writes on September 26 that a messenger who was sent with a letter from Ibn Saud to the King was sent back with the letter unopened. The King spoke disparagingly of Ibn Saud, and ordered the messenger to leave Mecca on pain of execution. On his return journey he was detained six days by Sherif Shakir. The letter, with its seal intact, is in the possession of Mr. Philby. Enquiries are being made. King Husein on hearing of the occupation of Damascus, granted a more or less general amnesty to prisoners in the Government prisons. The sons of Salih Fadl, in whom Ibn Saud is interested, were among those liberated. Yemen. The two sons of Yahya esh-Shaif {see page 333) who are now in Aden, have come to solicit our help in money and munitions against the Turks. They make no mention of King Husein, and appeal to us to assist them to expel the Turks from the Yemen. The latter have discontinued the subsidies they promised to the Bekil, and one of the objects of the delegation is to secure a promise from His Majesty’s Government that, in the event of our occupation of the country, we will grant them the privileges they formerly received from the Turks.* ARAB BULLETIN.

It was not, however, as successful as that of 1917, as a result mainly of the strained relations existing between King Husein and Ibn Sand. The numbers totalled forty-four thousand as against fifty-eight thou sand last year. Then Nejdis formed the bulk of the pilgrims from outside the Hejaz : over twelve thousand reached Mecca, including Abd er-Rahman, Ibn Sand’s brother, and the latter would have been there but for a touch of sun-stroke on the way. This year, on the other hand, he issued orders that none of his followers were to go. As a result the very few present came incognito. With regard to the Imam Yahya, too, events left something to be desired. Some ten thousand armed Yemenis (including eight thousand Zeidis)—three times as many as last year—started for Mecca. But so persistently had rumour thrown suspicion on their intentions that the King showed considerable nervousness, and had most of them disarmed at Taif, the rest at Mecca. Apparently they accepted the situation without resentment; and he is said to have pleased them shortly afterwards by tactful remarks in a public address at Arafat. Of the rest of the pilgrims some seven thousand came by sea (one thousand fewer than last year), including fourteen hundred and fifty Indians, five hundred and eighty-five Egyptians, and four thousand and sixty-five Sudanese. Among the few who came from North-West Africa was Sayid Mohammed ibn Sasi, the new French representative at Mecca. He brought the King some handsome presents from the French Government, comprising silk carpets, gold watches, diamond pins, gold chains, field-glasses and pistols. On each was inscribed “from the French Nation in memory of the Pilgrimage of 1336 (i.e. 1917).” He is an Algerian, and is said to be less intelligent than his predecessor, Cherchali. The Senussi sent two men. In spite of his relations with Italy they expressed strong anti-Italian sentiments, de scribing the alliance as ephemeral. No case of plague or any epidemic was reported, though the quarantine arrangements were haphazard and unsatisfactory. The streets of Mecca, near the Haram particularly, are said to have been cleaned and generally improved under the directions of Sheikh Abdul Kader Abdu, then chief of the Municipality. The roads were well guarded throughout, and the pilgrims seem to have been given every facility en route. Further and more detailed reports are expected shortly-— 362 — THE AJMAN QUESTION, The Political Agent at Kuweit has sent the following account of the Ajman question. About the end of the year 1916 Sultan ibn Hithlein, their paramount sheikh, gave a written undertaking that the tribe would not leave our territory without permission, but most of them eventually went off to Ibn Rashid and Ajeimb In February 1917, Sheikh Jabir died and Salim reigned in his stead. In the middle of 1917 Ibn Sand who had already begun to tax the Awazim, an essentially Kuweit tribe, induced them to leave Kuweit and settle in his own territory. Sheikh Salim’s reply to this move was to make advances to the Shammar and Ajman, and by the beginning of October 1917 the latter had moved en masse into Kuweit territory. Much correspondence took place between the two rulers, but Ibn Sand refused to restore the Awazim, and when Colonel Hamilton, Political Agent, Kuweit, visited Nejd, he claimed that he was within his rights in his action in connection with this tribe. However, knowing that he was in the wrong, he expressed himself ready to return the filched tribe if Sheikh Salim would turn out the Ajman and cut off his relations with the Shammar, the enemies of himself and the British Government. Eventually an understanding was arrived at on these lines and the Awazim were returned. Despite this the Ajman remained in Kuweit territory, and at the beginning of 1918 the disposal of this tribe had become a burning question. In February 1918, it was decided that the most satisfactory settlement of the matter would be for the British Government to take the Ajman under their protection at Zubeir or elsewhere on the Shamiyah side, and on March 6, 1918, the following agreement was signed by the Political Agent (Colonel Hamilton), Sheikh Salim and Dheidan ibn Hithlein (the leading Ajman Sheikh) :— After consulting the wishes of their friend and ally H.E. Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, Imam of Riyadh and Hakim of Nejd, Hasa and its dependences ; and after paying due regard to the intercession on their behalf of H.E. Sheikh Salim el-Mubarak, Hakim of the Sultanate of Kuweit and its dependencies, in whose territory and under whose protection the tribe of Ajman are now dwelling, and having regard to the general policy of friendliness of the British Government towards the rulers, tribes and people of Iraq and the Jezirat-ul-Arab, it has seemed good to the British Government to overlook the breach of the agreement made last year with Sultan ibn Hithlein and some sections of the Ajman, and to enter into relations with this tribe for the second time. Therefore the British Government is willing to accept the sub mission of the Ajman and to take them under its protection for the period of one year or until the end of the war on the conditions underm en tioned.(i) That Dheidan ibn Hithlein, Sultan ibn Hithlein, and all the sheikhs o£ the Ajman tribe now settled in Kuweit territories do subscribe in writing to this undertaking. (ii) That the Ajman tribe will move its encampment to within territories occupied or administered by the British forces and will settle in a locality appointed by the British Political authorities. (iii) That the Ajman will not re-enter Kuweit territory or market in Kuweit (which must be regarded as absolutely out of bounds for the tribe) without permission of the British Officer in political charge of them and after notice has been previously given to H. E. the Sheikh of Kuweit. (iv) That immediately after the execution of this undertak- ing by them, the Ajman tribe will move in the direction of Zubeir and await orders as to their destination. (v) If and when these terms have been subscribed to by Sheikhs Dheidan ibn Hithlein, Sultan ibn Hithlein and other sectional chiefs of the tribe, the British Government will extend to them the same measure of protection and place them on exactly the same allowances as in the case of Ibn Suweit and the Dhafir tribe. Note. —It should be understood that these restrictions do not refer to individuals of the Ajman tribe such as Pidawiya, pearlers, and others of the tribe engaged in similar industries whose livelihood is obtained in Kuweit. But the prohibition is absolute in regard to the principal sheikhs, sections and their tribal followings. After some delay the tribe took up their residence at Shuwaibdah ncrth of Zubeir, but since then much raiding has taken place between them and the Muteir and Beni Hajir, and they have also raided a number of Ibn Sand’s caravans in Kuweit territory. Until the acceptance by the British Government in July 1918, of certain friendly overtures made by Sheikh Salim, he did nothing to prevent this raiding, in spite of the agreement on the subject. Ibn Sand strongly resented this and repre sented that in this and other matters his interests were not being properly looked after by Government, and in August it was decided that a British post should be established to guard the Safwan wells, that Sheikh Salim should guard Jahara and other Kuweit watering-places, while with his consent Ibn Saud was to be authorized to occupy Hafar on the boundary of Kuweit territory. In addition, hostages were to be taken from the leading sheikhs of the Ajman (and also from certain friendly Shammar who were implicated in the raiding), and further raiding be punished by stoppage of supplies.— 364 — THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE YEMEN. A leading clansman of the Bakil, Nakib Mohammed ibn Yehia esh-Shaif, wrote to Aden on November 7, asking that the British Government should refuse to support the Imam in future on the ground that he had, for many reasons, lost the confidence of his subjects. Among the charges brought against him were that he had confiscated property wholesale ; that he had imprisoned the sons of various notables as hostages ; that he had systematically obstructed education ; that he had deliberately sown dissension among his tribes ; and that he had been guided mainly by personal prejudice and interest in his distribution of the Zikat. The letter, which was vague in its terms, closed with a suggestion that Great Britain should intervene, call a council of Yemen chiefs, and assist them to replace the present despotism by ordered government. Colonel Jacob has used these representations—typical of many which have emanated from the same source—as the occa sion for a brief survey of Yemen affairs in general. It may be summarized as follows The Imam has not yet had a fair chance. Turkish misrule is responsible for the chaos in the Yemen. The reason for the defection of the Bakil and Hashid has been a purely pecuniary one. The Turks paid them a regular subsidy on the Imam’s behalf till shortly before the war ; it then dwindled and, during the war, ceased altogether. At the present moment the Bakil are, as they realise, between the devil and the deep sea. If Great Britain supports the Imam and pays him a regular subsidy their chances of benefiting, in view of their recent activities, will be smaller than ever. Therefore their policy is to blacken his reputation and strike for independence. The Idrisi probably had a hand in the dictating of the letter, which suits his own purpose very well. It must be borne in mind, too, that, if the Imam is intolerable to his subjects, it is their job not ours—in these days—to evict him. Accordingly it would seem inadvisable for us to tamper with any of his tribesmen behind his back. But it is highly desirable that we should be able to act as mediators in the final settlement. The best policy would appear to be to give him every chance of success by furnishing him with money and support, so long as he behaves himself properly. With regard to his antagonism to the Idrisi, we can firmly point out that the latter is our actual and his potential friend. It is not likely that he will fail to realize now where his interests lie in such matters. Apart from anything else we can, as he knows only too well, bring immediate pressure to bear upon him by our control of his ports at any time. With such a policy w r e should be able safely to let the forces in the Yemen work themselves out, acting where necessary— 365 — in a mediatory capacity, and aiming steadily at the realization of the Arabia for the Arabs under the British aegis ” idea, which for a long time has appeared the most desirable solution for the Yemen, and at the moment is conveniently in keeping with the trend of politics elsewhere. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. Southern Area. Before the conclusion of the armistice with Turkey on October 31, plans had been made for the reduction of stations north of Medina, and Mudarij was actually captured by the Arabs. The capture of Medain Salih was assigned to Sheikh Sultan el-Faqir, who was given two old guns from Teima. He succeeded in surrounding the town and an unsuccessful sortie of the garrison was heavily punished, thirty-three Turks being killed and twenty-one taken prisoners. Abu Naam was attacked by Emir Farhan el-Aida who claims the capture of thirty prisoners. Sheikh Hamad el-Mongara (page 308) had sworn to take el-Ula, while the section Istabl Antar—Bueir was allotted to the Iriwa branch of the Juheina. The Iriwa are reported to have done good work in this area. They live in the mountains hard by. Sherifs Ali and Abdullah moved in October to el-Ayun and el-Jafr. With Abdullah went twelve mounted companies of Ateiba, thousands of Juheina, Beni Mohammed and Huteim. So numerous was the band that it took eight days to move out of Wadi Eis. The situation in Medina itself is obscure. Accord ing to the Beduins’ report the Turks have evacuated all points north of el-Ula. YEMEN. (a) Unrest in the Udein Area. In August Sheikh Abdullah ibn Abdul Wahid, the most powerful of the Udein sheikhs, reported to Aden that in the previous May the Turkish Governor of the Yemen had made an agreement with the Imam to hand over certain districts to him in exchange for a loan. Amongst these were Ibb and Udein. Other reports received both then and later were to the effect that the Turks had ceded all the Yemen as far as Dhala and Qataba. [See Yo. 102, p. 309 ; and 104, p. 334.] Abdullah’s visit to Aden was therefore thought to be due to a desire on his part to come to terms with us before the agreement was ratified.366 — Whatever the truth of these reports, the Turks did not cease their extortion in the Udein area. At the end of September Mahmud Nedim appeared with a considerable force and endeavoured to levy a big war contribution. He had previously summoned two of the sons of the late Ali Abdullah Pasha, the Sheikh of Udein, to Ibb, and detained them there as hostages. He found however that he had struck a hornet’s nest. Sharp fighting took place in which his force suffered heavy casualties. As a result serious disagreements are reported to have occurred between him and both Said Pasha and Ghalib Bey ; and he was unable to apprehend Abdullah ibn Abdul Wahid, who refused to surrender. The Turks succeeded, on the other hand, owing to the fact that they held the above mentioned hostages at Ibb, and to the intervention of the Khadi and Mayor of Taiz, in patching up a truce favourable in the main to themselves. By it the sheikhs are reported, on uncertain authority, to have paid a fine of twenty- five thousand dollars and to have tendered further hostages for their good behaviour. (6) Turkish Extortion in Zabid. On September 16 Mahmud Nedim is said to have left the Udein area for Zabid, accompanied by Ahmed Taufiq Pasha, the Yemen Corps Commander, and Mohammed Nuri Bey, acting Governor of Taiz. The notorious Uias Bey, of Abu Ras fame, had apparently preceded him. In the middle of October they were reported to be busily engaged in extracting a war contribution. They had taken some hostages, as in the Udein area, and had been endeavouring to disarm the population. Many merchants in Zabid have made big profits during the war, but the populace generally is wretchedly poor. It is not unlikely therefore that serious trouble may have resulted. (c) Imam's Attitude to Surrender of Turkish Garrisons. The Imam, in answer to requests that he should facilitate the surrender of the Turkish forces in the Yemen to the nearest allied commander, according to the terms of the Armistice, has so far taken up the attitude that, so far from helping them, he well not allow them to go till they have paid off what they owe him. It appears that their subsidy amounted to L.T. 3,000 to L.T. 4,000 a month. The amount of their outstanding debts to him is uncertain. The surrender of the garrisons at Lahej and on the Red Sea coast can be carried out independently of him. But those in the Sanaa region are completely in his power. (d) Distress in Hodeida District. Great distress is said to prevail in the Hodeida district owing to the Wadi Seham not having flooded. In other parts of the Tihama locusts have done great damage to the crops.— 367 — 7JB ASIR. Since the issue of the last Bulletin a series of considered appreciations have been received from Captain Clayton, liaison officer with the Idrisi. The following is a precis of his reports arranged under separate headings for convenience :— (a) Military Events. The vague report of the evacuation of Loheiya by the Idrissian forces, received from Aden by telegram on September 23 (see page 341), turned out to be true. They abandoned it on September 15, but held on to el-Atn-the source of its water supply—five miles due E. By the middle of October however they had been ejected from el-Atn too and were holding el-Ganda eight miles E.N.E. of Loheiya. The Turks had, by this time, made el-Atn their main position, and were standing on the defensive. A series of haphazard attacks by the Arabs failed to dislodge them, and the general situation remained unchanged till the receipt of the news of the armistice on November 1. (b) The Failure of the Idrissian Army. During this campaign the Idrisi’s forces actually out numbered those of the Turks steadily in the proportion of three to one (i.e. three to four thousand against nine to twelve thousand) ; potentially they outnumbered them, on his own showing, by a much larger margin. Apart, too, from this numerical preponderance, the strategical situation, backed as they were by British men-of-war, was entirely in their favour. Yet, on the receipt of the news of the armistice, they were in a position tantamount to defeat. Their failure, according to a report from Aden of October 31, was being widely commented on throughout the Yemen Tihama. Captain Clayton ascribes it to several reasons, the chief of which are :— (1) The Decline in the Morale of the Arabs in General. This is due, not to degeneracy, but to a complete change of mental attitude, for which the present war is largely responsible. Turkey filled the ordinary Asir tribesman’s horizon in the old days ; and Idrisi’s men fought the Turks with whole-hearted fanaticism over a series of points of difference, mainly religious. The war has forced upon the Arab mind a new consciousness of the overwhelming wealth, proximity and power of western civilization, by comparison with which that of Turkey is second rate. This enlightenment has acted with peculiar force in Asir, where the tribesmen are unusually ignorant. Che appearance of aeroplanes in particular, has had a great effect upon them. The idea of Arab nationality, for which they are told they are fighting, fails to arouse any burning sense of enthusiasm, as did the religious questions of the past. They feel their comparative— 368 — impotence and are content to let the Great Powers settle the issue, while they clamour for maximum pay and take minimum risks. Many of the operations planned against Loheiya were postponed or abandoned owing to nothing more than squabbles over money, which absorbed all Seyyid Mustafa’s time, to the exclusion for instance, of the manning of new guns. (2) Lack of Leaders. There were none of any real worth. Sayyid Mustafa, Mustafa el-Nueimi, and Sherif Hamud are mentioned by Captain Clayton as being better than the rest. Sayyid Mustafa was easily the best, being whole-hearted, honest, of untiring energy, and possessing great influence. But even he was of little use for he took too much on himself, would not accept advice, and allowed himself to be side-tracked by irrelevancies. After these there was positively no one. (3) Failure of the Supply Organization. Sheer mismanagement in several instances brought opera tions to a standstill for want of supplies of which there should have been abundance. The wastage, too, of water food and ammunition was enormous. (4) Specific Instances of Failure. These and similar shortcomings wrecked each successive plan. The abandonment of Loheiya on September 15 was attri buted to lack of water, though more than ample was b&amp;ng landed by H.M. ships, and the retreat was totally unjustifiable. A plan to recapture the place was fully mature on September 27, when Sherif Hamud said that he must have three hundred water bottles, which were both unprocurable and unnecessary. The whole scheme was given up on that account. On October 22, H.M.S. Espiegle offered to go in to within seven thousand yards of el-Atn and fire salvoes at the Turkish positions there. El-Nueimi, in command at el-Ganda, said that his organization was incom plete, and cancelled the arrangements. Next night however he attacked without any support from the Espiegle, and without warning, with the result that he could not maintain his advance. All of these three operations should have succeeded had there been any proper discipline or co-ordination in carrying them out. In a conversation with the Idrisi and Sayyid Mustafa Captain Clayton had even to suggest that they should form a reserve, which they had apparently disregarded altogether. Captain Clayton finally gives it as his opinion that the Idrisian army, in anything like its present state, is unlikely to be a factor of any importance whatsoever. (c) Character of the Idrisi. Captain Clayton points out that the Idrisi is too remote from his army to affect its efficiency in the field. His main value for us lies rather in his domestic policy, where he stands for order in circumstances that might otherwise be chaotic.— 369 — During the recent operations he has done his best in the face of great difficulties, and has on the whole been sane and reasonable. Being naturally shrewd and somewhat of an adventurer, and having so long a sea-board, he will probably make every effort to arrive at a permanent rapprochement with Great Britain. In character he is variable. Sometimes he has shown con siderable strength, as when he enforced the modification of a particularly barbarous form of circumcision practised in Asir. On other occasions he has appeared in a different light; he rejected Dr. Fadl ed-Din’s proposal to start a hospital at Midi or Jizan on the ground that he would not dare let his people see sixty to one hundred wounded ; and preferred to put them in a makeshift at el-Fasht instead. (rf) The Surrender of the Turkish Garrisons. The problem with regard to the surrender of the Turkish garrisons in the Idrisi’s area is two-fold : first, to provide for their safety ; and, secondly, to avoid offending the susceptibilities of the Idrisi. The garrisons involved, as being nearer to Captain Kettlewell, commanding Espiegle than to any other allied commander, are those in the Zohra-Abs district, Saada, Ebha and Muhail. Captain Clayton had apparently received no instructions as to Muhail at the time of his last report. But action had already been taken with regard to the rest. An official request for surrender was addressed to each by Captain Kettlewell; and Idrisi was asked to add a letter guaran teeing their safety while passing through his territory. With regard to the Zohra-Abs front and Saada he readily agreed, being amused in connection with the latter at the thought of the Imam’s discomfiture on losing his Turkish supporters. But he was unwilling to do the same in connection with Ebha, on the ground that it was a bone of contention between King Husein and himself, and that the former might view such action as intrigue; finally, however, he added two lines as a postscript to Captain Kettlewell s letter. Captain Clayton suggested that, since time was no object as compared with safety, the Turkish garrisons should concentrate where possible and march armed to the coast protected by Idrisi’s tribesmen. The Idrisi again agreed, and his desire to stand on good terms with Great Britain should ensure his protecting the garrisons provided that a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at with regard to the disposal of their arms and war material. Captain Clayton points out that the Zohra-Abs front presents few difficulties. The surrender of all the Turks there can pro bably be carried out in a few days. Saada is more difficult as being further away ; but the Turks have not much material there, and the Imam can step in and take possession without dispute.Iff — 370 — Ebha is by far the hardest problem of all. First, it is a bone of contention between the Iclrisi and King Husein, as was said above ; and, secondly, the Turks dumped there a great quantity of shells which had been collected in the Yemen for the Italian War and were held up in the vicinity when being transported back to Europe for the Balkan War. The existence of this dump is widely known. If the Turks are told to bring it with them to the coast they will be the more liable to be attacked en route. If they abandon it, there will be a scramble for it. In any event, however, unless some one steps into Ebha “an inland Gibraltar” as soon as they leave, trouble will ensue. Captain Clayton has suggested to Aden that the Idrisi should be allowed to occupy the place either temporarily pending the settlement of all such claims at the Peace Congress or permanently, in exchange for his claim to Kunfida. ft NOTES. The Arab Bulletin. The long interval which has elapsed since our last number appeared on October 22 needs little explanation. The successes there recorded swept away the Northern Area from our columns ; it only remains to note the activities of the southern armies since that date, and Fakhri Pasha’s refusal to carry out the terms of the armistice with Turkey so far as his force is concerned. Reports from the whole of the Arabian world testify to the profound effect which the British victories have produced on the native mind. In Mesopotamia an unprecedented number of sheikhs gathered to congratulate the authorities ; Syria has itself seen the headlong flight of the Turks ; as for Arabia—Ibn Rashid is now a paid vassal of King Husein, while Ibn Sand’s silent obedience to our orders is not without significance. The situa tion in Asir is discussed on page 367. In the Yemen, the Turkish Governor is negotiating with the Imam for the evacuation of the garrison. The political state of Arabia during the next few months and the Intelligence system adopted in the occupied territories will determine whether the Bulletin can continue to serve any useful purpose. King Husein and Ibn Rashid. King Husein has officially informed the High Commissioner that Ibn Rashid has acknowledged his sovereignty and sued for permission to trade with Mesopotamia. The King has asked us to consider this application and suggests that Shammar chiefs who hold permits signed by their Emir should be allowed to obtain supplies.371 — A letter from Sherif Hasan was received at Wejh on November 24. The writer states that hostilities have ceased in Qasim. Meanwhile it was reported from Baghdad, under date November 9, that Ibn Sand had written to say that fbn Rashid has sent a deputation to establish friendly relations with him. Khurma. We print below a translation of the King’s version of Shakir’s last defeat at Khurma. The passage quoted in No. 216 of the “ Qibla,” dated September 30. “ Official Announcement. “ The public is hereby informed of the truth of what befell the expedition despatched to el-Khurma against those who have violated the laws of Islam. Having dumped their heavy baggage at the well el-Moya, the force marched into the valley to recon noitre, and repulsed the enemy in two preliminary encounters. When an estimate of the opposing force had been made, the attack was opened and the enemy were put to flight. The troops composing our left wing, whose duty it was to engage the Ruqa tribe, left their station to pursue the enemy’s centre which had given way. The commander of our forces suspected these people of treachery and his suspicions were justified when they turned on him and attacked the camp. The enemy thus freed from our pressure was able to reform and escape from his serious plight. Our main force thereupon returned to the place where the baggage had been stored. The Markaz grasped the situation, readied the commander, and gave him fresh instructions, where upon the force resumed its activities. A narration of the casualties and moral and material losses would be tedious and is dispensed with.” Captain Goldie reports from a trustworthy source that Shakir lost over three hundred men killed. If this be true, the engagement was an unusually sanguinary one and points to the bitter animosity existing between the rival claimants to Khurma. Captain Goldie’s informant states that the Ruqa seized Shakir and stripped him of his arms ; they told him that, as he was one of them, they could not take him prisoner, but they themselves were determined to go over to Khalid. Another informant, whose story Captain Goldie is disposed to credit, states that Arabs loyal to the King have intercepted despatches from Khalid to Ibn Sand, demanding that reinforcements be sent to Khurma. Captain Goldie states that a report is current locally that the Buqum and Taraba have asked help of the Sherifian force at Asheira and also of the King. They appeal for aid against “the heretics who are residing in our district. If you do not help us we shall be obliged to submit to them. But, if you do send aid, do not send any of the treacherous Ateiba.”]fm Saud and, the Idrisi. There is reason to think that Ibn Sand is fully alive to the possibility of extending Ids influence towards Yemen and Asir. Mr. Philby instances the letter which certain Asir and Yemen chiefs sent him in August, backed by the Turkish commandant, and the regular appeals which the Mudir of Qahtan has been making to him. Early this month Idrisi became anxious over a reported gathering of Ibn Sand’s tribesmen east of the Qahtan, and sent to Aden for reassurance. Mr. Philby thinks it highly improbable, however, that he can be contemplating active measures in this area at present, owing to his financial straits. Mineral Wealth in the Hejaz. Sheikh Mohammed el-Arabi, a Moroccan, who was formerly in el-Ula, and is now an Intelligence agent of the French in Wejh, has settled in the Hejaz with the object of exploiting the mineral wealth he asserts it contains. He has told Major Davenport that there are two oil springs at Dhibba, near the coast, which could easily be tapped by a pipe line. He asserts that the hills round el-Ula contain silver, iron and lead. Politics in Damascus. It is reported from Damascus that a large section of the Damascus public have shown disapproval of the action of the Sherifian authorities which resulted in Emir Abd el-Qadir being shot while resisting arrest (see page 350). There are three distinct political parties in the town : one favours a pan-Arab policy, and is composed of Moslem fanatics and place-hunters ; another—the great majority—supports the Sheriffs cause, but recognize the necessity for external help ; the third—embracing the educated Moslems and all the Christians—desire a more direct foreign control.SECRET Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, January 11, 1919 No. 108 SUMMARY HEJAZ SUPPLIES AND SUBSIDIES.

Cornwallis, Lieut.-Colonel, Director, Arab Bureau.HEJAZ SUPPLIES AND SUBSIDY. Although our future relation to the financial and other economic problems of Hejaz cannot yet be settled, some progress has been made in outlining an interim policy to be followed in regard to supplies and subsidy as soon as the state of war has definitely ceased there and peace requirements can be estimated. In conversation with Lieut.-Col. Wilson in November last, King Husein readily agreed that the food supplies sent monthly to Hejaz for more than two years past should cease altogether “a month or two” after the fall of Medina. He recognized that they have been given for purely military purposes and will be out of place under peace conditions. He asked only that sufficient tonnage should be detailed by India to supply their equivalent in the ordinary way of trade. Cargo space will be required for 1,300 to 1,500 tons per mensem, over and above what the trading ships, which now habitually call at Jiddah, can furnish. If India can arrange for another monthly ship of this capacity, various beneficial results may be expected. The Hejazis having to buy their own necessaries of life would disgorge gold : the King’s customs receipts would once more supply him with a considerable revenue outside subsidy, and Jiddah trade and the commercial spirit throughout the country would be encouraged. It will be well also, in order to promote the same ends, to favour the shipment of other commodities, of which Hejaz has need and has been deprived during the war, notably wood for construction. The richer townspeople have long been demanding it both for repairs and for building new houses ; and there is no doubt a substantial proportion of the gold which has been poured in by us as subsidy, will flow out again as soon as this and other costly materials can be put on the Hejaz markets. The commodities, which hitherto we have been giving gratis to Hejaz, used, at their maximum, to amount monthly to 1,531 tons, 5 cwts. sent to southern ports and 1,913 tons sent to Akaba i. e . a total per mensem of 3,444 tons, 5 cwts. Of this total atta (grain) was 920 tons : rice, 1,260 tons : coffee, 16 tons, 5 cwts : sugar, 48 tons : barley, /2o tons and tibn (chopped straw), 475 tons. The rice and tibn all came from Egypt. Of the rest, the proportion for southern ports came from India. Egypt supplied Akaba altogether. At the present moment of the above proportions only half is being shipped to Akaba, and two thirds to southern ports or, roughly, just under 2,000 tons per mensem to Hejaz as a whole. The Egyptian consignments have consti tuted a heavy drain on local'resources, and it will be a great relief to be able to discontinue them. The subsidy question does not promise so speedy and satis factory a solution as that of food supply. While the King has assured Lieut.-Col. Wilson that he contemplates a “ large reduc tion ” in money grants after the fall of Medina,, it being his intention to reduce Beduin allowances to the old standard ofsurra for the protection of Pilgrim roads and railway, he still vaguely forecasts a demand for about £120,000 per mensem. It is not known why he estimates his future needs at so large a sum : but he gave some indication that his total is not, in fact, so much an estimate of probable deficit, as a claim for compensation. As he has revealed more than once, he means to keep to the fore the general suggestion conveyed to him in Sir H. MacMahon’s verbal message of December 17, 1915, that H.M.G. might be willing to consider monetary compensation to the Arabs, if it eventually retained Basra. This suggestion he characteristically transforms into a promise of a payment to himself, and has even arrived at a figure—£125,000 per mensem —which he appears to believe was pledged to him. Needless to say, no figure was ever quoted and nothing beyond the above general suggestion was ever conveyed to him, in either writing or words by H.M.G. The King now states that he has always written off that figure from his subsidy as representing our just debt to himself. If this is a genuine case of self-delusion, as, on the whole, we incline to think it is, we shall have no little difficulty in adjusting matters with so obstinate and opinionated a claimant. Nor is it clear, whether the King has allowed for the proba bility that what he has hitherto had to appropriate to Feisal for northern operations, will be borne in the future by Syria. If he has not, then the £120,000 he asks for will be equivalent to about £200,000 of our previous payments and the reduction for southern Hejaz would be trivial. Whenever the King produces the detailed estimates, which he has promised us after the fall of Medina, it will be necessary to compare them as closely as possible with the pre-War Ottoman Budget for Hejaz. Especially will it be necessary to discover what proportion of Turkish payments to Hejaz were in the nature of religious appropriations from Efkaf properties ; for it is conceivable that, though the King may be reckoning these for lost in the future, we for our part, might well stipulate for their contin uance by the Peace Terms we shall impose on Turkey. To do so would probably be quite legitimate, seeing on what terms those properties are likely to have been originally assigned in mort main to the Efkaf. It is highly improbable that payments to Hejaz from them were made subject to a condition, either expressed or implied, that the centre of Islam must be under the political domination of the Ottoman Sultan. The figures of Turkish goverment disbursements on Hejaz so far supplied to us, certainly look as though some large item, such as Efkaf payments, were not included. The total of those figures for Hejaz, including Medina, but exclusive of postal and customs receipts, is L.T. 333,632 for a given year. Presumably this sum covered, among all other administrative salaries, the Ottoman personal allowance to the Emir of Mecca, which is understood to have amounted to about L.T. 12,000 per mensem. As the postal service was run at a loss, and local customs receipts,which produced a surplus o£ over L.T. 80,000, will accrue, of course, to the new government, the above total of disbursements, less some L.T. 40,000 receipts from local taxation, etc., which the King should be equally well able to collect, represents the new state’s total loss of revenue, according to the figures given to us from Constantinople. It is needless to point out the immense discrepancy between that total and the King’s, estimate of a deficit of £120,000 per mensem. Until, however, we have further infor mation we cannot be sure either that the Constantinople figures include all payments, religious and other (they represent probably those only made directly out of the Imperial Treasury), or that the King’s estimate took account of all possible post-war receipts. The Constantinople figures, however, may be taken as a safe general indication of what civil taxation, direct and indirect, may be expected to yield annually in Hejaz. Under the head of direct taxation we have L.T. 40,917 : under that of indirect taxation we have the customs L. 1. 85,791 and Postal Receipts, L.T. 6,946, together making a total administrative revenue of only L.T. 133,654. We shall have to make further enquiry whether the Emirs used to collect direct and indirect dues on their own account, and if so to what amount; and also whether the above sum of customs receipts represents the total collected, or only the total remitted to Constantinople : for we know that the product of the Jiddah customs used to be assigned, either wholly or in part, to the city of Mecca. Lastly, the Meccan Emirs had a Privy Purse largely supplied by revenues from family properties in Hejaz, Egypt and elsewhere. Before so complicated a matter is finally settled, it will probably be necessary to have jt exam ined by a financial commission, which must pursue enquiries both at Constantinople and in Hejaz. D.G.H. L I ^ THE IKHWAN AND THE WAHHABIS. Mr. H. S. J. B. Philby contributes the following statement:— “ The note which appeared under the above heading on p. 340 of the Arab Bulletin, is open to serious criticism on points of fact and aptly illustrates the tendency of Arabs everywhere to create facts to suit their prejudices. A Shammari speaking on the subject of the Ikhwan once said to me epigrammatically enough : Ma hum jaiyin min allah wa chin hum chilab —‘ they be not come from Grod, in sooth they be curs. the Juhaina A obviously thinks the same. Give a dog a bad name and if you know no facts against him, invent them. Elsewhere I have tried to give a reasoned account of the Ikhwan movement and here I only propose to follow the note above referred to sentence by sentence with counter statements of fact.4 — The Tkhwan do not control the Wahhabi movement ; they are the instrument of its leaders of whom the chief is Ibn Sand ; being Badawin with bees in their bonnets they are not always easy to control. •&gt; Their deliberations are not held in secret; I have frequently witnessed them, especially during Ramadan when they were held on the open roof of the palace ; they are naturally attended almost exclusively by the Ikhwan themselves because they are a little too strenuous for ordinary people ; they consist of Quran, Hadith and Tafsir readings (particularly passages relating to the terrors of Hell and the delights of Paradise) and sermons by Ibn Saud and Abdullah ibn Abdul Wahhab ; Ibn Saud has fre quently repeated to me in extenso sermons delivered by him on such occasions. Questions such as the Hail offensive and Ibn Sand’s motives in holding the Nejd Ikhwan back from Khurma were also common subjects of discussion. I never heard of any death sentence for betrayal of the proceedings ; on the contrary they are freely discussed in public. As regards dress and personal appearance the ideal of the Ikhwan is to imitate the practice of Mohammed as nearly as possible ; their dress is the dress of the ordinary Badawin—seldom more than a dirty smock girt with a cartridge belt; they do not shave their moustaches but trim them so as to be clear of the upper lip ; they trim their beards and wear the ordinary kajiya headdress with a fillet of white linen in place of the compressed woollen Aqal. The word Ikhwan is used to denote Badawin who have entered the inner circle of Wahhabism ; the rest are Hanbalis ; the word Mutawwa is restricted to the priests or LI lama of the sect. Non-Ikhwan sometimes contemptuously use the word Mutawwa of Ikhwan generally, just as the non-Wahhabis {e.g. people of Mecca) use the words Wahhabi or Mutawahhabin of the Hanbalis (Wahhabis). The word Mutawwa denotes one who makes others to obey {the law of God) not one who is utterly submissive. Tak — to obey; Tawwdk = to make to obey. They have no wish to cast off the name Muslim ; on the contrary they claim to be the only true Muslimin ; the ordinary salutation of the Ikhwan is “ Salam alaikum ya Muslimin”. TheWahhabis adhere strictly to the marriage laws of the Quran. Within the fold of matrimony the greatest license is permitted ; without it none. In Nejd adultery, fornication, sodomy and drunkenness are punishable with death and are practically unknown. They do go on pilgrimage, as the obligation to do so is imposed on them by the Quran. The House of God is sacred to them in spite of its pollution by the visits of the Mushrikin. Ziyara to the tomb of Mohammed as indeed to any burial place of their own people is permitted, but worship of any tomb is idolatry.Mohammed, though a mere mortal, was Rasul Allah, the Prophet of God, therefore his authority is greater than that of his fellows, but he is not entitled to be associated with God in worship. That would be Shirk, the most heinous of all offences against God* Ibn Sand is the head of the movement, but connives at no immorality. On that point both Kaunkiaer and, I think, Hamilton have libelled him. The ghazu is prohibited among the Ikhwan ; it is not correct to say that Ibn Saud does not collect zakat from his dependents ; the burden of taxation is very light in Nejd. As regards intercourse between Sherifians and Wahhabis, the almost open enmity of the two rulers must necessarily make it difficult. The Wahhabis regard the Sherif and his followers as Mushrikin (heretics) and the Sherif openly denounces Ibn Saud for leading the people from the true path. The Ikhwan naturally have never served with the Sherif. Such Wahhabis as have, enjoy the ordinary matrimonial rights and privileges of the rest of their fellow countrymen ; a wife cannot divorce her husband and, if she marries another while her husband is away, she and her paramour run serious risk of a horrible death. I never heard of the clothes, etc v of those who have served with the Sherif— and there are hundreds of them in Nejd—being laid out in the sun for four days ; they generally return the richer by a rifle and ample ammunition and funds and are warmly welcomed back by their families. The strictest Ikhwan, no doubt, only return the salutation of fellow Ikhwan, but that has no reference to Sherifian service. I estimate the number of Ikhwan at perhaps 30,000 men at the outside. Reduce Abdul Majid’s estimate of 300,000 by Doughty’s rule and we get my estimate.” KHURMA. No decisive encounter has as yet taken place between the opposing forces at Khurma. Counsels of patience have been strongly urged upon the King, and a message to Ibn Saud is to be despatched from Baghdad to the effect that, if he does not abstain from aggressive action and withdraw all Ikhwan forces operating west of Khurma, his subsidy will cease and the British authorities consider themselves free to take all measures which may appear desirable to secure peace. This does not impugn his de facto position at Khurma—a problem to be settled at the Peace Congress. A detailed analysis of the latest information regarding the causes of the present trouble and of the relative strength of the claims to Khurma, as advanced hitherto by both sides, is in course of preparation and will be published in the next issue of the Bulletin at an early date.MEDINA. Events have still to prove Fakhri Pasha’s precise reasons for refusing to surrender Medina. That he is acting in collusion with Ibn Saud is firmly believed by King Husein, and is very probable. Since the last Bulletin, two fresh pieces of evidence—neither, however, in itself conclusive—have come to hand. First, the Turkish envoy, on his return from Medina, asserted that Fakhri was in touch with the Yemen, Ibn Saud and Khalid * ; and, secondly, Ibn Rashid’s represen tative at Mecca told Colonel Wilson that he had frequently seen Ibn Sand’s camels in Medina, as recently, in fact, as last August. There is increasing evidence, on the other hand, that Fakhri is actuated, partly at any rate, by religious sentiment, and that he has inspired a large proportion of his garrison with a fanatical resolve to defend the Prophet’s Tomb. The relative strength of these and similar possible motives cannot yet be gauged with any precision ; but the story of his successive subterfuges in evading the terms of the Armistice—tabulated for convenience below proves at least the strength of his determination to hold out. (1) On November 10 he received the general en clair wireless message addressed by Ahmed Izzet Pasha, Minister for War at Constantinople, to all the garrisons in Hejaz, Asir and Yemen, ordering them to surrender to the nearest Allied commander. This was confirmed by a letter from Captain Garland at Yenbo. The answer, however, consisted of a brief note signed by the chief o£ staff. It did not reach Yenbo till December 14, and was to the effect that Fakhri was considering the matter, but was in doubt as to the authenticity of the wireless message. (2) On November 30 the latter was repeated in cipher, with the addition of a clause that Emir Ali was the Allied commander nearest to him. In reply he informed Yenbo, almost a week later, that telegraphic messages were in sufficient, and that he must have signed instructions from his Go vernment. (3) By this time it had become evident that he was playing for time. A messenger despatched with a note by Captain Garland, for example, was sent back with a request that he should return in four days since the intervention of the Prophet’s birthday prevented Fakhri from attending to an}/ other matters. It was accordingly arranged that a letter should be sent by special envoy from Constantinople ; and that Fakhri *11118 is almost certainly Khalid ibn Derwish, a leading Sheikh of the Abadua, who after many years of close relationship with Kino- Husein -who made him Emir of Khurma-became a convert to Wahhabism in 1914 and joined Ibn Saud. The King attributes the whole Khurma trouble to bis actions {see A.B., pp. 200, 229, 245, 246, 262, 307, 329)— 7 — should be informed that, unless he surrendered by midday December 15, the Dardanelles forts would be destroyed. The envoy, Captain Zia, formerly Fakhri’s adjutant, reached Yenbo, after some delay en route, on December 15. He proceeded at once to Medina, Fakhri’s time limit being extended by seventy-two hours to enable him to deliver his letters. On receipt of them, Fakhri again refused to surrender, on the ground that Clause 16 of the Armistice conditions— providing for the retention of sufficient troops to maintain orc t er _applied to Hejaz as well as Cilicia. Further, he would not let the envoy leave Medina, and closely restricted his movements within the town itself. As soon as this was known, on December 23, a state of war was declared to exist again, much to the delight of the Arabs, whose impatience it had been hard to restrain. (4) The envoy returned to Yenbo on December 24. The Arabs there gave him a hostile reception, though Captain Garland believes that he did his best in difficult circumstances. He brought a further message from Fakhri to the effect that, in addition to his military capacity, he was defender of the Prophet’s Tomb—a duty from which only a personal order from the Sultan could release him. To meet this new impasse it was decided that a senior officer should be sent at once from Constantinople to super sede him, carrying an Imperial Irade dismissing him from his command. This plan is being put into effect. On January 3 H.M.S. “Archer” reached Port Said having on board a Miralai and Haidar Bey, Turkish Minister of Justice. They carry the necessary trade, and on reaching Medina will declare Fakhri dismissed if he proves still impervious to reason. Captain Zia, on his return from Yenbo, expressed the opinion that Fakhri would prefer death to surrender unless he were promised a free passage with his whole force to Turkey. Money, food and forage, he said, were scarce in Medina. But Fakhri’s religious fanaticism, coupled with his thorough espionage system, had enabled him to preserve remarkable discipline ; and, in the last extremity, he could defend the Haram with 600 men for six months. Captain Zia appears, however, to have overrated the strength of Fakhri’s control. On January 1, his chief of staff, Emin Bey, gave himself up ; and his action has been the signal for whole sale desertion. On January 3, it was reported that some 1,000 of the garrison were en route for Bir Derwish. Emin Bey has stated that most of the remainder should follow suit almost immediately.— 8 — ALLEGED ARMS TRAFFIC BETWEEN NEJD AND HEJAZ. Towards the end of September Mr. Pliilby reported to aghdad that, according - to information which he had obtained from Riadh, an extensive traffic in British arms and ammunition was being carried on between Hejaz and Nejd. The sources of supply appeared to be two, Nejd mercenaries in the Heiaz army and dishonest Hejaz officials. Mr. Philby estimated that Ibn Sand himself had bought more than 800,000 rounds of ammuni tion, and that as much again was held by Nejdis privately. The ordinary price for a British short service rifle was forty to fifty dollars, while ammunition was being sold at from fifteen to twenty rounds a dollar. The Harb in particular were generally i umoured to have a very large supply. _ Immediate representations were made to the King, but they elicited only a vague and unsatisfactory reply, constituting indeed a virtual admission of his inability to control the Beduin to whom the majority of the rifles were necessarily issued. Incidentally he asserted that we had in any event, given Ibn Sand almost as many rifles as himself, a misstatement, for Ibn Saud has in the last eOOOO 7 ^ 1 ’ 8 reCeiVed ° nly 4 ’ 000 British rifles as a 8' ains t the King’s No adequate answer being forthcoming from the King inde pendent enquiries were pursued by Colonel Wilson With tegard to theCutces oi sup,,.,, he suggested that, in addition to the two given by Mr. Philby, the Turks might have sent consignments of captured British rifles into Nejd by caravan rom Damascus. This, however, while intrinsically not impro- W does not; seem actually to have happened. Mohammed tsasam, a Damascene notable who contracted for the Turkish Government on a large scale early in the war, stated that, as far as he was aware, no British rifles had reached Nejd in this wav I be only recent consignment sent there by the Turks he said consisted of 10,000 rounds and 2,000 rifles, probably Turkish’ despatched from Medina to Ibn Saud at the end of 1916 ’ •&gt; «'•' Wil “ •&gt;“&gt;• tefay css g ”'' were based apparently on nothing better than a report from a ”el mCht w^f 611 Ver ? a ' ly by Ibl ‘ Saud ; - d ^lonJ^Zol witiouhtroboratiofr 8 y a,ld C ° Uld n0t be number of hand j 51 wils ext i'e'nely probable that a certain tli r ■ t . nfle ^ and some oi the ammunition issued by us to e Hejaz Army had reached Nejd.

Any o£ these who had secured a Turkish rifle— the most popular—while campaigning in Hejaz would naturally have sold their British one. Further a certain number of men possibly only joined in order to get arms which they could sell, and without any intention of fighting. Finally, the control of distribution by the Emirs had always been admittedly ineffective. Tribal contingents, early in the war particularly, were armed almost indiscriminately on appearance as soon as they had taken the oath of allegiance. On the other hand, Colonel Wilson pointed out, King Husein’s methods of issuing arms—though open to criticism when judged by our standards—had at least promoted unity among tribes for merly at variance, and resulted in the Arab army being able to render us signal service at a critical time. KING HUSEIN AND MESOPOTAMIA. King Husein’s recent activities in regard to Mesopotamia and the neighbouring territories have given rise to difficulties in more than one direction. The following are worthy of note. Relations with local Sheikhs. The British Authorities in Baghdad have been put to incon venience by his habit of giving personal recommendations or making irresponsible promises to sheikhs within the occupied territories under their control. He is, they say, ill-informed respecting the personalities of Mesopotamia, and appears to think often that a sheikh has only to write to or visit him to merit Baghdad’s unstinted confidence. As a result he not infrequently lends his support to nonentities or undesirables ; and is sowing the seed of future trouble by exciting a number of unattainable ambitions. Feisal ibn Farham of the Shammar Jarba’, for instance, recently reached Baghdad from Mecca with superlative recom mendations from the King. As a result he was accorded excep tional consideration till it was found that he carried no weight with the Shammar Jarba’ whatsoever. By that time the really influential man, his nephew, Aziz el Tamar, had been alienated. Ali Sulaiman, chief of the Dulaim, again, was appointed by the King his chief representative with the G.O.C. Mesopotamia in July last, though his record, which is well known to Baghdad, includes the writing of a friendly letter to the German liaison officer with the Turks at the end of 1917, after his ostensible submission to us. In view of the frequency of such incidents, King Husein is to be informed that as most of his correspondents from the remoter parts of Arabia have hitherto proved to be malcontents or persons desiring financial aid, he would be well advised to confine his answers to courteous acknowledgements, with perhaps an ex pression of his interest in the welfare of their tribesmen in general.10 — The Koweit Blockade. Such incidents as these, however, are less important than his recent action in sending a telegram to the Sheikh of Koweit asking for a trade boycott of the Ateibah. The Koweit blockade is under direct British control, and Baghdad has thought it neces sary to lodge a definite protest against such interference. The Euphrates Line. More recently, there has been an actual clash between his representatives and the British Authorities on the Euphrates line. From the information at present available the exact secpience of events is not clear, but it appears to have been as follows :— On December 21, a British political officer en route for Deir el-Zar found, on arrival at Abu Kamal, that a detachment had occupied the former place in the King’s name ; and that the officer in command had sent on a representative to Abu Kamal with orders to proceed to and occupy Anah. The political officer interviewed this representative and after explaining the situation hoisted the British flag at Abu Kamal, declaring it to be within the British sphere ; he then returned to Baghdad by air, leaving British officials in charge. The King’s representative acquiesced pending the receipt of further orders from Deir el-Zor. On December 23, a large staff of Arab officials, including a Kaimmakam, reached Abu Kamal from Deir el-Zor, accompanied by some forty gendarmes. By the 27th the number of these officials had increased to no less than seventy, some of them being definitely appointed to Anah. The officer in charge at Deir el-Zor, who claimed to be acting under orders from Sherif Nasir and the political authorities at Aleppo, was formerly representative for Aleppo in the Turkish Government, while his commandant of gendarmes till recently held a command in the Turkish Army. The Kaimmakam for Abu Kamal too was originally member for Deir el-Zor at Constantinople. The commandant of gendarmes was apparently endeavour ing to raise a considerable force, both locally and from the Aleppo area. Rates of pay far in excess of those current in Mesopotamia and higher than local revenues could ever produce were being offered to recruits and officials alike. The gendarmes were a rough, insolent and inferior lot of men, their officers for the most part wearing Turkish uniforms. They had only Egyptian paper currency which they were forcing on the inhabitants. At both Abu Kamal and Deir the people were in a state of great consternation, believing the whole situation to have been engineered by the Young Turks or in their interests. They did not conceal their hostility towards the intruders. The local sheikhs forbade their tribesmen to enlist in the gendarmes, and intended, if the British officials were withdrawn, to eject them if necessary by force of arms. In advancing even to Deir el-Zor the Arab forces were acting contrary to the instructions and without the knowledge of the Commander-in-Chief, E.E.F. Orders have been issued accordingly that they are all to return immediately to Aleppo.V ,v % 1 n — 11 — NOTES. Hejaz. /f&gt;n Rashid’s Submission to King Husein. On November 27, an official deputation consisting of some fifty camel men reached Mecca from Ibn llashid. They brought a letter of submission with a gift of eight horses. In return for his acknowledgment of King Husein’s suzerainty, Ibn Rashid asked that he should receive from Mecca the subsidy which he formerly drew from the Turks; that the villages of Taima, el-Howayit, and el-Hayit should be restored to him; and that no one should have any official dealings with the Shammar tribes but himself ; and finally that the latter should be allowed to buy the necessaries of life from Meshed in Iraq. There is as yet no evidence that any formal agreement has been reached, but King Husein’s reception of the note has been friendly. He appears so far merely to have informed Ibn Rashid that he should obtain his supplies from Yen bo rather than Iraq as the latter might cause complications : and, possibly to test his sincerity, to have invited him to join the Emirs at Medina. It must be borne in mind that a month or so before he approached King Husein Ibn Rashid sent a similar deputa tion to Ibn Saud. (A.B., page 371.) He can hardly fail to know of the strained relations between them, so presumably is merely playing for safety with a view to coming in ultimately on the winning side. Colonel Wilson inclines to the view that if a general engagement takes place he will probably attack Ibn Saud from the north. King Husein’s Sentiments towards Great Britain. Abd el-Malik, the King’s Agent in Cairo, in the course of a private interview recently, urged strongly that the King’s affection for Great Britain was more real and sincere than was generally supposed. It was, in fact, precisely because he was so much in advance of his subjects in this respect that he was obliged to disguise his feelings. For it would naturally be difficult for him to persuade them that the blessing of God could ever fall on an alliance with an infidel power. An interesting example of his attitude appeared recently in connection with a speech made before him by a learned sheikh. In it the sheikh praised both him and Great Britain, with much insistence on the advantages that would accrue to the Arabs from an alliance with her. When the speech was submitted to the editor of the Qjhla for publication, the King, who censors every contribution, struck out the passage about Great Britain, while retaining that relating to himself. G.B. King Husein and the Caliphate. In the same interview, Abd el-Malik referred to the question of the Caliphate.12 — King Husein, be said, disdains to be regarded merely as a claimant amongst claimants, like the Imam of Yemen. He prefers, therefore, that any initiative in the matter should come from the Moslem world at large. In this connection it is interesting to note that, at an enthu siastic “ Baia” held recently at the Mosque of el-Omar in Jeru salem, he was hailed as Calif, the ceremony being formally ratified by the preaching of the sermon in his name. This fact is, however, not being published till his wishes have been ascertained. The Akaha Incident. In the middle of December a split occurred between the Syrian and Baghdadi elements at Akaba. The immediate cause of it was King Husein’s supercession of Abd el-Wahab, Arab mili tary governor of the town, by Kadi Abdul Rahman. Abd el-Wahab appears to have surrounded himself with Baghdadi officials, and his removal was due to the persistent report that he was indulging in extensive peculation. The change was clearly necessary, but Abdul Rahman’s methods on arrival were so tactless that he fomented rather than remedied the unrest. He at once appointed junior Syrian officers to audit Wahab’s accounts, eliminating all the Baghdadis; and by his general beha viour gave offence to Sheikh Yusef el-Khosherim, who has for some time held a rather anomalous but apparently influential position as Feisal’s civil representative. The quarrel between the Syrian and Baghdadis which ensued became serious and extended to Maan. The British Commandant become anxious lest it should affect the Indian forces, or be the signal for a general attempt to eliminate Mesopotamian officials from Syria. In answer to an enquiry he was instructed to remain neutral in his attitude, merely impressing upon Abdul Rahmant that the keeping of order was one of his primary duties. It was decided finally that the best solution would be to send representatives of both sides to state their case before Jaafar Pasha at Maan or Emir Zeid at Damascus. Accordingly Emir Zeid, on December 22, ordered Abd el-Wahab and Dr. Mah mud Hamdi, Abdul Rahman’s chief supporter, to report to him immediately. When, however, arrangements for their journey were complete, the whole situation was altered by the arrival from King Husein of Ibrahim Hakki Bey, with instructions to institute an official enquiry into Abd el-Wahab’s accounts. Zeid s orders were therefore cancelled, and the enquiry is pro ceeding on the spot. Ibrahim Hakki Bey has no connection with either party and speaks Arabic only with difficulty. The British Commandant has formed a high opinion of him, and since his arrival the whole situation has greatly improved. On December 26 he sent amessage to King Husein to the effect that his investigations were progressing and that he had already satisfied himself that Abd el-Wahab was the cause of all the trouble. Apart from the merits of the individuals concerned, King Husein’s behaviour in acting throughout without reference to anyone was unjustifiable. Akaba, according to the redivision of military spheres last spring, was definitely allotted to the Damascus Government under the Commander-in-Chief. Any such appoint ments should therefore have been referred to the latter for approval. To minimise the chance of a recurrence of such diffi culties, the Commandant’s position has been dearly_ redefined. He will in future be, amongst other things, British Liaison Officer between the Commander-in-Chief and the Arab Military Governor; and, in all matters affecting Arab Administration, will communi cate directly with the Commander-in-Chief through the Chief Political Officer. Discontent in Arab Army. Captain Garland, in a report from Yenbo dated November 26, states that the troops under Ali and Abdulla, officers and men alike, have been clamouring for demobilization. They state that they have no written contract with King Husein ; and that, if Syria and Mesopotamia are not to be under his suzerainty, as they hear, he has no further right to the services of most of them. Captain Garland, in calling attention to this unrest, adds that, it is likely to be accentuated by the cold weater, if Medina holds out, since their present clothing is quite insufficient; most of the rank and file, in fact, are wearing old patched Turkish garments and are without boots. Sherif Abdulla in a private conversation with Captain Garland on December 7, said that he was well aware of the prevalent discontent; and that when Medina fell he proposed to take with him to Khurma none of his Syrian or Mesopotamian rank and file, only his officers. Yemen. Occupation of Hodeida. On the announcement of the Armistice, General Stewart suggested that a force should be landed at Hodeida to supervise the surrender of the Turkish garrison and prevent any subse quent complications. The Turkish commander, when informed by a British man- of-war of the Clauses in the Armistice relating to him, refused to comply with them on the ground that he had received no orders from his superiors to do so. It was decided finally to give him the alternative of surrendering or evacuating the town within a fixed time. He again refused compliance, and a battalion of 101st Grenadiers was accordingly landed on December 15. The Turks opened fire upon them after disembarkation, and they had no alternative but to carry the place by assault. This they did without difficulty, losing only three wounded. The__ 14 — Turkish garrison, which at first numbered 100 but was reinforced by 200 men from Bajil, retired southwards leaving twenty-one prisoners and five guns in their hands. Two days later, in view of a reported concentration of 300 Turks and 800 Arabs nine miles east of the town (consisting apparently of the original force with reinforcements from Manakha and Bajil), General Stewart himself proceeded there with two companies of Rajputs and some more guns. On his arrival on December 20 he found the situa tion quieter and the local Arabs friendly. A Turkish officer carrying letters from the Corps Commander and the Imam came in next day, and was at first truculent in his tone, professing to disbelieve the news of the Armistice. Later however he became more amenable. I he T urkish Government has despatched an officer with written instructions to all the garrisons in Yemen and A sir, instructing them to surrender. He reached Port Said with the Medina envoys on January 3. Meanwhile Idrisi has promised his support in preventing the Turks in the Loheiya area from assisting those near Hodeida. Surrender of Lahej. Said Pasha, in spite of the orders of his Corps Commander and of a promise from the Imam to support his resistance with money, supplies and reinforcements, informed Aden on December 4 that he would surrender unconditionally if allowed a few days to make arrangements. He was as good as his word, though his garrison was ravaged by an epidemic of influenza. On December 6 an advance detachment of nearly 600 reached Aden ; and three days later he arrived himself with his staff and the rest of his force, with the exception of those incapacitated by sickness. Lahej was occupied the same day without incident. The total garrison taken comprised 174 officers, 2,481 other ranks, 159 women and children, six machine guns, twenty-four guns, and 2,550 rifles. In addition, 221 Somalis were brought m. The Turks had disarmed and disbanded their other levies before surrendering. In view of the complications that might be caused by the presence of so large a number of interned prisoners in Aden, arrangements are being made for their early evacuation. Installation of the Sultan of Lahej. Immediate preparations were made for the restoration of the Sultan. He entered officially on December 14, and a mes sage from King George, expressing appreciation of his loyalty, was read out publicly to him. He has been given £10,000 to enable him to set up his Government; and his salute has been raised from nine guns to eleven, the number accorded the Sultan ol Makalla. io enable him to make a fair start, Aden are con sulting him with a view to the prevention, if necessary, of the return ol certain of his relatives who were formerly opposed to his succession. rGeneral. Petition from Baghdad Jews. The leading Jews in Baghdad have submitted a petition to the Civil Commissioner asking that their community may be admitted en bloc to British citizenship. They point out, in effect, that the Allied principle o£ pro moting autonomy and indigenous government will, if applied to Mesopotamia, render the position of the Jews there precarious. They advance the following reasons: first, the natives are, in their opinion, utterly unprepared for political responsi bility ; secondly, any government formed in accordance with the wishes of local majorities is certain to have a theocratic character tending to intolerance of other religions ; and thirdly, the present lack of scientific institutions makes it impossible for the country to furnish the necessary minimum of trained admini strators ; while to give a free hand in a new independent state to those already tainted as subordinates in the Turkish bureau cratic regime would be calamitous. They add, in conclusion, that they are confident that they voice the opinion of their fellow Jews in Iraq also ; and that if H.M.Ct. can accord them the privilege of citizenship, Great Britain will benefit by the accretion of some 80,000 new and devoted subjects. Spread of Islam in Uganda. An Intelligence Report from Khartoum, dated December 21, gives some significant statistics in regard to the spread of Islam in Uganda. The Bagishu of Eastern Uganda, among whom Christian missions have been very active, were before the war mainly Christian or pagan, only twenty per cent being Moslem. During the war, however, another sixty per cent have gone over, with the result that Moslems, originally one quarter, now form three-quarters of the population. In the sub-district of Kigulu the official figures for 1913-14 showed a total of 18,000 ; 7,000 being Christian and the remaining 11,000 pagan. Now more than 10,000 are Moslem. The two main reasons to which these wholesale conversions are attributed are : first, the unpopularity which the Government has incurred b}^ its call for labour ; and, -secondly, the attempts of the Protestant missions to crush polygamy.SECRET.

In the last number of the Bulletin, events to January 3 were described, terminating with the desertion of Emin Bey, Fakhri Pasha’s Chief of Staff. It has since transpired that he had surreptitiously talked with Captain Zia, the Turkish envoy, in Medina, and had deter mined to force Fakhri’s hand. Amongst the officers he had circulated details of the Armistice conditions and of Fakhri’s persistent refusal to comply with them. But he was compelled to leave the city hurriedly, as spies had betrayed him to Fakhri, and the latter liad sent for him. However, he brought into Bir Derwish the entire garrison of el-Ayun, the commandant of which, Captain Arif Effendi, had actively assisted him in his propaganda. Other desertions followed, but, as it was considered that fragmentary surrenders would lead to great confusion at the Emirs’ camps and would also involve difficulties in preventing molestation of the prisoners and seizures of arms by the Bedu, Emin Bey wrote to various officers commanding Turkish posts instructing them not to march out until he sent them orders to do so. Fakhri was not slow to realize the seriousness of Emin Bey’s action, and at once took steps to counteract it. As it is perfectly clear that he had no intention of surrendering Medina, the steps he took were almost certainly designed to prevent further desertions and to gain time whilst lie got his force under control again ; and very probably he had also some idea of reducing the garrison to a number more proportionate to his rationing capacity, by allowing a surrender of his least effective troops. After Emin Bey’s departure, two proclamations were issued in Medina, which, though not bearing Fakhri’s signature, were no doubt published by his authority. In these documents it was explained that Fakhri had refused to accept the commands of the Turkish Minister of War, and that he had called for orders from the Sultan who, it was claimed, as head of the Turkish Army, was the only person competent to issue orders to surrender. The proclamations were an attempt to rally the garrison, and contained a strange admixture of abuse of Emin Bey, of confidence in the army’s ability to defend and feed itself, and of explanations why a victorious force should not surrender its arms to rebels and be evacuated as prisoners of war. It is important to remember that Fakhri Pasha did not ask for an order from the Sultan until he had exhausted all other pretexts for delay. In his first communications, sent in answer to our demands that he should surrender, he made no mention of it, and it was not until Captain Zia’s visit that the idea occurred to him. Throughout the war he has exhibited fanatical tendencies, especially in his correspondence with the Emirs and others.— 18 — The letter he sent to King Husein is a fair example. In it he described how he had been commanded in a vision to guard the Prophet’s tomb against the usurper and the slave of the infidel. Captain Zia stated that every Friday Fakhn ascended the pulpit in the Haram putting on a sacred robe of Fatma, and that the officers and men filed past kissing the garment. However, it is not yet clear whether he is genuinely fanatical or whether he merely sought throughout to use religious influence for military purposes, i.e. to maintain his control over a force which without it would certainly have become demoralized and rebellious long before the Armistice. It is at least certain that one of his prime reasons for holding out, if indeed it were not the only true one, was his pronounced objection to surrendering, except under military pressure, to rebels, especially to Arabs, whom he holds in supreme contempt. And we may rest assured that had he been . able to avoid it by joining forces with Ibn Saud, or by marching out under arms to Qasim, he would certainly have done so. It is not to be expected that he will now disclose any such plans he may have proposed to, or formulated with, Ibn Saud, as there is no doubt that his feelings towards the latter are much more friendly than those he bears for the Sherifian family whom he has at times designated as nass haramia. There is no doubt too that he was in constant communication with Ibn Saud and that he provided escorts for parties to and from Qasim. On January 5 Fakhri sent a commission of four officers to Bir Derwish to arrange evacuation details, but this move w r as almost certainly merely another subterfuge ; for he published the appointment of this commission in orders and as a result desertions at once stopped. At the first meeting the commission was told that Fakhri must surrender in person and Ali Negib Bey, the senior member and Fakhri’s second in command, was instructed to write to him saying he must appear at Bir Derwish within forty-eight hours. Fakhri had clearly no intention of appearing, for he replied that he was too busy ; and in answer to a second letter wrote that he intended to come, but was unfortunately on the sick list. The four members of the commission had clenrly a whole sale dread of Fakhri. Ali Negib Bey showed himself weak, dilatory and procrastinating, and it seemed as if he would never be induced to take a strong line of action. However, the details of evacuation were finally arranged and a clause was inserted demanding Fakhri’s personal surrender within forty-eight hours, under penalty of the termination of the negotiations and the resumption of a state of war. Ali Negib Bey was reminded that, in the event of failure, he would share the responsibility with Fakhri, and that to commit the Turkish troops to further privations might have serious con sequences for him.19 '\\AAr~rrdZ' The commission returned to Medina ; and soon after the period of grace had terminated, a telephone message was received at Bir Derwish from Ali Negib Bey saying that Fakhri had been arrested and requesting that a party be sent for him. Emir Abdullah at once left for Djlejla and there received Fakhri who arrived in a motor car with Sabri Bey, a Baghdadi officer who had been a member of the commission. Fakhri reached Bir Derwish with Emir Abdullah on January 10, two months and four days after he had received his first instructions to surrender. He was brought in as a prisoner and thus, after all, had avoided surrender to the rebels. He appeared to feel his position very keenly, and had nothing to say. The Emirs treated him with great kindness. It appears that on the commission’s return to Medina, a committee of officers was formed and Fakhri was approached with a view to persuading him to surrender, but he refused point blank and afterwards retired with a few officer sympathisers and fifty men into the Haram, saying he would prefer to die there rather than give in. A company of gendarmerie was posted round the place, and during the night every one who came out for any purpose was arrested. In this way the party was reduced to a negligible quantity and in the early morning a few of the gendarmerie made a forced entry, seized Fakhri who was lying on his bed fully dressed except for his coat, relieved him of his three revolvers, and placed him in a car which was waiting outside. In this he was taken by the O.C. Gendarmerie and Sabri Bey to Dileila. J J # * * # # Talks with the officers who deserted with Emin Bey have proved that the Turkish troops were eager to surrender and that desertions on a large scale would have occurred at a much earlier date had not they been taught systematically that the Bedu would torture them. Fakhri probably believed this himself. It is hard to believe that the Turkish envoy, Captain Zia, did not take some part in prompting Fakhri to maintain his attitude of refusal. Whilst in Medina it is true his movements were strictly supervised and he had comparatively little chance of actually promoting surrender. But there is some ground for thinking that he was actually opposed to it; and that, even if he did not leave Constantinople either with instructions, or a pre conceived intention, to assist Fakhri, he acquired a sympathy for him on his arrival in Medina, and encouraged him with appreciations of the weakness of the Arab Government and of its forces investing the city ; possibly also with secret intelligence from revolutionaries at headquarters in Turkey, both he and Fakhri being firm supporters of the C.U.P. Captain Zia led us further astray (I believe deliberately) by representing the physical and-normal - condition of the Turkish garrison as stronger than they were, and by emphatically— 20 — stating that any kind of a rebellion in Medina against Fakhri was utterly impossible owing to the power of his control. This, I think, he did with the intention of discouraging the Arabs from aggressive measures. He certainly did his utmost to dissuade me from recommending Allied military assistance for the Emirs. Notwithstanding its obvious futility, it is not at all impossible that there may have been some scheme in embryo for a resuscitation of the Turkish regime in which Fakhri’s force, Ibn Sand, and the troops in Asir and Yemen were to take part in collusion with revolutionaries in Turkey proper. H. Garland. A VISIT TO SABIA. On November 29, 1918, Captain Mohammed Fazl ud-Din, I.M.S., paid a visit at idrisi’s invitation to Sabia in the company of Seyyid Mustapha Idris and his brothers. His report contains the first detailed account of Idrisi’s capital given us by an eye witness. The author, who has been conducting a hospital at Abu Halah, had gained Idrisi’s confidence and favour by his efforts to cleanse and sanitate Midi and Jeizan, for whose indescribably dirty and unhealthy condition Idrisi excused him self on the ground of his incessant preoccupation with war. Midi, which is much the larger town, had been occupied for over a month by 3,000 to 6,000 mountaineer mercenaries, and owed its state to their filthy habits. Idrisi seems to have lent every assistance towards the scavenging of those towns and the estab lishment of incinerators, and it was probably his consciousness that his capital was in little better condition that led him to invite the doctor to visit it. Sabia suffers much and continually from fever, and the inhabitants ascribe it to the water or the air. Captain Mohammed Fazl ud-Din, however, states that the water is unusually good and sweet, and that the plague is due to the abundant breeding grounds of anopheles afforded by the place. He gives an account of the Founder of the Idrisi House which does not add much to our knowledge, beyond the fact that it was at the invitation of a disciple, the learned Seyvid Abdur Rahman Abdel Zubadi, that Seyyid Ahmed Idris stayed at Zebid for two years before settling at Sabia, where the founders of the Senussi and Morghani tankas both visited him frequently.— 21 is a mild, religious man, who keeps out of politics, and received the doctor hospitably. We quote later the account of the Idrisi’s sons. The lists given of the sons of Abdel-Al, who live at Zeinia, differs somewhat from that published in “ Arabian Personalities,” page 25, the order being, according to the new information : (1) Mohammed esh Sherif, (2) Mohammed Mansur, (3) Mohammed Senussi, (4) Mohammed Murtaza, (5) Ahmed Mustapha, (6) Mohammed Idris, (7) Mohammed Arabi, (8) Mohammed Amin, (9) Mohammed All Hasan. Idrisi seems to have laid himself out to impress Captain Mohammed Fazl ud-Din with his Islamic learning and his holiness. According to the latter he leads a very abstemious, almost ascetic life, sleeping little, eating very frugally, and dividing his days between study and affairs of state. He does not read newspapers but is avid of news and not ill informed. His local title seems to be Imam. The following passages are of sufficient interest to be printed in extenso :— The Town of Sahia. “ Sabia, the real capital of the Idrissian Kingdom, is situated at a distance of about twenty miles to the north-east of Jeizan, and is considered holy on account of being the last resting-place of Seyyid Ahmed ibn Idris, the founder of the Ahmadia Tarika, and the father of the Tarikas Senussia, Morghania, Rashidia, Majgubia, and of various other sub-Tarikas. The road lies for about ten miles in the salty ground (generally termed sabkh), while the rest of the ten miles is partly sandy and partly good arable land. About midway between Sabia and Jeizan there is a forest to the extent of about two miles thickly overgrown with green, thorny trees of the acacia order and green bushes which furnish a rich pasture ground for thousands of sheep and goats, herds of which were to be seen in various places in the forest. The underground water seems to be at about thirty feet from the surface. A large well of clear, sparkling water, of good taste, was seen in the midst of this forest near the road. Further on, the land appeared to be extremely fertile as was evident from the rich standing crops of maize and bajra, in spite of the great scarcity of rain. All land in the immediate vicinity of Sabia for about two and a half miles on the Jeizan side is under cultivation and one has to pass through a narrow road between an avenue of crops to get to Sabia. The town is situated on uneven and undulating ground. It is bounded on the north-east by plain arable land while on the south-west there is sand and wadi liable to be flooded from the north. On the east about two miles off there are two rocky hillocks in one of which green stones (emeralds) are said to be found. Grreen trees can be seen on all sides of the town as well as in it, and there is hardly any house devoid of some green plant or other. Jasmine and peppermint plants are the chief! if' I — 22 — attraction in nearly every house. It is most refreshing to look upon so ranch verdure all round after being accustomed to behold daily monotonous expanses of sabkh or sand and the utterly barren face of nature. Sabia is a fairly large town about the size of Midi and appears to contain more than a thousand houses, about 150 of which are stone built, while the others are the usual dome-shaped straw huts which are met with everywhere in the Tihama. T1 le chief stone buildings are :— (1) The house and the court of the Idrisi. (2) The houses of Sheikhs Mohammed Yahya Basahi and Yahya Zahri. (3) The mosques—especially that of Seyyid Ahmed ibn - Idris. (4) The fort. Unlike Midi, Loheiya, and even Jeizan, the mosques of Sabia are in a very good condition and well looked after. The fort is an old stone building on the north-east corner of the town. I have seen this only from the outside. On reaching Sabia we drove past the house of the Idrisi without stopping and first arrived at the graveyard of the town on the north end of it, because Seyyid Mustapha’s brothers desired first of all to offer their prayers at the tomb of their grandfather, Seyyid Ahmed, and then enter the house. It is a big graveyard, but very poorly kept. One is astonished to find the extremely simple and modest little room in which lies the grave of the saint who is universally and deeply respected over a great portion of the Islamic world, e.g. Egypt, Somaliland, Sudan, North Africa and Arabia. The absence of any imposing structure on the tomb of this wonderful man is said to be due to his strict injunctions on his death-bed that his grave was not to be decorated or made a place of worship. All other graves also, e.g. those of the father and grandfather of the Idrisi, are devoid of any monument or embellishments. Numerous people have requested at various periods to be allowed to erect domed buildings on these exposed graves, but they have always been refused the privilege. It is said that a disciple of Seyyid Ahmed ibn Idris once came from Mecca and brought masons and car penters with him and requested the father of the present Idrisi to allow him to erect a mausoleum on the great saint’s tomb, but his request was refused just in the same manner as that of others before him. He insisted, however, and the Seyyid ordered him to be killed, if he did anything of the sort. The poor fellow had to fly back to Mecca for his life. This incident was related also. The present Idrisi is as inexorable in this respect as his predecessors.The Idrisis House. The Idrisi’s house is a two storeyed building. The lower storey consists of two frontal halls situated at right angles to each other and each having a spacious verandah in front. There is. a small compound in front of these verandahs half of which is taken up by a little garden consisting of two palms, one pome granate, one jasmine and one other tree probably of the eucalyptus variety. This latter is, however, a foreign tree imported from Egypt. There is a large and spacious courtyard on the south of these rooms. All floors are paved and lime-plastered and kept scrupulously clean. On the back of the above-mentioned rooms is the harem of the Idrisi ; I do not know the disposition of the rooms there. The upper storey consists of a hall as mentioned above, generally used as a reception hall, and a storeroom with three verandahs. The whole building is thoroughly ventilated. The upper storey is used only when there are guests in the house. The house usually occupied by the Idrisi is on the north of this main building and was on this occasion assigned to us—myself and Seyyid Mustafa’s brothers. This house consists of two rooms in front of each other having a compound in between. The whole is enclosed by a wall of its own. This building is not paved with stones, but is only mud-plastered, and cleanly kept. One of these rooms, the bigger of the two, is used by the Idrisi as his study and here also he sits and prays all day whenever he is in Sabi a. It is decorated with china cups and plates, glass tumblers, bottles and. teapots, etc., neatly though not sym metrically arranged above each other in the niches in the frontal wall. The walls are overhung with coloured tin plates, which is the usual decoration met with in every Arabian house of any pretentions in this part of the country. Large boxes containing books placed on charpoys were arranged on one side of the room, while the other side had charpoys covered with Persian carpets. The other room was a sort of storeroom. The Idrisi’s Wives and Children. The Idrisi has at present four wives; two Sudanese, one Arab from Sabia, and one slave wife—Abyssinian. He has six children—six sons and one daughter. The eldest child, named Ali, is about thirteen years old. His mother is Sudanese. He is a boy with a broad face, prominent forehead, dark, gentle eyes, scarred cheeks after the fashion of Sudanese, very shy and of a much fairer complexion than his father. His features, expres sion and constitution are more like his maternal uncles whom I have seen at Jeizan and Sabia than his father. He has learnt the whole of the Koran by heart and is now studying the com mentaries, Hadith and Grammer. He is an intelligent lad, but of a frailer constitution than his father. The second child, Abdul Wahhab, is from an Arab wife of Indian extraction who died two years back. (Seyyid Idrisi’s mother was also of Indian extraction ; his father married her— 24 — I ! ! ®i ; ii while at Mecca.) This boy is about four years old aud is the true sou of his father. He is a strong, stout boy with bold, prominent and deeply observant eyes, thoughtful expression of the face, high forehead and dignified and decorous bearing.. His complexion is slightly darker than his elder brother, but fairer than his father. The third child, Abdul Aziz, is from the slave wife and is nearly of the same age as the second son. His features and com plexion are something like his father’s, but he is a child of frivolous character and inferior to his half brothers. The two younger sons, Abdur Rahman and Ahmad, are still very young and I have not seen them. The daughter is about a year old and has quite a fair complexion. Her mother is one of the Sudanese wives of Egyptian extraction.” EFFECTS OF THE ARMISTICE IN SOUTH WEST ARABIA. • • ■ - . i.v.j :: .•. ■: i: . : i The extent of the collapse of Turkey seems now to have been grasped throughout South-West Arabia ; and the realization that the garrisons are in consequence likely to disappear soon from the scene has given rise, as might have been expected, to a regular vortex of intrigue. But the evidence which is coming to hand is so varied and often so untrustworthy that it is impos sible to predict yet the balance of power which will succeed that of the Turks. The parts round which such intrigues naturally centre— excluding Khurma—-are those on the South Hejaz, Asir and Yemen border, in particular those which have been in the vicin ity and under the direct influence of the Turkish garrisons, e.g. Ebha and Muhail. The evacuation of the Turks raises two questions in almost every case, the disposal of their arms and material, and the filling of the gaps which will be created by their departure. King liusein. In this connection King Husein has, broadly speaking, played a passive role. He has been preoccupied with Medina and Khurma ; and in any event it is his nature tacitly to assume his possession of anything that he desires. It is natural, however, that many border sheikhs hitherto independent of or antagonistic to the Idrisi and the Imam should turn to him for support. The Idrisi’s military incompetence has evoked general comment; .while the Imam has only too clearly backed the wrong horse. Both too are paupers by comparison. The King, in consequence, has received numerous offers of allegiance. Most of them are addres sed to him as King of the Arabs, and he appears to have accepted them without surprise as his ordinary due. In one case he has ! .f»gone further and has taken what would appear to be an impolitic step. Amongst the letters which he received was one from Hasan ibn Ali ibn Aidh, paramount chief of the Beni Mugheid, who occupy the district round Ebha. Hasan ibn Ali was first with the Idrisi, but seceded to the Turks in 1910, under the influence of bribes from King Husein. The Turks made him Vali of Asir which in practice meant ruler only of those tribes who recognized Turkish authority. In his letter to the King he claimed that the Turks in Ebha had surrendered and handed over their ammunition to him. Even if true, this implies little, for he and the Beni Mugheid have always lived on friendly relations with the Turks, who were never besieged in Ebha. In answer King Husein has appointed him Emir of Asir. Precisely what autho rity he- means this rank to entail is not immediately clear. But by his action he definitely arrogates to himself the right to nomi nate officials to replace the Turks in disputed territories. On the basis of self-determination, the Beni Mugheid should at the present moment probably fall within the King’s sphere. But the Idrisi is hardly likely to view the establishment of such a precedent with equanimity. Apart, too, from the question of principle the latter is reported to be sending an emissary of his own to Ebha. The dangers inherent in the situation there were outlined in a previous issue. Hasan ibn Ali, in offering King Husein the allegiance of the A1 lazid section of the Beni Mugheid, who, he says, would accept no other overlord, adds that the Qahtan (i'.e. the settled tribe of that name in Asir as distinct from their nomadic cousins further north, who are mainly Wahhabis and are under Ibil Sand) and the districts of el-Hajah and Dhoran (which form two kazas in the Yemen) have agreed to recognize the King as “ Sultan of the Arabs and Imam of the Moslems.” Amongst other notables who have written to him are Suleiman ibn Ali, apparently chief of the Musa who own Muhail. He, like Hasan ibn Ali, threw in his lot with the Turks against Idrisi, so might naturally be expected to turn to Mecca now.* Said ibn Faiz, chief of the Beni Shihir, and his son Faraj ibn Said, ex-Kaimakam of Muhail, have also written to the King. Their attitude, too, is logical. Said ibn Faiz is head of a family closely related to King Husein, and was one of the Hejaz representatives in the Ottoman Parliament. The Beni Shihir in general have shown little sympathy with the Idrisi. In addition to these, a deputation from the Hashid and Bakil tribes reached Mecca in the middle of December, bearing a letter, signed by four members of the Shaif family. The question of these tribes was dealt with in a recent issue. Their position is a most unsatisfactory one from their own point of view. Having seceded from the Imam about 1912, their subsidy, paid * In fact, however, he appears to he merely playing for safety, for Captain Clayton, in a recent report, states categorically that he offered his submission to the Idrisi at the end of December.them by the Turks on the Imam’s behalf, gradually dwindled and finally ceased ; in this war they fought as mercenaries for the Idrisi, who had long played for their support ; but they proved a failure and their relations with him became gradually less cordial. In November last they wrote to Aden in an attempt to gain independence by discrediting the Imam. They received little encouragement, so are apparently turning to King Husein in the last resort. Events have proved conclusively that their 12,000 fighting men are, for what they are worth, at the disposal of the highest bidder. Lastly, at the end of November, a deputation of three Yemeni Sherifs from Jauf—some eighty miles north-east of Sanaa—arrived in Mecca representing, they stated, seventy notables of the locality, to ask for King Husein’s assistance. The cause of their appeal is uncertain, but an agent states that the Imam tried to tax any of them who enlisted in the Idrisi’s forces ; and that, as they refused to pay, they had to flee to escape punishment. Idrisi. The Idrisi, on the other hand, seems to have been active in his propaganda. Though he has ended on the winning side, his prestige, as he must be well aware, has not been enhanced by the war, and as regards material power he has suffered by comparison with King Husein. At the same time, being unusually well- informed, he probably realizes that at the Peace Congress his claim to rule a tribe will rest rather on its good will than on any show of force, and that by successful propaganda in the interim he may be able to make up a lot of lost ground. It seems fairly certain, despite Seyyid Mustapha’s partial denial, that Idrisian agents have been busy amongst the Zahran and Grhamid who inhabit the territory lying some seventy miles north-east of Kunfida. In a message summoning their sheikhs to come to him, he states that he has made peace with the Sultan of Turkey. Colonel Wilson construes this as a clever move to impress the tribesmen by making them think that he was actually one of the signatories to the Armistice. King Husein is much incensed at the incident, for the Zahran and Ghamid border Hejaz on the south. Their definite secession to the Idrisi would produce a w T edge between him and the friendly tribes of Ebha and Muhail. They have, however, been in sympathy with the Idrisi for many years, and the former fought with him in his revolt of 1912. In 1915, too, sheikhs of both wrote offering him assistance, but he advised them to remain quiet. He has been in correspondence with them ever since. In addition to the above, he is reported to have written to tribal ^ sheikhs in the neighbourhood of Ebha and Muhail, e.g. Said ibn Faiz, a venture which, in view of their pro-Meccan tendencies described above, does not promise much success.27 — '303 It is reported finally by Captain Clayton that all the sheikhs of the Beni Abs, and Waazat and most of those of the Zaalia, Beni Suleil, and Jebel Melhan district have recently offered their submission to him. The Imam of Yemen. The Imam’s doings, by force of circumstance, are less clear. It is believed on good authority that he has been conspiring with some of the Turkish officials, notably Mahmud Nedim, Turkish Governor of the Yemen, and to some extent Tewfik Ali Pasha, the Commander-in-Chief, to form an independent Arab Kingdom. Mahmud Kedrin has been in the Yemen for twenty years. Tewfik Pasha is a Syrian from Aleppo. Of the staff officers, several come from Syria and Baghdad, among the latter being Sayid Taha Bey, Chief of the General Staff, a brother of Yasin Pasha, Arab Military Governor of Damascus. It has been suggested that Yasin Pasha should write to him inviting him and others of the officers to visit Damascus, since it appears that British policy is regarded in the Yemen at present as incompatible with Arab interests. The Aden authorities, while agreeing to the suggestion in principle, are of the opinion that such an invitation should be deferred at least till after all the Turkish garrisons who intend to surrender have done so, and till the intention^ of the Imam have been more clearly defined. On January 12 four envoys from him reached Aden via Hodeida. It soon became clear, however, that their object was to promote dissension rather than agreement. They went privately to the French consul and presented him with a petition from the Imam to M. Poincare. In it the Imam protested against the British occupation of Hodeida, and asked to be sum moned to the Peace Congress. The French consul passed on the letter to General Stewart. There was good reason to think that the envoys were trying also to send messages through Jibuti and elsewhere. General Stewart, on finding that they were abusing their privileges, sent them back to Hodeida without granting them an interview, at the same time pointing out to the Imam his reasons for doing so. The whole incident is, in Colonel Jacob’s opinion, most unfortunate, as the Imam is in a difficult mood, and it will, he thinks, make a rapprochment with him impossible for the present. It has, however, been pointed out that, when once such an incident has happened, a certain asperity becomes necessary. And it must not be forgotten that the Imam has throughout helped the Turks, and is fortunate in being regarded as nothing worse than a neutral. Finally, whatever his present feelings, he will doubtless be amenable ultimately to any one who is in a position to subsidise him.28 — A TURKISH OFFICER’S VIEWS ON THE ARABIAN SITUATION. Captain Zia, the first Turkish envoy to Medina, was inter viewed on his return through Egypt recently. He is an Albanian from the neighbourhood of Durazzo who has seen much service as an officer in the Turkish Army, and has recently, as secretary to the chief of the General Staff in Constantinople, been in touch with the leading personalities in the Government. He talked with great candour on a variety of topics and, for the most part, expressed very decided opinions. The following notes are the embodiment of his views’ on one or two points of general interest in the Arabian situation. King Husein. He did not attempt to conceal Ins contempt for King Husein, whom he regards as an incompetent old barbarian. Though he did not, he said, know the extent of our commitments to him, he concluded that they involved the support at least of his temporal aspirations. Any attempt to fulfil these would, in his opinion, be a classic blunder. King Husein was totally unfited to sustain the role which they would involve. He was, for example, too primitive to control any part of Syria; witness his ruthless application of effete Koranic punishments, such as the cutting off of hands and feet for minor offences ; by such actions alone he had already gone far to alienate all intelligent Moslem opinion outside Hejaz. Further he was neither a natural leader nor a competent organizer ; so that we should, in supporting him, be bolstering up a weakling, a policy always foredoomed to failure in Arabia. The Pilgrimage. In connection with the future of Hejaz, the point about which the Moslem world at large felt most anxious, he said, was the security of the Haj. King Husein was incapable of control ling the Bedu, as this war alone had amply demonstrated. For merly the safety of the pilgrims was guaranteed by the proximity of Turkish troops. Since the war it had been temporarily ensured by British gold, which gave the King exceptional powers and diverted the attention of the Bedu elsewhere. If our subsidy were to cease on the conclusion of peace, Moslems in general would probably consider the Pilgrimage too hazardous a venture to embark upon. This would produce an impasse, the gravity of which, from an international point of view, hardly needed to be emphasized. Incidentally, chaos would result in Hejaz, which, having no natural resources, had always lived a few weeks ahead of starvation, largely on the Pilgrimage proceeds. The Galiphate. King Husein’s reticence on this subject had, he said, given the 1 urkish Government much cause for wonder. They had expected him to assume the title at the first opportunity, though they would, of course, never consider his claim for an instant.Relative Military Value of Arabs. Captain Zia made some very positive statements in regard to the military value of the various Arab tribes. By far the finest fighting material, he said was to be found in the Western Desert. The present Senussi’s men, if properly supplied and trained, would be a first class fighting force. In Arabia proper, the Yemenis were easily better than the rest. The Hejazis, Nejdis and Asiris were all of little or no value ; though, if he had to choose, he would prefer the Wahhabi Nejdis, whose fanaticism made them temporarily at least, more formidable than the rest. When questioned as to the soundness of these views he asserted that he was voicing not his own opinions but those of the competent military authorities in Constantinople, who had had long experience and were unanimous on the subject. NOTES. Hejaz. Government Contracts. The Jeddah agent of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. wrote to Colonel Wilson in the middle of December in connection with their contracts with the Arab Government. They are a firm with long experience of Arabia, and are in a position to undertake contracts of almost any kind and magnitude. The agent pointed out, however, that there were no courts of law in the Hejaz. Formerly his power to refer claims to the British Embassy in Constantinople usually enabled him to compel the Turkish authorities to meet their liabilities. But over the Arab Government he had no such hold, and he had found that in practically every transaction they had either failed to maintain the terms agreed upon then or endeavoured to release themselves from their engagement. Consequently no contract with them involving a large credit was a business proposition, and he could not recommend his firm to undertake any without the official support of the British authorities. Colonel Wilson, in forwarding this report, confirmed its accuracy and testified to the accommodating attitude taken up by the agent. He stated further that the fact that the Company had hitherto generally avoided financial loss had been due chiefly to unofficial pressure exerted periodically by himself and his colleagues. He observed, finally, that the lively fear of King Husein which existed among the Arabs would probably make it useless to set up a mixed tribunal to try appeals against his decisions, which at present constitute the sole court of appeal. Sir R. Wingate has therefore proposed that for the future the British Agent at Jeddah should initial such contracts as he approves between the Hejaz Government and British firms and, in the event of the former refusing to meet its obligations, bring official pressure to bear to enforce payment.30 Indian Troops 1 Visit to Mecca. In January, 1918, King George expressed a desire that any Indian Moslems serving in the war should be given facilities for a visit to Mecca on their return journey to India. King Husein was much pleased with the suggestion, which is now being carried out. A party of some forty-six officers and 1,200 other ranks left Suez for Jeddah on January 24. The War Office decided in the first instance to limit the number to seventy officers and 2,000 other ranks. They have been approached, however, with a request that the second party which is due to start on February 12 should be approximately as large as the first-'— making a total of ninety-six officers and 2,400 other ranks. Arms have been or will be left in Egypt. Each party will be given a full three weeks on shore—allowing a fortnight at Mecca. King Husein has insisted that they shall be his guests, however long their visit may be. The' Akaba Incident. The enquiry into the charges against Abd el-Wahab, late Arab military governor of Akaba, is now drawing to a close. Ibrahim Hakki Bey has established Ids guilt conclusively, and has reported to Mecca that he has stolen some £65,000, £15,000 of it from cash funds, the rest from ordnance ammunition and supplies. With regard to the King’s action in appointing Abd el- Rahman as his successor without reference to Damascus, Colonel Wilson is to remind him that Akaba is under the British Com- mander-in-Chief according to the military arrangements at present in force ; that these are only temporary ; that it is impossible to separate civil from, military administration there so as to admit of dual control ; and that therefore any such appointments should only be made with the Commander-in-Chief’s approval through Feisal at Damascus. Colonel Wilson thinks that it may be difficult to explain this to the King without offending him. Customs officials and certain others have always been appointed hitherto by Mecca ; and, in regard to Akaba, he does not seem ever to have grasped the situation, for he has, Colonel Wilson believes, made all civil appointments there since August, 1917. Khurma. Owing partly to the arrival of a mass of new material which could not have been properly incorporated in the time available before going to press, and partly to lack of space in the present issue, it has seemed advisable to postpone the article on Khurma. The situation there is, broadly speaking, still unchanged.— 31 — Syria. Jerusalem and the Caliphate. The account of the proclamation of King Huseiri as Caliph in the Mosque of Omarat Jerusalem, given in our last issue (p. 12), though derived from a source which afforded good ground for credence, turns out to be mere propaganda, bearing little resem blance to the truth. The facts as they actually occurred are given in the following extract from a report of the Chief Administrator of O.E.i.A., Sguth :— “ Towards the beginning of December rumours began to prevail to the effect that the Moslem authorities proposed acknowledging the King of the Hejaz as Caliph on the occasion of the Friday prayers at the Mosque of Omar ; also that they intended adding to the Caliphial title that of Sultan of the Arabs. 1 sent for the Grand Mufti and Mayor, who had heard of the project but were strongly against it being carried into execution. They agreed that it was highly unbecoming for one small section of Islam to embark upon an announcement affecting the entire Moslem world, and promised that the official preacher should maintain the status quo arranged upon F.E.F. Occupation, namely the offering of prayers for the Caliph without naming him. I subsequently found that three members of the young and extremist Arab party, Isaf al-Nashashibi, Hassan al-Daudi, and Mohammed Yusuf al-Dejani, had excited the population to believe that a manifestation would take place, and that at the conclusion of the service Hassan Sidki called upon all, on pain of being considered “Kafirs” (unbelievers) to acknowledge the supremacy of the King of the Hejaz. Two or three accomplices raised some semblance of applause, but the incident passed off without evoking much general comment. At the same time, aware that in Islam it is difficult to separate religion and politics, also that none of these young men possessed any sort of Islamic mandate, I summoned them to these headquarters, and while reminding them that the Military Government had no concern with religious questions, pointed out that they were exposing not only themselves but possibly their seniors and the whole Moslem Community of Jerusalem to the anger and derision of the greater part of the Islamic world, which had up to that moment arrived at no sort of decision upon this all important point, nor indeed given any sign of desiring any change; that the Military Government recognized the Grand Mufti and him alone as the mouthpiece of Moslem Jerusalem ; and said 1 would not tolerate the repetition of such an incident. They promised that it should not be repeated, and I understand that the leader, Hassan Sidki, who had before been in communi cation with the Emir Feisal, has since left for Amman, where it would be highly desirable that he should remain.”~ T ' ‘ — 32 — Yemen. Beni Mukatil. It appears that the Beni Mukatil recently came to an understanding with the Imam, and facilitated his occupation of the Harraz district. Their principal sheikh is Nashir Pasha. They are a Shiah tribe of the Daudiyah sect, numbering some 2,500 fighting men. In 1911 during the siege of Menakhah they fought against the Imam. (See “ Yemen Handbook,” p. 77.) Sheikh Mohammed Nasir Mukbil. This powerful Mawiya sheikh (see pp. 18, 122, 233 of 1918 ^ ol.) appears to have supported the Turks to the last. Towards the end of October he assisted them in an attack made on the Emir of Dala for his refusal to pay taxes. The Turks are reported to have given him twelve guns and 100 camel loads of ammunition, presumably for this and similar objects. Since the Armistice, however, he has made overtures to Aden, and at the end of December was invited to come to Lahej for an interview with Colonel Jacob. Fhe Fadli Sulta?i. The Fadli Sultan, Husein ibn Ahmed, has been to Aden in an endeavour to renew friendly relations. He is now very old and feeble and almost totally blind. He expressed his willingness to nominate his grandson Abdul Kader as his successor, but asked for British assistance in inducing him to accept the title. W hen his attention was called to the behaviour of his son, Abdullah ibn Husein, who had been raiding caravans passing through his territory and levying unjustifiable taxes, he promised to do all he could to stop him. The Haushabi Sultan. ' Ali ibn Mani the Haushabi Sultan has also made overtures t° Aden and come to Lahej at the end of December to interview Colonel Jacob there. Correction. The former Ottoman allowance to the Emirs of Mecca, stated in our No. 108, p. 2, last line but one, at L.T. 12,000 per mensem. should have been L.T. 12,000, per annum. %SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN.

The present issue is devoted to the fall of Medina and its sequel in so far as this has not been covered in the Bulletin previously. ^ The information has been derived from captured documents, interrogation of prisoners and the reports of British officei s attached to the Hejaz forces. If anything further of in terest transpires it will be duly recorded in subsequent numbers. The Evacuation. Fakhri Pasha. The account in the last issue closed with Fakhri’s arrival under arrest at Bir Derwish on January 10 (p. 19). The Emirs gave him excellent tent accommodation there and he was attended by his orderlies and a doctor from the garrison. Colonel Bassett reached Bir Derwish on January 13 with Haidar Bey and Miialai Ahmed Bey Lufti, the envoys. I he latter were intro duced to I akhri without delay and in a formal interview handed to him the Sultan’s letter ordering him to surrender Medina to the Emir of Mecca, and explaining the disputed Clause (No. 16) m the Armistice conditions. The other letter appointing Ahmed Bey Lufti to succeed him was not given him, in view of the fact that Ali Negib Bey had already taken over command. Fakhri at this interview was proud and reserved and answered the questions put to him in monosyllables. But, after he had talked to the envoys alone, he appeared much relieved, and became friendly and communicative. He was, however, suffering much from a cough caused by influenza’and from insomnia consequent on arthritis. He reached Suez with his doctor and orderlies on January 28 and has been installed in apartments in the Kasr el Nil Barracks, Cairo. Remainder of the Garrison. The evacuation of the rest of the garrison was carried out successfully, and for the most part in accordance with a scheme agreed upon previously in a meeting between Ali, Captain Carl and and the Turkish delegation under Ali Neolb Bey at Bir Derwish on January 5 (p. 18). ° J The site foi the concentration camp had been fixed in November as Geria (called also Mubarak or Yenbo al Nakhl) ten hours journey up the wadi from Yenbo al Bahr, and the route decided upon was via El Jafr, the Bowat Pass, and Ras al Beer with halts at each. The Emirs had agreed that all troops should be transported by camel, senioi officers having two, junior officers one, and the lank and file sharing one between two men. The price chargedby the Bedu camelmen for the journey from Medina to Yenbo was £2 per camel. The owners, mainly picked sheikhs and Bedu of the Harb and Juheina tribes, accompanied the columns and acted as escorts. At first it had been thought simpler that the railway gar risons, as distinct from that of Medina, should be transported from Hediyah or Bueir direct, hut finally all were concentrated in Medina, and, after dumping their arms, were evacuated from there in eight batches of about 1,000 each, as camels appeared, at irregular intervals between January 10 and February 1,3. A Turkish commandant was appointed to each column and given a sum of money, about £100, as a contingency fund for the journey. Each column took rations—accounts vary as to the amount—and the medical personnel and stores were divided as evenly as possible. The journey from Medina to Geria took, on an average, four and a half days. The first two columns, owing to the discontent and suspicion existing among the Bedu resulting in shortage of camels, moved slowly. After the departure of the second column there was an ugly pause, and it seemed probable that the first lot of camels collected would have to be responsible for the whole evacuation, i.e. taking one batch of prisoners down, returning with supplies from Yenbo, and then repeating the process. An unpromising situation, however, was transformed by the arrival of £15,000 in gold from King Husein, sent on urgent representations from Captain Goldie, it was distributed by the Emirs and the effect was instantaneous. The Camels required were immediately forthcoming and, with the exception of a few trivial incidents inevitable in any plan of such magnitude, the evacuation moved without a hitch according to plan. Geria, a partially abandoned village in the wadi, with an excellent water supply and its buildings in ver^ fair repair, proved as good a camp as had been anticipated. The columns came in intermittently but in safety, and were segregated on arrival for quarantine purposes. They were conveyed from Geria to Yenbo as sea transport became available, and have since been scattered amongst the various camps in Egypt. Their embark ation was complicated by the sudden appearance of bubonic plague amongst the civilian population of Yenbo, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the medical staff, and to the help ^iven by the Kaimmakam, the infection did not reach them. Such sickness as there was was dealt with successfully in an improvised hospital of 180 beds. Statistics of the Garrison. It is very difficult to arrive at exact figures in regard to the garrison which surrendered, owing to the laxity of the Arab methods of counting. This was supposed to be carried out bythe Bagdadi officers, but they, of their own accord, ordered luikish officers to do it. The latter state that their task was a matter of great difficulty ; often, for example, at the moment of departure, when they had made up the hamlas, the Bedu would refuse to start unless the numbers were reduced on the ground that this camel was overloaded, that one ill, and so on These changes were effected without reference to the Turkish officers responsible, so that the latter were unable to correct their totals and in consequence returns in some cases were probably duplicated! Further, the Bagdadi officer in charge of the concentration camp at (xena, Muheddin _ Effendi, never checked the numbers on arrival, merely accepting the Turkish lists as they came in with each hamla. The disparity is, however, comparatively slight and round figures can be given with reasonable safety. According to Ali Negib Bey, the whole Hejaz Expeditionary force, occupying positions from Tebuk to Medina, totalled in November some 550 officers, and rather less than 11,000 men with 53 officials. Of these, 491 officers, 7,545 men and all the civilians have been evacuated to Egypt. The remainder have been accounted for as follows : Spanish influenza and other illnessses exacted a heavy toll, over 850 dying of the former in December alone and nearly 200 more in January prior to the evacuation Another 100 succumbed while en route for the coast, while 300 have remained in hospital in Medina. Of the rest, some 430 i.e. an Arab railway battalion, numbering over 300, and the personnel of the water company, about 130, were left behind in Medina by arrangement. Over 1,000, again, of whom more than three- quarters were Syrians and Bagdadis, voluntarily elected to remain ni Medina oi the vicinity, and work in with the new regime Finally, some-50 Ageyl, being by heredity guides and earners of no particular allegiance, went their various ways. Treatment of Turks by Arabs. At the moment of the occupation of Medina the problem of the safe transport of the Turks to the coast presented certain features which afforded good ground for anxiety. The chief was the attitude of the Harb and, to a lesser degree the Juheina. The former, notoriously among the most savage ol the Bedu, m part commanded the routes ; and were in a restless state owing to the fact that they were for the most part nine months in arrears of pay. It was feared that they might paralyse the evacuation scheme by withholding camels inter cepting supplies or even actively obstructing the unarmed Turkish columns en route. At the start, indeed, Ali could collect only 400 camels in six days at Yenbo, while, to make matters worse, the Harb had just previously intercepted a supply column on its way to him at Bir Derwish, so that he was without fresh supplies for several weeks. The first batch of prisonerswho surrendered with Emin Bey were in fact kept alive only by a reserve stock which Nuri Bey, the officer in command of Ali’s regular force, chanced to have. Further, several incidents which happened just prior to the evacuation tended to increase the uneasiness. On November 10 a party of Arabs under Ferhan el Aida carried the Turkish post at Wayban Station by assault, taking some 150 prisoners, wrecking a train and capturing some 100 tons of grain, mainly rice. There is no doubt that the attack was made in ignorance of the signing of the Armistice, for Turkish officers captured at the time told Captain Garland that Ferhan el Aida got the news of it by letter from Abdulla immediately after the engagement. Captain Garland, on learning of it, immediately wrote a letter to Fakhri at Abdulla’s request, explaining the matter. But the incident cannot but have promoted the existing mistrust. Secondly, on November 25, a Turkish patrol opened fire with machine guns on some Bedu near Bowat. Thirdly, on Emin Bey’s defection, isolated parties of Turks who surrendered haphazard to Bedu were treated with scant ceremony. Dr. Shevket, in his diary, says that those from Jlejla, officers and men alike, were stripped of everything but their shirts and drawers, while Captain Garland reports that all the first batch which reached Bir Derwish on January 4 had been robbed of their coats and blankets, and adds that in one case the Bedu took one hundred Turks to their tents and deprived them of practically everything they had, trying even to extract an officer’s gold teeth. Events, however, proved that the prevalent anxiety was exaggerated. The various British officers concerned repeatedly urged the importance of according the garrison proper treatment, and as a result the Emirs made exceptional efforts to ensure it and were proportionately successful. In addition to the distri bution of the £15,000 received from King Husein, they took several prompt and effective measures. In connection with the robbery at Jlejla, for instance, they immediately issued a plain warning to the Turks that they must not allow unauthorised parties of Bedu to approach them. In regard to the incident quoted by Captain Garland, Abdulla immediately imprisoned five Harb sheikhs, pending the return of the stolen property. Ali, when reference was made to him, decided, for better or worse, that they should be released, but gave the prisoners monetary compensation. The personal courtesy shown by the Emirs to various Turks on different occasions elicited more than one expression of gratitude. When Dr. Shevket was sent from Medina to tend Fakhri at Bir Derwish, Abdulla, on hearing that he could not ride a camel, sent him his own mule, an action which the doctor describes as that of a true gentleman. Later he adds a note that Ali was even gentler and kinder than his brother. Emin Bey, in his pro clamation, called attention to the measures taken gratuitously bythe Emirs to provide camel transport, medicines and other comforts, while Colonel Bassett found that for the most part the Arab officials in charge of the camps at Geria under Sherif Abd el Kerim took a keen and intelligent interest in the welfare of their prisoners,* who looked remarkably contented and well. Any shortcomings in sanitary arrangements and the like were due, he found, to the slackness of the prisoners themselves, who knew that the camp was only a place of call. The Arabs, in fact, were, if anything, inclined to be too considerate. A Turkish doctor, who had been ordered to stay in Geria to attend to the next column on its arrival, was found leaving with all his outfit for the sole reason that he had expressed himself unwilling to stay. All the prisoners at Geria were allowed to sell their private property and buy from Bedu. They had a fair amount of money and a brisk trade was done. The men sold their blankets and many odds and ends, while the officers bartered away horses —such as they were—field glasses, cameras and the like. Summary. When the difficulties which confronted everyone concerned are carefully considered, is must be conceded that the successful evacuation of the whole garrison was a remarkable achievement. Abdulla’s and All’s regular armies totalled 250 and 3,000 men respectively, and were a miscellaneous lot at that, comprised as they were of Syrians, Bagdadis, Yemenis, Somalis, deserters, and volunteers from prisoners of war. The Hejaz Expeditionary Force opposed to them numbered nearly 11,000. And between Medina and the sea lay the Harb and Juheina. The failure to pay these tribes and their consequent restlessness may rest on the Emirs’ shoulders, but there is considerable force in the latters’ contention that Fakhri’s policy of deliberate delay threw their plans out of gear. With regard, further, to the thefts of boots and underclothing, it must be borne in mind that there were no supplies available nearer than Yenbo ; while the transport of the stock from there to any point beyond Geria was not, in Captain Garland’s opinion, a safe or practical propo sition. In consequence such clothes as the prisoners had constituted a particularly strong temptation to the Bedu ; yet of 5,000 suits sent from Egypt to Yenbo only 1000 were needed. The £15,000 from King Husein eased the situation. But, even so, the fact that not one case of murder or of real violence has been sub stantiated, is one which redounds greatly to the Emirs’ credit. A solitary rumour reached Yenbo to the effect that five stragglers in one column had been found stripped and with their throats cut, but every effort to confirm this has failed, and interrogated prisoners regard the tale as intrinsically improbable. * Captain Goldie cites Muheddin, Abd el Kerim’s Baghdadi assistant, as an exception, for he found him both lazy and dishonest.— 38 Finally, the forbearance of the Emirs in spite of the irritation which Fakhri had caused them by his repeated delay and by the frank contempt in which he and his staff held them, is perhaps worthy of note. Dr. Shevket’s diary is full of sarcastic allusions, such as “ Cursed be the traitor Husein, an Englishman under a Moslem mask,” while his feelings on the occupation for example, are given in two humorous entries: “ At 10 a.m. on 13th January Arabian officers stood at the station holding a flag marked ‘Long live the King’s Government’ till, at 10.30, the Emir Abdulla arrived. The superfluous enthusiasm of some of them pained us.” The next day he describes as “full of more laughter and unnecessary enthusiasm on the part of the Arabs, which grieved us greatly.” Generally speaking, the Turks seem surprised at having- reached the coast in complete safety and ascribe it to the presence of British representatives rather than to any natural sense of duty on the part of the Emirs. The Siege. The Spirits of the Garrison. From Dr Shevket’s diary one can trace a gradual decline in the spirits of the garrison. In February, 1918, he wrote that Medina was getting on his nerves, he found no one to talk to, and there was no place for recreation of any kind. In July the one topic of conversation, he said, was the quantity of the supplies available, and the uncertainty of the future. In the middle of September, he noted that not even the opening of Bairam had alleviated the prevalent despondency. And from that date onwards his diary records a steady increase in the general ner vousness. Sabotage. There appear to have been spasmodic outbreaks of hooli ganism. On May 2, 1918, Dr. Shevket records that a twelve- year-old child had beem-killed ; and he states that owing to shortage of the necessaries of life murders were of almost daily occurrence. In an entry a short time later he returns to the subject in connection Avith the murder and robbery of a soldier coming from the Kuba Mosque. “ There must,” he said, “ be a gang of brigands in the city. Orders have been given that no one is to go out at night except in circumstances of absolute necessity.” Sickness. Prior to the outbreak of the influenza epidemic the prevalent diseases in Medina were malaria, nephritis, amoebic dysentery, and scurvy. The last, it is interesting to note, was killed off by Spanish influenza. This broke out in December and greatly increased the importance of sickness as a factor in undermining * tthe garrison’s morale. In February 1918, Dr. Shevket records that he was receiving many cases of scurvy from the railway garrisons for treatment. In June he noted that fever was un usually violent. His next record is that Spanish influenza set in in a virulent form suddenly in December and that the hospitals were unable to cope with the demands made upon them. Gen darmes and even civilians had to be enrolled as attendants. The death rate, which at the beginning of the month was between thirty to forty a day, rose to half as much again by the end. Some 850 of the troops died in December and another 200 in January before the evacuation. Lack of clean clothing aggravated the conditions, Dr. Shevket describing the hospitals as death factories. Doctors and patients alike were lousy. No unit was free from influenza and Fakhri himself had a sharp attack. Emin Bey in his proclamation gave the total daily loss from it as 150, and computed that the whole H.E.F. would be decimated by it in two months. The fear of it, indeed, gave Emin Bey movement and great stimulus. Fakri, on surrendering, said that the men had become very much weakened. And Captain Garland reports that of the first batch who reached Bir Derwish on Janu ary 4 many could hardly walk. The second lot and the rest, however, were much better. Supplies and Money. Foodstuffs. General. The food supply varied considerably. But, though at the close it was far from adequate, the conditions obtaining can never, in the light of historical parallels, be described as really severe. Fakhri Pasha, in the course of his conversations with Colonel Bassett, confessed that until 1918 he had been able to get considerable quantities of foodstuffs from local Bedu and Hail. In 1918, however, the Arab blockade had been tightened and he was able to smuggle in very little. The Hail source of supply ceased entirely, he said, on Ibn Rashid’s return there from Medain Saleh. Latterly, he had succeeded in capturing a few sheep from the Bedu at different times bj^ sorties from his advanced posts at Djejla and Bir el Mashi. Wheat. Dr. Shevket’s diary bears out Fakhri’s assertion that the pressure was not felt until 1918. On June 11, he notes suddenly that he could get no bread for breakfast, the ration for both offi cers and men having been reduced. Owing to the shortage, in fact, the Ramadan fast lasted only half a day. On August 18, fifty grammes more were taken off, and from that moment the shortage made itself rapidly and increasingly felt. A week later the ration was lowered by another fifty grammes, each man beingallowed only 100 grammes of flour per day. Complaint was made to Fakhri that this was insufficient to satisfy hunger, even though the meat ration was simultaneously increased. On October 6, it was ordered that 100 grammes of biscuit should he issued three days a week in lieu of bread, and Dr. Shevket added that the reserve stock was almost exhausted. On October 30, a final reduction of flour was made, i.e. from 100 grammes to eighty, the biscuit ration for the remaining days being lowered to ninety grammes. Fakhri’s formation of an agricultural company to cultivate commandeered ground, is noted elsewhere. In conversation with Captain Garland he said that, at the time of the evacuation, he had sown ten tons of wheat and was hoping to get a crop of fifty tons. Meat. The meat shortage became no less acute. On February 20, 1918, Dr. Shevket wrote that he had seen none for ten days ; and though the ration was raised to balance the lowering of the flour issue at the end of August, the increase can hardly have been sustained, for on September 25 he noted that mules which had died or fallen sick were being used for food. Rice. At the beginning of October the situation was somewhat alleviated by the arrival of a caravan at ElUla and Tebuk, bring ing a large quantity of rice. Fakhri issued an appeal to all officers for contributions to buy this in ; the result is not recorded, Dr. Shevket merely expressing his regret that he personally had parted with all his cash and was thus unable to help. Dates. Fakhri commandeered the date palms to a point which, according to Emin Bey, reduced the owners to starvation. In conversation with Captain Garland, Fakhri said that he was ex pecting a million and a half kilos from the 1919 harvest. Summary. Both Emin Bey and Dr. Shevket believed, as the evidence given above suggests, that the garrison was on the verge of starvation at the end of December. But it is clear that the shortage was due mainly to Fakhri’s definite intention to make three months’ supplies do duty for at least six. Fakhri himself described the ration as an adequate one. Further, the later batches of prisoners, who had presumably gone on to full lations after Fakhri’s departure, reached Geria looking compara tively well fed ; and finally, the Emirs on entering Medina installed merchants and after feeding the 600 civilians remaining trom the residue of the military stores decided that no further% relief was necessary. Captain Goldie believes from what he heard at different times that the officers had in some cases tended to do themselves well at their men’s expense ; and he noticed more than one incident amongst the prisoners which lent colour to the report. Tobacco. In regard to other supplies, tobacco was almost unprocurable and fetched a very big price. In February 1918 Dr. Shevket notes that he paid five gold piastres for a packet worth 20 paras ; and in November he could only get half a kilo of poor Aden tobacco for two Turkish pounds. Soap. \ At the end of July 1918 he discovered, on arranging to have a bath, that soap was no longer to be had. Fodder. Horses naturally suffered. Dr. Shevket was much concerned about his own, by name Mesoud. On February 3, 1918, he writes: “ All the animals at H.Q. are weakening but Mesoud is still strong. ” By the middle of the month, however, rationing of animals had become very difficult, and Mesoud was being given only one and a half kilos of rye daily. A week later he was getting even less. On March 23, Dr. Shevket had decided to sell him, being unable to feed him any longer. Clothes. Clothing presented great difficulties towards the end of the siege. New underwear, in particular, was not to be bought at any price. In May Dr. Shevket discovered, to his great annoyance, that he had brought with him only his winter outfit, and that he could procure nothing thinner locally for the hot weather. Finally, however, his orderly produced a blue galabieh, from which he had a jacket and trousers made. In October he found himself altogether without underclothing, and he could get neither material nor anyone to sew for him. He secured a piece of calico, however, and cut himself a pair of drawers, which he kept by him with the intention of sewing them when he could get thread. Money. Fakhri’s chief trouble in regard to supplies throughout was his shortage of gold. He made strenuous efforts to procure it and to reduce the disparity in value between it and paper money, which, on Captain Zia’s rival, stood at the ratio of seven to one. His recourse to the valuables in the Haram is dealt with else where. In addition he made a levy on his men just before the— 42 — surrender &lt;uid found tlifit much. fiRd been secieted, one privstc soldier alone, it is alleged, having hoarded some £80. The Bedu seldom accepted any other form of payment, though it is on record that they once exchanged carpets for rice. Further, Fakhri regularly gave monetary rewards for services well rendered. The troops had a considerable quantity of gold at the time of the evacuation, purchasing supplies freely from the Bedu at Geria, but no exact statistics have yet been procured. Some £2,000 in gold and a large amount in Turkish paper have been found amongst captured archives recently brought to Cairo. The Prophet's Tomb. On the evacuation the Haram was found to be intact. But it had been depleted of most of its valuables. Early in the war the mass of the treasure there, worth, according to the official register, about nine million pounds, was removed for safety to Constantinople in two consignments. Later Fakhri gave away many articles of lesser value, to both officers and civilians, partly as gifts or souvenirs to friends, partly in exchange for gold. One of his main reasons for doing so was his need of room for the storing of arms and provisions in the Chamber. He put there ammunition and supplies for six hundred men for six months, and widened the Bab el Selam street to admit of bringing a branch line of the, railway up to the door. Incidentally, on his departure, he left his sword on the Tomb, but it is rumoured to have been since abstracted. A large number of smaller ornaments he actually melted down. When he surrendered, he himself was wearing on his wrist as bangles some silver chains taken from lamps. How he accommodated this with his conscience is not clear. But, as regards these and all the rest, he kept most elaborate records and receipts, with a view presumably to their final return. A com mission on their restoration is sitting at Constantinople, and a complete list has been made out and signed by the Harem el Sherif. A petition to King Husein .signed by 200 notables of the locality gives an account of some of the chief things that are missing. According to it the Turks have removed the famous Kawkab el Durri (Star of Pearls); a gold crocodile over a yard in length and inlaid with pearls and precious stones; a gold crown, worked with diamonds, emeralds, and a large pearl, the size of a pigeon’s egg ; six gold candlesticks, two mounted with valuable stones ; and many other articles. Emin Bey made copy out of the re moval of these treasures and in his proclamation stated that under the regime of the Central Committee neither Fakhri nor his adherents would be allowed to approach the Chamber, and that everything that they had taken from it must at once be returned.43 Fakhri s Motives in resisting. In the course o£ a lengthy conversation with Colonel Bassett, Fakhri explained his failure to comply with the conditions of the armistice. Haidar Bey’s communication was, he said, the first perfectly explicit order which reached him. Till then his peculiar circum stances had not been sufficiently allowed for. The first wireless en clair message of November 10 {see p. 6) was picked up by Medina in fragments only. It was addressed to himself and Muhi Eddin Pasha of Asir simultaneously, but as it came through an enemy station he was forced to consider the possibility of its being a ruse de guerre. A complete version was picked up by Emin Bey’s staff at Tebuk up the line, but the special messenger sent with it was caught by some Anazeh tribesmen under Ferhan el Aida, and never reached Medina. From what he could decipher, he realised that he was being ordered to submit to the nearest Allied commander, but to whom did this refer in his case P The Arabs were rebels, while Garland was only a captain, who signed himself “for the British representative.” With regard, next, to Captain Zia’s visit, Captain Garland’s letter, containing the list of clauses, was inconsistent in regard to Clause 16 with the list brought by Captain Zia ; and the latter was unable to explain the term “ Allied Commander ” satisfactorily. Could he, therefore, being a general in command of an army, surrender in such uncertainty to a British captain holding a civilian post, especially as he had a peculiar religious charge, the care of the Haram ? If he had had Haidar Bey’s letter and the Imperial Trade at first, he would, he said, have complied without any delay or demur. He wished, as it was, to come to some definite arrange ment and was much upset when negotiations were broken off on December 23, at a time when he was expecting answers to his telegrams to Constantinople. Colonel Bassett, in commenting on Fakhri’s explanations, points out that the circumstances in which the lattei was placed justified much of what he did. He legalded the Arabs as icbels, and may even not have known that they had been recognised officially as Allies. As a result he regarded surrender to them as dishonourable and it is rumoured that his final arrest was planned with his own connivance. Probably, too, he hoped till the last to be allowed exemption from imprisonment by reason of his peculiar position as defender of the Prophet’s Tomb, on the ground that it gave him a quasi-international status. Thi any consideration of his actions too, his state of health, described elsewhere, must be borne in mind. In conversation with Colonel Bassett he said that at times during the siege he had trouble with his head. The former found that his mind frequently wandered, and is of the opinion that— —'— —WaWK — 44 — during the last phase, illness, melancholia and religious fanaticism brought him to a state verging on insanity. The Threat to destroy the Dardanelles Forts. The attitude o£ the Turkish Government towards Fakhri’s refusal to surrender was, from all the evidence, scrupulously correct. When, on December 16, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed that the Dardanelles Forts would be destroyed unless Fakhri at once complied with the armistice terms, he immediately returned ym emphatic protest. The Government had, he said, done their best. If Fakhri continued to resist after their written message reached him—which they regarded as most improbable— they would punish him for insubordination according to military law. They must protest against this decision, which was justified by no existing right. They had hoped that the previous willing ness of the Turkish Government to comply with British requests was sufficiently appreciated to make recourse to such threats useless. In forwarding this answer, the British High Commissioner, Constantinople, observed that there was no evidence that the Turkish Government was a party to or previously cognisant of Fakhri’s line of action and that all communications between them had passed quite openly. Relations with Ihn Saud. No evidence which has so far come to light since the evacua tion tends directly to prove that there was any concerted plan of action between Ibn Saud and Fakhri. Fakhri in conversation with Colonel Bassett made very posi tive assertions to the contrary. Ibn Saud, he said, had been a serious thorn in his side. He had arrested agents sent to purchase supplies in Kasim, and had not only stopped them from buying but had refused to allow them to return to Medina. He had, too, , a a camels i' 1 Nejd, with the result that some A o,000 paid for them became a dead loss. Later, when the Medina railway communications were cut, Fakhri appealed to him tor 200 camel loads of grain but got no reply. Fakhri gratui tously mentioned the British treaty with him, saying that it had been a good move on our part ; for had Ibn Saud sent even 500 ,, e T t° 118 help he could have kept his communications with the itast open On another occasion he described him as by far the cleverest of the Arabian chiefs. Colonel Bassett formed the impression, however, that Fakhri was keeping something back. And a direct inconsistency between the evidence of Captain Zia and that of the captured staff is signi- FmOoV C&lt; T a f m f Z, i a ® tated /efimtely that, while he was in Medina, a On i s adjutant had read him a friendly letter from Ibn Saud containing congratulations on the success of the Turkish resistance!— 45 — The staff, however, when interrogated on their capture denied all knowledge of any such communication and nothing lias been captured which throws any light on the matter. The divergence suggests at least that the Turks wished to say nothing that could prejudice I bn Sand in our eyes. It appears, from information given to Captain Goldie by prisoners, that Fakhri himself alone knows the true situation. He conducted all correspondence with Ibn Sand personally, writing his letters in manuscript and keeping no copies. The latter’s messengers, too, were brought in from and sent out to the outpost line under special escort, and allowed no freedom while in Medina. Fakhri in fact telephoned to the outposts to confirm their departure. Finally, in his Secret Service accounts were items of £3 on several occasions paid to “messengers from Nejd.” Fakhri s Provision for the Future of Medina. One of the last of Fakhri’s actions prior to his arrest was the writing of a circular letter to the following Medina notables, appointing them a committee to take over civilian affairs. Meh- meh Khurshid, Kadi; Zeki Bey, Chief Accountant; Kemal Bey, Hi rector of Correspondence ; Ahmed Kemahi, Mufti ; Salih Shakbeha Effendi, Member of Administrative Council ; Dhiab Effendi, Assistant Governor ; and the Officer Commanding the Gendarmerie. In the letter he says that he has come to the decision owing to ill-health and his preoccupation with military affairs. He instructs them to devote their attention in particular to the following points :— (a) The settling of accounts for dates with the military authorities. (b) The return of property occupied by the military for agriculture, giving the owners the crops of trefoil, vegetables and wheat sown therein, as compensation. (c) The collection of lists of goods requisitioned by the lines of communication and their putting in order so that claims might be dealt with promptly and fairly as they arose. (d) The repayment of loans levied compulsorily on the civilian inhabitants with money drawn from the military admi nistration. (G) The appointment of a temporary President of the Muni cipality, etc. ( /*) The assessment of certain articles of value taken from (7/) The taking over ot the cash balances ot the rubhc works Department and the tax proceeds of the Municipality of Public Works (both of which had apparently been in military hands) ; this money to be put in the Haram Sherif and devoted to pay ment for work done on the widening of the Bab el Selam Street and similar improvements. I— 46 — (h) The transference of the gendarmerie to the control of the Administrative Council. Note .—The gendarmerie were mainly Ageyl officered by Turks. Being professionally guides, carriers and the like, they were working on both sides in large numbers. (i) All purely civilian affairs. Note .—Systematic deportation of the population took place early in the war, and many of the rest drifted away later. When the Emirs entered only 600 civilians remained. Fakhri stated that before the war the population was about 40,000, at a rough estimate. When he took command, however, it was only 20,000. The Proclamations. Emin Bey, the Chief of Staff in Medina, whose surrender on January 1 was the signal for wholesale desertion (see pages 7, 17, 59), appears to have engineered his whole conspiracy in about twenty-four hours. He formed a secret society among such officers as were demoralised by the influenza epidemic and Zia’s revelations. On December 28, they circulated a joint manifesto, signing them selves the Central Committee. A copy of it has now been received and translated. It is lengthy and rambling, but states the case against Fakhri without omitting a point. It begins and ends “ Let us wake up ! ” and its line of argument in brief is as follows :— u The recent armistice is tantamount to peace. By it all Arabia is lost to us ; our army at home is already being demobilised and the Arab Government has begun its work of reconstruction. The Entente have won so completely that we can do no good by holding on. “ Our present plight is due to Fakhri’s obstinacy and untruthfulness. He has blundered all through, from the fatal moment when, in the middle of 1917, the Maan concentration was split up at his instance. How he asks for an Imperial irade, although there is no possible justifi cation for one, seeing that we are under a constitutional government, which is responsible for peace and war. Even if he got an irade he would continue his stubbornness. Our Government has done all that is possible in the circumstances, having retained the essentially Turkish pro vinces of Kars, Batoum and Ardahan. In fact, we have really lost only men and money like all the countries engaged in the war, for the Arabs would have become independent of us eventually in any case. As it is, they will not remain our enemies, brothers as they are in religion and history; look, already, at the47 arrangements that they have made to ensure our comfort as prisoners between here and the coast. “ All, therefore, that Fakhri is doing by his present behaviour is to condemn 12,000 good Moslems to a profitless death at the rate of 100 a day. “We feel that the time for action has come. We are quite logical in our aims. We reverence the Tomb, and believe that Fakhri’s actions are senseless and would be disapproved of by Mohammed himself, for the Koran no where tells us that it is good to die in vain. “ We propose to put the garrison on full rations and open negotiations with the Allies at once; to stop the works of the agricultural staff and settle all debts as soon as possible ; to give free rations to all poor civilians and let the rich buy at municipal rates—which will be fixed at the same level as our base buys its stores ; and to punish all profiteering. “ If we must die, let us die at home, not here as rebels against our Government, incurring the contempt of all humanity. “ This is our first and last proclamation.” Immediately after the circulation of this report, Fakhri sent for Emin Bey, but the latter advisedly decamped and surrendered as has already been described. After his departure two procla mations appeared in answer in rapid succession. They bore no signature but were undoubtedly published by Fakhri’s authority, as Captain Garland has pointed out (p. 17). Copies of them have been secured. They constitute a poor answer to the mani festo, shirking the main and raising irrelevant issues. They are, however, enlivened by vehement abuse of Emin Bey, and are interesting by reason of some far-fetched historical analogies quoted in them. Their gist is as follows :— “ Emin Bey bears Fakhri a personal grudge. We are doomed not to demobilisation, but to prisoners’ camps in Egypt. All we want is a peaceful return home, but the British are retaining our prisoners although we have released theirs, e.g. in Anatolia. “ Emin Bey is wrong with regard to constitutionalism. The Sultan declares war or peace. Further, at a time when the Government is at the mercy of an enemy occupation he alone can adequately express the popular will. In this case, Fakhri has a special duty towards him as Caliph in con nection with the Haram. His Caliphial authority is universal and is too well established traditionally to need record in the constitution. Remember how many of England’s laws are traditional. “ Our food situation compares favourably with that of any other siege in history. An armistice is not peace. IfI — - .'.■ t'-gga — 48 — you surrender to these Arab rebels, beware of being cursed by the Moslem world and by historians for ever. “ Remember that Tahsin Pasha, who surrendered Salonica to the Greeks, is still in disgrace. That our brothers in Tripoli and Asir obeyed their consciences and refused when called upon to surrender ; and that in the Balkan War the Bulgarians forced us to sign an armistice at Chatalja ; but we made them finally sign the Peace of Adrianople.” Fakhri's Relations with the Garrison. Fakhri seems to have acted throughout the siege on the ignotum pro magnijico principle. Dr. Shevket’s diary contains no personal touches about him whatsoever. When he reached Bir Derwish after his arrest in the Haram and had conversed with Haidar Bey, he expressed himself glad to talk, as he had, he said, spoken hardly a word to anyone for two months. His policy appears to have paid him well up to a point; for during the visit of the first commission to Bir Derwish it was apparent that even Ali Negib stood in wholesome awe of him. He appears, too, to have kept the garrison in ignorance of events outside as much as possible and to have encouraged them to resist by misstatements, e.g. that surrender would involve the handing over of the keys of the Holy City to a British captain. On December 26, on the other hand, Dr. Shevket records that he summoned all unit commanders to him and read them the armistice conditions, adding that acceptance of them would involve impri sonment in Egypt. But this can only have been to counteract the statements which Captain Zia had made privately to the staff ; for normally everything arriving by post was censored by him, and all newspapers were burned unread in his presence. As a rule, such bad news as reached the garrison was derived from rumours or belated official communiques which Fakhri allowed to pass. The wireless stations, however, were a source of leakage. Emin Bey, as said above, picked up the Armistice conditions before they were deciphered in Medina. Finally, Fakhri personally conducted all important diplomatic negotiations with notables, e.g. Ibn Saud, his relations with whom are described elsewhere. His aloofness, however, put him naturally at a disadvantage by keeping him out of immediate touch with the feeling of the garrison and dependent on espionage. Emin Bey was able to engineer his conspiracy in a day, Fakhri apparently not knowing of it till after the circulation of the Central Committee’s manifesto, by which time Emin himself was out of reach. Strict bounds were enforced throughout the siege. For ong periods no troops were allowed out of barracks ; and in general they mixed very little with the civilian population, though or the most part the nearest enemy points were at least fifteen miles away.Since the evacuation it has been possible to test the general teeling of the garrison towards him fairly accurately, and it was much what might have been expected. The depression caused by the December epidemic, increased by Captain Zia’s revelations, gave Emin Bey a following amongst the junior officers in particular. But the rest had. the greatest possible respect for Fakhri and can find no words too bad for Emin’s action in surrendering independently and thus causing so ignominious an end to the siege. Fakhri 1 s Notes on the H.E.F. In a private diary Fakhri gives some account of the history of the Hejaz Expeditionary Force. On May 22, 1916, the Xllth (Mosul) Army Corps was transferred to Medina in view of suspicious movements on the part of the Sherif of Mecca. On the 30th Fakhri himself arrived with some of his staff. On June 16 he received an order to suppress the revolt, which had broken out some fortnight pre viously. On July 17 the Xllth Corps, composed now mainly of different units, was renamed the Hejaz Expeditionary Force and given the powers of an Army. Between June 26 and December 28 a number of points were captured, but finally, by an order dated December 23, they were abandoned, and a general retirement took place to the positions held till the surrender, viz. Medina with Bir Mashi and Bir Jlejla as advanced posts. On November 11, 1917, the Agricultural Company and Inspectorate was formed, to cultivate commandeered property. On November 18 a temporary wireless station in Medina began to work. But the permanent station which ensured direct communication with Damascus was not completed till March 4, 1918. On March 30, 1918, the northern limit of the sphere under the H.E.F. was extended to Wadi Haja (Wadi Hesa ?). The rest comprises chance jottings in connection with the formation, disbandment and regrouping of units, inspectorates, military courts and the like, with a list of the chief appointments made under his command. Finally, two notes which occur, both somewhat irrelevantly, in different places are worth recording :— (T) The order for general mobilisation from the Ministry of War was received at Mosul on August 2, 1914, and was put into effect next day. (2) By an Army Order dated September 30, 1915, the Armenian revolt at Urba was suppressed.——— ~' — 50 — Secret Service Funds. Amongst Fakhri’s papers were discovered some Secret Ser vice accounts covering apparently the latter months of 1917. As might be expected, they show for the most part payment to agents, spies, sheikhs on submission, deserters and the like ; and also large allowances to the Rector of the Haram Sherif and other officials of the Prophet’s Mosque. The most interesting of the payments are made to :— 1. Messengers from the Yemen. These were constanly coming in. 2. ^For gold watches presented in December 1917 to Ibn Rashid’s brother and uncle. There is also a payment to a photo grapher for a portrait of Ibn Rashid himself. 3. To the son and followers of Sheikh Hussein Pasha ibn Muberik of Rabegh. They seem to have come into Medina more than once and to have been entertained lavishly and paid hand somely. 4. To sheikhs and tribesmen of two sections of the Harb viz. the Hawazim and Beni Amr. 5. ^ For “ nitrate of potash to melt the silver... of the Holy Tomb ” 200 gold piastres. This particular item refers, it has been stated, to some candlesticks. 6. Compensation for land-mine laying, presumably paid to men injured in the process or to their families. 7. To Sheikh Mohammed Ghaneim, Emir of the Juheinah twice. ’ 8. To one Hamza Tewfik of Hail, accountant of Abdul Hamid el Masri, who was robbed of his effects at Teima. .A list of the names of recipients of monies out of these Secret Service funds is being prepared, and a copy of it will be put at Jimg Husem s disposal for future reference. Turkish Attitude to the Loss of Arabia. The equanimity with which many Turks accept the loss of Arabia is illustrated afresh in Emin Bey’s manifesto. He points out that even in peace time, whole divisions were necessary to keep order; and that even they were compelled to enlist the sympathies of local sheikhs in order to be able to move about with immunity m Hejaz, Asir and Mesopotamia. Even had the Central I owers won, he adds, Turkey would not have been able to maintain her hold on Arabia had Germany, for instance, desired its independence. ’ timAATlTY’ R 6 latte j' WOU , ld l 1 *™ been on, y a question of tune. All JNegib Bey said much the same on another occasion adding that Medina and Mecca were the only places that Turkey cared about, owing to their importance from a religious point ofTribal information from Turkish Sources. Amongst the documents taken from prisoners of war weie several lists, compiled by a Turkish Intelligence officer named Ulvi giving accounts of some of the Hejaz tribes. Ihese docu ments are being checked and tabulated, and in due course will be circulated The tribal divisions are much more numerous than those given in the Handbook of Hejaz, whilst the names of the Sheikhs differ in almost every case. „ . , , The following is an outline of the contents of the documents and of the more important details in which they differ from our previous information. Moahib tribe (page 34 of Handbook). The Turkish record describes this as a subsection of the Billi. Billi tribe (page 35 of Handbook). This tribe is stated to be divided into two sections, Suleiman Rufada and Abu Sihamah, under separate Sheikhs, that of t ic latter being given as Sheikh Hamd Abu Sihamah Eleven sub- actions are named of the Suleiman Rufadah section, as follows: Fawadhil, Helban, Remusha, Fereyat, Maqlat, El Herb, Dlnbal, KaraTa Kuwain, Moahib, and Dhahma. 1 . . No sub-sections are given of the Abu Sihamah ; and as it is stated to comprise only 200 combatants, the lurkish list is pro bably in error in showing it as a separate section The Hejaz Handbook gives two chief sections : Khuzann (Kuwain in above list) and Makhalad ; and includes the Abu Sihamah as a sub-section of the latter. But our tribal information of the Billi is very incomplete. Juheinah tribe (page 36 of Handbook). . The Turkish lists give the names of 18 sub-sections of the Malik section and 14 of the Musa The Beni Ibrahim is shown as a subsection of the Mftsa, whilst our Handbook includes it amongst the^Mahk ^ ^ bg ^ to collect 4)000 com batants and the Musa 3,000.

The two known main sections, Beni Salim and Beni Masrffh are given in the Turkish statement, but the Beni Meimun shewn h, the Handbook as an alternative name of Beni Salim figures as ' subsection of the latter and is divided into the following : Ahamda, Wuld Mohammed, Subh, Mahamid, Seraha, Beni Hay eh, El Euwad, Rahala.SKETCH MAP of HEJAZI * SECRET. / ARAB BULLETIN.

When; the Armistice was concluded the Turks were still maintaining garrisons at Ebhah, Muhail, Joz Belair (lb miles inland from Kunfidah), and at Sheibein in the country of the Rijal el Ma. The Asir command was independent of pud separate from the Yemen command, the G.0.0. being Major- General Muhieddin Pasha. The total Turkish strength in Asir, according to figures supplied by the Turkish staff officer who came to Jeizan to arrange the evacuation, was 124 officers and 2,418 men, not counting women, children, civilians, and the locally raised gendarmerie. The numbers actually evacuated were 117 officers and 2,311 other ranks, with 159 non-combatants. The Joz Belair garrison num bered 333 officers and men, and the Muhail garrison roughly the same ; the great bulk of the remainder were concentrated at Ebhah. „ , . . . . n • There was practically no fighting in Asir, as the Icfnsi s aggressive efforts were concentrated against the Turkish force m the Loheiyah and Abs region. This latter was a detachment, less than a thousand strong, led by Ghaleb Bey, and belonging to the Yemen command. Nevertheless, though they had no fighting to do, the expe riences of the Asir force during the four years of war must have been unpleasant and exceedingly monotonous. Their normal channel of communication with Turkey was via Kunfidah ; the Navy, needless to say, saw to it that this was closed when war began. In peace time, apparently, the Turks maintained some sort of control of the Kunfidah-Joz-Muhail-Ebhah route ; but it is significant of the incompleteness of their hold over the country that this was the only road which they did control Ebhah was provisioned by this long and difficult route, most of it a mountain track thomdi the Ebhah-Shukeik road was only about one-third as long, and was, as the evacuation proved, practicable for heavily laden baggage animals. When the war ended they had evidently ceased to maintain any regular communication with Kunfidah, as Muhieddin Pasha asked to be allowed to send that garrison their evacuation orders by sea. -j 11 The political difficulties of the Turks, always considerable, must have been enormously increased by the advent of war, bringing first of all the complete severance of communications with Constantinople, and then the adoption of the anti-Turkish cause by the Idrisi and King Husein successively. However, Muhieddin Pasha appears to have known how to handle Arabs, and not only kept his strong places intact for four years, but, a much more remarkable feat, evacuated his forces without having to fire a shot. £ i • u Round Ebhah and Muhail stretched small spheres of Turkish influence and the Turks had also close relations with some of the Arabs near their other two garrisons. Possibly the following list,•' 1 54 (i a rtain amount of Beni Mugheid support:— 405 rifles.

It may be doubted, however, whether there was any real pro-1 urkisli feeling except round Ebhah, where intermarriage had drawn Turks and Arabs closer together and produced a small civilian population of mixed origin. Elsewhere any hold the I urks^ had over Arab tribes was probably intermittent and precarious, and depended on the fact that Arabs can always be found who hate some other Arabs more than they hate the foreigner, and will ally themselves with the latter in return for gifts of arms and ammunition. I he I urks stated that in normal times they received a subsidy ol A h. 90,000 per annum from Constantinople for administrative expenses in Asir. During the war this had been cut off; officers and men had received no pay and had got heavily into debt to merchants and others ; supplies had been requisitioned from friendly tribes and not paid for. Muhieddin Pasha, who had been crippled with rheumatism for six months and, for that reason, perhaps was not sorry that duty called him away from a part of the world where little was available in the way of medical treatment, showed much greater readiness to surrender than the urkish commanders at hanaa and Medina. He did, however, put in a strong plea for financial assistance in order to enable him to discharge public and private debts before leaving, describing t us as a necessity if his journey to the coast was to be unopposed. ic event proved that, he was exaggerating, but he would cer tainly have had great difficulties in reaching the coast if the Arabs had been hostile. He appears to have solved his problem, when once it became clear to him that no assistance in money was forthcoming, by taking up the role of reconciliator between Hassan ibn Ah ibn Aidh and the Idrisi. Ibn Aidh and the pro- urk tribes of the Ebhah district were naturally nervous as to their position when Turkish support was withdrawn. They were surrounded by pro-Idrisian tribes, who would be only too ready to attack them at a word from the Idrisi, and the latter, a ruler i . g 5, eat ] ) ,?' Ver ., and P resti £ e accor( Iing to local standards, was , ( . ss J UM . . * 1111 &lt; ‘ s awa .7* TIl «y dad most of them fought against hm. and it was an aggravation of the offence that many of them previously fought with him. The Idrisi was in a position to produced by the Turks when accounting for the disposal of their munitions at the time of the evacuation, and showing the number of rifles supplied to various Arab tribes, gives a fairlv accurate idea of where they had at one time or another foun r r \ VI *$&gt; i 1/ prove either the most formidable of enemies or the most efficient of protectors. The Idrisi’s attitude towards the Ebhah question after the Armistice was ostensibly one of detachment, anxious and expectant, but deliberate and complete. There are at any rate some good reasons for supposing that his ostensible attitude was also^ his real one. He said he had received one bad snub over Kunfidah and did not want another over Ebhah. He realised that if he laid himself open to a charge of intrigue in that quarter, Iving Husein, with British support, might be in a position to inflict another public humiliation on him. The avoidance of such humiliations is a master motive in the Idrisi s mind, because he not only has a very good opinion of himself, but is conscious that he must make up in personal what he lacks in hereditary dignity. ‘ _ The case, however, would be entirely altered il Ibn Aidh should offer a voluntary submission. \\ hen Muhieddin Pasha so acted as to smooth things over between the Idrisi and Ibn Aidh, as he undoubtedly did, he put himself in the good books of both, and secured an unmolested passage to the coast. i he added difficulties of evacuation resulting from shortage of money made Muhieddin Pasha lean all the more heavily on the Idrisi. The net result was that at any rate during the time of the eva cuation the Idrisi exercised some sort of real overlordship at and near Ebhah. Ibn Aidh and other former pro-Turks addressed him in conciliatory and submissive language, and Ids representatives passed freely to and from Ebhah supervising and negotiating. There is no obvious reason why Ibn Aidh should feel less de pendent on the Idrisi now that the departure of the Turks is a fact, than he at once felt when it became a probabdity, and in the light of events the joint approaches made by Muhieddin Pasha and Ibn Aidh to King Husein appear to have been merely an effort to ensure that there should be a back door open, if the front door through the Idrisi’s territories should prove to be shut. One of the great difficulties of the evacuation was the disposal of the war material stored at Ebhah. The natives could withstand parting with the Turks, but no Arab could bear with equanimity to see°guns, shells, and rifles carried quietly away out of reach. Ibn Aidh, by promising more than sufficient camels and then at the last moment supplying only a very inadequate number, did his best to ensure that as large as possible a proportion of these munitions should remain at Ebhah. Muhieddin Pasha, however, by bringing down the complete tale of mountain guns and machine guns, while leaving behind more ammunition for both than°had been agreed upon, seems to have done what he could to fulfil his obligations in the spirit, if he could not fulfil them in the letter. The Turks as they arrived on the coast appeared a him, sturdy, well disciplined, and soldierly-looking lot of men, in spite of their uniforms cut out of worn-out tents and theirDilapidated equipment and material. It was with quite a shock of surprise that one saw emerge from the distant line of forbidding- looking mountains, across the monotonous Tihamah with its black- ringletted, half-naked Arabs, a body of people of comparatively European aspect, bringing with them children with flaxen hair and complexions more characteristic of Scandinavia than tropical Arabia. 1 he main evacuation took place via Shukeik, where there is a comparatively abundant rainfall, due to the closer approach of the mountains to the sea; where millet and indigo flourish ; and where there is abundant pasturage. The villages were large and clean, and the inhabitants unhesitatingly obeyed the Idrisi’s order that one should be cleared for the accommodation of the Turks. An enclosure was fenced off on the sea-shore, at the place of embarkation. The 1 urks marched into this and surrendered their arms and material. These were then counted and handed over to the Idrisi for safe keeping, in return for a receipt, pending an arrangement between him and H.M. Grovermnent as to their ultimate disposal. The items thus handed over included 1,863 rifles, 2bo mules,^ 18 mountain guns, 4 machine guns, upwards of 300 boxes of S.A.A., and 1,080 shells. Five heavy guns were left at Ebhah, one at Muhail and two at Sheibein. These, the Turks said, and their statement is supported by what is known of the country, could not be brought to the coast except by the expenditure of a large amount of labour. Ihoy had been man handled up from Kunfidah over the mountain roads by a couple of battalions of men. Over three million rounds of S.A.A., much of it no doubt more fit for a museum than for use, and over ten thousand shells of various types were left behind, chiefly at Ebhah. for this Ibn Aidh and his prevarication over camels was partly responsible, but in any case it would have been impossible to bring even the greater part of it down. Taking into consideration merely the normally dangerous state of the roads, Muhieddin Pasha was obliged to evacuate quickly when he had once begun, and sufficient camels could not be obtained m the mountains where apparently the Tihamah camels cannot be used—-for the almost simultaneous transport of such a mass of material. Ibn Aidh accepted responsibility for producing any of this—and particularly that portion abandoned as a result of ns failure to provide transport—on demand from the Idrisi, and the latter seemed confident he would not dare to try to evade t is responsibility. More effective as a safeguard against trouble is the tact that guns, rifles and machine guns seem to be fairly completely accounted for. Taking things on the whole, therefore, Muhieddin Pasha appears to have accepted his, obligations towards us loyally. e made an attempt to extort money assistance, but his financial uimculties were certainly genuine. 1 here are various indications which, though trifling in ' iemse ve,t S ht in well with Captain Garland’s suggestion inNo. 109 of the Arab Bulletin, that there was some scheme in the air for the revival of the Turkish regime through joint action by Fakhri Pasha, Ibn Saud, and the Turks in Asir and Yemen. Between October and January, Sanaa and Ebhah must almost certainly have been in communication with each other, and the marked anxiety of Muhieddin Pasha to avoid all contact with the Yemen command after surrender, suggests that acute differences of opinion had preceded the actual difference of policy. The activity of a pro-Ibn Saud force to the east of Ebhah, during the period intervening between the Armistice and the evacuation, is also significant. Ghaleb Bey’s force to the south, between Abs and Loheiyah, with which the Idrisi had been most concerned while the fighting lasted, he had the least dealings with when it came to the surrender, except to receive the submission which the tribes of those parts hastened to offer as soon as the news of the Armistice was published. Ghaleb Bey, so far as he condescended to be explicit at all in answer to invitations to surrender, said that he must take his orders from Sanaa, and that moreover the Idrisi was a rebel, and he would have no dealings with rebels. He became therefore involved in the die-hard policy adopted by most of the Yemen command, in collusion with the Imam Aehya, and eventually (except for the garrisons of El Atn which made an independent surrender) evacuated his men and material via Hodeidah. # There are various statements in an article on the Effects of the Armistice in South-west Arabia” which appeared in Number 109 of the Arab Bulletin (page 24), which, if the foregoing views are correct, do not quite do justice to the Idrisi. Is it a correct representation of facts to contrast with King Husein, whose attitude is depicted as one of dignified restraint, an Idrisi who is “active in his propaganda,” or to describe Seyyid Mustafa’s denial of Idrisian intrigue among the Zahran and Ghamid tribes as partial ? Seyyid Mustafa pledged his personal word of honour and said, “ Let them produce the letters if they exist.” On the other hand the successive reports, at once inaccurate and of a tenor favourable to King Husein, which emanated from Mecca about events in Ebhah, do not suggest an attitude of complete detachment on the part of the King. It must indeed be very difficult for any Arabian ruler, however loyal he may be, to hold entirely aloof from the “vortex of intrigue” referred to in the same article, when such acute expectancy and uncertainty is added to the ordinary chaotic vagueness of Arabian politics, and this applies to both parties concerned. Enough has been said to make it clear that there is at least room for a difference of opinion as to whether “ on the basis of self-determination, the Beni Mugheid should at the present moment probably fall within the King’s sphere.” ^ Ibn Aidh and those who act with him have the same preoccupation as any other’ &gt; — 58 — Arabian chiefs : i.e. to gain as much security as possible from the friendship of some powerful protector and to give as little as possible in return. Geography, and the recent course of events, suggest that the Idrisi is destined to be the protector ; what degree of submission he can exact in return remains to be seem Again, it is said that the Idrisi’s prestige has not been enhanced by the war and that his military incompetence has excited general comment. His military incompetence was indeed remarkable according to European standards, but that Arabs should be defied by a handful of Turks in entrenchments is a fact by no means unparalleled in Arabia, where more remarkable examples of military incompetence may pass without exciting any comment at all. The Idrisi’s prestige was low during the summer of 1918, but has regained more than all it had lost with the downfall of the Turk, whose consistent enemy he had been. The ready offers of submission which flowed in as soon as the Turk got ready to depart are evidence of this. In order that a really good understanding may be arrived at between King Husein and the Idrisi, which would do much to stabilize things in Arabia, the first thing to be done is to remove one element of irritation and uncertainty by delimiting their claims.. The two main points at issue are Ebhah, where there appears to be a fait accompli which it will be difficult to undo, and Kunfidah, which is as sore a point as ever with the Idrisi. Both rulers would probably take quietly disappointments at the hand of the British which they would not accept from each other, provided the decisions had the appearance of reasoned awards, rather than of mere bargains based on expediency. The Idrisi is a much less attractive as well as a much less important figure than King Husein or his sons, but he has certain characteristics which make him a good man to have political dealings with. Apparently in his very young and ambitious days, when the whole matter of a national Arab movement against the Turks was merely a dream full of untested possibilities, he did contemplate some sort of league of Arab Emirs in which he was to play the leading part. Probably it is the memory of this presumption which inclines King Husein to think of him chiefly as an interloper. But the bent of the Idrisi’s mind is, above all, practical, and concerned with the present and the future. Loyalty and interest now both attach him to the British, whose position in the world he is by no means inclined to underestimate, and will supply a strong reason why their friends should be his friends. Moreover, if he once makes an engagement, his record shows that he is more likely than most Arabs to keep it. As Seyyid Mustafa has often said, there is no “ Keraha, ” between the Idrisi and the King. The Idrisi is not, however, in the least likely to admit any assumption of superior standing on the part of the King, far less to make any kind of real submission to him at present. He is, so far as other Arabian rulers are concerned, exceedingly touchy about his dignity, and probably r t * * Yrealises and resents the fact that the King looks down on him. The most he would give at present is some sort ot ceremonial primacy to the King as guardian oi the Holy Places^ Hut tha , i£ the King can bring any effective centralising influences into existence, might be enough to bring much more. It is a wild idea perhaps, but, if the Idrisi, the Imam Yahya, and Ibn baud could be induced to habituate themselves to sending representatives to a council which would discuss matters of common interest to all Arabia, the natural meeting place of such a council would be Mecca, and its natural leader the King. The reality of ns powei would otow with the usefulness of the council, and that would depend”largely on the King himself. Such^ a path to some sort of real sovereignty, if practicable at all in such a primitive country as Arabia, would require a capacity for waiting, and toi distinguishing the substance from the shadow, which perhaps is not characteristic of King Husein. It would be a great mistake for us or for King Husem to regard the Idrisi as a negligible quantity He is Arm V established in a corner of Arabia with a marked character and spirit ot independence of its own. His is potentially tlie i chest province in Arabia except the Yemen, and the Musi is progressively inclined as regards trade, education sanitation etc Moreover, ignorant as he is of the western world, he is by no means a narrow fanatic, but has some discretion m choosing his ends, and patience and judgment in adapting his means to the . N. W. C. King Husein and Khurma. The following note has been compiled from reports (dated April 1 to 9, 1919) submitted by Husein Kftendi Kuln vvlnlst accompanying King Husein on a visit to Emir Abdullah at AS The King met Emir Abdullah on April 1 at Asheirah (80 miles Y.E. of Mecca) and to the assembly of ashraf, sheikhs, and officers, made a long speech, in the course of which he said, “I swear by God, the omnipotent, that had it not been foi t ic great help, financial and otherwise, which was and is still being rendered by Great Britain, the Arab revolt would not have taken place and the Arabs would never have obtained their indepen dence. Great Britain is an aider of Islam. She is the defender and sincere friend of all the Arabs. We are greatly indebted to Great Britain and it is our duty to be faithful to her. The British Government is just and sympathetic. Had it not been for the thousands and thousands of tons of supplies given to us bv her all the Arabs would have starved, and cannibalism would have prevailed all over the country. You must also remember that the Arabs have acted their part splendidly and rendered a very great help in this war to Great Britain—our true ally. J After further counselling the local tribesmen to refrain fromjifttaUcs and reprisal,s on tne Ikhwan, Ills Highness avowed that lie was ready to pardon freely and to assist all deserters from his’ flock who returned to him from the other side, for he fervently desired to avoid tribal warfare. i As Emir Abdullah himself had often prophesied before making the journey from Medina, his presence east of Mecca is apparently having a wholesome effect in inducing the local tribes men to submit to the King. Husein Effendi Ruhi reports that within a few days of Abdullah’s entry into Asheirah, over 10,000 of them had arrived, including most of the Miqatah, a sub-tribe of the Ateibah. Some of the Buquin have also surrendered, but thi 8 sub-tribe are still serving under the banner of Khahd, the rebel Emir of Khurma. f . In extenuation of their behaviour in joining the Ikhwan the Arabs explained that they were terrorised into con version 5 those who refused being, in the words of witnesses, “ slaug-htered like sheep. ° Certain members of the El Hurith (probably the Sherifian clan) appeared before Emir Abdullah with complaints of Ikhwan raids on their settlements west of Taraba.

Husein Effendi Ruhi has sent in a very carefully complied list of the sub-tribes of the Buqum and Seber who inhabit the Khurma district and copies will be issued to all concerned in due course. Later News. Since going to press a telegram has been received from Jeddah (May 9, 1919) conveying a report submitted by Emir Abdullah to the King on recent events near Khurma The Emir states that Wahabis attacked and looted Qasasmah r and Mahadlah Arabs (Ruqah section o£ Ateibah) at Degheibjah, carrying off the wife and daughter of the head Sheikh and many animals. Hearing of the raid, a detached force of Abdullah s at Abaab, about 45 miles south of Degheibjah, pursued the raiders but failed to overtake them. However, they surprised another enemy party advancing to attack a Sherifian post at El Mardamah, about 75 miles north of Khurma, killing thirty-one, and captuung man *At Radheim (believed to be west of Khurma but its exact position is not exactly known) a patrol sent out by Abdullah towards Khurma found a large Wahabi camp and threw hand- grenades amongst the sleeping enemy, who fled leaving thirty-four killed and wounded. The King stated that Abdullah was about to advance his headquarters to El Gfheraif, some 70 miles south-west of Khurma. The actions reported will certainly irritate Ibn baud, who, no doubt, will blame Abdullah as the aggressor. It was hoped that the pressure which Baghdad is putting upon him would convince him that his wisest policy is to withdraw his support entirely from Emir Khalid and leave the King free to deal wit i that “ rebel,” but a telegram from Baghdad (May 10) states that Ibn Saud is proceeding to his western frontier ostensibly to quieten his tribesmen/ It is very doubtful, however, whether Emir Abdullah will look upon the move in this light and news of more fighting may be expected before long. Ibn Saud and Khurma. As was not unexpected, Emir Abdullah’s advance in force towards Khurma, and his meeting with the King, are causing some consternation in the Wahabi camps. Ibn Saud has recent y written a letter (April 20) to the Political Agent, Bahrein, in' f / r r which it is clear that he regards the Sheridan move as a threat, if not as an actual act of aggression, and he appears to have believed that the King was to accompany the expedition farther eastward. In begging us to use our influence to restrain King Husein, Ibn Sand states that if the King will remain in his own town he will do the same, and will submit the Khurma dispute to our arbitration. On ^ the other hand, il the King maintains his present threatening position on the frontier and will not follow our advice to withdraw, then, says Ibn Sand, he will not accept i esponsibility for what may follow. In the meantime he is restraining his own people. Baghdad reports that well-informed quarters state that Ibn baud, probably under pressure, has recently put himself openly at the head of the Ikhwan movement, whilst a telegram from the same source, dated May 12, states that Ibn baud is said to be confronting the Sherifian force near Khurma with 12,000 followers, chiefly Ikhwan. Stop Press News. In a letter dated May 5 to the Political Officer, Bahrein, Ibn baud complained that a Sherifian force had attacked Neid tribesmen (place and date not given) taking 200 camels from them. ° Emir Abdullah lias reported to the King that, on May 21 after two and a half hours’ fighting he captured Taraba; that button ibn liija.d had arrived at Khurma with Ikhwan reinforce ments; and that after consolidating Taraba, he (Abdullah) would proceed to Khurma. v ■ 28 the n Kin g received a ’etter from Taif report ing that Ikhwan under Khalid, attacked Abdullah at Taraba about midnight May 26-27 and drove him out. Abdullah is said to have got away with 500 mounted men only and to have eached Kulakh (4o miles east of Taif), whence he will move to Okacher It is thought at Mecca that the whole of Abdullah’s regular force, including guns and machine guns, was destroyed.

IbnRashid did not, however, join the Emirs near Medina and was reported by the Political Officer, Zobl^i, who met him early in April, to be approaching Basrah (April 9, 1919) with an offer of submission. Later (April 17), he was stated to have reached Abu Ghar (two days west of Khamasiyah—90 miles \\ . by K from Basrah) with about 100 men, and although he appears to be making overtures to the Iracj Administration, he is said to have sent menacing letters to Dhami of Aslam and other lessei Sheikhs of the Shammar who deserted him and established nominally friendly relations with us during the war. Messengers from Ibn Rashid were reported on April 17, 1919, en route for Baghdad. n At his meeting with the Political Officer Zobadtvi, Ibn Rashid stated that Ibn Sand tried three times to make peace with him and succeeded at the last attempt. _ It seems possible, therefore, and especially ii the news ot his somewhat unexpected rapprochement with Ibn Saud is correct, that the proposed agreement between the King and Ibn Rashid has not eventuated, possibly owing to a refusal by H use in to restore the villages and pay the subsidy, and that Ibn Rashid is about to become yet another Arab chief demanding the inevitable subsidy from the fountain-head. Latest News. Another of Ibn Rashid’s political flirtations is reported (May 16) from Damascus. An emissary has arrived there with a letter, addressed to the British Military Governor and Shent Feisul, in which Ibn Rashid proposes a reconciliation and professes a readiness to obey orders. Yemen. The surrender of the Turkish forces in Yemen and Asir has been completed. The total numbers evacuated are 714 officers, 9 032 other ranks, 205 male civilians, 1,030 women and children. ’ An Abyssinian named Ismail Effendi, “ El Aswad, recently in the Turkish service, was interviewed by Colonel Jacob at Aden. He stated that Sheikh Mohammed Nasir Muqbil of Mawiyah (see p. 32 of this volume) was only powerful so long as the Turks were in occupation, that he has no great influence now and is undecided whether to follow or oppose the Imam. In the opinion of Ismail Effendi, the most influential person m the Yemen, of the Shawafi, is Sheikh Mohammed Hassen of the Shadhilia cult (see p. 341, volume 1918), a very holy man and much revered by all Shawafi. He is far stronger than Mohammed Nash* Muqbil or Seyyid Ahmed Pasha of Taiz. Ismail Effendi, who- has held official posts in the Yemen tor 20 years and was recently offered the position of Kaimmakam of Taiz by the Imam Yahya, considers the latter to be the strongest Imam, although he is disliked for his meanness.Reports from various sources show that Ismail Eft'eudi received orders from the Turkish C.-in-C. in the Yemen to proceed to Mokha with his men, but lie went to Lahej and surrendered. He also refused to hand over his munitions to the Seif el Islam, Ahmed ibn el Qasim, who had been deputed by the Imam to receive them. He gave some arms to Seyyid Ahmed Pasha and the Sheikhs of Jebel Sabar. An Abdali correspondent reports that after the departure of the Turks under Ismail Effendi, the Arabs of Sabar cut off the water supply from the town of Taiz on account of the misdeeds of Zeidi soldiers there, and that, in consequence, Seyyid Ahmed Pasha and the Seif el Islam were obliged to move the soldiers to A1 Genadia. Attitude of the Imam. The Imam sent a letter (February 9, 1919) to the Political Resident, Aden, in which he deprecated the latter’s action in returning his envoys to Hodeidah without granting them an interview (cf. p. 27), and endeavoured to justify his action in addressing other Powers. He renewed his overtures for an understanding with the British Government. Mohammed el Tmeiri reported that the Imam is following a conciliatory policy towards the Lower Yemen and intends to xetain the chiefs in their present position provided they pay him tithes. El Umeiri further said that the Shafei sheikhs, having no one on whom to depend for support, were showing signs of submission to the Imam. Seyyid Mohammed Tahar of Jebel Jibaf reports that, with the exception of 50 men, all Zeidis have left Qatabah for Yadhira. Haj Lutf, a merchant from Sanaa, who recently arrived at Aden with a letter of recommendation from the Imam, stated that, when he left Sanaa at the end of February, all Turkish troops were leaving, but Mahmud Nadim Pasha, Yali of Yemen, and a few civilians, intended to remain. Mahmud Yadim is said to have much influence over the Imam. Other principal advisers of the Imam are :— Abdullah el Amri. | ^ Sanaa Arab who acts as secretary I and has great influence. Abdullah j One of the Imam’s family who acts as ibn Ibrahim. | Wazir. {See p. 199, vol. 1917.) Seyyid Kasim | Visited Ali Said Pasha at Lahej to el Azzi (or Aziz). ) induce him to go up country to ( secure the Turkish munitions. Seyyid Said Abbas. | Of Imamic house of El Mahdi. . —naj imtt was of opinion that the Imam Yahya is very anxious to get possession of the Tihamah and Lower BHtish’Pr t ! UO l t m w ^ 6 { mam wishes to encroach on the itish Protectorate. He further expressed the opinion that ifMail mild Nadim were removed from Sanaa, there would be no further difficulty in arriving at a settlement with the Imam, whose Arab advisers are not all anti-British. Haj Lutf stated that the Imam issues no documents of an anti-British nature:. (See letter from Imam to Mohammed ibn Yahya el Ahdal, p. 68 of this number.) The Italian, Giuseppe Caprotti, who lived at Sanaa, has now left and Haj Lutf heard that he intends to open a business at Hodeidah. There are now no Europeans at Sanaa. The Political Officer, Hodeidah, has received news that the Imam notified all Arabs that any Turkish Government stores which they may purchase will be confiscated by him. Ghalib Bey is said to have sold 1,200 spare rifles to Arabs at 25 dollars each and to have appropriated a quarter of the proceeds as a set off against his arrears of salary. Reports have come to hand that the Imam sent delegates to the seyyids and sheikhs of the Tihamah with a view to inducing them to accept his domination, but the visits appear to have been fruitless, and the Zaraniqs, Abus, Quhrah and other sheikhs applied to the Political Resident, Aden, for assistance against the Imam, which was declined, though a gift of 10,000 rounds of ammunition for the Zaraniqs and Abus was approved for defensive purposes only, our policy being to discouiage fighting. The Imam appears to be using propaganda and other pacific means to extend his rule over the Tihamah and Lower Yemen, but there is no indication of his employing force against the tribes of these districts. He has occupied Qatabah on the border of our Protectorate, but, in spite of constant rumours of a Zeidi advance on Dhala, he has so far abstained from interfering with places within our Protectorate boundary. Farther north he is met by the influence of the Idrisi, who occupies Zeidiyah. Writing to the Idrisi on April i last, the Political Resident, Aden, expressed pleasure that Loheiyah, Zohra, Zeidiyah and other places are at last in friendly hands, but warned him to refrain from occupying Salif or places south of Zeidiyah, as the permanent ownership of territory taken from the enemy must be left until the final settlement of boundaries. The Idrisi, in his reply, implied that his troops have already entered Said at the request of the Sheikhs, with a view to maintaining order between the tribesmen and to prevent the theft of salt, but, he added, “the acquisition of territories shall necessarily remain for your decision.” The departure of the Turkish garrisons has to spine extent weakened the position of the Imam in the Zeidi districts. A fight is reported between Saleh ibn Saleh el lairi, Sheikh of Radaa, and one of the Imam’s miiqaddams who was collecting tithes in Juban and Nawa. -i • i j A letter was recently received at Aden from Seyyid Ahmed ibn Yehia of Kibs, fomerly Yemen member of Ottoman Par- Tiament for Sanaa, advocating the claims of Seif el Islam Moi-HIM ‘ i. ' I in - — 66 — hannoed el Mutavvakkil Muhsin, which claims, the writer says, are supported by the Hashid and Bekil, the.Sheikhs of Ebb and Udein, as well as by the Idrisi. The Political Resident, Aden, is of opinion that this scheme is being promoted by the Idrisi and has heard that a visit to the latter is to be made by Mohammed Muhsin’s son. Previous overtures by Mohammed Muhsin a few months ago were disregarded by General Stewart, who states that this Seif el Islam is married to a daughter of the Bekil Sheikh, Nasir ibn Mabkhut, whilst one of his daughters is the wife of the Imam and another that of the latter’s son. (Since the foregoing was written, the Resident, Aden, has telegraphed (April 30) that Seyyid Ahmed ibn Yahya travelled to Aden to demand assistance for his scheme, the idea being to put up Mohammed el Mutawakkil until a suitable Imam can be found. The Idrisi is stated to have written in support of the plot, by means of which his control is to be extended to the Lower Yemen. Our policy being not to interfere with internal affairs of the Imamate, General Stewart proposes to refuse our assistance. C A Abdali Affairs. All British troops have been withdrawn from Abdali territory. Dar el Amir and Helwan have been restored to the Abdali Sultan. All Abdali refugees, except one or two families, have now returned to Lahej. The Abdali Sultan and several of the Subehi Sheikhs re cently visited Aden and an agreement between the Government and the Abdali, placing the Subehis under the supervision of the latter, was concluded. A British cavalry patrol was recently fired at in the Subehi village of Am Rija and the Sheikh of the village was therefore conveyed to Aden, where he is being kept as a political prisoner. The railway from Sheikh Othman has been completed to half a mile beyond Lahej, and is being continued to Hubil. The facilities it provides appear to be much appreciated by the inha bitants. Fadli Affairs. following the visit of the Fadli Sultan, Husein ibn Ahmed, to Aden (p. 32), the Political Resident wrote to him offering to put upon him and of his infirmities, on condition that he should, firstly, recognize his grandson, Sultan Abdul Qadir, as his heir ^ secondly, arrange that his relatives and tribesmen should also recognize the succession ; and thirdly, stop the activities of his son Abdullah. After some evasion, Husein complied, and Abdul Gadir has since visited Aden with a document in which the former recognizes his grandson as heir, in whose hands he places— 67 administration whilst he remains Sultan. His stipend therefore, has been restored from the date of his re-subm^ion to us The chronic dispute between the Ahl Fadl and the Yafa ip 435 of volume 1917), over irrigation m Abyan, nas recommenced since the departure of the lurkish post Both sides have been invited to visit Aden m order to submit the quarrel to arbitration, and the Fadh has agreed to do so t is, however, considered doubtful whether a solution of this lo g standing dispute will be found.

Several other Hajariyah Sheikhs have visited Aden in the hope of receiving presents and support. They include the Sheikhs of the Yusufiyin, Abus, MiTnari, Qabati, Za'zad, Shawafi, Maktari and Aghbari. All were treated politely, but no commitments were made with any of them. They are outside our Protectorate, and our future policy with regard to them is still undecided. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan ihn Sinan and Sheikh Abdullah ibn Abdid Wahab. I hese two Sheikhs from Lower Yemen, who paid prolonged visits to Aden in the hope of obtaining our support and material assistance, have been told that the Government is not prepared to give them munitions. They have been given money presents. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan is now at Jebel Habeshi in the Taiz. district. He is a religious leader of some importance, and was very hostile to the Turks, as he now is to the Imam. Sheikh Abdullah Abdul \Y ahab of Ibb was with difficulty persuaded to leave Aden without arms. He also professes to be strongly opposed to the Imam. Idrisi. A separate article by Captain N. W. Clayton on the evacuation of Asir appears in this number. The Idrisi has been allowed to retain the arms of the Turks who were on his borders. He has occupied Loheiyah, Zohra, Mur and other places. The Political Resident, Aden, has forwarded three letters handed to him by Seyyid Mustafa el Idrisi at the end of March last. These communications, apparently genuine, were intended to promote Imamic interests in the Zeidiyah district against the mT 1 ' AT 0 -,? f th rS m w er G ad &lt;h’essed by the Imam Yahya and all mud Nadim, Turkish Governor of the Yemen, respectively, to Mohammed ibn Yahya El-Ahdal (of Munirah), a member of the ruhng house of Seyyids in the district between Beit el Faqih and Zeidiyah. a The Imam wrote (February 26, 1919) that “Moslems in Hadhramaut, Aden, Hodeidah, Kunfidah, Lahej, etc., have fallen under the rale of the infidels, and foreigners are now competing to lay their hands on the Yemen.” He further declared that he was doing his utmost to preserve the Yemen country and its people from alien domination, and had ordered a force to the fort who 'T h ;f h } k iad beeu occupied by troops of the Idrisi, who, he added is but a servant of the Christians.” bitter ffiT' 1 Na u m ’f letter wa s similar in purpose but more AhT I wnnl J 1 H 11 10p f d , Seyyid Moha *nmed ibn Yahya el tl - wn • n0t a °r the ka fi rs to defiIe tb e blessed country through their agent, the Idrisi, and advised him to carry out the Imam s instructions carefully. ^ 1 C69 The third letter was one from Seyyid Mohammed ibn Yahya transmitting the other two to the Idrisi for perusal, and suggesting that the latter, in addition to sending sufficient troops for the more effective occupation of Zeidiyah, should also take steps to prevent intrigue there. In forwarding the letters, the Political Resident, Aden, states that Zeidiyah is in the hands of the Idrisi, by whom their opportune receipt is being used in justification of his action. Abyssinia. It appears that the report of Lij \ asu’s death (see page ^73, volume 1918) was false, for the Commissioner, Berbera, reports (March 10, 1919) that the Ethiopian Government planned, early in March, an expedition against the Danakil chief who was harbouring him in the Aussa country. Lij asu is said to have increased his influence over the Danakil by means of mairiages with their daughters and was thus inducing them to refuse recognition of Abyssinian authority and to neglect payment of tribute. , . The troops, however, refused to join a campaign in the low country and the objective of the expedition was therefore changed to the restoration of order in the provinces of Yedju and Lasta, where the change of government has not been recognized since the 1917 revolt. „ , . , u There are now frequent instances of the impotence ot the Government, and no chief or tribe will obey any order which does not suit them. As the troops are disinclined to^ undertake military operations, the authorities have no means of enforcing obedience and are compelled to confine themselves to publishing proclamations which are universally ignored. . An Intelligence report from Nairobi states that altairs in Abyssinia at the end of last year were in a chaotic condition and became worse owing to an outbreak of influenza. Has laftan appears to have lost considerably in prestige and was being blamed for the various epidemic outbreaks, the high prices of food, and the brigandage on the caravan routes. Definite signs are said to have appeared of a revolutionary movement against the Empress and Ras Taffari, in favour of Fitaurari Taye (whose name has previously been associated with the position of Prince Regent). On the other hand, European intervention has been openly discussed and it is even thought, in some quarters, that Ras Taifari may be awaiting an opportunity of inviting the protecting powers to take an active part in the administration of Abyssinia. . ' A telegram dated May 2 has been received from Khartoum o-iving intelligence reports from sources, not considered too reliable, at Gedaref and Gallabat. Ras Seyyum was said to be at Makalle, whilst Ras Gugsa had made some arrangement with theruler of Wog’era, and Ras Kassa was | atrolling the Eritrean frontier, where he was fighting a band of 100 Italian deserters. Lij Yasu, with some Europeans and a force possessing guns and machine guns, was reported to have arrived at either Adah or Danakil with the intention of advancing on Addis Abbaba. The general situation early in May was, according to the reports, that Ras Seyyum was aiming at the throne, assisted by forces inferior to those of the Government but possessing more rifles, including many of Italian pattern captured from Has Selassye. He was said to have the support of the local chiefs and had with him 15 or 20 Dejaz (General-Governors). It was thought that Ras Kassa would probably lend him support but not Ras Gugsa. However, as cultivation was due to commence in twenty days, no immediate action of any kind was anticipated. ^ A telegram from Addis Abbaba (April 25) states that three different missions from that place left on April 24 for England, France and Italy respectively. The mission to England, which is said to have an autograph letter from the Empress to the King and also a statement of the “ Abyssinian Demands,” is composed Dejazmach (General-Governor) Nado, Ato (Mr.) Herui, Kantibar (Governor or Viceroy) Gafurn, and intends to visit America after a short stay in London. Dejazmach Nado has previously travelled in France and byria (p. 40, Abyssinian Personalities). The names Herui and Galurn are possibly telegraphic corruptions ; the latter may be antibar Gabrou (p. 22, Abyssinian Personalities), who met the Lake Isano mission and is known to have visited England twice and to speak our language fluently. Late Ne7.cs. A telegram from Addis Abbaba, dated May 12, states that a reconciliation has been effected between Ras Taffari and the Minister of War, but it is believed to be merely artificial and temporary.

I have been several times lately asked for figures of camel- journeys, both for speed and for endurance, and no doubt therefore the following notes on the subject will be of interest. In all cases she-camels only are concerned. For speed, the best performance I know was the 89 hours’ ride of Sherif Barakat ibn Smeiyah, from Medina to Mecca, by the Rabegh road a few years ago. It was a race, and camels were changed at Rabegh, 154 miles from Medina. The total distance works out at about 280 miles, and it was covered practically without a stop, except for the few minutes at Rabegh. The average speed was thus over seven miles per hour. A race of this sort is a test of the man’s endurance, rather than that of the camel. Another equally fine ride was that of Aissa, a Haib tribesman, who came from Zilfi in Qasim to Yenbo in three days, and returned to Zilfi in four more, making a total of seven days for the round trip of 900 miles, an average of 130 miles a day. Aissa used four camels. ' Rides on single camels are more interesting as records. One of the Atram family of Fitenna Abu Tayi Howeitat, on a home-bred pedigree camel, rode between sunset and sunset from Nebk abu Gasr to Bair and defer, a distance of 143 miles. He rested in defer one day and returned on the third day to Nebk on the same camel. I owned this camel some years later, and found by experience that it would keep up a comfortable and steady trot of seven and a half miles per hour for hour after hour without special urging : but 1 never had need to do a trotting journey of greater length than from Rum to Akaba (39 miles) on it. ^ It did this in a little under five hours, carrying a good deal of kit besides myself. Mesnid, a Sherari, took a message from defer to Akaba for me. He left defer at noon, and returned with the reply two days later at noon, doing 220 miles, and his errand also, in the 48'hours. He rode a Sherari four-year-old. The fast time for a camel postman from Medina to Mecca is three days. This is an average of about 9o miles a day. With one servant I rode from Azrak through defer, Shedia, and Rum to Akaba (290 miles) in three days and a half. This is an average of about 84 miles a day. We rode Beni Sakhr 11) 6 Is One of the Harith Sherifs of Modhig rode from Akaba to Mecca in nine days. The total distance is about 690 miles, which gives him an average of 77 miles a day. He rode a Sherarfcamel, and the trip is one of the finest I have heard of. Exceptional performances of this sort cannot be expected of the ordinary camel in ordinary condition. When riding ghazzuIf? j : ' ' i wjtb the Howeitat ur Beni Sakhr I found that for long journeys camels were never permitted to trot, since it interrupts the chances of grazing on the march. They do a steady walk of nearly four miles an hour, and keep this up for from sixteen to twenty hours daily, giving them an average mileage of from 64 to 80 miles. The smaller of these distances can be counted on as an average for perhaps ten or twelve days. For a month’s riding day by day, it would be unwise to expect more than 50 miles a day from a camel in good condition. Weak camels cannot be expected to do more than about 40 miles a day average. W ith strong camels my experience has been that the man gives in sooner than the camel. My longest month was 1,400 miles, and I found it very difficult. A bad or inexperienced rider will wear out a camel very quickly. Arabs mostly ride light, about jeight or nine stone, and their clothes and kit are usually less than we can do with. I carried little, and yet managed to use twice as many camels as my men. For a disciplined camel corps, forty miles a day is a fair march, and that this average was passed for three days on end by Colonel Buxton’s column of I.C.C. when going north from Bair speaks very well for the riders and the animals. The latter (and indeed the former) were all male, were all unaccustomed to desert conditions, and were carrying heavy loads. A column marching in the Arab formation of small independent groups of ten or twelve will make better way than a column that tries to keep in regular line. An Arab party of 20 men (my servants) marched once with all their kit from Abu el Lissan to Akaba (60 miles) in just over five hours, as the last stage of a journey ol five 50-mile marches. The camels were all fit to start the next day. Needless to say they were all pushing their camels on this last occasion. A stripped camel, racing, will do something like twenty miles an hour for nearly two hours. For a short hurst I have timed them trotting at 22 and cantering at 26 miles per hour. T.E.L. i . The performances described by Colonel Lawrence are ex ceptional ones made on the best camels. During my experience in the southern Hejaz I found that either the incentive had to he very strong, or the remuneration most lavish, to induce a Bedou to cover more than 30 or 40 miles a day. The fastest rate oi ic Emir s neggabs from Mecca to the Arab camps on the outskirts of Medina, and from the camps to the coast at Yenbo, was oO miles a day, but the payment worked out at £2 10s. Un pids, the rate of progress was generally 15 miles a dav and never more than 25 This was done at walking pace anil the Bedomn intensely disliked travelling more than eight hours out ot the twenty-four, or more than three hours without rest. It was my experience that for endurance in camel riding thouoh not fori speed the Britisher could easily outstrip^ the Bedou, and during my different journeys my Arab companions were, in every case, the first to suggest halting for rest. The camels of the southern Hejaz are, in general, poor beasts and ten hours’ continuous marching as a rule exhausts them. 1 have known several cases where the mounts of postmen, aftei doing the trip from Yenbo to the Emirs’ camps and back (about 200 miles) in 5 days, have simply dropped dead at the end of the journey. Baggage caravans march at the rate of about two miles an hour only, and to accompany such a caravan is probably the most tiring and uncomfortable form of travelling that exists. The camels are tied together in a long string and trav ®J during the night only. A march generally extends to i*' 1 hours. Except for the man on the leading camel, the Arabs arrange comfortable places on which to lie down on top of the camel loads and sleep the whole night. Gf. II AULA NO. Corrigendum.

The term “Hadhramaut” is now used, incorrectly though universally, as designating, not only the Wadi Hadrarnaut, hut also the southern littoral of Arabia from Wadi el Hajar to Saihut, and thence, inland, all the country up to and including the great wadi itself. Along the sea fringe the towns of Mokalla and Shehr are held by the Kaiti, an offshoot of the great Yafa confederacy further west. These Kaiti, despatched some three quarters of a century ago from the YAfa country to rescue their fellow clansmen, who were then hard pressed by the victorious Kathiri, have monopolised the ports. By their intrigues and wealth they have undermined the power of the Kathiris. These factors, combined with their undoubted fighting stamina, gradually won them the support of the great Seiban tribe. The combination thus formed defeated and absorbed the Amudi tribes, overwhelmed the Nahdis, allied itself with the Awabthah, and checked the Humumis. Thus, at the outbreak of the European war, the Kaiti Sultan in Mokalla found himself master of the coast and overlord of the Seiban and Awabthah country, with a free line of communication through Wadi DoAn to his own fortresses of Hajarein, Haurah, Qatari and Shibam. From Shibam he faced the Kathiris, now hemmed into their old centres : Ghurfah, Gifl, Teris, Saiwun, and Terim. East of the Kathiris, Kaiti intrigue had gained the good will of the Tamimi and of the warlike Manahil. Of the old allies of the Kathiri tribes there remained only the Hamumis. Thus, Hadhramaut to outside eyes now shows Kaiti and Kathiri. For three centuries it has had to look to the outside world for sustenance. From it a stream of emigration flowed surely and steadily to the East. In Java were established the foundations of an Arab colony which now numbers some 20,000 persons, nearly all men, and chiefly Kathiri. The last century has witnessed the departure of many Kaiti traders to Singapore, while Hyderabad, Bombay, Suez, Jibuti and, more recently, Mombasa and Egypt, have all become havens for these energetic emigrants. The emigrant communities prospered greatly : Surabaya and Singapore have their Arab millionaires, whilst Hyderabad supports a Kaiti regiment. Mokalla itself is second only to Aden as the trade emporium of southern Arabia. Hadhramaut therefore is not without importance beyond its own boundaries, but before further considering this point it is necessary to consider the local political position of the Kaiti and Kathiri. For reasons which we need not now recapitulate, His Majesty’s Government decided to support the Kaiti in their claim to Mokalla and Shehr. The Kathiri, while never paying tribute nor accepting a Turkish Wali, had always posed as— 76 — Turkish subjects. I he K.iiti, on the other hand, had consistently supported the British cause, and this support was founded on cordial agreement and treaties. During the war, Said Ali Pasha ou more than one occasion vainly attempted to overawe the Kaiti Sultan into sending troops and providing supplies for the Turkish forces investing Lahej. Turkish envoys also reached the Kathiri in Wadi Hadhramaut, and it is a matter of some certainty that help of various kinds did reach the Turks from Kathiri sources. In these circumstances, and* bearing in mind the truculent attitude assumed- by the Kathiri, the Kaiti Sultan—Sir Ghalib ibn Awad ibn Omer, K.C.I.E.—sought for and obtained material aid in guns, rifles, and specie from His Majesty’s Government. Im a fight Outside the walls of Shibam the Kaiti proved victorious, and this defeat, coupled with the action of the British Government in withholding the usual money remittances sent by Kathiri emigrants in the Straits Settlements and Dutch East Indies to Saiwun, Qifl, Teris and Terim, induced the Kathiri leaders to make a change of policy, which, though no doubt merely skin deep, was none the less indicative of a possibility of better things. In these circumstances the two Kathiri Sultans—Mansur and Muhsin—ultimately signed a treaty, the main tenor of which was to the effect that the Kathiri, while preserving their independence, acknowledged the British as paramount protective power ; agreed to communicate with Aden only through the Kaiti Sultan ; deprecated further hostilities; and admitted the Kaiti’s claim to Mokalla, Shehr, the Wadi Do c an line, and Shibam. The Kaiti Sultan, on his side, agreed not to tax Kathiri imports and exports more heavily than similar Kaiti commodities, denied any intention of further aggression, and aspired to a prosperous Hadhramaut with British beneficent arbitration should cases for such arise (c/. pp. 233, 272, 341 of volume 1918). Thus the local surface appeared unruffled. But troubles were arising and continuing in the external matters of emigration and remittances. It was rightly felt that in view of the past' actions and of the known character of Kathiri policy, any immediate relaxation of the embargo on remittances might prove disastrous to the continuance of peace unless and until the Kathiri Sultans or their deputies should have accompanied the Kaiti Sultan to Aden, where both sides could discuss the whole question, past, present, and future, with our Political Resident. In the matter of emigrants, the difficulties were greater. I o compress the point to the narrowest limits, it may be said that in Java, where the Arab (i.e. the Kathiri) element exercises a profound influence over the teeming millions of Moslem population, His Majesty’s Government, for various reasons, had desired to win over Moslem sentiment to the British side, not as against Dutch rule, but as opposed to the Germano-Turkish- Arab actixities which assumed so large an importance during theyears 1915-1918. Unfortunately, the German propaganda had so great a temporal start that, backed as it had been by material allurements, many leading Arabs under its influence had assumed an active and, to British interests, sinister participation in the great Javanese society, Sarikat Islam. (See page 460, vol. 1917). With these obstacles in their path, and confronted with Arabs further annoyed by the fact that their home remittances to the Wadi Hadhramaut were being held up in Singapore, Bombay, and Aden, those to whom His Majesty’s Government had en trusted the work of conciliating Arab feeling in the Dutch Indies found in this commission a problem of some difficulty. However, by the end of the summer of 1918, Arab feeling in Java had veered round in the desired direction, and this change, coupled with the completion of the Hadhramaut treaty, to which reference has already been made, seemed to point to a solution of the-hitherto vexed Kaiti-Kathiri position. The suggested visit to Aden on the part of the Kathiri Sultans, however, was for one reason or another continually being postponed, and a feeling had arisen that the treaty was not so stable iu reality as it appeared to be on paper. The great Hamumi tribe also—the sole remaining powerful anti-Kaiti element beside the Kathiris—had not only sent its lead ing chiefs to urge the Kathiris to refuse the treaty proposals, but had added sting to its hatred by continual pillaging of Kaiti caravans in the neighbourhood of Quseir, Shehr, and Ghail Ba Wazir. It was decided, therefore, that a visit to the Kaiti and Kathiri Sultans should be made by a British officer, in order to ascertain the actual local position as it was—as djstinct from what it might appear to be—and also to warn the Kathiris of a new danger which had recently arisen in the Dutch East Indies. °This danger was as 'follows. As has been pointed out, the Germano-Turkish-Arab activities in Java had led to a number of leading Arabs participating in the Sarikat Islam Society. This participation took, nominally, a religious form under the oaiise of the Tentara Kandjang Nabi Muhammad (The Army of the Prophet). In reality it betokened an anti-Dutch seditious political movement, on the hackneyed lines of “ The Indies for the Indians,” and “Asia for the Asiatics.” In addition to this, certain Javanese'Arabs, convinced of the coming world-victory of (jrermano-Turkish arms, had also emphasised their status as being that of Turkish subjects. During the past decade the Dutch East Indies Government, whose Secret Service kept it au courant \\\t\\ these Arab activities, had been greatly troubled by the rise and spread of Sarikat Islam, the membership of which reaches a total of approximately one million Moslems. Not only the local militant Dutch Socialists, under the leadership of Sneevliet, but German, Japanese, and other alien influencials had attempted to ingratiate themselves with the so-called “Nationalist” movements in Java. It was thus natural that the Government, aware of the dangerous inter- r— 78 meddling of certain Arabs, and already in a state of extreme anxiety over the frequent and increasing outbreaks throughout the Dutch Indies, should strike whenever an opportunity occurred. In the case of the Arabs, a community which came from abroad, and which regularly sent its gains out of the country, decisive and sharp action appeared best. Accordingly, the Governor- General, Graf van Limburg Stirum, openly stated that the Arabs had no innate interest in the Indies and that, if they continued to interfere in politics, no further immigration would be per mitted. Cases occurred where the desired permissie for entry into Java was actually refused, and it became clear that, should the policy of refusal become the rule rather than the exception, a orave crisis would arise in the life of the Kathiris. ^ ... -r Curtailed emigration from Hadhramaut would mean fewer remittances from Javanese Arabs. The Wadi could not, as at present developed, support its population without the usual large remittances, nearly all of which came from its sons in Java. Thus discontent would grow in the Wadi ; money shortage would lead to food shortage, for which the only remedy, in Arab minds, lies in plunder; the only persons to be plundered would be the prosperous Kaiti and their allies ; and thus war would again break out in Hadhramaut. At the same time the Arabs in Java, as well as those at home in the Hadhramaut, would lay the blame for the whole matter on the British authorities, whose help they always claim, even though they had always repaid previous help and protection by base treachery during the war. Matters being in this condition, Hadhramaut was visited by the writer, in January 1919. The visit comprised a journey to Shibam (upon which a full report has been submitted) and an interview with the Kathiri Sultans in neutral territory at Huzn. Careful enquiry and observation led to the following conclusions. I he Kaiti and their allies are all contented, prosperous and only lightly taxed. The Kathiri tribes proper (Kathiri, Awamir, Jabiri) are discontented. The Kathiri Sultans, Mansur and Muhsin, with their Wazir, Saleh bin Aboud, are detested ; not only do they tax the townsfolk unmercifully, but their rapacity and their extortionate demands (backed by domiciliary visits of Abid or Somali slave-soldiers) have wholly alienated the seyyids and sheikhs. The Bedouin tribes on the fringe of the 'great Rub c el Khali are merely kept from pillage by money doles. ^The whole Kathiri portion of Wadi Hadhramaut is ready, and indeed eager, for a change of government. (Passing mention can only here be made of an open and visible sign of this in the “Jamaivat al-Hakk Society). (See page 436, volume 1917.) M adi Hadhramaut, if assured of peace under one stable government, could so be exploited as to provide sufficient food and fodder for the whole Hadhramaut population, settled as well as nomad in the widest sense. Indeed, exportation of food- stuirs might even be in time attained.TRIBAL SKETCH MAP of HADHRAMAUT (SHOWING ONLY THE NLVJN TRIBES OF FIGHTING VALUE)— 79 To assure such necessary peace* the present treaty is, however, wholly insufficient. To many minds the treaty was signed by the Kathin Sultans as a last resort, solely to save themselves. It contains no guarantees, and it is doubtful if the Kathiris in general know of its existence. Sultan Ghalib, the Kaiti Sultan, is prepared to undertake any expenditure on the irrigation and roadmaking necessary for the development of all the Wadi Hadhramaut. But until he is assured of peace, it would be folly to commence the work. Saye for the Kathiri Sultans themselves,_ their paid soldier- slaves (Somalis), and a few pro-Turkish families, the townsfolk of the Kathiri towns would welcome the development ot the Wadi by permanent irrigation and communications, under a settled and just government. Once peace were assured, money remittances need no longer beheld up. His Majesty’s Government could then proceed to the task of helping and controlling Kathiri emigrants, by addressing the Netherlands Government. In conclusion, it should be remembered:— (1) that the Kaiti Sultan is admittedly our ally ; that he has always been faithful; that he is ready to spend his large fortune on developing the whole country ; that Hadhramaut is not an exclusively Arab country in the same sense as, for example, the Hejaz ; and that Kaiti and Kathiri alike owe their fortunes to British protection ; (2) that in Hadhramaut an early and final settlement of troubles can now easily be made ; that, if put off, adjustment will become more and more difficult; that non-settlement will mean further calls for British subsidies ; and, finally, that discontent m Hadhramaut postulates discontent among the Arab communities of Singapore, Hyderabad, and Java. The sketch map opposite shows the location of tribes and towns referred to in the text. W. H. Lee- Warner. Arab Bureau Note. Since the above article was written, H.B.M. Consul, Batavia, has reported (March 29, 1919) that the local authorities recently issued confidential instructions that Arab immigrants from Hadhramaut are to be refused admittance to Java on the ground that they are usurers and, therefore, under the immigration laws, may be refused as undesirables. The Netherlands Government is to be asked to withdraw the restriction, as, if enforced, it would be injurious alike to Kathiri and Kaiti interests. H.B.M. Government has now issued orders for the removal of the embargo on Kathiri remittances [June 8, 1919].80 II ' i The following note has come to hand from Captain Lee- Warner since going to press :— “ The Hamumi tribe is not likely to be a political force of any moment for some time to come, as in January last the Kaiti, by a coup de main, captured and imprisoned over 200 of its members, including the head chief Habreish, and executed 23 other chiefs.” The Khurma Dispute. Pending the issue of a detailed account of the Khurma dispute, the following abridged statement, giving its origin and the major military incidents that have occurred in connection with it up to the present date, is published, at the risk of repeating information that has already appeared in the Bulletin, as a convenient, reference during the existing crisis. Ibn Saud. In 1915 a treaty was arranged between Emir Ibn Saud and H.B.M. Government, in which the latter recognized Ibn Saud as the independent sovereign of Nejd, El Hasa, Qatif and Jubail. It was a temporary agreement, made chiefly for reasons of military expediency after the expulsion of the Turks, and no definite boundaries of the territory were specified. Ikhwan. Although generally regarded as a new creation, the Ikhwan, or Brotherhood movement, is really a revival in an intensified form of Wahabism, an excellent account of which will be found on page 351 of our 1918 volume. The tenets of the Ikhwan creed are very similar to those of Wahabism, though its followers are without doubt more fanatical. To the non-Moslem, however, it is the brutal methods of effecting conversions and of punishing sinners, rather than the principles of the creed itself, that appear objectionable. Tiere is no doubt whatever that the Bedouin are systematicallv terrorized into conversion and that those who refuse are done to death. In war the Ikhwan are said to take no prisoners, but to cut the throats of all who fall into fhpir Uanrlc! tion wPh the Ikhwan movement in its early stages, and this is probably true; but it is sufficient for our present purposes o know : firstly, that the sect originated close by his own capital and was allowed to flourish there, and its leading mis sionaries are his own subjects ; secondly, that it is merely a fV ‘ K desperately fanatical edition of Wahabism, of which lie is the acknowledged leader ; and thirdly, that Ibn Sand has -c-tty put himself at the head of the movement and will certainly not fail to use it for furthering his own ends. . . For the purposes of this review, therefore it is unnecessary to differentiate between Ibn Saud and the Ikhwan, or e w the latter and the Wahabis. , . . „ Since the first appearance of the Ikhwan abou T ago, in the vicinity of the Nejd capital, Riadh it has made rapid progress, and its missionaries have penetrated to all corners of Arabia. But its doctrines are detested by all orthodox Moslems, and the rulers of the Arab States simound- i ng Nejd (especially King Husem) live m constant dread of ^^othttc^S of the Ikhwan, by the Political Officer, Basrah, appears in this number. Khurma Dispute. The mesent Khurma crisis has two causes, one religious, SiSSi ti, tion to stop Ikhwan sectarian propaganda m the Hejaz political cause is a dispute as to the actual ownership of the K “g Husein has put forward a very good case “ P r °°^ of his ownership of Khurma, and this, after muc received the support of H.B.M. Government; but Ibn Saud who bases his claims more upon the religious, and therefore (in Arabia) political, allegiance tf the population of the Mm district than on ownership ox the actual groun , ■ e ■ that dhe ouarrel should be submitted to our arbitration. ' “ The territorial dispute has its origin in the conversion^, Wahabism in 1914, of the King’s local representative at Khurma T sher f named Khalid, whom the King appointed Emir o Khurma before the war. By embracing Wahabism Khalid became a rebel and for four years the King appears to have taken no steps to rectify the position at Khurma or to col lee 1 taxes there In 19is, however, he sent tax gatherers, bu - t^ey were arrested by Khalid, who, realizing that h,s action meaht war, collected a scrap Bedouin force, with which he ejected all pro-Sherefian elements from Khurma. Military Incidents. In May 1918, the King drew our attention to Ibn Sand’s “ otmression and encroachment on tribes bound firmly to the Emirs of Mecca from ancient times,” and said that, inconsequence, i ’ i mJv k. Abdullah, and he is known by the writer to have made up his mind at that time to obtain his revenge as soon as an opportunity occurred ; he was itching to move Khurmawards in person. But although the King and Abdallah had been warned consistently by us to avoid aggressive acts or even an advance on Khurma, it must be emphasized that this policy of ours was dictated purely by military expediency and was decided upon in spite of our strong sympathy with the King’s claim to Khurma. It was realized that the Sheri bans could spare neither commanders, troops, nor guns from the forces which were besieging Medina, and further, that a big defeat at Khurma at that time would probably result in a disastrous re-action on the siege operations by heartening Fakhri Pasha and enabling him to come to some arrangement with Ibn Saud for the further defence of the city or for surrendering it to the Ikhwan. Little wjs done, however, by India to call off Ibn Saud or to order him to cease his anti-Sherifian propaganda amongst Hejaz tribes. The Indian view at that time was that it would be wrong for us to support the King in military action against our treaty ally, Ibn Sand, and it was not until March 1919 that a message was sent by H.M. Government to Ibn Saud “ advising him to modify his attitude and to persuade his followers from further opposition to the administrative measures of King Husein at Khurma.” i \ ^ The fall of Medina in January 1919 left Abdullah free to set out on his long-cherished expedition to Khurma, which, he had often prophesied, would be over with the complete destruc tion of Ibn Sand’s forces within two days of his (Abdullah's) arrival on the scene. It was feared by British advisers on both sides (Iraq and Egypt) that Abdullah’s ill-advised move must inevitably result in a collision of the rival forces, and it is quite probable that had Abdullah remained in Medina the present crisis would not have arisen. Indeed, had we been aware of the Emir’s actual warlike intentions we should no doubt have strongly protested against the advance, instead of merely suggesting the impropriety of it. Abdullah’s regular force consisted of 60 officers, 770 other ranks, 8 guns and 16 machine guns. It reached Asheirah early in April. As soon as he heard of Abdullah’s move from Medina, Ibn Saud began counter preparations. He certainly warned H.B.M. Government of these and, reasserting his wish for arbitra tion, stated that he was compelled by pressure of public opinion to take measures against aggression by the Sherifian troops. “ if the King and Abdullah will remain in their own places,”— 84 he said, “ I will remain in mine.” But although we looked upon Abdullah’s advance as unwise and foolhardy, and advised him not to start, we do not, and cannot, deny his right to occupy Khurma. The next military incidents were the raid by Ikhwan on loyalists at Degheibjah early in May, 1919, and the two attacks by Abdullah s patrols on Ikhwan parties, • described on page 61 of our last number. Of these affairs we have not yet received reports from Ibn Sand’s side. On May 21, Abdullah reported that, after two and a half hours’ fighting, he occupied Tarabah, and that, after consolidating it, he would advance to Khurma (see page 62 of last number). In that report Abdullah stands self-condemned. He had obviously scrapped his defensive policy, and doubtless decided to take ,ae Ikhwan raid on Degheibjah as his excuse for an attack on larabah. Abdullah also reported the arrival in person of Ibn Saud at feakkhah (eighty miles N.E. of Khurma). We may be sure that if Ibn Saud does not deny that the khwan raid on Degheibjah ever took place, he certainly will assert that it was not done at his instigation and was, therefore an ordinary tribal raid for which he cannot be held responsible’ in, rf 1 A May 25 ' 26 ’ the IkIwan under Emir hhalid attacked Abdullah at Tarabah, driving him out and ■Z°lu n f t0 SeVera ' aCC0 T ts ’ destr °yed his regular force, captur- wi&gt;h hn SU11S , t maCl T gUnS ' Emir Abdullah got away AMulhb’ g a men ° nl y’ and retired *0 Okheidir force at Kelatw T SllCTlf Sharaf, had a small which tteblk 1 * (a I 0U n T enty - five milesE - b y N - of Tarabah), Shlraf fterw'“l 1 d f daWn ° n May 26 ’ but were re P ulsed - Sharat afterwards decided to join Abdullah at Okheidir The rsrr txzt probably to ^ Khurma th to th Ta?f eStrU ° ti0n 4 AbduIIah ’ s a ™y the road from Jeddah lav it t l *° the enemy ' Mecca a ' d even Emir Ali could n n , leuy tbe t ana tical Ikhwan.

Abdullah’s regular witT I S of war service h i rsTi, 61 ,*''' 0 &amp; half years ’ ex P CT ience service it has failed when put to its first crucial test,— 85 — and, although, heavily equipped with guns and machine guns, it apparently failed to put up any sort of a fight against an untrained enemy armed only with rifles. Later reports from Jeddah confirm the completeness ot Abdullah’s defeat at Tarabah. According to a telegram sent by the King to Emir Feisal, the “ martyrs {i.e., Shenfian killed) amounted to 250, including several Ateibah sheikhs and also Seyyid Hilmi, who was Abdullah’s Major-General Command ing the so-called “ division ” of regular troops. Emirs Abdullah and Shakir were themselves slightly wounded, all guns and machine guns and two-thirds of the supplies were lost, and only one-tenth of the mule mounted infantry got away. It is worthy of note that, although they had had previous warning of the night attack, the regular officers who got away did so in their night attire. It was ever one of the Baghdadi officer’s maxims not to allow military duties to interfere wi his night’s rest, and during the war, outposts, picquets, and tke like were invariably dispensed with by the Arab armies m e ^ The 10 000 Bedouin originally reported to be with Abdullah seem to have melted away, and, as Colonel Bassett remarks “ everything points to the majority of the tribal elements which profess allegiance to King Husein being absolutely unreliable. A consoling feature is that the captors of the guns, etc have no followers trained in their manipulation and employment In spite of the King’s assertion that Ibn Sand reinforced Tarabah and Khurma, with a view to attacking Abdullah, no enemy advance from Tarabah is reported Abdullah accord ing to the King, is now “ remaining on the defensive, but both he and the King fear an advance by Ibn Sand on laif and Mecca. It is thought, however, that Ibn Sand will probibh now rest content with his success and his reoccupation of larabali. He has common-sense enough to realize that any further advance towards the Hejaz cities would mean sacrificing our friendship, subsidy and help, and he must realize that we possess the means to punish him, even if he knows the King does not. It seems probable that' H.B.M. Government’s orders to withdraw from Tarabah will have the desired effect when he gets them. The fact that the Ikhwan have not.advanced from larabali since they recaptured it tends to show that Ibn Sand has them under some sort of control, and if the more fanatical elements had intended to raid Taif without his authority they would surely have moved towards it by this time. The military position at Khurma to-day (June 10, 1919), Ibn Saud is said to be at Tarabah and his force probably86 — amounts to 20,000 Bedouin, of which some are posted ten miles west of Tarabah. Emir Abdullah has collected from his original force a remnant of about 3,000 Bedouin at Okheidir. Two hundred and fifty semi-trained regulars have left Mecca under Sagh. Kaisuni (Minister of War), to join the Emir, whilst Emir Ali at Medina is reported to be sending some machine guns and ammunition. Stop Press News. H. Gr. In spite of many Bedouin rumours that Ibn Sand and the Ikhwan intended to occupy Mecca, no military incidents have occurred since the Sherifian defeat at Tarabah. Ibn Saud was ordered by His Majesty’s Government to withdraw from Khurma, and informed that his request for arbitration would be granted. He is now reported moving eastward towards Riadh. Mr. Philby is being sent from London to commence negotiations, and meanwhile we are advising the King not to move east of the line Taif-Asheirah. The Ikhwan. A Note, compiled by the A.P.O., Basrah, on the Ikhwan, and dated April last, states that the movement first appeared some eight or twelve years ago, probably in the vicinity of Riadh. Like all newly formed sects it is animated with a very strong spirit of fanaticism and, for that reason, is regarded with fear by the tribes and sheikhs round about Zubeir. Being, at its outset, hostile towards the Sherif, it was encouraged by Ibn Saud, and, after spreading around Riadh, its supporters attempted to establish a colony in Hail, but Ibn Rashid forbade this, and has ever since followed the same policy, with the result that, except for a few converts in one sub-tribe situated on his bordei, there are no Ikhwan sectarians amongst his people. . The A - P -0., Basrah, states that all Ibn Sand’s tribes are tainted with Ikhwanism; the Muteir, the Ateibah, and the Harb include large proportions of adherents, whilst the Dawasir and the Sebei have smaller numbers. Feisal ibn Darwish Sheikh of the Muteir, is the leading spirit of the movement’ and even the people of Koweit are gradually joining. At Zubeir ikhwan converts are appearing in increasing numbers, much to the alarm of Sheikh Ibrahim (of Koweit), and many a Bedou entering the town to replenish his supplies boasts that he has joined the new sect. Contrary to our information from previous sources, the •P.O., Basrah, asserts that the Ikhwan have passed beyond m g ri ^ — 87 — Ibn Sand’s control, although they were fostered by him m the early days of the movement, and says further that the prevailing idea amongst the Bedouin is that Ibn Sand will either disappear or will be compelled to follow the movement, m spite o± t e fact that it is directed against us. The Note proceeds :— “ It is reported that the Ikhwan repoached Ibn Sand for his lack of religious fervour and especially for dealing with the British Government, and the answer he is supposed to have given shows how weak his position is. ‘ I have been obliged, he said, ‘ to side with the British in order to strengthen my own position but later on, should the British give you cause for rising again them, I will be with yon. ^ i-Up QWif “ Ibn Rashid’s messengers say that, had not t assured himself of Ibn Rashid’s help, he would have been attacked by now The Sherif, as a result of this alliance has been supp y- ing foodstuffs to Ibn Rashid, and has lately asked him for 2,000 C am«is^ch are being^supplied^tbu^t of Ikhwan fanaticism amongst the Muteir. Feisal, their chief, with the Muten Ikhwan, invited all non-Ikhwan to join the sect on penaRy of de ^ and actually killed four Muteir tribesmen who reteed Je invitation. This created a stampede, part of the Mnteir fleeing to Koweit and Bahrein for safety, others going over to lb Rashid to claim his protection. ■ “ Fear of the Ikhwan is spreading and the Aslam under Dhari ibn Tawalah and the Dhafir under Hamud es Suwait are feeling anxious. The feeling of uneasiness has jrea^ to the marshes and Sayed Jabir remarked to me *tat the Ikhw would gladly exterminate the Maadans if they had the chance. “ Sheikh Ibrahim stated that Ibn Rashid ^s the rallying point of those tribes opposed to the Ikhwan, and tha i w0 be wise for us to come to an understanding with him and use h and his tribes as buffers between Iraq and the Ikhwans. Une of the Ikhwan in battle is worth five Bedus, for he is prepared to give up his life for the cause. News of Ikhwan activity around Koweit is also contained in a report, dated April 20, from the Poprcal Agent, Koweit This officer confirms that Feisal el Darwish, Chief Sheikh of the Muteir, has now become organizer of the movement whic is taking up vigorously with the alleged intention of gathering a sufficient force to establish himself on the Nejd thr ° n ®, it is even hinted that his aspirations may not, end there I Political Agent adds, however, that towards the end of Ap the excitement at Koweit due to the Ikhwan had died down. A88 — Medina. A .—The Surrender Conditions The terms under which the surrender of Medina was carried out form a document not only of historic interest, but also one that is likely to be needed for reference in the future, and it has been decided, therefore, to insert the following outline of the conditions as a record in the Bulletin. The clauses of more than mere local importance are given in extenso. Preamble. Agreement for the Surrender o[ Medina. In fulfilment of Article J6 of the Armistice concluded between the Allied Governments and the Ottoman Government, it is agreed between Emir Ali, acting on behalf of the Hashimite Government, and Captain Garland, of British nationality, repre senting the Allied Governments on the one part, and the officers who have affixed their signatures to this document, acting on behalf of the General Command in Medina, on the other part, that Medina shall be evacuated and the Turkish forces disposed of under the following conditions : t JT 111 , vi , ew of the weak conditi °n of the officers and men of the I urkish army evacuating Medina, Emir Ah will intercede m the name of the Hashimite Government, with the Allied Governments and endeavour to obtain the return of the Turkish troops to their own country.

(14) Provides for the collection of camels, for moving the prisoners, at Erwa, near Medina, and for the provision of all necessaries for transport purposes. (15) The Arab officials appointed to accept the surrender shall enter Medina after the departure of General Fakhri Eddin Pasha. (16) Provides for the occupation of all necessary defence posts by the Arab army after departure of the first batch of Turkish troops, also for the maintenance of public security by the Arab army, and gives a guarantee by Emir Ali that the Bedouin shall not enter the city until completion of the evacua tion. (17) Money and bank notes in the treasuries of Turkish units and the relative official documents and accounts (which shall be registered in a schedule) are to be handed over in a regular manner to the Arab Committee selected for the purpose. (18) All Turkish units shall be allowed to take away ledgers and accounts in their possession, seeing that they may be called upon by their Government to produce them. (19) A committee shall be formed of notables and sheikhs of the local tribes to prevent damage and outrage during the withdrawal of the Turkish forces from the railway line. (20) The servants of the Sanctuary and of the Prophet’s Chamber shall be kept at their posts for one month and a half to allow for their replacement, and their salaries, as heretofore, shall be paid to them by the Arab Government.

(26) Provides for medical equipment required for the journey of the prisoners of war to the coast being taken from the Turkish hospitals and the balance handed over to the Arabs. (27) Provides for the safety and welfare of sick prisoners en route to the coast. The above terms were prepared in Turkish and Arabic, and were signed at Bir Derwish on January 7, 1919, by the following:— Emir Ali ; Captain Garland; Ali Negib Bey (second in command of the Turkish troops); Abdul Rahman Bey (Turkish O.C. Medina District); Sabri Bey (O.C. Turkish Supplies) ; and A medical officer representing the Turkish S.M.O. It is necessary to point out that, although the Turkish G.O.C., General Fakhri Pasha, deputed the Turkish Commission for the purpose of “ discussing ” the evacuation, he was not a party to the final agreement, as he failed to comply with clause number (2). The Commission, however, was allowed to return to Medina, and, on their arrival there, Fakhri Pasha was arrested and brought to Bir Derwish. B.— The Arab Entry. A belated report has come to hand from El Miralai (Colonel) Sadik Bey Yahya, D.S.O., Egyptian Army, who accompanied the Arab troops on their entry into Medina. It appears that this officer wrote the original report when he was at Medina in hebruary last and handed it to one of the Emirs for despatch, but it disappeared under suspicious circumstances and never reached Colonel Wilson, to whom the envelope was addressed. Sadik Bey has now provided a copy. The report exonerates Genera] Fakhri Eddin Pasha from most of the charges that have been made against him, such as unlawful and wanton destruction of sacred and private buildings, confiscation of property of civil inhabitants, and seizure of municipal and other non-Government funds. Information collected by Sadik Bey shows that the General— 91 * carried out his appropriations in a regular manner and, by means of a properly appointed assessment committee, lie compensated, so far as he was able, all persons whose property he had to seize under martial law for the sustenance of his garrison and the defence of the city. There were some cases in which he was unable to pay,, and these were duly recorded, the owners being given promissory notes which were to be honoured by the Turkish Government after the war. Sadik Bey states that much looting was done after the Arab occupation: over 4,800 buildings (belonging_ to absent Medina residents), which had been sealed by the Turkish military authorities, were broken open and the furniture stolen. ie Bedouin were not alone in this, but appear to have been a y assisted by regular Arab Officers ; and Sadik Bey asserts that “ the natives of Medina lost more during the first twelve days of the Arab occupation than they did during the two years it was in the hands of Fakhri Pasha. With regard to the books and treasures of the Haram, records were found in Medina of all articles that had been sent for safety to Constantinople and Damascus by Fakhri Pasha during the siege. NOTES. Ibn Rashid. As was predicted in our last number (page 63), Ibn RaMiid duly made Ills supplication for inclusion in our pay-lists, albeit bv proxy, but nevertheless definite and sincere. He remame camped at Shagrah (100 miles west of Basrah) whilst his agent travelled to Basrah and opened negotiations with an implied request that we should continue the Turkish grant of £T. 10,000 monthly, 7,000 rifles and large quantities of goods. 1 bn Has i evidently considers we have taken the place of the Turks as the paymasters of all Arabia. He has not disclosed the result of his submission to Husein, nor have we received from e King’s side any enlightenment as to why Ibn Rashid shoul have found it necessary to seek our aid so soon after Mecca s announcement of the Ibn Rashid-Husein ra VV rocUment. Ibn Rashid’s agent denied that his chief had made peace with Ibn Sand ; the report of such an agreement given in our last number (page 63) was therefore premature. It is a pity that Ibn Rashid was absent on his quest during the Khurma crisis, as the King would probably have been very glad of his help at any price. He may, however, still be in time to assist in reducing Ibn Saud to reason, as we are informed by— 92 — Baghdad (June 8) that he left Iraq for Hail after receivine a letter which, it is thought, had been sent •him by the King The Political Officer, Basrah, recently received from the oheikh of Zubeir a notice intended by Ibn Rashid for publica tion m the local press to the effect that the escort of pilgrims from Zubeir to Mecca and back, with safe conducts, would be undertaken by Ibn Rashid. Authority to publish the notice was granted by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, who considers that it should have an excellent effect locally, since the neasant pilgrims have had a real grievance as a result of the shipping shortage and the consequent restrictions. ^ ® Sherifian Propaganda in Iraq. n r Ba g }ldad w e have received reports (May 3 1919 ) Mar“shth r Zt g t a h nd tb in Ira 1- from assert that the Shenf has written to the Sheikhs of Se ofthfET’ that ^ cannot '“4* ’ tie planTfor Atbtd* 0 S a hCTlfian ^rnment wffih its follow the examp,eTtSm^ is takmg a lively interest in Kurdish affairs Ld that he asked Kurds.' ^ t0 Waid hlSmessa 8 e *0 the Rochan (Rashyan?)

The date of the affair is not given, and although Muhieddin Pasha artfully describes it as an action of the Qunfudah detachment, the passage probably refers to a fight against the Sherifian force sent to Qunfudah by King Husein early in March 1918 to stiffen the local friendly Bedouin, long after the Turks had retired from there to Goz Belair (pp. 96, 121, and 164 of volume 1918). . . In this letter Muhieddin Pasha forecasted the Idrisi attack against the Waazat and Abs districts, which actually took place on March 22, 1918 (p. 122, volume 1918), and stated that he had written secretly to the Imam Yahya asking for a loan to enable him to menace Sabiya and even Mecca, adding also that he was in constant communication with the Yemen. The second letter is undated, but it is obviously of later date than the above, as it mentions the receipt of a letter from Fakhri Pasha dated Medina, February 18,1918. To some extent it covers the same ground, but discloses that the Sherif s agent in the Tihamah was his relative, Faraj Bey ibn Said (p. 98, Asir Handbook), a former member of the Ottoman Parliament, whilst the Idrisi was employing Ahmed ibn Ibrahim Mita c ali (p. 92, Asir Handbook), formerly Kaimmakam of Bijal el Ma c . The following version of the predicted Idrisi attack on the Waazat line is given :— “ Idrisi attacked the Waazat line with about 4,000 paid fugitives from the Hashid and Bekil tribes, but thanks to the heroic defenders, the volunteers of the Imam, and to the heroism and ability of Major Ghalib Bey, O.G. the detachment, Idrisi’s attack was converted into a retreat.” The report omits any mention of the loss of Loheiyah on February 16, 1918 (p. 94, volume 1918), or of the subsequent Idrisi attacks which brought about the Turkish retirement to the Waazat line (see pp. 81, 90, 94, 114, and 122 of volume 1918), and closes with a note of complaint from Muhieddin Pasha, that of his 71 combatant officers, 1 major and a few captains and lieutenants “are good for nothing at present.” Ahmed Tewfik Pasha’s letter is dated March 26, 1918, and is of greater interest. He reports that “severe British attacks were made from Aden with the object of capturing Lahej and Newahi Tissa with aeroplanes, balloons, heavy guns and superior forces, all of which were brilliantly repulsed.” This refers, apparently, to the reconnaissances made by the Aden forces on December 20, 1917, through Jabir and Hatum, and our /94 temporary occupation of these two places on January S loo 7 and 18 volume 1918), from which Turkish pressure compelled our retirement. ^ Ahmed Tewfik Pasha estimates the amount of damage y snn U nno 0n w d f ent ° f Hodeidah ’ Loheiyah, and Salif at £.1 oOO.OOO, but for some inscrutable reason, asserts that these bombardments had the effect of decreasing our influence 0VCT « !p'j Y T T en : “ particularly over the Lahej Sultans.” the reoort “‘T haS f f a * edl y a^umed the offensive,” continues , u le l )0lt . being helped by numerous nomads of the Yam tribe, but al] Ins attacks have been repulsed.” f it Te J fik Pasha a PP ears reluctant to give the Idrisi full credit for his part m the operations against Loheiyah, con- si ering no doubt, that it would be infra dignitatem for a Turkish general to admit a defeat by “rebels,” but proceeds, “The cursed Idrisi has lately openly cooperated with the English • four warships and one aeroplane-carrier ship and numerous 1 mcT 'ThTtilf^ 6 P vT d L ° hei y al1 respectively from sea and id.

The Resident, Aden, reports that the sheikhs of Gebel— 95 — Bura have been pressing Sheikh Suleiman Bakhit, of the Abs tribe, to make submission to the Imam. This tribe is said to be in possession of 206 Mauser and 2,610 Italian and French rifles. Seyyid Abdul Qadir of Sanaa also received instructions from both the Imam and Mahmud Nadim to induce Suleiman Bakhit and the Akils of the Beni Abs tribe to sever their relations with the British Government and also to contrive to take away the ammunition received by the Beni Abs from us. Abdul Qadir replied that, according to Suleiman Bakhit, the object of the latter’s relations with the British Government was merely to get all he could out of them. The Political Officer, Hodeidah, reports that the general attitude of the Quhrah tribe is that they will fight neither the Imam, the Idrisi, nor the British Government, but would accept the domination of whichever turned out to be the strongest. Negotiations were opened by the Imam with this tribe, who- submitted certain terms under which they were prepared to accept his suzerainty, and appointed Sheikh Yahya (or Ayad ?) Ali Humeidah as their leader and spokesman. Under these terms the Imam was to receive only tithes on lands and cattle ; other taxes were to be levied and spent under the authority of the local sheikhs and ulemas. Imamic forces were not to be sent to the Quhrah country unless^ applied for by the sheikhs, in which case they should be maintained by the Imam. The remaining conditions were of less importance, and aimed chiefly at perpetuating various regulations concerning the appointment of officials and the internal administration of the Quhrah country which had been in force during the Turkish regime. It is reported that the Imam, in returning, the conditions, insisted on the Quhrah paying all tithes to his representative at Bajil ; also on their facilitating the passage of Zeidi troops through their country to the coast to establish order in that region, and on their accepting Seyyid Mohammed Hashim (son-in-law of the Imam) as ‘Amil at Bajil. He further stipulated that the Quhrah should contribute towards the force he intended sending to the Tihamah, and, as an inducement, promised to liberate a certain Sheikh Mujeikar from prison as soon as his demands had all been accepted. The Quhrah replied that the Imam’s terms were not accept able, chiefly because they would not tolerate the presence of Zeidi troops amongst them, the more so as it would only aggravate the already great scarcity of local supplies. They also urged that the country was quite quiet and there was no fear of aggression from the Idrisi nor from any other quarter.And, finally, they stated that they were not prepared to listen to any proposals unless Sheikh Mujeikar was first liberated from prison. The Imam afterwards summoned his envoy Mohammed Ahmed, of Hajeilah, to Sanaa for a further discussion of the terms. Sheikh Munasar Saghir, chief of the Zaraniq tribe, has also received attention both from the Imam and also his Turkish co-conspirator, Mahmud Nadim, but the sheikh appears to have adroitly turned it into an opportunity for demanding arms and ammunition from the Imam. The latter is reported to have appointed Munasar as his ‘Amil at Beit el Faqih and to have reminded him that all tithes on crops and cattle should be collected in the name of the Imam and remitted to Sanaa, but as the Sheikh is also known to be intriguing with the Idrisi and has told our Political Officer at Hodeidah of his corres pondence with Mahmud Nadim, there seems but little chance of Zaraniq taxes finding their way to Sanaa, even if the pressing requests of Munasar do induce the Imam to dispense arms and ammunition. Lower Yemen. The Kaimmakam of Hajariyah, Abdul Wahab Naaman, recently sent a sheikh, Abdul Hag el Aghbari, to ascertain the attitude of the British Grovernment towards the Yemen. This sheikh declared that it was well known that the country is to become a British Protectorate, but he was informed at Aden that, although we have no intention whatever of extending our limits, it was impossible at the present time to say what our future policy is to be. The sheikh stated that Abdul Wahab would throw in his lot with whoever was ultimately recognized as chief of the Lower \emen, whether the Imam, Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, or even the Sultan of Lahej. But, he added, submission to the Imam would be made with reluctance, as the Shawafi of the Lower Lemen would prefer to manage their own affairs with the help and advice of the British Government. The Assistant Resident, Perim, has reported that Ali Osman, Kaimmakam of Moza, is prepared to surrender the Turkish munitions in his possession to us, but that Sheikh Mohammed Hassan (who is reported to have occupied Mokha) was trying to take possession of them and had already attacked Ali Osman with this intention. The sheikhs of Kokha and surrounding villages recently made a request to be placed under British protection, and to this the Political Resident, Aden, returned the usual reply.— 97 — Further evidence of the inutility of our blockade has been received by the Assistant Resident, Perim, who states that he was informed by the Sheikh of Kokha’s messenger that seventy dhow loads of coffee, skins, ghee, dates, etc., are exported monthly from there to Jibuti. This may be an exaggeration, but the Resident, Aden, points out that it confims information from other sources that dhow traffic is carried on with Jibuti. Reports of fighting in the Hubeish country have been received from several sources. Seif el Islam Ahmed 1 .bn Qasim is said to have sent demands for taxes from the Ahl Hubeish and to have despatched Zeidi troops to enforce them. Anti- Zeidi partisan reports state that the Al Hubeish, assisted by the people of Ibb, Udein, and other villages, defeated these troops in two conflicts, and, according to one informant, the Seif el Islam was ultimately surrounded at Ibb. Four hundred Zeidi troops are rumoured to have entered Qatabah, where they invited the people to submit to the Imam, but the townspeople refused and a fight ensued, in which twenty casualties occurred on each side. Upper Yemen. Further details have been received of the plot (see page 65 of last number) to supplant the Imam by Mohammed Muhsin el Mutawakkil, whose claims are said to be supported by the Ahl Hubeish and most of the Lower Yemenites. Seyyid Ahmed ibn Yahya of Kibs took to Aden a number of recommendatory letters from both Zeidi and Shafai chiefs. He stated, however, that it was not intended that this Seif el Islam should actually become Imam, but merely that he should be placed in authority pending the election of a new Imam, the two most suitable candi dates being (according to El Kibsi) Sherif Mohammed ibn Abdullah el Dhayyani and Seyyed Mohammed ibn El Hadi Sharafuddin, alias Abu Neb (Emir of Udaqah), both of whom are regarded as men of straw by Colonel Jacob. El Kibsi said the scheme originated amongst the Zeidis, the Idrisi being approached subsequently on account of his influence with the British Government, whose assistance in promoting the scheme was hoped for. Under an arrangement with Ibn el Mutawakkil, the Idrisi was to extend his control over the Lower Yemen. As intimated in the last number of the Bulletin, it was decided to refuse our assistance, and both Seyyid Ahmed and Mohammed el Mutawakkil have been informed accordingly. An agent sent to Sanaa by the Political Officer, Hodeidah, -reports that early in April he saw 100 to 500 Hashid tribesmen arriving there' daily for enlistment in the Imam’s army. Over11,000 had collected by the middle of the month, and it was proposed to send 3,000 men towards Taiz, under Mohammed ibn El Mutawakkil. Mahmud Nadim continues to advise the Imam and to issue false war news. His latest effort is a communique describing a Turkish re-occupation of Baghdad and Palestine. There are said to be 39 Turkish military and medical officers, 25 civilians, and 250 regular Turkish soldiers still in Sanaa in the employment of the Imam. Idrisi, The Idrisi agreed to withdraw the troops he sent to occupy Salif (see page 65 of last number), and a party of British troops has now been despatched to occupy the place. The submission of Hassan Ali ibn Aidh of Ebhah to the Idrisi appears to be altogether sincere (see page 55 of last number), and he has renewed his oath of fealty. The Idrisi continues to be very suspicious of the movements of King Husein towards Qunfudah and Asir, whilst the King is equally as suspicious of the Idrisi’s propaganda in these places. No opportunity is lost by the Idrisi of complaining of the delay in removing our blockade of the coast, and, if our relations with this chief are to remain satisfactory, it appears very neces sary that he should be deprived of this grievance as soon as possible. Certain of the Bajil, Beit el Faqih, and Zebid chiefs recently wrote to the Idrisi begging him to extend his overlordship to those districts, and the Idrisi, in forwarding the petition to the Political Resident, Aden, stated that it was his wish to advance towards them, but only after consulting us. It has been pointed out that preferences on religious grounds for the Idrisi by inhabi tants of regions which, for geographical or other reasons, should fall to the Imam YpRya, form only one of the possible sources of danger which will persist until a settlement of disputed claims in these territories is made. On the other hand, it may be lemarked that the doctrine of “ self-determination ” will cer tainly find adherents and apostles within the scattered hamlets of Asir (and Khurma too), as in the more civilized parts of the world. King Husein has sent to Colonel Bassett, as evidence of Idusi intrigue in the Qunfudah district, two original letters dadressed by the Sheikh of Muhail, Suleiman ibn Ali, to Sheikh Beitali ibn Hassan, and Ali ibn Medini. The King does not disclose how the letters came into his possession, but he is, not unnaturally, disturbed at these efforts of the Idrisi to fore stall the settlement of outstanding boundary disputes by us.— 99 — The writer of the letters explains that he visited the Idrisi, who forgave all his past offences (pro-Turk activities) and allowed him to retain all his rights and privileges. He therefore advises the two sheikhs to forthwith prostrate themselves before the Idrisi, who will, without doubt, also extend to them a full pardon. Should they not be in a position to leave their affairs unattended, Suleiman ibn Ali offers to send one of his own relatives to replace each of them whilst he is away. Sheikh Suleiman ibn Ali consistently supported the Turks during the war (see page 152 of volume 1916) ; Sheikh Beitah ibn Hassan is no doubt Beitali Abu Atanah, Sheikh of the Beni AVlah, another pro-Turk (see page 149, volume 1916) , whilst Ali ibn Medina of Goz Bekair (see page 148, volume 1916), who probably forwarded the letters to the King, has always exhibited pro-Sherifian tendencies. Mohammed Nasir Muqbil. Mohammed Nasir Muqbil is reported to have occupied Taiz at the request of the inhabitants. The Imam again invited him to Sanaa, but he excused himself on the score of infirmity and old age. Seyyid Tahya el Filali el Mahi (see pages 51, 196 of volume 1918), who recently returned to Aden from a visit to Mares, says that an alliance has been made between Mohammed Nasir Muqbd, Ahmed Pasha of Taiz, the sons of Ali Abdullah of Udein, the family of Abu Ras of Dhi Sufal, and Abdul Wahab Naaman, by which they all placed themselves under the leadership of Mohammed Nasir Muqbil with the object of resisting the Zeidis. Reports from Jebel Jihaf state that Mohammed Nasir and his nephew have sent threatening letters to the Seyyid of Jebel Jihaf and others urging them to submit to his authority, but that the Emir of Dhala and others have decided to fight should Mohammed Nasir actually launch an attack on that territory. Seyyid Mohammed Tahar of Jebil Jihaf has been to Aden and produced one of these letters. He was told that the Government would not countenance any invasion of pro tected districts by Mohammed Nasir Muqbil. It is not unlikely that the reports of Mohammed Nasir’s attempts to establish himself on our side of the border are largely false, Amiri Affairs. The Qadi of Dhala and others have written to the Political Resident, Aden, requesting a reconsideration of the Govern ment decision about Emir Nasr (page 67 of last number). The Emir has also written again pleading for pardon.Seyyid Yahya el Filali says that the Amiris want no one but Emir Nasr, but that if we insist on his abdication they will put up one of his brothers. He states that the tribesmen are afraid lest the deposition of Nasr should become a precedent for the removal of other minor sheikhs. Fadli Affairs. . The son of the Lower Yafa Sultan recently visited Aden in connection with the dispute between the Ahl Fadl and the Lower Yafa (see page 67 of last number), but during his absence the Fadlis attacked the Lower Yafais, occupied Helamah, El Husn, and Ubar Jama, and removed all standing crops. Sultan Abdul Qadir announced his victory in a letter to the Political Resident, Aden, who forthwith sent a reply reprimanding him for taking the offensive at a time when he knew efforts were being made by us to reconcile the differences. Abdali Affairs. The quarrel between the Sultan Abdul Qerim and his cousins, the sons of the late Sir Ahmed Fadl, has been settled, but details are not yet. to hand. The Sultan of Mokalla assisted in bringing about this agreement during his recent visit to Aden, and for this he deserves our thanks. Mokalla. Sir Ghalib ibn Awad, the Kaiti Sultan of Mokalla, accom panied by Sultan Ali ibn Mansur,' representing both branches of the Kathiris of Hadhramaut, recently visited Aden for the ratification of the Kaiti—Kathiri treaty, which was duly carried out before the Political Resident. Abd el Wahid Sultanate. On the death of Sultan Muhsin ibn Saleh, the Wahidi, his younger son Ali was elected Sultan “ to mle the whole country belonging to the family of Abdul Wahid from El Hasa el Hamra to Gardan el Melh, Nokbah and Hejr.” Abyssinia. M M. Charge ■ d’Affaires at Addis Abbaba reports (May 2) 1&lt;? • Ras 1)emiss i e &gt; Governor of Wallega, a man of considerable influence, unfriendly to Ras Taffan, and one who by continual intrigue, endeavoured to weaken the position of divul ed' aPParent ’ ^ SUCcessor ’ s name has not jet beenThe British Legation at Addis Abbaba sends an account of the Gilbertian incidents which led up to the reconciliation between Has Taffari and the Minister of War (Fitaurari Hapti Georgis) announced in our last edition (page 70). On May 4 several thousand troops assembled with a few minor officers and demanded the dismissal of the Fitaurari on the grounds that he had opposed all the progressive measures of the Government (meaning Ras Taffari) and had incurred suspicion by bringing large numbers of his own soldiers to the capital. The following day, at a meeting of chiefs held in the Ghebi attended by the Empress, Ras Taffari and the Abuna, the chiefs expressed their disgust that common soldiery should attempt to dictate to the Government, and asked that the instigators should be punished. They further begged the Empress and the Ras to become reconciled. The Empress merely replied that no differences existed, and remarked that the soldiers must be pacified. She would therefore send one deputation to calm them and another to the Minister of War to enquire why he had gathered his forces and guns around his domicile. Ras Taffari disclaimed responsibility for the crisis, and said it was due solely to the Fitaurari, whose actions had proved that he was contemplating the seizure of greater powers than he possessed. As for himself, he had been given full powers long before by the Empress to administer the country, and there was therefore no reason for him to intrigue against any one. Moreover, he had not increased his personal force. The speech was well received, and by the afternoon Ras Taffari had the majority of the chiefs on his side. In the evening, however, two train loads of his troops arrived from Harrar, followed by further batches on the following days, and it was soon found that his house was being put in a state of defence. Seeing this, Emperor Menelik’s army assembled and de- declared Ras Taffari was plotting to gain supreme power, and they thereupon swore that they would defend the Empress to the last man. As a result of their insistent demands that the Fitaurari should be brought to the Ghebi and tried, the Empress promised he should appear the next day, “ if fine,” and told them to disperse. The Fitaurari accordingly went to the Ghebi on the following morning, but, finding no one there, returned to his house after waiting an hour. His annual feast to the army was due on May 9, and he duly gave it, the Empress and Ras Taffari also being present. This has been considered as a reconciliation. Fitaurari Hapti Georgis consistently opposed Ras Taffari for many months, and though he has usually had the Empress— 102 — on his side, various incidents have occurred recently to accentuate the quarrel between the two chiefs. It is easy to sympathize with Ras Taffari’s anxiety to rid himself of what he considers is the chief obstacle to reform, but he was unwise to attempt it when uncertain of his power to carry it out. He is commonly suspected of having instigated the troops to demand the dismissal of the Fitaurari, though he denies it. The agreement is thought to be merely artificial and the quarrel may break out again in a month or so. Meanwhile, the Fitaurari is assembling an army near Addis Alem, to the west, and Ras Taffari is doing likewise at Meso, to the east of the capital. Most of the chiefs have now pronounced in favour of the Fitaurari, and the Empress is certainly supporting him. Time will show whether the rival mobilizations will end in bloodshed ; many Abyssinnians predict that it will be averted. Kurdistan. Reports from various sources indicate that the Independence movement has made considerable headway amongst the Kurds. It has derived much impetus from the pronunence which has been given to Armenian national claims in Europe and America, and there appears to be a widespread fear amongst the Kurds that their interests are being obscured by “ misplaced ” sympathy towards the Armenians. Further, there is a lively apprehension of vindictive punishment by the Powers in connection with the Armenian massacres. Although there are said to be two main Kurdish parties, one pro-Turk, fanatically anti-Christian and anti-foreign, the other anti-Turk, with pro-British tendencies, both aspirants to the Kurdish leadership appear to be thoroughly anti-Turk and favour complete autonomy for their country, to which they would give us the privilege of contributing the necessary financial and, no doubt, military support, this apparently being their idea of the meaning of the term “ mandate.” It is alleged from Baghdad that the pro-Turkish sections of the Kurdish tribes are being encouraged by agents of the Sherif, who work on their religious instincts and on their dread of further European influence. Captain C. L. Woolley recently visited a small part of Kurdistan, as far as Viranshehr, and discussed the political situation with the chiefs of the Milli, Zaza, Karawar, Kit-Kan, Barasi, and El Aun tribes. He reports the prevalence of a strong nationalist sense and, in the districts covered by his tour, aunanimity on mam issues, wliicli, lie thinks, betokens, m all probability, a similar feeling over a much wider area. His interesting report must, however, stand over for detailed treatment in our next issue. _ Meanwhile, the anti-British sections of the Kurdish move ment have found a champion in Sheikh Mahmud of Suleimaniyeh, in Southern Kurdistan. On May 22 serious disorders occurred at this place : the local tribes rose against the Government, defeated its levies, looted the treasury, and imprisoned eight British officers. ^ , It appears that Sheikh Mahmud obtained support from Persian Kurdistan, some 1,500 men having travelled from there to ioin him His agents in Persia and Kurdistan were actively engaged in spreading unrest, but he found only a small measure of support outside the towns. . In order to adjust the situation and to relieve the imprisoned officers the military authorities concentrated a force for an advance on Suleimaniyeh, and on June 17 an attack was made under General Eraser, on the Barzan pass, which was held by Sheikh Mahmud’s followers. The Pass was captured at dawn on the 18th and amongst our prisoners was Sheikh Mahmoud, seriously wounded. Cavalry pushed on to Suleimaniyeh at once and rescued all British prisoners in the hands of the enemy. Our main force occupied the town the following day.SECRET. ARAB BULLETIN. No. 113.Territorial Disputes in Arabia. Hecent events in the Hejaz bring to mind the large amount of work that lies ahead in connection with the settlement of boundary disputes in the central and western parts of the Arabian Peninsula. In addition to the quarrel between King Husein and Ibn Sand over the Khurma and Tarabah districts, there is awaiting arbitration the Husein-Idrisi dispute as to the ownership of Qunfudah, an account of which appears in this number. King Husein and the Idrisi are also likely to come into conflict over Ebhah, where the local Sheikh. Hassen ibn Ali Aidh, has undoubted pro-Sherifian leanings, despite the fact that he recently made a show of submission to the Idrisi, under whose control, if geographical considerations were the governing factor, his district would naturally fall. Ibn Sand and the Idrisi are turning covetous eyes towards the district of Bisha, and it is quite possible that King Husein may find himself one of three claimants for this fertile tract. From the Imam Yahya of the Yemen and the Idrisi there are rival claims to Bajil, Beit el Faqih, Salif, and other districts in the Tihamah, urgently calling for adjudication, and even the ownership of the somewhat important coastal town of Hodeidah is likely to be a source of trouble before a peaceful settlement is reached, for, although it forms the natural port of Sanaa, the Yemen capital, the Idrisi resents its allocation to the Imam. Then, ao-ain, there are various Imamic encroachments on 'O' ... our Protectorate around Aden and on the tribes within our sphere of influence there to be settled ; also certain disagreements between King Husein and Ibn Rashid which for the moment are being allowed to lie quiescent, but must inevitably be revived when boundary questions are taken up. Ibn Rashid will undoubtedly demand the return to him of Teima and other villages east of the Hejaz Railway which are at present in possession of Husein. Beside these outstanding cases, differences between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud are expected to offer a wide field for the application of skilful arbitration, so soon as attempts are begun to define the territories of these chiefs. Although Bedouin allegiance is not immutable, often being, indeed, a purchasable commodity, it is probable that peace in Arabia can only be hoped for if some measure of “ self- determination ” is granted to the sheikhs of districts in dispute. It would, of course, be impossible and unwise to indulge in “ self-determination ” in its most flagrant form, as in that case we should have thousands of minor sheikhs each applying for his independent rulership over a petty oasis or an unimportant— 106 sub-tribe, and, at the same time, for a suitable subsidy. But it is thought that it should be possible to allow the sheikhs of territory which is claimed by two or more of the several recognized, or treaty, rulers, to say under which of those rulers their tribesmen elect to serve. It would be necessary to explain to the sheikhs that once they have made their choice, no revision will be entertained, except, perhaps, after a stipulated number of years. It also appears essential that it should be made clear to the recognized rulers that, after frontiers have been finally fixed, it will be the duty of each ruler to defend his own boundaries, and that tribal raids and petty disputes are purely their own affairs with which we cannot be concerned. No form of boundary settlement will, of course, bring unadulterated peace to Arabia ; tribal raids will necer go out of fashion, and the need for confining the activities of the Wahabis and Ikhwan will ever be present. We shall, however, need to be most guarded in our promises to assist rulers against acts of aggression on their frontiers ; otherwise, every little tribal dis turbance will result in a prompt demand for aeroplanes, tanks, and other more or less suitable forms of armed assistance. The experiment of arbitration on a large scale in territorial disputes between important Arab rulers has yet to be tried. It is possible that adverse decisions will receive little respect from any of them, and they are adepts at shifting the blame for initial acts of aggression to the other side. H. G. The Idrisi and Qunfudah. Under the treaty of April 30, 1915, the Idrisi’s military obligations towards ourselves are described as follows : “ The Idrisi Seyyid agrees to attack and endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen, and to the best of his power to harass the Turkish troops in the direction of the Yemen and to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks.” The Idrisi’s activity during the first year after the conclusion of this treaty was not remarkable. In his defence it might be urged that we had not yet afforded him assistance of any value as regards munitions, while he might well fear that a premature offensive would draw upon him the combined attentions of the Turks, the imam Yahya and the Sherif of Mecca, whose last appearance in Asir had been as the servant of the Turks. If that happened, our reverses at Aden and Kut did not promise that we should be able to stand by him effectively.Early in June 1916, however, H.M.S. “ Northbrook ” left Aden for Jeizan. Pressure was brought to bear on the Idrisi with a view to persuading him to take action which should synchronize with the expected revolt of the Sherif and facilitate the task of the latter. Commander L. N. Turton, R.N, Captain Reilly, and Lieutenant L. F. Nalder, R.N.V.R., had interviews with the Idrisi on June 10 and 11, in which, after his scepticism as to the Sherd’s declaring himself openly against the Turks had once been overcome, he showed every readiness to co-operate wholeheartedly with the former. The results of this interview were given in a telegram sent from. Aden m June, wherein it was stated that Commander Turton had received from the Idrisi a letter in which the latter agreed to undertake immediate offensive operations, and his first move would be on Qunfudah, Hah, and Ebhah. During the period immediately subsequent to this, the Idrisi appears to have received no hint of discouragement or disapproval with regard to his choice of objective. The only fault found with him was his slowness in moving, which he justified by pointing out the difficulties of communication, and by explaining that he wished to make quite sure of the co operation of the Arabs near Hali before moving on Qunfudah. On account, partly of the urgency of making a demonstration which should assist the Sherif, and partly on account of difficulties in communication between the ships and the shore, and the normal Arab vagueness as to dates and places, the Idrisi was not given the time he desired for negotiations in the Hali district. On July 18, Qunfudah was bombarded by H.M. ships, while the Idrisi was yet in no position to assist in the attack, or to garrison the town if taken. The Turkish garrison surrendered, and the Idrisi flag was hoisted by the British. After a few days further delay an Idrisi garrison was placed in the town. The next stage in the proceedings is best given in the words of a report by Lieutenant Nalder : - . “ At the end of July reports were received that oheikh Mohammed Nasir was advancing on Qunfudah from Lith with Sherifial troops at the instigation of certain sheikhs of the district. These sheikhs were, the Idrisi alleges, those whose sons had been detained at Sabia (the Idrisi s capital) on account of Turkish intrigue. AVe know that the Sherif was corresponding with the Idrisi with reference to these hostages at the beginning of the rising.’’ These hostages had been kept since 1911 by the Idrisi, who at that time controlled the Qunfudah district and was besieging Ebhah. A force consisting of Turkish troops with Arab irregulars, under the command of two of the Sherif’s sons, marched downfrom Mecca. The Idrisi was forced to raise the siege of Ebhah and to abandon Qunfudah district, but he took with him, as hostages, fifteen sons of sheikhs who had espoused the Turkish cause. To return to Lieutenant Nalder’s narrative :— The Idrisi was naturally perturbed at this news ; but the movement appeared, in view of the Sherifs situation in the north, and his appeals for help, to be merely a rather flagrant try on ” which diplomatic representations would nip in the bud. The presence of the ship at Qunfudah prevented any attack being made. The townspeople declared their loyalty with Idrisi and wrote to iSTasir asking him to withdraw. As days went on, however, it became apparent that the bherif was holding firm, and finally a message was received stating that H.M.G. had decided to withdraw the Idrisi garrison by sea, and that the Idrisi was to be informed of the fact. This was a somewhat difficult message to deliver, and the difficulty was increased by the fact that orders were given for the im mediate withdrawal of the ship, with forty-eight hours’ notice to enable the Idrisi to telegraph his instructions for evacuation. The Idrisi was, not unnaturally, exceedingly angry. Apart from believing that his withdrawal from Qunfudah would afford considerable relief to the Turks, for reasons detailed in his letters, he complained that he had been treated without any consideration. We had installed him at Qunfudah at our time, not at his ; we then arrange with the Sherif to give the place To him, without consulting the Idrisi at all, adding a summary ime _ imi b which, if adheied to, would entirely destroy his prestige m Asir.” J The Idrisi’s representations were so far effective that an extension of thirty days was granted, during which delegates rom both sides might meet, so that some show of negotiation might precede the actual evacuation. In spite of the fact that dimcultes again arose when news arrived from Qunfudah on August 13 that the ship there had given the garrison three days in which to evacuate (failing which they wou'd be shelled), the delegates did eventually meet, and thus something was done to save appearances. summak f ff° Win ? extracts from letters illustrate the above summary of events :— August Turt0U &gt; R ' N -’ t0 ^ Mrisi, datedthat he must have Qunfudah peaceably or by force, or he will discontinue his offensive against the Turks in the norti. e adds that he will restore it at the end of the war. the letter- goes on to say that H.M.G. was obliged in the circumstances to advise the Idrisi’s withdrawal and it warns him of the very brief time-limit allowed. . , (6) A long reply from the Idrisi to Captain lurton, ol August 8, begins :— , “ . . . If it is a question of force, in the past I have opposed his force by force although with him. were the whole forces of Turkey, and at the present time I am ready, with the help ol Allah, to oppose him more energetically, but I see that you do not wish this owing to the criticalness of the situation. He then proceeds to argue that there can be oo unity unless each ruler keeps to his own bounds ; that the sheikhs who hold Qunfudah for him were the most respected sheikhs of Quniucla i and Birk districts, who had fought loyally for him against the Turks eio-ht years before, while those who had invited the bheril were the' pro-Turkish sheikhs of 1911 ; while, finally, as justifi cation of his own past action, he encloses a letter ol June 14 from the Resident, Aden, containing the following sentence “It is hoped that vour movement will be of the greatest ad vantage to the Sherif of Mecca on whose shoulders the heaviest burden will fall, and I am sure that he will be most grateful to Your Excellency whatever action you may decide to take and for this reason it appears that your attack on Ebhah and Muhail, and Qunfudah in the first place, is the best. ... The above statements of fact and opinion being extracted from the reports of officers who were in a position to know e Idrisi’s point of view, but not King Husem’s, may be regarcec as to some extent ex farte, but one point they show clearly that the Idrisi was in no way to blame for moving against Qunfudah, and that he submitted loyally and with a certain amount of dignity to a very ' galling and undeaerved public humiliation. Officers who were m touch with him at this tir seem to have been impressed, too, by the genuineness ol ns desire to co-operate with the Sherif, while there are some hints that he was not then bitterly opposed even to the Sherif s laigei With regard to who should be the lawful overlord of Qunfudah in the future, the notes above naturally give a one sided impression. But the sole reason for withdrawal given to the Idrisi was that, King Husein having uttered the first of his long series of threats of resignation if he did not get Ins way it was considered that the Idrisi’s claims must be over ruled for the time being rather than that there should be any— 110 — risk of a collapse of the whole Arab movement. Moreover, the Idrisi’s arguments and prophecies when he was forced to withdraw his troops, subsequently received this much confirmation : that the Sherif was unable to hold the Qunfudah district, which soon reverted to the Turks. The latter held Joz a few miles inland, and Qunfudah remained an empty shell till the end of the war! Two statements of the Idrisi, which should (unlike most statements concerning territorial settlements in Arabia) be capable of verification, have some bearing on the question of the future of Qunfudah. They are, firstly, that the very sheikhs who invited the Sherif to oust the Idrisi, afterwards helped the Turks once more to oust the Sherif; and, secondly, that the majority of the Qunfudah merchants, when forced to flee from the ^ rks ^ refuge m Idrisian ports such as Hali and Birk. he Qunludah question remained dormant from the time rr , e district once more reverted to the Turks, until May, 1919, when Captain Fazl ud din reported that King Husein had reoccupied Qunfudah, and that this was resented by the Idrisi w o urged that, as he himself had been told not to move in that ireotion pending territorial settlement, the King should be simdarly restrained. Enquiries of Jeddah elicited the fact that g Husein had probably sent some civilian officials, but not from anv Qu j . nfudah - , Tlle q risiwas that he should refrain m any action pending arbitration, and that the temporary aueXon°of t by ^ “ would ^ct question of its future ownership.

This last provision however, has not been enforced. ? j i “ The King agreed to recognize Ibn Sand’s right to deal with the Ateibah in his own country.” Emir Feisal to Colonel Lawrence, February, 1917. “ Feisal states that: ‘About five _ years ago Ibn Saud began to move the people of Nejd against the Meccans.

All Wadi Dawasir (to a point where it becomes Wadi Rainy ah) was re cognized as Ibn Sand’s, and Wadis Khurma, Bisha, and Ramyah were confirmed to the Sherif.

Jeddah, from Enquiries made locally, September, 1918. “ It is fairly certain that for the last fifteen years the Ateibah, Sebei, Buqum and Shalawali elements of Khurma, Tarabah, Sebei and Raniyah have been, at least nominally, subject o the Emirate of Mecca. They were placed under Mecca by the Turks.” An aged and learned Teacher of the Haram {Mecca, Jan, 1919). This teacher, a crypto-Wahabite, stated that: The She- rifian claim goes back to 1846, when Husem’s grandfather Emir Mohammed, invaded Nejd at the instance of the Tur s and imposed on the Nejd Emir, Feisal, an annual tribute of 10,000 dollars. This was paid up to 1885 (date of Feisal s death) but not after. Emir Husein invaded Nejd in 1909 to reimpose it but came to an agreement for 3,000 dollars. This is believed never to have been paid. The eastern boundary of the Heiaz was east of Khurma along the base of Jebel Asn and Jebel Sebei.” (This is not so far east as has sometimes been claimed.)— 114 — Yassin Bey Hassen, January, 1919, An ex-Kaimmakam and formerly collector of Turkish taxes at Khurma, stated :— “ The Hejaz boundary was eight caravan days (250 kilo metres) east of Khurma. Emirs of Khurma were always appointed by the Emirs of Mecca, but were paid by the Ottoman Government, who collected taxes there. The Sebei and Buqum tribes have always been under the Yah (Governor) of the Hejaz. The Qadi of Khurma was appointed by Mecca. There were a certain number of Wahabis in Khurma who had their own Qadi from Nejd but he was not official.” Ali Abd el Kesim Kurdi, an old Mecca Resident, March 9, 1919. 14 I am of Persian extraction and came to Cairo in 1858, joining the Egyptian Army. Later I served as a Captain in the Turkish cavalry and after twelve years service was pensioned, bince then I have lived in Mecca. Soon after my arrival in the Hejaz I went to Khurma with a Turkish expedition which v as sent by permission of the Emir of Mecca to deal with unrest due to TV ahabi activities there. The He]az-Kejd boundary (to which I personally went) was ten days by baggage camel (250 ki lometres) east of Khurma and m those days it was generally accepted that Khurma belonged to the Hejaz under the Emirs of Mecca.” It should be noted that the above three witnesses are independent ones who were not put up by the King; nor did they know their statements would be passed on to Colonel Wilson. The boundary quoted by them takes the Hejaz frontier to the eastern edges of the Sebei territory. lungs Letter to Jeddah, March 29, 1919. ^ to make it quite clear to you that in only mentioning Kuqah (Ateibah sub-tribe in Hejaz, west of the Buqum) in the sketch-map I made for Wilson Pasha, showing part of the Arab country, this does not mean that Khurma, Tarabah, Baniyah, isha, and Dawasir do not belong to the capital (Mecca) ; for up to this date their Emirs are being appointed bv us and their taxes and tributes are being sent to us. It is I who appointed Khalid Emir of Khurma and discharged Sherif Mohammed ibn Sultan from Bisha which I added to Khalid.’ of fn In w h !- a ^° Ve letter the King no doubt refers to tlie F a r ts of the TT adis Dawasir, Baniyah, and Bisha which Feisal informed fwT alI ° tted t0 the King under 1910 tieaty with Ibn Sand.— 115 — Letter of Ibn Saud to the King. In a letter from Ibn Saud to the King, dated August 15, 1918, the former admits the King’s right to correspond with Khahd, for he says: “As regards Khurma people, I think Your Majesty should write a letter to Khalid and all the people o the Wadi stating that “ I and Ibn Saud are one against the enemy,” and counselling them to keep quiet until the end of the war, “when all differences will be settled amicably. The Case for Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud in Letter to Mr. Philby {August 15, 1918). 4 I have already told you of the matter of Khalid and his country and the oppression of the Sherif against him. Sherif has got no reason against him either religious or geo graphical.” Ibn Saud to Mr. Philby {August 10, 1918). “ If he (Husein) is proved to have the least right over us or our subjects or over Khurma (whether this right lie legal by law or custom or by choice of the subjects) we are prepared to recognize it and adhere to orders. Ibn Saud in Letter to Jeddah {received June 13, 1919). “ I have sent several letters to H.M. Government asking them to act as judge in order to settle troubles between us. The two towns of Tarabah and Khurma are counted as parts of the countries of Nejd and of their dependencies morally and TY'i q t’PTlciillv. ? ^ “ l n a n agreement Great Britain promised to give all necessary help to us against agression on our countries and frontiers “ The treaties and letters which are in our possession and which are signed by him and our enemies are sufficient proot of what I have stated. . , m u r “ Not a bit of land was taken by us (referring to laraban and Khurma) that was not in accordance with the agreement made between us and H.M.G.’ Report of Mr. Philby after a Visit to Nejd {August 13, 1918). “ I believe I am the only European who has ever seen Khurma * I speak therefore with a full sense of my responsibility, and my considered view is that the boundary of the He]az, in the widest sense in which that term is capable of being used, runs (in the tract under consideration) along the eastern edge— 116 of the Shaib Shaba south westward to Tarabah. This is un doubtedly the recognized boundary between the Buqum and Sebei tribes, and comes within ten miles (W.) of Khurma. This is my opinion, whilst Ibn Saud and others would carry the boundary back fifty miles westward to Wadi Aqiq. “ Ibn Saud claims Khurma as being within his jurisdiction, not only on religious and territorial but also on historical, administrative and tribal grounds. He asserts that the whole population of Khurma are Wahabis and, as such, have religious claim on the protection of the people of Nejd and Ibn Saud. “ I believe that Turkish documentary evidence would establish the boundary sixty miles west of Khurma to Wadi Aqiq. Shaib Shaba is the only possible natural boundary. The Sebei tribe is essentially a Kejd tribe. Ibn Saud is prepared to renounce his claim to Khurma if the Sebei express a preference for Sherifian rule.” Mr. Philby suggests that the Sherifial appointment of Khalid was superogatory and that when his predecessor died, Khahd was merely recorded in the Turkish registers as the rightful recipient of the subsidy for guarding the pilgrim route. Accusations of aggression, religious propaganda and inter ference m tribal matters from each side against the other form the biggest part of the matter in our files. That Ibn Saud’s missionaries have been active for some years is quite certain, but Beduin information is always very unreliable, and it is a hopeless task to try to ascertain which side in each raid was the actual aggressor or to decide accurately whether a particular raid by the partisans of one disputant was not merely a counter-raid made in return for a previous raid by the opposite side. In any case, the responsibility for the various acts o aggression that have occurred is a question of secondary importance and does not affect the major dispute. Conclusion. It will be observed that the whole question almost certainly rests largely on the 1910 treaty made between Ibn Saud and , mg . lt 18 ver -^ suggestive that King Husein refused ° thls tr eaty when asked to do so by Colonel Wilson and that Emir Abdullah also failed to fulfil a promise he made to obtain a copy of the document. treaty terms ’ as g iven b 7 the nouf of kh ’ FeiSa1, d ° n0t agree ’ and be tliat none of them is the correct or complete one. corro.nLo d ’ 0n .^ he ^ other ban d, states that his treaty and correspondence with the King form proofs of his claim; nodoubt he will be willing to produce them. It therefore appears very necessary that, before arbitrating, an authentic copy of the treaty should be seen by our representatives. The question of the official Turkish Hejaz-Nejd boundary line could no doubt be settled by reference to Constantinople, but it is quite possible that the 1910 treaty altogether ignored Turkish delimitations. On the other hand, our 1915 treaty with Ibn Saud, which included Nejd as one of his possessions, defined no boundaries. It is reasonable to suppose, however, that on our side it was the official Turkish boundaries of Nejd that we had in mind when we agreed to assist Ibn Saud against all aggression on his frontiers. Ibn Saud is willing to let “ self-determination ” play its part in settling the dispute. He knows well that the greater part of the inhabitants of Khurma and Tarabah have Wahabi inclinations, so he has nothing to lose by the application of this doctrine. If the people of these districts are placed under King Husein against their wishes, it seems likely that the future for him will be pregnant with trouble, and it might be helpful if the Sheikhs of the Sebei and the Buqum could be given opportunities of stating their preference when the time arrives for adjudication. A canvass of the leading Ateibah Sheikhs would also be of use as giving an indication of how much help the King might eventually receive from that tribe if the Sebei and Buqum were compelled, under the terms of the arbitration, to submit to the King. Because, unless the King can absolutely depend on a large amount of support from the Ateibah, it would probably be abortive to allot (or restore, as the case may be) to him the Wahabis of Khurma and Tarabah. Husein would have great difficulty in establishing his authority in the district, and would no doubt expect us to keep it quiet. If a great Wahabi revival, through the medium of the Ikhwan, is imminent, and if the local people are in favour of it, it is im probable that any boundary decision will prevent its spread. Should it eventually become necessary to repress the movement, then the duty of all orthodox Moslem countries will be to join in the task, and King Husein can hardly expect European lives to be risked in a sectarian war within the Mohammedan religion. It is necessary to remember that, in Arabia, religion dominates politics, and especially is this the case with the Wahabis. “Self-determination,” therefore, means to the Arabs that they follow the temporal leader to whom they give their religious adherence.The first points for elucidation with regard to the Khurma dispute are therefore (1) What were the terms of the 1910 treaty between Ibn Saud and the King ? (2) What was the official Hejaz-Nejd boundary under the Turks ? (3) AVill it tend towards peace in the future if tribes whose religious, and therefore political, allegiance is given to one leader (Ibn Sand) are placed under his territorial and religious rival, the King ? (4) Has the King sufficient authority over the Ateibah to enable him, with their help, to keep the above tribes in check if the latter were placed under his overlordship against their wishes? H. Gr. Latest Intelligence. Owing to King Husein’s refusal to allow the Taif-Khurma route to Nejd to be used by Mr. Philby, the latter has been withdrawn by His Majesty’s Government, as also have the aeroplanes which were stationed at Jeddah for the defence of Mecca. It will be interesting to see how long the rivals now abstain from acts of aggression : each of them has faithfully promised not to break the peace. The King has received reinforcements of Arab troops, comprising about 60 officers, 450 men, 8 field guns, and 20 machine guns, which were sent for defence purposes from Syria. Ibn Rashid recently wrote to Emir Abdullah placing himself under the latter’s orders, offering to make an attack on Ibn Sand’s town of Boreidah, and asking for supplies and money. The King and Abdullah deny having instigated Ibn Rashid to take such action, and say that the attack will probably not take place : they also state that they have firmly refused the request for money and supplies. Colonel Wilson made it clear to Emir Abdullah that any offensive co-operation between Ibn Rashid and the King against Ibn Saud would not be countenanced by His Majesty’s Government. From a perusal of Ibn Rashid’s letter to Emir Abdullah it appears that the oft-quoted rajp'prochement between the King and Ibn Rashid never materialized, and Colonel Wilson states that only preliminary negotiations w^ere carried out. Ibn Saud has written to Colonel Wilson saying that he got his chief supporters to leave Tarabah by advising them to return to Nejd to prepare for the pilgrimage, and, Ibn Saud himself having left for Riadh, the two villages in dispute are now left in the hands of the residents who, in Ibn Sand’s words, “ are quite able to take care of themselves,”Colonel Wilson, writing from Jeddah on June 24, again draws attention to the possibility of a Wahabi revival on a large scale, but there are no definite indications of such an event, and Bedouin prognostications of it have, so far, proved wrong. There is some perturbation m Mecca at the idea of a pilgrimage being prepared m Nejd, and Colonel Wilson feais that, should large numbers of Ikhwan perform the ceremony, disturbances might result, and that, on the conclusion of the pilgrimage rites, Ibn Saud might conceivably use the occasion as an opportunity for occupying Mecca. Meanwhile, all preparations for a large pilgrimage from other Moslem lands are going ahead; indeed, some have already arrived at Jeddah, It seems unlikely that Ibn Saud will interfere with the pilgrimage or that he will undertake any such foolhardy operation as the seizure of Mecca, an act which could but have disastrous results for him eventually. Kurdistan. In his report on the journey he recently made to Yiranshehr. Captain C. L. Woolley gives the following “ general idea” of the chiefs of the Kurdish tribes with whom he discussed the political situation. n _. n . J . , , “ Kurdistan stretches from Kars and Tmis to Adana, aud from Trebizond and Malat la to Rowan Duz. It includes, therefore, the six so-called Armenian Vilayets, part of Russia, and part of North Persia. For this area the chiefs claim a Kurdish population of 13,000,000. The name “Armenian Vilayets,” in their view, is a misnomer ; between ninety and ninety-five per cent of the population are Kurds. Turks consti tute hardly more than one per cent, mostly Government officials, and the remainder are Armenians, with a few Jacobites (near Mardin especially). The chiefs consider that the Great Powers should conduct proper investigations, when it would be found that these figures are approximately correct. In a very large part of the Turkish area the people speak only Turkish, and by travellers are assumed, therefore, to be Turks. Actually they are Kurds and tribesmen, with a national consciousness and a strong hatred of Turkish rule, demanding an independent Kurdistan, These Kurds are not by any means nomads-—vast numbers of them are settled town dwellers, and they are not savages. They ask for independence from Turkey, for a united Kurdistan, and for a Kurdish Government based on proportional representation and placed under the mandate of a European Power.” Captain Woolley states that he believes the Kurds have certainly an overwhelming majority in the six “ Armenian ” Vilayets and gives the following statement showing how the alleged population of 13,000,000 for Kurdistan is made up.— 121 — With regard to Kurdish relations with Turkey, Captain Woolley states :— “ The hatred of the C.U.P. Government is universal and very strong—there is a general desire to see Enver, Talaat, Jemal, and Halil executed by the Entente. A few individuals favour a measure of Turkish influence, mostly on religious grounds, feeling that so long as the relics of the Prophet are kept at Constantinople, even an Independent Kurdish Government was likely, qua Moslem, to fall again under the influence of Turkey. But these were few, and of them some said that, after all, the Turks were not good enough Moslems to be left in charge of those relics, and that they ought to be removed to Mecca, which would solve the political difficulty. None of the Kurds wanted to condemn the Turkish people as a whole ; it was the Government they hated, and, above all, the idea of Turkish government over themselves. The pro-Turk propaganda of C.U.P. agitators exists, but has very little effect. “ Relations with Armenians. “ They much resent the idea of the Armenians being recognized as the governing element in Kurdistan and being imposed on them against the wishes of the majority. If in any Kaza the Armenians should prove to have a numerical superiority, the Government of that Kaza ought to be preponderatingly Armenian, and the latter people ought to have their share of representation everywhere, but they ought not to monopolise the government. The chiefs said that they had no objections to the Armenians as such. Admittedly, some of the tribes have been guilty of massacres of Armenians, but they were instigated by the Turks ; other tribes have sheltered them from massacre.” Captain Woolley states that the Milli have a specially good reputation with the Armenians. He did not find amongst them any of that nervousness about possible punishment for Armenian massacres, which Major Noel found to be responsible for unrest further east. They pointed out to him that the Armenians who formed part of the Russian Caucasus Army had retaliated already. The Nationalist weekly review, “ Kurdistan,” in its last number, put down the number of Kurds massacred in the Van-Sitlis district at nearly 400,000, but they thought matters should stop there. A statement in the same number of “Kurdistan,” that the Americans at the Peace Conference were proposing two judicial inquiries for investigating the murders of the Armenians and also the murder of Kurds by Armenians, was accepted as a most satisfactory solution. TheKurds said : “ We have got to live side by side with them ; let us do so peacefully ” ; but they affirmed that any attempt to set up an Armenian Government over them would only lead to violence. They spoke rather bitterly of the presence and the behaviour of the Armenian troops in Adana. “ Generally speaking,' declares Captain Woolley, “ the Kurds have snatched eagerly at the idea of government according to the wishes of the majority (in so far as racial conditions are concerned) and have no doubt whatever as to the majority being themselves. They have followed the arguments of certain statesmen closely enough to feel that they have an indisputable right to make their wishes known and to have them put into effect.” u Relations with the Arab Government and the Entente. “ Small tribes like the El Aun and the Kitkin (especially the former), living on the edge of the Arab zone, are naturally inclined to favour the Arab Government, and even invite British interference to secure them against the Turks. The Barasi leaders say that, though they would like a Kurdish national government, they do not think it is practicable, as there is not sufficient unanimity amongst the tribes. Failing it, they would prefer to be under the Turkish Government which they knew of old, rather than under the Arab Government of which they know nothing. Further north there is no such hesitation. The people have no wish to be under the Arabs, and demand their own government. The lower classes want to live their own lives with as little foreign interference as possible ; the towns people want foreign commercial assistance and intercourse, but not foreign control; the upper classes realise that they cannot run the country themselves, and need material protection as well.” As to the form of government which the tribal leaders have m view, Captain Woolley says :— “ The whole idea is one of personal rule : at any rate, in t ie limited area I have visited, the patriarchal system is too deeply rooted to allow of anything else. Consequently, they look to a Princedom of Kurdistan on the lines of the Sherifian mgdom of Syria, working under a foreign mandatory with hmited pcwers : the governing class would be chiefly Kurdish, with a leavening of Armenians. The tribal system would be the basis of government. For the Princedom there are two candidates : Abd el Rizaq Bedra Khan Bey and Mahmud Bey ibn Ibrahim Pasha. J I inquired freely which of the two was the recognized— 123 leader. The Milli, of course, always named their own chief; men of other tribes were divided. Finally, I asked Mahmud Bey himself. He admitted he was a candidate, and said : ‘ In the past Abd el Bizaq’s family was greater than mine, and in some ways I should consider him a greater man than myself. On the other hand, the recent generations of Bedr Khans have not been very prominent; moreover, the family is not really Kurdish.’ (This is true, it is of the Beni Abbas ; but Mahmud’s family, too, is by no means pure Kurd ; it is largely Arab, and he would not be welcome by a large proportion of the Kurds.) ‘ My family is second only to his, and in recent times has eclipsed his. Anyhow, that is not a question which either Abd el Bizaq or I are entitled to settle ; it is in the hands of the Entente, and they ought to find out which of us the people want. I shall abide by that.’ ” The report includes the following character sketch of Mahmud Bey Ibn Ibrahim Pasha “ A rather slight and delicate man of about thirty, with a fine face ; dignified, well-mannered, but with some humour, and ready to laugh. Cannot read or write, but is intelligent and progressive; is very religious, but not narrow; seems peace-loving, as he professes to be ; is ambitious, but wants to be known as a benefactor. Prefers patriarchal customs to town innovations in private life, and he is a stickler for tribal tradition. Bitterly anti-Turk, and pro-English as far as is consistent with Kurdish nationalism ; is very frank in manner and is said to be truthful.” Arab Bureau Note. Competition for the Kurdish throne is increasing. A third applicant has appeared in the person of General Sherif Pasha, the Turkish Kurd who for many years has resided in France. In his offer to undertake the rulership of his troubled country, he states that if the choice of a leader were left to the tribes of Kurdistan, confusion and disorder would inevitably result, owing to a multiplicity of candidates, as each tribe considers its own chief superior to all others. The only scheme likely to promise success, says General Sherif, would be the appointment of a civilized chief of Kurdish race with European culture. This would give security for the impartiality of his administration towards the other elements which will be included in the subjects of the new State. General Sherif Pasha submits that he possesses all these desirable qualifications. It is understood, however, that the members of the Kurdish Independence Committee are unlikely to return for this self-sacrificing offer its due meed of gratitude.124 — With reference to the paragraph in our last number on the subject of Sherifian propaganda in Iraq, it is now thought that the word “ Rochan ” (page 92) is probably a telegraphic corruption of “ Kochar,” meaning the shepherd Kurds. Population of Diarbekr Vilayet. After an extended tour through the Diarbekr Vilayet, during which he was granted access to Turkish records, and had meetings with the heads of the different Christian communities, Major Noel has submitted the following estimate of the pre-war and present populations of this Vilayet. Pre-war Present Population. Population. Kurds 750,000 600,000 Armenians 120,000 20,000 Syrians 70,000 20,000 Chaldeans 11,000 3,000 Turks 3,000 2,500 Yezidis, Circassians, Greeks, etc. 10,000 8,000 Totals 964,000 653,500 Despite the fact that 75 per cent of the Armenian population is found in the northern half of the Vilayet, in Major Noel’s opinion there is, and was, even before the war, an overwhelming preponderance of Kurds in all districts. This confirms a similar statement made by Captain Woolley (see page 119 of this number). Major Noel draws attention to the discrepancies between the above figures and those given in the Report dated April 25 last by the General Staff, Tiflis, on the Armenian State. The numbers in the latter document were, he supposes, derived from Armenian sources : they are said to be grossly inaccurate, as no doubt are also the figures given for the other “ Armenian ” Vilayets. Medina. The following are extracts from the report submitted by El Miralai Sadik Bey Yahya on the Arab entry into Medina, of which a brief notice was given in our last number (page 90). After detailing the various demolitions carried out during the siege^ by the Turkish General, Fakhri Pasha, and giving his opinion that no wanton destruction was committed, El Miralai Sadik Bey proceeds as follows :— 14 Fakhri Pasha never ordered any place to be razed,or anything to be taken for military purposes, without the decision of the special committee which he had appointed for this purpose. “ He used to give orders to the Committee of Assessment about any place which was required to be demolished, and the committee, after fixing the price, posted an official notice on the wall of the building, giving the price and eight days’ period for the proprietor to appeal. The same measures were followed whether the proprietor was in Medina or not. Some proprietors of buildings demolished by the Government have officially received the prices of their buildings from the Mehkemeh Shariah and the president of the Town Buildings Commission, but there is a sum. of about L.T. 74,000 still owing to other landlords on this account. All cases are recorded in official schedules. “ The members of the Committee of Assessment included three landlords, the Municipal Engineer, and the chief Sheikh of the Masons, all of whom took the legal oath before the judge of the Mehkemeh on appointment. “ Property seized from the Houses and Shops of the Natives. “ As Medina was closely besieged, Fakhri Pasha urged the natives to emigrate to Syria at certain fixed tim.es, and therefore the natives left Medina for different places, chiefly Syria, leaving their heavy furniture and goccls in their locked houses and shops. “ When Fakhri Pasha found need of clothes, furniture, cooking utensils, etc., for military purposes, he sent the valuing committee to procure the things he wanted and to fix prices, and the house or shop from which things were taken was locked and sealed, and lists were made in the name of the proprietor. These lists are still in the possession of the Government, with the idea that the prices will be paid when the war is over. “ The Haram. “ The premises of the Holy Haram were found in good order. I had seen them before in 1909. Fakhri Pasha used a part of the Mosque for storing ammunition, and prevented visitors from going into the Mosque after sunset. “ I was informed by the present Mudir of the Haram, Mohammed Ghalib Bey (who was sub-Mudir before), that it was decided by the authorities in Constantinople to pull down the buildings around the Haram, and all were dealt with according to law.— 126 “ Supplies in Medina. “ In the latter days of the siege the condition of the natives was very bad, and all the people complained of it, as there was no merchandise, except very little brought in by the Bedouin, and this was taken by Fakhri Pasha for military purposes, only one quarter of it being sold to the natives. “ Goods used to come to Medina from different parts ot Arabia until five months before the surrender of Medina. During the last five months everything that came was from Wejh and Rabegh. “ Reception of the Arabs in Medina. “ The people of Medina were pleased to receive the Arab Government: they were very glad to feel that the days of starvation were at an end, that the clouds of distress and despair had dispersed, and that a prosperous future seemed possible. The people are of three classes as regards the view they take of the Arab Government, thus :— The first class —the poor and the labourers, etc. These people do not care what sort of government they have so long as they are able to earn a living and do not starve. The second class —the middle class of people, including the middle-class merchant. These were very few, and they are full of hope for the future. The third class —the upper class of people, the landlords, etc. I have questioned many of them separately as to their opinion of the Arab Government. They showed that they are not satisfied, and view the future with alarm and doubt, fearing that bad treatment will appear in future and that they will not enjoy their personal freedom nor security of their property and money, and that there will be no justice nor equality, no rest nor respect, for anybody. They stated that they had enjoyed justice and equality during the Turkish reign. Each of them used to drive in his carriage in Medina in perfect freedom and safety, and the Turkish Government collected no taxes from the natives, except the very small tax collected by the municipality for town cleaning. The sick received medicine free from the Wakfs dispensaries, and were also medically treated free at the Wakfs hospitals. Lawsuits were in the charge of the Shariah judge, and civil cases were in charge of a special court, presided over by the Qadi of the Mehkemeh Shariah and a police delegate, who acted as Attorney-General. There were several well-organized departments at Medina, like the Governorate, the Gendarmerie, the Police, the Municipality, etc.”— 127 “ Agriculture. “ Fakhri Pasha did no harm at all to agriculture or to the palm groves near Medina, except at the beginning of the war when the people of El Awali were hostile to him. He filled in some of their wells, but when the Arabs left that place he took great care of the cultivation and palm groves at the two fertile places, viz. El Ayun and El Awali. “ Fakhri Pasha bought 6,000 kilos, of wheat one month before the surrender, and planted it in the lands near El Ayun. The crop grew splendidly, until the blades were about ten inches high just before the entry of the Arab armies into Medina. The Arab troops soon after their arrival went with their camels, horses, mules, etc., to the cultivated area to graze their animals, and in seven days there was not a single blade to be seen. “ The Arab Entry into Medina. “ Emir Abdullah entered before Emir Ali in order to ensure public security in the town and prevent any looting, etc., but in vain. I regret to say that when I entered Medina on January 15 I found all the houses, which number over 4,800 and which were locked and sealed by the Turkish Government, had been broken open by the Arabs, who looted the furniture and sold it at very cheap prices in the Suk. The Ashraf and others who entered Medina with Emir Abdullah used to go from house to house and take what they liked, and they lived in the houses as they pleased. This went on for twelve days, even the houses whose owners were present at Medina being looted. “ It was not only the Bedouin who practised looting, but eighty per cent of the Baghdadi and Syrian officers took part in it with the help of their regular and Bedouin troops. Only one-eighth of the houses were saved from pillage. “ Our Egyptian doctor, Mohammed Huseini, and Dr. Hassan Raad of the Turkish Army, told me that they had seen six camels in front of some houses loaded with furniture, and they learned from the camel-men and others that the property belonged to a certain Baghdadi officer of the Arab Army. “ It was not until eighteen days after the occupation that police posts were put at the gates of the city. “ There was a large number of animals belonging to the Turkish Army, e.g. mules, camels, donkeys, and cows. Emir Abdullah issued an order to a certain Baghdadi officer called Jamil to take them over. The officer did so, and put the animals in a yard, giving them no food at all. It happened that I was passing this yard, and found all the animals in a very bad condition, nearly starved, and more dead than alive. They were dying at the rate of ten per day from lack of forage and water.“ On February 11 the Arab Commission took over the Treasury from the Turkish Administration, containing the sum of L.T. 60,078.56 in Turkish bank notes of different denominations, some to be repaid in gold by the Turkish Allies six months, and others one, three, four, five and six years, after peace.' NOTES. The Tdrisi. The following extracts are taken from the diary for April of Captain M. Fazl-ud-din, Medical Liaison Officer with the Idrisi:— “ The Idrisi has recently made a will, according to which he has appointed Seyyid Mustafa as his successor and guardian of his sons in case he dies before Seyyid Mustafa. The latter, should he succeed the Idrisi, is to nominate as his successor whichever of the Idrisi’s sons he considers fit and capable. “ This will was signed by his Ministers, and the Idrisi showed it to Seyyid Mustafa in the afternoon of the same day on which the circumcision of his son was performed. “ Hassan ibn Ali ibn Mohammed ibn Aidh (see page 98 of last number) is a shrewd and intelligent young man about thirty-two years old. He is a fine-looking person, with a small thickly grown beird, white complexion, large, keen, grey eyes, and a cheerful expression of the face. He is fairly well educated. During his week’s stay in Jeizin he deported himself in a very decorous and self-respecting manner, while his orderlies, sentries, and the rest of the 400 gendarmes who came with him observed all the Turkish military discipline. He has 1,000 regulars who were originally Turkish gendarmes, but are now in his pay. “ Hassan Ali’s preference of the Idrisi to the Sherif of Mecca is due to the following :— “ (1) Under the Idrisi he will enjoy a greater freedom of action than if he made submission to the Sherif. “ (2) The great enmity which exists between his sub-tribes and the Beni Shehr, who are his immediate neighbours and are under the Sherd’s suzerainty. “ (3) The preference of the people of Ebhah for the Idrisi. (4) The advice given to him by Muhieddin Pasha, late Governor of Ebhah. This officer consistently advised him to acknowledge Idrisi as his overlord rather than the Sherif. [Arab Bureau Note. In spite of our reports to the contrary, Hassen ibn Ali Aidh’s professions of loyalty to the Idrisi appear to be of doubtful sincerity: see the report of his brother’s recent visit to King Husein, page 131 of this number.]“ Tke King of Hejaz lias sent a small force to Qunfudali. The Idrisi exhibits himself touchy on this matter. He says : ‘ The British Government has asked me to keep quiet on this point, and to wait the final decision of the Peace Conference. Could not the British Government say the same thing to the Sherif of Mecca ? 5 “ The evil reputation of Sabia as being the home of fever— malarial in origin is, after all, not unfounded. I have discovered several mosquitoes of the anopheline type in the small stagnant pools of water scattered throughout the town. I have advised the Idrisi and others to have these pools obliterated, or at least to have them covered with a little kerosene oil every week to pre vent the breeding of mosquitoes. I hardly expect, however, that they will ever do anything of the sort, although a ready response of “ Marhaba” is always an encouraging and cheerful feature of their replies.'' Writing under date June 14, Captain Fazl-ud-Din reports as follows “ Ebhah Affairs. “ Sherif Hamud has returned from Ebhah. His mission, which was to bring down the arms and ammunition, etc., left by the Turks in Ebhah, Muhail, and Rijal el Ma', has been a total failure. He has brought back only 100 boxes from Muhail out of 900 boxes of ammunition there, and those, too, Suleiman Pasha, the Sheikh of Muhail, only gave him under cover of night, pretending that if given at daytime the people would not allow him to take a single cartridge. From Rijal el Ma' he has brought down to Shuqaiq two guns, which are probably out of order. Hassan Ali Aidh of Ebhah told him point blank that, as the people are not willing to part with a single cartridge, he cannot act against their wishes. The account of Sherif Hamud’s reception at Ebhah and Muhail is very interesting, and I shall give it later on, but it all shows that the Idrisi has very little prestige in those parts, and his suzerainty is only nominal. My informant, one of the Sheikhs who accompanied Sherif Hamud, tells me that Hassan bin Aidh or Suleiman Pasha are, however, quite unwilling to enter into any hostility with the Idrisi, whom they will recognize as their chief as long as they are not unnecessarily troubled by him. There is no representative of the Idrisi in Ebhah or Muhail at present, though there is one, Said Mustafa Nami, at Rijal el Ma” “ Tihamah. “ Everything is quiet in the Tihamah at present. The disturbances round about Salif and Zeidiyah have happily ended. Abdullah Mashhur, an ex-Turkish agent in Salif, has been— 130 superseded in his sheikhship of the Hashabirah tribe by Ismail, the other leading sheikh of the same tribe. “ Bajil. “ There is absolutely no truth in the report that the Idrisi desires to advance on Bajil (see page 98 of last number). The Idrisi does not desire to advance further south of Zeidiyah without our consultation.” Yemen. A document of pathetic interest was found amongst the papers of General Ali Said Pasha, late G.O.C. the Turkish Force in the Aden Hinterland. It is an unsigned and unaddressed letter, written, in German, by the naval officer in charge of the ill-fated party of Germans who, in a small sailing schooner, voyaged in the early part of 1916 from Java to Balhaf in the Hadhramaut, and from there travelled, via Lahej, to Loheiyah, embarking for Qunfudah, whence they marched to Jeddah, and afterwards were done to death by Harb tribesmen at Qadimah on the Medina road near Rabegh. (See pages 7, 18 and 148 of volume 1916). The text of the letter is as follows :— “ Bashara Fort, Abiyan, March 12, 1916. “ The German schooner, ‘ Weddigen,’ under the command of Captain Lieutenant Yon Muller, after a voyage of eighty days across the Indian Ocean, has arrived at Balhaf, Hadhramaut. The crew, consisting of six Germans under the Commander, has marched through Southern Arabia, and will reach Lahej to-morrow, and report to H.E. Said Pasha. “ This letter is brought by a mounted messenger of the Fadli Sultan, Husein ibn Ahmed ibn Abdullah, who has shown hospitality to the crew of the ‘ Weddigen.’ ” On the reverse is a note in Arabic from the Sheikh, Abdul Hadi ibn Mohammed Bamuzahim, who conducted the party through the Abiyan country to Lahej. It is dated March 11, 1916, and runs :— “ To H.E. Said Pasha, Commandant of the Islamic Army. “ Compliments. I write to you from the house of Sultan Husein ibn Ahmed Fadli after my arrival from the country of Ahwir on Sunday, March 11, 1916. We helped our dear Ahmed el Jafri and six Germans who asked us to accompany them to 3 r ou because they are strangers. We came with them for your sake and theirs, on account of our friendship with you. We will be with you on Tuesday, March 13, 1916.131 “ This is carried to you by Saleh ibn Haidar el Markashi and Ahmed ibn Abdullah Awad, the orderly of Sultan Husein ibn Ahmed Fadli. (Signed) Sheikh Abdul Hadi ibn Mohammed Bamuzahim.” It is of interest to note the evidence that these letters afford of the assistance which the Fadli Sultan gave to this adventurous party of Germans, who, it is felt, deserved a better fate than they met with at the hands of the Hejaz Bedouin, within five days’ distance of Medina, where safety awaited them. Yemen. The Political Resident, Aden, draws attention to encroach ments on our Protectorate boundary by the Imam. Zeidi troops have for some time been at Qataba, but, until recently, the Imam has refrained from sending men across the boundary. Lately, however, his troops have entered Sanah, which is south of Qataba, and on our side of the frontier. They are also reported to have visited Nawa and Rubi' aten, with the object of collecting taxes, and are said to be still in Nawa. Both these places are considered to be within the limits of our Protectorate. Ibn Rashid. Ibn Rashid was reported (June 26) to have arrived near Boreidah, where he was occupying himself in combating the Ikhwan movement at the request of the local tribes. It is not impossible that this had some connection with Ibn Sand’s speedy return to Riadh after the Tarabah affair. Hejaz. Colonel Wilson reports that Hassen ibn Aidh’s brother, Mohammed, of Ebhah, passed through Jeddah towards the end of June, on his way back to his country, after paying a visit to King Husein at Mecca. In the course of a conversation, after wards reported to Colonel Wilson, Mohammed stated that he had been to Mecca to protest the loyalty of his brother and all his people to Husein, also to complain about the way the Idrisi is constantly worrying Ibn Aidh and raising trouble against him. Mohammed is reported to have further said that Ibn Aidh and his followers look upon King Husein as their leader and wish to have nothing to do with the Idrisi.ARAB BULLETIN. It has been observed that there is a tendency to overlook the secret nature of the Arab Bulletin. Although, with the termination of hostilities, the need for secrecy may not now be important with respect to some of the contents, there is still certain Arabian Intelligence which ought not to be generally divulged, and, therefore, recipients of the Bulletin are requested to take steps to ensure that its secret character is respected.SECRET.

The Minister of War, Mecca, has forwarded a list of the Regular Arab officers killed in the fight at Tarabah on May 25. It includes eleven officers of the rank of Major and upwards, including Capitaine (Kaimakam in Arab Army) S. Raho of the French Army, who, it is understood, volunteered to serve with Emir Abdullah after the evacuation from the Hejaz of the few French troops he had commanded during the campaign. Emir Abdullah’s force, the strength of which was about 800, appears to have been somewhat over-officered, as, in addition to fifty- seven killed, a certain number were wounded and a few got away. Since the Nejd-Hejaz armistice, several Ikhwan raids on Hejaz villages are reported from Jeddah, one of which is said to have been made on July 1 at Dafinah, about sixty-five miles north of Asheirah. The Ateibah Sheikh who gave Colonel Wilson details of the affair stated that Sand ibn Abd el Aziz el Arrafah and Feisal (cousin and son, respectively, of Ibn Sand) were seen by him during the fight. He further stated that the Ikhwan cut the throats of sixteen women and children. Ibn Sand has promised the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, not to make any movements in the direction of Tarabah or Khurma, nor to allow his subjects to advance towards those places, provided the Hejaz Government makes no such movement. He has prohibited his people from performing the pilgrimage this year, and has announced that he has no intention of doing so himself. On the other hand, King Husein complains that Ibn Sand’s agent at Tarabah is attempting to collect Zikat, and this, in Husein’s view, amounts to a casus belli. The Hejaz Minister for Foreign Affairs, Emir Abdullah, has informed us that, should Ibn Sand’s forces approach further into the Hejaz, no resistance will be offered, and the country will be handed over en bloc to Ibn Sand. This declaration is probably put forward as an improvement on the abdication threat which has been repeated so often that it is now regarded as a matter of Hejaz routine and suitably ignored. It is evident from King Husein’s letters that no Arbitration Commission will be accepted by him which does not receive orders in advance to adjudicate in his favour. The present situation is that, whilst King Husein is awaiting a simple decision that the Khurma district belongs to the Hejaz, Ibn Baud remains at Riadh anxiously looking forward to our promised arbitration, the time and form of which, however, have not yet been decided by His Majesty’s Government. All efforts to obtain a correct account of the Nejd-Hejaz Treaty of 1910 have so far failed. Emir Abdullah has not134 succeeded in extracting from his father the copy he promised to Colonel Wilson, and it has also been found impossible to get one from Constantinople. It therefore remains for Ibn Saud to produce his original copy when the time comes for arbitration. The following translation of a letter addressed by Ibn Saud to one Yusef ibn Kanu, of Bahrein, gives the Nejd account of the Tarabah fight. The writer has almost exactly doubled the actual strength and armament of the Sherifian force. “ May 31, 1919. “ When we arrived at Sakhkhah we learnt that the inhabitants of Tarabah had treacherously joined the Sherif and, after plotting together, let him into Tarabah. We hastened to go there, and on arrival at Qunsaliyeh received detailed information which showed how Tarabah had been made over to the Sherif. It appeared, further, that after occupying Tarabah, the Sherif assembled the inhabitants and demanded that they should declare me and the Nejd people as heretics, and those who refused to do so were butchered. Then the Sherif told some of our men to. go to me and let me know all that had happened at Tarabah, and that he (Sherif) had come not only to take Tarabah but to take my head and to subjugate the whole of Nejd and Hasa. The Ikhwan in Khurma, on learning the fate of Tarabah and its inhabitants, became greatly excited. Then 2,000 of them marched out to avenge, and of these 500 were swordsmen carrying no other arms. The Sherif had 4,000 Turkish troops taken from Medina, 7,000 Hejazi troops (Bedouin ?) with 20 guns, 40 machine guns and large stores carried by nearly 10,000 camels. The Ikhwan attacked before dawn, while it was still dark. The Sherif was forewarned, and the fight lasted the whole day. Sherif Abdullah himself slipped out at the commencement with 50 horsemen and 200 camel riders ; but his men fought on and were nearly all killed, and everything belonging to them taken. Abdullah fled towards Taif. We are still in Watat (near Khurma), and intend to go to Tarabah soon. Of the Ikhwan only 150 were killed and 50 wounded, but none of them were notable people. I send you these glad tidings before going forward.” With reference to the account of the Khurma dispute given on page 111 of the last number of the Bulletin, Colonel C. E. Wilson points out that although Mr. Phil by has since attempted to show that the Emir of Khurma was not appointed by King Husein, he admitted in his article entitled “ A Journey across Arabia ” (page 74 of volume 1918) that that Emir (Khalid) was Husein’s nominee. r t— 135 — y A Letter from I bn Sand. The following translation (abridged) of a letter adressed by Ibn Sand to the Assistant Political Officer, Bahrein, is published as an example of this chiefs lucid communications as compared with the incoherent effusions that emanate from King Husein :— “ I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your friendly letter comprising the message of His Majesty the King-Emperor, and have forwarded to you the reply to a message which I had the honour to receive through His Majesty’s representative at Jeddah. “ As regards myself and the Sherif, according to my concluded treaties and the communications which were addressed by me, these constitute a strong proof for me of his aggression against me, for which he is solely responsible and not I, having acted up to my treaty obligations. If I had committed any aggression against him contrary to the terms of the treaty and the com munications, the blame would fall on me, and it is a well known fact to me that I have a right on my friends, the High Government, to punish the Sherif in accordance with the treaties. AVith regard to the discontinuance of my subsidy, I do not deserve to suffer this, because I have been always expecting more than that from His Majesty’s Government according to their previous promises, and I am sure they do not change their attitude; but if they are determined to stop it, God be praised, it would not adversely affect my honour, nor will it affect my financial position, neither can it come in the way of my friendship with my friends, His Majesty’s Government; may their honour be preserved. This, as a matter of fact, does not much matter to me, because of my confidence in them and their promises to me, and out of my carefulness I have always been taking precautions and even giving up most of my rights, in order to satisfy His Most Excellent Majesty the King-Emperor (may his honour be preserved), and also His Majesty’s High Government. Doubtless, the truthful will come out with his truth and the liar will be ruined with his lies.” Note on the Khurma and Tarabah Districts. The districts of Wadi Khurma, Wadi Tarabah, Wadi Sebei, and Wadi Raniyah form a fertile territory between Southern Hej az and Nejd and Northern Asir and Nejd. They are peopled by the powerful Ateibah, and the lesser, independent, tribes of the Sebei, Buqum, and Shallawah. These tribes have always been noted for their independence. During the last 100 years the dynasties of Nejd, Mecca, and Hail, according to the influence and power they possessed from time to time, have— 136 — each tried to bring these districts under their rule, but only Nejd has ever met with any success. In the time of the Great Sand (who ruled practically all Arabia from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, except the Yemen and southern districts, and who died in 1814) these tribes were subject to him, and the district formed part of Nejd. This state continued till the flight of a later Saud dynasty to the Basra coast, after which the district became a bone of contention between the newly risen power of Rashid and the Emirate of Mecca, who were constantly in dispute regarding their territorial boundaries and spheres of influence. Upon the decline of the Rashid power in Nejd, the Turkish Government handed the districts over to the Emir of Mecca, who sent Sherif Sultan ibn Raga to Tarabah as his representative, but, according to reports, the tribes have never accepted the Government of Mecca, which has never been able to do more than exercise merely a local influence over them, because the majority of them follow Wahabism. Possibly also the tribesmen were influenced by the fact of the Saud rulers being further away from them, and thus less likely to meddle with them than the Emirs at Mecca. The tribes of the Ateibah living in these districts are chiefly confined to the wadi and village of Khurma. They belong to the Roqah section (Ruqbah division) of this powerful combination, and their dim lies north of the El Harith (pronounced El Hurut), an Ashraf clan, who are found south of Wadi Khurma. The Ateibah do’ not appear to enter much into the political activities of the village of Khurma, but confine themselves more to the wadi. The Sebei have their homeland in the Wadi Raniyah and Wadi Tarabah, and form the greater part of the settled population of Khurma. About three-quarters of them are Wahabi and regard the Meccans as kafirs, but the remainder come under the influence of the Grand Sherif. Ibn Saud endeavoured to collect Zikat from them in 1918, but did not meet with much success. They appear, however, to acknowledge him as their head and look to Nejd for protection, as many of their families, have definitely settled in Nejd. In the days of the Great Saud, the whole tribe was Wahabi, and it is only since the Turks grabbed this territory for the Mecca Emirate that the influence of Mecca has penetrated into the tribe. and the wadi. They live chiefly by. robbery and violence, and merchants from Mecca, visiting the town of Turabah, go there in mortal dread of the “ Evil Buqum.” In the days of the Rashid power they fought for Ibn Rashid against the Saud dynasty. Ibut since the decadence of the Hail Emirate they have favoured Ibn Baud. The Shallawah frequent Wadi Khurma and Tarabah. The majority favour Wahabism, and are more under the influence of Nejd than Mecca. It is said that this tribe is a section of the Huqah sub-division of the Ateibah. They are, with the Sebei and Buqum, sandwiched between their rivals, the Ateibah and the Qahtan, in the south-west of Nejd, and quite possibly this arbitrary position between these powerful neighbours is largely responsible for the good fellowship existing between all three tribes. The Qahtan are said to be mostly Wahabi, and their influence is greater than that of the Ateibah. The town of Khurma contains about 4,000 to 5,000 inhabi tants, and is occupied chiefly by Sebei tribesmen, though there is said to be a small colony of the Beni Zeid. The remainder are Shallawah. Very little appears to be known regarding the Beni Zeid, but it is reported to be of Qahtan stock. H. Goldie. Arab Bureau Note. The foregoing account should be compared with that given by Mr. Philby in the 1918 Volume (page 74). A Conversation with Emir Abdulla. In a conversation with Colonel Wilson, Emir Abdullah said that the Sebei tribe had remained loyal, and its head-sheikh, Mishari ibn Nasir, had stayed at the Emir’s headquarters throughout the Khurma trouble. The Buqum Sheikhs of Tarabah had also sent deputies, since the removal of the Nejd forces from there, to inform Abdullah that they were ready to join the King as soon as an adequate Sherifian force should arrive at Tarabah to restore the situation. Emir Abdullah asserted that Ibn Sand was aiming at the suzerainty of Arabia. The Bedouin were hypnotized by the vehement preaching of Ikhwan missionaries, and this fact, coupled with the desire of the Arabs for freedom of movement and trade between Hejaz and Nejd, is responsible for the success which has attended Ibn Baud’s efforts to extend his following. In Abdullah’s opinion Ibn Saud has the intention of organizing a great Wahabi revival and of becoming lord over all the territory once held by his ancestor. With regard to the alleged Husein—Ibn Rashid rapproche ment, Abdullah said the only definite arrangement that had been made against Ibn Saud was during the latter stages of the Medina siege, when Ibn Rashid agreed to attack Ibn Saud in the rear and flank, should the latter attempt to advance to the__ 138 — assistance of Fakfiri Pasha. Abdullah further stated that no treaty had been made by the King with Ibn Rashid ; the affair had never got beyond preliminary negotiations. Ibn Rashid had stipulated for the return to him of Kheibar, Teima, and Huwaiyat, but the King had replied that though there could be no question about Kheibar (it being essentially a Hejaz village), he would be prepared to “ further discuss ” the cession of Teima and Huwaiyat after Ibn Rashid had proved his allegiance. Emir Abdullah conveyed to Colonel Wilson a verbal message from King Husein. The' King declared that he wished to be regarded by the Moslem world as a man who had helped to uplift and strengthen Islam. He had always realized that, to achieve this, Turkey must be replaced by another Moslem Power of sufficient stability and importance to ensure the respect of the Moslem countries generally. He considered that the Arab Government could not be recognized as a fitting successor to the Turkish power unless there were one suzerain over all the integral parts of the newly freed Arab countries. That there must be divisions of Government, each practically autonomous, he did not dispute, but a nominal head is essential. He has never urged this from motives of personal ambition but in the belief that only by such means can the best interests of Islam be served. ' The King further said that the Hejaz Government is very feeble at present and can only look to Great Britain for support. He confidently expected that support would be supplied until the new Government is firmly established. He was aware of the risk of rumours getting abroad in the Moslem world that Great Britain is laying hold of the Hejaz, but, he said, such rumours carry less weight since the defeat of Turkey than they did before. He believes that Moslems who have become uneasy on this score will gradually realize that the work undertaken by him, with the aid of Great Britain, has been in the best interests of Islam. King Husein, Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud. We have now received from Jeddah a copy of Ibn Rashid's recent letter to Emir Abdullah (see page 118 of last number). It was despatched on June 17, from El Shaibah, two days’ ride from Hail, and in it Ibn Rashid stated he had promised the people of Jebel Shammar that he would raid Boreidah. The interesting part of the communication is, however, an appendix written by Ibn Rashid’s secretary, Mohammed el Mughreibi (see page 338, volume 1918). The latter wrote that on May 23 a special messenger arrived at the camp of Ibn Rashid with a letter and a verbal message from Ibn Saud. The verbal message was to— 139 — the effect that Ibn Sand offered to Ibn Rashid half the revenue of El Hasa and the Customs receipts of Qatif, “ as well as anything else ” he may want, if he would combine with Ibn Sand against the Sherif. Such an offer seems too good to be refused, but Mohammed el Mughreibi is known to us as somewhat of a raconteur, and it is not unlikely that the story i« a fabrication of his for use in blackmailing Emir Abdullah. The letter from Ibn Sand to Ibn Rashid made no suggestion whatever of co-operation against the King nor of the alleged remuneration. It merely conveyed an embroidered account of the Tarabah fight, and gave a very exaggerated estimate of the Sherifian forces engaged. “ The Sherif had with him,” wrote Ibn Saud, “ 4,000 Turkish soldiers who were at Medina and 7,000 men of Hejaz, together with 20 guns, 40 machine guns and provisions and ammunh tion on 10,000 camels, while our ‘ Ikhwan ’ numbered only 2,000, and of these 500 were even without any hrms except swords and knives. The Sherif had made trenches as deep as the height of a man, and fortifications, and had placed guns and machine guns in every position. The c Ikhwan ’ started their advance' at midnight, and attacked from morning. The battle lasted all day and the next night until the Sherif and his men were defeated and fled to El Baida, near Taif, with 200 camel and horsemen. The rest were killed by the ‘ Ikhwan,’ who also captured their enemy’s possessions and forwarded to me the good news when I had just left El Qunsaliyah. I am now near Khurma on my way to Tarabah.” Mohammed el Mughreibi further stated that Ibn Rashid contemptuously refused Ibn Saud’s verbal offer, and replied : “ I am preparing to pursue you, Ibn Saud, so beware!” Mohammed el Mughreibi rounded off his appendix with a request that L.E. 12,000 should be sent to Ibn Rashid. King Husein informed Colonel Wilson that under no circumstances would he send money or supplies, and promised also that he would advise Ibn Rashid to refrain from making attacks on Nejd. The King, however, appears to have his own particular way of refusing a request, for in his reply to Ibn Rashid, a copy of which has now come to hand, he says : “ Oh, Rashid, every thing you may think we may do for you can be done either in one way or another. Consider that everything is at your disposal. Do not be afraid to let me know everything you want.” He closes with a request that Ibn Rashid should instruct Shammar pilgrims to travel via Hail, Medina, and the Harb routes, “ be cause,” he goes on to explain, “ we cannot protect our tribes from the wandering people of Nejd.”— 140 The Harb Tribe. The following note on the Harb tribe has been received from Major H. Goldie :— “ This warlike tribe of the Hejaz may be regarded as a confederation of powerful tribes. It is divided into two large divisions, known as Beni Masruh and Beni Salem. “ The Beni Masruh inhabit the country directly east of Medina and Mecca, and their homelands stretch north-east towards Hail and east towards Nejd, while they also lie south of Mecca and in the country between Mecca and Jeddah. “ The Beni Salem stretch from Bir el Sheikh, between Mecca and Medina, on the Darb el Sultani, to Medina and Yanbo. “ The genealogy of the Harb is curious. The Beni Salem claim two ancestors, Meimun and Marowha, whereas the ancestor of the Beni Masruh is Masruh. The Beni Masruh is the stronger and the more powerful side of the confederation. Their chief tribes are the Beni Amr, the Beni Zubeid, and the Beni Awf. The Beni Amr can collect 6,000, the Beni Zubeid 4,000, and the Beni Awf 8,000 combatants. For the last thirty years there has been a blood feud between Husein ibn Mubarak, Chief Sheikh of the Beni Zubeid, and Ahmed ibn Asim, of the same tribe, who has perhaps more influence with the sub-tribes than Husein ibn Mubarak. The tribes of the Beni Salem side of the con federation are divided under the names of their ancestors, Meimun and Marowha. The Meimun tribes can collect about 7,000 combatants, the stronger tribes being the El Ahamda, El Subh, Walud Mohammed and El Bihalah. The Marowha tribes can mobilize about 5,000 combatants, the stronger sub-sections being the El Hawazim, the El Ridaadah, and the El Hajelah. “ The Harb confederation is ruled by a council of Sheikhs, which meets whenever a question affecting the whole tribe arises. The two most powerful sheikhs in the confederation are the brothers, Khalef ibn Khadeifi and Khalil ibn Khadeifi. They are the chief Sheikhs of the Meimun side of the Beni Salem. The Emir of the Harb tribe is nominated by the Grand Sherif of Mecca. The Emirate of the tribe is a nominal office only, and in the councils of the tribe the holder carries no more power than the other members. He is, however, the mouthpiece of the council in negotiations/’ Major Goldie has sent in a detailed list of the sub-tribes of the Harb, and this will be published in due course.— 141 — Moslem Anti-British Propaganda. The Ahmadia Movement. The following notes are taken from an account of the Ahmadia movement written by Major V. Vivian :—- “ The Mirzai, Ahmadia or Quadiani sect (so called from the names and the residence of the founder) is a schismatic sect of Islam, founded in the second half of the nineteenth century by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, in the Gurdaspur district of the Punjab. “ Its chief point of difference from orthodoxy lies in its belief in the death of Jesus Christ on the Cross, as against the ordinary Islamic belief of His substitution by an ordinary felon. Besides this, there is a tendency to minimize the importance of the Khalifa of Islam as ordinarily accepted, and to turn in all matters of doc trine and faith to the head of the sect. “ In its early days it was notable for great fanaticism, being particularly violent against both Hinduism and Christianity. “ The original founder arrogated to himself miraculous powers and also the gift of prophecy. To establish belief in these inspired functions it was proved that more than once recourse was had to human means for the accomplishment of events foretold in the course of his former prophecies : thus, when this sect was in the throes of a bitter controversy with the Arya Samaj, a conspiracy of Ahmadis and Indian Wahabis brought about the death of Lekhraj, the Arya preacher, in order to bring to fulfilment Ghulam Ahmad’s prophecy of his death. s ‘ On the death of the original founder, one of his most learned disciples, Bashir ud Din Mahmud Ahmadi, assumed the cloak of leadership, and under his regime the sect abandoned in a certain degree the policy of aggressive fanaticism, and found outlet in a wide missionary programme. Bashir ud Din was followed by Mirza Nur ud Din, who is still alive. During his predecessor’s leadership the programme of proselytism gained violent stimulus from the activities of Khwaja Kamal ud Din, a man of great education and experience. “ When Nur ud Din assumed leadership, a split occurred in the Ahmadi camp, owing to the fact that Nur ud Din wished, as an individual, to assume all the prerogatives of the leadership, while Khwaja Kamal ud Din wished them to be vested in a committee, in which he would have the preponderance of influence. At the present time, therefore, the sect is divided into two parties, one of which is known as the Lahore party, and the other as that of Quadian. Khwaja Kamal ud Din, who leads the142 — former, has for some years engaged in the worldwide missionary effort for which this sect is now best known. Having collected a large sum of money from his adherents, he proceeded to England, and, with others, founded the. Mosque at Woking, and the several magazines and institutions which are run in connection with it. As there is no other outstanding Islamio organization in Europe, the Ahmadi party there is apt to attract all shades of Mohammedan travellers, and has gained a degree of influence which may now need a certain amount of scrutiny. “A notable point about the Ahmadi programme is the care with which their missionaries are selected and the preparations which are made to render their efforts successful. No expense is spared in finding men of modern European education, and training them in Oriental languages in order to fit them to hold their own in both European and Oriental countries. “ The groups surrounding the Mosque at Woking contain a Certain number of persons who are not without suspicion of pro- Turkish leanings. Khwaja Kamal ud Din has been successful in converting to his particular shade of Islam a number of English people, most of whom are pro-Turkish cranks. The London agent of the sect is Mufti Mohammed Sadiq, 4, Star Street, Edgeware Road. “ Being the only organized group of Mohammedans in England they form a rallying ground for nearly all Mohammedan visitors to England, and are connected with various circles and societies which dabble in £ Near-Eastern’ politics. “ The treatment of the sect by the Government is a matter of delicacy, as the sect in India is given to the expression of ultra- loyal sentiments. The activities of its members abroad, however, afford some reason to think that its tendency is in the direction of anti-European feeling, while the wide scope and rapidity of its development suggest that the purely religious precepts by which it is at present fostered may in time give way to political activities. “ In whatever way it may for the moment be regarded, it is, without doubt, a movement which merits much closer attention than it has hitherto received from the authorities of those countries where the population is largely Mohammedan. There are in unknown—in Egypt. ££ The Ahmadis have lately produced a de luxe edition of a translation into English of the Koran, with an elaborate com mentary, which interprets it on the lines of modern thought. The Ahmadis make no secret of their activities, and push their propaganda by all the modern methods of advertisement.” isA Turkish Circular. The following extracts are taken from a leaflet in the Turkish language, which has recently been scattered broadcast in Central Asia :— “To All Moslems in Asia! “ Brothers ! The British are bent on conquest. They and their Allies have succeeded, by stratagem and treacherous diplomacy, in getting possession of Mecca, Medina, Baghdad, Syria, Jerusalem, Nejef, Kerbela, Sum, and Meshed. The King of England instigated the President of the American Bepublic to take up arms against the Ottoman Government and its Allies in order to get rid of all rivals. These English and Americans, contrary to all promises, advanced on Constantinople and Anatolia, and have reduced to shreds the Turkish Dominions, because they wish to drive the Turks out of Europe. “ The British are opposed to this spirit of freedom and equality, and are especially afraid of its spreading in Asia, particularly in India, where the awakening of the Indian Moslem is feared. They are averse to the independence, awakening, freedom, and self-government of Indian Mohammedans. As the world is now being flooded with brotherliness the British want to oppose this freedom. Therefore they advanced into Turkistan. At Brest Litovsk, at a Peace Conference between Russians, Germans, and Turks, all past and future enmities and hostilities were set aside and a great friendship was formed. To-day there is not a single form of humane government which has not accepted Bolshevic methods, enthusiasm, and sincerity.” “ Look at the following countries which should serve as a warning to you—India, Egypt, Tunis, Algiers, Morocco, Ireland and others. These countries are living, innocent examples. It behoves you, therefore, to sink all private and tribal grudges and to enter the arena of the real government of the people, and to assist in driving out the British, who are enemies of humanity and authority and are the traditional foes of Islam.” “Be it known that as a result of this protracted war the British soldier refuses any longer to fight. In the British Isles a revolution of workmen and labourers is taking place. Ireland has separated herself from the British Empire and become independent. Therefore your help will not only be valuable to all friendly governments and save Turkistan, but will also assist in freeing Holy Islamic centres and the Ottoman dominions.” (Signed) Mohammed Kasim, Captain, Ottoman Delegate appointed to Afghanistan.

The British agent, Jeddah, reports that there are indications that attempts are being made in the Hejaz to revive the Anjuman-I-Khuddam-I-Kaaba. An Indian merchant of Mecca* Abdul Jabbar, and other notables of that town, are alleged to d)e in favour of a Wahabi conquest, and the British agent suggests that financial support is probably being received from sympathizers in India, such as Ali Jan of Delhi. NOTES. The Ikhwan. In a report (dated July 20, 1919) from Damascus it is alleged that Wahabism is on the wane in Nejd. Feisal el Der- wish, head of the Muteir tribe, whose name was previously given by the Assistant Political Officer, Basrah (see page 86 of this volume), as leader of the Ikhwan, is said to have offered his services to Emir Ali at Medina, and to have been sent with Emir Dhari ibn Rashid (see pages 111, 121 and 224, volume 1918), and a composite following of Muteir, Harb, and Huteim tribesmen* to raid Ibn Saud. According to a report made by the Political Officer, Deraa, who presumably got his information from Dhari ibn Rashid himself, the raid was carried into Nejd and Feisal was killed. As a result, the Muteir joined up with the Sherif. The Political Officer, Deraa, asserts that the Harb have re nounced Wahabism after “ a defeat by Sherif Ali, who destroyed their headquarters.” Hamed el Derwish is said to be the present leader of the Ikhwan. Yemen. King Husein has proudly sent for our perusal two letters of submission he has lately received from certain Seyyids and Sheikhs of the Southern Yemen and of the northern limits of the Aden Protectorate. Apparently, the King has again employed Seyyid Yahya ibn Abdul Rahman el Filani (see page 99 of this volume) on a political mission, for the writers of the letters state that this Seyyid has arrived amongst them, and, as the envelopes bear the imprint “ Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co., Jeddah,” Seyyid Yahya would appear to have taken with him the stationery needed for preparing these documents of allegiance. Addressing the King as Caliph, Emir el Muminin and a variety of other more or less appropriate titles, the writers affirm their willingness to provide him with troops for use against any a renemy whatsoever. The include Seyyid Ahmed Ali Pasha of Taiz, Abdul Wahab Na’aman of Hajariyeh, Emir Nasr of Dhala, and his brothers, also various Seyyids, Sheikhs, and notables of Nawa, Rube'atein, Riyashia, and Udein. They quote with enthusiasm an article which appeared in the “ Qibla,” calling upon the Arabs of all parts of Arabia and Syria to combine, but judging by the names of the signatories, Seyyid Yahya appears to have confined his propagandist activities to anti-Zeidist partisans. There is nothing in the letters to show whether all the 1 persons who signed them were assembled in one place, or whether Seyyid Yahya simply travelled from town to town requesting the different Sheikhs to add their signatures to the letter he had already prepared. The latter was, however, more probably the course adopted. Kurdistan. The following paragraphs are extracted from the Supplement to General Headquarters Intelligence Summary dated August 4, 1919 “ Pro-Sherifian Propaganda. In connection with the recent Sherifian propaganda and consequent unrest amongst the Jais Arabs, it is interesting to note that Saleh el Abdullah, chief of the Siyara tribe, has in formed the Officer Commanding British Detachment at Urfa, that he signed the petition asking for government by the Sherif, because he understood that the British and Sherifian governments were working together and were practically one. He said that he had no wish to be ruled by an independent Sherifian govern ment.” “ Tribal Unrest in the Urfa Area. Hachim Bey and Mojeim Bey recently visited Aleppo, and had an interview with the British authorities. As a result it is hoped that a meeting between the representatives of the Anazeh and the Milli will shortly take place in order to settle the tribal feuds which have, for a long time, been disturbing this area. Mahmud Bey has already been summoned to Urfa, but has written a letter saying that the Turkish authorities are putting obstacles in his way and are interfering with his correspondence.” Abyssinia. The legation at Addis Abbaba reports that by the middle of June legation work had become almost impossible. The— 146 — heir apparent was quite unable to make decisions, owing to his waning power, and there had been some quarrelling in public between him and the Fitaurari. The situation improved, how ever, towards the end of the month and a second reconciliation was effected^ His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires points out that it is no longer a question of differences between the Empress and the Minister of War on one side, and the Has on the other, but it is now rather a strife between the Conservative and Progressive elements of the country, and, as the Progressive party counts but few members besides the Eas himself, it practically amounts to a national movement against the heir to the throne. The representatives of the European Powers at Addis Abbaba advised the Eas to form an Executive Council of four chiefs, including himself, in order to do away with the present un satisfactory dual control. Fitaurari Hapti Georgis was also approached, and he agreed that the formation of such a council would offer a solution of the existing difficulties. He considered, however, that it should be constituted of twelve members, no doubt being actuated by a desire to respond to the public agitations for the reinstatement of the Ministers who were dis missed a year ago. The improvement in the political situation was maintained in July. Outwardly at least, Eas Taffari and the Fitaurari were more friendly than before. The Abuna, Eas Kassa, Eas Taffari, and the Empress were interviewed, and expressed themselves as satisfied with the existing state of affairs and did not consider any change in Government, such as the proposed Council, was necessary. Indeed, the Empress went so far as to say that it was the will of Providence that there should be bad Governments all the world over at the present time, and therefore Abyssinia was not being punished more severely than any other country. It would seem that it is not in politics alone that Eas Taffari is progressive. He was actively engaged during July in precipi tating a dollar crisis by promiscuously issuing permits for the export of dollars to whomsoever was prepared to offer a suitable bribe. A campaign against the rebels in the south was about to begin in June, whilst in the east an expedition to suppress the Ogaden was being planned. We have not yet heard whether either scheme matured. Considerable excitement was caused at Addis Abbaba by the receipt of communications from the Abyssinian Mission in France, urging the immediate despatch of Eas Taffari and other influential chiefs to Paris, but it was eventually decided to hold up the matteruntil a meeting of the chiefs could be held. The various leaders are eager that their country should gain admittance to the League of Nationsas an Independent State, but it has been pointed out to them that the present chaotic condition of their Govern ment will not stand in their favour at the Council meetings in Paris ; and, further, that it will be necessary for them to be able to offer guarantees for the due fulfilment of the pledges that are expected from States permitted entry into the League. Later news (August 4) from Addis Abbaba explains that Has Seyyum will not be able to attend the meeting of Chiefs, as he has been compelled to turn back, his eon Dejaz Kassa having again risen in Tigre. The British Charge d’Affaires reported (August 12) that a plot to arrest Has Taffari had been discovered, but the nominees of the new Government which was being formed had so far adhered to the Empress. In the, north the situation in the Tigre revolt was serious. Ras Gugsa was on his way to attend the meeting of Chiefs. Libya. Seyyid Mohammed El Idris is making a pilgrimage this year, and recently left Egypt for Jeddah, accompanied by two Italian officers, on an Italian warship. He took with him L.E. 100,000 in gold. The sum seems unusally large for a two months’ trip ; but it is not the first time, since the lavish subsidization of mendicant States was introduced, that an Arab potentate, about to start on an excursion, has somewhat amply provided himself with funds. Mohammed Idris, however, perhaps intends to make benefactions at the Holy Cities, or, more probably, his action may be prompted simply by an anxiety to ensure that, for his party, the pilgrim roads shall be as safe as they are advertised to be.Extracts from a f^lote on the “ Skhwan ” IVSovement. By Major H. R. P. Dickson, Political Agent, Bahrein. On my recent visit to Hasa to meet Ibn Sand I tried to dis cover as much about the “ Ikhwan ” movement as possible. This I found a rather difficult task, as wherever I made enquiries I seemed to be looked upon with suspicion. It was obvious to me that people had been given the hint, by some one in authority, to give away as little as possible, and I was forced to the con clusion that Ibn Saud himself was at the bottom of the matter. I believe now that he had issued instructions that as little as possible regarding the new movement should be divulged to strangers. The reason for this is, I think, not far to seek. Firstly, Ibn Saud is alarmed at the notice which the outside world has taken of the movement; secondly, he is annoyed to think that such advertisement has been brought about by wild and exaggerated reports as to the goings-on of the Ikhwan ; thirdly, he realizes that in some quarters the movement is looked upon with distrust and alarm ; and, lastly, he does not want it to be known that he himself is at the bottom of the movement and is fostering and guiding it for his own ends. Generally speaking, Ikhwanism does not appear to be the entirely bad movement it is made out to be. It seems to be a genuine religious revival; an attempt on the part of the masses of Central Arabia to improve themselves religiously and mentally, and especially is it an attempt to purify Islam of all the many evils which contact with so-called European influence has brought in its train. However that may be, touching the actual ideas and ambitions of men like Ibn Saud, it is certain that the masses are genuinely stirred by a very intense enthusiasm and desire to live better lives. The Ikhwan consist, principally, of the ignorant classes, and the movement may be said to include all the Bedouin tribes of Nejd and adjacent countries. The more educated classes, such as townsmen and merchants, are nearly all orthodox Wahhabis, and though these do not approve of some of the tenets of the Ikhwan, more especially their earlier intolerance, they consider the movement God-given and an infinitely preferable state of affairs to the beast-like ignorance and idolatry which existed among the Bedouin previously. It is true that the original movement took the most fanatical form, but under Ibn Baud’s firm and tactful guidance it has lost most of its unreasonable bigotry, and its members now devote them selves to self-improvement and prayer, whereas, before, their— 104 — only thought was forcible conversion and interference with others. It is on record that when the Ikhwan first appeared in the streets of Hofuf, the capital of Hasa, they beat any women they found in the streets, and shot in cold blood many a citizen whose only crime was that he was seen smoking cigarettes. At that time Ibn Saud and Ibn Juluwi (the Emir of Hasa) had summarily to shoot several of the Ikhwan before they could bring.them to their senses. Things, however, are vastly changed now, and both Ibn Saud and his lieutenants have the movement well in hand. The only possible danger of its getting out of control lies in the creation of some deep and universal resent ment of a religious nature. At the present moment such a dan ger exists in the refusal of King Hussein to allow Nejdis to go to Mecca. This is the only anxiety Ibn Saud has at the present moment in his dealings with the Ikhwan. He is anxious about the future, and made repeated requests to me to warn His Majesty’s Government about the high feeling that was running throughout Nejd. In a general sense, Ikhwanism may be said to be a revival of Wahhabism. It is, however, in no sense a heresy, but an ascetic movement among Moslems to revive the Salih school of Sunnism, as taught by the Imam Ahmed. Ibn Saud is at the head of the movement, and on one occasion, when I asked about the Ikhwan, he said, “ I am the Ikhwan.” According to Ibn Saud, the attack on the Wahhabis by Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian, in 1817, by order of the Sultan, was not so much because the religion of Nejd offended as that a personal insult had been offered to the Sultanate of Turkey by the Emir of Nejd, who ordered her caravan to turn back from Medina. At the time, however, it was considered by Turkey to be a political move to make out that Wahhabism was a menace to orthodox Islam. As we know, the result of Ibrahim Pasha’s campaign in Nejd in 1817 was the destruction of Dharai- yah, the capital, and the carrying off of the Emir Mohammad ibn Saud to Egypt. This crushed Wahhabism for a time, and rendered Nejd innocuous as a menace to orthodox Islam, as the Sultan knew it. Wahhabism, however, has existed ever since throughout Nejd and in parts of Oman, Trucial Coast, Hasa and elsewhere, though not in a militant form. A Short History of Ikhwanism. The actual date of the new revival under the name of Ikhwan is difficult to determine. Certain it is that up to five years agothe term “ Ikhwan ” was practically unknown. It is also certain that the few members of the sect, though existing in the town ship of Artawiyah, always a fanatical spot, played no part in the recovery of Nejd by Abdul Aziz, the present Imam, in 1902. It was only after 1913, when Ibn Saud, the present ruler, recover ed Hasa from the Turks, that the movement first came under his notice. In 1914-1915 the term came into general use and began to spread to an alarming extent. It was then that Ibn Saud decided to turn his attention to Ikhwanism as a means of strengthening and consolidating his power over the many dis ruptive elements with which he had to contend in Nejd and his new dominions generally. To-day the principal religious leader of the Ikhwan is Sheikh Abdul Karim el Mughrabi. This individual was, at one time, Chief Alim to the late Salih Pasha el Sadun, Sheikh of the Muntafiq. He later became Alim to Mizal Pasha, father of the present Ibrahim Bey el Sadun. He left the latter’s service, however, and departed to Nejd, where he established himself as Alim in the Wahhabi town of Artawiyah. Among other Ikhwan leaders we have Ibn Abdul Latif (Qadi of Riadh) and Sheikh Isa (Qadi of Hasa). That Ibn Saud has been forced to associate himself with the movement and become its leader, there is, I think, little doubt. Probably, in the first place, he thought to make use of it to strengthen his position, but in the end he found he was forced to spread its doctrines and become its leader, lest he should go under himself. It would appear that in 1915 or 1916 Ibn Saud found that Ikhwanism was definitely getting control of affairs in Nejd. He saw that he had to decide between being a temporal ruler and crushing Ikhwanism, or becoming the leader of a new kind of Wahhabism. He decided on the latter course as being the less risky. Having once taken them up, he saw that it was vital to get the members of the new cult under proper control. There was a danger of their running amuck both in the direction of Hejaz and Iraq. He issued his famous order in 1916 that all Bedouin of Nejd and Arabia must join the movement and must pay him zikat as their recognized leader. This led to much fighting and was incidentally one of the reasons which led to the resis tance of the Ajman tribes in Hasa in 1915. It may be said that Ibn Saud, during the years 1916-17-18, was engaged in one continuous series of wars with his recalcitrant tribesmen and was rarely able to visit Riadh. In 1918 he had already forced all the Bedouin of Nejd (except the Ajman) to adopt Ikhwanism and to recognize him as their Imam. In order to. 1 ensure the behaviour of these tribes, and to keep them under his control, he induced his religious leaders to issue a Fatwah that it was necessary that the Ikhwan should build themselves cities and till the soil, this being incumbent on them from a religious point of view, and a necessary measure to divide them from the jahl (ignorant ones), the term given to those Bedouin who had not adopted Ikhwanism. The order appears to have been responded to with enthusiasm in most cases, and I understand from Ibn Saud that there are already sixty-three new cities in Nejd, all of which have come into being within the last four years. The progress of the movement step by step has been most cleverly managed, and Ibn Saud has showed great genius in working out his scheme without estranging his people. He has been able to instil a wonderful enthusiasm for Ikhwanism among the Bedouin, until to-day all are anxious to join the movement. It has now become a matter of pride with a Bedou to call him self a Hadhar, or town-dweller, as opposed to the term jahil (ignorant one). The skill with which the tribes have been forced into the movement and compelled to settle down and plough without feeling resentment at the change shows Ibn Saud to be no ordinary leader. He has given the wandering tribes a stake in the land, and has definitely made them “ settled ” tribesmen, while he has left the system sufficiently elastic to allow of portions of each tribe to remain throughout the year in the desert tending their camels. The selection of the site for each new town is made entirely by Ibn Saud himself. The reason why the Ajman tribe has been so long in joining is because they know of Ibn Sand’s determination to “ bring them to heelthoroughly and in a fashion all his own. This is to take more or less the following form and, to one who knows the Bedouin, is a really harsh punishment. The Ajman are to be transferred to Nejd as a whole, and are there to be broken up, each of the twenty different sections of the tribe being split up among the different new townships of the Ikhwan. In this manner their power for doing evil will be broken. Ibn Saud says tiiat they twice played the traitor to him : once in the fight with Ibn Rashid near Majma' in March 1915, and again in 1916, when they attacked and nearly overcame him in Hasa. Since then they have been successfully playing fast and loose with him, sometimes living in Kuwait territory and sometimes in British. They are now near Zubair, and have practically come to terms. As a matter of fact, from subseouent conversa- ment, as he realizes that he could perhaps carry 'severity too far. $To revert to the growth of the movement, the methods of Ibn Sand would seem to have been after the following fashion. With a tribe that was not of itself anxious to become converted, he would send for the Sheikh and tell him in blunt terms that his tribe had no religion and that they were all jahl. He would next order the Sheikh to attend the local school of 'Ulema, to undergo a course of religious instruction. At the same time, half a dozen selected 'Ulema, attended by some genuinely fanatical Ikhwan, such as El Duwaish, the Sheikh of the Muteir, would be sent off to the tribe. These would hold daily classes, teaching the people all about Islam in its original simplicity. Much enthusiasm was thus aroused in the tribe, and the teachers were careful to appeal to the sleeping fanaticism inherent among all simple and serious savage men. The teachers insisted on all new converts wearing a white turban over their head-dress, and, among other things, they filled the new converts with won derful ideas regarding the “ Imam.” To them he is their father, spiritual leader and sheikh, all in one. Those who joined the new movement were told that they had become members of the new brotherhood, and so the name 4t Ikhwan ” arose. When the Sheikh of the tribe was supposed to have received sufficient instruction, he would be invited to build a house in Riadh and remain in attendance on the Imam. This, again, was part of the control scheme. When Ibn Sand to-day desires to mobilize his Ikhwan forces, he merely gives the word to this bodyguard of Sheikhs, and the countryside is in a flame inside two days. Much importance is attached to prayer, and it is part of the Ikhwan creed that men should pray together. The result is remarkable. At the call to prayer on all sides you hear men shouting out, “ Arise, you lazy ones, get up and pray. A group is then formed and a leader appointed, and prayers are said in regular military style. I have seen Ibn Sand’s body guard of 500 Ikhwan saying prayers, and was greatly struck with the military precision of their movements. Added to this, the fierce, fanatical abandon of the leader of the prayers made one realize the danger of the force behind the movement. Beliefs. An akh (brother) puts before everything else two things : {a) worship of one God, (6) brotherhood among all true believers. Under (a) the actual articles of faith required of him are :— (1) Indivisibility of God (to say there is no God but God).(2) Giving of zikat. (3) Fasting. (4) Charity to poor. (5) Pilgrimage to Mecca. Under (6) the actual articles of faith required of him (1) Worship of country. (2) Implicit obedience to Imam. (3) Help to his brother Ikhwan, whether in financial difficulties or otherwise. A man should always say, “ God is God and Mohammad his prophet,” but it is forbidden to think of, or use the name of, Mohammad as an interceder with God. God is all that matters ; Mohammad is only a man, who gave out God’s word. He is dead and gone and has no further significance, except, of course, that his name should be spoken with reverence, and his memory kept alive out of gratitude. 7Akat requires every subject to give annually one in ten of all he possesses to the Imam. The latter distributes money so collected among the poor and needy as he thinks fit. This is not to be confused with the paying of revenue, though the Bedouin like to confuse the two. To couple any other name with God in prayer is an abomin able sin, such, for instance, as the names of Husein, Hasan, etc. To do this is to be Mushrik. Such a person is a Kafir, and his possessions, life, women, etc., are Halal. Shi'ahs come under this category. The offering of vows (Nadhr), as commonly practised among Shi'ahs and some Sunnis, is a deadly sin. the erection of tombs or monuments over the graves of the dead is a sin. Hence the duty of the Ikhwan is always to destroy them. I he smoking of tobacco is a deadly sin, as also is the smoking of hashish, opium, etc. If a brother sees a man smoking, he will assault and probably kill him. Throughout Ibn Saud’s kingdom smoking is strictly forbidden, except in Hasa, where people may smoke in private. The drinking of alcohol is forbidden, and is treated in the same way as smoking. if a brother is in debt, he has only to go to his companions and inform him. They will pass the hat round, collect the neces sary money, and pay the debt off at once. i £The following are some other customs and beliefs of the Ikhwan :— The belief is held that the present is the period immediately preceding the second coming of Christ. Houses must be of only one storey. Simplicity of living and dress is to be enforced. (Most Ikhwan present a most ragged appearance.) A white turban is to be worn instead of the 'aqal, as a sign manifest that you are a brother. The Imam has since issued orders that this is not necessary, but the custom continues among all newly converted Ikhwan. The Imam himself and his body guard of negroes wore the aqal, as also did the garrison of Hasa, though these admitted to me, when questioned, that they were all good Ikhwan. Salaams are not returned except to another brother. This was very marked in Hasa. My Sunni Moslem companions from Bahrein regularly salaamed to any Ikhwan they met in the streets, but only once did I notice the answer, “'Alaikum el salam” given. If a Kafir or M.ushriq meet a group of Ikhwan in the streets, the latter cover their faces with both hands, rather than be polluted by sight. This was done to me on scores of occasions in Hofuf, and even inside the Imam’s own house and by mem bers of his own bodyguard. It was the more remarkable as the Imam himself was always most cordial and regularly returned my salaam in public. Whenever I happened to enter a mejlis in which there were Ikhwan present, these at once left the room in a body. Fanaticism is still very marked among some of the Ikhwan, and without the Imam’s protecting influence I should probably have had a poor time in Hasa. Over and over again, as one passed a brother, one heard him murmuring under his breath the well-known phrase, “ There is no power or glory except in God,” etc. At the same time, one could not take offence ; on the contrary, one felt great pity for these poor men, firstly because their fanaticism was not of the aggressive type, and, secondly, because one felt that intense earnestness and a desire to live a good life dominated all their thoughts. The Shi'ah population of Hasa is forbidden to smoke, even in their own houses, or to have readings in the Husainiyahs. Failure to obey the rules is visited with the direst penalties. Many Shi'ahs in the past have been murdered by the Ikhwan. But now things have changed, and the Shi'ahs, provided they conform to the smoking and drinking laws, enjoy full freedom— no — and protection. On tlie whole, their lot is better than under the Turks, for to-day they get protection from the Bedouin. In the last five years the prosperity of Hasa has increased a hundred per cent. Forcible proselytizing was an article of faith among the Ikhwan up to a short time ago. It was their methods in this matter which caused such consternation among the people of Hejaz and surrounding countries. Ibn Saud says that he never countenanced these acts, but was unable to stop them till the end of 1919. To-day forcible conversion, or spreading of the faith by the sword, has been definitely abandoned. Ibn Saud, I am told, about six months ago passed the strictest orders on the subject. In public mejlis he explained that such acts would only bring down the wrath of God and of friendly nations on to Nejd. He told me that he had been compelled to execute several Ikhwan for disobedience to his orders in this respect. The Ikhwan, he said, were ninety per cent better and more amenable to-day than they had been two years ago. Great strides were being made daily and strong civilizing elements were at work, which, he hoped, would entirely alter the character of the people of Nejd in the next few years. Such a thing as forcible conver sion was not a thing to be surprised at from a nation who had suddenly found religion, so to speak. His people, said Ibn Saud, had the purest form of religion in the world to-day. All that was the matter, was that those whose hearts had been touched were some of the wildest and most ignorant of all human beings. Their new religion had to be given them gently and not all at once. Its purity would always remain the same, he hoped. It was natural, he thought, that men who had never before heard the simple teachings of the Quran should go off their heads to start with. Ibn Saud assured me that so ignorant had the Bedouin of Nejd been in the past that, until the new revival, ninety per cent of them had never heard of religion, marriage had never been solemnized, and circumcision had been unknown. Ibn Sand’s Government and its Connection with the Ikhwan. Administration. —Ibn Sand’s dominions are divided up into provinces, and over each he has a Hakim (Emir), whose duties are preservation of order and collection of Zikat. Every town in the province is self-governing and has its own elected Emir. The latter is responsible for law and order inside the town area. tJudicial. —Shari'ah law is the only law recognized through out Ibn Baud’s territories now. Ikhwan, Nejdi, and Hasawi are all treated alike: Qadis have been appointed in every city and the Emir of the province or cities, as the case may be, sends all cases for trial to the Qadi. The latter pass sentences accord ing to the strictest letter of the law, and the Emir sees that they are carried out. As Sultan in Nejd, Ibn Saud can overrule the Shari'ah decisions, but only in his capacity as Sultan (Amr el Sultan nafidh). Mutilation is practised, if the Shari'ah orders it, the place for execution being usually the public market. In Hofuf it is on Thursdays. The body of a decapitated criminal is allowed to remain twelve hours in the market square for people to see. Tribal laws and customs, such as “ Dakhalah,” “ Fasal,” etc., are not recognized either by Ibn Saud, his Qadis or his Emirs. Military. —Ibn Saud keeps up a small standing army of regularly paid soldiers. Each province has its garrison, and the chief strategical points are held by these men. The garrison of each province comes under the direct orders of the Hakim. Ibn Juluwi, in Hasa, has 700 men. Ibn Sand’s chief strength lies in his Ikhwan forces. These number 300,000 men, he estimated. He could mobilize them in an incredibly short time if there were a Jihad, such as would be the case if it were against the Sherif. Rifle practice is regularly carried out under the eye of the Hakims of the provinces ; individuals are also encouraged to hold private matches. Rifles in use among the regular soldiers are all of small bore magazine type (Mauser mostly). The Ikhwan possess every type of rifle, though the majority have small bore weapons. Revenue. —For the collection of Zikat and Miri from the settled population, the Governors or Hakims of the provinces are responsible. At present Ibn Saud himself collects Zikat from the Ikhwan, both those who dwelt in towns and those out with camels. He allows no one but himself to interfere in this, as a matter of policy. He tours all Ikhwan settlements every three months, and keeps in closest touch with the leaders. Ibn Saud told me his revenue did not, at present, cover his expenditure. He did not know what he would do if His Majesty’s Government reduced his subsidy. He would be faced with lawlessness again, he thought. He was improving his taxation and financial posi tion fast, but it would be long before he could show a proper budget. His future hopes lay in the ports of Oquair and Jubail,/ and the customs accruing therefrom. He wished to dis courage entirely goods coming from Hejaz, as he got no benefit, but with two good ports of his own on the east coast and properly managed customs he hoped to make 40 lakhs of rupees annually. A tribe that paid Zikat to Ibn Saud, ipso facto could claim absolute protection from all enemies. Hence the desire of many tribes in Oman, Trucial Coast, Yemen, and Sham mar to pay the tax. It meant that they were guaranteed from raids. NOTES. Syria and Palestine. Early in April a series of raids was made on villages in the I rench and British zones by Arabs from east of the Jordan. Many cattle were looted, and casualties occurred amongst the villagers. The region between Beisan and Samakh was the area chosen for action against us, the Ghazawiyeh tribe from across the Jordan taking the leading part. A squadron of cavalry patrolling south of Beisan was attacked on April 21 by 500 Arabs and compelled to fall back on the town. This was followed by a punitive raid on our part, but the small British party sent out for the purpose was compelled by superior numbers to retire on Beisan, fighting a rearguard action. The telegraph line and permanent way were destroyed by the Bedouin, and a serious attack on Samakh by about 2,000 Arabs followed on the 24th. Other small attacks followed, but several salutary lessons were administered by our troops and aeroplanes. ^ Aeroplanes reported large concentrations of Bedouin in the Yarmuk Valley and also north of Lake Hide, and rumours that the Arabs had declared war on the French and us were rife. On April 23 a protest was addressed to Emir Feisal by the G.O.C. Troops m Egypt and Palestine. It was pointed out that more than fifteen raids had been made by Arabs from the east cd the Jordan, and the Emir was told that if he did not stop t em the G.O.C. would be compelled to take suitable action. n response to this communication, Emir Feisal sent to Jerusalem two representatives to say that he was doing his best and hoped the incidents would be treated in a friendly spirit. The representatives were informed, however, that the G.O.C.could not accept messages sent in this manner, and that a written answer from the Emir himself was required. As a result of these representations, Arab Cavalry posts with machine-guns were established in O.E.T. East, east of the Lake of Tiberias, with the object of preventing Bedouin crossing the boundary. The principal ofienders also were imprisoned, the Hauran officials implicated were removed, and indemnities for damage promised. At Damascus, the failure of the raids was recognized and public opinion condemned them as premature and unfortunate. In the French Zone, still more serious trouble has occurred in the country east of Tyre. This region is inhabited chiefly by Christians and Metwallis, between whom bad feeling was known to exist, and was abandoned administratively about four months ago by the French, who, on leaving, handed over a certain number of rifles to the Christian inhabitants for defence purposes. Several cases of robbery and brigandage occurred, which even included .a daring raid on Tyre itself, and on May 5, an organized attack on the Christian village of 'Ain 'Ibl was made by several thousand Metwallis. In spite of a stiff resistance, the village was taken and plundered. The Christians are reported to have sustained some eighty casualties and many hundreds of refugees from the district poured into the British Zone where they were looked after by the Administration. A French Column was despatched to exact punishment and on May 22 ejected the Metwallis from Tibnin. Several villages were burnt and Beit Jebeil, the Metwalli stronghold, was bombed by aeroplanes, but the chief culprits, including Kamel Bey Assad, appear to be still at large. The Metwallis are said to have been joined by the neighbouring Druzes, by the Fadl tribe and by Sheikh Mohamed Faour who has summoned some of the Roalla to his aid. More recently, there have been many rumours of intended raids in Palestine, where feeling is running very high, and the outlying Jewish Communities have become seriously alarmed. The only recent raid of any magnitude occurred on May 29, when Arabs from Ajlun, believed to be of the Wustiya tribe, raided the village of Meshah and escaped with 200 head of cattle! In the Lebanon there have been no disturbances, but the tribes to the north of Tripoli and round Alexandretta and Antioch are said to be in revolt. The Lebanon Christians appear to be regarding with an increase of favour the idea of a United Syria. The issue of French notes is not popular. Conditions in the Eastern Zone have been outwardly— n4 — peaceful, so much so that an English lady was recently able to go by motor car along the desert road from Damascus to Tadmor and back via Hama, Homs, and Baalbek. She was received everywhere with hospitality, and saw no signs of disorder. As expressed to her, the sentiments of the masses do not seem to have hardened against Great Britain to the extent which had been imagined and our departure from the country called forth expressions of regret rather than blame. The feeling against the French was on the other hand very strong. An American archaeologist, who has lately arrived in Cairo, having made the journey from Baghdad via Deir ez Zor, Aleppo, and Damascus, and who was probably chiefly in touch with the official classes, gives a less optimistic picture. He describes the Arabs of the Euphrates as intensely anti-British and anti-French and the people of Syria as only a shade less so. The comparative peace which has reigned in the Eastern Zone must be ascribed less to the strength of the Government than to the general apathy of a people which is war weary and only desires to be left alone. With the cessation of the subsidy from Great Britain and France, the Central Government has found it extremely difficult to meet the demands of the War Party and at the same time to maintain the administration. Already the pay of the gendarmerie is several months in arrears and there appears no prospect of finding the money to meet it. The problem is a difficult one, since, on the one hand, there is some reason to believe that money advanced by the Allies will be misused, and, on the other hand, unless money is forthcoming, there is a likelihood that the Bedouin and other disturbing elements will get out of hand and reduce the country to a state of complete disorder. The decision of the San Remo Conference was received in Syria with dismay and led to the immediate fall of the Rikabi Cabinet. A strong protest was addressed to His Majesty’s Government by the Emir Feisal, who refused in the name of the people, to accept the French Mandate or to agree to the separation of Palestine from the rest of Syria, or to the adoption of the Zionist policy at the expense of the other inhabitants. Since then the Emir has also officially protested against the despatch of the French column to the Tyre district and the reprisals which it exacted, against the appointment of Mr. Herbert Samuel m Palestine, and against the arming of Christians and Jews by the French and ourselves. Demonstrations have taken place in Damascus and elsewhere, and the Extremist Party appears to have completely retained 4Wthe upper hand. The French report military preparations, such, as the erection of defence works in the Bukaa and along the ) Damascus-Beirut road and great training activity in Damascus itself. Conscription between the ages of 20 and 45 has been put into force but has been received by the people with small favour. An exemption tax of £50 is payable by those who do not wish to serve. t The National Congress has been engaged in framing the Constitutional Laws of the Country and it is evident that it does not intend its King to be more than a strictly Constitutional Monarch. The Emir Feisal appears already to be shorn of much i of his power and must bitterly regret the days when his word was law. He is still, however, a real factor on the side of peace, and it is probably due chiefly to his wisdom and influence, exerted in spite of disapproval from almost every side, that the country has not been plunged into a disastrous war. For the present and unless some new cause arises, it seems likely that no decisive action will be taken in spite of the ful- minations of the Damascus press and the lurid threats uttered by the Extremists. The more fanatical members of the Government are no doubt content, in their folly, to stand by and watch the troubles which are happening in the French and British Zones and to point to their own inability, due to the Allies refusal to provide funds, to prevent their Arabs from making raids. It is difficult, however, to absolve them from responsibility when one sees Arab Officers actually taking part in operations, as has happened both in Mesopotamia, in Palestine and the Tyre district, or to\ believe that the internal disorders and frequent raids which \ have occurred, are not the result of the deliberate policy of the ^ Extremist Party. The Emir Feisal no doubt realizes this and for that reason is still hesitating whether to go to Paris at the invitation of the Peace Conference. His Ministers are also unwilling to let him go but, if he does, will no doubt see that he is accompanied by representative advisers. As an alternative, he has made the suggestion that a Commission from the Peace Conference should be sent out to decide matters on the spot. Yasin Pasha, the late Chief of Staff to the Arab army who was our unwilling guest in Palestine for some months, has been released and has returned to Damascus where he received an ovation on arrival. Like other Baghdadis he is not popular in Government circles and will probably turn his somewhat sinister! attentions to Mesopotamia.116 The Deir El Zor Incident. With reference to the note on this subject in the last number, the military authorities of Mesopotamia made arrangements with Maulud Pasha, then at Deir el Zor, for a mixed commission of three officers from each side to fix a provisional boundary between the Arab and Mesopotamian States. A line was agreed upon between Abu Kamal and El Qaim, and our troops were afterwards withdrawn from the former town to the latter and below. Since this settlement, however, tribes from the Syrian side of the boundary have crossed into the Mesopotamian area and have made repeated attacks. On June 3, a party of Sherifian Officers and men at the head of some 300 Shammar Jerba tribesmen, attacked the town of Tel Afar, 40 miles west of Mosul, sacked the Government Offices and killed all the Government Officials there, including three British Officers and two British other ranks. On the next day, the crews of two armoured cars who visited Tel Afar from Mosul were also murdered. A punitive column was at once despatched to Tel Afar. The Arab Government appears to have no control whatever and a virtual state of war may be said to exist in this region. Hejaz. Local demonstrations were held at Jeddah and Mecca to celebrate the election by the Damascus Congress of Emir Abdullah to the throne of Iraq. In Colonel Vickery’s opinion, these celebrations were held with the tacit approval, though not with the official sanction, of the Hashimite Government. Emir Abdullah made a speech at Mecca including most friendly references to the British Government, but gave no denial to the report which was the cause of the celebration. It was reported in March that Emir Ali was raising a Camel Corps at Medina, over 500 strong, for the purpose of policing the pilgrim roads ; other rumours said that the corps was intended for Syria. In March the “ Qibla ” published an announcement that the Dutch Government has now recognized the Hejaz as an inde pendent state. Pilgrims have already begun to arrive, and more than 5,000 are now in the Hejaz. It was at first feared that shortage of food stuffs would interfere with the Pilgrimage, but the Government of India has promised to allow shipment of all the supplies askedfor by the Hejaz Government, and thus the alarm has been removed. The King has many times denounced Bolshevism in public, and it is reported that at Medina a certain sheikh who spoke in a mosque on the advantages of Soviet government was tried by court martial and shot. Captain Ajub Khan, who was acting as British representative at Mecca, left Jeddah for India on April 1. Colonel Vickery reports that his work was very valuable, and has proved that the appointment of a permanent British representative at Mecca is very necessary. Captain Nasiruddin, from the Aden Political Staff, has replaced him. Early in April, King Husein sent another mission to the Imam headed, like the last (page 67), by Sherif Nasir ibn Shakir. It was reported that the object of the mission was to obtain help from the Imam against the Idrisi and against Ibn Sand, and that the King had asked the Imam to recognize him as King of the Arabs. The Imam is said to have replied that he would agree to the latter if King Husein would recognize him as £t Emir el Muminin.” At Aden, Sherif Nasir endeavoured to show the British authorities how to regulate the political relations of the Protec torate with the Imam Yahya, but did not disclose the object oi his mission. From Mecca our agent reports that Ikhwan propaganda in the Hejaz continues, Sherif Khalid being especially active. The Harb tribe is still against the King owing to the murder of Husein ibn Mubeirak (page 33), but, as a result of payments which the King has lately made to the Bedouin, they have agreed, it is said, to allow the pilgrim caravans to pass through to Medina. According to reports from Mecca, the position of Indian subjects in the Hejaz is not an enviable one. “To call a non- Indian an Indian,” states Captain Ajub Khan, “ is a great insult in Mecca, and many resident Indians pass themselves off as Arabs to avoid the disgrace.” A full report on this subject is awaited from Colonel Vickery, so that suitable action can be taken. The Hejaz railway, if not in perfect working order, appears to be sufficiently serviceable for occasional trains. About £25,000 has been spent in repairs lately. A train got through last month from Damascus to Medina under five days. Owing, however, to the railway telegraph not being in workingurder, itys only k possible for trains betweenMaan and Medina to proceed in one direction at a time. Rolling stock is not plentiful; it is believed that on this line only four serviceable engines are available, two others are under repair, and only about forty trucks are fit for use. The Arabs have established a wireless chain from Damascus to Mecca, with stations at Akaba, Wejh, Yenbo and Jeddah. With regard to the capture of Jauf by Ibn Rashid, it is stated on good authority that Emir Feisal has said that political circumstances at present prevent him from taking steps to adjust the position. . King Husein reported that people from Nejd attacked Hejaz settlements in the suburbs of Taif on April 20, and carried off 1,700 sheep. Other Ikhwan raiders are said to have made an attack on Safineh on April 13, but were repulsed. , The proposed meeting (page 88) between Ibn Saud and living Husein to discuss the Khurma affair has been grudgingly (agreed to by the King and more graciously by Ibn Saud. It iwill probably take place immediately after the pilgrimage either Jat Taif or on one of His Majesty’s ships in Aden harbour. Emir 'Abdullah visited Cairo from April 26 to May 11 as the guest of His Majesty’s Government, and though, from the Emir’s point of view, the trip must have been more of a social than a political success, he did not return altogether disappointed, and showed himself very grateful for the welcome that was given to him. The San Remo declarations appeared almost oppor tunely and left little room for discussion, though that did not prevent Abdullah from repeating, in the name of his father, all the time-worn protests against the partition of Syria and the French mandate. He did it, however, in a very moderate and praiseworthy manner. Viscount Allenby invested him with the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, and he reviewed a parade of British troops, an honour which both he and his father appreciated. The question of the supreme control of the Quarantine in the Hejaz, which has been in British hands for the last three years, has caused an acute crisis to arise. The Emir 'Abdullah, to whom the question was referred this year, gave his consent m writing but unfortunately omitted to consult his father. . ^ len ^ le latter, who was already in a state of barely suppressed irritation owing to the decision of the San Remo Conference, and the failure of his own ambitious hopes, heard of this he unofficially repudiated the agreement and 'Abdullah thereupon resigned, there has followed a series of incidents, in which theUBS- ■BMBrt£F!£=rrr::: — 119 — local Director General of Quarantine has loyally supported his Sovereign, aimed at discrediting the British Agent and the British Medical Officer and at recovering a control which is chiefly concerned with obtaining revenue at the expense of the pilgrims. Chief amongst these incidents was an entirely false charge that the Medical Officer had offended some Moslem women in the course of his inspection, and the refusal of the Port Police to allow him to board a British pilgrim ship which was anchored outside the three mile limit. For the latter action, a public apology was demanded by the British Agent within twenty-four hours. The King, realizing that he had gone too far, agreed and after first promising to send the Emir r Abdullah, finally despatched Kaisuni Pasha, the Minister of War, who apologized in the presence of the Jeddah officials. The next day Kaisuni Pasha resigned, and the King telegraphed, asking that his own resignation should be accepted before June 21. The Director General of Quarantine, Mohamed Efi. Husseini, has always resented interference and is no doubt at the bottom of the trouble. It is unlikely that matters will run smoothly so long as he is in office and an attempt is being made to remove him. It is not yet clear whether the King is in earnest over his resignation or whether he is repeating the bluff which he has tried so often. His resignation is based on wider grounds than that of the Quarantine control, which is merely being used as an excuse. Ibn Rashid. The Political Agent, Koweit, reported on April 10 that he had received news that Tbn Bashid had been murdered by a kinsman named c Abdullah ibn Tallal, who in turn was slain by one of the Emir’s men. The motive for the murder was family jealousy or revenge. It was said that the Emir had been succeeded by his nephew, 'Abdullah ibn Mita'b, a boy of 13, whose great-uncle, 'Agab ibn 'Ajil, a man disliked by the people, had undertaken to act as regent. Public opinion in Mesopotamia was that the event would greatly strengthen the position of Ibn Sand in Arabia, and it was thought that he would insist on a nominee of his own as Emir of the Shammar. Ibn Saud himself informed the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, on May 7 that a representative deputation from Hail had visited Biadh and the following terms had been agreed to by both sides :— (1) Ibn Saud to conduct the foreign relations of Hail.120 — (2) Ibn Baud to deal with all Northern Shammar matters and their disputes. (3) The Emir of Hail to be the independent governor of Hail affairs, but final control to lie with Ibn Baud. Subsequently it appeared that about one-third of the towns people of Hail were adverse to this arrangement. Ibn Baud, however, claims to have the support of the rest of the towns people and of all the Shammar Bedouin, and has stated that possibly he will visit Hail to deal with the malcontents. He has not been slow in taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the murder of Ibn Rashid and to all intents and purposes will dominate Hail from now on. It remains to be seen whether the advantages which will result from the virtual disappearance of a separate Arabian overlord, and his relegation to the position of vassal to another who is admittedly pro-British and stable, will be greater than the dangers that will accompany the inevitable spread of Ikhwanism. Nejd. Ibn Baud made full use of his meeting with Major Dickson, the officer deputed to meet him at Hasa (page 65). In a state ment of his case, he asserted that during the war he had main tained a consistently friendly attitude towards His Majesty’s Government and had even gone to the extent of supporting Sherif Husein by ordering Nejd subjects to help in the revolt. After the fall of Medina he warned us, he said, that the Sherif was preparing to attack Tarabah, but no heed was paid, and the fight took place, with its disastrous result for the Sherif. He repeated his plea for the Sherif to be restrained and for the Pilgrimage to be re-opened to Nejd pilgrims, and added that he was afraid that if the dispute were not quickly settled a religious war between his people, who were straining at the leash, and the army of King Husein would follow. In a sketch of Ibn Baud, Major Dickson states that the Emir is an impressive man of enormous energy and power, who com pletely overshadows his followers ; he has a strong character and overweening ambition ; is obviously a born leader, and is a charming host. He has a pleasant smile, but talks always at great length, and, says Major Dickson, one is unable to tell whether he is a fanatic or an accomplished actor. “ His talk is mixed up with many quotations from the Qoran and may be all bluff, but one leaves feeling he has either got a strain of lunacy in him— 121 — 1 I ) or that religion has affected his mind.” He claims to have the Ikhwan entirely in hand, but at times his actions and his features betray a feeling that his responsibility is too great for him. Ibn Saud has an affection for everything British and a pathetic trust in His Majesty’s Government, but he considers we have disappointed him. “ If you British would only allow me to carve out my fortune by the sword,” he said to Major Dickson, “ I would have the Hejaz in a week and Syria in two months, and then what a friend you English would have in me ! ” He upbraided His Majesty’s Government for neglecting him, the true Sultan and leader of the Arabs, and for appointing the Emir of. the Hejaz, who was until lately a mere servant of the Turks, as a so-called King. He was, he added, receiving offers of support from all sides—Egypt, Oman, Yemen, Trucial Coast, Shammar and Anezeh Arabs, and even the people of Medina and Mecca. Ibn Saud gets his Syrian newa from Mohammed 'Abdullah el Bassam, of Damascus, who appears to write to him regularly. It is alleged that a good deal of Turkish ammunition has arrived in Nejd from the same source in recent times. With regard to Khurma and Tarabah, Ibn Saud asserted that the people of Nejd would never give up those places ; they had always been in the hands of his family. The inhabitants would rather die than submit to the yoke of Mecca. During the Turkish occupation of the Hejaz the towns were not included in the Hejaz province, nor were taxes demanded there by the Turkish Government. How then could Husein, an ex-subject of the Turks, claim more than his late masters ? Tarabah, he stated, is a town of strategic importance necessary to Nejd, as it commands the roads to the Yemen and Dawasir. Ibn Sand’s main requests were that King Husein should be restrained by us, and that the latter should be made to open the Pilgrimage to Nejd citizens this year, but he left Major Dickson with the following characteristic advice. The British Govern ment should grant Syria independence if they could possibly do so, but if not, then they should rule it with a firm hand. In any case, we should never let the Arabs have possession of Beyrouth. We should beware of giving independence to Iraq, and on no account should we listen to the Nationalist screams of the Egyptians, who, he said, had been disturbers of the peace ever since the days of Pharaoh. After perusing Major Dickson’s accounts of his interviews with the Emir of Nejd one is struck by the similarity of his per-— 122 sonality, aims and views to those of his hated rival in the Hejaz, whom he at all times studiously refrains from addressing as King. The Political Agent, Bahrein, reported on April 27 that Ibn Saud had written to him reporting the arrival of a mission from Emir Feisal at Damascus with an autograph letter request ing friendship, and offering help towards settling Ibn Baud’s dispute with King Husein. At the same time he had received from the Arab Nationalist Committee of Damascus a pamphlet of violently anti-British tone praising the Bolshevists as the champions of Islam. In reply, Ibn Sand sent a conciliatory letter, in which, while maintaining that King Hussein had always been the aggressor, he expressed a keen desire to arrive at an agreement. He added that the Koran and the Traditions of the Prophet must be the arbiter of any religious differences bur that territorial and political disputes could only be settled by mutual good will and through the mediation of His Majesty’s Government. A sir. Deports from Captain Faziluddin and from Seyyid Mustapha confirm the news of the Idrisi’s low financial condition. The Idrisi considers that his subsidy from the British Government should be restored and that it is unfair that we should heavily subsidize King Husein and give him nothing at all. In a recent letter to the Political Resident, Aden, he states that Ibn Sand has progressed considerably in Shahran, and that King Husein is carrying on propaganda of an anti-Idrisi and anti- Ibn Baud nature amongst the Central Arabian tribes, most of whom are partisans of the Idrisi himself or of Ibn Baud. The Idrisi views Ibn Baud’s progress with complaisance and extols the latter’s treatment of the tribes under his protection. He has asked that King Husein should be restrained in his pro paganda. Ibn Baud’s penetration south-eastwards along the Wadi Shahran, leading towards Ebhah, and even Sabbia, is of more than passing interest. The Idrisi has always looked upon the Emir of Riadh with favour, a feeling which is not altogether explicable, except that, like Ibn Baud, the Idrisi is a religious recluse and is revered as such. If this friendship should culminate in an alliance, it is certain to be directed against King Husein, and it will result in the appearance of Ikhwanism on the Red Sea Coast, thus com-faMSTT — 123 — pleting the eastern and southern isolation of the Hejaz, an event which must inevitably hasten the conversion of the Hejaz tribes. No wonder, then, that King Husein tries to consolidate his position with Hassan ibn c Aidh at Ebhah. A messenger named Sheikh Ibrahim el Hufdhi (“ Asir Handbook,” page 101), sent by Hassan ibn Aidh, called on the British Agent at Jeddah and presented a letter from his master. Subscribing himself as Emir of Asir, Hassan ibn c Aidh stated, in a somewhat roundabout manner, that he and his people thanked Great Britain for their treatment of the Arab people in the matter of independence, and said they knew well that we are a people who keeps its promises. He added that the people of Asir had long wished to show their gratitude, but had been prevented by the Idrisi, who had made war against them. “ If the Idrisi had attacked the Imam and the Zeidis,” said Ibn c Aidh, “ we would have helped him, and he could afterwards have extended his dominions in the direction of the Yemen instead of occupying parts of Asir. The letter closed with a statement that the important part of his message would be given verbally by the representative, followed by a request that the communication should be kept a profound secret. The Sheikh’s verbal statement is reported by the Acting British Agent (Major Batten) as follows :— “ The Sheikh spent an hour detailing the sad state of Asir and the present plight of Ibn c Aidh. He stated that Ibn c Aidh had ofiered to join the Idrisi against the Imam on condition that some of his territory were returned. Five Sheikhs were sent to the Idrisi with this offer, but the latter’s reply was to imprison them and attack him. Ibn c Aidh’s people had had very heavy losses, and fighting was still proceeding. He stated that their flag and the Sherifian flag were the same, and the Idrisi’s flag was red, but no material help came from King Husein neverthe less, although Asir (so he said) was supposed to be under Husein. The Idrisi had summoned Ibn c Aidh to lay down his arms, using Great Britain’s name as his ally to induce respect to the demand. He stated he had previously tried to visit the British Agent here, but had been prevented by the Idrisi. They had not been able to have any communication with our Political Officer at Hodeidah.” Sheikh Ibrahim then put the following questions :— (1) Is Asir considered as an ally of Great Britain, or is it attached to King Husein or the Idrisi ?— 124 — If Asir is one of the Arab States who become allies of Great Britain, will the latter help her to get indepen dence, and, if so, under what conditions ? Will the British Government stop the war between Asir and Idrisi, and will they compel the Idrisi to evacuate the part of Asir he has occupied ? Major Batten replied that the questions would be forwarded to higher authority. Ibn 'Aidh’s description of his dispute with the Idrisi as a “ war ” hardly agrees with the previous accounts received from our Agents (see page 92). He has always had leanings towards King Husein, although he was reported to have made submission to the Idrisi at the time of the Turkish evacuation of Asir (see pages 55 and 98, Arab Bulletin, 1919). Yemen (Tihamah). Fighting between the Idrisi-Quhrah forces and the Zeidis continued sporadically during March, and ended in the Quhrah territory being completely cleared of the Imam’s men. The Idrisi reported that, after a decisive battle on May 2, his men had completely taken Jebel Bura c a. The chief Zeidi concentration in that district was at Saafan, and an attempt to dislodge it by the Idrisi at the end of April failed. Captain Faziluddin reported at that time that the western half of Jebel Milhan was held by the Idrisi and the eastern half by the Imam. Captain Gordon, the Political Officer at Hodeidah, recently visited the Idrisi port of Midi. He estimates the population at about 15,000, but thinks the place has suffered commercially since Hodeidah was re-opened after its occupation by us. Midi was, of course, a product of the blockade, and will probably fall into disuse like Mokha. c Omar Saghir, of the Quhrah tribe, visited Captain Gordon towards the end of April on private affairs, but took the oppor tunity of putting the question : “ Where is Colonel Jacob ? He made a contract with us, but he has gone away and forgotten it. 4 Y emen. Sheikhs Sadik ibn c Abdullah f Ali Ba Wbdullah Pasha, Mohammed ibn Hamid c Ali Ba 'Abdullah Pasha, and Muhsin ibn Mansur ibn Ali Ba Abdullah Pasha, sons of the chief of Udein, lirvisited Aden in March to ascertain informally our wishes regarding the Yemen. They said that, if the Government was prepared to listen to their overtures, they were ready to take orders, and offered help against the Imam. The Resident replied that nothing could be done for them at present. Sherif 'Abdul Rahman ibn Husein ibn 'Abdul Rahman ibn 'Alawi of Saba and Marib (in the Jauf district north-east of Sana'a) wrote to Aden also expressing a desire to enter into friendly relations with us. He said that the people of Nejran had agreed to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Imam. Sheikh Mohammed Nasir Muqil of Mawia (page 69) is reported to have surrendered two Turkish guns and ten camel loads of ammunition to the Imam and to have despatched them to Sanaa. Aden Protectorate. In March the number of Zeidi troops in our Protectorate was estimated at 1,400, and fresh arrivals were reported in April. The Imam has taken no steps to withdraw them, although there are signs that he may be compelled to do so before long, owing to the Idrisi’s action in the Tihamah. He has written explaining that he wants nothing but his rights and friendly relations with us, but he seems to consider that his rights extend over the whole of our Protectorate. He has been informed that no further discussion can be held with him until all his Zeidi troops and officials are withdrawn across the boundary. Two-thirds of the Quteibis are reported to have capitulated to the Zeidi Commander, but not the Quteibi Sheikh. The 'Alawi Sheikh and the nephew (Muqbil 'Abdullah) of the Quteibi Sheikh, who had been detained by the Imam’s representative at Dabab, were sent to Sanaa in March. Muqbil 'Abdullah gave the Imam a hostage, and so was allowed to return to Dhala later. The 'Abdali Sultan informedt he Resident at Aden that the Imam has postponed his proposed advance on Lahej (see page 99). On April 23 a Zeidi officer with twenty mounted men arrived at Lahej and asked for permission to visit Aden. This was refused and he was informed that the evacuation of our territory by the Zeidi troops was the first essential to resumption of com munications with the Imam and his agents. He therefore returned to the Yemen. This action of the Resident was greatly appreciated by the people of Lahej and elsewhere, and, according to the Qadi of— 126 — Dhala, they regarded it as an indication that there could be no secret arrangement between us and the Imam to hand over the Protectorate to the latter. “ The people are now convinced,” writes General Stewart, “ that the delay in turning out the Zeidis from our Protectorate is due to our wish not to resort to arms, but to accomplish it by the use of diplomacy.” Bahrein. The Political Agent, Bahrein, states that Sheikh Hamid, the eldest son of Sheikh Tsa, ruler of Bahrein, recently asked him whether it was true that His Majesty’s Government was now dis pleased with Sherif Husein and had secretly ordered Ibn Sand to attack him. He also wanted to know, if Ibn Saud did attack and were victorious, whether the British Government would allow him to rule over the Hejaz. The Sheikh said his opinion was that the entire Arab race would be grateful if His Majesty’s Govern ment allowed it. Turkey. The Muwahidin Society. With reference to the note on the above Society in the last issue (page 100),Major Vivian writes from Constantinople saying it has become clear that the Society has found itself unable to carry out its original ambitious scheme to cover the entire Moslem world. Its leaders are not, however, confessing failure, but prefer to concoct fictitious accounts of their activities outside Turkey. Major Vivian considers that the available evidence proves that it is extremely difficult for the Turks to launch a successful and practical Pan-Islamic programme at the present time. Abyssinia. The latest reports from Adis Ababa show that the general political situation is satisfactory at present. An expedition which it was recently planned to send to the north has been can celled owing to reassuring reports having been received from that quarter. At the middle of April, Lij Yasu was on the border of the Danakil country with a few followers, but local interest in his movements seemed to have subsided. Bass Taffari appeared to be contented with the general situa-— 127 — tion, although he admitted that he had some anxiety as to the attitude of the soldiery and the lower classes of the country, who were talking vaguely of the right to greater independence and to a voice in the Grovernment. Conditions in the frontier districts were still unsettled, but the Empress and her advisers were showing a disposition to listen to complaints and to introduce improvements in the administra tion and personnel. Java. The following extract is taken from a report by Mrs. Cator :— “ Persistent rumours have been current in Java about un rest amongst Moslems all the world over, created by the un certainty as to Turkey’s future. The general opinion seems to be that though the Moslem movement in the Dutch East Indies is influenced by that in British India, it will never assume the same proportions, for the Dutch Moslems, though fanatically strict about their observance of Moslem rites, appear indifferent to the maintenance of a Turkish Caliph. Any threat to Mecca would, however, be deeply resented. Some danger is appre hended that Dutch and Native socialistic leaders may use events in Turkey as a means to excite Moslem opinion through Sarikat Islam, and the Government is warned to take precautions. “ At present Sarikat Islam appears to have dropped the religious question, and all its energies are concentrated on improv ing the social position of the Moslem element, and on increasing their influence in Governmental questions, with the final object of obtaining independent self-government.”Minute Paper.

Cornwallis, Director, Arab Bureau. rWejh Map, The Surveyor-General of Egypt has recently brought out a third edition of the Wejh 1 : 500,000 Provisional Sheet {see page 260, Arab Bulletin, 1917). All the information collected by the various officers who made journeys in this part of the Hejaz during the war has now been charted, and, as a result, the area in the second provisional map between Wadi Hamdh and Colonel Newcombe’s routes to Muadhdham is no longer blank. Along the course of the Hejaz railway much new material has been put in, whilst, to the east of it, the routes of Miss Bell, Huber, and Doughty south-east and south-west of Teima have been inserted. The sheet is a distinct advance on the pre-war maps of this previously little-known part of Arabia. The Deir ez Zor Incident. The conditions in the district from Deir ez Zor to Abu Kamal have not changed appreciably since the capture of the former town by Kaimmakam Ramadan Shalash in December last. Maulud Pasha, whom the Arab authorities sent to take over the command, appears to have adopted much the same attitude as his predecessor, even to the extent of preaching Jehad, and, with the ample funds at his disposal, was purchasing tribal support for fresh attacks on Abu Kamal (after the tem porary Arab occupation of the place) and for pushing the boundary between the Arab and British areas as far south as Wadi Hauran. After the Deir ez Zor affair the British Government agreed to a provisional boundary running along the course of Khabur Su to its junction with the Euphrates, and they afterwards agreed to the retention of Mayyadin by the Arabs; but these concessions apparently do not satisfy Maulud and his associates, who seem determined to possess Abu Kamal. Although the actions of Ramadan Shalash and Maulud Pasha have been repeatedly repudiated by the Arab Government at Damascus, it is clear that Deir ez Zor was seized, and that the subsequent encroachments and propaganda were carried out, in the name of the Arab Government. Emir Feisal’s under takings to effect an evacuation of Deir ez Zor, as well as his later promises to stop further advances across the new provisional boundary and to send Sherif Nasir to restore order, have not matured. The incursions, accompanied by raids on British convoys involving serious losses to our troops, have continued.— 76 — Threats to reduce and stop Feisal’s subsidy have produced no effect; indeed, in view of the latest political developments at Damascus, it would seem to be too late for mere financial pressure to influence the behaviour of either the prematurely crowned King or his “ rebel ” subordinates. Maulud Pasha Mukhlus, to give him his full name, was a junior officer in the Turkish Army who gave himself up to the British troops after the battle of Shu 'Aibah. He was one of the first volunteers for the Arab Army, and proved himself an excellent soldier and a fearless leader. He was wounded several times whilst leading attacks on Turkish positions and reached the rank of Divisional Commander. He is about 30 years of age, of a pleasant disposition, and is an honest, though narrow-minded and extremely fanatical, patriot. Latest Intelligence. On March 23, Ramadan Shalash had reappeared at Mayy adin and his followers had attacked a British picquet at Salahiyeh. The sheikhs of the hostile tribal sections were reported to be submitting at Abu Kamal as a result of operations carried out by our troops, and the O.O.C., M.E.F., proposed to make an arrangement with these sheikhs for a withdrawal of our forces to El Qaim, which would form a more suitable boundary than the present one. The situation is, on the surface at any rate, considerably easier. Zaraniq Tribe of Yemen. The following details of the Zaraniq tribe have been sent in by Major Meek to supplement and correct the account given on page 52 of the “ Yemen Handbook. The two sections of this tribe formerly recognized a single head sheikh, but they are now completely independent of each other. Combined they can raise from 8,000 to 9,000 armed men. They own many dhows, and the trade between Aden and Zabid and Beit el Faqih is largely in their hands. Lawless on land, they are pirates at sea when opportunity offers. The two sections are Zaraniq el Shami and Zaraniq el Yemani, divided by a line running east from Taif on the coast through’Beit el Faqih, Taif itself being in northern territory. The northern Zaraniq number from 2,000 to 2,500 armed men and are under Sheikh Munasar Saghir, who lives at the village of Kokhah, near Mansuria. Sheikh Munasar is of avaricious A77 — dtieed ntsat assure iwned vas a 3% ie of if an feral led age, ded and fickle character. He has sought British protection, but accepted the post oi Kaimmakam of the Beit el Faq under the Imam after the departure of the Turks and all d himself with the Quhrah sheikhs m their seizure of the Jacob Mission, thereafter playing a double game m tlle § . ;bal for the Mission’s release. Sheikh Munasar ran counter feeling and rejected the advances of the Idnsi at the en ’ but H is said that he has since found himself compelled to declare in favour of the Idrisi. m The clans of the Zaraniq el Shami are .

Hassan Yahya Hiba Fashiq is the head sheikh, and his nephew^ Hassan Mohammed Yahya Fashiq, has an important place tribal affairs.

At a Syrian Congress which assembled at Damascus on March 8 Emir Feisal was crowned King of Syria (including Palestine), whilst Emir Abdullah was prodaimed &amp;ng of Me S °po- tamia. The proceedings were orderly, and ^e D r , Lebanese and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch took no part them The occupying powers of Syria and Mesopotamia were disowned, and it^was^announced that Emir Zeid would shortly proceed to Baghdad to act as Regent for Abdullah.— 78 - There appears to have been a touch of the ‘ l Arabian Nights ” about the affair, and numerous protests are said to have been sent in from different parts of Syria. They come, however, from the sources which one would expect, and there is little doubt that the Congress was supported by the vast majority of the Moslems. Some of the people thought that Feisal had made a secret agreement with the French, and it was stated in some quarters that the Emir’s life was not at all safe. There are no indications that King Husein or Emir Abdullah took any part in arranging the coup d'etat, but it is highly probable that both of them knew the Congress was to assemble. Abdullah’s elevation to a kingship possibly came earlier than he had expected. Emir Feisal announced that the affair was not anti-European, but was merely an anticipation of the Peace Conference confirma tion of the agreement between Britain and France that Syria and Mesopotamia should be left free to choose their own rulers. He has expressed his sincere friendship towards Great Britain many times since the event. It transpired later that the Baghdadi clique in Damascus carried out the part of the proceedings dealing with Abdullah and the Iraq, and it is now reported that Emir Feisal has since decided not to allow Emir Zeid to proceed to Baghdad. The Declaration of Independence issued by the Congress stated that its programme is as follows : to maintain national independence, public security and equality of justice for all; to safeguard the rights of minorities, and the economic interests of the Powers and their nationals ; to reorganize the country and provide for its development; to co-operate loyally with the Allies, and to help to preserve peace in the Orient. In a speech made by Emir T ^eGal he stated that he trusted the Allies would agree to Syrian independence and would with draw their forces from the Northern and Western Zones, after which order would be preserved by Arab troops. The public in Damascus believed that the declaration of independence and the crowning of Feisal had been engineered by the British, whilst in other quarters it was alleged that French propaganda had led up to these events. It was spread about that the French in their desire to bring about Arab unity and prosperity were ready to recognize Arab independence, and, provided the British would evacuate Palestine and Mesopotamia, to evacuate their zone. They realize, so the rumour went, that the Syrians are against them, but they are determined to remain if we do. These events caused some excitement in the Hejaz, andColonel Vickery reported that the King and Emir Abdullah were of the opinion that the Allied Governments had no alternative to recognizing the decisions of the Syrian Congress A local demonstration took place at Jeddah in honour of Emir Abdullah, but Colonel Vickery is of opinion that, on the whole, popular sentiment is against any aggrandisement of King Husem or his family. n 1 c i- The King appears to have accepted the accessions ot Ins two sons, and no doubt some very admirable diplomacy was exercised at Mecca In Sheikh Fuad el Khatib, for apparen y King Husein has been led to believe that his recognition a« “ Grand King of the Arabs ” will follow as a matter of course ; he has, in fact, already used this title. In the course of a private conversation Sheikh Abdul Malek, of the Arab Agency, stated that Sheikh Fuad el Khatib who recently went from Damascus to Mecca, carried a letter irom Feisal to the King in which the former stated that the people of Syria were determined to bring matters to a head and had forced the Congress on him against his own opinion that it won be better to wait. Feisal found public opinion too strong for him, and the Syrians had told him that if he did not accede to their demands to convene the Congress and accept the crown, * ey would find some other person for the job In his letter to the King, Feisal said (according to Abdul Malek) that he wanted the King’s views and consent before the Congress assembled as he did not desire to act against the King s wishes, but he hoped, in view of the pressure of the impetuous Svrian people, that the King would accede. ' Abdul Malek stated that on hearing the news the King was extremely annoyed and refused to send any message to Fei,ai in time for the opening of the Congress. He also refused to alio Fuad el Khatib to return to Damascus. The Congress met, said Abdul Malek, and was a very childish affair.” Abdullah was proclaimed King of Mesopotamia, a piece of news which he thought would leave Abdullah quite co d^ Abdul Malek explained that relations between the King and Feisal had been strained for some time, and “ now t ey mus * be worse than ever.” They do not trust each other, and m Abdul Malek’s view, the King was fully justified m his attitud towards Feisal. i Although recent information from Jeddah appears to show that Abdul Malek’s forecasts as to the King’s attitude were incorrect, it is known that an estrangement did exist between the King and Feisal; this has probably been patched up by Sheikh Fuad el Khatib.1/ 80 Hejaz. From Jeddah we have recently received reports of attacks on caravans and travellers proceeding from Jeddah to Mecca. On January 27 a Sherif Abdul Rahim, who was conveying money for the Arab Government, was attacked near Bahra by Bedouin of the Ateibah tribe, two of his escort and five of the attackers being killed. The convoy was only saved, it is said, by the timely arrival of a party under the Kaimmakam of Mecca, who had been sent out to meet it. At the middle of January the average value of the gold pound sterling at Jeddah was 142 piastres Egyptian, and 150 to 155 piastres Turkish, and 13 to 14 rupees. Protests continue to arrive from King Husein against his subsidy being paid to him in notes and against the high rupee rate at which they are issued to him. Emir Abdullah recently pointed out to the British Agent that the Hejaz was suffering a double loss, firstly, the reduction of the subsidy and, secondly, the reduction of the number of rupees per pound sterling after rupee notes had been adopted as the medium of payment “ The expenses of Medina alone/’ said Emir Abdullah, “ amount to £35,000 per month, and the administration of the country has therefore become impossible.” The Harb tribe is said to be still giving trouble to the King. He recently invited the head sheikhs of the tribe to meet him, but they said they would refuse so long as their pay was in arrear. Emir Ali left Mecca for Medina by the eastern route via Safeinah on February 1 with an escort of 400 men, and arrived safely at his destination. He appears to have given out previously that he would proceed by steamer to Yenbo and thence to Medina, and, in order to complete the bluff, sent 600 men to Tenbo for the ostensible purpose of acting as his escort. He also seems to have made a second misleading announcement to the effect that he would travel by the Rabugh land route, and it is reported that the tribes waited for him en masse on the two roads he did not take with a view to repeating the capture of booty they made when he travelled from Medina to Mecca (see page 14). The 600 men sent to Yenbo were ordered to proceed inland to join Ali at Medina, but they found the local tribes had closed the road, and they were therefore compelled to return to Yenbo. Sani Effendi Lackany, the financial expert, sent on behalf of the British Government to the Hejaz (see page 5), has arrived M &amp;81 — t 1 at Mecca, but, according to reports received, he is experiencing some difficulty in carrying out his mission. Egyptians are not always endowed with a superabundance of tact and patience, and monarchs of King Husein’s calibre are not addicted to the study of economics. However, Sani Effendi’s visit will at least serve to emphasize the pressing need for competent advisers to the Hejaz Government, and he will doubtless be able to collect useful information from unofficial sources. King Husein received Captain Agub Khan, the officer recently appointed to watch over British interests at Mecca, with good grace and has even insisted on paying the first year’s rent of the house which has been taken as his official residence. A Baghdadi named Sabry Bey seems to be in great favour with Emir Abdullah at present. Abdullah’s desire to be Prince of Mesopotamia is well known, and because of this ambition Baghdadis have always figured prominently on his staff. But he &gt; lost most of his Baghdadi sycophants in the Tarabah battle. ( Sabry Bey, an evil-looking person, was on the staff of Fakhri Pasha at Medina. He remained with the Turks right up to the armistice, and until he realized that there was no possible alternative to surrendering the city, he supported Fakhri Pasha in all his efforts to avoid complying with the terms of the armis tice. Fakhri, however, never trusted him, and described him as a deceiver and a self-seeker. King Husein has recently been granted a Grand Commander- ship of the Bath, and Emirs Ali and Abdullah Grand Commander- ships of the Order of the British Empire. They have expressed keen satisfaction at the awards. In his Intelligence Report, dated March 2, the British Agent at Jeddah states that highway robberies still continue. “ Deplorable as this state of affairs may be,” writes Colonel Vickery, “ I do not find in it any political meaning. During the war the Bedu were well paid and well fed—at our expense. They have now reverted to conditions worse than before the war. Unable to obtain money or food from the King, prohibited from buying more than small amounts in the large towns, they have resorted to their old methods of livelihood. “ The King is said to be holding up corn supplies and food stuffs in order to force the Bedu into submission from hunger. This is not a very statesmanlike solution of the problem, nor a very practicable one, as a Bedouin, if compelled, can live on a date a day. . “ The King also thinks that by this method he will force recruits into his army, oblivious of the well-known fact that— 82 nomad Arabs will not support the irksome discipline of a regular army, and that no inducement or pressure will cause them to enlist. “ The floating of a hides export company has been badly received in Mecca, and the merchants have asked the King to be allowed a share in it. If the King really desired to make a start in the commercial exploitation of his country, he has begun in a singularly crude style, for the company appears to be a partnership between His Majesty and the Kaimmakam of Jeddah, with a royal monopoly for the purchase and export of hides.” Reporting on conditions in Mecca, Captain Agub Khan writes as follows :— “ Liquors, music, gramaphones, singing, and dancing are prohibited to the public. A certain sheikh was recently reported for illicit distilling of araq at his house for his own use. Distilling apparatus was found there, and without any trial all the pottery was flung at his head and a punishment of eighty lashes inflicted. Flogging is the favourite punishment with the officials, and is often applied. The method of flogging is very simple. The convicted person is laid on the ground back upwards in public ; two men sit on his neck and two on his legs, while two others, one on each side, carry out the flogging. Amputation is also inflicted in a most cruel way. “ At trials the witness is told that if he does not tell the truth he will get fifty or more lashes. The truth is often meant to be the opinion which the presiding officer has already formed. The witness is usually brought round to the views of the judge. “ There exists considerable sympathy towards the pan- Islamic movement among some of the officials here, but no practical signs are noticed. “ Emir Abdullah is anxious to resume friendly relations with the Turks, probably prompted by a desire for the continuance of the Waqfs funds, which in pre-war times were despatched to Mecca and Medina from Constantinople and the rest of the Turkish Empire.” Colonel Vickery reports that Wahabis from the Nejd sections of Sebei, Buqum and Ateibah tribes, instigated, if not led, by Khalid, Ibn Baud’s Mamur at Khurmah, attacked a settlement of the Hejaz el Harith tribe (Shadadin clan) at Wadi Kulaikh (see page 84, Arab Bulletin, 1919), about twenty miles south-east of Taif, on March 8. The raiders occupied and burnt two villages and killed some In « I ''of the inhabitants. They were driven out on the arrival of Sherifial regular reinforcements from Taif. The affair may turn out to be a mere tribal raid, but it has occurred at a very inopportune moment and has caused much bitterness in the Hejaz. Such incidents only render a satis factory settlement of the JNejd-Hejaz territorial dispute more difficult, and indicate the pressing need for an early meeting between Ibn Sand and the King. On March 1 Colonel Vickery received an urgent invitation to visit King Husein at Wadi Fatma, about twelve miles west of Mecca, and from his report on the interviews he had there with the King and Emir Abdullah the following extracts are taken— “ I arrived at the camp on the evening of March 2, where I was warmly received by King Husein and Emir Abdullah. “ The following morning I had a private conversation with the Emir Abdullah. He assured me how anxious he was to settle the outstanding questions of the telegraphs, currency, and other matters, but that he had to wait his time and obtain the King’s sanction at favourable opportunities, which did not occur frequently. He said that he found the King much easier to deal with when he got out of Mecca and away from the numerous petty matters with which he would concern himself to the detri ment of his temper and of state affairs. I was able to see Emir Abdullah’s point of view for myself, and to judge what an extremely difficult task he has ; I am convinced that he is loyal to our interests and anxious to get all our requests and proposals conceded by the King. The King’s character is well known, the difficulties of Abdullah’s task can therefore be gauged, and to his difficulties must be added the fact that from the Emir Abdullah downwards the Hejazis are terrified of the King. “ The King urged me to tell the High Commissioner to show no weakening towards the Egyptians, to get them and hold them by the throats. He laughed at the Milner Commission, and requested me repeatedly to inform His Excellency that he should get rid of it. “ He stated that it would be a catastrophe if we left Egypt, and that, having once put our hand to the plough, we had no right to take it off ; this we owed as a duty to the Moslem w r orld. “ His Majesty was very bitter against the Idrisi, wdio was enlisting in his army many Somalis, and whose powder was daily increasing. ‘ What did he do in the war?’ asked the King. ‘And now you offer him Hodeidah and pay more attention to him than you do to me.’— 84 — “ At a second interview Emir Abdullah informed me that the King had undoubtedly taken up a very obstinate attitude over the Ibn Saud affair, and that the disaster of Tarabah was entirely his father’s fault. The Bedouin were tired of fighting after three years and would not come to his standard, and they had collected a good deal of money which they wanted to spend in comfort in their homes ; despite this the King had insisted on Abdullah moving against Ibn Saud. The Emir said he thought his father was now more reasonable, and^was prepared to make substantial concessions if Ibn Saud would make the first move, viz. by sending letters and the usual present to the King via Emir Ah at Medina, which was the best channel. The Emir added that naturally Ibn Saud would only consent to meet the King because he looked on him (Abdullah) as his real enemy and the cause of the trouble, but His Highness laid great stress on the necessity for an interview between Ibn Saud and himself before the former saw the King. He said that he was sure that after half an hour’s conversation with Ibn Saud matters could be prepared for 8 1 Ta / ppToch6?yieut. I presume the Emir wants to warn Ibn Saud not to take the King too seriously, nor to be annoyed if the King gets into a passion, as well as to try and come to a preliminary agreement with him before he sees the King. “ Emir Abdullah talked of Syria, but not bitterly, and told me that Emir Feisal had four times telegraphed for him just before the entry into Damascus to come as his Foreign Minister, but that he had refused since he had read the ‘ McMahon ’ letters and saw clearly what the eventual position of Syria would be. It was obvious, he added, that France would put forward claims to Syria, and it was equally obvious from Sir Henry McMahon’s letters that England would have to forego any claim to that country. “ The Emir then turned the conversation on the affairs of the Iraq. He told me that he was accused of having ambitions there. The days were over, he said, when a man could set forth with a few followers to another country and place a crown on his head and proclaim himself king or emir of it. He himself had never aspired to place himself in a position like the Prince of Wied in Albania (‘ Was there ever such a coward !’ the Emir interjected). He liked the Iraq, the people were more civilized than those of the Hejaz, and there was an intellectual class to associate with, whilst there was none in the Hejaz. He would certainly like to be Emir of the Iraq if guaranteed British support and aid for at least twenty years. He would not accept a position in any country for which Great Britain had not the mandate. I ft 0 ■asked the Emir if he would not be sorry to leave the Hejaz. ‘By Allah,’ he said, ‘ it would break my heart to leave these Bedouin, and if I had a high position in the Hejaz I should never leave it.’ . . , . “ After some more conversation I was left with the impressio that the Emir, if he had a choice, would slightly prefer to be Emir of the Iraq than King of the Hejaz, although he would be very glad and gratified to have this latter position. “ All the opinions were expressed spontaneously by AbdullaU, it may be with the intention of inducing me to declare something, but I had nothing to declare. “ Later I asked him definitely if he really thought an Arab Kingdom was possible, and he replied, with much emphasis, ‘ Yes—with British support.’ I pointed out that that was the usual reply of the King’s, and that it was unthinkable an contrary to all Great Britain’s traditions to force a king on a people, and to coerce independent states into a confederated monarchy. The Emir replied that it would only be for a year or two and then the Kingdom would be accepted willingly anc c e er fully by all the Arabs. I said that I looked upon it as tutiie to discuss the possibilities of an Arab Kingdom with such dissen tients as the Idrisi, the Imam, Ibn Saud, and other powerful potentates in Arabia. The Emir persisted that it would be easy with our support, and if we took strong measures against those objecting to it. I remarked to him that this was just what we were not prepared to do, and I reminded him hov ea,1 :T 111 Islamic history the Caliphate split as a temporal power, and how difficult the early Caliphs had found it to keep order m Arabia. Colonel Vickery, continuing his report, states that he considers the Ikhwan movement has become dangerous, and especially so on the frontier between Nejd and the Hejaz. Me thinks the wail of Nejd about the pilgrimage is somewhat out o± place when they are committing hostilities on the frontier, inciting the King against them, and themselves closing the PllSr The g Kin 0 g a has at present four “ experts ’’ from Syria to advise him on questions of agriculture, minerals, irrigation etc. Coione Vickery states that they draw £50 each m gold per month, although their ignorance is astounding, and proceeds “ As the King’s ostensible object in visiting his farm was to discuss agricultural projects, these experts accompanied him. The geological expert is not likely to forget the little walk the King took him to a hill about two miles from camp, where he tell— 86 — into ecstasies over a large piece of rock which he said contained many wonderful properties and was very valuable. The King was delighted, and ordered the geologist to carry the rock back to camp to show me. It weighed about 40 lbs. The unhappy man staggered back to camp and deposited the rock outside the King’s tent, and the name he called it was not ‘ valuable.’ “The agriculturist held forth at length on the possibilities of extensive irrigation and other schemes for cultivating Wadi Fatma. Emir Abdullah told him bluntly in front of the King that all the Wadi Fatma required to make it productive was a few strong fellahin who would work, and that all their talk was nonsense. “ The Wadi Fatma is undoubtedly a district of potential agricultural value. There is an underground system of aqueducts, 500 years old, by means of which the Wadi can be irrigated. The aqueducts are pairs of cement pipes sunk in the ground, carrying the water from the spring head. Although of great antiquity the cement looks like new. I asked the King if he had any objection to an English irrigation expert making an inspection of the Wadi, and he said that he would be delighted.” Writing from Mecca on March 9, Captain Agub Khan stated he had heard that negotiations between Ibn Sand and the Hejaz Government for a pilgrimage from Nejd during the next season ended in failure. The Hejaz Government insisted that the Nejdis should enter Hejaz territory unarmed, but this condition was not accepted by the other side. No reports as to any such negotia tions have reached us from any other source, and it seems hardly possible in the present state of tension that official communica tions have passed between Mecca and Riadh on the subject. A number of Mutawwafin and Muzawwarin are said to have left Mecca and Medina for India and Java to advertise the new administration in the Hejaz and to encourage pilgrims. Captain Agub Khan states that Ahmed ibn Mansur (Emir of the Harb tribe) has been appointed Governor of Medina. It is very probable, however, that some less responsible post in the city is meant, as Ahmed ibn Mansur is hardly fitted for such a high position, which will almost certainly fall to a Syrian or a Baghdadi unless the Harb have insisted on its being given to one of their kinsmen, Medina being, of course, within their territory. The Political Officer at Hindiyah rejmrted in November that rumours were current in his district that the Ikhwan movementwas extending, and that one of the reasons for its success was the - Arab fear of a Sherifian regime. Some of the Anazeh had been seen wearing the Ikhwan emblem, a white cloth, instead of the ordinary aqal. Miss Gertrude Bell has recently sent in the following note on the Ikhwan “ Suleiman el Dakhil tells me that the Ikhwan have asked Ibn Rashid to allow them to settle atUmm el Radhummah Wells, near Linah, and will probably be given permission. Their idea is to make a settlement like Artawiyah with gardens and palm groves. When you enter the Brotherhood you sell your camels, relinquish nomad life, and take to cultivation. A great deal of successful propaganda is going on among the Shammar tribes, and it is they who have put pressure on the Emir in the matter of the Najefi merchants, all of whom have been banished from Hail. Among the Dhafir, missionary work is progressing well; it has just begun among the Anazeh Ruwallah and Amarat. Suleiman thinks Ikhwan doctrines will certainly spread among the Anazeh, but that, in spreading, they will become less fanatical. In four years’ time he thinks all the Bedouin tribes will have accepted the Brotherhood. It has also spread among all Harb outside the Hejaz. Shi’ahs and Sunnis who indulge in tobacco are even more hateful to the Ikhwan than Christians. “ As far as the Bedouin are concerned, the new faith means little but the relinquishing of tobacco and strict observance of the daily prayers. It is interesting psychologically that hopes of Paradise—and the Brotherhood has no other cards in its hand— should induce the nomad tribes to abandon the one mitigation of the pains in which they carry on their present existence. There is a story, probably one of those cliches which outline current opinion rather than an actual narration of facts, which indicates that even among the Brotherhood tobacco smoking is not the last and worst sin. An adherent to their doctrines saw his father with a pipe in his hand and instantly shot him dead. He came to a brother and inquired what place in Paradise his good deed would earn for him. The 4 Akh replied that not Paradise but Hell awaited him, and forthwith despatched him thither.” Ahmed ibn Thuniyan, who accompanied Ibn Baud’s son, Feisal, on his mission to England, emphatically denied to Captain Bray that the Ikhwan force conversions under penalty of death, and stated that the Ikhwan movement had been misrepresented. There is little doubt, however, that on occasions of Ikhwan victories in the field there is no thought of giving quarter. EorT&gt; i Pif l . £fr - — 88 — instance, in spite of the heavy losses on the Sherifian side at the battle of Turabah, Ibn Sand made no announcement as to the number of Hejaz regular troops he took as prisoners. Reports from Jeddah indicate that Wahabism is increasing amongst the various Hejaz sub-tribes of the Harb, whilst the Ateibah are gradually invading the country and spreading the gospel. Colonel Vickery has lately received reliable reports that Wahabi bands continue to move through Hejaz territory near Taif making forcible conversions and accusing the people af being infidels in British pay. Captain Agub Khan sends the following details from Mecca :— “ The Mudeiyna (Proselytizing) Sect of the Wahabis is gaining converts rapidly, both by voluntary inducement and forcible methods. “ This sect considers all other Moslem sects as infidels, and regards it as a deed of great merit to murder a non-Moslem. Their method of killing their victims is very brutal, and they besmear their bodies and faces with the blood of the victim as a sign of their meritorious deed. They shave their upper lips and eyebrows and also both sides of the beard, which they grow m the centre. (Cf. Mr. Philby’s account, page 4, Arab Bulletin, 1919). There are said to be three Punjabi Mullus with the Mudeiyna, who have been living among the Arabs for a long time.” Khurma Dispute. Although both sides are displaying a disposition to come to terms, it has not yet been found possible to arrange a venue for the meeting between King Husein and Ibn Sand. As was fore shadowed in the last number of these notes (page 65), Ibn Saud has refused to meet the King at Jeddah, and, prompted no doubt by the belief that in official quarters on this side there exists a bias in favour of the King, has also stated that he cannot consent to the meeting being held in Egypt or Aden. He will agree to Baghdad or Bombay, but it is probable that King Husein would raise an objection to either of those places for a reason similar to that which influences his rival. Negotiations are still pro ceeding. r The following extracts from a letter written by Khalid ibn Mansur, the “ rebel ” Emir of Khurma, to Ibn Saud at the end of November, are of interest:— stantmople years ago I have visited him very often, and have fseen nothing in him on which to congratulate him. I informed yon recently that his sons had been placed at Taif merely in order to create trouble. You wrote to us saying we should refrain from making any counter movement against them. I swear that from the time I returned from Tarabah up to this moment not a single rider has gone out from onr side to Hejaz for any evil purpose. Four days ago Abn Yabis* was out raiding the Buqum tribe, situated north-east of Hadhn. He has 100 horsemen and 400 camel-riders with him. By God’s providence the Buqum party was forewarned, and was prepared for them up on the hills. Although it was a small party, it did not suffer any loss. Abu Yabis, however, then chanced to meet some innocent hay makers and killed them in cold blood. But the Buqum tribe drove off the raiders with a loss of ten of their camels. “ 0 ! Abdul Aziz, we Arabs on the borders, namely, we whose territory extends from Tarabah and El Khurma to Jebel Asir, nothing controls us except our Creator. Now do not think that after these movements of the Sherif there will be no counter move ment. This must be. ATe are ourselves afraid that the Arabs of the South who so much hate this Sherif and with whom they have nothing in common will no longer desist from reprisals. \ 7 ou must now choose one of two alternatives. If the Sherif really seeks peace and is under British control, then he must return to Mecca and cease from making these aggressive acts. But if his sons remain in Taif and go on intriguing and creating distur bances, then you should not ask us, your own people, to refrain more than we are able to do. AVe cannot refrain any longer, take this on our word of honour. 0 ! man, give the people of the South permission and they will suffice for the Sherif without troubling you or other Moslems. He goes on doing things while you continue to refrain. Now, 0 ! Abdul Aziz, if you have an understanding with the British that the Sherif should be left to do as he likes with the people, without the latter being able to retaliate, then you must tell the people this, so that they may either accept the situation or take action in a way you will hear of in due course.” The feelings towards King Husein of the Buqum tribe in the Tarabah district are well shown in the following extract from a letter sent to Ibn Sand by Mohammed ibn Saad ibn Ghannam (of the Buqum), who is now Ibh Sand’s Mamur at Tarabah : “ We are not rulers like you to draw the sword on men at will, but are only Beduin sheikhs, and we only try to safeguard ourselves and to point out to them that you are to be feared. * Note.— Abu Yabis is unknown to us, but he is probably a sheikh of El Harith tribe.90 ( The Sherif is hated by all men for his doings, both worldly and religions. You are aware, 0! Abdul Aziz, the number of Buqum who have died in his custody, they come to 100 men ; but we have not so far obeyed the Sherif, and we are not going to do so in the future. Of course, he cannot capture a single individual of the Buqum except he be a pilgrim. It is only those who go out as pilgrims to God’s house feeling safe who fall victims to him and his minions.” We have received two original letters written by Emir Ali to Ibn Sand’s Mamurs at Tarabah and Khurma. They are but poor attempts at reconciliation, for the Emir defeats his object by calling himself “ Son of the Emir el Muminin,’ and further by adding a threat to advance as soon as his forces have been collected. Ibn Sand recently informed the Political Officer, Bahrein, that he had heard from Mecca that King Husein had decided to utilize Syria for a Jehad movement in order to reinstate himself in the eyes of Moslems, and that the King had sent agents to Syria to announce the movement, which would be directed firstly against the French in Syria and afterwards against us in Mesopotamia. Ibn Saud added that he believed Sherif Husein would take no overt part in the movement until success appeared to be within sight. King Husein expected Ibn Saud would be placed on the horns of a dilemma, as he would have to choose between joining the movement and thereby alienating British support, or holding aloof, in which case his people, prompted by strong appeals from Husein, would turn against him. There are no indications, however, that King Husein is leading any such movement, though there is no doubt that he is lending moral and material support to all parties in Syria who are opposing the French occupation, and sending such arms and money as he can collect. His attitude towards us has undergone little change as yet in spite of the fact that he is sorely dis appointed at the prospect of Syrian partition and that, in moments of excitement, he accuses the British Government of having “ betrayed ” him. Ihn Rashid. Baghdad reports that Ibn Rashid was entirely successful in his recent contest with Nuri Shaalan, and his representatives now occupy Jauf and Skakeh. Nuri Shaalan is said to have been assisted by the Huweitat, who were also routed. We have received reports from other sources of the occupation of JaufI \ _ — 91 — by Ibn Rashid’s men. Relations between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Sand are said to have improved considerably of late. News was received on March 12 that Ibn Rashid was a Hazil (170 miles east of Janf) and had sent a messenger to Baghdac with a letter containing a similar request to that he subm1 ^ ® last June (see page 91 Arab Bulletin, 1919), when he desired to make an agreement with His Majesty s Government m re urn ^ a*suit able subsidy. The political situation in Arabia has changed somewhat since then, and an alliance with the Rashic won of advantage from many points of view. Asir. It was rumoured at Zeidiyah in February that King Husem had occupied Zahran, Beni Shahr, and the neighbourhood of Ebhah. This must be an echo of the King s recent attempt start a revolutionary Government at Ebhah (see page an )• The following extracts are taken from the diary for January of Captain Eaziluddin, Liaison Medical Officer with the Idnsi. “ Sherif Mohammed ibn Zeid, commanding the Idnsi troops on the Jebel Milhan front, has established 'n the Jebels Ashraf, Daher, and Wasta, the latter due east of Jebel Milhan and south of Jebel Hufash. His next move appears to be on tiie Jebel Dara and Jebel Hufash. 1 ^ “ Reports from different sources show that wherever savage Zeidi hordes have entered the Tihamah, they ave invariably brought in their train pillage, destruction, an desecration. Ghastly stories of the maltreatment of the peop at the hands of these ruthless savages reach me dai y. “ The Idrisi’s strength is not derived from his military strength, but from the atrocities committed by the Zeidi troops . these have brought him the support of the tribes “ For everv Zeidi soldier killed in battle the Imam as o nav blood money to the relatives at sixteen dollars per head. In one of the recent fights against the Idnsi troops, a Zerdr soldier lost his son. After the close of the fight the soldrer m question went to his Amil and asked for the blood money but he was told that his son was only wounded As he P^^ted^m savinw that his son was dead, he was taken to him. boy wounded in the chest, but still breathing. Taking his dagger from his waist-belt he thrust it into the boy s wound, and qualified for the blood money.’' Captain Faziluddin states that from Jebeis Zahar and Wasta the Idrisi forces advanced on Jebel Dara (or Adra), but therk 92 Zeidis cut their communications, and they had to retire on Jebel Zahar after losing three men and two mules. 1 ‘ Sheikh Nasr Mabkhut, the paramount Sheikh of the Hashid, has given me the following account of the occupation Hajjah by the Idrisi troops :— About three months ago, Seyyid Yahya Shaibani, the Imam s Amil in Hajjah, was called by the Imam to Sanaa. He has long been in secret communication with the Idrisi through Nasr Mabkhut, and has always expressed his goodwill towards him. About a fortnight ago, news was received in Hajjah that the Imam had put Seyyid Yahya in chains and imprisoned him in the fort of Sanaa. On hearing this, Shaibani’s brother wrote a letter to Husein ibn Nasr (Nasr Mabkhut’s eldest son) asking him to send a force of Hashids and occupy Hajjah on behalf of the Idrisi before the arrival of the new Amil. Just at this time Mohammed Ghalib el Qudemi (chief of the Kharif—a sub-tribe of Hashid), with 500 men of his tribe, was coming to Hodeidah to join the Idrisi s army in the south, and was encamped near Hajjah. Husein Nasr therefore communicated with Qudemi and, advancing together on Hajjah, they occupied it. Seyyid Ahmed Jahiz has been nominated as the Amil of Hajjah by the Idrisi, and Sheikh Nasr Mabkhut has been appointed General of Idrisi’s forces in those parts. As Hajjah is the chief centre of Zeidis, and only two days journey from Sanaa, the Imam is certain to exert himself to the utmost to retake the place. The Hashid country being so near the whole of the Idrisi’s force on this side will consist of the Hashid and Bakil, and the campaign will be managed by Nasr mabkliut with the money and ammunition of the Idrisi. Thus the long cherished desire of Nasr Mabkhut to take the field against the Imam personally is being realized.” Captain Faziluddin reports the capture of Jebel Buraa bv the Idrisi troops, and concludes : “ It is needless to point out that He events m Yemen are progressing at a very rapid rate and are assuming a serious aspect. The attitude of the Tihamah towards each of the contending parties has now been fullv exposed 2ufdi: m deK:“ e that our polioy m the matter in Further details of King Husein’s abortive effort at establish- Zt r y°! ut 7 a yy ove ™t at Ebhah (, ee page 72) have now SWif H ^Yilr aP P earS tha * * he Idrisi A § ent at Ebha h. hn h Ha d el y azm b was driven from his headquarters by a bomb outrage engineered by Hassan ibn Aidh, and had to move ton- — 93 — Shibein. Ibn Aidh’s cousin, Mohammed ibn Abdul Rahman ibn Aidh, entered the town a couple of days later from Mecca along with King Husein’s representative, Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza. Fighting between partisans of Hassen ibn Aidh and those of the Idrisi followed. The iormer lost one sheikh and two men, and Abdullah ibn Hamza left hurriedly for Mecca during the night. • i Captain Faziluddin says that the fight finally decided the fate of the Sherifian cause in Asir, and has helped the Idrisi considerably to consolidate and extend his influence amongst the tribes even so far north as Bishah. The powerful tribes of Ghamid and Zahran, Beni Shihr, and Shahran are now almost completely under the Idrisi. Sheikhs Abdul Aziz ibn Ahmed and Ali ibn Ahmed ibn Mukhasir of the Ghamid, Sheikh Rashid ibn Jumaan of the Zashran, Sheikhs Abdullah ibn Dhafir and Dhafir ibn Dhafir ibn Jari of the Beni Shihr have all taken the oath of allegiance to the Idrisi, but Sheikh Said ibn Faidh, the chief sheikh of the Beni Shihr, who is closely related to King Husein, is still on the side of the latter. Captain Faziluddin reports that the Idrisi’s finances are m a low state. After the cessation of our subsidy he did not immediately feel any financial embarrassment, as he discharged many of his troops and his customs were bringing m sufficient revenue. The opening of Hodeidah as a free port, however, had the effect of diverting most of the trade from his ports to Hodeidah, and he therefore increased the rate of duty levied on the reduced imports and exports, a measure which displeased his people and only served to drive much of the trade that was left him to Hodeidah. i i i .c The Idrisi’s losses have also been increased by the lack ot shipping facilities, as the small craft of Messrs. Cowasjee, Dmshaw &amp; Co. are always fully loaded with cargo from or to Hodeidah when they call at the Idrisi port of Jeizan. The conditions described, states Captain Faziluddin, cause the Idrisi to think that he is not being fairly treated by the British Government, and, moreover, are liable to throw the trade of Yemen and Asir into the hands of the Italians, who are already doing good business from Massawah. He suggests that the export of silver rupees from Aden to Asir should be permitted, and that shipping facilities should be increased ; also that the Idrisi should have a small copper coinage minted for him, and that Hodeidah should cease to be a free port and be brought into line with the other ports by the imposition of similar rates of customs dues.— 94 — “ The Italians have not discontinued their political activities in this country. They tried to import Italian dollars from Massawah into the Idrisian ports, hut their currency was, however, interdicted by the order of Seyyid Mustafa. “ This was a clever attempt on the part of the Italians to ingratiate themselves in Yemen, because at present the export of silver from British territory is prohibited and extreme need o± it is felt in this country. The people would have welcomed the Italian dollars, and a large part of the Asir and Yemen trade was liable to be captured by the Italians. The far-reachmg political effects of flooding a country with the coins of another Government are obvious. . “ Sheikh Mohammed Salim, the Italian Agent m Massawah and the leading distributor of Italian propaganda in Yemen, came to Jeizan and Midi in my absence about a month ago and went away after a very short stay. “I met at Seyyid Senussi’s house a man named Sherd Husein ibn Mohammed, son of the late Naib el Haram at Mecca. Throughout the whole course of war he was in Constantinople, and came to Egypt early last year. At Cairo he remained for some months as the guest of Seyyid Rashid Rida, Said Mohammed el Sherd el Idrisi (eldest brother of Seyyid Mustafa el Idrisi), a man of pro-Italian sentiments. “ Seyyid Mohammed el Sherif sent the above Sherd Husein on a special mission to Jeizan through Massawah to try to induce the Idrisi to invite him to his country, as he is desirous of visiting his grandfather’s tomb as well as anxious to help the Idrisi in the affairs of his kingdom. “ Sherif Husein has had no encouraging reply from the Idrisi, and has been kept apparently as a guest, but, in fact, as a prisoner in Seyyid Senussi’s house at Jeizan. “ Sheikh Abu Hadi of the Quhrah (see page 16) arrived at Jeizan on January 12 to take his oath of allegiance to the Idrisi. He was followed by a letter from his brother sheikhs (Ahmed Khuzam, Ismail Baghawi, and others) in which they declared that Abu Hadi was a treacherous and untrustworthy person who had proved to have been in communication with the Imam, and they did not wish him to be recognized as a sheikh of the Quhrah. He was, however, confirmed by the Idrisi as Sheikh of Bajil and returned there/’ Writing at a later date (February 24), Captain Faziluddin states that the Idrisi summoned a council of war early in February, when it was decided that his troops should make no further advances, and, accordingly, instructions were sent to all hiscommanders. Hujjeilah, Hajjah, Jebel Milhan, and Jebel Bura'a were still in the occupation of the Idrisi forces. At an interview Seyyid el Idrisi stated to Captain Faziluddin that his advances in the Tihamah had been made in order to protect the Shafai tribes from the Zeidi peril. He had, however, no intention of advancing beyond Zabid. The Idrisi stated that he considered it would be a great mistake on the part of the Peace Conference if the mandate for Syria were given to France. “ History shows that France is | unfitted to hold Moslem countries in trust because of her narrow j religious outlook,” he asserted. Continuing his report, Captain Faziluddin states that “ sooner or later steps will have to be taken to end the struggle between the Idrisi and the Imam. The Imam is a semi-savage, fanatical Pontiff who is not likely to abide by any boundary decision. He is actuated by a desire for aggrandisement, encour aged perhaps by our own policy of reticence, and is playing on the susceptibilities of a fanatical and rapacious horde of moun taineers by waging war upon ‘ the ally of the Christians.’ Captain Faziluddin considers that, in view of the solidarity of feeling for the Idrisi in the Tihamah, the Imam should not have a port north of Zabid. “ He would not be interfered with,” asserts Captain Faziluddin, “ were he to try to develop Mocha.” Yemen. According to a Turkish officer recently repatriated from Sanaa, the Turkish officials and their families still in the Yemen are in a most destitute condition. Mahmud Nadim wrote to the American Consul at Aden in January and asked him to forward a letter he had written to the Ottoman Government at Constanti nople requesting that £20,000 should be sent to enable him to arrange with the Imam for the evacuation of all remaining Turkish subjects. Since Sheikh Abu Hadi applied for the protection promised by Colonel Jacob in his agreement with his captors, other Quhrah sheikhs have sent in similar demands to the Political Officer, Hodeidah. Desultory fighting appears to have continued on the borders of the Quhrah country between the Imam’s forces and those of the Idrisi, and reports were received in January that the former was preparing to attack Bajil and even the town of Hodeidah, which is still garrisoned by British troops. Idrisi troops entered Bajil in January amidst much local rejoicing, but it was reported later that the Idrisi commander was causing dissatisfaction by levying excessive dues on goods passing through the town.96 — A Turkish officer estimated the Imamic army in Beni Saad territory at between 1,500 and 2,000 men, under Sheri E Abdullah el Dumain and three Turkish officers, and at Manakhah, Bura a, and Keima a total force of six to seven thousand. The Idrisi troops on the Quhrah borders were, he considered, only about seven hundred. The sheikhs of Reima were reported to be desirous of turning out the Imam’s troops who were in occupation, but, owing to lack of ammunition, were unable to do so; it was said that they were eagerly awaiting the arrival of Idrisi troops. In January the Imam issued a local announcement that he had ordered his eldest son, Seif el Islam Seyyid Ahmed ibn Yahya, to proceed against the Quhrah via Sanfur with 1,000 men, and Seyyid Abbas via Manakhah with 800 men and two guns. A 'fight is reported to have occurred on January 17, resulting in the defeat of the Imam with heavy losses. The Zaraniq tribe declared wholly for the Idrisi, Sheikh Manassar Saghir having been compelled to follow the other sheikhs of the tribe, and with two other local tribes they raised a composite force of 1,000 men at Beit el Faqih to attack Zabid, but had to desist at the request of the Mansab of Zabid. During February reports were received at Hodeidah that the Idrisi had occupied Zera'i, Mekfal, and Jebel Bura'a. The latter Jebel changed hands several times before it* finally fell to the Idrisi. Reports were received from Hodeidah on March 14 that there had been continuous fighting between the Imam’s troops and combined forces of the Idrisi and the Quhrah tribe. Procla mations had been issued by the Imam that he intended to occupy Hodeidah, and his capture of Bajil seemed to be imminent. The Zeidis were, however, driven back, and the Quhrah recaptured their town of Obal near their tribal frontier. In Sanaa there were, according to the statements of Turkish officers who passed through Hodeidah for repatriation, about 2,000 regular soldiers who were reviewed on parade every Friday by the Imam. In a letter to Aden, a correspondent at Taiz stated that the Imam’s taxes at Hajjariyeh were 50 per cent more than those previously levied by the Turks, and at Udein 100 to 200 per cent more. He stated that the tribesmen were being terribly oppressed by the Imam, who, he added, has ambitions in the direction of Mecca and Medina. Cholera was reported to be prevalent amongst the Zeidi soldiers at Mawia and Taiz.— 07 Requests from the sheikhs of the Lower Yemen for British protection continue to arrive at Aden. Abul Haq ibn Mohammed el Aghbari, the Zindani sheikhs, and the Naqibs of Dhu Moham med and Dhu Husein are amongst the latest applicants. A Turkish Bimbashi, Kudsi Khassen, recently arrived in Egypt from Basrah for repatriation. In 1917 he was stationed at Sanaa and was sent on two journeys to Medina. The route he took was via Ebhah, Wadi Dawasir, Riadh, and thence to Medina. His first journey was successfully completed, but he carried only despatches. The second journey commenced in November 1917, when he left Sanaa accompanied by another Turkish officer, an orderly, and an escort of Qahtan from Ibn Dhuleim, for the purpose of fetching Government money from Medina. At Wadi Dawasir his escort was changed by Ibn Humeidan for Dawasir Bedouin, and whilst traversing the Wadi his companion officer was murdered. The Bedouin caught him smoking and also found that he could not I speak Arabic; they therefore shot him on the ground that he was la Christian. Kudsi stated it was only his assiduous reading o ^the Qoran and his knowledge of Arabic that saved his own life. Riadh was reached in April 1918 ; he stayed there a couple of nights disguised as a Bedouin (as he was during the whole of his journey) and set out for Medina, Ibn Baud not having been made aware of his visit. Mr. Philby was in Riadh at the time. Two days after leaving Riadh he was fetched back by slaves whom Ibn Baud had sent for him, and Kudsi thinks that Ibn Baud learnt of his presence in the vicinity through Mr. Philby, just after he had set off. At Riadh his Turkish orderly died, and he was kept there as a prisoner for a year and given ordinary Bedouin food. He left in April 1919 for Bahrein with letters to the British authorities from Ibn Baud asking for him to be returned to Turkey. . , Shaukat Bey, a native of Baghdad, who has been m the Turkish Civil Service in the Yemen for about twenty years, arrived at Hodeidah from Bajil about the middle of March. He reports having seen in Abu Hadi’s hands a communication (of unknown date) from the Imam and Mahmud Nadhim addressed to Seyyid Abdul Qadir and other Seyyids and tribesmen of the Tihamah. It stated that the Imam had no desire to cause bloodshed among Moslems and that he intended to suspend operations against the Tihamah people. The Imam proposed to appoint Seyyid Abdul Qadir ruler of the whole of the Tihamah, and to assist him with guns, ammunition, and money on condition98 — that the inhabitants would abandon the Idrisi, who at one time fought against the Turks.” The Imam undertook, in case the local inhabitants should expel the Idrisi from their country, not to eaxct taxes from the people of the Tihamah. He only expected their assistance in turning out the Idrisi, and also the Christians, from Hodeidah. The Imam, moreover, promised not to appoint Zeidi Amils in the Tihamah, which would be left under the full and independent control of Seyyid Abdul Qadir. Sheikh Abdul Wahab, the Kaimmakam of Hajjariyah, lately wrote to Aden to say that he is living in hopes that we will come to the salvation of his country. If we have any intention of making a forward move in the Taiz direction, he is ready to assist and co-operate with us. In such case he expects us to send him an official letter. He stated that there was a movement in Sanaa against the Imam, and that internal dissensions in the highlands were increasing and many sections of the Zeidis were watching for an opportunity to overthrow the Imam. As his country is outside our Protectorate, the Resident sent him a polite reply regretting our inability to interfere there. The Sheikh of Khokha, Mohammed Ali Othman, has in formed the Resident that the sheikhs and notables of Zabid district and its dependencies complained to him against the Imamic Government. Ali Othman therefore gave the Zabid gentry an undertaking that he would ask for 400 British soldiers with one officer, two or three guns, and also a quantity of arms and ammunition for arming the tribesmen. He also got the Zabid sheikhs to sign an agreement under which they consider themselves unitedly under the protection of the British Government. The Sheikh asks for a reply, as, failing our assistance, he adds, he will have to address the Italian Govern ment. The Resident makes the following comments :— “ I doubt if all that is written in this letter is true. At any rate, most of it is fiction. He is the Amil of Mokha under the Imam. He came to Aden several times during the war to take supplies, and he is anxious to come under our protection. His threat to go to the Italians for help is to my mind a mere bluff, but he is quite capable of writing to them, as the Italians had something to do with him during the last Turco-Italian war. He would rather be under our flag than under the Italian.”Aden Protectorate. With regard to the Imam’s advance into Protectorate terri tory, the Resident, Aden, reports that the Emir Nasr of Dha a with a force of tribesmen, led an attack on the at Dhala on January 19. After capturing some of the lortkn he was, however, forced to retire owing to lack of organized supply and transport services. . ^ King Husein’s Mission to Sanaa returned to Aden at the end of January. Sherif Nasr ibn Shukr stated that he has advise the Imam to come to terms with the Emir of Dhala, but t Imam had explained to him that the Turks during eir tion of the Yemen had usurped his rights over this and ot places, and his only action had been to appoint and send an age to a district which was really his own. Sherif Nasr did not disclose the object of his visit to Sanaa but implied that it was to bring about an alliance between the Km Yriliourr^ched Hodeidah in February that the Imam was planning an attack on Lahej wa Taiz and Dha1 ^ T said to be a force of 3,500 Zeidis with seven guns at Taiz Ot reports stated that the Imam was making arrangements tor an offensive against the British troops m March or Apn . After a year’s delay the Haushabi Sultan proceeded to Aden in February to renew his treaty with the Government and a so his agreement with the Abdah. , ,, “ He is the last of those,” states the Resident, who joined the Turks during the Ottoman occupation of Lahej to be restoie to Government favour.” His stipend was renewed. The Resident, Aden, reports that the chiefs m the n the Protectorate are extremely disappointed at not rec eivmg armed support in their resistance to the advances of the imam troops into their territories. j- ^ The Alawi sheikh pleaded for protection according treaty with us, and said that he was tired of writing for it The Quteibi sheikh informed Aden that he required not lette T he British detachment is still at Nobat Dakim, but the chiefs further north are anxious that our troops should advance further towards the Protectorate, boundary, an operation which the G 0 C Aden, agrees is most desirable from both the political and Jim military view-points, but one which he finds impossiWe with the forces at present in his command, or before the next cool season.The Imam has not yet taken any steps to withdraw his troops from Protectorate territory in accordance with the request sent to him by the Resident, Aden, and there are indications that he does not propose to do so. His agents recently arrived at Thnmir (Tamer ?). Latest Information. A Turkish Mulazim who recently arrived at Aden from Sanaa for repatriation stated that he was certain that if our troops were only to advance as far as Mawia, the actual fighting would be done by the Arabs themselves. They are, he asserted, praying for the advent of the British into the A emen, and he added that no stories of the Imam’s intention to attack the British camp should be believed. The Zeidis were afraid of the British. On the other hand, a Yuzbashi Jaudat Effendi, who also passed through Aden for return to Turkey, stated that the Imam was bent on conquering the Aden Hinterland, and he expected an attack to be made almost immediately. The Haushabi Sultan continues to send in alarming reports of Zeidi movements on his borders, but the latest information from Aden indicates that there has been no unusual activity during the past few weeks. Turkey. It is reported from Constantinople that at a certain meeting of nationalist officers at Erenkeui on February 20, it was decided to send certain officers to Syria under the leadership of Major Kemal Bey. This officer is said to have left for Angora after the meeting. He is reported to have taken with him a considerable sum in gold, and to be proceeding to Medina, after approaching the Wahabi Arabs with a view to their co-operation with the Nationalist forces. He is said to be a capable officer who has had considerable experience of Arabia and the Arabs, and has been employed in both a military and a civilian capacity in that country. He is well known in Arab literary circles, and is held in especial esteem by the Arab Ulema. The Muwahidin Society. This newly-formed pan-Islamic Society claims to possess branches at Cairo, Tantah, Jerusalem, Beyrout, Baalbek, Homs, Damascus, Haifa, Aleppo, Baghdad, Nejef, and Koweit._ . iMuM ~\ ) — 101 — At a recent meeting at Angora under tire presidency of Mustapha Kemal Pasha a proclamation was drawn up calling upon all Moslems to combine and protect their religion and their Caliphate, and exhorting the faithful not to be satisfied with the decision of the Allies to let Constantinople remain as the seat ot the Caliph, but to work day and night to save the only Islamic Empire from ruin. t'u cj a It is said that at the meeting letters were read from Ibn baud, Ibn Rashid, Ibn Khaldun, the chiefs of the Milli Kurds, the Anezah, and the Shammar. „ , The promoters hope to send delegations to lurkestan, India, Afghanistan, Persia, Java, Musqat, Syria, Mesopotamia, and North and Central Africa. Although the Society is still in its infancy and has not as yet \ secured much active support outside the ranks of Turkis \ Nationalists, it is possible that it may eventually become a serious | embarrassment to British interests, for its policy is violently ant - i Christian and its propaganda is being extensively circulated. Libya. The following note on the political situation in Tripoli and Cyrenaica has been received from the Frontiers District Admmis- tration :— 4 . “ gj nC e 1918 the only notable development in Tripoli and Cyrenaica has been the grant of a Constitution to these two pro vinces, which are now separated into two Governorates, under a Civil Governor appointed by Royal Decree. . . “ The main difference in the two Constitutions is that m Tripoli the electoral and administrative division is territorial, while in Cyrenaica it is tribal. _ ^ i ± a “ There is as yet insufficient information as to the detailed working of the Constitutional machine to enable an opinion to be formed as to the prospects of success. In Tripoli a national party is said to be already in process of formation. In Cyren aica Mohammed Idris has as yet shown little inclination to collaborate with the Suzerain power. • m • r “ From a purely Senussi point of view, the situation m Inpoli should tend to break up their influence in that area, while m Cyrenaica the foundation of the Constitution on a tribal basis should strengthen Mohammed Idris’s power over his followers and give him a solid party to oppose or assist the Italians accord ing to the policy he decides to adopt. _ “ Ramadan Suwehli (Shetawi) has been appointed Governor— 102 — of Khoma with headquarters at Misurata, an arrangement which should relieve Mohammed Idris of further anxiety from a military point of view. . * u While the proposal of the Italians to invest Mohammed Idris with autonomous powers in some of the oases (Jaghbub and Kufra presumably) will further tend to increase his prestige, it should also encourage him to believe in the bona fides of that Suzerain power. He has up to the present been reluctant to commit himself to the Italian side, and has given more than one indication of his desire to remain the friend of England and, if possible, find himself in some semi-dependent relationship to her. It is probable that the cession of Jaghbub to Italy will cause him to realize that such dreams are vain, and it is to be hoped that an appreciation of the possibilities offered by the foundation of the Constitution on a tribal basis will lead him to adapt his policy to working for predominance along constitutional lines. “ There is no evidence to show that Seyyid Ahmed el Sherif is recovering any of the prestige he lost during the war, and he is still living in Turkey on the charity of the Turkish Government. If Mohammed Idris devotes himself seriously to the task of ad ministration and to consolidating his position in the Oasis of Kufra, it is difficult to see where Seyyid Ahmed could in the future find a rallying point for his adherents.” ) fIn aijy further communication on this subject, please quote No . 177884/M.E./44.a. and address, not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.
