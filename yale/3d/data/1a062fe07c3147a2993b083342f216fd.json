Each thick tress is individually curled, plaited, and bound at the tip. Two shorter strands frame her face. Her broad diadem is of gold, simulated here by yellow paint. A lotus blossom at the front, its stems crossing over her head to the back of the band, was probably artificial and may well have been part of the diadem. Her dress was a large rectangular piece of sheer pleated linen, which was wrapped around the body with one fringed edge running down the front. \nHeight: 32 centimetres Length: 18 centimetres (base) Width: 6.6 centimetres\n\n[EA32772](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?partId=1&objectId=119651)\n\nMade by Daniel Pett with a OnePlus 3 mobile phone and 217 photographs"],"cho_edm_type":["3D Model"],"cho_title":["Wooden figure"],"cho_dc_rights":[null]}
