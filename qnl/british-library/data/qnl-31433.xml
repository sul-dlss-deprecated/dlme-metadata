On the 7th February an informant met a Muscat Arab (name unknown) who was travelling as a second-class passenger from Bahrain to Kuwait on the SS 'Dwarka'. According to my informant the man appeared to be a member of a secret national party in Muscat and to be touring the Gulf Sheikhdoms to make enquiries regarding similar movements in them. He said that the national party in Muscat had been able to imbue the educated classes there with a spirit of dislike towards the Sultan. He added that it would be an easy job to shoot the Sultan but the national party feared that in these circumstances the British Government might take over the government. Their chief hope rested in obtaining assistance from the Arab League. I should be grateful if you would kindly let me know whether there is anything in the nature of a national party in Muscat. So far as I am aware there are very few educated Arabs in Muscat outside the Sultan's own family and if there is any movement against.the Sultan I should expect it to spring from the personal ambitions of his relatives rather than from any democratic or national movement.r- SECRET D&gt;0. No. C.119 - 11/56 (J) Political Agency, Muscat* 28th February 1948* S/ Please refer to your D.O* letter No. 364-3 dated the 10th February 1948. 2. I have no information which suggests to me that a secret National Party has been formed in Muscat. At the same time I can confirm that there is much grumbling and discontent among all classes in Muscat which tends to focus on the Sultan. The discontent arises mainly from economic causes, high prices, low wages, lack of employment, as a lack of which many of the poorer classes have recently been persuaded to leave Muscat in search of employment at Bahrain or Kuwait. So serious has been this exodus that the Government has now placed a bar on the emigration of certain classes of artisans, carpenters, masons, etc for fear that there may soon be none at all left in Muscat. While the Governments action in this matter is reasonable it has none the less served to increase the discontent, since owing to shortage of materials and high prices there is little work being done in Muscat and this class of artisan is now forced to remain against their will and with no prospect of employment. As a consequence there is much bitterness directed against the officials in charge of the administration, and as a corollary, against the Sultan for leaving them in authority while he resides in Dhofar apparently regardless of affairs in ?luscat. The officials on the other hand have recently been ^shaken-up'* by the / Sultan The Honourable Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.Sultan and as the time approaches for his return there are indications that they fear the retribution which can be so swiftly meted out by an autocratic ruler, 4. By and large, however, I do not feel that there is any grave likelihood of this discontent culminating in anything serious in the immediate future. If it did I would expect the trouble to arise as you suggest, from the personal ambitions of the Sultan*s relations taking advantage of the position, rather than from any Democratic or NationalParty movement. As long as he continues to leave Muscat for long periods, in the virtually uncontrolled charge of such officials as Ahmed bin Ibrahim Minister of Interior and Ismail ar Rassassi Chief Wall, I think there must always be a danger from this source. The sooner therefore a British Administrator is found to take charge in the Sultan*s absence, the better. 5, Among the Sultan*s immediate relations, the only one with sufficient force of character to suggest himself as a possible opponent to the Sultan is Saiyid Tarik, his half-brother but there again I have no reason to suspect any present intrigue. COPYD«0 • 419-3* THE RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, the 1*7th February 1948* I have reason to believe that the name of the Muscat Arab mentioned in my secret demi-official letter No.364-3 dated the 10th February 1948 is Saiyid Ali bin Muhammad^ s.i U Political Agent, muscat.
