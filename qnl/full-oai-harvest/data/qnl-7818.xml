It largely consists of copies of Foreign Office and Colonial Office correspondence discussing the following:Reports in 1936 that the Treaty of Friendship (1926) between Italy and Yemen has been extended until November 1937.Details of negotiations for the renewal of the aforementioned treaty and reports of its conclusion on 4 September 1937.Claims made in the British press that Italy's supply of arms to Yemen contravenes certain clauses in the Anglo-Italian Agreement.Rumours of renewed French claims to Sheikh Said [Ra’s Shaykh Sa‘īd].The Foreign Office's response to unconfirmed reports of Italian military presence in Yemeni territory in early 1939, including reports of the Island of Jebel Zukur in the Red Sea (also spelled Djebel Zukur in the file) [Jazīrat Jabal Zuqar] having been occupied by Italian troops, and reports of Italian intentions to mount forty-three heavy guns at Sheikh Said.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Resident, and later Governor, of Aden (Bernard Rawdon Reilly); His Majesty's Ambassador in Paris (Eric Phipps); His Majesty's Ambassador in Cairo (Miles Wedderburn Lampson); His Majesty's Ambassador in Rome (James Eric Drummond, Earl of Perth); His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires to Rome (Edward Maurice Berkeley Ingram); the Secretary of State for the Colonies; His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Reader William Bullard); officials of the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office.In addition to correspondence the file includes copies of Aden political intelligence summaries from 1933 and a copy of a translation of the Italian text of the treaty between Italy and Yemen, signed on 2 September 1926.The date range of the file is 1926-39; however, most of the file dates from between 1933 and 1939, with the exception of the aforementioned copy of the Italo-Yemeni treaty.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d’Affaires to Rome</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Jebel Zukur Island</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Italo-Yemeni Treaty (1926)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to France</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Italy</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy, Rome</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sheikh Said</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Italian Agreements (1938)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00028c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00028c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00028c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
