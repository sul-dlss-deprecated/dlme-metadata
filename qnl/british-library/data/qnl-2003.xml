A telegram (f 3) followed by a letter (ff 5-7) from the (Officiating) Chief Commissioner at Aden, Lieutenant-Colonel Morice Challoner Lake, both dated 4 February 1933, announce the imposition of the trading restrictions. The letter gives further details of the efforts of Royal Air Force representatives to establish a landing ground at Qishn, the resistance met from authorities, and the threats made against trading facilities for the inhabitants of Mahra and Socotra.A further telegram (f 9) from Lake to the Political Resident announces that the Qishn authorities have withdrawn opposition to the landing ground, resulting in the lifting of trade restrictions. There is a truncated note at the end of the file (f 11) which notes that the Political Agent discussed the matter of trade between Al-Mahra/Socrata and Bahrain with the Adviser [to the Government of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave], who notes that a number of Bahrain merchants trade at Socotra and that poor men from the Mahri coast and Socotra come to Bahrain for the pearling season.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Qishn</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Mahrah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic sanctions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000342#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
