As you already understood from me it was my intention to send my launches (H.D.ML'SO to Karachi for very essential repairs, and that Major Hirst was tkking them over for this purpose, this was prevented at present by the sudden appoint ment of Captain Hudson. As it now appears that the handing over will not be completed until early January, I shall be grateful if the period of Major Hirst service could be extended to February the first, to enable him to take my launches over to Karachi and put the repair in hand, as he is the person who brought the launches from Bombay, and is acquainted fully with them and with the ship repairers. I am sure the Government of India will accede to my request as this wil] be of great assistance to me. Your sincere friend, sd. Said bin Taimur.

As regards refitting the craft at Karachi or Bombay - neither of these dockyards are under the jurisdiction of the Royal Navy, but come under the Flag Officer Commanding Royal Indian ITavy, Naval Headquarters, New Delhi, to whom application should be made.

She will be capable of sea passages of upto 2000 miles without re-fuelling. On peactime service and under ordi nary conditions she should easily be run by a crew of 6 , that is to say 4 hands in the focsle, one engineer and one captain.

At the forward end of the aft deck there is a deck lounge giving comfortable accommodation for six people and equipped with seats, dining table, separate heating system and fresh water tank with a small cock-tail bar below. The \ hole of the aft deck is clear with the exception of a companion way down to the aft lobby. There are two davits on the aft deck for lifting the dingy on board.
