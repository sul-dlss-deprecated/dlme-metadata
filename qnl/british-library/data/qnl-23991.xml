The British Council present tneir compliments to His Majesty’s Residency in the Persian Gulf and have the honour to enclose copies of a memorandum regarding centres of education not under the control of the British Council. The Council will be glad if this memorandum can be brought to the notice of all those concerned in the Council’s work in the Persian Gulf.MEMORAriDUM . INFQRI^ATION CONCERNING DISTANT CENTRES OF EDUCATION NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE BRITISH COUNCIL . The continued demand abroad for a knowledge of English or at least for an increased number of English teachers, especially in countries as distant from England as Japan and South America, is beginning to cause the British Council some embarrassment. Educational centres which are neither founded nor subsidised by us and with whom we have not previously had any intercourse not infrequently ask the Council to choose their teachers, for whom they supply the salary. This mark of con fidence is certainly gratifying but it involves a heavy responsibility. If such an organisation as the British Council nominates a young man or woman to a post abroad it thereby stamps that post with the mark of its approval and implies that the selected applicant can rely on the Council to start them on a fitting and appropriate career, and it is therefore essential that the Council shall take every possible precaution to ensure that this reliance is not misplaced. British Council representatives, directors, head masters and professors and all other voluntary collaborators in cur educational work are most earnestly requested not to advocate any such appointments in their district except after the most careful inquiry as to the genuineness of the institution in question. Should they learn that the Council are being approached through other channels, the Council would be most grateful for a warning if, in their opinion, the vacancy is not all that it should be. The points on which the Council most frequently need information are:- 1. The solvency of the institution, 2. The permanence of employment with prospects of advancement, 3. The kind of authority which really controls the school, college or institute, 4. The personnel of the institution, especially the character of the director, headmaster or rector, 5 . The cost of living as compared with Great Britain, 6. The opportunities for social relaxation and inter course, and 7. The healthiness or unhealthiness of the climate. The Council must rely upon the collaboration of their employees and collaborators in this rather delicate matter, as otherwise the Council’s appointments may easily gain an undesirable reputation.■^© Telegram G.T.C.
