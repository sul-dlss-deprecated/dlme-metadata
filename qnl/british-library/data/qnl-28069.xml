January 9.94. Extract. It is quite true that the Turkish Customs authorities claim duty on all goods landed at or shipped from Mahomerah. They state -s' that Mahomerah is a Turkish port L they base this claim on a Treaty made with the Persian (rovernment in 1847 or 1848 in which the Mahom erah territory was ceded to Persia in exchange for some other ter ritory we believe in the North of Persia. They now say that the Persians have not conformed to this Treaty in the North &lt;5; that therefore the Southern portion reverts to them. They have lately stopped many British Buglows which were loaded at Mahomerah, at Turkish Custom Houses lower down the river &amp; insisti on 8^ duty being paid. In most cases this has been paid by Snikh Mizel Khan under protest on the advice of H.B.M.Consul here &amp; the latter is now taking steps to have this refunded . The Turkish su thorities agree to refund 1% on proof that the goods, mostly dates, have been landed in a foreign port, but of course the return of the whole duty is claimed. The Turkish Authorities assert that they will also exact duty on goods shipped by steamers from Mahomerah but say their arrangements are not yet perfected for enforcing this We have not heard of any duty being paid on cargo landed at Mahomerah by Buglows but have no doubt the Turks will attempt to enforce this next.Busreh Dec.29,93. Extract. With reference to conversation with Mr Cunningham on the claims of the Turkish Custom House to full duty on car^o destined for Mahomerah on the ground that Mahomerah is Turkish Territory we beg to quote the following instances in which duties have been claimed from us Sc which we have taken up officially. Coal. Ever since the opening: of the Karun to navigation the Custom House have refused to allow refund of 7% duty (8^ having been paid upon import) on coal burnt by the steamers navigating the Karun. One shipment of coal we declared upon arrival as intended for use on the Karun &amp; demanded that only 1% transit duty should be made upon it, but that all was refused &amp; we had to pay This matter has been before H B M Consul for the last 4 years &amp; has also been represented to the Foreign Office at home but up to now nothing definite has been done. We had to pay 8^ duty on some 18 tons iron shipped to Mahomerah but transhipped at Busreh although declared to be for Mahomerah when landed. This matter we represented to H B M Consul k the dif ference of was refunded after some delay. Of late years all our cargo has been landed at Mahomerah dir ect so that we have not had anything to do with the Turkish Custom House, but they make no secret of the fact that they claim Mahomerah as a Turkish port &amp; demand Q% duty. We have moreover had considerable trouble in obtaining draw backs upon wool brought from the Karun District to Busreh to bepressed . They have eventually been recovered through the ance of H B M Consul but there is no doubt that it is the of the Turkish Custom House to throv/ obstacles in the way with Mahonerah. Quite lately they have stopped boats from Mahomerah assist- object of trade on the way down to the sea &amp; levied duty on their cargoes, but as you are aware of the facts of this we need not enter into particulars.IIIIII</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F111/61</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F111/61</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Correspondence and Papers on Persia</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1894/1894</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-04T14:32:07</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (107 folios)</extent><extent>The papers proceed in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 109; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Folio 33 is missing.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume consists of correspondence received by George Nathaniel Curzon, mostly on matters relating to Persia. The letters are from friends, acquaintances and other correspondents, including a number of army officers, diplomats, writers and travellers with an interest in Persia.Many of the letters discuss the internal affairs of Persia and British policy regarding the country, mostly from the perspective of British officers and diplomats who are residing or have visited there. Also discussed are Russian interests in Persia.Reference is made to Curzon being informally known as the Member of Parliament for Persia, given his experience of travelling through the country; references are also made to Curzon's recent book,
                           Persia and the Persian Question(in one of several letters to Curzon, Percy Molesworth Sykes submits a short list of corrections for certain passages).Of particular note are a series of enclosures included in a letter from Albert Houtum-Schindler to Curzon, consisting of a translation of a proclamation from the Shah of Persia, as well as translations of a Persian Government concession and a convention between Persia and Russia on the subject of railways in Persia (ff 42-62). A copy of another Persian Government concession, which is written in French, is also included, as is a short list of additions to an existing list on the genealogy of the Qajar dynasty, which was originally included in an earlier letter from Houtum-Schindler to Curzon (see Mss Eur F111/60, ff 102-156).The French language material consists of the aforementioned concession and one item of correspondence.Other notable correspondents include the following: Charles Edward Yate, British Consul General, Meshed; Sir Henry Mortimer Durand; George Sutherland Mackenzie; Conyngham Greene; Benjamin W Stainton.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Albert Schindler</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Mortimer Durand</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Benjamin W Stainton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>William Conyngham Greene</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Molesworth Sykes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
