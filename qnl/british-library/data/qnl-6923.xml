Memorandum on the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment and Narrative of Events to the end of 1898. The following are the dates on which the various lines to India were completed:— 2. Under a treaty with the Ottoman Government dated 1864,* which still Constantinople-Bagdad line from Bagdad to Khanikin on the Persian frontier and from Bagdad to the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab (Fao), the Govern ment of India undertaking to connect Bushire with Fao by a cable. The materials for the land lines in Turkey were to be supplied by the Indian Government, which was to be repaid by deductions from message revenue, but the salaries of the British Engineers employed were to be defrayed by the Indian Government. The sums advanced on account of materials for the Turkish line amounted to 26,266^., and were finally paid off by Turkey in 1875-76. The section from Bagdad to Khanikin and Teheran was completed on the 13th October 1864, and that from Bagdad to Fao on the 2nd Februarv 1865. 3. At the end of 1864, under a convention between Russia and Persia* the line from Moscow to Tiflis had been extended to Teheran, but the service on this section was very indifferent. On the 27th January 1865 the Teheran Bushire section, consisting of two wires, was also completed by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 4. At the beginning of 1865 there were, therefore, three routes from the Persian Gulf to Europe, one via Bushire, Teheran, Tiflis, and Moscow; another via Bushire, Teheran, Khanikin, and Bagdad, and a third via Fao and Bagdad. The tariff for a message of 20 words from England to India was 51. or Fes. 125, but the transmission was exceedingly slow and unreliable, the average speed being about five days. The average traffic receipts of the Department from March 1865 to 31st March 1869, were about 94,882Z. per annum. 6. On the 15th August 1869 the Gwadur Jask section of the Mekran Coast land line was completed, and, on the 6th November of the same year, a second cable from Jask to Bushire was laid, thus completing a second through line from Karachi to Bushire. From the 1st January 1869 the tariff was reduced to 2Z. 17s. for 20 words and 1/. Us. for 10 words. The traffic earnings during 1869-70 amounted to about 76,370Z. 6. In 1874-75 iron posts were erected between Teheran and Bushire instead of the old wooden ones, and a third wire was attached to them. 7. The delays to messages between England and India were at this time 1 subject of universal complaint. A Parliamentary Select Committee on E India Communications, including Telegraph,” sat and took evidence in 18i and various proposals were made for the improvement of the telegra 755G.

BSlt rate °n the expiration of the Anglo-PeJan Treaty m 18,0. At the Vienna Conference in 1868, the Indian Government agreed to3 subdivide the Persian transit rate at once, and Pcs. 8*50 was allotted to the Teheran-Bushire section, and Pcs. 5 to the Julfa-Teheran section, or more than the one-third promised by the Persian Government to the Company, thus fixino- a distinct tariff for the latter section where none before existed. By the An-lo-Persian Treaty of 1865 the Persian Government agreed to pay the Indian Government the cost of erecting the line from Khamkm to Teheran and Bushire in five annual instalments, and to take all receipts on the Khanikin-Teheran-Bushire line up to * At 2| tomans to the £ sterling. 30,000 tomans,* out of which the debt for materials, &amp;c., was to be paid. The receipts however, never approached this amount, and only a very small part of the debt was paid by 1869. In that year the Company obtained a new concession from Persia, under which they undertook to pay all debts due to the Indian Government, m connection with the Telegraph line (amounting to 42,217/.), in 24 annual instalments to be deducted from the annual royalty payable to Persia. As the Ivhani i - Teheran section was practically given up when the Indo-European Co V J came into the field, and the total receipts had, so far, been far shoit of 30,000 tomans, the Persians were very glad to accept the Company s offer of a fixed annual royalty of 12,000 instead of the uncertain one of any amount up to 30,000 tomans, and for this smaller sum the Company became responsible. 13 This arrangement was ratified in the Anglo-PersianTreaty of 187 2, which also stipulates that the receipts from the Teheran-Bushire section m excess of 12 000 tomans shall “ be divided between the English Government and “ the Indo-European Company in such manner as they themselves may “decide.” It will thus be seen that, in order to assist the Company, the Indian Government agreed to assign to them a share of the transit ra e which under their concession was fixed at one-third, but which is actually at the present time tfths *°r the Julfa-Teheran section, and, in addition to this, to P allow them half of the Teheran-Bushire receipts after deducting the royalty of 12,000 tomans. This moiety is now worth about lo,000Z. per annum. 14 When the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1872 was negotiated, the Persian Government agreed to sell to this Department for 2,000 tomans per annum for three years their frds of the Persian terminal rate on international messages originating or terminating in Persia, and the Company agreed to contribute 1,000 tomans and to divide the receipts equally with the ment. There was no terminal rate at Bushire at this time, and Reuter had ^Qfahlished a c&lt; Packing Agency ” there, which could, under the rates then m force make a profit hy receiving and re-sendmg Indian messages at Bushire, and to prevent this system the Department put on a terminal rate. 15 At the end of three years the purchase system was given up, and Persia was credited with her frds on terminal traffic. 16 In 1871 the Companies complained of the lower rate of tariff on the Turkish route, and objected that their lines, which were paid for and mam- taffied bv private capital, should be undersold by a line which, supported by State Revenues, continued to work at a loss. In consequence of this a Sub-Conference assembled at Berne, and the Turkish tariff was increased to 4/. 10s., or the same rate as via Russia and the Red Sea. 17 In 1871 cables were laid connecting India with China, Australia, and the Ear East, and the traffic via the Companies’ lines, of course largely increased, especially vid the Red Sea. A new Company was also started to work a line vid Denmark and Siberia to Wladiwostock and thence by cables to China and Japan. Partly from fear of competition and partly with the desire of making the rates to the Ear East less prohibitory, the Companies decided at the Berne Sub-Conference to make considerable reductions m their rates as far as India on all traffic with places beyond India, and this system lias been kept up ever since. 18 At the International Telegraph Conference held at Rome m 1872 the rate to India was reduced to 4/. for 20 words vid Russia and the Red Sea5 Eastern Company’s Directors, atIio evidently viewed with great uneasiness the possible improvement of the Constantinople-Fao route and wished to prevent it. Although the Turks would not consent to lease the line to the Government of India, the Ottoman Director-General of Telegraphs agreed to a suggested arrangement with Austria and this Department to improve the Turkish route, and verbally promised not to let the line pass into other hands. Had the United Companies succeeded in obtaining from the Turkish Govern ment a lease of the Asiatic line of telegraph to Eao, it is clear that they would have held in their hand the complete management of the several lines of communication with India and could have manipulated the tariffs almost as they pleased. Low rates between London and Constantinople would have been balanced by extra charges between Constantinople and Eao, and the traffic could without difficulty have been directed by whichever line the Companies for the moment preferred. It can* hardly be doubted that the Eastern Company would have secured a large share of the traffic. 24. Very shortly after this the Department was asked by the Companies to join in the Joint Purse Agreement, and The Joint Parse Agreement. - n a Memorandum written by Colonel Champain on the subject he says: “We were more sensible, I believe, than “ the Companies of the real weakness of our position at Constantinople, and “ were aware that our only safeguard against the amalgamated Companies “ getting into their hands the Eao Line (and so obtaining the command of “ our last feeder) lay in a verbal promise given by the Ottoman Director- “ General. I knew from my Agent at Pera that the Companies were still “ pressing their requests/and at any moment, in those troublous times, the “ Director-General might have been ousted and replaced by a successor who “ could have repudiated the unratified Agreement drawn up by Izzet Effendi “ and myself.” 25. The general situation was therefore at this time somewhat as follows :— The two Companies had, in spite of a protest from this Department, effected a joint purse arrangement between themselves, and under this arrangement the Indo-European Company, whose interests had up to that time been identical with those of this Department, had now become a partner with the rival route, and the least falling-off in speed or accuracy of work by the Indo-European route would benefit instead of damaging its pecuniary interests. The war had caused loss of confidence in the Indo-European route, which it would be difficult to restore. The Turkish line could not be secured by this Department, and might at any time be obtained by the Companies, who would then have absolute control of all the routes to India. 26. When this Department joined in the Joint Purse arrangement there was no longer any inducement to compete for traffic, as there had been before when the two routes were in keen competition, and consequently considerable savings were effected in advertising and agency charges. The terms of agreement provided for a division of all receipts on a certain fixed basis so long as the lines were working, but if any of the lines were interrupted a lower percentage had to be taken, which secured good working and the prompt repairs of any interruptions. 27. It has been argued that this agreement prevents any reduction of tariff, but Art. V. only provides as follows:—“No alteration of tariff or rates for “ messages originating so far as relates to their transit between “ Europe and India to be made without mutual consent,” and this merely stipulates for a continuance of the practice which had been invariably adopted previously of agreeing between ourselves as to modifications of tariff or rules required at successive conferences. According to the International Convention tariffs can only be modified by common consent, and it is expressly laid down that any alterations “ should have for object and effect not the “ creation of competition in charges between existing routes but, on the “ contrary, the opening of as many routes as possible to the public at equal “ rates.”* Even if this Department did not belong to the Joint Purse, we could not reduce our tariffs without the consent of the other administrations of the Telegraph Union, and in face of this regulation they could hardly agree to 7556. B6 any modification which would create a competitive rate and would be stron-ly opposed by the Companies. The fact of belonging to the Joint Purse does no m any way prevent the Government of India from bringing pressure to bear on the Companies to reduce the tariff. 61 28 * In ^ ddi ! iio ? to.the above-mentioned facts, there was another important consideration in joining the Joint Purse Agreement. The Eastern Teleffranh Company had not so many cables as they have now and their lines, and those ot the Indo-European Company, were frequently interrupted—sometimes for long periods, at a time. The insurance system was then a matter of considerable importance, as during a long interruption, the route on which it occurred could earn nothing, and it was often a considerable time before customers could be brought back when the lines were repaired. rmt p &amp; nal ' Io “ t , rurse A!?1 ; eem, ‘ nt provided that the percentages drawn out of the Purse could be revised at the end of any period of seven years from the commencement of the term ; but it was soon found that the Eastern Company were still continuing their endeavours to attract traffic, and it seemed very probable that at the end of seven years they would claim an increased percentage on account of the larger share of traffic carried by them Under these circumstances a supplemental article was agreed to, which excluded these percentages from revision. ° 30. Since that time, however, the situation has changed considerablv in many ways. The interruptions on both routes are few and far between especially on those of the Eastern Company, who have now so many more cables and land lines to rely upon than formerly. The result is that the increased percentages are scarcely ever applied, but it sometimes happens that when there is a large amount of traffic with Egypt or South Africa, the Eastern ompany s cables m the Tied Sea and Mediterranean cannot carry that as well as the Indian and Trans-Indian traffic, and a large amount of extra woik is thrown upon this Department and the Indo-European Teleo-ranh Pume 3117 Wlth ° Ut their receiTin S an y increase in the amount from the w b ™' ° f * In* fact, and of the very largely increased traffic with the il ai East, there can be little doubt that from an insurance point of view the same necessity no longer exists as formerly for this Department and the Indo-European C ompany remaining in partnership with the Eastern Company but two very important questions arise in considering whether the Depart ment could or should withdraw. Eirst. The Agreement seems to have been entered into for an indefinite time, as Art. XXL provides as follows “ T1 , le Agreement to be_ in force until 31st December 1895, or for anv longer period to which the Indo-European Company’s concessions may, whilst the Agreement remains in force, bo extended: but subject to the Agreement being sooner determined as provided by *This Clause refers to a route being per- Clause XVII.,* and subject also manently interrupted for a period exceeding to revision of anv of its nrovisions - a t any time, by mutual agreement, and at the end of any period of seven years from the commencement oi the term by arbitration in case of difference, on either Adminis- tration giving six months’ notice to the others that such a revision is required, and specifying the alterations proposed and the grounds for requiring the same.” + b!L In t; Eur °P ean Com P an y’ s Persian concession has now been extended + if- 1 tI T1 ; el . 1 ; ^ ussian concession expires in 1905, but the Company seems tothmk that it is sure to be renewed, and the German Government have promised the Company an extension of their concession, which also expires in j-90o, provided that the Russian one is renewed. Under these circumstances it seems very doubtful whether this Department could withdraw from the Joint I urse Agreement, even if it desired to do so.7 Secondly. Supposing that the Department could withdraw, would it he advisable to do so ? It must be remembered that this Department is a purely intermediate and transit Administration, depending for its traffic entirely on the Indian Department (which must send all messages by the route marked on the message) and the Indo-European Telegraph Company or the Turkish Administration. The Indo-European Company is really a Bussian Company, with the Bussian and German Directors-General of Telegraphs as official members of its Board of Directors. Supposing that this Department withdrew from the Purse and became a rival, the Indo-European Company would be still bound by its Joint Purse Arrangement entered into with the Eastern Telegraph Company ^ before this Department joined them, and would allow traffic to be diverted to the Eastern route. This would cause financial ruin to this Department by its being starved out, and so long as the Turkish line from Eao to Constantinople remains in its present inefficient condition there will always be the risk that it may be secured by the Eastern Company, and the two Companies would then completely control all the routes to India. 32. On the other hand, so long as this Department remains a partner with the Companies we have an equal voice with them in the control of the telegraph routes to India, and perhaps a greater power than if we were acting in opposition. 33. Again, in the question of the reduction of rates to India, it is a well known fact that the Indian traffic is a most inelastic one, and no reduction in past years seems to have been responded to by an increase in traffic, in fact, for the past few years, the tendency seems to be rather to decrease than to increase. 34. As has been shown before, the practice has always been for the Com panies and this Department to consult and agree beforehand on any alteration of rates, and the Joint Purse Agreement simply ratified this practice. But, supposing that this Department were free and were to wish to reduce its rate in the Persian Gulf, what would be the result ? The present rate between Karachi and Bushire is Ecs. 1.455, so that if, as was suggested many years ago, the Indian terminal rate were to include the transit over the lines of this Department, the through rate would only be reduced to about two shillings and eightpence a word, and if our rate were put down against the Eastern Company, the Indo-European Company would be almost certain to obtain permission to raise their rate in order to prevent a competitive rate, which would be contrary to the Begulations of the International Convention. The Government of India is therefore powerless, whether as a partner in the Joint Purse or as an independent and rival line, to force the Companies to reduce their rates so long as they are only an intermediate administration and have only partial control over the through route. 35 . The position is no doubt unsatisfactory, and the difficulty is to see any way in which reductions can be effected. So long as the interests of the Indo- European Company were identical with our own, matters were much easier, but this is no longer the case, and we cannot depend upon them for support. There can be no doubt that, should the Company not succeed in getting an extension of their Bussian Concession, and the line be taken over and worked by the Bussian and German Governments, there would be a large reduction and probably the working would be just as efficient. At present the Bussian transit rate for messages with India is Ecs. 1.505, while the transit rate for all other messages over the same lines (those destined for Persia, for instance), is only Ees. 0.70, so that the rate is Ecs. 0.805 higher for Indian messages than for any others, and this difference goes to make up the revenues of the Indo-European Company. An extra charge is also levied on all Indian messages passing over the Turkish lines, the transit rate for Indian messages being Ecs. 1.195, and for all others Ees. 1.00. Again the present rate via Turkey to the Indian frontier for messages terminating in India is Ecs. 3.925, but on messages destined for places beyond India it is only Ecs. 3.25. It seems very difficult at the present time to justify this difference8 of rates over the same transit which were originally fixed when the rates to places beyond India were excessive, and it was necessary to reduce them to a non-prohibitive figure. This reason cannot now be urged, however, when the through rate to Australia is almost as cheap as that to India, and it might be possible to induce the Companies to reduce the Cis- Indian transit rate to the same amount as that for places beyond. There can he no practical reason why a message destined for India should not be carried over the lines for the same rate as a message destined for Persia, hut the higher rate on Indian and Far East messages was imposed at the International Sub-Commission on Tariffs, which sat at Berne in 1871 to revise the Indian rates after the formation of the Indo-European and Eastern Telegraph Companies. Up to 1870, messages had been carried by the Govern ment lines, and there was only one transit rate for all kinds of messages passing over the same section, but when the Indo-European Company came into existence it was necessary to provide revenue for it, and so the various transit rates were increased for Indian traffic, and the difference between those rates and the ordinary Government transit rates constituted the Company’s earnings. This system has been kept up ever since at each succeeding Conference, and it is practically the reason for the high rates which have been maintained on Indian traffic. If the Indo-European Company did not exist, and messages were carried by the German and Russian Government lines the rate would no doubt he considerably reduced. The rate via the Indo-European Company was the one originally fixed, and the rate via the Eastern was based on the same figure. The rate via Turkey was fixed at the same amount in order to prevent, in accordance with International rules, a competitive route to the same place. 36. It will he seen that the difficulties in the way of bringing about a reduction in the tariffs to India and beyond are very great. Without the consent of the Companies it is almost impossible to do so, and the only way that remains, therefore, is to bring sufficient pressure upon them to make them agree. 37. The most effectual pressure would, of course, be to acquire the Turkish line from Constantinople to Fao, if possible, for ourselves, even at a heavy outlay, or, if this couid not be done, to assist the German Government in their scheme, and with their assistance and support induce the various Governments, parties to the International Convention, to agree to a reduction in the rates via Turkey. This would compel the Companies to reduce also. 38. The next incident of any importance after the establishment of the Joint Purse Agreement occurred in 1879, when it was found that the old telegraph steamer “ Amberwitch ” required such extensive and costly repairs that it was considered advisable to replace her by a new ship. Accordingly, the present vessel, the “ Patrick Stewart,” named after the first Director-in- Chief of the Department, was bought and fitted out as a cable ship in England. 39. At the International Telegraph Conference held in London in 1879, the Indian Department asked for and obtained an increase of 10 centimes in their terminal rate, so the through rate to India had to be raised to Fes. 5.60 per word from the 1st April 1880. v 40. In 1885 a new cable was laid from Jask to Bushire to replace the old gutta-percha cable of 1864, which had been found to be quite worn out. 41. Owing to the difficulties experienced by the Afghan Boundary Com mission in communicating with Teheran, this Department was asked ‘to take over and work the line from Teheran to Meshed, and the consent of the Persian Government having been obtained, the line was handed over to the Department on the 14th December 1885. At first, all the expenses were borne by the Boundary Commission, but in June 1886 the Government decided to retain the line at an annual cost not exceeding Rs. 20,000, to be divided between the Imperial and Indian Governments. In 1892 the Treasuryi536. C 9 refused to continue to share expenses, and the line has been maintained since that time at the expense of the Government of India. No formal agree ment was ever made, and the traffic receipts belong to the Persian Government, who, however, contribute towards the expenses of maintenance. 42. At the International Telegraph Conference held in Berlin in 1885, the rate between Europe and India was reduced to Ecs. 5 per word via Russia and the Red Sea, and Ecs. 4.50 via Turkey, from 1st July 1886. Considerable reductions were also made on the lines connecting India with the Ear East. 43. In Eebrnary 1887 Colonel Sir John Bateman-Champain died, and was succeeded by Colonel Sir R. M. Smith, who retired in 1888, when the Department was placed under the charge of the Director-General of Indian Telegraphs, Account work and Joint Purse matters being administered by the Accountant-General and Public Works Department of the India Office. 44. Just before his retirement Colonel Sir R. M. Smith visited Persia and obtained a renewal of the two treaties with Persia for working the Teheran, Bushire, and Jask land lines. They were both extended to the year 1905, and presents to the value of about 2,129/. were made to the Shah of Persia and some of his Ministers to secure these renewals. The Indo-European Company also secured a renewal of their Concession from Persia to the same date. 45. In 1891 the Indo-European Telegraph Company secured a further extension of their Concession up to 1925, and the Anglo-Persian Treaties of this Department were also extended to the same date. 46. At the Berlin Telegraph Conference in 1890, negotiations were opened between the Eastern Extension Company and the Australian Colonies for a reduction in the rate between Europe and Australasia, and in 1891 agreements were drawn up and submitted to the Cis-Indian Joint Purse, and after some discussion approved of. Under this arrangement the rate between Europe and Australia was reduced from 1st May 1891 to 4s. per word under the following conditions :— The total revenue for Australasian traffic, excluding outpayments, derived by the Cis-Indian Administrations and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company during 1889 was taken as the basis, and was fixed at 237,736/. If, during any subsequent year, the total revenue of these Administrations (including that with Queensland and New Zealand) should fall below that amount, the Australasian Colonies agreed to pay to the Eastern Extension Company half the amount so lost, which sum the Eastern Extension Company credits to the Common Eund. The other half is borne by the Cis-Indian Admini strations and the Eastern Extension Company in the proportions agreed upon, except that the Department’s loss shall not exceed 1,775/. and the Indo-European Telegraph Company’s loss 2,800/. in any one year. The contribution of the Cis-Indian Administrations is that which each partner draws out of the Cis-Indian Common Purse on account of Australasian traffic. The Eastern Telegraph Company also pays in its receipts on South African traffic. This is then divided as follows :— Eastern Extension Company Eastern Telegraph Company for South African traffic - - - - Cis-Indian Administrations and this 35*25 per cent, is divided as follows:— Eastern Telegraph Company - - - Indo-European Telegraph Company - Indo-European Telegraph Department 64*57 per cent. *18 35*25 80*53 12*03 7*4410 47. At the Paris Conference the Indian transit between Bombay and Madras was reduced to 35 centimes, and from the 1st July 1891 the rate for Press messages was reduced from 24 to 12 centimes. . -From 1st January 1893 the rate between Burope and Australia was increased to 4s. 9c?., as it was found that the loss sustained at the 4s. rate was excessive. 49. In 1893 the control of the Department was placed directly under the Secretary of State for India, and Mr. B. T. Ffinch was transferred to London as Director-in-Chief from 1st April 1893. 50. In 1894 it was found that the proportion paid into the Joint Purse by. this Department was greater than it should be in comparison with that paid in by the Indo-European Company, and on investigation it was discovered that this was due to the large amount of traffic passing between India and Persia since the opening of the Meshed line, which, 'under the terms of the Joint Purse Agreement, had to be credited to the Purse as Indian traffic, although no allowance had been made for such traffic when the Joint Purse was arranged. After considerable discussion the Companies agreed to revise the percentages to be drawn out of the Purse, and from 1st January 1894 this Department has received 18*06 instead of 17*27 per cent, of the Indian traffic earnings. This has resulted in an increased revenue of nearly 3,000?. a year for the Department. 51. In 1895 the Departmental Cable Steamer was employed in layin°* a new cable between Ceylon aud India, which had been manufactured in our Cable Factory at Manora. 52. In April 1896, a Supplemental Agreement was entered into regarding the Australasian Message Fund, under which, from 1st May 1895, the amount guaranteed was reduced to 227,000?. and the sum payable bv the Colonies in any one year was limited to 10,000?. The Agreement was also made binding for at least five years. 53. Sites for new quarters for the Director and Staff of the Persian Section at leheran were purchased from the Persian Government and the title deeds deposited at the British Legation. The buildings for the Staff were occupied in November 1896 and for the Director in October 1897. 54. The International Telegraph Conference was held at Buda-Pesth in 1896. The principal alterations affecting India were, 1 * increase in the length of a permissible word in telegrams wholly in plain language, as distinguished from telegram wholly in code or partly in code and partly in plain language, 15 letters being allowed as the maximum instead of 10 as heretofore. 2. An increase in the number of figures and signs permissible as one word when written in series, as regards every class of telegram, five characters being counted as a word in place of three as heretofore. 3. Substantial reductions in the rates between India and the East and South Africa, including Mauritius, as also between India and the Straits, China and Japan; as well as minor reductions in their terminal rates by the Russian and Persian Governments. India was represented at this Conference by Mr. S. V. P. Luke, C.I.E and Mr. B. T. Ffinch, C.I.E. ’ ’ d 55. In January 1897 a serious riot occurred at Bushire owing to certain bench marks having been fixed near our Office by the Survey of India Department, v Inch the Persians, incited by their Seyeds, considered to be the cause of the want of rain. 56. In the same year the Shah was assassinated, and for some time anarchy reigned in Southern Persia and there were many disturbances in different parts of the country, but the telegraph officials and lines escaped any serious injury. ^ J11 57. In December 1897 a much more serious disturbance occurred in Perso- Belucbistan, when Mr. Graves, the Temporary Superintendent, was murdered near Rapch River, and, later on, there was a rising of the Beluchis in Mekran which had to he quelled by Indian and Persian troops. Much damage was done to the land line in this second disturbance. B. T. Pfinch, Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department.

Convention between Great Britain and Turkey for the establishment of Telegraphic communication between India and the Ottoman Territory. Signed in the English and French languages at Constantinople, 3rd September 1864.* Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottoman, being desirous to establish between their respective States telegraphic communications, by means of which India, connected by a submarine cable with the Ottoman territory at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, will be in telegraphic commu nication with Turkey, and consequently with all the other States of Europe, have agreed to conclude a Telegraphic Convention, and with that object have named as their Plenipotentiaries, that is to say: Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Bight Honourable Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer, a Member of Her Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Her Majesty’s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Sublime Porte. And His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottomans, His Highness Mahomed Emin Ali Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs, decorated with the Imperial Orders of the Osmanie of the Medjidie, and of Merit of the first class in brilliants, Grand Cross of several Foreign Orders. Who after having com municated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following Articles :— Article I.—The Ottoman Government will continue, at its own cost, to the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, the main telegraphic line of Asia now existing between Scutari of Constantinople and Bagdad, and will connect the said main lines in the direction of Khanakain, with the Persian land lines which communicate with the submarine cable at Bushire. The maintenance and repairs of the said Ottoman lines will be at the charge of the Ottoman Administration. II. On the other hand, the Government of India will lay down, at its own expense, a submarine telegraphic cable, which, starting from some point of the British Indian Empire and touching at Bushire, will terminate at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, where it will join the Ottoman land line. The maintenance and repairs of this cable shall be at the expense of the Indian Administration. III. His Majesty the Sultan authorises the establishment on Ottoman territory at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, of a British Telegraph Office, with a staff, which shall not exceed in number 50 persons, placed under the exclusive orders of a British Station Master, and which, as well as the apparatus and all the instruments requisite for working the submarine line, shall be at the expense of the British Government. IV. The aforesaid British Office shall be located in the same building occupied by the Ottoman station at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, with a view to facilitate the combined operations of the common service. The apparatus of the Ottoman service and that of the British service at that joint station shall be placed in separate compartments, but in close proximity to each other, and shall not be connected. The exchange of messages shall take place immediately on their receipt, the officers handing them to each other through a window, and the service 7556. * Ratifications exchanged at Constantinople, 31st October 1864. D14 of the British and Ottoman offices shall be permanent. The rent and cost of maintenance of the mixed telegraphic station shall be shared in equal proportions by the British and Ottoman Administrations. Y. It is well understood that the active service of the British Office on Ottoman territory shall be limited to the receipt and delivery by hand to the Ottoman Office of the messages arriving from India by the submarine cable • to the transmission of those which are delivered to it by the Ottoman Office • and lastly, to the superintendence and maintenance of a safe and regular submarine communication between the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab* and The DirecWin-Chief of the mixed station shall devolve on the Ottoman Administration but without the right of interfering in the internal admini stration of the British Office. JI; or f Gr f 0 eusure promptitude in the Indo-European correspondence and its regular transmission and receipt the Ottoman Government will not tad to establish a permanent service at Bagdad and Fao, as well as at the majority of stations on the main line of Asia between Constantinople and ±ao, and to appoint thereto a staff possessing a knowledge of the English anguage sufficient for the perfect performance of that important service. t} 16 0t toman Government being desirous that the expeditious transit of the Indo-European messages over its territory should lie rendered stdl more satisfactory, engages to establish at Constantinople an office of transmission devoted exclusively to the service of messages to and from nd;a. Its officers, and especially the Station-master, shall be selected from those of the Ottoman telegraph officials who are thoroughly conversant with the English language. V 1, Ottoman Government will take the necessary measures to secure that one uire of the mam line from Constantinople to Eao, shall be always exclusively devoted to Indo-European messages. In case this wire should get out of order, or m case of a press of traffic, the official Indo-European messages may be forwarded by one of the wires intended for local traffic, but after the official despatches of the Ottoman Government. In that case pm ate Indo-European despatches shall be forwarded, together with private messages already deposited at the office, and in alternative order with those fomi^posTtelf ma ^ ^ een ^ 1&lt;3 ll0Ur at latter may have , ^ Convention of Brussels, of 30th June 1858, in all that relates to the details of the telegraphic service shall be mutually observed by the IX It is agreed between the High Contracting Parties that the rates for Indo-European messages sent by the Ottoman lines in Asia throughout their whole extent from Constantinople to Eao, or to the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanakam and mce versa, shall not exceed the limit of f 7 1 f V a oy i f f!' a S1 » g e ra . ess ?Se sent from Constantinople to Fao or vise versa and of 2-3 francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Khanakain or mce versa, as also that the rates for messages traversing the whole ZZTiT r ne E° m J nd i a t0 Fao - or t0 Bush ire and vice shall not i.iSSom w r ''”' 02 - ,r “ f ” ~ h ■■■si* tap.-h «,d • ' 7lie ad “™ist r ations of the two contracting Governments will commu nicate to each other with the least possible delay, the tariff of their stations frn , r0nt n 111 S °A far ?- S they may have reference to the Indo-Ottoman frontier ot hao According to that tariff the rates shall he mutuaUv accounted for m the monthly accounts of messages exchanged between ti e two administrations at the aforesaid frontier of Eao. 3 ' ,ctweon the nf?J' T!ic rnl ’ fua ' account for telegraphic rates, expenses of postage and . pi esses, &amp;e., shall be checked at the expiration of every month’ and15 settled quarterly. The liquidation and payment of the surplus which may be due to either administration shall take place at the close of each quarter. The accounts of each administration shall enumerate only the rates in debit: they shall be drawn up by the Ottoman Administration in francs and centimes, the total being reduced to shillings and pence; and by the British Administration in shillings and pence, the total being reduced to francs and centimes. The reduction of these sums shall be calculated at the rate of 1 pound sterling = 25 francs. 1 shilling = 1 franc 25 centimes. 1 penny := 10 centimes. XII. The balance which may accrue from the quarterly liquidation, in favour of one or other of the administrations, may be paid either in Turkish pounds, in pounds sterling, or in 20-franc pieces. Should the balance be in favour of the Indian Administration, payment shall be made by Turkey into the hands of the delegate of that Administration at Constantinople; and should it be in favour of the Ottoman Administration, payment shall be made by the aforesaid delegate to the- Director-General of the Ottoman telegraphs. XIII. In order to facilitate and accelerate the operations relating to the reciprocal settlement of the quarterly accounts with the Central Admi nistration of Ottoman telegraphs, the Indian Government shall be entitled to appoint a delegate to reside at Constantinople, the seat of that Admi nistration. The Ottomam Government shall likewise be entitled to name a delegate for the same purpose, to reside at the seat of the Central Telegraphic Administration of the Indian Government. The respective delegates shall be entitled to receive from the respective Central Administrations all the information and explanations which they may require. XIY. All messages to or from India may be forwarded indifferently, as may be most oonvenient for the service, either by the line of Bussorah or by that of Khanakain. XV. It is well understood that the Ottoman Government shall be in account current and shall have direct administrative relations with the Government of India in respect to all messages, whether sent by the nontier of Eao or by the Persian route of Khanakain. Thus the two contracting Governments shall not be in account current and shall not have direct administrative relations with Persia except in respect to payment foi those messages only which shall have traversed the lersian lines 5 so that as regards Indo-European messages, the two High Contracting Parties shall only account to the Persian Government for the amount due to it for their transit along the Persian lines between Khanakain and Bushire. XVI. The present Convention shall come into operation as soon as the submarine cable shall be in communication with the land lines of Turkey and of India, and shall remain in force for three years from the day on which the ratifications are exchanged. Nevertheless, the High Contracting Parties may introduce into it, according as necessity may require, such modifications as may be considered bv common agreement to be useful and indispensable. At the end of three years the present Convention shall be deemed to be in force for an indefinite term, and until the expiration of six months, reckoning from the date on which either of the parties shall have made known to the other its intention to put an end to the same. XVII. The present Convention shall be ratified, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Constantinople as soon as possible. Done at Constantinople on the 3rd day of September 1S6I. (l.s.)

From the commencement of 1865 to the end of 1868 the tariff vid Turkey was 51. for 20 words, and 41. 2s. 6d. via Russia. The Turkish route was very defective, and messages took from five to 17 days in transit. The route via Russia was even worse, and scarcely any of the traffic went that way. In 1869 the tariff was lowered to 21. 17s. for 20 words and 1/. 10s for 10 words. The monopoly vid Turkey and the bad state of communication continued, and it will be seen from Statement 1 that the reduction in tariff resulted only in a large falling off in receipts. In 1871 the tariff via Russia and the Red Sea was raised to 41. 10s. for 20 words and to 3Z. 10s. for 10 words, while vid Turkey it remained at It. 17s. and 11. Ivs. The Eastern and Indo-European Companies had now commenced operations, and cables had been laid beyond India which increased the total amount of traffic, but the receipts of this Department tell oft owing to the opposition route vid the Red Sea. The earnings of the chief feeder of our Department, the Indo-European Company during 1870 and 1871 having not only been too little to pay any dividend, but insufficient for the maintenance of the line, to save the Company from collapse, the Turkish tariff was, in 1872, raised by pressure to the level of the other rates, that is, it was made 41. 10s. and half messages were suppressed. ° '^ ro . n , 1 r pY ^ le f^iff via the Red Sea and Russia was reduced to 41 and via Turkey to 3Z. 15s. ’ From 15th November 1873 the tariff was again reduced to Fes. 50 for 10 words messages, and Fes. 5 for each additional word between London and India only. At the St. Petersburg Conference in 1875 a mean rate of Fes. 5*50 Was introduced between India and Europe vid Russia and the Red Sea and .res. 5 via Turkey. At the London Conference of 1879 the rate was raised to Fes. 5-60 per word in consequence of an increase of 10 centimes in the Indian terminal rate, and Fes. o • 10 vid Turkey. At the Berim. Conference of 1885 the rate was again reduced to Fes 5 per word via Russia and the Red Sea, and Fes. 4*50 vid Turkey, and this rate has remained in force ever since. At the Rome Conference of 1872 the system was first adopted of charffinff a lower rate between Europe and India on messages destined for places beyond India, and this procedure has been maintained ever since at each succeeding Conference. At first the rate was graduated according to the distance beyond India for which the message was destined, and it was not until the St. Petersburg Conference of 1875 that one rate was adopted for all places beyond India. r . attached Statement No. Ill shows the various tariffs which have been m force since the opening of the lines, and the division between the different Governments and Administrations. It also shows the Russian and Turkish transit rates on messages for India, and the rate charged for messages transiting the same frontiers, but not going as far as India&amp; 17 On Indian messages</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002fb_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/D148</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002fb</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/D148</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum on the Indo-European Telegraph Department and Narrative of Events to the end of 1898'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1899/1899</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-05-18T15:18:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (10 folios)</extent><extent>The main body of the memorandum is located on folios 1 to 6, and the appendix follows on folios 7 to 10.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the first folio and terminates at the last folio; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: the file also contains an original pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The memorandum concerns telegraphic communication between Britain and India, with a particular focus on the telegraph lines routed via the Persian Gulf region, and therefore the Indo-European Telegraph Company. It was authored by Benjamin Traill Ffinch, Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; a department of the Government of India.It outlines how the telegraph lines through the Persian Gulf developed over time, and the concessions granted by various governments to permit their establishment. It also notes how charges have varied over time, and how various international telegraph conferences have affected them. It also explains the rise of competition — over traffic to India — between the Indo-European Telegraph and the Eastern Telegraph companies, and how this led to the signing of the Joint Purse Agreement between them. It also explains that the interests of the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department have diverged. It therefore claims that the prevailing circumstances make it very difficult for the Government of India to push down prices.An appendices section is included with the following content:'No. 1 Convention between Great Britain and Turkey for the establishment of Telegraphic communication between India and the Ottoman Territory'. 3 September 1864, ff 7-8;'No. 2 Memorandum on Tariffs between Europe and India', f 8v;'No. 3 Tariffs to India and beyond from 1863 to present time', f 9;'No. 4 Statement showing Traffic Receipts of Departments from October 1864 to 31st March 1898', ff 9v-10.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Telegraph Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002fb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
