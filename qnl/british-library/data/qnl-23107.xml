Your telepram No. 14 from Riyadh ( of 7th March: American request for permission to construct airfields in Saudi Arabia) As far as we are aware the existing routes will be can- able of handling the flow of aircraft to the Par Eastern front and there would therefore aonear to be no immediate military necessity for these airfields. On the other hand, they are 7 likely to be useful to the American oil company whose operations are in themselves of some imnortance to the - war effort. Ibn Saud may also think that the construction free of charge of modern airfields in his territory may facilitate internal communications. If so, he might care to stipulate that all constructions and installations shall become Saudi Arabian property at the termination of the war. 2. Por your own information the Americans have already accented a stipulation of this ( kind in resnect of the military airfield constructed by them at Bora Bora in French Oceania whereby all constructions will become French property on the departure of the American Forces and within six months of the end of the war. 3. In these circumstances we can only suggest to Ibn Sand that he should consider the American request purely from the point of view of hr s own interests.

Resident o,. h-+ ^ ~' ktY c y ©TOP SECRET No.C/292. Political Agency, Bahrain, 1st March 1945 From Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., poll deal Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon*ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.T/ 7 dated the 24th of February 1945 and to report briefly on American penetration in the Bahrain and Trucial Coast areas. 2* Political After a not very fiercely contested rearguard action by . the Foreign Office His Majesty f s Government agreed to the inclusion informally of Bahrain within the sphere of the Americar Consul whose appointment to Dhahran was notified in June 1944. * Some time later this officials informal sphere was enlarged by the inclusion of the Trucial Coast, Qatar, and Muscat. On the 2nd September 1944 the American Consulate was opened at Dhahran and Mr. Parker T. Hart and his assistant Mr. Me Intosh have paid regular weekly visits to Bahrain to deal with the affairs of American subjects here and to receive and*despatch by courier their official mails. I do not think it necessary in this brief review to comment on this very serious political move on the part of the united States Government as you have a full record of the conversations prior to the,opening of the Consulate on your own files. Mr. Parker T* Hart interested himself immediately in business matters and later in political matters apparently having been instructed by the Department of state to make enquiries from me with regard to nis Highness 1 attitude to the proposal by the Bahrain Petroleum Company to introduce Italian labour. It seemed to me at the time that these enquiries should more properly have been made from His Majesty 1 ! /Embassy/4 2 . 0 Embassy in Washington by the state Department than by a Vice consul from the Political Agent in Bahrain. Later Mr. Hart evinced a desire to visit the Trucial Coast and the territory of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat,and after an exchange of telegrams with His Majesty's Government at ^7 suggestion he accompanied me on a tour of the Trucial coast. The somewhat blunt and undiplomatic method of approach which Mr* Hart and his assistant adopt when dealing with at political am other matters I confess I had_first found dis tinctly irritating, but now on better acquaintance with the gentlemen concerned I realize that it is not intentional lack of manners but a combination of a national characteristic and lack of experience. 3. Commercial I have already written to you on the subject of American commercial advertising and there is little which I need add to the information contained in that letter. Consistently since the beginning of the war, and even before, American periodicals containing advertisements for all kinds of goods have been coming onto the Persian Gulf. Recently, owing to the inability i of the United Kingdom and India to supply our commercial needs, we have been forced to turn to the United States of America for essential supplies. Attractive offers have been received by local business houses,and trade journals are sent gratis even to not very important merchants in Dubai with a view to keeping American goods and produce continually before the public eye. In this they are successful and there is little doubt that unless we can increase our endeavours to advertise our wares iind supply them the United States of America will obtain a footing in the markets of the Persian Gulf from which it will be very difficult indeed to eject her..4. Aeronautical * There are at present 270 members of the United States Army Transport corps stationed at Bahrain and 53 of the same branch of the United States Array stationed at Sharjah* Prima rily of course these forces are to deal with war traffic but I have little doubt that it is the intention of the United States Civil Air Lines to make the 'utmost use they can of important lap4ing grounds such as Bahrain* Casual remarks dropped by possibly irresponsible officers have indicated to me that they do not intend to leave when the war is over but will be in active competition with our own air lines. It is i interesting to note that many of the officers who are connected with the United States Army Transport Corps are themselves peacetime employees of American Civil Air Lines and that this is not only true of the senior but also of the junior ranks* I expect that it will not be long before the Arabian American Oil Company asks permission for either their own planes or those of an air line to operate between Bahrain and Dhahran* I suggest that the British Overseas Airways Corpo ration should themselves now explore the possibility of intro ducing such a service with say two D.C.3 aircraft. I believe that with the Refinery construction programme now in progress at Ras Tanurah there would be ample freight and enough passen-. gers to show a satisfactory return* 5* W/T Communication s Both here and at Sharjah the American Air Force has established an elaborate system of w/T communication and Direction Finding. It is true that the buildings which house these installations are the property of the Royal Air Force and that they have been constructed on land which is leased or owned by the Air Ministry, but the installed instruments themselves are the property of the United States of America and I shall not be surprised if objections are raised by the /United4 . © United States Government to any suggestion on our part that these w/T installations and Direction Finding stations should be removed as soon as the *rar with Japan terminates. The view will be put forward that they are essential to American Civil air lines operating in or through this area and I see no reason to suppose that American airmen will agree after the ■** war to do what they now refuse to do and that is to accept our weather reports and our Direction Finding Control. They have come and they will take a great deal of removing. The insistence on direct communication between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America by the American oil interests operating in Saudi Arabia should have warned the Directors of Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited that an attempt was being made to oust them from their position as monopolists in Saudi Arabia. Eventually they were aroused but only to half measures and their particularly futile suggestion of increasing the strength of their Bahrain establishment and power station and of arranging a suitable means of communi cation between Dhahran and Bahrain met with the reply that it richly deserved. America has indicated her desire to erect for the Saudi Arabian Government a transmitting and receiving station at Dhahran to be manned by Americans and has kindly offered to accept telegrams from Bahrain. The ridiculous contention of Messrs, cable and Wireless Limited that atmospheric conditions in Bahrain were so much better than those twenty miles away at Dhahran was on the whole very kindly treated by the Department of state. 6. The interest which the American public have taken in Arabian affairs, in particular with regard to the pipe line project, is a clear indication that the united States is turning its attention more and more to Eastern problems. Their large oil interests both in Bahrain and on the mainland of Saudi Arabia are certainly some excuse for the new policy which /thethe State Department seems to be adopting with regard to the t/vhile the establishment of an American Consulate at Dhahran was perhaps natural in order to facilitate the transac tion ol consulate business with American subjects employed by th&lt; Arabian American Oil Company and to conduct negotiations, should they become necessary, between the local government officials and the management of the Company there appears to be no real jus edification lor including Bahrain in the consul* s sphere or for that matter the Trucial Coast and the Qatar peninsula. For some time past there has been an American Naval Observer and two officers assisting him stationed in Bahrain. I am t^xably Llx&gt; Uj ‘ me&lt; * by the Bahrain Petroleum Company management that until the commencement of the Refinery construction f .i.ogramme at Has Tanurah these gentlemen found it difficult to find sufficient work to occupy a few hours in the morning and even now I gather time hangs somewhat heavily on their hands. It will be interesting to know just exactly why it was necessary to appoint so many American Naval Officers to Bahrain. It I* apparent that both politically and commercially the Persian Gulf is attracting more and more attention from our Iriends across the Atlantic and unless we qre careful we shall find ourselves playing second fiddle under a trans-Atlantic conductor. Persian Gulf but important though these be they do not seem « altogether to justify that policy. I hav«* the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, BahrainSECRET ♦ D.O. No. C/702. Dated the 11th of July, 1945. My dear Colonel, Please refer to Hicklnbotham*s despatch No. c/292 dated the 1st of March, 1945, to Sir Geoffrey prior on the subject of American penetration in my area. . V 2. I did not know Mr. Parker T. Hart but from Hickinbotham's description of him I would say that the Vice-Consul with whom I have had to deal, viz., Mr. william L. Sands, is an entirely different proposition. My personal relations with him are . of the most cordial kind. He is from South Carolina, aged 33, has travelled since his youth, appears to be an excellent linguist, is a good conversationalist, of pleasant address, and considerable intelligence. I think it would be most unwise to under-rate him or anyone like him. He comes over here about once a fortnight and was, of course, here oftener during the trial of the case Bahrain State versus Minnick. The significant thing (and the reason I am writing this letter) is that Sands has several times said to me that he has such a lot to do here - and he certainly has - or he makes a great fuss about doing what he has to doi Now the next move he is t going to make • at least I would do so in his place - is to put up a case to the State Department for an office in Bahrain. I do not think we will have much trouble in dealing with this because as the B.M.C. personnel are gradually leaving, the number of Americans here will make the case for , ; . \ f an office progressively weaker. However, I thought you might The Hon»ble Lieut-Col. A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,be interested to know what, I think, is going on* Sands is being relieved shortly* 3. incidentally, Minnick went to jail on the 4th of July* When Bird remarked on this to Sands, the latter said »*the British always have the last word'* i • Yours sincerely, NS(484/2/49) Restricted.
