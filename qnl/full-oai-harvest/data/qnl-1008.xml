The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these proposed changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ.In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohamerrah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.The correspondence discusses disturbances on the land owned by Shaikh Ahmad caused by his fellaheen (agricultural workers) allegedly refusing to pay rent, committing acts of sabotage and some of them demanding to be made proprietors of the land in place of the Shaikh. Within the correspondence, British officials discuss the Iraqi government's role in fostering the discontent and discuss the appropriate response with both Shaikh Aḥmad and the Government of Iraq.The file contains a Foreign Office memorandum that outlines the sequence of events regarding the Shaikhs' date gardens from 1914 until 1933 (ff 22-25).The file also contains details regarding a legal case brought against Shaikh Ahmad by members of the Al Zuhair family regarding the ownership of some of his land holdings in Iraq.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ce#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ce#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ce#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
