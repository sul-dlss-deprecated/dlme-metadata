Notable correspondents include Lieutenant-Colonel Malcolm John Meade, Captain Percy Molesworth Sykes, Albert Houtum-Schindler, Henry Mortimer Durand (British Minister at Tehran), John Richard Preece (British Consul at Ispahan), Thomas Henry Sanderson (Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), and Robert Theodore Gunther.Many of the letters discuss the internal affairs of Persia and British policy regarding that country, mostly from the perspective of British officers and diplomats who are residing or have visited there. Some of the correspondents congratulate Curzon on his recent appointment as Viceroy of India, a post which he took up in January 1899.Of particular note is an account by Horace Montagu Rumbold of his travels through Persia during October 1897, which records his observations and opinions of the country's government, its local rulers, and whether British rule of southern Persia would be welcomed by its inhabitants (ff 17-35).The file also includes copies of printed correspondence received by the Prime Minister, the Marquess of Salisbury (Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil), from British representatives in Constantinople (ff 50-52), which discuss a petition submitted by Count Kapnist, nephew of the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, to the Ottoman Minister for Public Works, in a bid for a concession for the construction of a railway line from the Mediterranean coast to the Persian Gulf (the correspondence includes a translation of the petition).The file concludes with newspaper cuttings from the
                           Times of India, the
                           Daily Mailand the
                           Morning Post, which contain articles reporting on Persia and on Curzon's selection as Viceroy.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Mortimer Durand</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Albert Schindler</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Horace George Montagu Rumbold</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prime Minister</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Molesworth Sykes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railway lines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b0#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b0#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b0#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b0#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
