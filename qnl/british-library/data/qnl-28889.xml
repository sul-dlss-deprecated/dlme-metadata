From the numbers quoted by United States Minister, it would appear that all the women and children regarding whom the corresoordcnce has taken place are still at Baghdad, and that\„nrisoners said to have been sent towards Mosul are other British prisoners such as captured aeroplanisis etc. As regards women end children, their relations are strongly against their being sent across to Eeyrout, on the grounds that even guards could not be relied on to take ad equate care of them. We certainly cannot arrange to receive them on river at the nresent moment, which for other reasons seems inop- portune for resuming negotiations.

The Consul reported in a despatch dated the 2nd instnnt that on that date such a letter was actually delivered to a British subject in Bagdad by messenger from Basso rah in which it was stated that two others had been sent previously. This letter inquired regarding all the Bri tish-born subjects in Bagdad and gave names of those now in Bassorah who had been permitted to leave Turkey; it also transmitted war news. The Consul calls attention to the great impropriety2 . of such correspondence in view of the fact that, if inter cepted hy the Ottoman authorities, it may prove impossi ble for him to protect the British subjects in Bagdad un der the resulting aggravated conditions.

Sir, In reply to your despatch No 27, (63534/15) of the 29th Hay received yesterday, 19th June, I have the honourto report as follows:- On Tuesday February 23rd at noon, I sent the following telegram to the Foreign Department, Delhi “Urgent. Rosario three residency staff five 'servants arrived refugees expelled from Baghdad. * “Please authorise me send them Bombay.* The reply was received at this station at 11.pm on Saturday night 27th, and was delivered to me early on Sunday morning 28th. On Monday 1st March through Cook, I sent the party to Port Said, and on the 3rd telegraphed to Delhi thft sore were embarking The Right Honourable Dir Edward Orey, Bart., K.G., M.P., , -'*C., t &lt;c., Foreign Office, London, S.W.,that day. It is irapossiblft for a consul to havo shown more loyalty and promptitude in serving the Indian Government. I claim the entire credit for hum * this brief and simple incident. On February 2?,r\d, the ss 'Siracusa* arrived from Mersina with ?,C&gt; Englishmen, whose passports are registered at this office. Nos 3024-3049; 23 from Baghdad, and 3 from Anatolia. After then are entered 4 Anglo-Indians, 3050-33, namely: M.A. Rosario, two brothers Thaddeus, and Bharuoha. Early A on the 23rd the thirty called on me, and soon after -wards they left for England, Basrah or Bombay. Having dealt with the 26 Englishmen, I turned to Mr Rosario, as the senior of the four Anglo-Indians led him into the court-room, sat him down and asked him to write me a statement on which I could base a telegram. I welcomed him first as a refugee from another consulate-general, and was about to telegraph to you. But he said that they belonged to a Resi- -dency, and that I should telegraph to India. If Ihad telegraphed to the Foreign Office, I think that I should have hart an earlier answer and have avoided this matter by sending them to Port Said on the 86th February, Mr Rosario asked me to let him have some money for his staff. X told him that if he had any monjry he should use it as long as it lasted, and keep his own accounts; and that as soon as I received authority from India I should pay all expenses of travelling. He admitted that he had some money. Mr Rosario called again on the 3. r &gt;th, and I informed him that no answer had been received. This was repeated, I think, on the 86th and 87th. Meanwhile, Ms five # oavasses had been asking for money at ray gate and had been referred to hiru On the 28th., one of the Englishmen from Baghdad came to complain that these oavasses had been demanding money from him with threats. He was almost in tears, I reassured him, and told him to call a policeman and to give the cavass into custody if the offence was repeated, I also told Mr Rosario to warn his cavasses not to annoy the Englishman in question.to go with him to Borabay. I wan not sure whether these cev assas 'Rre un^er my jurisdiction, or were Ottomans, ( Arab or Turk ) of Baghdad. Early on Monday, 1st March, I sent ray clerk, Mr Paul, with a letter to Cook's manager, who at once sent the party to Port Said, paid for their passages and hotel, and embarked them without delay. As regards advances of money, the Consular Regula- -t’ons concerning British Indians are very strict and categoric. ( pages 21f&gt;-7). Mr Rosario and his friends had money, and relief from me was not absolutely ne— -oeasary for those few days. As soon as authority was received they were assisted with the greatest rapidity. Mr Rosario has punished me i’or my weakness in yielding to him. I should have telegraphed to the Foreign Office on February 22nd. Mr Rosario is quite correct as to the courteous treatment of our refugees by the American consuls. I have already expressed my thanks to my American coll--*agua and to Captain Barton Backer, of the 'Tan- -nessaa' for his kindness to our British subjects in distress.

In present circumstances Mr. Mergenthauis finding the Turks more than usually difficult to deal with, all the more so as they are constant ly making new and sometimes contradictory proposals for the release of British subjects. Their last proposal was to detain all males of military age, and we took advantage of this to point out that there was no justification for the detention of women and children, some of whom, as for instance, those at Bagdad, would suffer in health from re maining in hot and unhealthy climates. The real question is whether the women and children at Bagdad are in greater danger and exposed to more discomfort than other British women and children in other parts of Turkey. If theythey are, end if their release by exchange could be arranged for locally, without reference to Constantinople, there would be no objection to an fU twAr attempt to obtain their departure in the manner suggested by hr. Arthur Whitley, On the other hand if the Turkish authorities at Constantinople conceived the idea that they could use women and children for purposes of barter a disagreeable situation might easily arise. We have received and sent over to the India Office officially a warning from the United ft; &lt;/Vw States Consul at Bagdad against attempts on the part of the relatives of tne women and children to communicate with them from Basra by native messen gers.messengers. The Consul does not give his reasons for this warning, hut it is conceivable that, if any attempt of the sort were made the Turks might believe, or affect to believe, that the women were acting as channels of communication betv/een our military authorities at Basra, and possibly disloyal Arabs at Bagdad. You will see from this that tne question of these women is one which requires delicate handling.and address— The Under secretary of State, ^ Foreign Office, London. fn any further communication on the subject, please quote xo. 65350/15. r © May 26th, 1915.

SUBJECT: Deportation of British Indian subjects. The Honorable Henry Morgenthau, American Ambassador Extraordinary And Plenipotentiary, Constantinople, Turkey. 3ir : I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s reply to this Consulate’s Telegram No. 12 of February 14, 1915, regarding the deportation of British Indian subjects from Bagdad and Mosul to places in the interior, especially Sivas, which destina tion was later mentioned as Orfa and Aleppo. This Consulate from time to time has written the Embassy regarding these people and has received various instructions as to their welfare. The local Government, at the present time, seems to have no definite policy regarding these people. There have been a number of men sent away but up to the pre sent time, I have heard of no women. As stated in this of fice’s telegrams, I have been trying to have lists of those sent given to me also their destinations so that they may be traced. I am endeavoring to ascertain what accommodations, if any, are furnished these men but in no case have I been able to find that they were really properly provided for. This Con sulate has furnished money for, in some cases, the purchase of mules for the deportees to ride, in others, paid for the seats occupied in a carriage and in a number of cases, given money for food. At the present time it is impossible to tell how many have been sent, for the promise of the Governor-Gen eral although made a week ago, has not yet been fulfilled. Those- 2 - Those who have been sent away have been charged w4th neddling in political affairs or else to have been so con nected with the British Consulate as to nalce their presence now undesirable. One case I have investigated, and found that the nan was out of work and that he is reported to have attenpted or succeeded in turning Kohammedan and then to have secured about five liras with the view of leaving Bagdad, He was sent away on February 13, 1915 with Dr, Johnson. I be lieve he was to go to Aleppo. Another case was that of a man called the Chief of the Pilgrim Guides, that is the Chief of those men who act as guides to the many Indian pilgrims who come to the cities near Bagdad which have Mohammedan shrines. \fter some considerable investigation, this man was asked to try to secure a letter from an Ulema ( Mohammedan religious head ) stating that any charges against this man that he was meddling in political matters were unfounded. This letter was procured and ultimately presented, by friends of this man, to the authorities, and after some days in the local Government prison he was freed. Referring to telegram No. 15 of February 17, 1915, re garding the sending of all registered British Indian subjects to Aleppo, I have not pressed this matter for the reason that at the present time, if I am successful in obtaining the co operation of the local authorities in the comparatively few cases of deportation that are occurring, and can have these few sent to Aleppo, it appears to be the wiser plan; but should any attempt be made to send a number of these persons, it would doubtless be better to have a very definite arrangement with the local government. As the Embassy can see by this and other despatches, the problem of taking about 2,500 per sons overland from Bagdad to Aleppo is very great, and if it is9 to OfT.. ni ri#2w betosa $xjte05dir won isid d’Brii’ :o fte^qnetia torfB fteiuoee tWB v'fieK kBT ibw erf ere 11 f exii' £oIIbo w neai esorit ©rfJ effiioo ec'-oa xe tl uveB ot yv# ( bs&amp;xi ni gii i 11 ) b om n« fiexnooxg ixortina erli ^ dii noai'xq ixaleH ♦QqqoIA ri9%% Gfij jfi 3 noi^axoqo 16 10 80830 inet v»el {g2X4F)if i a ^nij )X erf^ A laiiio fcn &lt; ilxsyo fenofc - 3 - is possible to find some other solution for these problems it would be well. With all due respect to those concerned, it might work more ill to the British Indian Subjects to be in concentration camps, than to be in their present position. The lot of these people is not good # however. It has been reported to me that of the pensions which this office pays, the local Turkish Authorities exact some in taxes, al though not more than they exact from the Turkish subjects, but these people hare always paid a part of their income from these pensions in much the same way as they are now being taxed. There are many British Indian subjects living in Bedjef and rerbela that this office aannot communicate with ex cept by mail, which is a very questionable method in view of local conditions. It seems to be the established policy of the local government to prevent in every way the British subjects from maintaining themselves. In the event that local conditions continue to be the same for some considerable period of time, some working arrangements must be established. Perhaps it is impossible to consider the repatriation of these people via Bassorah to India. Many of them have their homes and practically all they possess here, having given up their domicile in India. Very many, too, are Mohammedans and they would find it almost impossible to live outside of their present homes, unless entirely supported by charity. I am receiving a number of reports that the conditions of these British Indian subjects who have lived on the money forwarded from India by their relatives there, are becoming less favorable, and I anticipate that they will require con- . - - siderable financial assistance if the war continues many months more. It is difficult to present all the details of the local situation-4- aituation to the Embaaay but ao aoon aa the policy of the local government becomea better defined, thia Conaulate will endeavor to carry out the inatructiona of the Embaaay con- tnineo in ita telegram ITo. 15. so aoon aa matters change, thia office will again communicate with the Embaaay. I have the honor to he.

A detailed note of all that happened at Baghdad between the 1st and 21st November was made by Mr. M. A. Rosario and left by him in the desk which he occupied at the American Consulate at Baghdad. Notes made by Mr. Rosario from the 22nd November up to the 12th December 1914 were destroyed by him on the 13th idem as he feared an examination of his personal effects prior to his being expelled (with the other British subjects) from Baghdad. The present note is written from memory and some items may have escaped our memory. The dates given may also be inaccurate.The following members of the staff lived in the Residency premises to protect Government property as far as possible. This was done with the consent uf Major Scott and by the advice of Mr. Brissel, the American Consul :— Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant and Treasury Officer. „ M. A. Rosario, Head Clerk. ,, M. G. Thaddeus, Accountant-Treasurer. „ S. J. Thaddeus, 2nd Clerk. On the 2nd of November at about 9 a. m. we noticed that a large number of Turkish troops and policemen surrounded the Residency buildings and they would not allow our servants to go out to bring us food. About II a. m. the Commandant of Gendarmerie accom panied by the Mudir of Police and about 10 officers and a number of policemen and soldiers entered the Residency courtyard. The Chief mason who built the Residency was also brought in for the purpose of showing them the “secret” cellars which local rumour said contained a large quantity of arms and ammunition. The Commandant ordered the Residency staff, the sepoys, gawasses and servants to fall in in the Residency courtyard. He then asked Mr. Rosario (Head Clerk) to accompany him and show him over the Residency sirdabs (cellars). Not knowing Turkish, Mr. Rosario asked Mr. S. J. Thaddeus (clerk) to accompany him as interpreter. Mr. Rosario suggested that the American Consul should be present during the inspection. The Commandant refused to listen and said that the American Consul had nothing to do in the matter, and that the Consular staff were responsible. The Commandant then ordered Mr. Rosario to precede him into the sirdabs and began inspecting every room and cellar in the buildings. They found and took away the following : — About 22 old muzzle-loading pistols. About 3 old three-cornered bayonets (belonging to the old “ Comet”). 1 ride found in Major Scott's uniform case (which they ordered to break open). During the inspection the Italian Consul happened to call to see the Commandant of the Gendarmes. Finding an opportunity, Mr. Rosario asked the Italian Consul to inform the American Consul of what was going on. The American Consul called, but it seems he was not allowed to enter till the inspection was nearly over. After the inspection the Mudir of Police sealed the door of the Treasury strong room and held Mr. M. G. Thaddeus (Accountant-Treasurer) personally responsible that the seal w«s not tampered with. The Accountant-Treasurer's keys of the strong room inner and outer doors were taken by the Mudir of the Police, but the Treasury Officer's key of the strong room inner door remained with Mr. Gaskin (Treasury Officer). After the inspection a police officer drew out a document in Turkish stating the result of their inspection and noted down the articles they took away. They made Alessrs. Gaskin, M. A. Rosario, M. G. Thaddeus and S. J. Thaddeus sign this paper. The Postmaster who was living outside was not permitted to enter the Residency during this inspection aud the lock of the Post Office door and the Comet's store room were broken open. These doors were subsequently sealed by the Commandant. The keys of the Residency dispensary and the medical store room were also taken charge of by the Mudir of the Police. After the inspection the Commandant and the Mudir of Police placed a Lieutenant, 50 soldiers and a policeman in charge of the buildings and its inmates. The Mudir called that night at about 8 p.m. to see that we were on the premises and did so every night during the first week. Subsequently this duty was allotted to his assistant the Commissaire who used to call almost every night for the same purpose. On the same afternoon (i.e., 2-11-19Id) the Government saddles were taken away and a receipt for them promised but never sent. On the 3rd November two medical officers came and took away most of the medicines and almost all the surgical instruments they found in the dispensary and medical store room. Lists were made by them as well as by us of everything taken away. They promised to pass a receipt for these articles according to the list, but eventually they did not do so. Sometime between the 3rd and 6th November with the permission of the Mudir of the Police, the current files, maps, books, vouchers and registers of the ireasury, &amp;c., were carried away to the American Consulate. During the same period every room in the Residency and the Residency Surgeon's house (with the exception of those occupied by the Residency staff) were sealed jointly by the Mudir of the Police and the American Consul. These rooms contained dlffTecords, Government furniture and some private furniture belonging to Colonel Erskine and Major Scott. The Mudir of the Police made Mr. S. J. Thaddeus responsible that these seals were not broken. The seals were daily inspected by Mr. S. J. Thaddeus and the Police officer in charge. In the meantime Mr. Brissel obtained permission from the authorities for two members of the Residency staff to attend his Consulate daily, as there were a number of British subjects who were constantly applying to him for assistance and advice.Such assistance was chiefly asked for by British Indians who were called upon— (1) to pay certain taxes which they had hitherto been exempted, viz., income tax, war tax, a contribution of a sheepskin per head (o clothe the Turkish soldiers, a fine towards the loss of a Turkish mail bag (which bad about that time mysteri ously disappeared) and certain other contributions ; (2) of vexatious treatment by the Turkish Authorities who called on them at all hours of the night and day to enquire whether they would leave the country or become Turkish subjects, whereas the orders were that no foreigner could leave the country; and (3) why they, as good moslems, did not join the Turkish army. To take down such statements Messrs. M. A. Rosario (Head Clerk) and M. G. Thaddeus (Accountant-Treasurer) attended the American Consulate daily up to the 21st of November after which date they were not allowed to leave the Residency precincts. On the 6th of November each member of the Residency staff &gt;vas ordered to go to his house where he was met by the Mudir of Police, or his Assistant, accompanied %v a few policemen to inspect their private property. In Mr. Gaskin's house they confiscated a sporting gun and a few cartridges. In Mr. M. G. Thaddeus's house they took nothing away but he was ordered not to remove his boat and bicycle from the premises. After the inspection and on our return to the Residency we were told that there was no objection to our moving about the town, provided that at least one of us remained in the Residency. Next, Mr. Gaskin was summoned to appear before the Turkish Courts with regard to his throwing into the river a portion of the ammunition belonging to the Residency Guard. His * case was eventually transferred to the Court Martial, and on the 22nd November 1914 he was sentenced to three months imprisonment and was confined to jail on that day. £ On the evening of the 20th November our sepoys were suddenly conveyed from the Residency to the Turkish barracks, and after a few days we heard that one of the men had died. Mr. Brissel informed us that he had paid a visit to the sepoys and found them com fortable. On the morning of the 22nd of November we were ordered not to leave the Residency premises and at the same time Mr. M. H. Mohsin (Vice-Consul, Karbala) was brought in under guard and ordered to live in the Residency. Mr. C. D. Bharucha, Postmaster, who had hitherto lived outside the Residency and who used to call occasionally, happened to be in the Residency that morning. He, too, was detained and was told to fetch hiS kit and remain with the other members of the Residency staff. Saiyid Muzhar Husain, the Persian writer of the Residency, Akbar Jan and Hasan Hindi, Honorary Lumbardars at Kazimain, were also brought into the Residency on the 22nd of November, but these three persons were confined in a room under strict police observation. Saiyid Muzhar Husain succeeded after about a fortnight's imprisonment in obtaining his liberty through the influence of certain Mujtahids. Akbar Jan, Honorary Lumbardar of Kazimain, who, owing to illness, was subsequently removed from the Residency to the C. M. S. Hospital for treatment, was also ordered to leave Baghdad, but at the last moment owing to his ill state of health was kept back by the Mudir of the Police. We may mention here that, during the whole of this period, we were very much harassed by the police officer in charge. He always came into our rooms at all hours of the day and night and we were unable to resent his presence. He appeared very friendly, but it was impossible not to see that he was simply spying on us. He made it a point of looking into our papers and sometimes as if in a joke examining our pockets. After one of his visTts to our rooms when he was accompanied by two other policemen, a safety razor belonging to Mr. Rosario was missed. Subsequently we were given to understand that this officer &amp; sent daily reports to his chief of every trifle that occurred in the Residency. Beginning from the 27th of November the European British and French community began to arrive in the Residency. Everyday a batch was brought in. Subsequently the married men brought in their families. The married men were accommodated at the Residency Surgeon's house. The bachelors were accommodated in the Residency building; Mr. Brissel having obtained permission to open most of the rooms previously sealed by him and the Mudir of the Police. On the 10th December, at about noon, orders were sent to us by the Police to leave for Deir-el-zor within two hours. On Mr. Brissel's representations this order was modified and we were told to be ready to leave within three days. On the 12th, we were permitted to go to the bazaar, under police escort, to make such purchases as were needed for our journey. 13 The American Consul represented the case of certain elderly or sickly persons who, he thought, were unfit to travel during tne winter, viz. : — (1) Mr. Chavauis (Frenchman) on account of his age.(2) Mr. Rosario (Head Clerk, Residency) on account of his age. (3) l)r. Johnson (C.M.S.) on account of his age. (1) Mr. Tucker (Eastern Rank) on account of poor health. Nos. 1 and 3 were exempted after examination by three Turkish doctors. Nos. 2 and 4 were considered fit to travel. Subsequently, Mr. Tod (Manager of Stephen Lynef &amp; Co., and Consul for Sweden) obtained permission for his Assistant, Mr. Walker (a married man with a wife and child at Baghdad), to remain at Baghdad. Mr. Brissel also obtained permission for Mr. Harter (an Assistant in the American firm of Mac Andrews &amp; Forbes, Co.) to remain at Baghdad to look after the interest of the said American firm. Another Englishman, Mr. Levark (Agent for David Sassoon &amp; Co., Ltd.) managed to remain at Baghdad, but we do not know how he obtained permission. He and his family were also not confined in the Residency premises. On the 12th of December, Mr. G askj p was permitted to go to his house and arrange for his I departure on the following day with the other British subjects. On the 13th, we left Baghdad ^ on the understanding that the Residency staff must proceed to Constantinople, when they would be repatriated, and the other British subjects to remain at Aleppo until further orders. Before leaving Baghdad the American Consul advanced us (the Residency staff) Liras 10 on account of expenses for the journey. This sum was distributed between the following Government servants as au advance to be accounted for by them. Liras. Ewaz Ali, Ghulam Ali, Baqir and Abood, Qawasses, @ L.£ each... 2 Mr. S. J. Thaddeus, 2nd Clerk ... ... t &gt; £ „ M. G. Thaddeus, Accountant-Treasurer ... ... 6 Total ... 10 The Residency Treasury, The Treasury cash balance on the 31st of October 1914 amounted to Liras 2,216’295 and that of the 1st of November amounted to Liras 1,194 (odd). In addition to this', there was a sum of Liras 269 odd due to Mr. M. H. Mohsin, British Vice-Consul, Karbala; about Liras 60 belonging to the British Cemetery Fund; about Liras 35 to the Assessors^ Fund and the rest to the Oudh Bequest. The total of all the above items amounted to Liras 1,539*183. A detailed statement of the above was made out in triplicate and signed by Major Scott and the American Consul before the former’s departure from Baghdad. Each officer retained a copy. All the account vouchers, subsidiary registers, pension payment orders, the accounts ready for despatch to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, for previous months, &amp;c., with the exception of the cash book and the daily balance sheet, were deposited at the American Consulate on the 6th of November 1914. The cash book and the daily balance sheet remained at the Residency by order of the Mudir of Police, who wished to check the amount in the strong room and compare it with these registers. The following members of the Residency staff received au advance of three months’ pay [i.e., up to the end of January 1915) by the orders of Major Norman Scott: — (l) Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant; (2) Mr. J. P. Nersessian, Native Agent; (3) Mr. M. A. Rosario, Head Clerk; (4) Mr. M. G. Thaddeus, Accountant- Treasurer; (5) Mr. Abdur Rabb Baiq, Dragoman; (6) Mr. S. J. Thaddeus, 2nd Clerk; and (7) Saiyid Muzhar Husain, Persian writer. On the l£th November, the Mudir of Police, accompanied by a military officer and clerk from the Daitardar’s (Accountant-General of the Vilayat of Baghdad) office came over to the Residency, opened the strong room and took over all he found there in the presence of Mr. M. G. Thaddeus, Accountant-Treasurer of the Residency. The Treasury Officer's keys were sent for and obtained by the Mudir of Police from Mr. Gaskin, who was then in jail. The strong room contained— (1) Cash, liras 1,589*183. (2) Silverware belonging to Nawab Sujjad Ali Khan. (3) „ ,, Ahmad Hasan Khan. (4) Jewelleries „ Sofiah Khanum. (5) Silverware belonging to Government. A. B. —Nos. 2 to 4 were mortgaged for the amount advanced to them by the Eastern Bank to defray the expenses of their departures from Turkey before hostilities. The silverware were in two sealed gunny bags, and the jewelleries belonging to Sofiah Khanum were in thesafe of the Eastern Bank deposited in the Residency strong room. The Mudir of Police made Mr. Manwaring open the safe for the inspection and on finding the jewelleries they took charge of them. A detailed list of Nos. 1 to 4 was made out in Turkish and signed by the Mudir. Mr. M. G. Thaddeus was made to sign this list. In the meantime Mr. M. G. Thaddeus also made a list of these and handed it over to the American Consul who had arrived at the Residency towards the end of these proceedings. No list was allowed to be made of Government silver. The Treasury Officer's and Accountant-Treasurer's keys of the Chubb's locks and safe in use in the Treasury strong room were taken over by the police in charge on the same day.

A Committee was formed under the presidency of Mr. Tod, assisted by the following members :— Messrs. Whitley, Cree and Soane. The arrangements for fSlkig the whole caravan, the expenses for which had been advanced by the American Consuls at Baghdad, Aleppo and Mersina, were undertaken by the Com mittee. Each member of the caravan was told to provide himself with a plate, a cup, a kniie, fork and spoon. Members of the caravan provided themselves with extra food, as it was impossible for the commissariat to make adequate arrangements and they also had to pay porterage at each station and other petty expenses. To meet this expenditure, the Committee paid each member of the caravan an allowance of Gold Pias 5 per day for the period between loth December 1914 to 24th January 1915, and Gold Pias 7 per day from the 25th January to 13th February 1915. Difficulties experienced en route. At the beginning of the journey we bad as many as 15 genderraes for our protection, but the further we got from Baghdad the number decreased till on arrival at Aleppo we only had two such officials. All along the journey we were prohibited from moving about at the halting stations. We were taken into a Khan in the evening and taken out the next morning. 1'he Kuans were always guarded by gendarmes. At Deir-el-zor, where we halted a whole day to rest the horses we were permitted to go out to the public baths in batches accompanied by a policeman! At Aleppo, where we halted for eight days, we were told to report ourselves every morning at the police station and after signing our names in the Police book we were free to &lt;ro about where we liked. After leaving Aleppo we were again kept close prisoners at the halting stations except at Islabiah, where we were permitted to go to a stream close to our Khan to wash our clothes and bathe. At Tarsus we had at first full liberty, but gradually this was curtailed. From Tarsus to Mersina we were accompanied by the head of the Police, and at the latter town we were kept close prisoners in a hotel. Throughout the journey we noticed that the feelings of the people were very hostile. At most halting places we were cursed, spat upon and stones thrown at us. At Haditha after we had installed ourselves in the Khan, we were peremptorily ordered to quit it for some lurkish and German officers who came there after us. We proposed camping outside the Khan, but were told that if we did not move further we should be shot. We, therefore^moved some two hours distance in the desert and encamped there for the night. Again at Hasan Bayh we ha o encamp in the desert owing to the village being full of soldiers.11 Hasan Bayli is situated on the Anti Taurus range aod the cold in the open desert at night ! was intense. At Maskana, one of our party was whipped by a military officer simply because he happened to be smoking when that officer passed him. Another member of our ! caravan (the Dragoman of the Russian Consulate) was also whipped for no reason at all. That evening the Turkish officers in the barracks made it a point of cursing the [ British Government and its subjects for our special edification. One of our party was asked whether there were no females in our company which we thought very significant. At Maskana we were, for the first time, not allowed to remain in the Khan. We were forced to stay at the barracks for the night. The so-called “ barracks ^ was nothing better than an ordinary dirty stable with insufficient accommodation for which the gendarmes claimed and received Sagh Piad 5 per head for the night. At this station many of our people were robbed of their belongings by the soldiers. Their rapacity caused such alarm that it was decided to keep our commissariat stored under lock and key and to go without food that night. For the same reason no one was able to sleep that night. The whole of the journey was very trying. On several occasions for want of rooms at the stations we had to remain in our Arabanas where sleep was impossible for fear of being robbed or otherwise attacked. This fear was enhanced by the fact that we had heard at Baghdad that we would be shot when some distance out of the city. When we had rooms, they were full of horse duno- and vermin and when it happened to rain, the rooms leaked terribly. We slept four or rive in a room hardly enough for two and took care to barricade the door with our boxes for fear of attack. The only weapon of defence in our possession was our table knives. The journey from Massaka to Osmaniah was terrible. Transport was lacking. After four ' days of anxious waiting we could only get seven Arabanas, which were insufficient to carry our luggage, consequently some of the luggage had to be thrown away. We had to travel on foot f or f our d a vs There were no roads to speak of. We had to walk about nine hours a day over j stoney boulders or ankle deep in mud and had to sleep in the open when it was raining. During this journey of four days we not only had to walk but also had to assist in pushing the carriages up the Anti Taurus range. Consular staff. \s noted above, Mr. M. H. Mohsin, British Vice-Consul, Karbala, left for Constantinople on the 5th January.’ On hearing of this arrangement we interviewed the American Consul at Aleppo and explained to him the promise made to us by the authorities at Baghdad that all the Consular staff should proceed to Constantinople. The Consul telegraphed to his Embassy at Constantinople and we understood that he also made representations to the Wall of Aleppo, but without success. Meanwhile Mr. Tod had entered into communication with Djemal Pasha and obtained his promise that the caravan should proceed to Mersina via Alexandra, where we should be repatriated. . We left Aleppo on the 9th January for Alexandretta, but on our arrival at the Bail an Pass on the nth we were ordered to return by the military authorities there, as it was said that Alexaudretta was being bombarded by the British fleet and the road to Mersma was closed We bad therefore, to retrace our steps towards Aleppo until we arnved at Katina station and took the train for Radjon, a distance of about three hours. We had during six days journey covered a distance of about 6J hours from Aleppo. We arrived at Tarsus on the 24th January and halted there till the 14th February. This was due to some misunderstanding of Diemal Pasha’s orders by the Wali of Adana. During this period the Wall of Adana received orders to send us first to Kaisarieh then to Broosa. Arrangements were being made to proceed to the latter port, when on the night of the 14th February the American Consular Agent informed us that orders had just been received from Djemal Pasha for our repatriation from Mersina It is impossible to describe our feelings on receipt of this news \\e cheered to aman un.i we were asked by the police to restrain our joy. We left Tarsus at noon on the 16th and Teft Mersina on the evening of the 10th February by the Italian steamer “ Siracusa arriving at Alexandria on the morning of the 22nd February. ... • » n On our arrival at Alexandria we reported ourselves to His Britannic Majesty s Consul- General there who said he knew nothing about us, and after telephoning to Government house asked us to proceed thither. At the Government house we were told to call again at 8--0 p. 11 . We called allthe appointed time when Binbashi (Major) Ingram asked us to give him a report of any military movements we had noticed during our journey in Turkey Mr Rosario gave a written note (copy attached), while M. G. Tbaddeus stated what he had noticed « real (purport attached). Major Ingram also adviced us to call again on H.s Britannic Majesty's Consul-General about our journey to Bombay. On the 23rd morning we called at the Consulate-General. We were received with scant courtesy and only Mr. Rosario was admitted. On his representing that he was one of the Baghdad Consular staff, he was informed nothing could be done until they had received our American passports which were taken from us by the police on board.

Military information by Mr. Marap G. Thaddeus, Acconntant-Treaaurer of the BritUh Residency at Baghdad. On the 13th December 1914.—I saw a large motor trolley at the Nokta station (only five Ba^hdaT^ fr0m 0n en( l uir y 1 was told that it carried guns from Aleppo to On the loth December. —At Rumadi I saw another two motor trolleys of the same type and size At the Khan at Rumadi there were two locked rooms which, according to the Khanchi contained motor car accessories and ammunitions. On the 16th December.—Between Rumadi and Hit we met a motor car with six passengers They stopped one of our policemen and enquired as to who we were. This car I ^was told, carried the new Commander of Troops for the army at Basrah and live officers. Two of the officers were no doubt Germans. After about an hour's journey we met another car which was apparently carrying motor accessories. This car carried four Turkish officers and a mechanician. It also contained about half a dozen tins of petrol, also other cases, the contents of which did not appear to be arms or ammunition. 19th December.—krn\e&amp; Ana. According to what I heard there the town was “ full of soldiers'. I saw only about a hundred soldiers grouped in the street opposite the barracks. In the Khan, where we stayed the night, we met some German officers and others in mufti! They seemed to be friendly and talked to some of our party. Here as well as at Haditha it was reported that 50,000 soldiers had left Aleppo for Maskana, where they were about to proceed down the Euphrates by “ Shakhtoors' (flat-bottomed oblong boats used on the Euphrates) bound to Basrah and also that some thousands of cavalry were o’oin»’ down to Basrah by land, but during the whole journey to Aleppo we did not come across such laro-e bodies of men. 20lh to 31st December. —Between Ana and Aleppo we met parties of cavalry “ Mujahidins' (warriors for the Faith) every day. The total number I do not think exceeded SOt). In one instance the officer in charge of a group of 50 of these men came round and spoke to us in French. He was very civil. He said that he was on his way back to Damascus, where he had taken some Mujahidins from the district of Deir-el-zor. Durino* the conversation he remarked that it was a great mistake on the part of Turkey to mix in this great war, and then twice asked us “ why did Turkey go to war '; of course we could not speak to him much about politics, he took leave very politely and rode away. There is no doubt that he was one of the thousands of officers who are against the war. The Mujahidins supplied themselves with their own horses and did not hesitate to exchange their animals with a better horse or mule passing on the road despite the bitter protest of the owners. 29th December. —In the Khan at Hammam there was a locked room which was said to contain aims and ammunition. 1st to 9th January 1915. —At Aleppo there was a rumour that Djemal Pasha had a quarter of a million strong under his command in Syria. That he had wired to Constantinople unless he was given another quarter of a. million he was not prepared to undertake the march against Egypt. It was very difficult for us to ascertain the exact number of soldiers but the people at Aleppo believed iu the above figures. In our hotel at Aleppo we met G erman officers wearing the Turkish new cans with the brass badge “ Mujahidjj' pinned to it. ■ ,m,rr '' 10th January .—On our way from Bairam Oghli to Kirk Khan, two companies of soldiers passed us en lout+e, some cf them looked like Germans. Numerous caravaos of camels and mules carried their equipment. A large number of these animals carried boxes of ammunition and a number of boxes containing rifles. A machine gun Caccompanied the above soldiers. Outside the village of Kirk Khan about 1,000 soldiers (partly cavalry) had encamped, and here we were told that a large number of troops had passed through during the previous week. 11th January. —Between Kirk Khan and Bailan Pass (where we were ordered to return back) we met some Mujahidins, but not many in number. Here we were told that Bailan was “ full of soldiers ”, the usual term used in Turkey, but it is hard to say how many strong make a “ full of soldiers The road between Aleppo and Kirk Khan is suitable for the carriage of guns, troops, &amp;c., but between the latter place and Bailan Pass it is difficult, as one has to mount hills about 4,000 feet above the sea level. The military people were constructing roads here. 12th January. — At Hammam we met a large encampment of troops. This was the company we met outside Kirk Khan on the 10th. They had covered a distance of four hours by carriage in two days. 13th January. —At Katma railway station we had to stay 12 hours waiting for our train. During our stay there four trains (about 25 waggons each) laden with soldiers came from the direction of Radjou for Aleppo. From this station a number of transport animals and three waggons full of provisions w T ere sent down to Aleppo by train. I was told here by a soldier that they had not received their pay of G. S. P. 5 (l(bf) per mensem for the last six months and consequently most of the soldiers robbed the public whenever they had the chance. 14th January. —A train full of troops and their equipment left Radjou by railway station for Aleppo this morning. Round about this station we met troops in camp waiting for the next train. We also saw some 200 camels loaded with military stores camping near the station. At Massaka (a Kurdish village on the hill about two miles from Radjou railway station) where we stayed four days, some 5,000 troops came from the direction of Osmaniah bound for Aleppo. There was great difficulty in accommodating them in this small village. Most of them had to sleep in the open air exposed to rain and heavy dew. Some of the troopa arriving at this station had to stay three, four or five days for lack of railway service. The railway was running short of coal. Blocks of wood were cut and made ready -for the use of the locomotives. When at Massaka some Kurdish Aghas (chiefs) came over from their village of two hours’ distance to see us. They were very polite and one of them offered to supply us with provision and wines. Their offer was declined with thanks. At any rate their attitude f towards the British did not seem to be hostile even though in those days the British | men-of-wars were bombarding the shores of Alexandretta, a few hours’ distance from their . villages. 18th January. —We left Massaka in the morning and reached a Kurdish village named Odun Kupri in the evening, where we halted for the night. F&gt;n route 1 noticed a number of cavalry and over 100 camels carrying ammunition. The roads are not at all suit able for transport. We met a motor car carrying a Turkish officer. He required the assist ance of six men to push his car through the stones and mud which covered the whole road. We met another motor car discarded on the way. Nothing at all in the shape of provision or accommodation could be had at this village. Before getting to this village we passed over a wooden bridge (called Odun Kupri). To the left and about four miles distant of this bridge there is another village which is now exclusively used for military stores. 19th and 20th January road between the Kurdish village and Islahiab is unbearable and it is wonderful how the Turkish soldiers could walk across this road and at the same time carry their equipment. 2Ut January. —After an ascent and descent of about 6,000 feet over the sea level we reached Hasan Beyli. To-day we met a full regiment making their way towards Radjou and a large number of transport camels carrying ammunition and military equipment. Hasan Beyli was cram full of soldiers. We could not even get a room to sleep in. Outside the village I noticed more than 100 limbers guarded by soldiers, and also other military equipment waiting the arrival of transport animals. On the way we also met Turkish officers commandeering buffalo carts for military use. 22nd January.—En route to Osmaniah to-day we met several bodies of troops on their way down. A caravan of over 150 camels loaded with ammunition also passed us. In the afternoon eight guns of carts (said to be six inch) led by eight buffaloes each, passed us. All these were going in the direction of Radjou. 'I he road to-day was tolerably goo . ^ At Osmaniah I was told that since the beginning of the war 85,000 soldiers have passed | that station on their way to Aleppo and also a number of guns. It was reported that good many of the soldiers passing through Osmaniah had no rifles. Here I was also told that the troops are sick and tired of their treatment and will show no resistance when in war. On the 24th January 1915, when on our way by train, we saw a number of guns (probably eight) of the similar pattern and size we met before at a station between Adana am Tarsus.Note by Mr. Rosario on military matters. We left Baghdad on the afternoon of the 13th December 1914. We met with no adyenture iintil the afternoon of the !8th December, when at Haditha, where we arrived at about 4.-30 p.m We had scarcely settled ourselves at the caravansarai when we were told that a number of Gem an and Turkish officers with about SOU soldiers had arrived and that we shall have to quit the Khan to make room for the officers. We attempted to sleep in the vicinity of the Khan, but were told that, if we did not move on, we should be fired on. We out^n the desert 1 ^ r ° m ^ bau an d for the first time since leaving Baghdad we camped On th e 27th December on our journey from Tibni to Sabkha we passed two parties of soldiers about 40 or 50 stroog. On the afternoon of the 30th December we reached Meskeneh and were, for the first time, prevented from occupying a Khan and compelled to take quarters at the gendarmen station. At sunset a Commandant (Turk) of the Turkish t t e 1 re Wlt K , a number of troops (said to be about 50). The troops were lodged m the Khan which we had intended to occupy. The Commandant called at the gendarmen station and without any cause brutally struck with his whip one of the members otourcaravan. We arrived at Aleppo on the afternoon of 1 st January and stayed there till the morning of the 9th January 1915. Aleppo was full of soldiers arriving from the north and proceeding southwards, some said for Baghdad while others for Egypt. We could not how ever obtain an approximate number of the troops arriving and leaving, and we were afraid to make minute enquiries, as we were known to belong to the Consular staff at Baghdad. We heard it said that Jamal Pasha, who was in command of the troops for Egypt had declined to proceed thither unless he had half a million of men, * ™ the 10t ? Ja A n 1 uar y bet ween Banam Oghly and Hammam saw two companies of soldiers on their way to Aleppo. They had a commissariat equipment which looked as if they were tor European troops. (I don t remember seeing camp equipment with the troops at Baghdad). JNumerous camel caravans conveying ammunition also passed us on the way. /m , 0n x the 1 tth January on nearing Kuruk Khan we passed a camp of about 1,000 soldiers (Taboor) on their way to Aleppo. On the 12th January on our way back to Bariam Oghly we met the same soldiers encamped at Hamam, where we halted for tiffin. We then heard that most of these soldiers were Armenian. On the morning of the 13th January we reached Katma station on our way to Adana. We halted all day at the station and noticed four trains load of soldiers on their way to Aleppo; we left Katma at 9-45 p.m. and arrived at Radjou station at midnight, here we found that we had to again travel by carts to reach the railhead at Osmaniah. On the 14th January we took up our quarters at a village called Massaka, an hour s distance from Radjou station. The road between the station and village was full of soldiers and about 200 camels laden with stores. 0n ]; he 16th Jau uary there must have been between 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers encamped between the village and Radjou station. Soldiers have been coming from the north and nro- ceeding south daily between 14th and 17th January, while we were halting at Massaka Left Massaka on the 18th January and en route met a regiment of cavalry and about 100 camels onthe way to Aleppo On the 21st January on our way to Hasan Beyly saw about 1,100 troops on their way to Aleppo. At Hasan Beyly, where we arrived the same evening the village was full of soldiers and we had to encamp outside the village. ® i2«d January. On our way to Oemapiah we passed several bodie°s of troops and a caravan eonMstmg of 165 camels laden mth ammunition; later on we passed eight guns (said to be 475 centimetres) led by buffaloes (eight buffaloes to each gnn). Halted at Osmaniah on the 23rd January. Here we were told that about 83,000 soldiers had passed this place for Aleppo this I consider to be an exaggeration. We were also told that the soldiers were sick' and tired of this war and would not offer much resistance. t* Left Gsmaniah for Adana and Tarsus. At Osmaniah station met five ntish Indians (Moslems) who said they were three days out from Constantinople. They said they were about 80 in number who had joined the Turkish army (voluntarily or under compul- smn they would not say). 1 hey wore a nondescript uniform ; without arms which they said they would obtain at Damascus. They said they had received no pay but were promised a bonus after the war Before further information could be obtained from them they P were hurried off utn Tk i brethren. On our way between Adana and Tarsus we saw several trucks laden with guns of the same calibre we had seen on our way to Osmaniah. On 8th February, 3 guns, 41 horses and mules and 20 carts laden with ammunition wer e n t , TarS ' 8 m , the W Y, t0 Ad L ana - At the hotel 8t Aleppo we met some German officers, who had on their hats or helmets the word Mujahidin written in the vernacular.Copy. ^No. 52644.

As previously reported, all British firms in Bagdad have been closed and their goods sequestered. The local authorities have repeatedly telegraphed to Constantinople asking what they shall do next and up to the present time, no definite reply has been received. Until this reply is received , I expect matters will continue in much the same way as they have been for the last three weeks. I have been repeatedly assured that the British subjects in the vicinity of Bagdad will receive no bodily harm but as they are now permitted to go about the streets at will and to visit among themselves and, with the exception of the cessation of their businesses, are conducting their normal life, it may be that later their privileges will be cur tailed . The Indian Sepoys, the guard of the Consulate-General have been removed and put in fairly comfortable quarters in the military school just outside the limits of Bagdad. So far they report reasonable treatment. InIn view of the fact that the Vali told me I might freely viait with the British aubjects here, I have taken occasion to call upon many of them at intervals and to have them call at this Consulate for the discussion of their interests. Those of the British, who, by reason of their long residence in this country have come to positions of more or less influence, are voluntarily doing what they can to keep on good terms with the officials, and, I am pleased to say, have been able to settle many minor difficulties without referring them to this office. I have encouraged this policy. There seems to be no indication that the Iritish and French will be allowed to leave Bagdad. Upon the receipt of the Embassy's telegram I went to the Serai to have it confirmed but up to the present time, I can obtain no in formation that is of value. On Saturday, November 14, 1914, the Acting Vali told me that perhaps permission would be definitely granted but that it did not seem lively that the men of ages fit for fighting would be allowed to depart. I have discussed the status of the Britishers here with many of them and it seems to be the general opinion that the two things especially desirable are to secure the personal safety of the Britishers and to keep secure for them their personal property, ’while I am endeavouring toto in no way appear to be violating a position of strict neutrality, I am hoping to use my position as intermediary in such a way as to secure for all concerned the smoothest possible management of a difficult situation.

Foreign Office r: February 20th, 1915 Immediate Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter P.611/15 and to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, copy of a Note which was addressed to the United States Ambassador on the 18th instant requesting that the United States Consul at Bagdad might be instructed to do what was possible on behalf of the Indian guard lately attached to His Majesty’s Consulate-General in that city. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that it is unnecessary to request the United States Ambassador to cause special instructions to be sent to the United States Consul to render assistance to Messrs. Johnson and Levack and to any other British or British-Indian subjects remaining in Bagdad, as he has no reason to believe that the Consul will do less for British subjects Under Secretary of State, India Office.(18993/15). subjects than has been done by his colleagues in other places in Turkey who have rendered most valuable assistance. Sir E. Grey has already requested that the United States Consul may render financial assistance to any British or British Indian subjects, and he has reason to hope that it may soon become possible for those British subjects remaining in Turkey who desire to leave to do so. He does not consider it desirable except in cases of an exceptional nature to trouble the United States Ambassador with the transmission of private corres pondence, and I am to suggest that correspondence for Bagdad should be sent by post through a neutral country, such as Italy, in the manner indicated in the enclosed memorandum.

Payments of money to British subjects detained in enemy countries and unable to return to His Majesty's Dominions do not constitute an infringement of he Trading with the Enemy Proclamation, but it may be found necessarv to forward such remittances through a neutral country. It is suggested that persons not having friends or correspondents in neutral countries may find it possible to forward the money through Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son, or some similar agency. Private letters to Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire are now allowed to be forwarded through neutral countries subject to tbe usual conditions of the censorship, but cannot be sent direct. Letters should not be sent through British or foreign Embassies, Legations, or Consu’ates in neutral countries. British subjects and others wishing to communicate with friends in enemy countries must forward their letters through an agency in a neutral country selected by themselves. Such letters must be in open envelopes enclosed in a covering letter, winch must be sent through the usual postal channel to the correspondent or agency in the neutral country by which they are to be forwarded. Senders must make their own arrangements as to obtaining the necessary stamps, &amp;c. Attempts to send such letters out of the United Kingdom by any means other than the post render persons concerned in them liable to prosecution undei the Defence of the Realm Regulations.

They will be subject both to British and enemy censorship, and may be written either in the English language or in that of the country to which they are to be sent.
