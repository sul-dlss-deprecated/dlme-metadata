                           Gazette of Indiaand which has been telegraphed to Pelly in order that he can have it translated into the various local languages and published throughout the Baroda territory.The letter also informs Pelly that once the proclamation has been published he will be responsible for the administration of the Baroda State and will need to take measures to ensure the preservation of peace and order within the state and that any matters which may require the approval of the Government of India should be reported directly to the Secretary's office, particularly any administrative changes that Pelly may feel are necessary, outside of those reforms which were already agreed to in the Baroda Commission Report.The letter also discusses the agreement with the Government of Bombay to strengthen the force at Baroda with European and Native Infantry and a battery of artillery, which it is hoped will be sufficient to handle any disturbances, but that should Pelly feel at any time reinforcements are needed he should request them from the Bombay Government.The letter concludes with reference to a telegram sent to Pelly which outlines the steps to take in order to arrest Mulhar Rao [Malharrao] Guikwar and arrange for his honorable confinement either in one of his palaces or another suitable building. Also outlined are requirements Pelly must adhere to in order to ensure that the Guikwar has every opportunity of appearing before, or sending counsel to the Commission investigating the case, to be able to present witnesses or evidence before it and to have access to anyone he may wish to consult or employ in order to prepare his case. Caution is however advised in ensuring that any witnesses are not tampered with and that the case can be fully and fairly laid before the court.The letter concludes by informing Pelly he will receive details of the constitution and procedures for the Commission shortly and that the Commissioner of Bombay Police will continue to make enquiries and that even if the Guikwar chooses not to avail himself of the opportunities for defending his case the enquiry will still proceed and the Government of India will take any such action that the results of the enquiry justify.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023550602.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
