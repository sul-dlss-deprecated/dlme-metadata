Memorandum As you are aware the Bahrain Government has wished for some years, to explore the possibilities of agri culture on a fairly large scale in Bahrain. Allocations under this heading have been made in previous Budgets and during the time that Col Haworth was Political Resident the question of cotton growing was suggested and discussed. The State has now purchased a well boring machine which is mainly intended for agricultural purposes. Before commencing any work the State wishes to obtain a person who'can advise it on agricultural mat ters such as what ground is most suitable and what crops would do best and when they should be sown, in fact an agricultural expert. In addition to this we should like him to be able to teach classes from the Government school on the actual ground. This individual would be required, I thin£ for six months or a year, and if possible he should be an Arabic speaking person. I should be greatly obliged if you could possibly ascertain from the Ministry of agriculture in Iraq or Syria or Egypt whether they would recommend any candidate for this post. I do not feel that we can afford more than Rs 300/- a month, at the most, as a salary and perhaps an expert could be obtained for less. I imagine that it would be possibly easier to obtain a man from India but then the language difficulty would arise so I think an Arabic speaking man would be pre ferable.
