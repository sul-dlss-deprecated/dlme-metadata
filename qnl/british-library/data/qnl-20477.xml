S ECRB'T . ^ Dear Gibson, With regard to the possible activities of the Japanese Trawler, SHIMKYO MAHU, in the Persian Gulf, 1 write to say that we have recently had this matter under consideration, and would like to make the following suggestions and comments. In the first place, we would again draw attention to the suggestion in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Admiralty letter M.04446/37 of 25rd September that, following the normal practice inside territorial waters, the Japanese should be excluded altogether. The instructions to Sir R. Craigie, . !- :' Foreign Office telegram No.443, imply that, if permission were sought, it might be granted. y In the second place we feel it may be undesirable to supply the Japanese with any chart showing the banks in detail. They are inveterate poachers and will almost certainly take advantage of any information we give them. We would propose simply to mark all the waters outside territorial waters where they would not be allowed to fish and to t ell them that they cannot operate in these areas owing to longstanding exclusive rights of sedentary fishing. U Thirdly, we think that it should be recognised that, if Japanese trawlers do begin fishing in the Gulf, it will be impossible for our sloops there to shadow them effectively without neglectin; other duties. We suggest therefore that consideration might be given to supplementing our efforts by the Arabs themselves - e.g. by coast watchers. ^ Finall y there is the question of the legal powers which His lajesty's Ships would require. In home waters His Majesty's Ships on Fishery Protection duties act under J. P. Gibson, Esc., authority/ India Office, 3. - .1.© V— authoiity coni .err6(i by Act 01 -tcxp^isiiiGn't. - scg SGd J^ish-cries Act 1883, and subseq .U6ri't Giiactinents, Powers oiT Arrest: are conferred ty Section 12, and there is also provision for trial and punishment of offenders. Whilst we do not suggest that sucn coiaplicated legislation would 'be necessary in the Gulf, it would seem, that some sanction is necessary (under municipal as distinct from international law) if action is to betaken against the Japanese. ^ 1 e suggest that you should have this aspect of the matter examined from the legal point of view - for example, would the local Arab rulers have to pass ordinances forbidding fishing to other than Arab vessels in certain areas, and authorising His Majesty's Ships to arrest such non-Arab vessels fishing in these areas and bring them in for trial, or is there any other way in which His Majesty's Ships could be given those powers? The legal position under Municipal Law would, of course, have to bo satisfactorily cleared up before His Majesty's Ships could take action. I am sanding a copy of this letter to Brenan ac the Foreign Office. BKl Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) E. A. Seal k \ \India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I, P.Z.8426/37. , . T 1st January, 1908. © - Dear Seal, Mould you kindly refer to your letter ITo.M. 04446/37 ol the loth November, regarding the possible activities of the Japanese trawler 'Shinkyo Maru' in the Persian Gulf. y As regards your first point I should explain that the insurucLions to Sir Robert Craigie were only intended as a diplomcitic alternative to a definite prohibition. Please see paragraph 4 of my letter to Brenan of the 28th October, l\o . P. zj . 6894/37. Powle was certainly confident, when discussing the matter here in the autumn, that the Shaikhs would not disregard our advice and permit fishing by the Japanese. It is perhaps worth noting here that in the correspondence leading to the reference to the Law Officers in l.-)05 on the subject of the pearling banks it was stated b^ ^oveinment 01 India that 'the principal Chiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property and that no Chief has, therefore, the right to grant any concession to outside parties'. A valid concession could therelore not be obtained by a foreigner from any one • x( -■- I tnej., in the summer of 1911 an assurance was obtained from all the Arab Shaikhs that they would not respond to overtures from any quarter for concessions for fishing on pearl banks over which they possess rights without first consulting the Political Resident. We think in the circumstances you will ag-ree that there is no need to fear any untoward consequence in practice from the formula proposed to be used in a communication to the Japanese Government. Ao x e^ai as oux second point we agree that it might oe undesirable to supply the Japanese with detailed charts B. A.

Gibson.!V P.Z.8426/37. India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I. 1st January, 1938. Dear Brenan, Would you kindly refer to Foreign Office letter No,E,6537/93/34 of the 10th November and connected correspondence about the possible activities of the Japanese trawler 'Shinkyo Maru' in the Persian Gulf. As the scheme to send the trawler to Arabian waters appears to have been abandoned for the time being, no immediate action is required, but we think that it would be as well to consider at this stage y/hat steps are required to protect Arab interests if the need should arise in the future. In this connection we have been looking at the suggestions and commentj- contained in Seal's letter No.M.04446/37 of the 13th November, and in particular the question of the legal powers which His Majesty's ships would require. The question to be decided first is whether His Majesty's Government would approve the use of force by His Majesty's ships to prevent encroachment by foreigners on the cM- Arab pearl fisheries. As regards the recognition oy international law of the rights to be protected difficulty arises only in connexion with the pearling banks outside territorial waters. \y ^ J t\ ' it jp The Law Officers, when the matter was I referred to them in 1905, considered that as a matter of international law the pearl banks are capable of being the property of the Arab tribes to the exclusion of all nations, but they reached the general conclusion that it is not expedient to r aise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. V,'e note from Baggallay's lettrer to ulauson No.E.7681/12/34 of the 8th January 1937, {on the subject of the prospective /isit of a Danish fishing expert to the V. Brenan, Esq., O.B.E., foreign Office, S.VM. Persian/Persian G -u I -t ) that in Bockett 1 s view prescriptive rights may be obtained uO exploit the bed of the ojjen sea for the purposes of pearl fisheries, etc. Is it the present view of the Foreign Office that the existence of Arab rights on the pearling banks outside territorial waters could be successfully upheld, e.g. before an international tribunal, if forcible action by one of His Majesty's ships for the protection of those rights were challenged by a foreign power? No doubt we should, and would, use first all other means short of actual force to keep intruders out, but unless we are prepared to use force in the last resort we need not pursue the question of securing the necessary legal powers for His Majesty's ships, so far as relates to action outside territorial waters? v /hether forcible action by the Navy should in this connexion be limited to territorial waters or should extend to the pearling banks lying outside those limits we are inclined to think that the necessary powers might be provided by inducing all the Arab ftulers concerned to issue a proclamation, or carry out an exchange of letters with the political authorities, to the effect that pearl fishing by other than Arab vessels is forbidden by them, and that His Majesty's Govermient are authorised to take any necessary measures on their behalf to compel the removal of foreign vessels engaged in pearl fishing within their territorial waters (and on the pearling banks outside those limits). Owing to the difficulties raised by the common ownership of all the Arab Shaikhs in the pearling banks and the absence of suitable courts, or of the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction by His Majesty, in all the Shaikhdoms it hardly seems profitable to consider at present the possibility of further measures such as the arrest and trial of offenders? But the matter might be further considered if and when jurisdiction/jurisdiction is exercised by His Majesty on the Trucial Coast under an Order-in-Council. Before considering the matter further and consulting the Political Resident we should be grateful if you would let us have your views, I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal, Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) J. P, Gibson.P. Z. 1008/38 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. E. 48/48/91 11th February, 1938. Dear Gibson, /r ; I write in reply to your letter No.P.Z.8426/37 of the 1st January to Brenan, vho is av/ay on leave, ahout the measures to 'be taken with regard to possible future encroachment 'by foreigners on the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf. 2. This question has now 'been carefully examined in r n frmmti mup ,1 u rro ^ consultation with Beckett, and our general view of the position is as follows. 3. There appear to 'be two questions involved. The first is whether His Majesty's ships can 'be authorised to use force if necessary to prevent encroachment by foreigners on certain pearling banks which lie in the eastern waters of the Persian Gulf at more than three miles from the shore, but to which we consider that the Arab rulers under our protection on the western shore of the Persian Gulf have acquired an exclusive right for their respective nationals. As the use of the Navy to force foreign ships to leave the banks may cause representations to be made by the Powers concerned, the answer to this question depends in part upon whether we consider that we have sufficiently good legal grounds for claiming that the Arab rulers have acquired these rights for their subjects under international law. This point in turn depends upon two propositions:- (a) -he proposition that it is possible to acquire an exclusive right to sedentary fisheries on defined banks beneath the high seas (a question of pure law) (b) the proposition that in fact the Arab rulers have acquired this right. 4:i As ^rega rds^Jja), Beckett has observed that the bulk of * ■ .. ■■ English writers on international law (vide Westlake and Oppenheim)/ J. P. Gibson, Esq.6./ Oppenheim) appear to accept this proposition; the Law Officers of 1905 also did so. If it is considered worth while a more extensive search could be made into all the available books on the subject, including those by foreign writers as well as English writers (particularly the French writer Gidel) and anything that may be available in the proceedings of the League of Nations codification work would have to be taken into account. Beckett considers that the result would probably show the balance of authority to be in favour of the proposition, but that it is impossible to say that the question is free from doubt. 5, As regards (b), the question depends upon our ability to show that, in fact, an exclusive enjoyment of the fisheries by the subjects of the Arab rulers has existed over a long period, and that the rulers have maintained their right, with or without British assistance, whenever it has been challenged. In other words, it would be necessary to show that, although an occasional trespasser may have been let through, trespassers have as a general rule been effectually warned off. The Law Officers in 1905 appeared to feel that they had not been quite sufficiently informed on this aspect of the matter, although on the whole they considered their case to have been adequately proved. We have no further information, but imagine that it could be shown that between 1905 and the present day the position has not worsened in this respect. At the same time, we think that it would be very desirable to obtain more detailed information on this aspect of the matter, and we should be grateful if the India Office could furnish us with the necessary material. Meanwhile, for the sake of the argument which follows, I ill proceed on the assumption that we could shov^ a good cas^ on this aspect of the question also,iV i-fr. 1 1 3. 6. Assuming that the answers to the two propositions defined in paragraph 3 would be found to be as I have described them above, the result of action by His Majesty's ships might be that, while we should have a reasonably good legal case, such action might lead to international representations. It may not however be possible to keep trespassers off by other means, and if trespassers are not effectually kept off the legal right claimed would be weakened. Consequently, we are inclined to think that the right policy would be to allow His Majesty's ships to act forthwith in any case where circumstances demand it, and to leave it to those who object to try to prove their case, if they can, as plaintiffs before an international tribunal. 7. The second P.f Jthe auesti,.g.iis mentioned in paragraph 3 ■&gt; www^i'ritii mnv-viiw^-ntvifri 11 to miy* ■ concerns the provision of the necessary legal powers for such action as may be considered desirable. If His Majesty's ships are to act as proposed above, it will be necessary to invest them with specific authority to do so under some form of municipal law. Beckett considers that this authority must be derived from the rulers of the Arab States, but that, as these rulers do not possess jurisdiction over foreigners, or over all classes of foreigners, their proclamations or legislation should be supplemented by Kingfe Regulations made under the various Orders in Council under which His Majesty's Government exercises ex-territorial jurisidction in the Persian Gulf. The procedure required would seem to be that proclamations or laws should be issued by the Arab rulers, reciting that the fisheries have long been reserved to their nationals, and that other persons have always been forbidden to fish there by law; and then going on to state that in order that there should be no doubt on the point, the prohibition of other persons from exploiting the fisheries is HF now/now declared over again and that poachers or trespassers will be liable to certain penalties, and may be arrested by the authorities of the Arab ruler in question or by the authorities of the protecting Power acting upon the ruler's request. 8. King's Regulations would then be made to which the Arab proclamations would be annexed, making enforceable the Arab rulers' proclamations on British subjects and foreigners, and authorising His Majesty's ships to take action against poachers and trespassers. In the case, however, of a ruler like the Sheikh of Bahrein, who has no jurisdiction over any except his own nationals, it may be questioned whether there is any necessity for any legislation at all, and whether a King's Regulation is not all that is required, since the only people affected by the proposed legislation would be persons who are not subject to the Sheikh's jurisdiction. In this case, a simple request from the Sheikh to His Majesty's Government to legislate and to take action against the trespassers may perhaps be all that is required. 9. As regards the precise form of action to be taken by His Majesty's ships, Beckett observes that, while poachers -tirr-TTimmrir and trespassers who enter the territories or territorial waters of the Arab states after their poaching activities could properly be arrested and prosecuted, it is rather doubtful whether His Majesty's ships could legally bring them into territorial waters by force. In the case of poachers and trespassers who are not British subjects or British protected persons, therefore, it appears that action by His Majesty's ships should be confined to driving them away, since, even admitting the soundness of the case for the appropriation of the fisheries on the bed of the sea, there would still be a technical legal difficulty as regards arresting such persons, since/(S&gt; 5. since they would presumably 'be caught at the surface of the sea, which cannot be appropriated and which must be admitted to be outside the jurisdiction of any State. 10. While I do not think we should see any objection to the enactment of the necessary municipal legislation and the issue of the appropriate instructions to His Majesty's ships, on the assumption that these measures are necessary to protect the pearl fisheries (and assuming that the answers to propositions (a) and (b) can be confirmed), I think the point ought to be considered whether the threat to the fisheries from Japanese or other quarters is really serious, for clearly these measures will draw a lot of publicity to a question upon which little light beats at present.

At first sight the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Welghtrnan's letter of the 23rd April appears to have a good deal to recornnenc it. If all the pearling banks are, as Weightman presupposes, owned in common by the Sheikhs, or if at least one Sheikh, such as the Sheikh of Bahrein, has an interest in all the banks, it might be sufficient to have that Sheikh's authority to drive away intruders, which is of more practical consequence than being able to arrest and punish them in the unlikely event of their subsequently entering an Arab Sheikh's territory or territorial waters* 3.

The Secretary to tiie Groverniasfit of India in the external Affairs Department, Tne Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London. Dated Simla, the ^ ( ~ July 1930. Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the demi-official letter from the India Office, No. i J .Z.4j06/38 dated tne 5th July 1938 regarding tne protection of the Arab pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf from en croachments by foreigners and to communicate [herewith the observations of the G-overnment of India. 2. The Arab pearl fishing bads may be divided into three classes;- (1) Those situated within territorial waters, i.e., up to a three miles limit. (^) Those immediately outside this limit,and (^) Deep-sea pearl fishing beds. As regards (1) there is apparently no doubt that these banks cLn be legally protected. In raspact of (2) the possi bility of establishing proprietary rights appears to be doubtful, but it m^y, for the sake of argument, be assumed tnat sucn proprietary rights could be established in an International Court, provided it could be proved that the persons, in this case tne Sheikhs of tne Trucial Coast, who claim the rights, have exorcised prescriptive rights for a number of years. In the case of (3) above, these banks have never been exploited by the Srucial Sheikhs or Bahrain and tiiere...........•./y v gii ~ ~ there would apparently be no possibility of claiming or proving proprietary rights- 3. If the Japanese attempt to exploit the Arab pearl fisheries, it seems probable that they would concentrate on class (3) viz- the deep-sea pearl fishing beds, since they would be provided with all modern equipment and appliances, and in this case no valid legal objection could apparently be raised- The practical point, therefore, seems to be whether it is worth while deawing attention to British claims in the Persian Gulf by publishing even on^Proclamation or King's Hegulation in oraer to protect tae banks which are outside the Sheikhs* territorial waters- It is admitted that a legal claim to exclusive rights even in these banks might be disputed and a study of Lorimer 's Gazetteer, Volume I Part II C^ppendix-G, page 2220) and also of the subsequent S nigtory of the case as ^iven in paragraph 4 of the Political Hesiden t t 3 letter ^t T o .feo-S, dated the 16th May 1938, Bhowa tiiat all attempts at encroachment by foreigners and by British subjects have hitherto been resisted without the aid of a King f s Regulation or a Procl a/oat ion- It may be that the present action v/ould be aimed mainly at tue Japanese, who might well be more persistent in their attempts than previous would-be trespassers. But the issue of a Proclamation might cause offence to the Iranian Government and might even induce! them to attempt themselves to dispute the exclusive rights of the .Sheikhs, whom they affect to regard as Iranian sub jects. Should a position arise in w/iicn Persian trawlers attempted to exploit tne Sheikhs' pearl banks under the obviously be protection of Persian sloops, it would iaLdifficult for British sloops to drive them away, even if a King's Regula tion authorised by the Sheikhs was in existence. The Govern ment of India are therefore of the opinion that it would be worth 1- 3 - worth taking a considerable risk in order to aroid the possibility of such a situation arising and so long as the danger of Japanese encroachment remains remote, they would aaprecate any action being taken on the lines proposed by the Political Resident in paragraph 3 of his letler ifo. 250-S, dated the i6th May 1938. 4« The Lrovernment of India realise however that were a question oi encroachment of the (deep-sea banks by Japanese or otner trawlers to arise and were His Majesty's Government to take no action to defend the claims of the Sheikhs the effect locally on British prestige would be most unfortunate. Tney therefore suggest that a King's Regulation should be iiapL in readiness for issue should sudden developments demand it. 5. The G-overnment of India agree with the Political Resident's view that Mr. We ightman * a suggestion is workable and consider that the procedure outlined should be adapted if and wnen occasion arises to issue a KingV Regulation.

My dear Gibson, Many thanks for your letter P,Z.5432/36 of the 26th September last about the question of protectin. the Arab pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf against encroachments by foreigners. y * 2, We were very interested in the tfew information contained in the Government of India's letter about the presence of pearl fishing beds in deep water in the Persian Gulf which have never been exploited by the Arab Sheikhs. We did not realise that such beds existed and I think it is clear, although I have not verified this point, that no question of claiming them has ever arisen before. Lorimer's Gazetteer merely states (Volume 1, Part II, page 2,221, paragraph 5) that it is possible that such deep sea pearl banks GX ist, and I imagine that even now very few people share this knowledge. Assuming that they do exist, however, we agree with the Government of India that the Arab Sheikhs would have no legal claim to them, and, this being so, we do not think that it would be possible, whatever the circumstances, to issue a warning-off notice in respect of these beds or take forcible action to prevent anyone from fishing there, however damaging to British presti, e in the Gulf such inaction might be. Since, however, the Arab Sheikhdoms have never exploited these banks, there seems no reason why they should be aggrieved if foreigners do so, or why the prestige of His Majesty's Government should fall if they allowed it, even though the Sheikhs might say that they would have used the banks if and when they had known of their existence and possessed the necessary equipment. 3./ J.P. Gibson Esq.q O 2. 3. As regards the pearling 'banks lying (1; v/iG.hin territorial waters and (2) in shallow waters outside this limit (I note in this connexion that Lorirner says they occur anything up to 70 miles from the coast) s we agree that in view of the considerations mentioned in the Government of India's letter it might he undesirable to risk representations from the Iranian Government 'by issuing a proclamation now, hut that there would 'be no harm in having a Proclamation and King 5 s Regulation in readiness for use in case any attempt should he made on these Danks* In view? however, of the distinction 'between these hanks and those lying in deep water, the King's Regulation would have to he carefully worded so as to avoid making it apparent that this distinction existed e.g. it might refer to the 'fisheries which have long 'been reserved to Bahreini nationals 1 ' or words to that effect. This would have the advantage of not committing His Majesty's Government either way as regards the deep sea hanks and at the same time of discouraging would-he poachers, who would prohahly he unaware of the distinction between these hanks and the others. If, however, His Majesty's Ships were then authorized to take forcible action, they would, I think, have to he instructed only to do so in the case of those hanks to which the Arab Sheikhs have a reasonable claim. 4. There is one further point which we think merits investigation. On page 2240 of Loriner it is stated that 'On the Arabian side all the banks, whether 'near or far from the coast, are free to the pearl -fishers of Arabia and Persia without distinction 'of race or nationality'. If this statement is accurate it may be difficult to exclude Persians/L Persians from the iDanks on the 'basis of prescription. Moreover it is hardly consistent with the information on the subject apparently given to the Law Officers on which they 'based their opinion of 11th February, 1905 (see page 2248 of Lorimer). It seems from the information in Lorimer that the Persians have continued to keep the banks on the Persian side for themselves ? but have habitually fished on the Arabian Yours ever, Sd. Lacy Baggallay© &lt;s India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I, P^.7041/38 0ctooeI ^ 1938 Dear Jones, V/ould you please refer to my letter to Jarrett of the 26th Septernber, ITo.P.Z.5432/38, regarding the protection of the Arab pearl fisheries in* the -Persian Gulf from encroachments 'by foreigners. Before replying thereto the Admiralty may wish to see the enclosed copy of Baggallay's reply to the similar letter Dated 13th Octobers) &gt; which I sent to him. SjM' 2. As regards the deep water 'beds referred to in paragraph 2 of his letter, the Government of India's letter of the 27th July ? while assuming their existence, gives no definite information about them. Lorimer (p.2244) mentions the view of some authorities that ,: the effect of deep-sea dredging would be to destroy the colonies from which the oysters upon the shallow beds accessible to native divers are recruited''. If this view is correct the Arabs might have a very good reason for feeling aggrieved if the deep water beds were exploited by foreigners. But it is difj icult to see what effective action can be taken if the Arabs have no valid claim to rights over those beds. The •f*'' 11111'iwi ■ ii naifiin i i'-Tn-r-ir^nfftiMwiwu. .. ,, ^ m r problem/ P.H. Jones Esq., Admiralty, S.W.I.J ®&gt; 2, /—^ problem was in fact dealt with in the reference made to the Law Officers in 1904. In their opinion taey drew a distinction 'between the pearling hanks resorted to hy the Arahs outside territorial waters and the deeper waters i--- - I- It- I - 1 -i t--'*' .axvuia* i l v/hich had not yet been fished hy pearl divers. They reported that they could not see that 11 the right claimed hy the trihes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could 'be asserted with any reasonable chance of success' 1 . In respect 'both of the deeper waters and of the pearl 'banks outside the three-mile limit they recommended that foreign interference should be discouraged by the refusal of supplies etc., as had been suggested by the Government of India. —^ /v 9^ . 3. As regards paragraph 4 of Baggallay's letter it is an unwelcome complication that the Arab Sheikhs may not after all possess an exclusive prescriptive right to the pearling banks outside territorial waters. Possibly the prohibition on poachers to be enforced by a King's Regulation could, if necessary, be framed so as not to apply to Persians; e.g. it might extend only to persons who are not nationals of countries bordering on the Persian Gulf (though this would let/v (g) 3. let in Iraqis and Saudis). ^he Persian Government could not then complain that the right of their nationals were affected. They might ? however, object to our assuming, without their consent, the role of protector of rights shared 'by their nationals with our proteges. The question how far Persians share with Arabs prescriptive rights in the pearling hanks on the Arab side of the Gulf is one on which we shall have to consult the Political Resident. 4. I might also mention a minor point of drafting that occurs to me in connexion with Baggallay's letter. It would hardly 'be correct to speak of the fisheries long reserved to Bahreini nationals when the 'banks are the common property of all the tribes. Perhaps something like fisheries which have long been operated by Bahreini nationals :i would do. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay. Yours sincerely.

C0!NFIDEITTI AL. Military Branch, M.05695/38. Admiralty, S.W.I. M 5th. November, 1938. Ill pJ v Dear Gib&amp;on, Will you^please refer to your letters P.Z.5432/38 of the 26th September and the 2 6th October on the subject of the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf ? Apart from the question of the interests of the Persians in the Arab fisheries, referred to below, there appears to us to be no difficulty in maintaining the view - (i) that the Arab States have exclusive rights to the fisheries in their territorial waters. (ii) that they have established exclusive proprietary rights to fisheries outside territorial waters which it can be shown they have been accustomed to fish. (iii) that K.M.Government is entitled, in view of its special position in the Gulf, to exclude aliens, on behalf of any or all of the Sheikhs, from, the above grounds. The difficulty therefore arises over (a) shallow beds outside territorial waters which the Arabs have not in fact worked. (b) deep beds outside territorial waters, which the Arabs could not in fact fish without mechanical equipment. As regards (a), the Admiralty view is that we can safely take the line that, without the necessity for clear evidence that any particular bed has been worked, the shallow beets as a whole are subject to the exclusive right of the Arab Spates. It would indeed probably be impracticable to collect evidence that a particular bed nas or has not been worked, and it would therefore De unsaie 9 to/ J.P.Gibson, Esq., India Office, S.W. 1.to adopt any procedure requiring the production of such evidence. ihe real difficulty therefore arises over the beds at (b) , i.e. .hose too deep for working by human agency alone, which the Arabs therefore could not have fished. As regards these beds we are unable to agree with the view in Baggallay's letter that they are not of sufficient interest to the Sheikhs to warrant protection iram intruders. It seems clear that - (i) Local belief is that spoliation of the deeper beds would injure the shallow beds; (ii) i^n^ intrusion into the Gulf of expeditions equipped with modern apparatus would be strongly resented by the Arabs who would consider we had failed to protect them; (iii) It is most unlikely that the Japanese intruder would confine himself strictly to the deep beds. We consider, therefore, that every effort should be made to protect the deep beds. Whether they can in fact be protected is a different matter, but for the present we would suggest that the most hopeful line seems to be to base our claim on the belief mentioned in Lorimer's Gazetteer that deep sea dredging would destroy the colonies from which the shallow beds are recruited. Ic would therefore seem to us very valuable if some scientific evidence could be obtained in support of this belief and perhaps the India Office could undertake to secure some plausible evidence in favour of such a contention. ohould the need for action arise before we have managed to establish a more or less legal claim, it will probably be necessary to adopt, so far as possible, a policy/3. policy of bluff. Tliere should Toe no difficulty, as in the past, in adopting such a policy against non-Japanese intruders: whether or not it could be successfully adopted against the Japanese will no doubt have to be considered at the time when the need arises. We presume, of course, that use would be made of such measures as withdrawing protection and refusing supplies, although this would probably not affect a self-contained Japanese unit. There is admittedly the further difficulty in that the location of the deep beds, - and indeed the existence of any deep beds, - does not seem to be known, but this appears inevitable so long as fishing in the Gulf is restricted to unaided human divers. Possibly, however, there may be some local knowledge based on the explorations of seme particularly adventurous^ or skilful divers available in the Gulf which is not known in London. Perhaps therefore you could ask the local authorities to report al 1 'u hat they know. It seems also that we should obtain some up to date information as to the exact interest of the Persians in the fisheries not in their own territorial waters, as our information at present seems to be based largely on the statement in Loriirer'n Gazetteer published in 1915. It seems, however ; that there is no great danger of arousing Persian opposition under the procedure suggested in the Government of India.'s letter of the 27th April , ,! 1938, since under this procedure the King* s Regulation will not actually be published until the need arises for excluding an alien (and then with the minimum puolicity). Moreover/4. Moreover, the interests of the Persians would 'be the same as ours, namely, to keep out the alien and it is unlikely that they will feel moved to raise difficulties if they see we are taking the odium for action which is equally in their own interests. 'Tai 1 e we do not, therefore, consider that Persian interest would 'be a bar to any action necessary to exclude intruders, it does seem desirable for the matter to Toe cleared up and perhaps you will ask your local advisers t o report. ^ith reference to paragraph 4 of your letter, we ould have no objection to your revised wording, unless you would perhaps prefer 'fisheries in which Bahreini nationals have established proprietary rights'. As regards any action to be taken at the present we are entirely in agreement with the course suggested in the Government of India's letter of the 27th April, 1938. ^ ^ ^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay.

As regards the oyster 'beds in deep waters, I cannot see tha t we hav e a legal case for keeping anybody away from bhem, jiiVen it it were the case that we could establish that so-a dredging on the deep sea beds would totally destroy the utility of the 'beds in shallow water which can 'be and have 'been appropriated, that would not give any legal claim to keep other people off the deep sea beds. The point is just the same as that in the 'big seal fisheries arbitration, //here uhe United States tried to contend that because the unrestricted catching of seals outside U.S. jurisdiction destroyed the seal fishery within U.S. jurisdiction therefore they must have some right to take action outside their territorial limits in order to protect their fisheries inside trieir territorial limits, but the U.S. Grovernmgnt failed. The argument is much the same as that which Norway makes when she tries to exclude British' trawlers from banks outside Norwegian territorial waters as we measure them, and of course any number of claims to exercise jurisdiction on the nigh seas could be based on this ground. As regards the other point, the first thing is clearly to ascertain whether it is in fact true that Persians have resorted to and are resorting to the pearl banks in shallow water. If they are, then Persia shares the prescriptive right to these banks in shallow water outside the three mile limit, but I do not think it shows that there can be no prescriptive right at all. It would become a prescriptive right enjoyed by the natives of countries bordering on the Persian Gulf. The difficulty, however, would be that in theory/n is 2. /r\ Persia' would T dc entitled to share in the action to keep other people off and might contend that she should he- consulted and agree in what action should 'be taken. However, as long as Persians were not excluded I do not 'think Persia would have a very serious complaint, legal or otherv/ise, if the Arah rulers issued laws formally excluding non-Persian Gulf natives from the 'banks and entrusting our navy with the duty of policing the 'banks and our navy acted accordingly.

Cortf idential * / xV I am directed by tho TrueteeB of the British Museum to refer to Mr «Peel s letter 1 , p#^»211 /• » ol the l .th April on the subject of pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf. The Trustees directed ine to state or the information oi Lord Zetland thai- the question© raised in the letter unrier reply have been considered by the appropriate monbers of the scientific staff in this Museum and that the liter ture on the subject has been consulted. The Trustees are advised that research on tiie pearl fi sherial of Ceylon have demo istrated that - (1) the pearl ban^s all lie at depths between 5 and 12 fathoms; (2) the ^earl oyster begins to reproduce at the age of 12 months and produces large numbers of veligers tv/ice a year; between the (3) pearls are usually produced by oyster; ages of 2-2 and 4 years; (4) owing to the set of the currents the fry is fre mently carried av/ay from the oyster ban^.s and perishes with the result that only occasionally are there yeors when the banks are worth Tishing; (5) the authorities are of opinion that pearl fishinc is Ilikely to result only to a negligible extent in diminishing the fishery in the future. The chief enemies of the pearl oysters are not the pearl fishers, but rays and other fishes and molluscs. It would appear that in the case of the Persian Gulf the conditions under heading (4) differ from those in Ceylon, but those indicated under the other headings are likely to be similar in both cases. Since the oysterr begin to reproduce at least a year before they are fit to fish, the fishing is unlikely to affect the maintenance of the stock unless it is conducted on such lines as to destroy the mature oysters which have not yet begun to produce pearls. There is no reason to suppose that a deep—sea pe^rl isherycould profitably be' established, but the opinion of those who have been consult^ is that if suoh .51 J^lrliery were eetebliehed it would be cc -ciely lively to affect t^e oyster population JUT tTTensl llo cr beds. &gt;1 ^ The Trustees directed me to tr-ns^it the foregoing comments with the reservation that they emanate from men whose knowledge is not derived from actual experience of pearl fishing. The Trustees suggest that if Lord Zetland sees no objection it might be well to consult Dr.Cyril CroselaAd the former Director of the EgyptTan Z60I6! ical Service who is an expert on such matters ?/ith first-hand experience of pearl fishing/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office, Whitehall,(3&gt; |V&gt; Goafidential P.Z.4426/39 Kirkevej 21 Cli ar 1 o 110 nlund ^ Daruriark. 15th July, 1939. To The Under Secretary ox State for India. I msy say that vjhen Director of the Sudan Government Pearl Fishery/- I obtained what information was then available on the Persian Gulf Pe?rl Fisheries. It v^as not much, as evidently they,had never been examined by a biologist, and nothing was known about them from the fisherman'v3 point of view. There has recently been a Danish Scientific Fisheries Expedition to the Gulf. I gather that its work was principally on the Iranian side, the headquarters of the pearling boats and tredo being at Bahrein, on the western side. Would you like me to encuire whether they saw anything of the Petri Fishery? Iviemwhile the following information may be useful.- (1) There are two pearl oysters which are fished in the Gulf, for the small oyster, Pinctada vulgaris (the nome has been changed ^ein , but vulgaris is the name in any literature which matters) Arabic Bilbil, and the large oyster, P. marr-.aritifer a, Arabic 1 sadaf known to the trade as 'Bombay Shell'. (2) The habits of these two species are very different, as I found during ny work in the iled Ser, where both occur. (3) The Ceylon Fishery is for the small oyster, or Bilbil, and is for the Pearls alone, the s. ell be in.- practically valueless. Therefore there can be no ;rcctical fishery unless the oyster occurs in vast numbers. I. the case of the large shell, or sadaf, the shell is Lie . lain object, Sir, In rep I;/ to your letter P. Z. 4225/39 of 12.7.39OP pearls adding something like 10^ to 20^ to their vs I ug. (4) In the Red See Bilhil is occasionally talc en, but the fishery is almost entirely for sadaf. The methods used differ completely from those of Ceylon, the only fishery which has 'been reported upon 'by a biologist. (5) I do not IcnoY? hov? fishing is done in the Iranian Gulf. It is quite possible that the same 'boat may trice both species. (6) From my experiences with diving dresses in t^c rlod Sea I decided that, unless shell is very thiol: on the bottom, as on my artificial beds, naked diving was _ cheaper, Europeans often seem to have the fixed ioea that modern machinery is sure to be the more eificienc, and the fact that I did not find it so in the Red Sea (except in the very special circumstances of my artificial beo.o) might save trouble in dealing with the reque sts referr ed to in your letter 2118/39 to the Director ox the i^aturrl History Museum. (7) The seme letter refers to fishing on 'shoals at s. depth of not more than 20 fathoms'. Kone of my divers could descend to greater depths than 10 fathoms &gt; and then it was a haphazard performance only indulged in by negroes. I do not think any naked diver can go deeper than this, and 20 fms is deep even for a man in a diving suit. (8) As regards the Natural History Museum's letter. Bar. 1 refers only to Ceylon. In the Bed Sea ooth species occur from low spring tide level uO 10 labLoms, anu- probably deeper, if the bottom below that depth is not all mud. Ear. 2 Reproduction begins, in both species in the summer after that in which the young were liberatea. In Sadaf the floating young are produced at intervals from June to September. They thus reproduce several years before they are fishable. j ? ar. 3.fUH Par.o. The better gro^n the g.;c11 the better the pep.rl, and, oX coijirGe, the old shells ar^, in general&gt; the only ones lilcely to contain pearls o:C any size.

Sliallov.' and accessible beds can easily be overfished, (i'hose in Ceylon are neither shallow nor accessible). I believe that the natural population of the shallows of Dong on ab Bay was replenished by the spat froia ohe deeper water, without which they would have been permanently denuded. Apart from this the shells from deeper water were of little value, being stunted and heavily parasitised. I made calculations which showed that tlie impositio of a very moderate size limit in th^ Hed See would increase the value of the native fishery by about 30 r . The Arabs and Bisharin were taking the smallest shells seen, the vr.lue of which was almost nothing, and they probably do the Sc. e in the Iranian Gulf. Owing to the number of Governments concerned it was impossible to impose even this simple regulation. It may interest you to know that I have written a full account of my 17 years' work as Director of the Sudan Govern lent Pearl Fishery, in which I describe the discovery and application of methods of cultivation of the large pearl, shell, for which I hope to find a publisher, as these discoveries, if published, are certain to be found useful sometime in the future, in some part ofJi Mi the jEJuipiro.

I 2. With reference to paragraph 2 of the above quoted letter it will have been seen, from the correspondence with the Natural History Museum and Dr.Crossland of which copies were circulated last July, that scientific opinion does not appear to confirm the belief that the shallower pearling 'banks are recruited from deep sea nurseries and would therefore suffer if the latter were fished by the aid of modern apparatus. Thus, if pearl oyster beds do in fact exist in the deeper waters of the Persian Gulf, it would appear to be the case that there are not only no legal grounds on which foreigners could be prevented from fishing in them but there is also no indisputable justification for attempting to prevent such fishing for the protection of Arab interests in the shallow banks. 3. It is noted from paragraph 1 of the above-quoted express letter that the extent of Persian interest in the pearling banks resorted to by the Arabs is small. There is therefore no need to consult with the ifersian Government in any action taken for the protection of Arab interests, it will however be necessary, whether by specific provision in the drafting' of the relevant King's Regulation or by reference in the |&gt; '^t instructions v/hich may, if the need arises, be issued to His Majesty's ships, to ensure that Persian lishermen are not interfered with in any steps that are taken to expel foreigners from the Arab pearl 'banks. The whole position would of course require to 'be reviewed if Arab interests were to suffer as the result of a substantial increase in the numbers of Persian boats operating on the Arab banks# 4. Vith regard to the action to be taken for the protection of Arab interests in the shallow banks lying outside territorial waters, the conclusions reached in the previous correspondence on this subject indicated the desiraoilioy of having in readiness a draft King's Regulation under the Bahrein Order in Council, for which the authority of a written request from the Sheikh of Bahrein woul(^R)0 made available, and which would not be issued until the need should arise and would then be given the minimum publicity. This Regulation would provide the legal basis for the issue of instructions to His Majesty^ ships. It seems desirable that an approved draft King's Regulation should be available, even though the occasion for resorting to it may be remote. Please therefore prepare a draft in the light of the earlier correspondence and submit it through the Government of In^ia.

At the front of the file are a number of fold-out maps (folios, 3, 5, 11 and 13) showing the locations of pearling banks in the Gulf. A blueprint map dated 18 March 1939 (folio 11) shows the position of pearl banks on the Trucial Coast. Each of the pearl banks on the map is marked with a number. The map also has a key which lists the names of the 110 numbered pearl banks in transliterated English. There is also a map showing pearling banks off the coasts of Bahrain and Dubai (folio 13). The names of topographic features (human settlements, islands, pearl banks) are marked in Arabic. The depth of the waters in fathoms are also shown using Arabic numerals.The first item of correspondence in the file is a letter (folios 15-16) from E. A. Seal of The Admiralty, to J. P. Gibson of the India Office, dated 13 November 1937, and relates to the possible activities of Japanese trawlers in the Gulf. Extensive correspondence follows between representatives from the Foreign Office, India Office and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle) over the economic and political implications of granting foreign vessels rights to fish the pearl banks. A series of letters from the Political Agencies at Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat to the Political Residency give details of the pearling banks off the coast of Kuwait (folios 56-57, 59-60), Bahrain (folios 62-63), the Trucial Coast (folios 64-67, whose 110 pearling banks correspond to the map on folio 11), and Muscat (folio 58).The discussion focuses towards the end of the file over British powers to permit or deny foreign vessels the right to fish the deeper pearl banks, which are beyond the reach of the traditional methods used by Arab divers. Letters from the Secretary at the British Museum and Cyril Crossland, former Director of the Egyptian Zoological Service (an expert on the Red Sea pearl fisheries), advise on the potential impacts of deep-water oyster fishing on the shallower oyster beds fished by Arab divers (folios 72-73, 74-77).Folio 5A is an explanatory note written by Penelope Tuson, dated 21 November 1994, explaining that the maps at folios 5 and 7 are missing, and that the originals have been replaced with photographic copies taken from microfilm, until the originals have been found. There is, however, a map at folio 5, suggesting that one map was found and replaced after Tuson's note was written. Maps at folio 7 and folio 9 are missing.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Trucial States</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00024d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
