My dear Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, I mentioned to you on June 23 the desire of Sir H.V.Biscoe to obtain some extension of the facilities for the access to Hejdi ports of the Indian traders known as Bunniahs. My action on his request has been delayed by our recent preoccupations and I should now be glad to return an early reply to it. Your Excellency will remember that in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your personal letter to Col.Biscoe of R&amp;madhan 20 (January 28) in which you recorded the conversations at Hofuf, you referred to an understanding that the Bunniahs should be allowed to enter $atif for a period not exceeding two months on each occasion and that, if either party should wish for a modification of this, he should notify the other with a view to a mutual agreement being reached. On his return to Bushire, Col.Biscoe ascertained tha,t the value of this concession would be greatly increased if (a) permission could be given to the Bunniahs to visit Jubail as well as Q,atif and (b) they could be allowed to / / prolong their stay at either place to a maximum of three instead of two months. He asks me to obtain from the Heja$i Government a confirmation of the arrangement made at Hofuf, subject to these two modifications. I His Excellency, Shaikh Yasuf Yasin/-v 'I (!) I would ask you to submit Sir H. V. Biscoe’s request to the favourable consideration of His Majesty the Kxng and to inform me of His decision, which will doubtless be communicated to the local authorities also.

Bear Sir Andrew, p With reference to your note No. 1864/54/29 of 23rd Safar 1351 (28th June) concerning the admittance of Indian merchants known as Banians, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that we have no objection to the people in question entering t^atif for three months, but I regret to inform you that owing to various reasons it is not possible to allow them to enter Jubail.
