To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 8th October 19U. My Lord Marquess, W T e have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship’s telegram of the 4th February 1913, sanctionino* the deputation of a geologist to examine the question of the water-supply at Kuwait. 1 J 2. Mr. E. H. Pascoe, of the Geological Survey of India was deputed to * Enclosure No. i. inspect geological conditions in Kuwait, and in his report, a copy* of which is enclosed, he recommended that trial borings should be made, but, owing to the uncertainty of obtaining potable water and to the very large cost involved, we decided not to make experiments in this direction. The alternative course of installing a condensing plant at Kuwait appeared to us to have the advantage of certain success and we accordingly asked our Political Resident in the Persian Gull to obtain from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company an estimate for such plant producing 100,000 gallons per 24 hours, together with estimates of other initial and recurring expenditure. 3. These have now been received and we have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship’s information, a copy of the correspondence detailed in the schedule attached. The initial cost of the installation is estimated at £12,500 or Rs. 1,87,500 and the working expenses at Rs. 80,000 a year, but the latter amount will be slightly increased if a European Engineer is employed. We consider this desirable on the grounds of efficiency and for reasons given in our Political Resident’s letter No. Cf. 59, dated the 26th July 1914. 4. The machinery to be employed is designed by specialists in this class of plant and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who are a British firm of reputation and who, owing to their proximity to Kuwait and their knowledge of local conditions are evidently in the best position to undertake the work, can, we consider, be safely entrusted with the contract for which they have tendered. The Shaikh’s interests will be adequately secured if the firm agrees to the further condition that the plant should be handed over to the Shaikh in full working order and yielding the estimated supply of water, after it had been worked by them for at least 3 months after the installation. As the Shaikh has no funds available, we propose to grant him a loan of £12,500 without interest for the purpose of financing the scheme, and would solicit Your Lordship’s sanction thereto.5. The question of the water-supply at Kuwait is an urgent and pressing necessity, and we consider it moreover of political importance to oblige the Shaikh in this matter. The revenue to the Shaikh from the sale of water is expected to leave him a sufficient margin, after paying working expenses, to enable him to repay the loan by regular monthly instalments of at least Us. 6,000. Loans previously granted to the Shaikh have always been recovered without difficulty and he has just remitted to us the first instalment due on account of the lean made to him this year with Your Lordship’s sanction conveyed in your telegram of the 2nd January 1914. We have the further security in the sum of £4,000 paid annually to the Shaikh on account of the rent of the Bandar Shuwaikh foreshore. We would, however, recommend that, as in the case of the recent loan referred to above, His Majesty’s Treasury will bear half the loss, if any, on the transaction and also half the loss of interest on this loan. 6. As the matter is urgent, we would request that Your Lordship’s sanc tion may be communicated to us by telegraph. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HAKDINGE of PENSHUKST. BEAUCHAMP DUPE. H. W. CABLYLE. HABCOURT BUTLEB. S. A. IMAM. r ‘R &amp; - B.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 1379 dated the 17th February 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. E. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, on the prospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf.CONFIDENTIAL- Prospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf, I arrived on the 20th February, 1913, and spent a fortnight in and around ^ A Koweit, endeavouring to form an opi- Date and locality. ^ ag t() the and ^ ^ ^ country-rock below the sand, and the likelihood of its capability of retaining water fit for drinking purposes. ‘ Koweit lies on the coast of the Arabian Desert, in a small arm of the Persian Gulf at its north-western extremity. The desert stretches inland for at least 200 miles, without a hill-range and probably without an exposure of rock. There are no exposures at Koweit, and „ , __ the only hard rock found is the ‘ ‘ Litoral Bocks at Koweit. Rag ., or Concrete &gt; &gt; mentioned by Dr Pilgrim as common in the Gulf. Below the surface, at various inconstant hori zons, pebbles and sand are occasionally cemented together into calcareous or gypseous bands sufficiently coherent to influence the under ground flow of surface water. Around Koweit an efflorescent salt, similar to that found in Burma near exposures of Pegu beds and to the “ Reh ” of India, is common on the surface, especially in damp places. A foot or so below the surface a band of gypsi ferous sand, some 9 inches to Ij feet thick, is very commonly found, the gypsum is derived from subjacent Tertiary beds. With the aid of surface fires this material is partially dehydrated, and the product known as “jus ”, containing a certain amount of “ plaster of Paris ” and perhaps a little lime, is used as a cement for building purposes. This small industry covers quite a large area. Most of the water obtained from surface wells (from 10 to 20 feet deep) is slightly brackish. By the kindness of Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, I was able to visit for a couple of days a low hill known as Wara and some small knolls, and rising ground, known as Burqan, 24 miles south of Koweit. These, fortunate ly, are of Tertiary rock, though of very Wara and Burqan. limited extent only. Wara is a small truncated cone, some 20 to 25 yards across its flat top, and projecting 50 or 60 feet above the desert plain. It is capped by a conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone about 4—5 feet thick ; the pebbles of the conglomerate are small and consist mostly of quartz. It lies practically horizontally, dipping in one place at g io° towards north-west. A glimpse of the underlying beds is obtained on one side of the hill; they appear to be identical with those seen at Burqan. The conglomerate has every appearance of a Bakhtiari bed, and for reasons to follow it probably represents the base of this series. Burqan consists of a series of low ridge-like knolls grouped along or parallel to the perimeter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Conglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at the edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sand stone, and many large fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Flakes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills and the efflorescent salt in the central plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface, of Dr. Pilgrim’s Fars series. I am inchned to think the Fars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone represen ting the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Fars exposure would be about a mile long by | mile broad. Between Koweit and Wara the desert is pebbly all the way, except in a few bare grass-less patches covered with efflorescent salt. Small shrubs also increase in number towards Wara and Burqan, Between Koweit and Wara. where they are quite plentiful; this may be a result of the rise of the more or less impervious Bakhtiari conglomerate to wards the surface.Kubbar and Q^arain Islands were disappqjiting. The latter is about 4 miles west of Koweit, and contains no rock except the recent litoral ragstone. The same stone Wi.s found all round the beach of Kubbar and Qarain Islands. Kubbar, which is 35 miles SOUth-east of Koweit. Four and-a-half miles east-south-east of this island, a smooth patch of fresh water was observed in the sea and reported by the Commander of H. M. S. “Lapwing”. A copy of this report, kindly supplied by Captain Shakespear, is appended. The geo-tectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between N.-S. and N.-W. — S.-E. This is borne out by (i) the orientation of the Burqan dome and the relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of north from Burqan), (it) by the general Structure. strike and trend of the Persian Gulf and Euphrates and Tigris valleys, (J^) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a cir cumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf, which shows a very gentle eastwards shelving along the Arabian side, but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. From this we may deduce that easterly dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. This fact and general consi derations are conformable to the view that the subjacent Tertiary strata in and around Koweit have been very little disturbed by folding movements. After these preliminaries it is possible to consider the question of finding water at Koweit by artesian boring. The Tertiary rocks beneath the thick superficial cap Water of Recent sand consist in all probability of Dr. Pilgrim’s “ Fars ” series and perhaps some of the basal beds of the overlying Bakktiaris. We have evidence for this in the superficial gypsiferous band at Koweit, the nature of the Burqan and Wara beds, the brackishness of many of the Koweit and neighbouring wells, and to some extent the intermediate position of Koweit between an Upper Tertiary outcrop mapped by Dr. Pilgrim some 30 miles west of Basrah and the Nummulitic rocks of Bahrein*. As to the depth at which Tertiary rocks occur below the surface at Koweit, we may at least hope that the Burqan and Wara exposures denote a line of uplift whose strike would pass through Koweit and the Basrah out crop, and that although the westerly indent in the coast forming Koweit Bay may denote a local depression of the Tertiary rocks, these rocks are not beyond the reach of the drill. The Fars series is a porous one, and if it can be reached, water ought to be found at some horizon or other, although it is not, I believe, been plentifully met with in the oil borings near Ahwaz. The most serious consideration, however, is whether any of it would be fresh enough for drinking purposes. A great part of Arabia and Persia are more or less permeated with rock-salt, gypsum and “ reh”; in fact, the water of the ^PP^r part of the Persian Gulf is said to be actually salter than that of the ocean (Gulf Pilot Capt. C. G. Constable and Lieutenant A. W. Stiffe). In the Burma Pegu series, which corresponds very closely to the Fars in age and character, iresn water has occasionally been found, though most of it is brackish; it is not unlikely that some water-bearing bed in the Fars may also be found free from rock-salt and gypsum. It may not be necessary, however, to penetrate into the Fars beds. In fact, ere seems to me better chances of obtaining potable water from the superjacent Bakhtiari sandstones if these exist belew Koweit, and better chances still from the lowest horizons of the desert sand. One of the Bakhtiari conglomerates would be capable of holding up large quantities of water; a few miles south of Burqan water is so held up m considerable quantity and of good quality. It will be seen that the evidence to go upon is meagre in the extreme, and in ordinary circumstances, one would be very loath to advise such an expensive opera- Boring. tion as boring on such scanty data. But P ,, , v i ew the extreme scarcity of water d the crying necessity of the people here, who, out of the pearling season, number *£ee Geological map, Mem, Geol. Survey of India, Volume XXXIV, PartTi ■V r v li r' % some 40,000, and also in face of the fact that no artesian experiments have ever been made along this coast, I have no hesitation in strongly recommending trial borings at Koweit. The great element of uncertainty seems to me well worth ignoring on account of the great importance of the object. One of the most hopeful signs is ^ the reported occurrence of fresh water off Kubbar Island mentioned above. Cap tain Shakespear and I were unable to find this, but there is a well-known example of this at Bahrein, and the “Lapwings” testimony is quite definite enough. I do not think this water can have come from the Shatt-el-Arab ; in the first place, fresh water being less dense than salt, there would be a connecting strip of fresh water between Kubbar and the Shatt-el-jtrab, and, in the second place, the distance seems too great. It is far more likely that there is a submarine spring. As drilling would be undertaken more or less blindly, no local spot, as far as is known, would be preferable to any other; I should select one unlikely to be contaminated with foul surface water, convenient for the inhabitants, and removed as far as possible from the “jus” areas. The best method of drilling would be the American cable system, and the most suitable engine to work with would be an internal combustion oil-engine, since there would be] great difficulty in obtaining fresh water for a steam boiler. A suggestion made by Mr. C. B. Shaw of Messrs. Shaw and Haynes (Basrah), who has had experinece with water-wells in America, seems to me a sound one, namely, to procure at first a high-power engine capable of drilling to deep horizons (3,000 feet or more), and pipe apparatus suitable for the exploration of depths up to about 700-800 feet. If no success were met with, larger pipe and tools could be sent for and the same engine used for deeper boring. Salt water would, of course, have to be shut off by driving the pipe into clay or against a hard bed and perhaps the addition of hydraulic cement; this is a delicate operation and requires experienced supervision. As each water sand encountered should, whenever feasible, be tested as to its freshness, a good deal of under-reaming will probablyfbe entailed and progress consequently slow. The whole apparatus could subsequently be used for similar experiments in Bushire, Masqat and elsewhere; Dr. Pilgrim was inclined to think deep wells in Masqat would meet with water in quantity.* There seems to be much irregularity in the distribution of salt, so that the greater the number of test-wells the better. Dr. Pilgrim remarks that in Bahrein I sland, of two wells sunk within a few yards of each other, the one may be brackish a nd the other sweet. * file. * Note on a site for a proposed quarantine station in the Persian Gulf, etc., General Staff, India &gt; 4APPENDIX. No. 6, dated the 25th January 1910. From—The Commander, H. M. S. “ Lapwing ”, To—His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron. I have the honour to inform you that the Master of SS. ‘ ‘ Naseri 5 Bombay Persia Steam Navigation Company, reported to me that while passing Kubba Island in his way to Kuwait he sighted heavy breakers in a position S.-75-E., 4| miles from Kubba Island. He did not stop to sound, but fixed position of breakers whilst steaming along his course. 2. He further informed me that the breakers were so sharp that he was certain that there was either rock or coral in the position reported. 3. The following remarks are submitted for consideration :—‘ ‘ Lapwing ’ ’ has frequently been in the vicinity of Kubba Island, and it was observed on each occasion there was a very considerable tide causing tide-rips in various directions according to the hours of the tide. On one occasion a suspicious-looking patch of smooth water was observed close to the position now reported. Boats were lowered and it was sounded out, and soundings were found to agree with chart, but the water was nearly fresh. The Sheikh of Kuwait informed me that this was not caused by an under-water spring, but was fresh water that had come down from the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. In conclusion, I cannot understand how we failed to see the heavy breakers reported, as ** Lapwing ” has visited Kubba Island in all sorts of weather,’ i- &gt; !

The Anglo-Pers : an Oil Company, Ltd., To—J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire. ^We have the honour to enclose herewith a full estimate of the cost of in stalling a distilling plant of 100000 gallons capacity at Kuwait. Water Distilling plant for Kuwait. The plant will be capable of distilling from sea water 450 tons of drinkino- water per twenty-four hours, this quantity, roughly 100,000 gallons, will be nett gained distilled water, *.&lt;?., the plant will produce this amount and’ in addition enough to make up feed for boiler,—this is an important point as it enormously adds to the efficiency and life of plant. The plant offered is the most economical type which can be designed, giving 45-50 lbs. of water per pound of coal or 55-60 tons per ton of fuel oil consumed. This result would be a great deal increased by the addition of an economiser to the boiler plant. We would pomt out _ the extremely simple construction of the plant, the tubes being readily accessible both above and below the tube plate, the former, being straight and of medium length, can be readily and quickly cleaned, more over as any one or more stills can be cut out of the series leaving remainder at work it will not be necessary at any time to shut down the plant for cleaning and scaling purposes; of course this improvement on the older type plants adds a little to the cost, but it can readily be seen that this extra outlay is repaid many times over in the first year’s working. The boiler being fed with distilled w'ater would not require cleaning, etc , more than once a year and then the whole job could be completed in three days, even this could be obviated by fitting two boilers, but we hardly think the extra expense would be warranted. The buildings required for the complete plant would be, for the distilling plant 60 feet long, 3 o feet wide and 24 feet high, for the boiler and pumps 40 feet long 20 feet wide, and 15 feet high, all measurements being inside, the buildings would occupy the position below:—The buildings could be either of galvanized iron or mud brick. Two pumps would be required besides the ordinary boiler feed pump—one to feed^sti s and one to feed storage tanks from stills ; for this purpose we propose a 5 10 n. p. Oil engine belted to two centrifugal pumps. The total working expenses per annum would amount to about eighty thousand rupees on a twenty days per month basis, or a little more than a pice per gallon of water distilled. For Tanks we would suggest two fifty thousand gallons tanks, thus enabling them to be cleaned in turn without interfering at all with the continuous working ot plant. We are assured this plant can be kept in continuous operation for 360 days per annum, requiring one native engineer at about Rs. 75 and 4 coolies at Rs 13 per mensem for the care of same. We would tender for the same, and for the instruction of the operators, on a time and material basis. Herewith we append an estimate of the cost of the plant completely erected. Buildings in galvanized iron erected ... ... ... 350 Tanks in ste.l, with foundations erected and with cleaning 75° connections ... ••• ••• •** Boiler with brickwork, stack, etc. ... • . • 95° Pumps with engines, etc., erected ... . • • 200 Still, condensers and platforms therefor ... ... 9,862 Piping to sea, and tanks with valves 5° Incidentals ... ••• ••• ... • . . 150 Total • . t 12,312 The forecmins prices are based on the assumption that W 3 can obtam cool.es locally at Ktans two per diem, native bricks at rupees twenty-eight per thousand mud bricks a. rupees two and a half per thousand and ,n quantity sufficient to keep the working going steadily. Our prices for pipes, etc., allow a maximum distance between sea and plant of one hundred and fifty yards, between plant and tanks fi.ty yards. No C 9, dated Kuwait, the 17 th March 1914 - F rom Lieutenant- Colonel W. G. Grey, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, 1 have the honour to reply to your endorsement No. 594, dated 24th Feb ruary 1914, forwarding for an expression of my views an estimate of the c s of msiallinga water distilling plant at Kuwait. As you are aware I have recently visited Mohammerah in order to discuss the matter with the S aikh who w/s there, and with the Anglo Persian Oil Company s Engineer who was responsible for the preparation of the estimate. 2. I notice that the length of the plot of land required for the installation will be about fifty yards and its breadth some twelve yards. T he site has not yet been decided upon owing to the Shaikh’s continued absence from Kuwait but he assures me that there will be no difficulty, in fact that he will probably be able to provide a piece of ground of the dimensions required in the centre ot the town and on the sea shore. 1 have pointed out to him that such a position will be convenient for the majority of the purchasers of water, and will save expense owing to its proximity to the sea. The exact site can be fixed later. a I have represented to the Engineer of the Oil Company that coolies cannot be procured in Kuwait at less than Rs. 1-8 per diem, but as only about*-«■ ) r forty will be required this will not increase the estimate to any great extent. Native bricks, he informs me, can be landed at Kuwait at Rs. 28 per thousand, and we can have mud bricks made locally at a price very little exceeding that given m the estimate. All things considered, the Engineer and I are of opinion that in any case the initial expenditure will not exceed £ 12,500, at which sum it may be fixed -for present purposes. 4. The amount of water which it is suggested should be turned out is about 100,000 gallons per diem, or 25,000 kerosine oil tins full, a kerosine oil tin being the Kuwait measure, for twenty days in the month, and the working expenses on this basis are given at about Rs. 80,000 per annum. At present water is brought to Kuwait in native boats each carrying some 1,000 tins, the number of such boats varying according to season and from other causes; and in addition 18,000 tins are brought by the Shaikh’s steamer once a fortnight. The daily sale is said to be about 8,oco tins in winter and 16,000 in summer, but in summer the demand greatly exceeds the supply and it is then that hard ship is felt. It would thus apparently be necessary during the hot w r eather to work the plant for more days in the month than are suggested in the estimate, but the number could be reduced during the cooler season and the yearly working expenditure remain about the same. The amount of water produced yearly at 25,000 tins per diem for twenty days in the month is slightly in excess of the estimated yearly demand. 5. The rate of sale per kerosine oil tin of water in Kuwait varies according to the season and the quantity available. In summer it is generally As. and in winter has been as low as As. } per tin. Probably the best price for the Shaikh to fix at first would be As. \ per tin from November to April, and As. f per tin from May to October inclusive. This, presuming that the whole amount produced was sold, would give an average income of Rs. 15,625 per mensem. The amount of initial expenditure is estimated at Rs. 1,87,500 and the average working expenses at about Rs. 6,650 per mensem. In the event of the initial expenses being advanced to the Shaikh he would be in a position to repay the amount in two years by monthly instalments giving an average of Rs. 8,000; he could also defray the monthly working expenditure, and retain for himself a small profit, all out of the income realised. After the initial expenditure had been repaid the price of water could be reduced as considered advisable. 6. I have the honour to request that this scheme may now be submitted for the favourable consideration of the Government of India, who may be asked kindly to advance the initial expenses of the installation on the understanding that the amount is repayable in two years by monthly instalments giving an average of Rs. 8,000 per mensem ; repayment to commence from the date upon which the water-supply is realised. « * C 5 FD—44—13-4-14-GCBP SimlaV.'- 'b. wm ‘' Telegram P., No. S.-368, dated the 17th June 1914. r ' * From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla, 1 To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

The piping system would be fully equipped with valves, drains, vents, etc., as required to facilitate ease of working and cleaning. The boiler would be of a Lancashire type, with complete set of mountings, injectors, etc., and bricked up in workmanlike manner, complete with stack flues, and necessary dampers, converted to the use of oil fuel; the necessary oil tanks and piping being supplied and fitted. ( 2 ) We enclose a plan which shows the actual arran ^ement of stills, but does not show, unfortunately, the boiler or pump connections; however, we do not think that matters much. (3) In our driginal estimate we gave the working expenses per annum as Rs. 80,000 or a little more than half a pice per gallon of water dis tilled, working on the bases of twenty working days per month. This is based on figures that, we are assured by Suppliers, have been realized in actual working of these plants. Fifty-five to sixty tons of water distilled per ton of oil fuel consumed, that is, working on full load for twenty days, the plant could distil 8,000 tons of water consuming 160 tons of oil value say Rs. 5,000 or for twelve months Rs. 60,000, fuel for small pumping engines would amount to about Rs. 1,500 per 3 « C445FDannum, lubricating oil about Es. 1,000, repairs and overhauls, etc., say Es. 4,500.. Lighting about Es. 1,500. Leaving a balance of Es. 11,500 for wages and incidentals. I do not think I can give you any more information in time for this mail but if there remains any point still requiring elucidation, I shall be pleased to try and make it clear. We have estimated very safely throughout on all costs of plant and material as we understood Captain Shakespear wanted an outside price. The 450 ton plant will consist of the same parts as the 225 ton, described in the following pages, with the exception that the various parts will be increased in size. The staging will be much heavier, each still, of which there will be six, will be 6 ' O' diameter inside, and will contain 530-2 // and 21-4 // copper tubes 6 feet long. The vapour connections between pans will be 14 // diameter and will be provided with similar cut out connections to those on the smaller plant. The vapour pipe from the last pan will connect it to a condenser, which will contain 450-l // brass tubes each 12 feet long. The internal diameter of this condenser will be 4'-0 // . The small multiple heaters in the vapour pipes will now contain 180 square feet of copper heating surface’and for circulating water through the condensers and these heaters, we would apply a double ram pump, having rams 6 ' diameter and S' stroke. Otherwise the connections and other items remain as in the case of the small installation. Specification of patent sextiple plant for the production of 225 tons of distilled water per 24 hours from sea water. Proposed for Captain Shakespear, Kuwait. Duty. —It is understood that the plant which we are proposing is capable of producing 225 tons nett of fresh water per 24 hours. That is to say, it will produce this quantity of water together with sufficient to feed the boiler which operates the plant. General. —The plant would consist of six “ Scott ” patent tubular evaporators carried on an iron and steel staging with platform and handrail together with the necessary condenser, vapour pipes and liquor pipes as set out in detail herewith. Staging. —This will consist of two 9 ' X 7 ' rolled steel joists made up in con venient lengths with the necessaryffish plates for connection. These joists will form the main support and these are carried from 6 steel stanchions which will be con structed from 8' X 6' rolled steel joists fitted complete with capital and bases. From these main joists will be carried the bearing joists which will carry the evap orators. There are 12 of these and each is of §' X5' rolled steel joist. Platform. —The above-mentioned joists also carry the platform which is of diamond pattern chequer plate 3' 6' wide carried along the whole front of the plant. The sides of the platform will be protected where necessary by a wrought iron hand rail carried in castiion stanchions. Ladder. —To give access to the platform for the purpose of operating the plant, we would supply a steel ladder composed of steel channels with chequer plate treads. Stills. —Each of these six stills will consist of a heating system parallel top with dome and a dished bottom. These stills are carried from the staging by means of two castiron brackets attached to the heating system, and the brackets are each secured to the bearing joists by means of two f' bolts in each. Heating System. —The heating system of each effect will be 4 ' 6' internal dia meter by 5' l' maximum diameter and it will be 5' 11 ' long. It will be constructed in steel plate, vertical seams being double rivetted. The flanges at each end are formed from angle iron bent and welded into an endless ring and afterwards rivettedto the shell by f' rivets at 2 ' pitch. These flanges are faced on their joining surfaces after being rivetted to the shells, and consequently a true joint can be form ed without straining. The following fittings are upon each heating system shells. On No. 1 there will be a 3' diameter hole with a forged steel facing pad, to which is attached a high pressure steam valve, and there will be another hole with a facing pad for the removal of the condensed water. This latter facing will be present on all the other holes, but instead of a 3 ' hole and facing for steam, they will be fitted with a 10 ' internal diameter mouthpiece of wrought steel to receive the vapour coirinection. The flanges of the heating system are drilled with clearing holes for 5-8' bolts at about 3' pitch and into these holes are placed alternatively 3-8' bolts and set screws. These bolts and screws attach the tube plates to the flanges. Each tube plate is 5' 1 ' diameter and is turned from mild steel plates which have been cold flattened, and which are J' thick. In these plates are cut 265 2' diameter holes and 13-4' diameter holes for the reception of the tubes which form the heating surface. The tubes are of solid drawn copper arranged on our special rapid circulation system, which causes a free circulation of the liquor and thus gives a minimum deposit of scale. Each tube is 6 ' OJ' long and all the tubes forming the heating surface are of 14 gauge. The tubes are secured to the tube plates by expanding, and being perfect ly straight they are easily cleaned or renewed when either of these operations becomes necessary. Each system is fitted with 3-8' air cock. Top Pan .—To the top pan of each heating system is attached, by means of the bolts and crews previously mentioned, the parallel top. This is of the same diameter as the heating system, and it is 7' 6 ' high. It is constructed of j' steel plate with rivetted joints and it is provided with flanges bent, welded and faced exactly as described for the heating system. Mounted on each top pan is a pressure gauge, feed valve, protected gauge gldss, manhole cover with air cock and our special anti-priming valve. The manholes which are 14'' diameter are provided with a cover fitted with handles, and the air cock is screwed into this manhole cover. Into the top of the parallel top piece is rivetted a dome formed of |' steel plate, dished and flanged. In the centre of this dome is rivetted a 10 ' diameter wrought steel flanged mouthpiece, and to this mouthpiece is attached the catch vessel which will be referred to later. Bottom Pan .—This is also of |' steel plate with angles, exactly as previously described. Each pan will be of the same diameter as the rest of the still over a distance of about 6 ', and from this point it will be dished in a similar manner to the dome piece in the top pan. Accessibility. —Free access is given to each still by means of a manhole on the top and bottom pans. By this means the whole of the tubes in the pan are easily accessible, either for inspection or renewal, or cleaning, and we will draw your atten tion to the fact that the top pan is made of sufficient depth to allow the tubes to be taken out and passed through the manhole. This obviates the necessity for dis mantling the pan. Catch Vessd.—On the top of each still and attached thereto by bolts is one of our double baffle cast iron catch vessels which is provided as a final safeguard against boiling over. Vapour Pipes .—From the top of the catch vessel, spring vapour pipes which are of cast iron 10 ' inside diameter with machined flanges. These vapour pipes connect the top of the catch vessel of No. 1 pan to the heating system of No. 2 pan, and the top of the catch vessel of No. 2 pan to the heating system of No. 3 pan and so on. The vapour pipes are further flanged in such a manner that either one of the pans may be cut out for cleaning or repairs. In this way the Plant can either work C445FD 5r AH included in complete ten- M der. ' as a sextiple or quintiple effect. The valves will all be of the full way pattern and will have cast iron bodies and gun metal valves in facings. The vapour pipes from the sixth effect will connect to a condenser. Multiple Heaters—In each length of vapour pipe there will be a small heater having a heating surface of 90 square feet of copper tubes. By means of these heaters the water will be increased in temperature in stages until it enters No. 1 still at a temperature practically the same as the steam. Condenser. —This will be carried horizontally and it would consist of a body and chambers, tubes and tube plates. Body. —This is constructed of cast iron 5-8' thick, and it will be 3' 0' diameter by 7T1' long. The ends of this vessel are flanged to take the tube plates and these flanges are machined. The inside of the body is provided with ribs so that internal baffles can be fitted to the condensers. By the use of this baffle, the vapour is deflected in its passage through the condenser and its travel is in a direction contrary to the flow of the cooled water. The tube plates which are attached to the flanges of the body would be of steel V thick. Into these tubeplates would be expanded 300-1' diameter brass tubes, each tube being 8' 0' long. The ends of the condensers are closed by means of cast iron waist piece 9' deep and to the flange of which is attached a cast iron cover It is on the 9' deep waist piece that the water inlet and outlet to the condenser is formed. The advantage of having this waist piece will be readily seen, as it allows the tubes to be cleaned or replaced w ithout dismantling the water connections. Receiver. —Under the condenser there would be a cast iron receiver, 4'0' diameter by 8' 0' long in which the whole of the distillated water produced would be collected. Water Circulating Pump. —For circulating the cooling water through the con denser we would propose to supply a vertical double ram, steam driven pump having rams 4j' diameter by 6' stroke, and steam cylinder 7' diameter by 6' stroke. e should connect this pump in such a manner as to allow the circulating water to be passed through the condenser and then from the outlet of the condenser, part of the water would be taken through the multiple heaters and thence to No. 1 pan and the overplus of water would be allowed to escape through a relief valve back into the sea. Connections. —We would supply the whole of the vapour and water connections between the various parts of the plant itself and also the necessary pipes for connect ing our water circulating pump to the condenser. Exceptions. —We do not supply any brick, wood or concrete work, nor do we supply the connections bringing the \\ ater to the suction of the circulating pump, and the pump and pipes for removing the condensed water from the condenser. This would be extra. We might mention that we have not included in our price for material for lagging the outside of the stills and condenser. Water produced. —We have in this way provided for the distilled water which is produced in pan Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, but not for the water produced in the heating system of No. 1 pan. This is water which has been produced by the con densation of the steam sent to the plant from your boiler, and you will have to connect the steam trap which we provide on the system to your boiler. You will thus be provided with a quantity of water which is almost sufficient for feeding the boiler at a temperature very near to that of the water in the boiler. The small quantity of feed water that will be required to make up the loss due to leakage and other causes, can be taken from the heating system of No. 2 pan in a similar manner it is taken from No. 1, and we propose to supply the connections for this purpose. Time of delivery. —We would deliver in about six months, erection, etc., would take another two or three. r r,No. Cf.-59 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 26th July 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. In continuation of the concluding paragraph of my letter No. Cf.-21 of 8th July 1914, on the subject of the Kuwait Water Supply, I have now the honour to submit, for the consideration of the Government of India, the following suggestions and comments put forward by the Political Agent, Kuwait:— “ As the machinery of this instalment is both elaborate and delicate, it would be well to have a European engineer in charge if possible. The sum allotted in the letter of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from monthly expenditure to f balance for wages and incidentals ' would presum ably cover part of a monthly salary for such an official, and a small increase in working expenses to meet the remainder could be arranged without difficulty. The Shaikh is not in Kuwait at present, but I am sure he would approve of this suggestion as the Indian engineers employed with his motor car, electric light, etc., are not, on the whole, satisfactory. “ Should the tender of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company be accepted, it would be convenient to induce them to undertake to keep the plant in working order for a time, say three months, after it commences to work. “ From a larger experience of Kuwait, including part of the hot weather, however, I am not sure that the sale of water has not been overesti mated, and, to be on the safe side, world ask that an average rate of Rs. 6,000 per mensem may be accepted by Government for repay ment on the understanding that the average of Rs. 8,000 at first pro posed will be adhered to if possible. ”No. 947-E.A. (Confidential), dated Simla, the 22nd September 1914. From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire. ’ lam directed to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. Cf.-59, dated the 26th July 1914, on the question of the water supply at Ku wait. J 2. The Government of India are of opinion that in the interests of the Shaikh of Kuwait it will be advisable to include a clause in the contract with the Anglo Persian Oil Company to the effect that the latter will undertake to keep the plant in working order for 6 months, or for at least 3 months, after it commences to work and that the plant shall be handed over at the end of that time in proper working order and yielding the full estimated quantity for each of the 3 preceding months* i.e., for the whole period if the shorter term of 3 months is adopted and for the last 3 months if the longer. It is expected that this would give the firm a margin in the first 3 months to rectify any initial deficiencies such as often occur in new installa tions. 3. It is also necessary that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should undertake to employ and tram for this period the Engineer who is to be in charge of the installa tion. 4. I am to request that the Government of India may be informed whether the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are prepared to undertake the contract on the above conditions. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. 0. 445 F.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for favourable consideration and the very early decision of the Government of India a request which Sheikh Si^ Mubarak-as-Subah has made to me, soliciting the loan to him by Government of a sum of rupees two lakhs, repayable in tvo instalments, after the gathering of the hext two date crops. 2. The Sheikh in making his request informed me that his need has arisen from a variety of cases The Sheikh has had recently to pay some £ 7000 to £ 0000 for a water tank steamer in an attempt he made to solve the water supply difficulty in Kuwait. The pearl market has been steadily falling ior over a year with the result that large parcels of pearls are still unsold in Bombay and cannot ho realized at once without a very heavy loss, especially in tho present very disturbed state of tho money market in Bombay. Inaoili «„• ' fc0 in Bombay oauscs severe distress in Kuwait among the diving oommunity, who live in a very hand-to-mouth fashion on advances from their nakhudas. Further. Sheikh Abdur Rahman bin Rrahim, one of the largest brokers in Bombay employed by Kuwait pearl- dealers has just filed his petition as an insolvent Bombay courts. He hold at the time between 4 and 5 lakhs worth of Kuwait pearls. AgainAgain t though Sheikh Mubarak draws a very considerable revenue rom his date-gardens on the 3hatt-al-Arab he is unable to realise it until the buyers have disposed of the dates in the course of the oold weather. He informed me that some six lakhs of rupees were at present locked up in dates, oi which none will be available until the next season unless he presses the buyers, which he is unwilling to do apart from such a course beinr* contrary to custom, 3. Ho has boon financing the Kuwait pearl to wash os and nakhudas with all the cash he can sifcat collect in order to tide them over the present low level of the pearl market, and unless he can ho Ip theiu xiu-ther a large number will be ruined by being forced to soli at prices far below their original purchase money, and this will be followed by a reaction on the local trade of Kuwait. 4* The Sheikh said he would not have asked unless it had been absolutely necessary and if Government would be so good as to accommodate him, (and it must be practically at once if the situation is to be relieved), he would undertake to repay half the loan after the date crop of 1914 and the other half a year Inter. He bees that Government will assist him and in order to save ht® time and further references he agreed to my suggestion that ho should forward to me a written request embodying and accepting the same conditions as were formulated in your Arabic letter Ho. 192 dated the 1st June 1909 to his address, when Government were pleased to sanction a loan in that year. I have the honour to forward a copy and translation of the Sheikh's letter for information. 5. I have the honour to recommend that the Sheikh's request may be favourably received for apart from suoh assistance being politic there is ample soourity for repayment of the loan (a natter in which the Sheikh haa always kept his word hitherto) and also heoause his enlightened and pnblio spirited action ir supportin K hie people in the time of their need is coEimendable ana worthy of enoouragenent. Should Government he pleased to sanctionsanction the loan, trhioh to bo of real use should be made axactiacc available at latest within a month from date, the Sheikh requests that it may be paid direct to his agent in Bombay, Mahomed-Salim as-Sadarawi, and it would save yet further time if Mahomed Salim could bo notified direct as soon as the loan is sanctioned. Owinp- to the urgency of the matter I would beg that it may be submitted to Government by telegraph. I have, etc., Sd/- W. H. I.

It is in the sense which we desired, that is to say that, in accordance with your request the British Government is prepared to accommodate Your Excellency with a loan of two lakhs of rupees without interest on two conditions, firstly, that reoavment is made in two instalments, one lakh after this date season, and the other lakh after the next year’s date season ; secondly, that, until this loan is entirely repaid, Your Excellency undertakes not to borrow money from other sources. These conditions are simple and 1 know will be accepted by you readily. Now if you wish for the money in cash, it is here in rupees, and should you need it urgently and will send your launch or ask Captain Shakespear to send his launch to Fao with a telegram to me saying that you accept the conditions and wish the money sent across, then I will send it over in the 'Lawrence at once. May you be preserved and salaam from No. 315 , dated Koweit, the 7 th June 1909 . From—C aptain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1312, dated the 1st June 1909, with an enclosure for Sheikh Mubarak.2. The letter was delivered on the 4th June and the same evening I had an interview with the Sheikh who expressed himself profound y gra e u a e generosity of the British Government in accommodating him. o In the course of conversation, the Sheikh categorically accepted the conditions of the loan and requested me to telegraph his acceptance, promising to send to me on the following day a document m the form of a letter to you formally accepting the conditions. I wrote out the telegram despatched to you from Fao and having read it over to the Sheikh handed to him the closed envelope for conveyance to Fao. 4. The following morning I received the enclosed letter from the Sheikh to your address, a copy of which I have taken the opportunity of retaining for my records. In it the Sheikh accepts all the conditions of the loan and duly expresses his gratitude, promising the first instalment in the beginning of Shawal 1327 A.H. and the second in the end of Shawal 1328 A-H. Translationof a letter from Sheikh Mubarak bin Subah, Ruler of Koweit, to Major P. Z. COX, C.I.E., British Resident and His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General, dated 16 th Jemadi I, 1327 = 5 th June 1909 . After compliments and enquiries after your health, I have duly received your esteemed favour of the 1 2th Jemadi I, No. 192, stating that the High British Government have favoured me, according to my application, with a loan of Rs. 2,00,000. I, your sincere friend, admit and acknowledge the generosity of the Government towards me and am sensible to their good graces. Inshallah these graces will endure for me and for those succeeding me, and there will be obedience and sincerity on our part. The terms contained in your esteemed favour have been duly accepted by me and I will, Inshallah, pay the first of the two lakhs during this date season of 1327, viz^ that I will refund Rs. 100,000 in the beginning of Shawal 1327, with gratitude. The remaining Rs. 100,000 I will pay, Inshallah, during the season after this, namely of the year 1328 which will be over at the end of Shawal 1328, As to the last condition that I should borrow no money from any other quarter (I beg to say that) as long as the British Government exists, we will, Inshallah, have no necessity to refer to any other besides them. You have enriched me and honoured me ; and I will not agree absolutely to deal with any one besides you, I represented to Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, accordingly, and I sent you a telegram via Fao on the night of Saturday the 16th instant, intimating my acceptance of the conditions contained in your esteemed favour and asking you to order the remittance of the money by the man-of-war “ Lawrence ” according to your letter.

IX. ^ I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His I/ajesty*s Treasury to acknowledge the receipt of Sir F. Campbell's letter of the 1st instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the India Office further on the subject of the proposed loan to the Sheikh of Koweit. ^ j Their Lordships direct me to state for the inforrna- , f tion of Sir E. Grey that They think Lord liorley may be under some misapprehension as to the intention and effect of Their letter of the 8th ultimo, which was written of course on the assumption that the foreshore lease and rent will, so far as can be foreseen, con tinue for a period sufficient to provide for complete repayment of the loan by way of deduction if necessary together with any interest on overdue instalments if the Indian Government should ultimately decide to charge such interest. Their Lordships agreed to a con tinuance of the payment of the Imperial share of £2000 a Ihe Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.0 assR a year during any period for which the whole rent might necessarily he withheld, and this secures the Indian G-overnment against loss, (if any loss is possible) to the full extent of the Imperial share of the Joint security. Further under the last paragraph of the Treasury letter it was left open to the Indian Govern ment to arrange, on the same security, for payment of interest, if they should decide to do so, although it appeared from the correspondence that the balances from v/hich the loan would be advanced were not interest- bearing . Hie form in which Their Lordships assented to take a part in the arrangement appeared to Them to be the most natural and convenient in view of the existing system of adjustment between the two Exchequers, and They hope that on reconsideration Lord Morley will see his way to accept it.

I am to transmit to you herewith copy of a further letter from the India Office,* expressing Lord Morley’s regret that their Lordships have not accepted the conditions originally formulated by the India Office, and the hope that they may see their way to reconsider their decision, in default of which reconsideration the advance will not be sanctioned. I am to state that, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, it is a matter of great political importance not only to India, but to the Empire generally, that His Majesty’s Govern ment should retain unimpaired their influence over the Sheikh of Koweit, and that the refusal of the advance which that Chief requires would be calculated to weaken that influence in a marked degree. I am accordingly to express the hope that their Lordships may see their way to reconsider their decision on this question, as suggested in the India Office letter, and that they will consent that any loss which may arise in connection with the pioposed transaction should be shared equally between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers on the lines laid down by the India Office in their communication to this Department of the 19th March. . . . . .

From Dated Received at London Office telegram, to communicate Secretary of State. U$Vvr H From Viceroy, 22nd February 1909. Foreign Secret. Koweit. Sheikh has applied to Political Agent for loan of Rs. 2,00,000, free of interest, to be repaid in two yearly instalments. Sheikh has been making large purchases of land, and explains that his need for ready money is due to large advances made to pearl merchants who cannot be pressed for immediate repayment, and to fact that his brother, Sheikh Khazal, has asked for postponement of payment of this year’s instalment of large loan due to Sheikh Mubarak. Knox suggests that opportunity might be taken to press settlement ol quarantine question rent of Agency house. See correspondence sent with weekly letter No. 37 M, dated 10th September 1908. Cox, who strongly supports application, considers that loan should be made independently of any political advantages that might be taken of it. We consider that it is desirable for political reasons, and to prevent possibility of Sheikh applying for pecuniary assistance elsewhere, to make required advance free from interest on condition that it is repaid in two yearly instalments, and that until repayment is made, Sheikh shall not borrow from other sources. We do not anticipate any difficulty in procuring repayment. Loan of Rs. 1,00,000 advanced m 1904 was promply repaid. See our Despatch No. 169 (Secret-External), dated 11th September 1904. We agree with Cox that advance should not be made contingent upon settlement of quarantine or other questions. Amount o loan can be made available from Treasury balance at Bushire, and as loan is reo uired by 22nd March, and Imperial Bank of Persia requires early notice of intention to transfer, we should be glad if sanction could be communicated by telegraph.3Zfi&gt; . • o Kj In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 13515/09. n £13,333 and address - The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. ■XT (1^) ..

Sir:- I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury Mr. Mallet's letter of the 29th ultimo (10682/09) with its enclosure from the India Office in which Lord Morley suggests that the Imperial Exchequer should share with India the liability for any loss arising from a proposed loan of £13,333 to the Sheikh of Kov/eit. It appears that the liability in respect of a previous loan to the Sheikh in 1904 was entirely under taken by India, and W Lords understand that in the present instance the money would be similarly advanced from Indian funds. Their Lordships are, however, asked to share the liability of loss (which is said to be improoable) in the present instance on the security of the rent of £4,000 a year which is paid hy India to the Sheikh for the lease of certain foreshore, one half of such rent being The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.being repayable to India by the Imperial Government, in the annual adjustment under Subhead LL oi the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, in accordance with the arrangement approved by Treasury letter of the 21st September 1907 (17060/07). They direct me to state, for the information of Sir E. Grey that in the event of the Indian Government being compelled to withhold payment of the above rent in default of repayment of the loan. They have no ob jection to the continuance of the payment of the Imperial stare of the rent to the Indian Government by way of adjustment, provided that satisfactory evidence of payment by deduction from sums owing can be produced for audit purposes; but They do not feel disposed extend Their liability beyond such continuance, which They hope will sufficiently meet the wishes of the Secretary of State for India and Sir E. Grey. They think that any question of interest might remain the concern of the Indian Government, which advances tne money. I am, &amp;c., (Signed) G. H. Murray.Copy. PresBiiig. (10682/09) FOREIGN OFFICE, ' March 29tli, 1909. Sir:- 1 ^ I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, to he laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, a copy of a letter from the India Office forwarding a telegram from the Viceroy of India, pro posing to comply with a request made by the Sheikh of Koweit for a loan of two lakhs (£13,333) to be repaid in two yearly instalments without interest and with the sole condition that, pending repayment, the Sheikh should not borrow elsewhere. The Secretary of State for India reconiriends that the Government of Indian proposal should be approved subject to certain conditions one of which is that any loss arising out of the transaction shall be shared equally between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. It will be seen that the proposal involves no ■ direct charge upon public revenues and that Hie Majes ty's The Secretary to the Treasury.Majesty's Government have as security the amount of the rental paid to the Sheikh for the lease of his fore shore. With regard to the previous loan to the Sheikh to which reference is made, that advance was effected on the responsibility of the Government of India alone. In view of the considerations advanced by the Gov ernment of India Sir E. Grey considers that the present scheme should be agreed to on the conditions proposed by Viscount Morley; and he recommends to the favourable ^ consideration of the Lords Commissioners the suggestion that in the improbable event of any loss arising out of the transaction, such loss should be shared equally be tween the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. I am to invite attention to the importance of arriving as soon as possible at a decision in the matter in order that a reply may be returned to the Government of India at the earliest possible date.

A., C.I.E., Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that Sheikh Mubarak paid me a visit this morning welcoming me on my return to Koweit. 2. The honour was unusual and rather unexpected, as it was the morrow of the * Eed ’ and it would have rather been my place to have paid Sheikh Mubarak the usual visit, congratulating him on the auspicious occasion, and I should have done so, had the Sheikh not anticipated me. 3. After a long and particularly friendly conversation, the Sheikh approached me on the main object of his visit. He explained that he had been making large purchases of land, notably Fadhaglya, of which the acquisition has already been reported in this Agency diary for the week ending 30th December, and also the purchase of Umm al Garab from Sheikh Sadun of the Muntafich. 4. The latter purchase was interrupted by tbe late Wali of Basrah, and I was not aware that Sheikh Mubarak was again in treaty for this piece of land. The point, however, does not appear to be of any great importance for the purposes of this report, as Sheikli Mubarak declares in short that be has recently spent or has to meet before the end of Kabi-al-Awwal of this year (about 20th of April) a sum of T£92,000, approximately equivalent to eleven and-a-alf lakhs of rupees. 5 . He explained to me that he had plenty of money, but that it was out in merchandize, large sums had been advanced to pearl merchants who could not at once he pressed for repayment, that his brother, Sheikh Khazal, had asked to be excused, in consequence of his expenses in regard to Hawaiza, the payment of this year’s instalment of a large loan due to Sheikh Mubarak, and that the Sheikh looked to the liberality of Government to help him with a loan free of interest of two lakhs of rupees before the 1st of Rabi-ul-Awwal= 22 nd of March 1909 which would be repaid in two yearly instalments. He asked that the money might be advanced in Koweit and that repayment would be effected in Bombay through his agent as usual. 3195 f. n.- m 6 . Oar experience of the prompt repayment of the last loan made to Sheikh Mubarak leads me to recommend with great confidence that the loan should be advanced to him. The only question tha remains for consideration is whether or no any conditions should be attached to the grant. The only pending questions that can be touched with any hope of succ^s are (1) the rent of the present Agency and (2) the Quarantine ques ion. In fact the only other present question likely to cause difficulties is that of Arms’ trade and I fear that no concession or promise in this respect obtained in connection with the loan would be of the slightest value. 7. On each of the two questions noted above, I propose todo myself the honour of addressing you separately and would ask that my letters may he read in connection with this despatch. 8. G. P L—3195 F.

Simla, the 1st September 1904. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch No. 32, dated the 22nd July 1904, calling for a report as to the considerations which led the Government of India to grant a loan of Rs. 1,00,000 to the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. In reply, we have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule. It will be observed that in January 1904 Sheikh Mubarak expressed to Colonel Kemball, who was then on a visit to Koweit, his desire to secure a loan to enable him to meet the payments due in connection with the settlement of the dispute between him and his nephews regarding the division of the family properties near Eao and Basrah. Subsequently, on Colonel KembalFs advice, he preferred a formal request for an advance of Rs. 1,00,000. 3. Having regard to the nature of our relations with the Sheikh, and as the need for the loan had arisen out of a settlement, in the conclu sion of which we had shewn a special interest, we considered it desirable that he should he prevented from turning for pecuniary help to any other quarter; and we accordingly decided to render the required assistance, and sanctioned the loan on the condition that it should be repaid before the close of 1905 in two instalments, and that the Sheikh should undertake, pending the repayment of the amount, not to borrow from other sources without previous reference to us. 4. It will be noted from Major Cox’s letter No. 230, dated the 23rd July, that Sheikh Mubarak has given the required undertaking ; and in acknowledg ing the receipt of the money, has further promised to repay it before the date stipulated. As to the property settlement, His Majesty’s Consul at Basrahreported by telegram on the 12th July that the matter was closed, Sheikh Muharak haying arranged the payments due to his nephews. We trust that our action will meet with your approval. 5. We have noted, for future guidance, the orders contained in the con cluding sentence of paragraph 2 of your letter, directing that, on general grounds, loans to authorities or persons outside India should not he granted without your sanction.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that when I was recently at Koweit, Sheikh Mubarak made a request to me to the effect that the British Government would be so good as to make an advance of Rs. 1,00,000 to him to enable him to pay the amount due by him to his nephews in accordance with the settlement lately arrived at. I told the Sheikh that it would be advisable that he should put his request in writing, and the Sheikh accordingly handed to me the letter, a copy of which I submit herewith. Before submitting the Sheikh’s request for the consideration and orders of the Government of India, I thought it advisable to make certain enquiries on the subject from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, whose reply I have the honour to forward herewith. I am of opinion that it would be as well to comply with the Sheikh’s request on the understanding that half of the loan will be repaid before the end of the current year, and the balance before the end of 1905, the sum due to the nephews being paid, as suggested by Mr. Crow, through the Consulate at Basrah.

After compliments .—Let it not be hidden from you regarding our boys who are in Basrah that after the inspection of the properties by Haji Mansur Sulman and the experts, that which has to go to the boys in place of one-quarter of Fao is my share in the Girdilan, Ajeiravieh, Zein, Sufiyeh, and Khor properties, as well as 8,000 liras (Turkish pounds). Of these (8,000 L.) 2,000 L. are on account of date crops of past years, and 6,000 for last year’s date crop of the Zein and Sufiyeh properties. Of these (6,900 L.) 1,000 liras (the Sheikh presumably means one thousand five hundred L.) are over estimated. The Bao property becomes my own property, and the aforesaid properties and the money will go to the boys. Now I have no money at present from which I can pay the sum. I accordingly request that the British Government will kindly give me a loan of Rs. 1,00,000 which is wanted by me in the month of Mohurrum 1322, i.e., the next month, for payment to the boys. I will repay with gratefulness Rs. 50,000 the next date season, ie., the date season of 1322, and the balance of Rs. 50,000 the year after, i.e., the date season of 1323.

I would draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that the matter has not been reported to me separately, and that I am not in possession of the considerations which led the Government of India to make the loan. The position of the Sheikh of Koweit is such that inconvenience may arise if I am not consulted on questions of impor tance affecting his relations with the British Government, and it is moreover desirable on general grounds that loans to authorities or persons outside India should not be granted without my sanction. 3. I request that I may be furnished with a report on the subject.The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 9th June 1904. In continuation of our Secret despatch No. 97 (External), dated the 12th May 1904, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, the accompanying memorandum of information, received during the month of May 1904, regarding external affairs other than those relating to the North-West Erontier and Afghanistan. We have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, rajuExternal,1. The Commission was still engaged throughout the month in the Subaihi country. By arrangements with the Ottoman Commis sioners a Turkish detachment was sent to escort a British surveyor working west of Hawab. On enquiry, A1 Akma (see paragraph 1 of Memorandum for April) was identified with a place marked as El Khamar on the War Office map of South-West Arabia, some fifty miles to the east of Mokha. On the 10th May, Colonel Wahab telegraphed that the true Atiffi border appears to extend to a point immediately north of Dabab, while Akka, the extreme Buremi limit, would seem to be near Shebe; a line from El Khamar to the north of Dabab would thus be the true limit of Subaihi territory within which Sheikh Said constitutes an enclave. The claims of the Subaihis to this boundary are by no means shadowy, but are supported by oral, as well as documentary, evidence. Colonel Wahab is inclined, how ever, to accept a line running nearly straight from latitude 13° 5' and longitude 43° 49' to Turba. This line would follow the watershed between the Bed Sea and the Gulf of Aden, dividing the Subaihi subjects who still pay tribute to the Subaihi Chiefs and those who within recent years have been brought under Ottoman influence, and would leave to the Turks some 550 square miles of Subaihi terri tory, which, though sparsely populated, is from its geographical position an important tract. The Government of Bombay and General Maitland have recommended the adoption of this line, adding, however, that care should be taken to ensure the frontier passing as close to Sheikh Said as possible with the object of securing command of the harbour, the possible construction of which was discussed some years ago. On the 26th the Commission were asked to make a full enquiry and report by letter, with illustrative maps, as to the Dabab and Turba lines, as the matter is of importance on strategic grounds. 2. On the 28th May, a telegram was received from Colonel Wahab, stating that the Commission had arrived at Perim and visitedthe Turkish Commission at Shaikh Said. The Turba village is close under the fort, and Colonel Wahab has suggested that the boundary line be drawn at a low range one mile east of Turba. It is now estimated that the actual survey of the country will be com pleted about the 1st June. 3. H. M. S. “ Porpoise’ , was at Perim during the month to exercise immediate pressure, should the Turks prove obstructive when the Commission reached the neighbour hood of Sheikh Said. 4. On the 10th May, the Secretary of State telegraphed that Sir N. O’Conor had again urged the importance of the actual delimita tion of the line north-east from the Wadi Bana to the desert which he considered would be much more satisfactory than a notification to the Porte of the line we would propose. He thought that it would be most unwise to trust solely to the geographical position of the Hadramaut to prevent the Turks from gaining a footing there, and suggested that, after an interval of rest, Mr. Pitzmaurice should be invited to undertake the duty in concert with a small Turkish Commission, also that his opinion be obtained whether opposition from the Turks is to be feared and whether a large escort is necessary. On the receipt of this communication General Maitland telegraphed that he was of opinion that, as a preliminary to north-east demarcation or survey, it was highly desirable that the Bube’aten group of districts should be acknowledged by the Turks as belonging to the Yaffai, and that the Upper Aulaki should be recognised as one of the nine tribes. He was further of opinion that the Commission undertaking the operations should be well escorted, and that the work should not be attempted until fresh troops had arrived in October or November. Mr. Pitzmaurice thought that actual delimitation would encounter strong opposition from the Turks, and that the most likely way of obtaining the topographical data required for subsequent delimitation or other decision between the two Governments, would be to procure the issue of precise and categorical instructions to the Turks to make a joint survey of a belt of some 20 kilometres on both sides of the true north-east line from Lakmat-as-Shub to the desert. He pointed out the peculiar difficulties that would stand in the way and, like General Maitland, considered that a large military force would be necessary to prevent possible conflict with the natives. The risks, he said would be minimised by attaching to any force on the line of communication a Political Officer acquainted with Arabia and the people of the country. The Government of Bombay have practically reiterated the opinion of the Resident at Aden, but so far no decision has been arrived at in the matter.[ 3 ] 5. In reply to an enquiry made by the Secretary of State, the Resident at Aden has reported that the conclusion of a treaty with the Chief of Beda is still in abeyance. The Chief is in Aden again, but his cousin, who is the real administrator, will not come forward, being apparently under some hostile influence. 6 . Colonel Wahab has proposed that Mr. Pitzmaurice, Lieutenant Tandy, and the Turkish Commissioners should proceed either to Constantinople or Simla to complete their maps and final report. The Government of India have suggested to the Secretary of State that it will be more convenient at the present stage for the party to recess at Simla than at Constantinople. 7. Information was received during the month that the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla had detained at Mokalla a dhow with arms and ammunition, intended apparently for the Somali Mulla. Captain Merewether, Assistant Resident at Aden, who on receipt of this news was sent to Mokalla, brought back with him 31 Somalis, 33 Gras rifles, and 1,550 rounds of Gras ammunition, together with the cargo of the dhow, consisting of 738 bags of rice and a quantity of dates and American piece-goods, of the class from which the Mulla has made a kind of uniform for his men. The dhow which has been left at Mokalla, pending the result of an enquiry now being held at Aden, is said to belong to Obbia, and to sail sometimes under the Italian flag, and some times under Zanzibar colours. She left Aden on the 23rd January last for Obbia, carrying certain passengers, who have for the present been detained at Aden. The dhow’s move ments, after leaving Aden, appear to have been suspicious, and there is no doubt that she visited ports on the Somali Coast not covered by her manifest. PERSIAN GULP. 8 . El Katr .—It is reported from Katr that Ali-al-Asairi, Sheikh of the Muathit, residing at A1 Bidaa, proposes to erect a town on the north-east corner of Helat Bui Kaifan, about ten miles eastward of Ras Mashut, as a mark for the guidance of pearling boats when making for Al Bidaa. 9. El Hassa .—The Monasir Arabs are reported (25th April 1904) to have recently captured and killed the Turkish courier engaged between El Hassa and Katr. It is said that this tribe recently applied to Abdul Rahman-bin-Paisal for protection, and that the latter informed them that, when they produced letters from the headmen of El Hassa to the effect that they are on good terms with them, he would consider the matter.10. Koweit .—It is reported (7th May) that three dhows recently arrived at Koweit from Maskat with 2,000 rifles on board. Of these, 700 belonged to Mons. Goguyer, and the rest to different Koweit merchants. The masters of the boats expressed unwillingness to ship the arms, hut consented on being furnished by Mons. Goguyer with a paper indemni fying them against loss and dangers of search by men-of-war. Sheikh Mubarak has set apart a house for Haji Ali Dahaba, Mons. Goguyer’s Native Agent. The latter arrived at Koweit with Mons. Goguyer’s nephew, Mons. Elbaz, who has returned to Maskat. 11 . The Government of India have sane- tioned the grant to the Sheikh of Koweit of a loan of Us. 1 , 00,000 to meet the payment due to his nephews under the recent arbitration award. The only condition of the loan is that, pending its repayment, the Sheikh shall borrow from no other source. 12 . In a recent despatch the Government of India addressed the Secretary of State on the subject of the Turkish posts established in 1902 at Um Kasr on the mainland at the head of the Khor Abdulla and at A1 Geit on the island of Bubiyan. Both Um Kasr and Bubiyan are claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. It was pointed out that the shores of the Khor Abdulla provide what is probably the best and most probable terminus for the projected Baghdad Railway, that it was, therefore, necessary to secure our interests in this quarter, and that, though Mubarak’s pretensions to Um Kasr are not strong, his claims to Bubiyan island are good and sustainable. It was pro posed that either ( 1 ) the Porte should be informed that their right to maintain a station on Bubiyan cannot be recognised, and that we should simultaneously establish a post on behalf of Mubarak on the northern end of the island; or ( 2 ) that we should intimate that Bubiyan is regarded as belon^in^ to the Sheikh, and, unless the Turkish forcTl withdrawn, we shall be constrained to support him in establishing a post on the northern shore to balance the posts at Um Kasr and A1 Geit. On the 18th May, the Secretary of State telegraphed that Sir N. O’Conor had been authorised to complain to the Porte of the continued maintenance of a Turkish mili tary station on the south-east corner of the island and to press for its withdrawal, and that, if these representations remained for some time without effect, the active measures for supporting the authority of the Sheikh of Koweit recommended by the Indian Govern ment would be considered further. 13. Nejd .—It is stated that Ibn Rashid recently represented to the Porte that the successes of Abdul Aziz A1 Saud in Nejd and El Kassim were due to the secret support of a[ 5 ] Foreign Power, and if matters were allowed to remain as they were, El Hassa would be taken and Irak Arabi would be in danger; and that be was prepared to defray the cost of Turkish troops and artillery assisting him to re-take El Kassim and Nejd for the Turks. 14. Reports from Basrah state that on the 8th May 4,200 Turkish troops left Samawa, with 10 guns, to join the Amir. A letter was subsequently received by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from Bin Saud, through Sheikh Mobarak, protesting against the Turkish invasion, and begging for British protection for himself and his country. The matter was referred to the Secretary of State, with a suggestion that it might become necessary to appoint a Resident at Koweit and to abstain from interfering to prevent the importation of arms for Bin Saud. On the 25th May, the Secretary of State telegraphed that representations had been made by Sir N. O’Co nor to the Porte and had been renewed on hearing from the Vice-Consul at Jeddah, who had telegraphed that troops were being assembled at Medina in order to assist the Amir of Nejd. The Ambassador was of opinion that these representations might, perhaps, make the Sultan reluctant, but would hardly turn him from the course which he could fairly urge was calculated to prevent internal troubles and disturbance of the status quo. Sir Nicolas O’Conor did not see on what grounds he could press the Turks to desist from helping the Amir who was the party attacked without appearing as a distinct partisan of Bin Saud ; and pointed out that, on grounds of general policy, there were objections to preventing the Turks from assisting the Amir against Bin Saud whose apparent object is to re-establish the Wahabi dynasty throughout Central Arabia, the result of which might in the near future be fraught with serious con sequences and might imperil our authority at Koweit, where, in the existing condition of affairs, our influence is yearly growing stronger. Sir N. O’Conor’s idea was that we should confine ourselves for the present to maintaining int ct the territory of Koweit and awaiting developments, but that, if the Turks persisted, as he anticipated, in assisting the Amir, it might be expedient to reconsider the question of' appointing a Resident at Koweit. The Secretary of State asked for the views of the Government of India on the above questions, and enquired how, in view of our declared policy of prohibiting the traffic in arms, it was proposed to abstain from interfering with the importation of arms for Bin Saud. On the 29th, the Government of India replied, suggesting that SirN. O’Conor might point out that, so long as the Turks hadrefrained from interference in Nejd affairs, we also had abstained from intervention; that we have no desire to assist Bin Sand directly or indirectly; but that our interests in Eastern Arabia are such that we cannot view with indifference intervention on behalf of one of the parties contending for supremacy in Nejd, which must affect the tribes with which we have relations; that the relative rights of the two contending parties being so equal, the better course would be to leave both sides alone, both in the interests of peace, and with a view to the avoidance of internal troubles; that the Turks were unable in 1902 to prevent a filibustering expedition starting against Koweit from Turkish territory, and that the present support of Bin Rashid may strengthen him beyond Turkish powers of control, and produce a situation which, having regard to our relations with Mubarak, we could not view with indifference. As to Sir N. O’Conor’s view of the general political aspect of the situation, it was pointed out that the growth of our influence with Sheikh Mubarak had been concurrent with the success of his friend, Bin Saud, and our prestige at ICoweit must suffer materially if, through our active intervention to prevent Mubarak assist ing Bin Saud and to prevent importation of arms, we permitted Ottoman influence to deter mine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee against Bin Saud, which, on the analogy of the case of ElHassa in 1871, would probably mean the absorption of Nejd by the Turks. The natural result of Turkish supremacy in Nejd would be the destruction of Mubarak’s influence and a possible attack from a direction which had not hitherto been contemplated on Koweit territory, the limits of which towards the interior are not defined. We might thus be forced again to assist Mubarak actively against the Turks. The re-establishment of the Wahabi dynasty, which is now rather territorial than fanatical, would be open to less objection than this. The Government of India could not, therefore, agree that our authority at Koweit would be imperilled by the success of Bin Saud, or that we could preserve the integrity of Koweit territory better than by preventing Turkish intervention on behalf of Bin Rashid. It was added that the Government of India entirely agreed as to posting a Political Agent at Koweit, and would immediately select one, if the Secretary of State approved. As regards the importation of arms, it was pointed out that up to the present no arrangements had been made with the Porte for combined suppression of the traffic which was briskly proceeding. It was not, therefore, a case of authorising Mubarak to import arms or even of relaxing existing measures for the prevention of the trade, but merely of allowing matters to remain as they are. If the Turks protested, we could offerto do our best to suppress' the trade on the understanding that they would refrain from interfering in Nejd affairs, and co-operate with us in the manner suggested in our despatch, dated the 31st March 1903. The result of such a protest would he an admission of our supremacy in Koweit that would he useful to us hereafter. 15. Mohammerah. —On the night of the 16th April 1904, a gang of 30 Arabs attacked the “ Shushan ”. The same party of Arabs is reported to he robbing all round Dizful and Shuster, the roads are unsafe, and the S. S. “ Shushan ” will not run again until order has been restored. The authorities are help less, the few soldiers in the province being at Muzafferi in connection with the Beni Truf difficulties. 16. It is reported that Sadr-el-Atibba, a Persian doctor, says he has orders from the Minister for Poreign Affairs at Tehran to the Chief of Mohammerah for the construction of a new quarantine station. 17. Luristan. —On the 9th May, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran tele graphed that Burujird had been sacked hy the Lurs, and that the Prince Governor, who recently resumed the administration of Luris tan in defiance of the Shah’s orders to the contrary, would not allow any telegrams on the subject to reach the Persian Government {vide paragraph 17 of the Memorandum for April 1904). 18. Bushire. —On the 3rd May, the Governor of Bushire received a telegram from Tehran, stating that all Teyul (fief) properties in Persia had been cancelled and would be taken from the owners, the amounts originally paid by the latter being refunded in annual instalments. Among the places named in the telegram are the following :—Port of Chiroo, Kais Island, Hormuz, and Kishm. ' Mons. Brasseure, a Prench travelling Commercial Agent, who has been visiting the Persian Gulf for the last three years, has leased a house in Bushire with a view to opening a school for teaching Prench. He is said to have raised about Krans 30,000 by Bushire, Shiraz, and Isfahan. 20. The Director-General of Customs recently requested the Political Besident to instruct the Commander of the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamer “Kangra”, to deliver to him for seizure a quantity of arms and ammunition which were found in the baggage of a passenger bound for Koweit. The request was refused, and the Commander was directed to make over the arms and ammunition to the Chief of Koweit, who was addressed in the matter.21. Shiraz. —Mons. Ravet, the Director of the Post Office at Shiraz, has recently been busy in connection with the proposed improve ment of the road between Shiraz and Isfahan. If the improvement is carried out, the road will be fit for carriage traffic to within a short distance of Shiraz. 22. Fars .—It is reported from Tehran that Shua-es-Sultaneh, the Shah’s second son, has been appointed Governor-General of Pars. The appointment appears to be viewed with mixed feelings. The Mullas convened a meeting to protest against the appointment, but dispersed without coming to any definite resolution. 23. Bunder Abhas .—The recent murder of a woman and child on Kishm is reported to have caused some local excitement. A Customs employe was suspected, and about 100 men proceeded to Bunder Abbas to demand redress from the Customs Department, whose emissaries endeavoured to hush up the matter. 24. The neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas and Lar are in a disturbed state, and there are even rumours of attacks on Bunder Abbas. 25. Kerman. —Mr. Miller, the newly- appointed Russian Consul at Kerman, is reported to have left Kashan on the 2nd April 1904, accompanied by an escort of seven Russian Cossacks and by two Engineers, who are stated to be surveying the road from Tehran to Kerman. The local feeling against a Russian Consul living in Kerman is said to be strong. 26. Abu Mma and Tamb .—On the 24th May, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed that the Persian Government, while reserving its right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government our respective claims to Abu Musa and Tamb, had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the Persian flags and guards from the islands {vide paragraph 25 of the Memorandum for April 1904). TURKISH ARABIA. 27. FLedjaz .—Several complaints have lately been preferred to the Porte regarding robberies committed on pilgrims to the Hedjaz, and the raids committed by revolted Arabs on caravans. The Turkish Government, in response to a call from the Protector of the pilgrims at Mecca, is reported to have despatched four battalions of regular (Nizam) troops from Beyrout and Damascus to Medina via Yambo, and has sent orders to Baki Bey, a high official of the Grand Vizierate, to enquire into and report upon the causes of the recent disturbances, as well as the com plaints of the people against the Governor Osman Pacha and the Wali of the Hedjaz. The recent disorder is attributed in a greatmeasure to the notorious Kurdish Chieftain Moussa Bey who is in exile there. It is since reported that the claims of British Indian pilgrims have generally been satisfied by the local authorities. 28. It is stated in the Constantinople press that 480 kilometres (300 miles) of the Hedjaz Railway (vide paragraph 26 of the Memorandum for February 1904) have been completed, viz., 412 kilometres (257% miles) of the main or Mecca line, and 68 kilometres (42^ miles) of the Haifa-Mezerib branch. 29. 'With a despatch, dated the 6th April 1904, Sir N. O’Conor forwarded to the Foreign Office a recent plan of the proposed trace of the railway obtained from the Office of the Railway Commission. It appears r-— (a) that there is no proposal for a branch line from Maan to Akaha : (&amp;) that difficulties with the Arab tribes on the section between Medina and Mecca have prompted the proposal of two alterna tive lines, one direct and another making a detour westward touching the Red Sea coast at the Fort of Rabigh : (&lt;?) that a line is proposed from Jeddah to Mecca, which, if completed, will doubtless draw off much traffic from the main Damascus line. 30. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Adana gives the following detailed and precise information respecting the progress of the Konieh-Eregli section of the Baghdad railway (vide paragraph 23 of the Memorandum for March 1904). The route followed was from Tarsus to Eregli, Karaman, and Konia, and the return journey from Konia to Karaman, Mut, Gelefke, and Mersina. At present the work is to be carried only as far as Bulgurlu village, just beyond Eregli, and 200 kilometres from Konia. It is expected that this point will be reached by the end of September. After that, it is hoped that next spring a careful survey will be made with a view to continuing the line from Bulgurlu to Adana, and to some point on the coast between Ayas and Alexandretta; possibly at Ayas Bay itself, or even at Mersina, by means of the pre sent Adana-Mersina Railway. The line taken from Bulgurlu would probably follow the valley of the Chakit Su, passing by Ak Kupru. The officials while denying any knowledge of the continuation of the line, speak of it as the “ Baghdad line Ballast trains are now running to a point about 53 kilometres from Konia, and the rails are not laid beyond that point, but the work is being carried on the whole way to Eregli.TIBET. 31. On tbe 1st May, a reconnoitring party reported that they had located from 1,000 to 1,500 Tibetans in an entrenched position 43 miles from Gyantse on the far side of the Karo La. The enemy had opened fire, but had hit none of our men, who retired. In view of the threat involved to the line of communications with Phari, Colonel Brander considered it advisable to move out with a force of 300 rifles, and on the 6th successfully cleared the Tibetan force, which in the meantime had grown to one of 2,500 men, headed by influen tial Lhasa Lamas and officials. Our loss was 4 killed and 14 wounded, among the former being Captain Bethune. The enemy held a strong position and fought stubbornly. Their loss was not accurately ascertained. Their camp and baggage were captured ; a number of large tents, quantities of rations, gunpowder, and arms, and hundreds of maunds of blankets, cloaks, and clothing were burnt or destroyed. The new monk member of the Tibetan Council, who was previously supposed to be on his way to negotiate, was found actually to have been collecting troops at Nagartse. The column arrived back at Gyantse on the 9th May. 32. In the meantime, the Mission Camp at Gyantse had been attacked at dawn on the 5th May by a force of 700 Tibetans from Shigatse, commanded by a Lhasa General, and accompanied by clerks of the Dalai Lama and representatives of the Gaden Monastery. The attack, which lasted two hours, was repulsed with considerable loss to the enemy, who left 250 killed and wounded near the post. Our casualties were two wounded. General Ma, it was said, knew of the intended attack, but gave no warning. Captain Parr’s Chinese guards, who were in the town, were beaten, and his two Bbutia servants were brutally murdered, their limbs being hacked off one by one. Some Mission servants who were spending the night in the town were also murdered. It is believed that General Ma could have saved Captain Parr’s servants, but took no action. 33. The assault having failed, the enemy proceeded to maintain from the Jong hill, dis tant about 1,400 yards, an accurate fire with jingals and modern rifles to which our 7-pounders were unable to reply effectively. On the morning of the 8th, a large number of mounted reinforcements arrived from the Shigatse direction. The same day a reconnais sance in force was made to clear the surround ing country, and a small loss was inflicted on the enemy without casualties on our side. 34. On the 10th, Colonel Brander again reconnoitred the enemy’s position, and destroy ed a village threatening our right, but foundthe Jong at Gyantse too strong to be assaulted without additional artillery support. 35. On the 11th, further Tibetan reinforce ments arrived from the Rong valley, and on the J 3th and 14th more cannon and jin gals were mounted in the Jong. 36. On the 20th, a dak patrol of eight mounted infantry was ambuscaded and sur rounded near Gyantse, but eventually extricat ed with the loss of one killed and one wounded. 37. On the 22nd, a column was sent out to attack certain villages threatening the line of communications about 1^ miles south of Gyantse. Stubborn resistance was offered, and a Havildar and one sepoy were killed, and Lieutenant Hodson and three sepoys wounded. 38. On the 24th May, reinforcements consisting of 160 rifles and two 10-pounder guns reached Gyantse. 39. On the 26th May, the enemy having occupied Palla, a village 800 yards east of Jong and 1,100 yards from the post, and having begun to connect the village with the Jong by a vail, Colonel Brander moved out at 2-30 a.m. with four companies infantry, 4 guns, and ^ company sappers to attack the village. Breaches were effected in two places at 4 a.m., but the enemy’s resistance was most obstinate, and the village did not fall into our hands till 1-30 p.h. 40. Our casualties were as follows:—• Killed, Lieutenant Garstin, R.E., and three men; wounded, Captain O’Connor, R.A., in shoulder severe, Lieutenant Mitchell, 32nd Pioneers, in leg severe, Lieutenant Walker, R.E., slight, and also 9 men wounded whose degree of injury is not stated. By the occupation of Palla village the water-supply of the Jong has been completely cut, and it is hoped that it may be possible to resume more frequent mail services which have recently been suspended. 41. Telegraphing on the 16th from Gyantse, Colonel Brander reported that the garrison then had three months* supplies in hand. 42. As the result of the attack made on the Mission on the 5th May, it was proposed to the Secretary of State that some definite limit of time should be fixed, and that, unless proper representatives of the Chinese and Tibetan Governments with full powers to negotiate arrived at Gyantse within that time, a further advance should at once be made. On the 12th, the Secretary of State replied, sanctioning an advance to Lhasa, if the Tibetans would not consent to negotiate at Gyantse. 43. In accordance with instructions of the Secretary of State, Colonel Younghusband was instructed at once to give notice to theAmban that, after the date fixed for the advance, he would decline to negotiate at Gyantse. Colonel Younghusband replied that he had no means of communicating with the Amban, as any messenger sent by him would undoubtedly be murdered. In reply, it was suggested that he should send the notice with a covering letter to the Commander of the Tibetan forces, explaining the nature of the communication. Instructions were also sent that, in order that the Tibetans might be fully aware of the decision of the British Government, a letter should be written to the Dalai Lama in terms identical with those of the communication to the Amban. 44. In view of the expected advance to Lhasa, the following reinforcements are under orders for Tibet:—8 mountain guns, 4 com panies British Infantry, and 4 companies Native Infantry are due on the 8th June at Chumbi. In addition, sanction has been accorded to the move of half a battalion of British Infantry to Darjeeling in support, and it is also proposed to send half a battalion of Native Infantry to Chumbi. A third company of Mounted Infantry has also been ordered to Tibet. General Macdonald’s demands for transport have been fully complied with. 45. On the 8th May, it was decided that, owing to the attack on Gyantse and the serious opposition at Karo La, preponderance must be given to military considerations. General Macdonald was accordingly authorised to take all measures necessary to secure the safety of the Mission and its communications, and to exercise the same control of military operations and Press censorship as during the advance from Thuna until such time as active opposition should cease, and negotiations with properly accredited Chinese and Tibetan delegates should become possible. 46. Two further communications have reached Colonel Younghusband from the Amban {vide paragraph 40 of the Memorandum for April). In the first, dated the 23id April, the Resident explained that he had again urged the Dalai Lama to appoint suitable Tibetan representatives and to supply him with trans port in order that he might proceed to Gyantse to negotiate; delay, however, had arisen from the necessity of convoking an assembly of the clerical and lay representatives of the three great monasteries to discuss the question. In the second, dated the 29th April, the Amban wrote, with reference to Colonel Younghusband’s enquiry on the subject,that the Dalai Lama and the representatives of the three great monasteries denied any knowledge of monks having taken arms against the Mission. Their communication had given no reply, however, to the Amban’s request that Tibetan delegates should be appointed, and that he[ 13 ] t&gt; might be supplied with transport to enable him to proceed to Gyantse. ^ In reply to the Dalai Lama's request for help in men and money from the Emperor of China, the Amban is said to have told him that he must not expect any assistance from China. The Amban also hinted that the Dalai Lama was himself responsible for all that had occurred. 48. Information has been received by Colonel Youngbusband from a Chinese source that representatives of the three great Lhasa monasteries have represented to the Amban that the Dalai Lama has no power to ratify a treaty without their concurrence, and that the Amban might negotiate with the British, but the Tibetans would not have any thing to do with them. 49. Colonel Younghushand has received further friendly letters from the Deb Baja of Bhutan, and also from the Tongsa Penlop and Trimpuk Jongpen. The Tongsa Penlop also wrote on the 16th May to General Macdonald at Chumbi, saying that the Dalai Lama had sent a Lama messenger with a letter, request ing him to endeavour to bring about peace between the Tibetans and the English. The Tongsa Penlop offered his services as a mediator between the two Governments, and said he would start with the Lama messenger on the 28th May on a visit to General Macdonald. On receipt of this information, instructions were sent to Mr. Walsh that he should see the Tongsa Penlop, but should decline the latter's offer of mediation, telling him, however, that we should appreciate his services if he could impress on the Dalai Lama the folly and uselessness of resistance ; and requesting him to inform the Dalai Lama that the British Government have no desire to injure the Tibetans or their country, or to interfere with their religion, but that they insist on a settle ment of the long-standing differences. If the Dalai Lama failed to send properly accredited representatives to Gyantse before the day which had been notified to him, the British Government would no longer consent to negotiate there, but would send more troops to protect their Mission which would advance and compel negotiations at Lhasa. 50. A quantity of Bussian rifle and revolver ammunition was found at Karo La, but none of British manufacture. Various reports and rumours have also been received, suggesting that the Tibetans are receiving help from Bussia. A Tibetan informant announced that there were four white men in the Jong at Gyantse: a rumour originating in Bhutan declared that 1,000 Bussian troops in Tibetan clothes were at a place 150 to 200 miles north of Phari; while all the officers engaged[ 14 j It in the fight at Karo La are of opinion that the Tibetans had the aid, and probably the leadership, of men trained in European warfare. General Macdonald also reports that among the killed at Guru was a man with the arms, dress, and appearance of a Russian Mongolian Cossack. No clue was obtained as to his identity. In a letter, dated the 3rd May 1904, Mr. Poole informed the Foreign Office in London that he had received information from correspondents in Kansuh that 1,000 Buriats drilled and armed had passed by that way from Russian territory to Tibet. Reports from the Nepalese representative at Lhasa, however, contain no fresh evidence of Russian assistance. 51. Mr. Nichols, an American traveller, who has recently spent some time in Chinese. Tibetan territory, lately informed Mr. Litton that the most remarkable political feature in Ssuchuanese and Yunnanese Tibet is the weakening of the influence of the Chinese authorities, and the corresponding increase in the power of the Lhasa Government; that the intrigues of Russia had penetrated even to Wei Hsi ; that the British expedition had much excited the Tibetans in the country visited by Mr. Nichols; and that anti-English and anti-Chinese feeling was very strong, especially at Atentse. SIAM. 52. In a letter to the Marquess of Lans- downe, dated the 19th April 1904, regarding the view taken by the Siamese Government of the recent Anglo-French Agreement relating to Siam, Mr. Paget wrote that he gathered from a conversation with Prince Devawongse that fear, hatred, and distrust of France were more than ever predominant in Government circles in Bangkok, and that the news of the Anglo- French Agreement had been received wirh dis appointment inasmuch as it facilitates French aggression within their sphere. Mr. Paget understood His Royal Highness to hint that, although Siam had been obliged to acquiesce in French demands, the Siamese Government mean, whenever possible, to rob the concessions which have been wrung from them of all effect, and to resist French influence within and without the French sphere to the best of their ability. _ As regards Krat, Mr. Paget said that the position seemed to be that the Siamese Government had offered to hand over that port, if the French garrison would at once evacuate Chantabun. No reply had been received from the French Government. 53. A report received from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Chiengmai shows that 300 Shans from the east of the Mekong 0 &lt;I 15 J took possession of Chiengkliong on the 20th April 190The local Chief, after in vain urging them to withdraw, applied to the Erench authorities for assistance. The latter replied that they were unable to interfere. The Chief subsequently fled and took refuge with the French authorities. The Chief of Nan is said to have applied to the French Consul for permission to send an armed force to Chiengkhong (vide paragraph 56 of the Memorandum for April 1904). 54. In a note, dated the 29th March 1904, Sir E. Monson drew Mons. Delcasse’s attention to Article YII of the Franco-Siamese Treaty, dated the 13th February 1904, and pointed out that, if executed in its literal sense, it would involve the grant of a special privilege in favour of France throughout the region to which it applied, a part of which lay within the area guaranteed by the Anglo-French Declaration of 1896. Sir E. Monson asked for an assurance that the provisions did not affect any portion of the territory defined in paragraph 1 of the declaration (vide para graphs 49 to 55 of the Memorandum for April 1904).
