It is suggested that a more likely motivation for this action was to take control of the area in which Petroleum Concessions Ltd had been most interested.The Political Resident in the Gulf suggests that it would be a set-back for British interests if the Sultan were to lose ground in this area, and after a number of letters providing updates of the situation the correspondence ends with a letter from Major Hickinbotham informing that Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Regent and Minister for External Affairs, Muscat, had been contacted by Ali bin Said of Ainane, offering surrender of the strategically-important fort at Ainane to the Sultan on terms, in consequence of pressure from the Imam. The Regent proposed to discuss terms, an action which gained Major Hickinbotham's approval.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the front of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Ibri</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ainane</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dhahirah</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0003be#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
