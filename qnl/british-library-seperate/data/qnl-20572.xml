Enclosed with Kemball’s letter is a translation of a letter (folios 2v-3) from the British Agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim], dated 18 October 1853, informing Kemball that the vessel, having stopped off at Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] and being bound for Bahrain, was grounded in a storm on the Qatar coast. The inhabitants of Al Bidda subsequently seized twenty-seven bags of rice and a bag of coffee from the vessel’s cargo. Kemball writes that his request for compensation for the value of the cargo from Shaikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah] has ‘received ready attention’.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
