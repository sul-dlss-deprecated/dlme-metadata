His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the situation and they are of opinion that the most effective way of countering this threat will be the institution of a system of visa control similar to that which is now applied to the grant of exit visas from^Iran. I have therefore been instructed by His Majesty s ±rincipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to request Your Excellency to arrange that all applications for visas received by the Imperial Embassy in Kabul either direct or through the central authorities in Tehran should be referred to His Majesty’s Legation at Kabul before the visas are granted. Your Excellency will'realise that the situation which I have outlined calls for urgent action and I shall be grateful if you will inform me as soon as possible that appropriate instructions have been sent to the Imperial Embassy. t _' I avail etc., (signed^ R.W.

Tehran telegram No. 628 and Kabul telegrams Nos. 168 and 180 (the latter being a repetition of No. 142). I think possibly Sir F. Wylie is being a bit fussy. V/e have quite a satisfactory arrangement in Bagdad by which the Persian Embassy inform us of all visa applications for Persia and there is no doubt that in the case of travellers going from Afghanistan to Persia the authorities in Kabul are more likely to be able to throw light on their desirability or otherwise than the authorities in Tehran. The Persian Government has agreed to co-operate with us in security matters of this sort and all we want them to do is to keep us informed. I do not really see why they should consider this derogatory to their position. Perhaps the wording of Tehran telegram No. 628 in E 3286 has frightened Sir F. Wylie unnecessarily. Anyhow if his relations with the Persian Embassy are as good as he says the sooner he uses them to promote the war-effort the better. Afghani stan is a nest of German ag ent s whpse activities have come to our attention in Tehran on many occasions, e.g. they go down through Kerman to the Persian Gulf area and are in contact with undesirables in the Qashgai districts.

India agree with us that it is a physical impossibility for Indian Security Authorities in East Persia to control movements across Perso- Afghan frontier* In any event the natural flow of travellers would be along Herat-Meshed route with entry into Persia area which is a de facto Russian sphere-undesirable or suspects (?even) this information would not perhaps be of much valde, fo^ object in vie\v» In addition to this information I could' on occasion pass on information obtained by chance of journey to P/^rsia of Afghan or foreigner by route not requiring /i British visa 9 S* Arrangement with Persian Embassy for supply to me of information on this score would not seem to be in point* (?If) arrangement could be made? it could only be with approval of Persian Govt and m tnat even'u it would seem to be simpler for His Majesty f s Legation Tehran to get information itself straight from Persian Govt, In any case I doubt . whether Persian Embassy here grant visas for travellers to enter Persia without reference to Tehran. Y/ylie 180 23rd JuneThe boundary between Persia and Afghanistan is also the limit of the Minister of State’s sphere. While therefore he is not concerned with Afghan affairs, we can hardly object to his taking an interest in suspicious travellers who cross the frontier into Persia - though the real reason may be that 8.I.M.S. have time on their hands. It is rather surprising that Tehran should have suggested that the Indian security authorities in Sast Persia should control the frontier. It is a long frontier and though the roads are few enough it offers plenty of opportunity for the sort of travellers the Minister of State has in mind who are not particularly addicted to using roads when they wish to cross frontiers. In any case it is no use asking us whether this is possible. The suggestion that Sir F. Wylie should keep Tehran informed of all travellers leaving Afghanistan for Persia strikes ms as being rather unrealistic. There is no reason why the Afghans should tell Sir F. Wylie the names of those people to whom the?^ grant visas and though he will no doubt do his best to keep Tehran informed of any travellers of whom he hears, this check can hardly be an effective one. Subject to the views of the India Office, we might as a first step repeat this telegram to Kabul (it has already been repeated to Tehran) and follow up with a short telegram to both posts asking for their comments. This is essentially the sort of problem which must be settled on the spot. (Sgd.) I.T.M.PINK. 16th May, 1943 .[CYPHER] FROM MINISTER OF STA^.

(Please pass to New Delhi No. 70) ~L'T) sssss Tehran telegram No. 187 of May 12th. MOST SECRET In view of the presence of Axis Legations in Kabul and reports of the activities of their intelligence services, S.I.M.E. are anxious that movements of travellers between Afghanistan and Persia in both directions should be effectively controlled. 2. I understand that in June 1942 His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran requested Persian authorities to consult them before granting any exit visas for Turkey and Iraq but that since then arrangements have also been made for them to be consulted by the Persian police before e£Lt visas for Afghanistan are granted. There is however, no satisfactory control of travellers arriving from Afghanistan and it is desirable that His Majesty’s Legation at Kabul should if possible keep Tehran fully and lucidly informed of all such travellers. Could this be arranged? 3. Tehran have suggested that most effective step would be for Indian Security authorities in East Persia to control the frontier. I should be grateful to learn whether this is possible.
