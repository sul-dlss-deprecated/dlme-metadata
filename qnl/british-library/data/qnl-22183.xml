The news that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain had been made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire was received with deep satisfaction by the recipient himself, and with pride and gratification by other members of the A1 Khalifah. Defence Officer, Persian Gulf (i) Lieutenant-Colonel H.T. Hewitt, M.C., received ‘the news of his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on * New Years Day. (ii) Lieutenant-Colonel Hewitt’s designation was original ly 'Defence Officer, Persian Gulf”. This wps later changed to 'Town Major, Bahrain”. The new designation was subsequently abandoned in favour of the original one^ but a further change has recently ( been announced, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hewitt is now styled 'Garrison Commander, Bahrain'. Bahrain Government Hospital During November and December British Service per sonnel to the number of 66 were given treatment as in-patients in the Bahrain Government Hospital. Nearly half the c-^ses treated were of malaria. Food Supplies (i) The embargo placed by the Sind Government on the export of cereals to the Persian Gulf has shocked and puzzled His Highness the Shaikh, who cannot understand how a local authority is permitted to pass orders which nullify and confound arrangements made by the Government of India/ tie has confidence, however, that the British Government and the Government of India will put things right again with a minimum of delay. / (ii)(ii) Reference par^gr-ph 198 (ii) of Intelligence oumrrery No. 18 of 1942 in which~me*ntion was made of the 7835 tons of IvLE,.S.C. 'pool* oagar stored in Br.hrAin. 2000 tons of this sug' : -r is to he shipped to B^sr-s this month, and a further 2000 tons in February. (iii) A meeting of the Bahrain Food Committee-, presided over by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalif^h, v&gt;/ s held on January 12th e Bahrain’s food problems were discussed from every angle, and a number of important resolutions were p ssed. The substance of these resolutions was as follows (a) Rice. wheat ^nd flour . As the export of these commodi ties from Karachi, the principal source of supply, be d been prohibited, it was necessary to ensure that the smell stocks already in the Island were made to last ~s # long as possible. The ageregate rice + flour/whert ration was already so low that it could hardly be reduced further. But °s stocks of rice were likely to be exhausted some weeks before stocks of flour/wheat, the Committee decided th^t the rice ration should be reduced from 12 lbs to 8 lbs per adult per month, and that the flour/wheat ration should be increased by 4 lbs. There has been much grumbling in the past at the smallness of the rice ration of 12 lbs per month, and the Committee’s decision will be unpopular with local ;rabs, whose main article of diet is rice. The decision is, nevertheless^ 4 wise one, and is indicative of the realistic attitude wnich^ responsible people in Bahrain are at 1 st adopting in reg -rd to the food problem. (b) Sugar . As it has hot been possible to obtain^sugar from India for some months, and existing stocks are running 1c 4 , the Committee decided that the sugar ration of 4 lbs per ^dult per month should be reduced to B^lbs until such time as it was possible to obtain further supplies from India. (c) Dates . In the markets of Manama and Muharraq, and^in villages where there are no date palms, dates ^re unobt’.in- ole. It is^believed, however, that there are privately held stocks of dates which are being kept for release if and when the controlled price of dates is raised. The Committee were unable to suggest any remedial measure but hoped that if, as was expected, a substantial quantity of dates 'rrived from Kuwait, local hoarders would “then, in their own interests, put their stocks on the market. Economic The inhabitants of certain villages on the west cc^st^of the Island, who have no cultivable land but are dependent -or their livelihood on diving and weaving, are reported to be in a deplorable state of destitution. The Poor Relief Com mittee have been asked to give assistance in the more deserv ing cases. 3audi Arabian Affair s At the end of November an article was published in the newspaper ”A1 Bahrain” containing an appeal to the people .of Oatif to found a school there. This article, which was signed- 3 - by its p.uthor, All A1 Shaikh Mansur nl Marhun al ^^tifi, was, on the face of it, wholly unobjectionable. But Ibn S^ud, know ing the author's father to be an ardent 3hia propagandist, md suspecting a possible political motive behind the appeal, has summoned both father and son to Riyadh where they have been temporarily detained. 10. P .A.D. work at Awal i The most important items in the costly and comprehensive programme of P.A.D. works for the Refinery have been completed. Since the danger of attack from the air has now diminished, it has been decided to 'go slow” with the remaining portion of the programme. During the next few weeks only those works will be undertaken which do not require for their execution the import of further building material from Iraq. 11. The Bahrain Petroleum Company The Company are putting up four new two-storey bachelor quarters. Additional accommodation will be required if, as is hoped, married British employees of the Company are allowed to bring out their families from England to join them in Bahrain. Additional accommodation would also be necessary if certain projects to extend the Refinery were sanctioned. Material for the construction of these quarters was imported in 1940 and has been lying in storage since then. 12. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited The Company’s European and Indian staff were withdrawn from Qatar on 20th December 1942. Arrangements have been made to guard the Company’s houses at Dukhan, in which furniture and fittings have been left, but all other equipment, stores, etc. have been removed.- 13.

He had reached a point 40 miles south of Ojair when his truck broke down. On January 7th he returned to the main land with the intention of resuming his journey to Sharjah as soon as his transport difficulties were surmounted. He^reported that immature locusts were abundant, though dispersed, in are s south of Hofuf and Ojair. 14. Meteorological Maximum temperature ... 72.2 q on January 7th.

Bnhr^in - Politi cnl and Bconomic • ^ (i) Shortage of food has led to demonstrations in a number of villages, and signs of mcalnutrition are becoming increasingly apparent among children of the scorer classes of the community. The Bahraini's staple diet is fish, dates and rice. Fish is still obtainable in Bahrain, but there are no dates on the market and rice is expensive and strictly rationed. Tne island's annual date crop is only sufficient for four or five months' consumption, and, owing to export restrictions in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain's usual external sources of supply have been denied to her. Information has been received, however 4 that with effect from January 27th the Iraq Government have lifted their embargo on the export of dates to the Persian Gulf, and it should now be possible for Bahrain to obtain at least a portion of its requirements of dates. In regard to rice the outlook is black in the extreme. Bahrain has stocks of flee sufficient only for &amp; few weeks, and the news that India is uncable to export any more rice to the Persian Gulf has coMe as a stunning blow to everyone. Unless the British Government are able to bring supplies of rice or other cereals to Bahrain in the near future the population must starve. (ii) Stocks of sugar are running low and it has not been possible to obtain fresh supplies from India. An enterprising local merchant (Dhamanmal Isardas) is trying to obtain a ship ment of sugar from Mozambique, but it is feared that exchange control restrictions will render his efforts abortive. 24. Treq , 1 The nev/s that Iraq had declared v/ar on the Axis powers was cordially received in Bahrain, where it was taken, somewhat cynically perhaps, as evidence that Iraqis now regard ed their country as free from danger of invasion. It cannot oe said, however, that Iraq's declaration of war has had any considerable effect on local opinion, which looks for a lead to Ibn Saud rather than to Iraq or any other Arab country. 2- r . Saudi Arabia . Information has been received that the use of Indian currency notes on the mainland has been prohibited, and that they may no longer, even at a discount, be tendered in payment for goods. 26, Currency . The flow of Indian currency notes from Bahrain to Kuwait has been so continuous, and so great in volume, that it has become necessary to control it. In future Indian currency notes may not be exported from Bahrain to the value of more than Rs. 1000 at any one time without a special oer- mit. Permits will, of course, always be granted where the export of notes is required to finance any bona fide trade transaction. 2V. Petroleum Concessions Ltd . The Company is having an argument with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi about the interpretation of a clause in the Oil Agreement which is capable of being recad in two ways. The Shaikh claims that ne is entitled to payment of a sum of Rs. 1,25,000 in January 1943 while the Company admit his right to Rs. 1,00,000 only. The argument has been conducted without acerbity on either side. 28. Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd . Reference para 255 of Intelligence Summary No.22 of 1942 in which it was reported that the services of Dr. / DhnniDhnmi, the Qntar Oil Compnny’s Sikh doctor, would orcb^bly be placed at the disposal of the Shaikh of Qatar. The Shaikh and Dr. Dhami were unable to come to terms, and Dr. Dhami has now accepted an offer of employment bv the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. Dr. Dhami will replace another Sikh doctor, B.S. Chov/dhury by name, who has been a constant source of irritation both to the Company and to the Political hgent, but whom it was not possible earlier to replace. Special Police at Awali. .. . r. it } Q European personnel borrowed from Provincial - olice Services in India for special defence duties at /wali are returning to Indies on the expiry of their respective terms of deputation. Their duties will in future be perforra- _ed by a Warrant Officer and four N.C.O.s of the Corps of imilitary Police, who are bein,^ transferred from Iran for the purpose. 1 War Funds . (i) Contributions to the Bahrain War Fund since the be^inninr; of the War have now reached a total of more than £ 10,000. From this Fund periodical remittances are made to the Imperial War Fund and to various British and American War Charities. (ii) The Persian Gulf Fighter Fund has benefitted to the extent of Ps 14,066/14/- as the result of a theatrical per- formanee staged by members of the Indian community in Bahrain, ilembers of the public were very /renerous in paying lar/iG prices for special seats.

A further 2000 tons is on order. The price of dates in Basrah, already very high, is reported to have risen by 20 * during the last fortnight, presumably as a result oi one heavy demano from Bahrain andother Gulf Shaikhdoms. (iii) General :- Cereals are rationed stringently and the price of uates, although controller., is so high that poor people can only attord to buy them in small quantities. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the standard of health among the poorer classes of the community :s deteriorating rapidly. The old' and irail have been the first tc suffer - and the State Medical Officer has already reported a number of deaths among old people caused pri marily by malnutrition. Children of the poorer classes are also showing the effects of un&lt; ei-nourishment, A further indication of 4 .the the decline in^/economic w If are of the community is the steadily rising number of thefts arc! ourglaries reported to the police. Local resources have been utilised to the utmost - but local resources, so far as foodstuffs are concerned, are limited to dates and fish and a negligible quantity of wheat. The whole of the date crop has been kei for human consumption, though in normal years dates are fed in large quantities to transport animals. A result of this diversion of food from animals to human beings is that donkeys also are suffering hardship. Not only have donkeys oeen deprived of their normal nourishing food but, owing to the ever-increasing shortage of motor transport, they have had to carry heavier burdens for longer lours$ and many of them are breaking down. ^ILe position in repaid to fish is that demand exceeds supply. To satisfy the increased oerand it is necessary for fishermen to fish by night as well as t y day - and this they cannot do without an additional meal of datos, which they cannot' afford to buy. Relief Committees j .av e been established which distribute food to specially deserving cases, and regional centres have been opened at v/hich dates are sold by the Bahrain Government at cost price. These /-2 a?) conairiP^M» eS are tem g orf,r y palliatives which have achieved a consiaerable measure of success; but radical relief Pan secured when essential foodstuffs - ricej wheat or flour and 45.

That feeling 0 t&gt;a U n reS ^- 1S £ 0 ^_ i lessene ^ by ffre circumstance that their American cind Canadian fellow employees are still able to take home leave; «na it is vastly aggravated by recent experience in regard to mails. vVhereas mail from the American continent arrives with reasonable speed and regularity, letters from the British Isles intervals after delays of many months. Many ^xitish employees of the Oil Company - like other British resi- uenv.s oi Bahrain - have had no letters from England for three, our or even six months though they have correspondents who write regularly oy air mail every week. This absence of contact with amilies and friends at home has on British employees of the Com-* pany an unsettling effect which the enervating climate of Bahrain renuers all the more insidious and demoralising. 52 • C alifornia Arabian Standard Oil Company Indian employees of the Company, though they are not sub ject to industrial conscription, have for several weeks been show- ing signs of discontent. After having decided to stage a strike as a preliminary to presenting their demands to the Company’s management they learned that strikes are illegal in Saudi Arabia ana that they would be arrested and put in gaol if they carried ^ out their intention. Nineteen of them therefore presented their demands without lirst going on strike. The demands, which relat ed to every aspect of the conditions of their employment, were couched in what the Company regarded as belligerent and offensive language; and the Management refused tofoondider the petition unless it were rewritten in more temperate words. / a typical the petition is !- ’'He was a true American who the cuher day so appropriately described this our bunkhouse as Cooly Bunkhouse No• 17”__/ • The employees concerned refused to rewrite their petition; and, in protest against its rejection, resigned ' . ?.n a body.

A few villagers of Dhadnah, who had been able to get hold of some pairs of trousers, at once put them on and returned home.

In order to eke out the rapidly dwindling supplies of rice in the island the public wore also permitted to purchase wheat in lieu of the more expensive nee ration. Full advantage was taken of this concession . and poor people were enabled to buy, for the first ^eeks, their iulir^i^nof cereals. All stocks island are held by the Bahrain Governuent, and it is on them that the cost of making this concession falls. time for many of wheat in the The fine, white Australian flour which arrived on March 3rd cannot be used for making ’’khubz”, the kind of bread eaten locally. It was iound, however, as a result of experiment, that excellent Khubz” can t&gt;« made from this flour if it is mixed in equal proportions with coarsely ground wheat. There is, how ever, only one mill in Bahrain and the owner refused to grind wheat for less than the grossly excessive charge of Fs 5/- per bag The Bahrain Government, therefore, in the public interest, took over the mill by executive order, and are now milling wheat to mix with the white flour. The resulting compound is being sold to the public at the concession rate of 3 annas per lb.

Opinion about the War Mr. Churchill's speech, with its salutary reminder that the end of the war was not y-.-t in sight, created a deep impres sion among all communities in Bahrain. Deveral employees of the Bn hr-' in P- tr oleum Company, who Fr d r of r in ad from V-kihg leave in the* hope that the war would end by the autumn and that they could then take leave at home, have- changed their minds and have asked to take leave now in South Africa.

His movements were therefore only local. 83. Visitors (i) Mr. Alexander Kirk, United States Minister to Egypt, arrived in Bahrain by air on April 6th and crossed to the mainland the same day en route to Riyadh. He returned to Bahrain on April 12th and, after spending the night at Awali as the guest of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, left for Cairo by air the following da#. (ii) Mr. Chaplin, Second Secretary, H.M f s Embassy, Baghdad, and Mr. Fritzlan, United Spates Vice-Consul in Basrah, arrived in Bahrain by H.T. ’‘Resang* 1 on the morning of April 7th and left in the afternoon of the same day. 84. Food Supplies (i) Cereals , The final shipment of rice from Calcutta, which has been anxiously awaited for many w G eks, arrived on April 1st. After deduction of%Saudi Arabians share of the consignment, less than 5000 bags (sufficient for three weeks) remained for local con sumption. A shipment of wheat also arrived during the period under report, and it is hoped that by the end of the month stocks of cereals will be sufficient to enable the pearling fleet to pro vision itself for the season's operations. (ii) Dates . One or two boatloads of dates arrived from Basrah during the period under report, but weather conditions continued to be unfavourable and it has not yet been possible to accumulate stocks of dates sufficient in quantity to meet the requirements of the pearling fleet. 85• American interests 'The rich Bahrain Islands, which dominate the Persian Gulf, have been occupied by America'.

(Ill) Food distribution. It has tMccn many months of patient work to organize an efficient system of food distribution through out the island. The system is now working smoothly, but local arrangements have continually to be adjusted to meet local needs. For instance, there is a general migration at the beginning of the summer from towns and certain villages to coastal areas (a migration which was accelerated last year by fo*r of ^ir raids - vide paragraph 61 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No. 8 of 1942), and it has been necessary to transfer the names of large numbers of ration-card holders from one r supply area 1 to another one. Adjustment in the existing organization has also been rendered necessary in Manama, where it has boon found that the issue of rations on a weekly or fortnightly basis does not meet the needs of very poor people who can only afford to purchase rations for a day or two at a time. Five shops have therefore been selected at which rations will bo issued on a daily basis only. 92A'b - 2 - 92 • Iho Poaplla^ . , .Ouj'inj! tha last faw days of April paarling craft h»va bamin - th ?.P^' rlln S banks.

He left after a stay of a week during which he discussed with the Political Agent a number of local issues. (iii) Shaikh Abdul Rahman al Tubaishi, King Ibn Saud f s Chamberlain, has arrived in Bahrain, bringing a sick relative for medical treatment.

(i) The Political Agent was convalescent throughout the period under report, recovering from the effects of the medical treatment which he was given for dysentery during the previous month. (ii) Captain Tandy, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, has been admitted to the R.A.F.

O^onovan, Master of T,V. ,, Athelmonarch ,, t ^ was brought ashore on the 12th May with a gunshot wound in the head. From the inquest held by the Assistant Political Agent it seems that the wound was self-inflicted. Captain O 1 Donovan died on the day of his arrival here and was buried at the Roman Catholic cemetery. IQO. Bahrain Government Hospital During April British Service personnel to the number of 21 were treated as in-patients in the Bahrain Government Hospital. Amoebic dysentery was the commonest complaint. 10I.Ty%hj&amp;ft This disease is prevalent in Iraq and Persia, and Dr. Steele, in his capacity of Port health Officer, is taking ener getic action to ensure that infested lice ere not introduced into Bahrain on the persons of passengers or crew from down- Gulf steamers and dhows • It is said that typhus-oarryiag lice do not survive long in high temperatures, and there Is reason to hope, therefore, that Bahrain will be spared this par ticular form of infestation.— 2 — ( ft) # 102* Bconopic Ccadit|&gt;ons The SecretajTy of the Muharraq Municipality has reported that in the four months January to April over Fs 1000/- has been spent by tha Municipality in providing winding sheets for pauper burials. This ie approximately three times the normal expenditure The increase is believed by the Municipality to be due to 'more paupers, mere deaths and dearer winding sheets'. 103. Bahrain Cen s us and Food Rationing It las been mentioned in previous Intelligence Summaries how useful the census taken in January 1941 has proved as a basis for the organization of a system of food rationing throughout the island. Comparison of census figures with ration card registers shows that the census was remarkably complete and accurate in regard to the total number of the population of Bahrain; but there is a very great discrepancy in the division of the popula tion into adults and infants. In 1941 a disproportionately large section of the population was entered as infants; in the ration card registers of 1943 a disproportionately large section has been entered as adults. The explanation is simple. In 1941 it was generally believed that the census was being undertaken as a preliminary to compulsory recruitment for military service, and a great many adults were deliberately and dishonestly report ed to be infants. In 1943, since children under 12 years of age are only entitled to half the authorised food ration, exactly the reverse has happened, and many children under 12 years of age have been registered as adults. 104• Bahrain Po lice » On the night of May 5th eight members of the police force stationed at the Manama Fort refused to go on duty as a protest against the Bahrain Government 1 s decision not to grant them a 'war allowance' such as has been given to other local Government employees to enable them to meet the increased cost^ of living. On the morning of May 6th another 40 or 45 men at the Fort handed in their uniforms and resigned from the Police service* The places of those who had resigned were at once filled by transfers of personnel from the locally recruited H.A.F*Levies, whose strength is in excess of current requirements. Thereafter no further trouble was experienced. The Bahrain Police are well paid and exceptionally well fed, and the unfortunate incident was caused by a stupid mis take on tha part of the Adviser's Secretary. The rates of the war allowance granted to Bahrain Government employees who are not in receipt of free rations have recently been revised, and the police clerk at the Fort inquired from the Adviser's Sec retary whether police personnel would be entitled to the allowance at the revised rates. The Adviser's Secretary, in a moment of inexplicable aberration, replied in the affirmative. The police at the Fort (though not at other stations) were therefore led to expect an increase in psy, nnd when, on pay day, this increase did not materialise, the reaction caused by their disappointment was extreme» Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to the Shaikh of Bahrain, who is Commandant of the State Police Force, and has built it up and nurtured it with loving care, was deeply distressed at the attitude adopted by so many of his men. He discovered (to quote a character from Thackeray) 'How sharper than a thankless tooth It is to have a serpent child'. 105. Tunisian V i ctorv ! Th' success of Allied arms in North Africa has made a tremendou impression on the Shaikhs and people of Bahrain.&amp; - 3 - His Highness Shaikh Salman was also deeply impressed by the dignity, sincerity and simplicity both of His Majesty the King*s message to Mr. Winston Churchill and of the latter's reply. This exchange of messages on a historic occasion appealed to Shaikh Salman as being perfectly expressive of the relations which should ideally exisn between a great King and his trusted Prime Minister, 106. Bahrain Petroleum Company The General Manager of the iUiglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan recently addressed a circular to British employees saying that he had been trying to arrange passages for persons desiring to take leave in the United Kingdom, and asked addressees to put in their claims so that a 'Priority List' might be prepared. He took care to state that passages had not yet been officially authorised, and that applications were only being invited so that, if a few passages were authorised at some time in the future, there would be no delay in taking advantage of the concession. British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company soon heard about this circular, and the rumour went round that A.I, ).C. employees were being allowed home leave. Excitement was uncontrolled and jealousy intense. Steps were taken, as soon as the real contents of the A.I.O.C. circular had been ascertained, to give publicity to the true facts; and indignant visitors to the Political Agent were told that, though no A.I/J.C. personnel had yet been allowed home leave, he sincere .y hoped they would be since this would strengthen the cla m of BAPCO personnel. The excitement has now died down, bit the temporary stir is an index of the intensity of feeding which canbe generated on this subject if employees feel that they are not being given a square deal. It will not bpossible to 'hold down' British employees, who are already jealous of the leave facili ties enjoyed by Americans and Canadians, if they are not given treatment at least equally favourab .e to that accorded to A.I.O.C. employees. 107.

The offenders are being marched from place to place and paraded in chains, with their faces blackened, and bearing a placard explaining uhe nature of their crimes.

The Shaikh, who fired one of the guns himself, was impressed by the smartness of the gun crews and was also gratified at the excellent performance of the guns which fired at targets ranging from 2000 to 8000 yards; The Shaikh's only regret was that no photographer was present to obtain a pictorial record of his firing of the gun, 116, Bahrain Petroleum Company (i) Information has been received that a long-discussed project for the extension of the Bahrain Refinery has been given final sanction, and construction work is expected to begin in September. Between 300 and 500 American Construction experts will be engaged on the work and employment will be given to some 2000 or more Bahrainis. (ii) Mr, Ward P.

Suspension of Exploratory Work by Oil Companies The Iraq Press has given publicity to the agreement reached by the Iraq Government with the Mosul Petroleum Company Limited and the Basrah Petroleum Company Limited. Under this agreement the Iraq Government is to be given by the Companies a loan of I*D, 1,500,000 free of interest in consideration of the government’s allowing the Companies to suspend exploratory work until two years after the cessation of hostilities. The loan is to be repaid out of royalties accruing when exploration work has been resumed. If the terms of this agreement come to the notice of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar (as they almost certainly will) the interests of the Oil Companies operating in their respective territories are likely to be adversely affected, 118.

Ke made a forced landing, in a raging dust storm, on the C.A.S.C.C’s new aerodrome at Dhahran. He took off again to return to Bahrain, but on the way an engine cut out and he wps only just able to make the Bahrain aerodrome. 123 • Dales ,- Only six weeks now remain before the new date season. The stock of dates in the Island is sufficient to meet require ments during this period, and the coming date crop shows oromise of being an excellent one# 124# Pearling .- The price of pearls remains very high, and optimism continues in spite of the fact that the harvest of pearls has so far been meagre owing to the prevalence of a high wind causing difficult diving conditions* 125# Saudi Arabia (i) Reference paragraph 112 Of Intelligence Summary No. 10 of 1943 in which it was reported that the Saudi Government wore at last taking energetic action to prevent the illicit export of foodstuffs. Steps to enforce the embargo on the export of gold have also been taken, and Saudi subjects are unable to leave the country without permission from the local Amir. Recently the Police at A1 Khobar received information that two Saudi nationalstrrveiling to Bf»hr^in in the Oil Comprny's launch hnd trken out some sovoroigns with them. As the Snudi 'lovornment Customs laun ch was not available, the Saudi Police borrowed another launch from tho Oil Company, pursued tho first launch, caught it up, and removed tho two smugglers with their gold. It is not known what punishment was inflicted on tho culprits# (ii) A few weeks ago Shaikh Abdul Rahman al Tubaiahi, Ibn .Baud’s Chief Chamberlain* brought his wife to Bahrain for medical treatment# Included in the party was a young lady, heavily veiled, who was treated with considerable respect, but was*never addressed or referred to by name. It is nov/ generally believed that the young lady was an unmarried daughter of Ibn Baud’s whom her father allowed to accompany his trusted Chamberlain to Bah rain on condition that her identity was kept strictly secret# This story is rendered the more plausible by the fact that the party brought over to Bahrain one of Ibn Baud 1 s private cars which Abdul Rahman al Tubaishi would hardly have been lent solely for his own use, (iii) Dr. Harrison, of the American Mission Hospital, has for a long time been trying to obtain permission from Ibn Baud to establish r Hospital at Hasa. At recent visits to Riyadh doctors from the American Mission have been so favourably received th^t Dr. Harrison thought the time was ripe for the fulfilment of his ambition, and he was able to persuade Bin Jaluwi, tho Gover nor of Hasa, to write to the King recommending most strongly that permission bo granted for tho establishment or a Mission Hospital at Kofuf (HnsaJ# It is understood that Ibn Baud’s advisers gave expression to different opinions about the advisability of open ing a hospital* but eventually conservative views prevailed,*and Ibn Baud has written to Dr. Harrison informing him that it is at present impossible for a hospital to be opened at Hasa.# 126# Typhus Referonce paragraph 101 of Intelligence Summary No. 9 of 1943. One case of typhus has occurred in Bahrain. The patient wa.s a Persian who had come in a dhow from Bandar Big. Symptoms of the disease only became apparent after he had been in*Bahrain for some days. 127# Bahrain Government Hospital During tho month of May British Service personnel to the number of 34 wore treated as in-patients at tho Bahrain Govern ment Hospital. Sixteen of the patients wore not actually serving in Bahrain but were brought here from other stations for medical treatment. 128.

United Nations Day Stimulated by the infectious enthusiasm of Mr. Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer in the Persian Gulf, all commu nities in Bahrain combined to celebrate with eclat June 14th, United Nations Day. Flags of the United Nations (including, optimistically, the Turkish flag) decorated the scene of public and private parties or entertainments, and a special broadcast from /-y) 3 from the Brhrp.in B^dio Stption brought home to its listeners the spocinl significance of the occasion. Festivities included * yp.cht rr.ee r.nd other sporting events of which the most popular was a hugely attended football match between Manama and Muharraq, the two principal towns in the Island. In the evening a public cinema performance was staged and the Political Agent also gave a party a.t which films were shown. The party at the Agency was attended by His Highness the Shaikh, by leading members of the Buling Family and by all the principal merchants and notables of Bahrain - Arab, Persian and Bahrani. 130. lie teorpJ.ogc a^ Maximum temperature ••• 92.1° on Juno 14th. ^ Minimum temperature ... 70.0° on June 7th.

The Political Agent, accompanied by Bouadron Leader Chase (Air Liaison Officer) and Mr* Bertram Thomas (Public Relations Officer, Persian Gulf) called on the Amirs at the Shaikh's Palace shortly after their arrival. The two Amirs, Shaikh Abdullah Suleiman, the doctor and four servants left Bahrain for Karachi at 6.0 a.m* on June 13th in a Lodestar aircraft provided by the R*A.F. At their departure a Guard of Honour composed of R.A.F. Levies was drawn up on the aerodrome, and a large number of people including His Highness the Shaikh, the Political Agent and leading members of the Al Khrlifah, were present to see them off. Signals received by the Air Liaison Officer from time to time during the day made it possible to inform His Highness the Shaikh of the safe arrival of the party, first at Sharjah and, later, at Karachi. The whole journey, from Bahrain to Bombay, was performed without mishap of any kind though, during the last forty minutes of the flight, mon soon conditions were encountered and the aircraft had to fly very low, (v) On Juno 22nd one of His Majesty Kin-?

He is visiting Cairo for change of air ,J . (ii) Bhaikh Mohamed bin Ali al Khalifah died on June 21st. He was a brother-in-law of the late Baler cf Bahrain , Shaikh Hamad, and was a Magistrate of the Bahrain Junior Joint Court. 136 • Gold .and Saudi Arabic. Reference paragraph 125(i) of Intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1943 in which it was reported that the Saudi Government '..ere taking steps to enforce the embargo on the export cf gold. It is estimated that 'full gw era' of the Amirs Mohamed and Mansur brought across for sale in Bahrain between 5,000 and 10,000 sovereigns. 137. Pearling Competition among Bahrain pearl merchants to purchase pearls as they are brought in has kept the local price at a high level* In India prices have somewhat declined, and the price of pearls in Bahrain is now 15B to 20? higher than it is in Bombay. The price of pearls in Bahrain is approximately twice what it was at the corresponding period of the 1942 season. The expense of pro visioning diving boats is also, of course, very much higher than it was last year, and divers r profits are not expected to be large. 138. Bccnomic (i) Cereals :-3tocks are temporarily adequate.2 (ii) Tea Stocks of tea are exhausted as shipments expected from India have net arrived. (iii) Pio c egccd s The following is an extract from a report recently received by the Political Agent from Mr. Belar'Ve, Adviser tc the Bahrein Government ,? In the Bahrain villages today numbers of men wear nothing but old s« cks on. women both m tewno rnu vill^f^es -.Mre in many cases compelled to keep to their houses because the clothes that they have are hot sufficient to cover their buuies. In the wown of Hedd, which in recent years has become a pverty stricken place owing to the recline in the diving, industry, the attendance of students at the Girls* Schcwl decreased noticeably during the last few months. When the re-son for the decline in numbers was investigated it was found that many children could not conu to school because their clothes would not cover them decently. For the same reason, but tc a lesser extent, there was a decrease in attendance at some of the other Girls* Schools The ’ schools /-■schools cremised a fund for buying chcpp mpteripl to clotho m?.ny of the students from poor homos to enable them to con tinue attendinr schools► Daily in the Orderly Room at the Fort I r.m asked by Policemen t who are comparatively well paid, to help them to buy cheap cotton goods to clothe their families who, they say, cannot go' out because they have nothing but rags to wear* During recent months I have myself seen both men and women, con gregated at the village ration shops, whose clothes consist of old rags which are scarcely sufficient to cover their nakedness* The reason for this state cf things is not always that the people have not the money to buy clothes . In many cases they would buy the material if it was available.' This distressing state of affairs is caused primarily by the recent drastic reduction in the quantity of cotton piecegoods imported from India. A contributory cause has also been speculation in piecegoods by retail merchants, who have been buying and selling to each other. In order to control effectively the price of the cheaper, essential qualities of piecegoods, the Political Agent issued an Order on June 23rd limiting the profit which wholesale and retail merchants may make cn such goods and forbidding retail merchants to sell to any cne except the consumer. The Bahrain Government will also take ever from importers, for resale to the poor at a concession price, one-third of all imports cf such goods. It is obvious that, unless stocks of cheap cotton cloth can be built up during the next few months, mortality among the poor will be very high during the winter months when under-nourished bodies, without the protection of clothing, will be wholly unable to withstand the cold. 139* Bahrain Government Hospital Durinr the month of June British Service personnel to the number cf 32 were treated as in-patients at the Bahrain Government Hospital. Of these half were serving in Bahrain and half were brought in from outside. 140.

This total was made up of aircraft of no less than eight diffe rent types. The aerodrome is, however, still unsuitable for use by the heaviest forms of air transport as the ground is not uni formly firm throughout the whole area, 148, Local Affairs (i) In paragraph 135(i) of Intelligenco Summary No. 12 of 1943 it was reported that Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa al Khaiifah, uncle of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, had loft for Cairo for f, a change of air”. He arrived at his destination on July 13th and sent telegrams announcing his arrival to members of his family in Bahrain. The fact thAt one of these tsls.gr ms w--s -ddr^ssed to his nephew a a “His Majesty SI Shaikh Salman al Kclifa” and another to his brother as ,f His Highness El She ikh Abdulla al Kalifa* 1 seems to indicate that Shaikh Mohammad is finding Cairene air somewhat heady.(ii) The d^f-t»h of Shaikh Moh^mod bin All f1 Khslifeh was report ed in the last Bahrain Intelligence Summary. His place on the Bench of the Bahrain Junior Joint Court has been taken by Sh-ikh Ali bin Khalifah bin Daij, who has hitherto been President of the Majlis ul Tajara* The new President of the Majlis ul Tajara is Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad, a brother of the Bulcr of Bahrain who was for some years a Magistrate on the Bench of the Senior Bahrain Court. 149.

(ii) The Amir of Hasa (Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi) has written to the Hulers of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms askiag them to warn their subjects not to come to Hasa to buy dates as none are available for sale. If they do come, he adds, they will only waste their own time and that of Saudi Government officials. 150.

Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., the principal Bahrain Shipping Agents, wore warned several weeks ago by the Bahrain Petroleum Company that 18,000 tons of material required for the proposed K^finary Extension would bo discharged at Bahrain over a period of seven months beginning from October next. They have now been asked to be prepared to unload 40,000 tons of material in the reduced period of four months. It will be necessary for them, if they are to bo able to carry out such a heavy unloading programme, to recall from Basrah a number of lighters v/hich have been hired to the I.V/.T. there. (ii) Mr. Hillman, the American Engineer in charge of construc tion work in the Hefinery Extension, Left Bahrain for Cairo an route to Asmara on July. 14th. At Asmara he hopes to recruit American labour for the new project. (ill) An opportunity occurred at the beginning of the month for a number of British employees of the Company to travel home to the United Kingdom for leave* Unfortunately intimation of this opportunity, which is the first which has occurred for over three years, was received too late for advantage to be taken of it.

For three years no British onployoo of the Company has bean able to take homo leave, and, until very recently, there seemed to bo no hope of leave prospects improvin'. Now, how ever, there appears to be a chance of a few inon nottin? hone on leave almost immediately and the reaction from the formerly existin' state of neurotic &gt;:loom has been tremendous. During tho last fifteen months the Political Ayunt has given inter views to a Ion; succession of men, weary, restless and depressed. The same men now, though they may not thornselves be among the few who are scheduled for home leave in the near future, fool that the clouds are lifting and that the and of tho long period of hopeless waiting is at hand.

People, walking, loft a trail of wetness behind as if they had just emerged from the sea. Birds took refuge in the shade of trees or house-verandahs, and stayed there, gaping, too exhausted to search for food for themselves or their hungry nestlings. Residents of Manama who could by any means make their way to the Ardhari Pool did so, and plungod into the water there. From Hedd crowds waded out through the hot sea to the cool sub marine springs a little distance away. The temperature inside the Refinery was 130°. Conditions wore, indeed, so extraordinary — even for Bahrain -- that people did not complain* they greeted each othv^r with smiling sympathy as do people who meet under the shadow of some great and common calamity whose effects are yet known to be short-lived.

Ec onomic (i) For seme days during the early part of the period under report no meat wrs to be had in the Bahrain bazaars. This was due to cornering of the market by the contractors of the Army, Navy and R.A.F. and of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Steps have been taken to ensure that this does mot occur again, A contributory cause has been a falling-off in the rate of imports of livestock from neighbouring countries. The latter has also - been one of the reasons for a recent increase in the price of milk from As. 3f to As. 4 per lb. Another cause of this has been the rise in the price of date stones imported from Iraq, which are almost the only form of nourishment available for Bahrain cows and which new cost fts 7 per raaund* (ii)/-169/- (it) On July 28th p. Persian bop.t left --.salu, a village lying on the coast of Persia between Bush ire and Lingeh, bringing 400 goats to Bahrain. Owing to calm weather the journey to Bahrairv took 11 days. The nakhuda had provisioned himself with neither t ;raas nor water for the goats and as a result only ten cf them reached B&amp;hfcdin alive on hugust 6th. Of these, two died that evening after their sale in Bahrain. 165« Ohortane cf sma1 1 coin s There is again an acute shortage of small coins in Bahrain. On August 1st an Order was published by the Political Agent pro hibiting the hoarding of small coins ^nd providing for the^punish ment of offenders^ a similar Order was passed by the Bahrain Government. Pett&gt;y shopkeepers are believe i to have been hoarding up small coins, though searches of a #few cf^their shops by^the Bahrain Police have not as yet brought anything to light. The chief culprits, however, are the tswashes, v/ho go cut to the pearling banks to buy pearls, and diving-crews, who have been taking with them coins for eventual sale in °atif at a 20 per cent profit. They have now been forbidden to take out more than B$ 5 worth at a time. 166* Pearls Many rumours are in circulation both in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast that the Government of India have placed restrict tions on the import cf pearls. It is said that no imports from the Trucial Coast are to be allowed at all and that imports from Bahrain are only to be allowed on production of a 'permit” from this Agency. A merchant is rumoured to have recently been fined for bringing pearls into India from Bahrain without having first produced the necessary permit. This scare has caused a reduction of upwards of 20B in the price of pearls in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast, and it is commonly suspected here that it was engineered by the pearl merchants themselves in order t o bring down the buying price of pearls. This suspicion is streng th one d by the fact that, although the pearl merchants have been informed that if they are anxious about the situation in India or have received definite news about the 3?ds trie tions on the import of pearls there, they should cc me and see the Political Agent so that he may make official enouirics from India, none of them has dene so, 167.

It was noted in that Summary that the figures recorded by the Bahrain Balloon Observatory on that par ticular day were not remarkable, and subsequent enquiries shew that the figures published in theaeSummaries may not have given an altogether adequate idea cf the'rigours of the Bahrain climate. In the first place, the Balloon Observatory, from Whi 0 hthey/wl&amp;£$ derived, is situated at some distance from the Centre of Manama , where conditions are at their worst. In the second, the percentages of humidity recorded by the Balloon Observatory are not maximum percentages but those registered at 7.30 a.m., by which time the sun has risen high in the heavens and dispelled a considerable quantity of the moisture in the air. The maximum humidity occurs at about 4 a.ra#, when the temperature is at its minimum, and at that hour in Bahrain it is seldom, if ever, below 90%? on August 9th it was 100£ f aa recorded oy the Bahrain Petroleum Company.

Andrew Weir &amp; Co., acting- on behalf’of the British Ministry of . Food, for supply to other consuming territories. It is hoped that the price will be no higher than that paid for Ba.sra dates Last spring by the Bahrain Govemment,who are selling all qualities of those dates to the public at a uniform price of Rs 13/6/- per basket of 84 lbs or As. 2^ per lb. Hiis price has involved a subsidy by the Bahrain Government to the extent of from He. 1/6/0 per basket for the cheapest and most common variety up to nearly Rs 5 per basket for the most expensive variety. (ii) Meat. The controlled price of neat has been increased during the period under report, partly owing to the higher prices tnat have to be paid for meat on thp hoof fron Persia and oartly to bring no a. me d stocks on to the market. Tlie present nrices are Rs 3/8 per ruba for mutton end Rs 3/- per ruba for meat. In view^of the difficulties involved in obtaining livestock from Persia, and in order to keep prices down as far as possible, it has been decided that the Manana Municipality shall be cons- tituted the sole purchaser of all imported? livestock, v/hich they wil^. then sell to butchers, for the consurq^tion of the public, anc contractors, for the convsur.ption of the Services and the Bahrain Petroleum Corpany (reference paragraph 164(i) of Intelli gence Summary No. 15 of 1943).

The price of 'rattabs” is said to be between As. 2 and As. 6 per ruba (4^lbs), depending on quality.

U.K.C.C.Su^car ^wind /final ^Reference paragraph 171 of Intelligence Sunnary i T o. 16 of 1943 which reported the arrival in Bahrain of 7000 tons of sugar for storage on behalf of the U.K.C.C. A dhow bringing 4-02 bags of this sugar ashore foundered during the night of the 4th-5th September, when its anchor dragged owing to the sudden uprising of the Shana 1/and it hit a rock. 288 bags were salvaged , o,f which 33 were sound .and 29. were completely valueless. The remaining 226 bags were too badly damaged to be kept and were sold by auction on the understanding that their export would be allowed. They fetched Ks 34,500, or on average of Es 152/10/6 each, though their/average weight cprtbably did not exceed 50 lbs. 191* Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) In April 1943 the Chinese Government indicated a desire to send four students to Bahrain for about a year's study of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's oil production methods, with a view to controlling the Kansa oil-field,where some half dozen wells drilled by the Chinese had been running wild owing to the absence of the necessary technical knowledge, negotiations proceeded, and the Chungking authorities have shown great keenness that their men should come here. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, however, are not at ^present anxious to have them, in view of the forthcoming expansion of their operations end, among other things, the con sequent housing difficulties. • They have recently cabled to the Chinese National Resources Commission at Chungking accordingly. (ii) The Bahrain Petroleum Company are in need of some good mechanics. They normally recruit the rrreat majority of their skilled mechanics from India, but owing to war-time indus trial expansion that country is no longer a good recruiting-mround.. The Company are accordingly exploring the possibilities of obtain- ing mechanics from Zanzibar or Nairobi, where there are Industrial Schools believed to be run by Government. They have had one excellent man from the School in Zanzibar on their staff for five years ana would like to obte.in upto six others like him.

(ii) The price of milch cows and of bulls for slaughter in Bahrain is now in the region of Rs.420 and Ra.SOO per animal respectively, as against the normal pre-war price of about Bs .80 each. Many milch cows are now being slaughtered owin^ to the scarcity of bran and date-stones, their normal forms of sustenance.

Rumour has it that in Bombay a number of Saudi merchants attached themselves to the party in an effort to export a large number of things from India, but that the Bombay authorities refused their permission. A rumour is also current in Bahrain that the principal reason why the Amir^Mansoor is going to the Lebanon is for treatment of a knife wound which he sustained during an affray in Bombay. (ii) On September 24th Abdul Mohsin bin Saud al Jal^i, son of the Amir of Hassa, arrived at Bahrain for treatment at the Mission Hospital for general debility and anaemia. Pan-Arabism (i) On September 26th there arrived from Saudi Arabia, without any preViotis intimation of their coming, the Egyptian Under Secretary of State for the Minister of the Interior and the First Secretary of the Egyptian Legation in Jedda. The former had been visiting Saudi Arabia as head of a Mission* to Ibn Saud in connection with the Pan-Arab movement. They called on His Highness the Shaikh and left Bahrain on Septem ber 30th on the westbound flying boat which carried the Amir Mansoor (reference previous paragraph).' (ii) On September 21st there were seen in censorship two letters from Abdullah bin Ali al Zaiyid, the Editor of the newspaper 'Al Bahrain', to which a previous reference was made in paragraph 38 of Intelligence Summary No.3 of 1943. They were addressed, in precisely similar terms, to the Ministers of Education of the Egyptian and Iraq Governments, and asked that four boys from Bahrain might be given free tuition at Egyptian and Iraqi schools respectively; it was stressed that the boys were diligent, healthy and of pure Arab stock. Abdullah al Zaiyid is the brother-in-law of Shaikh^ Mohammad bin Isa al Khalifah, uncle of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, who has been on a two months r visit to Egypt and is now on his way back, but, ta&gt; what extent, if at all, these applications owe their inspiration to Shaikh Mohammad 1 s visit to^Egypt is'not known. They are unlikely to have been on behalf of members of the Ruling family and were in no way sponsored by His Highness the Shailfh. Medical Dr. M.L.A• Steele, the Agency Surgeon, had his appendix removed on September 18th at the Mission Hospital; it Is understood that it was an acute one and was taken out only just in time. He left hospital on September 25th and resumed duty on September 28th. Bahrain Government Hospital During the months of July, August British Service personnel to the numbers of 65, 75 ana ±o respectively were treated as in-patients at the Bahrain Government Hospital. Of the total, 95 were serv 2:^.^ Bahrain and 63 were brought here from outside. During August and September 57% and 33% of ,the patients respec tively were victims of complaints directly ascribabl^ t^ the heat, i.e. prickly heat, heat exhaustion and boils. he Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) On September 24th the first of the construction len for the Refinery expansion arrived in a D.C.3 tr ra !airo, having flown from the United States. There were /22/(ii) -4- % 22 of them for the Bahrain Petroleum Company and 5 for -one Lamornia y\ ra t&gt;i an standard Oil Company. L few more have since arrived and ethers are reported to be in Cairo awaiting onward transport. (ii) The Compahy’s Labour Supervisor is shortly leaving for India to recruit about one hundred Indian artisans and^cldrks on one year contracts for work in connection with the new expansion. (iii) The extension of the Company 1 s Refinery will involve a permanent increase of between 57 and 75 Staff (i.e.. British and American) employees. The Company’s New York Office, owing to the difficulty of obtaining men from other parts of the Empire, had expressed its intention cf^ recruiting 70 apprentice operators, machinists, boiler makers and power-plant operators in Canada and giving them three months’ refinery training in the United States befrre sending them to Bahrain. The Bahrain Management are not in favour of this arrangement for two reasons. The first is that they would prefer to have a completely free hand in giving the good new jobs to old and tried men with sound refinery experience in Bahrain, rather than feel themselves in any way bound to share them among new men with no experi ence of local conditions and with what they consider to be an inadequate period of training in America. The second is that it has been their experience that Canadians normally come to Bahrain, not with a view to making their career, v/ith the Company, but in search of 2^- years’ experience to enable them,at the end of their first contract, to return to Canada and qualify for good jobs there: only three Canadians out of about 150 employed here since the formation of the Company have returned to Bahrain on a second contract. It is under stood that the Company’s New York Office have now agreed with this view in principle. Mr. A. Ayto, the Personnel Manager, one of the six British employees whose departure for^England on leave was reported in paragraph 168 of the Intelligence Summary for the second half of August, is endeavouring to recruit anything up to 50 men there and has reported pros- pedts to be favourable. The Caltex Office in Cape Town has started a special recruiting campaign in South Africa and hopes to produce 25 men. 208.

Dates It is reported that Ibn Saud is considering the transfer of all dates at Katif to Jubail. The .Bahrain Government have fixed the price of local dates at Rs,7/- to Rs.9/- a basket. The general feeling is that the price which averages f^.l/S/- a basket more than last year is too high. The gardens are largely owned by members of the A1 Khalifah family. +CUa UL An unfortunate incident occurred on the 4th of October when a party of American sailors landed from a ship in the harbour. They are said to have acquired liquor from the Naval establishment at Jufair.

The reason for this action is said to be that the tribesmen for whom dates are intended dislike visiting Oatif. 223. Saudi Rials During the period under review, 167,000 Saudi Rials have been exported from Bahrain to Kuwait. It is said .that they are being purchased in Kuwait for re-sale to pilgrims. The»control of the export of Saudi Rials from Bahrain is being Considered by the Political Agency and the Bahrain Government. 224. Education in Bahrain. Although considerable strides have been made in increa sing educational facilities in both Manama and Moharraq, so great is the interest now being shown in education that on the schools re-opening the accommodation was found to be inadequate. Mothers realize that educated daughters have better prospects in the marriage market and fathers that educated sons earn more money. The Political Agent has suggested to the^Bahrain (Government that temporary accommodation should be acquired for the boys and girls who had to be refused admittance. 225.

This is the first organized Race Mooting to be hold in tho Island and His Highness was parti cularly enthusiastic entering a number of horses himself and arriving one hour before tho First Race. 241. Basrah Dates Considerable dis-satisfaction is x'^lt locally by the very high price being paid for Basrah dates purchased through the monopolists Messrs. Andrew Aeir &amp; Company of Basrah, 'gents for the Bahrain Government and the Trucial Sheikhdoms arc finding if impossible to purchase in the Basrah market at v-hrt they understood was to bo the fixed price of I. ).40 a Kara and they complain that Messrs, .ndrew „eir &amp; Company arc charging thorn I.D.24-500 a Kara as commission and doing nothing in return for the money. The view on the Trucial Coast is that Messrs. Andrew ..eir &amp; Company's charges arc. insisted upon by Ids Majesty's Government to raise money to buy aeroplanes with. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. It is*doubtful whether Basrah Dates can be sold on the Trucial Coast for less than R.lo/ 6 /- a basket, a price in excess of last year's, and /one2 one which vili strain the financial roaourcea of t»ho ' poor to the utmost limita f 2^2 .

Soc ial \ (i) On the 11th of December His Highness gave a modest dinner party in honour cf the Resident to which Vvore invited tho most roprosontative gathering that has boon soon in Bahrain for some considerable time. Owing to the extrema shortness of supplies the party was not on such a lavish scale as in previous years. (ii) On the 9th the Hen’ble Sir ‘Geoffrey Prior K.C.I.E., paid an un-official call on His Highness at Raa’fa and discuss-td the general supply position in the Gulf with particular refer ence to Bahrain.2 250* ’Id-ul-flhuhcu The ’Id uas celebrated on the 7th and 8th and the Political Agent Accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent and the Under Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf paid the usual calls on the leading mer chants in the morning and on His Highness on the afternoon of the 7th* 251. Merchants Advisory Committee t On the 11th v;as held the first meeting of a small com mittee comprising^repr esentfitives of all interests of the mercantile community. The Political Agent has asked these gentlemen to meet him once a week with a view to mutual dis cussion of trading and shipping problems# The Bahrain Govern ment is represented at these meetings by the Director of Customs# \ i 252. Basrah Dates Reference paragraph 241 of Intelligence Summary No.22 of 1943. The dates position has not improved# The Bahrain Government f s agent in Basrah has reported that the price of dates is rising in oho Basrah area and that even Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Company are encountering difficulty in making purchases. It must be emphasised that Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Company are making these purchases on their own account, according to information available here, and not to supply the Persian Gulf quota. Information received fr^m various S'-urces make a the outlook unsatisfactory for it is stated that at the end of this month the ban on the export of dates by rail from Khor- ramshahr will.be raised and that the present average monthly freight of 500 tons wqll bo increased to two to three thousand tons a month. This will naturally cause an immediate rise in the price of dates in Persia with a corresponding rise in the price of the Basrah dates. 253. Food Supplies Reference paragraph 242 of Intelligence Summary No.22 of 1943. The cereal stocks in Bahrain for practical purposes ceased to exist on the 1st of December and up to the 15th of this month there was no indication when further supplies would arrive. Most fortunately there were in Bahrain some 1,250 tons of wheat destined for Bastern Saudi Arabia which has been retained and is being issued to the? Bahrain Govern ment* If this wheat had net been present in the Island there is nu doubt that the population of 95,000 persons would h'VG had to live on a diet of dates and fish. Severe criti cism is heard daily with regard to those responsible for providing Bahrain with cereals. This criticism comes from nil classes of society. 254. T he Trucial Coast. The Political Agent r.rriVed at Sharjah on the 13th r,n&amp; after discussion with Wing Couimander Rothram, Commanding the Royal Air Force, called on Shaikh Sultan bin Saqor al Qasimi the Shaikh of Sharjah. On'the 14th the Political Agent visited Dubai and called on Shaikh Said bin Maktoom, 0.o.,j., and later attended a mooting of the leading merchants of Dubai. /Thet 255 r 3. Tho meeting was convened to examine the possibility of rationing piecegoods and to hear any representations that the merchants might wish to make. The systom of established snippers for piacogoods was soveraly criticised. Tho mar- chants complained that shippers in India insisted on shipping on their own account which meant considerable loss of profit to tho Dubaimarchants. They also complained that Export Trade Controllers were not permitting the full quota of pieeegoocs to be shipped as they regulated individual shipper^ q-iotas by the average amounts that those shippers had exported annually prior to the introduction of the quota system and the aggregate of these average annual exports did not necessarily amount to the full quota for the Trucial Coast as the esta blished £ nippers were not the only merchants engaged in ex porting piecegoods prior to the introduction of the quota • system. The Political Agent undertook to represent the mer- canmile community’s difficulties to the proper authorities. The same afternoon the Political Agent paid calls on Shaikh Kialid bi i Ahmed al Qasrni, Regent of Kalba, and Shaikh Ali bin Rashid al Naim who is representing his father the Shaikh of Aaman at present in India. On the 15th the Political Agent proposed mo visit Has al Khaimah but as the track had been rendered extremely difficult by inches of rain which fell in 14 hours on the 11th and caused considerable damage to the Royal Air Force Camp including the collapse of the Royal Air Foyce hosoital, he was unable to get to Ras al Khaimah in the tame at has disposal and visited the Shaikh of Um-al-Quwain instead. On the IGmh the Political Agent dined with the Shaikh of Sharjah. 0 I There are general complaints all over the Trucial Coast about the scarcity of piecegoods and the unsatisfactory diet which the unsatisfactory arrangements made by the Middle Fast Siypply Centre has necessitated. There is general -conster nation at the introduction of white flour at a price which I fear will be considerably beyond the means of the majority of the population.

At one time there were rather more than 600 men on strike. The Refinery was able to carry 'n due to the fact that a certain number of men remained at their work and volunteers were rapidly forthcoming from the English and American employees in other departments of the Com pany^ operations. workmen made no specific complaint to the Company or to His Highness the Shaikh or to the Political Agent before going ont on strike and it was not until the afternoon of the 24th that any lemand was put forward in writing by the men. It was unfortunate that the workmen lecilel to strike just . when^they lid because the question of their pay had been under Us- cussion for some time between the Agency and the Company and sanc tion for the increases which the'Company desired to make was receivel from their Directors on the 25th of December. If the men had only made a demand before leaving their work or had waite 1 another 48 hours a great deal of trouble would have been saved. * There was close co-operation between the Agency, the Bahrain GaT’eminent, and the Bahrain Petroleum Company and endeavours were made to bring the strike to a rapid termination. As a result of these enleavours the men had all returne l to work on the 31st of December and the situation was normal on the 1st of January 1944. Some of the men’s grievances which were recognized by the Company as being justified have already been adjusted and the others are being examined by the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and the Political Agent'. * (ii) Fire. On the 24th the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s cinema caught fire and was burnt down. The financial loss to the Company amounts to approximately•80,000 Dollars. This fire had no connection whatsoever with the strike which was in progress at the time as it was undoubtedly caused by a short in the illuminations of the Christmas Tree which had been decorated the evening before. \ The Trucial Coast. A fine of fb.7,000 has been imposed on Mohammed Faraiduni a resident of Dubai by the Shaikh of Dubai for smuggling sugar from Dubai to the Persian Coast. The fine will be used to reduce the price of cereals s &gt;ld to the poorer elements of the town. Obituary On the 26th the mother of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, an uncle of His Highness, died at Moharraq. The old lady was the wife of Shaikh Isa His Highness’ grandfather and a person of con siderable ability. She was at one time considered to be anti- British in her sympathies and was Undoubtedly ill-disposed towards the Adviser Mr. C.D. Belgrave, C.B.E. In her later years she seems to have decided that both the British and the Adviser were n't as black as she had previously imagined and died at the age of nearly a hundred pro-British and on excellent terms with the Bahrain Government, She was in full possession of her faculties to the last The Political Agent paid the usual call of condolence on Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa immediately after the burial. / 264 . 262. 263.SECRET Intelligence Summary of the Political Agency, Bahrain, for the period 1st to 15th No.1 of 1944. ’ January 1944. 1.

On the 11th of January the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and the Political Agent, examined in detail a list of grievances which had been put forward by the strikers. As has been previously reported the more important grievances had already been recognized and adjusted by the Company but there remained a number of minor points which required consideration. 7.. Rent Control On the 2nd January the Bahrain Government, under pressure from the Political Agency, produced a Rent Control Order v/hich not only controlled future increases in rent but legislated for a reduction in the existing rates for dwelling houses to what they were two months earlier. The Order also required all leasesto be in writing and defined the causes for which leases could be terminated by landlords. 8. Smuggling of Arms On the 15th of January the Bahrain Police arrested certain Bahrain subjects who were suspected of smuggling and found them in possession of five rifles, four revolvers, and approximately 300 rounds of ammunition. It is strongly suspected that the arms and ammunition were to be smuggled to Persia. The actual owner of the arms is at the moment at Hawar Island but is expected to return in the near future. 9 • Smuggling of Food Suoolies On the 14th the Bahrain Police patrol launch inter cepted a sailing boat bound from Qatar to Kuwait and Persia.

He discussed the general question of supplies both for Bahrain and the Trucigl Coast 'and met the Director of the* Bahrain Customs on the morning of the 20th and Mr. J.M. Campbell the Manager of Messrs, Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited. Mr. Eagleton was made aware of the extreme poverty of the majority of the inhabitants of the Trucial Coast and Bahrain and said that he would do his utmost to obtain a reduction in the price of the white flour with which we had recently been supplied. It was pointed out to Mr. Eagleton that this parti cular flour was objectionable both on account of its high cost and &gt; also because proper facilities did not exist for the making of bread from flour of such high quality. It was agreed that Bahrain would endeavour to absorb 200 tons and the Trucial Coast 400 tons of high grade flour a month until such time as the present surplus had been worked off.

Mr. H.S, Bowlby, Petroleum Division Representative, Baghdad arrived on the 5th from India and had discussions with the Poli tical Agent, the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petro leum Co., Ltd,, and the Manager of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Lt. ; Owing to a serious shortage of coal the Government of India are anxious to ship 6,000 tons of coke from Bahrain every month and Mr. Bowlby was investigating’ the ways and means of achieving this desirable object.

The Air Vice Marshal Is understood to be leaving for Washington shortly.(vi) On tho 8th Commodore C.F. Hammill= R.H., Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf paid a farewell call on the Shaikh. Commodore Hammill is uniorstood to be leaving for Durban, (vii) Brigadier Hudson, V.C., C.B., D.S.O., M,C., paid a visit of inspection to the R.A.F. Levies and called on the Political Agent on the 13th. The Political Agent had a further interviov; with the Brigadier at Sharjah on the 17th when various outstanding problems were discussed.

He has recently • completed the Pilgrimage and was^met at the airport by Khan Sahio^ Haji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo, C.I.E., M.B.E., and other leading citi zens. He conveyed a friendly greeting from Ibn Saud to the Political Agent. 22. Royal Air For ;,e The headquarters of the Persian Gulf Levies has been trans ferred from Bahrain to Masirah. The construction of buildings for the U.S.A.T.C. is proceeding very well in Bahrain but has been held up at Sharjah owing to a shortage of 'juss' and coral rock. The n juss ,: problem was solved on the Political Agent’s recent visit to the Trucial Coast but the speed of delivery of coral rock depends on the calmness of the sea and that is in the hands of God. # The transfer of No.244 Squadron from Sharjah to llasirah has been postponed until after the 1st of April owing to the lack of accommodation at present at Masirah. The Squadron is in the process of being rearmed with 'Wellingtons” to the satisfaction of the men and the peace of mind of travellers. 23. Broadcasting The permission of * Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited has been granted for the Public Relations Bureau to broadcast on their new and much more powerful transmitter. It Is hoped to commence using this transmit t er in a week ? s time and thus eliminate 'skip distance' which interferes so disastrously with thi reception of the Bahrain Broadcast at Muscat and Kuwait. 24. Trucial Coast While o. the Trucial Coast the Political Agent drove from Sharjah to Dhaid and thence through the Wadi al Qaur to Kalba. The outward journey took eight hours and on the return journey a night was spent at Lhaid. The Political Agent was accompanied by the Political Officer Trucial Coast and Shaikh Hunaid bin Abdullah the nephew and general factotum of the Regent of Kalba. The trip was made possible by the courtesy of the Anti-Locust Mission who kindly provided transport. While the Political Agent was in camp at Sharjah he exchanged calls with the Shaikh of Sharjah, the Shaikh of Dubai, the Regent of Kalba, and received calls from the Shaikb of Kalba, Shaikh Rashid bin Said of Dubai, and Shqikh Ahmad bin Abdullah al Jawasimi. Every opportunity was taken by the Political Agent to meet the people of Dubai and Sharjah and he attended meetings of the directors of the Foodstuffs Company and the Piecegoods Company as well as interviewing tie members of the Hindu community. 25. Mecca Incident There hare been no repurcussions 1 .cally as a result of the Mecca incident at the Pilgrimage though travellers arriving from .Saudi Arabia maintain that the young Per ian pilgrim was innocent of any intention :o defile the precincts of the Kaaba. He was unfortu nately for himself sick. His sudden demise is attributed to the clamour raised by the Egy.ptiah pilgrim's. 79.9*F on 10th. 55.5 # F ; on 7th. 91 % on 8 th. 51 % on 1st. (3d.) T.

The work on the buildin' s for the U.S.a.T.C. in Bahrain has pro ressed satisfactorily, but there has been a further hold up at Sharjah particularly owing to short supply of coral rock, Every effort is being made to ensure adequate deliveries of coral rock and juss.

The yo'ing boy has cone to Bahrain in order that he may receive an education which will be of service to him when the time comes for him to take over the Sheikhdom of Kalba from his uncle the Regent Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed al Ja*-assini. This attempt to educate one of the sons of the Trucial Shaikhs is nery much of an experiment and it is doubtful whether it will be successful.

It is strongly,suspected that immediately prior to the attempt to smuggle arms and ammunition out of Bahrain, an attempt which was success fully frustrated by the local police, some 16 motor tyres and a quantity of pieces oods were smuggled out and sent to Kuwait. The men who were caught in the recent case have been convicted and they were undoubtedly members of a big gang of smugglers who worked in a large way, One of the Mgharraq Naturs was in the pay of the smugglers and was among the persons convicted at the trial,-.

(ii) On the 17th Mr. Alan Muntz a director of Air V/orhs Limited, Indian National Airways, and Miser Air Corooration arrived by air from Abadan. Mr. Muntz was interested in persuading ^ the Bahraini Petroleum Company Limited to start a private air service. - ot^ unnaturally the idea did not commend itself to the management of the Oil Comoany who are well served by the British Overseas airways Corporation and the J.S.a.T.C. for external comcnnication while the dimensions of the Bahrain Islands do not warrant anything: more speedy than a motor car for internal communication. Hr. Muntz was hoping to contact Hr. Ohliger of the Arabian American Oil Company but as that gentleman is at present in the United States he was unable to do so. (iii) On the 18 th Air Commodore A.P, Javidson Air Ox dicer Conmandin; Habbaniyah, arrived from Kabbaniyah and left for Sharjah.; Me. , the following day.

(iv) On the 2dth Major General Connolly- of the U.8. Army arrived for a brief visit lasting only three hours. The Political Agent saw nothing of Major General Connolly as it seems to be customary for senior Officers Ox' the U.S.Army to acquaint the Bahrain Petro leum Company Limited with their movements and seldom the Air Liaison Officer and never the Agency. /(• ) (v) Wing Commander II.C, Parser arrived on the 27th to relieve Sq/Ldr.

The party only remained in Bahrain for a period oi an hour or so and then left by air for Jeddah. The Political Agent was only informed of the visit after Mr. Jorvan had actually landed but he immediately irove to Moha mag airport and was able to have a very instructive three-quarter of an hour with the Minister.o Cj&gt; • *) 43.

Mr. Bechtel appeared to be satisfied with the progress bein£ made by his Corporation in the construction of the Refinery extension and was optimistic about the completion of the work within the specified period. 44. Messr s. Gray Macken z ie &amp; C o.. Ltd. Mr. J.M. Campbell the Manager of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie £ Co., left for Ira^; en route to the United Kinrdom on the 25th. There is some doubt whether Mr, Campbell will return to the Persian Gulf as his servic-i of more than -30 years in the Persian Gulf area has seriously impaired his health. 45. The Easter n B ank Limited Mr. Mi Gunn of the Eastern Bank havinr handed over the manager -ship to Mr. d.S.b. Brown has, like a yreat many other people, been waiting with what patience he can for transport to India. Ho ves sel prepared to carry passengers from Bahrain to India has called here since 28bh February. 46. Ths Arab ian Am erican Oil Company —(Late California Arabian S t and ar1 Oil C omp any. ) ^nsutrol It has been learnt that drilling has stopped at the Arabian A*merican Oil Company^ experimental well at Abra’aIrlTabrit to the south of the Kuwait—Saudi Arabia^zone. It is 'understood that as no traces of oil were discovered after a depth of 10,400 feet had been reached the Company decided to.abandon the experiment and the camp at Abrak-alvKabrit is reported to have been closed down. 47. Locusts During the period under review locuste appeared in Bahrain . Very luckily they did practically no damage and after a stay of two or three days disappeared in a southerly direction. Appeals were made to the Anti-Locust Mission but much to the surprise of the local inhabitants a reply was received to the effect that the Anti- Locust Mission were unable to deal with adult locusts. It seems that they can only take effective action against the creatures in an immature state as eggs or hoppers. 4 8. Exp ar t Permit s fr om India At the weekly Commercial Advisory Committee meeting at the Agency on the 27th certain of the 1 members alleged that established shinpers in Indip were selling the actual export permits to the higuest bidder. There were also complaints that merchants in India who prior to the war were the agents for business houses in Bahrain having now become ’’established shippers” are refusing to do business wi'h bheir old principals on the same terms. They are insisting on Bab.ain business men acting as their agents and Bahrain'merchants are forced to acquiesce or to cease trading in that particular line. Slave T raffic It-was reported to the Political Agent that Said al ITaser, Abdullah bin Ghanim, and Suleiman ITejdi persons who have previously taken a leading cart in the slave traffic had arrived in Brraini from Saudi Arabia. In order to refresh the memories of the Trucial Shaikhs with '’egard to their undertakinr s the Political Agent thought /fit i3. fit to address a letter to each of then on the srrhject of Slave Trade and warned then to take steps to exclude the aforesaid gentlemen from their domains. 50, Saudi Rials Although the export of Saudi Rials is forbidden from Saudi Arabia they are beiny brourht into Bahrain in considerable numbers and- during the last 15 days the Ayency has been asked to yrant export permits for exactly 100,000 rials. Accordin' to the poiicy at present being followed — a policy which it is understood is in accordance with the views of His Majesty f s Minister at Jeddah — no export permits have been granted. This does not mean that the rials will necessarily remain in Bahrain but it does mean that the enterprising Kuwaitis who are the principal dealers in this commo dity will find it more troublesome to export their goods to Kuwait. 51, Bahra in Bro adcasts .On the .’BOth a trial broadcast was made by the Public Relations Bureau on a new wave length on a much more powerful transmitter than that previously in use. The results of the trial were extremely satisfactor- 2 r except on the Trucial Coast where apparently the broad- cast was never heard. Application has been made through the Ministry of Information in Cairo for permission to introduce regu lar broadcasts on the new wave length and it is hoped that it will not be^long before the nightly programme is put over on the new transmitter. The broadcasting studio is being redesigned with a view to eliminating echo and the slightly microphonic effect caused oy an unusually thin connecting wall'. It is hoped that recording equipment .will shortly be available from Cairo and the programme v/ill thus be vastly improved by the introduction of items of ourely inter-Gulf interest. o2. Interr uptio n of Gable s It has been reported that cable communication between Bahrain and Fao has again been interrupted and # that telegrams for Irag'will oe forwarded by wireless to Bushire and then by cable to Fao. 55* Wreck, of a Kuwai t ’’Boom'. X 4/ On the JOth a severe storm started and the wind blew conti nuously at gale force for 40 hours. On the 31st a dhow belonging to Haji Ahmed A1 Ghanim of Kuwait and captained by Saad al Kitami' started several seams due to the high sea running and was beached by her captain in order to save the lives of the crew on a sandbank 2 0 miles nprth of Bahrain. The captain and crew were brought off the following day by a small vessel and it is honed that the major portion of the cargo which consists of dates and'date stones will be salvaged. It is even possible that the dhow Itself can be repaired. The action of the captain in beaching his vessel is commended locally as had he endeavoured to make Bahrain it is cer tain that the dhow would have sunk and more than probable that the lives of the crew would have been 54.

Saudi Arabia Sight nakhudas whose vessels were chartered by the Saudi Arabian Government to carry dates from Basra have petitioned that Government. It seems that they waited three months in Basra for cargoes and eventually were forced to sail empty. They are each claiming a fairly considerable sum of money. 64.

A B.O.A.C. flying b*at landed at Yas Island and the injured were evacuated to Bahrain. As a result of the efforts of an engineering party which went down by sea to Yas Island the aircraft were flown off and arrived in Bahrain on the 26th. 69, Boom in land prices in Bahrain Some of the Bahrain merchants have undoubtedly done very well financially during the past two cr three years and as these same merchants are afraid that the value of the rupee currency will dete- riorate after the war they are purchasing land. In conseouence land valuer have risen very considerably. During the period under review a small parcel .of land which changed hands three years ago for F .2,000/- was recently purchased by Mr. Khalid Aujan the agent for the British-American Tobacco Company for F^.70,000/-. 70. The Bahrain Petroleum CompanyLimited There has been mild agitation among the unskilled labour employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company for free transportation between their houses and their work. The Political Agent has taken the matter up with the Oil Company and it has been agreed that the men's demands are to a certain amount justified as the cost of bus fares have risen considerably. The Bahrain Petroleum Company and^ the Bahrain Government are making combined endeavours to find suffi cient transport to carry Manama and Maharraq workmen to and from the Company's premises at Awali. Unfortunately it is impossible to take immediate action as no transport will be available until the Bahrain Government's lorries arrive from India and the vehicles promised by the Persian Gulf Service Command to the Bahrain Petroleum Company are forthcoming. 71. Da te s Dates are once mere proving embarrassing. As much as are required for local consumption have already been purchased by the Bahrain Government but large quantities of dates are now becoming available, apparently from Persia, and are being offered for sale here at F .12/- a Gosra. The Bahrain Government purchasing through Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Company had to pay P’.30/- a gosra*c .iTlf-Q Bahrain. The Question of prohibiting the import of dates is under active consideration as shoulcl these very cheap dates now come on to the open market the Bahrain Government will probably suffer a severe financial loss. • 72. Bahrain Government employees The Bahrain Government are again having difficulty with their State employees. The position is that the Police and other essen tial departments of the Bahrain Government are now receiving adequate pav but certain individuals who were car drivers and skilled artisans orior to taking service with the Bahrain Government can now command much higher rai-es in their old occupation than in their present ones. On the termination of their agreements policemen and others are seekinr their discharge in order to undertake more remunerative worK elsewhere. Discussions are taking .place between.the Agency and the Bahrain Government with a view to finding a solution to the problem. The position will become acuter as the tremendous building programme on the mainland gathers way. It is understood American Oil Company will shortly^be recruiting 10,000 workmen or the Has Tanura refinery construction. 73.

Shaikh Hazza bin Sultan escorted by His Highness the Shaikh *f Bahrain paid an official call on the Political Agent on May 1st. (ii) Oh the 5th of May a severe dust storm occurred during the course of which General Sir Bernard Paget, K.C.B., D.S.O., M.C., Commander-in-Chief Middle East, Mr. S.R. Jordan His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, Majer-General Dowler, M.G.A., Dr. Bailey »f the Middle East Supply Contre, Cair«, Shaikh Abdullah Suleiman the Finance Minister of the Saudi Arabian Government, Mr. Mann Vice-Consul Jedda, and various Staff Officers arrived most un expectedly. The party were en-route from Jedda to Ibn Saud's Camp near Ramah but were forced by bad visibility to come to Bahrain. On the 7th May, the weather having in the meantime improved, the party continued their journey to Saudi Arabia. His Highness the Shaikh paid a call on the Commander-in- Chief Middle East and Mr. Jordan at the Agency on Saturday the 6th of May and entertained them to dinner the same evening. (iii) On the 11th Mr. Rattinson the General Manager of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company at Abadan arrived in Bahrain on a visit to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. Mr. Pattinson accom panied by the Political Agent paid a call on the Shaikh on the 13th. - - (iv) Saiyid Nasir bin^Stfto^d who was at one time the Wali at Qariyat and has recently vacTft^ed the appointment of Vali of Luwan called on the Political Agent on the 13th.

Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to His Highness the Shaikh' of Bahrain, paid a visit to the ruined town of Zubara on the west coast of the Qatar peninsula. The object of the visit was to examine the limits of the ruined tov-n and the ring of ancient forts which encircle the Zubara area. The /party in2. party noticed with interest that a large modern fort had been con- s^uctedby the Shaikh of Qatar in close proximity to the wells of wL!! j, Th ^_^°rt was garrisoned by half a dozen bedouinsiwho were at first reluctant to permit the Political y\ g ent to survey /gentle the country from the roof of the building but later yieHed to/per- suetion. The party returned to Bahrain by launch the some evening 78. Trucial Coast Ar , . the Political ^gent accompanied by the Residency Shar J ah visited Has al Khaimah. After calling on the Shaikh he made a tour of the grain shops in the town and noted evidence of hoarding and smuggling. Later the whole matter'was discussed at length with the Shaikh and the Political Agent returned to Sharjah by car the same evening. _ . , ^ l° th thG Political Agent visited Shaikh Rashid bin ? ut&gt;ai * Shaikh Rashid is acting for his father Shaikh ba ed Maktum, O.B.E., who is on a visit to India. The same after- n ? on ,. G Political Agent visited Ajman and discussed various out- s andmg matters with the Shaikh who had that day returned from Manama• 79. Beni Oitab On the evening of the 8th Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan the para- mount Shaikh of the Naim from the Baraimi—Dhank area. Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad the principal Shaikh of the Al Bu Shamis from he Baraimi area, and Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin the paramount Sheikh of the Beni Qitab called on the Political Agent 2. he Residency Agent’s house at Sharjah. They were accompanied by Shaikh Mohammed bin Saqr who is acting for his brother the Shaikh of Sharjah who is at present in India. The meeting was interesting and very amicable. Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin has for the last ten years consistently refused to go anywhere near Sharjah although the Shaikh of Sharjah is reported irom a reliable source to have offered up to P'.80,000 as an induce- -“I 111 'k° P Q y a short visit. Now that contact has been made with this elusive but powerful bedouin shaikh there is every pros pect of improved relation with a people who can, if they desire and they often do, be most tiresome. 80. Pearl Trade It is probable that the pearl dive this year from Bahrain, Sharjah, and Dubai will be on a much reduced scale. This is due to the absence of rice and the difficulty of cooking wheat and baking bread in small overcrowded sailing vessels and also to a c ertain extent to the demand for unskilled labour at.all these three places. It is probable that the numbers taking part in the dive from other parts of the Trucial Coast and Qatar may be much the same as usual but their range will be restricted as the absence rice will necessitate frequent returns to port for re-victualling. 81. Shipping Space Great difficulty is being experienced by local merchants both m Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast in exporting quota goods from India. Once the quota has been granted'and export licence obtained they have then to search for shipping space. Many com plaints have been received from exporters of all kinds of goods that their merchandise has been waiting for weeks and still no space is available. The situation is not likely to improve in the near future unless more steamers can be made available for the advent of the inonsoon will very much restrict the movements of sailing crafts in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. 82. Hoarding and Profiteering The difficulty of obtaining shipping space for piefcegoods from India has resulted in considerable speculation in the local /piecegoods3. £o«n G S° 0d S m srkot, Pieeegoods ha&gt;ie been changing hcind^ b(rU nrnv-,vf r i hants at fa { 1 5 astic P I 'i« es many morfhants who have previously never dealt in pieeogoods h$ve made large purchases and are reported to be holding against an anticipated rise in prices. The general public appear unwilling to complain against individinl merchants for profiteering and the authori- ties are therefore finding it very difficult to deal with the situation. Regulations are being prepared which will make oiamg or piecegoods by non-recognized dealers in that com- modity in excess of household requirements an offence and action will be taken to search suspected premises.

A ircraft Mishaps (1) On the 22nd a Flying Fortresd 1 on a photograohic recon- naiasanco flight force-landed on the mainland opposite Yas Island* Four members of the crew descended by parachute and were found the next morning some 49'miles to the east of the aircraft. Two . °t thom ^ Gre sightly injured while the two members of the crew who remained with the aircraft escaped without ariy injuries. It is understood that the ’Flying Fortress’ is a total-loss as it was landed on a part of the beach below high water mark and is therefore submerged twice in every twenty-four hours. 23rd a Royal Air Force machine landing near the -^lythg Fortress 1, to rescue the two members of the crow was slightly damaged but will probably be able to be flown off after repairs have been carried out. (iii)Cn the same day f23rd May) a ‘Warwick’ aircraft had diffi culty with its landing gear and crashed at Bahrain. It is understood that no one was hurt. 88• Ras Tanurah Refinery On the 24th the Political Agent accompanied by Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton the Chairman of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd. inspected the site of the proposed 50,000 barrel Refinery at Ras Tanurah.^ Construetiorihas already commenced on aceommodatioa for the housing of the l^sb Americans required for the actual construction work but owing to the nature of the ground progress has not been rapid. The houses are being built on concrete foundations laid on white sand-dunes. The sand is watered for some days before the concrete slabs are cast in the hope that the sand will remain firm until the mixture has set. The Refinery ItseLf will be built near the base of the penissula on low lying land of the salt marsh type. Very careful experiments have been and are still being carried out by foundation experts to deter mine exactly how the weight of the heavier Refinery buildings must be distributed. It is probable that concrete piles v/ill be used fairly extensively passing through the soft elements of the ground and resting on sand stone formations well below the sur face. Except for machines moving sand hills and surveyors at work at the moment there is no sign of any building activity. The problem of discharging ships, the first of which is to arrive early next month, is most serious. So far Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company Bahrain have neither the necessary tugs nor the barges. The haul from ship to shore will be quite a short one as the deep water anchorage appears to be only about 1,800 feet from the end of the peninsula. The small Refiner^ which is already in existence at Ras Tanura has just been resttfttfted in order to provide motor spirit, &amp;c., for the construction program me. 89. Saudi Arab ia While at A1 Khobar the Political Agent was entertained by Abdul-Aziz bin Abdul Aziz al Madhi the acting Governor of Ositif, while at Dammam by Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhal the Saudi-Arabian representative in Bahrain and with the Arabian American Oil Com pany at Dhahran, and by Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz al Qassaibi at his garden at gafwoh. While at Dammam the Political Agent met the President and members of a Royal Commission who are investigating various important problems in the Hasa-Qatif area. Nuri—as-Sa T adawi, a native of Tripoli in Libya the President of the Commission has been in Saudi Government service for only six months prior to which he was resident in Syria for 31 years, in fact sinoe the time he found it advisable to leave his native country owing to his dislike of Italian methods.

The problem of the Ba.'irain Government enolovees is still un- solvea partly due to the fact that His Iliphnoss the Shailrh is an apostle ol appeasement and will not ayree to anything in the nature of conprlsory service, and partly because the Political Ayent is not satis!led that certain of the Bahrain Government employees are in recei Ox a reasonable v;ayo and is not jpenared to a; ree to compulsory service unless he is sure that a liviny wa: e is bein' paiu to all persons who are compelled to serve the Bahrain Government.

Commander Benhart the A merican Maval Observer, Basra, in the course of conversation with the Political A{]ent said they were considering the desirability of appoiutiuy an officer from his office in Basra to act as Assistant Laval Observer for Bahrain and Ras Tanura 4 It is already difficult to understand what the three American Laval Officers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company can find to do and there is no apparent necessity for the appointment of a fourth official. The number of American ships arriving here, other than tankers which are presumably dealt with by the U.S.Laval Officers attached to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, is expected to decrease from nov’ onwards as the major portion of the stores and construction material for the Refiner 1 ' has already arrived. o,a .

Labour , Labour difficulties increase day by day owing to their beiny more and more demand for and less and less supply of able bodied men as unskilled workers. The demand is due to the e.up ansi on in the R.A.F. building: oroyramme and the intensified work by the Berchtel-McCone-Parsons Corporation ,T ho are constructing the Refiner extension. The dinunition in supply is due to 52Id men haviny al ready left for the pearl ba.nlis and some further 2000 preparing: to do so in the near future. The reennitiny proyramme#for labour for Ras Tanura will shortly be openiny and it is now estimated that they will require 15,000 workmen for tdeir Refinery Construction and not L0,000 as was stated in para,-raoh 72 of Intelliyence Sum mary IJo.C; of 10dd. The question of restricting, the movements of /manual« 5 manual workers from Bahrain will have to be seriously considered in the very near future. Although the difficulties are at present considerable it is worthy of note that they are only temporary for both the Refinery expansion v/orh and the R.A.F. worh should be com 1 pieted by the end of the year. lOl.

On the 1st of June the Political Agent presided at a meeting of the Senior Officers of the Services and the heads of the prin cipal business houses in Bahrain* The meeting was called to discuss the very serious shortage of labour and to consider means by which the shortage could be remedied.

It was decided to endeavour to recruit labour from Iraq hh or Persia and it was understood that the Bahraiu Government would probably raise no objection provided suitable guarantees were given with regard to rationing, housing, and the repatriation of 'fbreign' labour. 106.

Air Transport ^Security The Station Manager of the British Overseas Airways Corpo ration, Mr. H. L. Pointer, and the Senior Traffic Officer Mr. G.B. Gillibrand, called on the Political Agent on 12th July to discuss the question of tightening up security at the flying boat basis. There had been some pilfering at night from flying boats and information had been received that some mail bags had been slashed and mail stolen on the Cairo — Karachi run. It was not thought that this had occurred at Bahrain but extra precautions were desirable. The company had requested the R.A.F. Station Commander to supply guards but the latter had been unable to assist. The Political Agent suggested that as far as petty pilfering was concerned, passengers could be told that no res ponsibility would be accepted for articles left overnight in the aircraft and that they should not leave articles behind. As to /the2. v ™ v I the supply of. guards, the R.A.F. Station Connander should be approached again, since it seemed clear that the responsibi lity was his, and if shortage of guards was the reason for his inability to assist, he should be requested to move higher authority, for the supply of extra guards. Meanwhile the company should station chaukidars on their planes day. and night. 2. Vide paragraph No.ll9(ii) above Squadron Leader Cramer when calling on the Political Agent discussed inter alia the legal side of a proposal to improve security arrangements in connection with the examination of air passengers.

Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani left for Qatar on 10th nugust after recovering completely from the troubles with his teeth which wher he arrived in Bahrain over a month ago had put him in considerable pain and even danger. The Political Agent had previously called on Shaikh Hamad while he was still in the American Mission Hospital and found him making a good recovery. -The call was returned at the Agency. The Shaikh enjoyed a well-attended departure, His Highness Shaikh Salman, dt • ^ • 5 &gt; ^ er ceadiig; members of his family being present. The Polltica . xigent also attended the send-off in impromptu fashion having ^usc.. landed at the jetty from Sharjah by flying boat gs His Highness party arrived. The recently restored good relations between Bahrain and Qatar are apparently being cemented In cordial fashion. 135. Supplies for Bahrain •i ttu £ u S ust His Highnoss Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad kkalifah, k.C.I.called on the Political Agent to express nls thanks to the Agnncy and to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for all ■the help received in bringing in food and other essential supplies to Bahrain. His Highness said he realised that he was not entitled by any treaty to claim such /assistanceassistance and consideration as he had enjoyed unless it be that the British in engaging to defend his territories night be held to be obliged to defend then from'the eneny of want. He was therefore all the more grateful for the readiness with which the needs of his people had been net. It is true that His Highness is wont periodically to express his gratitude and regard for the British connection. But in admitting that as far as supplies^and the effectiveness of controls was concerned his territory was in a more favoured position than perhaps a number of inflation-racked countries in the Middle East he appeared to be paying a sincere tribute. In actual fact, for sone months previously few supplies had reached Bahrain owing to the preoccupation of shipping with construction materials for the oil companies. But stocks were such that no acute shortages had developed and at the time of his visit His Highness was aware that the s.s.’‘Isnailia” carrying 2,678 tons of sugar, tea, piecegoods, and other commercial cargo was expected* 136. Food Control As usual before Ramadan, a meat shortage has recently been apoarent, the probable cause being that butchers have been holdin out for higher prices knowing that the public will pay any price lor meat during' Ramadan. It was known that there were plenty of animals on the Island and it became clear that the butchers were restricting killing to keep up the price. On^August 6th the Food Control Committee decided to remedy this position by adopting the following arrangements:- (1) All imports of livestock to be purchased by the Government acting through the Manamah municipality at prices agreed between the municipality and importers. (2) The municipality to retail meat at % controlled rates, engaging &gt; . .'for the purpose tv/enty qualified butchers on a monthly ♦ salary.# (3) Importers not accepting the municipality rates to be at liberty to kill animals themselves but to sell at con trolled rates. The measures have met- with considerable success and meat is being regularly supplier at the following prices: Beef not exceeding Rs. 2-4- 0 per ruba Mutton not exceeding Rs. 2-12- 0 per ruba Goat not exceeding Rs. 2-8-0 per ruba These prices are claimed to be 30% cheaper than prices before— Ramadan last year and it is satisfactory that the position has improved before the festival begins. 137. Fish. The Food Control Committee has also taken measures to tighten up control of the fish-sellers. Contractors and villagers had been selling outside the towns. With the help of the police, who have fined offenders in the Barbar and Sitra areas, the situation has improved and fish is coming in to the market in greater quantity. Large fresh fish are selling at Rs.1-8-0 per ruba and small fish at Re.l/-. This is a slight increase in price but considerably more fish is coming in to the bazaar. The price for prawns and salted fish has gone down. 138. Dangerous drivinr; There has recently been an increase in road accidents. There have been^three fatal accidents in the past four months /and/141 and five in which serious injury has been caused. A number of traffic islands and electric light standards have been run into while the speed limits for various areas of the town have been widely disregarded. The root trouble is possibly the fact that the demand for drivers is such that some of the men being engage^ are often not competent (and, in some cases, not licensed) to drive light, not to speak of heavy, lorries. At the instance^ of the Bahrain Government, a letter is being issued by the Poli tical Agent to the services and the Bahrain Petroleum Company requesting that drivers be warned to exercise more care. The Political Agent has suggested to the Commandant of the State Police that the police should prosecute in all cases of dangerous driving. Offenders may expect not to be treated leniently in the courts. There is often difficulty in securing evidence. A mobile traffic patrol has been introduced, but this consists of only one motor cyclist. The police hope to increase the number of motor-cycle patrols. 139. Labour The labour situation has improved somewhat though both the largest employers of labour, the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Royal Air Force, still require coolie labour, the former in particular still being in need of about 2,500 men. However, the wage increases approved in the meeting of employerr* held in the Agency on 14th July have had some effect. The Bahrain Petroleum Company report that their coolie labour is up by about 12% on their figures of men employed on July 1st and by 6th August the number employed was 5,330. The R.A.F. report an. increase of about 100%, the numbers on 15th August being about 981. Efforts made by the Company to obtain labour from Persia have not been very successful. Inquiries made in Saudi Arabia also have not been fruitful and it is thought that labour from this quarter will not be available until after Ramadan, Inqui ries pursued in Iraq have met with no success. The Company have lately turned their attention to the possibility of obtaining Italian labour. Italian internee labour from Egypt has been considered unsuitable but inquiries are being made concerning a better type of Italian colonist labour in Eritrea which has already been successfully employed ' by the Americans therei The inquiries are exploratory at present and it has been pointed out that employment of the above labour would require to be approved by British Security authorities and the political authorities in the Gulf. The employment of such labour, if in any number, would present both a policing (from the point of view of maintaining good order) and a security problem. 140. Incident at Sharjah A serious incident occurred at Sharjah on the night of 30th July. ’ Three American personnel of the A.T.C. approached a barasti hut on the outskirts of the towns and attempted to abduct a woman. The woman, as it happened, was the mother-in- law of the brother of the Shaikh of Sharjah. As the woman cried out and attracted the attention of neighbours who came to her help the three men dropped her and made off in their vehicle, not before one of them had broken the butt of the rifle of one of the Shaikhs guards who came to the spot. Great indignation was felt in Sharjah over this incident and there is little doubt that but for our good relations with the Shaikh and his people the affair might have developed in very ugly fashion. It was unfortunately not possible to identify the men concerned but strict precautions have been taken against a possible repetition of the incident.141 142. 4. f 1 , incident occurred in Bahrain in the early norninn of and h t«n C non‘ r ^ ur J*P erlc ans assaulted and chased an W.cto. of th^town. f h6 Dahrain State ?olice ln a certain quarter ashore &gt; fron d a y Br'H 1 ?=h C 1 - ae S ber ?£ the crew of 8 tanker was put hin re a British tanker, the crew refusing to sail with ^mewh=t t ^ erWlSe ha J' nleS3 » this individual displayed a tendency, somewhat dangerous in a tanker, to turn playfully the wrong of P the^=n&gt; 1VeS t0 str i ke natches in inflanmble quarters £ an ^ er ' There was sone discussion as to who was the responsible for looking after the nan since there is Bnhr*?£ £c h t Sp £ tal J ln Bah rain.

No meat appeared in the markets at all and sheep, goats, and steers, of which there had previously been a number in the Island, disappears into thin air. Unfortunately the Bahrain Government had no •stock of animals themselves and as no imports were received for several days there was no meat available for the majority of the population.

Much incensed at this Shaikh Jassim returned to Qatar and immediately left for Saudi Arabia announcing his intention of not returning. Servants were ~ sent after him to persuade him to return but he and his fol lowers ^are alleged to have opened fiio upon them and continued their journey.

The Qadis maintained that the moon must be seen by the requisite number of v/itnesses while His Highness the Shaikh declared that the ’Id should take place on the 18th as both their Majesties of Saudi Arabia and Egypt had decided to hold the ’Id on that date. The state of suspense became more acute as sunset came and the moon failed to appear. The Qadis were distinctly pleased whereas the Shaikh with a tele gram from Ibn Saud In his pocket signifying that the ’Id uld be on the 18th was seriously annoyed. About 11 p.m. the crew of a small dhow arrived and swore roundly' that they had seen the moon when they were some five miles from the coast off Bahrain. So the ’Id was held on the 18th by consent of the Qadis and by order of the Shaikh.

The Arabian American Oil Company. Dhahran . 206 Indian artisans arrived by transport from India en route to Dhahran on the 11th of October. These artisans had been recruited m India for service with the Arabian American Oil Com pany m Saudi Arabia and had been informed that the Company wouid provide them with cooked food from about the 15th of October at the c °st of Re.l/- a head a day. At the same time they had been advised to bring cooking utensils with them as the Company could not guarantee that they would be able to commence their messing arrangements by the target date. Unfortunately the vessel containing the stores, cooking pots, stove tops, &amp;c., for the Company failed to complete her journey according to schedule and now rests somewhere in the Gulf of Aden with the aforesaid' utensils. The result has bepn that the Company were unable to carry out their undertaking and the Indians have announced their intention ol returning immediately to India. The Company consulted the Political Agent Bahrain who advised them to arrange transport- ation for those men who desired to return to India but stated that they should not be sent to Bahrain until satisfactory onward trans port had been arranged as shortness of accommodation and food locally would not permit of their making a prolonged stay.A oesMxiim&amp;c:' * SACRBX.

He was accompanied by Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave his Adviser and appears to have been much impressed with what he saw. His uncle Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., was prevented from being present owing to a previous engagement and his other uncle Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa al Khalifah owing to a failing % memory. (ii) Reference paragraph 171 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No. 19 of 1944. It is understood that the new Company Guard are anxious to introduce American police methods and to patrol the Refinery and Awali plant premises with radio equipped cars. Neither radios nor cars are available nor for that matter does the area to be covered justify such very / western- 3 • western methods. (iii) It is understood that arrangements have now been made for a number of the families of British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to obtain passages from England to Bahrain.

On the 26th 36 Indian employees of the Arabian American Oil Company arrived from Dhahran en route to India. According to the Indians the Oil Company failed to give them adequate provisions or accommodation and they stated that they were not prepared to work under those conditions whereupon it seems the Oil Company management interpreted this to mean a refusal to go to work and dismissed the men under Clause 12 of their Foreign Service agreements. It is anticipated that a further 60 or 70 dismissed Indian employees will be arriving at Bahrain as snon as the local representative of the Company has been alble to find transport to India for the individuals who have already arrived here. The Protector of Emigrants at Bombay has been informed of the position and he has asked the Political Agent Bahrain to intervene with a view to obtaining / resonablef - 4 • reasonable conditions for the cjen and to inducing then to remain at work. 183. Coke Shipment^ It is understood that it is hoped to be able to commence bulk loading of coke for Port Said early in January of next year. 184. Meat Shortage Reference paragraph 145 of Intelligence Summary v No. 16 of 1944. There have been further shortages of meat during the period under review and the Bahrain Government have at last accepted the advice of the Political Agency and announced their intention of killing only on four days a week. The general public will now be aware of when meat will be available and will also have the satisfaction of knowing that on these days there will be ample meat for* everyone. • Police 135. although under strength the Bahrain Government have agreed to undertake the guarding of the Royal Navy*s Wireless Trans mitting station at Jufair. This has been done as the only alternative appeared to be for the Royal Navy to import a number of ex-Iraq levies at rates which were nearly 100 per cent higher than those now being paid to the local police force. 186.

The,.Arabian American Oil Corapany, Dhahran Reference paragraph No* 182 of Intelligence Summary No. 20 of 1944. ^ The Assistant Political Agent' was present at a meetin- between the representatives of the Company and their dismissed Indian employees in Bahrain on the 7th. The Company represen tatives informed the men that they would be prepared* to provide all their Indian employees with cooked food from the 10th of November and asked if.th^y would be willinr to return to work forthwith or whether they still desired to'go to Indian The employees appeared to have unanimously decided against returning to work. ^Later the same day the Political Agent discussed the situation with the Company’s representatives and suggested that they should make an alteration which would much simplify the text of the letter which they proposed to address to each one Oj. their disgruntled employees, sc as to make no mention of the cause of the present disagreement and further that tney should grant tho men half pay as an ox gratia payment for the period during which the discussions had been taking place. The representatives of th~ Company agreed to the Political Agent s suggestions but stated that trn-y must obtain the formal approval of the General Manager. Unfortunately the management of the Company refused point blank to alter the letter or to grant any allowance to the men for the period they had been off duty. Thus when the Political Agent himself met the men on the 8th he could but suggest that they should give the Company me more trial and not unnaturally they were nit willing to do. so.

On his westbound journey the Assistant Political Agent presented the political Agent's compliments as the Political Agent was unable to be present himself owing to the expected arrival of Sir George Cunningham. His Highness declined to come ashore from th^ flying beat preferring to pass his time during re-fuelling traversing the space between the islands in a launch. (ii) Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah, C.I.E., left for his annual hawking excursion on the mainland on the 19th.

The mission consisted of M -&lt;srs. B.E. Hull, . Oscar Wolfe, C.M. Rosebrugh, H.H. Hall, Sidney Johnson, Captain Rumsey, and Mr. W.J. Lenahan. Mr. Hamilton later had a c °nf^- ence with the Hon'ble the political Resident and called again n the political Agent the following day to say farewell leaving for Dhahran. At the second meeting he informed (.that he proposed to leave Dhahran the following day for Riyadh to W interview His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud. He was then returning to Dhahran by clr and flying to Cairo where he expected to remain f.r a few days before again visiting Bahrain.

Bowlby, the Petroleum Division Representative at Baghdad, called on the Political Agent accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel H.T. Hewitt, M.C,, the station commandor. Mr. Bowlby had come to Bahrain in con nection with the filling and shipping of high grade petrol n drums. The drum plant is now capable of working to capacity and the problem to be solved was how the loading i'ho drums was to be carried out and what arrangements couid be made for storage. ; it is understood that it was hoped to deal with some 70,000 drums a month. Mr. Bowlby was accompanied by a considerable body •f experts and it is probable that the theory of the operation has now been agreed to, (vii) on the 26th the Earl of Munster accompanied by Mrs. De Bathe arrived by air from India and left for Baghdad on the 27th. 199.

Attempted sabotage at the Refinery On the 21st 6£ Notfcdibs&amp;ff It was .reported to the Political Agent that a minor incident had occurred in the Refinery which was somewhat alarming owing to the apparent cause being an attempt at sabotage. The engine of a pump was being reconditioned in the Refinery and on being inspected prior to reassembling it was found that a quantity of sand^had /been3 been introduced into the lubricating system and that a handful •f emery abrasive had been placed on the piston head in one of the cylinders# There seemedito be two schools of thought with regard to the perpetrators if the outrage, the management of the Company holding the view that it was undoubtedly the work of the rather rough Persian element who had been recruited recently for semi-skilled labour, while the Security Officer took the view that the Persians would not be capable of the intelligence and forethought required nor did they know where to obtain the abrasive and that it was probably the work of a non-Asiatic. The Bahrain Petroleum Company f s private police were investigating and the Security Officer was also giving considerable attention to the matter. The Arabian American Oil company# Dhahran. Reference paragraph No#194 of Intelligence Summary No#21 ®f 1944# On the 22nd the Assistant political Agent, Captain* MiP.O’C* Tandy, went to Dhahran to investigate the living iondi- tions, &amp;c*, of the Indian ex-employees of the Arabian American Oil company who were awaiting repatriation via Bahrain to India./ The Assistant Political Agent interviewed the men at Al Kh#bar and examined their accommodation which he considered adequate and did his best to persuade them to accept the very generous scale of rations which the Company are now prepared to give them with an additional cash payment of Re.l/- a day for the purpose of buying meat and fish. However the men refused point blank to have anything to do with the Company or to be beholden in any way to the Company. On the Assistant Political Agent’s return on the 23rd he recommended that the Indians should be brought *ver to Bahrain as early as possible as they appeared to be gradually becoming mentally deranged and were suffering from a persecution complex# Accommodation was arranged for them in tents through the courtesy of the British Overseas Airways corporation and the men were brought over to Bahrain on the 30th. They are accepting the rations which are provided for them by the Arabian American Oil Company’s agents in Bahrain. 205. Cigarettes On the 27th Mr. S.A. Masood, the representative from India of the British American Tobacco company, had an interviev/ with the Political Agent at which he discussed the difficulties which their agent here was experiencing. The Political Agent pointed out to Mr. Masood that the administration had had a great deal of trouble with Aujan the British American Tobacco Company’s agent and that he was very strongly suspected of having smuggled considerable quantities of cigarettes out of Bahrain, and that his private fortune had increased by several hundred per cent during the course of the last three years. Mr. Masood was concerned with regard to the quality of some 2% million Wills’ cigarettes which he stated he was unable to sell locally and asked for an export permit. It was pointed out to him that export permits for quota goods cannot be granted and that his company had failed to import any cigarettes at all f#r several months and if export was permitted then the stocks of cigarettes in Bahrain would be depleted to a very serious extent. He was requested to endeavour to keep his imports uptodate as the present conduct of the firm inclined one to the belief that they were keeping the islands short so that the inhabitants would be forced to buy the unsatisfactory brand which they had insisted on their agent importing. Mr. Masood raised the question of imports from America and he was told /thatthat his agent had not made any application for shipping space although due notice had been given. It was now regretted that the lists had been closed some weeks and that space could not be made available. 206. Qatar (i) Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim A1 Thani, C.I.E., the Ruler of Qatar is nearly eighty years of age and has surrendered the greater part of his authority to his most important son, Shaikh Hamad. He has even handed over the seals of office to this son. As a result.of investigations carried out by the Political Agent earlier in the year and more recently by Khan^Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzak the Residency Agent at Sharjah (reference paragraph No*183 of Intelligence Summary No.21 of 1944) and the perusal and examination of reports and petitions which have been received from time to time it has become only too clear that the political situation in Qatar is unsatisfactory. Shaikh Hamad has behaved in a very high-handed manner and has rendered himself objection able to themajority of his father’s subjects and of his own relatives with the result that the former have to a great extent left the country and the latter are only living in Qatar because they are dependent on the Ruler. There is no doubt that a percentage of the quota goods, in particular sugar and piecegoods, which have been allotted to Qatar have never found their way to the people for whom they were intended, and there is reason to suppose that some arms traffic has been taking place between Qatar and Persia. Measures are under consideration to ensure that grain, piecegoods, &amp;c., do in fact reach the people for whom they are intended and Shaikh Hamad’s connection with the arms traffic and the re-export of quota goods is being examined. (ii) It having been established that Abdullah bin Darwish and his brothers jassim and Abdur Rahman have been actively en g a g e d in re-exporting quota goods from Qatar and probably trafficking in arms the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has decided that the movements of these persons must be restricted. The Political Agent has been instructed that they should not be granted travel documents and the Shaikhs of the Arab side of the Gulf and the British consular officers of the Persian side have been . asked to co-operate in ensuring that the Darwish brothers remain in Qatar. 207. Weather Towards the end of the month fairly heavy showers of rain fell and reports were received from Saudi Arabia of extensive rain all over Nejd. Later reports were also received from South Persia to the effect that heavy rain had fallen over large areas. This news is most welcome because it will mean that the livestock imports for next summer and winter are assured and should be sufficiently plentiful to bring the price down very considerably. Rain in the Bahrain Islands is unwelcome as it does no 'one any good and often causes serious damage to house property. 208.

The representative was well received and His Highness is parti cularly pleased with the conversations which took place between his representative and the Shaikh of Qatar. As a result of the report of Abdullah bin Jabar His Highness 1 outlook towards the Shaikh of Qatar has much improved and he remarked recently to the Adviser that'he would,be heartily thankful when the Zubara question was finally settled as it appeared to be as resilient as a tennis ball and that he was very tired of the whole affair. His Highness is not alone in this. Trucial Coast (i) On the 12th Captain R.E.R. Bird, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, accompanied a Royal Air Force party to Abu Dhabi where they propose to enlarge and improve the Existing landing facilities. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, returned to Sharjah on the 13th. (ii) On the 30th of November a 75-mile an hour gale did considerable damage to house property at Sharjah where 1^ inches of rain in twenty m:nutes did nothing to improve the living conditions of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. Three sailing boats in the Sharjah creek were sunk and one of the crew was drowned. Casualties have already occurred at Ajman whore fishing crafts were sunk. Thefts of Royal Air Force ammunition On the 7th Flight Lieutenant Frankland, D.A.P.M. from Habbaniyah, called on the Political Agent in connection /with/218. with the theft of 2,000 rounds of R.A.F. ammunition i. ,.i from the Royal Air Force Lines at Sharjah. Flight Lieu tenant Frankland was in fact more concerned about the theft of 30,000 rounds of R.A.F. ammunition here,which he had hadthat day reported to him. It seems that this ammunition was stolen from the R.A.F. magazine at Maharraq and indications are that the Levies are seriously involved in the theft. Todate the civil police have been able to recover 8,000 rounds which include 1,000 rounds of revolver ammunition. It is strongly suspected that the major portion of the ammunition has already gone overseas and agents f reports from Qatar indicate that possibly 7,000 to 8,000 rounds are secreted at Rueis and Al Khor. The Shaikh of Qatar has been asked to co-operate in our endeavours to recover the ammunition and the Political Agent has sent a special messenger to Qatar to consult v/ith the Shaikh and is also having enquiries made through confidential channels. T ravel facilities for civilian families from the United Kingdom. Unlike the wives of officials of the Government of India the wives of employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company do not appear to be encountering any very serious obstacles to their leaving England for the East. Sixteen ladies have already arrived in Cairo from the United Kingdom. Two of these ladies are accompanying their husbands who are coming out to Bahrain for the first time. It was not until they reached Port Said that transport difficulties were encountered but the situation has somewhat eased and quite a number are expected to arrive in Bahrain in the near future. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) On the 12th three American employees of the Berchtel McCone Corporation, having consumed a quantity of spirituous liquor, paid a visit to Manama town. They assaulted several beggars who were annoying them and later*took refuge from the crowd which had collected in a local coffee shop. The Military Police from Awali were on their way to Manama to deal with the situation when Mr. C.A. Rodstrom, the local representative of the Arabian American Oil Company, succeeded in persuading the men to leave the coffee shop where they were then engaged in throv/ing pieces of furniture at various members of the crowd and return to the Oil Company's premises at Awali. The following day the men were dismissed by the Company for cause and left Bahrain by air. (ii) The Drum Plant. Preparations are now being made to ship a maximum of 44,000 drums a month of high octane fuel from Bahrain. The loading and stevedoring is being done by the military autho rities who are sending petroleum experts with 300 Indian troops to cope with the situation. At the moment however the plant for making the drums is not working satisfactorily as could be expected as it is only turning out 18,000 drums a month. Additional machinery is however on the way and it is hoped before long to increase the production to the required figure of 44,000. The Arabian American Oil Company, Dhahran.

In an interview with the Political Agent Mr. Jones stated that his Company were anxious to obtain at least 50,000 tons of Bahrain u smalls M . He was concerned, about the problem of moving such a large quantity of coke to Port Said and did not share the optimism of the Middle East authorities who had assured him that it will be possible to arrange a programme of six days to load 6,000 tons in Bahrain, ten to twelve days for the journey to Port Said, and six days to offload at Port Said. After consultations with the Bahrain Petroleum Company it is understood that Mr. Jones returned to Cairo convinced that although every one was only too willing to assist him and although ships might be obtainable the Oil Company' pre-occupied as they were with 100 octane production and. the shipment of cased oil could not. give him any assistance to load the M smalls'. Nor were Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company able to make any offer with regard to the provision of barges, &amp;c., as their organisation is extremely busy with the work at Ras Tanurah in addition to their Bahrain commitments, f 227.
