Ity dear Longrigg, Would you kind] sfer to your letter of the 31st August, Ho.P.C.23/78, and connected correspondence about the proposed Refinery Clause in the Political Agreements between the Company and His Majesty’s Government in respect of the Concessions which they may obtain on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. I enclose a copy of a revised draft Clause which we subsequently drew up in the hope that it might represent a compromise which the Company would feel able to accept. As you will see, it is less rigid than the original draft Clause. I showed this revised draft to you a little time ago but gathered from you that you thought it would be quite impossible for the Company to accept it as it stood and that no draft could be acceptable to the Company unless it took commercial considerations into account. We have since considered the matter once more and Lo ngrigg, Es q., we/ Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C.2.2 . we are now inclined to a^ree that it is desiraole to in any case His hajesty 1 s Government would have in fairness and that it is unnecessary to make the Agreement too rigid in regal'd to the size of the Ref inery which would 'be set up, a matter which would necessarily be affected by circumstances of the time. y/ith these considerations in mind we hav 1 a further revised draft which I also enclose (marked ’B 1 ). As you will see, it constitutes a very considerable advance to meet the Company’s point of view, and I hope that you may be able to accept it. If, however, there are any further points in connection with the wording which you wish to raise, we might perhaps settle them in discussion. We agree that the Refinery Clause may be separated from the Political Agreement and may be made into an Agreement on its own. In the present revised draft I have accordingly added a preamble. There is one other point which you raise, namely, introduce a reference to commercial considerations, which to the Company to take into account when the time came the /3. the extent of the area to be covered by the Refinery A 0 reemenc. You suggested, I think, that it should merely cover any Concession areas which the Company may have in Bahrein, ^aca 7 ana the I'rucial Coast. You suggested that tne Kovveic x&lt;eucral Zone and i!:uscat were too remote from this area to be included. I am afraid that we do not agree with you on this point, and you will see that I have included one neutral Zone and iiuscat in the final revised draft. tie appreciate that if 500,000 tons of oil were produced oy the Company of which a small proportion came from all these Sheikhdoms, it might not be a commercial proposition to set up a Refinery in any one of them. On the other hand, the Company's total production might turn out to be in Muscat or in the Neutral Zone and oil might not be found in commercial quantities in the Trucial Coast area at all. In this event commercial considerations might well permit of a Refinery being erected iii Muscat territory. This, of course, is an extreme case and. there might be any number of permutations or combinations which could only be judged in the light of existing circumstances when it comes to the point. It seems/4. scenio to us that tha Company would, os tully sate guard© d. by the proviso in regard to commercial considerations. May I assume that, unless I hear from you to the contrary, you are prepared to the draft in this form to your Board, in which case I will submit it here for approval. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSONDRAFT REFINERY AGREEMENT (B). This Agreement dated the is made between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom (hereinafter called His Majesty's Government) of the one part and Petroleum Concessions Limited (hereinafter called 'the Company', which expression shall be deemed to include its successors and/or assignees and shall also oe deemed to include any subsidiary Company) Whereas the Company holds or may hold oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area (which expression shall be deemed to include the Koweit Neutral Zone, Qatar, Bahrein, Trucial Oman, and Muscat) the Company has agreed with His Majesty's Government as follows:- • Whenever the production of crude oil in the areas in which the Company holds concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the Company undertake to erect on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf within one of the said areas, or in any other place which may be approved by His Majesty’s Government, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons of crude oil per annum, unless the Company can show to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government that this would be precluded by commercial.considerations. If and when the total production of 500,000 tons is achieved the Company agree to consult with His Majesty’s Government as to the best location for, and/2, and scale and products of, the refinery or refineries. The Company undertake to complete the refinery or refineries and put and maintain it or them in efficient working order with due diligence and dispatch hut in any event within two years from the date on which the selection of the site or sites shall have been agreed between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. In the event oi the total production exceeding 1,000,000 tons the Company agree to examine with His Majesty's Government, should commercial conditions justify it, the question of establishing further refineries or of increasing the capacity of any existing refinery or refineries so as to provide for the refining of not less than one third of the total crude oil production in the said areas.(2j) CONFIDENTIAL.

Yle should, however, be prepared to insert between the words 'which shall' and the words 'be conducted' the words 'except in routine or unimportant matters'. It will of course be for the local political authorities to make such arrangements as may be necessary to carry out the terms of the agreement without causing vexatious hindrances to the Company’s activities. The right, however, must be reserved to them to judge what matters may be regarded as unimportant, and, in the case of important matters, what method of communication should be used. In the suggested paragraph 10 we a^ree that the words 'in any case in which the Company feels that the free movement of its personnel v/ithin the concession area is being unnecessarily restricted' should be substituted for the words 'in any case of dispute between the Sheikh and the Company'. As regards the refinery clause we are proposing, subject to the concurrence of the other Departments concerned, to make this into a separate agreement as you suggest. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) M. J.

In fact, of course, the Political Resident would, in case of a frontier dispute between two of the Shaikhs,be the umpire and have the last word, but Holmes feels that to say so quite so definitely as is done in Article 25 may cause the Shaikh of Dubai to hesitate, although, therefore, we will now include this Article in the Draft Concession, we cannot ignore the possibility that Holmes may have to omit it if its presence is a stumbling-block to signature. _s the Article is not one uor which you have ever pressed, (though you have accepted it), I imagine chat its omission would not worry you. ,iQ apprecia that all the Drafts which you mention in your letter under reply must be finally approved by the Secretary of State.

This would suit us as our aim was not so much to get money out of the Shaikhs as to impress upon them their responsibility. 4. %*.

(b) that before parties went to Abu Dhabi or Dubai, Haji Williamson to go ahead with a similar letter. (c) that Residency Agent should meet Haji Williamson at Dubai or Abu Dhabi (wherever he went first). 8. The Political Resident explained that it would be necessary to think over the question of boundaries between territories of Qatar and Abu Dhabi and that of Bin Sa T ud. 8. An antimation was to be given to the Bahrain Government about wireless. Mr. Packer would write in about it. 10. The question of parties taking arms was discussed. Prims, facie the Political Resident saw no objection to shot guns, if the Shaikhs agreed, and to revolvers, but not rifles unless perhaps one to a party for shooting game (though for this it would be easy to borrow an escort rifle).

CITY-GATE HOUSE, FINSBURY SQUARE, LONDON, E.C. 2. 18th Novemher 1936. Dear Mr.Clauson, I refer to your letter P.Z.7702/36, dated the 28th October to Longrigg, (who left last week on a short visit to the Near East) on the subject of the proposed Refinery Clause i^i i ^ in the Political Agreements between P.C.L. and His Majesty’s Government in respect of concessions which may be obtained on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. Your revised draft marked M B' has been duly considered by the Board, and is accepted - not v;ithout some qualms. The Board rely on the fact that they can look to H.M.G. for a reasonable interpretation of the phrase ’’commercial considerations” and that H.M.G. appreciate in particular that a small production in a number of separate concession areas, even though the total might reach 500,000, might not necessarily justify the erection of a refinery in any one of those areas, if the cost of collecting small parcels of crude oil and transporting them to a central refinery site were a serious item of expenditure. They also think it right that I should draw the attention of H.M.G. to the fact that, even if oil is found in the Trucial Coast, it does not necessarily follow that it will be of such quality as to make it a commercial proposition to obtain from it the particular products in which H.M.G. may then happen to be interested, or to process it in the manner and to the extent necessary to make it comply with the particular speciiications which may be laid down by the Admiralty or the Royal/Royal Air Force, and still find a market for it at competitive prices. Longrigg has given me to understand that it has been agreed with you that the Pre-emption Clause, which in the Qatar case is a schedule to the Political Agreement, will, in this case, 'be a schedule to the Refinery Agreement. May I take it that we shall shortly 'be receiving this Refinery Agreement and Political Agreement for signature, / since I gather that all outstanding points have 'been settled. in the correspondence ending with your letter No.P.105/36, dated the 31st October; and that the Dubai Draf4r-dToTes received with year letter P.2.726 d October, have been duly approved by all th ments of H• M.

P.Z. 8413/36. 25th November 1936. r Dear Mr.Skliros, I have to thank you for your letter of the 18th November stating that the Company accept the proposed Refinery Agreement in the form finally suggested and making certain comments in that connection. These comments are being brought to the notice of the interested departments of His Majesty’s Government. As regards the Preemption .Clause, it is the case that I told Longrigg we were considering favourably the suggestion for taking this out of the individual Political Agreements and adding it to the Refinery Agreement, and that I anticipated this would be agreed to. Since then, however, we have been going into the matter further and it seems to us inevitable that the individual Sheikhs should assent to the Preemption Clause (which among other things provides for His Majesty’s Government taking over the entire working of the concession in certain p'Skliros Esq., Petroleum Concessions Limited, circumstances)./ City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. 2.

This being so, the point of removing the Clause from the Political Agreements loses its force (the idea of course is that the Refinery Agreement should not have to be submitted to the individual Sheikhs), and we propose to leave it in. No question of principle is I think involved: Longrigg’s point was merely that the complicated Schedule might confuse the Sheikhs* minds. But we shall have to leave it to our local people to explain the matter to them in simple language. As regards the last paragraph of your letter, the various drafts are at present under submission for the final formal sanction of His Majesty*s Government. Directly this is obtained, we propose to telegraph to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf authorising him to show to the Sheikh of Debai the Draft Political Agreement and tte draft exchange of notes, explain them to him and secure his acceptance of the principles involved. When we hear by telegraph that this has been done we can immediately complete the signature of the Political Agreement here and authorise the Resident by telegraph to effect the exchange of notes with the Sheikh directly the Sheikh and Major Holmes have concluded the Commercial Concession. The/m The Refinery Agreement we can of course complete at our leisure and independently of the above procedure, since it is a bilateral agreement only and the Sheikh is not concerned. been agreed between us apart from e which actual text since my letter of Oc o Longrigg, namely 'from time to time' at the end of Article 4.

They remained 12 days at Abu Dhabi trying their best for the settlement of the dispute and it was with great difficulty that they made Shaikh Dhakhbut accept a proposal according to which the boundary line would run from Hasat Um-al-Jibajib which is about 10 miles from Jabal , Ali. Shaikh Sa ! id bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, summoned all the notables of Albu Falasah agreed that the peace proposals should be accepted with slight modification, namely, that the boundary line should run from Bandar Hisyaiyan which is about three mile from Hasat um al Jibajid or 13 miles west of Jabal *Ali. The object of asking for the boundary line to run from Bandar Hisaiyan, is to allow the Dubai people a shelter for their boats near Jabal 1 Ali. Agent, Bahrain VCONfflO'-girciAL io.924-3 of 1936.

I find that on 18th June 1930 Shuckburgh sent Oliphant, in a personal and confidential letter, a copy of a letter from Humphrys which shews why Cooke left ^raq. correspondence with Oliphant, Cooke is alleged to have been caught trying to smuggle antiquities from Baghdad, and at the request of the tlraq Government the necessary instructions were issued by the Foreign Office to ensure that he was not granted facilities to travel to 'Iraq in future. you will no doubt have views as to whether the 'Iraq Government are likely to wish the ban maintained. As regards the question of Cooke's entry into any of the territories dealt with by the colonial Office, we did not at the time take any steps to exclude him, but, as we have special mandatory responsibilities in Palestine and Trans Jordan in regard to the protection of antiquities - apart from the fact that Cooke's action in 'Iraq does not suggest that he is a very reliable person, we think we must consult the High Commissioner before agreeing that there would be no objection to Cooke so far as concerns those territories, and if you wish (a telephone message will do) we will get off a telegram to him. As you will see from this letter and the subsequent 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Walton. yours sincerely, (SD.) O.G.R.WILLIAMS.7502/6915/65) Decode. Sir A.

Ihe Shaikh of Sharjah inwardly is deadly against the Shaikh of Ajman and is tryiny his oest to put him down in the eye of the Government so that he may encroach on the houndary of Ajman. The Shaikh of Ai^an does not understand this fact and thinks that the Sha'kh of Sharjah is giviny him good advice by saying to him that he should not give any sort of undertaking. The above is a real and correct information about the Shaikh of Sharjah’s intrigues. Even the Shaikh of Has al Khairnah was not willing to give a written undertalcing unless he received a letter from the Shaikh of Sharjah as to what he did reply to the Government and frankly said that he would not go against the Shaikh of Sharjah’s advice. I was against the idea of telling him what reply the Shaikh of Sharjah or others have giveiig because it would be difficult to deal with them if they all Tombine. I did not tell him of the reply of the Shaikh of Sharjah or others nor did I show any leniency which would suggest to him that I would accept the Shara' law, until he himself said that he,would be willing to abide by the Shara’ law. It has always been the habit of the Shaikh of Sharjah to mislead other Shaikhs v/ith the object of either getting the benefit before them or showing them in the eye of others that they are unfit persons. On one or two occasions I mentioned this fact to Captain Hickinbotham, and, if end not watch him properly he would have even spoiled the negotiations of Kalba. The Shaikh of Sharjah is against Ajman on account of the past troubles. • Sd/ A. Razzaq. 23.12.36. R.A. Sharjah, For information,f U ^ t * Confidential. No. C/14-10/12. #/?

This was initialled by the Huler of Dibai vide para graph 6 of enclosure to India Office Printed letter flo.P.Z.6367 of 5th September.

The final concession as approved by His Majesty’s Government in so far as they are concerned is therefore tne draft concession referred to in paragraph 2 above as modified by Longrigg’s and Clauson’s letters mentioned in paragraph 3 above. 5. Your paragraph 3. (a) With regard to the first version i.e. Longrigg’s proposed Article 2b. I gather that you have not seent his version in print in Holmes’ final draft. However if Holmes assures you that it is the same as in Longrigg’s letter this is all right. (b) With regard to the other version. As drafted this seems to me unnecessary and impracticable. If the territorial limits of Diba.i have been 'determined' how can the area of that State be further 'expressly delimitated'? It would seem to mean doing the same work over again. In their concession under Article 1 (a) the area of that concession covers the territory of Dibai. These frontiers are at present undelimitated, but some -77 time in tne future tney will be authoritatively delimitated in some document or other, this delimitation being a purely political question into which tne Company do not come . Article 1 (a) read witn tnis document gives, I think, all that the Comp ny want. However, if they do require a link between their concession and the document referred to^then in their concession something /something of this sort might be added to Article 1 (»). ’’The Shaikh agrees that when the territorial limits of the State of Dibai nave teen determined the area covered by the concession will be coterminous with the limits so determined”, please discuss this with Holmes and let me kno,v the result as I may have to telegraph His Majesty’s G-overnment for a decision unless the letters in the mail of the 25th January clear this up. 6. Your paragraph 4. I have not yet received copy of Longrigg’s letter of 27th December, No.PC 28/189. 1 may get it 0 n 25th January and, in any case, when received I will, if necessary, telegraph my comments. 7. Last sentence of your paragraph 5. Please see ray paragraph 5 above. j 8. Your paragraph 6. Under Article 11 (a) the Company have already 'the right without hinderence to construct .. roads etc. etc.”, and this addition would therefore seem redundant. However if Holmes wants to put it in for some 9. Your paragraph 7. 'he position is that the control of the liquor is in the hands of the Shaikh and the Political Agent.

To His Hrit&amp;nnic Majesty’s Political Agent BAHKAltf Dear Sir, xne following shows briefly tne stage I nave reacned in my negotiations witn tne SnaiJui of Dubai. me ShaiJcn did not pass tne Article dealing witn the boundaries of tne different Territories as drawr/up by hong- rigg and tne India Office, ne accepted tne alternative one as drawn up by tne non'ble tne mlitical nesident in tne Persian &lt;iulf, so l snail nave to incorporate tnat version in tne Agreement. The Shai&amp;n said tnat it was unreasonable tf&amp;t if oil D °t of commercial quantity be found and used by the Comp any tnat tne annual payment of Rs.25,000 snould not be increased. This probably will nave to be put at Rs. 40,000 instead of Rs.25,000 but is not yet settled. On tne same page l3) ne accepted tne two (2) Annas per 1,000 cubic feet of gas won and sold. me Article as written in tne revised Agreement - which deals with the importation by tne Company of alcoholic drink - nas proved a real stumbling block.

To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent Bahrain. Dear Sir, My last letter to you was dated February 16th and in which I dealt with the stage reached in my negotiations with the Shaikh of Dubai up to that date. In order to make the present position clear to you, I must go back to the time of my arrival here this year (January 28th). I have been occupied in negotiating for a period between 7 and 8 weeks with the Shaikh of Dubai. Soon after my arrival here it became evident that the Shaikh of Dubai was not acting entirely on his own initiative, but that he was in constant consulta tion with adjoining Rulers, and from the numerous comings and goings of important persons from and to those States it_was easy to be seen that the Rulers East of a&amp;d including Dubai had combined and were con sulting and discussing much among themselves, more particularly in respect of that part of the Concession Agreement which deals with affairs having a common interest for these Rulers. ' I do not think that the payments to be made under the Concession Agreement were included in the above discussions, as it is generally recognised by the Rulers that such payments must have a relation/^ to the size of the Area controlled by each Shaikh. After my official talks with you in Sharjah I opened negotiations with the Shaikh of Dubai and sub mitted the Draft Concession Agreement 1937/A. The Shaikh was rather perturbed when he saw that such a large number of alterations and additicns had been “made in the 1937/A Draft when compared with the Draft Agreement initialled by the Shaikh on 1st of September of the 16th February, the attitude the Shaikh of Dubai took up as regards additions and alterations suggested in 1937/A Draft. was being informed of events in Qatar, Hassa and Kuwait, as he early in my discussions with him began to speak about 'SAFEGUARDS' and said he knew his friends in Qatar, Hassa and Kuwait had drilling obligations and Representatives provided for in their Concession Agreements, and that he wanted some such safeguarding clauses added to Dubai Agreement. 1936. I have already reported to you in my letter I It was also evident that *the Shaikh of Dubai The//f lo2} r ?-* aaA S' / v / The Company state in their telegram of 2nd March 1937 that Qatar has no London Representativ Clause, this statement the Shaikh of Dubai brushed aside by saying that there was some such safeguard ing Clause, or why was the Shaikh demanding payments (in Qatar) for Representatives if he had no right to them. $ 1 The Shaikh based his obligatory drilling demands on the Hassa Concession Agreement, the** terras of which he collected from a Mecca Newspaper viz. 'Urnmul Qora”. However the Shaikh agreed to forego one of the above two demands, and as he saw the xkxxg chance of money in the London Representative Clause, he selected it, but he has consistently insisted that he must have one or the other. /Q After my talks with the Shaikh on 1937/A Draft and later when I informed him that the Hon’ble the Political Resident had suggested that certain alterations be made in the wording of those Clauses which deal with the importation of Alchoholic drinks, meth od of deporting foreigners if proved to have committed misdeeds, and the boundaries of different Territories. These were all satisfactorily settled- after considerable talk - as the Shaikh accepted the Hon'ble the Political Resident’s advice. ft At the same time I told the Shaikh of Dubai that I had mentioned his demand for a London Representative to the Political Residant and that he (the Hon’ble the P.R.) had told me that he did not think the Political could support the Shaikh in this demand. f \ t* ^ KtoT rxtJ &gt; The stage now reached with the Shaikh is shown in the attached Drafr Agreement (DUBAI 1937/0 in which is embodied the alterations and wordings suggested by the Hon’ble the Political Resident, and accepted by the Shaikh. The two conditions remaining - at this stage ISth'Khrch l$3f -to be sett,led with the Shaikh being :~ (a) Upon which date the payment at the rate of Rs. 25,000 per annum becomes operative? The Shaikh claimed it became operative on the date that the Draft Concession was initialled (1st September 1936). (b) The Shaikh’s right to appoint a London Representative . Both of the above named conditions the Shaikh agreed that they could be the subject matter confi^eiitial lettei’s between him and the Company, and hot embodied in the Concession Agreement proper, Upon receipt of the Company’s telegram dated 19th March 1937, I arranged a meeting with the Shaikh of Dubai for Monday the 22nd March 1937. This meeting was held at toy my house and the Shaikh arrived unaccompanied. The meeting lasted from 9 a.m. till 12.15 p.m. The Shaikh listened to all I had to say regarding the two unsettled questions. ^ I informed the Shaikh that the Company had agreed th at the date upon which payment at the rate/- 3 - ml rate of Rs. Rs. 25,000 per annum became effective was September 1st 1936, and that the Company would also pay up-upon signature of the Concession - all the un paid monthly payments under the Option Agreement. No mention was made of the payment of Rs. 1 0,000 ,co ntprbmise. I suggested this payment to the Cpmpany only, as Mr. Packer thought the Company may prefer a money payment as a way out of these difficulties i 4 In dealing with the London Representative the Shaikh said that he had told me (Eolmes; that he was willing to defer the question of appointing a London Representative until the oil was produced in commercial quantities which time may be far ahead, and that he had yielded every point that the Political Requested and all the points I (Holmes) had asked him with this exception of the right to appoint such a person ^hen oil in commercial quantities is produced*. T He complained that Holmes had persuaded him to forego the demand for a drilling programme and now he (Holmes) aske me to forego my fight to a London Representative. Finally he told me that he would give me his decision within a week, as he had to consult with his family and others. P During our talk much transpired which has the bearing on the Shaikh’s attitude. A few days ago, he said, that he (Shaikh) had received a rude message from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and that the latter was claiming more and more trrritory which belonged to the Shaikhdom of Dubai; and added that there had been more trouble with his adjoining Rulers regarding boundaries, since the oil Options had been granted than for many years before, and now that oil Concessions are being negotiat ed, the trouble no doubt will increase. *4 So the position is actually as I have thought it to be and that is I have been negotiating not the Dubai Concession only, but at least two other Concession* at the same time, viz. Dubai, Sharjah and Ras al Khainah and mofet probably 2 others (Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain). When I asked the Shaikh of Sharjah on the lOJii of February 1937 whether I could discuss a Concession Agreement with him, he replied 'I would prefer for you far to first agree with the Shaikh of Dubai'*. 11 The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah visited Dubai last week 14/19th March. He called upon me on the evening of the 16th March and invited me to come and stay at Ras al Khairnah. He said, '*what you agree with Shaikh Asi’d I will agree with you'*. X2- On the 20th of March I visited the Shaikh of Umm al Qaiwain and submitted to him a Draft of an Option Agreement (a copy of which is enclosed). He said that, '*he may prefer to conclude a Concesion rather than grant an Option when the Company had concluded a Concession Agreement with the Shaikh of Dubai”. The/4 - &lt;7 7 n^/ 7 The Concession Agreements for Dubai, Shariah* Ajman, Umm al ^aiwain and Has al Khaimah have been prepared (mutatis mutandis) on the same lines as the Dubai Agreement • A copy of Dubai Draft Agreement IDSTC is attached. ^ Just before the Shaikh of Dubai largwy left my house on Monday the 22nd March, I pointed out to him that as he was delaying his decision for a week, would he give me an extension of the Option Agreement and assist me me to procure an extension from Shaikhs of Sharjah, and Rascal Khaimah, so as not to waste too much of the Option period of those Agreements which are near sucsubdbw expiry.

C/278-10/12 Dated the 14th April 1937• V, Will you kindly refer to our conversation on the 12th April 1937 about the activities on the Trucial Coast of Haji Yusuf Kanoo. 2. As you know the Trucial Coast has been full of the wildest rumours and intrigues in connection with oil, but it 4 is known to me that Yusuf Kanoo has written (l rather think usually through the medium of a clerk) to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, and probably others, in vague terms about help ing him in connection with oil. He also has a voluminous correspondence with Shaikh Mani ! bin Rashid of Dubai, who is very much against the Shaikh of Dubai. Sometime ago he advised me to give a good present to Shaikh Mani* (a piece of advice v/hich I ignored). He has also tried to insinuate into my mind ideas detrimental to some of our best friends on the Coast. He at one time visualised himself as the suc cessor to the late Residency Agent T s family and of course loathes our having a regular Residency Agent there. 3. It seems probable that Major Holmes will now get the Dubai Concession and so possibly the others, and in the cir cumstances I do not think that it is desirable to move against Haji Yusuf Kanoo, as he does produce a good deal of useful information and sometimes does useful work for us. It would, moreover, be a pity to antagonise him unnecessarily. Pourable Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 4/-4. If, however, anything goes wrong over the oil con cessions, I think that it would be a good thing to consider bringing financial pressure to bear upon Haji Yusuf Kanoo in the way in which we discussed in our talk.mmtm 9 STJ mm 86/7 ± £ {22?)

Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 69 dated the 1st April 1937 and to enclose reports from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, on the subject of alleged political intrigues by Haji Abdullah Y/illiamson and fur ther to enclose a letter addressed to me on the subject by the Shaikh of Dubai dated the 26th March 1937; letter from the local Manager of Petroleum Concessions Limited dated Bahrain, 10th April 1937 No. PCL/CAM1/S49 and a note on a conversation with Haji Abdullah Williamson dated the 10th May 1937. 2. It appears from reports from the Trucial Coast and from conversation with Haji Abdullah Williamson that he and Major Frank.Holmes are not on good terms. I be lieve that Haji Williamson is disappointed because he did not obtain the appointment now held by Ifeijor Holm es and would view failure to obtain Concessions on Major Holmes 1•~2— Holmes* part with pleasure. At the same time Major Holmes, who I think appreciates the Haji*s attitude, would not view an increase in influence by Haji 'William son with pleasure and would welcome and possibly assist in any endeavour to reduce such influence as he may have now. This state of affairs is unfortunate from every point of view and is much opposed to the interests of Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The^Shaikh of Dubai has not 'banned* Haji William son as asserted by the local Manager of Petroleum Con cessions Limited in his letter under reference^but has requested me to inform you that as the Haji has interest ed himself in local politics instead of confining his activities to his interpreting he wishes arrangements 4^ be made to replace him as he will not be responsible for his safety should he return to Dubai. I strongly suspect that this letter from the Shaikh has been en gineered by those opposed to the interests of Haji William son as he was at one time very nuch 'persona grata' with the Shaikh of Dubai. J can find no trace of previous in cidents of this type having happened as seems to be im plied by the Manager*s letter. 4. I have examined the treaty obligations of the Shaikh of Dubai and I can find no clause in any treaty relevant to the present circumstances. He is not hound contemplated agreement between the Shaikh and Petroleum Concessions Limited has been included to meet just such a situation as has now arisen, but naturally this cannot affect the present case until the Concession has been to admit persons to his territory. signed*1 5. I suggest that the letter from the Shaikh of Dubai be duly acknowledged and he be requested to in form us more fully regarding his charge against Haji Williamson. I further suggest that the local Manager of Petroleum Concessions Limited be informed in answer to his letter under reference that the case is being investigated. 6. As Haji Abdullah Williamson has left the Trucial Coast and does not contemplate returning until after the hot weather I would prefer that the suggested letter to the Shaikh be deferred until after the signature of the Concession when it will be possible to act under Article 10 of the Concession. I have the honour to be. 9 / Sir, Your most obedient servant. Enclosures:- Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain. 2 3 4 1. Telegram No.257 dated 2?th March 1937 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah.

He stated that Major Holmes had done all that he could to discredit him with the Trucial Shaikhs and that his object in doing this was because he was afraid that should he. Major Holmes, fail to obtain the oil concessions that he, Haji Williamson, would be appointed to continue the negotiations and that Holmes v/ould be dismissed. (2) Haji Abdullah conplained that Khan Sahib Abdur i R e zzaq had not been treating him properly and had been informing the Shaikhs that Haji Abdullah was not the accredited representative of the Oil Company but was their interpreter.

Glynn Jones, Geologist, and Ha^i A.F,Williamson. In addition there were two Indian drivers and one personal servant recruited in India, one Indian cook re cruited in Bahrain, on e Iraqi, one labourer a subject of Bahrain and an average of five other permanent servants engaged at Dubai, Guards were provided by the Rulers of the various States visited, the number employed being solely at the discretion of the Ruler concerned. Tem porary labourers were also recruited locally as required. Dubai, where a house had been taken by the Company for this purpose. In addition a base camp was set up at Abu Dhabi during the period when the party was engaged in this State. The general procedure was to make trips lasting a few days from the base, taking a light camp outfit along in the cars. For instance, two 1rips of a few days duration were made in Sharjah Territory, one expedition Field Season 1936-1957 during General method of working . The Headquarters of the party were established at to/--2- to Ras al Khaimah of a week, and several Irips in Dubai State, On each of these occasions the party was accont- panied either by the Ruler himself or by his personal re presentative. In the state of Abu Dhabi, expeditions were made to Biraimi, lasting about fourteen days, and down the - . '■ * • - ^ivmni I,»I.iii'tiii' imam m+urnimitimmmmnmn w coast as far as Jebel Odaid, in all of some four weeks duration, in addition to short day trips. Throughout the area examined, transportation was effected by car, but during the trip to Biraimi, the heavier camp gear, petrol supplies, etc., were sent by camel caravan. Launches were used also, heavy camp out - fit being sent to Ras al Khaimah by this means, and two launches were used for the work along the Abu Dhabi coast line, Communications with Dubai for mails, food, and water supplies were also maintained by launch. On one occasion only did the party fail to reach its destination by car. This occurred on attempting to travel by car from Abu Dhabi to Jebel Dhanna. An im passable sabkha was reached some 40 miles West of Abu Dhabi. This obstacle necessitated the party*s re turning to Dubai in order to travel down to Jebel Dhanna by launch, the cars being taken in the same way. Area Examined . A reconnaissance was made of the whole of the States of Ras al Khaimah and Dubai. The Sharjah terri tory was examined to the base of the Oman Mountain Range, with the exception of the Jebel Faiyah area which was politically inaccessible. W r ithin the confines of the Abu Dhabi State the Biraimi Oasis was visited and a strip along the whole of the coastline up to Jebel Odaid, some 10 miles deep, was mapped. In addition. Sir Bini Yas, Dalmah/-3- Dalmah, Yasat and numerous of the other smaller low- lying islands along the coast line, were studied. Although the Sheikhdom of Ajman was not official ly visited, a few journeys were made across the State en route to Ras al Khaimah, etc., sufficient to give a gene ral idea of geological conditions. Geological Results. It is not possible yet to give any conclusions of a geological nature as the final report must await the results of the examination of the various samples collect ed, It will be submitted to the Company in due course. Further work. Definite information regarding future w r ork in the area under consideration is not yet available, pen ding discussion with London Office, but it may be pointed out that the whole of the State of Abu Dhabi has not so far been examined, and furthermore, Jebel Faiyah area should be mapped. Whether or not this work will be undertaken during the next field season, it is premature to state. Dated at Bahrain. May 11th. 195 7. Sd/- Thos.T.Williamson Sd/- D. Glynn Jones.CONFIDENTIAL.

Shaikh of Debai on return to Debai was immediately subjected by Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah to consider able pressure not to sign concession but to wait and give it to Americans. This is undoubtedly due to underground intrigues which California Arabian Standard Oil Company nave been carry ing on. 2. Under my instructions Political Agent Bahrain visited Trucial Coast where Holmes suggested that words 'buy or' and 'purchase or' should be deleted from Article 13 (a) of draft concession. I approved of this and concession was signed on 22nd May by Shaikh of Dibai and Holmes as representative of the Company and attested by the Political Agent. All letters connected with Agreement (vide India Office letter P.2.7856/36 dated 2nd December 1936) except (a) that conveying approval of His Majesty 1 s Government to agreement and (b) intimation of Company^ acceptance of arrangements were exchanged. 3. On 23rd May Holmes informed Political Agent that on the night of the 22nd he had received a telegram from the Company saying that they could not authorise him to sign concession unless Article 13 (a) stood as previously drafted and /and added that Shaikh was willing to make the change# 4. I telegraphed Political Agent that change could be made if shaikh agreed but that if he did not agree concession should stand as signed and that letter (a) should issue to Shaikh. shaikh did not agree to change and Political Agent issued letter (a). 5. This was obviously the only action possible# The Shaikh was entirely within his rights in refusing to alter the concession, and any attempt to bring pressure to bear on him to do so would have given him the opportunity of cancelling the concession altogether, which he might not have been sorry to ta^ce# 6. Hhole conduct of Debai negotiations on part of Company and Holmes have been unsatisfactory and that Shaikh has signed concession is due as much to his personal promise to me as to any efforts on the part of the Company. Holmes has been most dilatory and I have good evidence that Haj i Williamson also employed by the Company on the Trucial Coast has been intriguing on behalf of California Arabian Standard Oil Company and against Shaikh of Debai who has asked that he should not be allowed back in Debai territory. 7. Five other Trucial Coast Shaikhs have still to grant concessions particularly Sharjah and Has al Khaimah whose options expire respectively on 26th September and 1st August. Holmes has informed Political Agent that he will now approach Shaikhs of Has al Khaimah and Sharjah but Political Agent under stands that agreements for these Shaikhs are not yet finally drafted. If this is so I cannot understand Company^ and/or Holmesi /Holmes* inefficiency in not having these ready, especially as Holmes gave me to understand that directly Debai concession was ( signed he was prepared to negotiate with the other Shaikhs* In the meantime I am urging Holmes through Political Agent to approach these Shaikhs immediately on lines of Debai concession. 8. Holmes has told Political Agent that he is asking Company to relieve him as soon as possible as he is unwell* 9 # I venture to suggest that Company’s headquarters in London be approached on the following lines with these Shaikhs forthwith (c) it is obvious that Holmes cannot with his Trucial Coast preoccupations proceed to Muscat and that another representative should be sent there immediately, (in this connection see your Express letter No.P.Z.3099 dated the 11th May). I suggest for Muscat My lies who is a first rate man and who got the qatar concession. 10« What it comes to is that unless the Company bestir themselves there is a distinct danger of the remaining Trucial Arabian Standard Oil Company or by American-Italian interests vide my Express letter No.c/l07 of 1st May# - Britconsul. (®opy sent to G.of India, Bahrain and Muscat under P.L.No*388-S of 25/5/37). (a) unsatisfactory nature of their conduct of negotia tions up to date should be impressed on them with a view to their displaying more activity in the future (b) that they should telegraph immediately to Holmes giving terms of Sharjah and Has al Khaimah con cessions and directing him to pursue negotiations Coast Shaikhdoms and of Muscat being captured by the California !Telegram From To R. 17.

As things did not seem to be go^ng well, some six weeks ago I wired for the shaikh of Dibal and /{olraes to meet me at Bahrain, which they did. Though the Shaikh would not sign the Concession on the spot I succeeded in extracting from him a personal promise that he would sign it within a fortnight of his return to his Shaikhdom.
