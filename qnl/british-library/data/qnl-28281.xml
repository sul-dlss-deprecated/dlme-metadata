Subject.Slat May, 1938 It. 200 (498/3/38). -tj*- 1 M uw'W*** - •'%V v ^ Sir, I have the honour to report that, on the 17th May, the Shah formally opened the tunnel through the Candovan Pass on the Chalous road from Tehran to the Caspian Sea. 2. This tunnel, which is 2,060 yarcs in length, pierces the pass at an altitude of over 8,800 feet, and shortens the mountain road by eight miles. The cost of the tunnel, which was started early in 1935, is stated to be Rials 24,853,400 or approximately £310,000 at the official rate of exchange. 3. It is claimed that the tunnel will make circulation over the Chaloua road possible all the year round, but as the entrance and exit are apparently above snow level, the road is still liable to be blocked in raid-winter, but no doubt every effort will be made to keep this ’'special road” (Rahi l akhsouB) open. The road itself was commenced in the spring of 1932, and was officially opened by the Shah on the 1st leoember, 1933. It is the shortest route from the capital to the Caspian Sea, terminating at the port of Ho Sh&amp;hr. I am sending a oopy of this despatch to the department of Overseas Trade. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Tour Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servant ( 'tu ) ■ * evi le But1er _Secret 3 ^e 1 Extract from Meshed Intelligence Summary No.2, for the period ending 31st March 1934. 2. It is stated that the pack road between CURB ADAM and MOHAMMEDABAD North of KUCHAN is to be made fit for motor traffic. The journey has been performed by car but the road is narrow and extremely dangerous in places being cut out of the side of a precipice. This proposal has been made on other occasions, but up to date nothing has come of it. This time it is said construction is definitely to be undertaken. The road will be fit for motor traffic in five months’ time. Its total length from where it leaves the KUCHAN- BAJGIRAN road will be about 44 miles. It will be continued from MOHAMMEDaBAD to LUTEABAD on the Soviet frontier and thence to the Railway station of ARTIQ a distance of only a mile over the frontier. It is said that the Bolsheviks are very dissatisfied with the proposal since it will short circuit ASKHABAD and be disadvantageous to them.fz. igol 33 ££l Hoads. Construction on the new road linking the capital with the Caspian Sea via the Fverej and Chains valleys, which was suspended during the winter months, has now recommenced, and it is expected that work will be completed m two months.J-X.
