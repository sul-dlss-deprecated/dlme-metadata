From—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with my commu- &lt; 30 R f l d ?JA 0 w 0reign Department, telegram No. nication marginally cited on the subiect 89, dated 14th January 1913. of the Qf ^ ^ &amp; fact0] , arms traffic problem. 2. After some days’ delay owing to bad weather at sea, and heavy rain aS ^’. W , h l Cl i n ' ad , e U difflcult for camels *0 travel, I effected a meeting with Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his son, Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim, Governor 0 -ii ?r a i ’ 011 the February, and discussed the position frankly and fully with them. * ^ , ,, .^ e bastion for them is merely one of price. Shaikh Jasim, who did the talking, his son merely echoing him, said that he fully appreciated the con siderations which obliged the British Government to seek to suppress the Arms iraflic and expressed his abstract desire to co-operate with and satisfy them in this, as m other matters affecting their interests. He then went on to explain his own position in the matter. The following is the condensed purport of some two hours’ discussion which ensued. . Sffinldi Jasim said that he recognized that the British Government were in a position to do what they pleased in the direction of the seizure of arms m transit by sea and he accepted that position; but that in point of fact most ot the arms which reached Katar came either by land all the wav, or merely ci ossed from the Trucial Coast, and that once in Katar, although he was not prepared to say that some might not pass across the Gulf, most 'of them went to supply the Arab market. He estimated that in the last year his dependents had made a profit out of them of not less than Rs. 50,000. He continued that he was not m a practical position to compel his tribesmen to accept at his hands the arbitrary extinction of this source of income, and that if he undertook to take that course in deference to our wishes, we must place him m a position to square his influential dependents and show them that he was receiving a fair quid pro quo which justified his compliance. At this stage I repeated the argument which I had already explained to him, that our mam reason for asking him to execute this prohibition was not with a view to preventing his Arabs from supplying their legitimate needs but to enable us to deal with fraudulent exporters from Maskat, whose real object was to export arms to the Persian Coast and who made use of any loophoffi or colourable pretext for passing the arms out of Maskat. I continued that Shaikh Mubarak among others had made no difficulty in executing such a document and had asked for no payment for it. Shaikh that m sSh e tr, h v r te ' nderst00 l d begged me to remember that Shaikh Mubarak derived so much substantial advantage from our support in other ways that he was more than repaid for any co-operation he might have afforded us m that dmectmn. He added that it was only our protection which had saved Mubarak from being “ eaten up ” long ago by the Turks and had made it P osslb le for him to enjoy the income from his Shat-el-Arab properties unmolested. He ^ himself (Shaikh Jasim) was quite differently situated, and we had done nothing of a like nature for him. AbA'rf 6 him S 3 ! !, h , ad 1 sent m &gt;’ representative, Khan Sahib Haii .). ak &gt; hls son,(Abdullah, last year to discuss with him the issue of a prohibition on the basis of a cash payment and an annual allowance from Government hoc, but that in reply Abdullah had asked me to believe that ^ was doing his best to co-operate with Government, when required, in keeping away dhows carrying arms and that as, consequently, no arms were coming in worth 86 t0 be Called fOT - 1 had ‘ aken this for what it was not h Jasin Y e P lied ^at the offer then made was not adequate; he did not wish for a cash present but for a regular allowance of a substantial nature. i U2 sufficient to compensate his people and himself for loss of income: he would also need facilities for obtaining his own requirements from the Maskat ware house on payment with our concurrence. Invited to specify the amount which he would ask for, he replied Jls. 25,000 per annum, i.e., half the sum which was at present being made out of the trade, plus permission to import annually 2,000 rifles with the necessary ammunition ; this number he eventually reduced to 1 , 000 . I held up my hands at the mention of Rs. 25,000 and said that it was an excessive figure and that nothing of this kind had been dreamed of by Govern ment ; I continued that if such a subsidy as that were in question, Government would surely consider that something more was due from him than the mere issue of a prohibition against the import of arms, such as co-operation in the suppression of piracy and the slave trade. He rejoined that so far as he was concerned, he always adhered to the spirit of the agreement which had subsisted between his father and Government and was quite ready to consider the u extension of the present agreement on the lines above indicated if necessary. I said that that contingency had not been contemplated in the present connec tion and I had no authority to discuss it with him authoritatively, but I was nevertheless interested to know his own feelings and views on the subject. I again endeavoured to separate the question of the traffic in arms by sea and that by land as far as discretion would allow, but he repeated that we were at liberty to do what we liked by sea, his dependents being aware that we ruled the waters of the Gulf, hut that he could not issue any public prohibition w ithout its coming to their knowledge and without being placed in a position to gild the pill for their consumption. 4. Having arrived at this point there was little more to be said and after partaking of their sumptuous hospitality I left their camp for the coast at Lusail, some three hours’ ride by camel, Shaikh Jasim insisting on accompany ing me himself. I may mention that I found him in wonderful health, better in fact than when I last met him 7 or 8 years ago ; and he seems likely to last . for some years longer. | 5. I think we may assume that the figure (Rs. 25,000 per annum) mentioned by Shaikh Jasim is probably about double that which he would ultimately accept, but he seemed to have considered matters fully before we met, and l doubt if he could be brought by amicable negotiations to issue a prohibition for 1 a less subsidy than Rs. 1,000 per mensem. 6 . Though it is doubtless convenient to have brought the Katar Shaikhs out into the open as regards the Arms Traffic and to know’ precisely what their attitude of mind is, the result of my interview’ leaves us, so far as concerns the difficulty of the French Flag and the contingency of a direct trade in foreign bottoms, much where w’e were when Foreign Office despatch of December 15th to the India Office w’as w’ritten, except that we now know more precisely what the first alternative course, therein mentioned, w’ould cost us. Thus, I find it a little difficult to make definite recommendations for present action, as so much hinges on the state and ultimate prospects of our current negotiations with the Porte; but I venture to record my ideas on the data now available, in case they may assist Government in coming to a decision. On the one hand, if the Maskat negotiations with France go through, the leakage of any considerable numbers of arms and ammunition from Oman to Katar, either by land or vid the Trucial Coast, will gradually cease and all w’e shall have to fear will be a direct trade to A1 Rida in foreign vessels. After what he has just said to me regarding British control of the waters of the Gulf, I doubt if Shaikh Jasim w'ould dare to encourage such an enterprise and if a case occurred the location of one of His Majesty’s Ships at A1 Rida w ould no doubt bring him to heel. In these circumstances it is a question for consideration whether it would be worthwhile committing ourselves to subsidize Shaikh Jasim indefinitely at Rs. 1,000 a month, or more, for an arms prohibition alooe. i. On the other hand, even £1,000 a year, though a considerable sum, when regarded as a subsidy to Shaikh Jasim, is a trifle as a contribution to the payment of a heavy bill for coal, or the subsidization of one of His Majesty’sShips; and if in addition to an arms prohibition we could obtain from Shaikh Jasim a satisfactory undertaking on the lines of the Trucial Coast agreements, and in which he would also agree to receive a Residency Agent at Rohah and admit and protect British Indian traders there, it might be worth Government’s while to pay the amount; but the political aspect of such an agreement is obviously anomalous, if concurrent with the maintenance of a Turkish garrison at A1 Bida, and from that point of view it is on the question of our settlement of issues with the Porte, that the decision of Government must mainly turn. In this connection I recall the correspondence ending with Foreign Department endorsement No. 1432-E. B, dated 17th April 1905. With the above observations I beg to commit the subject for consideration. j* * ISda it ' v. 6 FEB ^13 Telegram-P., dated (and received) the 6th January 1913.

He now considers that situation has so far changed that proposal would be accepted without irritation. Would the Government of India approve my suggesting to Minister that Persian Govern ment be invited in view of the lively traffic at present going on with the Upper Persian Coast to request Sultan either direct or through us to expel in con sultation with British Agent, Maskat, any Persians visiting Maskat for the purchase of arms and not possessing a no objection certificate from responsible Persian authorities.Telegram P., No. Ill, dated the 18th (received 19th) January 1913.

All responsible for jurisdictions on littoral of Gulf of Oman and Persia with the exception of Katar have notified the prohibitions against imports of arms and ammunition. Notification by Sultan that no transhipment of arms and ammunition in his territorial waters to any of these prohibited jurisdictions except on production of an explicit license from the Government concerned would be allowed. It would seem necessary for Sultan in order to place his administration on a proper footing in this respect to issue rules on the lines as far as applicable of sections 6 and 10 of the Indian Arms Act of 1878 and of Chapter 12 of the Sea Customs Act of 1878. If the rules already issued are legal, there would seem to be nothing in action suggested above incompatible with Article 6 of the British and Article 10 of the Prench Commercial Treaty with Maskat. Should the arms dealers make use of Katar loophole for defeating above rules, we should have strong justification for forcing Shaikh of Katar to issue a prohibition or for taking other measures to regulate Katar difficulty, regard- . _ . , v M ing which please see my letter! of 27th X SeriHl No. 63. -.y 1 oon o ultimo, No. 2818. 128 Telegram P., No. 1341, dated the 21st (received 22nd) November 1912.

In regard to the third course, Sir ih Grey v/ould prefer to adopt it only in the last resort, since it might provoke a re tort from the Turkish Government that they are willing to sup press the arms traffic in El Katr, but that they are prevented from doing so owing to the reluctance of His Majesty’s Govern ment to allow the firm establishment of Turkish administration in that region* Sir E.

Two large dhows belonging to Tangistan en route from Maskat to Tangistan ports were captured on the high seas near Has Musandam on 11th July by His Majesty’s Ship “Fox”. Each vessel had about 200 rifles and large quantity of ammunition carefully concealed and carried no flag or papers. They have been taken to Jask by Senior Naval Officer who asks for instructions and suggests the despatch of crews to Bushire and the destruction of the dhows and arms and ammunition. 1 support proposal as regards arms and ammunition and dhows, but I strongly deprecate sending of crews to Bushire under our auspices. Such a course would inevitably result in useless correspondence with Persian authorities and probable demands for delivery of arms. I recommend that crews be set at liberty at Jask or Maskat and allowed to go where they like. If Persian authorities should then make any enquiries, we /could reply that two dhows w ithout flags or papers and with arms and ammunition concealed on board were recently captured and both dhows and the arms have been destroyed.

Please refer to your telegram* No. 413 S. of 11th July. The head of the Thani family is Sheikh Jasim, w ho must • Serial No. 31. be nearly 90 years of age: he is practi cally a recluse. Abdulla, his eldest surviving son, rules at Doha and Abdur Bahman the younger son at Wakra. It is difficult to speak positively but, as at present advised, I think it probable that any arrangement wffiich we might come to with Abdulla would be endorsed by his father and accepted by his younger brother. I think it possible that w r e might secure the agreement for a substantial cash present to Abdulla, without any subsidy, but I think subsidy would be useful as a means of preserving touch and influence. I should suggest Its. 1,000 per annum for Abdulla, and Rs. 500 for Abdur Rahman, and possibly Rs. 1,000 for Sheikh Jasim. In event of my being authorised to attempt to obtain agreement and in case a bribe became necessary (to) render Abdulla amenable, it would be convenient if Government would consider the figure which they w ould think it worth while to give, perhaps Rs. 5,000 would suffice.26 40 Telegram, No. 663, dated (and received) the 16th July 1911.

He also produced Nakhoda’s acknow ledgment. He was informed that orders had been already issued regarding this case, hut that he could proceed to Jask and interview Senior Naval Officer and show him his papers if he cared to do so. Senior Naval Officer saw no sufficient cause for going back on his instructions, and I consider that he was right, for in the first place it is conceivably possible that letter to Nakhoda might have been specially written with a view*to subsequent production as evi dence of innocence, and secondly, it would have had bad effect to have released dhow or cargo. She was burnt on 27th May and Senior Naval Officer estimated value of dhow as Rs. 12,500 and the value of cargo destroyed at Rs. 17,120. A brother of the Katar owner has now come here bearing letters to me from Shaikh of Kuwait and Shaikh Abdalla Bin Jasim of Doha; former says he has satisfied himself of bond fides of statement of Katar owner and asks for clement treatment for him; latter writes long and friendly letter going into all the circumstances and saying the fault lay entirely with Kuwait Nakhoda and urges that it is great miscarriage of justice that guilty Kuwait Nakhoda should escape altogether, while innocent owner should suffer such heavy loss. He concludes by saying that owner is nearly related to and that owner’s loss is his own and appeals to proverbial equity and sense of justice of British Govern ment to give relief. 41 Telegram P., No. 664, dated (and received) the 16th July 1911. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. In continuation of my immediately preceding telegrams.* The letter •serial No 39 . ^ roin Shaikh Abdulla affords a natural . . opening for discussing arms traffic with mm which, I think, it might be well in any case to utilise. On the one hand, while maintaining complete justifiability of our action in regard to guilty dhows, we might say that out of regard for the Shaikh and on condition that he executes prohibition, we are prepared to deliver to him a sum of money as a compassionate grant for the Katar owner. On the other hand, if we should turn an altogether deaf ear to his present appeal, it is obvious that we must relinquish hope of obtaining prohibition or other form of co-operation on his part. Please let me know which alternative commands itself to Government; if the former, up to what figure would Government be prepared to go by way of compassionate grant ? I should not think that it would he of any use to offer less than Rs. 5,000. The Shaikh’s representative will be leaving here on 22nd instant, and if your answer not received by then, I will send him a colourless ad interim reply.

Please refer to Cox’s letter No. 1660, of loth June, forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter of 6th July. Alter further communication with Cox, we consider it desirable to proceed with question of coming to an arrangement with Katar Chiefs to prevent aims traffic on that coast, holding over for the present Cox’s proposal regarding the tract between Ojair and the Katar coast. \Y r e propose :— (1.) To authorise Cox to endeavour to induce the Katar family to notify the prohibition of the import of arms by sea into their territories. (2-) ^ffer subsidies of Us. 1,000 a year to Sheikh Abdullah, the eldest son of Sheikh Jasim, who rules at Doha, and Us. 500 a year to Abdul Uahinan, the youngest son, who rules at VY akra ; also Us. 1,000, if necessary, to Sheikh til Jasim, the head of lhani family, who however is nearly ninety years of age, and is practically a recluse. (3.) Lhat Cox be authorised to pay a sum not exceeding Us. 5,000 to Sheikh Abdullah, if he finds that a present is necessary to induce him to come to terms. An excellent opportunity has offered itself for taking up this question. In connection with destruction of dhow in March last, captured by armed launch “Miner” (see correspondence ending with telegram to 1 olitical Pesident in Persian Gfulf, dated 18th April, forwarded with Secretary s letter No. 17 M, of 20th April 1911), the Katar owner of the dhow has gone to Hushire with letter from Sheikh Abdullah of Doha, representing that employment of the dhow for arms traffic was the delib erately disobedient act of nakhoda. Abdullah writes that the Katar owner is nearly related to himself, and appeals to us to give some relief. We think that opportunity should not be lost, and propose, while maintaining the complete justifiability of our action in regard to guilty dhow, to authorise Cox to pay Us. 5,000 through Sheikh Abdullah as a compassionate grant to the Katar owner of the dhow, on condition that Sheikh issues the prohibition we desire. We should be glad ot instructions as early as possible on these proposals.'I Telegram P., No. 115—224 M., dated the 27th Frcnc—The Secretaiy to the Goverrmert of Jrdia in the Marire rtpartmcBt, Simla, Tc—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 1 have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter received from the No. C.- 40 , dated the 21 st June 1911. Political Agent, Kuwait, in which he voices a report, persistently current in Kuwait, to the effect that Doha and Wakra, in Katar, are now regular arms depots. 2 Experience has taught me to treat with reserve the reports emanating from ihe bazaar of one Gulf port regarding the ill-behaviour of another, but in this case we have a good deal of circumstantial evidence in corroboration. Eirstly, the evident attention being paid of late by Goguyer and the Maskat gang to Katar, instanced by the case of the dhow “ hateh-el-Khair MaS S S and, secondly, by repeated reports reaching me from the Customs authorities and others here regarding the present brisk ness of the arms smuggling industry in the Tangistan ports. This accumula tive evidence leads me to think that Captain Shakespear’s information is probably w r ell founded. It will be seen from paragraph lojf ^ x Serial No. 163, Part vin. i 0 th May, to the Government of India, that reports in a similar sense have also been reaching His Excellency. 3 The general question of our relations with the Porte in regard to various problems affecting both Powers in the Gulf region mcluaing the status of Katar, has been so specifically “ sub judice ” lately that I ^ve hesitated to put forward any new suggestions in regard to items affected, but the p reports inevitably direct lively attention to the two weak links m the chain of arms prohibitions, represented by the Katar Peninsula and the un-earmarked coast-line south of Ojair, to which Bin Saood has access. 4 If there is no likelihood of our arriving in the near future at a give- and-take adjustments of interests with the Porte, 1 am inclined to think it might be possible, without introducing any political questions at all or involving the Katar familv in difficulties with the Turks, to get them, in return for a small subsidy to notify to their dependents and the public, a prohibition against the import of arms by sea, and to undertake, in case of the supply of their own re quirements, to import only in communication with our representative at Bahrain. The prohibition might not, it is true, be rigidly enforced by the Katar Shaikh, but the mere fact of its existence would eliminate one of the present loopholes, of which Messrs. Goguyer and others are now seeking to take advantage; for all arms under export to the Katar coast would then be con- traband. , 5 I do not forget that we should still be left with the one remaining weak 'link—the strip of coast south of Ojair, to which Bin Saood has access but assuming the political impracticability at present of asking Bin Saood to issue a similar prohibition to his dependents, the status of that strip of coast seems sufficiently uncertain and nndefinable to make it possible for us to treat it as coast covered either by the prohibition of Bahrain or that of Katar. There would then be no hiatus throughout the perimeter of the Gulf, and any consignment leaving Maskat, uncovered by a pass, would be seizable at si/ht as contraband, and the difficulty which at present exists of dealing with duows under the Trench flag landing arms on the Katar coast, would then be greatly diminished. 6. It is worth noting that in practice the Katar Shaikhs tacitly rec °g' nize and make no attempt to question our right to seize arms under ® S P°‘ . their coast, and it is only vis a vis the Trench Government and the public that our action has no basis of authority.7. Pei’liaps the Government of India will think fit, in view of Captain Shakespear’s present report, to take into consideration the practical possibilities of the courses which J have ventured to suggest. No. C.—40, dated Kuwait, the 21st June 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your telegram words 75—10, dated the 10th June 1911, I have the honour to forward, for information, copy of a letter to the Political Agent, Maskat, which refers to the same consignment of which further parti culars were furnished to me by Major Knox in a later telegram. 2. In this connection and with reference to my letter No. C.—79, dated • See letter fro-n Re.ident te Depart- the 20th December 1«10,* I have the ment, No. 58, dated 7th January i9 11 . honour to report that it is persistently p. z. cox. stated in Kuwait that Doha and Wak'a in Katar are now regular arms depots. The arms and ammunition reach these places partly by caravan and partly by small fishing boats working along the coast from the vicinity of Abu Thabi, The boats used are very small and usually travel at night, spending most of the day anchored close in shore or even beached in one or other of the hays. As evidence of the stock in Katar I was informed by Shaikh Mubarak that Bin Saood whilst encamped near Hasa received a few w r eeks ago 12 boxes of ammunition (1,500 rounds each) from Doha; whilst from Bin Saood’s own messenger I heard that the quantity received was 10 camel-loads, probably 30 or 40 boxes. I am also informed that a very considerable trade is done in arms smuggling between Katar and the Persian coast between Lingah and Bushire. No C.—39, dated Kuwait, the 21st June 1911 (Confidential). From—C aptain W. H. I. Shakespkar, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat. With reference to your telegram Words 96—12, dated the 12th June 1911, advising me of the shipment of arms concealed in cargo carried by the S. S. “ Bulimba ”, I have the honour to inform you that the telegram wns received just as the vessel steamed into the port. I was able, however, to communicate its contents to Shaikh Mubarak before the lighters reached the shore and requested him to have the suspected cargo carefully searched before delivery. 2. The Shaikh informs me that he had all cargo from Maskat placed under lock as soon as landed and himself saw it opened out in the Customs house on the same evening. No arms nor ammunition were found in any of the packages, in spite of a most thorough search. I do not think it was possible for the packages to have been tampered with before the Shaikh himself ordered their opening in his presence, and am inclined to think that the information received by you may possibly have been purposely disseminated as a ruse. The ship’s manifest, moreover, furnishes figures different to those contained in your telegram. The manifest shows the following to have been shipped from Maskat for Kuwait:— 6 Bundles Dry Limes, mark T. P., shipped by S. C. Agmizian (alias “ Nishan ”) 27 „ „ „ M.K. „ H. A. Suliman. 8 „ Cotton ,, A B.A. ,, M. Ahmed. 1 „ Rose-leaves „ A.B A. „ M. Ahmed. There were no bundles of “ goat-hair ” in the cargo for Kuwait. 3. The consignees are not yet known for certain as delivery of these packages has not been asked for up to date, probably through fear arising from the Shaikh's search; Shaikh Mubarak, however, informs me that part of the goods are for one Mulla Abud and part for the Murafi house, both Persian firms. Hitherto I have had no confirmation from the bazaar that any arms were expected by this vessel or that if shipped they have been surreptitiously passed. 4.

It is considered inexpedient by His Majesty’s Government that any arms whatever landed from French dhows should be seized in neighbourhood of the coast; at all events until they are landed in such quantities as to place the success of the blockade in danger. Such seizures might cause questions to be raised of our right to seize arms in Persian territory, though they may be technically justifiable. Accordingly, instructions should be communicated to the Admiral to this effect. Ends. The necessary instructions will no doubt be issued by Your Excellency. 24 Telegram, No. 89, dated the 8th October 1910 (Confidential). From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron Diyatalawa, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department.

I have the honour to refer to the statement issued by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in Chief showing “the powers of His Majesty’s ships to search vessels suspected of being engaged in the traffic in arms,” a copy of • semi Ho. 243 . Part v. which was received under Poreign Depart ment endorsement* No. 1830 E.-A., dated the 27th August 1910.I * v 17 2. It te noted that reference is not made therein to the territorial waters of the trocial chiefs, the reason being that we have no specific authority from those chiefs in respect of their waters. It is, therefore, a question for the consideration of Government whether or not we should ask the Shaikhs to give us a written delegation of the necessary authority. I personally incline to the view that the Shaikhs would expect us to take the authority for granted, and would he somewhat surprised at our asking for it, and that until the necessity for some delegation is made practically apparent, Bis Majesty’s ships might, when occasion arises, so take it for granted—as was done to some extent at Behai on the occasion referred to in telegram No. 681, dated the 14th October 1908, addressed to the Foreign Bepartment and myself, by the Political Agent, Maskat. I shall he glad, however, to he favoured with the views of the Government of India and their instructions, if necessary, on the point in question. 26 No. 2129 E.-A., dated Simla, the 11th October 1910 (Confidential).

Questions discussed include whether the Trucial Chiefs' commitment to end illegal arms trafficking in 1902 extended to the British Government, and whether the existing permissions given by Trucial Chiefs to the British Government to patrol territorial waters would permit them to stop and search vessels;The position of Katr [Qatar] and a possible agreement between the British Government and the Chiefs of Katr, particularly the Bin Thani [Āl Thānī] family, to make the trafficking of arms illegal in Katr.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Doha</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Katr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027673310.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
