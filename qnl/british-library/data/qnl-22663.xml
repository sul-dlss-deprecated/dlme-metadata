With reference to paragraph 536, Regulations for the Mili tary Engineer Services, as a normal rule payments on account of pre-audit bills and other bills for which payment is requisi tioned by letter (as distinct from telegraphic demands) will be made by the Controller of Military Accounts direct to contrac tors’ bankers by means of crossed cheques. In all such cases the bills should be receipted and stamped where necessary by the contractors concerned before cheques m payment thereof are actually issued. 2. In cases, however, where the contractor has no bankii% account, or where advances are demanded by telegram, payments will continue to be made by an open cheque through the Garrison Engineer. 3.

In order to obtain an advance passage for his family in these circumstances, it is necessary that the soldier should make a wiitten application, for it.

The Finance Department have had under consideration the ques tion whether temporary service rendered in the Indian Munitions Board or the Board of the Industries and Munitions should count for pension under Article 370, Civil Service Regulations in the case of persons transferred therefrom to other Departments of the Govern ment of India, etc. In view of the fact that among the activities of the Board were certain functions previously performed by Depart ments of the Government of India, etc., and that on the dissolution of the Board, those functions were re-transferred to the Departments, the Governor General in Council has decided that the requn-f'' ments of Article 370 would be satisfied in cases which fulfil tm following conditions :— (i) that there was no essential change of duties on transfer ; (ii) that service in the appointment held immediately on transfer from the Board was one qualifying for pen sion ; and (iii) that there was no break between the service rendered in the Board and the service in the departments qualify ing for pension. 2. The undersigned is to request that persons concerned who satisfy the above conditions should be allowed to count their conti nuous temporary service in the Board for pension. 14913 265. Eligibility of non-superior officers for passage concessions consequent on change of domicile after first appointment. Finance Department letter No. F. 4 (25)-R.

A case has come to the notice of the Government of India in which a woman in Government service who was of non-Asiatic domicile at the time of her appointment and was admitted to the passage concessions for non-superior officers of non-Asiatic domi cile married a person of Asiatic domicile. The question has arisen whether she still retains her non-Asiatic domicile and the benefit of the passage concessions resulting therefrom or whether she has acquired the domicile of her husband thus losing the passage concessions. 2. Under rule 7 of the rules for the determination of the domi cile of an officer contained in Appendix B to Schedule IV to the Superior Civil Services Rules, a woman after marriage acquires the domicile of her husband, if she had not the same domicile before and her domicile during marriage follows the domicile of her husband. According to this rule the Government servant in question has acquired her husband’s domicile which is Asiatic. On the other hand, it may be inferred from Regulation 2 (h) of the Passage Regulations in Schedule IV of the Superior Civil Services Rules that domicile at the time of appointment is the proper criterion. Further, under Rule 3 of the rules regulating the grant of Over seas Pay and Rule 75-B of the Fundamental Rules, no Government servant who, after his appointment to a service or post acquires a new domicile, thereby loses his right to or becomes entitled to uni)verseas Pay or admission to the benefits of the special leave rules, the case may be. It is considered that the same principle should hold good in the rules regarding the grant of passage concessions to non-superior officers of non-Asiatic domicile and the Governor General-in-Council is therefore, pleased to decide that no officer, who after his or her appointment to a service or post acquires a new domicile, shall thereby lose his or her right to, or become entitled to, passage benefits. 266.

Dear Sir, Tv r e have received your letter of the 12th February, and whilst noting the attitude you have adopted concerning the payment of our bills, we cannot help but feel in view of our past business dealings with you, that you are not fully aware of the tremendous difficulties under which v/e are at present working at this port. In our letter of the 22nd October we briefly explained why the cases in question could not be sent to you earlier, and the reason why Port Trust charges had been paid. Having acted in your best interests and made somewhat heavy disbursements on your behalf, we regret to find that we have been called upon to await refund^ from the Port Authorities which now-a-days take anything up to six months before they are passed. The whole transaction was a most complicated one and we have a very voluminous file and whilst we do not wish to worry you with a lot of details, we can most earnestly assure you that in our capacity as Shipping Agents we did all that was possible at the time to trace the whereabouts of your cases and to send them forward by the first available steamer. Constant reminders are being sent to the Port Authorities for adjustment of dues but in view of the fore going, we would again request you to let us have a remittance in full settlement of our account.

I was away on tour in Sur but my indian assistart went for him in our car and brought him in. By the time T returned from Sur a few days ago he was almost fully recr red.

The position of the Political Agent here is much the same as that of a family doctor. He has no authority in the household while the family health is good, though much can be done by good advice at the appropriate time; his control commences at the onset of a disease and rises with the temperature of the patient. To make too many enquiries while the family is well is licuflo tv bo construed as interference and resented. Most people loath tc call in a doctor while they see hope of unaided recovery especially if a contributory cause of the indisposition is their own want of care. They are particularly unwilling to take their troubles to a locum tenens actiry^ for a short time and they prefer to mit, though the malady increase^, until their family friend and councellcr returns.

I am sorry to have to y/rite and tell you that as from tomorrow the 1?th instant the daily supply of ice which we have been sending you from Magwa, will no Ion. er be delivered. The reason is that all our Magwa British, Indian and Arab staff are being transferred, to Kuwait as from today and the ice machine will be shut down for the winter following the above move. Another reason is that with the closing down of Magwa as a residential area, we are also going to transfer the soda water machine and ice plant to our Kuwait office and this will all take time, as foundations for engine etc. will have to be prepared.

Usual EndingForm 7510 C.(9.40.) KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LIMITED. Telegrams Kuoco, Kuwait. KUWAIT Your Reference Our Reference D/0 87. My dear Hickinbo'tham, ARABIA 31st December 1942. Reference your D.0.No.1408 of 30*12.42, I am indeed sorry that you should have been put to trouble and inconvenience at Zubair on 29th December, by the stupid conduct of the driver of our Basra bazaar vanette. I do not think that the driver could possibly have intended a discourtesy to yourself, as he is one of the best charactered men the Company has, and has been with us since the Company started operations. He is an elderly Indian who has lived in Kuwait most of his life, and was making his first trip to Basra after a month's convalescent leave. He had been in hospital previous to that. I Actually, and acting on what you told me at Dr.Greenway's dinner party on the night of 30.12.42, I sent for the Driver as soon as he returned from Basra yesterday and asked him to explain his conduct. This was before I received your note under reference. The driver made the following statement to me which I think shows that he was partly the victim of bad luck. H 0n Monday, owing to late departure and rain, I reached Zubair at 5 P.M. I had with me as passenger the Company's Electrician Ismail Mohamed, who had been discharged and was to be conveyed to Shuaiba (place of his entertainment). By the time I had delivered my passenger and had left Shuaiba, it was 7 P.M. Between Shuaiba and Basra both of my lights failed and I had to spend the whole night on the side of the Bund road. In the morning (30.12.2f2) I drove into Basra, delivered a parcel to the British Red Cross authorities in Ashar and proceeded to Muftiyeh (R.O.C.Depot). Having handed over various parcel/s etc. and had some food, I set out for Ashar to purchase vegetables etc. etc. for various persons in Kuwait, but was held up for 2 hours just outside the oil depot by an overturned lorry which completely blocked the road. When I eventually got through to Ashar I first took my lorry to a Garage to have my lights seen to. At 3 P.M. and before I had made any bazaar purchases I got a message from the Pilling Station Clerk who told me that the P.A. Kuwait was anxious to get to Kuwait at once, and I asked if the P.A.would allow me to finish my work, make my purchases2 and come out at 7.30 A.M. next morning (30.12.42), I also asked if the P.A.could kindly phone and say where I should call for him. The reply I got from the Filling Station Clerk was that P.A.agreed to my delaying a night but would phone again. I received no other message, so completed my purchases and arrived at Zubair at 7.15 A.M. the next morning (30.12.2+2) after visiting the I.B.P. at 7 A.M. to enquire about a parcel for Mrs.Matheson. When I got to Zubair I was told that the P.A. had left by hired car the previous evening.' I have given the above statement in full, because the Driver is much distressed to think that he had put you to inconvenience and is anxious that you be made aware of his side of the story. May I at the same time assure you that neither the Company nor I would for a moment tolerate ary intentional discourtesy or lack of respect on the pant of any of our driving or other Staff towards yourself and should you consider the man’s explanation insufficient I am prepared to take further disciplinary action.

Usual EndingTranslation of letter dated 13th Moharram, 1362(30-1-43) from Rashid Betti al Maktoom, Sharja, to Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, I wish to offer Your Excellency my best wishes for the happy New Year, praying the Lord Almighty that this will be a year of peace and security for the humanity 7/hich has suffered and is still suffering different kinds of persecution and tyranny, and that the conflict will be ended by the complete victory to the Allies. When I review the Allies 1 progressive advance in all fronts and success attained by them, I believe that the hour of the final triumph is not very far off and that the peace and security will overshadow the world. This is what every free man wishes and prays for. While I was in Kuwait, I had the honour of visiting Your Excellency and had the chance to inform you of the accident I had. You were then not able to tell me the result as you had not received an/ reply from the Hon ! ble the Political Resident. It is now about a month since Saiyed Abdul Razzak, British Agent here, informed me that my things which were stolen from me had been recovered through the Hon’ble the Political Resident and had been sent to the Political Agency, Kuwait, according to my request. I wanted to communicate with Your Excellency but for some reasons I failed to do so. I beg Your Excellency to kindly let those two watches be sent to me by Air Mail, C/o the British Agent at Sharja and that ^the other shall never forget your kindness and assistance. Usual Ending.
