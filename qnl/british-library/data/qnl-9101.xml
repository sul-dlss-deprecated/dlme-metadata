Pelly also notes that as the Turcomans now possessed guns and Persian artillerymen they may be more inclined to press their advantage; before going on to discuss the situation along other borders, the possibility of the Shah's Government raising another army in the spring and their likely lack of resources to defend any position over the winter, Sultan Ahmed Khan's ability to protect the Eastern Frontier and making some suggestions on how the Persian frontiers could be defended over the winter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023882889.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
