Hig;h Btandard of Living:- The winter having been a record one both as to length and seve rity, spring has started very late. A poor harvest is generally expected; as most of the wheat sown * last autumn was ^jeopardised owing to the lack of rains at the right time and some was prop ably also damaged by the exceptionally long win- . ter* The sowings of the spring (a very late one) are by no means sa tisfactory. The prices of wheat and barley have therefore gone up. The price of bread was raised from Rials 8.80 to 3.20 per batman in April. Note bread cost 2.40 in the beginning of 1932; it was raised to 2.80 in the spring of 1932; and has now been raised to 3.20 i.e. a rose of 33 1/3% since the beginning of 1932. Fruits,vegetables etc.etc.will also be high in price this year owing to the terrible winter which is believed to have destroyed much of the crops; and to the extreme lateness of M spring'. Furthermore, the long v/inter caused a scarcity of fodder all over this Province and caused the death of a great number of agricultural and comestible animals. The result is that at present mutton is about ■ 80/(2 higher than it used to be at this time of the year previously. This has effected also the price of Ghee (melted butter) ,cheese etc. i which have been raised to exceptional levels. It is generally accep ted that all agricultural products - butter, milk,ghee, cheese, etc.etc - will be at least 30$ higher this year than last year. These rises of local products in addition to huge rises in impor ted goods - sugar,textiles etc.etc. - have raised the standard of livinj here very much compared with last year.~ i r iiUl.. rf r J , In any further communication on this subject, please quote *&lt;&gt;• K 6090/37/854 and address, not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

In his report on the proposed allowance His Majesty's Consul at Tabriz has offered the following explanations: The increased provision for heating is due to the severe and prolonged winter which has left him with no reserve of fuel for next winter, and has in fact necessitated the purchase of additional supplies of firewood for April of this year. The previous provision for lighting has proved to be inadequate, and the estimated telephone charge has been increased to meet a new item of 30 Rials per annum for the registration of the Consulate's telegraphic address. The provision for newspapers for 1932/1933 represented an under estimate; and owing to the imposition of a new tax on fodder and an anticipated increase in price following the hard winter, the estimate has been raised. The cost of uniforms has risen. 3./ The Secretary to the Treasury.(n\ 3. The explanations furnished by His Majesty’s Consul are deemed to be adequate and I am therefore to request that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction the assignment to this post of a revised office allowance at the rate of #200, and 58,000 rials per annum with effect from April 1st, 1933, subject to possible adjustment in the matter of staff bonus on receipt of a report on the local cost of living promised by His Majesty’s Consul, who has submitted that a further increase of salaries is now required.

I am accordingly to request that Their Lordships may be moved to agree to this proposal and to sanction a corresponding increase in the office allowance assigned to the post by 7,810 rials a year as from the 1st July last. I am, etc., (Sgd) D.J.Scott. The Secretary to the Treasury.copy No.14. / ' b 2 I j32 n British Consulate, Tabriz, May 14th, 1932. Sir, I have the honour to invite reference to paragraph 11 of Mr. Consul Palmers despatch No.8 of April 2nd last submitting an estimate for the Office Allowance of this post for the year 1932-33. Rls.44,400. 2. Mr. Palmer proposed an Office Allowance of Rls.44,000 Rls.15,620. per annum, plus a bonus of 50^ on the wages of the staff, an Rls.60,020. additional Rls.15,620, making a total of Rls.60,020 in all. 3. I beg leave to support Mr. Palmer’s recommendation that the staff should this year be paid a bonus of 50$ on their wages to meet the rise in the cost of living which has followed the depreciation of the Persian currency. 4. The Persian Rial (formerly the Kran) is now quoted by the Bank at 98 to the pound sterling but in the bazaar it is bought and sold at about 104. Last year at this time the of ficial Bank rate was Krans 68 per gold pound, with the bazaar rate at about 90 Krans per gold pound. It will thus be seen that the Persian currency has suffered a decline from about 90 per gold pound to about 130 per gold pound in the last twelve months. Yet even twelve months ago, when it was Krans 90 per gold pound, the Persian exchange was more than 60% below its par value of Krans 55 to the pound. 5. Needless to say, all imported commodities have become very much dearer pari passu with the fall of the Rial and there has also been a marked rise in price of most local pro ducts. Leaving aside luxury articles, which have risen to fantastic The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc. , etc. , Foreign Office, S.W.l.fantastic prices in consequence of the Persian Government’s control of imports, and. confining ourselves to those essentials which the staff are obliged to purchase for their daily needs, the enclosed table of last years’ and this year’s prices will show horn much worse off the staff now are as compared with a year ago. 6. I also beg leave to point out that there has been a very marked increase in house rents recently. The Munshi, who paid Tomans 180 per annum last year, has just renewed his lease for this year at Tomans 240. The Clerk-Typist, whose rent was Tomans 120 last year, is having difficulty in getting his landlord to renew the lease for this year at Tomans 165. The Ghulams and menial staff are also faced with proportionate increases. 7. The bonus of 25$ granted to the staff for the year 1931-32 is in my opinion inadequate to compensate them for the enhanced cost of living, and I therefore have the honour to re commend that Mr. Palmer’s suggestion that a bonus of 50% be paid to them for the current year 1932-33 may receive your careful consideration.

My Lord Marquess, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship* herewith, a despatch addressed to Your Lordship which I have received under flying seal from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz regarding an increase in the salaries and wages oaid to the clerical and subordinate staff at His Majesty’s Consulate. Mr. Palmer had previously submitted proposals for such increase to Your Lordship’s predecessor in his despatch No.22 of May 22nd. But these proposals included the fixing of these salaries and wages in sterling and when I wat later asked (in a private letter from Mr. Gye of August 27th - K 6908/1002/234) to express my views thereupon, I felt obliged, before doing so, to ask Mr. Palmer to modify his proposals to the extent of stating the increases which he recommended in terms of local currency. 2. Mr* Palmer’s present despatch should be read in conjunction with the despatch of May 22nd referred to above, as the latter contains various arguments, especially as regards the salaries and wages paid at other Consulates most of which are 80^4 to 120^'-higher than those paid at His Majesty’s i \ Consulate, which are not repeated in the former. In particular I would draw Your Lordship’s attention to paragraph 8 of the earlier despatch. 3. The increases recommended by Mr. Palmer represent a uniform V The Most Honourable ■ The Marquess of Heading, G.C.B., etc*, etc., etc. THE FOREIGN OFFICE. BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN, 17th October, 1931.uniform rise of fifty per cent: and in the circumstances they appear to me to be fully justified, I therefore venture to recommend them to Your Lordship’s favourable consideration. 4. I should add that the rate of exchange has remained at approximately the same level throughout this correspondence. It was fixed officially at ninety krans - one pound sterling when Mr, Palmer wrote his first despatch in May: and it still stands at this figure, although this rate is no longer regarded as official. A copy of this despatch has been sent to His Majesty’s noneul at Tabriz. I have, etc. (Egd.) Charles Dodd i \ I &gt;\' j ] Ymmmamm kb. SiBRITISH CONSULATE TABRIZ September 23rd, 1931. Salaries of Staff. Sir, I have the honour, as directed By H. 11.Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, to transmit under flying seal an up-to-date statement of the prices of the chief articles consumed by the Staff of this Consulate during the month of September 1929, 1930 and 1931. 2. September is probably the cheapest month all round her*e; the grain harvests are in, and fruit is abundant, while certain articles such as charcoal and firewood have not begun to really soar towards their winter high-water marks. 3. Bread is about the only edible which has been more or less forcibly maintained at a reasonable level. Every other article of food shows considerable rises, while articles of clothing show enormous rises. 4. It is known by me that the two Clerks use European cloth and shoes; while I assume the Ghulams to use Russian Calicoes and prints and local shoes for their famililies. All the Ghulams, gate-keepers etc. are married, and many have children. 5. The Ghulams also cannot on their small salaries buy a stock of any commodity, but buy all in small driblets at consequently high retail prices. 6. I am I '■ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs etc., etc., etc. Foreign Office LONDON V No. 34 n SP/NM6. I am well aware of the extreme need for economy, and I therefore do not suggest any more for this year than the following scale calculated in Persian currency;-- Munshi 1350 Krans per mensem Clerk-Typist 1050 do. do. 1st G-hulam 225 do. do. 2nd Ohulam 225 do. do.

A particularly severe blow to the Ghulams, at least, this year has been the rise in the price of fruit and vegetables an(i cheese : and this does in fact entail a tremendous hardship for them, which an increase of their wages by bQfi does not by any means entirely compensate. 8. I venture to urgently recommend that the augmentation decided upon be granted forthwith, as it is now the end of September and the weather will break within two months. I have, etc. (Sgd.) Stanhope Palmer. II. 3. M. Consuli mi ■» fcifc- / ', Q-°P^ (K 6908/1002/234) No. 22. British Consulate, T ah ri z. Sir 22nd May, 1931. U'ith further reference to the question of the calculation in sterling of the salaries and wages of the Staff of this Consulate, I have the honour to transmit a second copy of my previous statement of increase of the prices particularly affecting native employes, from which it will he seen that a further conspicuous rise has taken place in the prices of all articles directly imported or manufactured locally from imported materials. 2. I have, following upon Mr.Gye T s instructions and a circular letter in almost the same terms from His Majesty T s Legation at Teheran, addressed a letter both to my Consular Colleagues and to the 2 British Trading Companies and the Imperial Bank of Persia, asking them if they could see their way to let me know what steps, if any, they had taken or contemplated taking as regards their own employes. 3. The Trading Companies and the Bank have made no do so, as all have been run at a heavy loss last year, while in any case the salaries they already paid are in many cases higher than those paid here. But as a result of their unwillingness to raise certain salaries, some of the lesser- paid long service employes of one Company have told their manager that with deep regret they must look round for another post. It is obvious that they are not in a position to 4 His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Foreign Office S.W.l.V 4. At the same time in the case of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, half the salaries of their European employes are now 'being paid in sterling in London, instead of all in tomans here, at 50 krans only = £1 as previously. 5. As regards the Foreign Consulates there is a totally different state of affairs. Some of the Official replies to my enquiry were of a very guarded nature; and indeed I hesitated somewhat before addressing such a question to my Colleagues at all. But I have either been confidentially informed or it has ”transpired' that the situation is as follows:- Turkish Consulate General :- Both the Munshi and the Ghulams are paid in sterling. The ghulams used to receive 20 tomans and mid-day food. The Secretary-typist-archivist is H de carriers'. The entire Budget of the Turkish Consul General is in sterling, and is negotiated in this form. German Consulate; - The Consul wrote recommending payment in sterling or substantial increases for his Ghulams several weeks ago, and the matter is now under consideration at Berlin. The Munshi is paid in Marks, and as two years ago he was receiving 120 tomans a year, it is clear that he must be automatically receiving much more now. The Secretary- Typrist-Archivist is 'De Carriere'. The ghulams at present receive 20 tomans. But the Head Ghulam has 26 tomans. Polish Consulate :- The Munshi used to receive 100 tomans: but from January 1st , 1931 this salary has been calculated at its sterling value of 1929 — i.e. about £16 or £17 - and the Munshi now receives7. receives a sterling cheque for this sum which he is free to negotiate as he pleases. T-ie ghulams started at a lower salary than was paid by this Consulate, but this has been steadily increased recently and at this moment I gather that the ghulams receive 16 tomans and the gardener — for a tiny garden — 12 tomans. Further more these wages will be raised next month and every successive month or two months until the ghulams receive 20 tomans, and the gardener and water-carrier 15 tomans. The Secretary—Typist—Archivist is -’de Carriere ,f . French Consulate :- The Munshi’s salary has always been paid in francs and it w'as calculated to bring him in 120 tomans in 1929. It clearly must bring him in 50^ more now. l;ie ghulams have not so far received any increase, but I believe they receive 15 tomans and that some increase will be accorded shortly.

Mr. Palmer’s recommendations in respect of salaries have not been included in this statement as they are the subject of correspondence with His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, and further proposals on this subject will be made in due course. 3. The increase in the item Taxes is inevitable under the terms of the lease of the Consular premises, and Mr. Palmer has been unable to avoid an addition to the charge for water. The increase in gratuities is due to the engagement of the extra ' clerk typist, and in uniforms to the increased cost of material. 4. The actual expenditure on sundries for the past twelve months was one thousand, three hundred and thirty eight krans, and this item is likely to increase with the fall in the purchasing power of the Kran. 5.

With reference to India Office letter No. P 572/30 of the 17th ultimo regarding the engagement of a clerk-typist at His Majesty’s Consulate at Tabriz, I am directed by Mr. | Secretary Henderson to transmit herewith for the information of the Secretary of State for India^copy of a statement which has been drawn up in this department on the basis of ! information supplied by Mr. Consul Palmer showing the estimated 1 needs of the post for the current year. Before requesting the acceptance by the Secretary of State for India of a moiety of the cost involved it is felt that some explanation of the increased expenditure should be submitted to him. 2. It will be noted that some re-arrangement Is suggested in the salaries of the staff at the post and in this connexion I am to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from Mr. Consul palmer which explains the reasons for the new proposals. 3. I am to request that Mr. Wedgwood Benn’s attention may be drawn to the fact that the clerk-typist, the moiety of whose salary your department had agreed to charge to Imperial funds in the letter under reference, has proved unsuitable and | that a new clerk has been engaged in her stead at a salary of eight thousand four hundred krans per annum. j 4. An addition to the allowance is proposed for heating.

The increase appearing under the headings n Gratuities’* and ’’Uniforms” is to provide for two gatekeepers who were engaged some time ago to replace Persian guards. 6 . Provision has been made for a subscription to a British newspaper and for slightly increased expenditure on local newspaoers. The increased estimate for lighting is based on actual experience with the new local power installation. 7 . The remaining items do not appear to call for special comment and I am to request that a moiety of the total expenditure of two hundred dollars and forty three thousand three hundred and fifty krans per annum may be accepted as a charge upon Indian revenues. I Sir, Your obedient Servant,Copy. No. 7. i British Consulate, (K 2623/30C/234). Tabriz. Feb. 6. 1930. ClerV-Typist. Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No. 1 jan. 10th I have the honour to report that I have now en,^a^ed a satisfactory second clerk, after a short test. 2. There was a Miss Thomasian, a British Subject whose brother works in the Imperial Bank of Persia, who is described on her Registration card as a typist. 3 . I felt bound to offer her a chance; but I regret to say that I found her command of English poor, her typing: ability very poor indeed, and her general * intelligence did not impress me at all highly. 4. As she was quite unsuitable In every respect I definitely engaged - as from Feb. 1st 1930 - a Mr. Mamian, whom I had already tested. 5. Mr. Mamian is a young Armenian of Tabriz who has graduated from, the local American School. He speaks and reads English at least as well as my Maltese Clerks at Bengasi. He also speaks and reads French, and Armenian well; Russian not quite so well; and can speak Persian and the local Azerbaidjan M Turki n . He seems a bright intelligent person, who should rapidly learn any details of routine work new to him. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State fbr Foreign Affairs, He Foreign Office, London.o Re has left a temporary employment with the local ’’Econome 11 General Stores - in order to better himself - with the consent and recommendation to me of him by the Armenian n Econome H Manager (my informant for many details as to Russian Trade Methods). 6. My previous reports as to the activities of the Persian First Clerk - Munshi - Typist may have been somewhat misleading; and I, therefore, respectfully beg to restate what I have found or initiated since my arrival. a. He has typed all my voluminous reports since my arrival, and will continue to do such as are of a confidential nature. He has worked 12 hours a day during the past 2 months without complaint. b. He has obtained - without any payment - a dis tribution of the entire Azerbaidjan forces. This my predecessor had declared could not be done without paid agents. c. He has found for me an (also unpaid) agent upon the Railway who will attempt to furnish information not only of railway and trade matters in this Province, but also to supply information of strategic, commercial and military interest as to what goes on in South Russia and the Caucasus in the district between Batoum, Tiflis, Baku and the Persian frontier. d * He is of a good old family of landowners from round Urumia, and still has to support the cost of upkeep of a Persian Soldier. He is, therefore, treated with marked civility by all Local Persian Officials from the Governor General and the General downwards. His property and house were, however, pillaged by the Kurds just after the war. piCh ; U hvs ; e. Produces each month one of the two or* three Commer cial Reports which serve to draw up the Consulate Monthly Comm ercial Diary, and also produces a resume of the Customs Statis tics. In short he has been doing and will continue to do work not attempted by the Munshis of the other Consulates. 6. I have arranged, therefore the followinc? provisional j distribution of work and salaries: subject to approval;- 1st Clerk. 900 Krans a month. - 2nd Clerk. 700 Krans a month. ^ Total. 1,600 Krans a month. 7 . This will be seen to be less than the total of 1700 Krans a month for clerk - hire sanctioned: and I very respect fully but earnestly request that I be allowed to use my discre tion over the disposal of the remaining 100 krans per month. The new clerk could never under any circumstances obtain for me the information or find me the correspondents ^ •mentioned in sections (b) and (c) of paragraph 6 above; nor could I use him for conversations of a delicate nature with the hiyher Local Authorities. S. It will be seen that I am not begginm for a higher allowance than 1700 krans a month either now or later; but only to be allowed to divide this up according to what respectfully appears to me to correspond to the actual work done and value of the services rendered to the Consulate. 9. I have to pay Miss Thomassian for two days work here, but on the other hand this will be the only expenditure for a second clerk in January; while until I receive a reply to this letter (I venture to hope before the Novruz gratuities are due at the end of March) the monthly expenditure will be 1600 krans only.

Sir, I have the honour to report that upon arrival here i found the following state of affairs — A. The clerical staff consisted of one Munshi or Persian secretary whose regular hours of attendance were two only. He' has, however, to conduct all enquiries - both commercial and political - outside the Consulate, and have dealings with the local Authorities. His salary of 8o tomans was the lowest paid in this town. B. Whereas all other career Consulates^ Turkish, .ussian, French, &amp; German - have besides a Persian Munshi a proper nation al clerk or chancery official chosen from the cadres of their home Government civil or Foreign services, this Consulate - which used to be considered the most important in northern Persia and which might again become so with reasonable care - has n p | cl erica l e mp lo ye at al l neither British nor a local sub je ct. C. ny predecessor used apparently to avail himself of the help of a personal employe, and did the rest of the clerical work himself. The result has naturally been most unsatisfactory. My predecessor was almost a slave to his office, and could neither be free often to - make enquiries into political or commercial matters himself, nor last year make the usual tour of the Christian communities around Lake urumia. Further he could find no time for the usual social and sporting amenities, which really might seem to form even a necessary part of a Consul’s duties. His Majesty’s principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. D. .. . .ID* Tiie Office work can not be considered to have gained through the above : as I note that the total amount of letters and despatches emanating from this Consulate had diminished by about 5q$ in the last two or three years. It is not, in my considered opinion, humanly possible for any Consular Officer - to confront the present and probably increasing work of this post under such a gigantic handicap. £* I should also point out that a miniature crusade for the reestablishment of British commercial importance (I have avoided employing the word T, Prestige n but the latter also might seem to have waned) is urgently called for; and the incumbent, of this post can not even remotely contemplate any sustained effort in either direction If he has not at least the same staff at his disposal as is customary even in posts of lesser past or possible future importance. G. the appointment of a second whole time Clerk is imper ative. It would be preferable that he should be a Britisher, and a junior probationer Vice-Consul would be ideal. But the matter is of the utmost urgency. There are matters like the conflict over the prade-Houtes for Tabriz - hawanduz, frebizond, julfa etc.- and the possibility of aiding British Transit Trade after any Anglo-Bus si an agreement, which demand that the Consul himself and the Munshi should not be tied down continuously to mere routine matters of office work. The latter only would be done well, but there could be no active work done to recover the commercial importance which Great Britain did and should to some extent again possess, H. If, therefore, any importance at all be attached to the trade of this section of the Fear Bast, and if it be desired that &gt; - ■ v .. -that this Consulate make a sustained effort towards regaining some of the lost ground, I must most respectfully request that either (a) A junior probationer Vice-Consul be nominated here &amp; proceed here forthwith; or (b) That the Consul be empowered to select upon the spot some suitable whole-time Clerk - typist and pay him a reasonable wage - say ISO tomans a month. Further the Munshi should receive ISO tomans for whole time work, and I have already ventured to increase his salary to 100 tomans - out of savings on Office Allowance - up to Dec. 31st. while increasing his ¥/ork and Office Hours. The ■’in m ■ latter course is, however, quite insufficient. neither the work outside the Consulate can be dealt with as things stand, nor the Office work itself. (There is for instance, no Card index whatsoever at present). ^he Kawanduz Hoad question seems likely to become of the utmost urgency - to take only one concrete example - but my hands are tied for the reasons specified, and q can only urgently beg that the question of the best method of remedying the present disastrous shortage of clerical assistance be given really immediate attention; and that as soon as a decision can be taken it be communicated to me by telegram.
