Sidap telephoned to rne that he was starting foi for Bait al Flaj. without waiting for orders. I represented to him that if he did so I .would be left here with only 20 sepoys to protect the Consulate and I recommended him not to move without orders especially as the object of his ■ detachment at Sidap was to protect Mascat. He replied thit he considered itmwas his duty to go to Bait al Falaj and he was starting at once. l/repeated my advice to him but he left the telephone sayinfi something inaudible and I was unable to get him again.

January 1915 My dear Edwardes 9 Please parden my referring again te the incident ef the sheeting ef the Sidi, Mahr\ik,the night hefere last. I had ne idea the Sid&amp;p detas#aent was marching hy the oeast reute ( Matra,Riyaa etc) t© its destinatien. I had an idea they were returning hy the way they went, nameljr eutside the general picket line. It seems that the Sidi was quite a harmless persen and when he sheu^ prehahly frem alarm,, at the appreach ef a hedy ef armed men one ef the lecal sentries pested en the adjacent peak fired twe ahets as is *kx their eustem te warm the inhabitants. Hieelas^ teek this man te be an enemy spy and erdered him te be seised. The mao struggled and sheuted. Kicelas whe had ne interpreter with him and whe dees net kn^ew the lecal language interpreted this te mean that the man was sneuting a warning te the enemy whe he at ence decided were in the hills. Censidering the fact^he was well inside the picket line and marching threugh a bit ef ceuntry knewm te centain ne enemy and aleng the usual path used by the pmwpkwx peaceful pepulatien ef itiascat and M&amp;tra, I think his decisien te sheet the man was a little ■ fer man uncalled/ even under present cenditiens. The/was beund hand and feet and Hieelas shet him in the back with his ewn revelder and left him. Mr Barney’s servants whe are here went te the burial and identified the corpse as the eld servant ef the liissien. /The Sultan teld ise the man was well knewn in Masoat and was at the tine 'feeing eapleyed as a labourer in H«H« , s garden. The Sultan did net say much but he appeared te fee very distressed at the incident. I hope that it will net upset the local people and the friends and relations of the man who might try to take their revenge in some way.against the white man. As you know every ©ne here goes about with^ dagger and a rifle. You will perhaps pardon^ me if I suggest that it would fee a good thing if a less feroaioue and more tactful officer were sent te Sidap. Hicolas seeias tosses red** all the time. This is an ex cellent thing no doubt in the firing line, but scarcely apprepiate in the immediate vicinity of Mascat. Yours sincerely-i' f &gt; Marcat, 15/1/15 My dear Edwardes, Many thanke fer yeur ntte abeut the Kicelae incident I think you are doing the only thing possible about him. You will be astounded to hear that his yictim is the sweeper whom I engaged for him the other day and who worked for him, Ir keer.s that he was transferred to Bait al Ealaj or at any rate had gone there and v.'aej returning from there with his rations. The bags of stuff found near him and which I thought had been dropped by Bicclaa* party v/ere apparently these .rations. At present it is not generally kniwn that Eioolas shot him ;the Sidis and Baluchis are laying the blame on the Arabs, but the Aral Arabs are saying that the ’Paltan* shot him by mistake. If it was not for the fact that he was left tied up hand and foot with 'sarkari# * rope it might have passed for an accident. The Sultan of course knows that the detachment shot him,but he underotands that under present conditions such a thing might quite easily happen especially as some shots were fired from the hill at the time. One of his own Baluchis was shot and an- in Masgat other wounded by an Arab sentry in the excitement on the night of the 11th. I would not say anything about compensatidn to relatives yet awhile. The whole thing is a pity. X only afraid that the Sidia and Baluchis will bear resentment us in consequence, I do net think you ought to have a promenade r through Mascat and Matrah just yet mainly fer the above reason. ,/ Yours sincerely / / / Vv « ' • : •' {j ■ (' \ H ' ; \ / \ n A' 7 \ \ -■</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000287_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/47</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000287</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/47</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File XXIX/6 THE IMAM’S RISING 1913-1920 SIDAB DITACHMENT, SHOOTING OF MUBARAK, 1915’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1915/1915</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-15T12:36:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (16 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 16; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
