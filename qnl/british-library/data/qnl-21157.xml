P. P.—L (m) hoi —500-11-31. / ('7 ) ri CONFIDE A From No. G/9 of 193^* Political Agency, Bahrein, Dated the 17 th January 193 2. THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. The Hon’ble the Political Jlssident in the ^ersian Gull r Bushire* air. I have the honour to say that the Batirain G-overnment luxve not found it possible to meet current expenditure by revenue despite drastic economies,the figures for the first six months of the Arabic year showing a deficit of Rs.31,625/- on tlie budget estimates and a deficit of Rs.110,420/- upon the figures of the first half year of 1349. 2. No further economy appears possible in the adminis tration and building and similar non-productive expenditure has been reduced to a minimum. Kis ixceliency Shaikh Hamad has reviewed the situation and decided upon two economies and two sources of additional revenue. Three of these will require the concurrence of the Government of India,the fourth oeing a matter tae Shalvk is competent to decide without further reference. 3. The two measures of economy are the reduction of the appointment of Gaptain Parke and the substitution of local men lor tne fifty remaining Indian Police. Gaptain Parke costs the State some ns. 14,000/- per annum and local men could be secured xor ^s.35/- per mensem as compared with the Rs. Jb/- now paid to the Indian Police thereby resulting in an cjinual saving of iS.6,000/— apart from a considerable sum now expended on passages and leave pay. 4. The two additional sources of revenue are increased Customs’ dues on luxuries and the levy of zakat upon the d* gardegardens. If the Customs 1 dues upon the former ¥/ere raised from S/o to V-J/o an approximate additional revenue of Rs*8,000/- may he expected and a larger import would not be likely to increase the figure. The yield of the zakat has not yet been calculated and it v/ill be very difficult to form an estimate, for a Revenue department as the term is understood in india 7 does not exist in Bahrain* 5* Another economy that was considered was a cut in salaries over a certain amount,but,since a 5,® cut would only produce a saving of some R8.500/- a month this is not being put into force at the moment,though it will be necessary later if conditions do not improve. 6. I consider that the proposals are practical and I recommend their adoption. Captain Parke has little to do save atn the six months in every third year that he acts for hr.Belgrave,and he does not seem able to give Mr. Belgrave as much assistance as one might have expected during the remainder of the time. His contract expires * after the conclusion of his leave in September this year and it is proposed that his contract should simply not be renewed. His administration of the Indian xolice has not impressed me and I consider that the State can do very well without his services until Rr .Be I grave goes on leave in 1934. By that time the recreation or retention of the post of Assistant Adviser could be reconsidered and the answer would probably be found in the state of the pearl market, which is the real ruler of Bahrain. 7. I heartily recommend the early disbandment of the Indian Police whose contracts expire during the summer of this year. The climate does not suit them or their wives, several of whom have died,and their duties which consist of a ceaseless and wearisome tour of guard duties do littlf to retain their interest. They are growing steadily slacks and are by no means a credit to the Indian Army in which OiH at one time or another.received their training. The dan^from the LoiA/aQir,a cahsiderat ion whidi lead to their form at ion,no longer exists,and local men,who are now available in sufficient numbers owing to the local depression,could be trained without difficulty to carry out their duties.' ihese men would be simpler in every way to deal with aai vjould have the inestimable advantage of speaking Arabic,the ignorance of Tshich has been a great drawback to the Punjabis. 8. As regards the increase in Customs 1 dues,I feel that the time has come when the otate,subject to the advice of the Political Resident,should be allov/ed to fix such rates as it pleased. Al a tii:je when the Government of India,and for that matter,almost every country in the world,are doubling and trebling duties that are already high,I feel thab it is inequitable to bind a State like Bahrain that depends on its customs for nine-tenths of its revenue to a five per cent duty# The merchant cauaunity are extremely vocal in Bahrain and would not hesitate to express them selves freely if the duties were greatly increased,and this wholesome check,coupled with the advice of the Political Resident should msure that this new privilege was not abused, Nevertheless,when returning prosperity again increased the Customs ? dues to the high figures of past years it would be necessary bo see that the Ruling family,who already receive 57,0 of the current revenue,did not appropriate the lion’s share of the enhanced taxation# 9# the zakat will infallibly be passed on by the owners of date gardens to their unfortunate tenantry,who already live near the starvation line but zakat is the on]y tax which is really lawful in the eyes of the strict Muslim and a very high rate is collected by Bin Sa’ud in the gat if and Ilofuf oases# His Excellency proposes at present to levy T ashur T ,i.e.,a tenth of the produce,and though this may be difficult to collect; will be infinitely preferable to a fixe&lt;&lt; rate expressed in rupees which bears hardly when dates fete. 1 a low price as they do at the moment. Since His Excellencym * * % h 4. is convinced of the useiulness of this tax and since no fonn of land tax exists I suggest that you should inform him that the proposal may be acted upon. 10. One point requires mention. JJo immediate economy will result from the reduction of Qaptain iarxe’s post or the substitution of local men for Indians since the former wrill receive full pay till September and there will be a time when both local men and Indians will have to be paid since the recruits vdll take time to train, fhe ultimate economy, however, is obvious. I request, the re fore, that these two proposals and the request for permission to levy enhanced customs dues be referred to the Government of India,with your approval for an early decision. The levy of zakat requires no referonce,but His Excellency will probably expect a word from you before putting it into force.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to Major Fowle’e letter Ho. 1449, hatch 11th July 1931, regaraing the finances of tne Bahrain State. -fortunately Captain Prior’s anticipation that the current year would see a further deficit has been realised, and it is essential that further oieasures of economy should be acoptec. 2. luring my recent visit to Bahrain I had &amp; long discussion with the Political Agent abb the Adviser regarding the financial fit tuatlon of the Principality. Mr. Belgrave informed me that the expenditure was now exceeding the revenues by about &amp;. b.OOO/- a month ana the situation was aeterioratlng and that the time had now cose when, In his opinion, it was essential to take further steps to reauce expenditure and increase revenue At the beginning of the present financial year ( the Arabic year starts In May at present ) the State had a balance in the Bank of «s. 1,13,656, in addition to its reserve of 9s. 3,00,000. This sum Is now exhausted.2 (« exhausted, partly on current expenditure and partly on carUal expenditure, namely the extension of electric light to jfuharraq, which it is hoped will ultimately produce revenue, ano it will he necessary to *raw on the reserve. 3. Finally four measures were proposed, which it v ' ££ bo PCG would enable the budget to be balanced and Mr. Belgrave said he would submit them for consideration to the Deputy Fuler. These measures were as follows: (e) That on the expiration of hie present contract in September next, the services of C*&gt; tain Parke should not be renewed and that the Adviser should hold charge of the police In addition to his own duties for a year at any rate as he has done when Cpptaln Parke has been on leave. (b) . That the Indian police should be replaced by local men as their contracts expire. (c) . That application should be made to the Government of Incla for permission to Increase the customs dues to by a small extent, and (d) That a small land tax (Zakat) should be levied on agricultural produce. 4. I suggested to Mr. Belgrave that if £haikh Haaad approved of these proposals he should submit them to the Political Agent, who in turn would address me on the subject, inorder that I might refer them to the Gov ernment of Inc la. I have now received an official co/anunication from the Political Agent, of which I en- -cloee a copy for the Information of the Government of India. 5* As regards the reduction of the appointment of Commandant of Police, I would Invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign and Political DepartmentDepartment letter Bo. F.164-^/29. oated 19tn January 1931. In which the approval of the Government of Incia was accoroed to the retention of Captain Parke fox a further period of at least one year. Captain farke hae. X know, been looking about for an appointment out- -side Bahrain for some time past but informed me that he would, in any event, stay over the euimaer, when he was acting for Hr. Belgrave. who was on leave. He him- -silf is proceeding on leave in the spring ana his con- -tract expiree in September, ana having regara to the need for economy I agree with the Political Rent's proposal that it should not be renewed ana that the post should, for the time being, be left vacant. Hr* Belgrave has twice, for a period of six months on each occasion, held charge of the Poll** in addition to his own work and informs me that ne can do so in future, though possibily there may be some slight lost of efficiency. In view of the necessity for economy, however, this must be faced. The aifficulty will arise two years hence when sir. Belgrave goes or, leave. It has been custoisary in the past for Captain Pai ke to act for him and it is essential to have someone in Bahrain who can perform the duties of the Adviser during Hr. Belgrave's absence. In any case, nowever, I think the post of Commandant of Police may be left vacant for a year ana a half ana the question of appoint- -ing some other officer to it can ce reconsidered in the autumn of 1933. 6# as aentionec in *y tolegraa So. T-21. oatea 2iet January 1932. the Bahrein Government have alrescy informed Captain Parke that it le not their intention to extenc his contract. It was explalnea to ms that thsy had done thie, as after the question had been dlficufeftedI 8 Gitcussea with Shaikh Hawaa, they thought it better to let Captain Parke know without delay, at- the matter would certainly hare got round to hia fro® private tcurcet. 7. The Bahrain police force at pretent cone lets of 48 Inolane, 57 Arabe ana 121 nature. The latter are local aen who are unarmed and merely do watch and ward duties in the bazaar. The regular police form what would be termed in India an armed reserve. The Indians are undoubtedly costly since a sepoy draws £. 35/. pay, plus rations, which formerly cost 15/- but now coet about &amp;• 10/-, plus uniforms and passages to toeir homes every two years. Tne Arabs craw 25/- plus rations and uniforms while the nature get &lt;s. 2b ana no extras. The object of having Indians in the police force was to preserve the peace among tne heterogeneous elements which comprise the population of these Islands in the event of riots. Tne number of Xnai&amp;ns, now-• -ever, has been gradually reduced to 4b ana tne Arabs V increased tc 57, and I am inicrmeo that the latter are now proving sat lex actor/ ana it is bellevtd that they could be reliea upon in an emergency. However, the various elements of the Bahrain community nave lor some years now lived together in peace ana mx amity and the danger of Intercommucal rioting has certainly diminished though it has probably not entirely disappeared. The risk therefore of aaving &amp; force composed entirely of Arabs is not a great one and the financial situation justifies, or rather necessitates, running a slight risk. As the Political Agent points out, the substitution of Arabs for the remiming Indians would effect &amp; saving of about 2s. 6 t Q00/- in addition to the cost of passages and leave pay.' T C't !: n i m /o 6. Vnctr Article 4 cf tiie itehrain Treaty ef 1861 trie * tate ie precluded J to a incieafein^ itfc cubtuina autlea aboTe 5^T. Ae pointed out by tbe Political A^ent, r . eucb a restriction is hardly in keeping *itn modern Tiews in such TJattere and I support his proposal that the State should be freed fro® this restriction and be granted tariii autonomy. As Captain Prior points out, the risk ot abuse oi this concession is slight since the ner- -cantile community wields such influence anc 1 think we could ensure that any advice which we tendered regarding the tariff would be accepted. It is the intention of the State only to raise the tuty on such articles as silks, periumes, motor cars, etc. ano to refrain from additional taxes on the necessaries of life. 9. As regards tne advisability of imposing 'sakat* X have not at present arrived at a definite conclusion. In principle the tax is legitimate and a recognised levy in ^uhammedan countries. Whether, when the details are worked out, it will be found to be advisable to impose it in Bahrain, where special conditions prevail. I am not yet certain, and should therefore like to reserve my opinion regarding the imposition of s&amp;k&amp;t until the matter has been gone into in greater detail* 10. The great difficulty in balancing the Bahrain budget is the question oi akin the allowances drawn by the ruling family. Till recently these allowances amounted to 50# of the total revenues of the State, namely b lakht out of a revenue of 10 lakhs. A cut of 10* has already been effected in the family allowances with the full concurrence of Shaikh Hamad. This has effected a saving of 50,000/- but even so, owing to now the fall in revenue, the family allowances amount/to b7* of the total income of the Mate. A further cut is not feasible at present but it may be possible to effect some(20 r i f - i t 6 eoae reauctlon on tne ueiclse cl eoaie oi tae present aolaere. a cut in tne pay ol all tlcieiriJaent olficiale and &amp; lurtner cut in the A1 Knalila allowances may be found necessary if the situation continues to deteriorate. 11. It is anticipated tnat these pxoposale in a lull year would produce about a§. 4S,CC0, mbe up as iollowe : Temporary abolition oi the post of Co.Tar and ant of Police. Subslltution of Arabs for Inoiane Increase of customs cues Zakat, if iarposea, about «*• 14.000. 6 , 000 . 6 , 000 . 15.000. TOTAL 45,000. This will not enable the State to balance its budget anc it will be necessary for them to craw on tnelr reserve, which was created to enable the* to meet such a crisis as the present. haring regard to the present x ln&amp;nci&amp;l bill lenities of all classes of the community increased taxation would not at the present Juncture bring in much, ana would be greatly resented so long as substantial reaerres were known to exist. I should be glad if I could receive early orders on these matte;s so taat the bt&amp;te ma.; be enabled to re* -organise its finances without further delay. I have the Aonoor to be. Sir.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 130th . obru^j^- 1932. Dear Colonel, I enclose for your information a copy of a Statement Belgrave has given me showing the proportion of Civil List to revenue for the past seven years and the proportion of Shaikh Hamad’s frivy Jurse to the whole revenues. fou will see that there has been a great drop in his private income and this is due to the fact that date gardens are producing little in the way of rent and at the moment and the receipts from bazaar properties have also diminished. If he continues to give away valuable bazaar properties to his son, .aij,the receipts from bazaar pro perty will naturally diminish still further. The remark regarding excess in Civil List may be explained as follows: Last year Shaikh Hamad was told that if he could reduce the Civil List below 50^ he could keep the savings himself. One or two A1 Khalifa died off and ilG Githor took the whole of the deceaseds’ allowance him self or a portion of it and this gave him an increase of Is.S,500/- last year. Oicourse,now he cannot do this as the Al Khalifa are getting well over 50^ of the gross revenue. Ho far he has done nothing in the way of economy and gives his domestics Id presents on the usual scale. He will shortly find himself in grave financial difficulties.

Further, Bahrain ha® much the aoet civilieed population of any place in the 5ulf, and such a community naturally look to the State not only to maintain lav and order but alao to provide them with faoiliti®® for the education of their children, earn® court® for the rapid adjudication of their diapute®, and •ome measure of sanitation and the ordinary aaeniti®® of existence.. And though the administration is, 1 think, rightly kept on the simplest lines 43^ of the present revenue (which is all that is left nowadays after the /I Khalifa allowances have been paid) will not suffice to meet expenditure and the 3tate is confronted with a heavy deficit. # 3. -hen I wrote my letter ^o.C~7 of the 22nd January 1932 1 reported that the monthly deficit *as He.8,000 i the Political Agent reported in liaroh that it had mounted to over ^s. 12,000/* (vide my telegram No.173, dated 13th iiaroh 1932) and even assuming that that was a specially tmd month, it eeeme improbable that the average deficit will be less than Rs. 10,000 per mensem,i.e. Rs.l,20,0o0 per annum. 4. To meet this the Hate has a reserve of 3 lakhs, which it is clear will not go very far and which it is un* desirable to drain completely. And the total economies suggested are calculated to produce only Re*43,000/* in a full year, and even if they are all accepted and introduced will only produce about half that eum during the coming financial year. The temporary abolition of the poet of Commandant of Police and the substitution of Arabs for Indians in the police cannot in any caoo be brought about till next autumn when their contracts expire, while 1 have not yet received any proposals regarding .xikat, which will certainly take some time to introduce.£&gt;• The position therefore le that the State ia confronted with a very large deficit and to meet this economies have been proposed which are really entirely inadequate, and for the moment revival* Unfortunately, however, the chief trade of Bahrain is that in pearls, a luxury trade which even ass 4iing some improvement in general commercial conditions should manifest it* self in the near future, will probably be one of the last to revive, and I feel myself that before long much more drastio measures will be necessary, while if the measures already proposed are whittled down it will but hasten the end* a reference to Government of India telegram ho*34b3-a of 26th November 1929 to his majesty's »ecretary of State for India* It is clear from this and from the subsequent correspondence that ensued that at that time the Government of India disliked the presence of Indian police at Bahrain and, as will be seen, efforts were made to get Sudanese to replace them but were not successful* vhether Sudanese would have been any more reliable than Arabs I cannot say, having had no experience of them; they would have had the advantage of not being local men, but in view of the very large negro element in Bahrain would probably soon have got merged into the general population* I am not sure whether It is correct to say now that the Arab as an armed policeman is an unknown quantity; ths polios in f Iraq are all expected to attain qqits the same standard my personal opinion is that they should be able to deal with minor disturbances but that in ths case of really serious trouble arising as for the State is really gambling on the possibility of a trade 6* Further, in this connection I would venture to invite Arabs and have, I believe, showed themselves to be reliable and efficient, and though the Bahrain police can hardly be • • •instance riots such as occurred in 1923 it will always# even if there was a small nuclsous of Indians in the police force. Bahrain some risk will be involved a^tated in my letter So* C*7 of the 22nd January 1932 if the Indian element in the police force is entirely eliminated, but I do not re^jard it as very serious, and, having regard to the financial situation, I feel that it must be faced* In normal times it would have been preferable to replaoe the Indian police more gradually uut the timee unfortunately are not normal, and the 3t&amp;te is coapelled no doubt that those Indiane on their high rate of pay together with passages, etc* cost the State a very substantial a via. For these reasons 1 feel that I can but adhere to my former recorzsaendation that the Indian police should jc sent back to India on the expiry of their present contracts* be necessary to invoke the assistance of Hie majesty's ships. 7.

So far as I am aware they have never applied for any increase other than the enhancement of the duty on luxuries by 2 w j bringing it up from S 0 ^ too to 7 $. I cannot understand why the amount of has been introduced* 3. To revert to your above rue ted letter. I assume that the words ’a ll round inc rease 01 7,y ; ’ is an error since it would Cripple the trade of Bahrain and lead to a general exodus of its inhabitants. It occurs to no that perhaps an ’all round increase of 2 W o bringing the tariff rate qi to 7^C’ is meant,and I give my views on this in caso that is what is repaired,and also an&amp; 2 . estimate of its yield, I believe that small though the addition is,it v/ould prove a very heavy burden,particularly to naldiud&amp;a &amp;ho have to provision larye nuiiners^ of boats. Tost of titoso men ure havii%' the greatest difficsulty in fitting! out ’joats tnis year,and this addition 1 i post might veil prove the last straw for many* i'ne great rmjority of the inhabitants of Bahrain are desperately poor ..and any increase in the price of necessities oi life would bring them still near- er the starvation line, hie customs dues last year brought in B§«5|09 9 0QQ, i0 an all round eniiuncement from 5 to 7 ,,j v/ould / in IhieQT brin; in another'2., lakhs. I feel certain,however, that the increase would lead to diminished consumption,and also prooaSly to diving boats obtaining their supplies at a cheaper jj port,and the actual increased yield might be as love as a lakh of rupees. ‘ 4. I notice that 1 wan asberl not to broach the matter with the tate m ri ties, hut . r.holgraro men bionod, anon r matters,that the Hon^le the iolitical Resident had discussed the question with him.so there seamed no ’iarm in ascertaining his views. He agrees with me that my increase of the ;eneral rate would cause great hardship a/ui tliat it should be left at its present figurw of 5^. Luxuries he thinks should be taxed at 10 ,j and apparently His dxcelleaoy Shaikh Hamad would like to have the duty on tobacco raised to lb/i. I'hese additions will,he considers,bring in some Is.50,000/- principally from tobacco,since there is little trade in luxury articles. I concur with these suggestions and request that the Government, of India may be asked to agree to than. It lias been found that an increase on luxury articles hy of only would give a very disappointing return,and so to be scaroely worth instituting, tobacco can easily pay the increase now suggested. 5. I suggest therefore that the general rate remains 5/* as at ,( present,that luxuries should pay 10^ md tobacco 15,,'. I should mention that the Adviser is anxious to place a customs duty of 15,0 on liquor imported under lisence for the Hvxopean .{ community. His excellency Shaikh Hamad agrees generally wi vV this,but owing to tho feeling against recognising it in any way he is at present uncertain whether to proceed with a customs duty or not. I would be glad if the -overnEient of India could be asked to include liquor with tobacco in the enhanced rate of 15^ so that it may be taxed without delay should it be found possible to overcome local scruples* 6. It is requested that an early reply may be given as the matter is urgent. .

I.a., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No.l87-S dated the 30th March, 1932, and to say that the fourth para graph states that f I have not yet received any proposrls regarding zakat T 2. The levy of zakat is in no way precluded by treaty obligations, and the State is not under administration, so His Excellency Shaikh Hamad is presumably in a position to levy this tax without reference to outside authority. Since the quotation I have made from your letter appears to antici pate a prior reference to you, I would be glad if you would be good enough to say whether my view is correct or not. 3. Another point arises in the same letter. The Govern ment of India in their letter F.164-N/29 dated the 9th March, 1932, question the reliability of the Arab police, on the analogy of the precedent at Aden. This appears to me to arise from the misconception that the Aden Arab and the Bahrain Arab are one and the same. I believe the Aden police recruit Somalis, one of the most unreliable elements in the Arabic speaking world, whereas the T Arab T Police at Bahrain are either blacks who are as trustworthy as Sudanese, and invariably employed by mainland Amirs for the bodyguards, or else Persians whom I have found to be cheerful mercenaries, faithful even when used against their own countrymen.

The Government of India are also probably mentally comparing the local Indian police with what careful super vision produces in India. Incompetent administration have snapped the usefulness of the Bahrain Indian police and they are an indolent and dispirited body. Of course a risk is involved in the changes that have been recommended, but finance is ike master who will not be gainsaid.

M f s Political Agent. Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to state that with reference to the budget for 1351, H. E. Shaikh Hamad approved of the following innovations. 1. A tax on tobacco and its products of 15$ A.V. to be collected by the Customs and to be known as tobacco tax, in place of the existing 2$ Baladya tobacco tax. 2. A collection of 15^ customs duty on liquor which is now imported free of Customs duty. 3. An increase on Customs duty of 5$ on the luxury articles on the accompanying list. I now understand that the Government of India is averse to granting tariff autonomy to this State as was desired and proposed, but they suggest a 2t$ increase throughout on the existing 5$ rate on imports. This is not required and is not in the opinion of Shaikh Hamad or myself at all desirable. If these proposals can be adopted, we believe that no other measures will be necessary for additional taxation for which approval of the Government of India need be sought as it is only the rate of Customs duty which is fixed by treaty.For your information I would state that as a temporary measure, owing to the fact that the increases in the Customs duty as proposed are not sanctioned I propose to make the above charges on tobacco, luxuries and liquor through the Khanchieh as from 1st Maharam 1351, which will produce the same result. The rates of the Khanchieh levy have always been fixed by the direct order of the Ruler, as for instance in the case of the existing 2% tobacco tax.

Sir / I have the honour to refer to your letter No: 1407-3 dated the 30th April 1932 and to say that the suggestion tliat the enhanced customs duties should be collected in the form of khanchiyah pending their sanction by the Government of India is quite impracticable,for inaaty obligations cannot be circum vented by giving a customs duty a different name. So long as a duty is levied upon the import of goods into the country,it is a customs duty and as such cannot be enhanced without the concurrence of the Government of India. The Government of India have been approached regarding the increase of customs duties and their reply must be awaited. 2. The Z/o khanchiyah on tobacco is contrary to the treaty since it is in fact an additional customs duty of 2,a and the only reason for my not objecting to it before is that I found it in force on my arrival and^the amount imclaig involved was not large, ihen the financial situation improves it will also be necessary $o review the extra khanchiyah on all goods levied last year since this is far greater than a demurrage charge should be,which is what it is intended to represent.

Qh* Sir, I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter No: 1007-3 dated the 30th April 1932 from the Adviser and my reply to it. The suggestion that the cusfcoms dues should be anticipated by an equivalent demurrage charge is contrary to the spirit of the treaty and if carried out vsiould render it a farce. 2. The 2^ tax at present collected by the Director of Oustoms on tobacco in addition to the 5/a duty was agreed to by Gaptain Iban in 1927 without reference to the Residency and the amount is paid over to the Aanama Municipality. I believe this to be quite irregular but did not raise the matter of my own motion as the levy had been in force for some time. Apart from any general question of treaty th^tax itself is inequitable since by it the tobacco of the uhole A islands is taxed to orovide revenue for a single municipality in ' 3. Similar proposals to the dviser f s were made in my letter No:C/51 dated the 23rd April 1932 and I trust the Government of India will pass early orders upon them.

Reference your letter dated the 30th of March 1932, Ko.l87-S f and connected correspondence. The OoTe-nreent of India have not at any time manifested any dislike for the presence of an Indian element in the Police at Bahrain and if financial conditions admitted vould not have been disposed to allow that element to disappear. In vie^ of the existing financial situation however and of the prospect that the prosperity of Bahrain is likely to be slow in returning they are prepared to accept your recommendation and to allow the Indian element in the force to be replaced by local men as existing contracts expire. The organisation of the Bahrain Police force on a purely local basis is however regarded as something in the nature of an experiment to which the Government of India trust that in view of the risks involved and of the importance of avoiding any incident at Bahrain which co^ld give any foreign power ground for complaint against the administration, you will give your close personal attention and impress the same duty upon the Political Agent. Sd/- E.B.Howell Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. From To' i To British Hesidency Jb Consulate-General, Bushire, the 28th /tpril 1932* The Secretary to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Political ^.^ent, Bahrain. in paragraph 2 of your letter !'To.C.56 of 24th April you point out that the levy of zakat is in no way precluded by the Treaty obligations and that the State is not under administration, so 1 hat His excellency Shaikh Hamad is presumably in a position to levy this tax without reference to outside authority. You enquire whether your view is correct or not. In asply I am directed to state that in the opinion of the Hon 1 ble the Political Resident your view is correct in theory but not in practice. Ho one is more anxious than Colonel Biscoe to see these Arab Principalities and Chaikhdoms conducting their own affairs on indigenous lines with the minimum of interference by the British authorities. He regards Kuwait, in this respect, as the model State in the Persian Gulf, and would like to see other Principalities being as satisfactorily and independently administered. Unfortunately this postulates a competent and energetic Ruler and, as you are aware, these two necessary qualifications are entirely lacking in the present Ruler of Bahrein. He has but little inclination to conduct the affairs of his Principality and lacks both the energy ....- 2 - V3 energy and ability, and has but recently given a most lamentable example of his total lack of competence to deal with the smallest difficulties. In these*circumstances, the Political Resident feels that there is really no alternative but to exercise a considerable measure of control over the administra tion, and while he would reduce this interference in the internal affairs of the State to a minimum he considers it essential that any measures which may possibly produce dissatisfaction among any considerable portion of the population should not be introduced without prior consultation with the local British Representative. The imposition of a totally new form of taxation is a measure of this nature, and will clearly have to be introduced with caution and equity. It would, for instance, be lamentable if z&amp;kat was imposed and then as a result of an outcry on the part of any sections of the populace affected Shaikh Hamad withdrew its in fact, if there was a recurrence of the incident that recently occurred in connection with the administration of estates. 2. &lt;Ve are in the last resort responsible for the maintenance of law and order and good government in Bahrain, and so long as this is the case we can rightfully claim that we should be consulted regarding any measures which may lead to dissatisfaction or disturbance. Bor the above reasons the Hon*ble the Political Resident considers that the question of the imposition of zakat snould be the subject of consultation with the British authorities if it is to be introduced. 1 have the honour to oe, Sir, Your most obedient servant for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Qonfidential. ft o.270-3 of 1932. British Residency oc Consulate-General, Bushire, the 28th April 1932. From - The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Political Agent, Bahrain. f4 A l! ■ I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter fto C/$l of 23rd April 1932, and to state that there was an error in the wording of my letter ITo. 188-3 of 30th March, and '•all round increase of, 7-^ per cent M should have read Ball round increase t£ 7jr per cent'. This slight slip was obvious from the wording of the Government of India’s telegram. 2. It is not clear from where you have derived the impression that the Government of India suggested an increase of 10 per cent, unless a typist’s error was made in the copy of their telegram sent to you. The Guvernment of India telegram reads ” we agree that duty on luxury articles mentioned may be raised from 5 per cent to 1% per cent'. 3, The suggestion that there should be an increase on the/whole tariff lias not been^ppr oved by Hi s Majesty’s / Government and I am now to forward for your information a copy of telegram Ho.1075 of 27th April received from the Government of India together with a copy of Foreign Office letter Ho.B.1353/782/91 of the 24th March, and to requestf s - 2 - you kindly to make a communication to the Bahrain Government as directed therein, 4. The Hon*ble the Political Resident agrees generally with the views expressed in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, and considers that, at the present time at any rate, it would be undesirable to raise the duty on necessities of life. It would however interest him to know, supposing the duty on a bag of rice was raised from 5 per cent to 7£ per cent f what increase in price would be involved to 1fne retail purchaser. 5. Colonel hiscoe notes that the dtate now desire to raise the duty on luxury articles to 10 per cent and on tobacco t o 15 per cent. It is a pity really that this was not put forward in the first instance as it will now be necessary to make a further reference to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Government»but the matter will, be taken up. 6. I am to request that 1 may be informed for the information of the Hon’ble the Political Resident on what date the enhanced rate of duty on luxury articles is introduced and what articles are included in this category.

FOREIGN(Tc Fore ign Office S.W.l. 24th March, 1932. 2-ir, With reference to your letter P.Z.1458/32 of the 15th March in regard to the Bahrein tariff, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he sees no objection in principle to the proposal of the Government of India that, in view of the present financial situation, the Bahrein customs duties on such luxury articles as silks, perfumes, motorcars, etc. should as a temporary measure be raised from five per cent to seven and a half per cent. 2. As regards the procedure necessary for the consequential revision of Article 4 of the Bahrein Treaty of 1851, the Secretary of State is advised that it will be necessary to consult the Dominion Governments and, if the proposed modification of the Treaty were effected by a protocol or other form of instrument, it miffht be held that it should be drawn up on behalf of the various Governments of the British Commonwealth. It would, however, in Sir John Simon's opinion, be sufficient if, after the Governments of the Dominions had been apprised of the matter, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf were to address to the Sheikh of Bahrein a note stating that he had been instructed (without specifying the Government from which these instructions emanated) to acquiesce in the proposed temporary increase of customs duties on luxury articles. 3 . The Under Secretary of State, India Office.3 Sir Lamuel Hoare will no doubt consider the desirability of approaching the Secretary of State for the Dominions. I am to suggest that it might well be sufficient in order to expedite the matter, that the proposed modifica tion of the Treaty and the reasons therefor should be explained to the Governments of the Dominions (possibly by telegram) and that they should be informed that it will be assumed in the absence of information to the contrary that they have no objection to raise. 4. Sir John Simon presumes that, before final instructions are sent to Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe in the matter, the Secretary of State for India will consider whether the proposed increase in the Bahrein customs duties could be considered to be an infraction of the 1920 Agreement with Kinglbn Baud regarding Bahrein duties on poods destined for Uejd, which formed the subject of India Office letter Lo.

Firstly, it seume to as that to hold these eaall iTlnoipailtiee in financial bondage on tho atrangth of troatieo entered into many years ago, when conditions were very different, is opposed to the spirit of tho times.

The bulk of British and Indian imports into this state consists of rice, ooffee, tea, and a certain amount of piece-goods, tiiigar thsugh shown in the Trade Keport as Indian bseauss it ia imparted from India is seldom of Indian orgin.

Ones a flat rate of duty is abandoned and differential rates imposed on different classes of articles, the rates of duty imposed an at first at any rate must toe more or less experimental. It smy be found that some art idee will bear a heavier rate while ethers will not bear the rate imposed, Ceaserelal conditions change and prioee fluctuate, and they may necessitate a re* adjustment ef tariff from time to time.

As mentioned by you in discussion with the hon'ble the Political Kesident it is probable that the Bahrain (jovernment will wish to impose immediately on receipt of the document granting it tariff autonomy the enhanced rates mentioned in paragraph 11 of Sir Hugh Biscoe’s letter No.302-S, dated the 13th May 1932. In order to keep within the spirit of the concession and at the same time avoid delay damaging to the State’s interests, the best course would be for the State, on receipt of the document mentioned, to apply, through the Political Agent, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident for sanction to enhance the tariff forthwith, referring to their original request made in January last. The Political Resident can then sanction the request. By Order. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.INDIA OFFICD, WHITEHALL, 3.W. 1. P.Z.5853/32. V 7th October 1932.

Despite this relaxation, the financial and economic situation of the Islands remains acute, and I am accordingly now authorised to inform Your Excellency that consequent on further censideration of the position, approval is given, as a temporary measure, to the withdrawal of the limitation imposed by Article 4 of the Friendly Convention of 1861 quoted above on Your Excellency’s freedom to modify the rates of duty which may be imposed on the goods of British subjects, subject to the condition that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed on any other goods of the seme hind.

Memorandum . #ith reference to our conversation on the subject of the financial future of Bahrain. The State having enjoyed a good many years of prosperity is now - like practically every other country in the world - faced with difficult times ahead. Its income depends largely on its ad valorem customs dues, and both the bulk of its imports, and their value, have decreased. The pearl trade, which is by far the State’s most important means of support, has during the last two or three years much diminished: catches have been poor, and even when pearls are found there is no market for them. Ror is there much prospect of an improvement in the world pearl market for some years to come. The last State budget did not balance, and an encroach ment had to be made into the State’s reserves: in other words the State has begun to live on its capital. the obvious reason that - apart from our trade and commercial interests in the island - should the State fall into serious financial difficulties, it would presumably be to His Majesty’s Government that it would turn for assistance. I therefore considered it would be advisable, in which opinion you concurred, In these circumstances we were agreed that the finances of the State were now of special concern to us, for forfor a general principle to be placed on record that before the State undertakes any scheme involving large financial expenditure the Financial Adviser should consult the Political Agent, by letting the latter have a detailed statement of the scheme in question. It is hardly necessary for me to explain that I do not make this suggestion with any idea of hampering the Financial Adviser. On the contrary I wish to assist him in his difficult task, which he has carried out with ability, to the best of my questions which Sir Edward Hilton Young set out in his economic report on ’Iraq when he was called in to assist the government of that country in its financial difficulties. necessary Is this (i.e. the scheme propos edj/f or the maintenance of order and security ?

M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a statement of revenue and exuenditure showing the financial posi tion of the State at the end of the first half of the current year. I consider that the position is grave especially in view of the present danger which threatens Bahrain’s trade with the mainland. There is a deficiency of half a lac in the total revenue. Of this amount Rs 42,000/- is due to the Customs receipts having failed to produce the esti mated revenue. A loan of Rs 8,000/- made to Mohd. bin Subah, head of the bin-Aali tribe in Bahrain, has not yet been repaid; the apparent deficiency of Rs 5,000/- under the heading Bents of Government lands is explainable as this heading includes the rent for the oil concession not payable until December. On the revenue side the expenditure has exceeded the budget by Rs 4,465/- but this includes some extra ordinary expenditure in connection with disbanding the Indian police and it is probable that the total expen diture on the year will be within the budgeted amount. To meet the deficiency, after taking over theA / ^ - 2 - the balance from 1350, the State has been compelled to borrow Rs 31,000/- from the Deposit account. This account consists of funds, the property of the public, lodged with the Government in respect of Court cases, securities etc. The Keserve ^hnd of three lacs which is on Fixed Denosit in India is still intact, but unless the revenue improves considerably during the second half year, which I think is unlikely, it will be necessary to break into this fund in order to repay the money borrowed from the Denosit account. A comparison between the first six months of 1350 and 1351 shows that the revenue during 1351 has diminished by approximately Rs 40,000/-. The expenditure during the first six months of 1350 exceeded the expenditure during the same months of 1351 by Rs 67,000/- but of this amount Rs 48,000/- was capital expenditure on the Muharraq electric extension so the real reduction in expenditure amounts to approximately Rs 19,000/- on the half year. In this connection it must be mentioned that the economies effected by reorganisation of the Police Force will not become apparent until during the second half of the year. Out of the State’s total expenditure of Rs 400,000/- (four lacs) during the half year the sum of Rs 214,000/- (two lacs fourteen thousand) was paid in the Civil List as salaries to members of the Ruling family which does not include emoluments for service, the latter payments being debited under various headings, Judicial, ~akfs, public protection etc. In spite of the 10$10% reduction last year the Civil List still absorbs 62% of the total revenue. It has been stated in the past that the Civil List should not exceed half the total revenue, if, during the period under review, the Civil List had been b0% only the difference would have been Rs 41,000/- which would have covered the deficit on Customs receipts.

I have made every effort to reduce the expenditure. Everything has been cut down to the lowest possible amount and no new work of any kind has been carried out unless productive of revenue or absolutely essential, such as repairs to the Custom House whose condition became dangerous, but in suite of this the expenditure continues to exceed the revenue by a considerable sum every month. I have pointed out before that owing to my position in the Government it is for obvious reasons impossible that any suggestion of reducing the Civil List should emanate from me directly, but unless this is done it will be necessary for the State to restrict its activities by reducing expen diture on non-productive departments, i.e., by closing schools, reducing the expenditure on medical services and withdrawing the grants to the municipalities in order to save the necessary money which is requiredSTI required every month to nay the Civil List.

From Political Agency, Bahrein, Dated the 25th Nortmbtr^ 2. THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. To \ OW hL $ r The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to enclose for your inlomation a copy of a letter I have received from the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain which explains itself. The situation he outlines is serious but not desperate and I propose to discuss the matter in some detail,and,in view of my impending departure,to outline the action which I recommend should be taken to meet it. 2. In my letter ^0:0/149 dated the 17th August 1932,while forwarding the State budget lor the current year,I expressed the opinion that 1 did not consider it likely that the State would receive the amount budgetted for during 1351. This gloomy prediction has been amply fulfilled,and of the deficit of Rs.50,U00/-,Rs.40,000/- has been incurred under the very head where I anticipated it,viz,Customs. With rice at its very lowest price for 30 years and ad valorem dues, it was obvious that even the same volume of trade as the preceeding year would not produce the same amount of revenue. However,but for the excessive amount now being paid to the Ruling family,the deficit would not be unreasonable,and considering the amount ol the Reserve Fund,in no way alarm ing. As in all States of this aescription,the mam finan cial dilliculty occurs in fixing the revenues of the Ruler and his relations,and the matter has been frequently under the consideration oi your predecessors. I would invite a reference m the first place to letter No:519-S dated the ,a mm*'6th December 1926 in which the Political Agent was informed that the Civil List was unduly high and should not be 3 allowed to increase. Notwithstanding this,during 1928,an increase of over Rs.40,000/- took place curing Mr.Belgrave's absence on leave. 3. In Residency letter No:1817 dated the 30th September 1928 the Political Agent was informed that the aim ot the State should be to amass a Reserve Fund at least equal to a year’s revenue. During practically tne whole of the tenure of his appointment Mr.Belgrave nas not ceased to press for a reduction in the Civil List,pointing out that at its normal rate of increase,it would in the course of time absorb the whole of the State revenues. The onus of obtaining reductions always rests,however,on the Political Agent and my predecessor obtained some undertaking from Shaiich iiamad to the effect that he would not increase the Civil List without consulting him. fthen,however,Shaikh Hamad increased the Civil List by Rs.36,000 without con- suiting him no objection was raised. 4. Upon assuming charge of this Agency at the ena of April 1929,Mr.Belgrave drew ny attention to his letters on former occasions regarding the growing Civil List. I went into the matter and it appeared to me that urgent action was necessary but,unfortunately Colonel Barrett, who was then officiating as Political Resident,aid not share my views and the matter was postponed. In my letter No:94-C dated the 28th July 1929 I again brought forward the matter,which I had discussed verbally with him before and also referred to it in my telegram No:922 dated the 9th August 1929,with the result that I was allowed to urge a reduction upon the Shaikh and a cut of some Rs.15,000/- in the Civil List was affected. 5. The situation,however,continued to deteriorate and in my letter No:C/9 of the 15th February 1931 to the late Sir Hugh Biscoe,! pointed out that the matter was again serious-3- t r and advised a \0/o cut in the Al Khalifa pay be effected* This was finally carried out,not without some unpleasentness, and through an error of Captain Parke ! s Shaikh Isa T s pay was. omitted from the reductions. 6* Owing to the shrinkage of revenue,however,the Civil List is far in excess of the which Sir Hugh Biscoe considered the absolute maximum and I attach tables which show the relative reduction in the Civil List for the past five years and another table which gives the relative pro portions of the Civil List to revenue for the past nine years. These figures show very clearly to what extent the Al Khalifa have received the lion T s share of the Bahrain Govern ments resources. 7. It is clear now that administrative expenditure has reached a minimum which cannot be reduced without loss of efficiency,and the only means by which the State can balance its budget is by further reoictions in the allowances of the Ruling family,since enhanced Customs dues will produce little. I wish to make it quite clear that the amount shown in the Civil List does not include the amounts paid to members of the Ruling family for sitting on courts,or any thing else that can be described as work. My proposals for dealing with the present situation are as follows:- (i(). I do not suggest an immediate reduction in the Civil List. For three years in my King’s Birthday speech I prophesied a fall in the pearl market,but this year (though there were no si^ns of it at the time) I prophesied a rise. This rise nas already taken place and the market is admittedly 25^,possibly SG/v,better than last year. It will take time,however,for this improvement to have effect and I suggest,therefore,tnat the figures for another two months should be studied before any drastic action is taken. The State is still in possession of a Reserve i?und of over 2^- lakhs and in any other country this would be considered a most tortunate situation. &gt;.e have to remember,however,that/ / -4- Bahrain is entirely dependent on its own resources. (ii) . I aonot consider,however,that no action should be taken. Two years ago Shaikh Hamad gave an undertaking that when any member of the Al Khalifa died,he would take advantage of his death to reduce tne Civil List by the amount of his allowance,if necessary,granting . a reduced amount to his successors. During my absence the eldest son of Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa al Khalifa died and I regret to say that as the result of the usual pressure,Shaikh Hamad immediately agreed to add the allowance to Shaikh Muhammad ? s pay. For this there is no justification whatever. Shaikh muhanuaad is of little value to the State and receives Rs.b,500/- for his negligible efforts,his only post being President of the Manama Municipality. Moreover,ne has large estates,which all bring him in a fair amount and this year,as the date crop has been good,will bring in a larger amount than last year. (iii) . I suggest,therefore,that a letter should issue from the Political Resident to Shaikh Hamad pointing out the deplorable showing of the first half year T s figures; urging every possible economy in the Al Khalifa allow ances and mentioning the instance of the death of Shaikh Muhammad’s son and saying that it is presumed his allowance has been reduced and asking for confirm ation of this fact. It will then be possible for you to go into the matter upon your visit to Bahrain and follow up the matter with Shaikh Hamad. Shaikh Hamad is a confirmed optimist. At the moment he is heavily in debt but this does not restrain him from indulging in expensive- buildings,paying for his sons buildings, which are equally unnecessary,and giving away gold daggers etc.,on his usual scale. The only means of countering his optimism is to show him figures (which have to be explained to him by his brother,ShaikhAbdulla,and his son,Shaikh Salman) together with specific demands for certain reductions* He will always be in financial difficulties no matter wnat his pay isl 8. If,however,the State revenues continue to fall there will be no option but to make some further cut. I parti cularly request that the reference to the allowances of neceasea Al Khalifa should be stressed as Shaikh Isa is suffering from a deadly complaint am may possibly die this cold weather. His wife on whom he is greatly dependent is also ill. His family at the moment have quite aeciaed how they will divide his pay and it will be necessary on your next visit to make it quite clear that this must go towards a general reuuction in the Civil List,though,ofcourse,it will be difficult to find a formula to convey this to Shaikh Hamad while his father is still alive.

Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Camp, Bahrain, dated 10th December 1952. Subject : Bahrain finances. V . n c- Sir, I have the honour to refer to Captain Prior s letter No. C/202, of 25th November 1932, on the subject of the finances of the Bahrain State. 2. You will remember that we discussed this import- -ant question with Mr. Belgrave, the Financial Aaviser to the State. Mr. Belgrave - as he had previously intifrat- -ea in his letter - concurred in our opinion that the financial position of the State was serious. Tnere is no need for me to recapitulate the details of this posit- „ion . which have - of late - often been referred to in various despatches. Briefly the prosperity of the State largely - one might say mainly - depends on two factors which may be laoelleo as more or less artificial: the pearl trade, and the transit trade on which the State takes customs cues. The former trade has considerably diminished, and the latter is also threatened with oimin- -ution if not with extinction. To this must be ac*ea the trade depression all over the world, ana the drop in the price of commodities, which - as the State derives its largest quota of revenue from ad valorem customs dues has naturally caused a considerable decrease in receipts to the Treasury. 3. The Political Agent, Bahrain.2 3 The drop in the pearl trade is, of course, • quite understanaable. Pearls are a pure luxury, and in the present state of general financial stringency the demand for these luxuries is naturally small. There has, however, been a recent rise in prices, ( vine para graph 7 (i) of Captain Priori letter No. C-202 of 25th November 1932, and we cah only hope that this will con- -tinue. 4. The question of the Transit Traae is a more complicated one and has been dealt with in my despatch No. C/44, of 10th December 1932. 5. It is obvious that some considerable economy should be made in the State f s expenditure, and the most obvious source fcr such an economy is, as Captain Prior points out in his letter quoted above, tne Civi l List, which - vide paragraph 8 of Hr. Belgrave T s letter of 18th November - absorbs 62# of the total revenue. One com- -paratively simple way of reducing the List is for the • Shaiih, on the death of a member of the A1 Khalifa family, to cancel his allowance, or at any rate to grant a reduced amount to his successor ( vide paragaaph 7 (ii) and (ill) of Captain Priori letter). Mr. Belgrave informed us that he had had - on a definite order from His Excellency - to pay Shaikh Muhammad the first month’s full allowance of his deceased son. 6 0 There is also the question cf the far larger allowance of the late Shaikh* Isa ( who died yesterday), amounting to over Ks. 60,000 - per annum ( paragraph 8 of Captain Prior’s letter). In discusaing this question we agreed that some immediate action was necessary to prevent the Shaikh passing orders, which later he might find aiificult to rescind, dividing this allowance amongst members of the A1 Khalifa family - himself includ -ed. We are going to pay a visit of condolence on tnethe Shaikh this, afternoon, and I will leave behind me a letter for His Excellency, copy of which la enclosed* 7. When you have your interview witn the Shaikh on the matter of Shaikh Isa’s allowance your object will be, of course, to point out to hini once again the eer- -ious financial situation of his government and to press him to let a large proportion of the allowance, if poes- •ible the whole, lapse to the State. The argument that if the State finally becomes bankrupt , vmicn appears not too unlikely if Clastic economies axe not raaae, H.M f s. Government may have to step in and assume complete financial control, may have some effect on the Shaikh, and more probably on his family, if you care to use it. 6 It would be an excellent thing if some stand- -ard for the Civil List could be fixed in relation to the prosperity, or otherwise, of the State. In discuss -ing this point you suggested that a sliding scale for the Civil List, with a maximum ana perhaps a minimum limit, might be fixed in proportion to the gross revenue of the State. Mr. Belgrave agreed with this suggestion in principle, and so do I. You might diecuss this matter further with Mr. Belgrave, and let me know how far it would be practicable to institute tne proposed scale. 9 The Civil List is the most obvious item in which economies could be made. There may, however, be others and I would be glad if you would explore any other avenues of economy there may be.

Sir, I have the honour to forward statements of Revenue and Expenditure for the month of Shaaban Rajah, ending Novr 29th, 1932. Including these figures the general position is as follows Budgeted revenue, 7 months Rs 4,60,600/- Actual revenue, 7 months 4,02,117/- Deficit on Budget 58,483/- Budgeted expenditure, 7 months 4,60,600/- Actual expenditure, 7 months 4,55,908/- Excess actual expenditure over Actual Revenue, 7 months 53,791/- Percentage of Civil List of total revenue for 7 months 62% uThe amount appropriated against the Reserve Fund in seven months is now Rs 31,000/-. There are also bills remaining unpaid amounting to approximately Rs 10,000/-. The financial position during the past month instead of improving has deteriorated. It can be summed up by the fact that the State is approxi mately Rs 9,000/- worse off than it was at the end of the previous month; the position at that time, and my comments on it, were contained in my letter No. 728/SF of 18th Rajah 1351 U6th Novr 1932) to which I request you to refer. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.

D.O.No. 957 Bahrain, Jany, 11, 1933. When the question of the State’s finances was last discussed, I think it was agreed that the position should be reviewed after two months time. Two months have passed and in my opinion the position shows no improvement except that during the second month the death ocurred of Shaikh Isa, who received Rs 5,000/- per month from the Civil List and two or three thousand rupees on various Eids etc. If Shaikh Isa’s pay was not continued the State would save slightly over Rs 60,000/- per annum; at present according to the figures for eight months the State will be faced with a deficit of about Rs 75,000/- on the amount budgeted as Revenue. When Shaikh Isa died innumerable relations and retainers assumed that his allowance would be divided among them and clamoured for the money from Shaikh Hamad. The real financial position is only realised by Shaikh Hamad and his brothers and Shaikh Salman; the rest of the Khalifah deliberately blind themselves to financial facts. Shaikh Hamad has agreed not to make any alterations in the Civil List without consulting the Political Agent. Although his acceptance of this suggestion is, in writing,- 2 - writing, somewhat vague, he himself quite realises that he agreed to it. After discussing the matter with me, we came to the conclusion that it would not be in contraven tion of the arrangement with the Political Agent to expend the amount of Shaikh Isa ! s allowance for the ten days of the month before he died. This amounted to slightly over Rs 1,500/-. The money was handed to Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa who distributed it according to his discretion among some of the various relations and others who are supposed to have been in receipt of allowances from the late Shaikh Isa. Shaikh Isa^ widow received Rs 700/- although I under stand that she considered herself entitled to the whole amount previously paid to Shaikh Isa. According to the custom of the Khalifah family, which was grudgingly admitted by various interested relations, the property of the Ruler is not subject to Shara Law, but is inherited entirely by his suc cessor. Shaikh Isa’s property passed to Shaikh Hamad. When however the matter was examined, it was discovered that almost all Shaikh Isa’s property, consisting of valuable date gardens and some houses, had been gifted away during his lifetime, a great proportion of it quite recently, and most of the gifts were made to his widow and to a favourite relation of hers who himself owned a very great deal of property. The remainder of Shaikh Isa’s waste estate which passes to Shaikh Hamad is not worth more than Rs 15,000/- per annum,w e 'T annum, further it was found that all rents and leases had been collected in advance, so until the present leases expire the estate will produce next to nothing. When, however, Shaikh Isa f s widow dies, all the property which she holds in gift from Shaikh Isa will revert to the Ruler Shaikh Hamad, this also is according to the Khalifah family custom. It is verylikely that she will endeavour to dispose of it in her lifetime, but this is forbidden according to a proclamation issued some years ago forbidding sale of Khalifah property to persons outside the family. Before paying the Rs 1,500/- due to Shaikh Isa, Shaikh Hamad sent Shaikh Abdullah to me to discuss money affairs and the Civil List. We assumed that Shaikh Isa r s allowance was extinct and examined methods for obtaining funds for some of the relations, said to have been dependent on Shaikh Isa, without increasing the Civil List. By making certain cuts we obtained Es 543/- per month without making any deductions from the sons or grandsons of Shaikh Isa. Some of the people who suffered deductions neither lived in Bahrain nor are they members of the Khalifah, two others it was found had died, but their salaries continued to be drawn. Unfortunately their payments were very small. I was informed that Shaikh Hamad approved of the suggested cuts but thought they might be postponed until next year when conditions might improve so much thatthat they would not be necessary. In the meantime having obtained the Rs 1,500,/- the matter has been allowed by him to drop. I make the following suggestions.— 1. From beginning of next year the Civil List should depend on the revenue of the previous year, and should not be a fixed amount independent of revenue. A maximum should be settled. iX&amp;Qjrt. Or, as has been suggested, there should be a fixed amount with something in the nature of a bonus depending on the increase of revenue. 2. For the last three months of this year the following changes should be made:- Deductions amounting to Rs 543/- per month according to the cuts suggested by Shaikh Abdullah. A cut of 5% on the remaining salaries with the 4 - exception of Shaikh Hamad himself which will amount to Rs 920/-, this total can be made up to Rs 1,500/- per month. The sum of Rs 1,500/- per month, out of the salary previously paid to Shaikh Isa will be paid to Shaikh Hamad who can distribute it as he wishes among dependents of Shaikh Isa. In this way the amount which was previously paid to Shaikh Isa will be saved. Shaikh Hamad ! s own allowance is not unreasonably large in view of the heavy calls which are made upon it and when a reduction was made before he suffered more in f■r -5- /fSr K' in proportion to others as certain odd allowances which he used to take were cancelled. A reduction at present would, in my opinion, not be a very great hardship to the other relations. Most of them live very extravagantly and the local cost of living has gone down in the last few years to about half what it used to be when the Civil List was originally settled upon. t T|!l All the figures and statistics regarding the Civil List are contained in my letter No. 736/SF dated Novr. 17, 1933 and the conditions under which 1 wrote that letter have not, in my opinion, materially changed.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith statements of Revenue and Expenditure for the 8 months of the year, up to the end of Sheaban, 1351. The month of Shaaban, being the month preceding Ramadhaan, is usually one of the best months in the year. The Customs collections show an increase of Rs 11,000/- over the previous month. Owing to the payment of Rs 10,000/- Royalty on the oil concession Tf Rents of Govt, lands” has increased, but all other sources of revenue have decreased. The Revenue shows a total increase of Rs 17,000/- over the previous month. The deficit on the Budgeted revenue for 8 months is now Rs 49,900/-. y Expenditure for Shaaban exceeded that of Rajab by about Rs 7,000/- taking into account outstanding bills. The financial position of the State shows an improve ment of about Rs 10,000/- as compared to the position at end of previous month. 7/ithout wishing to appear unduly pessikistic 1 must point out that the financial position continues to be extremely serious, the apparent improvement is disappointing' in a month which should have been unusually productive and the extra Rs 10,000/- only represents the amount paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Go. Ltd., for the oil concession. The financial position was to be reviewed after two months,^ the two months have now exnired and the improvement is negligible. 1 have the honour to be, j/ Sir, Your obedient servant, adviser to the government.CONFIDENTIAL.

My dear Warner, You will remember mentioning to me on the telephone a -tp. . (.. 3 ago t;:at in our telegram to the Government of India and the Political Resident ilo.2848 of 2nd November about the action to be taken in connection with Bahrain tariff autonomy, we had made no specific reference to the suggestiaijin paragraph 5 of your d.o.letter to me of the 26th September, ho.E.4750/782/ 91, that we should make it clear to the Resident that the Shai:&lt;h ' must repl y acknowledging - and presumably expressing J gratitude for - the concession embodied in the Resident's letter.' 2 . I must confess that we had, in fact, taken no action on tms point. But that was because we feel no doubt ourselves that some reply may be expected from the Shaikh to a communication of this character and thought it unnecessary to draw special attention to it - the more so as copies of your letter of the 26th September were sent both to Powle and to the Government of India by the Air Mail of the 30th September. But to make sure that the point is on record, I am also sending a copy of this ^ letter to India and to the Resident. Yours ever, sd/- J.G.LAITHWAITE.

Tne denth of the l?te Ruler has er-sea the situation ana should considerably reduce the deficit,even if the whole of the allowance is not ailowco to irpse. 4. ‘ihere seems little reason to joubt that an oil field will be aevelopeci,ana we may, ihiereiort,reasonably hope for an income to the Etate from royalties in ti.c not too distant future. If Bahrain gets royalties, the yateftftiient position will oe assureu. If Bahrain does-not get royalties,something much more urastic than it is possible to suggest at present may have to be none. There are slight signs,moreover,of an improvement in trade. 5. 1 think,however,that at present «e should assume that Bahrain may expect sn income from oil ana also from an improve ment in trace,ana that we should avoiu,so far as possible,argumerj about tne small economies: that small deficits for the next two o three years should be met from me reserve: and that,in the mean time,we should concentrate on La; ail important question of tryir to get the Ruler and the Al Xhalifah to accept a reasonable sliding scale for the Civil List.6. srhaps you may wish to discuss the matter on your forthcoming’ visit to Bahrain.

It is distinctly satisfactory that some Rs.42,000/- of the Rs.60, 000 /-which constituted the late Shaikh Isa's ! allowance will lapse to the State,Rs.1,500/- per mensem of the 3 * allowance being paid by Suaikh Hamad to the dependents of Shaikh Isa. 3. With regard to the suggestions made by the Financial Adviser at the end of his letter. No:l is the most important. It originated,! think,with you during the discussions we had on my last visit to Bahrain,and it seems to be the best line to take. Please let me have further details in due course. 4. With regard to Mr.Belgrave's other suggestions as to certain cuts. You will doubtless discuss them with ilr.BeIgrave,though I agree in general with the suggestion made in Paragraph 5 of your letter that we should avoid as far as possible arguments about small economies,that small deficits ior the next two or three years should be met from the reserve and that we should concentrate on the all important questionof trying to get the Ruler and the a 1 Khalifah to accept a reasonably sliding scale in the Civil List. \' c ~ Lieut Colonel.
