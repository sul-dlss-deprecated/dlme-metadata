Dated: 4/4/24. 10 Reference my telegram lit'dated I have had a long talk with my old friend Hlllal Umtairi and have, I think, grasped the conditions of this raid clearly. There is no doubt that Faisal Ad Dawish was at the head of the raiders but the regular forces of the Ikhwan were few in number 5 standards say 700 men. These were under strict discipline but they were joined by indiscriminate mob of ordinary Bedouins attracted by the hope of loot when the word went round that Faisal Ad Dawish was going raidi These men came and went at will and were kept at a good distance from the actual regular force under Ad Dawish. *t is said to be owing to the presence of these arabs that this Ikhwan raid was not of the usual ferocious character and bore the aspect of an ordinary Bedouin raid of old time .My informant says 4hat i** no women and children were touched and that many lives were spared by the connivance of the Arab helpers of the Ikhwan.

I h re treated heoe two meetings of the Conference in rather greater detail th n usual,for Uiey show the cAireme difficulty I hare in dealing with the Kashimiteo 9 attitude, 'hey oome here,detenained not to yield an inch with cutagorical instructions which permit no hope of an agreement and convinced that Ion fa’ud is going to fee politically dead in a very short time, tn the oth‘&lt;r hand, I have ‘Us xcellency thi High Commissioner of Iraq complaining ol a recent raid of almost unprecedented magnitude which is alleged to have been committed against Ir q fey a force of 2(xx Ikhman and warning «e of the se-rioutness of tho raid and the still more serious conocqaenocs that may be expected to follow,if drastic steps are not t^ken to restrain!

One finds it difficult to resist the conclusion that the Hashimites resent British interference;feel that they cannot do without it altogetiitr; are prepared to go to any length to destroy Ion Sa f ud; «re convinced that they will prevail very shortly out desire to do so in their own way. «hen they get hurt, they come back to us to complain of what &amp; villain I bn Ba’ud is. ihurt is no doubt that the Bulian of Uajd is a most unpleasant person, an inveterate intriguer,and his myrmidons, the lkhuan,even worse. Xhe tales that 1 hear of iheir Conduct during their forays axe revolting in the extreme. hey spare ntitner man,woman nor child and are as destr^c ive as a horde of locusts. 6. At the same time, throughout these n gotiations,with the one exception of the time when they fell foul of ®t by their duplicity in denying that they had bound themselves to the decision of Sir rercy Cox in the matter of condensation for raid*^ I cannot refrain from contrasting the scrupulously correct attitude,on the surlaco, of the Buitan of tfajd and his delegates . their apparently earnest desire for peace and the sacrifices that they are prepared to suomit to to secure it,with the childish and uncompromising attitude of the H shim!tas. nd the more H^jd shows its desire for peace,the more the ashimites harden their hearts. 7. here are other considerations which 1 feel it my duty to bring to your not ice,although I leel considerably embarrassed in doing so in view ol telegraphic correspondence coramencing with my personal telegram of the 7th of -arch to your address and the extremely courteous and considerate reply -- for which I trust X may here be permitted to express the deepest and most respectful gratitude -- contained in the closing lines of your fto.llb dated the ' th of b rch 1&amp;2 • There are unmistakableJl*?® indications thnt wt, — I include here the other members of the Conference as myself •• have outstayed our welcome nd I venture to douot whether it is consonant with the dignity of Hie Majesty’s Government to permit the further continuance of tne Conference, unless very clear hopes can be entertained that some material success will come out of it. Locally, I think I can confidently assert that no one believes that anything will come of it and the Shaikh of Kuwait has openly told me that he thoroughly dislikes the prolonged residence of the Najdi delegates in his town. He says that they are ungrateful,th t they have belittled in public utterances his hospitality,and I have not the slightest doubt in saying that he personally will now be delighted when the onference breaks up. It is quite possible that the Najd delegates are,in their idle moments oi which they have plenty,sedulously intriguing with Shaikh Abdulla bin Salim,the conspicuous rival of the Shaikh of Kuwait. On the other hand to do the Hajd delegates mere justice, I have little doubt that they would leave Kuwait as joyfully as every one else concerned. It is with keen personal regret th t I record my belief that the Conference has now served the only purpose that subsequent events have shown could reasonably have been expected from it. lo some limited extent it has preserved the peace during a very critical period;it has also elucidated the attitude and the views of the protagon -ists in this struggle. 8. I would therefore venture to put forward my conviction that,if, by the time this despatch recches London, the conference is still dragging on this unsatisfactory way, it will be time to put an end to it as speedily as possible. 9. I do now share the a .prehensions ol ris xcellency t e High Commissioner of Iraq in regard to the serious conseq’ ence s that may be expected to follow from the f ilure to secure peace, if combined with no effort to bring sea pressure to bear on His Highness the Sultan of Najd. I consider that the conclusion of the tonference or its postponement to next coldteaeon nill result in neither peace nor war worth, oi the name . Ihere will be bickering; there will be raid® of major or minor importance during the raiding eeuLon :ut this is a condition of affairs with which Central rabia has been familiar from time immemorial, it is not a state of affairs that one can contemplate with equanimity or satisfaction but neither is it an occasion for despondency or ilarm. vo secure peace on these wide-flung irontiers will N a matter of time and I Tenture to think, purely from a local point oi view,that the efforts cl is •aj^sty’s overnment might be confined,to pr&lt; serving the balance of power between the Ikhwan and the Kafthimiten and to convinc- -ing both sides tnat they will not permit either party to gain any very m terial advantage over tnt. other, it is extremely douotiul whether any better ruler over Hajd and the wild ledou^in of the interior can \&gt;* found tiian a personality like Ion Sa 1 ud. t same time Ibn Sa 1 ud on the sea ( except in a! Hassa which has no proper harnours} or say in Peoca or Medina would be an intolerable nuisatce. He is admirably suited to the desert and our efforts should be confined to making him stay th^re. But 1 also venture to contemplate with ext reroe satisfaction the willingness he now chows to accept a British igent for i think what we principally suffer irom at the present juncture is that tru representative of ohc British Government in the Persian Gulf and, for that matter,the authorities in London have little satisiB ciory opportunity of le&lt; rning; and appreciating th^ jbb jd point of view. The presence of a -ritish will serve a still more useful purpose by acquainting the Sultan of Hajd or his successors with the British point oi view cl what is good for central *rabia and the limits which they put to the extension of the power oi tre Ikhwan. I have h* ' rd the argument advanced tnat there is no sense in putting a British oificer into &amp; positron where he might beheld to hotiage by a savage ruler who wlehed to impose his •• or satisfy his desire fcr vengeance •• on the British overnm nt or its policy, I cons der the risk infinitesimal, though of course it is always there when a British officer proceeds beyond the ritish frontiers into a savage country. Ihere are hundreds of men running that risk today and there seeiae no reason why a British expedition should be forced to strrt to avenge any regrettable event of the kind anticipated, ihe man selected would realise the rick and accept it as part of the day’s work. 1C. Uith euch an adviser preeent at head ^uarterc and always at the elbow of the Sultan of Hajd, I thins we might exp. ct that he will adopt an even more reasonable attitude tuan he does at present and even his attitude today is f; r from unreasonable• 11. 1 shall in no way relax my efforts at this conference and shall try and obtain some slight measure of agreement and I think that there are reasonable prospects of some slig t steps being taken to advance good rtlations uetween Irai and Va v d« i keep impressing on the envoys oi both parties,whenever i get an opportunity,that th^y cannot expect peace in a day. xhe appointment oi loci inspectors on the boundary in itself is an enormous step in advance and,if these men work conscientiously and energetically, time will show what steps are necessary to keep the peace and one can trust to the good sense of both Hajd and Iraq gradually to coma to an agreement and a policy. Iraq may find it nccese&amp;ry to turrunder disturbers of the peace and recalcitrant rebels ag?inst Ibn Sa’ud without troubling itself as to thuir fate in a country which, in the matter oi morality and justice, is about on a level with the ook of Judges or,on the othur hand,the Sultan of ihjd may gradually come to realise that the escape of a few malcontents to the refuge of Iraq is &amp; max ter not attended with sufficiently serious consequences to disturb his peace ofti- mim4 oat it wh gr«*t h^alvr and will provide the only remedy, ceupltd with poaiuict and good will on both eide». lor thii moment, Tr**t* Jordanla and Hedjas appear ^ven more u^ilicuit and the remedy Uitre will a, lor future cont^rence ra*:e ..ingfc, to * 3 M 2 kin&lt; the in&amp;tructiont of plenipoitniieiriee o^fort txuir debpatoh nti orin^ preeeare to hear the principait, fo.g, the *air Atdulla and the in^. of H&lt;:dja£,eo that the plenipotentiaries they send ehould be instructed to ootain the best terme tu^-y c n and not; insist on ImposslMllt •ies, xhifc can only fc* oon^ by such principals acting in concert *ith thwir responsible rritish aavioers.

' FOURTEENTH SESSION On the 25th of March was held the 14th Session of the Conference. The President and Secretary were present,and on behalf of Nejd Dr.Abdulla Damluji the President of the Nejd delegation with Mulla Hafidh and Saiyid H^shim as members.'irans Jordania was represented by Ebrahim Hashim (Minister of Education) and All Khulqi Pasha. Trans Jordania was asked to open the discussion and did so by presenting their old claim for the boundary commencing from Madain Salih and enclosing Taimah and thhnce Jauf and Sakaka on Trans Jordanian side and running up to the meeting place Jabal Anaizali where Iraq and Nejd boundaries also meet. At this point, the Nejd President was called on to reply. He repeated the well known historical arguments, with which we are familiar,on the Nejd claim to Wadi Sirhan and laid stress on the fact that the population of the Wadi Sirhan was by nature and habits .Bedouin and more homogeneous with the population of Nejd than with that of Syria. He concluded by saying that the Multan of Nejd will be satisfied with nothing else then the Wadi Sirhan including Kaf. To this both Trans Jordanian envoys replied,one succeeding the other. They also brought forward historical arguments to show that Wadi Sirhan belongs to Syria, that the Turks during the war had a Q,aim Muqam in Jauf and also exercised suzerainty over the Wadi Sirhan and that the Bedouin tribes there had paid 'Zikat* to the Turks. That Syria had also its Bedouins,that Nuri ash Sha’alan had been in constant feud with Bin Rashid,when the latter attempted to exercise authority in Jauf. Nuri ash Sha’alan was a Syrian,acknowledged Turkish Suzerainty and such rights, as he pretended to in Jauf, were held of the Turks. Trans Jordania as heir of the Turks in Southern Syria succeeded to all rights pertaining to that territory. That the population of Wadi Sirhan wm, f-:i,r closer akin to the population ol Syria Ahan it was to t at of Nejd; thate was the natural boundary to the Nafud between Jauf2 and Hail: and there would be no peace in the land ii Ibn Sa’ud wae allowed to get a footing in Jauf or Sakaka. Ali Khulqi Pasha laid especial stress on the fact that Trans Jordanian tribes were now in full occupation and settled down in the Wadi Sirhan which was their natural grazing ground at this season of the year. They had no other. said that it was clear that,if both sides maintained their respective attitudes there would be no hope of peace. Common sense and political necessity dictated 3 possible alternatives and both parties would have to give way to some extent. The three alternatives were (1) To leave matters to a plebiscite who should declare by means of a majority of votes to whom the Wadi Sirhan was to belong: (2) To divide the Wadi Sirhan in half: Trans Jordania to take the northern and Nejd the southern half; (3) To create a buffer state with say Nuri ash Sha’alan as chief over the whole of the Wadi Sirhan like Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sutah,over Kuwait and dependencies,both parties agreeing to respect the independence of this new territory and make their own arrangements with the new chief to secure grazing rights so far as necessary. The parties agreed to think the matter over and to reply ti' next day. At this point the President thought^to intervene andNCI--S bY tlLfbin CV COM- s srjoi; . tn the 26th iu^rch wat held the l.&gt;th Ceetion oi the Coni#rtnee,th« satte meraberi being preeent ae at the previoue meeting. i&gt;oth partite ehovrud eoae reluctance to commit thcmeelveg in lull meeting and 1 asKed the Hajd delegation to withdraw while irant Jordania intimated to me th-ir reply. A* noon it was stated,! would recall the Kajada and hear what they had to soy. they readily agreed. Ihe 'irans Jordanian envoys began by st ting that they were strictly bound by their instructions which did not permit them to yield one inch of the «&gt;adi firhan to I bn Sa* ud. If any dtcision was come to to adjudge even Jauf and EaJcaka alone to Ibn Sa’ud, they had explicit instructions to withdraw from the Conference. T}n?y thoroughly mistrusted Nuri ash Sha’alan who, if r ised to power, would be as great a thorn in thuir side as Ibn C *ud himself. -ihe utmost they could go in the way of concession was to agree to the creation of a buffer state, where Kuri ash Eha*alan would rule in Jouf nd the southern h If of the ; adi Eirhan,but the northern half must belong tc Xyans Jordania. I pointed out to them that it was c*uite possible that the - ritish Government would refuse to support th^ir ruler in such a claim which,into the bargain,they must be well aware, Kajd would never accept . it was somewhere about this stage of the proceedings that Ali hhulql Pasha made the remarkable statement that ho could assure me that ion Ea*ud would be head in two months. On Major More asking him whether he had heard the reports of the &gt; m*:ric n Doctor D: race who nac recently reached d&amp;hrain,/II Khulqi Pasha replied that he did not refer to the physical death of Ibn 6a*ud. He was speaking metaphorically and meant that,in 2 months, Ion £&gt;\*ud would be politic lly dead, when the rejoinder was made that,assuming that ho was right in this bold prophecy, it was a matter of comparative indifference wh t the envoys might agree to in the matter oi the Wadi Eirh n,for,in the event of ibn Salad’s political death,the Shammar under bin Rashid&amp; - 2 - the would infallibly re-occupy Hail and Wadi Sirh n would come of itfeelf buck to 'irane Jordania, he said that the poLteBeion of Jauf would probably bring Ion Sa’ud to life again, 2. as Loon ae Ali Khul-i had finiehed his remarks, I euggeeted tljat,al i.er all, we were anxious to gain time both to admit of the reply of the Sultan of Najd in regard to the raiscion of hiB son and aieo for a definite decision as to despatch of Iraq envoy© whose coming, as they knew, had been delayed on account of the reported raid. If the Trane-Jordanian envoys left with matters at a deadlock, the Najd envoys would prooebly leave also and there would be a complete breakdown and it occurred to me that they could prolong matters sufficiently by telegraphing the exact state of affairs, as disclosed by these two Sonference meetings, to the &lt; mir bdulla and asking for his orders, pointing out that it was obvious that something of the Wadi Sirhan would have to be given up. They agreed to do this. 3. I called in the Hujd delegates and asked the Trans Jordanian delegates in their turn to withdraw which they did. The Hajd delegates then came forward with the most sensible proposal,emanating from either side,that 1 h Vu heard since the Conference begn. xhey said that they would be prepared to submit the question oi the possession oi the whole of the Wadi Sirhan to a plebiscite provided that the King of Kedjaz consented to a similar plebiscite for Khurma and Turaba. The cuestion of Khaibar and Taimah was raised and, as already telegraphically reported, the hi jd delegates gave me to understand that,if the plebiscite gave them Kaf, they would be prepared also to put Kh&amp;ibar and Taimah to the decision of a plebiscite but it was agreed that it would not be advisable to raise this question at the present juncture. 4. The Trans Jordanian envoys were then called in and the Conference resumed. The president told both parties th*t Trans Jordania had agreed to make a further reference by telegram to the unir Abdulla with the express object of g iningtime *nd he also told the lrani&gt; Jordanian envoys ihst the Najada undertake to accept a plebiscite in the *adi Sirh^n provided that hie Majesty hing Husain agrees to a Eimilar plebiscite ior huraa and *uraba. It was arranged that one further meeting would be held on the 27th oi Mrirch to pass today’e proceedings and that the Conference would then adjourn sine die to await news Irom cith-r *rans Jordan!a,Baghdad or Riyadh. It is evident th^t the whole crux of the question between Irans Jord&amp;nia and Iraq turns on the tadi Sirhan and the &amp;ttdi Sirh n alone. b. 1 would conclude the account of the proceedings of the 26th karch with a note that it is remarkable th t neither party showed the slightest enthusiasm ior a buffer state under Kuri ash Ch&amp;’alan. I have already dwtlt ?ibove on the attitude oi the ‘i’rans-Jordanian envoys. The bajd envoys in their turn poured u scorn on the proposal but based it rather on the personality of the proposed ruler. They declare that he was utterly unreliable, offered allegiance to each party in turn Hajd, Trans Jordania.the French in Cyria and Baghdad and repudiated that allegiance whenever it was Inconvenient in hit own interest. s o result oi .v,, ; i- proceedings,i have come to the conclusion that,even ii it it possible to form a cuffor state of any kind, it will not do to leave hurl ash Sha’alan in charge. I am of course not suflioiently acquainted with local pdlitics in that part of the world to put forward any alternative proposal fox tht constitution of a cuifer mate and I do not think that there is much hope of useful guidance from the pl*nipot«nti*ri*s in the present, state oi aifairs if matter*: oomc to a plebiscite, presumably the people oJ the Wadi as Sirhaa will have to sta^e whether they prefer ( 1 ) The Sultan of H jd (2) The Amir Abdulla (3) A division between the two competitors n med above 4 ', a buffer state whose independence both parties a^rc* to respect• a corollary to prop.al four preeumally a comtiuntaseumoly will iiuYo D8 c - lied to decide the form of ite own Governmunt. 1 do no w at th&gt;i aaiae time dieguifie frors myeelf the extrame improbaoility that such an aoucmbly will be able to arrive at a definite or a eatiafaciory conclusion.f* Has Aj uzali, Kuwait,Persian Gulf, 5th April 1S24.

The President asked the Irane Jordanian delegates what their opinion was of the three proposals which he had p&gt;it forward at tbu previous me ting. Ibrahim Beg Hashim :- Mr.i'resident,when wt claim Wadi £lrhan,our claim i just for the various reasons which we have mentioned in previous meetings,and besides, the district in question is a stage on the way to Iraq, but,although we want to administer Jauf, we wish to it to be clearly understood that we h; ve no intention of interfering with Hail,for example we have a civilised and properly organized government with regular laws which tend to th establishment of peace in the country and progress amongst tue inhabitants.Whereas, all Ibn Sa*ud wants Jaul lor is as a case from which to entice our tribes iroin us nd to incite them against us,which would be intoler tie. It is Ion Ta^ud's bein' in Jauf that prevents our budget from being as it should be even now,as our tribes threaten to go over to him whenever we want to enlorce any order or levy taxes. 11 British officials speak highly of our administration and cevtlopment and everything except the state of our linances -but that is only because Jauf is in the hands of Ibn Ba*ud. resident :- From what you say I g ther that it would suit you to leave this country as an independent st^te under Ibn Sha’lan. Ibrahim heg Hashim ; In winter all our tribes are in the Wadi Sirhan.So how can we agree to Ibn Jha*lan ruling it. Ibn Ba*ud maintains that he wants to safeguard his communications with Damascus. Well Jauf and Cak&amp;kah alone affect his communica- -tions so why should there by any talk about Wadi Cirhan m-2- g @ a nd «iuraiyat V Let ua uu conlin« our ditcuaeion to Juuf and Sakakah.

(Received 8-4-24)„ • Xour telegram No„ 160 d/ited 4th April* I have now received the report*of a special service officer. Captain Driver, who hae visited all the scattered camps of refugees from the Ikhwan raid and has careful)./ tested and collated evidence from a variety of sources* He has come to the conclusion that 146 men and 127 women and children were killed by the Ikhwan, and 26,500 sheep, 3710 donkeys, 5 horses and 2 camels captured* The Ikhwan massacred all men and boys who were captured or wounded but spared women and the casualties among the latter were due to rifle fire at the tljie of the attack* The attacking force was commanded by Ibn Sa’ud’a principle lieutenant, Fhiaal ad-Dawlah^ and ■* “ • • numbered between twelve and sixteen thousand* The attack took place on the morning of 14th March, it was led by hors e * *• men who were subsequently reinforced by a large body of camel men* Fighting continued until sunset* The Ikhwan camped on the spot and remained there for three days after the attack* The scene of the raid was a network of wadis in the neighbourhood of Umm al-Hashlm Just within * Iraq territory* With all due respect I will now examine the argument that the Sultan of M&amp;jd was no more responsible for this raid than the Government of * Iraq was for the raids by tee Shammar last summer, and that the two seta of raids can be considered parallel* In the case of this raid by the Ikhwan (1) There was the Conference sitting to discuss the relaticns between the two states, and that fact should entail &amp; very^ special measure of abstinence from provocation on both sides . (2) Ibn Srv’ud had officially threatened in his letter datedi/®&gt; 22rKl Februnry that he would not restrain hla tribes from attacks on ’Xmq, on grounds which X showed in -ny telegnun No e 112 of 4th March to be entirely inadequate, and, as I said in in the fourth paragraph of the same telegram, there were reports that Dawlah was openly preparing for a raid for days before it took place. These facts confirm the conclusions unanimously arrived at by Knox, Trevor and. myself that Ibn Sa’ud must have been fully aware of these preparations for a raid; in fact I doubt whether he would deny this. (3i) The raid took place in ’Iraq territory. ( 4 )) The loss of life and property was very great.. On the other hand, the circumstances under which the raids by the Najd Shammar took place were as followss- [1) There was no conference sitting at the time, and thus no special aggravation or question of honour. (2) The raiders were small parties of not more than about -w - • # a thousand men who could cover long distances across the desert with little or no preparation and without being observed by the authorities,, *■ (3&gt;) In no case did the raiders attack within Majd territoiy anl consequeiftly the question of invasion did not come in , although it i* true that caravans, from liajd were usually the wictln&amp;o ( 4 ) The losses inflicted were small in comparison, and as far as can. be gathered from rather vague accounts the total maximum casualties claimed by Najd is only fifty all men I triink these facts will show that there can be no comparison between them. It will be seen from a review of ’Iraq’s attitude that It has shown very great forbearance _ ~ and that its attitude has been strictly in accordance with international principles accepted by the League of Nations* under extreme provocation. 1. Although King Faisal himself was convinced from the first reports received after Ibn Sa’ud^ threat that a□oat aerloua. raid had taicen arlc ^ waa a ^^ta of extreae indignation, I perauaded hiti to hold hia hand, reatrain hia peox)lft froia counter raids, and keex ) hia delegates at Basrcih. to await a full explanatlon 0 inquiries by British officers have now extended to three weeks and have conclusively proved a deliberate and destructive Invasion, of the territory of * Iraq while the Conference was actually sitting*., 2 8 The Government of 'Iraq now asks that in place of reprisals the measures l§.id down by the League of Nations viz the cutting off of supplies 0 In imposing this patient attitude on King Faisal I have strained my influence with him to the very utmost, and I greatly fear that it would not stand the additional strain which would be involved by urging hlii to Instruct his delegates to continue the Conference after this aggression on the part of Najd has been proved, and before any restitution or apology h&amp;s. been received from Najd* Faisal must think of his own reputation with his subjects and dare not take action which would be represented by the restive Assembly now sitting as a complete sacrifice of national honour* i Critics of the Treaty and Agreements,in the Assembly would be certain to seize on our refusal to bring pressure to bear on Ibn Sa*ud In accordance with the precepts of the League of Nations as a proof that we would not carry out our promise to defend ’Iraq if in the least inconvenient to us. These arguments would be reinforced by the fact that It Is notorious that the very first move towards cutting off the supplies of Najd would bring the Sultan .to his knees so that the frontier of ’Iraq could be secure.! adequately against future trouble without any cost or trouble to His V Majesty’s Government.

Ko. : 111 Dated : 10-4-24. Your telegram 134 dated 24th March. 17th Session Conference held this morning and whole situation reviewed as between Najd and Trans Jordania from all possible points of view. The Najd Plebiscite proposal definitely rejected by Trans-Jordan. Trans-Jordan then put forward proposal for neutral territory.Najd would have rejected it in any case but it was coupled with 3 impossible conditions. One. Return of al Rashid to their old dominion and authority. 101 dated 30th March as I had learnt, in the meantime,that no matter what views of Amir Abdulla might be ( See Jerusalem telegram 128 E dated brd April) Najd could not accept. The above solution was definitely rejected by both sides. on second alternative suggested in your telegram cited above anc suggested wide no man 1 s territory from Jabal Anaizah to Madain Salih to be accepted without prejudice;actual possessive rights secured to both parties in Taimah,Jauf and Kuryat al Milh rough boundary 2b miles east of Railway line and line of the Nafud parties were to undertake for 6 months from signature not to send troops authorities or org nised raids into that country; both parties to decline responsibility and Bedouins who went there kke. went at their peril. Trans Jordania accepted proposal Najd could only refer to their ruler. Both parties recorded that Conferences held hitherto showed no chance of peaceful solution except possibly the last for six months if Sultan would agree. They further recorded opinion in favour of meeting of principals as offering Two. Family of Ayidh to hold rule in Asir. Three. Najd vacates all Hedjaz territory. I then put forward officially proposal of my telegram I then attempted temporary 6 months truce and solutiononly hope of peaceful solution. Proceedings were signed by both parties and myself as true record of discussion. I allowed Trans-Jordanian envoys to leave Kuwait today for I saw that their continued presence here could serve no possible useful object. Please refer to your telegram 134^ Last resort*Sul tan s suggestion of direct agreement has not been pressed by Najd envoys and I do not think it is a serious proposal so I have not dragged it into the lime-light myself more especially in view of misgivings of Jerusalem. Baghdad Telegram 80-S dated 7th April holds out little hope of Iraq envoys reaching Kuwait before 12th April next when Najd envoys will certainly demand their own release and I can give no possible reasonable excuse for their retention. I therefore propose to yield to necessity and let them go. I hope to be able to close up all Conference details here by that date and proceed to India myself. My telegram No.105 dated 4th April. Apart from important technical objections of Air Officer Commanding there are rumours that Ibn Sa’ud.has left for El Qasim and conversations with Holmes who is now in Kuwait leads me to suppose that Companies in which he is interested will finance Sultan of Najd to extent proposed by me. If this is correct his financial condition cannot be so desperate as I understood it to be when I made my proposals so that apart from technical objections I would not myself now press drastic proposals of my telegram No.105 and would revert rather to attitude of my despatch No.138 dated 30th of March which left here by air 2nd April and should reach you by 16 th.-Knox.(P).

His letter of 4th Rajab ,also forwarded with the above despatch, is distinctly truculent - in tone and I fancy the Sultan fears that if he tried to restrain Bawish too much he would lose his influence over the more fanatical of his followers, I look on Ibn Sams’s letter of 32nd February as a warning, as an attempt to fore stall and show extenuating circumstances for raids by Bawish and others of his more fanatical followers, rather than as a threat ( vide my despatch Ho 53-T dated the 20th March) , In my letter of IBth March to Ibn Sa*ud, of which I enclosed -• a copy with this despatch, I warned him that earoplane actioi would be taken against Hajd raiders entering ‘Iraq, Reference Baghdad telegiam 136 , J think a flight over Riyadh would be a good thing when aeroplanes go to Bahrain as It would show that the pi ce is accessible if necessary eTelegram (?).

'ihe Najd ^elegation,howc.vtr,maintained that they could not give up thit dietriet becauee it is on their line of communication with Damascus. We,in order to coait to peace, tuen suggested that the discussion should be comined to this line of communications or in other words to Juuf and Bakaka alone, which should bo formed into an independant state recognised at such by both parties. The Hajd delegation however would not agree. Kr.President .then suggested three ways oi settling the case, (l) (l^ that V,di firhan be divided between the two parties.

The irons-Jordanian delegates said separated from Hajd by the sandy Nafud than which no other under Ibn Dha*lan. iou as&amp;ed us to communicate those suggestions to our at the March ifc24/Yull Conference that tlie Uajd Delegation would agree to a plebiscite in Jauf,Sr*kaka and tfadl Cirhan,provided a peloiscite be alto held in Kharmah and xurabah also. It have communicated all this to our Government and have giBw Bt iMKr iidA. As Wadi Sirhan is a pan of Syria and ia a grazing ground for our tribes who live in it in winter and spring and and leave it in summer,and there are no permanent inhabitants whose votes could be taken and as a plebiscite of the people of the Jauf and Sakaka alone would not include Wadi Sirhan and would no l settle the case. Besides Kharma and Tura'oa are in Hijaz territory and we can not discuss them and consequently we cannot agree to this suggestion. B. As Jauf and sakaka are in the country of Ibn Shavian while the Wadi is a part of Syria, we cannot agree to its diavision between the two Governments. C. lo prove that we want a settlement and peace and that we do not wish to put hamper the efforts of this Conference we will agree that Jauf,Srkaka and Wadi Sirhan be formed into an independant state recognised as such by both parties in accordance with one oi your suggestions on condition that the natural boundaries of Syria be observed,and our boundaries remain on the south as we have already claimed i.e. to starting from Madain Salih, the line runs east of Taimah leaving the tribes of Walad Sulaiman to us,and on to Jabal Raf, leaving Jauf and sakaka free ; then from Jabal Dhiyal north of Sakaka,and ends at Jaoal ’Anaizah. D. As the line of communication between ^gypt, Palestine,Trans Jordania and ’Iraq passes through the territory of Trans Jordania Wadi Sirhan,and as the Government of Trane Jordania is primarily responsible for those communications they should have the supervision of this line. E. We will agree to those terms on the condition that the principalities of the Rashid family and of the ' Aidh family in ’Asir be reestablished and that Najd evacuate a 1 Hijaz territory in the interests of peace in /rabia. The Najd Delegation refused this suggestion. The President then suggested that an independant Government be established in Wadi Sirhan,Jauf,Sakaka and haf and that the Trans Jordanian Government and N^jd agree to recognise it cjid undertake not to send troops or officialsinto it.reserving their tribes grazing rights in accordance — —■ ' with annient custom, their tribes to be exempt from paying tr o&lt;~ Z&amp;kfiM to the new Government,which alto should no en itled to A levy transit dues on the caravans of merchandise of either state passing through the territory .

President:- What do you Uajd beleg-tes say to this suggestion? ^ajd belt gates: •Jo will not atree to it. President: I suggest that we make a temporary boundary and form a neutral zone between the two states. This is of my own suggestion and not that of my Government.

Conaul, S H I H A Z. V'uh August If ili. I am sending you herewith * tranelfttion of extracts from 'The llajd Green Book', which Colonel prideaux asked me to do in his D.C # Ho•141»S of 4th May. I am sorry I have been such an appalling time over it, but it oame,juat after I got back from a trip to Basrah,wh^n I had a lot of arrears to work off, and I had no sooner got on to it than I got fever, and could not really t Okie it seriously till I got up here. Its object is to M prove w that at the Kuwait Conference in Najd did everything possible to come to an agree ment with the other Arab States, but that the attitude of the latter made it absolutely impossible to do so. Ignoring the fact (as h&amp;jd naturally does) that the Governments of ’Iraq and even Trans-Jordania are run on more or less modern lines while that of Najd is merely Ibn Sa’ud’s will # and that con* sequently real reciprocity was impossible, Najd has a very strong case, and I think if I had been a Najdi I could have written it up better. There is nothing very exciting in the book. It is aostlj merely extracts from the proceedings of the Conference, copieE of official correspondence (sometimes with portions omitted), etc. I have only translated such portions as we have not g&gt;t Japtain B e Stuart Horner, Secretary to the Political Resident, 3ushire 0so that you oan readily look up anything on your own files that you want to.

The object of the publication ia described as follows:- n W# hay» decided to publieh the dieoueeione which took place at the Kuwait Conference between the Repreeentatlree of Ifajd and of the &lt;3cyex*nni3nti of 'Iraq and Tram*Jordania, in which the ambition of Hijas came to light f •© that the Muslim World in general - and the Arabs in particular ~ nay Know how the obstinacy and pride of these people wrecked our best hope of an alliance and union for the benefit of the Arab race. Tea, the World will see what a sin thsy have committed against Arabia, and how their pride in themselrss and their refusal to consider their neighbours and friends .i've brought troubles and Taxations upon Arabia, which our brother Arabs are still suffering from everywhere.” 'The Public will realize that we claimed nothing at the Conference which was not our right, and that we refused only such things as were against eur honour and dignity and derogatory to our independence. We therefore lay before the leaders of Islam and our brother Arabs the discussions which r '° 0&amp; Plaoe between us, so that they can see and Judge for themselves who caused the split which did away with all hope of agreement. When they see what happened at the Conference, -.h© Public will realize that all the fervid announcements and declarations of these people are cloaked and embellished words.” The world will no doubt hold us excused for defending our rights and protecting our subjects to the utmost of our power. It was no wish of ours that the power of the Arabs should be dissipated by suoh quarrels, but thsss people think only of their own ambitions and care nothing about Muslimsand Arabs. We pray that God will lead them into the right m way, and show us what is best for the Arabs and for Xslaa. n Correspondence between the Government of Kajd and His Majesty's Government about oonvenlng the Conference.

As the Government of Trans-Jordan!a has had no polltlca existence until quite recently. It was not expsottd that thli nsv Stats would look for many things before the establlshaen of Its independence, or would be greedy or think of becoming great. Still, It Is a sad fact that from the time of itsPag® 34. 5 ’/) (7). % establishment this Ooyepnm.nt ha. been opp.ed to th. Hajd aovornment, and, instead of Joining with her In trying to save Arabia from the olaws of Strangers, has cultivated enmity against her; 'After the fall of Ibn Rashid's principality the Sul tanate of Hajd remained the only power to whom Jauf.SakSkah, the Salt Villages up to the WSdl ar-Rljll and all other places which had been under Ibn Rashid, o-uld rightly own allegiance'^ Tiie Shartfs of Mecca for some reason or other never try a Arabia from the paws of Strangers, and never do their best, except In perpetrating frauds to unite the principali ties of Arabia In a strong union - which at least might lighten the burden of foreign Interference - but their chief ala is to destroy the Sultanate of Hajd, which is the only land which no Foreign rule has yet polluted'.' The Government of Trane-Jordan!a took the opportunity of the withdrawal of a etrong garrlaon from the Salt Vllla^ea to send a loroe and oooupy thea 9 and when the Government of w/s/ieU IS free Ifajd these villages from their ooouplers # the Trane-* Jordanian Government appealed to the British Government, and they took a hand in the matter, and asked the Government of Hajd to stop the force from advancing and let the case be Page 35 . aettled by diplomacy, and the Government of Najd accordingly abetained from re-oooupying the Salt Villages. It is per fectly clear, however, from the statements and discussions which nave been heard at this Conference that the Government of Trails-Jordania does not want to oome to any underetaading or agreement^ The following is sons of the oorrespondenoe whieh has tmkm passer between the British Govemmsnt and the Sultanate of --'ijd i.,\ connection, which has not been published till &gt;1 now. / A telegram dated the 4th October »p22 from Sir Percy Cox, th.

V/e h .d thought that # w^en tho delegatee returned to the the?8 Conference after eeelng their Principal* # there wae a chance rf &lt;1^1 n*'tc of their reaching a final solution of our difficulties. But this hope presupposed good-will. .Iillf; the Conference was actually aaseafrled, however, the Government of 'Iraq continued to incite the criminal tribes oo attack Najd tribes and caravans, and after robbing and plundering them to z&amp;l! taka refuge in ’Iraq, although t) wiie Goverunent of Najd remained quiet ^nd patient in the hopes an Agreement ?ilh her neighbour •itaq, notwithstanding the tribes of Hajd began to t^lk about these misoreants of robbers and. how to bring them to Justice (See the letters t rom tne Sultan of Najd to the Briti ah C-overnment already published).' 'The Najd tribes began to keep the trade routes open ae w « their obvious duty. The ‘Iraq tribes Interfered with them, and in some oases fighting took place, in which ’Iraq suiiered some leases. The ‘Iraq Government seized on this as an excuse for breaking off negotiations and recalled their delegates from Basrah. Notwithstanding the faot that tho British Government looked on this as an ordinary case and saw no reason for breaking off negotiations, they would not listen to reason and insisted in doing so/ The 'Iraq Government have encouraged their tribesmen and also some criminals belonging to Najd tribes to attack numerous caravans and tribes who were peacefully settled in their grazing grounds. Incidents of this sort oven took place while the Conference raa using held. If however Najd nal refused to send her delegates, wnat would the Government of 'Irau. have done? Would not they have distressed the world with their ' Ad raftaria the HIJaa Oovamaent. They appointed Aalr5 4 Pas# 67 Pag# 6B, Zald as their representstive ot the Conference, and then apparently stipulated that we should send a member of the 5s.*3d Family, and when the Sultan did not send any of hie sons or family for the res boos already stated, the Kijaz Government rexused to send anyone to the Conference* * tt rT ,, xhe Government of Trans•• Jordan!a too never changed their original attitude of harshness and obstinacy ainl of interfering in matters which did not concern them, ub can be seen from the publication of the discussions.'

THE SECOND (t^th) 3E3D10N. “•.he Najd Delegation’s View. Ihe Government of Kajd does not wieh to rule anyone s-gainat lue will, as it is a Government built up on the will of the people under her away, and if ever the Government of Najd becomes aware of any hatred of the people towards her, aversion to liar, or unwillingness to remain under her rule, ahe will withdraw from the district whose inhabitants do not wish her to remain, and leave them the freedom of managing thoir wa f ffairs. Consequently, in accordance with this just principle, we will agree with the utmost alacrity to e plebiscite in W5dl Sarhan, on the condition that a pleblsoite be also held in the places under dispute between Hajd and Hi vii Turabah and Khurmah.^ 'The Trans-Jordanian Delegation, however, in view of thel, instructions and their too limited powers, had to refer to Amir ’Abdul'i*H and *a±&gt; Mm ^ r ^\- ■ ^ _(14).

'We have said what we think In the past - and It Is a xta view based on justloe snd equity. It seems that the Govern ment of Trans-Jordanla, which Is unwilling to speak about Hijas, is now talking In the name of all Arabs f and we are unaware who gave her this right. We do not merely refuse Trans-Jordtuiia's olaim, but we protect against this Inter ference which Is contrary to international right and legal custom, nnd we maintain that these demands are only put forward to complicate the efforts which are being put made in the way of peace.
