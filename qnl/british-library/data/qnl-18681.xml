F ort W illiam, F oreign D epartment, The 23rrf October 1852. The Most Noble the Governor General in Council has much satisfaction in publishing for general information, despatches received from Commodore Lambert and from Major General Godwin, which re port the capture and occupation of the City of Prome, after some resistance, and with comparatively trifling loss. The steam squadron and the boats of Her Majesty's ships, conveying the troops upon the Irrawaddy, anchored off Prome on the 9th of October. A fire from the shore was silenced by the fire of the steamers and of the boats. The troops having been landed, drove the enemy, some three or four thousand strong, from the suburbs; and on subsequently advancing to the great Pagoda and to the heights beyond, they found the position wholly abandoned by the Burnaan force. The Governor General in Council desires to express in the strongest terms his obligations to Commo dore Lambert for the care, the energy, and unwearied zeal which he has shown in directing the naval preparations for advance, and which have conduced so largely to the early and successful renewal of operations in the field. His Lordship in Council begs to offer his thanks to Captain Loch, and to Commander Shadwell, for their conduct of the Service^on the River; and to Commander Rice, for his direction of the body of seamen upon shore. His thanks are also due to Commander Campbell, of the Indian Navy, whose merit has been acknow ledged by the Commodore. The Governor General in Council has viewed with high approbation the services of the officers and men who, upon this occasion and for several months past, have been employed in boats upon the river, subjected to severe exposure, and engaged in harassing duties, which they have performed with the utmost alacrity and cheerfulness, and with conspicuous advantage to the public service. To the officers, seamen, and marines of Her Majesty's ships, of the Indian Navy, and of the Bengal Marine, who have been serving upon the Irrawaddy^and to Commander Tarleton, who long commanded them, the Governor General in Council is desirous of offering his hearty thanks. The Governor General in Council has in like manner to assure Major General Godwin of the satis faction with which he has viewed the skill and judgment by which the Major General enabled the troops to obtain possession of an important post, without delay, and with but little loss. To Major Mayhew, Deputy Adjutant General, to Major Allan, Deputy Quarter Master General, to Captain Smith, Interpreter, to Captain Burne, Military Secretary, and Captain Chads, A. D. C., the Go vernor General in Council tenders his thanks. Especially to Captain Christie and to Captain Welsh, of Her Majesty's 80th Regiment, for the gal lant .manner in which they led their men to the attack, and to all the officers, non-commissioned officers.ni * —S Ml h K I . ;M ■ ■ ;k &gt; I / ? f 2055 ] and soldiers of the force, the Governor General in Council desires to give assurance of his cordial appro bation. While thus congratulating the Naval and Military Forces on the first result of their advance, the Go vernor General in Council feels it to be due to the memory of an old and gallant Sailor that he should add a public expression of the deep regret with which he has received intimation of the death of His Ex cellency the Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Ships in the Indian Seas. Although Admiral Austen did not survive to witness the successful conclusion of the operations in which he had shared, the Governor General in Council desires to record his admiration of the staunch, high spirit, which, notwithstanding his age and previous suffering, had led the Rear Admiral to take his part in the trying service which has closed his career. His Excellency Rear Admiral Austen has afforded to the Government of India at all times a cordial and constant aid. 1 he Governor General in Council has been grateful for his services, and laments his death.

Her Majesty s Ship Fox's Boat, on Board the Fire Queen at Prome, the 11 th October 1852. Sin,— I request you may be pleased to inform the Most Noble the Governor General in Council, that having embarked on board the Hon'ble Company's Steam Vessels under my orders, H. M.'s 18th and 80tl) Regiments, the 35th Regiment Madras Native Infantry, a detachment of Sappers and Miners and of the Bengal Artillery with their Field Guns, I despatched them, as they were ready, to rendezvous off \ angernsiah, a town situated at the upper end ol the Panglang Creek, which joins the Irrawaddy to the Rangoon River. 2. The Commissariat, Ordnance, and Engineers'Stores, and about 1 ,000 followers attached to the Regiments, were conveyed in the Steamers, large Burmese Cargo-boats, five small Schooners, and a Barque. r I he Cargo-boats, manned by Burmese Crews, advanced in three divisions under convoy of the Barges and Pinnaces of Tier Majesty's Ships Fox, Winchester, and Hastings: the Barque and Schooners were towed by the Steamers. 3. These arrangements being completed, I left Rangoon on the 24th ultimo, and Major General Godwin joined me on the following dav at Yangernsiah. 4. Having hoisted my broad pendant on board the Fire Queen, the Steamer in which the Major General embarked, I weighed from Vangernsiah on September 27th with the Steam Squadron specified in Enclosure No. l,and proceeded up the frrawaddy to Prome, calling at Henzadah on my way. 5. On the morning of the 9th of October Prome was in si^ht, and on the Squadron nearing the city the enemy opened fire with a couple of guns and musketry, which was returned by the Steamers as we proceeded into the Bay, where I anchored in a convenient position abreast of the Town for landing the Troops. 6. The Enemy continuing to keep up a fire after we had anchored, I sent the boats of the Squadron, under the command of Captain Loch, C. B., of Her Majesty's Ship Winchester, to throw in a few shells and canister shot amongst them, which had the effect of silencing it for a time, although they kept up a very spirited fire on the boats, which wounded two Seamen. /. I hey then brought a gun down abreast of the Fire Queen, but had only time to give us one shot before it was dismounted by the fire from the Steamers, which effectually cleared a landing place. 8. Major General Godwin now expressed his wish to land the 80th Regiment and a party of Artillery with guns, at half-past 4, which was effected without any opposition, and the lower town cleared of the Enemy. 9. At daylight next morning the remainder of the Troops were landed, and a Brigade of 50 Seamen being formed under Commander Rice, at the Major General's request, to assist in working the guns, the Pagoda and other parts of the city were taken possession of, the Burmese flying as the Forces advanced. 10. Ihus the important City of Prome was occupied by British Troops with the trifling loss of one killed and three wounded on the part of the Army, while in the Squadron only four were wounded, which are named in Enclosure No. 2. 11. My thanks are due to Captain Loch, C. B., for the assistance he rendered me throusfhout these operations, also to Commanders Shadwell and Rice, of Her Majesty's Ships Sphinx and Hastings: the former tor his unremitting (ittention to the instructions I had sent him previously to my entering the Irrawaddy, and to the latter Officer for the part he tooJv when on shore with the Brigade of Seamen. Nor can I speak too highly ot Commander Campbell, the Officers and men of the Indian Navy and Bengal Marine. 1 he skill and perseverance displayed by the Officers and Men belonging to the boats appointed to convoy the cargo-boats from Rangoon to Prome, a distance of more than 200 miles, against a rapid stream, exposed occasionally to a fire from the Enemy, is deserving of my highest praise. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) GFORGE R. LAMBERT, Commodore 1st Class, Commander-in-Chief.[ 205(3 J ENCLOSURE No.-1 in COMiMODORE LAMBERT'S LETTER, dated 11 th OCTOBER 1852.

Sir, The Governor General in Council was aware of my intention, at the proper season, when the monsoon here had in some measure subsided, to break up the Army at Rangoon, and remove iU Head Quaiteis to Prome. . . • r i n I have now the honor to inform you that the 1st Division of this Force is in possession of that Uty. After some weeks of preparation, the embarkation commenced on the 16th of September, and the 1st Division, amounting to 2,300 men, and consisting of one Company of the Madras Foot Artillery with two 24 -pounder howitzers and four 9-pounder guns, H. M.'s 18th Royal Irish, H. M. s SUth Regiment, the 35th Regiment Madras N. I., and 119 Sappers, were all on board by the 'iSth idem. The Flotilla arrived off Prome on the morning of the 9th of October; each Ship was cannonaded from a projecting point on the Hills as it rounded to the City with very little effect. This fire was returned with much spirit by the Steamers. The weather here is so intensely hot that I disembarked the Artillery under Brigadier Foord, H. M.'s 80th Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Hutchinson, with the Sappers under Lieutenant Allen, on the evening of the same day, and by sunrise the next morning the 18th Royal Irish, under Lieutenant ( olonel Coote^and the 35th Madras N. I. under Lieutenant Colonel Apthorpe. The Enemv, consisting of three or four thousand men, occupied a very fine position on a range of hills about a thousand yards east from the point where they first opened fire, commanding the lown and the large Pagoda, which they also occupied. The Troops were landed in the evening, in a suburb to the north of and beyond the Town. 1 then ordered them to advance towards the position I had selected for the night, when, upon the head of the column approaching a dry nullah dividing the suburb from the Town, a very smart fire of musketry and jiujalls was simultaneously opened from some jungle and houses on our left, and a small Pagoda in our front. The Grenadiers of H. M.'s 80th Regiment, under Captain Christie, immediately advanced at the double towards the Pagoda, and a party, consisting of two Companies of the same Regiment under Captain Welsh, and accompanied by Brigadier Reignolds, were detached to the left, and in a very short time most gallantly drove the Enemy out of their position, with the loss of only one man killed and a few wounded. Captain Welsh's party bringing in a jinjall. The Grenadiers of the 80th Regiment kept possession of the Pagoda, which I made the right of my position, and the troops had excellent cover during the night, which was passed in perfect quietude. The following morning, when the remainder of the Troops were landed, 1 advanced through the Town in a directron I had determined upon the day before, from plans of the place in my possession, covered by the Flank Companies of the 18th Royal Irish and H. M.s HOth Kegnnents, and two ^4- nounder howitzers, which were drawn by a party of sailors under Commander luce, of H. M. S. Hastings. Upon our advanced guard reaching the Pagoda, it found that the enemy had a Mndonec that position, as well as the heights beyond it, leaving in our possession an entirely evacuated lown, overrun with thick and rank vegetation, and, I regret to add, abounding in swamps. It is evident that the enemy expected our force to land and advance up the direct road to the Pagoda, alontr which they had erected two or three small breast-works, as well as removing the planking ol seve ral wooden bridoes, leading to the Pagoda and the heights beyond it, but landing at the point we did, not only gave us an ^excellent road, but at the same time completely turned their position, rendering it impos sible for them to hold it. m r d I have been for a lony; time aware of the assemblage of a large force about ten miles east of I rome, and at which place they also had a very formidable force in the last war, which took Sir Archibald ( amp- bell several days to disperse. I have ascertained from very good autho'rity that they have now about 18,000 men well posted in two or more stockades. It is not my intention to disturb them at present in any way, as by their concentration at that place the fine force now assembling here will have an opportunity of striking a blow which may put an end to much future opposition. It was on this Burmese Army that the enemy retreated from Prome, upon our entering it. The bravery and alacrity of the Troops on this occasion was as conspicuous as it ever is. His Lordship's thanks are deserved by Captain Christie, of H. M.'s 80th Regiment, for the gallant manner in which he led his Company to the attack and capture of the small Pagoda m our front, and to Captain Welsh, who, with two Companies of his Regiment, drove the Enemy out of their position on our left. * . _ The General Staff,—Major Mayhew, Deputy Adjutant General; Major Allan, Deputy Quarter Mas ter General ; Captain Smith, Interpreter to the Force ; as also my personal Staff, Captain Burne, Military Secretary, and Lieutenant Chads, Aide-de-Camp, were active in rendering me every assistance. Brigadier General Sir John Cheape, commanding the Bengal Division, came up to Prome with t e Sportion of his Division, embarked, and was present throughout the whole of these operations, and have great satisfaction in being enabled to leave him in command upon my return to Rangoon, where am required, and for which place I shall leave this to-morrow.[ 2058 ] I leave Major Fraser, of the Engineers, and Major Allan, Deputy Quarter Master General, at Prome, to carry out the necessary arrangements for the reception of the Regiments which will hereafter arrive. To Commodore Lambert your Lordship is deeply indebted for the unremitting exertions, calling forth all possible resources, and anxious solicitude which have accomplished the conveyance of the Force to its destination up this noble, but most difficult to be navigated, river. To Commander Rice, for the exertions of himself and men under his command, I feel greatly indebted. 1 have the honor to enclose a Return of the Casualties which have occurred during our operations before Prome, and to remain.
