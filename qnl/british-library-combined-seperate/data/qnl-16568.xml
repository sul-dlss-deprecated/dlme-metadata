MacLeod explains that he has learned details of the state of the tomb from Captain Martin of the Bengal Establishment, who is in Bushere [Bushire] en route to India. Some sources told Martin that it had been damaged by the weather, while another says that it was destroyed deliberately and that Hossein Ali Meerza [Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mīrzā] was heard publicly expressing his disapproval of the nature of the monument. Another, unnamed, source explained to MacLeod that the tomb was constructed to withstand the weather and that, soon after its construction, the garden in which it stands had been closed to Europeans. He states that he has reported the occurrence to Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000013#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
