To The Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahia in. Memorandum Reference your memorandum No. 69l of Sth September 1936 to the Political Agent. The requirements of the A*lan to which you refer do not seem to h^ve been strictly carried out. We have no register of licensed medical practitioners in this Agency. It is, in any case, a fairly old A*lan, and might, I think, well be re-published. In view of the changes that hs^e taken place since the original publication of the A*lari in 1347 it might possibly be better to © dopt the principle on which we now work in most other matters, and make medical prac titioners who are Bahrain subjects register with the Bahrain Government, c nd those who are foreign subjects with the Political Agent. 2. I should, however, prefer to refer the matter to the Political Agent on his return, as it is not of great urgency. received a visit from a (Mr. Bhatt, a British Indian Subject, whom I sent to the Quarantine Medical Officer for invest igation of his qualifications* He appears to be adeouately qualified as he is a specialist in ophthalmic troubles of which there are plenty in Bahrain, I propose to give him a ’No Objection Certificate 1 and license him to practice //!

His Majesty's Vica-Consul, KhoiTamshahi* • I have the honour to inform you that on September 23rd 1936, '» certain Mr. J.N. Bhatt, bearin/? a letter of introduction from you, was interviewed by the Assistant Political Agent, and stated that it was his wish to practice as an opthalraologiet in Bahrain. Although there is no difficulty about the grant of a visa, since he is a British subject, t:ere is a rule in Bahrain that foreign doctors must be licensed by the Political Agent before practising in Bahrain. I should be grateful if you would inform him that if he proposes to follow up his idea of practising in Bahrain, he must, before coming, send us the certificates of his medical qualifications for inspection. 4. Would you also very kindly give me your opinion of him (a) as a doctor and opthalnclegist and (b) as an individual^ I have the honour to be.

Khorramshahr his opinion of the man (a) as a doctor and opthalmatist and,(b) as an individual. We should ask for proof before he returns to Bahrain of his having done a post-graduate course at Vienna - I presume that Nr. Hynes is satisfied that his Licentiate certificate of the Bombay University is genuine ? But it might be well to confirm from the Bombay University that Mr. Bhatt is really a licentiate (initials can be got f from the Passport reports). • Then we should ask the Bah ain Government if they have any objection.41 CONFIDENTIAL No b.

Sir, A With reference to your letter No. 2814-2/16, dated the 12th November 1936, I have the honour to inform you that Dr* J.N* Bhatt officiated as Medical Officer in l charge of the staff of this Vice-Consulate during the absence of the permanent incumbent for four months last summer. As a medical officer, I found him most unsatisfactory, lazy^ or ignorant of the simplest require ments of a medical officer. In extenuation, he invariably pleaded that he was an eye-specialist and knew only the barest rudiments of medicine. I knew nothing of his qualifications as an eye-specialist. 2. Up till now I have heard nothing against Dr. Bhatt as an individual. My Acting Head Clerk, however, has just told me that he has a reputation for issuing 'stumer' cheques. I have no proof of this allegation as he has not been charged with this offence in the Iranian Courts, to the best of my knowledge. I pass on the information, however, for what it is worth.

Khera was refused permission to open a private medical practice in Bahrain only four months ago by the Political Agent after consultation v/ith yourself. I still consider it unwise to allow private practitioners to start new practices here, particularly at the present moment when considerable expansion of the State Medical Services is under contemplation. It would in any case be essential, in my opinion, to insti tute most rigorous enquiries in India in regard to the qualifications and reputation of the applicant before considering the grant of permission to him to practise in Bahrain. 1 Political Ag nt, Bahrain.£L ■■I . ♦ A n, 9th January 1938 .gent ; o:Lr » With due respects I beg to approach with the following request,that I submitted an application about six months back, in connection with permission to start private practice in Bahrein but I was informed (that there is at present in—sufficient scope for further medical work), and was asked that I should be sent to oi-L-kiJAH in service and was kept waiting for about two months against my will by your predecessor and Dr.Sir Ralph Holmes. 1 think the later gentleman might hc.ve talked to you in person in this connection too. Failing to get a satisfactory reply in connection with post at SHARJnH 1 approached the authorities to allow me permission to start practice in Bahrein at present. As for my Qualifications I passed the final l.S.M.F.medical examination from the British Government Medical Institution Punjab conducted by the British authorities. As for my practical experience I Practiced in Medicine and Surgery at Mianwali for about 3 years(Punjab) I also worked as a medical officer at Harnauli dispensary(punjab).

The place is ecnomically improving'day by day, so many other business - Men are being allowed to come from India and settle down here. They are all doing very well here but the ho. of medical practioner is still the same, there is no doubt that persons holding ^bsolutelyn a . qualifications whatsoever in the alopethic system of medicine*,nut are still practising in the same Where as I hold the BritishQualifications and any-where, where there are hospitals only qualified doctors are allowed to settle, and un-qualified persons dis“'allowed, but here the case is&lt;saMa^ reverse,which is very strange.la # qualified doctor not being allowed so far to start practice, although I can earn my iixxix livelihood better than those who are al-ready settled here. Lastly I may point out ^ you that my application was for warded with the remarks, recomrrfded that doctor ij.O.Khgra be permitted to practice in Bahrein, by doctor sir Ralph Holmes , q uarantine medical officer Bahrein , and 1 think that you might have come across this application' surely, but I am at a loss to under-stand why a porperly qualified and experienced doctor waiting since long is not so far being allowed to settle for practice, al-though there is sufficient field for practice, and at the same time Bahrein Government does not stand at any loss, moreover the medical aid to the Bahrein Government would be very cheap. I once again request you to please consider my case and I am sure that I am justified to be granted permission, as I have heard that you are a very wise and a kind officer, at the same time a real protectorate of the Indians interest.

Yours faithfully,1 I most humbly and respectful.!y beg to' invite y ur kind attention towards the following facts and ti*ust that the same will receive your kind and favourable consideration:- I belong to the fighting clans of the Punjab Province who have rendered valuable and meritorious services whenever an occasion for the same arose. During-the last Great more than half a dozen members from my family,fought for the Gov rnment as combatant officers procured the Govt.with about 800 combat nt recruits and liberally contributed towards the iiar loan and charities organised by the Government. 1 my self ,along with my nephew Dr.Arjan oingh,were also on the active list and served with section ' B ft firing lines in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. During the period of our service, %/ *»■ had the opportunity to serve hundred of gun-shot wounded oases, both Indians and .ungliah-men,and I was finally peisanai.tly disabled. I did not get much from the Grovemnien/f’ beyond a large number of commendation certificates,and my well-eurnea pension which is scanty to meet the needs of my large family . During my such a long stay away f rom home, the education of my children suffered considerably and the bank, in which I had kept my money,failed and this resulted practi- cally in a disaster. Being hard-pressed by circumstunces, I take this opportunity to approach your goodself for help. 1 had very high aspirations and always thought that my son Dr. Balwant oingh will hold king's Commission in the Army but all my hopes were thus frustrated. The old officers under whom I served have all retired and I look upon your goodself to kinaly consider my claims and help me in getting a job to my son Dr.Balwant oingh who has recently qualified himself forthe licbiitiateship hx : ;iaination of the Punjab otate L Faculty in Medicine and surgery (L.M.J) and is a registered medical practitioner. He is educated upto B.3o.standard of the Punjab University and knows short-hand and type writing. Apart from this, he has obtained additional qualifications in Pood Chemistry and the danitury work.He is a youngimn of 27 &gt; very keen and desirous to serve over seas. It he is given a chance in Government service,or anywhere in that part of the countiy, he will be unite wi ll i ng.to travel at hjs own expenses . After all, it is that part of the country where I and so many others from say family once fought for the Government and now that there is an opening th re,I very much expect that your goods elf will be inclined to find out a suitable job for my son Dr.Buiwant Singh who is fully qualified to ho,id the charge of a local hospital or work ^Jf.,P,o^ -u Eft y 11 st or a o anitary Chemist .

Doctor Balooch carae to Bahrain and was given by the Bahrain Government permission to practice as a doctor at a time when there were very few Indian doctors in the State. Since then several Indian M.B* B.S.s and sub-assistant surgeons have arrived and the standard of medicine generally has been considerably raised. B. In India the medical authorities are, I under stand, aiming at the elimination of the sub-assistant surgeon grade of medicos. Bahrain does not aspire/at present, to a higher degree of medical efficiency than India but at the same time it is desirable that we^ should do what is possible to improve local conditions and I should like to obtain your views upon the desirabi lity of forbidding any doctors to practice in Bahrain who have not passed a standard which is at least equi valent to the sub-assistant surgeon grade which is a grade that Doctor Balooch has not reached.

The Bahrein Government Proclama tion referred to in your letter states ”we hereby notify that with effect from thedate of this proclamation no doctor will be allowed to practise medicine in Bahrein unless he has passed a standard at least equivalent to that of Sub Assistant Surgeon” which means that medical practitioners who do not come into the authorized category will not be granted licenses to practise medicine as of the date of the proclamation. A medical practitioner who has been in practice for a period of over fourteen years with Government per mission, as in my case, cannot be legally prohibited from his practice without any legal reason, nor does the proclama tion state?anything to this effect. I further beg to state that according to Indian medical regulations, even a dispenser is considered a quali fied practitioner after practising medicine for a consecutive period of 1© years while I am the holder of a Diploma from one of India’s well-known medical colleges and have been in actual and continuous practice here since 1932 - a period of over 14 years. In view of these fa ctsl./shall greatly appreciate your reconsidering my ca^e^^intfie meantime, I beg leave to continue with my practice as, apart from the loss involved, I have several cases under my care at the present time and stopping my practice all at once would greatly damage my reputation. &lt;9^ 7 ov deA- ^ (d***-o{ 'u/i Respectfully submitted, fl.G.M.

Reference your Endorsement No.3256-13/21 dated ^ the 12th October, 1946. v/ 2. Mr. H.G.M. Balooch first came to Bahrain in 1932. He applied for permission to practise in medicine, and afte? consultation with the Bahrain Government his request was granted by this Agency. Mr. Balooeh at that time was nullified practitioner in Unani medicines possessing a diploma known as the 'Fazil-i-Tib-o-jarahau . 3. In 1932 there were very few doctors in Bahrain and encouragement was given to persons with any medi oualification to come and set up practa.ce. Mr. Balooch has been practising here since 1932, first in Unani medi cines, but later in Allopathy in which he is in n ° qualified. He has gradually increased the range of his^ practice over a period of years to an extent f .. of his qualifications, sometimes with unfortunate results. In this^connection I would bring the following two cases to your notice: (a) In November, 1941, Mr. Balooch administered an excessive dose of Neo-Salvarsan to Mr. Nasir-ul-Haq, then 2nd clerk of this Agency, as a result of which the patient suffered from Arsenical Dermatitis and ^as admitted into the American Mission Hospital dangerously ill. Mr. Nasir-ul-Haq eventually recovered sufficiently to leave hospital, but had subsequently to be granted nine months leave for further medical treatment to complete his cure. (b) in April, 1946, Mr. M-Y- Siddiqi, a clerk of this Agency who was under the treatment of Mr. H.G.M. Balooch, suffered from Arsenal Dermatitis following the administration of Neo-Salvarsan by injections. He was admitted in a dangerously ill condition to the American Mission Hospital and died there soon afterwards. As a result of this case Mr. Balooch was pro secuted by the police in the Court of the Assistant Political Agent and First Class ^magis trate. There was no doubt that Mr. Balooch had been guilty of a bad error of judgement if not of criminal negligence, but there was, unfortu nately, insufficient direct evidence to obtain his conviction on a criminal charge. a Bubseauently the Adviser suggested to me that since more qualified doctors had come to Bahrain in recent years, and the standard of medicine had been generally raised, /steps- 2 - A steps should now be taken to safeguard the public against the ministrations of persons, such as Mr. Balooch, who were not adequately qualified. I informed the Adviser that I agreed with his suggestion, and accordingly Notice No.40/1365 dated the 6th August, 1946, (copy enclosed), was issued by the Bahrain Govern ment. 5. On the 22nd August, 1946, the Adviser reported to me that Mr. H.G.M. Balooch was continuing to practise in contravention of this order of August 6th. Mr. Balooch was therefore officially informed by me, vide my letter No.2812-2/16 of the 27th August, 1946 (copy enclosed), that the permission granted‘to him by this Agency in 1932 to practise in medicine was cancelled and that he must cease to practise forthwith. 6 . Subsequent applications from Mr. Balooch to be allowed to continue his practice were refused by me, and he was informed that he should dispose of his medi cines to other doctors or to the Bahrain Government Hos pital, whichever he preferred. 7. I am of the opinion, as is also the Adviser, that Mr. Balooch should most certainly not be allowed to practise any more in Bahrain, and I consider that his departure from the island as soon as possible is highly desirable. The enclosure received with your endorsement is returned herewith. n ^ Political Agent, Bahrain. N,n tlo, v 5b 1 - 13/21, \b PLKSIArJ GULF RUSIUaNCY, BAHRaIN• the 26th November, 1946.
