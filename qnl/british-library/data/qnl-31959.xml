I am afraid we have no spare copies of (a) The Gazeteer of the Persian Gulf or (b) your reports as Resident of the Persian Gulf* but there would be no objection to your consulting here the single copies in our possession. These documents are, however, still regarded as being confidential - as recently as 19^6 the Government of India asked that Lorimer should remain classified as 'secret^ - and in the circumstances access tc them can only be granted under our usual conditions that, if use is made of them f the manuscript of the book must first be submitted to us for approval prior to publication. Lb regards your Consular Reports (1906) it is assumed that you have in mind those which were published at the time. In this event I think there would be no difficulty in sending you copies.

Sir Lionel is writing a book on the Persian Gulf and said that those waoers contained information .hich was not available el^e— ago. Our files show that in 1946 Loriiaer^s Gasetteer was, at the request of the Government of India, still treated as secret although we allowed such institutions as the Royal Geographical Society to retain copies provided that they were kept in safe custody and made available only to authorised persons. I am not sure to what extent the reports mentioned at (b) and (o) nxust still be regarded as confidential. As the Persian Gulf is now a Foreign Office concern, you may like to get in touch with Sir Lionel Haworth direct ;ibout this. /It may Foreign Office Library, H.

Misc. 76 A9 Lt.-Gol. Sir Lionel Haworth, of Osborne House,^ Stejming, formerly Resident at the Persian Gulf, visited the Library recently to enquire whether ‘Gazeteer of the Persian Gulf*, by J. G. Lorimer, also at one time Persian Gulf Resident, was still treated as confidential. It was printed about 30 years a^o, ’ resumably by the Government of India. Sir Lionel is writing a book on the Gulf, and wishes to make use of information contained in Lorimer's report, information to be found in no other work, and not of a confidential nature. In fact. Sir Lionel said that he thought that there was nothing in Lorimer that could reasonably be regarded as confidential today. I should be grateful for your observations. Sir Lionel wishes if possible to borrow a copy from the Library. We have no copy. If therefore it is decided that the book is available for general use, have you a spare copy which can be placed in the Library? £ /(‘trrr* fruj He also wishes/a copy of his own Consular 'erorts as Resident of Kermanshah (iboG) and of the Persian ! ulf (two reports, 1927-29)* Have you by chance sn^re copies of these for transfer to the Library? 11/7 A 9i Political Registry I have spoken to Miss Platt of the Records Department about this and she tells me that you have papers about Lorime^s Gazeteer. V«'ould you please register this on a r&amp;w file and put up with it the papers about Lorimer* s G-azeteer and, if you have them, the Consular Reports mentioned in the last paragraph of Mr# Sutton's minute#if Miss Bnery I spoke to a Miss Shepherd in the Foreign Office Library and she thought that the Foreign Office would probably agree to handle this question. I told her I would send her the information as in my draft, which I submit. z. You will see that before the transfer of power, at any rate, we still regarded the Gazetteer as a secret document.
