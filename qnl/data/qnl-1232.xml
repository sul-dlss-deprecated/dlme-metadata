The tour included a week-long trip to London in May, where Emir Faisal [Fayá¹£al] met King George V, and representatives of the Kingdom of Hejaz-Najd met with British officials from the Foreign Office. The main subject of the discussions between officials of both countries was a request from the Kingdom of Hejaz-Najd for financial assistance (in the form of loans) from the British Government. The request was turned down by British officials, in light of the existing economic circumstances (folio 18-23). The volume contains numerous reports from a variety of British officials at the Foreign Office in London, the Political Agency in Bahrain, and British embassies based in countries which Faisal visited, giving details of the Emir's movements and appointments, which took him to Rome, Geneva, Paris, London, The Hague, Berlin, Constantinople, and Tehran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023f#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
