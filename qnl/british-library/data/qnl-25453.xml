In deference to his Lordship*s wishes for an immediate payment on account My Lords agreed that an instalment should be paid on receipt of an undertaking from the King to carry out the three conditions, as set out in your telegram F.46 of the 20th August last. It/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign OfficeIt appears from Sir J. Tilley^ letter of the 7th instant (E 10883/9/44) that the two other conditions have been fulfilled, hut that the Treaty has not been signed, and that no undertaking has been given to sign it. In view of the very clear exposition of the conditions set out in Telegram 746 of 20th August, My Lords do not understand the statement in the second paragraph of the letter under reply that the signing of the Treaty was not included in the original conditions. Nor can They reconcile Lord Curzon’s objections to a “bargain” in the third paragraph of the letter, as regards the first moiety of the payment, with his proposal, in the last paragraph, that there should be a definite bargain as regards the last moiety. My Lords recognise, however, that Colonel Marshall, who was no doubt fully seized of Lord Curzon’s views, did not, in his discretion, insist on signature, or an undertaking to sign by the King; and to some extent His Majesty*s Government are committed by his action. The only object of My Lords is to see that the money is not spent without result, and to prevent further calls on the Exchequer. In these circumstances. They would suggest that the best way of impressing the purpose of His Majesty's Government on King Hussein and of meeting Lord Curzon's wishes, would be to limit the first instalment of the payment to £10,000 the draft telegram sent with Sir J. Tilley’s letter of/of the 7th instant being amended accordingly. If His Lordship thinks fit, it might be indicated further that a further £10,000 would be paid on receipt of a definite undertaking to sign, and the remainder on signature.

My Lords observe that it is not stated that the King has yet given any undertaking to sign the Treaty of Peace with 'Turkey although this was understood to be, in the view of His Majesty T s Government, the most important of the three conditions imposed. In these circumstances I am to reguest you to inform Earl Curzon of Hedies ton that My Lords consider that the draft telegram should be amended to ensure that the first instalment of £15,000 shall only be paid on receipt of an undertaking from the Hing to sign the Treaty, the remaining £15,000 to be paid as soon as the Treaty is actually signed.

Sir, I am directed by Earl Curzon of Zedleaton to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. S.540 of the 10th. instant, stating that the Lords Commissioners of Hia Majesty T s Treasury consider that the first half of the proposed payment to Zing Hussein should only be made on his undertaking to sign the Turkish Treaty. Lord Curzon ventures to hope that Their Lordships will not insist on this condition. Zing Hussein has actually completed part of the bargain or, at any rate, part of our requirements have been satisfied and it would place His Majesty’s Government in a very unfavourable light if they refused to make any payment until the further requisite namely the signing of the Treaty, which was not included in the original conditions, is also satisfied. Even apart from this Lord Curzon is anxious not to give to his endeavours to persuade Zing Hussein to sign the Treaty, too much the appearance of a deliberate bargain between him and His Majesty’s Government. In his previous instructions His Lordship left to Colonel Marshall’s discretion the best means of achieving the desired/ The Secretary. to the Treasury.« ' desired results either by bargain or indirect agreement, although he was doubtful about including in the actual bargain the condition as to signature of the Treaty. The present proposal of the Treasury, however, would go even further to make it a case of deliberately purchasing the Zing’s signature, which is certainly undesirable politically. There is also the consideration that Zing Hussein has undoubtedly been placed in a very difficult position by the withholding of the subsidy on which he counted for carrying on his ordinary administration during the past months. Lord Curzon would therefore strongly urge that £15,000. fifteen thousand pounds should be paid to Zing Hussein, on condition only that it will be spent in the Hedjaz, and the £15,000. remaining fifteen thousand when the Turkish Treaty is signed.

It was therefore agreed between the two parties that all hoatile movements and aggressions will be stopped on both sides and also all movements welch might cause uneasiness or failure of the measures taken to renew good relations immediate ly or in future. Therefore Emir Ahned Ibn Thunyan referred to above has promised in the name of His Excel lency Imam Abdelaziz Ibn Saud, Ruler of Nejd, to stop all aggression on the part of the Nejd forces against Hashemite territories and to suppress all oper ations attributed to the tribes, whether openly or secretly. The Hashemite Committee composed of Emir Ali as president, Emir Aodul- lah, Sheikh Abdullah Seraj Acting Premier and Grand Qodi, and Ihur Shaker Ibn Zei d Ibn Fawaz, have also undertaken to do the same on behalf of His Hashemite Majesty.

The view of this Office is that there can be no objection to the Treasury using Mesopotamian Surplus Revenues for accounting purposes provided that credit for sums paid be allowed to Mesopotamia.

King Hussein now refuses to give any guarantees as to meeting Bin Baud, keeping peace or (group uncle cypher able) is to purchase supplies. He complains that it would be beneath his dignity to give such undertakings in return (? for omitted) £30,000 which is 'only a part of subsidy already overdue', subsidy he says is payable without restrictions and adds that rather than accept conditions he vail abdicate. I nave not yet given him information contained in Baghdad telegrams 90, 27 and 28 as confirmation has not yet been received. In view of large Indian attendance including 1,000 Indian soldiers it is important to His Majesty’s Government that Hajj should pass peacefully, if the King cannot pay his followers they will cause trouble on the routes. He has informed me that his troops at Medina2, Medina threw down their arms because their pay was three months overdue. On the other hand reports from Mecca indicate that the King is sending troops and munitions of war from Hedjaz to the North, It will be difficult to ensure that cur money is not similarly employed. However compared with subsidy he has received £30,000 is unlihely to leave him much margin to use for non local purposes. Jeddah inform us that he is already making forced loans in the towns. Provided Nejd pilgrimage is definitely cancelled I recommend that full amount be paid over with intimation that as Bin Baud is not proceeding King's acceptance of conditions is no longer necessary but that His Majesty’s Government expects him to use money for purely local needs end not for anti- French purposes in the North* Also that he is expected to receive Nejd deputation. Ho knows that £30,000 is now available at Jeddah and if you direct that less is to be paid he should I think be notified at the same time that his subsidy has do on rbouceo. oi stopped, as case may be, but 1 am not in favour of (? deprivation), stoppage or reduction except if made for punitive purposes.

After Compliments, I have the honour to acknowledge your cordial letter dated 20th Shaaban 1338 (10th May 1920) in which was contained the telegraphic consmunication received from His Majesty f s GDvernment through the Hon’hie the Civil Commis- ^ eioner, Baghdad t I was very glad to peruse it and to note the contents regarding the proposed settlement of questions outstanding between the Hejaz Government and my Government. I feel deeply grateful to Kis Majesty’s Government for their endeavours and I shall gladly accept their invitation after the Haj season: But: Firstly . I would reqmst His Majesty’s Government kindly to depute the Hon’ble Sir Percy Cox or Colonel Wilson (to be present at Aden) because these high officials are the only ones who possess first-hand knowledge of my affairs from the early days when treaty was concluded between His Majesty Government and myself up to the present day. I regard it as most essential that one of these two high officials be pre sent and that he shouid be accompanied by the respected Major Dickson, Political Agent, Bahrain, whose presence I consider necessary and proper ovdng to the fact that he has during the time he has been our Political Officer* Secondl y. It should be clearly understood that I do not sioner, Baghdad. 1920, I beg to forward traT^lation of Bin Baud’s letter agreefind the Sharif Husain himself present there* To this and I request a guarantee from Hie Majesty’s Government as I have absolutely no intention of holding parley with any body in his place. Thirdly * I undertake to His Majesty’s Government that I shall maintain the present truce for any period that His Majesty’s Government may desire. The meeting will, I tnust, take place on board one of H.M’s Ships in the aforesaid harbour (Aden). As regards opening of the Haj-route for ITejd pilgrims, I give to H.M’s Government the required under taking. possessing high qualifications who shall be in charge of the Hejd pilgrims and control of their affairs and thereby ensure that no untoward events occur during their journey to and from the Holy City. to appoint two responsible and well-qualified Indian Muslim officers one to accompany our Hejd pilgrims, and the other submit to Government their reports on all they witness. function which God Himself has ordained and protected by the following command in the Holy Quran 'There shall not be any carnal pleasure, nor dispute nor tresspass during the Haj'. The observance of peace and quiet is thus our strict religious duty, which, if neglected, puts us out of our cherished religion. Notwithstanding^ these facts, in compliance with the wishes of H.M’s Government, I hereby guarantee and undertake under my seal for the good behavi our of my subjects (pilgrims) during their visit to the Holy City of Mecca and back. In return, I request H.M’s Government to give me a written assurance on behalf of &amp; Sharif Husain and his subjects, that no trouble be caused I shall appoint efficient and responsible persons At the same time I would request H.M’s Government to be stationed at Holy Mecca so that both of then may I may add that the pilgrin Is a purely religious- 3 - .

As regards the Civil Commissioner’s remarks about my subsidy, that subsidy is a minor thing in comparison to the importance of Government’s approbation. My highest object is to achieve their satisfaction and to ensure mutual advantages. I hope you will kindly convey this to the Hon’ble Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, with my best respects, and request aa early reply.

Translation of a private and confidential letter dated 3rd Ramadhan 1338 (22nd May 1920) from Bin Saud, Ruler of Nejd, to Major H,R,P,Dickson. Political Agent, Bahrain, After compliments, I received your cordial letter dated the 20th Shaaban 1338 (10th May 1920) and fully understood the contents, especially the friendship, sincerity and good wishes you so kindly expressed therein, a^ialso your promises in all matters concerning the achievement of success in my objects, concerning which I have not the least doubt* I know that all this is a good proof of your good- naturedness and good intentions, and insha-allah you Y/ill peruse my answer which I have written to the Hon*ble Colonel Wilson in reply to the telegraphic message which I had the honour to receive, forwarded in your cordial letter. As you are aware, I have no other object, except to have peace in my dominions in Nejd, and the neighbouring places, and to have good relations, and acquire the approbation of my friends the High British Government, I beg to offer my best thanks to your honour and to that I consider the settlement of the question as well thought out, in spite of the fact that my subjects dislike me absenting myself from home, in consideration of my position: This is a arniall matter however. I have accepted His Majesty’s Government’s invitation as I have stated above, only in order to please and gain the approbation of my friiends the High British Government, I compliments). would- 2 - would request you kindly to forward the same to the afore. said hon’ble gentleman (Civil Commissioner) as soon as Possible. I hope, you will continue your kind regard towards your friend. This is what had to be said and may you be preserved. P«S. I further request His Majesty^ Government to consider the question of supplies. It is not hidden from your Honour that the distance from Nejd to Mecca is great and Hejd (pilgrims) cannot carry with them a sufficient quan- tiof foodstuffs to meet their needs for the journey to as well as from Holy Mecca. I pray therefore that Govern ment kindly arrange all facilities necessary and appoint merchants(in Mecca) to seil whatever foodstuffs the pilgrims may require for their return home. This is without doubt one of the most important points requiring consideration and forethought. Probably the Sharif will prohibit tfejd pil grims from procuring st&amp;res and other requirements if only in order to harm them. I therefore, wish that these arran gements take place through His Majesty*s Government.Copy of a Memorandum No* 158-C dated 7tla June 1920, from Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad* (copy to D*P.R., Bushire).

Letter dated 3rd Ramadhan 1338 (23rd May 1920) from Bin Saud, Ruler of Nejd to the Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments, I have just written to you to say that in reply to the telegraphic coteunication of His Majesty’s Government which I had the honour to receive through the Hon’hie the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, I accepted their invitation to meet the Sharif Husain as I am anxious to An conform to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. I now beg to inform your honour that I would like to avail myself of the coming occasion to perform the Hajj (pilgrimage) myself. So, if jomc I can (be allowed to) proceed thither, I should like to meet with the Sharif Husain outside Holy Mecca (at the head of my subjects) or I might send (my subjects) the intending pilgrims ahead of me and hold the meeting before the Hajj jfcn the village As-Sail or at some other spot (in Hejaz). To this end I am prepared to give (or hereby give) full guarantee under my seal and signa ture that nothing calculated to cause p breach of the peace shall take place, nor shall anything be allowed to take place to interfere with the status quo or Govern ment’s wishes. The object of this my request is chiefly to be able to perform my religious duty (the Hajj) and secondly to secure an amicable settlement of outstanding questions. I therefore, request you to communicate the above to the proper quarters and ask for a very early reply. Usual ending.Ho.

Althoi^h* Hussein*s attitude may be partly attributed to disinclination to take our advice, be is undoubtedly frightened both of Nejdis and of his own Bedouins over whom he has little control. In view of bitter feeling between the two parties I think he has every reason to be nervous. Chances of peaceful pilgrimage depend to a consider able degree on his ability to buy off tribes and he canno do this unless he receives his subsidy. He has just telegraphed to me that his financial situation is most serious and asked for immediate advance of £30,000. I consider subsidy should be granted but that it should be made conditional on his undertaking to fulfil guarantees demanded in your telegram No. 410 and to allow pilgrims to buy foodstuffs for return journey. I understand there is a precedent for pilgrims from Nejd leaving their arms at Taif during pilgrimage and I think that this suggestion might be made to Bin Baud. It would lessen chances of trouble at Arafat* Native Arab opinion appears unanimous in thinking Bin Baud and King will not compose their differences unless( 2 ) unless a high British official is present at their meeting* Both principals have asked for this and in view of their acute mutual antipathy it would he hotter if (? Bin Sand) came immediately after pilgrimage and (? met) King (? at) Taif under British auspices* If pilgrimage had (? in the meantime) passed off successfully it would he taken as a good augury for a settlement. I am not making any communication to King until I have heard from you regarding subsidy* It is important King should know as soon as possible number of Nejd pilgrims and date of arrive! of them and Bin Gaud* (15.7 8/4)[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] T AWAY WITH ''i ,1 ) \c K5.

Hussein and Lbn Saud) . It appears to us that the object of our intervention has been very nearly achieved and we no7/ propose to assume that the meeting between the two rulers will take place at Mecca as suggested. The•condition that the hejd pilgrims should come by sea can we think be ignored. The message in my immediately following telegram has accordingly been sent to Ibn Saud and you should communicate it without delay to King Hussein and inform him that His Majesty’s Government are much gratified to learn that he has agreed to meet Ibn Saud at Mecca. He will see that they hold Ibn Saud responsible for carrying out his undertaking that no disturbances will be caused by the Hejd pilgrims and that they have impressed upon him the necessity for reducing the number of pilgrims-and of armed men to the lowest possible limit. You should also point out to him that Ibn Baud’s consent to visit him in his own territory is a very marked concession and that this modification in his previous attitude is due entirely to the good offices of His Majesty’s Government. They are confident that Ibn Saud realises the necessity for remaining on good terms with His Majesty’s Government and that he will do his utmost to make the pilgrimage pass off successfully and peacefully. They rely upon King Hussein to do the same andurge strongly upon him that any concentration of aimed forces in the neighbourhood of the route which will he followed by the Uejd pilgrims is likely to result in disturbances. They are deputing a responsible Indian Moslem officer to accompany the llejd pilgrims as requested by Ibn Saud and they would be glad to know that King Hussein agrees to their assisting him to arrange for the Hejd pilgrims to have every facility for purchasing supplies at Mecca for the return journey.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] j 0^1 EGYFr.

I am quite well now* I once more desire to represent to your Honour in the matter of the Sharif that for the last three years I have been communicating with the High Government about him, and have been keeping in check the inhabitants of Najd, not withstanding all that has happened through his evil acts in the past and recently. Of all these acts I Informed your Honour and you made me a solemn promise to stop him. Having become helpless by his inability to do mischief in all external movements he has become like Satan who excites e others. May his evil movements turn on to his own head* one •more certain hostile movements have been committed by him; he has sent one of the Asharaf accompanied by another indi vidual of ’Asir armed with money to stir up evil movements from Ghamid up to ’Asir; these take the form of blocking the roads and committing other evil actions, which it would take too long to mention* The net result has been that the inhabitants of Hijaz and Tahama have been compelled to communicate with their kinsmen who reside on our side appealing to them against the evil acts of the Sharif which are contrary to reason and Shara’* Moreover x affairs have been quiet for a long time between us and the inhabitants of Yemen, Saiyed Idrisi, and ibn ’Ayidh but £ the Sharif has now T widened his intrigues to the extent of- 2 - of 'brilDing the people of 'Asir with the object of persuading them to break their solemn promises in order that trouble may ensue* They would appear to have selected as their instruments certain of rny subjects and those of Saiyed Al-idrisi and trouble has started in the South of Qahtan* As a result Saiyed Al-Idrisi has sent to my subjects calling them in accordance with the pledge which exists between us, to help him against Ibn Ayidh. Apart from the above the Sharif’s intrigues are felt from Medina right up to ’Asir. A few days ago g' certain of the inhabitants of Rijaz fled and came over to Najd. They have accused me of not keeping faith and breaking my promises which I had made them namely that the High Government would effedt/a settlement between the two of us and that evil movements would dis appear and peace would be restored and the Haj reopened* (in truth they are right) for I do not observe any of these to have happened. e It was my intention from the beginning to fight a battl with Sharif and insha Allah it would be easy for me to deal with him. Ha on his part h*as endeavoured to discredit me with, my subjects. The people of Najd are of two groups. The Eastern and the Northern want the Haj reopened and a settle ment of the question - while the Western ana the southern groups who reside on the borders of the Sharif’s country and who have been harmed by the many evil and sneaking movements of the Sharif desire the reverse. These latter have been greatly embittered and I fear on this account that certain acts may result for which you will probably blame me.,The fact that my people on the borders have been raided and plundered by the Sharif who exceeds all bounds of propriety, and then goes and complains to His Majesty’s Government about my people’s act, men who have not committed 1/10th the harm that the Sharif has done, is beyond all suffranco. I get blamed by His Majesty’s Government andand get Warned 'by my subjects - An intolerable situation* I now therefore inform and request your Honour to communicate the matter to your High Government in order that they may either settle the question finally and definitely leaving what is in my hands to me and in the Sharif’s hands to him; or to leave the matter for settle ment between the two in our own fashion* Sooner or later the^latter course is bound to take place* As regards making any movement against Taif, Mecca and Medina I shall avoid to touch these until I receive Bn intimation* Regarding the movements of our subjects among themselves I cannot be responsible for what happens* I feel shame for the way I have repeated correspondence and com plaints on subject, which seems to be unending and results in nothing tangible. As regards myself God be praised i am one of the chief witnesses against the Sharif, his sons, and their evil machinations against the High Government, its Ally Hrance and against all their friends, you should weigh peoples minds by their actions, more than you do. The object of this intimation of mine is the mainte- nance of peace and to obtain the satisfaction of my friends the High Government* I hope, you will continue your kind regards towards your friend.

URGENT. Following is summary of King Hussein’s reply to message contained in your telegram No. 556. 1. He denies having agreed to meet Bin Saud at Aden (though he previously consented), 2 0 Arrival of Bin Saud at Mesca with thousands of pilgrims would inevitably provoke serious disturbances and he cannot accept proposal. 3. Support against Wahhabis for w?alch he has asked would be still more necessary if he did agree, 4. He agrees to Bin Saud coming to Mecca with a small f oilowing, 5. He agrees to pilgrims coming from Nejd by sea. 6. He complains that Great Britain has not kept her written promise of assisting him with troops against his enemies. is 7. Concludes by saying that it/useless for him to meet Bin Saud in the presence of many people owing to certainty of disturbances and reiterates his request to be relieved of his troubles by the appointment of a successor to him. The letter is moderate in tome. In view however of the impossibility of Nejd pilgrims coming by sea and of Bin Baud's aim os t2 almost certain refusal to come as King wants (which would put Bin Saud in an inferior position) it amounts to rejection of proposals of His Majesty’s Government to effect a reconciliation 'between him and Bin Saud. Colonel Vickery reports that some 700 troops left Mecca for Taif on 26th instant* Possibly King can he induced to meet Bin Saud at Aden later on hut in the meantime there is possihility that Bejdis will he so exasperated at Being refused permission to make pilgrimage that they will attach Kedj az either with or without the approval of Bin Saud, King’s attitude on this question is another instance of his changeable policy since publication of San Homo decisions. I consider that His Majesty’s Government should make it very clear to King that he cannot expect their support if he refuses to accept their advice and that danger he is reaming by adopting such an attitude should he pointed out.

His Majesty's Government have received with much gratification the intimation that Your Majesty has consented to meet Ibn Saud at Aden. They are happy to inform you that Ibn Saud has similarly expressed his readiness to meet Your Majesty. He has however suggested as an alternative that he should himself come to Mecca with the Nejd pilgrimage and discuss the various points at issue in Your Majesty's capital. His Majesty's Government are anxious that you should be spared che fatigue of a voyage to Aden, and trust that you will agree to this proposal. They suggest that Your Majesty- should arrange for the Emir Abdullahto meet the Nejd pilgrimage at Taif end accompany Ibn Saud to Mecca where they have little doubt that the two powerful friends of His Majesty’s Government will come to a satisfactory agreement. They propose if you see no objection to arrange for a responsbble Indian Moslem Officer to accompai the Nejd pilgrims,and are confident that Your Majesty will adhere to the guarantee already given that the pilgrimage shall be re-opened and that you will restrain your people from any aggression. Ibn Baud for his part has given the required undertaking that the Nejd pilgrims will be placed in charge of a responsible official who will guarantee their good behaviour. His Majesty's© Majesty’s Government would also be grateful if Your Majesty would permit them to assist you in arranging for the Nejd pilgrims to have every facility for purchasing suppliesuat Mecca for the return journey, as the quantities they are bringing are limited.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. £“ / 3 2_ t'/z/&lt;* &lt;f and address— ' ' not to any person by name, but to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 . 4837 ' S O 20 no THE Undei-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to zbt&lt;.

I suggest therefore that His Majesty's Government should inform him that Bin Baud has agreed to meeting at Aden or Taif immediately after pilgrimage and invitee his views a,s to which place is better. Reference should he made to our willingness to send high officials if desired and particular stress laid on necessity of preserving status quo meanwhile and of allowed ing Nejd pilgrimage under conditions already outlined. Question of Indian officer accompanying pilgrimage and of continuing supplies at Mecca for return journey should also be mentioned. King has shown tendency to rescind his decision about peirnitting pilgrimage from Nejd so communication should be film in tone* As Emir Abdulla will not be required for meeting at present I see no objection to his being invited to England in a few cloys if quarantine crisis passes off.

It is for this reason that 1 do net delay or hesitate, in submitting these necessary and important communications, 'knowing well that these concern ..o. a’s Government and * myself. These are as follows : 1 have received a letter from Amir Faisal together with an enclosure, inviting me t’o an alliance with him and his adherents. These letters were accompanied by certain undesiraole instructions and exhortations in book form that are opposed to our interests, that is to say, the interests of . . ‘a Government, as we!3 as .';y own. ( The letters ano pamphlet were ie.it : e} with t spies of unknown identity, and borrowed Arab names with the object of promulgating tne views exoreused therein through- i out this our Arabian Peninsula and gaining the participatior of tr^ba in their evil aims and objects. It is also certair that they have sent (similar communications and) ien to i Ibn Rashid, Ibn Sha’alan the Imam Yahya and the Idrisi Amir of ’Assir. This evil oropaganda is likely to gain in bulk and extent in a short time and if it is once aolaze then it will be impossible to extinguish and will set us on fire wit its flames. «egl.edt or inattention of the above will only injure me and my mend the British Government.

These Bolsheviks have stamped their power and prestige in the Kast and are assisted by all the Islamic nations in the last not only for the sake of Bolsheviks as such but because they are the enemies of all aggression (lit. colonisation) which they are endeavouring to orevent.

This should be the thought «r of every wise nan. however, what you remarked about the mattes concerning your father (King lussain) and your brother(myself] it is obvious that a detailed review of the same will be too long ( for this note)* our Excellency is, doubtless, aware @i so ie of the circumstances and initial causes* '-cd knows tiiat I did not bring that (situation) about, nor did I wish or even believe it to be so* The following events will bear out the above statement* firstly, his (King Husain’s) attack on Najd and capture of baad bin Abdur Ftehman on whom may Jod have raercyl you knos he ( 3 aad) had only a handful of men from amo#g the bedouins and our own forces were quite sufficient to extripate him* To my mind, the capture of Gaad in the centre of hajd and hia confinement (by King misain) was a disgrace to me, yet I let it pass off only to maintain peace and to show my respect for him (King iiusain) and ^our Excellency. Secondly, at the time of your fighting with the Turks, I h was able to withold assistance by keeping apart my own forces and by forbidding my gubjects to fight on your side,or even to raise a countermovement. To this end the Turks did not omit to offer me solemn pledges and substantial oromises the real nature of which is known to H.IuY’s Government* In spite of all this, I did not make or allow the least hostile movement against your interests until at last when i io\md letter of your father (King l usain) addressed to the \mirs of ibajd inciting.••••••inciting them to revolt against us - thank Goal They are not capable of rebellion even if they become excited - also letters to the inhabitants of Tarabah and Khurma and their £vi friends showing religious hatred and declaring that those who follow the inhabitants of ^ajd are 'Kafir” (heretics) 'Khawarij* (Apostates)• Thirdly* even since God. ordained the &amp;ffair(conflict) between your brother Abdullah and some of our forces in connection with certain caravans of ecca and edinah* the condition of both^these towns is extremely wretched and the majority of the inhabitants have been inviting me to(go tnA rule over) them; but X have desisted from taking this step, firstly to show respect to God’s Harem and secondly to the Holy JProphet’s city (blessings be on him). These facts are well known to four Excellency and you are my best witness* As regards an agreement with your father proposed to f be arrived at through Your Excellency, it is clear that auch an agreement would be most welcome to me on all grounds, religious as well as moral, I should heartily wish it on two conditions:- AB far as our religious differences are concerned the ^ arbiter should he the &lt;*uran and the crochet's 3unnah (tradl- | tions). Whatever is ordered therein is acceptable, and what |; is forbidden must be given up. If the wordly and |&gt;olitical differences are to be composed then the point is not obscure or unknown: (each party) to ^ the territories of his ancestors; be careful to avoid causirv: loss to one another; do justiee and thus be helpful in secur ing union and protecting common interests for the good of * 1 ^ without following selfish inclinations or interested advioe. (I) your brother, am preoared to spend my life and money for ^ putting an end to the disturbed state of affairs and ta acnx- an improvement of our condition.

Confidentia l« Translation of a letter dated 22 nd Rajab 1338(= 12 th April 1920) from Bin Sa.ud to Hajor H.R,P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political .Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter 6f 9th Rajab 1338 which contained the telegraphic communication from the honoured Colonel Wilson, Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, on the subject of * : Sharif Husain’s report that my forces burnt two villages near Taif; that the attacking force consisted of Majd tribes of Subaia, Bagura and ’Ataibah incited or lead by Khalid; and that they had killed two men of Al-Harith tribe. You remarked that you would be obliged by my informing you of the true facts of the matter. I now inform your honour of the facts. It is true that two villages were burnt and some men were killed and others captured. All that happened while l was at Hassa. The real facts of the matter, as I now know them myself, will appear to you from a perusal of the (enclosed) letters of Khalid and Ibn Ghannam. I did not hasten to send the news on to your honour, even though I received it myself, for two reasons: firstly, I know very well, as does also H.B.M’s Government that the Sharif has always been sending up false reports (and I wanted to see what he would do on this occasion) Secondly, I supposed that perhaps the Sharif had laid the blame on his own subjects of the borders of Hijaz who were the real aggressors and had burnt tne two villages in question; but (I now see) that he put it down to my subjects. Further the man against whom Khalid and his followers the said Subaia, Bagum and ’Ataibah had advanced was Ibn Muharris of Ash-Shalawat (tribe) of Barabah who is nf mv subiects. This man turned traitor it seems and oinedI ^ I ^ down (to Tarabah) to corait a raid, as is described in Khalid ! s letter (enclosed^ The Sabaia* and Bagum and some of the *Ataibah who were nearby »fazaa-ed» (rushed to arms) on getting wind of the raid, attacked the raiders and repulsed them re-capturing the booty taken by the Sharifian force# Afterwards they came down upon Ibn Muh&amp;rris, my own subject, and punished him for his disloyalty and treason in joining the Shairf’s force against our own subjects# The proof of his disloyalty, while being one of my subjects, lies in the letter of 'Hath wa Bakht' (safe conduct) under the Sharif's signatures, which was found in his house afterwards- This man Ibn Muharris had also committed many other evil acts including miarder and rapine. 1 did not imagine that the Sharif would complain abodt one of my men punishing another for a fault. In addition, I should like to inform your honour, as I did before, that as long as the disputes between the Sharif and myself remain unsettled, so long there is bound to be trouble between the subjects of both sides, for you know the nature of Arabs; there are foolish and evil characters on both sides who are irresponsible though not of any importance. These no one can check or control until the outstanding questions between &lt;is their rulers are settled. It is he (Sharif) alone who represents these (petty) matters to H.B.M's Government, and it suits him to use falsehood and magnify matters; while such affairs are &lt; in reality of daily occurrence among the subjects of 1 neighbouring Arab rulers who still continue to be friends. For instance, such things happen between Ibn Bashid and aoyx: myeelf or Ibn Sabah and myeelf and* among other neighbouring Arab rulers; punishments are meted out to offenders and losses of sufferers made good. But the Sharif Husain only wants to change your ideas or opinion (about me^ and does not feel ashamed of telling lies axat as this is his habit. I have already stated the truth of the matter as will be3 Letter of Khaiid Lin Mansur, Amir of Khurma, to Bin Saud dated 25th Jamadi I »38 (= 15th February 1920). After Compliments, I Leg to inform you of the state of affairs of this part of the country. All is well and theire is peace and tranquility except a little disturbance due to the Sharif's acts which have roused the people and made the Akhwan here rather restless. I have been trying to pacify them and tell them that the Imam does not approve of this (disturbance of peace) but impresses on us the need for peace and quiet. Becently the Sharif sent a force headed by Raqi al-Parm and Sanahat at Kharras with one of the Asharaf whose name I could not ascertain. They assembled in the plain between Khurma and Hadhn and raided the al- Hariq and Kurzan as also a number of our nomads (of Khurma) and TarabahJ may they be destined to failure l) taking about 100 camels and killed about 500 goats and killed 7 men. When the news of the event reached our tribesmen they at once made a fazaa and it was ascertained that the raiding party was secretly invited by Ibn Muharris # of whose camel-riders took part in the raid. When we arrived on the scene, they were still fighting, so we attacked them together. We re-captured 50 camels out of the 100 looted and also took Ibn Muharris and his party. I would have disliked telling you what sort of man Ibn Muharris was lest you put it down to ill-will on my part, but, thank God i here is a clear proof, firstly, he joined Sharif's force, secondly, this (enclosed) is his letter shewing he was in secret correspondence with Sharif, I am, thank God, now able to meet him in every way, but I do not like to do anything without orders. The Sharif's own subjects are now-a-days clearly against him and discontent is rife since the murder of 'Aaso al-Hamraq whose relations al-Hamariqah headed by Bin Badavi are all up against ih? the4. the Sharif. These latter are collecting large numbers of men from among the followers of Mukhlid bin »Afair of al-’Awafir (tribe) and Zaiyad as-Safaiyani of Nafaah (tribe) and Hadhlul and al-Hanshar (tribes). There has been already a sharp figh-^bbtween themi resulting in 30 killed and two country houses burnt in Kilakh, one being the well-known *^asr-ibn-Salah*. All the above, have been writing to me recently but their evil intentions are for•them alone. Robbery and evils prevail among them. I wanted to go out (touring) as usual at this time so that I might prevent the robbery and evil acts Qf these men and the Ashraf at and near Taif who, too, nave been writing to me. The only answer I have returned is that whosoever would like to come over to our side must seve* all connection with Sharif and his subjects and tnat on doing so, he will have nothing to gear those who obey the Sharif, I wrote, and who follow his ways must be regarded as he is regarded himself (enemy) You understand these affairs too well to need explaining at length. These cannot be neglected and ignored any longer or there will be serious consequences. Had I not been informed that you were going to Hassa, I should certainly have come and seen you personally about these and other matters that weigh on my mind. This is all and I await a reply.

Dated 15/3/1920. ne Infomation has been received that Sherif Peisal was crowned King of Syria at Damascus on March 8th by an assembly at that place who also declared that Sharif Abdullah was King of Mesopotamia. I am as yet without official information as to the attitude which will be adopted in this connection but it may be assumed that neither H.M.G. nor the Prench Government will find them selves able to recognise as valid any acts or declarations of this self constituted assembly. Syria, Palestine,Mosul and Mesopotamia were conquered by the Allied forces from the Turks and their future can be decided only by the Allied Powers acting in concert. It also may be taken for granted that H.M.G. under no circumstances can admit the right of anyone in Damascus to decide the future of Mesopotamia. Sent to Bushire, Koweit, Maskat, Bahrain. Last named to inform Bin Saud by privs/te letter.1 Translation of a letter dated the 12th Rajah, 1338 (r 2nd April, 1920) from Shaikh Sir Ahdul Aziz hin Ahdur Rahman A1 Faisal As Saud, Ruler of Najd and Dependencies, to Major H.R.P* Dickson, Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your cordial letter dated 27th Jamadi al Awwal 1338 with its enclosure, a copy of the translation of a telegra,m from His Honour Colonel Wilson, Civil Commissioner, Baghdad* which 1 fully understand, especially your remarks about the affairs of Amirs, Faisal and Abdullah, who have made themselves kings of Syria and Iraq, respectively. I would also say in that eewtexi otj that I acquainted you personally with their evil hopes and aims. But I could not enlarge upon the subject, because I was rather shy to talk of this exactly in the way they think. As the ancient Arabs have a saying, »a perfect man, half a man and no man 1 . The perfect man’ possesses judgment, yet consults others; while the *no man* does not either possess judgment or seek counsel or advice. Both the above (Amirs) are, I am quite certain, in this last category. I have observed strict brevity and conciseness in my communications to Hie Britannic Majesty’s Government in relation to certain matters, as I fear that if I enlarge upon these. His Britannic Majesty’s Government might think that I had personal reasons for so doing, or that I was afraid of my enemies. But sheer necessity makes me address your honour on this subject. You know my love for the Great Government is based on community of interests, because I cannot imagine, nor can any sane person, that the existence of an Arab Government can ensure the position and control of this (Arabian) Peninsula, and its surrounding territories and waters. And it is also patent and self-evident to me and to any one possessing reason that the relaxation of British control over2 . jr over (Arabian) £ea and maritime countries and the consequent entr^ of* the Arabs into alliance with Turks and their friends the Germans, is one of their misfortunes, and will cause their ruin, including myself* For this reason it is incumbent upon me to endeavour to secure and further her (British Government*©) interests in this Arabian Peninsula generally, and in Central Arabia particularly* I shall continue to do this until and unless I see two things; firstly, in-attention (of Government) to #hat I say; secondly, if I find that my honour and position are at stake Then only shall I be absolved and will prefer death to life, for I know too well that my interests are bound up in union with the Great Government* And this is what makes me determined to do my utmost to the best of my power and understanding. Now I shall submit to your honour the following suggestions , Firstly, do not take lightly what people say and do not place your reliance i*r the inhabitants of Syria and neighbouring countries, or in the self-styled kings - they cannot have good ideas and aims or any thing that will have the result. But, on the contrary, be sure that they are like blind man gone astray, unable to see and having no sense to stop, till at last they fall into a ditch. Secondly weigh the sayings of some of the ancient Arab learned men. They were asked as to the causes of the downfall of the Abbaside Empire, and the reply was, “They took their enemies for their friends, and honoured and favoured them in the hope of winning them over and at the same time left their friends at a distance, trusting in their friendship*, When the hour of need came, they found that their former friends' hearts had been estranged and the enemies found an opportunity for achieving their aims and succeeded. M Now, it is quite clear to your honour that 'ijpur Govt, has no better friend, among European Powers, th^jn France; so, do not let hevbe played with by Syrians, but do, all you3 3 can, to strengthen the bonds of unity with her, so that there may not be the least doubt in her mind from your side, for your enemies will increase by her weakness. At the same * ' time, the British Government has no sincere friend among the Arabs, except myself, whose personal interests are strong. C onsider the ,matter before anything happens, and bridge the nrr-,, n-MW] gulf before it wide ns. The solution of this problem is easy enough for the Great Government and her ally (France) if the} consider the matter and co-operate, taking wise measures, as great advantage lies in their settlement, while delay and in-attention will have serious results. The ignorant can easily be decieved, and thereby the enemy can gain strength, although he may not possess any real advantage or power. I would call your attention to the saying trhich I have mentioned above of the blind and senseless man. You will see in the ”Al-Kowkab M dated the 17th February 1920, that people have already started calling meetings and gatherings, and * ’ making speeches and publications of the undesirable type in their own language. This makes friends sorry and enemies glad. Were i asked as to my opinion about the solution of this problem, I should say something. Thirdly, let it be clearly understood that the whole of the Islamic world, with the exception of Central Arabia, have, as an article of religious faith, that every guardian ship (khilafat) except that of Turks, is void; while every- body knows that the Shareef (king Husain) got up (joined the Allies) in the hope of replacing them (Turks) in 'Khilafat H ; and he gives hopes to his followers that he will be your rival, which is the hope of all of them- May God frustrate their hope. I, personally, told your honour the whole account of tl Syrians who, as I said, have no real power themselves, but are in the hands of the userper, that is officers and officials formerly attached to the Turkish army and certai: other wild adventurers. The best confirmation of their attitude is to be found in the words of Sir Reginald Wingat - the 7a4 ♦ 5 ); the late High Commissioner in Egypt, for he attributed the conquest of Syria to the Arab Army, and he turned their | heads by saying this. Fourthly, let it be clearly understood that as long as S the Shareef and his sons continue to have any connections with the affairs of Syria or its neighbouring countries, other than the Hejaz, so long is it inevitable that he (and his sons) should continue to oppose you both inwardly | attdi outwardly, because they have something at heart. As the saying goes 'A man's enemy is he who shares his work' (Men of the same profession seldom agree). I have really been tedious in writing all this, although I had personally wm explained to you everything in detail in the course of our interview. I think that would suffice, but if you like, would write at greater length. My father and sons, Faisal and Saud, send you their best salaams. I hc&amp;e you will convey my best salaams to the Honourable Colonel Wilson. This is what had to be said and may you be preserved.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100032483990.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/391/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032483990.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/391/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2182/1913 Pt 12 'ARABIA: RELATIONS WITH BIN SAUD (AMIR OF NEJD) (HEJAZ-NEJD BOUNDARY DISPUTE)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1920/1920</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-09T18:10:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (223 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Part 12 concerns British policy regarding the dispute between Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd, also referred to in the correspondence as Ibn Saud] and King Hussein of Hejaz [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī, King of Hejaz]. Much of the correspondence relates to (unsuccessful) efforts by the British to arrange a meeting between the two rulers. The correspondence discusses conditions and arrangements for a proposed meeting at Mecca (as suggested by Bin Saud), immediately after pilgrimage [Hajj].The correspondence goes on to discuss details of an armistice agreement made between King Hussein's committee and the Nejd deputation, at Mecca. A translation of the agreement states that the two parties agree to end all hostile movements and resume negotiations as soon as possible through the British government.Also included are the following:details of a proposed gift of £5000 from the British government to Bin Saud (plus an honorary GCIE – Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire);proposals of a payment of £30,000 by the British government to King Hussein, on the condition that the King signs a treaty with Turkey [the Treaty of Sèvres, which began the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire];a copy (in Arabic) of the aforementioned Treaty;news of reports that King Hussein's son, Sherif Feisal [Fayṣal bin Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī, also referred to in the correspondence as Amir Feisal], has been crowned King of Syria, and copies of translations of correspondence between Feisal and Bin Saud.The item includes the following principal correspondents:Secretary to the India Office's Political Department (John Evelyn Shuckburgh);Civil Commissioner, Baghdad [held in an officiating capacity by Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Talbot Wilson];High Commissioner, Egypt (General Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby);Political Agent, Bahrain (Major Harold Richard Patrick Dickson);Foreign Office;War Office;Treasury;Bin Saud.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Iraq Fayṣal I</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mecca</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Sèvres (1920)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Negotiation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032483990.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
