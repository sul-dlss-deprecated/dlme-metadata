To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, NEW DELHI. Subject:- Transfer of Aden. Postal Rates. Sir, I have the honour to refer to paragraph 3 of Express letter P.Z. 5302/36 of the 12th August 1936 addressed to you oy the Secretary of otate for India in which agreement is recorded that rates between India and Aden should remain unchanged. 2. In all the discussions leading up to that agreement the only rate which has been specifically mentioned has been that for ordinary letters. I have assumed, however, that the agree ment is intended to refer to the broad principle of maintaining all postal changes between Inuia and Aden at existing rates, out in order to avoid any misunderstanaing I feel that it is desirable to obtain confirmation that this point of view is correct. 3. Apartf 3* Apart from postage rates on letters and other postal articles the following is a list of postal services for which more favourable rates exist between India and Aden than between India and other parts of the British Empire. (1) Parcel Post. (2) Money Orders. (3) Value Payable Post. (4) Insurance. (5) Postage on Registered Newspapers. 4 . I think it will oe agreed that the reasons which led to a continuance of the existing postage rates can be applied with e^ual force to maintain the existing changes for these services and I shall be grateful if it may be confirmed that the Govern ment of India is prepared to maintain them on a reciprocal basis.

Colonial Office are glad to accept suggestion in last paragraph of letter xrom your Department of Industries and Labour dated 7th November viz:; that rates between India and Aden should remain unchanged., / THE HESILElTCYj Aden, 5th. May 1936. Dear Walton, Yfill you please refer to Lai thv/aite 1 s letter to me p.Z.7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, and adding' remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Reilly.

I5 ^ eUA&amp;, '&gt;'’' ^ 1,4 ' a ’j Q — lnt 3&gt; Printing ana sale n f starts . j have referred to this question under Point 2. Indian postage rates are at present in force in Aden, that is to say, the | minimum charge for ordinary letters is ( 1 ) One anna to any place in India, ( 2 ) 2 £ annas to the United Kingdom and all the British possessions participating in the British Imperial postage scheme and (3) annas to any other part of the world served by Foreign Post except Ceylon and Portuguese India. I consider that these Indian rates should be continued, at any rate for a time, if this is possible under Colonial administration. An exception may be the rate to India. If the Government of India decide to raise the postage from India to Aden fromtthe firs ^category, it may be necessary for the Aden Government similarly to raise the rate from Aden to India. This change would be unpopular in Aden, especially with the Indian community, many of whom have a large business correspondence with India. It will be more satisfactory if the present postal rates between India and Aden could be preserved by special agreement, and I recommend that the possibility of making an a rrangeme nt to this e fTect be examined*L etter from Colonel R e illy to Mr.Lait-hYzaite tq r/Sunnierset, L^mington, HANTS Tel: Lwdngton 252 10th August, 1933 Dee.r Laith^aite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India* Those that occur to me are:- 3. Printing and sale.'.of stamps.. If Aden becomes a • Crown Colony it will presumably have its own stamps, and the cost of printing them and the proceeds from their sale will be items in the new Aden budget*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000006_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1470</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000006</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1470</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/34 'Aden.
