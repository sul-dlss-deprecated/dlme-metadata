Their functions are important and by their zeal in dis charging them they will earn the gratitude of all. My visit to Karachi has more than ever impressed me with the advantages of sanitation. When I was there fifteen years ago there was much malaria, but this year I did not see a single mosquito. They have stopped all breeding grounds and now there none, in fact if anyone has malaria, the Municipal doctors immedia tely come and see where the mosquito can have come from. Of course if precautions are relaxed they can return J • very quickly. I con show you a place where hundreds are breeding near the Secretaries house. The Baladiyya must be prepta*ed to enter on all private premises and see they are kept ? clean and not a source of danger to their neighbours. ■ -• i ■ ii X I* / 1 , Is' \ To Shrikh Mohomed Bin Isa Al-Kkdifah, President, Mon; mo Baladya Af ter Cop.’ pi iaent s, I seggest that the Bolrdiya should nass a Municipal law to the effect that no householder shall instsl a running water- supply or indoor water sanitation in his house without first apply ing to the Bnladya who will con^k^ der the question and take the opinion of the Medical Officer on the subject. Some time ago the ijuerican Mission applied for permission to moke a drain into the munici pal drain which goes from theGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. - 2 - the mimicipal garden to the sea. I myself suggested thet this should be allowed. For some time there appeared to be no harm from this but lately I have been several times to the garden and it appears to me that the dirty from the mission which comes out from their numerous latrines, is entering the Baladye garden and remaining there instead of going down to the sea; also e great quantity of water from three other wells is collecting in the garden ins tend of flowing down the drain to the sea. I suggested that the drain had become filled up somewhere but I am told that no stoppage could be found. I have seen the water coming out near the Jiuaa mosque end it is a very small amount. I consider that steps should be t; ken at once to examine the drain and to cause the water to flow down into the sea.Cji GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. -3- The garden is aghin becoming full of water which besides injur ing the trees and plants is a great danger to the public health first because it has lande a breeding nlace for mosquitoes and secondly because the contents of the mission drain, which carries off their dirty water is now entering the municipal garden and lying in it. I recommend the subject to your attention. Adviser to the Government.f' ronqttitoes breed in w nt water on 1 for Tarious reaeons cto'nont water has increased.

HoL^nes. It seems t int there are now roughly four tines t'le number of malaria cases that there were prior to 192^ and that the disease is becoming more widely distributed. * 5 You will remember that we mentioned it sometime ago in general conversation and i have seen your letter No: 862/19 dated the 19th December 1932 to the President iiananah Mmicipality. 2. I understand that there is a general consensus of opinion, which seems to be supported by such statistics as L have seem** • • (a) that malaria has increased to a very serious extent in tne last few years, and (h) that it has done so on account of the waste water from the artesian wells forming breeding grounds for mos quitoes# 3. I gather that you agree that it would be wise to take action as soon as possible to strike at the source of the evil, that is to say, the .artesian wells. If they could be capped and the output of water controlled, it should render it much easier to cope wit : the spread of malaria* I fancy that fi &gt;ting the wells with suitable con- ' trol ca s would not be costly; though if, as I am told, some of the wells ore only cased for a few feet, it may be an expensive matter to prevent the water from leaking up round outside of the casing, if the casing itself if closed f Afl a first st^p, would it be possr.k4 £o find out (perhaps from the uahrain re roie^ Limited) what the best (cheap) means of capping wells would be and also to have a statement made showing whatpage 2 — i 4, From the discussion in the Municipal Meeting which I attended in December at Manamali f I should say that there was a body of educated public opinion in favour of an anti-malaria wells and to institute other anti-malaria measures * it might be well to try to do something to mobilise a wider public opinion in i OUT* O’f* FtTW SI 'K f'' TVC twVi 'f/''K m ts-r ! &gt; mr« + r\ +• som mal in convenient time and try to reach some general decision as to how to proceed. campaign, but before taking action to control the output of the yours sincerely,Translation of No.21/1347 dated the 28thRajab 1347(9.1.29) (f issued by the Bahrain Manamah Municipality.

The purchasers buy these on the understanding that they would measure the number of yards marked on them but when actually measured they were found to be short by one or two yards. The purchaser, v/ho is of the poor class and who sells piece goods by yards(retail) is thus put to loss. 2.

No. 279/8 of 1353 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Bated, R/Thany 5. 1353 July 18, 1934. H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the hnour to report that by vour courtesy, I have today heard that the Acting Secretary of the Manamah Baladiah, Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakhro will depart from Bahrain to Bag hdad by tomorrow's (Thursday's) Airmail. In view of this I sent for the Acting President, K. B. Hajy Abdul Rahman A1 Zayany, who confirmed this. I informed the Khan Bahadur:- 1. That, in accordance with local usage, it would have been polite if Ahmed Fakhro had called to pay his respects and inform me of this, and 2. That, I consider it suitable that he should write an application to The Adviser, asking for approval to be granted before he departs, and 3. That, I do not approve of his departure before the Secretary, Aly bin Hussain Khal- fan, returns to Bahrain, when he should report progress during ihe Secretary's absence. Khan Bahadur Abdul Rahman A1 Zayany ex plained 1. There is very little work in progress in the Manamah Baladiah, whose next meeting is in a fortnights' time, and consequently The Acting Secretary can be easly spared for a week, after which it is probable that the Secretary will have returned, and 2. He had understood that Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakhro had already called at the Customs, but had not seen me.Later, Khan Bahadur Abdul Rahman A1 Zayany brought Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakhro to me at The Adviser-ate, when this latter said to me in English:- 1. He did not see me in the Customs General Office, downstairs ? (it being well known thax; I was working upstairs). 2. He had obtained permission to depart from His Excellency, The Ruler; 3. He had obtained permission to depart A from The Political Agent. 4. He had announced his departure to The Majlis al Baladiah, of which he is a member. 5. He had arranged for The Clerk of The Baladiah, one Abdul Rahman Al Sha’ijy to report for orders every morning to The Acting President. For the above reasons, it did not appear to him necessary to write xo The Adviser. I told Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakhro that I con sidered it desirable that he should ask The Adviser f s approval of his departure, and state a reason for it, and also that I did not approve of his departing before the return of the Sec retary, to whom he should report his work. This young man replied that he could not apply for permission to depart, as he had already obtained it, nor could he state a reason, as his departure was occasioned by private family circumstances. I told him that no one wished to enquire into his private family concerns, and he stated that within a half hour he would write to The Adviser announcing his departure. Commenting on the above,, and without wishing to stress this young man f s discourtesy to The Adviser (by whose approval. I believe, he sits in The Majlis), I venture xo suggest xhat, al though it is quite possible that the work of The Baladiah will be slight during the next two weeks, and his attendance may not be urgent, yet, it is not at all suitable for anyone filling an impor tant public position to leave it at his own plea sure ? and assume that he is permitted to do so by Higher Authority.

Ose of shops as sleeping rooms, and use oi lanes as places of public convenience. • It is doubtful whether the Council can legimately interfere with the rights of the publia to use their shops in whatever manner it is desired by them. In some cases it might result in a hardship to compel people to hire separate houses for living purposes. Lunicipality should take strong measures to cease .he nuisance.

It will be seen from this letter that the Municipality could not prove any case against either the local • • « « * or the Bombay merchants and mills. Tllg piece of cloth now forwarded by the Baladiyah docs not appear to have been tampered with by anyone, and in all probability this is a genuine case of incorrect marking by the manufacturers.

This information may be asked from the Secretary of the Municipality before taking up the question with the authorities in Bombay. tjf ^ « '.A. would perhaps consider the axjUMtebility of suggesting to manufacturers in India through the' above organisa tions to have the cloth sealed on either ends with correct making with Mills seal etc. before it's issue from the Mills.

The underlying idea in the issue of S.N.25 was ) to collect information from the Secretaiy of the Baladiyah regarding specific cases of fraud, if any; on the part of the Indian Mill-owners to support a reference to the Chambers,. 3. It will be,however, seen from para(c) of the p.u.c. that about 75 per cent or more of the cloth is purchased white by we ight and the mill-owners are responsible to a very small extent i.e. 25 per cent or less for the import of dyed cloth into Bahrain. In this connection attention is also invited to the penultimate sentence of clause 7 of para.(c) above, wnich says that since the present case of incorrect marking, the parties concerned have mutually agreed to manufacture pieces of 37-38 yards in future, 4. In the circumstances explained above, a reference to ! the Indian Chambers of Commerce seems unjustified, p^opaaert .infwin the Secretary of the Ba 1 adiyah/a2cordingly^ Draft for approval is placed below. s‘ // I do not think that v e shd correspond direct with the It- Baladiyah in a mfebter like this; nor do I think that the Resolutions of the Baladiyah (enclosures to S.N.24) are within the powers of a Municipal Council.
