Before co/.mmicating to Hie Majesty's Government the Sheroef's final refusal of military assistance we proffered him, I wish to be assured (if possible in writing) by Shereef that the following points are clearly understood and accepted by him. 1. That an European force with the requisite transport to convoy them to Habegh cannot be retained indefinitely at Suez or cisowhoro and should be transfer red to another theatre of operations where they can be actively employed. 2. Consequently, that if, in a later emergency Sheroof applies for European troops to bo landed on Hcdjaz coast these troops will not bo available. 3. That Moslem troops for which sheroef. asks are not available now nor,, even if they could be despatched in time, would thoy in our opinion be capable to restore a dangerous military situation. 4. British operations in Sinai are being developed rapidly and will doubtless have a certain effect on Turk's dispositions in Kedjaz but Shereef and Arab leaders should bo Warned against undue optimism regarding irrmodiate results of those operations.

It may he some time heTorc cur progress can ofTectively sever Turkish ma-in lino o£ corarflunications between Syria and Hedjaz. 5. Henceforward, therefore, Arab force operating in Hedjaz must rely on themselves only (with such assistance in war material and expert personnel as we are able to supply) to hold back a possible Turkish advance, and they can no longer count on any more regular units being sent to Hodjaz to support them in case oi failure. 6. It is my earnest hope that Sheroef's decision not to accept the European fcrco wo have offered him for the defence of Rabogh, has been well based and that his decision has not been unduly influenced by pro- Turkish and publicly (sic ?purcly) religious elements, whoso theory and (however sincere and well intentioned) counsels if followed to their logical conclusions - might load to military disaster and to the collapse ox now independence of the Arab Kingdom in Hodjaz. I await Shcreef’s assurance on the above points before coirnunieating his final decision to His Majesty's Government. You should press for an immediate reply to this message. Ends.

'' No. 93. 54 7 1 a I have received by telegraph from Jeddah sum mary of a letter from Shereef addressed to me. This letter was written apparently in confirmation of previous messages (see my telegram Mo. 06 of December 16th to you) and before Shereef could have received my latest communication to him in accordance with instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 46 of December 20th. Shereef reiterates his objections to landing of Christian troops at Rabegh and Reaffirms his complete confidence in our good faith. He minimises services an immobile force at Rabegh can render so long as Turkish railway communications with Medina are open and refers to his previous understanding that Kedjaz | Railway would bo cut by British troops as soon as arah revolt took place. i He “cannot believe that Great Britain is unable to spare 1,500 Moslem troops from her five million soldiers or from soldiers of Allied Bowers, which would f ho loss dangerous than landing Christian troops. Colonel V/lison has gone to R tbegh with Colonel Bremcnd and states that the latter has telegraphed to French Government recommending despatch of twonk battalions of jiative troops to ivabegh. These troops, v,/ith ^rerch god tin gent from Sues and Naval assistance, in Colonel Wilson's opinion, could hold the aerodrome site (but not the wells four miles inland) at habegh against a Turkish attack. Our evacuation of Habegh in fact of a strong Turkish raid vronld have very bad effect on Arabs. I should therefore welcome above proposal if agreed to by French Government.

The Turks may not be in a position to take advantage of this immediately but, if they advance on Rabegh, the Arab forces cannot be relied on to stop tuerr.. At a conference at Rabegh (at which Colonel \loon and the local military officers were present) Colonel Bremond stated that he would telegraph to French Government that the Aerodrome site at Rabegh requires a minimum garrison of three battalions with French contingent from Suez, Re considered French Government were unlikely to send senegalese or other troops unless we were also pre pared to do so. In view of the probably disastrous effect on tne Arabs (and the blow to our prestige) of the evacuation of Rabegh I have telegraphed instructions that evacuation is not to take place unless the Turks arrive in such force as to make the Aerodrome position untenable.

At this meeting which was attended by er storrs and eapt&amp;ln Lawrence of the Intelligence Department, I ooened the proceedings by the reading f the mess age contained in u.E.the Sirdar’s telegram No.459 dated October 15: the corrections made by Your Excel lency (Arab bureau*s telegram No.A.B.B dated 15th October) did not reach rae until late that night. Abdulla Bey was naturally very disapooin^ed at the final decision of His Majesty’s Government not to allow British Troops to be sent to Pabegh under any circumstances, i informed him that this decision covered the aeroplanes as an infantry escort must accompany them. My position regarding the aeroplanes was any thing but enviable as # on at least one occasion, I had informed the Lherif that they really were coming and informed him and Abdulla Bey of the actual date on which they would arrive finally, when the flight did arrive, it remained a day or two and returned to Suez.

The MAHMAL arrived here on October 14th from Mecca and left the next day on board H.M.S. 'HARDINGE' Jeddah. October 2f&gt;th. 1916. for Suez. EL LEWA AHMED PETIN PASHA Emir el Haj infor med me that he and the pilgrims were quite satisfied with all the arrangements made for their safety and comfort. The health of the Egyptian pilgrims was excellent theoughout, only one death from an ordinary disease occurring. SHEIKH KANDXL EL HILALI, who I understand was especially sent by H.H. the Sultan, arrived from Mecca with the '.lahmal suffering from malarial fever and had to be detained in hospital, he is now quite well but cannot leave Jeddah owing to the fear that the fact of his travelling on a Patrol Ship may put that ship in quarantine; the S.N.O. naturally cannot take such a risk which might lead to serious inter ference with the work of the Patrol. The French and Indian pilgrims are also reported to have been quite pleased with all pilgrim arran- 1 gements, the only complaint made by the latter which [ was reported to me after the departure of S.S. Hedjaz was that the boatmen overcharged them for the trip out to the steamer. I have written to the Sherif TAHA President of the local Pilgrimage Committee and have taken steps which I trust will prevent the abuse occurring again.Ttie departure of various Pilgrim Lhips have been re- ported to Arbur by telegram* I am sending a list of stranded JJgyptian Pilgrims to ” ARBUR ' by this mail, they have been in the Hedjaz tor various periods and if they are sent to Suez, as * suggest, I recommend that they be very carefully ex amined on arrival. he L her if h&lt;is, I think, done his best to make the 'ilgrirns contented and the Haj a success and it certainly appears to have been one of the quietest and healthiest pilgrimages on record, for which I consider the Sherif deserves some credit and I would suggest for Your ^rcallency’s consideration, that a letter be sent to him expressing Your ixcellency's congratulations and pleasure on the result; It would, I am sure, be greatly appreciated, TURKISH PHICONRRS. A further batch of prisoners leave in H.M.S. 'HARDINGS** tomorrow, a list of them is being sent to Arbur by this mail. I have been Informed by ALI BAZARI that when here GHALIB PASHA was leaving/several carts, full of his kit, were intercepted en route to the Jetty and taken to the house of Dherif i-IOHSHN, it would be interest ing for me to know whether GHALIB ’ASJIA confirms loss. There is a notice in yesterday’s issue of the Kibla to the effect that all ottoman Subjects must either leave the coufttry or become subjects of the Eherif’s Government. I have to-day received two applications from ottoruan-3- Ottoman subjects for a passage to Suez with the Pri soners of , ar leaving tonorrow which I have had to re fuse owing to the lack of accomodation. I have no idea how r T?iny may wish to leave but all who do must, I pre sume, be sent to Suez us occasion offers with other batches of prisoners, if this is not advisable, will Your 'excellency kindly advise me as to their disposal as they are Snerny Subjects. The present quarantine regulations are most in convenient and practically prevent anyone from proceed ing to Suez owing to the fear that by taking passengers the ship concerned will he quarantined. ; t t present the only method of retting to Egypt for the ordinary indi vidual is by dhow to ruakin and thence by Khedivial or Nile Route after undergoing quarantine. SHEIKH KAHDIL a 1IILAL1 is an old man and does not fancy a trip to Suakin by dhow and he must now re main here indefinitely. I understood from ’.tejor THO'ffiON D? 8.0. that he was recommending that only Passengers should be qua rantined and not Ships, I very much hope this course will be taken; existing conditions not only affect individuals, but greatly interfere with Commercial Intercourse with Egypt, french rnssioN. The members of the ’oslem Military Mission have remained at Mecca; I understand they asked permission to regain and assist in training recruits, the Sherif approved somewhat against his will. Colonel BrSmond recentlyrecently Informed me that up to date they had been given no recruits to train and were doing nothing, with the exception of one officer who Is going with Abdulla Bey, who ie preparing Transport. 'hat the Lherlf and his sons h&amp;Ve no love for the French appears to he true. Colonel BrSmond does not appear to have much for them, as he Informed Mr. Storrs and myself that he did not trust either the She- rif or Abdulla and thought It possible that the wherif had a secret understanding with the '’ur5:s, an oplnioo 1 j I do not agree with at all. Faisal Bey should be possible on return of Captain Lawrence from the former’s camp.

Ihe C&lt;Mranding Officer, * LUNKA* and myself landed at 6.15 p.m. The Idris arrived shortly afterwards accompanied by Said Mustafa Idrisi and Sheikh Mahomed Yehia Basahi. Ti,e Idrisi appeared extremely suljqr . 1. The four five inch Howitzers }jad been landed and assem bled by the morning of the 2nd. The Idrisi arrived at Gizan on the evening of the 2nd. Asked as to whether he was pleased with the guns he re ; lied that he li&amp;d not yet had time to see them, but had se-n a shell. He asked about their ran;® etc., and said that he would send four men to Aden for training when the Feast (October ICth) v/as over. He betrayed no enthusiasm on hearing that a number of field guns were to be sent to him from Aden. 2. Sounded as to any possibility of his attacking Lokeiya, he said tnat lie heard of the retirement of Turkish forces from the district and also from Khaaul&amp;n. He stated that any attack in the direction of Loheiya would bt countered by the Imam, whose interests were bound up with those of the Turks. He stated that the Imam had taken up residence at Shahara, about one day away from ths Idrisi frontisr. 3. Ha then asked if we had any shi} at Kunfida or wljsther we had had any news from there. Ho finally stated that he had just received a letter from Sheikh Hali of 3irk stating tijat Turkish troops from Muh&amp;il assisted by the Tribes who had petitioned the Sheriffs intervention against him (the Idriei) in July, had attacked Kunfida, driven out sheriff Nassir and his garrison and re occupiedrooccupiad the town on Wednesday tlia 26th.

That he had always been convinced of tin pro-Turkish attitude of the Tribes and of the certainty of their treachery to tl» Sheriff, and that this had been the only consideration which had prevented him attacking the Sheriff when ha was forced to evacuate Kunfida. permission to return to Egypt but hoped that ha wouid be re turning shortly. ?. lie questioned us closely us to whether Rumania had really ticn of the value of her strategic position in cutting of Turkey from the Central Powers.

Since despatch of telegram No. 629 of November 2nd X have discussed situation vith admiral Wemyss and Captain Lawrence who has just arrived from a visit to the camp oi Faisal. Two salient features of present military situation in Hedjaz are:- (1) Kabegh position if strongly attacked by Turks would not be tenable even with nfival assistance unless; (a) At least a brigade of regular troops with artillery could arrive there in tire; or (b) A trained Arab force of about 5,000 men with artil- lery was available for defence. (a) is ruled out by War Office decision that troops are not available. For (b) see under 'Arab trained Band'. (2) Necessity for keeping most important group of Arab tribesmen (viz those hitherto operating under Emir Faisal) in the field. Emphasis must be laid on fact that during the past five months' this group of 3,000 tribesmen operating in the hills on a line Kheif-Shofia Ghayir, with their base at HP mra and Sir Ibn Hassani, has constituted sole Arab defence againstagainst a Turkish advance South. In all the circumstances and with full concurrence of Admiral Conmander~in~Chiof from point of view of his (naval) responsibility I therefore propose to supply to tribal army now at Kheif etc the moral and material support (aeroplanes guns machine guns) necessary to enable them to continue their defensive in the hills and their attempts on Redjaz railway* If they succeed in this, time will be given for development of action proposed under following headings: Rabegh. This will be the training ground for the new Arab trained bands, a naval base for (group unde cypher able) Arab Military Forces and (British)Aeroplane Station. Fren ch co ntinge nt* This contingent will proceed direct to Rabegh where its training (see my telegram No. 6h7) cam be completed. Acting on spirit of instructions of your telegram No. 4 I will now convey the orders to this effect to Colonel Bremond. Arab tr ained bends^ . The necessity for a trained and organised Arab force either to garrison Rabegh or to provide a stable element with armed tribesmen in the field is (2 groups undecypher- able) apparento For trained bands the Sharif has col lected a promising contingent of villagers and townsmen, but rapidity with which force can be made efficient depends on whether a nucleus of partially trained men can be provided at once. It is on this account that I havehave requested Government oi India to send as soon as possible such i proportion oi ureb military (Tprisoners) now in India as is fit for active service. If, as Arab officers from India confidently expect, a good percentage of these ex-prisoners will join Biierif, the problem of trained bands will (be) simplified, a total strength of 5,000 is aimed at. There remains the question of equipment of this force in which Sir a. Murray will s.ssist as far as his resources permit. Such requirements as hgypt and Soudan cannot supply must be sent from England and I will communicate with the War Office on the subject as soon as I receive exaet information. Bri nish .fdlinary fd®Pipn.^ The necessity for presence at habegh of a small expert military staff to superintend the organisation of Arab trained bands and to advise on and appreciate military situation is very urgent. Colonel Newcombe, ail Artillery officer and an engineer officer should be sent as soon as possible (sec recommendation 5 in my telegram lip. 527 of October 24th). If possible Colonel Newcombe 1 s assistants should have previous experience of Arabs. I should be glad of Your Lordship’s confirmation of the course of action detailed aoove as soon as poooicle.

No# 31. Your telegram No. 18 of November 20th* Commander-In-Chief Egypt has now telegraphed to me full test of Captain Lawrence's report despatched to London November 17th. Following are my answers to Your Lordship’s questions. 1. I concur generally in Lawrence's views Which are those he expressed at Meeting held in k*hartpum when Admiral Wemyss was also present. But when I put to him the contingency of an advance in force on Rabegh by Turks and the possibility of arresting this advance by a brigade of British or French troops summoned there on urgent appeal of Shereef, I under stood him to agree that in such an emergency, the Arabs would welcome this help, and, in spite oi their religious objections , would cling to this hope of success rather than acquiesce in certain defeat which failure to hold Rabegh would mean. Colonel Wilson and colonel Parker who are on the spot, who have had much war experience and whose knowledge of Aracs is considerable, proposed the emergency measures which I advocated in my telegram No. 757 of November 12th to Chief of Imperial General Staff London, and they are of .. 'Tr 1of opinion that, ftaoegh. could and should be held if a Turkish advance in force takes place. I*concur in reason Lawrence gives for Colonel Bremen! 1 s attitude, he has just returned from Ralegh and is of opinion that six French battalions and four batteries would be required for defence of the place. 2. Shereef would prefer British to French troops, but if former are not available, (?he would gladly) accept offer of latter in great emergency foreshadow ed. Such is what occurred when previous scare of an advance took place and when he was told definitely that British vessel would not be landed in Kedjaz, but that he was free to accept any assistance proffered by French. I consider we should not be justified in advising him to refuse French assistance should a similar emergency again arise. When Shereef begged for help h&amp; was well aware that Christian officers and personnel must accompany troops and he has no objection to their presence at the Coast towns, but he would rightly object - on grounds Lawrence so clearly indi cates - to their march inland. It is on this under standing that all our plans are based for training Shererf 1 s levies and I still hope that French will be induced to send from Suez to Rabegh their batteries and machine guns which are so urgently required by Ekrirs Faisal All and Abdnlla when training of Arab personnel is completed^ 5. If French infantry can be spared to meet emergency of a Turkish advance on Rabegh, which may or may not occur, I would certainly recommend their despatch ' *despatch tc Suez and retention there unaer call of bhereef; hut if their presence in other theatres of operations makes this impossible, I would still urge that their guns and machine guns be sent to Rabegh from whence French personnel could be removed if, on advance of enemy, it is decided to evacute the place. 4., I fully understand objections to landing British troops in Hedjaz both on account of Indian susceptibilities and in view of importance of operat ions against Hedjaz Railway which Sir A. Murray is initiating from Sinai. For these reasons and those alluded to in paragraph 2, I recommend despatch of French troops in an emergency as I am of opinion them they might avert complete collapse of Shereef's move ment, which I understand to be the main ooject of Hie Maj e sty's Gov ernment./ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless Following in sunrnary of recent news:- Mlll t ry.

I have had private letters from Colonel Wilson and have also had an opportunity of discussing Hedjaz situation with an influential and intelligent native of the Soudan who was sent to Mecca as a delegate by Sir Said All el Murghani. X gather from both the above sources of information that one of the Shereef's principal objects in declaring himself independent King was to counteract propaganda sedulously intro duced by C.U.P. .leaders that Shereef had practically sold Hedjaz to the British and that he was nothing more than the dupe of the British G-ov^mment# Shereef admitted privately that this information was to some extent credited by some of his own loyal \ tribes. .

In this connection I have gathered the impression that our views and those of the Pranch are slightly divergent on one pc into Y/e should welcome the cap ture of Medina by Shereef whereas the French, in view of their future Syrian policy, seem to regard with some alarm the great acquisition to its strength which Shereef 1 s cause would immediately octain by active support of all Arab tribes in the Syrian hinterland who have sworn to rise in Shereef*s favour | immediately Medina is in his hands. 3*3. The poltrjy v/e have now ejc^^d of assisting Sheroef with v/ar stores, suppliesA^^raoney, instructs 6rn to train his levies, air ship , is qurte sound and is having an excellent effect - the presence of Christian technical staff etc seems to he under stood and is warmly welcomed. Even the most fanatic al of the shereefts adherents realises that it is only hy such means they can fight against well aimed Turkish regulars with any chance of success. 4* None of the above facts has been absent from my mind when making my recommendations on the policy to be adopted, nor have Lawrence 1 s views modified the carefully considered plans elaborated in my telegram No. 9 of November 7th to your Lordship, which was drafted and concurred in by both Lawrence and Admiral Wemyss when they discussed matters with me in Khartoum. 5* To avoid any misunderstanding I will again repeat these views as briefly as possible. (a) It is of vital importance to British Empire and to the Allies that Shoreef's cause should not be allowed to fail. (b) The military and naval action and support given to the Shereef hitherto have had the effect of considerably consolidating his position. (c) The present policy of not landing any large bodies of Christian troops, English or French, at Eabegh is sound; but mere mobile artillery is required. This the French can supply but their local represen- tative Colonel Bremond, is opposed to sending them to KabeghRabogh withcnrfr an infantry supporting force of practically a brigade, (d) The strategical importance of holding Ralegh and making it an organizing base for Sheree^s trained bands is obvious and already some progress on these lines is being made; but the impossibility of holding it without the support of a British or French . brigade, in face of a determined advance of lurks,- is admitted, (e) It is hoped that activity now going on at Rabegh, the presence of war ships and airships, and the exaggerated reports which these steps will givo rise to, may have the effect of delaying, if not actually preventing an advance in force of the enemy- already hampered by transport and supply difficultioo - and thus giving more time to Shereef to organize his forces and undertake that independent action against Turks which is so desirable, whilst more time would also be given to Sir a* Murray to organize his offensive from Sinai which will be of the greatest value to Shereef 1 s movement as a direct menace against Hedjaz railway* (f) If however the Turks can succeed in advancing South from Medina with a view to re-capturing the Holy places, we should in my opinion oppose that advance by throwing British or French troops into Rabegh; but in view of my remarks in the early part of this telegram, it is clearly desirable we should delay such action as long as we possibly can* This maymay make us too late and it is for that reason that I proposed that arrangements should ho made for with drawal on hoard steamers of European and Egyptian personnel now there. If on the other hard our airships and intelligenco clearly Indicate that an advan.ee in forco is intended, then I think every effort should ho made to stop it. in recent scare when Turkish troops were said to have reached Sir Ihn el Hussein, Shereef implored our assistance and Pegged for British troops to he landed at Rahegbo In face of the defeat which threatened him, he threw religious scruplo to the winds and undoubtedly a similar situation will arise should a serious advance take place and should his own pr paratlone to resist It be not eumelmtly advanced to give Won some reasonable hopo of succoss. (g) For above reasons 1 again repeat my care fully considered opinion that neither British nor French brigades should he sent to RahegH until true facts of enemy's situation and intentions are clearer, hut that preparations for an emergency should he majl®* , « I fully understand and sympathise with v Sir Wo Robertson and Sir Ac Murray that it seriously interfere with latter's Sinai plans to detach from his already depleted forces the troops ^ required for an emergency which may or which may no. arise, in Hedjaz and therefore, if it is possible for French infantry force recorrmended by Colonel Rremcna to he collected at Sues and kept there pending develop. ments, it would simplify the situation and would alsosatisfy the Shereef who was allowed to accept offer of French assistance at the time His Majesty’s Govern ment had definitely decided not to allow any British troops to he landed in Hedjaz* If,for political or military reasons, this plan is not feasible and if the French Government will not allow their artillery and machine gun units now at Suez to proceed to Babegh without the infantry support Bremend insists upon then I must carry on as best I can on the present lines but I would ask to be absolved from responsibil ity if, owing to emergency preparations being impossibl Shereef’s movement should unfortunately collapse^ May I suggest to Your Lordship to show this tele gram to Sir YM Robertson? Since drafting the above I have received full text of Lawrence’s telegram despatched to London November 17th and telegraphed to me to-day by Commander in-Chi of Egyptc I see no reason to alter the views I have now expressed to Your Lordship*[This Document to the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government^ and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official ase.l Your telegram No. IB of November 20th* Commander-In-Chief Egypt has now telegraphed to me full text of Captain Lawrence*e report despatched to London November 17th* Following are my answers to Your Lordship’s questions* 1* I concur generally in Lawrence^ views which, are those he expressed at Meeting held in Khartpom | when Admiral V/emyss was also present* But when I put to him the contingency of an advance in force on Rabegh by Turks and the possibility of arresting this advance by a brigade of British or French troops summoned there on urgent appeal of Shereef, I under stood him to agree that in such an emergency, the Arabs would welcome this help, and, in spite oi their religious objections , would cling to this hope of success rather than acquiesce in certain defeat which failure to hold Rabegh would mean* Colonel Wilson and Colonel Parker who are on the spot, who have had^ much war experience and whose knowledge of Aracs is considerable, proposed the emergency measures wnicn I advocated in my telegram No. 757 of November 12th to Chief of Imperial General Staff London, and they are S^Py to Ik.; .

I- concur in reason Laurence gives lor Colonel Br&amp;nond 1 s attitude, has just returned frori Rategn and is of opinion that six French battalions and four batteries would be required for defence ox the place. 2. shereef would prefer British to French orocps, but if former are not available, (ihe would gladly) accept offer of latter in great emergency foreshadow- ^1. such is what occurred when previous scare of an advance took place and when he was told definitely that British vessel would not be landed in liedj&amp;z, but that he was free to accept any assistance pro^-ered by French. I consider we should not be justified in advising him to refuse French assistance should a similar emergency again arise. When Shereef begged for help ba was well aware that Christian officers and personnel must accompany troops and he has no objection to their presence at the Coast towns, but he would rightly object - on grounds Lawrence so clearly indi cates - to their march inland. It is on this under- standing that all our plans are based 'or training Sherecf's levies and I still hope that French will be induced to send from Suez to Rabegh their batteries and machine guns which are so urgently required by Unit’s Faisal Ali and Abdulla when tisining of Arab personnel is comp' 1 etedo 5. If French infantry can be spared to meet emergency of a Turkish advance on Rabegh, which may or may not occur, I would certainly recommend their despatchdespatch to Suez and retention there under call oi Bhereef; hut if their presence in other theatres of operations makes this impossible, I would still urge that their guns and machine guns he sent to Rabegh from whence French personnel could ce removed if, on advance of enemy, it is decided to evacute the place. 4* I fully understand objections to landing British troops in Hedjaz both on account of Indian susceptibilities and in view of importance of operat ions against Hedjaz Railway which Sir A. Murray is initiating from Sinai. For these reasons and those alluded to in paragraph 2, I recaranend despatch of French troops in an emergency as I am of opinion tnc- they might avert complete collapse of Shereef's move ment, which I understand to be the main oeject of his Ma j e sty' s Gov ernrnent.[This Document is the Property of Hia Britannic Majesty^ Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] i &gt;v EGYPT.

It la reported that there Is no nickness among the Pilgrima. PR g'CH 'If. LjH . Colonel PrSmond Inforred me recently t that a large building had been bought in I1BD0A by the French Government which would be uneri for housing the French Pilgrims in future years. The relations between Colonel hrfeiond and myoelf are all that I could desire. He ie most anxious to Ingratiate himself with the Authorities here, hence his ordering the Cholera and ’lague Penas by telegraph which I understand somewhat annoyed the gherlfJ he recently infoned me that he proposed telegraphing fur a French Engineer and isoistant, also the necessary Funds to get the old Condenser into working order and run it. I Idfor ed hii that I had already consulted the gherif on the subject and that for this season the one Condenses was considered sufficient; he at once agreed to leave the matter alone.v ith reference to Your xcelloncy’ti tolegreir. *0.1619 of 9th jetobor re french asBietance to be given the fberif, I r.ttech a copy of the telethon* note I sent the : fierif, who, the mam morning, sent ne a reply to the following effect by telephone* He expreefed his entire agreement with the advice given by Your fxcellency and said he had told the Hoad of the fission t &lt;uhl was pre- senti that when he was in need of any help he would ask for some 'June, bat would not a eh for anything at present, he also expressed his warn thanks for the offer. The She- rlf went as to tell me that he always preferred to aek the •Jritir.h and not the french Government for all Ms re quirements and that he himself never wanted the french ill bb ion to cone, but, since trance was our Ally,he had done all he could in their Honour at my request but would mch prefer that no one helped hlE except the Bri tish Govern 1 lent. This convercation took place before the Sherif was Infomad by the llsslon that trench troops r left ALOIOS and were on their way. HUSCKIH tTJHX informs me that jMtt&amp;'PJiJM is very friendly with the drench isBlon and that he has an Agent who sleeps outside the Mission tent who heard RIDA tell the french that everybody In Egypt loathes the British and haw overjoyed the tlyrlans were at the French’Joining the /U'ab iovemont as their Friend etc. RUHI also reports that HIDA Ivas been secret^ly distributing pamphlets in i ecca which are said to be very fanatical and calculated to Inflame loslems againet Christians; th»t he in working against the British in-I have Instructed RUHI to obtain a copy oi the Pam phlet if possible. Jeddah Tom. I ajar THaiGCffi D.S.O., is going thoroufshly into the questions of Quarantine and sanitary 'mtters and his advice will be very valuable to rat* There is a world of intrigue going on in the Town and both IJUSAID iJffendi - the Director of iiiblic Securi ty - and Doctor mLOUF, have told me privately that they do not think they can carry on much longer under existing conditions with Sberif iiOHSKN iBW at the head of affairs. I get on very well with the latter and like him, but he is an entirely unsuitable person to be Governor of JKCDAH and imponslbla ar, such after the war. He has I understand absolute influence over the HA'lB Tribe and It would not fee easy or Indeed advisable for the rherif to remove him at present. one matter which I may come to loggerheads with him over and which is a very delicate one is the subjects of the slaves. Slaves are, I have good reason to think being soldln Jeddah frequently and one or two Takrurls have already taken refuge in my house. The line I propose to follow is^that, if I f|®X ^ly fr0Pi the Slave’s story he/was kidnapped tarn the Sudan during the last two years or no, I do not propose to ,iive him or her up; even this will almost certainly lead to trou ble with Sherif MOHSKN and i should be glad to know if the above proposal meets with Your excellency’s approval This if always a very difficult question and I am con vinced that if I took in every Slave who ran away to m house4- BWV« houee, I should to# Inundated with ..lavas fro;;, all parts of the country. .. r. vj' t . in view of the French Military Mission being here und likely to rer?iain indefinitely, X strongly reco twnd that both hr.

I do not make this recormendation with the idea of turning the'mgrlm Officer’s Mission ’ into a tilitary onebiit I do consider the present situation somewhat ur.satif;factory and the granting of CosnisBions to these two Gentlemen would. In ny opinioia tend to greatly impro ve matters. The two Indian officers returned from MhJCCA to day and are immensely pleased with the treatment they received at the hands of the Sherif and with everything in general.

EX. a;Y?Tl A&amp; Site reference to Your xcelloncy’s telegram No.1619 in which you state that ex Egyptian Officers se lected by FA:UJKI have been refused by the Bherlf and therefore the impression is given that the Cherif is adequately provided for in the matter of trained In structors. I had a tall: with Sherif on the subject and what he objects to and on no account will accept are Officers or anyone else selected by FAKUKI» but he would warmly welcome any Egyptian officer reeoranended by the Lirdar; if there are any still desirous of volun teering I would suggest that their names be sent to the the Sirdar who knows exactly xfcx* type of Officer who would be suitable for the work. mnEaH. I attach a copy of a note I addressed to the Cherif by telephone which was taken down by HtJCSEIN KUH1 which explains Itself. I hone that now there will be no more trouble which I am inclined to think arises from the fact which is known that the Turks have offered a reward for every British officer killed.imiKISK ■ The following Is the present number given for passage in H.M.S.

After salaams etc. The captain of the ?ox arrived last night afcd tells me that there is still a lot of trouble about ilritish officers going over the ground in the neighbourhood of Rabegh. I wrote to Your Highness on 1st October on this subject and Your Highness said you were sending orders to All Bey hat British officers were uo be allowed to go where they wished for purposes of arranging about the defence. Now I must make It quite clear to Your Highness that such orders must be sent to All Bey which will prevent any trouble in future. it is absolutely necessary for these officers to go over the ground and if Lhey are not allowed to do so, how can I ask for British troops to be landed if requested by All Bey. It is impossible. I ?mist therefore ask Your Highness to make it quite clear to Ali Bey that Colonel I arker and the offiwre must land when they like and that a guard should oe sent with them. colonel barker was (Governor of Ginai and is an otfi« cer of great experience with Arabs. Your Highness in a telephone message yesterday asked that the officers should not go further than the places Ali 'iey fiTed or them. Colonel Parker must ride to the front of the defences in order to see the ground andand if our MghneBB does not wish, 1 rmst decline any resjonsibility. ’ e are trying to help the Arab cause and I cannot understand the reason of all this bother Detween friends, hat is it ? I regret bothering Your Highness when you are a so busy but in® raauter must be settled once and for all. ilson i asha. NOTB. Abdulla Bey who read the above as it was being taken down by &gt;fuhi replied that he entirely agreed with all I said and after seeirng Aherif he informed hat Bherif had instructed him to send orders to Ali Bey that fe he must provide proper guards for Colonel marker and ohatfc they can go anywhere* within gunfire range oeyond lie Arab position* C. uilltfery flltustlon e_te &gt; I attcch her«with &amp; translation of the cipher aooo* age referred to in ay telegrea ^o.304 of to&lt;Uy.

I began by asking Abdulla if the Sherif in hie ci her telegram meant that the British troops vert to be sent to fabegh at once, to which Abdulla replied •Yes' 1 * l told him that in this case the herif ehoald at once write and «eal a clear request to me for Brit ish troops to be sent which Kuhi Affendi would read to me and send by special messenger* Abdulla replied that he *ould ask hie father and I begged him to aak the Sherif to make up hie miudd once for all a« uis jeci^ion Kust be final, it being impossible &lt;or h » to change his requests every day. AfterAfter an interval Abdulla gaid tnat h«} had con- guitdd the Sherif and wiahed to «ay that the urgency for trained troop# to be at Rabegh aroec from the plan of operation# they had made, vie, that Abdulla Bey waa to advance along the Eastern Pilgrim road and threaten itdina fro that iside. All Bey wae to go up the line of the Sultani Road while Faisal Bey attacked from the Korth Tut question of safeguarding Rab*gh thu# sriaea and the trained troop# are asked for to occupy the place and free Ali Bey's force. The Sherif asked for Egyptian troops? to be sent **t ohce. I re lied t at I could hold cut no rope that any were available. Abdulla Bey then asked whether Mos lem Troop# could not be brought from iSast Africa being replaced by British troop# from Trance. I info med him that even if possible the length of time involved made the proposal valueless; he next sold that Indian koslem troops could be brought from Bombay in 12 dfiye and why could not the$ be brought? I replied that alarge number of Indian troops were in Mesopotamia and that even if other troops fro i India vere available, which I doubted, it would probably be nearer e nonth thin 12 diys before they could arrive. Abdulla went on to say that both he and the Sh trif were most anxious to know whether a British force was under order# to leave Sue# at once if required as he had previ^Uffly requested, and they asked mw to giwe them an sspup ranee tnat a T ritish force, considered adequ&amp;te to successfully defend Rabegh, would arrive at Rabegh in four days fro the day such a force was ask-d for by Ali Bey, and guarantee the safety of Fa- begh. I replied that 1 was Pnable to give such assur- i-.nce or6 / -3 a» ur^nce or guar^nt*© but,at herlf** request, tola hitu that I would telegraph to Your Excellency (»y 3^ of 13th October), Abdulla Ley next el ad that he could not learn from the rench Ei* ion the strength of the Infantry included in the force fromAlgiere (mentioned in my tel egram 302 of 13th October) but if the Britieh author- itie* coneidered it was strong enough to hold Habegh against a Turkish attack then the ~herif would like it sent in preference to the British force so as to avoid the religious question. I asked whether, in the event of the irench force fcein sent to Rabegh, it rafcld t ke part in the opera tions against Medina; Abdulla replied *flo; certainly not', that they would be used purely for gartison pur poses at laoegh until the fall of edina when it would be sent ba-ck to Suez, he pleased if the rench force came, and would I not prefer thet a - ritish force rrere sent. I replied that all I was concerned with was that the ^herif’s forces should defeat the Turks and capture Medina, t if the -netif considered military assistance in th shape of troops was absolutely necsesriry it was a matter for the Sherif 0 decide vhat troops ere asked for. Abdulla then asked why was GreAt Britain fight ing for and helping Belgium and France; was it not be cause they were Allies? The Arabs are now also allies of ^reat Britain and therefore sh&lt; must fight for them aan well and every effort should be made to send Brit ish Moslem troops to assist. Abdulla ashed me whether I personally would -*44 Britain had given a very great WiO'int of aeeistance to the ^herif already and would continue to giwe all as 1 stance possible, Thi* Abdulla, on behalf of the Sherif, warmly acknorledged, and after the usual com* plisenta ha convereAAion terminated. It is extraordinarily difficult, in fact prac tically impossible, to correctly guage the existing military situation at any given date. At the moment Faisal Bey appears to haws met with some success and is pushing the Turks opposed to him hack along the Sulfcani road. I think it probable that the enemy force is either a reconnaissance force or is sent with the intention of drawing Faisal on with the hope of b*in ; able to suddenly attack him with greatly superior forces and inflict a crushing defeat. I personally do not con sider that Faisal will allow himself to be caught in such % trap. 1 suggested (vide my telegram 304 of today) that if the French force the Fherif talks about is available - and is of sufficient strength to be able to success fully defend Rabegh if attacked - it be sent now to tf at Fort. I have not asked Colonel Bremond abattthis force as I do not think it advisable for him to know that Mdlhf/fflt&amp;l everything of importance t e Head of the French Moslem Mission tells the Fherif or Abdulla is passed on to j/^y telephone . no t On the other hand if suoh a French force ie/avail able 1 recommend that the Brigade be kept in read iness to leave at shortest ooe-ible notice, ^ould it be possible please for a Brigade to be landed at Ra- begh four[ This Doenaient is the Property of Hta Britannie Majesty 'i GoTernmost, and should tie returned to tile Foreign Office when done with unle»8 required tor uitieial ase.j FRi\NCE Decypher.

This object will be met by the proposals in your No.9 which is concurred in. The immediate necessities appear to be trained gunners for artillery, machine gunners, engineers and infantry instructors. Reports which we receive show that much of tne material which we are supplying is being 1 wasted, particularly machine guns, owing to ignor ance. as regards machine guns and mountain guns it might be possible to provide some trained Indian Mahommedan personnel, but support of this nature should be based on a comprehensive scheme submitted by you. With the resources in Mahommedan personnel at our dis posal, even if the Soudan cannot assist, and with the assistance which the French have offered it should be possible to provide the Shereef with the backing he re quires.

This will be the training ground for the new Arab trained bands, a naval base for (group undecypherable) Arab Military Forces and (British)Aeroplane Station* Fren ch continrent. This contingent will proceed direct to Rabegh where its training (see my telegram No* 6^7) can be completed. Acting on spirit of instructions of your telegram No* 4 I will now convey the orders to this effect to Colonel Bremend« Arab tr ained bands* . The necessity for a trained and organised Arab force either to garrison Rabegh or to provide a stable element with armed tribesmen in the field is (2 groups undacypher- able) apparent* For trained bands the Sherif has col lected a promising contingent of villagers and townsmen, tut rapidity with which force can be made efficient depends on whether a nucleus of partially trained men can be provided at once. It is on this account that Ihave requested Government oi India to send as soon as possible such a proportion of Arab military (Tprisoners) now in India as is fit for active service. If, as Arab officers from India confidently expect, a good percentage of these ex-prisoners will join Sherif, the problem of trained bands will (be) simplified, a total strength of 5,000 is aimed at. There remains the question of equipment of this force in which Sir a. hurray will assist as far* as his resources permit. Such requirements as hgypt and Soudan cannot supply must be sent from England and I will communicate with the War Office on the subject as soon as I receive exact information.

I regret to have to report that scheme proposed by War Committee is not practicable. We find greatest difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of recruits to keep oxisting Soudanese units up to establishment and the only means of rapidly increasing this supply would be to adopt conscription. General demeanour of Soudanese is satisfactory and loyalty of majority of their leaders is quite genuine, but in a country that has so recently been regained from a state of barbarism it is not surprising that bulk of population is still wild independent and distrustful of any innovation. The Press gang measures of compulsion which would be necessary to enforce conscription would inevitably arouse bitter recollections in the minds of the older natives and fear and resentment in the young generation. Their effect would be liable to excite hostility to British Government and to arouse spirit of fanaticism whi;his innate in ths Soudanese and which veil ?ht well necessitate an increase in present British garrison (one garrison regiment and a company of Royal Garrison Artillery) of Soudan.

In the meantime Shereef and his military leaders beg for prompt military assistance and above all for guns and (technical) personnel to support their Arab levies and to enable them to withstand threatened advance by Turks* I cannot send an other man or gun from the Soudan and I have urgently requested General Hurray if possible to send several Howitzers and a battery of field guns complete, excepting personnel which Arabs will supply, to habegbu As regards French contingent (of which one machine gun Company has arrived at Suez and remainder is expected to arrive there about November 15th) Colonel Bremond maintains his opinion that it should not pro ceed to Habegh unless it is decided to send there an Anglo-French force of minimum strength of six battalions with two mountain batteries and four field batteries* Colonel Wilson who is aware of His Majesty's Government’s decision not to despatch a brigade to Hedjaz recommends that French contingent from Suez ^ remain at habegh in case an emergency necessitates a rapid evacuation, and Colonel Bremond has informed Wilson that he has urged- his Government to present several batteries witnout personnel to the Shereef and has represented to them necessitynecessity for sending infantry supports with French contingent if landed at liabegh. From Bremend’s report I learn that French con tingent contains a number of recruits and will pro bably not be fit to go inland (without iita French personnel) until about December 15th« Bremond suggests it could then be best employed as a single group under command of Lieut, Colonel Cadi (a Moslem officer) to stiffen Arab force on the Eastern road. He states an Engineer Company if so ordered could prepare i'ield defences at&gt; Rabegh# To put Fcabegh in a state of defence and re-inforce Arabs there who in Colonel Parker's opinion are at pre sent quite incapable of defending it, is of first im portance, and if a serious advance by Turks can be held off for a month or two these measures should enable them to hold the place. In view however of last alarming reports I thought it necessary to suggest to Admiral Commanding-in-Chiex desirability of Naval concentration at habegh for dual purpose of giving encouragement to Arabs and (possibly) to TurkBthe impression that an expeditionary ^orce is about to land, This assembly of ships would also be able to secure evacuation of Egyptian Army troops now at he abegh in contingency of an immediate success- ful advance by Turks* x csn tako no further useful action pending a decision by His Majesty's Government and French Govern ment on recommendations made in my telegram No. and this telegram; and therefore I beg their decision may be corauunicated to me as soon as possible.

PaRIS October 26th 1916 My Lord, Z handed this afternoon to the official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs who deals with Moslem and Arab questions a short memorandum in the sense of your telegram No. 2389 of yesterday’s date urging that the French Government should lend the mountain batteries to the Shereef without their personnel and send them to Habegh. 1 read to him portions of Mr. Wilsons telegram No. 373 of October 22nd (Cairo telegram No. 929 of October 23) and asked whether it is really the case that the French Moslem artillery cannot be used without its Christian officers, as His Majesty's Government, after mature consideration, have come to the deciued conclusion that it would be very undesirable to send any Europeans to Rabegh. M. de Peretti confirmed what Colonel Bremond has said on this subject and declared that the one and only Moslem officer in the French service who can be regarded as really useful and reliable is the one who has already been lent to the Bhereef. He appeared to think that the decision of His Majesty' Government not to send any Europeans to Rabegh was based on a fear that the French Government desired to interfere Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.^-. Ac Ac Ac.Inteffere and take a leading part in the Arab State, and he gave me the most categorical assurances that they are absolutely innocent oi any such ambition. They are of course deeply interested in the question of the pilgrimages, and for that reason wish to keep on comparatively intimate terms with the Shereef, but now that the pilgrimages of this year are success fully concluded they are particularly anxious to avoid anything •hich could convey such an impression. I said that it was possible that one or two individuals Either in London or Egypt might have such a suspicion but that I was convinced, from the telegrams which I had seen, that His Bajesty‘s Government at all events, and, I thought, the principal authorities in Egypt were not troubled by this idea. In any ca.se 1 said that the question of sending Europeans into Arabia was certainly not connected with such suspic ions and had been decided on its merits in view of its probable effect on the future oi the Arab State. As an instance of the determination of the French Government to avoid anything which might be falsely construed, M. de Peretti told me that Colonel Bremond had urged the despatch to Habegh of one or two Senegalese battalions which he thought could be spared from Jibuti, and that M. Paul Gambon tod been instructed to inform Your Lordship that this would not be done for the reason stated above. K de Peretti then made the pergonal., suggestion to me^^,0 tbat these battalions which can no doubt be spared so soon as the Abyssinian troubles are settled (his latest news encourages him to think that that is very nearly the case already), could be sent to Egypt or the Soudan to replace Soudanese battalions which might be sent to Arabia, and he expressed his conviction that the French Government would gladly do this il asked by His Majesty's Government. Since writing the above, I have received a telephonic message from M. de peretti, v/hich 1 am reporting in my telegram No. 1107 of -oiay; to one effect that the Ministry of War states, in reply to my Memorandum, that the batteries in question will be sent as far as Suez with their personnel and officers and that, if His Majesty's Government so desire, $hey will be sent on to Habegh with their Moslem personnel only, leaving the officers at Suez; but the fact is enphasized that the Moslem artillerymen are newly and slightly trained and will be of v*ry little r~ use without their officers. M. de Peretti begged me to urge on Your Lordship as strongly as possible the enormous importance of preventing the Turks from retaking Mecca and of saving the Shereef from collapse. Th-r* were many people who considered that the possession of Mecca is of greater importance to the Turks than even the possession of Constantinople, and the French Govftrnrrwmt‘ ' A;' ‘ i r- ^ - _ - - &gt; Government regard the possible fall of the ShereeX, after the help and encouragement which we have given t&lt;A him, as an eventuality fraught with the gravest consequences in India, Egypt, Tunis, Algeria and Morocco.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to the Sirdar in the sense that he should place himself in communication with the Naval Commander-in-Chief, who had been instructed to give what naval protection he could at Eabegh ; that the WAr Committee had been given to understand from an earlier report that the Admiral considered that the Arabs could hold the place with naval assistance; that if this was not the case the Sirdar should send to Rabegh whatever British* Soudanese, or French military assistance might be immediately available. (6.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the French Government of the action taken as in (a), and should ask them to send whatever troops they have immediately available, irrespective of whether they are Christian or M ahommedan. fc.) The Admiralty should instruct the Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Station, to give all the naval protection which he can at Rabegh, and to concentrate there whatever ships and monitors he considers necessary. He should also he authorised to land a naval detachment, if he considers it desirable. 14. The War Committee approved of a proposal made by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in a Memorandum dated the 20th September, 1916, that the Sirdar should be authorised to laise and train, for future use, a force of Soudanese Moslems, to he paid and equipped at Imperial expense. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to draft a telegram for communication to the Sirdar by the loreign Office 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., November 3, 1916. (Initialled) H. H.

Peisal's Arabs greatly fear the Turkish aeroplanes ftaA ths Turkish artillery appears most formidable to them. The situation at Rabegh is not considered satisfactory, Aziz-el-^&amp;sri finds difficulty in getting his advice carried out or vor done, especially in regard to getting tribesmen to volunteer for the so-called regular force. On Oct. 21st Aziz-el-Masri handed in list of minimum requirements and furnished his plan for organising hiR force. First essential is mountain guns and there are quite a number of gunnery officers and men. It is suggested by Lawrence that the Portuguese be asked, if the English or Frenofc guns are not immediately available. At least 60 Lewis guns for mobile forces are also urgently required. Plan is to collect and organise regularforce of 5 # 0Q0 infantry to be put in uniforiQ and oomplataly equipped* Also 5 companies of camelry each 800 strong.

Situation at Rabegh and among Sherif’s forces is represented as unsatisfactory in later telegfam from Wilson* This state of m affairs is due largely to shortage of artillery and lack of organised preparations for the defence of Rabegh.

HEDJAZ. r \ 1916 Your telegram &lt;c4141 hs.o been received and instructions fully understood by me* Following are salient features of present military situation. On the ability of the Arab levies to prevent a Turkish advance from OIDINA on MECCA hangs the success of the Arab revolt. If the Turks reach Mecca, or succeed in bringing the Arabs to a decisive action and defeating them, Arab opposition will dissipate and Turks will again become paramount in the Hedjaz* The Turkish plans to recapture Mecca at all costs may be expected to mature a month hence when the improvement of the local water supplies gives them increased freedom of movement, and before Arab resistance is well organized and railway communication with Medina can be seriously threatened by operations of General MURRAY in SINAI. Arabs are 'temporarily 7 incapable, even if adequately equipped and organised, of acting on the defensive. Their leaders must consequently endeavour to maintain the (so-called) offensive against the Turks at Medina, and so to stimulate Arabs to raid railway and other Turkish lines of communication and to withhold transport animals and supplies of Turkish Amy. In order to support this offensive Arab leaders urgently require mountain guns and machine guns, and they will use RABEGH(Si) RABE® as the base whence fresh personnel can be trained and ° rSanlZed “ d War mterial collected for the needs of the various flying columns in the field. The defences of Rabegh must also be strengthened in order that this position can form a point d'appui to the Arabs, in case they should fail to withstand a Turkish advance in force by the SULTANI road. Colonel Wilson reports that situation as regards French contingent is as follows:- (1) Sherif has no objection to Christian personnel with the I contingent landing at Rabegh, but is opposed to its being sent j inland. uolone* PLeniond is opposed to landing present contingent au Rabegh without strong Infantry support, and considers that one employment of French Moslem personnel in the interior without French Christian officers and N.C.O’s would be most ^ undesirable as they have never been trained to act independently. It therefore remains for French Government to decide whether they will hand over their guns to the Arabs for service inland: or whether they will land at Rabegh the Contingent as at present constituted and keep it there for purely defensive purposes. In all the circumstances (military political and religious) I recommend as follows:- (1) That the French Moslem contingent be sent straight to Rabegh instead of being disembarked at Suez, and that the guns be either handed over there to the Sherif’s troops for service inland: or - if the French Government be averse to this action- that the contingent remain intact at Rabegh and that such additional French Moslem Infantry supports as Colonel Biemona maythink necessary be immediately telegraphed for. U) If however the French contingent and their guns i euaain at Rabegh. the Arabs will be deprived of the additional artillery which they require for operations inland. xne artillery tor these inland operations is now confined to the small Egyptian contingent which I supplied from here, and which consists of one Q.F. (4 gun) battery and 1 machine gun horse ?Artiilery Battery with escort of 2j&gt; Companies of ^gypwian Infantry, now at Rabeghj and 1 Q.F. (4 gun) battery and 2 Laxims with escort of 1 Company, now operating with Faisal*s force east of Yanbo. This being so, I strongly urge the despatch of 2 or 3 additional Q.F.batteries, without personnel (which Arabs can supply), to Rabegh for service inland; and, as I know these cannot be spared by General Murray, I advise that the French Government be asked to offer them to the Sherif. (3) The personnel of the French Mission will be invaluable for the training of the new Arab forces at Rabegh and for organising the defensive position there. The presence of the small Egyptian contingent (see above) will suffice for their protection pending the arrival of French infantry (if approved), but, in any case, they should remain at Rabegh to hand over to the Arab forces the additional Q.F.batteries. (4) As under above scheme the defence of Rabegh will be practically exclusively in French hands, no oc^ecuion would, I presume, be offered to their sending a Flight of aeroplanes there in place of the British Flight which was withdrawn before being landed for reasons quoted in my 493. (5) The despatch to Rabegh of a British Military Mission as recommended by the High Commissioner (see his telegram 871 October 10th to F.O.). This Mission to be directly under my ordersorders and to assist Colonel Wilson in dealing with military questions. If these recommendations are carried out the K j fence oi Rabegh will be a French responsibility. British '• 3 si stance in money, material and supplies will be continued the Egyptian Army contingent, which it is not possible to increase will remain entire at the disposal of Sherif for service wherever he may desire.
