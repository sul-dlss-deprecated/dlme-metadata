This has crossed ay deal-official letters Kes.162-8 and 163-S of the 19th January in which I have discussed aaengst other things the status of Kalat and the Gvadur-Kalat boundary. 3. Fell's allegation that Gwadur is uded for a 'black aarket and sauggling trade' are almost certainly true. It was so used throughout the war. Its use as such however is almost certainly to the benefit of the surrounding tribes and from what I know of thea they are aost unlikely ef their own accord to aake an attack on Gwadur. Fell's warning therefore can only be interpreted as a threat by the Khan of Kalat to eaulate the example the Pakistan authorities have given hla in Kashmir and occupy Gwadur by force if the Sultan refuses to cede it. 4. I think it unlikely in any case that the Khan will endeavour to implement his threst but if he were to do sc the Sultan would almost certainly appeal to us for help and would be aost resentful if we refused to give it, especially as unless some declaration to the contrary has been made in the meanwhile he cannot fail to regard Kalat as being within the British Commonwealth. 5. In view of our present and possible future commitments at Gwadur e.g. the installation of a wireless station c.f. ay demi- official letter No.2257-S dated the 30th Doceaber f 1947 f I think that as soon as the Sultan returns to Muscat we ought to inform hia that we have reason to believe that Kalat State may approach hla direct with a proposal for the sale of Gwadur and ask hi* what his attitude is likely to be in such circumstances. The Sultan will probably enquire what our views on the subject are, especially as, under the Agreement of 1891 printed as No.XVII at page 317 of Altchlson Vol.XI he cannot cede any part of his territory save to the British Government, and although I previously stressed the importance of our retaining seme kind of foot-hold in Gwadur, unless we are prepared to give him a guarantee against aggression 1 think we shall have to reply that the matter Is one which we are willing to leave entirely to hia to decide and that we have no strong views either way. 6. It is also for consideration whether we ought not to warn the Sultan that we have heard that the Khan is contemplating using force, without disclosing the source of our information, so as to give hi* a chance of asking arrangements for its protection e.g. by sending a detachment of the Muscat Infantry there as he has only about 20 armed Arab guards on the spot at present. The disadvant age of this is that the Sultan may at once say that he regards us as responsible for preventing any invasion from Kalat, which would plac us in an embarrassing position# On the whole 1 am inclined to say nothing to hia on the subject at present, the more so as I am doubt ful if the threat need be regarded very seriously. 7. 1 should be grateful for early instructions in order that the Political Agent may if necessary approach the 3ultan on the subject as soon as he retux-ns from Dhcfar at the end of February or beginning of March. 8.

The ^sp^retion^ cf ..awab Bai Khan Gichki further compli cate t..e Gw^dur auction and I should not be at all surprised if he were to make an attempt to reassert the independent or semi- independent position previously occupied by the Glchkl Nawabs vis-a-vis the Khan of Kalat. In any case the Nawab*s attitude makes it even more unlikely that the Khan would ue successful in raising the Mekran tribes for an attack on Gwadur. It is however possible that he might attempt to use the ISekran Levy Corps which is a well-trained force though as it is locally recruited it is doubtful where its allegiance would lie if the Nawab was opposed to the Khan's plans. 4. The latest information inclines me even more to suggest to the Sultan the desirability of stationing a detachment of the Muscat infantry at Gwadur. In the event of any kind of rebellion breaking out against the Khan in Mekran it is obviously desirable that some such force should be present in Gwadur if only to deal with refugees. Personally I consider it more likely that the Nawab will continue to intrigue secretly rather than resort to force, but it is as well to be prepared. 5. The Sultan is now expected back in Muscat about the middle of March and I am planning to visit him early in April and to go on from there to Gwadur to obtain first-hand impressions of the situation there. I hope I may be able to persuade the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf to arrange for me to do the tour in one of H.M's ships. 6.

CarmaoriY/eaJ.th Re; atLona Ufficx? on Kcgat &gt; 3 status The Klian of Kalat in the course of conversations in Delhi with Mr. Jinnah and the Crown epresentative before the transfer of power last August tried to get Lord Mount bat ten to agree to the publication of a statement declaring the recognition t&gt;y the Crown Representative of Kalat * s independent status. The Crown Representative replied that the advice which he had received on this point fraa his Political Adviser precluded this. This advice was based on the history of our relations with Kalat. The Treaties of 1854 and 18/6 do not lead to the inference that Kalat &gt;vaa an independent sovereign State and it has, in fact, alweys been regarded li^e any other Indian it ate. It figured as such in the Covernaent of India Act, 1935 (1st Schedule Part II) and ww have no doubt that, in law, Section 7(l)(b) of the Indian Independence Act, 194/ applies to our Treaties with it. Nevertheless at these aieetings in v^elhi, hr. Jinnah agreed, on behalf of the Pakistan Covernaent, to acbait salat's claLn to be {in independent Sovereign State. In doing so that G-overnment, we have been led to believe, had in mind the consideration that if Kalat is not an Indian State, the Treaties between the Crown and alat (including tnose dealing with the leases of ^uetta, etc.) would not lapse under the provisions of Section 7 of the Indian Independence Act. hut Mr. Jinnah* s action seemed to us of doubtful political wisdom and our subsequent infona&amp;tion indicates that the Pakistan Government regret their nasty recognition and are trying.to get out of it.Tha Political Resident, Persian §ulf, Bahrain, presents his compliments to The Political Agent, MUSCAT and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document (s).

I understand that question of Gwadur was not raised by Khan of Kalat with Governor-General during latter’s visit to ^ Baluchistan and that subject was only mentioned casually by one of Khan's officials to member of Governor-General's staff. Ministry of Foreign Affairs consider it very unlikely that either the Khan or Nawab Bai Khan Gichki would attempt to seize Gwadur by force, although the Khan would undoubtedly be glad to purchase it from the Sultan in the improbable event of the latter being • ^ willing to sell. 2 . I understand that cause of present dispute between the Gichki Nawab and the Khan is the former's reluctance to continue payment of half the revenues of Mekran to the Khan in return for the latter's protection against externil aggression and internal dissension. The Nawab apparently considers that the price paid for the Khan's protection is too high, particularly in view of Mekran's oil producing prospects. He is now in Karachi, bbt is J unlikely to receive any encouragement from the Pakistan Government pending Kalat's decision on accession. Should Kalat Assembly in forthcoming Session decide against acceding to the Dominion, it is conceivable that the Pakistan Government might then accept direct accession of both Las Bela and Keran, and also institute direct relations with the Gichki Nawab, whose territories lie between thes« States now under the Khan's suzerainty. But although Ministry of Foreign Affairs are cautious in expressing opinion as to result of Kalat Assembly's deliberations on accession issue, it seems probabl&lt; that decision will be in favour of acceding to Pakistan. GRAFFTEY SMITH. REPEAT No.l SAVING, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 'LB'D.O. No. C. 143 - 8/1 Political Agency, Muscat. 11th March 1948. Please refer to your telegram No. 207 dated the 6 th March 1948. 2. During a talk I had with the Sultan on March 10 th, I told him that we had reason to believe that Kalat State may approach him with a prooosal for the sale of Gwadur, and enquired what would be his reactions. He immediately replied that he would not view any such proposal with favour, and that in any case he was bound by treaty not to cede any part of his territories save to the British Government. He went on to say that he realised times were difficult and that it was not impossible that Kalat may even try to seize Gwadur by force. If so, he said, the world would know that Gwadur had been lost to him by force of arms and he would not greatly mind. Any question of a sale, however, involved his honour and that it was not compatible with his honour to dispose of the territories which had been handed down to him by his ancestors, in return for money. Although, he added, he would always be prepared to give consideration to any views expressed by His Majesty's Government, and should His Majesty's Government itself wish to take this territory on lease or otherwise, he would be very ready to listen to any proposals they may have to make. 3* In reply I said that up to the present I had merely been instructed to pass on to him the information which had come to His Majesty's Government's notice that the Khan may possibly approach him with a view to arranging a / sale The Honourable Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.'/ - 2 - sale, but that His fiajeety^ Government had not given me any indication of their views in the matter. Generally speaking I got the impression that the Sultan had already some idea that he was likely to be approached by the Khan and that if His lifejesty*s Government urged him to negotiate a sale, he would probably agree, if some formula could be found whereby the transaction would not appear too openly commercial, 4* Finally I said that I would report the result of our conversation to you and that I felt sure you would like to discuss the matter yourself when you visit Muscat at the beginning of April, In the meantime I stressed the necessity of ensuring that the Wall in Gwadur should not allow himself to be entangled in any political manoeuvring which may be going on between the Khan and the tfawab Bai Khan Gichki, He said that he would bear ray warning in mind but that he felt very unhappy about the position as the acting Wall recently sent there was without any experience and he had no other experienced, intelligent person whom he could send to relieve him.

The incident reported is not of great importance in itself but it raises the question of the manner in which disputes between Gwadur and Kalat State should be dealt with in future. I am in favour of leaving all such matters to be settled by direct discussion between local officials, whenever possible, but it is almost inevitable that disputes will arise which will have to be dealt with at a higher level. 3. I gather from the Indian newspapers that the Khan of Kalat has not yet decided to accede to Pakistan and I do not know how relations with the Kalat State are being conducted so far as His Majesty*s Government are concerned. I would suggest that in any case I might be permitted when necessary to correspond direct by demi-official letter with Dundas at Quetta ragafcdfcdg Kalat-Gwadur affairs, the correspondence being copied to the U.K. High Commissioner in Pakistan and if it is considered necessary to the Pakistan Ministry of Exter- nal Affairs and Commonwealth Relations.

The attention of the Kalat Government has 'been drawn to a radio Pakistan announcement that the Pakistan Government have accepted the accession of Kalat’s two feudatories, Las Bela and Kharan, and the district of Mekran. The Kalat Government.requests that these reports should be immediately and publicly denied. The action reported by the radio would be contrary to the Standstill agreement (groups corrupt) last July and recently reaffirmed in the United Kingdom House of Commons by Mr. Gordon Walker, Under Secretary for Commonwealth Relations. His Highness received a personal communication on behalf of Quaid - 1 - ^zam Jinnah stating that the relations between Kalat and Pakistan would now be negotiated between the last Governments. Formal approach to the Pakistan Government is under preparation and the Kalat Government would protest strongly against any action in anticipation of receipt of their first formal communication.

(E 9854/73/91) SECRET \ Dear Galloway, In his despatch No .6 (22/16) of 14th April, Hay asked us for instructions as to the advice he should offer the Sultan of Muscat, should the Pakistan Government in due course press for the sale of Gwadur, in view of its possible strategical value to us as a landing ground and flying-boat base for civil and Roy&amp;l Air Force aircraft. We have now received the views of the Chiefs of Staff to whom we referred this aspect of the problem. They are set out below 'The landing ground is of no practical use since it is small, derelict and covered with hummocks of drifting sand. There is a range of hills 1,300 feet high, four miles from the landing ground: this presents a serious obstruction to the approach into the prevailing wind*. A detailed ground survey is not considered worth while, since a preliminary visual and photographic reconnaissance indicates that the work necessary to make the landing ground suitable for long range transport aircraft would be extremely costly. As a flying-boat, Gwadur would be of use only in emergency; we have alternative bases on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf which are not likely to be denied to us. Under the circumstances, we would only wish to retain as an insurance the rights given to the Royal Air Force at Gwadur under the Civil Air Agreement of 1P46. If the Sultan of,Muscat is approached by the Government of Pakistan to negotiate the sale of Gwadur, we would not advise His Majesty’s Government to insist on their rights to the prejudice of the negotiations. We would not wish the Sultan to take the iniative for such a transfer? but if the Government of Pakistan asks the Sultan to sell Gwadur, we could not expect the slight^# interest the Royal Air Force has there to outweigh the obvious political and financial advantages that would accrue to the Sultan from the sale. We understand, however, that the hinterland possessed oil-bearing properties, and that there is therefore a long-term possibility that Gwadur may become an important port. This long-term possibility should be borne in mind in any negotiations concerning the future of Gwadur.' The civil aviation interest ip Gwadur is at present limited to its use as an emergency alighting area for flying- boats operating between Bahrain and Karachi. It is unlikely that flying-boats will be in use on this sector after 1961. The Ministry of Civil Aviation would therefore hope to continue to enjoy such rights as they now possess under the Civil Air Agreement should the sale or rendition of Gwadur to Pakistan take place before that date. Lt.Col. A.C.Galloway, CIE, OBE, Political Resident, BAHRAIN. The Commonwealth,2 /- The Commonwealth Relations Office, whom we also consulted, agree generally with the views of the Chiefs of Staff. They are, however, not altogether certain that the view is correct that Pakistan is unlikely in the next year or two to agitate for the cession of Gwadur. They think that the Government of Pakistan's suggestion that they should continue to run the Post and Telegraph service of Gwadur may possibly be a pointer to their interest in the early incorprration of this territory under Pakistan administration. As the Royal Air Force and immediate civil air interests are limited to obtaining a continuation of the facilities granted to His Majesty's Government under the present civil air agreement and to the long-term and rather doubtful possibility that Gwadur might become an imnortant oil port, we do not consider that we should insifct upon His Majesty's Government's fights under the agreement of 1891 to the prejudice of any approach which the Government of Pakistan might make to the Sultan for the sale or return of this territory. We however agree with the view of the Chiefs of Staff that the initiative in such negotiations should not come from the Sultan. In the meantime we should do our best to assist the Sultan to improve his administration in Gwadur /the whatever may be/eventual future of this Muscat Dependency. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Commonwealth Relations Office for the information of the United Kingdom High Commissioner at Karachi. Yours ever, (sgd) B.A.B.
