Last autumn Consul tried experiment of taking night guard off house but it had to oe put oack as Assistant Consul's room was broken into and articles stolen. These guard duties in addition to their excessive work in day time with letters and not infrequently escort duties away from Shiraz make it impossiole to lower strength as it is each man is - on guard every second or third day.

On receipt of the letter I telegraphed to Mr* Skrine drawing his attention to your telegram 83S-Est,B. of 21st June 1917 and enauiring his opinion as to the advisability of reducing the escort to six men. He has replied deprecating reduction as conditions have not changed since the matter was last decided. I concour and recommend that the new escort should be of the same strength and comoosition as the present one. The latest orders I appear to have on the subject of ammunition for the escort are those contained in Foreign Department letter No. 2306-Est.E. dated 12th August 1911 (a copy of which I am sending to Kerman) which lay down that relieving escorts should take with them 700 rounds per man.

Bill, Esquire, I.C.S. , deputy Political Pcsidenf in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIBE Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the term of three years service in Persia of the present Consular Escort in Kerman will expire on the afternoon of the 9th March 1919,the escort having embarked from India on 10th March 1516 for duty with S.P.H. from r *hich they were transferred to this Consulate from forenoon 1st August 1516. My present escort consists of; 1 Duffedar 1 Lance Duffedar 8 Sowars 1 Farrier 1 Salutri on Rs. 47 41 »&gt; '64 each 34 34 plus Rs. 7 Salutri allowance. all men from 39th (K.G.O) Central India Horse which regiment Is at nresent stationed at Guna Cantonment In India. I have the hcrcur therefore to request that arrangements may kindly he made for the relief escort, which should not how ever reach Bandar Ahhes before the first week of February 1918, as in winter all high passes are blocked by snow and travel ih( before the middle of February from Bandar Abbas to Kerman or J vice versa, would either be impossible or difficult. 2. The new escort should also consist of N. C. Os, sowsr?—— IK) farrier and Sslutri on the present scale and bring their own tents arms end amraunition. This Ccr.sulate has no reserve stc''k: - of ammunition at all (each member of the escort has 90 rounds , snly at present) and I would suggest that the opportunity be ucen to send up some spare ammunition with the relieving party: I understand it is customary to keep reserve stock of ammunition in all Consulates where musketry practice is also carried on. \s this Consulate records are not complete on this subject, I request that s copy of instruction in this connection may be sent to me at your convenience. 3. The relieving escort should not bring up any horses or saddlery with them. The present horses, which are all in good condition, with their saddlery will be retained here as they have already been bought over by the Foreign Department and any change would entail heavy and needless cost. The new men should how ever receive their free issue of clothing etc. for the'fi^st year before they leave India. The farrier should also bring his tools etc. with him from India and the Salutri a limited quantity~ of medicines. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, 3d/- 0. P. Skrine, I.C.
