Secondly if Government approved his negotiating direct, how far would it grant him and Salem a free hand. In other words if Salem were in the wrong and Bin Saud found it necessary to compel him to pay compensation by force, how far would Government interfere?

Oop y: to Q.P.E., Bushire. ) P.A., Kuwait* ) for information.Translation of a letter dated 15th Ramadhan 1358(=5rd June If20) from Abdul Aziz bin Hasan Qusaibi, Agent of Bin Saud in Bahrain to Major H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, After Compliments, I beg to inform you regarding the real news of the Mutair and Ibn Subah, Firstly regarding Qaryah (Garaiyat or Jariyah). This place is the 'dirah' and camping ground of the Dushan, (family of Faisal, al Dawaish) and the Mutair from old times, and now it is inhabited by part of the Mutair who formerly used to inhabit Al-Ratawijfcah but who left because of some local ill-ffceling among them. When Bin Saud entered Hasa recently the Mutair came and asked him to give them 'Qaryah', this he did; The place is not within the borders of Bin Subah, whose boundaries are known to ftart from Al-Sutaihiyah or even further northwards. After the Mutair encamped (under ibn Shqair) t at Qaryah, Bin Subah sent them a party on camels; but* without letters. This party said to Ibn Shaqair the headman,'leave at once or we will attack you.' Ibn Shaqair replied that Bin Subah was not lal his Chief but that Bin Saud was, and that he would refer the matter to him for orders. Bin Subah, on hearing this reply from the leader of his party was furious and declared war against the whole tribe^of Mutair,and definitely sent them a message as followsi 'You Mutair are my enemies He then issued a prohibition against the export of any grains or atki other commodities to Bin Saud's people, as you have already heard. Bin Subah next sent for his men and cousin Daij and told them to take action against the Mutair and march on to the people of Qaryah. Dai J apparently was the instigator ^nd planner of this move. t lext Dhaij marched off and encamj^d at Al-Wafra and again further advanced to Al-Jahal. From this place he proceeded to Naqair where he sent for the tribes of Al-Awazim, Al-Rishaidah and cetain of the Mutair who had long ago settled within the borders of Kuwait. When they arrived he ordered them to join his force as he intended ~ V attacking the settlers at Qaryah. To this they replied*we will ■ neither listen to you, nor obey you because we are Bin Saud's ■ sublftrjtn and the inhabitants of Qaryah are sub jests of Bin Saudand th©} have done no harm. Latar however they agreed to . maroh and startad southwards• When Bin Shaqair heard this news he at once sent for his kinsmen asking their help as he was afraid of Bin Subah for reasons that his women and ohildrexi were with him# He sent a message also to Bin Saud who wrote and k ordered him not to proceed North of Qaryah, and that should any one come and attack them at Qaryah they should resist by force of arms. The next move in the act was that Bin Suhah's forces camped at Hamdh about five hours distant from Qaryah and to the Southeast of it» From there Dhaij sent out a patrol which met a Mutair patrol from -taryah. There was a fight - The news having reached the respective Headquarter (DhaiJ and ibn Shqair) reinforcements were urgently called for. These coming up Joined battle with each other. We now know that Bin SubaJji was defeated although we do not know actfta^ly what were the casual ties on both sides. As regards the people of Mejd all wore sorry to hear the news,and extremely indignant to hear of tfie action of Bin Subah* They also infomned Bin Saud of this misdeed and ho replied telling them that the question did not concern them. Mow the Imam Abdul Aziz has written asking me to inform your Honour and to put two questions,^If Bin Subah is under the protection of the High British Qove'rnment, then the matter can be settled between him and Bin Subah through His Majesty's Government• If on the other hand Bin Subah is an independent ruler then he would like to deal direot with him. M The truth of the whole matter is that Bin Saud and the inhabitants of JHejd have nothing against Bin Subah and the people of Kuwait, on the contrary they have affection for them, and in like manner the people of Kuwait like Bin Saud and the inhabitants of Ifejd. Since however Salim Bin Subah became Shaikh ho has adopted a strangely contrary policy towards Bin \ ! i } v Saud which is not hidden from you. Bin Saud has been exercising patience for the sake of : | your Government no doutt all Government officials are aware v of this change of attitude• Bin Saud has urged mo to inform you of this affair for the61/6 GZ/7.

Mi^MUMi-iiiiDUM . Intelli^Qnoe ♦ (1) Re: Kuwait - Mutair Affair. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Ihalifah, o.I.E., informs me that FAISAL al Dawish has returned to QRAIXAT (Jariyah) from iejd. As a matter of fact Shaikh Abdullah reports that Faisal was met half way to Riadh by a messenger from Bin Baud upon which he returned; (2). On 10th June X asked Abdul Aaiz alQusaibi whether there was any possible chance of the Mutair acting against Jtuwait in pw spite of Bin Saud^ orders: He laughed at the suggestion and ,1' v^said such a contingency was impossible. The Mutair was one of ^ the most loyal of Bin Baud's tribes and would never move in face of definite orders now received from Bin Baud. They will however hang on to Qraiyat. (3)* Regarding Hail news: A good many rumours are going about regarding Bin Raschid having denounced the recently ratified treaty between himself and Bin Saud. I have not yet received anything worth making a definite report about, as everything one hears here is unreliable. The most common story is that Bin Easchid's family took offence at a recent order of Bin Baud in which the latter informed Bin Rasohid that their 'wejh' or 'tisyar' (official safe conduct) would not be recognized in Mejd; and as a result had determined to denounce the recently made treaty. (4). Mahomed al Saud brother of the Imam is reported to have taken a force to Qassim about 15 days ago. Another small force under Abdullah al Saud another brother is«• 3? is said to have moved up in the direction of Kuwait as a pre cautionary measure. The first report is confirmed by al QusaiMt; here who says Bin Saud's idea is to prevent the discontented Hail party from intriguing anywhere Qassim way, hence the demonstration. The second report Al Qusaibi says is untrue. (5). During the week I sent Bin Baud's two sons a small 'savage 1 * rifle a piece with 600 rounds of ammunition, also to Bin Jaloui Amir of Hassa a gold watch and to Ibn Shalhoob, Bin Saud's private secretary a gold watch.

After Gonpli::ionts I have already informed you: of the regret- ahle incident which recont^y took place owing to the high handed actions of Bin Subah, Huler of Koweit. Recently a uru deputation from Koweit with letters | arrived groa Riadh. ■ They have admitted their fault and confes sed that they were in the wrong. I have returned the deput ation with letters, copies of which I am forwarding enclosed herein, for perusal. My object is only to secure peace and tran quility in my territories an:, the neighbouring districts,most especially those parts which are under the protection of friends the British Government. I have also sent hack with the deputation one of the A1 Saud family, namely ITasir ibn Saud, and I .trust that any mistake or misunderstanding will be cleared up through his good offices and that relations ('between Koweit and ourselves) ,will return to their original condition as used to exist in the times of live predecessors of both of us. As regards my reference made to His Majesty's G-ovemment through your goodself, I have not received any reply up to the present moment. Such delay leads to a state of affairs which is not desirable and in my opinion might early result in developments of an undesirable and disturb ing nature. My fear is only due to my anxiety to conform with the wishes of His Majesty's G-overnlent, otherv/ise as far as my own subjects are concerned I can, by God's grace, keep them in control, and the wrong doer can be dealt with. More especially am I anxious about the Haj gues- tion as the time has drawn very near. If an answer is not re ceived by the middl® o -r th« . vm ™ , or the current month( Shamval),the Haj willwill hardly Ue possible owing to the length 01 the journey and the tirae req.uired for making the necessary preparauions in ti;ae to he ready for starting on the journey hy uhe 1st. of Zil-Qa'adah (18th July 1920). I, therefore, reaueau your honour kindly to make immediate'telegraphic reference uo High Authorities and inform me of the result.

They made this attack on them srhile they 'believed theiuselves saxe, as none could possioly have foreseen such a thing, and we were greatly surprised at it. We have always considered that the Al-Saud and Al-Suoah were one house 'by religion (dinan wa madhhahan) family and honour. We were much astonished at this occurrence and cannot imagine who could have incited Faisal ad-Buwaish and the Ikhwan to perpetrate this disgraceful act. Had we not 'been anxious to save the hlood of Mus lims and protect innocent uslim lives we would have taken effective action at the time. We kept patient however and exercised forethought as Buwaish and his followers arc your subjects * In view of the brotherhood and the long union whidi has 'been 'between us we are reporting the matter to you, as we feel confident that it will displease you even more than it did us if once you know the real fact of the case and are not deceived by untrue tales, for men of high position have attentive ears. What we hope from Tour Excellency is that you will order him to return the property and make restitution for the men for the sake of the honour of the two houses and families.

All these good remarks of yours are appreciated and 1 feel that I have an ohligation towards you towarte you and you have every right to expect all this from me # Thank God, there is not on® who can give me orders, and I am strong enough to enforce my orders with or without his (any hody f s) consent. I, your 'brother,would,however, like to explain to Tour Excellency certain matters. As to Ad-Duwaish's attack ; God knows that I did not order him to attack, nor did I wish it, especially the thing that happened. Of course, I knew of their (the Mutair f s) gathering { in Qaraiyah), and their taking defensive measures. When God ordained the incident in question I was, however, not sorry for reasons I shall now explain. X did, as a matter of fact, despatch messeng ers to stop them, hut they had already taken action. As regards my own feelings towards Koweit, its Ruler and people, I call God to witness that from the time I left Koweit till this moment, I have always meant well 'by them. This is known to God as well as to man. As to the rela tions of As-Saud and As-3ubah f I can only repeat what has(2) • ul iias T3««n said (COUPLET) *It affairs ar« taken in hand in the first place 'by wisemen,they have only good results; if they are in the hands of the wicked,then evil conse quences are 'brought on all concerned 11 . Oh son of Mubarak, I should never have 'believed or dream ed that any friction would have taken place 'between the As-Saud and the As-Subah. I cannot now fathom the causes You,however, should ask yourself what they are, in order that you may understand them clearly, or you should ask those of your class who know the causes well. As to your remarks that you left AdHDuwaish alone for my sake, I may say that this is what could 'be expected of you, I trust the time may never come for our forces to measure strength with each other. Also, may G-od keep you safe, you are well aware that if things are conoialed and facts are not stated , then ill- feeling is surely caused, ( The a'bove is sarcastic vein in original Arabic) It is now necessary that 'both sides should disclose facts. As regards myself, God knows that I had no knowledge of or connexion with this affair, which Qod has ordained, nor, as far as I am concerned, did I know of any outward or inward reason to cause same. On the other hand, since you 'became Buler of Koweit, God knows not a month has passed 'but I have experienced worry at your hands, although I gave no cause for smh a thing. Many were the reports, public property, that reached me 'but which I tried not to 'believe, while I may say that others of a more ohscure nature I positively refused to entertained. God knows how many these have 'been. However, certain definite events that have taken place from ♦BajaV onwards number five. Such could not have 'been 'brought about except 'by either a foolish man, or one determined on mischief. Of course, you are not a foolish man, 'but possess great wisdom (1) You daspatohed a mounted force to the people of Qaraiyah, without sending me a warning beforehand. (2) Nafisi came to me with a verbal message from you You(3) lou did not deign r^n to writ# a few lines. (3) You sent a party of the 'Mutair' and 'Ajman' (pro'Daisly meaning settlers of these trices In Koweit, who acted on 'behalf of Salim) who molested the inhahitants of qaraiyah. Xet you did not inform me in writing or hy massenger. (4) You issued a 'prohibition order' in Koweit stopping all exports to Bin Saud's { my) ports. (5) You seem to have forgotten that the Mutair were my suhj ects. Kindly inform me, May God save you ( Allah Yusal- limak)on these five points. What would have happened to those people who were put to serious trouble, if they had had none to protect them; hut they have hoth a protector and a ruler, and he is your brother ( myself). In this you did not treat them with a good policy; you said also that your action was in accordance with religion. You could not, if you think thus, know the good from the had. Such methods as yours can only result in trouble. My subjects suffered in three ways. They were put to (i) personal worry (2) uneasiness (3) They were brought to that state of and doubt which ended in inflaming their religious fanaticism to such an extent as to make them ready to turn on any one who provoked or interfered with them, I was myself extremely surprised to hear of this state of affairs and at first was in doubt as to the causes that led to them. Any one, naturally, would wonder what was at the back of these happenings'. (Irfhat are the real facts). Of a sudden (my irritate4)people found 'DaiJ• marching out against them, he even reached HAMDTH, and as this action came on top of the many upsetting happenings (above men tioned) they (naturally) believed that DaiJ had come out to attack them. Then followed what God had ordained as He hath said in the Holy Quran (quotation) 'You cannot form a plan or execute your intention unless God Himself wills it to be done'. You• (4) 4 You will, of course, understand that your unrriendly actions had gon® on pranriously for a long time, and every one, great and small, had felt the effect, and they could only 'be imputed to the covetousness of the doer in the absence of any conciliatory actions. This is th© whole reason why the harmful inc ident took place and you sufferred a loss* X see no way of bettering matters than for you to sign the accompanying document as a final settlement. If you have anything to 'bring forward which I donot know of, I shall h® glad to consider it. I may add that as you have verbally communicated through A1 Nafisi that the qaraiyah question be submitted to the British Ooverament, I say, by all means, let it be so, I shall know how to plead my cause, I wish to assure you that all I have said in the beginning of this letter is correct and true, and I am fully confident that in future we shall have no trouble with each other, and everything will be satisfactori ly arranged. M Our friends Abdullah As Suflait, and Abdul Assiz bin Hasan have delivered your message to me and I have explained to them all that was necessary. You may rest assured that I am gsuite willing to meet your wishes in every way, so may it please God. As regards restitution of camels and horses^ mrl dramodary I have sent out men to go round and collect them. As soon as the points the points at variance are settled, every thing will be available, both what belongs to you and out of our own property. I am sending with our friends (your deputation) my uncle Hasir bin Saud in the hope of gaining your good will as I am anxious to come to an agreement. May G-od put things right between us both and prosper Muslims, help His faith and make it glorious. USUAL STOING. %Translation of the suppliment to Bin Saud's letter dated 4th ohawwal 1338 (Slat June f 19£0) to Shaikh Salim As- Subah, Euler of JLoweit. After oompliments lou know that the affairs of this world depend upon two things, the first and highest being Shariyah, the second being perseverenoe and forethought, as the poet saysi- 'The most careful man is he who does not do anything until he has fully looked into the consequences of the intended action 1 * • You, of course, realiae that these unfortunate matters which have recently happened and the consequent disputes and struggles about boundaries and subjects have not been started by me at all. lou alone have been the cause though I hope now they are as good as settled and our minds are at peaoe. Let every one remain within his own boundaries, I say» I would, however, like first to explain to you all I have in mind, and you are best aware of what you have in your own mind^ I donot know if you have different ideas on the subject. lou know that from the day God created As-3aud and As- iubah, never have they said, 11 This is our boundary, these are our subjects'« The As-Subah confined themselves to toweit while the As-Saud looked after their own affairs,neither party having any doubt or difficulty. In the past when misfortune came upon Hejd it was split up into two parts, one going to the Turks and partly Ajman domination (Hassa) and the other under Bin Rashid. In those days any one who found himself pressed upon too hardly or tyriniz- ed over by any of these three took refuge in Koweit, because it was all one^Tarifah'(class)• Things went on in this way till Muhammad bin Subah died. After Mubarak had succeeded to the principality of Koweit I was at Koweit. He used to give 'Zakah 11 (pecuniary help)to those of lorthern and Southern Arabs who used to come down to him. They used to take refuge alternately with him, with Bin lashid and Turks. When I occupied Easaa your father was atllX paying ^600/- to the Turks in place of ther/ H ^akat' of Al-Awazim^ lour father used to take the Zakat from the Mutair^Subia and others, who used to oome down to him and we did not object owing to close friendship existing between us. lot long before the death of your father the *Mutautahah' and the ^Rashaidah 11 waited on me and I took Zakat from them# Had things gone on smoothly neither you nor I would have said even onoe in our lives 'This is my boundary, and these are my subjects'« You have yourself opened this question and have shown avarice against us your friends, coveting our tribsemen and boundaries, it is you who say'this is my possession'. I myself have no such ambition against you. I now ask, 'Oan you show me an any right or justification for your ambitious claims, which are directed against us, your own kith and kin. Had you had any Sharii (legal) justification, X should have submitted atonce. Or, if any part of the country had been taken by sword, then the deci sion of sword is inevitably obe^ed^ mt if it is, as it surely is, a question of 'Amanah' and MtSd^Afah' ( a trust and voluntary gift), then it rests with him who gives it,i.e. my-self, to take it back or to leave it ( in the hands of the trustee or the receiver of the gift). I now say that if you have any proof or argument you may bring it forward and I shall be the first to accept and respect the same and will not disregard it in the least• But if you have none, then I would beg jrou not to seek one vainly, firstly in order that you may at^o^d wrong-doing, and secondly for the sake of our friendship and alliance which you should value. If you have proof of your contention then take it (the disputed land) by all means, otherwise donot try to jump on things that are not yours and thereby creat hostilities and estrangements. lou, of course, know that you have to ave all your possessions ( on death). There is no doubt about this. If we go to a court or arbitration I am sure to win my case as I have best proofs in support of my claims, if otherwise, then I5^ am not going to accept or agree as that woul?i be Injuatioe which i is not liked by God or any wioe man of any nationality. low, Saiim, my brother, on my honour I beg of God and of you to settle up these matters and to give up these contentions which donut promise any immediate or future good to you# I call God tc* witness that I am not seeking any personal sain* I know too well that if X fought for wrong I shall certanly be the loser, and if i am driven to fight for my rights then by the grace of Qod I am sure to win* God knows l have no aim against the honour of loweit and its Muler and people and I wish yom all safety* If you agree to what is Just and sign this do cum) nt which is enclosed herein, I shall be indebted to you and shall try and win your good will in every respect* Ani I, on my part solemnly pledge myself to you tiut I shall maintain the same good relations with you as x had with your fat her and brother, and w© will jointly work for common good in all matters* If you refuse to seal this document* If you refuse to seal this document and agreement then I am absolved from responsibility.

I never mentioned the question of boundaries and subjects in my letter which I sent you at the hand of 'Abdullah as-Sumait and 'Abdul •Aziz al-Hasan as this is perfectly clear; my subjects are well known, and my frontier was fixed by the two Governments and I hold papers to prove it # I informed you through my envoys regarding the disgraceful deed which Dawish and his followers had done, and requested you that the ^halal 11 should be returned and restitution made for the men who had been unjustly killed, as I felt sure that, in view of our friendship and union, a deed like this would displease you even more than it did m®, and I am sorry to see that you oppose what I ask by putting forward these excuses and false tales, I am sure that the reason you resist the just claim which I have against you for what Dawish has done is that you have been listening to the lies of envious people who have been trying to cause ill will between us, Xou say that if I do not accept your terms and sign the paper, I must excuse you from making resti tution, My brother, I am surprised at your saying this, and can hardly believe it, as it is just what would please our enemies. The question of our subjects and boundaries is understood, and please G-od, I shall do nothing to harm or displease you, butdiflpl®as@ you, but bif shall guard our friendship and union* But I liave strong reasons to put forward regarding what Dawish and his followers hav© done, and I have done what was right towards you, and ay condition towards you i&amp; known, so there 1© no need for long explanations over suoh an unworthy event; as the proverb says M it is bad to think over the past M . Regarding the signing of the paper| I must ask you to think the matter over carefully, and X am sure you will see the right and benefit of remaining as we were in the past, I trust you will abandon the things which annoy me and please our enemies, and, please O-od, you will only see a good result which will pleas® you. With reference to Dawish, as I told wou before, I can not take action against him without letting you know, as he is of no importance, though, by the grace of Ck&gt;d, I could in every way. I have received the camels, riding camel and horse, which you sent with the envoys, and I trust that you will now order the return of the rest of the property, I hope you will not make any objection to this, as it is a thing for which X can not hold you excused, r 1 am sending you Mubarak bin Half HiXal with Uasir.

He accuses Salim of having given Political Agent Koweit an entirely wrong version of his letter dated 4th Shawal (June 21st), or if he actually produced the original it was altered. He requests original letter 'be called for and compared with the true copy already sent through Bahrain. He states Nasir,his ambassador, has returned. He is indignant at latters treatment by Salim whom he alleges instigated the people of Koweit to publicly insult him. Insult to ambassador was insult to himself. Nasir was practically imprisioned and prevented from paying official call on the Political Agent # also an insult. Salims reply to letter brought by Ssaixm Nasir, copy sent, refuses olive branch. Hence he Bin Sa'ud, has severed relations. If now H.M.Gr. consider its interests affected let it definitely fix boundaries between Nejd and Koweit.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of youi! cordial letter contents of which I have fully noted, especially the translation of the telegraphic &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;!;« message from the Hon'hle Sir Arnold Wilson K.C»I,E;iu| which he conveys to your friend his message regarding the question of the Sheikh of Kuwait and that in accordance with article six of the treaty concluded between me and H # B,M f s Government, I am under obli gation to adopt none hut a friendly course for the settlement of such disputes ,while In case of neces sity ,1 can always ask for the good offices and assistance of Government , should necessity arise. In reply, I heg to say, that I am pleased with this message, and I hasten to send the following reply which you will kindly after perusal take steps to forward to the aforesaid honourable gentle man * I have always tried my 'bast to give entire satisfaction firstly in my conversation with the representatives of my friends His Majesty's Govern ment ( nsnely his honour colonel Hamilton, their former Political Agent at Koweit, Mr. Philhy and finally in my statement in my letter of S^th bhaa- 'ban 1338 I.e. 14th May 1920, to Major Dickson) for the solution of &lt;3U ®stions and also as a precaution against any probable disputes and troubles. As regards Art. 6th of the Treaty 1 admit I a i j according under obligationTto it and I shall not deviate from it. I cannot alter the boundaries of Koweit but must let them remain as my forefathers did and this is the greatest proof in my favour with His Majesty Govt and the gr#ates&lt;fc proof against the Sheikh ofKuwait for his aggressions : Now that the necessity has arisen I would ask that whatever proof His Majestj Government or the Sheikh of Kuwait -have against me , th@y may 'bring it forward and X am prepared to answer, I have already informed you ahout existing condi tions, and I hav© sent you several letters on the matter, I have l©amt some news from Nasir 'bin Saud my representative who returned to m© yesterday from Kuwait which news proves that the Sheikh of Kuwait certainly changed some words in my original letter to or him and increased ©creased some &gt; he then sub mitted the letter to Political Agent,Kuwait. It is therefore necessary for your Honour to ask Political Agent,Kuwait for my letter in original,(which is in the same clerk f s handwriting who has now written out and sent you a true copy of Bin Subah♦s latest latter to me copy attached) # By comparing the two writings you will he ahle to see whether my original letter was altered or not I am myself certain the letter was altered 'but of course you know 'best. Secondly I sent my aforesaid cousin Nasir Bin Saud with ^in Suhah f s messengers in order to put out the fire,and gain the satisfaction of His Majesty*s G-oveminent. When Nasir arrived at Kuwait he witnessed certain things which were most impoper and unfair and which I dislike to make a mention of;'because of the serious insult which resulted . All the notables of Kuwait used abusive language openly f mentioning my name in coffee shops where the Sheikh of Kuwait spread out false rumours in the presence of my cousin,and my servants and collected men to fire JQiots in the air and to make an exhibition of joy pretending that Bin Rashid had defeated me and killed me ,and thus great disrespect and insult was showr: towards me and my ambassador so great was this that I am unable to describe it.Further mor« when aslr as Saud wanted to go and pay his respects to the Political Agent the Shellch oi Kuwait forbade him from doing so at first and thus ii&amp;aJ Nasir was unable to see the Political Agent for many days.. Finally Sheikh Salim himself went and took Nasir bin baud to the Political Agent where also much dis pleasing talk was listened to. Later Nasir left Kuwait and came back to me with a message from Sheikh Salem , the absurd contents of which as you will see from the copy sent you ,have no origin : It is only out of my own decency and for the satisfaction of His Majesty's Govem- mentthat I am overlooking my rights. My relations with him have now been severed and if the matter is referable to His Majesty's Government they may kindly decide the boundaries-! between us and lay down new terms for the assurance and ease of both sides. And whatever will be proved to have been avoided by my fore-fathers I shall do the same,and the surety for this in His Majesty's Govern ment,and this is what I want . If the matter is merely to be left again between me and Sheikh Salem,and if Govern ment do not wish to interfere with us,I anticipate good in what happensjl now request you to decide the question as soon as possible ,as to whether I or I or His Majesty Government to settle the matter.If I am again to be asked to settle in peaceable manner with Salem ,1 pray to be 3.s excused,'he has wind in his head,and is overcome by igno rance ;surely,his character is well known to your Honour.

Majesty Government's decision in the matter and that the object was to explain certain points the actual time in order that no misunderstanding may occur, later. Finally that His Honour Sir Arnold Wilson.r.d.E. had instructed your Honour to inform me that he agreed to appoint an arbitrator early in the autum to give a decision in all out standing questions in the matter of territorial disputes existing between me and Ibn Subah .provided I undertook beforehand to accept the following conditions:-. Firstly. That I should accept during the whole of my life time on behalf of myself and my people the decision which will be passed by the arbitrator appointed by His Majesty Government. Secondly. That I should state in writing as priliminary tc negotiations exactly what I considered to be the boundaries between my dominions and those of Ibn Subah .that I should mention as far as I could any land-marks.names of wells .mountains, or grazing land etc;and whether such marks fall within my bounda ries or not or were considered as Joint property by both myself and Ibn Subah. Further more in giving this information I was to mention the grounds and proofs on which I based my claims. Thirdly. That I should undertake that until such time as His ilajesty Government settled the dispute between us no hostile act or movement or any kind of aggression shall be. commit ted ^a^Tt the dominions of Ibn Sub^h or his people by any of/^op. or tribes- -men. . 7Always provided that attack or an aggression act is committed against me by the other party. You ask me to agree to the above conditions and state also that Ibn Subah has been asked to comply with exactly similar ones. Yes,I beg to advise you that as regards the first condi tion I agree to accept on behalf of myself and my people the decision of the arbitrator who will be appointed by His Majesty government and I now give an undertaking on behalf of myself and my people not to interfere with those tracts of Koweit which * were not claimed or administered by my grand-father. As regards my informing your Honour as a priliminary to - negotiations of any aarks ,wells,mountains,or a feature such as grazing grounds etc. My answer is that I do-not recognize that Ibn Subah has any boundaries(in the hinterland)neither mountain nor land-marks, nor do I recognize that he has any tribesmen who depend on him,or on whome he depends,nor do I recognize that he has any shore in the hinterland of Koweit beyond the surrounding walls of Koweit town and this has been the situation from the days of his fore- « fathers and mine. If Salim has any proofs to the contrary let him produce them in order that I may admit or deny same. Any desert Arab you will know these facts and will be willing to give evidence to the above effects. As regards the conditions that I should guarantee if His Majesty Government undertake to settle the matter namely that no hostile^ act should be committed or any kind of aggression against the terrotories of Ibn Subah by any of my troops or tribes men (except I am attached by the other party)l undertake on behalf of myself and all who are under me that this shall be complied with. I would further inform your Honour that I have equipped a party under the command of one of my sons to guard my nothern frontier ,they have orders to resist any sort of aggression on the part of the tribesmen of Ibn Subah ;should any of the tribesmen of Ibn Subah commit a hostile*s act,and get punished for his action, I fear it may creat some difficulty for His Majesty Government . HenceHence If His Majesty Government are willing to s0 g u * l:,r * ntee for Ibn Subah's actions whether little or much (a® they jt apparently are ) from to-day I would request that Ibn Subah be ordered to call back his raiding party which is at Jahara under the command of Daij ,if this is done I will also recall the party in charge of my official; I request your Honour to inform me of the result.

Yesterday I asked the Senior Naval Officer if he could send a ship to protect British Interests. He is sending H.M.S.Espiegle as soon as possible,but apparently there is some difficulty in making her available as he says that she will arrive at the late st on Wednesday morning, and that she is required back at Basrah as soon as possible. I would observe in this connection that both the diips stationed in the Persian Gulf are &gt; more or less, not in a position to be used for the ordinary work in the 5 Gulf, being at present kept at Basrah.

PoliticalTHE IKHWAW ATTACK OH JAHRAH. On the afternoon of the 8th Ootober one of Shaikh Salira's apisa arrived In Kuwait with a report that a large foroa of Ikhwan had left Wafrah -it aunaat tlie proTloua evening for Subalhlyah. He was unable to eatlaate their numbero as he only saw them fron a considerable dlatanoe, lait ha aald It ma obvloua that they were not an ordinary raiding party. This infornation ma oonfirraed the following day by a nember of a Bedouin patrol, whioh had been captured by then near Wafrah late in the evening of the 7th October. His coapanions had been killed and he himself left for dead, but, although badly wounded he managed to got into Kuwait, Shaikh Salin was at Jahrah at the time as on the 7th October he had received a report, mhioh proved to be without foundation, of a hostile concentration at the TawSl wells, two (Jays' journey west of Jahrah, As soon as ho received this inforaation he made preparations for the defence of Jahrah* The Villa^a of Jahrah, inoluding its gardens, foras a rough paraleXiograa, the longer sides of miQh ar® about 1300 yards Ions and face south-west and north-east respectively. To the south-east of the village, and only separated by a roadway froa the nearest walled gardm, is the fort. This is about eighty yards square, and hai towers over the doorway and at the comers which give a rudimentary flank defence. The walls are fifteen feet high and two feat thick at the top - probably four feet at the base the towers being about •ight feet higher. The village is intersected by numerous aud walls, ifcioh give good cover froia view and soraa cover from fire. xhe fight started at # a.n. on the loth October, Tha Kuwait force was holding the south-west face of the village, with Ita Tawalai and his mounted Shaoaar on the right flank, and Da'ij's horsenen on the left. Tha Ikhwan launched their attack on the western end of the Position, which was held by the Jahrah villagers, and, .after routing Ita Tawalah, turned the position frora the north-west. Da 'ij was prevent a- from rendering any assistance by a superior body of mounted Ikhwan, and 'All al-Khallfah, who was oomnanding the K CWct 11Kuwait oontingant retirad and formed to tha right. nine o'olook the entire yiHage was in the hands of the Ikhwan, and Salira, with the other ahaikho and about six hundred aen, was shut up in the fort, the rent of hia force being dispersed. In the afternoon Bnlah sent a aeaaaee to ShaUch Salim offar^ Ma pe,ao8 if he would renounce ail olair. to tho camala, etc. which' the Ikhwan had taken, and would evacuate the fort, but Shaihh Salia refused, Ihree deternined attacks wsrs made on the fort during the night. Meanwhile, vary great narTrousnsss was evident in Kuwait, and tha wildest rumours were current. An attack on Kuwait was faared at any oinute, and every available nan was sent to man tha walla. On the morning of the nth October Shaikh Atoad al-jabir, wha was in ftoraaand in Kuwait, organised and despatched a relief force some six hundred strong, ^ sea&gt; in the Shaikh's launch 'Mishrif' and a few sailing boats. At the same time ITai TawSlah, mo had fled to Kuwait toe previous day, went out ty road, Bofor., these reinforcements arrived, however, Daid[sh sent in an iiiil ^th definite proposals of peace, T3ie said tot they had all ba«n vary much surprised to hear the garrison of tha fort praying like Muslims, as they had always been led to suppose that tha people of Kuwait were infidels, 'and that, if they really were Mualima, it should be quit© aasy to make peace between them. He than demanded that Shaikh Salim should put down all smoking, drink ing, gambling and prostitution in Kuwait. Shaikh Salim replied that he too disapproved of all these things, and that he was quite willing to prohibit their being done openly ty his subjects. He could not. however, be responsible for *hat people did in their own houses, nor could he be responsible for the action of foreign ers Who were not under his control, Eha quaation of the camels and other loot then oamo up. Shaikh Salim agreeing not to interfere with the Ikhwan if they left everything which they had taken. The Hm. on the other hand, maintaining that as they had taken it in ^ they had a perfect right to take it wito tha E . He eventually aaid that ha was not authorised to agree to Shaikh Sali^ ^dhlaself, tout that He would dlaouss the matter with Dawlsh. li® then withdrew and went off towards Dawlsh'a tent, which was to the north-west of the village. (The original report that the Ilchwan agreed to return their hooty is untrue). Shortly after this the Ilchwan moved off, taking everythins with them, and without any further fighting. They narohed three hours that day and halted, and the following day moved on to Subalhiyah, whore they still are. On tiie 14th October Dawlsh sent in a letter to Shaikh Sails asking thav &gt;lilal al-Mutairi, now one of the biggest merchants in Kuwait, should be sent out to Subaihiyah to treat with hia regarding a settlement of the dispute, She Shaikh refused and replied that if Dawlsh wantod to discuss anything with hia, he should send one of the Dushan fsally into Kuwait, The messenger who brought this letter was a Kuwait slave, who was captured at Haradh, near Jariyah, in May and was given hia life on condition that he Joined the Ikhwan, It is difficult to form an accurate estimate of the number of Ikhwan Involved. From the early reports received in Kuwait I put the number at about 1400, but after personally visiting Jahrah and seeing the dead on tha ground and the graves of those buried, I sea that there must have been far more, and think there cannot have been less th&amp;n 3000, I estimate their killed alone at Shaikh Salim and others who were present put their number at 4 000, usually saying that there were four bairaqs r with a thousand each, Dae messenger, referred to above, stated while in Kuwait that they originally numbered 4o«o, of whoa between 70© and 800 ware killed at Jahrah and over 6eo severely wounded, of which latter quite half died before they reached Subaihiyah, On reaching Subaihiyah their effective strength was not more than «500, but they found 300 re. inforcements awaiting them there, and had subsequently been Joined by 2oo more. These latter, camel riders, he described as coming baok'froa the north!! £he Kuwait force is said to have only lost about killed very few of whom were actual inhabitants of Kuwait, This a-wn number in comparison with the Ikhwan's losses, is due to the fact that the Ikhwan attacked across the open in masses and showed the aost utter disregard for their am safety.On tha lath October Dawlsh sent In envoys to Kuwait to dls- i cusa fra. for a settlement of the dispute, to accortooe with the ordinary ouatom, they were given tiae to rest before statins their aisalon, and Shaikh SaUa had not seen thea by the evening of 'ota October. Their teraa, however, are known, and are totally liapoasiole .or hia to accept, being in fact a deaaad that Shaikh S-Ua and the people of Kuwait should become Zkhwan forthwith, and that fron now onwards they sil0 uld be friends to their friends and .oes to their foes. Dawish apparently says he can accept no other teras hiaaelf, and, as he puts it, he cannot thread a needle Wi whou t XliSn rm ^ „ _ • -pproval. rnere aooordinsly seems nothins for it but war, and everything aee ns to indicate that an attack on Kuwait really is intended. f A rePreaenta tiv o of toe Shaikh, who accoapanied the foraer aossengera back to Subaihiyah and returned with the present envoys satiaateo the ikhw^., p resent effeotivs ^ ^ J at least 3000 foot.

For More to visit him as go between or 'Wasta 1 ' would be looked upon as a great compliment. Dawish is a remarkably clear headed man and would know how to appreciate visit. On the other hand as I see it here Salim has every inducement to put More against Faisal for reason that his one hope is to spoil our good relations with Bin Sa'ud.

I agree that if Bin Sa'ud authorised to attack Jahrah it was not compatible with the spirit of his assurances, but he will doubtless seek to justify it by repeating his'previous allegation that Salim was actively endeavouring to organize a combination against him including Shammar elements hostile to him and that attack on Jahrah was directed against Shammar and not Salim. I warned Balim myself that the force and his war flag at Jahrah were merely an incitement to Akhwan and that he had much better demobilize and depend upon our pacific intervention,but he did not see things in the same light. I am not prepared to encourage fresh hostilities by advising Salim to re-occupy Jahrah with a force. If he doesso he does i-t at his own risk as before.

He considers it imp- -ortant to inform: you of occurrence and urges you most urg- -ently to settle dispute with Koweit as soon as possible otherwise great conflagration may result. He again reminds you that he will accept only you as Arbitrator. He once more refuses mediation of any Arab ruler.

Acceding to letters^throw quite a different light on Jahrah attack and causes leading up to same.Summary of Bin Sa'ud's letter begins.I have already-reported facts o'f encounter at Jahrah as I received them,have now received fuller details from Faisal I haste to report same with the request that you will telegraph facts to High Commissioner as entirely i misleading reports emanating from Koweit are in circulation. I feared from the first that concentration of Ibn Tawala's Shammar at Jahrah under Bin Subah's war flag meant mischief. I reported my fears.I- warned my Frontier Badia against surprise attack. Later I sent Kudul Aziz Al-Turki my $ cousin to keep them in hand. What did Salim do? ^fter Ibn Tawala and Daij returned .from their raid south Shaikh (see my telegram No.304-C and 314-C) sent three parties to attack Nejd one of which actually reached A1 Rumah andcaptured many camels,one and a half days from Riyadh. The Mutalr under Faisal hotly pursued raiders as far as Jahrah where a fight took place, for details see Faisal's report, I haste to inform you of these facts as my object is to do nothing contrary-to wishes of His Majesty's Government.

After return of Dhaij from southern raid I concentrated Mutair in readiness. Then came the news that three of Salim's raiding parties had left Jahrah, - the first under Ibn Tawala against A1 Haba wells, the second under Ibn Majid against A1 Rumah, three under Karan against Shibak. All three successful, many camels captured. Our forces started in hot pursuit and followed raid until Returned Jahrah.We failed to recover camels. As enemy reached Jahrah our main pursuit reached Subaihiyah. We decided to recover camels while they were out grazing by a sudden attack. For this purpose we tried to get beyond Jahrah. To have retreated would have brought disaster;* We attacked, and though Salim's forces had the advantage in numbers and position God gave us the victory. We captured Jahrah. Salim took refuge in Qasral Ah (?)., from which place he begged peace.I replied I would refer to you. Pending your reply I moved to Subaihiyah. I now request early orders. We ourselves only attacked in pursuit of our property.If it is peace God be praised. If you want Koweit captured, capture easy,only send our com^rades from Artiviyeh we want no other aid.Our losses one hundred&gt; 0 killed and two hundred wounded, those of Koweit unknown though heavy.Wounded doing well, the -dead have attained heaven.

After oomplimenta 1 beg to report that after we had received newa of DHAIJ'a raid (i.e. the abortive raid to QARAITAH vide ray 304-C of 14th September and 314-0 of Slat September) we concentrated and got ready for action (fa aana). • e then heard that the force had returned to JAHRA but that three amaller raiding par- tiea had been aeht out from the main body. The firat of theae, under IBH TUWALA raided our Araba camped at EL HABA wella, t&gt;ie aecond under Ibn MAJID raided the wella of EL RUMAH, while the third party under 'KARAN' went for SHIBAAK. All theae*Ghazzua 1 were aucceaaful and lifted camela. Our forcea on hearing the newa puraued the raidera hot-foot in order to recover the camela We followed hard on their tracka which led aa far aa J\HRA, but God did not aee fit to let ua rocover them. Aa they enter ed JAHRA, we reached Subaihiyah# We the purauera halted (nanwakhna) at SUBAIHIYAH for one day, our hope bein?r that our camela would be aent out to graze and would get them by a aud- en attack. rr e thought thia waa the only way of getting them aeeing we had not aufficient forcea to engage Ibn Subah'a people at JAHRA, who were both many and were occupying towera. Next day we moved from SUBAIHITAH and halted (nauwakhna) at KAHAITAH, where we aent out a reconnaiaance which encountered IBN SUBAH*a acouta. Our party waa dtiven back. We then moved from RAHAIYAH with the intention of caTrming beyond JAHRA,until we ahould get a chance at our camela.

The AKHWAN continued their advance until they actually occupied the towers, taking their occupants and slaying them. This then went fen till the whole of JAHRA was in their hands. IBH 3UBAH and those with him fled into the QA3R AL HAMR. We remained at JAHRA for two days. Bin Subah sent us a messanger asking for peace saying*four enemies are mine, and your friends are my friends 1 * • He then asked that we should move to SUBAIHIYAH. We did so, our terms being he Bin 3ubah flould have peace, if you Bin Saud agreed to give it them, and that we had referred the matter to you. How then 0 Abdul Aziz if you want peace with Bin Subah and you know he is reliable, then thanks be to God; we only wish you to know we have had no other object than to defend ourselves and our property. If however, you have any other ideas regarding Kowett and its environs, and donot wish for peace with IBN SUBAH,then please let us know, and send as re-inforcements the rest of the people of ARTIXEH* We donot want any one else but they,In sha Allah, we will be sufficient for the job of taking both Bin Gubah and his Koweit. Should you on the other hand have some other idea, we await your orders. Regarding your servants the AKHWAN, their losses were 100 killed and 200 wounded, the latter are progressing well. We prayed God almighty that our dead have attained Heaven. Regarding Bin Subah's losses, 'wal lah', 0 Abdul Aziz they are without number, nor can I give you information whether they are great or small. For the present we are at 3UBAIHIYAH.

Tou say that ws should not attack Koweit itself; In-3ha-Allah, we shall follow your advice. God Borbid ws should ever do anything which is not liked by our master. In accordance with Bin Subah's request that one of the Akhwan be sent to hi», we sent 'J afhan' who did not return till after sight days. Were it not for fear of God and my regard for your advioe. we would have attacked Koweit as we were suspicious of foul play on his-pwt. Finally, an aeroplane flew over us and the Akhwan wanted to fire at it. but I strictly for bade them and they did not fire at all. Next day. when the men guarding cur camels came into camp, they brought a letter which had been dropped on them. l^ter, Xztsmx JUF rah* returned to us with a similar letter. When we saw this proclamation of the English between whom and yourself there appears an understanding^ of course, it became evident we could not stop in Subaihiyah any longer. You know the Akhwans they are somewhat ignorant and light-headed, fearing therefor, that something un-pleasant might take place if I delayed in Subaihiyah, I decided to take them away atones and to wait for your instruction. We are now encamped at Al-3affah wells. As regards JAFRAK's statement about Ibn Subah, he says he was not allowed to see or speak to any one, but re ports ibn Subah has a large rabble (aubash) collected together under that Kafir of theirs, ibn Maidad. Jafran thinks there *re 7,000 horsemen, and the English have given three aero planes to help them, and have also promised them artillery rifles and ammunition# Ho reports that Bin Subah apoke to him thus : ' i7? h a v 9 got the tr^asuraa of Jabir and Mubarak, and by God Almighty, i win apand them all in fighting againat Bin Saud and saouring halp not only'fron Kowait itself, but alao from Maoca and Jabal Jhammar, and I, Bin Subah, shall attack Hasaa both by land and saa. The British themselves have promised me help in fighting against Bin Saud'. I know all this to be mere bombast, and maraly mer- tion it your information. Thank God, tha Muslim are strong enough for any one. But, o Abdul Aziz, i desire to give you some straight talk. You have weakened yourself and also weakened us, the tfuslema, by means of your policy, ''hen wa found ibn Subah proud and aggressive, we attacked him,but no sooner had God and the Muslims broke* hia power, then up you get up and say, 'Let him remain in peaoa, leave him in hia town, as I have to satisfy the British'. it ia Tarrabah and the Sharif over again. That ia to say, when God gives us victory, you rob us of the fruits of the same. Now you wish us to spare Bin Subah. But, now, o Abdul Aziz, if this is your opinion then know that it is not according to the religion (Din), nor is It according to the dictates of wisdom. Sou ought to submit the matter to the decision of the Alima of the Mualima. If your action is only dictated by the Kaglish, then you are deceiving us.If the Sharif and Bin Subah are under their (British) protection, then let the British stop them making any hostile movements against Ifejd, you on your part can also undertaka to do the saiae, and the Muslims will regard your undertakings as binding, if the objeot(of your undertakings with the British) is that military action is allowed in the Desert, but prohibited when it comes to taking towns, then suoh undertakings are useless as far as we can see, even though we may be simple Bedouins. w 9 do not ask you for anything except what you yourself have grant ed us, your servants and subjects, that is 'Tahkim A1 SharV* (submitting matter to Shara for decision). So,now we ask you for a reference to Shara in this matter.Baar no man, 0 Abdul Aziz. The people who aro raa- ponaible for the situation (ibn Subah and Ibn Tuwala) are, believe ma, o Abdul Aziz, all vioious. By God, we did not want their country, nor did we aapire to their property# Thank God, we are powerful, but yet wa only want to defend our country, a fact to the truth of which I awear by God, whose pleasure we always wish for. We aaek merit in Sod'a eye, by pleasing you, and will never do anything against your wiahes. % Had you aean the weeping and wailinp- of the Akhwa* whan they were ordered to leave Subaihiyah, especially after thay had heard Jafran's report, I believe, if you youraalf had been present, you would most certainly have attacked Kowait. inatead, even though you may have thought that doing so would have meant losing each one of us, nay, losing Nejd itself with all its inhabitants, now I beseech you in the name of God that as we, your aubjecta, are obedient and faithful to you next to God, and your word is mora fearad than a sword, you too should deal Juatly with us, and not allow any one elsa to bring ua to harm, e donot want mora than the territory whioh your father and grand-father nossea sed, and whioh Muslims (Akhwan) still inhabit, and where they cannot bear any interference# I have written you this long reply, but my object is only to give sincere advice, for I fear your subjects may get suspicious about the intentions of their own ruler. I call God to witness that I am sincere, obedient and faithful to you. May God help ma according to my sincerity to you. We all have fullest trust in you, and believe you cars only for God and the welfare of your subjects. * 'a11ah', 0 Abdul Aziz, when at the point of death the only cry of your subjects is, n 'ay Abdul Aziz forgive our shortcomings*.

I'our suggestions are the outooine of your siood will for me, your friend, and are always very welcome in all matters. You advise me to accept the invitation of my honoured friend His excellency Sir Percy Oox, in order that the dispute may be settled. 1 iuily believe that His Kxcellency is the greatest defender of my rights and interests and have entire confidence in him. 1 also much ap-oreciate your advice. Personally, I am extremely desirious of meeting His Excellency, bbt 9 ince our last interviewl have been suffering frim ill-health, so that I could not even stay long at HAS3A. 1 received your letter in DAHAITAH, where J had gone for a change and for certain other reasons, which need not be mentioned here, it v/as sufficient for me to know as much as ^our letter told me. Supposing I were quite well, do you not think my friend, that my goin^ to BASRAH would be lowering my position and reputation and detremental to my interests, i have not committed aggression, but it is BIN SUBAH who has done so, as I have already fully explained the facts of the matter in my previous letters. I trust that you yourself as well as His 'xcellency tlie High Commissioner and all other just officials of the Hifrh Government would not consent to this. If I were not suffering from ill-health and were it not for the reasons I stated in my letter only to please my sincere friend Mr Percy Cox, I would atonce, vxithout the least hesitation proceed to Basrah, lather raore, I donot see any reason for the non^establishment of p :oodralations batwaan ma and ain 3ubah - what balongad to ny father and grand-fathar ahould balonp to ma, and alnilarly to din Subah, in aooordanoa with tb/b artiola laid down in the fraaty which waa oonoludad at Baarah when I had the honour to meet the High Coniniasionar. r j. would raqueat you to kindly inform His ^Ixoel^noy th^t I would (rive him the trouble to settle the question of Koweit, and that I have fullest confidence in His Kxoellenoy being my sincere friend. With rerrard to the financial aid, i am awaiting to hear the result of His isxcellency 1 s nroiaises, as I am badly in need of sarae, and so I cannot but mention the subject again in this letter also. I hone you will exert your best efforts towards getting the sane through. &gt; . f i J i- 51 JTranslation of a letter dated 27th Safar 1559 (= ^th November, 1920) from Bin Saud to the Political A^ant, ilahrein* The object in writinp this friendly letter is to en quire after your honour^ health and to inform you that ray con dition will please you in every respect and nothing important has occurred which may be worthy of mention to your honour. I received letters from my friends ABDULLAH bin JILOVI and ABDUL AZIZ AL QU3AIBI, which I perused and of which T under stood the contents, show in p : that you are very anxious to p'et news regarding the fight which took place at JAHRAH. , As it is not hidden from your honour, interested people give out false rumours accompanied by several false tales, and spread them out in their own interests, as the Arabic proverb says : three cannot be stopped from barking : the dog, the ill- disposed and the mad^whose words cannot injure me in any way# ffivery one having common sense knows by now the whole affair actually and what has/happened and also the losses, and, furthermore, v your understanding is quite capable of knowing every^thinfy in this connexion. If the Shaikh of Koweit and his followers had been victorious and killed that number of Akhwan which they rumoured to be thousands of souls, it was unnecessary for them to remain in the vicinity of Koweit and encarar) for a num ber of days at 'SUBAIHiyKH' 1 . The facts are those that I stated in my previous letter to your honour : i.e. 100 killed and 200 wounded and nothing more. furthermore, had it not been out of obedience and re gard for me, you would have seen their real action apainst Koweit. All this is due to consideration and regard for His i Majesty* s Government. I may also add that I am not fond of ad vertising my actions, several of which you are well aware of, having perused the same in the details of the events, although it is possible that you may have heard false accounts against tha true facta.

Dawtsh's envoy Jufran told me definitely on October 24th that Akhwan operating against Ibn Subah by Bin Sard's direct orders. Had there been any truth, in the story of raids in Bin Sard's let- -ter Jufran would have mentioned them to me and Bin Sa'ud would have surely mentioned them In his letter (omission), as it is e/ mconcievable Salim's followers would have raided within a day and a half of Riyadh without Bin Sa'ud's hearing of it before being tbld of it by Faisal. Apparently he does not refer to request contained in your telegram No.13431 that he keep (omission) disputed territory,and as far as is known he is still occupying JariJ:ah, etc.• His suggestion that you decide dispute between him and Salim in his absence.offers no prospect of satisfactory settlement as even were you to (corrupt group) arbitrary frontier it woul'd do no real good. I do not believe friendly relations between the two rulers can be re-established without a meeting, and unless there is trade feHt between Koweit and Nejd they will remain at a standstill,and it rather is the re-opening of trade &amp;TK&amp;xm£± than fixing of Frontier whiorh is so important to Koweit as a whoii.

After opmp l lnenta I have received a letter from my ooufjin ABDUL aziz biro iUKKI, in whioh he conveys some news which you vrill see your self • I wish to transroit these to your honour for two reasons: firstly, because Bin 3ubah is unceasingly continuing his intrigue a -he sends for tsy tribesmen and bribes them. He finds out those from among them who are most foolish and.gives them bribes. Secondly, I wonder, how it is that the question of ny going to B a SRAH , which should be a secret between your honour andmyself, is being onenly talked in Koweit, where it is given out that this visit has been made compulsory for me in order to cause an insult from His Majesty's Government to Bin Baud, ihis, probably, is the outcome of Bin Subah's machinations# Moreover, His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent in Koweit / has been spreading adverse rumours and even his conversations with JUFRAN, when the latter interviewed him - not at all good \ or desirable. Jut I iid n6t like to give expression to this before, as I did not know fully what has emanated from him. Now his adverse reports regarding the question of my going to BA3RAH have been confirmed by the letters of the aforesaid Bin TURKI and DHAIDAN bin HATHLSM (Enclosed in original). I am now convinced that the adverse remarks and reports which have been imputed to him were really given out by him. This is, no doubt, unbecoming for both sides. His Majesty^ Government am\ wg'x&amp;t&amp;z as well as myself. 'Your Government have been constantly forbidding me to act against Bin Subah, and in return he has been catching hold of my own foolish and lisloyal tribesmen, and P'ivinfr them bribes# And if I neglect him, you are wall aware of the condition of the Bedouins and the ill-disposed.

May God preserve you, I may inform you that now-a-days some extraordinary news have been received from Koweit which are rather astonishing. Some of the men of Bin Subah have bean giving out that the AJMAN are now quite pleased with Bin Subah and I did not show any concern at this, and after some days NAYIF ABU- KI LAB, NAHR AJj-MUTALIQQIM and OBAID left my camp. They had,formerly, been with DHAIDAN. They left us now on the plea that they want ed to proceed Northwards for the purpose of grazing. 3o, I pave them leava» Next day it was ascertained that they had encamped to the North near Bin Subah# They are not many, being only about ten houses. I have made enquiries about them and learn that Bin Subah has given ABU-KILAB Xx£ T£ 100 /- and AL-MUTALAQ QIM T£ 50./-, and he must have also given money to their compan ions. He ( Bin Subah) has been telling them that tha Rnplish have given him their hand (support) and also given him aero planes and ships to help him against Bin Saud; and that any one who came and joined him would be protected from Bin Baud and would also be paid a monthly salary. The proof of Government* being angry with Bin Saud,^he says, is found in the words of t^e British Consul at Koweit, who has remarked that the British Government have notified Bin Saud to come to Basrah and that they want to put responsibility on him. The t&gt;aoT&gt;le talk vari ous bad things, which we never expected to hear. Now,brother, Abdul Aziz, May God preserve you, you are apt to be deceived by (official ?) information. Bin Subah has, since last summer been making prepara tions to fight against you and the Moslems (Akhwan). God or dained his defeat on account of his evil intentions, and made(s) 2^6 him B99k hslp averywhers, and offer bribes to people.

He suggests his son Chassib should go to Riyadh at once accompanied by Ahmed-al- -Jabir and one or two people of Koweit to try to make peace, taking letter from you to the effect that he is going merely as Peace-maker and not in any way as an arbitrator.He thinks that he would succeed in making peace and that once that were done final settlement bf dispute should be much simpler.Even if he did not succeed it would not make relations worse than at present.He me wishes^to asi(for reply as soon as possible as he wants to return to Mohammerah on Saturday.

On the other hand if he insists on quarrelling with Bin Sa'ud in the interior we cannot give him effective help and are only concerned to protect port of Koweit from attack.

Shaikh sent for several leading merch- -ants and said he wanted to collect more men to send to Jahrah. They refused and said he had enough there already# However,men are being enrolled on wages today,but have n©t been sent so far. I said in my telegram No.15 that people were not opposed to Salim's policy; this is still largely the case theoritically, but in practice when it comes to going or providing men themsel- -ves they are 3a»gg:±H± beginning to think differently. There is &amp; also section of people who think all available men should be concentrated in Koweit for the defence of the town itself, and that three or four hundred are enough for Jahrah. Few of latter even see large force at Jahrah is a positive danger,being merely challenge to Faisal. It has become known too that a large force is contrary to our advice and most think it silly to oppose this. Feeling against Salim is getting very strong again,and r©vol- -utionary talk increasing. They realize that he is chief obst- -acle to peace as the whole quarrel is a personal one between ki him 'and Bin Sa^d; and whatever be the rights of the case he is simpler (two corrupt groups).

As I have previously informed your honour, some of my tribesmen, namely, Mutair and Ajman, have become corrunt and also the tribes of my onsmios ^haranar and othsrs. Tha abovementioned Bin Suwait has been giving shelter to these tribeamen who cominitted a crime or did anything against orders and wishes, and he makes his excuses in the name of Government. This state of things is most harmful to me; now, fcuawKxax whoever sees any of my refractory tribesmen or of any of ray enemies in this condition will interfere with them in the neighbourhood of the territory of my friends, the High British Government, and this will be the cause of misunderstanding, and will give rise to trouble amongst the Bedouins.

You ask me to make further enquiries and to report more facts regarding the aforesaid. I beg to say that I have been watching his movements and that after I get some information I shall let you know at once. With regard to the news of Kejd and its dependen- cies nothing important has occurred except that in these days I have received news to the effect that Sharif Ali has encamped at Taif and has constantly been agitating and instigating the Arabs against my tribesmen who are residing in the vicinity of Turabah and thus inscurity is prevailing. This is contrary to the truce which was agreed upon between us in order to stop hostule movements and though they themselves transgress the laws yet they complain^yto H.M* s Government# I enclose herewith a letter for your perusal and in order that you may acquaint yourself with the real facts^I request you kindly to report the matter to H.E. Sir Percy Cox. I may also say that this is my last warning as muchmuch harm has laready ■been dona to ay prestige in the eyes of the general public and ray subjects in the interior. I have, therefore, left matters in dispute to he decided hy the officers of my friends, s Governraentj hut I do not see any result. My proposal for a settlement which I have already stated in my previous communications is as follows:- (1). Hither boundaries should he fixed as they used to he formerly# (2). Or the arbitration of the places in dispute he left to the inhabitants themselves or the inhabitants he given i [k. a chande ta whichysides ( rulers ) they want for themselvest If that is not possible then the people should be free to settle among ttseaMiws themeelves, but in that sane I should not be blamed.

Some think that he will say that Salim makes this impossible snd that he can only maintain good relations with Koweit by dealing with Ahmad and not with Salim at all. I have haard this both from Members of the palace circle like Abdul Latif and also from merchants* General opinion however is that mission will succeed in making truce but that it will be shortlived, as (a) according to palace circles Bin Saud will invent excuse for renewed aggression or (b) according to opposition , either this will happen or Salim will start intriguing again, I learn that proposal is being discussed by some of leading inhabitants that a deputation should come to Agency and reauest us to force Salim to 'establish council of about six members including Ahmad, as regular advisers, Yhey think it sole means, short of deposing Salim, of making permanent peace possible, I believe Hamad-as-Asqar is one of chief advocates of (see my telegram 87 of August 28th,), I request instructions how to reply if such a deputation should visit me. Personally I think small council might do some good as at present Salim is practically in hands of Mulla Salih, I venture to suggest that 1 might reply to the effect that His Majesty's Government are not. prepared to interfeue with the internal affairs of Koweit by compelling Shaikh to rule in any particular way; but we will advise him to accede to their wish and set up councilo 1 think it probable, if we gave, him this advice, and he did not take it, people would very likely solve whole problem by removing him themselves, p olitical,ss/s? 3,3 Telegram.Code.

The letters gave little information beyond the fact that peace had been arranged between Ibn sa'ud and Kuwait. Accord ing to the statement of the messengers, however, Ibn Sa'ud said when the Kiesion first arrived, that lie felt nothing but the most friendly feelings towards the people of Kuwait, and the subah family, with the exception of Sheikh Salim. Sheikh r .alim had brought all the recent'troubles on his own. head by declaring war on the Mutair and by similar acts. He himself desired nothing more than that there should be friendship between Kajd and Kuwait, but Sheikh saUm was a great obstacle. He thought, however, that peace was possible if Sheikh Admed al-jabir acted for sheikh Salim. in all dealings with himself. He drew up a document describing a frontier from Kuwait which he said he was willing to recognise at once. The 'MAQTA' stream, which flows into the Persian (Tulf, 75 miles S.S.E. of Kuwait formed part of this line, but what it was further West is not known. Then came th^ news of Sheikh Saiim's death, and Ibn Sa'ud tore up the document and'said 'that the two houses of Sa'ud and Subah were once again united in perfect friendship and that there was no longer any need for any boundary between# Sheikh*Admad al Jabir arrived at Kuwait on the 24th March and was given a great ovation. He was accepted as Saiim's successor by the Subah family on the same day, and on March the 25th he summoned a meeting of the notables of the town who also accepted him. He at once told them that he had no intention of taking'any important step without first consul ting them. One of them suggested that there should be regular ly constituted council to meet regularly once or twice a week. To this Ahmed replied that he would welcome his people every day if they had anything they wished to discuss with him,Mm, and that he on his part promised always to send for \ them when anything important arose, Thp Bheikh of Mohammerah, who was present advised the people to let it rest at that, and they agreed to do so and appeared well satisfied.
