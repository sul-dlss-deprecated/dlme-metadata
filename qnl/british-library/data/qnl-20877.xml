(a) This Order-in-Council has become necessary in order to put the procedure of the Court at Bahrain on the same footing as all other British Courts in the Gulf - as will be seen it in no way aims at any radical change or reduction of iour Excellency's authority or prestige and on the contrary it has increased your honour. The order applies to British subjects and to foreigners with respect to whom Your Excellency has agreed with His Jajesty that He should exercise jurisdiction. (b)-(l) It is an offence for any person to violate or fail to observe any treaty made between Your Lxcellency,your prede cessors or heirs and His Britannic majesty's Government. (S) Any question of local customs may as heretofore be referre' to the Majlis el Urfi. (5) Any dispute between pearling masters and divers may as heretofore be referred to * alifah Court. (4) Any point of Muhammadan law may be referred to the ^azi. (5) In cases where parties are Luhammadans the pourt may refer questions concerning probate of wills or administration of property to the fi^azi for settlement under supervision of the Court. (6) When one of iour Excellency's subjects desires to bring a complaint against a person under the jurisdiction of the British Government the Political Agent shall listen to the same and may with the concurrence of Your Ixcellency decide it himself or send it to a Court composed of your aud his representative or if the defendent is a tnuhammadan reier ic to the Qazi — a representative oi tne Agent being piesent. (7) When one of your Excellence's subjects desires to bring a civil suit against a person under the juricdic .ionBritish Government - The Political Agent shall listen to the same and may with lour Excellency's approval decide the case himself or rend it to a Oourt consisting of iour Excellency and his repre sentative or send it to the Majlis-el-Urfi or if it is between pearl—wasters and divers to Salifah Court. (8) Points of rrruhammadan law that may arise may be referred to the Qazi for decision. (9) /hen a person over whom the British Government has jurisdic tion brings his case to any of Your Excellency's Courts and engages in writing to abide by the decision of that Court and later refuse to abide by that decision or to pay any fees or expenses. This is an offence against the Order-in-Oouncil. (10) If a person over whom the British Government has jurisdic tion gives false evidence in any of ^our Excellency's Courts this may be punished by the Political Agent by fine or imprisonment. ( 11.) [f any person over whom the British Government has juris diction .smuggles or imports into or exports from bahrain any goods for which Your Excellency should receive customs duty he shall be severely punished. (12) The same applies to any prohibited goods. (15) If any person over whom the British Government has juris diction mocks at religion or religious feast or ceremony he shall be punished. (14) Khidmah will be levied as heretofore in all caees in which one party is a Bahrain subject and paid to Your Excellency. (15) In cases between subjects over whom the British Government has jurisdiction they will be charged different fees but to com pensate Your Excellency His Majesty's Government will pay into Your Excellency's revenue R.500/- a month. This is done in order to make things easy and simple and as will be seen this is to Your Excellency's advantage. (16) Finally i have great pleasure in informing Your Excellency that His Britannic lajesty's Government as a special act of grace and in token of its appreciation of your Excellency's long friendship and in proof of its good intentions towards the Arab Rulers and particularly to yourself and relying on your justice equityequity have decided to grant Your Excellency jurisdiction over the suhjectB of those Arab Chiefs with whom iour Excellency is in treaty relationship and His majesty's Government has every confidence that Your Excellency will use this privilege with humane and enlightened methods and intentions in order that there may be no cause for His f.'-aje sty'^Government &lt;5* to intervene, 1 am sure Your Excellency will fully appreciate the necessity of putting the Bahrain Court on a proper footing and will understand the contents of this letter and will appreciate the consideration HisMajesty's Government has shown to Your Excellency's honour and prertige. Wishing Your Excellency long life with health and happiness.Co^y of a letter dated L?t iebruary 1919 from the Political Agent,Bahrain to Shaikh f isa bin 'Ali A1 Khalifah,Chief of Bahrain. 'ith reference to our conversation this morning with reference to khidmah i beg to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty's Government have instituted this with no intention of reducing Your Excellency's authority or against your rights but merely to make the matter simply and to save time and work and that Your Excellency's Amirs' fidawis may render efficient service and be recompensed adequately for the same - Nor is it any new thing since Your Excellency has been receiving khidmah up to date and will continue to do so as before on all cases relating to Bahrain subjects. Only in relation to subjects over whom His Britannic ajesty has jurisdiction does the intention apply. Jrja pecuniary manner your Excellency's revenue will be increased firstly because the average on all cases during the past five years has worked out 3.t R .2882/- per annum whereas His iajesty's Gov rnment have consented to pay in to your Excellency's revemjBe R.3600/- and in addition to this Your Excellency will receive the usual khidmah from cases relating to Your Excellency's subjects.

Reference above I consider reply highly satisfactory. In view of opposition from Shaikh's advisers and great difficulty in removing this individually. It will be noted that Shaikh accepts the whole and is willing to surrender on all points. But asks for consideration on two points. The first is alcad^ty stipulated for vide sections 44 and 45. As regards this I suggest that/may sets as proposed by the Shaikh. The point therefore raised by the Shaikh is I take it acceptable and I might inform him accordingly (provided half the members are appointed by ourselves) maintaining of course 44 sub para (2).

The first part of the volume (running up to folio 60) is comprised of copies of inward and outward correspondence, arranged in approximate chronological order, starting with the earliest items first.

Folio 100 has been omitted or is missing.The following folios are fold-outs: 34, 61, 62, 69-82, 84, 87, 89, 95, 97, 102, 103.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains correspondence relating to the introduction of the Order in Council in Bahrain on 3 February 1919. A printed copy of the Order in Council is included at the front of the volume (folios 2-9), and marked with red, blue and black pencil annotations, marking incorrect or important aspects of the text. The main correspondents in the volume are the Political Agent, Captain Norman Bray, and the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah. Numerous letters were exchanged between the two men directly before and after the introduction of the Order in Council. Bray’s correspondence prior to this introduction seeks to smooth the way and seek Shaikh ‘Īsá’s full acceptance of the Order in Council. Correspondence after the introduction of the Order in Council is largely comprised of negotiations over the Shaikh’s relinquishment of
                           khidmah(a ten per cent judicial fee payable to the Sheikh of Bahrain's treasury), and expressions of thanks and mutual appreciation between the two men. Bray's letter to the Deputy Political Resident at Bushire and the Civil Commissioner in Baghdad, dated 14 February 1919, includes diaristic reports on the negotiations and meetings that took place between himself at Shaikh ‘Īsá during the introduction of the Order in Council (folios 28-47). A English text of the notification of the Order in Council, issued by the Political Agency, is included on folio 18.Folios 102 and 103 are loose pages containing office notes. The correspondence described in these two pages, which refer to the administration of the Majlis [al-Urfi], are annotated as dating from 17 March 1941 to 8 April 1942. It is likely, therefore, that these two pages were misplaced at a later date into the current volume.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Bahrain Order in Council (1913)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
