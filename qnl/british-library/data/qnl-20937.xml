H. Ov - II. III. IV. The primary object of your mlsBlon 1 b a passive one. You should proeeed to Riyadh and there report to Bin Saud Infomlnj? him yerbally that under Instructions from His Majesty's Government you have been deputed the to accompany the Mejd pilgrims to/Haj. This at the original request of Bin Eaud himself. You should say that Ajab Khan, Captain, Indian Army, Is already In Mecca In similar capacity to your^self, and that he has been Instructed by His Majesty^s Government to look to the question of rations and foodstuffs for the Hejd V Party on their arrival also as asked for by Bin Saud. Mention nothing about King Husaln's recent wire to Cairo In which he states he never gave permission to any Mejdls coming to Mecca, but only permitted Bin Saud himself with 300 men. Try and persuade Bin Saud to tajre as few pilgrims with him as likely to make things generally, al^o his * armed force should be kept as low as possible. You should appeal,If necessary, to Bin Saud*e statesmanship In the matter. Should you find that a very large force of pilgrims Intend to start and should you gather that Bin Saud Is unable to control the number without risking trouble, then your role Is to accept the situation but you should V. Immediately report the fact by urgent message to Bahrain, for transmission to Baghdad. Your role enrou/e to Mecca and specially as you near Uejaz, Is to kkep things as quiet as possible by frtfcndly advice. You should discourage any bIriis of fanatical or hostile attitude towards things Hejaz or Shareef.(2) tt . VI. Reraeiiber that much of the Buocess of the pilgrimage depends on the attitude of Bin Saud hlmeelf* As you know, he has given guarantees to Government that he will keep his people thoroughly In hand. You are present at his request to see that he carries out these guarantees /Vw and report his behaviour generally. VII. You will, probably, be met at TAIF by Shareef Abdullah, who will be deputed to welcome Bin Saud there. Possibly His Majesty^ representative at MECCA will also be there. VIII. In Mecca you must carry on, as circumstances permit, reporting by telegraph to Bahrain and repeating to Baghdad, any urgent matter or request. IX. Should you want money, get same from His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Jeddah, quoting this as authority. X. Be as circumspect as you can In all things and con sult Shaikh Farhan on all matters- two heads are better than one. The latter Is to be trusted. He knows Bedoulni manners and customs perfectly and will recognize certain Indications or 'changes of wind' before you will. As you know, Farhan Is of SMAM^AR stock. Bin Saud likes and trusts him. XI. v En route keep a short dally diary,noting especially ( 1) Length of marches In hours (8) Names of camping places (R) Nature of water c , o-L// • ^ C (4) Nature of country on march, ^ (5) Any points of special Interest, such as heat , by day and night, mountains seen In distance. (6) Characteristics of local Bedouins. (7) And General demeanour of pilgrims day by day. &lt;X4 XII. Gather «e much Information Kkast as you can about Akhwan, whether movement^growing, whether Bin Saud^ control and Influence Is Increasing or decreasing. XIII. You may Inform Bin Baud regarding (1) Jurisdiction question and M.M.G.'s latest orders on subject In letter to Shaikh ^ • * Abdullah C.I .ii.*,(3) (?) OuBtoniB and Gort.'s latest prdere. (S) Boat Registration. Explaining advantages and in- /srt ^ormi n^ that Rulers of Iwbh Bahrain and datar ^nave^accepted with, alacrity# (4) Question of Light Buoy for Ojair. (5) Difficulty in finding suitable doctor who is Muslim for Riadh. Government hope to discover a mam shortly. Regarding Doctor Harrison.

(«) Tell him regarding the recent troubles on the Euphrates in Iraq, and point out that these were quite local and were due to the imprisonment of a shaikh of the Bani Huchain near Rumaidha in vicinity of Diwaniyah. The tribe that caused th trouble temporarily damaged the railway line in two places but by the time you reach Riadh the line will have been repaired and everything will be going on as normal. (7) If not already sent take map of partition of Turkish Empire with you and explain verbally to Bin Saud. (8) Bolshevicks. You may say that there are signs that they want peace.

In ny proposals for improving the prospects nd in- creasinr; the pay of the -ninisterial establishment in the Persian Gulf I am suggesting that the st Tr le of the Indian Assistant should be altered to Extra Assistant (Resident) and the appointment graded as ]xtra Assistant Resident, grade B on 300-20-400, plus 50 house rent and 50 local. If this is ganotioned the job will be a very good one. The scheme at present outlined is 1 Extra Assist'-t Resident,grade A 5 r 'xtra Assistants Resident,grade B Clerks and r.unshis.

He is a man of substance here and quite influential and knows Cnglish and Arabic quite well colloquially. He would do interviewing business, petty cases etc quite well for you, the - rh he would be not much use at translating etc. He can translate roughly but his English wants correcting and he cannot type. But I take it Bashir Ahmed is to do all that work? If you would like to have Agha Khalil please send me a wire and I will send him a^ong #political Agency, Bahrain. / V&lt;V 7 J C t Dated the 3rd August, 1920• Plsaaa refer to your two D.Os of 22nd July last, lour proposals for improving the prospects and in creasing the pay Qt«. ©f the Indian Assistant and clerical establishment in the Persian Gulf seem to me excellent. Thank you for your selecting Bahrain for a first class head- clerkship. As you say I think it deserves one. I should be grateful to know if, in proposing this increased pay, you have any intention of withdrawing the Dollar Compensation Allowance. In my opinion if such is discontinued before rates go very considerably lower, oven this generously proposed increase in pay wont meet the situation, and consternation will r ^ign among one's clerical establishment. In this con nection I would invito your attention to my No. 879 datod ^4th July last quoting ratos of necessities of life today, lou will see that cost of living generally has gone up 500^ since 1914. It would be interesting to know also if you are recommending all of these posts to be pensionable. 2. As regards your proposal of sending down Agha Khalil, the Residency Dragoman, as Nativ e Assistant, I am afraid tho proposal, if carried out, would only cause diasention and jealousy in this office. If an Indian of the status of oiddiq Hasan cannot be found, Mirza Abdul Husain would naturally think he had been unfairly treated, if Khalil wore put in over his head, and would be very disheartened in conse quence. 1 would not like this to happen as his work has greatly improved of late and he is trying hard. I would, therefore, rather not have Agha Khalil. \ 3. However, my alternate proposal in my D.O. 198-C of l^th July last was that with flashir Ahmad as my Confidential Clerk, and given an Additional Junior Clerk for my English i Office1 'y lUzs Office, I could wsli carry on till the p^rmanynt Indian Assiatttnt rejoinsd; under the circumstances, therefore, and seeing that a 'pucca' Indian ^aaiatant cannot be s ent me, I shall be quite content to carry on with a tamporhtry Junior ^ngliah apoaking clerk. 4. In your D.T. Telegram ®f 29th July you recommend ene Abdul Hakim (wh®m I know and »fh® ia quite a good man) for tha poet of Vernacular Clark here. I might mention to you that on transfer of Bashir Ahmad from Vernacular Office to second clerkship vice Rebeir©, ^oing on Eastern Bank i ^stabliah- ment, the- vernacular elerkchip was proposed by me for oyod Sharif Huaain, brother to 3y©d Siddiq Hasan vide my mem© No. 815/160 dated 3rd July last, lou agread to the proposal^! and Jharif Husain ia due to arrive tomorrew by BARJORA. What I proposed in my D»0. 198-C dated 17tii July i9-:0, was t o take a temporary clerk to work for Bashir Ahmad, whom I have taken as roy personal and Confidential clerk, until a permc- nent Indian Assistant comes. This will show that the post for which I want a clerk is quite a temporary one. If Abdul Hakim will accept this temporary post, it will suit me down to the ground ( it will moan his being here about 9 months). If he does not accept it, I would request you t© serd me some other temporary English clerk as G ®on as possible. 5. Regarding De Mellor of Kowoit coming here and relieving Rahmat Ullah Khan your proposal ssems fair, th©ugh I shall be sorry to lose Rahmat Ullah» 6. Bashir Ahmad is doing well in confidential work and I hope you will nmt lose sight of him for any Head clerkship that might fall vacant in Persian Gulf or avsn Persia. I have written about him before. fc.

Dear Siddiq fiaean, ihonk you Tor your interesting three letters written Irom Hoffuf'. I sent them direct to Civil Commis sioner for information. Please thank also Farhan for his note. The main point of this letter is to tell you what you doubtlessly know already that Bin Saud wrote to me Just before your arrival at Riyadh saying that he oouldnot go to Haj ii Govt• insisted on hia limiting the number of pilgrims from Najd # and also if Govt, required him to limit the number of armed men. Bin Saud very impatiently informed Govt« thai it was all its fault for delaying giving him instructions until too late. He urgently aakad for definite orders to reach him in all uoaalble timet i.e. within four days of his letter reaching me here. Failing his receiving a repl^ by 27th July he said I was to tell His Majesty's Government that he could not set on Haj this year. He, how ever proposed that in stead he should send a small mission off to Mecca, which moving at ^dst speed would be able to do Haj, and afterwards would present themselves to King Husain, and start priliminary negotiations with a view to poace { Bin Saud's letter was very badly w yt kicjffH here ex- preseed, but this is what was understood to be the purport) Bin Gaud^ letter was sent to Baghdad clear line a and answer as received today has been sent him along with this letter, conveying Civil Commissioner's wishes. I'h^se are to the effect that quite understands pil grimage, as far as Bin iiaud is concerned, cannot come off this year, but distinctly approves Bin Saud's stataemanlika suggestion regarding sending a special mission on to Mecca atonee even if at eleventh hour, iithing but good can of such mission. You yourself are to go with the mission, and of course Farhan. 1 write this note to tell you that you areara to uaa pvli you irifluano© with bin S»ud in thi» matter and. in any oasa you are to prevent him changing his mind about it# Tell him from me to get hie mission ready atonoe on receipt of thia and send it off post^ haste under a res ponsible accredited parson.
