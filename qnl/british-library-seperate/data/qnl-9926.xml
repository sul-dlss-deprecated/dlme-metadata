The correspondence also covers his purchase of a saluting gun and desire to buy an aircraft.The main correspondents in the file are British officials from the Political Agency in Kuwait, the RAF in Iraq, the Political Residency in Bushire and India Office officials in London. It also contains correspondence between Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and the Political Agency in Kuwait, much of which is in Arabic (with translations in English).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a8#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a8#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
