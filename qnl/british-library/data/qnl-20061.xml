On the other hand it must be recognised that we can in fact give little assistance of value and that our efforts will probably be ineffectual as before in case of U.S.A. Moreover looking at question from different angle it would be manifestly unwise to encourage Muscat to think complete tariff autonomy can be secured except on reasonable conditions. India has more to lose than either France or U.S.A. if Muscat tariffs are greatly increased and our main safeguard against this might be Sultan*s contractual inability to raise tariff/against other countries with whom we can reasonably claim equal treatment on most favoured nation basis. The most therefore that we feel justified in agreeing to is a suggestion to Sultan that if he gives us most favoured nation treatment in new treaty we will if he desires approach French and U.S.A. governments on his behalf with a view to modification of present treaty restrictions to moderate extent. 3. We still think that there can be little if any/any advantage in attempting to set off British coEQiaercial rights in Morocco against French treaty rights in Muscat 'but are content to leave decision to His Majesty f s Govern ment • s judgment. gotqrmmm! op imik.55/86 Telegram Q From Political Resident, Bushire.

I do not think that Gwadur, as suggested by Mr.Garoe, can be regarded as a Dependency since it is an integral part of the Sultans territories. Since Mr. Caroe^ remarks were written Sultan has prolonged the Treaty# Paragraph 1« Mr. Caroe*s remarks. The present position is that in Muscat subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf in practice come under fche jurisdiction of the / Preamble. Article 1. Article 2.r*-l fH' 1 X the Political Agent, Tide ray letter No.116-3, dated the 13th February 1936, and comeoted corres pondences On the whole I think it would be desirable for this class of individual to remain under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. This can be done in two ways» either (a) by maJcing no alteration in the draft text and trusting that the Sultan will make no objection to the present practice continuing, or (b) by suggesting the necessary alteration. If we suggest (b) it will bring the matter to the Sultan's notice and he will probably object. I am therefore in favour of (a). at If,/any time, the Sultan wiskea to take Ms stand on the actual text of this Article then this class will fall under his jurisdiction, and I do not think that this matters much. At Kuwait, e,g* this class as being Moslem, comes under the Shaikh , s j uri sdict ion. Immediately and unconditionally * Ho obj ection to omission* Which shall not be harmful to the Sultanate etc. This is a very sweeping exception which should be strongly resisted# It seems to me to undermine very largely the privileges accorded by this Articleo If it is retained it seems to me that there is nothing to prevent the Sultan stating that any privilege is harmful to the State and must therefore cease# Pararaph 2. Ho comments* Art icle /-4- Artiole I agree with Mr# Canoe's Tiews that it may be inconTenient |to imke postings of Political Agents to Muscat subject to the usual formalities but since the Sultan is an independent sovereign and our representative at Muscat is already a Consul as well as a Political Agent I do not think that we can object« Article 4 » Paragraph !• Sxcept that special permission shall have t o be obtained etc » It is of course quite natural for the Sultan to wish to prevent British subjects from entering the hinterland, over which he has no control, nor do we want our subjects to go into these areas® As worded, however, this proviso will give the Sultan power to prevent British subjects from going anywhere whatsoever, including ports, and it is in ports that British Indian traders carry on their activities^ I think this proviso should be altered so as to cover the hinterland only 0 Oaission of all kinds&gt; I do not think we need object to this omission in this part of the Article but see my remarks against paragraph 3 # Paragraph 2. This is too sweeping and gives the Sultan too much latitude. The articles in question should be specified and this can /they could be included under three headings (a) drugs, (b) alcohol and (c) Arms and Ammunition^ Paragraph I agree with Mr.Oaroe that this paragraph is extremely dangerous. The unrestricted use of it by the Sultan might lead to cessation of all trade in the hands of British Indian subjects in any particular commodity. For instance, rice is largely imported through British Indian traders^ A monopoly of this commodity to a Muscati subject would take the rice trade completely out of British Indian hands® We should make every effort to have this paragraph dropped or, at all events, the flowers contained in it considerably restricted^ Article 5 &gt; 1 agree with MroGaroe 1 s views® Article 6 0 Paragraph !• Or on the produce of the Sultan 1 s dominions * This would seem an unusual proviso in an Article dealing with Customs duty as it refers to goods produced in one part of the Sultan's territory and transpor ted to another part, ajqy duty on which should come under the heading of Octroi, not Customs. Me need not, however, raise any objection as this provides a safeguard that British subjects shall not pay any Octroi higher than that paid by the Sultan's subjects or those cf the most favoured nation© This /I -6- This duty shall be paid at the port in the Sultanas dominiona etc « This sentence refers (a) to goods an d merchandise imported from foreign countries as well a a (b) to the produce of the Sultan 1 s dominions. At the end of this paragraph it is stated that both classes shall be exempt from all such Customs duties, the word Oustoms being used to cover tax on both (a) and ( b) • But though the correct term for the tax on (a) is Customs, that for the tax on (b), since the produce is of the Sultan's territory itself, should be Octroi . Article 6 of the existing Treaty this confusion does not exist snd the draft Article might be reworded so as to draw a distinction between Customs and Octroi.

If the other charges are common practice then they might be agreed to but not otherwise, though I agree with Mr, Garoe that these charges are capable of being abused. In Persia, for instance, the Customs charges (as apart from duty) have been made exorbitant. See remarks against Article 4 paragraph 3. This Article is objectienable. The unrestricted right of the 3ultan to charge what dues he likes is only curtailed by the control of the Special Board. There is no mention that there will be British representatives on this Board and, even if they are appointed they will^/doubtless be in the minorityo I agree with Mr. Caroe that every effort should be made to continue the present arrangements, which, after all^ cost the Sultan nothing. British shipping is mainly concerned as it is only the British India Steam Naviga tion Oompahy who make regular calls at Muscat# ifl i Article 8.// il -8- Article I agree with the Political Agent's remaX'^s that this Article should have formed part of Article 6 but as the Sultan wishes it to be separate we can agreeo Paragraph lo As far as I know it is general custom in these days to pay in cash and this can be agreed to© Paragraph 2# There must of course be some method of assessing value but personally I am not clear what 'ready money market price^ exactly meanso Is it, for instame, the retail or the wholesale price ? The last i)art of this paragraph ' beginning tt and in that of native goods etc. 1 * really relates to an Octroi, and not a Customs, duty (see remarks against Article 6 paragraph l). Paragraph If as suggested by Major Watts and MroCaroe the expression *ready money market price 1 * disappears from this Article then there is no check on the Tariff Board in assessing prices. Some check there should be though perhaps something less dubious than ^ready money market price'* should if possible be deTised. Paragraph 4o At first sight it might appear that the reference to the two experts infringes /«*0«» infringes on the powers of the Tariff Board. The two experts, however, would, I suppose, determine the dutiable value of any particular consignment under the prescribed tariff which has been fixed by the Tariff Board, As this paragraph forma a check on arbitrary assessment by the Customs authorities it should from our point of view be retained Article 9 e Ho comments. Article 10 e Ho objection to the slight alterations in this Article# Article 11 # In this Article two different classes of persons are dealt with, deserters from (a) His Majesty^ Ships (b) merchant vessels. With regard to (a) such individuals will always be British subjects! but the offence is one punishable under the Haval Discipline Act, which has not been made applicable to Muscat by the Muscat Order in Council. Such deserters therefore do not appear to come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. Similarly, persons under (b) do not prima facie commit a criminal offence in deserting, which is merely a breach of contract, and therefore also do not fall under the criminal jurisdiction of the Political Agent. I suggest accordingly that the whole of this Article be deleted from the new Treaty, especially as the Sultan 1 e claim for reciprocal rights cannot, as Mr.Caroe points out, be accorded. Article 12/-. * th 1 * -10- Article 12 * Paragraph l® In so far as tMs Article will, as Mr.Caroe points out, render British subjects liable to taxation, the danger is that the Sultan being a completely autocratic Huler, actual discrimination might well be 'made against British subjects under coTer of a law which purports to be fair to all affected. What one has to remember in regard to this Article^ and others giTing increased power to the Sultan to deal with British subjects^ is that it may well be his general future policy to try and force British subjects to leaTe his territory by transferring the benefits if trade from their hands to those of has own subjects. This, from his point of view, is quite understandable but, from our point of view, should of course be guarded against as much as possible# We have had an unfortunate experience in Persia in the direction of British Indian traders having to leave the country partly owing to the restrictions placed on their activities by the Persian Grovernment. With regard to the example given by Mr.Caroe of imposition by the Sultan of an income tax, this or any other tax imposed / -...lit# -11. imposed by tlie Sultan would ha^e to be enforced through the Political Agent's Courto This of course is some safeguard against dis crimination as if discrimination were proved the Court could refuse to enforce the tax. With regard to cases of dispute betvreen British subjects and members of other Christian nations. I agree with Mr. Garoe that in presert circumstances such cases will be few. If, however, a flourishing Oil Company, by reason of the Petroleum Concessions Limited Oil concession, springs up in Muscat, as it has in Bahrain, then such cases may increase, but to no great extent as Petroleum Concessions Limited employees will be mainly British subjects. The Company itself, being a British Corporation, claims of British against employees^/it will be decided in the Political Agents Court, an important point. If, however, the Sultan grants a concession to a foreign Company e.g* for oil in Gwadur, which is not covered by the Petroleum Concessions Limited concession, or for any other activity other than oil in any part of his dominions, both the Company and its foreign employees would not in ai^y way be under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. This, however, is the situation even under the existing Treaty. Paragraph 2./lit 42- Paragraph 2» I agree with Mr. Garoe 1 s r lews. We have all the more ground for insisting that the existing safeguard should continue as it does not affect the final decision of the Sultan's Gourbut merely ensures that before this final decision is given the Consul or his representa tive should have been given an oppor tunity of attending the trial# Paragraph 3® In practice this paragraph introduces nothing new. Even under present conditions^since the Political Agent has no police at his disposal for the arrest of individuals under his juris diction or to prevent a threatened breach of the peace, action to these ends must be left to the Muscat Govern ment . I am of opinion, therefore, that this paragraph should not be objected tOo I agree generally with Mr.Garoe's views and I think that if the employees in question are limited to those of the that Consulates/the Sultan may agree.

We agree that the position ought to be regularised in respect both of 'municipal' and of other taxation, but we hesitated to add to the draft telegram the paragraph suggested in your letter from a feeling that, if the action it contemplated were taken, trouble might be caused by British subjects assuming that if nothing was said about the other taxes they were entitled to refuse to pay them. After consultation with your Department the telegram was sent off without the suggested paragraph, but Powle, with whom we have discussed the matter, has undertaken to go into the whole question after his return to the Gulf, and will let us have his views in due course.

Dear Baggallay, Would you please refer to your letter of the 18th iv ! j&gt; p, aM- ^ August, No.E.4038/1865/91 regarding the suggestion that the Question of French treaty rights in Muscat might he linked with the question of British capitulatory and commercial rights in Morocco. ^ I enclose for your information a copy of a letter [6th Octoher. ) containing the Government of India's views, and 22nd October. ) a copy of a telegram received later from the ) Acting Political Resident, Bushire. You will see that, as regards French rights in Muscat, the Government of India are not in favour of linking this question with that of British rights in Morocco, on the ground that if the French should surrender their rights before the negotiations for the revision of the British treaty with Muscat are concluded we should be in a weaker bargaining position vis Vvis Muscat, (incidentally it may be pointed out that the French treaty with Muscat refers not to French goods but t0 / pggallay, Esq. , Foreign Office, S.W. 1. Y SENT TO— I S- ^ -10-1 to goods car rued in French vessels), Caroe in his telegram of 22nd October suggests however that a readiness to assist in securing favours from the French for the Sultan would help us hy making it easier to secure the retention of our extra-territorial rights in Muscat.

J-4 Muscat Treaty. Reference correspondence ending with our telegram No.314, ^ dated the 17th February 1938. 2. e agree generally with Fowle'a views on the draft treaty subject to the following cocaments.Cjhe articles referred to axe those of the draft treaty.) Irticla 2 . The term 'Indian States' should be substituted for the obsolete term 'Native States'. Article 3 . -fe have no objection in principle to the appointment of a Consul for Muscat in India, but have consulted the Sind Government ax we understand that it is the Sultan's wish that a Consul should be appointed at Karachi. We will comnunicate our final views when we have received a reply from the Sind Government L- Artiala 11./- 2 - ilrticle 11. We support Fowls'a recommendations that this article should be deleted provided suitable arrangements can be made with the Sultan apart from the Treaty for the recovery of deserters from British ships of war and their handing over to the Naval authorities. Desertion from British merchant vessels is an offence under section 2E1 of the Merchant Shipping 'ct, 1894, and in the case of vessels registered in British India under section 100 of the Indian Merchant Slipping Act of 1923. Both these Acta aire applicable to Muscat, and the Political igent can deal with offences under them under Article 12. No special provision in the Treaty is therefore necessary. .rticle 12 . We should not, it is considered, agree to the British subjects receiving worse treatment than that accorded under treaty to subjects of other countries so long as the treaties concerned remain in force in , , , , „ their present form. In this connection attention is , invited to Article 6 of the Treaty between Muscat and United States of iteiarica, * and Articles 3 and 6 of the , q : ^ .. r Treaty between liiscat and Prance. This consideration also applies in the case of Articles 15 and 17.I'S i Article 15 . The draft of paragraph 2 as it stands clearly nine counter to the existing law in British India. In the first place section 57 of the Jtoinistrator General's Act, 1913 (assuming that the section is rendered operative ^is-a-vis subjects of the Sultan of Muscat) will have no application when a Muscat subject dies outside British India leaving property in British India, not #ian there is a person other than the Administrator General entitled to apply for letters of adninistration. Secondly, the draft article if given effect to would mean that even in respect of immoveable property of the deceased the disposition will be govered by the Muscat Law. This is diametrically opposed to the law as administtred in British India and equally to English Law. It will be seen from Section 5 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, that the British Indian law takes no notice of the nationality of the deceased in the matter of succession, the detemining 4k factor being the domicile of the deceased, and even if it is assumed that most of the bultan s subjects will be domiciled in Muscat, still in respect of the immoveable property left by enyaudi in British India, the property will have to be disposed of in accordance mth the Br it iA Indian law and not in accordance with Muscat law. As for moveable property it can be disposed of by the proposed Muscat Consul, if letters of administration are granted to him by a competent British Indian Court, in accordance with the Muscat law provided the subject ot Muscat oonc^med was domiciled in Muscat at the time of his death. Under the first paragraph of this draft article British subjects acquire a right similar to #iat the second paragraph seeks to acquire for Muscat subjects and if the pnnoiple of strict reciprocity is accepted no exception could be taken to the second para graph of this article. But the all important fact remains that if the article as drafted is accepted, legislation will have to be undertaken in order to confer special rights on Muscat subjects residing, or possessing property in British India, a right ishichhas not so fax been conferred upon subjects of any other State. In the circunistances, we cannot accept paragraphs 2 of the draft as it stands. Rather than do 00 we should be willing to agree to some modification of paragraph 1, It may perhaps be found possible to re-word the «hole Article so as to leave matters in practice much as they are at present without offending the Sultan's susceptibilities. ¥e should have no objection to adding Muscat to the countries mentioned in the Schedule of Home Department Notification No.P.620/32, dated the 25th July 1932 (copy enclosed^ provided the Sultan grants similar or greater facilities in respect of the property of British subjects dying in Muscat. Article 19. We agree that the article as it stands is undesirable and suggest that if possible the Sultan should be persuaded to drop it on a verbal assurance that any request of his for the expulsion of a British subject will be sympathetically considered byt the Political Agent. If the Sultan cannot be persuaded to drop it we suggest that a proviso might be added as follows? 'provided satisfactory evidence of such action of an alien is furnished to the same Consular authority'. Article 22. We suggest that if His Majesty 's Government consider it desirable tha article might be redrafted on more modern lines, c.f. paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 37 of the Anglo-Rumanian Treaty of 1930. 3. Our comments will follow shortly on Articles 4 to 8 and 20 of the draft treaty. Excluding these we have nothing to add to Powle's coianents on any of the Articles of the draft treaty not specifically mentioned above. mumf-trn-imm.-m mm****-**- . ■ The issue of the above has been authorised.

We agree generally with Sir Trenchard Fowle's views on Articles 4 to 8 and 20 of the draft treaty subject to the following comments: Article 4 . As regards paragraph 2, it is desirable that 'most favoured nation' treatment should be provided for in respect of import and export prohibitions and. restrictions. In this connection attention is invited to the remarks against Article 12 in our express letter referred to above, c.f. Article 2 of the Treaty between Muscat and United States of America, and Article 11 of the Treaty between Muscat and France. Article 6. (a). The Article provides only for 'most favoured nation' treatment of goods imported by British subjects. It is considered that provision should also be made for the 'moat favoured nation' treatment of goods of the contracting parties. (b)vt 5) (b) The draft of paragraph 3 of the exemptions aeems to cover all Naval and Royal Mr Force requirements, but it is suggested that in the case of the latter, Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq, should be consulted. (c) With reference to the last paragraph, it is considered that British subjects should be exempted from payment of customs weighing charges; if this is not possible it is suggested that a provision should be inserted that such charges will be on a low scale and that their incidence will not be raised. In this connection, attention is invited to paragraph 2 of letter to Bushire No .F.432-1^/37, dated the 18th September 1937, copies of which were forwarded in our weekly letter No.82-M, dated the 23rd September 1937. It is also considered that there should be some safeguard in respect of the other miscellaneous charges dealt with in the last paragraph of the article, e.g. that they will not exceed the actual cost of the services they are intended to cover. Article 20 . We agree that this Article requires revision and suggest that it might be re-drafted on modern lines, c.f. articles 34 and 35 of the Anglo-Roumanian Coamercial Treaty of 1930. It appears from the draft as it stands that India is included among 'foreign posseBsions'. As the proposed treaty will presumably be concluded by His llajesty's Government jointly on behalf of the United Kingdom and India there will be no necessity to include India airiong the parts of the Sapire in the accession clause. The issue of the above has been authorised. Deputy Secretary D t of India.^5/86 Telegram From Political Resident, Bushire. To Secretary of State for India, London.

Similarly Articles 2 and 10 of the French Treaty put the French on an equal footing with the Arsericans. The wording of Article 2 paragraph 2^like all the other Articles of the draft Treaty^ which hae been prepared by the Sultan himself} has a very wide iiaplication and is most categorical, and would seen to override any possible preferential advantages or privileges given to French or Jtaerican subjects by their respective Treaties which are not specifically accorded to British subjects in those Articles of the draft Treaty in which the phrase 'most favoured nation* might have been included, but has been omitted. Article 15 . Death of a British subject. In the Anerican Treaty Article 8 covers the administration of a deceased American's estates. In the French Treaty under A r ticle 7 there is also provision for the administration of the estates of French subjects by the French Oonsul at Muscat. So mention is made, however, of the law under whioh estates of deceased /Confidential. Restricted. Open. Draft.m -2- deceased parties whether Preach or Acjerican are adiainiatered. In the draft Treaty, on the contrary, administration of the estate of a Muacati dying in British territory is carried out according to Muscat Law, and that of a British subject who dies in Muscat territory, according to the provisions of the English Law. Article 17 ♦ Municipal taxation# In the ikuerican Treaty Article 6 provides that American citizens residing in Muscati ports shall not pay any tax etc# other than the general duties on ixaports which the most favoured shall pay# In the French Treaty under Article 10, imported goods which have paid an import duty may be sold without paying any further duty. Under Article 2 of the same Treaty French subjects anywhere in the State of Muscat have all the privileges which are enjoyed by the most favoured nation. The draft Treaty, however, allows for municipal taxes to be levied on all residents without distinction of nationality. In consequence both French and the United States of America are better favoured nations than Great Britain, and again recourse could be had to Article 2 paragraph 2 of the draft Treaty to level conditions to the standard of those of the w most favoured nation^.

In addition to the Articles already dealt with the following A r ticles would also seem to be covered by A r ticle V Article 19 o Article 20 . t i c1e 22 .2 paragraph 2* Article 7» Sultan's right to charge shipping dues. The word ,, iinpoat rt of Article 2 paragraph 2 covers this. In this connection please see remarks under Article 12. Aytiole 8 . Valuation of imported merchandize. It might be argued that this is covered by the word ^obligation 11 of Article 2 paragraph 2. In this connection please see remarks under Article 12. 4. finally there are the following few points which strike me as regards the draft Treaty© (a) Article 15 * Bankruptcy is not covered in the American Treaty. In the French Treaty, however, Article 8 deals with this subject. In the draft Treaty the words 11 according to the provisions of English Bankruptcy Law 11 occur, while no such reference to the French bankruptcy Law occurs in the French Treaty. It may be that this is not an important point, (b) Article 16. Right of eearoh of British subjects' houses etc. % similar Article exists in the Anerioan Treaty. In the French Treaty, however, under A^tiole 3 there is a similar prorision to the draft Treaty, ^e only difference being that under the draft Treaty the occupier may give permiaaion for search whereas under /5- under the Preach Treaty the French Gonsul's pennission is imperative. ad« T.G.Fowle.

Papers are being sent by mail today to indicate progress made in discussions with Sultan of Muscat for revision of 1891 treaty. Sultan has now left for Paris but is expected to return next Wednesday when dis cussions will be continued. It has been impressed on him that discussions are only informal and that any draft discuss- ed here is subject to further views of His Majesty^ Govern ment and Government of India.

XXX X X A number of matters were discussed, the chief oi Which ware as follows ; (1) T he n ew Trea ty. Secretary explained to the Sultan that though the Government of India were interested in the Treaty in view of the proximity of the two countries, it was really a matter concerning His Majesty's G-overmnent, since this and other Treaties had been in the past concluded between Great Britain and the Sultans of Muscat. He wished therefore the Sultan clearly to understand that though the Government of India would sympathetically consider the various proposals put forward by the Sultan m the Draft Treaty and would give their opinion on them to His Majesty s Government, they could not of course say whether they would be finally acceptable or not. The Sultan said he quite understood the situation*f&lt;r% ^Sxtract from Mote of a discussion neld on 17-11^57 between Sir Aubrey Metoalfe, Secretary, External Affairs department, and His Highness tne Bolt an of Muscat, at wnicii tne political Agent, Muscat, was iilso present* x x (2) Frolon£ation_of_1891_Treatx. As regards the prolongation of the existing Treaty for one year pending the final negotiations and ratification of the new Treaty, Secretary explained to His Highness theimpossibility of being able to conclude the new Treaty before February next year when the present one expires and the undesirability of having a period in which there would be no Treaty between the two countries. His Highness agreed, but asked for some concessions in the terms of the present Treaty. Secretary pointed out that His Majesty's Government had novif agreed to the imposition on British subjects of the new Muscat Municipal Tax and previously (in 1934) had permitted the Sultan to raise his Custom Tariffs, though he had bound himself by the Treaty not to do so. His esty's Government had also used their good offices on behalf of the Sultan with the French Republic and with some difficulty persuaded them to modify their rights under their o?m Treaty in this connection. The Sultan promised that he would agree to prolong the existing Treaty of 1891 for another year or until such time as the new Treaty should have been concluded and rati fied whichever was less. It was decided that the Political igent,, Muscat, should address a letter to the Sultan informing him of the ^^eement of His Majesty's G-overnment to this Municipal and the Sultan would then reply that he was willing to P r olong the Treaty for one year more on the conditions stated above#Political Agency &amp; 1^ British Consulate, Muscat, 3rd January 1938. 1USHIWE HESIBENCY.
