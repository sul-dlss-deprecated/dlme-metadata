You also seemed to have failed to perceive that, in writing as you did, you were acting most disrespectful towards me, by reviving the discussion of a question which I had declared settled, and indirectly asserting that I was misleading Government in a matter of great political importance, by laying before them only a one-sided view of the case which you sought to correct, notwithstanding you must have been aware that from long experi ence on the Frontier, and with Khelat affairs, I was necessarily better aware of what had happened before, and what was required now, than you could possibly be after a local ex perience of little more than 15 months, and from information only derived from documents. I let that pass, however, and consented to re-discuss the subject, that there might be no appearance even of checking ventilation of ideas, and in the hope that the explanation I took the trouble to offor would convince you of the mistake you had made. Unfortunately you seem to have been unable to appreciate my motives, and to have determined to continue the wrong course, in spite of my objections thereto; and now you have openly attacked the Khan, and the Political Agent at his Court, notwithstanding that the former has done everything he possibly could to conform to the wishes of the Govern ment, and the latter has ably and satisfactorily acted up to the instructions given him and ordered for his guidance by Government. I do most distinctly designate it as active interference with the Khan, and interfe rence of a most objectionable nature, when you accuse the Political Agent at his Court of partizanship, forbid him to comment favorably on what is passing, and attribute to the Khan all manner of motives and intentions for which there is no proof whatever. Through out recent correspondence you have shown most marked antagonism against the Khan, and would put his conduct in the worst possible light before Government. It is very de sirable that one-sidedness should be avoided in official life, but care must be taken that, in attempting to avoid one, the other side is not seized upon, and above all things to be just. The evidence you allude to, so far from being plain and straightforward in support of your views, is quite the contrary. There is very much both in your own and all the other letters to show that there was not the slightest necessity for your drawing the con clusions you did in respect to Khelat affairs, the Khan's motives, and Captain Harrison's proceedings. Freedom of representation I should always most gladly encourage, when it is justly used, but you have certainly exceeded the bounds lately, and acted as none of your pre decessors would have done. It was my earnest desire to give you every support in your position as Political Su perintendent on the Frontier, and I fully did so, until you showed a determination to act in direct opposition to my expressed wishes. You misunderstand me when you suppose I meant you should have consulted Mac- aulev, because he became Assistant Political Superintendent. What I intended was, that you might have with great advantage consulted him, as one who had himself acted as Political Agent at a most critical time, who was intimately acquainted with Khelat affairs, having taken great interest in them during the seventeen years' service on the Frontier, and</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/22, f 143</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/22, f 143</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter from William Lockyer Merewether, Kurrachee [KarƒÅchi] to Colonel Robert Phayre</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1870/1870</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-29T16:23:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 folio</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Demi-official letter regarding the Colonel's response, dated 1 September 1870, to Merewether's letter of 28 August and again expressing his despair at the Colonel's inability to view his position 'in the proper light'.The letter goes on to remind Colonel Phayre that as his superior all communication and policy from him was to be observed and adhered to, and to state that neither he (Merewether), General John Jacob or Sir Henry Green ever persisted in adhering to their own views after having been informed to be wrong.The letter goes on to state that he had fully concurred with Colonel Phayre endeavouring to settle Moolla Mahomed [Mullah Mohammed]'s differences with the Khan of Khelat, but that Moollah Mahomed's decision to reject the clemency offered by the Khan meant that there was nothing more British officer's could do for him, and that the Colonel should have from them onwards refused to meet or correspond with him, and should not have persisted with the idea that Moolla Mahomed and other Sirdars had been unfairly treated by the Khan.The letter also discusses opinions expressed in reports and official correspondence by Colonel Phayre that the Khan had continuosly behaved wrongly, that his arrangements for governing his country were wrong and that the British Government ought to withdraw their support; opinions which were in direct contravention to Government's orders.The letter continues by discussing what Merewether views as having become an open attack on the Khan of Khelat and the Political Agent at his court and that his actions in this matter are considred as active interference with the Khan, particularly in having accused the Political Agent of partizanship and forbidding him to comment favourably on what was occuring in Khelat.The letter concludes with Merewether explaining further what he had meant by his references to Colonel Phayre having failed to take advantage of using the knowledge of Khelat accumulated by George William Macauley; and the reasoning behind his terminology in relation to Captain Robert Sandeman.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
