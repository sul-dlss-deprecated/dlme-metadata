In continuation of previous correspondence I have the honour to submit estimates approved by the General Officer Commanding, for the current and coming financfal Vear in respect of expenditure of the Medical, Sanitary and Jail Depart ments of the Basrah Administration, together with explanatory covering letters from the Civil Surgeon, Basrah, who has prepared them in communication with the Assistant Director, Medical Services. 2. Proposals for Quarantine Department have been submitted separately by telegraph. 3 Sanitary and medical work is of such paramount importance to the welfare of the force, and it is on political grounds so necessary that we should give the people at large a better medical and sanitary administration that I have no hesita tion in commending Major Scott’s propoials for the favourable consideration of Government. The proposals contained in the enclosed estimates have already been partially given effect to, in anticipation of sanction, under the instructions of the Gen ® ® Officer Commanding and the entertainment of a proportion of the temporary stafi has also been sanctioned bv the General Officer Commanding. On receipt of the formal sanction of the Government of India, which will I trust be communicated by telegraph to the enclosed propo als, they will be gradually given efiect to by the Civil Surgeon as circumstances require, subject to the gener 1 control of the Assist- ant Director of Medical Services, Indian Expeditions y loice D .

Inspectors are absolutely essential both for the health of the civil and mili- Sanitary. tary population. The isolation hospital suggested is the former municipal (chiefly lock) hospi tal. It is on the outskirts of the town and at the same time accessible. Epidemics of plague (which has already appeared), cholera, small-pox and diphtheria have to be taken into consideration. The advisability of encouraging vaccination aginst small-pox, to which the people are a ready to some extent accustomed is most essential. Jail 4. The present jail in use is the old Turkish one. - It is a very strong jail and though not constructed in accordance with our standards, yet as a temporary measure, it might continue to be utilised as a prison. The question of building a new jail on modern principles should be considered as soon as possible. The continuance of a British non-commissioned officer as Head Jailer at present is in my opinion advisable. 5. These items include besides actual medicines and dressings the necessary Medicines, Surgical and General Equipment. ex P en diture on surgical instruments and equipment, as operating tables, steri lisers, microscope and the various instruments required for eye, and general surgery.

I have gone over the statements carefully with Major Scott, I.M.S., and consider that they include the minimum requirements for the satisfactory medical administration of Basrah. 3 . The salaries of the Civil Assistant Surgeon and Civil- Sub-Assistant Surgeons proposed by the Director-General, Indian Medical Service and sanctioned by the General Officer Commanding Indian Expeditionary Force “ D ’’are double the pay they draw in India and that of the Sanitary Inspector Rs. 100 per mensem, rising by annual increments of Rs. 5, to Rs. 150 per mensem, all to receive free quarters. The rent of their quarters has not been included in the estimate. I am doubtful as to the necessity of employing a Lady-doctor, but having no experience regar ding the conditions of medical work locally am prepared to accede to her inclusion if you consider her entertainment advisable. 4. The estimates regarding medicines, surgical instruments and equipments generally of Civil Hospitals of Basrah, Outdoor Dispensaries of Basrah and Ashar and Jail of Basrah have been arrived at arbitrarily, as with the absence of records of former experience there is little to assist us in framing these estimates. Should the allotments proposed be made, their expenditure should be regulated by the amount and nature of the medical work carried on. 5.

Subject to following conditions the proposals with regard to local police which were submitted with your letter of the 30th March are sanctioned. (1) That sanction is granted for one year and subject to reconsideration thereafter of emoluments and strength of force in light of experience meanwhile gained. (2) That apart from contingent from Aden, strength v;hich is now sanctioned is the maximum which is permissible for period mentioned above and that with due r^ard to strict economy local officers will work within it. (3) That the detailed estimates as referred to in my letter 1335-Est.A., dated 15th June, paragraph 2 are submitted at an early date to the Governmentof Indja. ! (4) That no more men are imported from India so far as possible but that expenditure on local force is correspondingly reduced should it be found absolutely ; necessary to obtain men from India. Local action in enlisting 50 % of proposed strength is confirmed. Presumably the enlistment of Kurds is intended to be within the total strength of local force now sanctioned.

The land on which Basrah stands is flat and very little above the level of the River, when high. It is consequently liable to ir^undation in years like the present, and at no time, even in normal years, is uhe subsoil water more than a few feet below the surface. No attempt has been made in the past at drainage, and the sewer system in vogue, if it can be called a system, consists in the construction of separate cesspools and cesspits for each house, with the consequence that the whole site of the town is undermined with sewage. Some of the filth finds its way, either directly throughmain proportion of the inhabitants obtain their drinking water, and pollutes them. As might be expected, typhoid and other fevers prevail at all seasons, and epidemics of plague and cholera are of frequent occurrence. 3 e x recently called a meeting of representatives of Government Departments and of the Civil population, both notables and merchants, under the presidency of the Chief Political Officer, for the ventilation 01 ideas as to the directions in which improvements were necessary or possible; and those present were unanimous- r ly of opinion that the provision of a healthy water- supply for the town is a matter of first importance, affecting the welfare of the populace more than any other project which could be mentioned. With this view I am in full accord, and my object ifnow addressing Government is to obtain the concurrence of the Government of India to the project in principle and to request, as a first step towards its inception, that the Government of India will be pleased to select and send up an expert to study the problem on the spot and to draw up a Scheme suitable to local conditions and requirements. 4. I may mention that Schemes of water-works for Basrah have apparently been under consideration of the Turk! six( Turkish Government for the last 20 years. The laou of these appears to have received the approval of the Basrah Authorities and was on the point of submission to the Turkish Government about two years ago when the Concessionaire suddenly died. The plans and estimates drawn up at the time have been placed at my disposal oy the courtesy of a brother of the deceased Concessionaire. These may not be of a very reliable description, but they should furnish useful data to the Engineer who is called upon to investigate the projecu. 5 . The cost both of the preliminary survey and of carrying out the Scheme eventually adopted, should ultimately, in my opinion, be a charge on the Hevenues of the Basrah Municipality and I should hope that the project would eventually become a self-supporting municipal enterprise. In the first place, however, the expenses incurred in the inception of the Scheme might be met from the Revenues of the Vilayet if the curren income of the Municipality cannot yet provide the wherewithal*Copy of a telegram from tlie Secretary to the Government of India, Army Department, to tne General Officer Commanding, Indian Expeditionary Force D , Basrah, No.H-7557, dated the 7th September 1915.

Please see my telegram, dated November 27th, 65 B. Arrangements with Gray Mackenzie have worked satisfactorily on the whole, and hitherto no change has been possible, as military authorities have been unable to surrender customs premises and wharves. This however is now feasible owing to reduction at Basrah itself. At the same juncture opening of river to Amara and commencement of date season have produced sudden increase of trade with which Messrs.

The Governor in Council has, ther^refaiided Vat Mr Pi^pay should be fixed at Rs. 300 per mensem and that of Mr. Cleary at Rs. 250 per mensem. Mr. Cleary is not prepared to go to Basrah on a less pay. Mr. Johnstone’s monthly average allowances for overtime and rewards during the last two years amount to Rs. 97. He is thus entitled to a salary of Rs. 386. His salary has, therefore, been fixed at Rs. 390. The remaining officers are all in the Rs. 125 grades. Messrs. Nelmes and Green were only recently appointed to this grade. The average overtime fees drawn by the other five officers during the last year amount to Rs. 71, but their earnings were considerably affected by the war and by the fact that two of the five officers were on volunteer duty which prevented them on occasions from performing overtime work to which they would otherwise have been posted. They, therefore, request that for the purpose of calculating their pay the fees drawn by the officers in the Rs. 125 grade during the year 1913-14, viz., Rs. 85 per mensem, should be taken into account. It is fair to adopt the average of both the years which works out to Rs. 78 per mensem. On this basis the salary to be given to the seven Preventive Officers in question comes to Rs. 264 and this Government has fixed it at Rs. 260 per mensem. 3. The Bombay house allowance at the rate of Rs. 10 per cent, of their pay admissible to these officers has not been taken into account in calculating the amounts of their salaries. 4. I am now to request that the Government of India may be moved to confirm the action taken by this Government. No. 8569, dated Bombay Castle, the llth August 1915. From—G. S.

Watkins left Bombay for Basrah on Friday the 6 th instant by the British India Company’s Mail Steamer “ Chakla ” and that, owing to lack of accommodation on board ship, eight officers only could accompany him. The remaining two officers will follow by the next week’s mail steamer. I am to add that four officers were provided with second class accommodation at the rate of Rs. 120 for each and by special arrangement with the shipping company the other four officers were provided with first class cabin accommodation and second class saloon accommodation at the rate of Rs. 180 for each.(COPY) Telegram From - The Hon*ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P.

('ox has represented that he has for some time been overworked and understaffed, that his sphere of work and routine duties at headquarters has so greatly increased as to hamper his mobility, his time is much occupied by personal interviews and he finds considerable difficulty in keeping correspondence up to date. He has asked for an officer of sufficient seniority to run his office and to act with authority as his deputy when absent. We strongly support his request in view of the volume and importance of his work. He has at present attached to him at headquarters only Captain Wilson and Mr. Edmonds, neither of whom is of sufficient standing to act as deputy. We fully realise desirability of keeping staff down to minimum, but we are satisfied that local arrangements are not possible and that temporary assistance is imperative. We therefore propose deputation for three months in the first instance of senior officer of Political Department on following terms:--(a) Time scale pay. (b) Consolidated remunerative allowance of Ks. 300 per mensem, (e) Travelling allowance on scale admissible to Consuls and Political , gents in the Persian Gulf (d) Language allowance if admissible under existing rules, {e) Outfit allowance Rs. 500 if transferred from India.

If 50 Muham madan Constables, with the necessary complement of non-commissioned officers cannot be obtained from the Punjab, I beg to urge that endeavours should be made to get them from the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh or other provinces. Knowledge of Arabic need not be taken into account; it is not found to be matter of necessity : and in any case contingent from Aden will provide sufficiency of Arabic-knowing men. 44 Telegram, No. 1102 Est.-A, dated Simla, the 18th May 1915.

It is presumed that telegram from General Officer Commanding, 39 I.-A dated 12th May, to Chief of General Staff, regarding supply of more police from India was sent after consultation with you, but it would be more con venient if such references were sent through you to this Department, which deals with practically all questions of Basrah civil administration. While fully realising desirability of relieving regular troops of watch and ward duties, there are following difficulties in way of getting further police:— ( 1 ) Expense. (2) Punjab cannot spare any men and it is doubtful whether in view of internal conditions we can fairly press United Provinces or other provinces to supply them.o ia (3) Even if requisite number is forthcomng, we should be disinclined to pay Indian Police at rates sanctioied for Aden contingent, more especially as they would not knorc Arabic. There would thus be differential scales of pay in Incian nucleus, which would pro bably cause dissatisfaction.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Polities Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 30th of March 1915, with which you submit, for the consideration of the Government of India, an estimate for the pay of the police establishment to he locally enlisted ill the Basrah district. 2. It is understood that the object of your reference is merely to obtain the sanction of the Government of India to the establishment and the rates of pay set forth in the estimate, and that the Government of India may expect to receive, when these important and preliminary matters have been decided, a complete estimate of the cost of the Basrah police, showing separately the permanent and temporary establishments and prepared in the usual form, i.e.y under the minor heads of Salaries, Establishment, Allowances, Supplies and Services, and Contingencies. I am to enquire whether this assumption is correct, and, in regard to the proposals which you have submitted, to address you as follows. 3. In framing a scheme for the establishment of a police force at Basrah three cardinal considerations must be borne in mind : ( 1 ) the necessity for strict economy, ( 2 ) the Secretary of State’s injunction that no attempt should be made at present to transform the 'Wilayat into an Indian district, and (3) • the practical impossibility of reducing at any future date the scale of establish ment and pay that may now he sanctioned.21 Though the establishment proposed by Mr. Gregson purports to provide territorrially for (a) Basrah City, (b) Ashar Port and the Northern area of the Wilayat, and (c) Abdul Khasib and the Southern area of the Wilayat, it is understood that for some time its responsibilities will be for the most part confined to the town of Basrah and its environs. If this is the case, the numbers* contemplated would appear to be unduly large, more specially when they are compared with the force of police employed in a town in the Punjab with a population approx imately equal to that of Basrah, which would ordinarily be— • Station House officers Investigatiug officers Line officer Jauaadar Head Constables Inveslig'Vting Constables Foot Constables Dafadars ... Mounted sowars 3 6 1 1 27 30 440 2 60 For watch and ward and investi- Inspector. Sub-Inspectors. Head Constables. Foot Constables. gating duties. Reserve in the Headquarter lines for emergent duties, treasure escorts, magazine guards, 1 5 20 200 &amp;c. Add 15% of the total of Head Constables and Foot Constables for leave, men sick in 1 1 7 75 hospital, etc. ... • • • 4 45 Total ... 2 6 31 390 A considerable addition to the above numbers might be necessary if there were spacious or straggling suburbs occupied by Europeans or well-to-do people, but against this it must be remembered that for some time to come there will be a very considerable military garrison in Basrah whose presence alone must obviously contribute to the maintenance of law and order. Taking the proportion of police to population, I am to observe that in Madras and Bombay there is one policeman to every 295 and 344 inhabitants, respectively, whereas in Basrah the establishment proposed would give a ratio of police to the population (which may be taken at approximately one hundred thousand) of about 1 to 175. The Government of India are not unmindful of the facts that the men will be at the commencement inex perienced and untrained and that some expansion of their present respons ibilities will probably take place, but they will be glad if you would consider whether so large a force as 570 men, rank and file, is really necessary. 4. The scale of pay to be adopted for the various ranks must necessarily depend on local conditions. But in view of the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, I am to request that you will re-examine the rates of pay proposed, and in particular those for Head Constables, Dafadars and Constables. It is understood that the Sowars and Dafadars wall have their horses found and fed at Government expense. 5. It would appear desirable to consider, at the same time, the possibility of effecting some reduction in the numbers and pay of the ministerial establish ment set forth in the estimate, and also to review the necessity of paying water- carriers and sweepers, who wiU presumably be local men, so'much as°Bs. 20 and Its. 15 pe?' mensem, respectively. 6 . lam to express regret that it should be necessary to trouble you with a re-consideration of these proposals in the midst of your important and multifarious duties, but you will no doubt agree that it is most desirable to ) initiate the police scheme for Basrah on a well considered basis which will admit of subsequent expansion, with due regard to economy and the other principles laid down by His Majesty’s Government. F. &amp; P. Dept. Press—No. 1090—18-6-15.—44.From—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E.' 1 C.S.L Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and PoliticahDepart- ment, Delhi. Under Turkish Government regime there was separate Court known as Mahkemeh Sharia for dealing with “ religious matters ” relating to the Mos lems, e.g., cases relating to marriage, divorce, alimony, inheritance, and func tions of Court of Wards. For the present such cases will be dealt with by our Judicial Officers and it is matter of the greatest importance politically that they should be handled carefully and in accordance with local and customary law. To achieve this object it is considered advisable there should be attached to each Judicial Officer an Indian Muhammadan of suitable attainments, who would act as “ Sharia Adviser ”, and who might combine such duties with that of a Court Registrar. In both cases they must be men of proved ability and in tegrity. It is unlikely that competent man can be found on salary less than Rs. 1,000 monthly for senior Court and Rs. 500 to Rs. 600 for junior, and it is almost sine qua non that they should know Arabic. United Provinces of Agra and Oudh seem most likely field in which to find them. If article cannot be found in India, as I hope it will be, I think that we must go further afield, but if generally concurring with above, please enquire and let me know by telegraph what candidates are forthcoming.

Perhaps local conditions and require ments were not made quite clear. At present duties of watch and ward are being performed by troops of whom 240 are so employed. Their duties are mainly to pat* rol town and to protect it against raids from lawless gangs of Arabs from inside or suburbs; force for such work will oe only required for short time, but they must be men of fighting capacity. Apart from above a police force proper is being formed of local material, which will ultimately be from five hu ndred to si x hundred strong out of which about one hundred and fifty have been enlisted. The men that were asked for from India, were to set free the 240 sepoys for military duty proper. Gregson asked for 200 but requisition was reduced to 100 by General Officer Comnanding, as it is thought that strength of this branch could be gradually reduced as things quieted down under our regime. Their work is quite distinct from tnet of local police proper and knowledge of Arabic though would do useful accessory is not essential. What is essential is that they should be good fighting stamp. Any who after expiry of their terra want to remain per- manently would become absorbed into local police.Others after about a year would be gradually sent oack to India, Meanwhile being entirely under Gregson* s orders for disciplinary purposes and accustomed to his methods of training Indian men would form a nucleus and example for military training of local battalion. Having regard to above watch and ward purpose for which they are wanted their numbers could not be reduced below 100 and Indians from Punjab would be more effective and a much less complicated body to deal with than numbers of strange men from Egypt requiring to maintain families there and having eventually to be repatriated at the expense of Local. Governments. Under the circum stances set forth General Officer Commanding would prefer to adhere proposal for 100 good men from Punjab and trusting that they will be found as soon as possible, and also that deputation of assistant whose services were asked for in my telegram No. 316-3, may be arranged for at a very early da.e.Telegram R.

I would suggest pay and allowances for him at rate of one thousand and fifty pounds a year. Inspectors and Sub Inspectors Egyptians should have pay and allow ances at rate of two hundred and sixteen and one hundred and eighty pounds respectively. Non- Commissioned Officers and men of Egyptian Police are well paid at rates ranging from four pounds ten shillings to three pounds a month as Egyptians of their class are most reluctant to leave their country and will be necessary certainly to offer them inducements in shape of allowances etc iiQssibJxt total of those would probably work out at approxi mately seven thousand five hundred pounds per annum.

From— General Barrett, Basrah, via Fao, To—The Chief of the General Staff. That a police force should be organized for Basrah is a question of some urgency. Practically the whole of the personnel could be raised locally in time. I w ould, however, recommend that about 100 good police with the necessary proportion of superior ranks be drafted in as a temporary measure from Northern India for immediate police duty and as a nucleus for instruc tional purposes.

As men with the knowledge of Arabic are not obtainable in India, could you supply a force of good police from Egypt of more or less corresponding strength and ranks.

To The Most Honourable the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. My Lord Marquess, Delhi, the 5th March 1015, We have the honour to invite a reference to your Lordship’s Political despatch No. 1, dated the 2nd January 1911, conveying sanction to the deputation of Mr. J. M. K. Misick, an Assistant Superintendent of Police in the Punjab, on special duty in connection with the operations for the suppression of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf during the maintenance of the blockade and in place of Mr. E. G. Gregson, C.I.E., who had proceeded on leave. 2. On Mr. Gregson’s return from leave in September last he resumed charge, under our orders, of the special duty in question and Mr. Misick reverted to the Punjab. Owing to the war we have not been able to employ any ships for the suppression of the Arms Traffic and the blockade has con sequently been raised. Mr. Gregson’s deputation should, under the terms of sanction, have been simultaneously concluded. Rut the cessation of the blockade in no way removed the -necessity of maintaining the supervision exercised on land over the Arms Traffic, and Mr. Gregson’s services have, therefore, been retained for this purpose. Further it is, in our opinion, most desirable that he should continue for the present to watch and report on the state of the traffic. In this connection we w T ould refer your Lordship to a letter from His Excellency the Naval No. i 9 i 1462 , dated the 15th October 1914. Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, of which a copy w r as fonvarded to the Secretary, Political Depart- ment, India Office, with our Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 48 M., dated the 26th November 1914. 3. In these circumstances, we trust that your Lordship will he pleased to approve of our action in retaining Mr. Gregson on special duty alter the suspension of the blockade and will also accord sanction to the continuanceof his deputation on existing terms up to the 31st March 1916. For the present Mr. Gregson is assisting with the Police arrangements at Basra in addition to his duties in connection with the Arms Traffic.

EAST INDIA (EXPENSES OF INDIAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE). The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for INDIA (Mr. Charles Roberts): I beg to move, “That, His Majesty having directed military forces charged upon the revenues of India to be dispatched out of India for service in the War in which this country is engaged, this House consents that the ordinary pay and other ordinary charges of any troops so dispatched, or that may be so dispatched during the continuance of the War, as well as the ordinary charges of any vessels belonging to the Govern ment of India that may be employed in these expeditions which would have been charged upon the resources of India if such troops or vessels had remained in that country or seas adjacent, shall continue to be so chargeable provided that, if it shall be necessary to replace the troops or vessels so withdrawn by other vessels or forces, then the expense of raising, main taining, and providing such vessels and forces shall be repaid out of any moneys which may be provided by Parliament for the purposes of the said expeditions.” Two months ago the Prime Minister moved a Motion in this House re lating to the dispatch of the Indian forces to Europe. Under it the House of Commons gave its assent to the payment from Indian revenues of the ordinary charges of a force of British and Indian troops to be dispatched to Europe for service during the present War. That Resolution, however, did not sanction the application of Indian revenues to defray the cost of military operations outside India in non-European areas of the War, and it is therefore necessary to pass the present Supplemen tary Resolution, which gives a general assent to the contribution which India wishes to make to the expenses of the Indian forces employed in any of the theatres of War, wherever they may be. It was not an oversight that the original Resolution did not cover the whole ground. Parliament has rightly surrounded with constitutional safeguards the application of Indian revenues to pay the cost of Indian expeditions outside the confines of India except in cases of invasion or unfore seen sudden emergency, and therefore it has been thought necessary to get the assent of both blouses of Parliament to meet the gap which is now proposed to be covered. I ought to add one word as to the finance of this proposal. As has been already explained, India does not seek to make any profit or saving out of the absence of the troops which she would otherwise have to pay for if they remained in Indian cantonments. Therefore it has been agreed, with the unanimous consent of the Legislative Council, that Indian revenues should continue to bear the normal expenses which they would have had to bear if the War had not taken place, while this country pays the extra ordinary expenses involved in the dispatch of troops to the theatre of W r ar. That was the financial arrangement under the pre vious Resolution. It is proposed to follow that precedent in the present Supple mentary Resolution, but it must be under stood that it is not a hard and fast rule, but is liable to subsequent modification by agreement, and with the assent of Par liament, according to the nature of the operations in which the Indian troops may be engaged. In any case, we have warmly to recognise the substantial help which is being afforded to the Empire by the appearance of Indian troops at a great number of points in a battle line which extends from Tsingtau to La Bassee across the breadth of three Continents. So much for the purely technical and formal aspect of this Motion. But I was asked a little while ago to explain the absence of the customary Budget state ment in reference to Indian finances, and I should like to take this opportunity of making it plain that the postponement was not due to any inattention or indif-1335 26 November 1914 Written Answers.

Indeed, I think there never was a time when the in terest in Indian questions and the feeling of goodwill between England and India was more widespread or more strong than at present. All the documents required by Statute have been presented to Mem bers of the House of Commons, but, just as our own domestic discussions have had to be postponed, so the discussion on some Indian points had better be taken at a later date. But I do not think they will suffer by the delay, and I hope that cir cumstances may admit that, later on in the present Session, the customary Budget discussion on Indian affairs will take place. I should like also to take this opportunity of mentioning that there have been some complaints in the papers, both here and in India, as to the meagre details which have been given of the work of the Indian troops. It is known, of course, that they have taken part in the reduc tion of Tsingtau, in the rapid and success ful occupation of Fao and Basra, in the Persian Gulf; they are in force in Egypt, they took part in the landing at Shaik Said, and, sharing the vicissitudes of war, they were present at an attack against great odds, in East Africa. Of course, the main force is in France, taking part in battles which are taking even longer to decide than the famous battle of the great Indian epic, which lasted eighteen days before it was concluded. We all agree that it is exceptionally necessary in the case of India that full details of the work of the Indian troops should be given, and arrangements have been made towards that end. There are official reporters who send summaries of the doings of the Indian troops, which are telegraphed to India, and we plead with the Military Censor to give us as much information as military necessities will allow. On the other hand, everyone recognises that ever since the debacle at Sedan, which was undoubtedly facilitated by the publication of news in the London newspapers, the military cen sorship in all countries grows stricter and stricter. It is, of course, a strain on our natural anxieties, but we are endeavour ing to give as much news as we can. There is also one special disadvantage in reference to the Indian troops. The newspaper accounts have mainly referred to gallant behaviour on the part of the Sikhs and Gurkhas, and they fully deserve all the recognition which they have obtained. But there are other Indian races who are represented—Pathans, Jats, Hogras, Mussulman Punjabis, and others whose doings have been somewhat overlooked. Of the actual exploits of the troops the official reports, private letters and the accounts of eye-witnesses all tell the same story. There is no need to speak of the quality of the British units in the Indian Army, or of the very gallant leadership of the officers with the Indian troops, but the Indian troops themselves have by all accounts acquitted them selves in accordance with the expecta tions of those who best know their courage and training. They very soon adapted themselves to conditions of fight ing which are as novel to them as to the British troops. They have stood the shell fire steadily, and when the time comes to give the details of their action in the recent fighting it will be, I am sure, a record of which both India and England will be proud. I hope I may also be allowed to bear testimony to the energy of the Viceroy during the outbreak of this War. The varied expeditions which have been dispatched from India show the energy which he has displayed in the midst of personal griefs and anxieties, for the organisation of the Lady Hardinge Hos pital in this country reminds us of a sorrow which is still recent, and the House knows that his son, on whom the D.S.O. has been conferred, has been severely wounded. We have to express our sincere sympathy and our admiration for the energy with which the resources of India have been marshalled in the service of the Empire. Perhaps I may also be allowed to bear testimony to the invaluable services of the Commander-in- Chief, Sir Beauchamp Duff, and to ex press also our great sympathy with him in the loss which he has sustained in the death of his son in the War. I hope the House will bear with me also if I say a word' or two about the loyalty which India has displayed during the dispatch of these expeditions. It is always difficult, at a distance from any country, to be sure that one gauges and interprets rightly the feeling of that country, but I think one distinguishes certain different notes as one reads the mass of telegrams, resolutions, mani festos, speeches and newspaper articles in which Indian opinion has expressed itself. It is quite impossible to sum marise them, but I think one notes first the fighting spirit of many of the Ruling Chiefs who at once dispatched telegrams1341 HOUSE OF COMMONS Indian Force. War in Europe. 1342 1343 [Mr. C. Roberts.] pleading in urgent and in- 4.0 p.m. sistent terms their per sonal claim to serve the King-Emperor upon the battlefield. I quote one picturesque phrase which struck me in one telegram. It ran as follows:— “The noise of battle is lulling music to Rajput blood.” That is the spirit of the Maharajahs who are at the front—the veteran Sir Pretab Singh and his young nephew, and the Maharajahs of Bikanir and Kishengarh. Will the House allow me to quote a tele gram which the Maharajah of Bikanir sent:— “ I and my troops are ready and prepared to go at once to any place, either in Europe or India, or wherever services might be usefully employed in the interest of safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and his Dominions. Your Excellency knows the tra ditions of the Rathor Bika Rajputs. We long to be early at the front, but whether my troops can be used at present or not, I would earnestly ask your Excel lency at least to give me myself an opportunity for that personal military service of the King-Emperor and the Empire which is my highest ambition as a Rathor Chief and as a member of His Imperial Majesty’s Staff.” The Maharajah of Bikanir has had his wish. He is in France at the front, and his Camel Corps has been doing very useful service in the peninsula of Sinai. Might I add one other telegram 1 ? This was sent by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the ruler of a Mahomedan State, who said:— u At this crisis I beg that your Excellency will lay before His Majesty the King-Emperor the assurance that my heart beats at one with that of all the loyal people of Great Britain and her Dominions throughout the world, and that my sword and the whole resources of my State are His Majesty's to command for England and the Empire.” It is very difficult to acknowledge ade quately all the princely munificence of the ruling chiefs in connection with the expe dition. The generosity of the Maharajah of Jaipur and that of the Maharajah of Gwalior may be mentioned as instances. The Maharajah of Gwalior, besides princely contributions to every fund started in England or India, running into many thousands of pounds, organised, jointly w ith the Begum of Bhopal, a hospital ship and has given a large contribution of horses. His latest munificent gift is a fully equipped motor ambulance fleet. Ill- health alone, to his grievous disappoint ment, has prevented him from taking the field in person. There is a wave of loyalty, instinctive and emotional loyalty, which has swept over the people of India. But it would be unfair not to recognise that besides this, there is among the Indian educated classes a loyalty based on reason and the recogni tion of facts. It is at times less warmly expressed, but it is none the less substan tial. It is sensible of the undeniable bene fits conferred by British rule. It regards— not to put the case too high—the present regime as the best working arrangement for India. It is satisfied that within the framework of the Empire legitimate hopes ^ and aspirations can in due time be met. I think also that this more sober sentiment finds expression also among those Moslems w r ho cannot but feel the strain on their reli gious sympathies imposed by the insensate folly of Turkey’s attack upon the British Empire. Men like the Nizam of Hyderabad or the Aga Khan have been unhesitating in the advice they have given to those with whom their views naturally carry weight. Indian Moslems have, I believe, made up their minds that their secular allegiance is due to the King-Emperor. They know that their religion obtains the amplest toleration and respect in the British Empire, and that the idea that the present War is a religious war is an absurdity. The matter is perhaps summed up in the remark of a Mussulman Indian:— “Why should anyone question the loyalty of India? Is it not our Empire too ? ” What is happening before our eyes does, at all events, vindicate the policy that has been adopted and is being worked out in India—the policy of enlisting the co-opera tion of Indians in the work of government. There is no finality in the task of adjusting the machinery of government to Indian conditions and to the new 7 forces that our own action has evoked. For the time being, as everyone recognises, administra tive and constitutional problems are neces sarily in abeyance, but I wish to take this opportunity of announcing a change in the Constitution of one of the provinces which v^as in course of settlement before the out break of the War. It is not a change of a very far-reaching character, and the Secre tary of State and the Viceroy see no reason in the existence of the War to postpone the announcement. The Secretary of State has asked me to state that he has approved the proposal of the Governor- General in Council to create a small Council in the United Provinces to assist the Lieutenant-Governor in the executive government of the province. A draft of the necessary Proclamation will be laid in due course before Parlia ment. This will give to the United Pro- { vinces a machinery of government similar to that which obtains in the larger provinces of India.

I should add that the establish ment of the council has the support of the Viceroy and of the Lieutenant-Governor. For the rest, it is premature to attempt to anticipate the consequences that may follow from this striking and historic event—the participation of India in force in the World-War of the Empire. The results will not be fully seen until the War is over. But it is clear that India claims to be not a mere dependent of but a partner in the Empire, and her partner ship with us in spirit and on the battle fields cannot but alter the angle from which w r e shall all henceforward look at the problems of the government of India. I think I may call the attention of the House of Commons to one possible illus tration of this change in the point of view. It must be a source of pride and satisfac tion to India that she has sent the first of the great contingents from the Over- Seas Dominions into the European theatre of War, and that one of her brave soldiers, if the newspaper statements are correct, has been recommended for the coveted distinction of the Victoria Cross. The Indian Armies are soon to be followed by troops from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. I need not allude to points of friction that have existed between India and some other parts of the Empire, though I am glad to remember that the difficulties in South Africa have been overcome. But I should wish to refer to the summary of the Viceroy’s speech in the Legislative Coun cil during the Debate on the dispatch of the troops a few r weeks ago. He said:— “There is nothing like comradeship in arms and joint participation in the dangers and hardships of war to level distinctions, inspire mutual respect, and foster friendship.” He added:— “ I cannot help feeling that as a consequence better relations will be promoted amongst the component parts of the British Empire. Many misunderstandings will be removed and outstanding grievances will be settled in an amicable and generous manner. In this sense, out of evil good may come to India, and this is the desire of us all.” I am sure that that wish is shared also by the Secretary of State and will be echoed in the House of Commons. In the atmosphere of friendship and goodwill which unites India and England to-day there is surely a bright hope for the future. India must feel that East and West are engaged in a military partner ship which, as we believe, is both for the benefit of the Indian peoples and for the Empire as a whole, and I cannot but trust that the common endeavours of these days will enable India to realise that she is occupying, and is destined to occupy, a place in our free Empire worthy alike of her ancient civilisation and thought, of the valour of her fighting races, and of the patriotism of her sons. Mr. H. W. FORSTER: The willingness of India to continue to shoulder the finan cial burdens, the cost of the Military Forces which are fighting for the King- Emperor in many quarters of the world is only characteristic of her splendid and un swerving loyalty, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary for India has given full recognition to it. It is only right that we in our turn should bear the cost—and I am sure we shall not grudge it—of the troops that we send to India to take their place. The hon. Gentle man has paid an eloquent and well- merited tribute to the Indian troops and to the Indian native princes, and I have risen at the request of my right hon. Friend to say how r closely we associate ourselves with what has fallen from the hon. Gentleman. He has spoken of the valuable assistance which the Indian troops have been giving on the battlefields of Europe, of their valour and their unfailing courage. None of us ever doubted it, because we knew their history, because w r e knew that as fighting men there are no better fighters in the world, and in spite of the witherinf influence of the censorship, we have been able to read something of the prowess of the Sikhs and Gurkhas, and other of the native troops in Europe. I -was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman remind us—which many of us do not forget —that glorious as are the deeds of the Sikhs and Gurkhas, those feats of courage are emulated by the representatives of many other native races who are serving with the Indian troops. I am not going to attempt to enumerate them, lest I should omit even one that was worthy of honourable mention, but I will only say — and this applies to all of them — that they came from the land of their birth, which few of them had ever left before, inspired by the deepest devotion and loyalty, to fight for the Empire. The conditions and circum stances in which they are called upon to fight are w r holly new and wholly strange to them, but they have changed their skies only and not their spirit. The fight ing men of the Indian Empire, remember ing the splendid history of their fathers, have by their valour, by their stedfastness, by their endurance, proved themselvesms TFar in Europe.

They have declared their pride in being allowed to fight for the Empire, and this, the Mother of the Empire, may well declare her pride in them. Colonel YATE : May I, as an old Indian officer, be also permitted to associate myself with what has been said justly by the Under-Secretary of State for India. May I also say, how proud and rejoiced I am to see Indian soldiers now serving in all parts of the world, and to see them taking a fuller and fuller share day by day in all our emergency work. I would like to congratulate the Under-Secretary of State on his references to the valour and fighting qualities of the Indian Army. We have seen their troops fighting now in all parts of the world. We saw the other day what an active part they took in con junction with the Japanese in capturing Kiaochau, in China, from the Germans. We see them defending our possessions in East Africa from the tracks of the Ger mans in that part of the world. They have captured Pan and Bassarah at the Persian Gulf, and the Biksni a Camel Corps only the other day fought a most successful action against the Turkish forces advancing on Egypt. Not only the Regular regiments of the Indian Army are fighting for us all over the world, but there are as well other regiments known in India as the Imperial Service troops, which belong to Native States in India, which are joined with us in all these enter prises. No complete list of these Imperial Service troops has yet been published, but we know that the Jodhpur Lancers, the Haidarabad Lancers, and regiments from various other Indian States are serv ing in France and Belgium, in addition to the Bikama Camel Corps in Egypt, and the Kashmir Rifles in East Africa. The eagerness with v/hich all the Indian Rulers ofl'ered the services of the various regiments has been already touched upon by the Secretary of State for India. The one point necessary for us to see to in this connection is that these Imperial Service troops belonging to the Native States of India are provided with properly edu cated and trained officers, so that they /O-tvCA- may be able to take their place in line with the Regular regiments of the Indian Army on terms of perfect equality. I am glad to say that the Imperial Cadet Corps, which was founded by Lord Curzon some years ago, has taken a great step in advance in opening a military career for so many of the young aristocracy of India who desire it. I may call this institution the “Sandhurst” of India. This Cadet Corps will, I hope, as time goes on be greatly enlarged and will thus be able to provide a full and constant supply of young officers for all these Imperial Ser vice regiments. All cadets in this Im perial Cadet Corps should, I think, be placed on the same footing as cadets from Sandhurst in England, and should be granted commissions as lieutenants and captains in a similar way, and take rank with them equally when on service with us. I know that it will be taken w adequate s position of ' Mr. KEI the Under whether ar assistance Indian soh arranged i or whethe made for being kille&lt; ments hav pense is be ment or as made. 1 i in a positi If not, I si take a considerable time to find a full supply of officers for all these bodies to fill all the Imperial Service regiments but the work will be taken in hand, I hope, without delay so that these men may be able to serve side by side with our own officers on terms of perfect equality. Some 250 years ago the Great Emperor Aurungzeb, the great Maharajah of Jodhpur, led his victorious Rajputs to Kabul; at that time you may say the furthermost limit of the Indian political horizon. To-day, under the aegis of the British Empire, you see the present Maharajah of Jodhpur, with that gallant uncle of his, the Veteran Maharajah Sir Pertab Singh, together with the Mahara jah of Kishengarh and Biksmia, and many other Chiefs, leading their Rajputs to serve with us in France and Belgium. And 1 hope that the day is not far distant when those Chiefs will lead their Rajputs vic torious to Berlin. There is one point which I should like to mention in con nection with the Indian Army. 1 am not sure whether the Government have been able to supply a proper service of British officers to the Regular regiments in India. We see an enormous loss of officers day by day. We see what a necessity there is to have a large reserve, and I would ask the Under-Secretary to see that the Gov ernment of India would take up this ques tion in all seriousness. You cannot post officers to Indian regiments without a per fect knowledge of the language and customs of India, as can be done from the Officers’ Training Corps to regiments in England, and I trust that opportunity will Mr. C.

Mr. KEIR HARDIE: I only rise to ask the Under-Secretary if he will tell us whether any provision has been made for assistance to relatives and friends of Indian soldiers on lines similar to those arranged in the case of our own troops, or whether any arrangement has been made for pensions in the event of their being killed. I would ask, if such arrange ments have been made, whether the ex pense is being borne by the Indian Govern ment or as part of the grant that has been made. 1 do not know whether he will be in a position to answer the question now.

Question put, and agreed to. -CONSOLIDATED FUND (No. 1 ) BILL. Order for Third Reading read. Motion made, and Question proposed, That this Bill be nqw read the third time.” Mr. LONG: There a|e a few observa tions which I desire to make in regard to the general situation. My first duty is to thank the Prime Minister for arranging to have the Third Reading; of this Bill down to-day, as practically the first Order, in order to give us the opportunity of saying what we have to say. 1 am sure the House will realise that the Third Reading of the Bill is a more appropriate and convenient occasion on which to say anything that has to be said in regard to the situation than the Motion for the Adjourmnent of the House. I may also be allowed to say how entirely we on this side sympathise with His Majesty’s Government in the an- announcement which the First Lord of the Admiralty had to make to the House to day, and how deeply we sympathise with the relatives of those gallant officers and men who have offered their lives for theii country, no less than those who have been engaged in actual combat. I believe that it is’the unanimous opinion of everybody in this great Empire that this lamentable and terrible War should be brought to a conclusion, the only one conclusion that we choose to contemplate, as speedily as may be possible. To effect that desirable Precautions against Spies. 1348 end it is also the unanimous opinion that a constant supply of men to our gallant Army at the front is absolutely necessary. More men, and more men at once, is the cry which reaches us from all that are engaged at the seat of war. That is an object on which I know the Government have embarked. I know that they are doing all in their power with unfailing energy to supply our Army in Franee with all the reinforcements possible, but if these reinforcements are to be sent, and if the supply of them is to be continuous, it is obvious that we must seek a continual supply of the troops; and in this respect I would venture to urge once again, because this is the last occasion on which it will be possible for us to make repre sentations of the kind, the pressing neces sity of giving to the country some further information than that which we have received. I know the difficulty, and fully appreciate it, to which the Brime Minister referred when he was good enough to reply to some remarks of mine a few days ago. I fully appreciate the difficulty of an embargo laid upon us by our Allies. I fully appreciate the difficulty of fearing to do anything which is contrary to their wishes. But I would desire most respect fully to suggest that there is all the dif ference in the world betw’een our Army and the armies of our Allies. Ours is happily to-day a voluntary Army, re cruited without any pressure, and in order that we may keep it as strong as possible we w r ant first to keep up the enthusiasm of our people. The news that we have received from time to time can hardly be called news. In the first place, it arrives as a rule very late in the day, and, secondly it is the most partial kind. I appreciate the dif ficulty to which the Prime Minister re ferred, and w hich is v present in every body’s mind, namely, that w’e must do nothing which would play into the hands of the enemy. I believe that there is no sacrifice that the people of this country are not prepared willingly to make rather than give one fraction of aid to the enemy by receiving news or in any other w T ay. , But the new r s might be supplemented very largely without giving any possibility of advantage or even valuable information to the enemy. The other day there appeared in the newspapers an inspiring address by Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, a most distin guished general, to the W est Kent Regi ment, of which he spoke in terms which I , am sure w’ere fully deserved. But what 26 November 19141349 Consolidated!. Fund Bill. HOUSE OF [Mr. Long.] was the thought tfyat arose in the mind of everybody who 'heard those inspiring words 1 It was not one of envy or jealousy of the West Kent Regiment; it was not that they regretted! that it had come in for a full meed of ptaise, but it was that, gallantly and nobly ns this regiment may have done, still, in all probability, it was very little better thain the conduct of any other regiment in the whole of the gallant British Army which is now upholding the honour of the country with so much credit and distinction. The mere fact of one regiment being mentioned makes it inevit able that others feel a longing for recogni tion. I do not mean the regiment them selves, and I am not speaking on behalf of the men fighting, for they put aside all questions of this kind but I am speaking of the relatives and friends here, and I am speaking of the effect, that this kind of news must have on peqple when we want recruits. I am convinced it must be possible to give us news of a more ample character without any risk of giving information to the enemy, and I believe that until we do that you will not find thut unanimous and general response on the part of the people in regard to recruits -^hich is desired. Recruits we must have iif we are to get a continuous supply of men sufficient in numbers to fill up our regiments at the front, and keep on filling them up until this War is ended. Therefore, I most earnestly hope that there!may be a change for the better, and that \ve may be given fuller information. I venture to repeat the suggestion made the other day, namely, that some special correspondents should be sent out from this country to different parts of the scdne of War, and to them should be entrusted the duty of sending to us information—at all events as to our own Army—information which would be welcomed here, and which I hope will be given. For a reason which I con fess I fail altogether to understand, the Under-Secretary of State for War has up to the present declined to tell us what is the number of recruits. We have never yet had the information] and the right hon. Gentleman especially declines to give the figures in detail. The actual number can only be given as a ! general figure, because, of course, it naturally varies from day to day, returns n&lt;}t coming in, I imagine, regularly or simultaneously, and therefore the total figure could only be given approximately. But I think it is COMMONS Precakitions against Spies. 1350 really of vital importance, if I may say so in the presence qf the Prime Minister, that the figures shotdd be given for certain areas of the country. I would like to see those areas ma^e as small as possible. I will only take one case as a fair illustra tion, and any Member of the House will be able to supply similar cases from his^ own experience. This is one which has^P come within my own personal experience in regard to two villages, the population of which is somewhere about 800 or 900. Those two villages have sent to the Colours about 120 men—a very large per centage, and if the House deducts from the population the men over age and the boys under age, and the women and children, it will be found to be a very startling per centage of the- available population that has joined the Colours. Close by there are two other villages precisely similar in population, in their history, and in their surroundings. What do you find? Aon find that only one or perhaps two men have gone to the War. I have not the smallest doubt that there is a reason for this, and if this question of recruiting is thoroughly and persistently perused, those reasons may be met and the difficulties may be overcome. In the first instance, it is desirable to know what the various districts have done and are doing. I do not want to refer to any par ticular district, because one must look into the facts of each district before condemn ing a particular one for not sending up a larger number of men. It does not at all follow, because they have not sent up men, that they have not done so for some un satisfactory reason; there may be very good reasons to account for it. I am sure the House will feel the force of this remark. You have got a great many re cruits, but you are going on to get more. We have got to get men. We have written off the word “impossible”; it is taken out of the dictionary for this purpose; it does not exist for us at this moment. We have got to get the men. It is obvious that in those districts from which a very large number of .men have been sent that the feeling should exist, as it does to my knowledge, that it is not fair to ask them to send more men from those districts until an effort has been made to bring other districts up to a level with them by send- ing larger numbers of men. We want to ' see what they are doing, and, if we had that information, I am convinced it would, aid recruiting, and tell us what we do not know at the present moment. 949 Indian ORDER INDIAN E EXPEN RE^ The PRIN I beg to having dirt sisting of charged ui to be desp; in the Wa engaged, tl ordinary pa of any trot the ordinal longing to may be e which woul resources o had remail adjacent, s able, provit to replace drawn by the expens providing s repaid out provided b of the saic The Mot and which which I an with comp every quar that in a national a the War 1 has more the feeling than the r India anno which the country h; sequence of the Go is not con charge up in the cas and unfoi troops th country.

EXPENSES CHARGED UPON REVENUES OF INDIA. The PRIME MINISTER (Mr. Asquith): I beg to move, “ That His Maiesty having directed a military force, con sisting of British and Indian troops, charged upon the revenues of India, to be despatched to Europe for service in the W'ar in which this country is engaged, this House consents that the •ordinary pay and other ordinary charges of any troops so despatched, as well as the ordinary charges of any vessels be longing to the Government of India that may be employed in this expedition which would have been charged upon the resources of India if such troops or vessels had remained in that country or seas adjacent, shall continue to be so charge able, provided that, if it shall be necessaiy to replace the troops or vessels so with drawn by other vessels or forces, then the expense of raising, maintaining, and providing such vessels and forces shall be repaid out of any moneys which may be provided by Parliament for the purposes of the said expedition.” The Motion which stands in my name, and which I propose now' to move, is one which I am quite certain will be received with complete assent and gratitude in every quarter of the House. I do not think that' in all the moving exhibitions of national and Imperial patriotism which the War has evoked there is any which has more touched, and rightly touched, the feelings of this House and the country than the message sent by the Viceroy of India announcing the magnificent response which the princes and people of that country have made to our need. In con sequence of the provisions of Section 55 of the Government of India Act, 1858, it is not constitutionally right or proper to charge upon the revenues of India, except in the case of actual invasion or of sudden and unforeseen emergency, the cost of troops that may be sent outside that country. The assent of both Houses o Parliament is needed before any such charge can be imposed upon the ie\tnuc. mber 1914 Indian ExpedUionary Force. 950 of India. The assistance of the Indian Army under Imperial exigencies has been more than once—indeed, se\ eral times since the passing of that Act offered b} India and accepted by ourselves. I will not go into the precedents; it is not neces sary to do so. In most of those cases the whole cost of ! the charge has been met, as I am sure v r e would willingly meet it in this case, out of the revenues of the United Kingdom. But when this matter came up, as it did two or three w r eeks ago, before the Legislate e Council of the Viceroy in India, one of the unofficial native members moved a resolu tion to the effect that India would desiie, in the present emergency, that she should be allowed not only to send her troops, but to contribute the cost of their main tenance and pay, and the Viceroy, on behalf of the Government of India—and I am sure w r ith the assent and sympathy not only of this House and the people of this country, but of the w'hole people of the British Empire—accepted that offer. The result is that, through this patriotic initiative, not in any sense dictated or inspired by the Government, but proceed ing from an unofficial member of the (Council of India, these splendid British and Indian troops w'hich are now already upon their way, and which we believe will afford to us and to the Empire at large most effective assistance in the righteous struggle in which w T e are engaged, will be sent, as far as their ordinary charges are concerned, at the expense of the Government and people of India. The Motion I have to make is of a purely formal character. It is necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the Act of Parliament. I am sure we should not be giving expression to what everyone of us feels if we did not couple with its ac ceptance an acknowledgment, sincere and heartfelt, of the spontaneous and splendid assistance w'hich our great Dependency of India is giving us. Mr. BONAR LAW: I am glad to have the privilege of seconding the Resolution which has been moved. Since the War broke out nothing, as the Prime Minister has said—not even, I think, the heroic con duct of our own soldiers on the field of battle—has moved the people of this country more deeply than the spontaneous and enthusiastic outburst of loyalty to theii051 Indian E^itionary Force. HOUSE OF COMMONS Indian E^ditiomry Force. 962 963 Indiaiic [Mr. Bonar Law.] Emperor and patriotism of the Empire of which we had an account in the message of the Viceroy given the other day. The circumstances under which this Resolution is necessary are another proof of the reality and of the value of that assistance. Previously when Indian troops, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, have been used out of India the Government of India has looked with a jealous eye in order to see that no part of the financial burden would fall on the people of India. Now the Indian Government, representing and inspired by the Indian people, are not only sending their sons to risk their lives at the side of our own soldiers, by whom they will be proudly welcomed as comrades, but are insisting on bearing a share of the burden of the expense which is involved. I ventured to say the other day at the Guildhall that the moral forces which our enemies not only despise but affront would prove in the long run stronger than the material forces on which alone they rely. It is on moral forces that we rely to-day. The generous aid which is coming to us from the self-governing Dominions in every part of the Empire is coming of their own free will. It could not be demanded by us, and it could not be en forced by us. This assistance from India also is coming not from force, but from good will, and I believe that it is coming because, on the whole, e\ eryone who leaves this country to take part in the government of India, from the Viceroy to the humblest official, is in spired by the tradition that it is his duty not to exploit India for the benefit of this country, but to rule it for the good of the people of India. We have made mistakes, but on the whole we have succeeded, and it is because, in the main, the people of India recognise that that is the spirit in which the Government is carried on, that we have received so generously their assistance in our hour of need. this House against the most unfortunate and most ungracious attack to which prominence was given in the columns of the “Times” on Monday, over the signature of Sir Frank Swettenham, on the people of India. He has thought that this demonstration of loyalty and devo- ^ tion to the Empire on the part of the people of India was a fitting occasion to be used as a means for attacking a very large section of the Indian people, those especially who are represented in the Indian National Congress. He has stated that this demonstration of loyalty and devotion to the Empire, instead of being a proof of the solidarity of the people and of their devotion to the Empire as a whole, is only a proof t; that the voice we are accustomed to hear is that oi a comparatively small section of professional talkers, whose occupation has disappeared in the face of the mighty issues which are moving the real heart of the j&gt;eople.’’ I should have thought it was possible to learn a different lesson from the events happening in India. The lesson I should have thought it was possible to take would have been that those who, like Sir Frank Swettenham and his friends, have attempted to guide opinion in this country in the past, who have denounced these patriotic Indian politicians as mere pro fessional talkers and dangerous agitators, have been mistaken in the past, and that in these demonstrations in India we have demonstrations of the real feelings of the people and of the Indian National Congress. I think we should better realise how deeply the wound of such language would be felt in India if we attempted to put the words which he has used into the mouth of some Liberal or some Unionist, and applied them to the Nationalists or the Unionists of Ireland. The demonstra tions which we have received from both sections in Ireland could be referred to in these words:— 4 than they £ have voicei in the past. Mr. MacCALLUM SCOTT: I think that this occasion, when both parties in this House are giving expression to the debt of gratitude we feel to the people of India for their recent demonstration of loyalty and devotion to the Empire, is one which ought not to be allowed to pass without a protest from some Members of “ The voice we are accustomed to hear is that of a comparatively small section of professional talkers whose occupation has disappeared in the face of mighty issues which are moving the real heart of the people.’ If any of us, either Liberals or I nionists, were to use these words and to apply them to those to whom we have been pre viously opposed in Ireland—in either section—they would rightly be regarded as false and ungracious, and they would be no more false and no more ungracious Sir JOHI to assail th touching oi all.

Sir JOHN JARDINE: I am not going to assail the dignity of this Resolution by touching on any controversial subjects at all. I hope that the words of the Prime Minister will be telegraphed immediately to our fellow subjects in the Indian Empire. I entirely agree with w T hat the right hon. Gentleman who leads the Op position said just now, that this wonderful, this astounding exhibition of loyalty, not merely from the rulers, but from all sections of the people of India, is largely due to the conviction that whatever our mistakes may have been in the past, our intentions have been honourable, good, and kindly. In fact, they realise now that the Govern ment of the people has been good and, as has always been the policy of the Indian Government, largely in accordance with the traditions and customs of the country, which have been studied by those who have served the Government out there with a great deal of care. These offers have come, not merely from heads of the different States in India, but from innumerable local bodies, town councils, heads of communities, assemblies of students, men of education, some of whom have been under the dis cipline of the Courts for sedition in former days; indeed, all have joined in the general volume of loyalty, and I may say, without desiring to provoke the slightest feeling of opposition, that the fact that the proposal to charge the expenses of the Ex peditionary Force to the people of India came from an unofficial member of the Viceroy’s Council, a native gentleman, may partly be due to the reform of the Government of India that was undertaken a few years ago, giving greater powers to the natives, both in the Executiv e Cabinets of the Viceroys and the Governors, and also in the numerous Legislative Councils which have been established. When we passed that Act there was an indication that it met with general concurrence, and I remember i e- marking at the time that it was passed, as it ought to be, with the concurrence of the great parties of this country. And now.that the chiefs, great and small in cluding some 178 chiefs and princes in the Presidency of Bombay—as well as the 170 (17, Indian Expeditionary Force. 954 great chiefs in all parts of the Empire, have so warmly offered their armies, their resources, their swords, and even their sons to help in this great conflict in which we are engaged, let me say I think that is largely due to the change of policy which has resulted from the lessons of the mutiny. We have ceased to be always on the hunt to increase our territory; we have shown the princes, great and small, that their princely estates are to be preserved, and they now know, from experience, that they are protected by the great paramount Power against all enemies who may dare invade India. An instance may be cited as having arisen at a time when the ruler of Mysore had no heir. I remember the great controversy which arose as to whether that kingdom should be annexed. It was decided by the Secretary of State in Council that it should not, and now we find the present Maharajah of Mysore coming forward with a gift of £550,000 and offering all his arms and all his resources. The same thing occurred when a Conservative Government w T as in power, when the question was whether the State of Baroda should be annexed on account of misgovernment of that State. Lord Salisbury decided that it should not. That action has given great satisfaction to these princes, who in many respects hold the same positions as those held by princes and grand-dukes of Germany in relation to the Kaiser. There have been times when British rule has disappeared from great areas of the country, yet lav and order has been preserved, in then- interests as well as our own, by the native princes. Some of them are coming forward; others are sending their sons. That is quite in accordance with their tradition of warriors, resembling very much the old chiefs on the borderland of Scotland, part of which I represent in this House. After such an incredible response of loyalty, the nation should take the utmost care, in every way and at every time, to show its full appreciation thereof, and, particularly, when the rainy months begin and the cold and the snows come on, should the War last that time, the country should subscribe liberally to funds to provide comforts for the Indian troops. I should say that the Hindus and the Mahomedans of India are joining mostI [ 965 Indian. Expeditionary Force. HOUSE OF [Sir J. Jardine.] heartily in this movement, and in that way are giving the lie direct to much that w e have seen in recent German literature, where the notion has been put forth—an unholy notion for any Christian kingdom —that the Imperial Government of Germany should get into alliance w ith Turkey in order to use the Sultan, as the head of all Islam, to raise rebellion in those countries governed by European Powers where there are many Maho- medans. I submit that at the present time to set up a Moslem war against us is a decidedly unholy thing. One of the best things in all this spontaneous move ment is that it has shown that Moslem loyalty is as sound as the loyalty of those other defenders whom we hope soon to have fighting side by side with English, Irish, and Scottish troops on the battle field, and then returning to this city to be seen by us. Sir J. D. REES : My Leader has so com pletely expressed my feelings that I should not trouble the House except to put a question to the Financial Secretary to the War Office. I hope the great generosity of India, with which the House has been struck, will be imitated by those who have to deal with the financing of this question, and that British officers who proceed from India with their regiments to the front will not, as there seems to be some reason to fear they will be, put upon English pay.

With reference to your letter of the 3rd February 1913, No. 1,424, as to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein, I am directed to inform you that the Marquess of Crewe concurs in the proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to allow the Order to come into force as it stands, and to deal if necessary, in a separate Order, with the question of slave trade jurisdiction. ^ \’ , ,, , Copy of a telegrani' :;: * sent to the Viceroy on the subject is enclosed herewith for your information. It will be seen that His Lordship is consulting the Govern ment of India on the points raised in the 4th, 5th, and Gth pqyagraphs of your letter. As regards the (Indian) Pilgrim Ships Act, I am to observe that the reasons for which Sir E. Grey considers it preferable to apply this act by King’s Regulation, are not stated in your letter. Lord Crewe is advised that, from the Indian point of view, its application by Order in Council would be the more regular course, and he would urge that, unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, the Act in question should be included in the schedule of the new Order, as recommended in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 23rd January last.| His Lordship is advised that such modifi- OO 1 Copy commumealed to loreign Office, ca ti ons as mav l) e required to adopt the 23rd January 1913.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, relative to the Bahrein Onier in Council, and to transmit to you herewith printed copies of that paper 0 in the * ]Sot printed. form in which it is proposed to put it into operation. I am to point out that Article 8 (2) has been amended by the omission of the comma after the word “ foreigners ’ at the beginning to meet the objection raised by the Government of India in their telegram of Gth July last, and that a new sub-article (&lt;) has been inserted at the end of the same article containing the words suggested in the Marquess of Crewe’s despatch No 41, Secret, of 15th November (paragraph 3) and accepted by the Government of India in their telegram of 28th December. The word “ prescribed ” has also been substituted for the word “ presented ” in Article 56 in deference to the wish of the Government of India expressed in the same telegram. In Article 11 (3) “ Article 70 ” has been substituted for “ Article 78,” which appeared, through an error, in the draft of the Order, and “ K.G.” has been inserted after Sir E. Grey’s name in its last paragraph.Ii will be noted that these alterations are in addition to those agreed on in earlier correspondence which have been already introduced into the draft Order. As regards the second paragraph of your letter under replv, I am to state that the reasons which led Sir E. Grey to propose that the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act should be applied by a Kings Regulation rather than by inclusion in the schedule oi tbe present Order have already been communicated privately to a member of your Department. They are that if the Act is applied by a King’s Regulation any modifications necessary to adapt it to local conditions (such as were required in the Persian Gulf and Muscat) can be made in the Regulation itself, whereas if the Act is included in the schedule a King’s Regulation would also be necessary to provide for the modifications, and that this might cause further delay in the promulgation of the Order. In view, however, of the preference expressed in your letter for the latter mode of procedure Tor which, however, no specific reason is given), and of the opinion stated in the last paragraph that no further delay is likely to result from it, Sir E. Grey is willing to waive his objection to the inclusion of the Act in the schedule, notwithstanding the fact that in all other where it has been applied this has been done, so far as Sir E. Grey is aware, by a King’s Regulation It will be observed that the necessary insertion has been made in the schedule to give effect to Lord Crewe’s wish. I am to state that, subject to any further observations which Lord Crewe may have to offer on this question, Sir E. Grey would propose to submit the Order, in the form in which it is now enclosed, to the Law Officers of the Crown, and, on receipt of their approval, to forward it to the Privy Council with a view to its promulgation with the least possible delay.

Presuming that Indo-European Depart ment will manage the line request that Director-General may then be instructed to airange tor despatch ol necessary stall. It is highly important in commercial interest of community that both posts and telegraphs should resume work as soon as possible. As regards Customs, Messrs. Gray Mackenzie, in addition to agents with whom a military accounts officer has been associated, have consented to conduct Customs for the present, but it would be convenient if Customs official could be sent to advise as to future needs. As regards quarantine, Medical officer will arrange in consultation with our quarantine authorities at Mohammerah.” Second telegrams begins :— “ Following departments of Turkish Administration also have to be replaced as soon as possible as Military administration cannot properly cope with them. First, management of State property : secondly, management of Waqf properties: third, collection of land revenue generally: fourthly, collection of such revenues as are ear-marked for account of public debt : fifthly, management of tobacco Regie. In spite of state of war we are responsible to bond-holders in the last two cases : the sooner management is placed on working footing the better. 1 will endeavour at an early date to state what establishment was employed by Turks in each case and what seems primd facie needed now, probably something similar to that ordinarily employed for an Indian district. Meanwhile presume Government of India will administer Basra. I recommend that a civilian or political officer of suitable standing and experience, accompanied by one or two trained accountants, be despatched as soon as possible to examine the working of these branches and make recommendations for future conduct of them. It would be well if the officer selected was oik* likely to be concerned in the conduct of the civil administration after the war.' _ We agree generally with Cox’s recommendations for temporary ad ministration and would ask for very early sanction to proceed on these lines. We assume that administration will be under Government of India whose interests in the Gulf are intimately involved. We propose to send at once Mr. Dobbs, who has special qualifications, to take over departments mentioned in Cox’s second telegram, subject to general control of the General Officer Commanding the force of occupation.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 28th November 1914. ^ our telegram dated 24th November.
