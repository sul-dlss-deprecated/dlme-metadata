Letter is involved and replies to letter from Rashid apparently protesting against Shaikh of ^ata^s having given encouragement to a Nairn faction of Zubarah opposed to Rashid. It claims all Qatar and gives to Rashid seven days • r (possibly from April 19th) to atate his loyalty or he will be punished* Rashid sent letter to Shaikh of Bahrain who is incensed at Shaikh of ^atar , 8 action. 3.

Other complications seem to be attempt to put tax on Juss boats knd to install Qatar Customs official at small place just inside Zubarah area. 5.

Shaik of Qatar sent Salih bin Mani (who also brought letters) to explain position to me. I gathered from Adviser that Salih bin Mani also broke in on Shaikh at Sakhir during his siesta and that a stormy interview took place. Briefly Shaikh of Qatar claims Zubarah and states that Rashid bin Muhammad is his subject. As both Qatar and Bahrain have made definite claims to Zubarah it seems impossible now to avoid taking matter up. I am anxious to preclude any possibility of open trouble and suggest that I should write to both Shaikh of Qatar and Shaikh of Bahrain saying that I have reported the question to you and that it will be examined but that in the meantime both should remain quiet and that Shaikh of Qatar should not send people to Zubarah area and Shaikh of Bahrain should recall certain servants of his who have just gone there and stop repairing the fort pending result of investigation of matter.

As you are aware Shaikh of Bahrain has an old standing claim as against Shaikh of Qatar to Zubarah. Merits of this claim need not be considered at this stage but for previous history see Lorime^s Gazetteer of the - - ■ Persian Gulf, Volume 1 Part 1 pages 814 to 818 and 923* 2. Political Agent Bahrain telegraphs that in connection with this claim a somewhat serious situation has arisen briefly as follows. (a) Shaikh of Qatar has ordered Rashid head of the section of the NAIM tribe living at Zubarah to state his loyalty to him (the Shaikh) or be punished* (b) Attitude of Nairn Is reported to be that if they do not receive support from Shaikh of Bahrain against the Shaikh of Qatar they will 'adhere to Ibn Baud*. They are stated to have complained to Saud bin Jiluwl, Governor of Hasa against the Shaikh of Qatar* This seems not unlikely but a further rumour that the Shaikh of / 73® Inter* Political Resident, Bushire, at Muscat. Secretary of State for India, London* Government of India, Department of External Affairs, Simla. His Majesty 1 s Minister, Jedda* The Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, Hinaidl* The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf*-2- of qatar has eimilarly complained to Jiluwi against the Nairn seems to me doubtful. (c) Kaim numbering about one thousand (the men being armed) with camels and flocks have concentrated at Zubarah. This appears to me to indicate a possible migration of Nairn to Hasa. Alternatively Nairn may be collecting to resist the Shaikh of Q,atar j.n which case there may be fighting at Zubaran. (d) Individual from Hoffuf states that about April 24th Ji^uwi sent a party of 70 armed camelmen to qatar» object unknown but since it is also rumoured that there is some trouble near Doha between Shaikh of Q,atar and a tribe who claim adherence to Ibn Saud party may have been sent in this connection. I do not think it likely however that party will actually enter Qatar terri toiy • (e) Political Agent Bahrain has sent letter to Shaikh of qatar saying that he is reporting situation to me and that in the meantime Shaikh should keep his people quiet* (f) Political Agent Bahrain with nor approval is also sending a further letter to Shaikh of Qatai ad.visi.ng him not to send his people to Zubarah area and is addressing a letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain asking him to recall certain servants of his who have just gone to Zubarah, and to stop repairing the fort there pending result of investigation of matter. 5. I do not feel that we xx* should interfere if the Nairn emigrate to Saudi Arabia. Nor am I of opinion that we should take any forcible measures against either side in the event of a clash between the Naim and the Shaikh of Qatar (aee paragraph 2 /8./ &amp; /r -3- 2 (c) above). Political Agent Babrain however should of course continue his efforts at persuading all parties concerned to keep the peace. In particular Shaikh of Bahrain should be prevented from sending reinforcements to the Nairn at Zubarah, which apart from other considerations would be against his Treaty of t861 as it would involve a breach of the Maritime Peace- 4. If fighting breaks out in qatar and the members of the qatar Oil Company are in danger (an unlikely contingency) they should be evacuated by sloop* 5. In the above circumstances I would be grateful if Senior Naval Officer could put as soon as possible a sloop at the disposal of Political Agent Bahrain, who should proceed to Zubarah or Doha as he thinks fit get into touch with the local situation and keep Senior Naval Officer, Air Officer Commanding and myself informed of developments# 6. I would be grateful if Air Officer Commanding could arrange to have some aircraft standing by at Bahrain (1) in case of serious trouble on the ^atar-Saudi frontier though I think this contingency is unl ik ely (2) for possible rapid evacuation of employees of ^atar Oil Company though here again I think this contingency is unlikely and (5) for rapid transport of Political Officers to any any special areas in case of need* 7o Perhaps Minister Jedda would be so good as to ascertain to what extent if any the Saudi Grovernment are interested or involved in the present situation. v—--11 | i ' tb -4- 8 # i shall now leave Muscat in Fowey p.m. 30th April for Bahrain in order to keep in close touch with situation and will remain there until it is cleared up. - resident.1 (if) '7 COWPIDBHTIAL.

Sir, Your most obedient servant. Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain. ai irHIRE A/o Date 5/*/ 3 / 'iih % 35^ Zubarah Incident. Course of even ts: Sometime ago a man called Ramazan of the Ramazin sub-section of the Na'im tribe divorced his wife. The woman remarried into the Al Jabor section of the Na'iin tribe. As a result of this there was friction between Ramazan and Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad, the alleged leader of the Na*im. As a result of this friction the Ramazin sub-section left the Na f im and joined the Shaikh of Qatar. 2. About the 12th March the Shaikh of Qatar visited the northern and Zubarah. 3. The visit mentioned above was followed by a threat of taxation to the Na^m and a further threat to stop alleged smuggling from Bahrain into Qatar through these northern towns including Zubarah. In order to carry out this threat a party of the Shaikh's men pro ceeded to the northern towns and are alleged to have been obstructed by Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad. Ramazan, mentioned in paragraph 1 above, was a member of this party. 4. About the 15th April Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad wrote to the Shaikh of Bahrain and informed him of the endeavour to tax the Na'irn. He claimed assistance from him and stated that the endeavour to levy customs on the west coast of Qatar amounted to the Shaikh of Qatar showing animosity tov/ards the Shaikh of Bahrain. 5* It appears that the next move was a gathering together of the Na'im near Zubarah. 6. The Shaikh of Qatar wrote to Sft»ik^ Rashid and informed him that the Na f ira would be taxed if it was desirable and that he had received an offensive letter frorn^ Shaikh Rashid and that^ Shaikh Rashid should withdraw his/-56 his remarks and acknowledge that the Shaikh of Qatar was right in his action. Shaikh Rashid was given seven days in which to agree to all that the Shaikh of Qatar proposed. 7. A party of the Al Khalifah consisting of three of His Highness' guards landed at Zubarah with a quantity of ^ materials and planted the Al Khalifah flag on the beach. The materials were apparently for the repair of the fort. 8. The Adviser informs me that the Al Khalifah sol diers have been withdrawn. The orders were unfortunately delayed and apologies have been made for this. Situation of Zubarah . 9. The town of Zubarah consists of a number of ruined houses on the sea coast surrounded by the remains of a mud wall which at one time was guarded by towers, and an enclosed corridor runs inland for about a mile to the remains of a large fort (um Rea^ which contained a mosque and dwelling quarters. The whole of this is com pletely ruined and there is no sign of recent occupation. 10. East and south east from Zubarah there are situa ted the wells of Halwan, Masaichah, and Lashi. There is good grazing in this neighbourhood and the wells number five. 11. The Na f im informed me that Zubarah was bound on the north by Faraihah and on the south by Rubaijah. They seem to include the wells mentioned above, i.e. Halwan, etcetera, as a part of Zubarah. This is not improbable as there are ruined houses near these wells. The air photographs now being taken will assist in deciding the actual area of the country which can accurately be des cribed as Zubarah.-3~ Interview with Na^m leaders - 50th April 1937 &gt; 12* I met Rashid bin Mohammad, Khalld bin Mohammad 3 and other leaders of the Na'im tribe. They were per fectly friendly. They assured me that they had col lected with no evil intent, but only because they have been threatened with taxation and having objected they feared that Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim would take action against them. They claimed to be the subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain. I at first advised them to return to their followers and induce their followers to disperse and take up their, normal life as the case had been referred to the Honourable the Political Re sident. They asked me for a guarantee from His Majes ty's Government of security if they did return. I was unable to give them this guarantee and advised them to return to their people at once and told them that I would see Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim the next morning and would visit them again after my interview with Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim. They then returned to their people. Interview with Shaikh 'Abdullah bjn Qassjin^.the Ruler of Qatar. 1st May 1937 . 13. I met Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim and his sons Hamad and All. They were at Riyan. Saleh bin Mana, the Secretary of the Ruler, was present during our conversation. The Ruler was at first disinclined to discuss the matter with me. He said that he was aggrieved and that the case had been referred to the Honourable the Political Resident who knew all there was to know. He pretended to know nothing about the events/—events in his own country. However, after a little persuasion, he decided to discuss the matter of the Na T im. He admitted that he had sheltered the Bamazin section and that he had decided to put down smuggling through Zubarah and the villages to the north, and that in order to carry out this purpose he had sent Ramazan and a party of other people to stop smuggling. They were not sent to Zubarah. He claimed that the Na^im living in his area were his subjects and that he was entitled to tax them if he wished. He was very mch incensed against the Al Khalifah for having planted a flag at Zubarah and landed three soldiers and material. He stated that he and Shaikh Hamad were as brothers and that he had no quarrel with Shaikh Hamad. Eventually he assured me that he had not armed any of his people and had no intention of doing sOjand that there would be perfect security throughout his country from now on wards and that the Na'im were at liberty to depart to their normal places without fear of any interference from him or his people until such time as the Resident had given a decision in the case. We then dined and relations were considerably more amicable after the meal. I returned with Saleh bin Mana to the Na'im. Interview with the Na^m - 1st May 1957 . 14. Together with Wing Commander Rickards and Saleh bin Mana I saw Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad and his bro ther and cousin and other leaders at Halwan wells. I assured them that Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim had given me an assurance that they not come to harm on th6ir dispersing to their normal occupation and that there would be security pending the decision of the Political Resident/-31 n r-v u-t Resident, The majority of the leaders were obviously gratified and relieved. Shaikh Rashid and his two re latives were the only persons who questioned the ad visability of dispersing the force. This was because they are the only people who have actively opposed the Shaikh of Qatar. Saleh bin Mana was present the whole time the conversations took place. I considered it desirable that he should be present so that there would be no doubt of what I told the Na'im leaders and no doubt in their minds that what I was telling them re garding the Ruler of Qatar was true. Conclusion . 15. I consider that the possibility of the Oil Company making a port at the west coast of Qatar caused certain persons (Saleh bin Mana)? to influence the Shaikh to proceed to those parts and to institute preventive measures against alleged smuggling from Bahrain. It is probable that this tour of the Ruler of Qatar was simply and solely so that he could show to the world in general and the Na'im in particular that he was the ruler of the territory. 16. I think that Ramazan was specially chosen to be one of the party of tax collectors who were sent to Faraihah, etcetera, because he was known to be at enmity with the Na'im who inhabited those villages. It was probably thought that he was unlikely to enter into collusion with them to avoid duties. 17. Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad,who I understand lives in the area/Obstructed the tax collectors and as a result received a strong letter from the Shaikh. He became frightened of the consequences of his action and/-and appealed to the A1 Khalifah and the other sub-sec tions of his tribe. The result is known. I consider that Shaiidi Rashid would have been in order if he had only made a protest which we could have decided and not gone further and collected an armed force. 18. The Shaikh of B^r^in was also at fault in send ing a party of soldiers to plant the Bahrain flag at Zubarah and to land material for the ostensible pur pose of repairing the fort. He would have been better advised if he had confined his activities to asking our good offices to settle the matter. His delay in with drawing his soldiers from Zubarah after being so request ed by the Political Resident is also to be deprecated. I am of opinion that many false and lying rumours, some of them intentional, are at the back of this attitude and I do not think that His Highness would have personal ly acted in the way that he appears to have done if he had not been somewhat overcome by sentimental feeling for the home of his ancestors. 19. . There are in my opinion two problems to be decided and they are:- (a) the ownership of Zubarah (b) the nationality of the Na'im tribe. With regard to (a) I have nothing to say as I have not had an opportunity of studying the question up-to-date. The second point regarding the nationality of the Na'im should not be very difficult to determine. If Zubarah belongs to the Shaikh of Bahrain and they live within the area then they must be subject to his rule, but whether they belong to Bahrain or whether they belong to the Shaikh of Qatar as long as they are in the territory/--7- © territory of the Shaiich of Qatar they mist be sub ject to any laws and regulations that he makes for his inhabitants as a whole. If they are not prepared to do this then they should move out of the territory. When they go to Sa f udi Arabia they become subject to the laws in force there and such should be the case when they visit Qatar. Recommendation . 20. I am averse to a decision being given in this case before every endeavour has been made to bring the two Rulers together. If a decision is made only one side can benefit and the losing side will naturally feel aggrieved. For sometime the two Rulers have been on the best of terms and situated in close proximity as the countries are it would be most unfortunate if this state of affairs was permanently altered. I think that it is possible that Zubarah might prove a con tinual source of friction between them. 21. I suggest that an endeavour be made to bring about a meeting between the Rulers or their represen tatives and I think that this could probably be done at once and would prove acceptable to both sides. I have not discussed this with the Rulers. I suggest that His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain be approached with a view to his deputing his brother Shaikh Abdullah bin f Isa to meet the Ruler of Qatar and discuss a compromise amicably. If this course proves acceptable to him I propose that the Ruler of Qatar be approached with a view to meeting the Bahrain Representative. This could be done by my visiting Doha^r by air as soon as possible. If both sides are agreeable then either Shaikh/--8- Shaiith Abdullah bin *155 could be flown to Dohar or the Ruler of Qatar could be flown here. If this course fails there is no option but to give a f1nal decision and that as soon as can be con veniently done. 3-5-37I embarked with Wing Commander Rickards in H.M .S. Deptford. Accompanied by Wing Commander Rickards I landed at Zubarah and interviewed Shaikh Rashid and other leaders of the Na'im tribe. I advised them to disperse and return to their homes and informed them that I would visit their encampment on my return from visiting Shaikh T Abdullah bin Qassim at Dohar the next day. I landed accompanied by Wing Commander Ri ckards and a portable wireless set. We were met by Saleh bin Mana who had come with two cars belonging to the Qatar Oil Company to take us to Dohar. We left immediately for Dohar and arrived there at 12 noon. I interviewed Shaikh f Abdullah bin Qassim and his sons Hamad bin Abdullah and Ali bin Ab dullah. After lunching with the Shaikh we returned to Zubarah and picking up a guide from the Na'im tribe proceeded to the Na'im encampment. I again interviewed Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad and other leaders. It was noticeable that some of the tents had already been struck. I also visited the en campment of Hamad bin Abdullah A1 Khalifah. All the leaders seemed quite prepared to re turn to their normal way of life with the ex ception of Rashid himself, his cousin Rashid, and his brother Khalid bin Mohammad. I re- returned to the sea shore and embarking in 1 H.M.S.Deptford sailed immediately for Bahrain•11-1' — 4S SIIUAllOM. 5Qth April p&gt;in . NAHM.

They had been joined by the Bu Kawarah and the inhabitants of the north western villages. The Bu Kawarah live partly on the mainland and partly at Jow in Bahrain and those from Jow had gone to Zubarah by dhow. The Na^m and their friends numbered about 300 tents and could probably have produced 1000 armed men. May 1st.

To - His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, Repeated Secretary to Government of India, _ ^ _ External Affairs Department, Simla, my Political Agent, Bahrain, Subj ect ; ZUBARAH. I Reference my telegram lJo.T/71 dated the 28th April 1937, I Jk I 2, before the arise of the present situation the Political Agent, Bahrain, received a letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain, dated the I4tli April 1937, a copy of which I enclose. [ I 0# an informal conversation which I }md with Mr. Belgrave i Previous to the present situation arising the Bahrain claim to i ^ubarah appears to be aa follows, though of course this cannot be taun as either final or comprehensive until we get an official letter on the subject from the Bahrain Government. Briefly, the f Bahrain Government state (1) that fcr many years past the Nairn tribe of Bahrain origin, and members of whom live in Bahrain, are practically the sole inhabitants of Zubarah (2) that the Naim at Zubarah pay no taxes, including customs, il - to/ (Signature) (Designation)-2- to the Shaikh of (^atar. Nor does the Shaikh of ^atar insist on travel papers for Bahrain subjects visiting Zubarah (3) that the Nairn tribe obey the orders of the Shaikh of Bahrain, in support of which statement the Bahrain Government quote that many years ago the tribe obeyed the orders of Shaikh ♦ Isa, then Ruler of Bahrain, not to occupy the Zubarah fort, which they wished to do. Further, that the Nairn tribe generally obey the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. The Bahrain Government, however, admit that tiiey do not administer or take taxes at Zubarah. 4. Mr. Belgrave informed me, unofficially of course, that the Shaikh would be quite willing to give us an assurance that his claim to Zubarah would not in any way interfere with the rights of the qatar Oil Company nor tiaeir operations. Tnis is of course a point of some practical importance. 5. I instructed Colonel Loch to approach Mr. Packer, Chief Local Representative, |atar Oil Company, and ascertain whether the Company had in fact any intenV— of making Zubarah into a port (see copy of Shaikh's letter referred to in paragraph 2 above). Mr. Packer informed Colonel Loch that the Company had no present intention of doing this. I therefore instructed Colonel Loch to inform the Shaikh accordingly and to add that in these circumstances the question raised by His Highness did not appear to arise. 6. I had hoped that by this line of action the thorny question of the ownership of Zubarah would remain quiescent, and that His Majesty's Government would be able to avoid giving /4* -3- giving a definite award either in favour of the Ruler of Bahrain or the Ruler of Qatar# Present developments have made this more difficult but it may be still possible to arrange a compromise between the two Rulers on lines which Captain Hickinbotham has suggested, and on which I ill report later. In the meantime the following summary of the dispute may be of use to His Mnjeety's Goveriment and the Government of India, 7. With regard to the connection of the Ruling Family of 'Bahrain with Zubarah, see Lorime^s 'Gazetteer of the Persian rulf', Volume l f Part 1, pages 798-818, the correspondence connected with Government of India letter No, 1145-S.A, ,dated the 5th May 1920 to Shaikh •Abdullah bin «Isa. Briefly, the Al Khalifah family first invaded Zubarah from Nejd in 1766, a,xXi 't lence captured Bahrain in 1732 from the Persians, Subsequently a member of the family, Shaikh Muhammad, rfio was expelled from Bahrain by his grand uncle, Shaikh ♦Abdullah, the Ruler, re-built the town in 1842 (Lorimer, Volume Ij, .Part 1, page 799), Early in 1843 he returned to Bahrain, defeated and expelled Shaikh »Abdullah (ibid page 869) and seized the Shaikhdom of Bahrain which at that time included ^atar. MUhammad ruled in Bahrain until 1868,when he was expelled consequent on an ultimatum from the British Govern ment, ana was succeeded by his brother Ali,grandfather of the present Ruler /47 Ruler of Bahrain (ibid page 895). In about 1868 the Al Tnani family, who had gradually ^een rising to power, attained predominant influence over the other qatar Shaikhs (ibid page 302)• The Al Thani, howeTer, apparently still acknowledged ins ome sort the suzerainty of Bahrain since in the same year there is mention that the tribute, if any, payable by the Chiefs of qatar to Bahrain should be determined before the Resident, This state of affairs continued until 1871 (ibid page 802). As far back as 1873 (Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 815) the Government of India expressed their concurrence in the v iew that the Shaikh of Bahrain had no clear or important rights in .^atar, and this was conveyed to Shaikh 1 Iss, then tulei. Ox ^ahra^n, in i8 /5, v-de the last sentence of paragraph 2 of page 816 of Loriner's Gazetteer, Volume 1, Part 1. 9.. In 1895 (vide Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 923) the I'urks, in combination with Shaikh Jasim ath Thani, Ruler of qatar, concentrated a force at Zubt rah for the invasion of Bahrain, with them were a section of the Al Bin Ali, a Bahrain tribe who had migrated to Qatar and were hostile to the Ruler of Bahrain, His Hajesty^ G-overnment came to the assistance of the Ruler and prevented the threatened invasion by the bombardment and destruction by Sloops of the fleet of dhows which had been collected for the descent on Bahrain. 10, it will probably be useful for His Maje^ty»s Government and the Government of India to have my views as to the merits of the rival claima, (a) It can be cor]ceded (vide paragraph 7 above) that until 1068 Bahrain held part of qatar, including £ubarah, and from then until 1871 the qatar Shaikhs, headed by the Al Thani, acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahrain by being prepared to pay tribute. (b)/© - 5- (b) Sines about that date i.e. 1871 the A1 Tliani (the present ruling faraily of ^atar) have held ^atar, including Zubarah, and in 1875 the important announcemont mentioned in paragraph 9 above was made to the Shaiich of Bahrain. (c) The action which Hi a Majesty's Governaent had to take in 1895 on behalf of the Bahrain Crovernment shows clearly that at that date the Bahrain Govern ment, far from having any control over Zubarah, were actually threatened by invasion from that plac e. (d) With regard to the Bahrain case, see paragraph 3 (1), (2) and (3) above. The fact that on a single occasion the Naim tribe obeyed the orders of the Ru).er of Bahrain seems to me to prove little or nothing. 1 j t ima. f aci e the further argument that in audition to this specific case, the .Naim, generally apeaicing, obey tne orders of the Ruler of Bahrain, would seem to carry some weight. There, however^ certain sections of an Arab tribe have migrated from the territory of one Shaikh to that of another, they still consider themselves as owing some vague allegiance to the^r original Shaikh and are generally subject to hie influence. The Bahrain Dowasir tribe, for instance, some years ago being on bad terms with the Ruler of Bahrain, emigrated to Hasa. /hile there they doubtless received messages from the Ruler of Bahrain and evidently considered themselves as owing some allegiance to him, since finally they asked /-6- asked his permission to return to Bahrain. But this sort of allegiance on the part of the Dowasir naturally gives no claim to the Shaikh of Bahrain to the part of Hasa occupied by them. The fact that the Shaikh of qatar takes no taxes from the inhabitants of ziubarah and does not insist on travel papers perhaps carries more weight, but appears to me far from conclusive, and probably merely indicates a desire on his part to avoid trouble with the Nairn tribe and complications with the Bahrain Governcnent. This attitude, induced by considerations of practical convenience, does not appear to me materially to weaken in principle his juridical owner eh ip of ^ubareh , Lastly, the Bahrain Government admit that they do not administer or take taxes at Zubarah, In this respect, therefore, their clfai m is considerably weaker than that in the somewhat analogous case of Hawar. 11. Persjnally, therefore, I am of the opinion that juridically the Bahrain cl^im to ^ubaxah must fail. X2. jprom another and practical point of view His Majesty's Government, by their endorsement of the '^atar Oil Concession, would seem to be committed both to the Shaikh of Qatar and to Petroleum Development (qatar) Limited, to the recognition of the ownership of ^.ubarah by the Shaikh of c^atar. It may be possible to surmount this difficulty in view of the Shaikh of Bahrr-in's readiness to give the assurance referred to in para graph 4 above. iS# a political consideration on the Bahrain side is as follows. /S2 57® -7- follows• Colonel Loch informs me that there is considerable feeling, both on tne part of the Shaikh and of his family, on the subject of Zubarah, and is of opinion that if a decision were given in favour of ^atar they (the Shaikh and his family) will have a lasting grievance against us. Colonel Loch further points out that the Al Khalifah are our best friends on the Arab (Joast and that it would fce most unfortunate if this sense of grievance came into being. It is true that if His Majesty^s Goverrrnent gave a decision in favour of Bahrain, the 3haikh of Q^itar and his family would likewise have a atuse of grievance, but from the political point of view Bahrain is of considerably more importance to us than c^atar, 14. I agree generally with Colonel Locl^s vie^s but this consideration does not alter rcy personal opinion that if the comprcmise mentioned in paragraph 6 fails, and His Majesty^ 'Overnment have to .nake an award, it should be in favour of qatar subject to any further arguments which 'Bahrain can adduce, vide my paragraph 3 above. sd.

The Honourable the Political Resident enquired what information you had with regard to the alleged bur ning of houses at Ghariah, said to belong to adherents of the Na ! im, and you replied that you had no information. In reply to a further question you said that no complaint had been made to you and that if your subjects had com plained you would have enquired into the matter. The Honourable the Political Resident pointed out that should the account he had received of the burning of houses at Ghariah be true, then you must be considered to have broken your undertaking which you gave to me that you would be responsible Lhat the Na ! im were not interfered with while the case was under consideration bfct the Honour able the Political Resident. 3. The Political tiwn put forward suggestions to you that there should be an informal meeting between yourself and His Highness the Ru].er of Bahrain with the object of settling the present dispute. You stated that you were unable to negotiate about your right to your own country/--2- country, and after further conversation you stated that if you did agree to negotiate then the Ruler of Bahrain m&amp;ist send representatives to you, as you could not con sider sending representatives to negotiate your right to your own country, to Bahrain. The Honourable the Poli tical Resident very strongly advised you to reconsider your attitude pointing out that Bahrain had feeen chosen as the place of discussion as the Political Agent was stationed there and that it was advisable for him to keep in touch with the negotiations and that it would not be possible for the Political Agent to travel backwards and forwards between Bahrain and Qatar if the conversations were to take place at the latter place. The Honourable the Political Resident impressed on you that the conversa - tions suggested were purely informal and friendly, and would not commit you in any way but, in spite of this, you remained firm in your refusal to agree to negotiations. 4. As you were not prepared to change your attitude the Honourable the Political Resident pointed out that he would not be in a position to interfere in any way in any dispute Wiich might arise between yourself and the Ns'im. He informed you that your disagreement with the Na T im must be considered as an internal dispute and that, therefore, no action could be taken by us in favour of one side or the other. 5. The Political Resident suggested to you that your attitude could not be considered as conducive to a peace ful settlement of the situation but he hoped that you would change your mind and agree to negotiations. If you did decide to agree to negotiations, you were told that you/-*-3- / (39 you should commanicate with me by Tuesday the 11th May and that if I did not receive any conminication from you by that date, it will be assumed that you are not willing to negotiate and that I should inform you that your under taking of non-interference with the Na'im, given in my presence, would be considered to have 'ferminated. The Honourable the Political Resident further informed you that the Na ! im would also receive information by letter from me that your undertaking should be considered to have lapsed. 6. As I have not received any communication from you indicating your desire to negotiate with His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain with a view to settling the present dispute and in accordance with the instructions of the Honourable the Political Resident I now inform you that your under taking given to me of non-interference with the Na T im shall be considered to have lapsed from this date. 7.

Zubarah.95 '11 At ray request Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh and Saleh bin Mana came to see me yesterday. I questioned them on the course of the negotiations. It appeared that no progress had been made and that both sides had contented themselves with saying that Zubarah belonged to them. They informed me that Shaikh Abdullah bin *Jsa had stated Bahrain's terms and they were that Zubarah should be part of Bahrain, import dues not to be levied on Zubarah or the Na^m and export dues to be levied on goods leaving Zubarah on the land side. The oil posi tion was to be left indeterminate. I asked if they had questioned Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa carefully with regard to what he meant about oil but they said that they had not. They further stated that the terms were such that it would not be worth while informing Shaikh * Abdullah bin Qassim. i asked them what their instruc tions were from Shaikh 'Abdullah bii^ Qassim and it appeared that they had not received any concise instruc tions at all. i pointed out to them that it was fear them to question the Bahrain representatives fully with regard to the proposition put forward by them and that they should not content themselves with merely saying 'No' or 'Impossible^. They were representatives and negotiators and they should do all they could to search for some way round the obstacle. Saleh bin Mana then gave me a history of Qatar's claim to Zubarah and i then asked Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh if, according to Arab •'■niiBMiiiat' «*«•.. SMS*- ... K^.y -•&gt;»»-- custom, a house was built and then left unoccupied for many years and then the descendant of the builder re turned to the house, to whom would the house be considered to belong. Shaikh Nasir was unwilling to answer this ■ ' ---.vxVWi , '' ' ... question and although it was explained to him by myself and/--2- 11 and the Interpreter he still declined to answer and said that Saleh bin Mana must anwer that. Saleh bin Mana again embarked on a history of Qatar and the question was unanswered, the reason being, that of course the answei is that, according to Arab custom, the house would natu- rally belong to the descendant of the builder. I told them that, as negotiators, they mst be prepared to con cede something and that the Bahrain negotiators must also be prepared to concede something. I again asked them to endeavour to settle this matter by negotiations and as an example of what I meant by negotiating I said that possibly they might consider returning to the con- UmuUU»*'iiKHiwui' i^i i- i i . -— r-ijr ii .-.4 ir ^fcum- , v ,. dition that existed six months ago whereby Bahrain were not making an active claim to Zubarah and the Shaikh of Qatar was not endeavouring to levy dues or taxes on the Na^m, and that they might consider this proposition not as officially suggested by me but merely as an exam ple of what I meant when I stated that they should search for a way round the obstacle. 2. Saleh bin Mana suggested that it was difficult to explain what each side was saying and that there were probably differences in the reports of the conversations from each side that he would like the conversations to take place in front of a neutral party. I told him that I would report this suggestion but that at the present stage I hoped that they would be able to come to a rea sonable understanding without the presence or interference of a third party. 3. Saleh bin Mana then informed me that he had re ceived a letter from Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim with a message for me in it and that was to the effect that the Na'im were not dispersing. I expressed surprise that Shaikh/-^3 /fff © Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qassim should write to me through a third person when I was myself in correspondence with him and had actually received a letter from him the pre vious day. I informed the representatives that the Na'im had given an undertaking in the same terms as Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim and I saw no reason for presuming that they were any more likely to break their word than the Shaikh himself. 3. Towards the end of the meeting I asked him if they were keeping Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim informed of the trend of the conversations. They said they were but that the terms stated at Saturday's meeting were so impossible that it was not worth reporting them. I told them that they should keep their principal advised of everything. 4. Shaikh Nasir then volunteered the information that the Na'im were causing considerable worry as a number of other people, Qatar subjects, were Joining the Na'im gathering and in reply to my remarks that I could not be lieve that the loyal subjects of Qatar were joining the Na'im, he stated that the subjects of Qatar were not all of them loyal and that this extra gathering was causing concern to Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim. I told him that I had that morning received a vague report to the effect that Shaikh 'A.bdullah bin Qassim himself was preparing for eventualities should the negotiations break down. Shaikh Nasir said that he knew nothing of this. 5. From iry conversation with the Adviser and from this interview I have come to the conclusion that the two representatives had not come to Bahrain with any prac^tical intentions of seeking a solution but that they were sent because the Shaikh of Qatar desired to be able-4- /0*K to say that he had abided by the request of the Political Resident to send representatives to negotiate. The in crease in the strength of the Na^im, if this is true, and possibly my conversation of yesterday may change the charac ter of the representatives 1 visit and I do think that it is inn km JW '''«wriii^ still possible that a solution may be found through these negotiations. I informed the representatives that I trusted they were here really and truly to endeavour to find a solu tion. NOTE :- I informed the Adviser of such parts of this conversation as I considered it desirable for him to know ^ . - n ..I,, , ■ri--— .—-p,—.-v and he told me at the same time that he had received in formation that the tribe known as Sudan living in the neighbourhood of Doha were proving disloyal and were expected to join the Na f im. This is merely a rumour but from other rumours both of us have gathered that the state of Qatar is becoming a little uncertain. Id/- T.H. 17-5-37.IS' (6- Saleh bin Mana asked permission to see me this morning and I granted him an interview at 9•30. He replied that he was busy at that time and I altered the time to 12 noon. My reason for making this alteration was that I had been informed that he was upset because a recent letter from me had been addressed to Shaikh Nasir and I had not mentioned his name, and I did not want any possi bility of the negotiations being in any way obstructed by pique on the part of one of the negotiators. On his arri val I pointed out to him that he had made an incorrect statement to me at the previous meeting when he stated that he had made three applications to see me and that the Head Munshi had not forwarded them. The Head Munshi was present on this occasion and Saleh bin Mana found it diffi cult to substantiate his previous statement as he himself had told the Head Munshi that I was not to be informed and that he would come at some other time more convenient to himself. I then explained at length to him that the leader of a deputation was a person who was officially or socially considered to be so and that I had presumed that Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh as the near relative of Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassiro was naturally and socially a more important individual and therefore I had addressed my communication to him, that I considered they had both equal standing as negotiators and that my addressing Shaikh Nasir was not intended to be in any way detrimental to the standing of Saleh bin Mana and that he had an example in these matters in the method of addressing the Sa'udi representatives when they came to discuss matters some years ago with the repre sentatives of His Highness the Ruler. At the end of my explanation Saleh bin Mana made a long recitation of the excellent/--2- % (0^ g) excellent work he had done since the time of Colonel Keyes and how that he had been most upset at his treatment and considered that the Agency were opposed to his pre sence and were not prepared to give him the standing of a negotiator and that he felt very deeply hurt when the communications were addressed to Shaikh Nasir and not to himself• He said that he had attended the meeting of the representatives that morning and had purposely refrained from making any remarks. H again explained to him the si tuation and pointed out to him that I was unaccustomed to having persons who asked for an appointment state that they were engaged when I notified the time for them to see me and that although I was extremely busy nyself this morning and had expected that the meeting, which I knew was to take place, would be postponed, I was pre pared to grant a second time for an intervie?/ as I had heard that he was feeling hurt. Saleh bin Mana then assured me that the whole matter was now quite clear to him and that he was doing everything he could to settle the question as the Resident wished. I told him that I was quite sure that he would work in the interests of his own party and the general good of the two States and that he would do his best to meet the wishes of the Resident especially since the Resident's visit to Doha. Saleh bin Mana then stated that he wished to discuss the suitable means of settling the present problem. I pointed out to him that just as I could not deal with Shaikh Nasir and had no intention of doing so, by myself, I could not deal with Saleh bin Mana without the presence of Shaikh Nasir and that I was unable to hear any suggestions with regard to the negotiations from him unless his brother negotiator was also present. I said that as it was he had been an hour at the Agency and that no doubt Shaikh Nasir/-17 -3- Nasir was already beginning to wonder what it was all about. (Id) T.H. 18-5-57.% The Adviser was present at this mDrning^ meeting with the consent of both sides. His own party were anxious for him to be present so that some one other than the actual negotiatiors could observe the general conduct of the proceedings. The Qatar representatives I understand had no objection whatsoever. Mr. Belgrave informed me after the meeting that Saleh bin Mana was rude in the extreme and that if he had not himself been HtH*m •w&lt;urV ,.&gt;i&gt;I&gt;.I present he would never have believed that Saleh bin Mana would conduct himself in such a way. It appears that he refused to take part in any discussion and there was something in the nature of words between him and Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh who was apparently annoyed at Saleh 1 s attitude. Mr. Belgrave further informed me that Shaikh Nasir was more loquacious this morning than he had been at any previous meeting and actually certain progress seems to have been made. Shaikh Nasir appears to have put forward very guardedly suggestions somewhat on the lines of the one which I had mentioned to them when they saw me on Sunday, They c re meeting again at 2.30 this afternoon and I am seeing Mr. Belgrave after the meeting. Id/- T.H. 18-5—37.f Abdullah bin Dowaslr arrived from Qatar about five days ago and I think is interested in this matter. He is at enmity with Saleh bin Mana although outwardly very friendly.

I told him that I had received a re- ■ •.-If-..,- ■ - port that Saleh bin Mana was the worse for drink when he called on His Highness on Monday the 10th May and that it was suggested that he had obtained it from his (Mr.Packer's) house. Mr. Packer assured me that from henceforth he would not allow Saleh bin Mana to have beer, etc., when he called. Regarding the second point Mr. Packer admitted that Saleh bin Mana had raised the question on several occasions but beyond informing him that Petroleum Concessions Limited were not interested in Zubarah he had given no opinion, I asked him in future to refrain from giting any advice or opinion on the subject and he said that he would.

Bahrain. sir, .*ith reference to the negooiations between the representatives of the xiulers of Bahrain and % attar regarding the Sahara question I have the honour to acquaint you of the result of the fifth iaeeting v#hioh was held yesterday afternoon. 2U During the jiiorning the Bahrain representatives had a lengthy discxission with His Highness Shaikh ^ir Haaad bin laa al-Khalifah f J£«C«1«£» 9 G^.I# f who even tually agreed to their accepting a proposal which had been made by the gattar representatives on the previous day, but which had not been discussed in any aetail, to the effect that the position of ^abara and conditions iu ^ oi.uuiu revert to what they were formerly, ' before the present dispute arose. 3. rhe arrau^eiaent was proposed by the uuhrain representatives in the following iiianner. The ciaiii of the Ruler of Bahrain to the ov.nership of —[Of, (iC? - 5) of /j&amp;bara and his claiiii that the Haiai tribe his subjects is not disproved. The claim of the iiuler of^atar to the ownership of Sahara and his claim that the i£aim tribe are his subjects is also not disproved. The Kuler of Bahrain in order to preserve the long friendship, both personal and political, between the two iiulers and the two states, agrees, (i) not to press his claim to ^abara and the naim tribe, (ii) not to in any way develop «abara, (iii) to take measures to prevent saugeiin.; through Zabara into ^atar, (iv) not to allow settlements in ^abara made by persons from Bahrain, (v) to preserve the condition of ^abara as it was before the present disp ute, provided that the iuler of ^atar agrees,® (i) not to iiipose taxation on the perma nent normal inhabitants of ^abara who are the iktim tribe and their relations while they are within the Sahara area. Should they move out of Zabara into other parts of , v atar they becocie liable to anv form of taxation which is normally paid by subjects of ^atar, not to develop Sahara in any way but to preserve it in the condition that it was in before the present dispute but should the ^attar oil company wish to carry out genuine work within the ^abara area they shall be allowed to do so. iifter long discussion the ^attar repre sentatives said that they felt sure that the Moler Him mfMni ^ of ^attar would not agree to the suggestions of Bahrain t it was his intention to put a military post in one or two of the Nairn villages within the Zabara area to prevent smuggling and he could not agree to leave &amp;abara in its present condition incie111 #) iadefiiiiteiy. The ^attar representatives stated that the only point which they could, provisionally, agree to was to waive customs dues on the actual food supplies of the Haia tribe but that it would first have to pass through a customs post at ^.abara. The Bahrain representatives stated that they could not agree to the establishment of posts inside ^abara area but agreed to them being placed on the of uabara was the deserted village o! that name only, not the area which is bounded by certain villages and ruined towers which is the area claimed by Bahrain. 6, The iiahrain representatives invited the ^atar representatives to inform the xiuler of .^attar of this suggestion but the ^attar representatives again said that it would be useless to do so, so the Bahrain representatives stated that in that case they would request His Britannic i.tajesty's political i^gent to make their proposals known to the Jtuler of ^attar as his representatives persistently refused to sign any minutes of the meetings or to take any written drafts or notes of suggestions or discussions and they feared that if the proceedings were cOiOiinmi- cated to the Buler of i^attar verbally some misunder standings might occur as to what was said or proposed. edge. 5. their definition ^ir, Your most obeaient servant.

And the Nairn tribesmen are my subjects. They were one of the tribes of Qatar State in the past and continue to 'be so until now. The claim made against this is therefore an unjust one and is considered an act of aggression upon otners* rights. I have, however, no alternative 'but to ooncur with your views. My two representatives have since reached Bahrain and have produced proofs and evidence to establish that ^ubarah is one of the coasts of Qatar ^tate and that the TTaim are wy followers and subjects while the claimants have no cylear Proofs acceptable to common sense or logically admissible to offer in support of their claim. I am quite positive that Your ^onour will adopt what .iuatice dictates in this question and will give your full consideration to the rights involved. I rely on the strong friendly relations which exist between me and T ris Britannic ^■lesty's Grovernment who, I am sure, would not agree that aa y of my rights should be spoiled.

But in order to maintain the old friendship and mutual friendliness which exist between rae and His ^ighness the p.uler of ^ahrain T made some amendments and forwarded my own proposals. forwarding iMSKiJcli a oopy of the proposals herewith for Your Honour's information, I request^hat you may oarefully think over it and know for certain that this is the utmost that I oan aocept for the solution of this question. Tith a view to the friendship and sincerity which I maintain towards Your Honour and the strong good relations which conneot me with ^ia ^ritannic Majesty f s Government I trust tnat Your Honour will give a decision based on justice and equity in tnis question for which I would lie most grateful to you. I have sent my proposals with my representatives to the Political Agent, Bahrain, so that he may pass them on to the Committee of delegates appointed 'by Hia Highness the -^uler of Bahrain.

With reference to the letter received 'by me from the Honourable the Political hesident m tne Persian Gulf signed by Captain Hickinbotham for His Honour dated 27th Safar 13b6(9th iJay 193'/) to tne efiect that the Nairn tribe was ordered not to gatner and show movements which may startle minds, that they should stop these activities by their dispersing to tneir own places. But it is regretted that they did not obey His Honour's orders and did not act accordingly. But are still continuing their movements ana gatherings which I fear might lead to jcme trouble. I have now learnt that some of them halted in a well from which the people ol Khwair take water situated m the middle ol the roaa between Khwair ana Doha planted a flag there and did some acts which would not be tolerated. I e h^pe that you would tell them to stop these deeds and disper^ to their own places as long as tne negotiations are going on.

As to your intimation that the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has learnt that we hrve not fully dispersed from around Zubarah. This is as intimated to you before that it is our summer quarters. That we have moved to places near Doha where we normally do not go. This is false. That some people of us are trying to do things which are not good against His Excellency Abdullah, Shaikh of Qatar. This is also lie. You also intimrted that the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf hopes that what he has heard was not true. This was, as he hoped, correct as these acts would not be according to the promises bet ween us. That he wishes that nothing should be done which may cause troubles which are no good to anybody.

They stnted that in their previous meeti ^ 'Ith the Bahrrin I final proposals of Shaikh 'Abdullah, the Ruler of Qatar. 2. They said that the Bahrain Government had agreed to a large proportion of Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim 1 s proposals but were desirous of definitely altering one or ti o of the clauses (l fancy that the nrir alteration in- cistcd upon ' ; B-ahrrin r vss Vut refor: irg to the clrim of Zubarah in toto}. 3. They had the day before received a message from the Ruler ©f Qatar saying that he T:as net in any v/ay prepared to alter his original proposals. 4. They then stated that they could further now produce documentary proof as to the suzerainty over the Ns'im tribe. This proof, they said, consisted of lettrrs from the Bri tish Goverr ment to the Ruler of Qatrr con^tlrining against certain misdemeanours performed by the members of that tribe. This they averrec ''as obviously ' complete tacit admission as to who ~as the correct overlord of the 'la'im. They are prepare d, they say, to produce these documents. 5. They then stated that they further had what they considered to te#conclusive documentary proof not only as to the ownership of Zubarah (concerning t hich t^ey s o id the Agreement ratified by His Majesty's Government consti tutes proof of the ov.nersl.ip o^ the entire Q^tar Penins-ila ly the Ruler of Qatar) ' at also of the true overlordship of the !;s T iiii, again inplied by the protest concerning t' em sent by His Majesty's Government to the Ruler of Qatar and to the Ruler of Bahrain,„ s 6. Bahrrir, on the other hnnd, they sr id h-K? ry- t )fnded tremendous number of rrorde but T - -:'e unprepared or um illing or unable to produce one scrap of docu- mentrry evidence in favour of their claims. 7. The question then arose concerning the ult^iate arrival rt r comprortlse. I as^ec 1 Sal eh bin an? direc 4 * if he considered both sides takirg up this f t .itude - whether there was any hope of a decision ^eing reached vithout the assistance of an arbitrator. He replied that the Shaikh of Qatar was not prepared to go any further as he had even now made far sweater concessions than he con sidered he should have made merely in order to retain the good friendship of the Huler of Bahrain. 8. The Qatar representatives were very strongly in favour of the matter being settled by arbitration. They stated that the Bahrain Government were not prepared to agree to this. This fact,, they pointed out, in itself militated against the Bahrain claim insofar as whilst Qatar b, acknowledging their readiness to receive a judg ment felt assured of the strength of their claim, the very un- illingness of Bahrain was a powerful proof that they have no substantiation to any of the statements which they had made. 9. I then told the Qatar spresentatives that although they nust realise that as always I can only report to my senior officer the Political Agent and it is entirely up to him and the Political Resident to ma :e decisions, nevertheless, I would point out the fact that a deadlock seems to have been arrived at and nov that definite claims, ^roefs and proposals were all ready to hand I thought that unfortunate though it was^_ nev ertheless, the time forlu arbltratioii had come. My reasons for this were that it \,as my considered opirion that an arbitrator might nov after all that had passed be able to arrive at some de cision which would not only deal equitably with the en tire subject but enable the long-standing friendship bet- y/een Bahrain and Qatar to remain undr^maged, 10. I, therefore, assured the Qatar representatives that I would send an air mail letter summarising their statements and puttir^ forward this suggestion, T warned them stringently that this ir no way committed us an the entire matter rested in the h^nds of the Political Resi dent and the Political .Agent, 11. Finally I pointed out that of course no question of arbitration, however hypothetical it might v e, could be raised without the complete acquiescence o^ the Bahrain Government, Sd/- E, T(omlinson) Dictated on Sth June 1937,CONFIDENTIAL. no.

To - The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel Sir T.C. Fowle, K .0 .I.E., C .B.E. ^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. After Compliments. I have the honour to submit to your Honour the question of Zubarah. I have explained to your Honour repeatedly about the provocation caused and the agression done to us by Bahrain on account of this Imaginary claim which is not set up on a foundation or basis according to intellect and logic. I am surprised at this claim which they have created in connection with Zubarah which is my land and one of the Qatari Coasts. Honourable the Political Resident I You asked me when you visited Doha to send two representatives in order to negotiate about the Zubarah Question and as I infonaed your Honour that I was quite certain that there was no necessity for negotiation in a clear matter, but I could not disagree with your wishes. Airlin accordance with your desire I sent my two representatives to Bahrain for negotiation under the supervision of His Britannic Majesty's Political A^ent there. Negotiations started on the subject and my representative r j^oduced clear proofs that Zubarah is a port inseperable from the Qatar Territory. In conc lusion proposals were set forth to me by the repres entatives of H.H. the Buler of Bahrain to which I did not agree because I considered it the same claim which they created but in order to preserve the friendly relations existing between me and H.H. the Ruler of Bahrain and in support of the mutual neighbourly friendship I inserted some modifications in the same and sent it to them through H.B.M's Politicsl Agent. I intimated thisthis to you and sent a copy of the meditflcation thereof. I have also informed Your Honour that that was the extreme limit possible for agreement,afterwards I learnt that the claimants are still sticking to their own views and that they want to encroach upon my rights t and try to cut a port from my land and a coast from my coasts* Honourable the Political Resident I I am certain that my proof is clear and known even to the High British Government from the time they entered into Treaties with Bahrain and granted them protection in connection with their boundary* They undoubtedly knew that Zubarah had nothing to do with that. The High British Government also granted to us protection of land and by sea to all Qatar without exception and recognized the independence of all Qatar state under my ruling flag* Is it possible that when the High British Government granted that to us they had any doubt about Zubarah and did not make it clear to us or draw our attention to it* Lately a negotiation took place between me and the Anglo Iranian Oil Company Limited for the survey in all ^tar territory and excavation in its land, boundary and Coasts* Their agreement concluded by the permission of the High British Government and survey carried out in all Qatar lands, Zubarah etc* A was drawn map consisting of all Qatar State including ZubaraJ^. T^is negotiation was going on with the said Company about lands oil develop tent in whole Qatar bede or places as shown in the map. This negotiation was concluded aiid when I ea^ upon and approved by British Government I agreed saw that it was agreed^ith the said Company and signed the concession for the Company as laid down in the agreement which is concluded between me and them* All this was done under the supervision and consideration of your Honour. This took effect by your confirming the agreement which was concluded in connection with all Qatar Territory*3. ' including /iubarah according 'to the map connected to the agreement* Your Honour confirmed this without hesitation. It is now surprising as to the creation of this new claim on the part of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain about Zubarah. Today after the conclusion of the Treaties between us and the High British Government and after that of the negotiation and the granting of concession of all Qatar, Zubarah etcetera without exception. If there was any smallest fllaim or the slightest doubt on the part of the Bahrain people they would have not left out and ignored it in these conditions and during all these changes. But they knew that they have no right to the same. I am sure therefore that you are aware of all these proofs and contexts and see that this claim of theirs is useless and they have not the slightest connection or right to what they claim. I hope that your Honour will consider this matter keeping a limit for this encroachment and c ausing the settlement of this case of putting an end to the dispute, because, as it seems to you the claim of Bahrain people to our boundary is keroby useless and agressive one. fm I am confident of your nobility and justice and your inclination of the right side • You will not agree to the usurpation of our rights and will prefer right and justice in any way. I have also to draw your attention to tb&amp;r friendly relations existing between me and the High British Govermaent and to the Treaties which are known to you. I am still the same friend that always wishes to preserve what would satisfy the High British Government and please t em. Usual Ending.1^)' confidential . No- 475-3 of 1937.

This system forks on f.30 to form a third foliation sequence, which is out of step with the second sequence due to the fact the 1st folio marked with this sequence is labelled with a range; these numbers are also not circled, written in pencil and can be found in the same position as the other two sequences.Foliation Errors: 1A and 1B.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence related to tensions between Bahrain (and the Al Naim tribe) and Qatar concerning the ownership of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula that took place between March and June 1937.At this time, the Al Naim tribe were allied to the Al Khalifa ruling family of Bahrain who claimed Zubarah as a part of their own territory (the family had been based there before their conquest of Bahrain in 1783). The British authorities did not recognise the Al Khalifa's claim to Zubarah and mediated between the two sides. The file contains extensive details of this mediation process.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000156#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
