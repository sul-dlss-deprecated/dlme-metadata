If you will remember His excellency the Sheikh was very anxious to proceed to Basrah on the Saturday immediately fol lowing your visit to urait, returning again on Sunday and you very kindly told him that you would ask if it was possible to arrange on aeroplane for him. i 3. To show is Excellency that you had not forgotten your promise I told him that as soon as you had gone on board the 'Patrick Stewart' you had sent off a message (T-26) asking if tk.is could be arranged. 4. As nothing further was heard from Aviation about the mat- ter, except Bahrain’s belated telegram Ho. 1702 dated 17th attached, I felt bound to ex lain to tlie Sheikh what had hap pened especially as he seemed to consider it rather strange that no reply had been received from anyone regarding the mat ter. I made a point, of course, of explaining that you at any rate had done your best. lon’ble Lt* Colonel H. V. )iscoe, olitical resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 5.[U 5. The Sheikh expressed the greatest astonishment r.hcn I shOTTed hiid Aviation’s message to you as repeated under your o. T-46 to me, and extracted a promise from me that I would write and toll you that he felt mystified and hurt at the suggestion that permission had been asked from the ’Iraq ovemment to his visiting Basrah* Fe explained that he was a landlord and house owner in Basrah city and owned much property opposite ’Ashar apart from anything he possess ed at Fao. Further he frequently visited Basrah as a pri vate individual and always received the greatest courtesy from ubeir and Basrah officials when doing so. Lastly that when he had once before preferred a similar request during Colonel Fore’s time, a flyigg boat had been at once sent doun for him. &gt;• e trusted that you v*)uld be able to explain to the Air Officer Commanding in a tactful way, that if no aero- plane could be spared at the time tie request was made, he oulcl have much preferred an immediate reply to that effect, as ho could then have arranged his journey by car. As it was he failed to get to Basrah and attend a most important engagement entirely through the fault of someone in Baghdad not having the courtesy to reply to your telegram promptly. 7. I fear the present is another unfortunate example of the loyal Air Force’s tactless methods. I have, of course, endeavoured to soothe things down and calm the Sheikh’s ruf- j. leu. foelin ’ , but incidents like the present one make mat ters none too easy for me in my dealings with the Sheikh. Like all Arabs he is extremely sensitive, and will do any-thine for onyono if approached the right way. Conversely he is capable of the greatest obstinacy and obstruction if he gets i o into his hood that he is being treated with discourtesy* Is It does seem a pity that some of the higher British officials in Baghdad do not realize that the Sheikh is an independent ■uler, and try and be a little less casual and rough in their dealings ith him. le has always shorn the greatest goodwill and friendliness for us English, and especially for British troops and the oyal ITavy. That he is developing quite an op posite feeling for the Royal Air I orce is not only true, but I Tin. fear not entirely^justified. Yours Sincerely,i3uBhire, 9th January 1920. D.0. Ho. 11-S of 1930. Please refer to your demi-official letter Wo. SI ' 734, dated the 28th Peceflnber J.930jr There seems to have heen a real mix ux) about the Shaikh's trip to Basrah, and Prior who has just been here spoke to me about it. On receipt of Aviation’s wire l replied that special permission of Iraq did not seem necessary, etc. The next thing they did was to wire to BahT ain saying that a plane was being sent there to take the Shaikh to Basrah, and Prior then sent his telegram to you. By that time it was presumably too late. I agree that it was very unfortunate, but 1 did ny best, and mistakes will occur. As soon as the present situation clears up, the Brooke-Pophams and 1 are going on a tour to the Trucial Coast, but 1 think it would be a good thing if we called in at Kuwait first and spent a day t lie re, and Brooke-Popham and 1 had a talk with the Shaikh.

Charter of Aeroplane ; Imperial Airways Machine for His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait. In continuetion of my telegram No.201 dated 1st April 1930. I have bhe honour to forward copies of telegraphic correspondence which passed between this office and the Manager,Imperial Airways, Basrah on the subject of a machine which His .Excellency the Shaikh was anxious to charter to take him and myself to Basrah on the 1st of April on a purely private visit. 'The telegrams speak for themselves. You will doubtless recollect that I first approached you \7ith a re .uest from His Excellency, that if it could possibly be arranged he would be most grateful Ij. the Royal Air Force could fly him to Basrah. You replied that Aviation regretted that no aeroplane was available. On my conveying your message to the Shaikh he'asked me to try and fix something up with Airways,Ltd.,Basrah. This I tried to do with the result The strange behaviour of the Manager, Imperial airwaysat jasrah, who first says he can supply a machine at £40/- and then 12 hours after his r te is accepted, and the maohirift oowo 4-Vi seen.inefficiency some where, or an attempt to impose on the Shaikh and extort a higher fee than would be •harged to an ordinary passenger. I naturally advised the Shaikh to refuse to pay such an exhorbitant sum of £80/- for a single trip of less than 80 miles, and was about to send in a written complaint to the General ^ianager, Imperial Airways Ltd. ingsway,London, when I received your telegram 322 of 31st March (received 1st April). I am therefore contenting myself with reporting the facts to you with the request that if you see no objection^a copy of my letter be sent to the 'lead Of Pice of the Company in London^with any remarks you yourself may Ilka to add . In the present instance the Shaikh of course had made all arrangements to visit Basrah and had had his house got ready and had sent servants on by road. He was not only keenly disappointed at having to cancel all his plans, but was inclined to throw the blame on me for mismanaging affairs. From the first he had desired to avoid going by road himself, as by old established custom he must disburse Rs.SOOO/- at Zubair every time he goesthrough. He has decided now': not to go at all. It may be of interest to know that recently Abdul Rahman al-^osaibi and His Excellency Hafith Wahba both chartered 'Airways” machines and visited Kuwait (at a flat rate of £40)also other flights have been made ; by the company to Bahrain. It seems strange therefore that when the Political Agent at Kuwait, himself tries to charter a machine for the ^uler, reference must be madd by Airways to ^ndon and the Colonial Office be drawn in. I make this comment quite apart from the question at issue,which concerns the sudden raising of the agreed rate of £40 to £80. I refrain also from making any suggestion as to whether the company -3- #0- @ oomx^any has rendered itself liable or not in law for breach of agreement. The pity of it all is that the Shaikh of Kuwait is a well-wisher of the company and has long been anxious to see Kuwait used as an Air port of call on the route to India via the Arab Seaboard, Should this scheme eventually fall through, he has stated his intention repeatedly of trying to get the company to run a local feeder service between Basrah and Kuwait, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K' .

I now forward for ycur Information a copy of a telegram from Dickson on the subject. I have, of course, not heard what Imperial Airways have to say about the matter but I cannot help feeling that in the general Interests of British Civil Aviation In this part of toe world It Is desirable that they should go cut of their way a little to try and meet the wishes of Influential clients who want to travel by aeroplane and that It is a pity that this Incident should have cocur ed. Even had the flight not as a matter of fact proved ; profitable at the rate originally aucted by them it would have been a good advertisement, and would probably hav« lead s to other similar oharter flights In the future. I express no opinion about the charge made, which was possibly justified though at first sight -.80 seems high. My point is that an incident of this nature Is net calculated to encourage Arab rulers to travel by British aeroplane, and ; after all toe time may come when there will be ether competi- / tors in toe field (Junkers have, as you know, already asked once to be allowed to undertake flights to Bahrein) and It would bo unfortunate if Intending travellers on the Arab Coast turned to foreign firms rather than to British. 1 have therefore thought It desirable to ^rlng the il | / matter to ycur notice. / i Sir John Shuck burgh,» 1/ !

My dear Fowle, f Shaikh ^hmad ©arae and sa?/ me yesterday and said that he would much like to run up to Baghdad and a personal and strictly nrlvate visit to His Majesty King Faisal, somewhere about the end of August. 2 ' His idea is to go by launch from Kuwait to jao, where he will spend the night. Next day he would proceed up the river to Basrah and there spend two (or three days at most) in his own house on the bank of the river. From Basrah if a machine could be arranged, he would like to fly to Baghdad, spend two days there only and return again to Basrah and Kuwait. 4 The Shaikh appeared rather set on the visit, ana said the change would do him good, apart from his keen desire to see King Faisal, who he has never yet met. X told him I wcdid write and mention the matter to you and that if you saw no objection, I felt sure you would ^ enquire from Baghdad as to whether the Shaikh’s visit would he | welcomed by King Faisal, and if so what would be suitable dates for him toYeach Safe'-dad. Ho doubt the Shaikh who is feeling most anxious these days about the Date Gardens question, hopes to discuss this ^ sore problem with the King though he did not say so to me. 1 do 1 not think any harm can come of that, perhaps goo&lt; ; . 7# That the Shaikh shaild get to know Faisal personal ly, I also think would be a good thing.

I do not altogether feel happy about it as His Excellency’s excursions into personal diplomacy have not in refuse his request as he would not unnaturally hold that as a meet His Majesty personally, and if he can get anything out of the latter as to his gardens so much the better. I do not think, however, that it would be a good thing for you to go with him, as this - even though his visit is a purely private one - might in the eyes of the ’Iraqis give it an official, or semi-official flavour, while personally I think he is probably more likely to be welcomed in ’Iraqi circles if he goes by himself without any British Officer in attendance. On the other hand if he makes a mess of things I should like it to be self-evident that the responsibility is entirely his, which it will have to be if he went alone.

No: C/245-6/7 Political Agency, Bahrain,tne 2nd July 1933. I wonder if I might asic you, if you see no objection and have a suitable opportunity,to drop a word into the ear of Shaikh Ahmad on the following matter. 2. Three Wapitis landed on the Royal Air Force landing ground at Manamah during his stay and he asked Shaikh Hamad what they were doing there. Shaikh Hamad replied that he knew nothing about them. / 3. I had myself asked Shaikh Hamad in conversation some N time before,whether he had any objection to their landing at kuharraq . His permission for them to land at kuharraq had also been asked and given in writing (landing at Manamah. is governed by a regular written agreement) and,incidentally,Shaikh Hamad and his son,Shaikh Salman,had talked of it with Belgrave. It is quite possible that Shaikh Hamad may have forgotten about this, or he may not have realised tnat these machines,which had landed at Manamah instead of kuharraq were the same as those about which I had spoken and written as wishing to land at Muharraq . In any case,it seems probable that there was some misunderstanding,either on Shaikh Hamad’s part or Shaikh Ahmad’s. 4. I have,however,heard (and from an unimpeachable source) that at a dinner on his yacht to certain kembers of the American Community,Shaikh Ahmad mentioned this lack of knowledge on the part of Shaikh Hamad and that this could not have happened in Kuwait,where his permission would have had to be asked before aeroplanes landed. Certainly one,and presumably all,of the Americans took it that he was criticising us for disregarding the local Ruler and the local Ruler for allowing himself to be disregarded.5 . As I said above,I think that the whole thing was based on a misunderstanding, quite probably of Shaikh Hamad’s when Shaikh Ahmad asked him about the aeroplanes; but it seems to me to be a great pity that a friendly Ruler on a friendly visit, should allow himself to criticize in public (particularly before Americans) his Host and his Host’s relations with us. I fear that he finds it hard to forego any opportunity,both among Arabs and Europeans, of a ’dig’ (social or otherwise) at his old fashioned,and less politically minded,fellow Ruler. you would give Shaikh Ahmad an hint that talking in this way is hardly becoming or, indeed,expedient. 6. I only heard of this matter just before Shaikh Ahmad left and so had no opportunity of myself putting in a quiet word 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to Colonel lowle.

He requested that H.U.G. be advised of this by telegram. 3&gt; shaikh said that postponement of delegates arrival in this eleventh hour fashion, was most upsetting for himself, and he regretted that his own convenience had not been considered more. -POLITICAL-(^) S K Copy of my letter No. C-178 dated the 13th June 19 35 addressed to H.B.M’s Consul, Baghdad, with compliments to the Man ger Thomas Cook &amp; Sons, New Street Baghdad f who will very kindly take over His ^oeUency the Shaikh of Kuwait and Party 1 s Passpcrts from H.B.M’s Consul and pay all necessary passport and visa fees on behalf of the Shaikh.

I of course see what you mean, but unfortunately Shaikh’s A*ab point of view differes from ours in that with him so called honour comes before everything, and tactical defeat or victory means nothing if major point at issue (relief from blockade) remains unaffected. Shaikh argued very het-tedly.,with me yesterday to effect that.- (a) Neither Bin Saud nor he had sought Conference. (b) Former because he naturally did not wish abandon lucrative blockade, and he because he knows that no amount of talking will force Bin Saud to do so, if the will is not there. (o) He has told H.M.G. before that aalv hope of success is in direct pressure on~Bin Saud. If this course does not commend itself, then much better drop whole question. Conference only bring insults and dishonour on him. X personally do not think we need be over anxious about things.

I have gone into question again in the light Shaikh’s attitude and should (be) glad if you would take into account following co ns i derat ions;- (a) We do no t admit validity Shaikh’s arguments as regards Director Customs and he appears to be confusing smuggling with legitimate trade. Moreover (b) While Shaikh rejects H.M.G’s strong advice and says that he is prepared face blockade by IRAQ, he somewhat inconsistently looks to H.M.G. to limit blockade in respect certain matters id est his dates produced in Iraq and water supply. 2nd Part. Though presumably strict blockade contemplated bv IRAQ Government primarily means y prohi bition of imports from Kuwait, they have H.M.G. ere unable guarantee that aich a step would be held to accede Iraq Government’s them from taking it. In any case prospects Iraq seeking to apply such ext re die measure s of ooerslon seam apart from other cons id impossible for H.M.G. t i derat ions to make it to wash their hands- 2 - 0~:&gt; his intransigent attitude. (o) Prospect moreover that H.M.G. could if an extreme strain is placed on Kuwait Iraq relations succeed obtaining satisfaction over o^inership date gardens would, almost vanish, ffhile this and smuggling problem are distinct in theory, Iraq Government are unlikely keep them separate in practice, and final failure over date gardens would be both expensive to H.M.G. and damaging to them in the Persian Gulf. 3rd Part * Id) (e) H.M.G. have in all discussions given full weight to arguments advanced by you and Govt, of India against direct intervention. They quite agree that it may be rossible let matters take tbeir course for some little time, but they remain of opinion that inter- v ait ion will be necessary sooner or later, if (as is essential) they are to maintain their control of Kuwait relations with her neighbours and avoid odium of failure to protect her, which would inevitably fall back on H.M.G., despite any disclaimer of res- pons ibility. It has be ai for this reason that they have been so anxious for equitable via Media. If IRAQ, is now allowed to apply sanctions it will be quite impossible in practice for H.M.G* to ± 83 ssx insure Ihese are kept within legitimate limits or to secure any real satis Action from Iraq if they are not. ihat cannot fail do us damage locally. 4th Part. (f) Moreover if sanctions are sufficiently ^ effective to ml® Shaikh sue for terms there can be no question that terms asked by Iraq be far more severe than at present. (a) You will apart frcm this appreciate that if serious situation develops later, ano^haik then asks our support H.M.G. might vvell be reluctant risk grave breach with Ira^. ^ which their interests are so great, merely IS cycler Steloate sfedkh from difficulty of his own making which can aT ®Jf® d .^ y ^ adopting a less intransigent attitude now. S. If in the light above and in particular para 2(b) you are prepared appirach Shaikh further we should we loon® it. and trust you will do all in your power make him sea reason. | 5tfe Part . 4.

His Yxcellenoy Tde of Koweit, k.c.i.e., C.S.I.P.Z. 4923^55&gt; V A meeting was hell at the India Office on 15th July to discuss the auestlon of Koweit-Ira* smuggling with His Excel leney the Sheith of Kuweit. In addition to the Sheikh and his interpreter there were present: Sir Leonard YJakely, K.C.I.E., C.B. in the Cnair. Mr.J.C. Walton, C.B., M.C. ) Ur.J.G. Laithwalte, C.I.E. ) offloe _ Mr.M.J.

Ward ) Kowelt—Iraq Smuggling . a) t.’F.OTIABD WAKELY expressed to His Excellency the pleasure of those present at having an opportunity of meeting him. After some preliminary discussion, in the course of wh ca the Sheikh intimated that he had certain other questions to raise besides the question of the smuggling, the Sheikh askea Tj. a n Government reauired of Koweit in what exactly it was the Iraa uove^ the matter of smuggling, m . mM EL «• *“ IrM * '7 , dateralaa, to stop t» ‘ ^ sever measures against had to employ and had threatened to , were possible. H.M.G.. on the other . o,ei . if no otner t to reaoh ^ amicable settlement hand, were anxious to hel. ^ ^ aues tions. H.M.G. had had long experience in dealing illegal smuggling into the o.^.a. and he instanced the case of ill s as a case/[%j- ■ © a3 a ease where one country (H.tl.G.) had agreed to help another country (the U.S.A.) to stop smuggling hy instituting a system of manifests and hy allowing British vessels to he searched for contraband outside American territorial waters, although H.Ji.G., like Koweit, had been under no legal obligation to do so. Tne friendly attitude adopted by H.M.G. had been much appreciated by the U.S.Government and had had a generally beneficial effect on the relations between them and H.M.G. What H.M.G. suggested was that His Excellency should follow their example in this case, and take an equally broad and farsighted point of view, and that he should in his own interests cooperate with Iraa rather than rush into a quarrel which might have much more serious consequen ces than were apparent at present. They did not suggest that the Shaikh should give up any of his rights or Independence, but that he should take certain steps voluntarily. He quite realised that any measures taken by His Excellency to check smuggling would involve financial losses to his people, but it was better to cooperate with Iraq in suppressing smuggling and thus preserve j-- +&gt;, 0 ^ hP sub looted to an Iraq.! blockade legitimate trade ratVier than be suDjecxeu which put an end to all trade of an:/ kind.

King Abdul Aziz naa PP his/m his borders himself and Persia had also taken certain measures, and so could the Iraq. Government if they wanted to do so. It was impossible for His Excellency himself to do it for them, and he did not see why he should accept a responsibility which was really tneirs. heudeL said that Iraq, could certainly prevent the smuggling, but that if the Iraqi Government did this in their own way and took similar measures to those taken by King Abdul Aziz, it would be very serious for Koweit. THE S’-lEddOj said that he was quite prepared to accept what the Saudis had done. He was also prepared to help the Iraq Government against smuggling by sea by instituting a manifest system, but by land the Iraq Government must take their own measures. ME. IAITHWAITE said that His Excellency T s offer to institute a system of manifets by sea was much appreciated. The Iraq Government had however emphasise^, that their real difficult ies were by land. He asked whether His Exoellenoy might not be* prepared also to institute a manifest system by land as well as by sea, on the assumption that the Iraq Government on their side would establish, say, four Iraqi Customs posts on the frontier through which trade could be canalised. He emphasised that the India Office were most anxious to saieguard Koweit in this THE SHEIKH pointed out that the difficulty on land that Koweit supplied goods to several countries and that there several routes leading from Koweit.

The Sheikh's responsibility would have been discharged by the issue of the manifest. THE SHEIKH said that in that case he was quite willing to t -ive manifests to all those who passed out of Koweit en route to Xraq. The manifest would state the quantities of the goods carried, but would not mention the route to be travelled, or the point at which the frontier would be crossed, since the Koweit authorities could not be responsible for the actual route that the man might take. His Excellency agreed, however. **th a suggestion by Mr. Ward that the manifest also state that it was given 'for Irq', but he said he knew that no one going to Iraq would ever tell the truth as to his destination, or ta*» out a manifest, since little or no profit could be made if Customs duty had to be paid at the Iraq frontier. His Excellency agreed, however, that if any man were caught by the Iraq authorities carrying goods without a manifest, the man himself would be held responsible and would have to take consequences. m. LAITHWAITK said that an arrangement ouch suggested by the Sheikh would be of great value, and that his offer of it was much appreciated by H.M.G. RKKDEL agreed.

HR. LAITHWAITE said that an arrangement such as thax suggested by the Sheikh would be of great value, and that hio offer of it was much appreciated by Eft. REHHEL agreed. He added that the details oi t ic system , 10I1 U1 W would require working out and that it would have to he put to the Iraq. Government. The idea was that there should be. as it were, gates in the Iraq frontier, for the passage of legitimate trade, and that any merchandise not going through these gates would be stopped by the Iraq authorities. It would be better to have wall with gatesthan a wall without any opening at all. MR. LAITHWAITE/L&gt;r@ 5. H L ' \h, LAITHWAITE enquired whether His Hxoelienoy had any organised oustoms service at present whiofe would he capable of issuing manifests. A responsible official would be necessary to issue* manifests not only for Iraq, but also for ^audi Arabia (if solution of the question of the Saudi blockade were reached on the basis suggeated by the Shaikh of oustoma posts.** and manifests) and also, onoe the Kuwait Oil Company commenced operations, to deal with imports by it. His Excellency said that he already had at Koweit two special Customs officials, one for trade by sea and one for trade by land who worked under his direct control, and were persons of sufficient authority and standing to issue such manifests. MR. WAIT OS reverted to the question of the counter proposal which the Sheikh was said to have mentioned to Colonel Dickson at Kow.lt. H.M.C. had understood from the latter's report that His Excellency In discussion of the matter in London mign* be able to make s.me counter offer as an alternative to the Iraa&gt; intention to impose a blockade. His Excellency had now accepted . a+inr, in regard to manifests but had ne not Mr.Latthwaiie T b auggaa- j on in &amp; some further proposal of his own to ma3ce? ’ , , ■x.-x v, p had no further suggestions to THE SHEIKH said that ie -aa wt t».t h. ... pr...r« « ““»* «* —«'=*•' 11 t „. i W «• ' 1 “ el e + n tne appointment of a British Customs had foi^arri^- referred to tne ai-P v ix r fcr which he saw no necessity.

THE SHEIKH said that Koweit, which derived its Customs revenue from the trade at one port only, could not afford to pay for such a Customs Director, but m. LAITHWAITS reminded His Excellency that Iraq had offered to pay the cost. His Excellency expressed his dislike of having at Koweit an official paid by the Iraq Government, but Mg. LAITHWAITE said that though Iraq might orovide the money, there would be no question but that the Director would be in His Excellency ! s own service and that he need not be paid by the Iraq Government direct. The source of the payment need not be known. EXCELLEHITY then said that he would not mind paying the Director himself. It was not a question of money. What he faLkj&amp;x objected to was the proposal itself, and he did not see the necessity for it since smuggling could be stopped without it. The Iraq Government could take the same measures themselves as Ibn Saud had done. Mt. LAJTHWAITE Said that this might lead to very serious complications which H*M.G. were most anxious to avoid. H.M.G., however, much appreciated the suggestions which His Excellency had now made for a settlement and as the Sheikh was reluctant to agree to the appointment of a British Customs Director, they would make a further attempt to reach a settlement with Iraq on the basis of those suggestions..(E) 'H * ^ ( 2 ) Ghelkh of Koweit T s Date Gardens in Iraq,. HIS EXCELLECY reminded the meeting of the pledge which H.K.G. had given him in 1914 that his lands in Iraq, would he p reserV ed for himself and his successors and that they would he free from all taxation, lie explained that the Iraq. Governaient had imuosed a tax on the produce of the land exported from Iraq., but that this tax was not being oaid by the exporters themselves but had had to be defrayed for the last frhre-e- few years out of his own pocket. His Excellency had given details of his expenses to Colonel Hickson, but nothing had yet been done by H.K.G. hr. TjAITHY /AITS said that H.&amp;.G. had fought hard to reach a settlement with the Iraq Government both on the question of the Sheikh* s title to his lands and on the question of taxation and would continue to do so. MR. REIlHgL &amp;aded he had talked to Hurl Pasha on the important question of title a few days ago and had impressed upon him the importance of m** settling this matter quickly. Nuri Pasha had promised to attend to It on his return to Baghdad.(5) Saudi Blockade of Koweit. THE SHEIKH said that in he had received a letter from concerning Ui3 trade with Itfejd, promising that if His Excellency would prevent help being given to Faisal al Duv/ish, t v q. would endeavour to reach a solution oi his trade difxicul- ties with King Ahdul Aala. His ExeeUenoy oarried out his part and had even fought with al luwis'n's people, but H.li.O., for their part, had as yet failed to make any progress towards a solution of the blockade. A Saudi deputation of 8J persons had iad recently visited Koweit. but His Excellency thought that no good had come of the conference which had taken place. jfiu KAKKA'AITE said that for soae tiae H.U.G. had been trying hard to reach a solution of the bioekade question with King leu Abdul Asia, and that, an the Oheikn would remember the prppsal for a conference regarding it, which had now materialised, had originated -'itb the late Sir Hugh Biscoe. He reminded the Sheikh that matters had been held ut for more th “ !1 a year owing to a misunderstanding abo t cerxair, oorresponat-noe between His Excellency and the King of Saudi Arabia. After briefly recalling- the proce dings at the recent Conference at Koweit. he said that K.K.G. regard. . it as satisfactory that the Sa di deligation had gone so far as freeing the principal of a system of manifests and Customs posts. h-.G. entirely agreed taut the Sued! demand foe a guarantee as a condi- ^ e „r, +h*s ba«is that not a single Koweit ticn of agreement on tn^s oa-io, am£Sl „ .0«ia m &lt;. a. »«**•■• “» '' Ml.

Polltloal Heoident in the i orelan Cul., B U 6 HIJLJLlurope generally f hare not been aa startling as one saiKht auppoee, ihat did impreaa him was tihe superiority of London end F.nglishiaen over laris and ’renobiBen, in such matters as oleanlinas&amp;t methods of business, and prosperity* He also was greatly struck with London's wealth, 'You talk about England'a trade 1 , he said, *t a If she was on the rocks, when in reality she has never been so prosperous; the spending powers of the people prove this beyond doubt n . 5 # The i hai^h, on the other hand soema to be really grateful for the very kind treatment which he received at the hands of everyone he cam® in contact with in London* He has again and again referred to this and especially to the kind and sympathetic treatment of India Office officials idio he said he felt were championing him inspite of difficulties, ?roni the noment he arrived at Dover, he enid that he was made to feel that he was among inglishmen who were genuine friends, and who were anxious to find out the real truth about the dangers which bes^t him in the *ulf, and his point of view about things* He further added in an outburst of confidence, that it did not take him long to discover, what he always suspect,a to b« the oose, that the /oretgn Office la their aethoae foh- lowed '•xpedionoy' rather than 'Juatloe' - and that in the matter of Iraq's sung lint', aocuaations againat nuwnit, had gone out to brine the pressure they had done, on Kuwait purely beoause they wanted to keep on the rl ht side of the roq Government. The quest ton of whether Kuwait had Jur.tioe on her aide or waa belnR outrageously buUied by her two big Arab Belabours did not seem to worry the orelgn ufrioa »»oh.

To use his words, 'X told them that either they in London, did not choose of set purpose, to take notice of the reports and statements of their officers In the* Persian Gulf f about what was happening, or they considered them untrue, and how was it that they seemed to be more anxious always to help their enemies at the expense of thalr friends? q # The shaikh said that in spite of all the home truths, which he had spoken, and the unpalatable things which he had felt bound to utter, his remarks were not ungenerously received but then he was dealing with Knglieh gentlemen, who were out to hear and understand to the full, his point of view. — 4 .^ van me the Impression Lord Zetland, that those in high Kuwait and her cry for justice', is more th^n half the buttle. *» ftnd tliia said the shaikh, now discovered, wl elsewhere, that ci is worth all the be made to BritiaL are not out to ha Ip him, but i*« My own ^ but because their efforts aem to beto be nulliflecL la Loadau* 'Ilils X euppoee is on© of the evils Of the modem tendency to centralize everything.

Hence what more natural from hie point of view than for himself to personally and n#it hie battles at the Heart of the Empire* It is X fear the clash between the Indian Oovernsaent's and the London Foreign Office systems, and recalls Bin feud's words to me when X first naet him In Hoffuf in 1920 - 'I want to be under your English ?orel&amp;i Off ice 9 be onus e htr officials know noth lug 9 end X shall be able to suocss fully play with them; X want to get away fx*om Indian Govemment control because her officers know too much and it is impossible to deceive them'* H 9 I hope you realize one thin*u hea the Lhaikh went to ngland in June he was a very desperate man and believed that His Majesty*s Government was weakening as a result of Iraq pressure, and that shortly Kuwait would case under Iraq’s control* nothing that X could say would shake this belief and I confess ho had some reason to thiJi£ as he did frora tha things that ware said to him* He carried the good wishes of his people with him when h© went and was prepared to petition the King personally for Help in maintaining Kuwait** independence.

The local correspondent reporter- noticed froa the beginning of our convarBation that Hie Highneee is *ell diepoaed towards the Arebio prase* He hinted, however, that iournelists sometimes publish news before confirming the truth thereof. Certain sections of the press stated that His Highness presented a precious pearl, found in his domains, to Hie Majesty King George. But the truth of the matter wee thet Hie Highness took the pearl with him to England to show it to experts and brought it back with him for inclusion in his collection of precious jewels. I told Hie Highness thet the origin of the news was e telegram from London which our papers published without comment. I am glad to know that this unique pearl will remain in hie palace. HIb interview with the King of England . I asked His Highness about hie visit to London; whether he enjoyed it and achieved the object of his journey? His Highness said he enjoyed his journey and expressed hie pleasure at meeting King George who was, together with the whole Bri'tieh netion, most hospitable. Ihough hie visit was private and non-official, the English wished to make it semi official. When I asked him whether he could tell me how succeeaful had been the purpose of his journey, His Highness replied that he was not at liberty to say anything about that. Between Nejd and Kowelt^ X questioned His Highness about the truth of the news, published// published in the papers f regarding the break-down of negotiatione between hie government and the sc^udi Arabian government respecting the questions in euepenae between the two countries, and about the possibility of e resumption of the negotiations. His Highness confirmed the news, stating that before his journey to London, the Saudi Mission, which consisted of 8d persons (the delegatee and their retinue), were guests at his palace. Ihe negotiations broke down because the two parties failed to reach agreement on one point. He declarer 5 that the negotiations will be resumed in the near future and that the contested point will be solved in a manner satisfactory to both parties. He added the bonds of ancient friendship which attach him end His Majesty King Abdul Asi? will never break or weaken and will greatly facilitate the negotiations. Between Kowelt and Trap, When I enquired about the relations between Koweit and Iraq, His Highness replied that they ere excellent. We are one nation, one people and one hand linked together by ti &lt;- bonds of national sentiment end religion. The Koweiti in Iraq or the Iraqi in Koweit feels that he is at home among his own people. The Kowcitie and the Iraqis are brothers. I asked whether any efforts were being made to join Koweit and Basra by a railway. He replied that nothing is being done at present but that It wee not Impossible thet such a project be realised in the future. I said that news telegrams stated that His Highness intends to make great efforts to improve health In hie country after hie return to Kowelt and to employ Arab experts for thet purpose. X asked whether he woul sendingB«ndlru; student b abroad to study. Hie Highneee, with a Baile, replied thot eoae Syrians had suggested to him ©ending students abroad for educational purposes, and thnt he would consider this suggestion. On ay enquiring whether Syria will have the honour of receiving o party of such students, Hie Highness sailed again, saying *In she Allah”. (D.V.) Between Kowelt and Bahrein. To *y enquiries about the relations between the different Aairates of the Persian Gulf and the results and objects of the Aair of Bahrain’s visit to Koweit, His Highness replied that the visit was a friendly one. For a long time His Highness and the Amir of Bahrain had been in the habit of visiting one another periodically, such vioits hax no political significance as complete concord exists between Koweit and Bahrain, for Arabs in all lands are brothers. Finally Hie Highness spoke of his love for a„ t rabe end of hie appreciation of the warm welcome givyn him by the Syrians and especially the Damascenes •CONFIDENTIAL. Air ^ No. 798-S of 1935.
