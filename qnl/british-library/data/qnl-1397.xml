Jacohabad, 2Sth December 1SC9. From, Captain C. W. HARRISON, POLITICAL AGENT, KELAT. To, TEE POLITICAL SUPERINTENDENT, ■ FRONTIER UPPER SIND. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and to annex returns giving the information called for in the 1st, 2nd5 3rd, and 5th paras, of letter under reply. 2. Regarding the 4ith para., 100 rank and file of the Body Guard, one field-piece, and one mortar comprised the strength of the regular horse that accompanied Daroga Atta Mahomed on the Mekran expedition. The major part of the fighting Regiment and the regular Cavalry, with four guns and a proportionate amount of Artillery men, accompanied the Shagassee. 3. The Khan's force being larger than was supposed, T propose to show the circumstances under which the old Regiment was sub-divided and increased. 4. When His Highness was deposed by his cousin Shere Dil, part of the old Regiment elected to go over to the new Khan, whilst about 200 accompanied Khodadad Khan to Nusseerabad in Cutchee. On his being re elected to the Khanate, bad feeling existed in the Regiment from their having espoused different causes. His Highness then formed those who had remained true to him into a Body Guard, and the remainder into a fighting Kegiment, increasing both to their present strength. 5. Some of the discontented having stated that His Highness support ed his regular troops from confiscated lands, I am in a position to state that such is not the case. His Highness has sufficient revenue from his lands at Bhagwana, Kelat, Mustoong, Cutchee and other places, besides the transit dues, to support his small Eorce. The only Sirdaree lands estranged are those of the Raisanee Chief, and I showed in my letter of the 10th of June that His Highness was quite willing to restore them. The actual income of this Sirdar, taking everything into consideration, used to be about 6,000 rupees per annum. 6. Except under peculiar circumstances the fighting Regiment would furnish about 300 men for the protection of Quettah and Cutchee, and as it is( 84 ) His Highness' intention to establish a post at Kozdar for the protection of Kafilas, and the people in the neighbourhood, only half of the Regiment would be available for any emergency. lie the r this Force distributed in this way is more than His Highness requires, may be open to discussion. Taking into consideration the formidable combination against them, and the disciplined men and persons that the Jam ofBeylahad at his disposal; as also that the disaffected considered themselves strong enough to cope with the said force on several occasions, I do not think that His Highness' Force has been in excess of his requirements ; and now that his chief difficulty is over, I think that his regular troops if judiciously employed in giving detachments for the protection of trade and his people, could scarcely be thought excessive. His Highness states that it would be more economical and satisfactory than keeping up Levies, as the latter cannot be depended upon to stay from their homes for any length of time. 7. The list of friendly Sirdars that I have had the honor to attach, appears to be very excessive, in comparison with the disaffected. I have however seen and conversed with most of them, and can vouch for the accuracy of the list up to the present time. The disadvantage however that His Highness labours under, is, that his well-wishers are so far apart, that time must elapse to enable him to collect them together. On the other hand, the evil disposed have great facilities of combining, from the Mingul tribe being so near Kozdar. 8. During the time I was at Kelat, only one or two people complained that the sepoys had pilfered their fruit. On His Highness being made aware of what had occurred, arrangements were made to prevent recurrences of these petty thefts. 9. A great number of the Body Guard are men holding certificates of good conduct from the 1st and 2nd Belooch Regiments in which they had served for live years. 10. The Cavalry are for the most part Hindustani and Seikhs, who served for some years in the Sind Horse, prior to the reduction that took place in 18GO or 1861. They are well behaved and very much respected. The annual cost of His Highness' Force is 1,14,402 llupees. I have, &amp;c., C. II.
