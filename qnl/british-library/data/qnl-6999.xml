[ This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's G ov ernment.] [E 13523/9/441 FOREIGN OFFICE MEMORANDUM ON ARABIAN POLICY. I IT is submitted that the time has now arrived for an authoritative decision on the whole question of the political and financial obligations to be incurred in the future by His Majesty's Government in Arabia. The question was discussed by an intei- dep;irtmeiital meeting at the Foreign Office on the 17th April (Appendix (C)),biit mat ers had not then advanced sufficiently for concrete recommendations to be ma le. The position is now that negotiations are shortly to be opened in Paris between His Majesty's Government and the French Government iti the first place, and eventually between the principal Allied Powers, on the subject of Arabia. _ . By Arabia is meant the area bounded on the north-wes by the peninsula of Sinai and the British mandatory areas ot Palestine and Trans-Jordan ; on the north-east by the British mandatory area of Mesopotamia ; on the east by the Persian Gult ; on the south-east by the Indian Ocean, and on the west by the lied Sea. A more detailed description of what is defined as the peninsula of Arabia will be found in Appendix (A). 2. The population of Arabia consists almost entirelv of Arab tribal elements, grouped in some cases into large confederations, who acknowledge the sovereignty of one individual. In the case of the Hedjaz, this individual is the Sherif of Mecca, vn ho has been recognised by the Allied Powers as King of the Hedjaz, I he boundaries of the Hedjaz have never been defined, but the Hedjaz as a State was an original member of the League of Nations, and so long as it remains so it stands on an entirely different footing from the remainder of the peninsula. 3. From the correspondence in Appendix (Bi it will be seen that the India Otlice and the Foreign Office are in agreement that Arabia, exclusive of the Hedjaz and Aden, should be regarded as falling into ten main sub-divisions, and that their present policy is to deal with each of these sub-divisions through one individual, with the two exceptions of the Trucial Coast of Oman and the tribe of the Anazeh, who acknowledge no single ruler. The ten divisions are as follows :— Nejd ... Hail ... Koweit Bahrein Muscat Trucial Coast Hadramaut Y emen Asir ... Anuzeh Ibn Saud. Ibn Rash id. Sheikh Salim. Sheikh of Bahrein. Sultan of Muscat. Petty Chiefs. Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. Imam Yahya. Idrisi Said. No single ruler. (It should be remarked that the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whose inclusion was recommended by the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, in his telegram No. 15123 of the 15th December, 1919, is a Persian subject, and that his dominions he m Persian 4. ^Appendix (A) is the draft of a treaty dealing with the settlement ol the Arabian Peninsula. This draft was prepared by the British Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris in consultation with the Foreign Office, who had previously consulted a number of experts on Arab affairs, and had communicated copies of an earlier draft to the India Office, the Director of Military Intelligence and the Admiralty. 6. It will be noticed that in article 3 His Majesty's Government are endeavouring to secure the recognition by the other Allied Powers of the special political interests ot Great Britain in the Arabian Peninsula in view of its proximity to parts of the British Empire and to maritime communications with India. But this is not the only reason why His Majesty's Government desire recognition of their special position in Arabia. They have been for many years in intimate relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and the Sultan of Muscat, the Irucial Chief's, Ibn Saud and the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla—to such an extent, indeed, that it has B 336 [4618]2 been generally recognised by other Powers th;it their interference in the territories of these rulers would he regarded as an unfriendly act. Out of the remaining four rulers in the list in paragraph 3, the territories of two, namely, the Imam and the Tdrisi, are coterminous with the Aden protectorate, while the territories of the other two, namely, Ibn Kashid and the Anazeh, are coterminous with the British mandatory areas of Mesopotamia and Trans-Jordan. The only other Power which cmu legitimately claim an interest in any of the ten areas defined in paragraph 3 is France, since poruons of the Anazeh lie within tlie French mandatory area. It is for this reason that it has been decided to make no attempt to deal with the Anazeh as one confederation under one ri ler, but to legard the eastern section of the trib j as dependent upon Mesopotamia. Anoth r argument for the recognition of British interests in Arabia is the fact that His Majesty's Government are already in treaty relations with all ot the ten areas except the An izeh, Ibn Rashid and the Imam. It is, perhaps, as well, in order t«) remove any misapprehensions as to the object of the Arabian Treaty, which is now being negotiated, to point out that we are endeavouring to obtain no new position in Arabia—at any rate, in so far as eight out of the ten areas are concerned. His Majesty's Government are already regarded hy all the riders, with the possible exceptions of the Imam and Ibn Hashid, as the only foreign Power which has any real interest in the peninsu a. Other Powers are well aware of this, and it is only the separation of Arabia from the Ottoman Empire which renders it desirable to obtain official concurrence from the other Allies to a state of affairs which in effect already exists. The object of the present discussion is merely to arm e at a &lt;50 ordinated policy, which will in future be f llowed by His Majesty's Government, and to decide whether those areas and rulers with whom His Majesty's Government were not intimately connected before the war should now be placed on the same footing as those with whom they have h 'd dealings for many years past, or whether it is necessary to revise the policy of fin ncial support and to withdraw it from those rulers who ha\e been receiving it f &gt;r so long The urgent &lt; eces-ity &lt;»f having some instrument on paper defining the pos'tion of His Majesty's Gove nment in Arabia may be seen from enquiries directed by the German and American Governments as to the position of Bahrein 6. Although the Hedjaz and Aden are excluded from the peninsula as defined in the draft treaty, neither area can be overlooked 'in any discussion of the policy ot His Majesty's Government in Arabia. The independent Kingdom of the Hedjaz contains the Holv Places of Mecca and Medina, which are venerated by Moslems throughout the world, and which are of international importance owing to the yearh pilgrimage. As the Allied Power with the greatest Mahommedan interests, and as the originator of the movement which resulted in the independence of the Hedjaz and the kingship of King Hussein, His Majesty's Government could not readily admit that any other Power is so intimately connected with thp future of that country as herself. In view of its status as an independent member of the League of Nations, it is impossible to include it in the area in which His Majesty's Government are demanding a special position, but the fact that it will be entirely surrounded by areas for which His Majesty's Government are responsible,'or in which His Majesty's Government are, as a matter of fact, in a predominant position already, must inevitably lead to the Hedj iz Government regarding His Majesty's Government as more important to themselves than any other P »wer. The areas bordering on the Hedjaz are the British mandatory areas of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, and the territories of Ibn B.ashid, Ibn Sau&lt;i and the Idrisi, two of whom have agreed to accept the arbitration of His Majesty's Government on frontier questions. King Hussein himself has also agreed to accept this arbitration. The final definition of the frontiers of the Hedjaz could most suitably be embodied in a treaty between King Hussein, on the one side, and His Majesty's Government, as representing his immediate neighbours, on the other. Other Powers might certainly object to tins, but, ever] if they hesitate to confirm in writing the existing British position in Arabia, nothing can alter the fact ihat it is to His Majesty's Govemment alone that all concerned look for a just and satisfactory settlement, and, in whatever manner the boundaries may be ti.xed, British arbitra tion alone will be appealed to in frontier disputes. Apart from the question of boundaries, which may have to be fixed by a commission appointed by 'he League of Nations, there appears to be no insuperable objection to His Majesty's Government concluding a treaty with the independent Kingdom of the Hed'az, as eventually defined, which may or may not include some provision for financial support, providedthat the treaty, when concluded, is laid before the League of Nations. It would, however, be undesirable that the financial support should take the form of an uncon ditional snbsidv. King Hussein was heavily subsidised during the war, when he led the Arab revolt which was supported exclusively by His Majesty's Government. His subsidy has been gradually reduced, and for the last seven months he lias received no payments at all. His attitude towards His Majesty's Government has entire^ changed, and he accuses them openly of having led him during the war to expect a position which he now sees he is unlikely to obtain. On the 19th July the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated a memo randum ''Appendix (Dj) to the Cabinet appealing for an early decision on the question of financial support for King Hussein, but the matter remains under consideration. Since that date matters have gone from bad to worse, and the withdrawal ot financial support, coupled, with the action of the French in Syria, lias confirmed King Hussein in the suspicions with which he regards the Allied Powers, and especially His Majesty s^ Government. Whatever may be decided about our relations with the other rulers of Arabia, it is essential, if we are to preserve our prestige in the Moslem world, that steps should be taken without delay to restore confidence in the mind of the guardian ot the Holv Places of Islam. ' 7. The Aden Protectorate was excluded from the Aden peninsula as defined in the draft treaty more because its inclusion would have given rise to the impression that it was a matter for discussion than because the position of His Majesty's Government in the protectorate, as opposed to the fortress itself, differs materially from the position for which they now demand recognition from the Allied Powers. Between the fortress and what used to be the Turkish Empire are a number of small tribes, with all of whom His Majesty's Government are in treaty relations and who receive purely nominal stipends. The total expenditure under this head amounts to / 0,000 rupees a ^eat, and no alteration in the existing system could well be contemplated unless at some time His Majesty's Government were to consider the readjustment of the protectorate frontier. This question does not come within the scope ot the present discussion. 8. It is clear that His Majesty's Government cannot demand a special position in the Arabian peninsula, exclusive of the Hedjaz and Aden, without undertaking corresponding obligations. Article 4 of the draft treaty lays down that Great Britain will undertake to use her influence to secure for the commerce and navigation of all high contracting parlies, while engaging in lawful enterprise, treatment as favourable as that she may be a hie to secure for her own. Article 5 refers to the predominant interests of Great Britain in the maintenance of the peace and prosperity of the Arabian peninsula, and provides that the high contracting parties should agree to respect any treaties on the general lines of those already c mcluded between His Majesty's Government and the rulers of the said peninsula, other than the King of the Hedjaz. Article 6 describes the obligations to be incurred by His Majesty's Government in addition to those defined in article 4 as being :— (i.) Arbitration in all disputes. (ii. ) Protection from attacks by sea. (iii.) Guarantee of independence without interference in internal afiairs. In return for these benefits the chiefs are to engage to keep open the roads leading to the Holv Places, not to enter into treaties with other foreign Powers, and not to alienate territory or grant concessions without the consent of His Majesty's Government. 9. What do these obligations involve ? They cle .rly postulate a state of affairs under which the respective »ulers recognise the necessity of meeting the wishes of His Majesty's Government. This cannot be ensured by fear of aggressive action being taken against them. Even those whose territory borders on the sea are practically immune from attack other than the bombardment of undefended towns, and His Majesty's Government have no intention of conducting expensive expeditions into the interior of Arabia. It cannot be ensured by the threat of blockade, since this is a very difficult weapon to direct against one ruler to the exclusion of others. It has been found in practice during the war that there is invariablv some loophole by which supplies reach the blockaded ruler, even through the territories of rulers who are professedly friendly to His Majesty's Government. If the Imam were blockaded lie would obtain supplies through the A&lt;ir and Hadramaut. If Ibn Saud were blockaded he would receive them through Bahrein and Koweit, and so on. [4618] B 24 As no threat would in itself be sufficient to ensure a satisfactory attitude, s^me other means must be found of establishing the influence we desire the other Powers to recognise. In the case of all the rulers with whom we were in intimate relations before the war, with tlie exception of tlie Sheikh of Bahrein, the policy of the Government ot India has been to ensure a satisfactory attitude by offering financial support. During the war the same principle was extended to the rulers whose co-operation against the Turks was desirable in the interests of the Allies. It is the method that was invariably employed by the Turks themselves, and it is difficult to to see how any other method can be etfective. 10. In the CMse of those rulers whose territories are open to attack by sea it may perhaps be argued that no additional benefit beyond protection from such attack should be looked tor from His Majesty's Government, and ttiat the question ot financial assistance does not therefore arise. The deduction would be that Ibn Rashid is the v onlv ruler to whom it might be necessary to provide financial support to ensure his carrying out his side of the bargain, sinew he is the only ruler whose territory does not at any point touch the sea. There are, however, two reasons why this arbitrary distinction would be difficult to carry out in practice. The first is that, as will be seen from paragraph 11, three of the nine rulers whose territory touches the sea are already in receipt ot financial support from His Majesty s Government—namely, the Sultan of Muscat, the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla and the Sheikh of Koweit. Any proposal to stop subsidies to rulers whose territories touch the sea would involve the cessation of pecuniary assistance to these three rulers and, in the case of the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, the abrogation of his treaty rights in so far as they provide for a subsidy. The second objection to the line of argument, which would result in the entire cessation of subsidies to rulers whose territorit s touch the sea, is the fact that a subsidy, however small, is regarded as a mark of special favour, and any discrimination between one ruler and another, however logically it might be s pported, would inevitably cause jealousy and friction. The same argument applies with even greater force to any other attempt to discriminate between one grout) of rulers :ind another, unless His Majesty's Government adopt the definite policy of supporting one ruler and making all the others subordinate to him. This would involve the reco'nsideration of the division of the peninsula into its ten natural areas, and would in any case be exceedingly difficult to carry out in view of the traditional reluctance of anv Arab ruler to acknowledge the suzerainty of another. It would aho involve an alteration of the terms of the draft treatv by which His Majesty's Government are to ''guarantee the independence of the rulers of Arabia.' It is submitted that the only practical method of securing the influence which His Majesty's Government hope to deny to other Powers is by extending the principle ot financial support to all the independent rulers of Arabia. 11. Before discussing how this can best be done, it may be useful to summarise the present position :— (I.) Muscat.—The Sultan of Muscat was granted in 1861 an allowance of 86,400 rupees per annum from Indian revenues, and in 19 11 he was granted a further subsidy of 100,000 rupees per annum in connection with the agreement tor the regula tion of the arms traffic. (2.) Hadramaut.—The Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla is at present in receipt of a stipend of 60 rupees per mensem in accordance with the terms ot the treaty of 188'J. In 1917 he was given a loan of 400,000 rupees, which he is gradually repaying, instal ments of 15,000 having been credited in November 1919 and in March 1920. V (3.) Truclal Coast. —No subsidies ure at present being pa d. (4.) —No subsidy. (5.) Yemen. —The /maw Yahya is at present hostile to His Majesty s Governntent. In the spring of this year he invaded the Aden protectorate and established his officials among the more northerly tribes. Attempts were made to open negotiations with him, but had to be abandoned, partly owing to the capture by local tribes of the mission sent to Sanaa, and partly owing to the fact that the Imam declined to recognise His Majest3''s Government as having any special ri^ht to regulate the affairs of the \ emen. One result of the negotiation of the present treaty with the principal Allied Powers will be to determine the position of His Majesty's Government vis-a ins the Imam, and it is hoped that a treaty may be negotiated with him in tne near future. It has been represented by His Majesty s High Commissioner at Cairo that it would probably be5 cheaper in the end to ensure his non-interference in the Aden protectorate by paying him some small sum as a token of favour than by attempting to keep him out of the protectorate by force. , ^ (6.) Asir.—The Idrisi Said has been loyal to His Majesty s Government throughout the war, and was in receipt of a subsidy up to June 1919. lie not on good terms with either of his two neighbours, King Hussein or the Imam. He has, however, consistently professed himself rendy to accept the arbitration of His Majesty s Government in outstanding questions. This arbitration would be difficult, if not impossible, to carrv out if any discrimination were made between him and the Imam on the question of financial assistance. He has represented many times that, while he has remained loval to us, he obtains no benefit from his loyalty, and the fact that King Hussein and Ibn Saud have both received subsidies long after his own subsidy was stopped has probably been at the back of his mii d in making these representations. (7.) Anazeh—Fahad Beg, the ruler of the section of the Anazeh whose country borders on Mesopotamia, receives a subsidy of 17,000 rupees a month from Mesonotamian revenues. This is understood to be in connection with his a-si.stance to us in blockade work, but no proposal has yet been made for the reduction or cessation of tho allowance. - . ,,. (8.) Koueit. — The Sheihh of Koweit has a stretch of foreshore leas« d by His Majesty's Government, and is exempted from payment of taxes on his date gardens in Basra to the extent of 60,000 rupees a year. The Civil Con missioner at Bagdad has recommended that the lease should be terminated, and that a similar amount should be paid to him quarterly in arrears, admittedly as a subsidy, and subject to his good behaviour. _ t 1 . l 1 i i (9.) Hail.— lhn Rashid is at present in receipt of no subsidy, but the Givil Commissioner, Bagdad, has recommended a subsidy of 37,500 rupees a month. (lo.) Nejd.—Ibn Sand is at present in receipt of a subsidy of 5,0001. a, month. He also received recently an additional present of 5,000/. as a mark of appreciation from His Majesty's Government for having restrained his followers from making the pilgrimage. ^ It wid be seen from correspondence marked (C) that the High Commissioner at Bagdad now suggests that his subsidy should be increased to 100,000/. a vear, paid quarterly. An interesting report on the political situation in Nejd has been recently leceived in the India Office, from which it appears that Ibn bauds position is by no means so strong as has sometimes been imagined, and that there would be decided opposition on the part of the other rulers to any policy of aggrandising him at the expense of his neighbours. 12. If it is accepted that there is no objection to His Majesty's Government concluding a tre.itv with the independent King of the Hedjaz, and that the only way for them^to establish their influence with the remaining rulers of Arabia is to afford them a minimum of financial support, the deduction appears to be that His Majesty's Government should take the following line :— (1.) As soon as the Turkish treaty is ratified, and independently of the draft treaty dealing with Arabia (Appendix (A)), they should conclude a treaty with the King of the Hedjaz, in which it would be provided : — (a.) That, in return for certain definite undertakings to be made by King Hussein, His Majesty's Government would arrange for and guarantee a loan secured on the customs revenues and mineral resources of the country. (h.) That, so far as his foreign relations with other Arab rulers were concerned, he would undertake to accept the arbitration of His Majesty's Government in every ease. The negotiations could most conveniently be conducted through the Emir teisal. (2.) As soon as the draft treaty (Appendix (A) ) is signed the other independent mlers of Arabia should be informed that this lias been done, and invited to enter into, modify or ratify the existing treaty relations between them and His Majesty s Government. 13. The actual form which the financial assistance to the other Arab rulers should take cannot be discussed until the broad principle that they should be so assisted is accepted. It is, however, suggested that, in the case of rulers whose territories contain resources which would secure a loan, the support should take the form of a loan, possibly guaranteed by His Majesty's Treasury, and, in the case of such rulers as Ibn Kashid, whose territory is entirely unproductive, it should take the form of a small6 personal allowance paid in arrearp and ^iven in return for certain definite undertakings, such as to keep open the pilgrimage routes, to preserve the integrity of the boundaries decided on by British arbitration, to refrain from hostile action against his neighbours and to exclude foreign influence. Unless we are prepared to go as far as this, it is useless for us to demand recognition of our position in Arabia; and until the general principle is accepted it is impossible to formulate a detailed policy to meet individual cases. H. W. Y. Appendix (A). PROPOSALS OF BRITISH DELEGATION FOR DRAFT TREATY DEALING WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. Preamble. Article 1. 1 HE High Contracting Prirties recognise the independence from external domination of the Peninsula of Arabia, as defined in article 2, and declare that they seek no territorial aggrandisement for themselves in the said peninsula. Article 2. For the purpose of this treaty the Arabian Peninsula includes (1) all territories other than those of the Kingdom of the Hedjaz and the British Protectorate over Aden and its surrounding territorial zone; and (2) the islands, whether previously Turkish or not, which lie within the line wiiich is defined hereafter. This line extends from— % (a.) I he boundary line between Arabia and Egypt at the head of the Gulf of Akaba, approximate latitude 29° 27' north, longitude 34° 56' east (British Admiralty Chart No. 8 a ), to (6.) The western extremity of the reef extending westwards from the island of Ti ran ; then to (c.) The south-west rocks off Great Hanish Islands, approximate latitude 13° 3ii' north, longitude 42° 35' east (British Admiralty Chart No. 2523), thence through the extreme south-west point of Sheikh Malu off Cape Bab-el-Mandeb, to (d.) The 100-fathom contour line in the Gulf of Aden in approximate latitude 12° 29' north, longitude 43° 3G' east (British Admiralty Chart No. 2523); thence along the 100-fathom contour line, as indicated on the British Admiralty Chart No. 1012, round the south-east coast of Arabia, to (e.) Latitude 2J 0 30' north, longitude 59° 55' east (British Admiralty Chart No. 1012), oil Rass-el-IIad ; thence to (/.) Latitude 26^ 31' north, longitude 56° 33' east, in the entrance to the Persian Gulf ( British Admiralty Chart No. 2873 a ) ; then through the northernmost points of the isLmds of Tanb, Nabiyu Tanb, Sirri and Halul, to {g.) The point where the eastern extremity of the southern border of Iraq meets the Persian border as fixed by the Treaty of Erzeroum. The islands in the Red Sea lying within this line shall be placed under the sovereignty of the independent chiefs of the mainland, subject, however, to the provisions of article 8. Article 3. In view of the proximity of the Arabian Peninsula to portions of the British Empire and to the maritime oo nmunications with India, the other High Contracting Parlies recognise that Great Britain has special political interests in the said peninsula exclusive of the Kingdom of the Hedjaz, and declare that they seek no political influence in those territories.7 Article 4. Great Britain, on her side, undertakes to use her influence to secure for the commerce and navigation of all the High Contracting Parties, while engaged in lawful enterprises, treatment as favourable as that which she may be able to secure tor her own. Article 5. In view of the predominant interests of Great Britain in the maintenance of peace and prosperity of the Arabian Peninsula, the High Contracting Parties agree to respect any treaties on the general lines of those already concluded between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the rulers of the said peninsula, other than the King ot the Hedjaz. Article 6. These various treaties contain, generally, dispositions that His Britannic Majesty's Government should arbitrate in all disputes between the said cMefs, should protect them from attack by sea, and should guarantee their independence without interference in their internal atfairs ; while the chiefs engage to keep open the roads leading to the Hoi} 7 Places, and not to enter into treaty with foreign Powers, or to alienate territory or grant concessions without the consent of His Majesty's Government. Article 7. For the purpose of suppressing all commerce tendins: to promote or aggravate unrest in the peninsula, such as the trade in arms, the sale of slaves, &amp;c., the British naval forces shall be at liberty to co-operate with the Arab chiefs concerned in enforcing such prohibitions, and, in particular, the provisions of the convention for the control of the arms traffic in their territorial waters. Article 8. The administration of Cameran shall be entrusted to His Britannic Majesty's Government in or 'er that the quarantinn station may be maintained there, and that of the islands of Jebel Teir. Centre Peak Island of the Zebayir group and Abu Ail, shall be equally entrusted t«&gt; Great Britain for the maintenance of the lights therein. Great Britain shall also be entrusted with the maintenance of the lighthouses at Mocha. Article 9. His Britannic Majesty's Government will make it its especial care to see that the chiefs with whom it is in treaty relations afford every facility compatible with the requirements of public health to the pilgrim traffic. Appendix (B). [131109/M.E./44: a] Sir, Foreign Office&gt; September 29, 1919. I am directed by Rarl Curzon of Kedleston to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. P. 5656 of the 18th September, enclosing copies of teiegrams ot the llth and 14th September from the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, on the subject of Ibn Rash id. Lord Curzon presumes that Mr. Secretary Montagu will issue instructions to the Civil Commissioners as to the line which he should adopt at his forthcoming meeting with Ibn Rashid, and his Lordship would be glad of an opportunity ot expressing his opinion on the proposed instructions before they are actually despatched. In this connection his Lordship invites Mr. Montagu's attention to this Depart ment telegram No. 642 dated the 24th May to His Majesty's High Commissioner at Cairo on the subject of the proposed negotiations with the Imam ot Sanaa, of which a copy was transmitted to you with this Department letter No. 75632/M.E./44 of the 26th May last, and a further copy is now enclosed for convenience of reference. His Lordship ventures to suggest that the general line ot policy laid down in this telegram might usefully be followed in any discussion w T ith Ibn Rashid. The list of8 autonomous rulers there given as those whom His Majesty's Government are prepared to recognise applies only to those likely to be atFected by any arrangement with the Imam, and was not intended to cover the whole Peninsula or to exclude the recognition of the autonomy of Ihn Rashid. The Civil Commissioner will no doubt be in a position to recommend which rulers should be referred to in any conversations with Ibn Rashid, and 1 am to suggest, for Mr. Montagu's consideration, that his views should be invited in advance, in order that a decision may be reached as to the line which he should follow in his conversations. Lord Curzon considers that the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, should also be instructed to warn Ibn Rashid against the aggression on Ibn Saud, and that a failure to accept this warning will be detrimental to his hope of establishing permanent relations with His Majesty's Government. I am, &amp;c. The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. [7563k5 M.E./44] Cypher Telegram to General Allenhy {CairoX (No. r&gt;42.) Foreign Office, May 24, 1919, 5 p.m. Your telegram No. 709 of 4th May : Treaty with Imam. Peace delegation are of opinion that there might be some advantage in expediting conclusion of treaty with Imam as, if and when the question of Arabia comes to be discussed by Peace Conference, His Majesty's Government might be in a stronger position if thev were able to explain that a treaty was already in existence. They are content, however, to leave the date of Colonel Jacob's visit to you and myself. I doubt the possibilitv of excluding the question of boundaries from the proposed treaty, and 1 consider that its tinal conclusion will have to be postponed till after the peace settlement. Nevertheless, I think it would be well to open negotiations forth with, both to strengthen our case at Paris and to reassure the Imam. You should a'-cordintrly despatch Colonel J acob without, delay to open preliminary discussions. He shoul.T explain to the Imam that His Majesty's Government have no intention of interfering in internal atiairs, but are anxious to see the principles of cohesion and co -op&lt;*ration supersede separation and discord in Arabia. They realise that this policy can only be successful with the goodwill of the autonomous rulers of Arabia, through whom alone thev propose to deal. Excluding the Aden protectorate, the autonomous rulers concerned are King Hussein, the Imam himself, Ibu Saud, the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, and the Idrisi, who, by his assistance to the Allied cause during the war, has earned for himself a position which his Majesty's Government propose to recognise. With a view to establishing permanent friendly relations between these rulers, His Majesty's Government have decided to invite them to conclude simultaneous treaties by which each of them will recognise the independence of the others, and undertake to submit all boundary questions and other causes of dispute to British arbitration in the lirst place. His Majesty's Government will always he ready to use their influence in return to respect and preserve their rights and liberties and to prevent internal dissensions from resulting in hostilities. They will also gladly provide such advice and guidance in questions affecting commercial development as may be invited by the rulers concerned. , Colonel Jacob should also sound the Imam on the question ot the relations between King Hussein and the other overlords, making it clear that His Majesty's Government wilMn no cas^ support any claim of one autonomous ruler to interfere with another except with the concurrence and at the desire of both parties. Nothing should be said at present on the question of relations with other Powers. If the point is raised, Colonel Jacob should take the line that in the best interests of the Arabs themselves it is clearly desirable that they should all accept the same referee, and that so far as he is aware there is no question of any other Power laying claim to the traditional position of His Majesty's Government as the friend and protector of Arabia. When satisfactory relations have been established on the above lines, he may proceed to a guarded discussion of the Imam's boundaries, professing his readiness to do all he can to support his claims, but pleading lack of authority to make any definite pronouncement.9 [P 6027] Sir, India Office, October 14, 1919. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to reply to your letter No. 1o 1109/ ME /44 a , dated the 29th September, relative to instructions to be given to the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, regarding his forthcoming meeting with Iba Rashid. I am to enclose copy of a draft telegram which, subject to the concurrence of' Lord Curzon, Mr. Secretary Montagu proposes to send to Colonel Wilson. As Colonel Wilson has intimated that he will meet Ibn Rashid in the autumn, I am to request the favour of an early reply. I am, The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office. Copy of Enclosed Draft Telegram. To Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, Your telegram No. 8965 of 7th August, proposed meeting with Ibn Rashid* Please see your telegram No. 11163 of 21st September, and Foreign Office telegram No. 642 of 24lh May, sent by mail of 29th May. Firstly, at meeting with Ibn Rashid you should advise him that failure to comply with your warning against aggression on Ibn Saud will be detrimental to his hope of permanent relations with His Majesty's Government. Secondly, your discussion should follow general policy of Foreign Office telegram under reference, but list of autonomous rulers therein was confined to those likely to be affected by agreement with Imam, and was not intended to exclude Ibn Rashid or others deserving recognition. It will doubtless be necessary to mention others in your conversations with Ibn Rashid Please telegraph for prior approval of His Majesty's Government names of those whom you would add to list tor this purpose.

T am directed by Earl Curzon of Kedleston to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. P. 8354 of the 15th January on the subject of the proposed list of the autonomous rulers of Arabia.

Ibn Sand. Muscat. Ibn Rash id. Bahrein. The only important element which is not included in this list is the tribe of the Anazeh, and Lord Curzon suggests that, in the event of any of the other autonomous rulers enquiring as to the policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the Anazeh, the reply should be that the matter is under consideration, but that, in default of such enquiry, the tribe should not be mentioned, and he would be glad to know whether Mr. Montagu concurs in this view.

Present: Sir John Tilley, K.C.M.G., C.B., Foreign Office (in the Chair). Mr. H. Montgomery, C.B., C.V.O. ... Foreign Office. Major Young, D .S .O. Mr. C. C. Garbett, C.I.E. Mr. F. Phillips Mr. J. C. Carr Foreign Office. India Office. Treasury. Treasury. Mr. C. M. Pntrick, Foreign Office (Secretary). Subsidy to Ibn Saud. Mr. Garhett, referring to the proposal to debit Ibn Saud's subsidy against Mesopotamian revenues, enquired whether the reference was to current revenues or to accrued surplus. Mr. Phillips stated that the Treasury's suggestion referred to the accrued surplus, and asked whether the India Office would object to the 265,000/. already paid to Ibn Saud being adjusted against that amount. Mr. Garhett agreed that under the accepted laws of war surplus re\enues of occupied enemy territory were at the disposal of the occupying Power. In this way the surplus Mesopotamian revenues were at the disposal of His Majesty's Government] and the India Office would probably agree to their being used to meet the amount of Ibn Saud's subsidy already paid. After some discussion, Mr. Phillips said there were no other funds at present available in the Treasury to meet this expenditure, and he agreed that the Treasury might also accept this suggestion, which, in fact, they were putting to the Foreign Office officially. Mr. Montgomery raised the question as to whether the 265,000/. was reckoned in sterling or rupees. Mr. Gar'hett understood it was the former. Major Young asked whether, if the past subsidy was to be met from the Mesopotamian surplus, the subsidy could not now continue to be paid till the signature of peace from current Mesopotamian revenues. Mr. Phillips asked whether it was a matter of urgent necessity to continue the subsidy at all. Mr. Garbett said that the India Office considered that there could not be a more inopportune moment for reconsidering these subsidies than the present. The India Office considered that Ibn Saud's subsidy should certainly be continued till his meeting with King Hussein had taken place. He thought it 'probable that the India Office would agree to Ibn Saud's subsidy being adjusted against the Mesopotamian accounts till the signature of peace. Mr. Phillips, while adhering to the view that Ibn Saud's subsidy should be met from Mesopotamian revenues, asked whether it could not, in fact, be assumed that there would in future be no real Mesopotamian surplus, and that His Majesty's Govern ment would, in practice, have to pay anyway if the subsidy were continued. [4618] ' D12 Mr. Garbett pointed out that in any case we could not engage in advance the future Mesopotamian Government. Sir John Tilley agreed that the most suitable occasion for reconsidering this subsidy would be the signature of peace with Turkey. The Meeting was of opinion that, subject to Imlia Office and Treasury concurrence, the 265,000^. already paid as subsidy to Ibn Saud should be met from the Mesopotamian surplus, and that Ibn Baud's subsidy should continue to be paid till the signature of peace from current Mesopotamian revenues. 4 Future Policy as to Subsidies. Major Young observed that His Majesty's Government were endeavouring to obtain a ' self-denying ordinance ' from other Powers as regards Arabia. They were asking for a special position in the Peninsula on account of its proximity to the Empire's vital maritime routes. The question was whether we could maintain that position without expenditure in the shape of subsidies. India and His Majesty's Government had felt up to now that their interests justified the payment of certain subsidies, and if, as a result of the Peace Treaty, His Majesty's Government were to be ^iven a special position in the Peninsula, the case for continuing them would, if anything, be strengthened. Sir John Tilley concurred. In reply to a question by Mr. Phillips, Major Young considered that the appoint ment of the British-Moslem representative at Mecca was an exactly parallel case and amounted to an acknowledgment by the Treasury of the principle of His Majesty's Government's interests in the pilgrimage question. (Mr. Phillips dissented.) The whole question of subsidies in the Peninsula was, moreover, inextricably involved as regards the various rulers. The relations of His Majesty's Government with Hussein, Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, for example, were mutually interdependent. Mr. Phillips suggested that in spite of this it might be possible and more satisfactory for His Majesty's Government to back one ruler only. Major Young agreed that this seemed more likely to be successful at first sight, but pointed out that the Eastern Committee had discussed the question on various occasions and had failed to arrive at a decision to concentrate on one subsidy. The Treasury had been represented at all these discussions. Mr. Garbett added that the question was not only one of maintaining our special position in Arabia but went a good deal further. We were the greatest Moslem Power in the world, and it was of the highest importance to the interests of the Empire as a whole that the pilgrim routes should be kept open. Failing this, unrest in all colonies containing Moslems would ensue. He considered that subsidies should take, in the future, the less offensive form of payments for services rendered, i.e., services in connection with keeping open the pilgrim routes. He suggested also that a ratio might be observed in fixing the amount of the various subsidies in thp same way as had been done by Colonel Wilson, who had suggested fixing Kashid's subsidy at half Ibn Saud's. Mr. Phillips enquired how many British subjects actually used the pilgrim routes, and suggested that if we kept one route open—by sea—we were really meeting our responsibilities in the matter. Major Young pointed out that it was not so much a question of the routes as of the actual security of the holy places themselves—Mecca and Medina. Mr. Phillips asked what the probable result would be if all the subsidies were withdrawn ? Mr. Garhett considered that this would in all probability lead to the closing of the pilgrim routes and thus to general unrest, not only in Arabia but in India and in our other Moslem dependencies, as well as in those of other Powers. Major Young observed that a revival of Turcophil propaganda might also ensue. Moreover, in the event of a Wahabi invasion of the Hedjaz, causing dissatisfactionin Algeria, for example, we should have much difficulty in justifying our special position in Arabia to the French. A discussion on the subsidies to Ibn Saud and Hussein followed. Mr. Garhett pointed out that Ibn Saud might be unwilling to receive subsidies from Abdulla in the event of the latter becoming ruler of Mesopotamia. Such a subsidy would, in fact, amount to blackmail on Ibn Saud's part. He agreed, however, that in any case it would be better if this subsidy took the form of a payment for services rendered in keeping open the pilgrim routes. His demands would probably increase as time went on. Mr. Phillips enquired whether we should be responsible for the defence of Abdulla or of whoever was placed in Mesopotamia under the Peace Treaty. Major Young thought that this would probably be the case. Mr. Carr asked whether Ibn Saud did not in actual fact use his subsidy for warlike preparations against the Hedjaz. If this was the case, did it really tend to peace to continue to pay it ? Major Young suggested, in this connection, that Ibn Saud might be aiven to understand that his subsidy was conditional on his not attacking the Hedjaz. He observed that, under the Treaty, the Hedjaz would be independent, and that it would be very difficult for any one Power to pay a direct subsidy to Hussein, Some form of subsidy might possibly be paid by us in conjunction with other Powers interested in the pilgrimage. This would perhaps ultimately take the form of a loan. It would, in his opinion, be preferable for Arab rulers to receive assistance by being encouraged to invest their money in British concerns rather than by being subsidised, but they had little money available for this purpose. King Hussein could, however, in all probability, raise money on his oil-bearing and mineral areas if he was guaranteed from aggression by the people of Nejd. Sir John Tilley observed that Hussein's subsidy would thus actually take the form of a subsidy to Ibn Saud to induce the latter not to attack the Hedjaz. Mr. Phillips pointed out that Hussein might not appreciate this point of view, and in any case it appeared that we had continued to pay Ibn S.iud when he did attack the Hedjaz. He doubted the deterrent effect of such a subsidy on Ibn Saud. Mr. Garhett stated that the India Office did not contemplate stopping Ibn Saud's subsidy for the present. Recent reports indicated that Ibn Saud must have money ; if not provided therewith there was a danger lest he might go and take it, which he was well able to do. In spite of his power in this respect, Ibn Saud was anxious to fall in with His Majesty's Government's wishes, and he regarded the subsidy as the outward sign of their favourable disposition towards him. Mr. Montgomenj said that the subsidy appeared to have been efficacious in preventing Ibn Saud from attacking the Hedjaz up till now. Mr. Garbett observed that it was agreed that it would be a very difficult matter to stop all these payments at once, and that it was admittedly to the interests of the Empire as a whole to keep the pilgrimage routes open. The only methods of doing this were by subsidy, a blockade or a military campaign. He thought the subsidy was probably the cheapest ot the three alternatives. Major Young agreed, and instanced the case of the Imam of Sanaa, who had now invade ( the Aden Protectorate. It might eventually prove cheaper to induce him to withdraw by payment of a subsidy than to evict him by military action. Mr. Phillips observed that the Treasury were not yet convinced of the necessity for the continuance of tiie subsidies. The question of subsidy to the chiefs of the Persian Gulf was briefly discussed. Mr. Garbett said that the India Office might possibly want the whole question of the Persian Gulf subsidies reconsidered, but that they did not at present contemplate the withdrawal of the subsidy from Muscat or Bahrein. The question of the with drawal of the lease of Bunder Shwaikh from the Sheikh of Koweit and of the [4618] D 2u substitution of a subsidy paid in arrear was under consideration. It might be paid either by Mesopotamia, or by India as heretofore. Mr. Phillips said that the most important question at the moment appeared to be the subsidy to Ibn Saud. In this matter the Treasury preferred to await definite nformation as to the continuance or otherwise of the subsidy to Hussein before coming to a decision. An official letter was, however, on its way from the Treasury to the India Office and the Foreign Office on the subject of the continuance of all these subsidies, and the Treasury would be glad to learn the views of the Foreign Office and India Office on this question, not only as regards the period up to the signature of peace, but also afterwards. Appendix (D.) [E 8300/9/44 J Foreign 0JJice Memorandum [circulated to Cabinet, July T.', 11)20). THESE papers relate to a matter in dispute between the Foreign Office and the Treasury, viz., the temporary continuance of the monthly subsidy at present being paid to the King of the Hejaz. The case of this and other similar subsidies to Arab Chiefs is raised in its larger as well as in its narrower aspect in the accompanying Despatch from Lord Allen by, and is explained in the Foreign Office Note. I must ask the Cabinet for an early decision. C. of K. Foreign Office, 1 July 13, 1920. Memorandum on the Subsidies to King Hussein and Ibn Saud. On the 5th May last Lord Allenby was consulted by the Secretary of State as to the desirability of continuing the payment of a subsidy to the King of the Hejaz. Lord Allenby gave it as his opinion that continuance was most important, and recommended that the amount should be 250,000 rupees per mensem. The Secretary of State concurred in this recommendation and approached the Treasury on the i5th May for sanction for payment at this rate to be continued until the independence of the Hejaz had been finally ratified by the Peace Treaty, or until some alternative scheme had been elaborated with the other Powers interested—whichever might be the earlier. The Treasury in their reply of the 18th June intimated that they were unable to sanction these payments until some general policy with regard to subsidies to Arab rulers could be laid down. On the 30th June the Foreign Office replied that, while fully appreciating the desire of the Treasury for a formulation of policy, it would be premature to attempt this at the present juncture. Sanction for this subsidy was again requested and it was intimated that, in the event of the Treasury being unable to concur, the question would be laid before the Cabinet. On the 7th July, the Treasury concurred in the latter course. The attached despatch from Lord Allenby deals with the whole question of ouir future Arabian policy, and draws attention to the indirect responsibilities which His Majesty's Government might be deemed to have incurred in that region. The consideration of the general questions of policy raised by Lord Allenby must await the result of the negotiations now being conducted in Paris on our ' special position ' in Arabia, as well as a decision on the question of the machinery to be set up in London to give effect to His Majesty's Government's policy in the Middle East. But in the meanwhile, the continuance of the Hejaz subsidy is a matter of urgency and the following statement of the facts is submitted to show how considerable are the Imperial interests involved. The Hejaz is an original member of the League of Nations and thus will be entirely independent under the Turkish Treaty. Its importance is due to the fact that the Moslem Holy Places—Mecca and Medina—lie within it. Each year these towns form the object of a pilgrimage from our Moslem dependencies, and from other Mahommedan countries outside the British Empire. Last year the number of pilgrims from within the Empire was approximately 100,000, the majority comingfrom India. The interruption of the pilgrimage would cause the most unfavourable reaction there, and in our other Moslem Dependencies, and incidentally a probable access of pro-Turkish and Pan-Islamic sentiment. iNejd lies to the East of, and marches with, the Hejaz. Ibn Saud, its ruler, is the most powertul chief of Arabia from the military point of view, and would probably not have great difficulty in over-running the Hejaz, if hostilities between tiie two countries were to break out. His followers are coming increasingly under the influence of the Wahabi movement, which may be described as a form of extreme Mosiem Puritanism. The tenets of Wahabism induce amongst its adherents a strong tendency towards fanaticism and intolerance, the latter not only directed against everything Christian and European, but also against the followers of other Moslem sects. A Wahabi occupation of the Holy Places would probably close them effectively to the Pilgrimage From India, Egypt, and the Straits Settlements. A strong rivalry exists between King Hussein and Ibn Saud. Among other points ol dilterence, there remain certain frontier disputes of long standing. No actual hostilities of any importance, however, have taken place since early in 1919. An identic communication was recently sent to the two chiefs, by the Foreign Office and India Office respectively, pressing them to agree to a personal meeting, in the hope that their differences could be thus adjusted. The identic communication pointed out that, in the event of either ruler refusing the invitation to meet his rival, he could not expect a continuance of financial assistance from His Majesty's Government. Both Hussein and Ibn Saud agreed to such a meeting, and it is hoped that they will come together at Mecca, during the present pilgrimage season, and that some modus vivendi will then be arrived at on the frontier and other questions at issue, and that the danger of a Wahabi occupation of the Holy Places will thus be averted. The subsidies to King Hussein and Ibn Saud were originally purely military measures adopted during the war. The payments to the former were made in connection with his successful revolt against the Turks, during which his troops fought with us in Palestine and Syria, and to the latter to assist him in military operations on our behalf during the Mesopotamian campaign. The subsidy to King Hussein has been continued since the Armistice on a reduced scale, in the interests of the pilgrimage. The Hejaz is an unfertile and rocky strip of land whose intrinsic trade and resources are negligible. Its inhabitants outside the towns consist mainly of desert tribes of Bedouin, who are largely beyond the control of the Hejaz Government. The various routes to the Holv Places, including the Hejaz railway itself, lie open to the attacks of these tribes, who, unless overawed or subsidised, are always ready to attack and plunder the caravans of the pilgrims and to cut the railway for the same purpose, and thus render the pilgrimage difficult or impossible. The policy of the Turks during their domination of the Hejaz, was a combination of armed force and subsidies. They maintained a con siderable garrison in the Hejaz to overawe the tribes, and supplemented this by the grant of various subsidies to them. In view of the impossibility of maintaining a garrison there, His Majesty's Government has hitherto paid a monthly grant to the Government of the Hejaz to enable King Hussein to exert some restraint over the Bedouin and keep the pilgrim routes clear. It is believed that the funds received from His Majesty's Government are largely spent in direct subsidies to the tribal sheikhs. In view of the Hejaz's membership in the League of Nations, there are obvious objections to the indefinite continuance of this subsidy. It may eventually be desirable to arrange some form of international loan, to which the various Powers interested in the pilgrimage might subscribe, or to resort to some similar measure. But any action in this sense would be premature, before the peace settlement is effected, and before the question of our special position in Arabia (excluding the Hejaz), which is now being negotiated in Paris, is disposed of. Apart from this aspect of the subsidy question, however. King Hussein has only with great reluctance agreed to meet Ibn Saud. His assent to the meeting is believed to be to some extent due to his apprehension that the subsidy would forth with cease in the event of a refusal on his part. If His Majesty's GoVernment were now abruptly to withdraw their financial support there would be considerable risk of the proposed meeting not taking place, and the chance being lost of a satisfactory settlement of the Hejaz-Nejd question. The continuance of this subsidy till the peace settlement is effected, at 250.000 rupees per mensem (the amount recommended by Lord Allenby) is thus clearly necessary if we are to prevent the outbreak of serious trouble in Arabia, which would react on Islam in general.The payment of a subsidy to the Emir at Nejd has also been continued since the Armistice largely in the interests of the pilgrimage. The Emir is described as being in a permanent state of financial difficulty. His military strength, however, is believed to be adequate to enable him to undertake a successful invasion of the Hejaz on the west or a raid on the south-west portion of Mesopotamia on the east. The opportunities for plunder offered by such expeditions would provide him with an easy and tempting means of replenishing his Treasury. An invasion of the Hejaz by the Wahabis in the early part of the last century resulted in a general massacre of the inhabitants, and such an invasion to-day would in all probability at least result in the closing of the pilgrimage. The dangers of a raid into Mesopo tamia are obvious. In the event of a preliminary success, Ibn Saud would probably be joined by the local tribes, who would be ready to seize such a favourable oppor tunity for plunder, and he might also meet with some support from the Extremist Party in Bagdad and elsewhere. At present, however, Ibn Saud's attitude to His Majesty's Government is perfectly friendly, and there is no reason to suppose that he now contemplates any aggression against Mesopotamia. It is hoped to avert the danger of an attack on the Hejaz by the proposed personal meeting between the two rulers. In the meanwhile Ibn Saud is receiving a subsidy of 75,000 rupees per month from Mesopotamian funds. In the event of a satisfactory agreement being reached at his meeting with King Hussein, the question of the reduction of this amount will be open to reconsideration, but till the meeting has taken place any reduction would seem inadvisable. Foreign Office, July 7, 1920. [E 6180/2854/44] Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Earl Curzon.—[Received June 10.) (No. 559.) My Lord, Cairo, May 28, 1920. I HAVE the honour to submit the following remarks on the question of the grant of subsidies to Arab rulers, with reference to your Lordship's despatch No. 532 of the 4th May, transmitting the minutes of a meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 17th April, in which I observe that the Treasury are not yet convinced of the necessity for the continuance of the subsidies. It appears to me that to arrive at a just decision on this subject it is necessary in the first place to compare the position of the different rulers now and before the war, to weigh the services of each during that period, to examine whether any responsi bility rests on His Majesty's Government for the changes which have occurred, and, finally, to consider whether, on grounds of morality or expediency, it is justifiable to impose on the British taxpayer the burden of providing some or all of them with monetary assistance in the future. The beginning of the war saw an effective, if not entirely efficient, Ottoman administration in the Hejaz and Yemen; Ibn Rashid a mediatised Turkish vassal; the Idrisi in revolt against the ruling power, but already discussing terms of peace; and Ibn Saud, who had not long before ejected the Turks from Hasa and Qatif, showing a disposition to resume his allegiance, provided that he was allowed a free hand as Vali of Nejd, and given an adequate stipend. It will be seen that the feeling of racial consciousness, which is now so marked, was already showing itself even in the more remote parts of the Peninsula, but a study of the records of the time will also show that the Ottoman Government, however unwillingly, was beginning to realise its incapacity to retain by force the Arab countries, and was preparing to grant a measure of self-government which might satisfy the aspirations of its inhabitants. The consideration of the subject was, however, abruptly broken off by the commencement of the war, and after the Ottoman Government had declared against the Allied Powers, Great Britain, taking advantage of the discontent which already existed, made promise to the Shereef of Mecca, Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, which induced them definitely to cast off their allegiance and throw in their lot with the Allies. I do not propose to examine and compare in detail the services performed by these three rulers, but I think it may fairly be said that each, according to his capacity, rendered real and effective assistance at a time when the result of the war still hung in the balance and, by so doing, brought to nought the plans for a Jehad, diverted or renderedinnocuous large Turkish forces, and greatly facilitated our task in keeping open to traffic the Ked Sea. It may be said with some show of justice that they have had their reward in gaining their independence and freeing themselves from the Turkish yoke, but the fact must not be lost sight of that, with the removal of the dominant influence, the Arabian Peninsula was left without administrative and financial means or experi ence for the preservation of order and for the substitution of effective local government in place of what had existed previously. This applies in particular to the Hejaz, and I cannot refrain from thinking that the promises made by His Majesty's Government impose a certain moral obligation to ensure that the future of these countries is at least as prosperous as their past. I do not, however, wish to press unduly this point, since sentimental considera tions must give way to those of economy at the present time, and I will pass on to the more practical aspects of the case. As your Lordship is aware, the Arab revolt was not regarded with sympathy either in India or in our other Mahommedan countries. This feeling itill exists to-day. The revolt can only be justified by its success, and we shall undoubtedly lay ourselves open to severe criticism if the Peninsula passes into a state of anarchy. Further than this, the Allied policy with regard to Syria and Palestine is not in accord with the wishes of the local populations, and has already exposed His Majesty s Government to a charge of breach of promise and opened the field to Turkish and Bolshevik propaganda from the north. The situation in the Middle East to-day gives rise to grave misgivings, and seems unlikely to improve in the near future. On this account I consider it is of great importance that, if we gain a special position in the Arabian Peninsula, His Majesty's Government should so employ it as to earn the gratitude of the people and silence the criticism of those detractors, who accuse us of cynicism and self-interest in our treatment of the Arabs. At the present moment we are in a favourable position to achieve this, since the factors which have rendered so restless the Arabs in Syria and Mesopotamia have not operated with any great force in the Peninsula itself, and its rulers, with the excep- tron of the Imam Yahya and the new Emir of Hail, who has in point of fact come under the influence of Ibn Saud, have given satisfactory proofs that they are prepared to look to us for help and guidance and protection. The questions then arise whether we can gain our object without payment, and, if not, whether the results achieved will justify the expenditure. As regards the former point I consider that the experience of the last four years shows the answer to be emphatically in the negative. I do not advocate any undue interference in the internal and local affairs of the Peninsula, but I presume that we shall attempt to adjust the relations between the different rulers and claim to influence all foreign relations, and it is only reasonable to suppose that the rulers will require some quid fro quo. Furthermore, moral influence has its effect in the East, but it will not always prove such a strong deterrent as the threat to cut off supplies, more especially in countries which are far removed from civilisation and where it is impossible to achieve a purpose by armed force. I do not think it is too much to say that if we attempt to gain a predominant influence in Arabia without being prepared to pay for it our efforts will result in failure. As regards the advantages to be gained, I place, first and foremost, the chance of recovering and maintaining our prestige in the Middle East. We have destroyed the Power which, however badly, ruled Arabia. We must put something in its place, and, in so doing, endeavour to re-establish our good name for disinterestedness and sympathy with Moslem races. We are, and shall continue to be, hampered in Syria and Palestine. It is, therefore, the more necessary to seize our opportunity in the Peninsula where the conditions are favourable and where we shall not be exposed to foreign rivalry once our special position is recognised. Secondly, there is considerable evrdenqe to show that a determined effort is being made to unite Islam against all European' Powers. A friendly Arabia will be an important check to this. Thirdly, it is necessary to have a friendly population in the countries bordering our vital sea routes. Equal to these in importance is the necessity ot keeping open the pilgrimage routes to the Holy Places and of ensuring that the pilgrimage itself is undertaken. We are under judgment of the Moslems in all parts of the world in this matter, and failure will do us incalculable harm.18 Fifthly, I would place the advantages to British trade which the opening up of the interior of the Peninsula will afford, and sixthly, the desirability of preventing other Powers from gaining a predominant position, more especially in South-west Arabia. I trust that the above considerations will be sufficient to show that the advantages to be won are not small, and that, in the event of His Majesty's Government being granted a special position there, the necessity of affording monetary assistance, until such time as the different countries can make their own way, will be recognised. I understand that it may be difficult for His Majesty's Government to provide all the money, and that joint subsidies or loans may be necessary. This would be unfortunate from a British point of view, but it would not alter the principle which I am endeavouring to lay down. It would merely mean that the responsibility, and therefore the credit, to be gained would be collective. I am unaware of the reasons which call for a joint loan, and should have thought that the subsidies granted to the rulers of Bahrein, Musqat, and Koweit by the Government of India before the war would have furnished a useful precedent in claiming the sole right to give monetary assistance now. I do not advocate the permanent continuance of subsidies on the present scale, and I would gradually replace them with stipends and loans. All the rulers, with perhaps the exception of Ibn Rashid, possess sea ports or tracts of land or other resources which are capable of development, and I consider that loans should be granted where there seems a good prospect of a productive return and where security can be offered. Stipends should, I think, be granted to King Husein, Ibn Sand and the Idrisi. The case of Ibn Rashid is of relative unimportance, while that of the Imam Fuhya is still so obscure that it is idle to consider it now. Eventually we shall probably find it cheaper to pay than to fight. I also consider that certain conditions should be attached, such as the main tenance of internal peace, acceptance of our control of foreign relations, and the keeping open of the trade and pilgrimage routes. These would doubtless be embodied in the form of a treaty with each ruler. With regard to Mr. Phillip's suggestion that it might be more satisfactory to ' back one ruler only,' I would observe that it has already become evident that the ideal of subsidising the various chiefs through one overlord is an impossible one. There is no ruler who would be accepted by the remainder as paramount, and there is none who could be trusted to make the right distribution of the funds. King Husein, whom, no doubt, Mr. Phillips had in mind, has indeed proved the least likely to be accepted as suzerain and to endeavour to bolster him up as Grand King of Arabia, by paying other subsidies through him, would be a politically unsound, if not an actually dangerous, policy to adopt. The question as to the amounts of the stipends and loans is one which requires further consideration, and in this despatch I have not attempted to do more than lay before your Lordship the broad considerations which, in my opinion, justify the adoption of the principle that their payment in the future is an investment which is necessary, and which will bring in its due return. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Resident, Aden, the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, and to the Foreign Department, Delhi. I have, &amp;c. 1 ALLENBY, F.M.

The memorandum is signed 'H. W. Y.' [Major Hubert Winthrop Young].Arabia is defined in the memorandum as the area bounded on the north-west by the peninsula of Sinai and the British mandate of Palestine and Trans-Jordan; on the north-east by the British mandate of Mesopotamia; on the east by the Persian Gulf; on the south-east by the Indian Ocean; and the west by the Red Sea.The memorandum includes draft treaty proposals of the British delegation to Paris (Appendix A, folios 4-5), and the main body of the document discusses the articles of the proposed treaty in relation to the various constituent parts of the Arabian peninsula, as defined by the British, including the Kingdom of the Hedjaz [Hejaz, al-Ḥijāz], Nejd [Najd], Yemen, and the Gulf littoral states. The memorandum asserts the right of the British Government to recognition of their special position in Arabia in view of Britain's longstanding relations with many of the region's rulers (folio 1). There are three further appendices: Appendix B (folios 5-6) contains transcriptions of relevant correspondence issued by the Foreign Office and the India Office, dated 1919-20, relating to the sub-divisions into which Arabia had been divided for the purposes of the document; Appendix C (folios 7-8) contains minutes of a meeting held at the Foreign Office on 17 April [1920] to discuss the question of subsidies to Arab rulers; and Appendix D (folios 8-10) contains a Foreign Office memorandum dated 13 July 1920 concerning the question of the continuance of financial support by the British Government to King Hussein [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī] of the Hejaz.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Hubert Winthrop Young</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>ʻAsīr </geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000369#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
