My dear Belgrave, I hear a rumour that an 'Arab” is arranging to establish a cinema nere; and one ol the drillers’ wives was overheard to talk of Saturday night cinema parties from the JabalJ 'A. There is, 1 think, a file on the subject, but i have not waiteu to get the papers out, as it is well for you to know at once (if you do not already). 3. If the rumour is true, I think that the question of prohibiting the establishment of a cinema should be carefully considered, and in any case that censorship should be provided for. I cannot but think that his Excellency Shaikh Hamad would regard with distaste the type of film wmch experience elsewhere tells me is likely to be shown. Yours sincerely, Dalrymple Belgrave Esquire, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. J■ — $%» . V 4k GOVERNMENT OF BAHRA^^ C^^ A QE^^ Your letter No. c/372 of 7th April. Ali Yatim, a local Arab who died seven years ago was given permission to put up a cinema and a two years monopoly, about eight years ago. He did not carry out his inten tion and the monopoly expired. Since then his son Hussein and also a certain Jew have approached the government on the subject but no permission has been given. I have heard vaguely, that the Bahrain Petroleum Company considered opening a cinema at their camp for their own employees. In any case permission would have to be obtained from this government for opening a cinema and if the question of granting it was considered the censorship would have to be so strict that I doubt if enough suitable films could be obtained to make the show worth running.

We are the proprietors of ••Koh-i-Nur' Cinema wh ich was transferred to Muhammrah after one and a half years show in Ahwaz six months ago. Thus our experience in this line is large and varied and our business at either places has been pretty successful. 3&lt; The existing trade restrictions in Iran are, however, disappointing,especially on account of the attitude of the Persian Government towards the foreign merchants { it will not be out of place to mention here fV r your information that we hardly feel safe to invest large sums of money in Bussiness in Iran nowadays. 4&gt; T he need of a Cinema appears to be a long felt want in the most progressive and much more mo .cm Islands of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf chiefly on account of the influx of large number of foreigners who are Migrating into Uanamah day in and aay out. 5 . In conclusion We beg to request that should it be possible for the permission sought for to be granteu w0 us, we may also be permitted to let us have our own electric engine installed here for the purpcs es of Cinema. 6 we quote Messrs.

Our Solicitors, Messrs. Herbert Oppenheimer, Nathan, Vandyk and Mackay, have suggested that before we do any business there, we should consult with your office. We have already granted a licence for the exhibition of these pictures for Iraq and Iran, but no mention is made in the contracts of either Bahrein or koweit.

The Shaikh would certainly agree to a Board of Censors being established which not be used continuously but would be in existence for use in case a really undesirable film was aho^n. Trie Board could recoumnc punishment of the cinema management in the form of suspension of license or fine if at any time necessary. I have seen cinemas in other parts of Arabia and have never known them to . cause trouble or there to be a complaint against them from a moral or religious point of View and do not think that we can live out of the world for ever here, X have not expressed my views to the Shaikh because I believe they are not in accordance with tnose held by the permanent incumbent and I have therefore referred the matter to you. ^ Captain, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain*D. 0, Ko tlM, 19/333 Bated the 1936 Bear Garoe, 4&gt;H There ie at) Idea of starting a oinema In Bahrain.

Y/ith reference to your demi-official letter Political Resident in the Persian GulfAPPENDIX G. Suggestions to Inspectors of Films* Bombay Board of Film Censors. General Principles. 1. No generally and rigidly applicable rules of censorship can be laid down. 2. It is essential to be consistent hit impossible to aim at strictly logical decisions. 3. Each film must be judged on its own merits. 4. Nothing should be approved which in the Inspectors honest opinion is calculated to demoralise an audience or any section of it. 5. Ihe following kinds of films are liable to objefltion&gt;-those which: (a) Extenuate crimei or which familiarise young people wdth crime so as to make them conclude that theft, robbery and crimes of violence are normal incidents of ordinary life and not greatly * to be reprobated! or which exhibit the actual methods by which thieves carry out their purposes and make the methods of crii.e the chief theraei or in which crime is the dominant feature of a serial and not merely an episode in the story. (b) Undermine the teachings of morality, by showing vice in an attractive form even though retribution follows or casting a halo or glory or success round heads of the viciousi or suggest ing that a person is morally justified in succumbing to tempta tion in order to escape from bad circumstances or ungen^ial work! or bringing into contempt the institution of marriages or suggest ing abnormal sexual relations* or lowering the sacredness of the family ties. (o) Exhibit indecorous dress or absolute nudity of the living (except infants; and small children); or nude statues or figures in suggestive positions. (d) Bring into contempt public character acting as such, e.g., soldiers wearing H.M. uniform, Ministers of religion, Minister of the Crown, Ambassadors and official representatives— of foreign nations, judges, the police, civil servants of Govern ment , etc, (e) Are calculated to wound the susceptibilities of foreign nations or of members of any religion. (f) Are calculated or possibly intended to foment social unrest and discontenti (i.e., not scenes merely depicting realistically the hard conditions funder which people live, depicting the violence that results in an actual conflict between capital and Labour.) (g) Are calculated to promote disaffection or resistance to ©overnment or to promote a breach of law and order. 6. Inspectors should consider the impression likely to be made on an average audience in India, which includes a not inconsidereble proportion of illiterate people or those of « immature judgment. 7. Inspectors should remember that a film may be in itself innocent yet dangerous because of the bad reputation of the book it reproduces, and that a book may be harmless but a film of it dangerous, 8. Inspectors should distinguish between errors of conduct caused by love, even guilty love, and those that result from the pursuit of lust. 9. Objections to films may be removed y the Board either (1) by modification or removal of titles and sub-titles or of the film narrative or description, or (2) by cutting out portions of fiflims, or (3) by both. 10. Two Inspectors or the Secretary and one inspector should be present at the inspection of a film. The fallowing is a list of film subjects that are likely to be objeotionablei- (1) Indecorous, ambiguous and irreverent titles and sub-tit! a (2) Cruelty to animals. (3) The irreverent treatment of sacred subjects. (4) Drunken scenes carried to excess. (5)(5) VUlgar accessories in the staging. (6 ) The modus operand! of criminals. (7 ) Cruelty &amp; young infants and excessive cruelty and tortures to adults, especially women. (8) Unnecessary exhibition of feminine underclothing. (9) The exhibition of profuse bleeding. (10) Nude Figures. (11) Offensive vulgarity, and iraprop/friety in conduct and dress. 12) Indecorous dancing. (13) Excessively passionate love scenes. (14) Bathing scenes passing the limits of propriety. (15) References to controversial politics. (16) Relations of Capital and Labour. (17) Seenes tending to disparage public characters and institutions. (18) Realistic horrors of warfare. (19) Scenes and incidents calculated in time of war to afford information to the enemy. (20) Incidents having a tendency to disparage other nations* (21) Scenes holding up the King^ uniform to contempt or ridicule. 22) Subjects dealing with India, in vhich British or Indian officers are seen in an odious li$it, and otherwise attempting to suggest the disloyalty of Native States or bringing into disrepute British prestige in the Entire. (23) The exploitation of tragic incidents of the war. (24) Gruesome murders and strangulation scenes. (25) Executions. (26) The drug habit,e.g.» opium. Morphia, cocaine, etc. (27) Subjects dealing with ’•White Slave* traffic. (28) Subjects dealing with the premeditated seduction of gii (29) 'First Nigit* scenes. (30) Scenes suggestive of immorality.(31) Indelicate sexual situations. (32) Situations accentuating delicate raar(l$al relations. (33) Men and ^fomen in bed together. (34) Illicit sexual relationship. (35) Prostitution and procuration. (36) Incidents indicating the actual perpetration of c assaults on women. (37) Scenes depicting the effect of veneral diseases, inherited or acquired. (38) Incidents suggestive of incestuous relations. (39) Themes and references relative to 'race suicide*. (40) Confinements. (41) Scenes laid in brothels. (42) Materialisation of the conventional figure of any founder ^d^religion.The Superintendent, Government Printing Benge.1 Government Press, Alipore, Bengal# iS /T Dated the / October 1936# it is requested that 2 copies of “Manual of the Bengal Board of Censors 1936“ may 'be sent hy V.

He informed me that the Sheikha came to call on Mrs. Skinner last night and was evidently prepared to go to the pictures. He said that although he could give an extra performance for the Shdikha, as far as the terms of hire went, still it would involve closing the Bapco club to others for two hours, and in the ordinary performances there was hardly enough room as it was. He suggested warning the Sheikh, in order to ensure that no request should be made.

To, The Honourable, The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, Persia, Persian Gulf. Sir, I beg to submit this application for your favourable consideration. With the large influx of foreigners and the general improvement on the Bahrein Island, the presence of such amenities of life as a Talkie Theatre would, I have no doubt be very welcome. After a day’s hardwork one requires some sort of amusement and diversion from the humdrum routine of life, in common with the rest of the world. Apart from the amusement one gets from a Talkie or any other inexpensive amusements is hardly necessary to expatiate how instructive and recreative it is. I should therefore be grateful if you would grant me permission to open a Talkie Theatre on a small scale which could accommodate for about hundred persons on the Bahrein Island please. Sometime ago, I understand, permission to open a Silent Picturehouse was granted to someone, which however for some reason did not eventually materialize, and since then it would appear no one seems to have taken up the matter. I understand you have granted permission to the Bahrein Petroleum Co., Ltd., to have a Talkie for their European and American Personnel only, and if you would be good enough to extend the same privilege to the general public on the Island it would certainly fill a crying need. It is my intention to have only one show a day and not more than three or four shows a week from 7 to 9 P.M. in winter and 8 to 10 P.M. in summer, or to suit the local conditions as and when required. The performance to consist of say a two-bour-programme with the main picture in English, and a complement of the usual cartoons, comics and News reels. If approved I can send out or appoint a local representa tive to attend to the necessary business to your entire satisfaction as early as possible. If for any reason it is not your intention to have the Talkie open for the general public on the Island, I request permission be kindly given me to open a private Talkie house for the foreign residents only. Thanking you in anticipation for your early and favourable reply.

Commandant State FolicManama Town (Bahrein) 29th September, 1946* H. B. M*s Political Agent, Bahrein, Persian Gulf. Respected Sir, May 1 crave your indulgence to submit the following for your magnanimous consideration and favourable orders»■* The fact that Bahrein Islands are lacking in Public entertainments of any kind is keenly felt by the ever increasing local population and foreigners, like Indians etc., and this is a great hindrance for the social uplift if no recreational facilities are forthcoming in a country. Absolutely there is nothing whatso ever, facilities in Bahrein Island, either in respect of entertain ments or recreation. After a hard days work, if a man never gets any sort of entertainments, thereby enabling him to refresh himself, his life will be nothing but a morose and melancholy one. The present only one Cinema Theatre of an antique type now running in Manama, instead of giving some entertainments to the public, has become a source of nuisance, for want of modern machinery equipments and sanitary conditions. Hence the public response to this theatre is so insignificant, due to the very low standard of entertainments derived that it is not worthwhile for the fare paid and moreover detrimental to public safety. In view of the above mentioned circumstances, I would like to state that I am prepared for the construction of an up to date Cinema Theatre, with well furnished furniture, and equipped with the most modem up to date machinery. Moreover I assure that high managing efficiency will be maintained by paying a special attention to the sanitary conditions required both inside and outside the theatre by providing urinals, and outhouses as required from time to time. lour Honour is fully aware of the transportation difficulties and my aim is to exhibit Indian and Arabic Films and also some English Pictures at intervals, so that the public may derive the best benefits for the money they spend, as regularly as the circumstances permit, without taxing the patience of the public. I need not mention that exhibition of pictures has got its own educational value also. 641 ^ Ha., Confidential.
