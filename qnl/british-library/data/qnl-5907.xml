Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the first Article of Law No.26 of 1941 amending the Land Settlement law No.29 of 193^ which was passed during the cloaing days of the recently concluded session of the Iraji Parliament. 2. The fact that such c law had fceen submitted to Parliaoient came to the notice of my predecessor about the middle of Larch an on tasking enquiries he found that, as then drafted, the first article, by providing for the insertion of the word -Iraq' trefore the word perron** In rnr»t~rgph (c) (ill) of article 10 of the Land Settlement Law No.29 of 1936, would deprive any non-Iraqi of the riidit to obtain title xo land under pX'ragwffivW )'' oP^tnalTWiroii e ariS C4at inconsequence It would seriously prejudice the interests of the Shaikh of Koweit in his properties in Iraq, his title to which is now about to be determined under the J.and Settlement Law. 3. Sir Basil ewton thereupon sent a member of the Lmbaeey etaif to make representations to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and I enclose a copy of a note verbale which was then handed to the head of the department concerned. 4. As the result of this action th Minister for Foreign Affairs took steps to have added to the Amending Law, during its passage through the Senate, a clause providing th«t the amendment to Article 10 of aw No.29 of 1936 should not cover 'foreigners to whom the Government has already given a pledge that they may obtain Tspu rights within the liwa of Basrs'* 3. Taufiq Suwaidi as Minister for Foreign Affaire discussed this clause with the Counsellor to the Embassy on March 29th and assured him that the position in regard to the properties of the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit in Iraq as established by his letter to the Ambassador of October 30th 1936 on this subject (see Sir Basil Newton’s despatch No.^3 dated 3rd November 1936) would not be in any way aTected by the new amend rent. Taufiq ISttwaidiadded that any written assurance to that effect was knnecessary. 6 . In view of the acute political crisis which was developing it was not possible to carry the matter* any further at that time but I should be glad to &lt;now whether you wish any further action to be taken in this connection when more normal conditions have been restored. 7. The other provisions of the Amending Law concerning details of procedure are now being examined by my staff but they do not appear to give rise to any points of interest or importance to His Majesty’s Government. 8 .

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence / ending with my Printed Letter Wo. 0/537-2/6 of the 28th 30th of September and discussed the present position with regard to the Shaikh of Kuwait # s Date Gardens with his Agent, Shaikh Mohommad bin Ahmad as Subah and his Legal Adviser, Abdul Jalil Partu. On my return to Kuwait His Highness called upon me and we examined the question very fully and His Highness asked for official advice on what line of action he should pursue in regard to the Bashiyah garden. I informed the Shaikh that I would address you on the subject and would communicate with him immediately on receipt of your reply. 2. The following is the present position with regard to the Bashiyah, Paddaghiyah and Pao Estates* - BASHIYAH ESTATE . On the 22nd March of this year the 10th Land Board, Basra, registered one hundred and eighty shares in this Estate in the names of All al Zuhair f s heirs and the remaining thirty six shares in the name of the As Subah. These latter shares had originally been purchased from their owner, Ahmad Pasha, by Shaikh Mubarak, Shaikh of Kuwait September and to state that I visited Basra on the 29th and in 1907 Abdul/- 2 * o / A AMul Jalil Partu stated that some time ago he had suggested to His Highness that an appeal against this decision should he filed in Baghdad on the grounds that the President of the Board had failed to give due consideration to the unofficial documents produced before him in support of His Highness * claim to’ the Estate, The Legal Adviser maintains that such documents when produced before a Land Board should oarry as much weight 9 assuming they are authentic # as official documents* The Legal Adviser was doubtful if the appeal would succeed* X share his doubts* As regards the question of His Highness suing the heirs of All Zuhair for the original purohase price the Legal Adviser was of the opinion that the suit would succeed only as far as the property of Shafiq.ah f wife of All Zuhair f was concerned, one eighth of the one hundred and eighty shares, &lt; as^when the sale to Shaikh lubarak took place, although Shaflqafc obtained a ruling from a 3hara Court to the effect that she was entitled to dispose of her children’s rights in the property j ( the actual deed of sale was not signed by Ahmad Pasha, the co guardian with Shafiqah of the children who were at the time minors* I understand that the Legal Adviser considered that the decision of the Shara Court was of doubtful validity, and that the sal© deed would probably be held to be invalid, as it had not been attested by both the guardians of the minors as it is required to be by Iraqi Lawlfc Possession of the one hundred and eighty shares of this Estate passed from His Highness to the heirs of All bin Zuhair in 1938. I am informed that in the event of it being decided to proceed against them for the return of the original i purohase money it would be possible to obtain an injunction before the suit is filed to prevent them from selling or otherwise alienating the property pending a decision in the case. The/THE yADDACrHIYAH EST/VTS # This Estate was registered in the name of the As Subah by the Land Settlement Jourt on the 21st of July although so far I have no official record of this decision. Up to now no appeal against this decision has been lodged as far as is known. The period of Limitation for such appeals is forty days but it would always be possible to put forward the recent unrest in Iraq, as a ground for an extension of the period of limitation. In fact the tegal Adviser proposes to use this very plea in the case of the Bashiyah Estate should His Highness be advised to lodge an appeal. Tin eaO ESTATES * I understand that there are two Laid. Boards at work in the Basra #ilayat f one f the 8th f dealing with the property of Iraq, subjects and the other, the 10th, with the property of foreigners. The former Board have recently asked His Highness* Agent, lhaikh Mohommad bin &lt;&amp;ma&amp; as Subah for proof that certain mosques and other buildings on the As Subah property at Fao are the property of the As Bub ^h family, and Shaikh Mohommad has very properly referred them to the 10th Land Board who are fully informed on this point. 3 . In the oases of the Eaddaghiyah and the Eao Estates no action is called for and I think it doubtful that an appeal will be lodged against the Land Board *8 decision in regard to the Eaddaghiyah Estate as long as the present change in the political atmosphere persists. As regards the Bashiyah Estate there are two possible lines of legal action neither of which seem to be at all oertaU of terminating in a decision advantageous to His Highness. I do not consider that His Highness would be well advised to appeal against the deoision of the 10th land Board and an action for the recovery of the original purchase price would not only be unlikely to succeed against that portion of the property originally owned by the minor children of All Zuhair but would re-open an unedifying series of legal actions of little profit to anyone exoapt the legal fraternity and itA it might result in a counter appeal against the Land Settlement (bo-A+ds* Court *8 decision in the case of the Ifaddaghiyah Sstate. Estate which has been alienated from the possession of the As Subah is in the neighbourhood of £,4 f 500* His Majesty*8 Government are bound by the 1914 undertaking to maintain the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak in possession of this property, but have unfortunately been unable to carry out their promise. An attempt to rehabilitate His Highness by appealing once more to the Iraqi Courts would be wearisome, expensive and most probably fruitless so I suggest that the only other line of action possible in the peculiar circumstances of the case should be taken^and that His Majesty^s Government should advise His Highness to take no further action in regard to the Bashiyah Estate and honour their obligation by paying him the present value of the property.

Holman retired with this answer which was, of course, quite worthless and did not even send a record of their conversation to the Minister for foreign Affairs which might have the effect of tying him down. x told Holman that x aufiq auwaidi's undertakin was worthless and that it was a great pity that there was nothing in writing. He said 'fesm yes, too bad of him wasn’t it? Too bad, too bad.'* 4. i do not think that we shall ever get the shaikh’s properties registered now, and am afraid we will eventually be forced to pay a very large sum m compensation.

It had been generally agreed that when appropriate moment came Shaikh should make counter-claim for recovery of original sale value of land and if he abandons this course he will presumably claim compensation from His Majesty’s Government. I do not understand why Political Agent considers that this course might lead to similar action against the Shaikh in EADDAGHIYAH estate which appears to have been bought and paid for by Shaikh Mubarak and has no# #een registered in the name of Subah. 3.

(Signature) (Designation) r i(V /N I After the death of tohd Pasha and his brother Jarrah ^ which took place in Kuwait, a dispute arose between the heirs of the afore-mentioned deceased brothers and their uncle iubara.k Pasha El Subah concerning their shares of the estate. The case was reported to His Majesty the Sultan and a Committee was jj appointed by a Koyal Irada to see the case and settle the dispute. The Committee was to be formed by the Grovernor of Basrah from Basrah ilayat. The Committee should be trusted ajid agreed upon by both parties. The Royal Irada was telegraphed to Basrah on the 18th of August, 1314, a,nd following is the translation of the Turkish telegram: - 'Regarding the dispute existing for two yea.rs between I I Mubarak Pasha El Subah the present Ruler of Kuwait and the heirs of IB °hd El Subah, for their shares, and as this dispute would lead to a big trouble His Majesty’s G-ovenr'ient ordered a Committee to be elected. This Committee is to be trusted by both parties and will be authorised to set^e the dispute. The decision of the Committee concerning the settlement of the shares of both sides will be considered as final without any objection and the Royal Irada will be announced. The Ministry of the Interior will be informed.” The Committee was formed and the members were as follows:- 1. Haj Mansoor Bin Haj SuTman. 2. Abdul Mahab Bin G-ertas. 3. Mohamad Jafar Bin Agha Abdul Nabi. So we the above mentioned members of the arbitrator Committee are authorised by the Government to study the case and pronounce the last decision which is to be accepted by both parties without any objection or appeal as our judgment is legal and according to the Royal Irada. So we hastened to settle the dispute between the two parties. Subah Beg bin Mohamad Pasha clammed for his part and as a guardian of his half brother Ali who is idiotic and on benalf of his ha.lf sister Latifa s,nd his two whole brothers Khalid and Adhbi and his nephew Hemood and niece Modhi, son and daughter of his deceased uncle Jarrah. His guardianship for the above minor persons is legal and proved by the legal document dated 25th.| Muharram 1314, under the seal and signature of Ahmad Hilmi Hffendi fne then Deputy of Basrah. He, Subah, claimed also on behalf of /thosethose for whom he is a legal representative according to the document dated 29th of Rejab 1315 under the seal and signature of the afore-mentioned Deputy, he was authorised by Sheikha Bint Ali El Ibrahim, the wife of deceased Ali Bin Jabir El Subah, and her two daughters (from Ali Bin Jabir) Munira and Loolwa. His whole brother Seood Beg claimed also for himself. They both stated in their suit against their uncle Mubarak Pasha that both their father Mohamad Pasha and his brother Jarrah died on the 24th Dhi El Kada 1313. The former was inherited by his sons Subali and Seood with his mother Loolwa Bint Mohamad SI Thakib and his other children i.e. ali, the idiotic, and Khalid, Adhbi and Latifa who are minor. He has no other legal heirs besides them. Their claim was approved by a document as follows:- He left 66 shares out of which 11 shares for the mother and 10 shares for each son and 5 shares for his daughte r Latifa . Jarrah was inherited by his mother and his wife Munira and his son Hemood and his daughter Moodhi who are still minor, and are mentioned above. Jarrah has no other legal heir besides these and he left 48 shares to be divided as follows:- 8 Shanes for the mother 6 Shanes for the wife 24 Shares for the son Hemood 12 Shares for the daughter Modhi. Thev also claimed that their father Mohamad Pasha left a separate legacy which consists of all date gardens inside Basrah known as Kut El Zein, Ajrawyah, Kardalan, v/hich are registered in the KKAbu T I of Basrah ' hlayat and after the death of their father, their uncle Mubarak Pasha, extorted, the afore-mentioned gardens. They asked him to give back their property which is their legal property according to the documents. They claimed besides that, that their father and uncle left their shares of the property left by their father /Subahwammmmgmgm 3 ® -^0 Subah and which is their legal right and what was left by Ali Bin Subah to his heirs, of whom Sabah Beg is the Deputy (Representative) i.e. their share from all date gardens of Basrah ' ,T i lay at. One is known as territory of FA 1 ' bordered by Khor Abdullah from the ’ est and by a small river from the North which separates it from NaKHALISTaN of El MAAMIR which is the property of the heirs of Nasir Pasha El Sadoon, and by Shat- El-Arab on the East and by the sea on the South except the two Khors which are inside the said boundaries and are known as KHOR-EL-DORaG-I and Khor Ali El Sager. These two Khors are the property of their uncle Mubarak Pasha and the heirs of Fatima Bint Mohamad El Mohamad the wife of Mohamad Pasha to be divided equally between them. The second garden is well known as 300FYA in the same Milayat. They also claim for their shares of the property in Kuwait itself which consists of 88 shops, houses, many horses, other animals, boats, furniture, money and debts forced by their uncle Mubarak Pasha after the death of their father and uncle. They asked their uncle Mubarak Pasha to hand over to them the shares of their legators, in addition to the shares of those for whom Subah Beg is legal representative and those who is their guardian. Mubarak Pasha admitted that he had laid hand on the property claimed by the claimers after the death of his two brothers Mohamad and Jarrah and that the two brothers were inherited by the persons mentioned above, but regarding the property in Kut El Zein, AJRaWYA and GARDALAN, even, it is registered in the KHaKANI register in the name of his elder brother Mohamad, that does not show that it is his property, but because he was the elder brother and according to the custom of the Subah Family, all the property should be registered in the name of the elder brother. He proved that by a document signed and sealed by his brothers Mohamad and Jarrah stating that the property is to be divided equally among the three brothers. f Mubarak Pasha also claimed that 1/6 of the shares of his two brothers should be given to their mother, i.e. his mother Loolwa n /and- 4 - and he asks for the said share of his mother, being her representative. Regarding the property of FAW, SOOFYA and the landed property in Kuwait is undivided property ol all the heirs of Jabir FI Subah. He rejected the claim regarding the shares of the legators of the two claimers and denied the other part of the claim. The claim regarding Kut El Zein, G-ardalan and iijrawya is to be dropped by the claimers as the documents in the possession of Mubarak Pasha, show and prove his rights in the said property and so we decided to pay no attention to their claim as the documents which Mubarak Pasha brought to this office are under seal and signature of Mohamad Pasha, and his brother Jar rah which are evident and well known to us, so we decided that the date gardens are to be divided equally among Mubarak Pasha and his two deceased brothers, Mohamad and Jarrah and that 1/6 of the Mohamad and Jarrah be handed over to Mubarak Pasha being legal share of his mother Loolwa Bint Mohamad El Thakib. But for the other part of the claim which Mubarak Pasha denied it and the claimer could not prove it by any written statement or any other evidence and as they are relatives we warned them and advised them to come to an agreement and to reconcile. They in fact did as we advised them and so Mubarak Pasha reconciled the elder children of his two deceased brothers personally and the younger ones with the idiotic son through their legal guardian dubah Beg. And he, Mubarak, reconciled the heirs of Ali El Jabir El Subah i.e. Sheikha Bint Ali El Ibrahim and her daughter (from Ali El Jabir) Loolwa for their shares which they inherited from Ali El Jabir and he also reconciled Ilmira Bint Ali El Jaoir for her shares which she inherited from her father Ali El Jabir and from her husband Jarrah. This agreement was made through their legal representative Subah. So they agreed to leave to Mubarak Pasha all their shares and rights inherited to them by Ali El Jabir, Mohamad Pasha and Jarrah El Subah i.e. all date gardens, landed property, personal estates, horses, other animals, money in cash, debts etc . The property given by Mubarak Pasha to the claimers /includes- 5 - &gt;r; includes the five date gardens in Basrah /ilayat and are as follov r s:- 1. SOOlT/i. ''hich is in Faw and demarcated by the Government property known as E]-Dawasir on T,r . r est and South and by the property of NAGrIB ASHRAF El Basrah on the North and by El Kharm which separates it from the property of El SADA on the East. 2.

Demarcated by the said river from the R r est and the property of Salim Bab.er El SaJim from North and by the land known by SABKHA from the East and by the property of Mohd El STAYED EL SHUAIBI and by a part of El Naoib property from the South. 3. T 3 r T EL ZAA At aBOL KILISIB. Demarcated by El SABKHA from the Yest and by the property of KHZAAL PHian bin Jabir Khan from the North and by Shat-El-Arab from the East and by the property of the heirs of Nasir Pasha El Sadoon from - the South. 4. aL .AJKA'YA .. . At A1 Ajrawya District. Demarcated by Shat-El-Arab from the est and by the property of A ? I00 M a Bint Kasim Pasha El Zeheir from the North and by A tr KAF EL FARa.GH known as El Solehya from the East and by the property of Hohamad bin Ali SI AJ: r I and a part of the property :{EGaYA known as iTBA. 5. aL Dii'ASIR. Better known as HLKHOR which is the legal property of the reconciliator, Mubarak Pasha and which contains three gardens. First is demarcated by El Sabkha from the T ' r est and by the river which separates it from the property of Yusif El Sager of Kuwait from the North and by El Naqeeb property from the Ea.st and by the Government property from the South. Second and third are both demarcated by El Sabkha from the Y/est and by the Government property from the North and South and by the river from the East. They agreed upon the sum of 8296 Liras and i of a Lira in cash, which Mubarak Pa.sha, the reconcilia/fcor, gave from his own money and handed it to the other party in the presence of the Committee of reconciliation and the two claimers received, the afore-mentioned amount from the hand of one of us i.e. Hag Alans oor- 6 - © Mansoor Bin Haj Sal aan. Suha,h Beg agreed for himself and on behalf of those who he represents and of those of whom he is a guardian, with his brother Seood Beg and accepted this reconcil iation as it is stated above and they received five gardens and the reciprocality amount in cash. They both confessed that they have received the reciprocality, both in cash and property and that this reciprocality is for all their rights and shares bequeathed to them and to those represented by one of them, Subah Beg and to those of whom Subah Beg is the legal guardian, by Ali Jabir, Mohd Pasha and Jarrah El Subah, v/hether little or much, worthy or unworthy, transferred or fixed, known or unknown. The brothers dropped their rights and the rights of those for whom Subah is legal guardian and representative and acquitted their uncle Mubarak: saying 'we, for ourselves and on behalf of those represented by one of us, Subah, declare herein that we have no rights or shares to claim against our uncle Mubarak Pasha neither for our legators nor for the legator of those represented by one of us, as mentioned above, regarding all the estate of Fa.w and the property in Kuwait as agreed upon'. Mubarak Pasha also acquitted his nephews (sons of his two brothers Mohamad and Jarrah) and Sheikha, Munira and Loolwa, for himself and on behalf of his mother whom he represents. He, Mubarak Pasha, acquitted them for the reciprocality, both in cash and property delivered to them. He, Mubarak Pasha, confessed and declared that neither he nor his mother have any ^ight or claim at any time regarding the five estates of date ga,rdens, stated above, and that the said gardens including their legal boundaries are not any more under his possession or his property but they became the legal property of the sons of his two brothers Mohamad and Jarrah. They have free hand to act and do whatever they like with their legal property and no one of Subah 1 s family has any right to interfere or object. He also acquitted them for the money in cash, which he paid them as reciprocality amount. Both parties have agreed and accepted willingly this . ; /reconciliation- 7 - reconciliation and sealed it with their seals appearing below:- Seood Mohamad El Subah Subah Mohamad El Subah IJnbarak P a sha i!j 1 Subah. As the above-mentioned reconciliation was reached and agreed upon by both parties according to the legal ways and the dispute was settled peacefully and it is regarded as more beneficial and much better solution for the idiotic and the minor persons who are represented by their representative and guardian, Subah Beg, so we decided unanimously and judged that the reconciliation was necessary and it has been reached and agreed upon. r e wrote two copies of this document and gave the original to Mubarak Pasha and the copy of that after being signed and sealed by Mubarak Pasha, we handed to the guardian.

PARTU lives in Basra and the simplest plan would seem to be the one outlined in paragraph 2 of your telegram T/727 December 3rd. It seems ridiculous that I should repair to Basra to serve summonses on PARTU who resides within the jurisdiction of the Iraq, courts and the sphere of influence of the British gaiaa Consul. 3. The case was to be heard on the 29th November and the summonses have not yet been served ©o neither the Shaikh nor his attorney have any legal knowledge of the appeal. I strongly recommend that in the interests of His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh the Ambassador make it quite clear to the Iraq Government that the Shaikh’s failure to be represented on the date of hearing of the appeal was in no way due to negligence on his part. I see nothing suspicious in this action nor in the Ambassador suggesting that a further dat€^ for the hearing of the appeal should be fixed. PoliticalTranslation of letter dated the 6th November, 1941, from Abdul Jalil Parto to Shaikh Mohammed Al-Ahmed As-Subah. After Compliments, I wish to give you the good news I have, that is, the Land Settlement Committee rejected Shaikh Ali El-Subah's claim, by a decision from the said Committee and they decided to register the garden of Fao in the favour of the successors of Shaikh Mubarak El-Subah. This decision, i.e. to register the gardens in the name of the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak, was reached as we were not given the names of persons in whose favour they should be registered and this is a secondary matter. We can register any number of shares to any person you want after the final settlement is reached. I heard that the lawyer Sulaiman El-Shawaf, had lodged an appeal in the case of Al-Bashiah and this means that we have a right to appeal upto the day of hearing which is 7th February, 1942. I suggest to appeal immediately so that the document may be served on the lawyer of our opponent and we will attend the court with the appeal for El-Faddaghiya. I beg you to let me know, as soon as possible, if your father agrees to this course. Usual Ending.rgr Telegram S I’rora No To Political A.gent, Kuwait. Political Resident, Bushire.

BETAKANDUM -A de cisiQn rejecting claim of, Shaikh All Al-aubah/ ^^ lY i Shaikh Ali Al-Subah, whose lawyers were Saiyed Hasan Abdur Rahman and Saiyed Abdur Rahman A1 Umar, claimed that he, Shaikh Ali Al-Subah, has his legal shares in the garden of Fao which the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak claim to be their property only. The shares claimed by Shaikh Ali are his legal shares in this garden which is demarcated by Khor Abdullah on the West and by the river separating it from gardens of El Maamer on the North and by Shat-El-Arab on the East and by the sea on the South, and which he claimed to be bequeathed by his father, Shaikh Mohamad. He also claimed that the HAWZ, named Hawz Mohamad bin Mohamad El Abdulla was bequeathed by his mother Fatima bint Mohamad El Mohamad. He claimed also that half of the two HAWZES, namely Hawz El Dawrag and Hawz Ali El Sager was bequeathed by his afore-mentioned mother. The lawyer, Saiyed Jalil Parto, who is Deputy General 'ot Shaikh Mubarak Al-Subah*s heirs, replied saying that the garden which the claimant claims to have legal shares is altogether the property of those whom he represents. He proved that by the document of reconciliation reached between Shaikh Mubarak Al-Subah and Subah and Seood the two sons of Muhamad Al-Subah and which was managed by the Committee appointed by the Governor of Basrah according to the Royal Irada dated 8th of August, 1314, and by many letters from the Governor of Basrah, the tax papers, agreements with the farmers who were working in the garden and many other cases seen by the courts of first instance and courts of Peace and which were filed against the farmers and the workers. As the claimer was interdicted, being considered idiotic, and he made his brother Subah, his guardian according to a legal document No .446 dated 25th Muharram 1314. Subah, the guardian had signed /thethe said document of acquittance, being the legal guardian of his idiotic brother. The attorney of the claimer replied to this that the said document of acquittance bears no seal of his client and that his client does not know that such agreement was reached in regard of his shares bequeathed by his father and mother and that this document is not free from defects. If such a document was supposed to be existing, even then, it would not effect my clients rights, because the sumnons of seizure were not served on him and according to Article No.962 of MAJALLA, in spite of the injustice of this r document of acquittance which was not registered in TA^OO • offices and there is no length of time as the confession is existing and no length of time among partners and that the dependents pay amounts of money to the successors of Mohammad j El Subah every year from the products of this garden and the said document shows that Hawz El Dorag and Hawz Ali El Sager are in partnership between Mubarak El Subah and the successors of Fatima bint Mohairmad El Mohammad, who is the mother of my client. Last of all nothing is mentioned in the supposed document about the legacy of the inheritor of my client i.e. the afore-mentioned Fatima . I therefore request to give sentence in favour of my client for his legal shares. The attorney, who is the Deputy of the defendants replied to this stating that the pretext of the Deputy of the claimant concerning the stated decision to be containing the rights of his legator in this garden before the year 1314 is rejected as the acquittance was reached and included all rights from this date, and my client never admitted neither clearly nor by interpretation that the claimer had any right in the garden of Fao, and what my client used to pay to the heirs of Mohammad A1-Subah was simply a help and it does not mean that they were given their shares from the products of the said garden, thus /the- 3 - the claim has no foundation; it was not necessary to sunmon the idiotic who was interdicted,being interdicted according to Article No.957 of the MAJALLA. The session was postponed in order to hear the statement of Shaikh Subah who attended the court on the day appointed for pleading, and he, Subah bin Mohanmad As-Subah stated that his brother Ali As-Subah was idiotic and he, Subah, was appointed his guardian and signed the document of acquittance. As the claimer, Shaikh Ali Subah, was dead, when the court was seeing the case, all his heirs were sumnoned three days before the day fixed by the court to see the case. None of the heirs attended the court, (except Shaikha bint Ali Subah, who was not sunmoned because she lives in Kuwait). The attorney, Saiyed Hassan Abdur Rahman was asked whether he has anything more to say. He stated that he had no more explanations or anything else to say concerning the case. Thus as there is no more to be said in this respect the decision was reached by the court and he was informed that the case was brought to an end. . After studying the case carefully, hearing the appeals and studying the documents the following decision was madei- 1. The claimant, Shaikh Ali Subah was idiotic according appointed Shaikh Subah to be his guardian. 2. The acquittance took place for all shares of the Deputy of the claimer of the document is not mentioned especially after the confession of the guardian, who is the brother of the claimer, that the document was legal and he acknowledged his signature. his mother, which he said that they were not included in the document of acquittance, is not mentioned, as his mother had died to his brother Shaikh Subah^s statement and was interdicted according to the lawful document dated 25th Muharram 1314 and the legal judge claimer and the guardian had signed the document. The denial of the 3. The claim of the claimant concerning the shares of before the acquittance took place and which included all his shares /4.- 4 - 4. The attorney of the claimer claimed that his client was not suirmoned that he was interdicted according to the Article No.962 of the MAJALLA of the Adlya court, which shov/s that the decision should be served on him. But this also is not mentioned, because the idiotic was interdicted and therefore it was not necessary to serve on him,as it is made clear by the Article No.957 of the same MAJALLA. 5. The claim of the Deputy of the claimer in regard of the amounts of money paid by the defendant annually to the heirs of Mohammad As-Subah as a part of the products of the said garden. This is also not mentioned, as there is no clear statement in the document in the possession of the Deputy which may approve that the defendant gave the sums of money from the products of this property or being the rights of the claimer. 6. The claim raised by the Deputy of the claimer about other property registered in TAPO by the name of the legator of my client - and after enquiring the TAPO office of Basrah and receiving their reply with the copy of the registered property it was clear that this does not refer to this garden, which is the cause of the dispute. So this claim was dismissed also. This being the case and owing to the document of acquittance and the correspondence which took place between the then existing G-ovemment and the defendant and to the cases filed by the defendant against the farmers working in this property and to the free hand he, the defendant, had for the period of 25 years, it was decided to reject the claim placed by the claimer. This decision is liable to appeal or distinction, and he was informed by this openly.Translation of letter No.629/6 Fao, from the Land Settlement Department, Government of Iraq, Basrah, to the Mudir Nahya, Zubair.

Appeal mentioned in my telegram No. C/687 of Decemher 18th appears to he between the heirs of Shafipah and Shaikh does not seem to he affected. Partu will confirm after he returns from Baghdad at the beginning of January. Date of hearing of appeal February 7th. ? ADDAGHI YAH. On November the 29th appellate Court noted that Shaikh had not been served and gave Yebruary the 7th as new date for hearing. Case against Shaikh is that when Dobbs ordered registration in name of Mubarak and estate was duly registered Ayesha Zair grand mother of Kamal Abdullah Zair appellant through Sulairaan Shawaf attorney was not present. Also on grounds that Court of Cassation from whence case was transferred to Land Board has not yet given decision. ?A0. Estate registered in name of Shaikh Mubarak by Land Board and Partu has been told to obtain copy of Court's order. One Habbaba has petitioned the Land Board against this decision and her case will be heard on January 8 th. 3. Partu considers that chance of an appeal by Shaikh succeeding in Bashiyah case very flimsy but as appeal is being heard on same day as Paddaghiyah considers it better for appeal to be lodged as little extra expense will be caused and the Shaikh will be satisfied that every thing possible has been done. In view of the changed circumstances since my letter No.C/545- 2 - hi\ dated Octotjer 4th I suggest that Shaikh he advised to lodge an appeal. 4 . I have had drafted a comprehensive power of attorney for Partu empowering xhim to accept service in all cases arising out of Land Board's proceedings. This will he signed and authenticate: and will he sent to him immediately after the Id. He will he instructed to inform Appellate Court that he is empowered to accept service. 5. I have been informed that the heirs of Shafiqah have no property (see British Consulate Basra letter December 18th) as I have already pointed out and in any case no action can he taken until after hearing of appeal on February 7th if my suggestion that Shaikh should appeal is agreed to. In the meantime I will make further enquiries regarding the financial position of the heirs of Shafiqah. 6 . As a second date of hearing has been fixed in Paddaghiyah case I propose returning summonses to Embassy as presumably Court will issue fresh ones whichthey will serve on Partu. - PoliticalH.C.

We had already learnt that the kiuhair were appealing against the decision to register 36 shares in the Bashiyah estate in the names of the as Bubah and are advising the ahi^akh of huwait to enter a counter-appeal. We have previously advised against an action being brought to recover # the amount paid under the original contract of sale, because we believe that the condition which you state is not fulfill- ed. Bo far as we are aware any decree obtained as the result of such a suit could only be executed against the personal property left by Bhdfiqah deceased who and not Ahmad Pasha sold the 180 shares in the Bashiyah estate to Bhaikn i-uoarak* and we have been informed that such property consists only of an eighth part of these 180 shares. «.e did not think it worth while instituting a suit with a view to obtaining such meagre satisfaction especially as the ^uhair party would undoubtedly use every subterfuge to pre vent the execution against their property of any decree that might be passed. If however we have been mis informed or have in any way misjudged the situation we should be most grateful if you would enlighten us. are sending a copy of this letter to h.M.ijimbassy bagadad, and the Political Agency at Kuwait.

The Ministry enclose the two documents and request in the case of the one, a letter, attestation of the seals thereon of the Sharia Court and the Sharia Judge, Ku./ait, and in the case of the other, which purports to be a probate, its authentication as being a probate truly emanating from the Ku/ait Court. It is further requested that the Court may be asked to sign the probate in question in case the procedure in force there requires that it should be signed, and that the tv/o documents should be returned after completion of the-e formalities. &gt;1 The solicitors are prepared to pay all the necessary fees and expenses. /; The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity \ . i to express their highest consideration and esteem.Copy of Note No.58/14/42, dated the 17th February, 1942, from His Majesty s British Embassy, Ba^yidad, to the Political Agency, Kuwait.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency’s letter No.42-32/1, dated the 1st March, 1942, with the enclosure, which I fully understood. I wish to inform Your Excellency that the letter addressed to Ahmad Ali a1 Subah is of no legal value, and has no connection with claims of Habbaba Bint Yusuf El-Ghaneem. Therefore I cannot authenticate these documents, because if the document which they call Probate was a true document I would have signed it and sent it to you for attestation of the seal as usual. I am so sorry to s nd these documents without attestation for the reasons stated * above. rx *i /&lt;, p Copy of letter No.57-.'52/l, dated the 15th March, 1942, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait.

Your Highness has been asked to attest the seal and signature of the Judge of the Sharia Court Kuwait on a letter addressed to Shaikh Ahmad bin Ali A1 Mohammad As Subah by the aforesaid Judge. The attestation of the seal by Your Highness does not in any way mean that you agree that the contents of the document are correct. In regard to your son , s statement that in the lawyer’s opinion you should prove that the letter in no way refers to the Lady Habibah; I am not in agreement with this view and consider that it is the duty of Your Highness* counsel to bring any facts regarding this letter which he may consider are advantageous to your cause to the notice of the President of the 10th Land Board. Should the seal and signature be authentic which it would appear they undoubtedly are then I feel that it is desirable that Your Highness should comply with the request that they be attested. 3. In regard to the alleged Probate, This document appears to be a note made by the Judge of the Sharia Court in explanation of ho.v he arrives at the sum of fc.437/8/- as being the share of the parents of a person unspecified. I agree that the document cannot be considered as a Probate and therefore should not be countersigned and will should Your Highness approve inform His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy in Baghdad accordingly. &lt; :• Copy of letter No.R/6/1713, dated the 21st March, 1942. from flis Highness the Ruler of Kuvait, to Major T. Hickmbotham, QBE., Political Agent, Kuwait. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency’s letter No.57-32/1, dated the 15th March, 1942, contents of which I fully understood. I therefore wish to inform Your Excellency that the attached document, addressed to Ahmad Ali Al Subah and sent by the Judge of Kuwait, is a true document, but its contents are not true at all. There was a misunderstanding in the brought before the Court here, by some of the heirs, and in fact the Court issued another letter to the aforementioned .Ahmad explaining the matter to him and relating the truth. It is quite evident that he, Ahmad, has hidden the second letter and built his claim on the facts stated in the first one, just to create trouble. Your Excellency will make out the misunderstanding, by reading the second letter, a copy of which I enclose herewith. But as to the Probate document, it is not worth to be taken in consideration, as it was not meant for a specified person, therefore it cannot be countersigned. I hope you will kindly forward the second letter to the authorities concerned, so that they may find out the truth. I have already written to my son Mohammad and have sent him a copy of this letter also to show it tc our lawyer. Probate, in regard eJ some of the heirs. This fact wasCopy of letter No.143, dated 2nd Dhil-Hejja, 1560, from the Judge of Sharia Court, Kuwait to Shaikh Ahmad al-Shaikh Ali as-Subah. I wrote you a letter on the 12th Dhil-Kada, 1360, stating that you have a share in what Moza el-Dawood left at her death and that this is a legal heritage coming to you through Sabika al-Subah. That decision was taken according to what was related to us by abdullah al-Ali-al-ndhbi. But when the heirs were asked to agree to the division of the heritage as I explained to you by that letter some of them refused to agree to the Probate in respect of Sabika f s share to those mentioned thereof, claiming that Mohamad died before his mother, and we could not get any proof to prove the claim that Mohamad died after his mother. 7 r e therefore held the heritage of Sabika until the matter is made quite clear. We write you this letter so that you may not depend on our previous letter dated 12th Dhil Kada, 1360. We will write to you as soon as the final result is obtained. In the meantime we beg you to prepare a Power of Attorney appointing some one to represent your mother and brothers, in case there will be any shares proved to be your legal rights, we will hand them to your Representative.-v r No. -32/1.

A.fter Compliments, T met the lawyer Sulaiman Raidhy txhis evening and told him of our wish to appoint him as our Lawyer. He agreed to do so provided that he may study all the documents in connection with all our cases of our property of Basrah, whether in the Courts,or administrative Boards loth here and in Baghdad. He asked I.D.150/- per annum, besides the travelling expenses which we will have to pay him also. He told me that he cannot appear in our case in the Court of Ippeal in Baghdad, because he had entered this same case as our litigant in the Court of Hirst Instance in Basrah y and according to the law, he is not allowed to appear both^dag dHrtigant and plaintiff in the same case, so he is unable to the appear in this case. Me advises us to appoint one of/famous Lawyer of Baghdad, in this case only, like Nasrat Haresi, Majeeb el-Rawi, Wbas el-^aradi or Yusuf el-Kabeer, but he preferrs the appointment of Yusuf the el-Kabeer, I told him thai/said Lawyer Yusuf El-Kabeer had rendered a valuable advice to us in el Hadaghya’s case. I then went to ibdul Jalil Partu, our old Lawyer, who is now 'Rayes Baladiya” of Basrah. Te met him ia his house. He gave me a letter to you which I am enclosing herewith. I think it would be very nice if Your Highness would write him a letter of congratulations for his new post, \bdul Jalil Partu told me that Sulaiman Paidhy will not be able to appear in our case in Baghdad on our behalf as he acted as our litigant before in the same case, so he advised and urged us to appoint Yusuf el Kabeer who is in Baghdad, and to send him all the documents related to the case to unable him to study them carefully before appearing in the Court. In this case we will have to give him a general Power of attorney on behalf of all the family members so that he may be summoned and enter the case directly in order to s^ve time and prevent the postponement of the case which will not be in our favour. That is what I have done according to the instructions of Your/Your Highness.

If they will agree to this, then we can approach the Lawyer Yusuf el Kaheer as soon as we can, and when the Hon’hle tie Political Resident and His Excellency the Political Agent have agreed upon this appointment, then I shall he waiting =Your Highness* esteemed order to hand over all the documents concernign this case, to the Lawyer Yusuf el Kaheer through the Lawyer Sulaiman Faidhy, as Sulaiman Eaidhy is quite prepared to go to Baghdad and arrange the matter with Yusuf el Kaheer as soon as I receive Your Highness* order.

Shaikh Mubarak bin H&amp;med bin Mubarak had refueed to give His Highness a power of attorney to act on behalf of his half brother Fahad and his two half sisters, who have been cited by the appeallants as parties to the case, on the grounds that they were illegitimate and not entitled to siiare in the estate and that if he gave a power of attorney then the Sbariya Court might hold then to be recognised as legit irate by him and they would have a claim on his deceased father’s sVjre of the estate. The Secretary informed me tlmt the Sunni Qad’d had refused to certify that they ware illegitimate according to his reading of the law they must be considered ojs legitimate so that there was no possibility of produoirg a Shari yah Court ruling and instructing the advocate to contest thsir being parties to the suit* They have as it happens been parties for a long time but it is only recently that an interfering old busy body by name Shaikh Yusuf bin Isa who ;raa himself QaiM at ono time br,B nereiisdod the youth Shaikh Mubaralc bin Hamad that he might, by excluding his half brother and half sisters on the grounds of illegitimacy, acquire their share for himself. His Hi^'mess* Secretary told me tliat His Highness Imd spoken to the yomig man but to no avail so I spoke to his uncle Shaikh Abdul lah bin Mubarak and sent the Secretary to reason :1th him, 4, The Secretary comnaudcated with me early this morning and said that he had boon unable to persuade the young man to see reason and that there was nothing for it but to send powers of attorney without Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad’s young relatives being mentioned by nam and. hope that the omission would not be noticed* I said that I would see His Highness at once and called upon him at 8-15 a.m. He told roe that he had explained every thing to Shaikh Mubarak bin Haroed and had told him that the power of attorney only related to this case and could have no bearing on the future division cf the property but that he had not been able to bring him to his senses, I asked His Highness if he realised that if this appeal was lost owing to negligence/negligence on the part of the As~Subah and the estates concerned were alienated Ills L&amp;jeety’s Government would probably refuse to consider favourably any claim which he might make on them under the 1914 undertaking. He said he quite understood but that Shaikh Mubarak bin Ifamd would not /agree and was a child and stupid and asked me if I would see him and endeavour to persuade him to be reasonablo. I assented and His Highness iiaaediately issued instructions for - i the lad to be sent to the Agency* 5 * I used every argument I could think off and put the whole case as clearly aa it whs humanly possible but for some time I was unable to make Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad see that by the attitude he was adopting lie was making it easy for the opposition to acquire the whole 6 b tat a and that txiere would I then be nothing to divide between hLr^elf t the rest of trie As-Subih t .und ills young relatives. I explained His Majesty's Government' a position most plainly* and continued my rxgunsnts by conjuring up rows of irete relatives v,ho had lost their shares through his obstinacy. Eventually he agreed to sign the po^er of attorney if His Highneas would give him an undertaking in writing that by so he did not in any way prejudice his case vis-a-via lus young relatives. His Highness agreed to this at once and the document was duly executed and witnessed by the Qadhi. Taat its legal value is I have very little idea. | The powers of attorney Aero signed aai countersigned and sent by the mail car which bad bean held up until noon for them and with luck they will be registered in Basrah on Saturday and be in the advocate Yusuf al Kabir’s hands on Sunday 24th.

Sir I hare the honour to refer to my telegram No .C/703 dated the 27th December, 1941, and ny telegram Ho.819, dated the 23th August, 1942. 2. It now appears that the position in regard to the Fao estate as described in paragraph 2 of my telegram of the 27th of December, 1941, is hot correct as tne statements of Abdul Jalil i'artu, His aigtlrtess , late Attorney, on which that description ms based mro not accurate. The case is in fact still before the 10th Land Board but, I understand, the President of the Board hopes to finish the case in two months’ time. 3. The Fao estate comprises the original lands that belonged to His Highness' grandfather dhaikh Mubarak, a considerable area of land reclaimed from the river on the east side of tne property, and a lesser area reclaimed from the waste lands to the west of the property. That the whole of the'original estate will be registered in His Highness 1 name there is little doubt, but the considerable depth and is threaded by the water channels which passir^ from the river to the gardens behind form the sole means of cons rami cat ion between the gardens and the river and alorg which must pass the produce of the gardens during tne date season and the requirements of the cultivators at all times. Should these reclaimed lands not be registered in the name of the Shaikh they together with certain pther adjacent ss ’ estate, ilaturally water rights' and rigilts of way will be legally assigned to him but even so the position will be ideal from a mischief-makers point of view and it may well be that the “Date^Garden Case’' will continue for many more years to be the bete noir of H.B.M’s iskabassy in Ba&amp;xLbd and the Political agency in Kuwait. 4. Reclaimed lands are normally planted by tiie owners of the adjacent territory either by themselves or by their tenants with materials supplied by the owners so that after a lapse of time they become absorbed in the original estate and the owners thereof register the lands as part or their property and pay such taxes and dues as may be leviable. Thus the 10th Land hoara would ordinarily register these reclaimed lands adjacent to His Highness’ property, which have been brought into cultivation by His higmieas’ t -- 8 Hi^uiess 9 name, but and 1 understand m | ds from registering question of the reclaimed land is a very serious one. On the river front this land is in places of not owned by the As dubah will completely encircle2 land of this nature in the none of a forei^Tier thus the President of the Board, should he proceed according to the law and there is no reason to suppose he will not, will be forced to dispossess the Shaikh and will haTo to decide in whose na*ne the land should be registered* Ho doubt his decision will be influenced by the case of Shaikh Xhaasal of Mohanra^rah in which the Land Board awarded the reclaimed area to the tenants actually tilling the ground. Therefore unless some means can be devised of alteriiig the law, we shall find the area of land between the Shaikh of Kuwait* and inhabited will no longer require to woric ror anyone'uwv «. people ignorant and easily swayed by clever and unscrupulous persons* 5* That it is highly desirable that good relations with His Highness and between Kuwait and Iraq should be maintained there am be no doubt nor can t ere be any reasonable doubt that a decision by the -uaud Board alienating a considerable portion of what His Highness considers at the present time, rightly or wrongly, to be his property will not be at all conducive to the continuance of good relations either with His Highness now or between the two countries in the future. I am ignorant of the principle and practice of the land laws of Iraq but suggest that the legal position be examined by skilled persons at H.B # Ii t s Embassy in Baghdad to see if there is any possible legal my by which tills unfortunate state of affairs can be prevented. I‘ fear it will be a fruitless task and tliai the only way will be for the Iraq Crovernment to be moved to amend the law to enable an exception to be made in His Highness 1 case and authorise the registration of the lands in his name.

Please refer to my letter No.C/829, dated the 30th August, 1942, and my telegram No.819, dated the 28th August, 1942. 2. On my recent visit to Basrah I found the legal position regarding the Fao estate and the Fadda^Jiiyah and Bashiyah appeals so obscure that despairing of obtaining a clear ajxl concise conception of the situation from Suliman Fadhi I rang up Goode the President of the 10th Land Board and asked if he would be prepared to receive me and give me information about the Fao estates. He replied in the affirmative and I called at his office later the same morning and he was kind enou^i to give me much valuable information and show me the Survey nap ox the Fao estates. The information which I received has been embodied in my letter urxier reference. 3. I also sought enlightenment regarding the delays in the hearing of the Faddaghiyah and Bashiyah appeals, you will remember the appeals were to be aeard on the 25th Bay and then on the 11th July and were then postponed to the 8th August and that they now seem to have been put off till after the Ramazan, and received the impression that my suspicion that the Bench were not too anxious to hear the case might be well founded. I am now assured that all the necessary papers are in Nazarat al Farasi*3 hands in Bag dad. whatever may have been the case up to the last hearing, and that there can be no reasonable excuse for a further postponement, but before the case comes on I suggest the Embassy be asked to cause discrete enquiries to be made about the integrity of deciding authority. We nave a clear case and want justice and that quickly. 4. The Shaikh's Agent, his Basrah Attorney and his Baghdad Counsel have all been quite remarkably slack - it would seem that it ms only ourselves wio wished to finish the case - and with His Highness* full agreement I spoke plainly to Suliman Fadhi. To my regret Shaikh nohammad was at Fao. Yours sincerely, The Hon'ble Lt. Col. W.R. Hay, C.I.E.. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain* wA. ^t' File N' Section- Heading DEPT. j Pros.

It Is quite ooxvect that the earlier adjourmuents were applied for by the Shaikh’s lawyers and that they did not act in as prompt and diligent a ttsaaor a© could have been desired, it is worth while noting that both these gentlemen, Haji SnUmn Fad hi in Basra and Haaarat al Farsi in 8a^d«A # were only briefed by His Highness after ooaaul- tation with the {embassy in Baghdad in the case of the last named and the Consulate General in iasra In the case of the first nailed, but it is our opponent© who are now failing to appear in Court and being granted adjournment® and the suspicion mentioned sfy *-H\ in paragraph 3 of my deed official letter HO.c/890 dated August the 50th. not paragraph 4 as stated by ; Thompson is rapidly becoDw ing a certainty. 3.

When discussing this aspect of the case with me Good was probably referring to Article of Law No,25 of 1941 ammending the Land Settlement Law Uo,29 of 1938 by which the word 'Iraq' was inserted before 'person* in paragraph (c) (111) of Article 10 of the Land Settlement Law No* 29 of 1938 and to which exception was somewhat inadequately and half heartedly taken by H*B*M , s Embassy with the result that, as pointed out in your telegram No*T/i59 of April 3rd 1941, only a verbal assurance was obtained from the Iraqi Foreign minister to the effect that the shaikhs of I'ohamorrah and Kuwait would not in any way be affected by th© new axxendment* I suggest that the Iraq Government have not informed the President of the 10th Land Board that this particular amendment does not apply in the case of the properties of the shaikhs of Kohamorrah and Kuwait for as I have indicated in paragraph 4 of my letter No.C/889 of August 30th orders were passed recently by him alienating certain areas of the late Shaikh of Lohaoorrah estates which same within the category of reclaimed lands* I consider that this aspect of the problem should be put to H*B*M f s Embassy with all possible force and urgency and, should my contention prove on enquiry from ’Good by the Consul General Basra to be correct, they be asked to draw the Iraq Government's attention to the undertaking of the 29th Larch 1941 and to insist on immediate instructions Li:;plemeiflting that assurance being issued to the President of the 10th Land Board.

If Sir Henry Dobbs bad nob neglected to include the agreement a with the Shaiith of Kuwait and the Shaikh of Mohamorrah in his letter of the 20th March 1934 to the Prirae Minister of Iraq the Date Oarden case might never have arisen and His Majesty’s Government’s prestige would be as high as it ever was in the Persian GuljJ and His Highness 1 counsel would not have wandered from Iraqi Dourt to Iraqi Court, at consider able expense to their master* in their partially unsuccessful endeavours to defeat attempts by Iraqi subjects to wrest from the Shaikh lands which His Majesty’s Government guaranteed should remain in the possesaion of the heirs of his grandfather* The long years of correspondence on this distressing subject show that the Govei'nment of India have always realised that the interests of His Majesty’s Government and thdse of the Shaikh of Kuwait are in this particular instance mutual whereas the Embassy in Baghdad have failed to appreciate how very closely Ills Majesty’s Government are interested in these oases both ethically and financially* and that it should be their primary function to safeguard those interests by every iteans in their power* } Thompson’s letter gives the impression that the Embassy are not interested and ends up with &amp; reference to that phobia which too often seems to afflict our representatives in Baghdad when they are asked in the Interests of His Majesty’s Govern- raent or of those who enjoy the protection of that Government to bring pressure to bear on the Iraq Government to fulfill their international and moral obligations* Yours sincerely,'* - ■-y ':''- - ■- ' U ] V.

As a result of these interrogations I am inclined to the belief that the market was in fact built by the Port, or rather Coaster in his capacity as Dredging Superintendent, on land belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit outside the Port boundary as compensation for the cutting of date palms to permit of the road leading from Fao Depot out to the desert road being straightened. carried out before the work on the Keshla road was commenced. by Sheikh Mohamed and it would appear that the structure is undeniably the property of the Sheikh of Kov/eit, who presumably has the right to collect rental from users of it.

At discussion with Consul General Basra on 17th October, Political Agent Kuwait learnt that Andrew Weir &amp; Company have sold forward 1,850,000 cases to United Kingdom Food Controller, but are unable to purchase dates at a forward price which will show any profit and are therefore faced with a serious loss. It is understood that to force merchants to sell dates to Andrew Weir &amp; Company, Date Board have prohibited export of all packable dates. 3. Andrew Weir informed Consul General that although they do not require Shaikh’s Fao dates which a re of poor quality, they would object to relaxation of export prohi bition owing to effect on other growers. 4. Kuwait dhows, waiting at Fao to load essential date supply for Aden, are held up and if export permit is not granted, sailing season will have passed and Shaikh will be left with date crop on his hands. 5. as monopolists have never previously exer cised any control over Fao crops, and to prevent serious loss to Shaikh, grareful if Date Board could be urgently moved to relax prohibition in respect of Shaikh’s Fao estate.

I have interviewed Shaikh today November 12th and understand from him that his fellaheen at Mutawwa and Fadhagiah have undoubtedly smuggled a considerable quantity of dates to Persia. He states that he has been unable to prevent them and that the Iraqi Police have not taken adequate steps to stop the traffic. He, like the majority of date growers, has sold the reminder in Iraq but states his agent has not informed him of the buyer’s name. As regards Fao, smuggling by fellaheen has been going on and he has now sold some of his crop. • f 3. Shaikh gave me his word that he had taken no part in any smuggling operations nor had he acceded to a suggestion that some of his Fao crop should be smuggled to Kuwait. He states that to provide for his family’s needs he has ordered through the Saudi Ag^nt here 3£ tons of dates from Hassa. 4 * In past years Fao crop has been purchased by Abdul Latif al Hamad Brothers as monopolists refused to buy. I am informed that three dhows belonging to this firm who hoped again to purchase crop recently loaded with low grade dates Sayir and Derai at Fao as there * appeared to be no chance of permission being given to export better qualities and two dhows belong to the firm left here in ballast. 5• There is no doubt that whole sale smuggling has been taking place all along the 3hatt-al-Arab and many Kuwait dhows have obtained cargo/s on the Persian side for India etc. Dates have been brought here and loaded here for India etc. I am of the opinion that is Highness has had no hand in the smuggling but I agree that his conduct over his Mutawwa and Fadhagiah crops has like so many other growers not been fair to the monopolists. 6 * 1 am averse to suggesting to His Highness that he &lt;1% V’' should/should act as it is in my opinion incorrectly presumed in para 2 of the telegram under reference he is already doing and request that Ambassador he asked again to endeavour to obtain permission to import i of the 7ao crop.

SP^CIAX DECISION 3*3-- s - $2° ] HalDalDa al Chuneem, ^hose L^.vyer is Saiyed Hassan Vb&amp;ul Eahman, Gl^imed that she is to inherit a share of all the property left hy Shaikh Jahir the grand-father of Shaikh Muharrak, as she is the mother of Eatema, the wife of Mohammad who inherits Sahika hint Su'oah al Cahir, who is the sister of T,r uharrak as Suhah and that she has the shares pointed out by the letter No.140 dated the 12th Dhul Qada, 1360, given hy the Judge of Kuwait's Court, of all the property belonging to Sahika inherited from Shaikh Jahir and the Prohate Document sent along with the above mentioned letter, about the shares of Maza al Dawood, proving the heritage she asked for the Judgement to he in her favour and that her share he registered. Vbdul Jalil Partu the General Depty of the defendant, Shaikh \hned al Jahir as- Sub^h, Ruler of Kuwait, and all the other heirs, replied that Shaikh Jahir as-Subah, claimed hy the plaintiff, died more than a hundred yea~s ago, thus it is prohibited that this case he heard hy the Court, after such a long time, and the documents produced hy the Lawyer of the plaintiff are not to he'considered hy the Court as one of them does not hear any signature and * as all the papers have not been attested hy the authorities concerned. The defendant also rejects the claim that Mohammad, whom the plaintiff claim to have inherited her shares From, died before his wife, Eatima, the first legator, as it is claimed hy her, and not'afterher. He, the defendant requests that the plaintiff's claim he rejected. After hearing the case and sending the documents to the authorities concerned, the Committee received a copy of the memorandum sent hy the British Embassy under No.196 dated the 9th \pril, 1942, sent to us with the covering letter from the Deneral Land Settlement Department, under No.1640 dated the 25th April, 1942, stating that the document addressed to Ahmed as-Suhah dated 12th Dhul ^,ada, 1360 was actually given hy the Sharia Court of Kuwait, and was the signature of the Judge, this document is to be void and cancelled as anotner document, given hy the same Sharia Court on 2nd Dhul Hehha, 1360, to Ahmed al Ali as-3ubah, cancells the letter dated 12th Dhul Tada, 1360 and which is enclosed herewith. As to the second document of Probate, this is to he considered illegal, as it hears no signature, /hen the opponents were faced with the above mentioned facts, the Lawyer of the plaintiff then produced a document of legal division, given hy the Sannya Sharia Court of Basrah, under No.154 dated the 15th October, 1942, which is attached to this file. After listening to what the both parties had to say and vhich is written down in the/the document attached to this file, it tfas declared that, the pleading over. Owing to what is stat d aoove and after a close study and careful consideration the following facts rere found out:- was 1. The document dated 12th Bhul .^ada, l ( r 560 and the Prohate document were cancelled hy the other document given hy the same Jourt on 2nd Ohul Hejja, 1360 in which the Court' states that the previous document was void and should not depend on it, moreover the aforementioned Prohate document is without signature. -N 2. The legal document of division given hy the Sharia Court of Basrah under No.154 d-ted the 15th October, 1942 is not considered hy this committee as having a legal value, and the Committee cannot accept it owing to the existing dispute and that the defendant does not Know who is his real opponent in this case of how to prove the heritage, because the legator of the plaintiff died before his wife, Patima, who is the first legator, as it is made quite clear hy the contents of the last letter given hy the Sharia Court of Kuwait under No.143 dated 2 nd Dhul Hejja, 1360, in which the said Court instructions are, to wait for the final result of the investigation undertaken hy the Sharia Court of Kuwait. This shows that there is a case seen by the Sharia Court of Kuwait in this connection. It is, tnerefore necessary to wait until the last judgement is pronounced hy the said Court or to file another suit to prove the heritage hy the authorised Court. Owing to what is stated above the plaintiff could not prove her claim and the documents produced hy her were not having the complete legal stipulations and it was not proved that she maw have the property at her disposal. I therefore have decided that plaintiff's claim he rejected and she can refer to the Courts concerned to find out whether any judgement, proving the heritage has been given hy a Court concerned proving the heritage, even after the settlement is reached. This is liable to appeal in Court of appeal and Court of Tamyiz and is made known publicity. iGOVERNMENT OP INDIA. Department. MEMORANDUM.
