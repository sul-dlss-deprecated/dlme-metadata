Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department Delhi. Application re. civil suits from various residents in Duzdap. Sir, I have the honour to forward a copy of letter No.169, dated the 51st January 1926, fromH.B.M’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, with which he enclosed a copy of an application which he had received from some British Indian residents in Duzdap regarding certain civil suits which became time barred in the autumn of 1924. 2. I am of the opinion that, prior to the 11th August 1924 when Mr. Gould and Captain Smith were gazetted as Judicial Assistants under the Persian Coast a*nd Islands Order in Council, Duzdap, being geographically in Persian Baluchistan was within the limits of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council and that the nearest judicial officer possessing jurisdictibn v^as at Kerman. The applicants, hov/ever, state that Duzdap only became of importance in 1918 on account of the rail head, and it appears that from 1918 to 1924 cases were decided by panchayats , either from ignorance of the judicial officer’s existence at Kerman or from the disinclination of parties to bring suits in a distant court, which would necessarily be attended by considerable expense.3. I agree with Major Fisher that cases already decided by panchayat should he treated as cases decided by arbitration from which there should be no appeal, but as regards cases not so decided the criterion would seem to be whether the applicants could by exercising ordinary intelligence have ascertained that a court existed for them in Kerman and could have been expected to prosecute their cases there. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, I think that they have not made out any case for consideration; but I feel that, in the then disturbed state of Persia, it would not be reasonable to have expected all litigants to travel to Kerman for settlement of their claims, and to give them six months* grace to cover the first period after the appointment of the two judicial assistants, as suggested by Major Fisher, seems reasonable. The proposal, therefore, has my support. 4. I would propose to effect this result by issuing a King*s Regulation under Section 55(c) of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, should the Government of India be pleased to approve. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to H.B.M*s Consul for Sistan and Kain. I have, etc., Sd/- F.B.Pridea.ux, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.it is advisable and not inexpedient, that the Act should have retrospective effect from August 11th 1924 with the proviso that — as mentioned before, cases dealt with by Punchayat (arbitration) cannot be revived. If you accept this view it would seem necessary that a certain period of grace should be allowed for the presentation of cases which would ordinarily have been time-barred in the autumn of 1924, in view of the fact that litigants could not be expected to have immediate knowledge that judicial powers have been conferred on the Consular Officers concerned, and of the application of the Limitation Act to Duzdap. We therefore both recommend that six months grace should be allowed from the 11th August 1924 for the submission of claims ^fWU T v^ordinarily time-barred. This period may be considered to have ended on the 10th February 1925. This concession should not be applicable in cases which could r^C«\ . have been referred to and settled by other existing courts, as at Birjand and Sistan. If these proposals are accepted, I do not think any one will have cause to complain, and the number of fresh cases filed is not likely to be large.

But more definite information as to the procedure followed in the cases which were referred to such panchayats and the way in which and the extent to which effect has been given to their decisions will be required before this question can be finally decided. 4.

The procedure adopted at Duzdap for ti^Le trial of civil suits, prior to 1924 was as follows:- There v/ere three sub-Panchayats of each sect, and a general Panchayat composed of members from the Mohammedan, Hindu and Sikh community. Cases were heard in the first instance by tne sub-Panchayats and if no decision was arrived at the case went to the general Panchayat, whose opinion, with the approval of the Vice Consul was final, and I consider that cases so tried should not be again re-opened. I do not think there is any question of these decisions being disputed. There are no records of these cases in Duzdap and I am trying to ascertain if they have been sent to the Baluchistan Administration.

One Mahmud son of Ali, a Native of Aden, was charged and convicted under Sections 352 and 510 of the I.P.C. by Captain B.Stuart Horner, my Secretary, acting as District Magistrate, Bushire. 3. As the accused had been convicted of assault, and of being drunk and annoying people in a public place. Captain Stuart Horner considered that Mahmud who was constantly getting drunk was capable of making a repetition of a troublesome case which occurred in Tehran where a chauffeur ran over and killed a Persian, and he has therefore under Section 17(l) of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council prohibited Mahmud from being within the limits of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council for a period of 2 years.

It is howeve?orovidea that in these oir- -cumstances the procedure for the trial shall be that prescrioed for the trial of warrant cases by magistrates. The case of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon aocusea of murdering his wife was tried at Ahvaz by the Consul under K.R.3 of 191b. But as the regulationregulation was Invoked merely because the only magistrate available to commit the case had already taken a prominent part in its investigation,and was held not to be intended to deprive the accused of the benefits of a trial ✓^.oury tried the case in question with the aid of assessors instead of under the procedure for warrant cases. The High Court of Bombay,in hearing the appeal of the accused from sentence to death by the Ahwaz Courtanimadverted upon the departure from the procedure prescrioed in the King's Regulation,’suggesting that if the procedure is held to be faulty the Regulation should be amended'. The Political Resident in the Persian Hulf holds that the Regulation was intended to pres s' \ V -cribe procedure as for warrant cases in the circumstances envisaged only for that portion of the trial which leads up to what would be the committal stage in cases not governed by the Regulation. He recommends that the Regulation be amended so as to permit of trial by the Court sitting with assessors in serious cases of crime. The Government of India however consider that the n. S L C-a-* *-? strict wording of T/ .R.3 of 1916 should be followed^and procedure as for warr- -ant cases maintained throughout the trial. They state that the same procedure is in force in several parts of India.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India some extracts from judgments recorded by the High Court of Bombay in Confirmation Case Ho.13 of 1926 (Imperator vs.Mahamad Baksh Sheikh), relating to a point of procedure in a criminal case tried by H.M’s Consul, Ahwaz, in his capacity of Additional Sessions Judge under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in CounciZ, 1907. 2. The trial was held by Mr. Consul Monypenny under the authority of King’s Regulation No.3 of 1916 (copy enclosed), whereby he was empowered to take cognisance of the case without its being committed to him by a magistrate. The reason for this was that Capt. C.C.L. Ryan, H.M*s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, the only available magistrate who could conveniently have acted as Committing Magistrate, had taken a prominent part, in cooperation with the Persian Police, in the investigation of the crime and was therefore precluded from acting in a magisterial capacity. 3. The sole object with which the King’s Regulation in question was issued was to obviate the necessity for committal in cases where no committing magistrate was readily available. The Regulation lays down that in cases governed by it the procedure to be followed is that prescribed for the bi/fjal ofof v/arrant cases by magistrates. It would appear that this direction was meant to govern the procedure only for that portion of the tU/r\al leading up to what would be the committal stage/ in cases not governed by the Regulation; and that it was not intended that the accused should be deprived of the benefits of a trial by jury or with the aid of assessors. This, however, does not appear from the wording of the Regulation; hence the recommendation of Their Lordships of the High Court of Bombay that either the Regulation should be strictly followed or that it should be amended so as to allow the procedure prescribed for the tfeftal of sessions cases to be followed. 4. Under the Persia (Inland) order in Council, 1899, all serious cases of crime are tried by Provincial Courts with assessors ( vide Article 24a). I am inclined therefore to recommend that the same procedure be sanctioned for the Persian Coast and Islands by the amendment of King*s Regulation Ho.3 of 1916 to permit of the following of the procedure prescribed in section 268 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. Before addressing H.M* s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I solicit the views of the Government of India on this point. I have, etc., Sd/- F.B.Prideaux, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persiam Gulf.Extracts from Judgments recorded by the High Court in confirmation Case Ho.18 of 1926 (with appeal Ho.576 of 1926) in the case of Imperator vs. Mahamad Baksh Sheikh. 11th October 1926. Coram: Shah and Fawcett JJ. Per Fawcett Js - The appellant in this case, Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mohamad Baksh Sheikh, appeals from his conviction on a charge of murder of his wife at Ahwaz in the southern Khuzistan Province of Persia on the night of the 3rd or 4th March 1926. He was tried by the Consul of Ahwaz in his capacity of an Additional Sessions Judge under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907, with the aid of assessors, and has been sentenced to death. As pointed out in the judgment, held the trial was^Amder the authority of King* s Regulation Ho. 3 of 1916, whereby the Additional Sessions Judge was empowered to take cognizance of the case without having the case committed to him by a Magistrate. The Regulation says the procedure to be followed is that laid down in warrant casesj but under the direction of the Consul General he held the trial with the Assessors, so that the procedure has to a certain extent conformed to that followed in Sessions cases. XX X X Before leaving the case there are a few points of procedure upon which I wish to make a few remarks. First as regards the trial with the aid of the Assessors. Ho doubt this was done in the interests of the defence, and with a view to conform with the law in India. On the other hand, the fact remains that the particular Regulation Ho.3 of 1916, which allows a Session trial without committal by a Magistrate, distinctly states that the Court shall follow the procedure prescribed for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates. To mix up this procedure with the procedure for trials by Sessions Court is a course that may lead to difficulties in future cases. It seems to me tnat either the Regulation should be strictly followed or that it shouldt \ should he amended so as to allow the procedure prescribed for Sessions cases to be followed, or to provide for some modification of the procedure prescribed for the trial of Warrant Cases. Certainly in the present case the Assessors* opinions have not been helpful to us. But of course that is not a reason for saying that such trials should never be with Assessors; and if the authorities think that it is better to have the aid of Assessors, then proper provision should be made by altering the Regulation in question. x x xx Per Shah Js % * * As regards the procedure, I desire to refer to the terms of the King* Regulation No.3 of 1916 made under Section 55(c) and 56(4) of the Persian Coast arid Islands Order in Council, 1907. It provides expressly that when His Britannic Majesty*s Consul General, as Sessions Judge, and the Judicial Assistant, as an Additional Sessions Judge, takes cognizance of a case without the accused being committed to him by a Magistrate, the procedure to be followed shall be the procedure for the t(i/iial of warrant cases by Magistrates. That is a definite provision; and the association of Assessors at the trial according to that procedure may leadjto difficulties and may at times prove fatal to the validity of a trial. It is desirable, therefore, that either the procedure prescribed should be followjcl as directed by the Regulation, or if it^ is considered desirable to permit procedure such as has been followed in this case, a fresh Regulation may be passed or that the existing Regulation may be amended in that sense. xxxKing*s Regulation under Section 55(c) and 56(4) of the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council 1907.

JJakhtiari, Kuhgilu and ^sht-i-Kuh areas within the scope of the Persian Coast and Islands order. ^ In 1912 the Persian Coast and Islands Order was amended so as to brinrt Arabiatan, Pars, haristan and Kerman vri thin the scope of the Order, and in this connection I have the honour to invite a reference to oir P, cox’s letter i«o.527, dated 5th March 1911, in which the reasons and necessity for the Inclusion of these orovinoea waa fully set forth. The reasons which then required the inclusion of Arabistan are now equally conclusive for the inclusion of Bakhtiari, Pusht-i-Kuh, and Kuh'ilu. In the first two of these the &lt;jvtlo-Per8ian Oil Company are actually working and it ia probable th*it their operations may be extended to the third. 3 isince the amendment of the order in Council the Vice- Consul at ;0iwaz was made a Judicial Assistant to the Political Resident and Consul-General with a view to dealing Judicially with criminal and civil cases oraon# British subjects in hia political jurisdiction. Put as a matter of fact the oil fields at .iaindan-i-Haftun which are within his district and ^number of Briti s h subj ect^ in it, are in Bakhtiari country which include the lur'eat£and outside the limit of Arabistan. It is evident, therefore, that strictly speaking Hia Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, )ias no jurisdiction over British subjects in the oil fields nor over those in Pusht-l-Kuh. This state of affairs is open to serious objection, as at any moment an Indian| an In '' ,1 * ui fpora th « oil field* brouisht before nis Hajonty’e f vormul tor trial .’iljjht raise tlie question of the Court’s | !ui ’ iL!dl otion with unfortunate results, it would obviously f be exceedingly troublesone and inconvenient to have to send employees of the AnRlo-i’ersian Gil Corapany for trial to Isfahan under the Persian Order in Council 1389 (compare sir p. cox’e latter above referred to) and the obvious remedy appears to to bring Uakhtiari and other territories in which the anglo-Perslan Oil company are interested within the sphere of the Peraia?! Ooaat an i I«lanr!s. Hr i ' h3 Political iteeident in the Persian &gt;/ulf is also Gor.oul-jenerai - or .'ars, Khuzistan. Laristan and the district of Lin »h, and the Coast and Islands of the Persian *** r.ulf being in the dominion of Persia, so the suggestion made by the General iian«ger, ^glo-Persian oil company, to substitute 'Khuzistan' forMrabistan' in the third paragraoh of Article 1 in the Persian Coast ar.d Islands (Amendment) Order in Coui lC il 1G1B, which would then read 'Xho terra ’the maritime provinces of P rsia' means the provinces of Khuzistan, Fare, Lariatan....* appears sound. 3 : ' :hua ' latan Is the name of the old Persian Province which embraced the present province of Arabistan and Luriatan and as a portion of Arabistan borders x» on the Persian Gulf from the Ghat-el-Arab to the nel^tourhood of Bunder DUura, I nreaume the whole province nay luotifiably he classed as maritime. Khuzistan according to the map published by Muhammad Giza ibn Marhum Hasan All Khan Qaradaghi Published in Teheran i-n 1396 under the patronage of the '■ inlster/of War, include Arabistan, Laristan (both Pusht-i-puh and Pi.h-l-Kuh) and liakhtlarl. ) If it is necessary to give a definition of Khuzistan it might be defined thus:- » ’ichuzietan* includes the present Province of .irablstan and Laristan and the Bakhtiarl country'. ^ At ths nr ' ,B,,nt Uraa Hehbehan and the Kuhgilu oo.intry areare adialniatered 'by the jiftJchtiaria and would thus presumably be Included in this definition; fron time irameiaorial till a few years ago, however, they were both included in i^are, and were so included when the Keeldent at bushire was made Consul-General for Fare. I think, therefore, that if the above amendment is made the Kuhgilu country will certainly be included in the snhere of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council.?roaia Copy, Jurisdiction of Courto estHblished under the orders in Counoil 'Sr* for ooimeut and action. no, 3o/5ae of mi.

In my letter no: 462 of the 26th February 1911. I asked leave to deal with this question in a separate eommunioation. and now beg to submit my observations. 2 . It will be convenient in the first plaoe to consider the boundaries of Courts formally established under the Persia Order in Council, which fall within the sphere of this Residency. They are two in number and are established at hohammerah and ^hwas respectively, while ills Majesty's Consul- General at Bushire holds a king's Commission as consul-General i for Fare. Chuzistan and Laris tan and the district of Lingah inoludos Axablstan: and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the dominions of Barela* no Provincial Court.;ourt # however, has been eotablisheu under the Bersla urder in Council, at Bushire. Sirailarly, no Provincial Court exiats at iCazman, whioh is within the sphere of this Eesidenoy, nor at ahiras, 3. Hie Majesty's noe-Consul at Mohaoiaorah was authorised in Minister to Resident. ^o:32 dated: 1892 to hold a consular Court 29th liovember 1692 3 — — at Mohameeterah 'in and for his distriot &lt; ' under the Persia order in Council. In 190$ His Majesty's Vice-consul for Arab Is tan was authorised (1) Minister to Resident, Telegram ho:: to hold a Provincial Court 32 dated 25th February, 1906* : (2) Resident to Foreign. lio:474 dated s 'in and for Arab! a tan 1 ' under 3rd February 1906. : — the Persia order in Council. The two courts thus have at present independent and concurrent jurisdiction in the province of jurabistan. Incidentally I would observe here that as the result of the developments which have taicen place in Mohammerah territory during the last 2 years, this arrangement has been found to need revision, and suggestions in that direction have been made in my letter ho; 462 of 26th February 1911 above cited. 4* Three Con ular Courts are established under the Persian Coasts Order in Counoil 1907; at Bushire, Lingah. and Bandar Abbas respectively; whilst at Jashk and Chorbar the Director of the Persian Oulf Telegraphs exercises jurisdiction under the super- in tendance of the Resident and Consul General. I will deal with each of these Courts seriatim. 5* BUSHXRH. The judicial jurisdiction of the Resident and Art.2. The limits of this order are the Coast and : Consul-General Islands of the I'erslan Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, : and his judicial adjacent to the said Coast and islands. : Assistant at ^ara: 3 . 'inland Persia' means the territories and : dominions of the ahah of Persia so fax as are not : Bushire, is included within the limits of this order. : ————————— exercisable withinr o within tiio liiaita of tho Order as at present defined in paragraph 2 thereof. This definition, however, is obviously an unsatisfaotory one, as quoetion arises whether any place is or is not within the ^orsian coast and Islands for the purposes of this order, it shall he referred to the Consul-General, and a certifioate under his hand and seal shall he oonolusive on the question and shall he taken judicial notice of by the uigh Court of Bombay and by any Court established under this Order. the word 'Coast' is nomhBTe defined. and it is apparently left to the Consul General to determine, in any particular oavse under Article 62 of the order, whether a place is or is not within his jurisdiction. It may be mentioned that the Law Officers of the Crown recommended * India office to Government of India dated : in 1878 that! 19th September 1878. . —— — — — the word Coast'’ should be defined, but this appears to have been considered unnecessary. 6 * Ml&amp;AE.

It will be seen from the foregoing summery that under existing -s provisions whilst the Bolitioal fcasident in the Persian Gulf and his first Assistant have judicial powers over the whole of the Persian W Coast v from the mouth of the :&gt;hatt-al-**reb to aitettar Bay# the limits of the judioial powers of the Assistant Kesldents at l»ingah and Bandai Abbas only extend, along the ooast, to the Eastern boundary of the .linab district (which touches the sea between £larat and Bandaraa). fhe tract between the latter boundary and JashJc holograph station comprising the district of Blyaban and a snail strip of the Jashic district# forms &amp; hiatus, in which no judioial officer subordinate to the Hesidenoy exercises jurisdiction. from Jashfc to Charbar the pireotor of torslan Gulf telegraphs dees exercise judicial powers, but only within the local limits of the telegraph stations at taose ports and along the alignment of the telegraph line connecting them. 10. bo Provincial courts have been established fer the Consul ates at ican&amp;an and Shiraz, and consequently were the incumbents of these posts to take judicial action under either Order in Council their powers might be called into question. fhe fact is, as an examination of the definitions figuring at i the commencement of the two Orders will demonstrate, that no precise boundary between them has been laid down; and under present conditions while Els Majesty's Consuls at Shiraz and Canaan exercise no specific ■ judioial powers within their spheres It would at the same time seem to be an undue strain on the Interpretation of the Coast and Islands Order in Council, as at present worded, to claim for the Consul- General at Bushlre jurisdiction under that urder, either in the hinterland of the maritime provinces of fare. Laris tan and Lingah (which are covered by his Commission); or in Borman and Dependencies {Including Persian B luehistan and Meioran) which have always been in his sphere as Resident but are not provided for in his consular CommissionCoualsalon* Cozaalsalon* It may be mentioned here In passing that the —v oonvenienoo jz the inclusion In the latter instrument of Kafntaxi and Dependencies as well of Arable tan, was suggested by Colonel kobo in Appendix l ot hla letter ho: 13 dated Idth January 1879 to the QOTerwaent of India when discussing the draft order* 11* Jhus t haring regard to the fact that only offences ooianiitfed within the limits of the Order in Council und r which e particular court has been ocnstltuted* can be tried in that Court, and that in consequence parts of Persia beyond the limits of one order are treated for judlolal purposee as foreign territory by Courts established unde* that Order, the position is plainly one that may at any time lead to grave inconvenience* For example; At present a person deported from ilaria&amp;n to jiombay could return to Bus hire or Bandar Abbas with impunity; again, property in barman could not be distrained in exeoution of a degree passed in the Court at Bandar Abbas, unless proceedings were commenced afresh in Zarmn* IB* A consideration of the foregoing review of our Judicial position in southern Persia under the two orders in Council can scarcely result in any conclusion but that the state of affairs is defective and unsatisfactory and demands readjustment; but before venturing to na*e any proposals in the latter direction, it will be convenient if X examine the circumstances which gave rise to the present jrder in Council and the motives which actuated its authors. 18* in 1866 the Foreign office instructed Mr* Bogies, then the Judge and Consul ~Oeneral at Constantinople, to pro par o the draft of a Foreign Jurisdiction order in Council for ctreln, and forwarded to him a tentative draft drawn up by their Law officers for the whole of that country. Xhe Foreign office having proposed that the Resident at Bus hi re should ooumiunloate with hr. Logies, the then Besldent colonel ?elly f diu oo by letter on tiie 3rd October 1866* This letter contemplated that@ ’ that the arran^omente for the littoral of the Gulf should he diatinot Acorn those for the interior. Oorreepondenoe on the sutojeot oontinoed for ten years and in ld77 Lord Salisbury in avpespatoh dated 11th April stated that he entertained no doubt that Her Majesty had extra territorial jurisdiotion in iteraia, oapeoially in the Gulf. He suggested that in lieu of an order in lounoll applying to the whole of aersia an order should in the first instance be issued applying to the Persian shore of the Gulf only and ‘*not assuming more jurisdiction than was permitted, but going to the undoubted extent of that jurisdiction'. In order to enable the Heal dent and his Assistants to deal diplomatically with oaseo where necessary he considered it essential that the Eesldent at Bushlre, his two Assistants and Uncorenanted Assistant should be commissioned as Consul-General consuls and Vice- Consul. At that timo His Uajesty's Government was represented in the Persian Gulf by the Political Resident at Bush ire with his staff and by a Political Agent at Masfcat. There were no Consular officers at Zermanshah, Shir as, Mohammerah, Ispahan, Kerman or elsewhere in Central and southern Persia, as at present. 14. After furrier correspond :nee it was determined that the judicial functions of the officers in the Gulf should be disconnected from their Consular powers; and that the Foreign Jurisdiction order should be worked by Judicial Commissioners having concurrent jurisdiction over the whole territory comprised in the Order, and nominated by the Governor General in India, subject to the approval of the secretary of state for India in Counoil. It was further decided that the Healdant at Bushire should at once be commissioned as Consul General for the province of Fare and the Persian Coast and Islands, the question of Consular powers for his subordinates standing ove^pending suggestions from the Government of India, AS@&gt;l; A* wtia pointed out In a Memorandum by Hr. J?* a.He illy, apparently one of the Lae uffioers of the Or own, the order differed considerably 1. general oharaoter from other Foreign Jurisdiction orders• This difference arose, he said, mainly from the nature of the official position of the Officers by shorn the order was to be worhed, whose subordination was not to the Im -erial Oovernmont but to the Government of India. Further oorrea Kmdenoe on points of detail followed and it was /ftw 7 not until 1869 that the Order in Council for the eeraian Coasts and Islands was issued, simultaneously with one for £ersia. The former Order underwent revision in 1907, but its special oimraoteristics remained substantially uxnJLtereu, IS. Meanwhile, in the years 1903-1906, political exigencies lea to the establishment of Consulates or Vice-Consulates at Jfermonshnh, Ahwaz, Shlras, Karmen and Bandar Abbas; to these was aaaed in 1909 a Vioe-Consulate at Lingah. The question of ju&amp;ioial powers for our officers at Bandar Abbas and Lingah was dealt with soon after tho establishment of those posts, but the judicial necessities of the Consulates at .Carman and Shiraz seem to have been overlooked. 16* The further recommendation which I now venture to make in continuation of that submitted in my letter BO: 462 above quoted with the object of consolidating and regularising our judicial position in Southern Persia, is that the limits of the Persian coast and Islands Order in Council be laid down in section 2 of the Order as, ^ohammerah with its dependencies; the Coast and maritime provinces of Persia from liohammerah to Owettar both inclusive and the Islands of the Arslan Gulf and Gulf of Oman, being within the dominions of his Majesty the Bhah of Persia, % Including the territorial waters of i*erai&amp; adjacent to the said Coast and Islands 19 • Maritime'Earltime provimBB' might be dafined in section 3 as the 0 provinces ot nrobiotan. Furs, Laristan, Zan&amp;an 9 ersian Baluchistan and those districts by custom and tor the time being included under the authority o£ the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports. IV. v&gt;uoh an alteration would enable His U&amp;jesty's .Consul at iC&amp;man, on being duly empowered under the Order, to take cognisance of all oifenoes ooimaitted within his consular jurisdiction and to dispose oi them according to Indian Law, with which he is of necessity familiar. It wo Consul at Bandar uld correlate his Abbas and of the ] on with that of the * Persian Gulf jtel&amp;gr&amp;nhs and greatly sickly judicial proceedings in any case which might arise entailing refer: noe from one to the other. it would have the i additional advantage of bringing into force in Persian Baluchistan a code of law similar to that in force in British Baluchistan, thus making joint judicial action between our political officers on either side of the frontier easier than hitherto. It would enable Hi a j!ajesty f s Consul-General for Fara to take judioial cognisance of all offences committed within his consular jurisdiction, and would place under his judicial control those Consulates now administratively within his sphere. It would further secure that officers of the Government of md l* would administer justice in accordance with Indian Oodos, the latter being, it will be generally admitted, more suitable to conditions obtaining in ’Persia, and particularly in southern torila, than the somewhat complicate* system indicated in the Pereia order in Council. 18. fhe position of the Bhlraz Consulate is already anomalous as that centre is the capital of Furs of which the Hesid nt at Buahire is Consul-General and is his summer Residence; experience has shown, moreover, that it would In practice be highly inocnv&amp;nient and detrimentalAv Octrinetital to die public oervloe to divoro© the Politloal Hooiaeat la Me Berol^i aylf froc Judicial md Omoular authority la Faro# ‘lido ancaaly* will act# it 1© truo&gt; bo removed etiould the propoealo wiiioii 1 have detailed above ocosoad thonoolveo to the Qq&amp;tammt of India md die uajoaty’o 4niotor&gt; for the Persian Oooet and Xelaads Order ia oomcil will then apply to the whole of lore# 4*ere ia oo reoaca* however, why this Should be a source of oobarroaeDoat to &amp;io -iajoety f o Ocaoul at that plc-co* do Oaioulor Offlcere eaerdoe Judicial fuuoticao ia Poraia under the Persiai order ia Oouacil ualeae the Provlacial Court has boon opocifically established ia and for flho district to ^ioh they are appointed* do ouch Court has bom established at Shiraz and in cconcn with Eic Oa3eoty , e Ccaouls at Kornooshah and Rarwn, Uie loch of Judicial powers involved by the aaioeion eoeras in ao way to have troubled ouccecsivo lacunbeats, since the post was created b yoarw ago* xher© would oeeca iio objectioa, therefore, to His Majesty 1 s Caioul at bhlras remaining witljout specific JudiBial pouore under with/order* Petty casee cai bo disposed of by hia without recourse to the nachiaory of an order In council; vdiile noro serious oases ho will doubtless prefer to remit to oushiro for disposal by the iteeideat md coiguI-k; moral who is more conveniently placed to alooet tail© up ouch cocos (which, it nay be safely assumed, would^c.! . c caicom British Xndiais) and can said convicted persons to India to servo their sentences in Jail, or deport them, should either course appear necessary* IS.
