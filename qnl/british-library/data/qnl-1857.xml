In discussion with the Director of Health, however, it has emerged that the main reason for isolation of Koweit and Bahrein from Iraq is fear that travellers may leak through from Egypt without under going quarantine. Director quoted an actual case of two American Oil Company employees who went to Koweit from Egypt by air (he thinks by Middle East Air Lines machine), stayed there 'a day or two' and then flew on to Bagdad where they did not reveal that they had recently been in Egypt and stayed at an hotel in quarantine. 3. If I can give a formal assurance that there will be no leakage from Egypt into Iraq via Koweit or Bahrein I may well be able to appeal to Iraqis to reconsider present vexatious regulations.
