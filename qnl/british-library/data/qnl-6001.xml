BAGDAD. 22nd iJovember, 1935* My dear George, In our letter of the 14th April (363/2/37) to Eastern department, we warned you that the Iraqi Government were once more asking us to give an answer to their question as to the date 0 f the institution 0 f Bahraini and Kuwaiti nationality (originally raised in October, 1933). 2. As you know, some uncertainty was felt at first as to why the Iraqi Government wanted this information, but it is now fairly clear that the point is being pressed in connec tion with cur endeavours to establish the exclusive Bahraini nationality of several men who have been, or are likely to be, called up for military service ^see correspondence ending with our despatch A T 0 .439 of the 28th October). 3. We now learn from Edmonds that the Iraqi departmental experts are disposed to take the liue that Bahrain, as well as Kuwait, was not filially tletacned from the Ottoman Empire until the date of the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne and that, in consequence, the inhabitants of both territories if come within the scope of Article 3 cf the Nationality Law (of 1924), whereby former Ottoman subjects, habitually resident in this country, are declared to have acquired Iraqi nationality on the 6th August, 1924. 4. As you know, we have hitherto avoided entering into detailed discussion of this complicated matter by adopting the tactics approved in your despatch No.119 (E 762/762/91) of the 7th i 1 e bruary, 1935, but it now seems clear that if W.Hendel,Esq. t OIG, we / OOPY 3E TO INDIA,-2 we are to save from conscription Bahrainis of the type of those on whose behalf we have already intervened, we roust produce arguments to destroy the thesis on which the Iraqis base their arguments (indicated in paragraph 3 above)* 5* In your despatch i«o*865 (B 7 283/1527/91) of the 13th December 1934, you supplied us with arguments which we were to use in the event of its ultimately proving necessary to reply to the enquiry originally addressed to us by the Iraqis in October 1933* We cannot help feeling, however, that the Iraqis are almost certain to know of the reference to Bahrain contained in the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913, which, they will contend, provides evidence that Turkish sovereignty then existed over that island and that, as the agreement was never ratified, that sovereignty persisted until the date of the Treaty of Lausanne* We should like to know whether the Legal Advisers can meet this point or can in any other way strengthen the abovementioned arguments which, we fear t may not convince the Iraqis as they stand* 6* We are not unmindful of the fact that, as stated in paragraph 1 of the same despatch, you would prefer, owing to the delicate and debatable points involved, not to enter into a controversy on this matter at all, but I fear that unless we do so we must give up all idea of saving .'iahrainis resident in Iraq from conscription* On the other hand, it is clearly worse than useless to try and save them by means of arguments which will not convince the Iraqis* 7. A further difficulty has been suggested by D r ower, who points out that Article 1 of the old Ottoman Law ol -Nation ality, v/hich was passed in 1869, aadt 80 f ar as aware. still in force in 1924, says simply that the child of an .

Dear Morgan* In paragraphs 5 and 7 of his letter 363/5/37 of the 22nd November to Hendel in regard to the question of Bahraini nationality the -ambassador raised two points on which we sought the views of the Legal ndviaers. I am sorry there has been some delay in sending a reply* 2* With regard t 0 the first point viz. that the Iraqi Government might contend that the Turkish reference to Bahrain contained in the 1913 Anglo-Turkish convention provides evidence that Turkish sovereignty then existed over the island, and that* as the agreement was never ratified* the said sovereignty persisted until the date of the Treaty oi Lausanne* our views are as set out in paragraph 3 of Foreign Office despatch 3:Jo.865 of the 13th December 1934. The argument that the 1913 convention was never ratified may to some extent be answered by pointing out that that convention is referred to in no uncertain terms in Article 3 of the 19i4 Auglo_Turkish convention which was ratified. But the substance of our contention is that the i't 13 convention was* or would have been* in this respect no more than a formal acquiescence by the Ottoman Empire in an already exi sting position jiuridioal and practical. 3. With regard to the difficulty suggested by Dpower, this argument* which we admit is ingenious* only seems to be valid on the supposition that Bahrain was an Ottoman possession at the time the 1869 Ottoman .atlonality Law came into force. 4.

Cox’s despatches No.876 of the 19th of December and Nos.874 and 877 of the 20th December regarding the settlement of the Iraq-Nejd, Iraq-Koweit and Nejd-Koweit boundaries, and to inform you that I approve the proposals made in the tv/o last mentioned despatches. 2. With regard to despatch No.876, your proposals relating to the Iraq-Neju frontier also are approved, subject to rectification of a small mistake which occurs in the concluding sentence of the second paragraph of Protocol No. 1. The words ’’Latitude 32 East” should read 'latitude 32 north” and, similarly, ’’Longitude 30 north” should read ’’longitude 39 east”. 3. When finally signed, two certified trans- \ lations of the above agreements should be forv/arded to me. One is for record in this Department; the other would be transmitted to the Foreign Office, in view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government are to some extent responsible both for Iraq and for Koweit.

'i r O / I ’••f- f ,«*l « i The Residency Q£J I Baghdad, the 20th December, 1922* J My Lord Duke, With reference to my two subsequent despatches dealing provisionally with the Iraq-Ha^d and Kuwait-Kajd frontiers, it would be convenient if we could at the same time arrive at a decision as to the frontier which we can advisedly recognise as between Iraq and Kuwait. I have the honour to suggest for the consideration of His Majesty^ Oovemment that it would be reasonable for us to consider that the said frontier should start in the South from the point on the green line of the jjaglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July, 1913, where the Wadi-el-Audja intersects with the Batin, and from thence follow the said green line along the Batin to its termination at the mouth of the Khor Zubier Just South of Jebel Sanam Safwan and Um-' V asr, leaving them to Iraq. I shall be glad to be informed whether the proposition meets the views of His Majesty’s Government. I may mention that the question of the Iraq-Kuwait frontier has not hitherto been x*aised by King Faisal or his iroverament and they will presumably accept our decision in regard thereto.

(V? ) j My dear Peterson, In his letter 210/3/3b of the &amp;dth February to Lacy Baggallay Morgan suggested a possible line of defence for use in the event of tne Iraqi Government returning to the charge about the date of inception of Kuwaiti nationality. 2. While Morgan*s suggested reply might serve its purpose, we think that on the whole it is better not to mention to the Iraqi Government our apprehensions about the possible revival of capitulatory rights. 3. For tne reasons explained in paragraph 2 of * Foreign Office despatch No.ttbo of the 13th December, 1934, our main anxiety in the past has been lest some foreign Power (e.g.the United States of America^) might make a claim to such a revival. But we feel that with the passing of time it is now really too late for the United States or any other Government to make such a claim. 4* If therefore the matter is again raised by the Iraqi Government we think there is no longer any reason why you should not reply as suggested in the relevant part of paragraph b of tne Foreign Office despatch referred to above. b. There is one other point I might mention here. A Baghdad despatch No.73 of the 2tith February enclosed the Embassy* s Sir Maurice Peterson, K.C.M.G., Bagdad.-3- Ottoman father is an Ottoiuan subject. This is subject to no qualification so that, eren had Bahrain been an independ- ent State for many years previously, a native cf Bahrain inigiit be possessed of Ottoman nationality passed on to him in the direct male line from an ancestor some vjay back. I wonder whether the Lethal Advisers can fi uu ax.y f lav; in that ar^ume.nt ? Yours ever, as. A. 0.K.HHMH -3- Is that His 3iajeaty f 3 Goverment have been in treaty relations with the Shaikhs of Bahrain as independent Hulers, since 1820 and that therefore an uttoman municipal Law of 1869 could not apply to Bahrain. 5. Of course it might be possible for an individual Bahraini, like an individual British subject or American citizen, to possess an Ottoman ancestor with the result that Ottoman law would have regarded him as an Ottoman subject, and if such a person were established in Iraq at the material date, this might conceivably have the effect of turning him into an Iraqi citizen, though the -point would be rather a delicate one. But this provision of Turkish lew does not really help the Iraqi Government unless they are in a position to show that all Bahrainis were at some sufficiently recent time ipso facto Ottoman subjects, and the point is really, therefore, the same as that raised in paragraph 5 of Clark Kerr’s letter. Yours ever sci. Lacy Baggallay. /— r (3 dritiah ^3ba»ay # Bagiod* 19th April, I9d8.
