Also discussed are the following: the impact of British, German, and Italian broadcasts; fears of Russian aggression among the official classes in Afghanistan; the British Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) approach to reporting British naval losses early on in the war; the extent of anti-British feeling among the various classes in Bahrain; the Italian bombing of Bahrain in October 1940; food shortages in the Persian Gulf.There are no reports from Kabul dating from after September 1940. The reports from the Political Resident continue until April 1945, but they become more and more brief from 1941 onwards, and during the final three years of the war consist of no more than a couple of lines.Other notable correspondents besides the Political Resident and the Minister in Kabul include representatives of the British Broadcasting Corporation and officials of the Ministry of Information, the India Office, and the Government of India.The file includes three dividers which give the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence (folios 2-4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Information</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Broadcasting Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public opinion</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00005f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00005f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00005f#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
