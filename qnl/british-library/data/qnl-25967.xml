I have now had a letter from Caroe pere, saying that he wrote privately both to Bullard and Clark Kerr, and that the former has replied saying that the two Ambassadors got the letters when they were in Moscow together, and compared notes about it. They had agreed that Michael should be advised to go to Moscow rather than Tehran, and Clark Kerr ted intended to write to this effect but for obvious reasons he has not yet been able to do so. Caroe asked me whether you could possibly let me krow bethel there is apy farther step which could be taken or anyone else who should be consulted. Moscow or Tehran. Yours sinoerely # R.E. Barclay, Baq, Personnel Department, Foreign Office, i—■■■■■■■■■I I mm answering three letters of yours to say that I have sent off your telegrssi to Cunninghasi about Keyes * and return herewith the original telegroa to #hich t is is a reply* I enclose a copy of the Royal Instrument of Instructions to the Governor of the llorth West Frontier Province5 you will see that Article WT A. deals with the tri al areas. As regards the Provincial elections, I understand that the reason you have not heard before from Joyce, is that the results are not expected to be received until the middle of February. I have written to Barclay about Michael going as Honorary Attache to Moscow, I do not know Frank Roberts ayaelf, and I suppose that Clark Karr’s departure may mean that they will have to wait to consult the new Ambassador when he is appointed so I suppose that there may be some further delay. I am gi to see that both Ambassadors confirmed the vlew^ Jaich we held here, that Moscow would be preferable to Tehran for him. Tours sincerely. Blackburn Lancs.DEPTL.

Decisions such as this without prior consultation make things difficult,, and I have some anxiety over thinness of Frontier cadre. As things are, it is better for me to refrain from making alternative proposal now for filling Chief Secretary’s post, and I prefer to leave de la Fargue where he is un£il I have had time to look round. 3. I think Jardine should be asked how he feels about coming to Peshawar as Revenue Commissioner # He c^n be tolp tha^ Cunningham proposed him and I hhouid be very glad indeed to have him. He may well prefer this to working under his junior in Quetta. Grateful if you will let me know his reaction. &lt; s' 4.

I an sorry to see that this is unsatisfactory from your point of view, at least so far as Crichton is concerned. I see also that they ask for f rther views about the Chief Secretary, and I expect you will want to add oonething about Jar dine. We have been very busijr this last week with preparations for the Assenbly Debate on the Use of Indian Troops in Java, but I managed to ^et over to the Central Hall yesterday afternoon to hear Hu&amp;aliar nake his speech. It was very difficult to hear, but it was delivered with extrene fluency and effect, and was very warmly rec&lt; ived. X think there is a very good chance of hin being elected Chaim n of the Economic and Social Council, and he has secured the Viceroy* s consent to his accepting if elected. There also seems to be a good chance of Zafmlla getting a seat on the Pernrnent Court, and if thkm elections come off, they will be a considerable f©other in India’s cap. Yours sincerely.

Crici ton.- Y our 2o/ .Case has bean re-submitted to Hi. Excellency, who ,hile fully a'ppreclai ing your reasons for requesting recor sideration, Is not able L to reverse his orders, principal factors in reaching this decision are (1) increasing temp and complexity of problems to be dealt within Department of External Affairs, including constitutional and organ .saticnal problems resulting from expected advance -in political field: ( 2) difficulty &gt;f finding substitute of appropriate ieni^rity, experience and achievement to be able t.o officiat e as Foreign Secretary when I take leave in course of 1946 r early. 1947; (3; importance of dovetailing experience of top ranking officers in Department of External Affairs. 3 1 You wil3 know how much 1 personally regret inability te support you in this matter.

I had discussed Crichton’s appointment as Chief Secretary with himself and yoi.^ and also with Squire, and had regarded it as more or less decided. I feel strongly that Weightman should have consulted me before proposing these alternative arrangements and trftfcfc. all due respect must askyH.E’s reconsideration on the following grounds. 3. N.W.F.P. cadre is in process of getting thin^ and I had been counting on Crichton and Shah toxreinforce it. Both these are now x proposed for other destinations just at the moment when^on arrival of new Governor, Dundas is going on leave (possibly not to return) and when St John,Governor's Secretary, is also leaving* With new Governor’s Secretary I shall stand in special need of best available incumbent in Chief Secretary’s post to help me over early difficulties. Of those proposed by you, $A.a Bring has only just gone to BteofeMfts as D.C. - another key post - and must stay there. Cox would noty in my judgement do at all, and Curtis, admirable though he is, does not shine in Secretariat work. With my knowledge of both E.A.D. and Province I have no doubt that ChiefSecreuary , s x post in this period will he more important than that of Joint Secretary E.A.D. Although this is minor point, Crichton, as I think you know, would be happier in Peshawar appointment. 4. Before I ^.eft I stressed unwisdom of cutting down N.W.F.P. overmuch to meet other demands, and should wish to reiterate that warning.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000161_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1124</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000161</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1124</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 457/46 'Sir O.
