The cost of dismantling and disposal of the track resulted in a loss, and the majority of the correspondence concerns the apportionment of the loss between the Government of India and Her Majesty's Government.The correspondence ends with the Secretary of State for India concluding that a claim cannot be preferred against the Government, due to the
                           Agreement between the Secretary of State for India in Council and the Secretary of State for War (Acting also for the Minister of Pensions) for the Final Settlement of Charges arising out of the Great War and of Certain other Expenditure(1931), known as 'Memorandum C', a copy of which is included at folios 7-22.The file also contains correspondence with F B Blackie, who makes an offer to purchase light railway track from Aden. He is informed that the track has been sold, and is invited to purchase materials from the Burma Railway, consisting of approximately 5000 tons of 41 quarter-pound rails.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Railway Department (Railway Board)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003b8#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003b8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
