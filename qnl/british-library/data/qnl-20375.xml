It never entered my head that Bahrain should take action without receiving instructions from you, hut it seemed to me that time and trouble would be saved if he were in possession of the draft message, as you could then, upon receiving Colonial Office sanction, merely tell him to despatch the message which he would presumably have already translated and prepared for despatch. Incidentally a precisely similar procedure was laid down by the Colonial Office in January 1926, when they instructed me to repeat to Jiddah, for convenience, messages the despatch of which through Jiddah I was suggesting to them. It seams to me important to save even a day's delay in communicating with Ibn Sa'ud at the present .■juncture, and the procedure which I adopted appeared likely to help to this end. I had of course no idea of issuing instructions to an officer subordinate to you, nor of appearing to suggest that the Colonial Off ic e-2- Office might to do so. However, if you dislike the procedure, there i 3 no more to be said, and I will discontinue it. JV-t The Hon 1 ble Lieutenant-Colonel L.B.H. Haworth, .

With reference to my telegram No. 18, dated the 11th February 1928, I have the honour to forward for the information of His Majesty's Govern ment a copy of memorandum No. 67-S., dated 7th February 1928, from the Political Agent at Kuwait, giving details of the Akhwan raid on Kuwait on the 27th January and of its defeat by a Kuwait force which pursued the raiders by car. It was on realising the success of this defence with the aid of motor cars that the idea of a small permanent motor defence force for Kuwait occurred to my mind. Raids are as a rule made by comparatively small bodies of men, say 200 to 500, and the possession of two or three motor cars armed against rifle fire, carrying machine guns and Lewis guns, would com pletely checkmate the raiding tribes, who with their limited speed would not dare to come far inside the border. Men on camels would be an easy target for machine guns,; The expense of upkeep would be small and the men for the machine guns if not already obtainable could be trained either in India or Iraq. The cars needed would require to have solid tyres to avoid punctures by bullets, and of a type which would travel over sand. I have personally found that double tyres such as are on the back wheels of lorries are success ful in meeting the difficulties of ordinary sand and have a greater speed than caterpillars but the War Office could advise on this subject. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. €1ipd—976f&amp;pd -9-3-28— 7.u Ur Telegram Code i'rom PolitiaaJL, Kuwait To He si dent, BusMre No» 88 Dated tiie x4th February 19E8.

Up to the present he has always been absolutely certain that Dawish was action contrary to wishes of Ibn Saud. Now he does not know what to think, but points out that if they have come to an understanding it is strange that Dawish should have sent the message he did. He certainly expects an attack, probably on Jahrah or villages on coast but possibly on Kuwait itself. The situation is so obscure that one cannot estimate number of potential raiders.

Reports regarding events in nejd are very confused: one from Kuwait pointing to practical abandonment of Ibn Saud's efforts against Dawish and others to preparations for encircling him and starving him out. Meanwhile Air Force operations have been strikingly successful in so far as immediate object of protecting 'Iraq tribes from. Mutair raids is concerned, but they have not yet inflicted much damage on Mutair, who are still able to graze to South in ARTAWIYAH neighbourhood. it appears to iie appearance of aeroplanes over ARTAWIYAH and dropping warnings to the effect that any further incursion by Dawish will be followed by bombing of that place might now have immense effect upon nejd tribes and make them think that it will be unsafe for them to raid ♦Iraq in future. Whether flight of aeroplanes as far south as ARTAWIYAH would increase Ibn Saud's indignation at violation it is of his frontier, or his difficulties with his people, tiXx* difficult to say. My own view is that when we have once risked his indignation by crossing frontier we should now take full- -est possible advantage of it and that since we cannot indef- -initely prolong operations we ought to sec that they do not close without some striking demonstration of our power. I shall be glad to know whether you concur with the foregoing views. HIGH COMMISSIOJSERi v u^ Telegram P. ^om Political nesident, uuehire.

Baghdad telegram Ko» 93» It is perhaps inevitable if not indeed necessary that I should Tie^s matters from a different standpoint from 'Iraq. It appears to me, as I have already said in my telegrams Hos. 4 and 17, that Ihn Saud and not local tribes is the matter and the only matter to be considered. I hold the opinion that tribes are a side issue and at that affecting local rather than Imperial policy. Disgruntling Ibn Saud is likely to affect us very considerably on every face of Arabia and to effect this for the sake of punishing an Arab tribe for raiding appears to me an act of bombing our own main policy for a point of little permanent import- -ancc. The destruction of the Busaiyah post was a serious matter for which the ultimate responsibility had to come home to Ibn Saud and until we found he could do nothing I think we should have kept to our side of the frontier, us neglecting the fact that local tribes think absurd to consider frontiers. How that Ibn Saud has disbanded the troops he was raising for punishing the Mutair the question assumes a new phase and I personally consider we should, while taking every precaution for defence against raids, wait till we see what line Ibn Saud proposes to take. I see no object in taking aggressive action until we do i know. Our object is to come to a permanent settlement and I hope that Ibn Saud will joss? still keep his engagement forfor a meeting. Our desire is to maintain our friendship •with him as long as he keeps his side of his agreements and it is to our advantage to do so. If no satisfactory result is achieved we can then tell Ibn Saud that unless he can prevent raids and punish raiders we have no option hut to adopt aggressive methods in self defence, and we can then adopt them. As regards Kuwait I do not think that 'bombing tribes will help us in the general economic question. This matter rests upon our relations with Ihn Saud and homh- -ing is likely to make him stiffen his embargo not to relax it. Evidence suggests that this embargo is hitting local tribes as much as Kuwait and this needs further enquiry as effecting future policy we could bring to bear on quest- -ion. RESIDEHT.t/' r v Z'?? February 28 2).0. Ho. r 1 despair of 'Iraq. heir^policy is child!eh I use the word ao a simile and not as a metaphor. Our main concern is with Xhn Baud. he out- -break of the Mutair is a local side issue. Its only importance is the effect it has on the frontier tribes belonging to 'Iraq and our only policy should have been to protect the tribes up to our frontier until we were certain of what Ibn aud could accomplish. We have now dropped some bombs on the other siue of the frontier. Fe have done very little damage. Poes anybody imagine that bombs can do much damage to tribes fighting on camels in scattered formation ? W« now talk of bombing nejd tribes to teach them they cannot raid the tribes on the 'Iraq frontier. what we are really doing is bombing Ibn baud's influence anongst his tribes, an influence upon which we have been building and on which we have made a treaty with him: now he is faced either with losing this or with dropping his projects. It was up to us to wait and see what he could do especially as we have arranged a meeting with him — but in any case to let him show if he had the power or not. It now transpires that he had the power, and presumably the effect of our bombs would be to make his tribes, who are in the main fanatics, ask why they should get a 'fatwa^ against the Mutair for a raid across the frontier when •Iraq D. de S.

We request you to forward the following to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the quickest possible route which we want to be communicated to the British Government. As His Majesty's Government know, we have been and are still anxious that ^ood relations and friendship should exist between us and the British Government and with this intention we have done all that we could in the past and still do (all we can) to see that (good relations) they exist. We wrote very frankly to the British Government our opinion about the present incidents which have taken place between us and the Iraq Gov ernment. Matters are becoming more critical every day and we iind no way for settling such trouble except to make matters clear about every new critical situation so that they (His Majesty's Government) may see their way to help us in a manner that may decrease the troubles that are on the increase every day We have fully stated in our previous replies the effects in Najd of the actions of the Iraq Government, that all the raids were due to it and that the present troubles which we and the British Government are ex- . -i &gt; i i..! wt 4-V »rk-r» f.hp WPlTTnUP' OF ful to our nat there was no ™ , of t he soothing proclamations at the frontier and the neighbouring land - after taking such actions and after being able to restrict the trouble and calm the mind of the excited people. After all these troubles which we took to attain such results, the proclamations of the Iraq Government ere was no necessivy iui. ~— ise from such acts. Now the news about this attack has spread among ourWe had iust compelled the Dawish to return to his country after wa had circumscribed him with all sorts of checks; we had just succeeded in convincing the Najd people that we would settle the troubles that took place, as a result of the actions of the Iraq Government, peacefully by correspon dence and had caused them to disapprove of the f^^^Xwful- made the Alims notify and publish among the people of Najd the unlawtui ^fonlrictions taken by'the Dawish.

This had a very ba in Naid. After the calmness that had existed in the country the a ^wn of the Iraq officials when they bombed within our limits erased an agitation among the rest of the Najd people and gave rise to such that we are unable to estimate its result. We leave all tn^ .^sponsibility t all the incidents that have happened and those that will happen on shoulders of those officials who had done their evil and disapproved action without looking to the results. Therefore we strongly protest (1) against the crossing of our frontier by the aeroplanes and dropping warnings on our tribesmen (2) against the aggression of the aeroplanes agaiMt oiy s iects we were peacefully living in our country, which international law does not allow and for which there was no compelling reason. We want the British Government to know that this is the sharpest arrow that touched the heart of the friendly relations between Nejd and ^aq aM that we are afraid that the result of the agitations that have takenplacem Neid will be the cause of great incidents for which we are not to be new responsible but the responsibility falls on the one who aggressed withe cause and caused trouble after it had been quieted.

Should the Iraq Government do what they have published or the thing of which the British Government gave warning takes place we can hardly estimate the amount of excitement which may arise from such actions, and believe that the wise and mild man in Najd will be even more stirred than the ignorant and passionate man.

After compliments. We request you to forward the following to the Hon'ble Colonel Haworth, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for transmission to His Majesty's Government by the quickest possible route. We have already informed the British Government of the amount of trouble and difficulty we meet on account of the action of the Iraq Govern ment. We had just compelled the Dawish to return to his country after we had circumscribed him with all sorts of checks; we had just succeeded in convincing the Najd people that we would settle the troubles that took place, as a result of the actions of the Iraq Government, peacefully by correspon dence and had caused them to disapprove of the Dawish actions; we had made the Alims notify and publish among the people of Najd the unlawful ness of the actions taken by the Dawish. The Dawish had been repudiated and was blocked from all sides and the only means of punishment that we had not taken against him was the sending of a force, which we delayed simply as we were awaiting the result of the correspondence about the case of the criminals, as we were not confident that Dawish would not run to Iraq and be accepted by the Iraq Government. After attaining this end owingr to the trouble we had taken and after peace was established suddenly the aeroplanes gave warning to our people in our country that they would be liable to be fired on and then (the aeroplanes) crossed into our country and bombed those who were living there peacefully. This had a very bad effect in I^ajd. After the calmness that had existed in the country the action of the Iraq officials when they bombed within our limits caused an agitation among the rest of the iNajd people and gave rise to such a condition in Naid that w:e are unable to estimate its result. We leave all the responsibility for all the incidents that have happened and those that will happen on the shoulders of those officials who had done their evil and disapproved action without looking to the results. Therefore we strongly protest (1) against the crossing of our frontier by the aeroplanes and dropping warnings on our tribesmen (2) against the aggression of the aeroplanes against our sub jects we were peacefully living in our country, which international law does not allow and for which there was no compelling reason. We want the British Government to know that this is the sharpest arrow that touched the heart of the friendly relations between Nejd and 'Iraq and that we are afraid that the result of the agitations that have taken place in Nejd will be the cause of great incidents for which we are not to be held responsible but the responsibility falls on the one who aggressed without cause and caused trouble after it had been quieted. This is what we want to be communicated as soon as possible. High Commissioner, Baghdad, to the Political Resident in the Pebsian Gulf, Hushike.

It may be a liking for the religion on the part of some of them though we cannot say that all are such and it may be that some of them acted thus to be safe from being raided and to take that means to cause trouble to their Government. They were confident that when they accepted what the Najdis have accepted the Najdis will protect and defend them. If such things happen we are in difficulty by opposing and prevent ing the Najd people from getting into contact and helping those who follow ed them from people of other countries and the other Governments will have trouble owing to the behaviour of the tribesmen which is totally contrary to the religious and secular rules of'their Government. If we were unable to settle the present difficulties with the (help of the) intish Government at the quickest time and in accordance with justice, equity and the laws of friendship which provide for the guarding of interests of oneself and those of his friend, we will have trouble every day which we wi 1 not be able to face and oppose. Neither is it in the interests of both the countries to leave matters to go as they are without being settled or remedied, p 18 18 - ^tter to which we want to invite the attention of the British oroyernment to see with us the way to settle matters so that we may get rid these ti:oub les which are opposed to the interest of both sides.

I have every intention of seeing that imr po litical control is maintained and you need have no fear that I am out for any unnecessary homhing. I consider that our primary object should he to protect British lives and property and our second to assist the Shaikh of Kuwait against unprovoked attack. It is also, when not contrary to Kuwait interests, presumably desirable to further British policy against the Kutair. The first two objects can be best served by obtaining the earliest possible news regarding any con templated attack. With this object in view, I recommend most strongly that you endeavour to obtain immediate sanction for aeroplanes to cross the frontier, the near est point of which is only 42 miles away, as otherwise thay will be of comparatively little use against such an extraordinarily mobile foe. I would moreover point our that they habitually cross the frontier from Iraq, neutral zone, and it is in 'best interests that they should do so from here also, so i that it appears that they are part of our ordinary plans and not special help for the Shaikh of Kuwait. In aay case I presume there is no objection to their flying over territory common both to Nejd and Kuwait. I will report everything to you fully. POLITICAL.tu .

Ibn Sa ud implies that he would not regard Busaiyah as ' ala atraf al hudud ' if there were no wells there, but that the presence of well makes it ' ala atraf al hudud/' This argument is not understood unless Ibn Sa^ud means that there are no other wells nearer the frontier and that there fore the Protocol must refer to the Busaiyah wells. This, however, is not so; there are several wells nearer the frontier as has been shown in reply No. 2 contained in the pre vious statement. 10. Ibn Sa^ud states that Faisal al 10.

The 'Iraq Government repudiates this Government are in the habit of welcoming allpgation which might more appropriately criminals whom he wishes to punish in the be made against Ibn Sa-'ud on account of his interests of the 'Iraq Government and cites dealings with the chiefs of the Dahamshah the ease of:— and Dhafir tribes (see reply No. 7 in th« previous statement). {a) Yusuf al Sa'dun {a) Ibn Sa'ud's citation of the case of Yusuf al Sa'dun is singularly unfortunate for his argument. The story briefly is as follows In the autumn of 1921 Yusuf al Sa'dun was appointed head of the Nasiriyah camel corps. In March 1922 the camel corps was attacked and almost annihilated by the Akhwan. It was realised by the 'Iraq Gov ernment tint Yusuf al Sa'dun had made use of his position to further his own interests and had given provocation to the Akhwan, and he was accordingly removed from his position. Subsequently in February 1923 he visited Ibn Sa'ud at Riyadh. Ibn Sa'ud, as he admitted in a letter to Sir Percy Cox, welcomed him with honour and hospitality : he was also reported to have given him a large sum of money. Yusuf then returned to ; Iraq and gave out that he had been appointed by Ibn Sa'ud as his Agent to collect zikat from the 'Iraq tribes and to build a fort and mosque at Abu Ghar, etc. (Ibn Sa'ud denied the truth of this.) By virtue of his supposed appointment Yusuf induced the Akhwan tribes to assist him in raiding his rival Hamud Ibn Suwait and to defy the 'Iraq Government. Finally his camp was bombed in August 1923 after which he surrendered to the Iraq Government and was prevented from causing further trouble. In this case it was the welcome accorded by Ibn Sa'ud to a mutinous 'Iraq chief that caused the trouble and it is not understood in what way the 'Iraq Government gave Ibn „■ 1 Sa'ud any cause for complaint.Argument. (5) Ibn Mijlad I 12, Ibn Sa^ad says that if he were to punish al Dawish, he would escape to 'Iraq where he would be given an asylum. IS. Ibn Saud makes three demands :— (a) That Article 3 of the 'Uqair Protocol should be observed and that the Busaiyah and other posts should be demolished. (5) That both pa' ties undertake not to accept any criminal coming from the country of other party whatever his crime may be. (c) That the 'Iraq Government should undertake to prevent the visit of any motor cars, aeroplanes or men from mixing with Najd tribes with the intention of creatine trouble. &amp; Reply. {6) Ibn Sa'ud has constantly claimed that tzza' ibn Mijlad and M ohamed ibn Turki of the Dahamshah are Najd subjects as well as their tribe. It is surprising to find that he now represents them^ or one of them, as criminals whom he is anxious to punish in the interests of 'Iraq. The 'Iraq Govern ment claim that the Dahamshah are an ; Iraq tribe, but Ibn Sa'ud has been informed that, though Jazza' ibn Mijlad is an 'Iraq subject so long as he remains with his tribe, the 'Iraq Government have no objection to his going to Najd and becoming a Najd subject in which case they will take such steps as may be possible to prevent him from re entering 'Iraq. Ibn Sa'ud is probably referring, however, to the action taken by the Amir of Hail to recover from Mohamed ibn Turki the camels which he had looted from the Suqur (see reply No. 6 in previous statement). On this occasion Mohamed ibn Turki recrossed the frontier into 'Iraq, bat was none the less followed by an Akhwan raiding party under Adwan ibn Rimmal and was raided by them in /Iraq territory. Mohamed ibn Turki subsequently complained to the authorities in Baghdad, but obtained no sympathy as it was recognised that he deserved punishment. A mild protest was sent to Ibn Sa'ud against the action of Adwan ibn Rimmal in raiding an 'Iraq tribe in 'Iraq territory. There seem to be no grounds for Ibn Sa'ud's complaint. 12. The 'Iraq Government have now given Ibn Sa'ud a definite assurance that they will not shelter Faisaal al Dawish. 13.— {a) The ''Iraq Government agree that Article 3 of the 'Uqair Protocol should be observed but do not agree to demolish the Busaiyah and other posts as their existence does not contravene Article 3 of the Protocol. (5)^ Provided it is clearly understood that the Iraq Government, following the example of all other Governments both in Europe and Asia, cannot contemplate the surrender of poli tical offenders ; they are ready at any time to engage in conversations for the purpose of making an extradition agreement with the Najd Government in accordance with Article 10 of the Bahra Agreement. (c) The 'Iraq Government have never sent motor cars, aeroplanes or agents to cause trouble among the Najd tribes (unless the operations now in progress can be so termed). In order to exercise control over the desert areas within 'Iraq, 'Iraq officials in cars visit all tribes, whether 'Iraq, or Najdi, who are the the Iraq desert. They have never endea voured to entice Najd tribes to 'Iraq or to cause trouble in Najd. If Najd tribes enter Iraq territory the 'Iraq Government have every right to visit and control them, just as Ibn ba ud's officials visit 'Iraq tribes in Najd territory, a practice to which the 'Iraq 'government have never objected.r/v 14 PS. ..645...969...5000...30 -11 -26. |VH H.

H.M's • Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, High Commissioner, .Baghdad. Jta. Political Resident, Bushire. IMMEDIATE , Your telegram Ho. 93 of 17th February. On political grounds 1 am strongly averse from estalDlishment of air 'base in Nejd territory or indeed to any extension of present punitive operations except in response to renewed and serious provocation in the shape of further Alchwan raids irito 'Ix'a^. Permission to extend operations over ITejd territory was given because it was understood this was necessary in order to restore confidence among wavering ♦Iraq, border tribes. It appears from your telegram that this object has now been achieved and I consider that the time has now come to hold our hand in order to; give Ibn Saud an opportunity to re-establish control himself. in the opinikm of His Majesty^ Government it is of the utmost importance that Ibn Saud ahould not be driven into the position where he has to choose between permanently antagonising his own people or coming out into the open as enemy of Great Britain. jNor is it in our interest that he should suffer any severe diminmtion of his authority in Hejd. Moreover we must not overlook the possibility of Faisal's attempting to manoeuvre us into position in which our aeroplanes become instrument of his personal hostility towards Ibn Saud. Information goes to confirm statement in Ibn Saud^ letter rep«Bted in Bushire telegram JHo. 19 of February 11th that he had already set in motion measures to re-establish controlcontrol over Dawish when public feeling aroused by our air action caused hira to abandon these measures. if Ibn Saud proves to be incapable of re-establishing and exacting repar- -ation # it may be necessary to resort to the extreme measures suggested in your telegram but 1 xaadai consider in the firtt instance he should be given a chance to show what he can do. Unless therefore you see strong objection, Resident in the Persian Gulf should return reply to Ibn Baud's above mentioned letter stating that His Majesty's Government have no desire to take any action which would make it more difficult for him to punish Mutair and exact repar- i -ation but that so long as these tribesmen were admittedly out of control His Majesty's Government jtaa clearly could not remain passive and allow them to attack law abiding 'Iraq,! tribes with impunity. It is naturally His Majesty's Government's wish, however, that the necessary punishment should be inflicted by Ibn Saud himself rather than by their aeroplanes. Accordingly if Ibn Saud will prevent further raids upon 'Iraq and Kuwait territory and if he will take immediate action against Dawish, His Majesty's Government are prepared to abstain from further air action within nejd territory for a sufficient period to enable him to arrange i E for punishment of TDawlsh and the exaction of full reparation. His Majesty's Government must however reserve to themselves the right, in the event of further raids on •Iraq or Kuwait territory to punish raiders and,if necessary,pursue them across the frontier. In communicating the above to Ibn Saud, Resident, Bushire should inform him that in the opinion of His Majesty's Government all difficulties might speedily be removed by personal interview and that he is accordingly 1 prepared to meet Ibn Saud at such time and place as may be convenient to His Majesty, As regards venue of meeting i am unwilling to fetterfetter Resident's liberty of action 'but rely on him to act discreetly and not to run unnecessary risks, I see from paragraph 46 of 'Iraq Intelligence Report for period ending January 18th that 'Iraq Government propose to establish permanent post at SHABAIGHA, which is only some 26 miles from Nejd frontier and might therefore f naturally be oonaidered an infringement of Uqair protocol. Unless you are satisfied that this post is essential for defence purposes you should do your utmost to dissuade the •Iraq Government from proceeding with its construction# SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLOH JES.Telegram From To Repeated No. 83.

Dated 22nd received 23rd February 1928 Reference Bushire telegrams ending with jno. 32 to you dated February 20th and Delhi telegram wo. 384-S of February 21st. I need not remind His Majesty^ Government that we are dealing xijfek not with problem of petty frontier raids but with critical situation certain to affect decision upon what is perhaps most weighty project now under consideration within British Empire and its dependencies, namely combined pipe line and railway from Baghdad to Mediterranean. This probably Xm transcends in importance not only questions of arranging aeroplane flights from Basra along the southern shores of the Gulf to India but even possibility of temporary effervescence among Indian Khilafatists. If some means cannot be devised of controlling or checking incursions of Nejd tribe Hutair, whose last raid beginning on February 20th is reported by Hoyal Air Force still engaged in attacking raiders, as 1200 strong, whole desert at least as far north as line from RUTBAH to DAMASCUS will become untenable, and pipe line and railway must take northern route through Syrian territory. This will probably mean great loss to British basic trades, ruin of Haifa and blow at prosperity of Palestine besides preventing JBritish Mediterranean fleet from using the oil in the event of any future hostilities in which France is neutral. Plans of i i;r 11 oil companies and capitalists are almost matured and decision as to route must probably be taken within the next few months. ComparativelyComparatively minor problem but one.of con- -eiderable importance is discharge of our obligations to defend Iraq, and Kuwait and Transjordania and to guard against possibility, which with these very strong bodies of raiders may at any time become serious, of holy cities xiajaf and Karbala being laid waste by Wahabis, as occurred in early 19th Century. Recent series of completely unprovoked raids began early in JNovember and have continued with unprecedented ferocity and cruelty up to the present* btern protest by His Majesty s Government reached Ibn Saud at the beginning of December and it was only after nearly two months delay, after it became evident that the Mutair tribe was out of ibn Baud 's control and after declaration by paramount Shaikh of Iraq Anezeh that unless emergent action were taken his tribe, dominating deserts between Mesopotamia and Mediteeeanean, must either become Akhwan or take refuge in Syria, that His Majesty's Government decided on air operations against rebel tribe in Hejd territory. 1 had myself suggested warning to Ibn Saud that if he did not regain control within a fixed period Gulf Ports would be Jbajs blockaded but His Majesty^ Government preferred alternative which they took. Result of operations has been that raiders t have had their favourite and least vulnerable line of access to Iraq denied to them and have been forced to attack, as in the last raid, along route which has exposed them to reprisals in which they hjuc are believed to have suffered heavily. Meanwhile loss of control by Ibn Saud has become more patent than ever. He has been obliged to disband mixed force which he had raised against Mutair and to abandon combinatiorj against them which he had hoped to bring about. He has covered his failure by violent xvrotests against His Majesty's Government's policy of attacking the rebel tribe within Kejd territory, a policy similar to that years several times adopted in recent by the Government of India towards Persia when Persian Baluchistan tribes have raidedraided British territory and Persian Government has 'been powerless to punish them. It may be argued that .British and Iraq forces should be able to preserve peace of desert by defensive measures within Mesopotamia, but with vast line of desert open like ocean to pirates who can pick and choose ■ lines of attack and retreat, only remedy is as with pirates in China or Algiers, to rout them out in their ixlxsi bases. if they think their bases secure nothing will prevent con- -tinuance of raiding. If therefore Xbn Saud continues to be powerless against the raiders ( and there appears no other prospectj and if His Majesty^ Government were to reverse the policy of aerial attacks within nejd territory the only alternatives 1 W would be either to declare blockade against isejd ports and thus bring pressure to bear on whole fiejd Government without penetration into Jazirat-al-Arab or to permit and instigate Mesopotamian tribes to revert to aid habit o^ fiuunter-raids into .Nejd and so deprive J^ejd raiders of security within their own territory. This would throw whole desert into con- -fusion and would in view of ill-regulated nature of tfcB&amp;ttxX tribal warfare rapidly involve other JMejd tribes which had hitherto been friendly to Great Britain and Mesopotamia. i agree that personal discussion with ibn Saud might do some good in so far as it might convince him of the reasonableness of His Majesty^s Governments attitude but it'is not likely to increase hi© power of controlling Akhwan tribes and this is the essence of the whole question.

Bagiidad telegram Ho • 107 and circular of 23rd February. I submit following remarks for consideration in hope they may assist. Under the circumstances disclosed in circular it is certain that we cannot break off operations or while they continue hamper them with considerations of frontier line since effect on tribes would be thinking that they had broxaght down aeroplane and defeated British. Similarly with situation which has now arisen we shall be obliged to maintain an aeroplane reconnaissance along frontier line. But I would submit our policy also turns upon one other point: can aeroplane action finally deal with tribes engaged in raids ? Is it not true as suggested in Baghdad telegrams JKos. 93 and 104 that to get effectire action they must attack bases except in such rare cases as they can find tribes in close formation and i4 it not natural instinct of tribes to scatter at sight of aeroplanes ? if this ia true and punitiTe action other than defeating a raid always entails the envisaging of raids on bases in Bejd will this not entail the accidental killing of women and children? If so it might defeat its object and should be used only as a final necessity. Indignation at action of Mutair tribe ■ in killing children will be useful argument with Ibn Saud but not if we accidentally but inevitably repeat it ourselves• On these premises it would appear that only present course is action as expressed in your telegram Bo. 82 and- ■ . ■ Iand in the meantime for Kuwait, with which I am concerned, and also Iraq, if I may say so, to take necessary defensire measures, which naturally includes maintenance of defence posts and armoured cars and offeneive defence 'but only going 'beyond the frontier in actually repulsing a raid. I see no method of meeting situation except for Ihn Saud and ourselves to riew this frontier question with the same eyes. If this is possible to be attained it can only be attained by an aarly meeting. If Ibn Saud fails us, question, as you have foreshadowed, assumes a new aspect, but whatever he may write final responsibility for present situation goes back to the destruction of Busaiyah post and it is as much to his advantage as our own to reach a working basis. RESHJEKT.Telegram P # Prom Political Agent, JBahrain, To Political Resident, Bushire. * No. 75. Dated 23rd receiyed 24th February 1928. Letter of February 18th from Ibn Saud acknow- -ledges my despatch Ho. 54. He says hw wanted this sort of reply before High Commissioner sent aeroplanes across his 'border to 'trample M article 6 of Bahra agreement and articles 6 and 10 of Jeddah Treaty. Officials in Mesopotamia and Mesopotam -ia have broken written treaties. What is fault of Harb, Shammar and Anezeh, who live in Eorth-wsst of his country, that aeroplanes maltreat them daily while Dawish did as he liked in Mesopotamia for many days ? Only explanation is that creation of new trouble for Nejd was intended. JNejdis have become like Dawish and no longer respect treaties with Mesopotamia, which has deliberately broken firstly, paragraph 2 of Article X of Mohammerah Treaty, secondly, Article 3 of U^air Protocol, thirdly, Articles i f 4, 5 and 6 of Bahra/ Agreement. Hejdis think that the Government which has already broken six undertakings will not hesitate to break another by the acceptance of Dawish. He had given Dawish partial punishment and had promised to give full on a condition to which he had added two others when action of Mesopotam- -ian Government destroyed all hope that he had build and removed all excuses which he was putting before his people. He can see no way out of present difficulties except if Central British Government makes inquiry about person responsible for recent action in Mesopotamia, throws responsibility on him and will from their side restore confidence of people in undertakings. Hew e is still doing his 'best to pacify his people owing to hie 'belief that His Majesty's Government will not permit their oldtime friendly relations with JNejd to be threatened by some self-interested agitator. If His Majesty's Government will not take necessary steps early he will not be responsible for the result. Ends. POLITICAL.*v (^y Telegrasa Pr®m To Repeated P. Political Resident, Buahire.

Your demi-official letter ^o# 77-S., of 18th February. I quite understand your reason for thinking it undesirable to have an Intelligence Officer from Iraq in Kuwait and I would as much oppose it as you are 'but for the fact that it was only proposed as a temporary measure. One reason why paroposal seemed so attractive to me no doubt was that at the time when it was made I was snowed under by more work than I could cope with properly and I knew he would take some of it off ray hands. In normal times there is no need for an Intelligence Officer here. Even now 1 think the only things he could do which I do not a/te (1) having no other work he could go round himself more and so get news quicker and (2) he could employ secret service agents. But I think he would be worth having for (2) alone at a time like the present. I have no funds for secret service nor do I consider it desirable that I should employ spies, yet they are undeniably useful and Kuwait would be best place to recruit them for the sort of tribal work required. 1 do/ not advocate Jetting a man from India as it would take too long and also because he would be quit® useless unless he knew Arabic really well. If you do not consider(?) these advantages outweigh disadvantages, I would suggest possibility of compromise by your borrowing Arabic speaking British officer from Royal Air Force, Iraq, to act temporarily as my assist- -ant, on the understanding that 1 would only employ him on intelligenceintelligence work (they providing funds) and lie would correspond direct 'but report to me# This might satisfy them as Head of Intelligence Bureau, BaghAdd, and 1 worked together at Intelligence Department work all through war. .Next day or two will show whether there is any need for anything of sort or not.

Responsibility must be left to Ibn Saud in any ease until it is clear that he is unwilling or unable to discharge it. Recent air operations in nejd territory were authorised because it was understood no other means were immediately available of preventing defection of Iraq, Anizeh which was imminent. It was a purely emergency measure and as (its) immediate object has apparently (been ?) achieved it should in the opinion of His Majesty^ Government be abandoned and Ibn Saud given a chance to -re-establish control.

Above instructions were about to issue when your telegram Ho. 107 of 23rd February reached me. There is no question of stopping pursuit of raiders.

Troops take some days to get preliminaries ready hence my suggestion in my telegram lio. 235 to India that as a precautionary measure they should he told to stand hy in case they are required as in that event the whold essence o^. the matter would be time. If they are not required no harm is done. While then I hope these conditions will not arise we should be prepared for them for they aie qnquesticnably very possible on the evidence at present before us.

Further if private emissaries from Faisal go to Nejd tribes will it not be the end of all hope for a solution of present difficulties ? I feel assured that the crux of the present trouble is the private enmity between Ibn Saud and Faisal. What will Ibn Saud do if he finds out, as he is bound to find out, about these messengers ? Will he not even suspect as I am tempted to believe, the arrival of private emissaries from Faisal will set the blaze on fire, while if he is not in effective control it will make him go the whole way with his tribes.

After compliments,. ^ ^^knowledge the receipt of your letter No. 54-C., dated the lt)th Sha ban 1346 (8th February 1928), which contained the telegram vou received from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. We request you to send the following to his honour for conveyance to the Central British Government by the quickest route. It was our desire to get a similar reply to that of His Excellency the High Commissioner regarding the refusal oi the criminals, before the despatch of the aeroplanes, with His Excellency's orders which were an aggression against our independence and despised our national authority within our country ; thereby they trampled over the treaties upon which we with the British and 'Iraq Governments consented to observe wiem (see Article VI of Bahra Treaty and X of Jiddah Treaty). His Excellency after he had ordered and permitted all these aggressions ana after breaching those undertakings informs us that the 'Iraq Government will not give shelter to Dawish and his followers. ml 068(c) f&amp;pd2 I The 'Iraq Government as well as the officials in 'Iraq stated that they i; } #^ intend to punish the Dawish within our country. They have no rule or law that gives such right to them within our country. They ventured to break the written treaties while Dawish and his follow ers live in a special zone in our country which is wellknown. What is the fault of the Shammar, Anazah and Harb tribes, who are living in the north- west of our country, that the aeroplanes visit them in the early morning every day and maltreat them ? Why were these visits not paid to the Dawish when he was in 'Iraq land for many days doing just as he liked while the British forces looked at him but not a single bullet was fired against him ? We can only explain the recent action of the officials in 'Iraq as an aggression by which it is intended that hurt should be done to Nejd and new troubles created. After the action of the aeroplanes and the despising of the Treaties between us, all the Nejd people have become like Dawish in his opinion, % j vehemence and venture. They do not now respect the undertakings with 'Iraq for the reason that from the Muhammarah Treaty up till now six articles have been deliberately broken, for which please refer to the following:— 1. The second paragraph of the first article of the Muhammarah Treaty. 2. Article III of Uqair Protocol. 3. Article I of Bahrah Treaty. 4. Article V of Bahrah Treaty. 5. Article IV of Bahrah Treaty and 6. Article VI of Bahrah Treaty. When a reference is made to these articles of agreement and compared with the actions of the 'Iraq Government towards Nejd, it will be seen that these articles were deliberately infringed by certain incidents against which we protested to the British Government (against them all) and did not get any result from any of our protest, and the 'Iraq Government did not carry out one of these articles, nor stopped doing what (the agreements) prohibited. The belief that existed in Nejd and still exists is that the Government that permitted for its ownself the breach of six undertakings will be able to add to them some other articles and will go against them and will accept the Dawish and his followers, if we were to punish them at the present time for their sake and will not hesitate to breach their under taking. We were angry at the Dawish's action and disapproved it, and we gave him partial punishment and promised to give him complete punishment on a condition to which were added two other ones. We made matters quiet at the frontier and awaited the discussion about the undertakings that were broken for putting an end to everything, but the action of the 'Iraq Govern ment destroyed (all the hopes) what we had built and we had no excuse to put before our nation and people and nothing remained for us to say to them. Thus they came to such condition and state that we can hardly estimate the result, after they have seen that their agreements are broken and that their 1 country is despised, in addition to which humanity suffered at the hands of civilised men, while we notice with an eye of regret and broken heart what destiny brings. We can see no arrangement for the present situation which may settle it but a prudent one that the Central British Government may take to enquire about the person responsible who caused these actions in 'Iraq and to put the responsibility on him and will from their side restore the confidence of the people so that the undertakings may have a value and respect. Then they should take such action as may restore the old confidence between the two countries. We, in spite of all that happened, still do our best to quieten the agitated state, as we, till the last hour, believe that the British Government which has been our friend for a long time will not agree that the relations between Nejd and Britain should be threatened by some self-interested agitators, whose interests are against the treaties.r-e^T- I Should the British Government not take steps with all possible speed to remedy affairs in the manner we have suggested, we cannot estimate the results and we cannot accept responsibility for them. This is what we want to be sent to the Hon'ble the Political Resident for communication to the British Government. Usual ending.

After Coraplirnente, Colonel Haworth has telegraphed to me to send you the following message in his name. The message begins:- In reply to your letter of the 13th Shaban, His Majesty , s Government have instructed me to inform Your Majesty that they have no v desire to take any action which would make it more difficult 1 for you to punish Mutair tribe and to exact repara- tion from them but that so long those tribesmen were admittedly out of control, it is clear that ■ His Majesty^ Government could not remain passive and a 11 ov/ them to attack law abiding 'Iraqian tribe* with impunity. It is natural His Majesty^ Govern ment wishes., however, that necessary punishment should be inflicted by Your Majesty yourself rather i than by aeroplanes of British Government. Thus on receipt of |four Majesty's assurance to His Majesty's Government that Your Majesty is taking effective measures to prevent further raids upon Kuwait-'Iraq territories and to punish Faisal bin Dawish and to obtain reparation.

Further object -ions to such a course a'rp H ^ +-u • j. urse are (1J that it would finally remove any TO prospect there may be of ibn Saud succeeding in re- -establishing control and stopping raiding and (2J that it would definitely convince Ibn Saud that our air action was designed not as means of punishing raiders but as instrument of Faisal s personal hostility towards him. Objections appear to me to apply equally to preliminary steps which Faisal wishes to take. Once the idea counter raids is mooted amongst tribesmen and preparations are authorised it seems almost certain that action by tribesmen will be precip- -itated, particularly as the Government of Iraq cannot be relied upon to exercise effective restraining influence. You will understand that there is no intention of ruling out employment of tribal levies to assist in defence of Iraq under the control of Air Officer Commanding as was done at the time of the Turkish menace, but if Air Officer Commanding considers he can usefully organise and co-ordinate tribes-men for this purpose and if he desires to do so it should be clearly understood that they must be wholly under iiis control. So long as Air Officer Commanding is respon- -sible for defensive operations His Majesty f s Government could not countenance in any circumstances unorganised tribal cajtion.I doubt the wisdom of Va.ls a -\&lt; a • proposal to send private messengers to Hejd Chiefs. lf +&gt;H . tJ:lls is to 'be done openly it would clearly hp r&gt;r»M + y be con travention of Article lo. 5 of Bahra i^greement and mie-ht -f-vi v re ^y serve to furnish ibn Saud with fresh material for hi^ r» Qa 13 case against us. secretary op stats k)h the colohies.itk ^ Telegram From To Repeated Political Resident, Bushire Seor«tary of State for the Colonies.

Most of the correspondence is between Lionel Haworth, the Political Resident in Bushire, Henry Dobbs, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, Ibn Sa'ud, the King of the Hejaz and Najd, Leo Amery, the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, James More, the Political Agent in Kuwait, Cyril Barrett, the Political Agent in Bahrain, Edward Ellington, the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, and the Government of India.The majority of the volume covers the British response to the crisis following the Ikhwan rebellion and the threat of attack on Kuwaiti and Iraqi territory.
