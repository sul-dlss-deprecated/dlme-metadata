I feel I am here under somewhat false pretences. Invited by my friend. Mr Brodie Hoare - in the usual ^will you walk into my parlour' fashion - to say a few words to a few friends, I was suddenly amazed to learn from the 'Times' newspaper and other leading journals, that I had engaged to address a meeting at Hampstead on Imperial Interests; and now I find myself in the presence of this large and intellectual assemblage, which probably knows far more about Imperial Affairs than I do myself. However, being an old soldier, I have always been taught to obey, and, accordingly I now obey the mandate of your excellent member. Moreover, observation and experience have assured me that one rarely tumbles into a dilemma without dis-covering some compensating consolation. In the present instance I have the delightf»iil sensation of gratifying the wishes of my friend and colleague in the House of Comnons, your straight and able representative, Mr Brodie Hoare, And when, at the coming election, you shall return him - as I know you can and will do - at the head of the Poll, I shall enjoy the pleasing self-deception of having, in some slight degree, bitten through the meshes with which his adversaries endeavcrured to entangle him during the contest. Nor is this my only consolation: for when a potential audience intimates through the 'Times' that I am going to speak on Imperial interests, I consider that they oblige me, by a kind of telephonic hint, to refrain from harping on those everlasting topics of Home Affairs. Indeed among the great difficulties that one experiences in public speaking lies the misfortune that there issuch a plenitude of subjects to speak about, and that every topic has been talked to shreds. Well, the Lord deliver me from saying a word to you about Ireland, the County Council, or such-like. Dtuming to Imperial interests, we all remember that the Earl of Rosebery recently made a very brilliant speech at the City Liberal Club; and on that occasion he used the following words: 'We have been pulled out of Europe by the great Empire which has been growing up outside these islands during the last 40 years, while we have been almost sitting still with folded hands and watching its growth* • • , I think you can divide the foreign policy of this Empire into the East- em and Western questions, and they are the questions of India and Canada. . . We must recognize that our foreign policy has become a colonial policy, and is in reality at this moment much more dictated from the extremities of the Empire than it is from London itself.'Now let us examine these few sentences a little. His Lordship begins by saying that we have been pulled out of Europe by the Great Empire growing up outside these islands, I venture to think that we have not been pulled out of Europe by our Colonies, but that we have been pushed out of Europe by the altered condition of the European problem itself. 'R'or a long period this kingdom was a match for any other Power in War; and at the conclusion of the great Napoleonic war we remained the most powerful nation in Europe; while, as Macaulay declares, our ^leet had be come more than a match for all the other Fleets in the world combined. In old days we went to war for the ao-called balance of Trade: we went to war for dynastic purposes; we went to war for the balance of Power, We fought to drive theMahometans out of Europe, and we fought to keep the Mahometans in Europe. We risked our land forces on the plains of Belgium, on the Sierras of Spain, and in the Crimea. But we have now changed all that: we are nov willing to accept a French Republic or a German Autocracy, and we care not whether a Bourbon, a Buonaparte, or an Orleanist resumes power. Christian Europe is absolutely indifferent to the fact that the dome^ of Saint Sophia daily resounds to the announcement^ from the pulpit that Mahomet is the prophet of God; while the proclamation by uu» 0^11 Angels of Peace on earth has to be supported by the presence of nineteen millions of men under amis. And why is our policy changed? Not because our Colonial Empire has tugged us by the coat tails, but because we have ceased to be a great Military Power in Europe and we do not wish to render ourselves ridiculousby risking a handful of British troops in quarrels where twelve millions of armed men might presently engage. We therefore prudently refrain from armed interference in Europe, and hold our Navy as an instrument in the cause of peace. Meantime, also, we develop our trade, upon which our Empire is largely based, and whose results contribute to maintain it. But when Lord Rosebery adds that we in thfyisland have been sitting still with fold- /&gt; Ct^L- ed hands, watching the growth of the Empire, I in fact- agree with him: for in truth the central power of the Kingdom has had little to do with the creation of this Empire other than to criticise, obstruct, and sometimes to thank or punish those pioneers, the fruits of whose courage, ability, and resource we have long reaped, and still enjoy: Witness America, witness India. The Government at Westminster drove Lord Clive to suicide andtreated Warren Hastings as a criminal; and yet it is now admitted the records show Hastings was right through- out, and that Clive founded an Empire without which Great Britain would have dwindled into something resembling an insular Holland. YesJ the history of our Empire is the record of vast results achieved by comparatively very small means. It is the monument of men of great courage, ability and re source, who have hazarded their reputations and their lives in the service of their country. It may be true that meanwhile rulers at the centre have been sitting still with folded hands, but that does not imply that the Empire was pulling the Kingdom out of Europe; it means rather that the Kingdom, being pushed out of Europe by superior forces, has found salvation in the Empire, No doubt, the confusion in thought may be partly attribut-able to the fact that those who sit in offices and Chambers in Westminster really suppose themselves to be the fly-wheel of the machinery, both of Kingdom and Empire, whereas the men of action, who have built up the Lord Rosebery proceeds to say that the Foreign policy of the Empire is divisable into the questions of India and Canada, and that our foreign policy has become a Colonial policy. I venture to think that Lord Rosebery is mistaken. There is such a thing as the ocean;' there is a sea called the Mediterranean; there is the Isthmus of Suez, and the Continent of Africa. All these regions seem to me to have very important bearings on our Foreign policy, and yet they are not India or Canada. The power of this country might be irretrievably destroyed In the Mediterranean or in the Channel before Canada or India Empire, regard the Metropolitancould become cognisant of the event. England might lose SoAVl^^ her independence ( yet Canada might atart as a separate or a Federal state in America. Look at the Mediterranean this moment: and trace the history of our Navy for the past few years. Having, in the course of my service under Government crossed the world some nineteen times, I have found opportunity for noting the then unprotected condition of our coaling stations in the East^ and having been for many years directly associated with the Navy, I could not but a little observe its conditions, and listen to the opinions of able and experienced Naval officers. So, when I entered Parliament, I ventured to ask Government as to the state of our coaling stations, and I ventured to suggest an immediate expenditure c^f twenty-one millions on our Navy. Well, the present Admiralty Board deserve great credit for their exertions for the protection ofcoaling stations, and the strengthening of the Navy. But even now, what is our position as a Sea Power? A few years ago we had only five or six battle-ships in the Mediterranean, while at this moment we have not more than eleven battle-ships in that Sea. Meantime the French have massed some 23 ships in Toulon: to say nothing of the Russian squadron in the Baltic. And I believe / it to be a positive fact, that if, to-morrow, the French upon some ever ready pretext like that of Egypt, were to declare war against us, our naval position in the Medit erranean would be critical. It is all very well to talk about the Channel wing of the Fleet reinforcing the (j- p&gt;oiS' l ' u - U Mediterranean .squadron, but there is s«-eh a thing as arrivfia^ too late, and hQimg beaten in detail, and if once we were beaten in a general action in the Mediterran ean our naval supremacy might be lost; and with thatsupremacy might go our Colonial Empire beyond sea. For it is always to be borne in mind that Colonies fall to the Power that gains the decisive Victory in a Naval war. But it is argued that Gibraltar is the centre and key of the position; that it is impregnable^'and that in the contingency of threatened war, our Fleet could be massed in the straits and be protected by the Rock! I believe such an argument to be fallacious. Gibraltar Bay, as it now lies, is not a safe anchorage, nor is it secure against torpedoes. To render Gibraltar a safe ti rendezvous for the combined Fleets of the Channel and of •» • the Mediterranean, considerable works would be necessary: t x % and in my deferential opinion the sooner these works are undertaken the better will it be for the Navy and for the Empire. But the loss of our Colonies would not be the only result of the loss of our naval supremacy. Forhow is this densely peopled island to be fed when an enemy should dominate in the Channel? I do not speak of invasion of the kingdom, for I am certain that in vasion would rouse the people ta -I'iae in « mass^ so that any hostile force landing might indeed do incalculable mischief, but would be finally annihilated. No, what I fear is starvation, to prevent which the Government might find itself compelled to capitulate. Gentlemen, I think you will perceive that I hold our Navy to be the key and essential factor of our Empire? Naval Power maintained, all else is manageable. But naval supremacy, sea power gone, the rest goes with it. I am aware that there are rhetoricians who would dispute all that I am now advancing. But who are these men? I have known some of them and it has been my fate to listen to some of them. And I do assure you that Inave s3Q n men rise 'to speak on Empire — its resources ciiid adminlstration — who forthwith displayed their ig- norance of the very A,B.C. of details of principles: A. Men who have never seen a day 1 s danger or done one day's real work for the Empire, and who yet dictate to or pre tend to govern those who have borne the sweat and burden of the age.' Men who far from being Statesmen or Ad ministrators could not in the hour of peril be entrusted with a corporal's guard or the management of a Parish. But then it is said we won the day under old Nelson, and we should win it again now. I submit that the condi tions of the two cases are different. In the time of the Napoleonic wars it took less time to build a line of battle-ships than it now takes to build one of our bi^ guns, while the cost of a Man of War was insignificant as compared with that of one of our huge iron-clads. Our ships at the opening of the century might be counted14 by hundreds, perhaps by thousands, and I am infomed that between the years 179 6 and 1805, we lost in one way and another, some nine hundred vessels of war. We could not now, I understand, count upon more than 70 battle-ships, and it is upon this class of ships that we must depend in general actions,' and it is upon general actions that the fate of a naval war will hang. Doubtless swift cruisers are essential for intelligence, and for doing something towards the protection of our ubiquitous sea-borne Trade. I No doubt, also, fortified coaling stations are essential for maintaining our Fleets in fuel. But both cruisers and coaling stations are subsidiary to the battle-ships, and would become of little avail if the latter were defeated. Therefore, I venture to urge that the Government of this Empire should before all else look to its Navy, should continuously strengthen it, and place it as a whole, and\ 15 in all its details, in such a condition as shall render our maritime supremacy reasonably secure. Money will be forthcoming if the country be taught to understand that its existence as a great Power is at stake. Gentlemen, I trust I have not wearied you by my lengthened remarks on the Navy, and before I sit down I would venture to intrude a little longer on your time and kindness by alluding to another subject of considerable and increasing importance. I mean Africa. This matter is rising above the political horizon, and so far as I can observe, no power, whether of indi viduals or parties can stop it. The African Question is upon us, just as certainly as towards the close of the last century the Indian Question loomed on our forefathers. And it is interesting and curious to note the similarity of the objections raised against each of these two greatdevelopments. A policy of masterly inactivity, of keep ing within our shell, of not overweighting our country with an Eastern or an African Empire^— All these objections have been constantly urged, and as constantly overborne by the force of circumstances. The Empire has continued to expand, and Trade has never ceased to seek fresh routes, in spite of all that politicians and fears of Veu/^ Imperial responsibilities met* advanced Empire never stands still; and a mother might as well say that her \/\/ tti KVvvvty Ci infant shall never grow into manhood, as might Downing A S^yoot say that the United Kingdom shall cease from ex panding its Empire. So long as Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen are bom with their present energies and capacities, so long will they seek spheres of action for the practical application of those qualities over the surface of the globe. And they are right. Has it notbeen by similar aptitudes that civilization has everywhere and through all time, spread? And if in the process of time, development occasional unavoidable conflicts A have occurred, the general result has none the less been good and in accordance with the laws of nature. Even in ray span of service I have watched the Indian Empire develop to a considerable extent, and in a manner essential to its safety. Where should we be now if instead of having ^ $ - a strong and scientific frontier along the north of /N British India, we had the Punjab and Scinde awaiting as armed States any opportunity for aggressions into our adjacent plains of Hindustan? But to resume the African Question. Is it suppos- able that it was in the decrees of Providence that the largest continent of the Old World, with all its millions of human beings, should lie for ever in a stateof savagedom and slavery, while neighbouring civilised nations are everywhere seeking commercial openings, and while statesmen in Europe with some conscience in what they do, could hold out the hand of leadership to the African races? I say no. But, whatever the reply to that question may be, the introduction of European modes of life and Government has advanced too steadily and too far into Africa to allow of abandonment or retreat. Look along the Northern Sea-board from Egypt to Tangiers and you will find France and Italy and Turkey and England all at work' or on the qui vive for the founding of Imperial interests. Turn southward from Tangiers to the Gape and you find France, Belgium, Portugal, England and Germany, persistently opening up the Atlantic shore line of that great Continent. Pause at the south ern extremity, the Cape of Good Hope, and you find theDutch and the English long established, and resolute in their colonizing efforts. Proceed northward along the Eastern coast, you again find the Portuguese, the French, the Gemans, the English, and the Italians, all occupy ing large tracts, whether as Protectorates or as Spheres of influence, until you reach the Straits of Babel-Mandeb and the south-western shores of the Red Sea, It is true that along the Eastern Coast you meet also the ruins of former settlements. Settlements which arose under great difficulties, when the Kingdoms that founded them still possessed their pristine energy, enterprise and courage: settlements whose decay may be traced to the loss of those qualities by their Imperial Governments, and to the de generacy of their subjects simultaneously with the shrink ing of their Empires. Which course shall we follow? Shall we, too, fear and shrink? Or shall we be strong and of a good courage, and like an Imperial race, fulfilImperial destinies? I, at least, am on the side of Empire, with all its risks and all its responsibilities. And the recent ratification of the Brussels General Act by all the Powers concerned looks as if International responsibilities were still considered to be of some weight in the world, ftw*. threat position everywhere implies and involves proportionate responsibilites and obligations. No doubt, everything, everywhere, whether individual, nation, or Empire, must eventually have an end, for nothing lasts, not even the globe, not even the solar system. But not the less should we strive to fulfil our Imperial destinies.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000001524.0x0003a4_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/25</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x0003a4</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/25</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Copy of the speech 'The Empire and its responsibilities' given by Lewis Pelly at the Hampstead Constitutional Club 06 April 1892</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1892/1892</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-06-12T00:05:58</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (20 folios)</extent><extent>The file has printed foliation in thetop right hand corner of the recto of each folio, with the exception of folio 1 where the foliation number has been inserted in pencil.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Typed copy of the speech 'The Empire and its responsibilities' given in support of Edward Brodie Hoare's campaign for re-election as MP for Hampstead with annotations and corrections in ink by Pelly.Pelly had been asked by Hoare to give a talk, which he believed was to be a 'parlour talk' to a few friends, until he discovered it was being advertised in the Times and other leading newspapers of the time.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x0003a4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
