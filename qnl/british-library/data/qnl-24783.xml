Your uelegram of 9th instant. Indian detenus at Malta, v/e have throughout borne in mind considerations urged by you and have been influenced by them in decision not to release dangerous agitators in India.* These considerations do not however apply equally to Mauiana Mahmud Hassan. We recognise the probability of a movement in India in favour of easy terns for Turkey but we thin^^b-Turkish agitation is more likely to draw strength from the Mauiana * s detention than from his release. Hitherto he has not been a publicist or a political agitator. In our opinion his release would on the whole have beneficial results and would gratify a large number of loyal Moslems on account M sanctity in which he is held. We do not think that it would give rise to an idea that our general policy towards Turkey is weakening. We should be glad to know if in consideration of these facts you are prepared to take course recommended in our telegram of 3rd December.f't I Ml ''I/ 1 1 ?. £673. ? &gt; SXfRACT LETTER PROM WAR OFFICE TO INDIA OFFICE.

He was concern- ed wi. th ^4-kh^ letter^, conspiracy in pursuance of which he left India and got into touch with Turks at Mecca and Medina. A brief account of him will be found in para 164 of Rowlatt Committee Report. Release would we consider be regarded as act of clemency 'oy all Moslems in India, amongst whom he commands great respect as religious leader. His associates at Malta may also be repatriated with exceptions of Husain Ahmed Madin who claims to be Turkish subject, win y 0 u pndljs issue necessary instructions for their release and repatriation ? It is desirable that their return should be unostentatious and there should be no public action contemplated. Desirable that release should be effected as early as possible.

Simla, 29th May, 1918. My dear Burn, Many thanks for your letter of 15th December last from Malta. Your reports on Maulana Mahmud Hasan and his companions have been most useful and I am very grateful for all the trouble you have taken. I entirely agree with your conclusion that we cannot have these men back in India at present and that they should remain in Malta. It will interest you to know that the Central Bureau which has been established at BeIni to agitate for the release of Muhammadan internees has just published a pamphlet on Mahmud Hasan’s case. It affects to disbelieve all the charges brought against him and ascribed his internment mainly to his refusal to sign a fatwa justifying the Sharif's revolt. It is very bitter against the Sharif for handing over Mahmud Hasan to the English. The Government of India is considering how -o deal with it. If convenient to you I will settle with you over money matters when you return to India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) C .R. CLEVELAND. :n Esq.. I.C.S., C.b.i., C/o Grindlay and Company, 54.

Mr Burn, who has now arrived in England, has handed to this Office a number of vernacular letters (enclosed herewith) with a request for their transmission to Maulana Mahmud Hasan, one of the prisoners in question. The circumstances in which these letters were written are explained in the iry enclosed statement 4# Mr Burn dated the 15th January 1918.

Please see your B.O.No.2549, dated the 19th ultimo, on i the subject of Burn’s interviewing the internees at Malta on his way home. I went to Lucknow and met Burn on the 30th and 31st ultimo. I find Burn, who represents the U.P.Government in this matter, is in entire agreement with me as to the nature of his interviews and communications with the internees, he will go to Malta to find out and report how Mehmud Hasan and the four fellow internees are getting on, how they are being treated, what their attitude is, and what, if anything, they have to say for themselves. He will not offer them any kind of promise or require them to give any kind of undertaking. If they are repentant they can spontaneously make any requests they like to Burn, and he will forward them for the consideration of Govern ment. Burn thinks that it is very fckx unlikely that Mahmud Hasan is repentant. The old gentleman decided in favour of hiirat and iehad after mature reflection, his ideas as to the duty of a .good Mussulman were changed by the events of the Balkan Wars and by the Cavmpore Mosque excitement. The war with Turkey and even the instigation of the arch vil lain Obedulla had a prepared soil to work upon. His arrest and incarceration in a prisoners of war camp have probably hardened and not softened the old man. Besides this, one at least of his companions is a really dangerous fanatic, Anzer Gul. Under all these circumstances, Burn thinks it will be quite unwise to give the old man or his companions any definite opening ^or refusing an offer from Government and accompanying their refusal by a declaration in favour of the Islamic faith, all of which would doubtless be in time reported to India and made public. On all these points I am in entire agreement with Burn, and we ♦ ' may safely entrust the mission to Burn witnout more instructions than are to be derived from a perusal of this letter, a copy of which I propose witb/iyour consent to send up to him.I understand the ordinary P &amp; 0 steamer, by'which Burn will sail, will call at Malta. Bum is making certain of this, and, if he finds this is not the case, he will refer the mat ter further so that we may make the necessary arrangements ior Bum's visit to Malta. Burn expects that his work in Malta will keep him a. week or ten da.ys, a~ter which he will desire to get to England as (quickly as possible, I have u-old him that if he wires to us from Malta, we will do our best to facili tate his getting home from Malta in any possible way. I think it desirable that the Government of India should wire to the Secretary of State informing him of Burn’s mission to Malta and asking to arrange that the authorities at Malta should give Burn facilities for interviewing the internees. Perhaps, however, you might prefer to await Mr.Montagu’s arrival before doing anything in this direction. Bum does not sail till about the 18th instant, so there is plenty of time. * I am arranging to give Bum copies with photographs of papers that he is likely to need. Copy of D.O. letter dated the 2nd November 1917 from the * Hon.

If the ,-aulana thinks India is Bar ul Harb it ie his own opinion and he may follow it. I do not share it. ' YHe i-laulana's wish to leave India was due mainly to dicseneions at Deo bad. There was talk of ill-feeling even when I was studying there. I never re-visited the place afterwards• The J array a t -ul -Ansar was one of the causes of the strife. The objects of that isociation were to improve the management of the college. This implied limitations of the powers of the Mohtamlm (Superintendent). Muhammad Ahmad resented this. A split occurred. The haulana kept apart from both factions* He said that people should work honestly and do their duty, (i.e. without compulsion). I did not join the association. It was being iformed while I was at the College. The rule was that old students that subscribed money and accepted the tenets could join. I did not join at first as I was still a student and not eligible. Afterwards 1 refused to join as the effect of the association was to cause a breach in the College, and I did not like that. The-association was formed by ybaid-Ullali, who had passed out before I went there. Meetings were held in Deobaml, MOractabad and Meerut to discuss the association and Its objects were generally approved. I saw Ubaid-Ullah only once. Hems then mud arris at Karachi and came over to form the society. Au^er Cul was a student after my time and I had not seen him before I went to 1 ecca nor had x seen Husain Ahmad nor Wahid before. Husain Ahmad*a ther lived in Medina and I believe he is quite settled there but I do not know completely about hie [affairs. I was for_a month or two in Delhi at the Fatehpuri ^esjld, reading under M.Manjaat All, now dead. That was between my studies at Lahore and at Deoband* I have heard of Ubaid—Ullah»s school at Delhi, qui rat-ul-Quran or Jatiis-ul-uuran, but never went there. When the quarrel at Deab&amp;nd grew hotter Ubaid-Ullah removed the head office of the Janayat- ui-Anzar to Delhi. Then trie Uohtanin issued a Fatwa that Ubaid-Ullah had become a kafir* This was before kaulana left. I read of it in the papers Paisa Akbar,' ^amdartl, etc. It was ell known a » a big meeting took place. I do not knovi where Utoa 1 d —U1 lah is now, I nave not heard the Maulana speak of him* He (kaul&amp;na) left the College because of the quarrels. He was afraid that if they went on Muhammadans might insist on turning out the dohtanira, subscriptions would go down and the College would ruined.

This was my second visit, had not made up my mind finally to perform Hijrat. I wished to see i whether tha Hedjaz suited me for my life work, study and teaching and then to decide whether I would stay there for good. My former visit f s 40 years ago and I wanted to see whether conditions had changed. The Jamiyat ul Ansar was founded 7 or 8 years ago and two or three annual meetings took place. It was an association of old boys in tended to improve the teaching and management. History was not taught in the College. Ubaid Ullah and his friends wished to tench Arabic history not Indian. I did not approve of it. I thought it would have a bad effect. It was founded to promote piety and re ligion and bringing in a secular subject like history would injure it in the minds of its supporters. I told Ubaid Ullah and his friends they had no money. i’he school which was ior namaz raRza' would become an on inary school. after Ubsvio Ullah r ent away I did not see him till he came to the Jsmiyat. I did not . hold any conversation with him about political Blatters. I undsr- stanb that Govt.' hat suspicions about He. II I am allowed I would rather return now to India than to Mecca. My friends now know I am here and they are anxious about me. I should like.to go back to reassure them and tould then perform Hijrat, Husain Ahmad and Vahid would probably like to return to seeing. L nave not asked them. Husain Ahmad's father performed Hijrat 18 years ago. The Turks seized his family including his father S. Habibullah who has died recently. They were taken to Adrianople as they were looked on as Indians. Habibullah performed Hijrat as he was old and pious. He was not very learned but served for a number of -ears as Mamlvl in the Tends Govt. School. I never heard of any man called Khan % Bahadur from Hyderabad.

(conic!) in i ecca and turning them out. I refused. I said I was a stranger doing the Hajj and was not qualified to sign. They believ o j 4 ed I did not accept the fatwa and were angry. I do not know any other reason. They arrested me and sent me t- Jadda. I want to Taif. I saw Ghalib Pasha in ..ecca for a. few minutes, but had no special conversation with him. He gave me no paper. t sent no papers by Kuhammad .-‘ian. He was with me in the Haj j and went hack. I met Anvar Pasha, and Jamal Pasha in Medi/^na in the Shrine, hut got no paper from them. There was a big gathering. Hosain Ahmad made an address, as did others. I had gone with Husain Ahmad. A mufti introduced Hosain Ahmad to them and asked us to go too as we were with Hosain. They came up to us. 1 did not get papers fror: Anvar Bey or Jamal Pasha or give then, to Haji Shah 3o.kh%h or Ha]i Hasan, I made no enquiries in - ecca about the oath oi obe dience to the Turk taken by the Sharif, nor did I send any papers about that by Haji Shah Bakhsh. I have heard no news of Ubaid Ullah nor of Muhammad Mian, I never had any i idea oi going across the frontier to Kabul. I have never been there, Sow nor even to Peshawar. I do not remember seeing Abul Kalara. He came once to the Deoband School to a gathering, but I was ill and did not go. As people were going back to the station I saw Ajimal Khan with some others . • y house is in the way. ■ . t. ■■ t may have been ti ere but l did not know him. I did never heard of the amiyat Ksshullsh nor of the Bar ul Irshad. T have heard of the Naxarat ul muarif ul Quranin and have seen it. It was in the enclosure of the Patib- puri Mssjid and I knew Kaulana Abdis Rashid of Gugoh. I signed the fatwe that Indian Khfcammadans should be loyal to the iritish Govt. I never declared India a Dar ul Harb. Dar ul Islam has two mean ings. It may mean a country where the ruler is a Muhammadan and it may mean one where Muhammadans are allowed to exercise their religiousiaulana , alimud liasan, 11.1?,, 17. cor td. religious customs. Thus Indie may be considered Dar ul Islam or not according to the view taken cl the definition. .y own view is that as Muhammadans are allowed religious liberty in India, that country is not Bar ul Hart and jihad is not permissible (jaez) to inhabitants of India who owe fealty to government and hijrat is not imperative (J&amp;rs) . When the .Balkan war broke out we all felt sympathy for the Turks. I went to see Ohalib Pasha in : ecca though the British were at war with the Turks because he was a great man. Other Indians went to see him. (After more tj^alk on ge er&amp;l subjects said):- This place does not suit me. WimmMM doubts If Govt, would release i,e I should bo very grateful.

M?7 father v/as headmaster in the Tahsibi school at Tanda. He took a pea^s furlough in 131fi.H. and became a Muhajir. He never v/ent back. I ient to Deoband as a student in 1309.H. and stayed there till 1310.H. I irent with him and so did the whole family, women and children. The reason going was as follows. My family had a grant of 24 villages from f&amp;helilM King, I do not know which. It was before Oudh became a province &amp;t the time of the Mutiny there were about 18 or 19 left in the family. The Raja of Bhiti in Fyzabad was on bad terms with my family. ? T y maternal o^andfather Akbar Ali owed money to the Raja and there was a dispute about the amount. My paternal grandfather Pir Ali was a relation of Akbar Ali. At the time of the Mutiny they both died. They both lived in Allahabadpur near Tanda. As it was on the road from Fyzabad to Azanguali and troops passed, Akbar Ali thought it safer to take his family to a village he owned in the Basti district. When order was being restored he was bringing back his family. They were in one boat and he was in the other. They crossed safely hut his boat was upset, and he was drowned. When peace was restored there was no adult in all'my family. The Raja of Bhiti seized all our villages except Allah&amp;badpur and Jeorawanpur• My father sold them to other relatives when he left, keeping bnly his house. One of my uncles (mamu) Tafazzul Husain sued the Raja I believe, but had not enough money to press the suit and it failed. A younger brother of his, Abdul Ghafur, who was employed in a school was financing him. The Raja used witchcraft and Abdul Ghafur died of it. Tafazzul Husain died later leaving Zuwar Husain who is the hpspital Assistant. He was/Banda. My father brooded over his misfortunes and was also very religiously inclined, and that was 'hy no erd away. I went with him as he was my father. I have been to India three tines since. A Muhajir is permitted to leave the Hedjaz for a visit or for work, but not to change his residence. In 1319.H. I went to Gau ;ohg,c study with Maulana Rashid Ahmad. I returned in 1380.H. I visited ^a&amp;goh Deoband, my home, *oradabacl, Delhi, Bhopal. fuhi Ud tin was not Q&amp;zl ^nove at that tine. He was at Moradahad. I know bin an I went to ray hone only to s' ; e Tr| Y friends, not to do business. y second visit was in 132B.H. Mo reason was that mv wife who belonged to Fyzabad and went with me had mxed in Medina. Indians do not like marrying with Arab omen s o ^ father 1&lt; ?°^ + ne to India to marry again. When I got home my friends said they would not give rae a wifs unlees I agreed to renain in India. So I +1? h hraon, in the house of Hakim Shulam Ahmad.

My dear DuBoulay, please see your D.0.1 : o.254v, dated the l^tn ultinc, on subject of Burn f s interviewing the internees at Malta on his way hone. I went to Lucknow and net Burn on the 30th and 31st ultimo. I find Burn, who represents the d .i .Government in miis matter, is in entire agreement with me as to the nature of his interviews and communications with the internees. Ee will go to Malta to find out and report how Mahmud Hasan and the four fellow internees are getting on, how they are being treated, what their attitude is, and what, if anything, they have to say for them selves. He will not offer them any kind of promise or require them to give any kind, of undertaking. If they are repentant, they can b rontaneously make any requests they like to Burn, and lie will forward them for the consideration of Government. Burn thinks that it is very unlikely that Mahmud Hasan is repentant. The old gentleman decided in favour of 3ji irat and jehad after mature reflection. His ideas as to the dut] of a good Mussulman were changed by the events of the Balkan Bars and by the Gawnpore Mosque excitement. The war with Turkey and even the instigation of the arch villain Obedulla had a prepared soil to work upon. His arrest and incarceration in a prisoners of war damp have probably hardened and not softened the old nan. Besides this, one at least of his companions is a really dangerous fanatic Anzer Gul. Under all these circumstances, Burn thinks it will be edits unwise to give the old man or his companions any definite opening for refusing an offer from Government and accompanying their refusal by a declaration in favour of the Islamic faith, all of which would doubtless be in time reported to India and made public. On all these points I am in entire agreement with Burn, and we may safelv entrust the mission to Burn without more instructions than areare to be derived from a perusal of this letter, a copy of I propose with your consent to sene up to .aim. I understand, the ordinary P &amp; 0 Mail steamer, by \ehich Burn &gt; will sail, rill call at Malta. Burn is ia&gt;.inc certain of this, and, if he finds this is not the case, he will refer the natter further so that we ake the necessary arrange ients for Burn’s visit to Malta. Burn expects that his work in Malta will him a week or 10 days, after which he will desire to get to England as ouickly as possible. I have told him that, it he wires to us from Malta, we will do our host to facilitate his getting home from Malta in any possible way. I think it desirable that the Government of India should wire to the Secretary of State infor ming him of burn’s mission to Malta and asking; to arrange that the authorities at Malta should give Burn' facilities for interviewing the internees, perhaps, however, you might prefer to await Mr. Montagu 1 s arrival .before doing anything in this direction. Burn does not sail till about the 18th instant, so there is plenty of time. I am arranging; to give Burn copies with photographs of papers that he is likely to need. Yours sincerely, ill Sd. 0 ft.

Copy to / A£ct-c, The Under Secretary of State tor India, Political Department, INDIA OFFICE, S.W. Sir Your obedient Servant, K) h) ED to 26 FEB -AL DAL A;s&amp;m 1 t If SECRET. No. 3923/XL Dated the 7th December 1916. Dear Colonel Wilson, I am desired by Sir Charles Cleveland to write to you on the subject of a Muhammadan conspiracy which is now under enquiry in India. This plot which is in some ways nebulous but in others practical, has an important ramification in the Hedjaz, where resident and visiting Indians have been intriguing with Turkish officials. In the past we have had no facilities for acquiring information of the doings and sentiments of Indians in Arabia. From time to time we have inter cepted letters showing that some at least of the Indian residents of the Hedjaz were actuated by anti-British sentiments in going there and were likely to bring traitorous influence to bear on Indian pilgrims. During the war such intercepted epistles have shown that the Hedjaz has been a breeding ground for fanaticism and dis loyalty among the Indian residents and visitors. Before the Sharif’s rising and your appointment we were compelled to content ourselves with the odd scraps of infor mation which came from time to time into our hands through occasional loyal pilgrims returning from the Haj. Now that the Hedjaz is in presumfiably friendly hands and that we have you to watch over our interests in Jeddah, we hope that it may be possible to obtain more certain information of the doings of resident and visiting Indians in the Hedjaz. Sir Charles, however, knows that at present you are overburdened with very important work. Recently we have, through the enquiries and statements made in connection with the conspiracy referred to above, obtained a certain amount of information about Indian individuals, institutions and firms in the Hedjaz. This information is still scrappy, but Sir Charles believes that it may be of value to you and hopes at the same time that you may find it possible to verify and supplement it for our benefit. I am, therefore, sending you a skeleton outline of the case together with a separate note giving m detail our infor mation regarding the movements of the conspirators m the Hedjaz and of other Indians there who may or may not be concerned with the conspiracy or ill disposed towards us. Sir Charles Cleveland would be most grateful for any information you could give us on the broad subject of Indians in the Hedjaz with special reference to the facts, persons, institutions and firms mentioned in the accompanying notes. Yours sincerely, Y. VIVIAN, Assistant Director of Criminal Intelligence. To Colonel C. Wilson, Pilgrim Officer, Jeddah. STOCr I ii vImmrnamMMmm Summary of the “ Silk Letters Case. ® T^ e conspiracy now under reference is known to us for the sake of convenience the “ Silk Letters Case ” owing to the fact that our more intimate knowledge of tt as a whole was due to the interception, in August 1916, m course o t-n—n from the conspirators in Kabul to the conspirators in the Hedjaz, of three written on yellow silk. 2.

Comparatively recently it has come to light that the latter was the case and that the leading spirit in the students’ M. Obeidullah, the head of the movement. exodug wag one Maulyi 0beidullah ^ in concert with Abul Kalam Azad of Calcutta, the notorious pan-Islamic Maulvi, and some Wahabi leaders, is now known to have financed and launched the enterprise. Maulvi Obeidullah is a converted Sikh of the Punjab, who was educated in the Deoband College, Saharanpur, United Provinces. On leaving the college he spent twelve years in Sind where he became influential and founded schools of fanatical tendencies. He then returned to Deoband, where he became a professor and found ed the Jamayat-ul-Ansar or Deoband Old Boys ’ Association, an ostensibly harmless society which was, it now seems, intended for seditious purposes. While a professor at the Deoband College, M. Obeidullah was successful in undermining the loyalty of several of the staff, including in particular one Maulana Mahmud Hasan, Head Master, a most influential dlim, who will appear later in the case. M. Obeidullah was eventually dismissed from the college, owing to differences among the staff, and, settling at Delhi in 1913, became a close friend of the well- known pro-Turk Muhammad Ali of Rampur, Editor of the Comrade. Obeidullah also founded an Arabic school at Delhi called the Nazdrat-ul-Muarif-ul-Qorania, AVhich, recent information suggests, was intended as a headquarters for pan- Islamic intrigue. 6. To return to the course of events: In June 1915 one Maulvi Saifur Rahman, ■%r a -t tj i , t ^ . a P rofessor in the Fatehpuri Mosque, Delhi! M. Saifur Kahman s Mission to Independent j • i iii i c 1 , , ’ Territory&gt; 1 disappeared suddenly and was found after wards to have crossed the North-West Frontier into Independent Territory. M. Saifur Rahman promptly attached himself to the Haji Sahib of Turangzai, a crazy but influential fanatic of the Peshawar District, who had migrated to Independent Terriotry, and worked upon him to tour the border line in an unceasing effort to raise the standard of jihad. That he was successful was proved by the events leading to the engagement at Rustam on August 15th, 1915, in which some of the Hindustani Fanatics were killed, and by the subsequent unrest and hostility of the tribes on our borders traceable to the Haji Sahib’s efforts. Though it was unknown at the time, it has since been ascertained that M. Obeidullah was again responsible for Saifur Rahman’s mission which was an integral part of the conspiracy. 7. In the same month, i.e., June 1915, Maulvi Obeidullah himself disappeared nr rvu u A ^ u i j r .i- from official ken and has not since been M. Obeidullah s flight to Kabul and Indian • -p . . , T j- 'itt , ~ intrigue there, August 1915, and after. Seen m iDritlsh India. We now know that after a few months’ stay in Sind, where he rubbed up his previous conrections, consulted his seditious friends and made his arrangements for communication, he made his way with a party of allies via Quetta and Kandahar to Kabul, where he arrived about the 8th October 1915 joining up with the Lahore students (paragraph 2) who had by that time reached Kabul, and with a Turco-German mission, headed by the two renegade Indians, Mahendra Pratap and Barkatullah. Maher.dra Pratap and Barkatullah had journeyed to Kabul via Berlin and Constantinople with letters from the Kaiser and Sultan for the pur pose of persuading Afghanistan to attack India. Here in Kabul a number of consul tations took place between the Indian conspirators in Kabul and Sardar Nasrulla Khan and the war party in Kabul. Anti-British missions were also sent to Russian 1 urkistan, Constantinople and Berlin. A good deal of correspondence also took place between the conspirators in Kabul and their confreres in India, which cul minated in the capture in August 1916 of the silk letters on the person of one of the Lahore students (see paragraph 2) who was acting as a messerger. 8. In the meanwhile (in September 1915) two parties of distinguished maulvis L M , tt &gt; I**- • , ., u- ,. of the Deoband College set out for the September 1915. liectjaz. it was rumoured that their in tention was to do hijrat and that their journey was actuated by hostile feelings towards Government. There was a further rumour that they were to meet and consult certain Turkish officers in the Hedjaz. But no definite information was received in time to warrant their deten tion in India and the two parties set out from Bombay after an enthusiastic send off, Maulvi Khalil Ahmad and party on September 8th, 1915, Maulana Mahmud 3The conspiracy as a whole as betrayed by the Silk Letters. Hasan (vide paragraph 5) and party on September 18th, 1915. Later in the autumn of 1915 and in the spring of 1916 certain members of these parties returned to India, but none were examined until the silk letters obligmgly acquainted us with the details of M. Obeidullah’s conspiracy and of Maulana Mahmud Hasan’s connection with it. The members of the conspiracy were to be called “ Al Janud-al-Rabbania ”or the “ Army of God ” in which all members were to receive military titles. The prin cipal centre was to be Medina, where M. Mahmud Hasan of Deoband was appointed “ Al Quaid ” or “ General.” Secondary centres were to be Constantinople, Tehran and Kabul. At Kabul M. Obeidullah was to be “ Officiating General.” The object of the “’Army ” was to create a union among Islamic kings with a view to the liberation of Islamic countries under infidel rule with particular reference to India. M. Mahmud Hasan was to get into touch through the Hedjaz with the Ottoman Government, to persuade that Government to certain conditions, the ful filment of which would cause the Afghan Government to go to war with the British. The officers of the “ Army ” in Kabul were in their turn to intrigue to the same end with the anti-British party in Afghanistan and to keep the Independent tribes in a state of constant hostility to the British. Meanwhile the conspirators in India were to collect money (presumably through the old Wahabi organisation) to finance the conspiracy in Kabul, India and the Hedjaz, while at the same time they were to stir Indian Muslims into a fervour of fanaticism, which would be ready to burst into a blaze on the outbreak of war between Afghanistan and India. A list of the nffieers of the “ Army ” was attached, from which it was plain that the directing energy in the plot Jas that of M. Obeidullah. The officers of the “ Army ” fell clearly into four groups : (i) Obeidullah’s fanatical friends, followers and relatives in Sind and their connections in other parts of India ; (ii) the Deoband, United Provinces and Delhi group of maulvis, etc., whom Obeidullah had brdught under his influence while a professor at Deoband, and through his associations, the Jamayat- ul-Ansar and the Nazarat-nl-Muarif-ul-Qomnia Me paragraph 5); (m) the Wahabi fund collectors of Bihar, United Provinces, Punjab and b,orth-West Frontier Province ; and (iv) the well-known pan-Islamic leaders. The “ Army of God ” scheme was to be combined with a second association called the “ Provisional Government of India,” not essentially Mussalman m personnel, of which the “ President ” vas to be B Maher dra I ratap Me para- vranh 71 the “ Prime Minister ” Maulvi Barkatullah Me paragraph 7) and the “ M nister for India ” Maulvi Obeidullah. The objects of the association seem to have been to manipulate a collision between India and Afghanistan, and to intrigue generally with enemy or neutral countries by sending missions composed of Indian malcontents in Afghanistan. In short Obeidullah s scheme was to make use of the only living bodies among the dry bones of mihtanP Islam in India and he thus combined m his plot the practical machinery of the Maha i movement the Islamic fervour of the Maulvi class, and the political energy and bitterness of the pan-Islamists. His scheme was further to ^ ^^’MBTch in unity with a separate conspiracy (the Provisional Gmer.,ment ) should keep on his side the revolutionary elements among tne Hindus. 9 The recovery of these letters which were addressed to “ Maulana Mahmud 9.

Ghalib Pasha said that the Turks were fully engaged in other parts and could neither send help to Afghanistan nor armies to India. He did, however, give a firman of jihad to the Maulana which was sent to India by M. Muhammad Mian, a member of the party who returned to India in January 1915, and is said to have been used wth great effect in setting up the fanatical tribes in Independent Territory. It was also copied and circulated in India. Both Maulvi Mahmud Hasan and M. Khalil Ahmad are also believed to have had private audiences with Jamal Bey and Enver Bey in the Hedjaz some time in 1916, but nothing further is known about these meetings. M. Khalil Ahmad *Mecca we now find. returned to India in September 1916, while H. v. b. s. Mahmud Hasan and a few select members of his party stayed behind in the Hedjaz and are presumably still in Medina.* M. Mahmud Hasan had at one time some idea of going to Constantinople from the Hedjaz, but we do not think that he has yet carried out his design He was until lately in Mecca. V.

He tried to get enlisted in the Turkish Army on this occasion at Medina, but failing built a house there and persuaded the Maulvis Khalil Ahmad and Mahmud Hasan to open it as a school. He afterwards left Medina and went towards Syria with the object of joining the Turkish Army. Said to be very fanatical. Mentioned in the “ Silk Letters.” (vii) Abdullah, sweet-seller in Mecca.—An entertainment was given at this man’s shop by his relation who has a dirzi’s shop near the Madrasa Saulatya in Mecca to M. Khalil Ahmad’s and M. Mahmud Hasan’s parties. We know nothing of Abdulla or of his relative the dirzi, but it is possible that they are Indians and are perhaps utilized by the conspirators. (viii) Munshi Azizuddin.—^-employee of Messrs. Turner Morrison and Co., settled and married'in Mecca. This man gave a dinner in honour of the Maulvis’ parties. He afterwards helped to arrange a meeting between the conspirators and Ghalib Pasha, Wali of Hedjaz. We know nothing further about this man, but he seems important. (ix) Safdar Husain or Haidar Husain, a rosary-dealer in Mecca.—This man wuth No. (viii) above arranged the meeting of the conspira tors with Ghalib Pasha, Wali of Hedjaz. He afterwards brought the firman from Ghalib Pasha to the conspirators. We know nothing further about this man, but he seems an important conspirator. (x) Hurmatullah, son of Wali Ullah, of Odessa, or Kazan, Russian Turk- istan.—Was a student at the Deobard College, United Provinces, in 1910 and an associate there of some of the conspirators in the present case. Hurmatullah went to the Pledjaz a year or two earlier than M. Mahmud Hasan and Khalil Ahmad, but joined up with them there. He is presumably a member of the conspiracy, as he is mentioned in the Silk Letters. He is probably still in the Hedjaz. (xi) Ahmad Jan of Russian Turkistan.—Was at the Deoband College with Hurmatullah [No. (x) above] with whom he lived, All the remarks regarding Hurmatullah apply equally to Ahmad Jan. (xii) Muhammad Kasim, particulars unknown.—Was recently sent from India to the Hedjaz to take messages or money to M. Mahmud Hasan. He may have left India about September 10th, 1916. This'man may simply have been utilized by the conspirators without being involved. It is not certain that he actually set out. (xiii) Muhammad Masud or Masud Husain, son of Mazhar Husain, of Deoband, Saharanpur, United Provinces.—This man left Bombay for Jeddah on or about 10th September 1916. He was carrying a sum of money and messages to M. Mahmud Hasan. Has recently returned to India and has admitted taking money and messages from the conspirators in India to M. Mahmud Hasan. 7{xiv) Ehsan Ullali.—An Indian who has been living in Medina for some time. Said by M. Khalil Ahmad to be engaged by the Turkish Police as a detective, and to have brought about a spy hunt in Medina in course of Which some Indians were charged with being British spies. We know nothing of this man’s parentage or residence. He seems dangerous to British interests. (xv) Maulvi Bahmutullah, an Indian Maulvi settled in Mecca.'—M. Khalil Ahm ad describes this m.an as a most influential theologian to whom great respect is shown by the Hedjaz authorities. He is said once to have been summoned to Constantinople and to have obtained an audience with the Sultan Abdul Hamid. We know nothing of his parentage, birth place or political leanings. {xvi) Ahmad Kaza Khan, Maulvi, of Bareilly, United Provinces.—Seems to have been settled in the Hedjaz for some years. He is described as an enemy of the Saharanpur School of Maulvis and to have caused trouble to M. Khalil Ahmad on previous hays on this account. {xvii) Maulvi or Qari Abdul Haq .—An influential Indian settled in Mecca who runs a school in Babi Ibrahim which is subsidised by Bhopal State and Egypt. Abdul Haq may be a Bihari Muhammadan as it is said the Bengali pilgrims usually become his murids on going to | Mecca. \xviti) Abdur Rahman of Jullundur, Punjab.—Was previously a student in the Deoband College, but has been in the Hedjaz for several years. He was reading in the Madrasa Saulatya when the Maulvis’ parties reached Mecca in Septem.her-October 1915. He visited the Maulvis and assisted their parties in arranging their stay at Mecca. (xix) Sheikh Shamsuddin or Dr. Shamsuddin, a resident of Hyderabad District, Sind, and son-in-law of Sheikh Abdur Rahim, important conspirator in Sind.—Sold his estate in Sind a year or two ago and settled in Medina. Appears to be rich and influential. . Was men tioned in some very seditious letters intercepted in India from the Hedjaz in 1915. Haji Shah Baksh [No. (v) Khalil Ahmad’s party, paragraph 1, this note] brought back some business letters from Shamsuddin on return to India in September 1916. (xx) Pir Khan Muhammad of Kam.aro, Taluk.a Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Sind.—Left India for the Hedjaz with Khalil Ahmad’s party in Sep tember 1915 and has now settled in Medina where he seems to be associated with Dr. Shamsuddin [No. {xix) above.] Haji Shah Baksh [No. (v) Khalil Ahmad’s party] seems to have been his special companion. The latter brought back business letters from Khan Muhammad on his return to India in September 1916. Pir Khan Muhammad’s views are unknown, but his association with Shah Baksh implies that he is anti-British. (xxi) Abdur Rahim or Muhammad Rahim, Sindhi, of Matiari, Hyderabad District, Sind.—Left India for the Hedjaz in 1914 and appears to have settled at Medina. Evidently a fanatic from letters inter cepted from him in February 1915. He left in company with one Ahmad, son of Muhammad Saleh, Sindhi, of Hyderabad, Sind, who also, it would appear, is violently anti-British. Among the eftects of Haji Shah Baksh [No. (v) Khalil Ahmad’s party] was recently found the following fanatical declaration . “ I do hereby declare that I, Ahmad bin Muhammad Saleh, Hyderabad!, shall accompany Haji Abdur Rahim Sahib vnenever he leaves here with known good intentions and With God s help will ne\er turn back or come again into the country of the Kaffirs. Dated 24th Rabi-us-Sani, 1331.” Ahmad is believed to have joined the Turkish Army. (xxii) Ahmad, son of Muhammad Saleh, Sindhi, of Hyderabad, Sind. See No. (xxi) above. 8I (xxiii) Sheikh Ahmad Siraj, Sindhi, of Hyderabad, Sind.—Settled in Medina. It is unknown how long he has been in the Hedjaz. Haji Shah Baksh [No. (v) Khalil Ahmad’s party] went to see this man at Medina and may have taken letters to him from the conspi rators in Sind. From letters intercepted in February 1915, it appears that Muhammad Madin, the son of Sheikh Ahmed Siraj, joined the Turkish Army in 1915 in company with No. (xxii) above. (xxiv) Muhammad Madin, son of Sheikh Ahmad Siraj.—See (xxiii) above. (xxv) Sheikh Mohiuddin of Kashmir. Settled in Mecca for last 50 years and has a large following.—At instance of Ghalib Pasha, Wali, this individual preaches jihad against the British Government to Kash miri pilgrims. (xxvi) Maulvi Badruddin of Bengal. Migrated to Mecca some 17 years ago.—Is a student in the Allahabadi Islamia Madrasa. Is said to preach jihad to Indian pilgrims at the instance of Ghalib Pasha. (xxmi) Maulvi Abdur Eahman, Indian. Migrated to Mecca some 6 years ago—Is a muallim in the Harim. Is said to preach jihad to Indian pilgrims at the instance of Ghalib Pasha. (xxviii) M. Tayyab Ali of Bengal. Migrated to Mecca some 20 years ago — Is a mualhm m the Harim. Is said to preach jihad to Indian pilgrims at the instance of Ghalib Pasha. (xxix) Haji Ghulam Haidar Khan, of Bahawalpur, now in Medina.—Was sent money in April by Bahawalpur State through firm of Ali Jan and Company of Delhi, a firm suspected of remitting funds to the conspirators. (xxx) Saiyid Shaukat Husain, now in Medina.—Remarks regarding No (xxix) apply. 6 5 (xxxi) Qazi Shakir Muhammad, son of Hafiz Sher Muhammad of Khannur Bahawalpur State.- M as sent Rs. 500 through Ali Jan end Con/ pany m April to distribute in charity. We should like'to know something of this man’s doings in the Hedjaz and how he distributes ins charity. 3.

J (x) Maulvi Mahmud of Aligarh or Bulandshahr, United Provinces — Remarks regarding No. (mi) apply also to this man. (xi) Maulvi Kosar Ali, of Nagina, Bijnor, United Provinces.—Was a fellow- student of M. Mahmud Hasan at Deoband. Remarks resardum No. (vii) apply also to this man. • g (xii) Maulvi Niaz Ahmad, residence unknown.—Remarks regarding No. (vii) apply also to this man. All these maulvis visited and entertained M. Khalil Ahmad and M. Mahmud Hasan during their stay in Mecca. It would be most interesting to know whether this school has a political atmosphere or not. Our papers suggest that it has been used to disseminate sedition among Indian pilgrims and we should therefore like to know all the information obtainable regarding the institution and its staff, as also of the school run by Qari Abdul Haq in Babi Ibrahim, Mecca, vide No. (xvii), paragraph 2 of this note. (b) A school at Medina, name unknown, run by Maulvi Husain Ahmad Madni, an Indian of the United Provinces. The persons who seem to be connected with this institution are as follows : — (i) Maulvi Husain Ahmad Madni, son of Habibullah of Fyzabad District, United Provinces.—The family migrated to the Hedjaz in 1899. Husain Ahm.ad is said to have become very influential as a mudaris in Medina. He is the uncle of Abdul Wahid [No. (viii) of M. Mahmud Hasan’s party.] Husain Ahmad met and housed the two parties at Medina and seem.s to have been in very close touch with them. He also got for M. Mahmud Hasan an introduction to Enver Bey’s father who arrived in the Hedjaz, while the maulvis were there, with the mehmal. Husain Ahmad seems a disaffected and dangerous man. (ii) Maulvi Habibullah, father of (i). (Hi) Saiyid Hasan, brother of (i). (iv) Hakim Shafiq-ur-Rahman, of Ram.pur, United Provinces.—Settled in Medina and met the maulvis. It is not clear whether he is a member of Husain Ahmad Madni’s group. (v) Abdul Wahid or Wahid Ahmad, son of Siddiq Ahmad of Tanda, Fyz abad District, United Provinces.—Is the nephew of Husain Ahmad [No. (i)]. Went to the Hedjaz in 1915 with M. Mahmud Hasan and has now probably joined his uncle. 4. Financial arrangements of the conspirators. —Money seems to have been sent to the conspirators from India through the following firms : — (i) Ali Jan of Delhi.—The head of this firm in India is now Haji Abdul Ghaffar, son of Ali Jan. He is a staunch Wahabi and presumably the whole family adhere to the Wahabi tenets. There are two branches of Ali Jan and Co., in the Hedjaz : (i) Abdul Jabbar Abdus Sattar (the latter is now dead), and (ii) Abdullah Obeidullah. These persons belong to the family of Haji Abdul Ghaffar. Other members of the family in the Hedjaz are : Abdul Wahab, son of Abdul Jabbar ; aged 18 ; Idris, son of Ahsan-ul-Haq, aged 17, and Wahid, son of Ahsan-ul-Haq, aged 18—20. Another relative named Obedur Rahman has recently returned to India. There is some evidence that Abdul Jabbar was used as an agent by the conspirators in the Hedjaz. (ii) Haji Zain Ali Raza and Co., of Bombay and Jeddah.—This firm seems to have been used a great deal by Hakim Abdur Razzak, brother of the notorious Dr. An sari of Delhi for the purpose of financing the conspirators. We have again recently heard that money has been6 n sent by Jiundi through the firm of Haji Zamir-ur-Raza. We imagine that the two firms are identical', but are now verifying the point. An employee in the Jeddah office of Haji Zamir-ur-Raza and Co. is one Muhammad Imam, of Randher, Bombay Presidency. M. Mahmud Hasan’s party were given a letter to this Muhammad Imam by their friends in India and Muhammad Imam seems to have been let into the conspiracy. It would be most interesting to know fuller details of these firms’ business in the Hedjaz and to have full information about Muhammad Imam of the Jeddah office of Zamir-ur-Raza and.Co. 5. Correspondence. —The system of correspondence adopted between the con spirators in India and M. Mahmud Hasan in the Hedjaz is as follows : — Letters are to be addressed to Abdul Karim Kabuli or Saiyid Ba’ashar at Suakim. Thence they are sent by country boat to Muhammad Imam at Jeddah [see paragraph 4 {ii) ] who forwards them to their destina tion. The Censorship is on the look out for letters so addressed. 11 Q. M- Press, Simla—No. S70Cr—20-12-16.—30—B.A.SECRET Criminal Intelligence Office Eg. 3923/XI Delhi, the 8th December, 1916. My dear fforde, Many thanks for your letter of the 12th. ultimo enclosing information about Mahmud Hasan &amp; Co received from Yvil c on at Jeddah. By this post a printed copy of Vivian’s letter to Col. Yvilson has been «ent to you; however, I enclose another copy a* 3 @ duplicate in case you went to sen&amp; it on to anybody ei Q e. In your letter under reply you Q ay 'as Mahmud Hasan i« in Mecca shall we try to get him for you or would you rather not?' He have carefully considered this point; Mahmud Hasan is undoubtedly one of the mo^t venerable and generally rever ed Maulvis in northern India with a very large number of murids ; he i^, moreover, over 70 years of age. He has com mitted himself very deeply to a csu Q e of treasonable hostil ity to the British cause and it would be impo^ible not to deal severely with him if he were to return to In ia• * ^ take action, however, against such a venerable old gentleman standing as high a Q he does in the religious world, woulo cause a great deal of feeling and for once I am o^ opinion that it i a better that Mahmud Ha^an should not be sent back to India. In every other case that I have had to deal with concerning Indian ^editioni^ts or traitor* abroad I have al ways advised that *uch persons are le** harmful in India than outside but, a* I have said, I look upon trie ca*e of Maulana Mahmud Ha*an a* quite exceptional. Although we do not want Mahmud Hasan back in India we feel that it may be prejudicial to uie Sheiill s c - u wO leave him alone ir the Hedjaz. If the information we have sent to you and to Wilson, a* well a* local information, convinces the Sheriff that Mahmud Hasan and hi* co-conspira- tor* in the Hedjaz ought to oe dealt witn, ibe qu,, tiw - v.^l^ arise: What steps to take against them? On this point I '.egI to ^ugge^t for the consideration of the authorities concerned that if Egypt and the Sheriff were to decide that Mahmud Hasan and other hostile Indians now in the Hedjaz should he deported to Egypt and there Kept in confinement for the duration of the war, we, In India, would entirely agree. I have, however, no functional authority to convey such a suggestion to you, to the Egyptian authorities, or to Colonel Wilson: iry suggestion is made on my own initiative, conf irmed by the informal opinion of the Home and Foreign Departments. In view, therefore, of the want of formal authority behind my suggestion, it would be as well, if it meets with approval i i Egypt and is found sound and practicable by Colonel Wilson that before actual steps were taken to carry it through some authority, presumably the High Commissioner, should formally consult the Indian Government in the matter. Such a course would be, I think, in conformity with normal procedure. We are here of opinion that the deportation from the Hed jaz and confinement in Egypt of Mahmud Hasan and others could be carried out without very mucn publicity, whereas, it tney were kept in confineinent in the Hedjaz for a xong pei io - tacp might become interesting and exciting objects of pilgrimage or schemes for help or rescue to a number of fctna,tical Muhammadans i n India or Afghanistan. Such does not seem to be nearly so probable if they are confined in Egypt. I enclose one duplicate copy of this letter lor your own use in case you want it and a second duplicate which I shall be very much obliged if you,would forward to Colonel Wilson with such remarks as you may care to add.
