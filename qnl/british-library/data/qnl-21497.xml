( At end of Book.)@ REPORT ON OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN SOUTHERN DESERT ('IRAQ NAJD BORDERS). June, 1928 May, 1929. 1. The following report on operations carried out in the Southern Desert between the period June, 1928, tc May, 1929, is in continuation of the report on the operations carried out in the Southern Desert in connection with the 'Iraq-Najd Borders published by Air Ministry (C.D. 59), which covered the period November, 1927-May, 1928. 2. After the disbandment of Akforce on the 3rd June, 1928, referred to in the report quoted above, a period of quiet ensued, and, except as stated in para. 3 below, no movements of air forces in the Desert Area took place until December, 1928. 3. (i) A reconnaissance by aircraft and armed Tords was carried out at the end of July of the Rafafiya—Chabdah—Jalibah area. This was done as the Dhafir camped in that area had expressed their apprehension of being raided by Mutair. (ii) A reconnaissance in the latter part of September was made of the tracks Basrah—Busaiyah—Sulman—Shabichah and back to Basrah via Samawah and Ur. Ihis was undertaken primarily to test the practicability of using the new Morris six-wheelers as W/T tenders for Armoured Car Sections. 4. In order to avoid any misunderstandings with Najd during the Jeddah conference, orders had been issued in May that no cars or aircraft were to enter the neutral area, or to cross the 'Iraq-Najd or 'Iraq-Kuwait frontiers. 5. After the disbandment of Akforce the following 'Iraq Army units remained out in the Desert area :— Motor Machine Gun Company . . Lussuf. Two companies Infantry . . . . Shabichah. Two platoons . . . • • • Sulman. Two platoons . . . ■ • • Busaiyah. Of the above, the Motor Machine Gun Company and the Shabichah Garrison were withdrawn early in June, and the garrison of Busaiyah was reduced to one platoon. 6. As the negotiations with Ibn Sa'ud had broken down without any satisfactory agreement being reached, the Air (C554) Pk. 3124 7/30 250 Hw. (Gp. 1)4 Officer Commanding asked His Excellency the High Coifl missioner on 13th August for his concurrence in the following proposals :— (i) Busaiyah Garrison to be reinforced by one platoon, 'Iraq Army, forthwith. (ii) Permission to be granted to reconnoitre over Kuwait territory when necessary, and, in the event of a raid, to establish an advanced base in Kuwait territory, (iii) The armoured train to be prepared for action forthwith. 7. The reinforcement of Busaiyah was carried out by using two Victorias of No. 70 (Bomber) Squadron on 22nd August. Shabichah was re-occupied by the 'Iraq Army on 21st August. The armoured train had been manned the previous winter by a detachment of the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry. As this unit was shortly due to leave the Command without relief, arrangements were made for the train to be manned by a detachment of the 6th Battalion 'Iraq Army at Basrah. The train was sent on 5th October to Basrah, where the 'Iraq Army crew were put under training. 8. On 26th September, permission was received from H.M. Government, subject to the Sheikh's concurrence, for reconnaissances to be carried out over Kuwait territory in cases of real emergency. This authority was to be used as sparingly as possible, and the Sheikh was to be given no grounds for supposing that the R.A.F. had assumed responsibility for the defence of Kuwait, or that he himself had been relieved of any of his responsibilities in that respect. 9. Early in November, after the first heavy rains had fallen, the Dhafir and other shepherd sections from the Muntafik and Diwaniyah Liwas expressed a desire to move out into the desert, demanding, however, the same protective measures which had been afforded them during the previous year. This point of view was strongly supported by Captain Glubb, the Administrative Inspector of the Southern Desert, and, after some unavoidable delay, one platoon of the Motor Machine Gun Company arrived at Ur by rail on 20th November and pro ceeded to Busaiyah on the following day. The rest of the company proceeded to Shaibah, where training was carried out in conjunction with the Royal Air Force Armoured Car Sections. From this time until April one or more platoons of this company were continually out in the desert with the tribes in the forward area. 10. The first reconnaissance to enter the neutral area was carried out on 13th December at the urgent request of Captain Glubb, following reports he had received of movements5 raiding parties in the vicinity of A1 Wishah. The aircraft 1+ were instructed to fly high over the area in order not to draw fire. No signs of raiders were seen. 11. As raid rumours continued to persist, armoured car reconnaissances were carried out down A1 Batin as far as Abraj al Hibari, and on 23rd December a car section was sent to Busaiyah on detachment duty. 12. On 26th December an Armoured Car Section was sent from Hinaidi to Lussuf and Shananah to gain experience of the district, and at the same time to reassure the tribes grazing in that area. 13. On 27th December a flight of three Wapitis, with Captain Glubb as passenger, carried out a reconnaissance of the western part of the neutral area, where strong rumours placed a raiding party of Braih Mutair under Ali Ibn Ashwan. No signs of the raiders were seen. On the following day this flight took Captain Glubb to Jumaimah and Ath Thulaimah, where a landing was made, and some Zaiyad shepherds were interviewed. They said that they had been visited that morning by some strange camelmen, who were probably scouts of a raiding party. Captain Olubb ordered them to withdraw to the northward, which they did during the night. The air craft went on to Sulman for the night. On the morning of the 29th they left Sulman again with Captain Glubb to reconnoitre down Al Batin to Jumaimah. On reaching Ath Thulaimah, where the shepherds had been interviewed on the previous day, they found a party of about 130 camelmen answering the description of Ibn Ashwan's party. On sighting the aircraft the raiders fled in the direction of Jilbabi, and opened fire on the aircraft. Air action was, therefore, immediately taken against them. It subsequently transpired that a nephew of Ali Ibn Ashwan was killed a direct hit with a bomb, several other raiders were killed and wounded. This action had a pronounced effect on the tribes in that area, and at least two other parties of Mutair raiders who were approaching the 'Iraq frontier turned back on hearing of the fate which had befallen their comrades. THE UQUBBA INCIDENT ON 1st JANUARY, 1929. 14. Raiding on a minor scale, however, continued in the vicinity of the neutral zone, though reports indicated that these raids were carried out by opportunists with loot as their primary objective, and were not part of the major scheme in which Harb, Shammar, and Mutair sections were alleged to be co-operating. (C554) B*15. On 1st January, 1929, a party of Mutair attempted tcS attack the 'Usaidah section of the Zaiyad under Draiwil al Khalawi, who were grazing south of Rukhaimiyah. They were, however, counter-attacked and repulsed by the 'Iraq shepherds. Police cars also gave chase, but were unable to catch up with the raiders before the latter crossed the frontier. 16. In the meantime, rumours of a large concentration of raiders, including Harb, Shammar, and Mutair sections under the leadership of Muhsin al Firm, of the Harb, in the vicinity of Gaisuma, were becoming more definite. Reports of a circumstantial nature stated that Muhsin, himself with a large following, had camped at Gaisuma on 27th December, while war banners, believed to be those of Sultan Tbn Humaid ('Ataibah) and Nida ibn Nuhaiyir (Shammar), had been seen at Lina earlier in the month. 17. The entry of the Harb into the lists of potential raiders materially altered the situation, and, according to the majority of reports, it appeared probable that an attack would be launched against sections of the Anaizah confederation grazing in the Wadian area. This supposition was strengthened by earlier information to the effect that Ibn Sa'ud, under pressure of tribal opinion, had already given half-hearted acquiescence to an attack on the Dahamshah, whose allegiance he claimed as a Najdi tribe and whose presence on the 'Iraqi side of the frontier undoubtedly rankled. In addition, the Anaizah camels formed an exceptionally attractive target for a raid of this description. 18. Although, numerically, both the Amarat and Dahamshah were well armed and capable of self-protection, Mahrut Beg ibn Hadhdhal, Paramount Shaikh of the Amarat, was obviously apprehensive as to the outcome of any encounter between his following and the Akhwan. The fact that any Akhwan success against the Amarat would materially affect the safety of the trans-desert route, made it advisable to extend in a westerly direction the desert area already under regular observation by air patrols. 19. Accordingly, two flights of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron were sent to Karbala on 2nd January, 1929, to carry out reconnaissances from there, using Shananah as a temporary advanced base. The car section mentioned in para. 12 had already arrived at Shananah on 29th December, 1928, and another section left Hinaidi on the 2nd, and arrived at Shananah on 5th January. 20. At the request of H.M. King Faisal and the 'Iraq Government on 3rd January, 1929, the Air Officer Commandingover control of the whole desert area, including the administration of the tribes and all the Iraq forces, including police, in it. The 'Desert Area' was defined to include all forces'south and west of a line drawn through Rutbah-Karbala- Basrah. 21. In order to facilitate air reconnaissances in the Wadian area, where, as stated, the threatened attack on the Anaizah was most likely to materialise, it was decided to establish an advanced base at Nukhaib, which was to be held by a garrison of the 'Iraq Army. The 4th Battalion, less one Rifle Company and half Machine Gun Company, carried out this duty, pro ceeding by train to Karbala from Baghdad on 2nd January, and thence by motor transport to Nukhaib. The occupation of this post was completed on 5th January. As soon as the defences of the post were completed the garrison was reduced to one Rifle Company and half Machine Gun Company. 22. On 4th January the Armoured Car Section at Mosul was withdrawn to Hinaidi. to be available for use in the area of operations. 23. On 7th January one flight of No. 30 (Bomber) Squadron relieved one of the flights of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron at Karbala, and on the 14th the other flight of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron was replaced by a second flight of No. 30 (Bomber) Squadron. On 15th January one flight of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron proceeded to Sulman on detachment. On 17th January one of the flights at Karbala was withdrawn to Hinaidi. On 18th January the garrison of two Rifle Companies at Shabichah was relieved by one Rifle Company and half a Machine Gun Company. AJMAN RAID. 24. Unconfirmed reports had been received that Dhaidan ibn Hithlain, Paramount Sheikh of the Ajman, had set out from Hasa to aid 'Iraq or Kuwait tribes. Rumour placed this party at A1 Riqai on 19th January. On the 21st a man arrived at Kuwait and reported that he had met one of Ibn Hithlain's scouts just north-west of Jahrah. The scout announced that Ibn Hithlain's party was in the neighbourhood, and intended raiding 'Iraq and other tribes in the north-west part of Kuwait. Accordingly, Kuwait tribes were advised to close in on Jahrah. In addition an air reconnaissance was carried out along the northern border of Kuwait during the afternoon of 21st January, but no Akhwan raiders were to be seen. Shepherd tribes in the Jabal Sanan were, however, observed to be moving northwards.8 25. The same day two incidents definitely established thJ presence of at least one hostile band in Kuwait territory. The first occurred when two cars containing Mr. Crane, a dis tinguished American Orientalist, his son, and Mr. Bilkert, an American missionary, were fired on by twelve Akhwan horsemen in Kuwait territory about midway between Basrah and Kuwait town. Mr. Bilkert was killed, and the cars turned back to Basrah. The second and similar incident befell a British officer at A1 Abatah (30 miles north of Jahrah), where, at about 1400 hours local time, his car came under the fire of hostile raiders, who consisted of two parties, one of 40 men on 20 camels and a much larger one at some distance away. The officer managed to extricate himself, and returned to Kuwait. Both of these incidents took place in the same neighbourhood and about the same time. 26. This information was received too late for any action to be taken that day. On the 22nd a section of armoured cars was sent to Safwan before dawn, and air reconnaissances were carried out along the Traq-Kuwait frontier up to a depth of 15 miles into Kuwait territory. No signs of any raiders were seen. The flight of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron at Sulman was sent to Busaiyah to stand by for action if required. It subsequently transpired that a raid had taken place early on the 21st in the vicinity of Sail Jirfan, about 35 miles south of Zubair, in Kuwait territory. The victims were all 'Iraqis, and their casualties amounted to at least 17 killed, in addition to others wounded. Approximately 4,500 sheep and 500 donkeys were looted. The aggressors were identified as Ajjman, under the leadership of their chief, Dhaidan ibn Hithlain, and some of the Jiblan section of the Mutair. Most reports compute their strength at between two and three hundred men. Immediately after the attack they made off due south, through Kuwait territory, and it was then that they fired on Mr. Crane's party. 27. No reports of the raid were received till the evening of the 22nd, and then there was no indication as to the route taken by the raiders in their retreat. Had there been no restrictions on flying over Kuwait it is most probable that the raiders would have been found and dealt with on the 21st. As it happened, sufficiently reliable information to justify crossing the frontier and exceeding H.B.M. Government's instructions mentioned in para. 8 was not received until too late for effective action to be taken. It appears that the raiders with their loot spent the night of 22nd-23rd January at Umm Rus. On the 23rd an Armoured Car Section which had^een sent down A1 Batin to endeavour to cut off the raiders' retreat received information of the direction of their retirement, and proceeded with Captain Glubb to Umm Rus. On arrival there it was discovered that the raiders had left about hv e hours previously. Pursuit was impossible owing to the soft going and shortage of petrol. The section, therefore had to go into Kuwait to refuel, and then returned to Shaibah ln th ® meantime the raiders made good their escape across the r ajc border, and were able to distribute their spoils unmolested. 28 At this time rumours were current that Sultan ibn Humaid, Paramount Shaikh of the Ataibah, was at Artawiyah on his way north to raid 'Iraq tribes. Two sections of armoured cars were, therefore, maintained in the Ruhail-Abu Khuwaimah area where Captain Glubb was camped with the majority of the Iraq tribes, and daily air reconnaissances were carried out over this area and a few miles into Kuwait territory, ihis procedure was kept up till 4th February, when one car section was withdrawn to Basrah, and air reconnaissances were considerably curtailed. 29. The situation in the north-western area remained quiet •during the latter part of January, and the flight at Karbala was withdrawn to Hinaidi on the 26th, one Armoured Car Section remaining out at Nukhaib. 30 At this time the greater part of the 'Iraq tribes were immediately west of the Batin, with a portion of them along the northern frontier of Kuwait, having evacuated Kuwait territory after the raid on 21st January. Grazing, however was not plentiful in either area; it was good in and to the north of the neutral zone, and better in Kuwait. Accordingly, whilst many of the 'Iraq tribes were allowed to gravitate towards the neutral zone under recognised protection, those north and west of Kuwait were forced by economic pressure to commence a gradual movement into Kuwait territory, ihis movement could not be controlled on political grounds for, although warned that their defence could not be guaranteed, the shepherds considered that the threat of an Akhwan raid was in itself less to be feared than the inevitable starvation of their flocks should they continue to remain in areas compara tively immune from attack but devoid of the essential grazing. 31 Nothing of interest occurred during the early part of February, but on the 11th, reports, which subsequently strengthened, were received that Ibn Hithlain again intended to raid 'Iraq tribes in Kuwait territory. Consequently, on the 13th and 14th air reconnaissances were carried out over Kuwait territory as far south as Jahrah, and an Armoured Car Section, on being relieved at Adhaibah, returned to Basrah10 via Qarat al Murra and Aziyah. Nothing of importance waj4 seen on any of these reconnaissances. 32. Reports were also received at this time relating to a concentration of Ataibah and Mutair, under Ibn Humaid and Faisal ad Dawish respectively, at Jarrab, 40 miles north-west of Artawiyah. Information received on 17th February placed this force at Taiyib Ism, indicating that it was advancing towards the 'Iraq frontier. From approximately this place they were in an equally good position to strike out in the direction of the Batin, the centre of the neutral zone, or the Anaizah, in the Wadian area. That they might adopt the middle course and attack the 'Iraq tribes north of the neutral zone was given some preference by statements to the effect that tribes which were grazing just south of that area had been moved aside to clear a passage for the raiders. 33. A third concentration originally reported in the Hazul was later stated to be taking place 30 miles south of Linah, and to consist of Ruwallah, under the leadership of Farhan ibn Mashhur. This party was said to be only a small one, formed with the object of raiding the Dahamshah or other Anaizah sections in the Wadian area. 34. The foregoing was briefly the position of the Najd forces as visualised from available information, which emphatically stressed a threat against 'Iraq. In consequence, daily recon naissances by aircraft and armoured cars were carried out. Steps were taken to withdraw the 'Iraq tribes from forward and unprotectable positions to points where, in an emergency, they could be rallied with greater advantage for self-defence in co-operation with British and 'Iraq forces. 35. Two flights of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron were sent to Busaiyah on 16th February. On the same day one flight of No. 30 (Bomber) Squadron was sent to Nukhaib. An Armoured Car Section carried out a reconnaissance to Aziyah, and on the 17th moved on to Adhaibah, where it remained for several days with another section. Reconnaissances were carried out from there down Al Batin, and also to Abu Khuwaimah, where Captain Glubb was engaged in marshalling the 'Iraq tribes from the vicinity of the neutral area, prior to their concentration in northern Kuwait. 36. By the 20th the situation had quietened sufficiently for the two flights of No. 55 (Bomber) Squadron to be withdrawn from Busaiyah. It was still considered advisable, however, to keep a flight there for the time being, so a flight of No. 84 (Bomber) Squadron was detached from Shaibah for that duty. On the 22nd one of the Armoured Car Sections at Adhaibah was withdrawn to Basrah.11 37. Meanwhile, in the western sector there had been a substantial raid on 19th February just inside Najd territory by a large party under Sultan ibn Humaid. ihis force is said to have consisted of some 2,500 men from the Ataibah, and operated in three separate bands in the Gaisumah— Lauqah-Jumaimah area. Apart from attacks on Najd tribes or on those under the protection of Ibn Sa'ud, one of the bands under Muhammad ibn Jabrin (Ataibah) raided a section of an 'Iraq tribe, the Zaiyad, which was grazing in that area under the leadership of Talal ibn Jandil. This section had 13 men killed and one wounded, and lost some 10,000 sheep, 600 donkeys, and 20 tents. About the same time some 'Iraq cattle merchants were also attacked by this band, as a result of which 80 men were killed and 700 camels looted. After these incidents the whole of Ibn Humaid's force withdrew from this area. 38. On 24th February the approval of H.B.M's. Government was received for a proposal to send armoured cars as well as police and 'Iraq Army armoured cars into Kuwait territory to camp with the 'Iraq tribes who were grazing there. This was modified at the request of the Shaikh of Kuwait to include only British armoured cars and 'Iraq police cars. By the end of February the majority of 'Iraq tribes were concentrated in Northern Kuwait, the Administrative Inspector and one section of armoured cars being based at Umm al Madathah. Fifty tents of the Bani Malik, a small 'Iraq tribe whose normal habitat is in the Basrah-Zubair district, were, however, grazing in Southern Kuwait. Reports of Ibn Hithlain s raiding party being near the border alarmed these people, and they moved close up to the walls of Kuwait town. 39. On 2nd March reports were received that a party of Mutair were in the neutral area and were expected to raid the 'Iraq tribes in the Busaiyah-Sulman area. 40. On the morning of 3rd March information was received that at 0700 hours local time the Bani Malik had been attacked outside Kuwait town by about four to five hundred Akhwan under the leadership of Shakir ibn Shuqair and Hayif al Fughm, of the Mutair. The two flights of No. 84 (Bomber) Squadron at Shaibah were immediately sent out to attack, and an Armoured Car Section left Basrah and proceeded down the Kuwait road. In spite of a very strong south-easterly wind, the aircraft located the raiders at 1140 hours local time, 5 miles north of Warah. The Akhwan immediately opened fire on the aircraft, who replied by taking air action with good effect. The wireless operator in one of the aircraft was shot through the head during the attack and killed. The air attack12 lasted about 30 minutes, and the raiders were left hurrying towards the border in confusion. Owing to the strong wind it was too late for the aircraft to return to the attack after refuelling and re-arming. The armoured cars were unable to get in touch with the raiders owing to the very soft nature of the ground. The flight at Busaiyah could not be ordered away to attack in view of the threat to its own front. The raiders were fortunate, therefore, in escaping across the frontier without further losses. The Bam Malik losses were reported to be 27 men killed and 6,386 sheep, 670 donkeys, and 9 horses looted. The destitute victims were repatriated to Zubair via Basra by ship, the remnants of the tribal flocks being escorted back by 'Iraq police by road. 41. After this raid there were no further incidents involving the use of military forces, although police cars had several brushes with small parties of Mutair who were endeavouring to buy supplies in Kuwait. 42. On the 8th, some 40 Mutair horsemen tried to come to close quarters with a police car patrol near A1 Riqai. The cars manoeuvred round this party to see if they were the advanced guard of a raiding party. While doing so the horse men were reinforced from the direction of their camp some 8 miles to the southward in Najd territory. The police thereupon opened fire with their Lewis guns, killing three men and wounding several more. The police then retired north ward, followed for some distance by the horsemen, who, however, took care to keep well in the wake. 43. On 9th and 10th March the 'Iraq tribes in Kuwait moved further south to get better grazing, and the car section and Administrative Inspector's camp remained about 5 miles north of Jahrah till the end of the month. 44. During this period, increased activity on the part of Mutair sections encamped south of Kuwait, the arrival of Ibn Sa ud at Buraidah, and news of Ibn Jiluwi's projected advance against the 'Ajman in the Hasa district indicated that, though affairs on the 'Iraq frontier had lapsed into temporary quiesence, serious internal disorders were liable to take place in Najd, which might have a reactionary effect on the 'Iraq side of the frontier. 45. An agreement was known to exist between Faisal ad Dawish (Mutair) and Sultan ibn Humaid ('Ataibah) for mutual support against Ibn Sa'ud, and advances had also been made with a view to forming a triple alliance with the renegade Ajman in Northern Hasa under Dhaidan ibn Hithlain.13 4f). In order to maintain close touch with the situation in ^me south, a special service officer and a W/T station were sent to Kuwait by Victoria on 11th March. 47. Early in April, news was received at Kuwait of a crushing defeat inflicted by the forces of Ibn Sa'ud on the rebel 'Ataibah and Mutair in the vicinity of Sibilla on 30th March. Faisal ad Dawish was reported to have escaped from the scene of battle with his life, and to have fled, seriously wounded, to Artawiyah ; Sultan ibn Humaid was reported imprisoned in Riyadh. 48. With the leaders of the rebel movement vanquished, the threat of further attacks on the 'Iraq frontier became negligible and following the normal retirement of the Muntafik and Diwaniyah tribes to the riverain area, the withdrawal of R.A.F. advanced units commenced. On 3rd April the flight of No. 84 (Bomber) Squadron was withdrawn from Busaiyah to Shaibah. On 5th April the Armoured Car Section at Nukhaib was withdrawn and returned to its permanent station, Mosul. 49. On 7th April the 'Iraq tribes in Kuwait began a general withdrawal towards Safwan. The Armoured Car Section remained near Jahrah till the 18th when it moved to Rodhatain. The majority of 'Iraq tribes were then clear of Kuwait territory, and the section returned to Basrah on the 2()th. On the same day the flight of No. 55 (Bombsr) Squadron at Sulman was withdrawn to Hinaidi. 50. The flight at Nukhaib was withdrawn to Hinaidi on 12th April, and, owing to the scarcity of water there, the 'Iraq Army garrison was reduced to half a Machine Gun Company and four Lewis Gun Sections, the Rifle Company, less Lewis Gun Sections, moving to Karbala. 51. In concluding this report it is worthy of note that although between the months of December, 1928, and March, 1929, the 'Iraq frontier from the Wadian area to the Persian Gulf—about 600 miles in length—was threatened by Akhwan raiding parties at one time or another throughout practically its whole extent, only one raiding party actually violated 'Iraq territory. This was on 28th December, 1928 (vide para. 13), and that raiding party was immediately attacked from the air and put to flight before it had time to do any damage. It is considered that this provides further evidence of the efficacy of the scheme of defensive posts in the Southern Desert as advanced bases and intelligence centres. (C554)14 INDEX TO APPENDICES.

[d] The whole group worked on (1,550 metres). {e) In the event of atmospherics rendering communication impossible on long wave, Shaibah was able to communicate with Baghdad on short wave, employing a frequency of 6,950 kilocycles (43-16 metres), this being the normal command atmospheric routine. (/) Except on a few occasions when continuous watch was ordered, stations kept the watchkeeping periods as laid down in Confidential Communication Orders. (g) In February so much traffic was being passed through Shaibah that it became necessary to provide some form of auxiliary station. A W/T lorry, which had been fitted out to deal with such eventualities, was accordingly sent to Shaibah. The lorry contained the following equipment:— One T .19B transmitter. One short wave type 'A' transmitter. One T.F. receiver, modified. One short wave receiver, type 'A.' One mains charging board. One Stewart Turner generating set, with switchboard, for use as prime mover in case of necessity. The H.T. supply was obtained from two S.E.M. motor generators connected in parallel. Orders were given that the auxiliary station was to be used wheu necessary to clear traffic to out stations on a frequency of 272-7. kilocycles (1,100 metres). (/t) On 2nd January orders were received to erect and open up the following W/T stations in the Western Desert:— Station. Period in Operation. By whom Operated. Karbala .. .. 2.1.29-26.2.29 .. R.A.F. operators. Nukhaib .. .. 2.1.29-28.4.29 .. 'Iraq Army operators. (i) These two stations worked direct with Baghdad on a frequency of 333 kilocycles (900 metres), as the 1,550 metre wave was already fully loaded. 2. Direction Finding. Provision was made for stranded aircraft sets to be supplied to Shaibah and to the permanent desert posts in the event of their being required to locate forced landed aircraft.18 I 3. Traffic. (a) The number of messages handled by the W/I station, Shaibah, for the period July, 1928 to June, 1929, was as follows :— Quarter ending September, 1928 .. .. .. 9,526 Quarter ending December, 1928 .. .. .. 12,844 Quarter ending March, 1929 .. .. .. ^ Quarter ending June, 1929 .. .. .. 9,733 (b) The 'Iraq Army VV/T stations handled a total of 12,740 messages during the period January to May, 1929, inclusive. 4. Equipment. (a) Aircraft. —(i) All W/T aircraft were fitted with type T.21 transmitter and type T.F. receiver, and all carried forced landed W/T equipment. (ii) Bentwood masts again gave a certain amount of trouble through sections becoming seized up owing to climatic conditions and the ingress of sand and dust. (iii) All aircraft of Nos. 70 and 84 (Bomber) Squadrons were fitted with generator. Reference 10A/3618, which has been found more reliable than the old generator. Reference 10A/1618. (b) Armoured Cars.— (i) In order to avoid the trouble mentioned in para. 4 (a) (ii) all sections of armoured cars were equipped with the ordinary 30-ft. light tvpe steel mast. While these masts give less trouble than the Bentwood telescopic mast, they cannot be considered as being entirely satisfactory for use by mobile W/T stations in this country. Mast sections are easily damaged, and the life of the rope guys is very short. (ii) Two Morris six-wheelers were fitted up as V\ /1 tenders in order to compare their performance with that of the Rolls Royce \\ /T tender. (iii) A cabin 2 ft. 8 in. wide was boarded off immediately behind the driver's seat, entrance to the cabin being formed by cutting a rectangular hole, approximately 2 ft. square, through the back of the driver's hood. (iv) The instruments were slung on ordinary suspension brackets which were fixed to a detachable panel on the side of the cabin. (v) From a wireless point of view the Morris W/T tender is decidedly superior to the Rolls Royce W/T tender owing to the greater space available for both the operator and apparatus, and the fact that whatever load is carried in the rear portion of the tender it does not in any way interfere with the operation of the W/T instruments. (c) Armoured Train. —(i) A complete T.21 transmitter and T.F. receiver station was held at Shaibah for fitting into the armoured train if necessary. This was not required. (ii) The telephone system in the armoured train was to have been installed by the 'Iraq Army if required. 5, 'Iraq Army W T Stations. (a) Procedure Used.—Permission for 'Iraqi operators to be taught and to employ certain portions of the R.A.F. procedure was not received till the end of March, so that the full benefit of this decision was not felt. From the short time it has been in use, however, it is obvious that a great saving in the times taken to pass signals between stations operated by British and 'Iraqi personnel will be effected. (b) Personnel. —As operators, where everything is going well, the 'Iraqis are very efficient, but they do not seem to have the ability quickly to trace and rectify any breakdowns which may occur.19 (c) Equipment. —(i) The same trouble was experienced at 'Iraq Army W IT stations with the light type steel mast as was experienced by armoured cars. See para. 4 (b) (i). (ii) Norman Lyon charging sets gave a certain amount of trouble at 'Iraq Army W/T stations, but this was due to a very large extent, if not entirely, to inexpert handling by 'Iraqi personnel. 0 APPENDIX IV. REPORT ON WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTHERN DESERT. June, 1928, to May, 1929. 1. The conditions are those of a sub-tropical area which lies at a distance from any ocean, and are, therefore, of a semi-arid type. 2. The period under review may be divided into four seasons :— (a) Summer—June, 1928, to October, 1928. (b) Autumn—November, 1928. (c) Winter—December, 1928, to February, 1929. (d) Spring—March, 1929, to May, 1929. 3. The figures and deductions in this report are taken from the Shaibah observations, this being the nearest meteorological station to the Southern Desert. (а) Summer —June, 1928, to October, 1928. —This period is considered as the hot weather, when, until October, the maximum shade temperature rarely falls below 100°. The highest recorded temperature was 119° on 30th July, but, no doubt, temperature rose higher than this in parts of the desert. Dust storms occurred on 43 occasions, these being associated with the south-westerly winds which blow continuously with varying force throughout the hot weather. Dust usually commenced rising from one to two hours after dawn, increasing as the temperature rose during the day, diminishing and clearing towards evening. These dust storms were generally foretold in the general inference broadcast to all stations on the previous evening. During October the strong north-westerly winds slackened owing to the breaking up of the large area of low pressure which had remained stationary over 'Iraq during the hot weather. As the barometric pressure rose the temperature fell, and the summer dust storms ceased. (б) Autumn—November, 1928. —During this period the weather became unsettled, thunder and lightning with rain occurring on the 3rd and 4th. Rain also fell on the 19th, 20th, 23rd and 24th. The temperature during this month dropped considerably, the highest recorded being 71 • 6° on the 1st, and lowest 38-6° on the 28th. (c) Winter—December, 1928, to February, 1929. —This period was noticeable for the lack of rain usually associated with it, and also the generally settled conditions which prevailed. The lowest temperature recorded was 27° on 7th January, and only on three other occasions was the temperature below freezing point. December settled conditions prevailed with bright cloudless days and cold nights. A dust storm occurred on only one occasion. January, conditions became less settled, rain occurring on seven occasions, and associated with this were ground mists in the early morning. February was generally settled, dust storms occurring on six occasions.20 The dust storms and rain associated with this period are caused by t^j influence of secondary depressions travelling across Southern 'Iraq in an easterly direction. Winds usually blew from a south-easterly direction, and, as the depression passed, swinging to the prevailing north-westerly direction. Id) Spring March to May, 1929—During the first half of March settled conditions prevailed, but towards the latter half of the month the weather deteriorated and became unsettled, dust storms occurring on five occasions and rain once. Rain occurred on the first day of April and dust storms on six occasions. During this month the temperature rose gradually, the barometric pressure dropped, and the large low pressure area, with which is associated the hot weather, commenced forming over the Southern Desert. May although included above in the spring period, is actually the com mencement of the hot weather. During this month the temperature rose considerably, and conditions were unsettled, dust storms occurring on twelve occasions. The conditions generally were very trying with high temperatures and constant dust storms. APPENDIX V. MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS-SOUTHERN DESERT, 1928 29. 1. During the period under review medical requirements for operations were small as compared with the previous year. 2. Prior to the commencement of any operations arrangements were made to have in readiness for immediate despatch medical stores and equipment in quantities based on the requirements of 1927-1928 operations for headquarters and columns respectively. 3. Provision was made for a senior medical officer and a junior medical officer, and medical airmen at the headquarters of the operations and for a nursing orderly and a sanitary assistant at each column. 4. At one period there seemed a probability that operations might be on a more extensive scale than was anticipated, and the necessary additions to the reserve stocks of medical stores and equipment were made m readiness. 5. In the latter part of 1928 all armoured car sections in the command were equipped with first aid boxes, and lectures on elementary first aid were given to personnel of armoured car units. 6. Medical arrangements for operations were first required in January, 1929, when a base was formed at Kerbala and an outpost at Nukhaib. A medical officer, one nursing orderly, and a sanitary assistant were sent to Kerbala, and a temporary camp opened in a compound adjacent to the railway, where the detachment was able to live under sanitary conditions which were satisfactory considering the short time available for preparations and the dilapidation of most of the buildings in the compound. Water was supplied from approved railway sources, and chlorination was unnecessary. A somewhat dilapidated building was found suitable as a small sick quarters, and could if necessary have accommodated several sick. The policy, however, as regards sick was that cases likely to be unfit for more than one day should be evacuated immediately by air or by rail.21 Kerbala was regarded medically and equipped as a modified head quarters, and served as such for the advanced column at Nukhaib, where a nursing orderly and a sanitary assistant were detailed for duty. The camp at Kerbala closed before the end of January, and further medical arrangements were not found necessary except at Nukhaib and at detached flights at Sulman and Busaiyah. 7. At each of these outposts, detachments of 'Iraq Army were stationed, and, as the 'Iraqi standards of hygiene are very much lower than Royal Air Force standards, the sanitation of these camps was at first very unsatisfactory, and it was decided that when Royal Air Force personnel were in occupation a sanitary assistant and two sanitary coolies should be provided. A medical officer was detailed once a week to inspect the posts, and a marked improvement in sanitation was soon apparent. Fly-proof box latrines were introduced, and excreta disposed of by incineration. The water supplies were effectively treated by hyper chlorination, and removal of excess chlorine with thiosulphate. 8. Owing to the short duration of Kerbala as a headquarters, separate medical statistics were not kept for the operations of 1928-1929, casualties being shown in the usual way by parent units. One fatal casualty occurred when a wireless operator in a machine of No. 84 (B) Squadron, Shaibah, was shot by rifle fire during a reconnaissance on 3rd March, 1929. A case of contusion, left ankle, was evacuated by air from Sulman on 16th April, 1929. The only other casualty requiring immediate evacuation was a case of pneumonia evacuated by rail from Kerbala. APPENDIX VI. MEMORANDUM OF ARMAMENT DURING OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN DESERT. Jane, 1928 May, 1929. GUNNERY. 1. Vickers Gun. No trouble has been experienced of a mechanical nature, but the maintenance of the gun during periods of dust has been extremely difficult. 2. Lewis Gun. No trouble has been experienced. 3. Sights. It has been found that front gun shooting is not of a very high standard when using the standard ring and bead sight, and the general opinion is that a long sight base with a smaller bead is highly desirable. While this modification is merely one that can be earned out in the field, it is con sidered that research should be required to carry out experiments towards obtaining a more suitable sight for the attack of ground targets. 4. Ammunition. A total of 2,120 rounds were fired.22 BOMBING. 5. Bombs and Bomb Sight. Bombs were dropped on two separate occasions, the total for the period being forty 20 lb. H.E.R.L. • j' -j i n. i Both these occasions were in the nature of surprise individual attacks bv the aircraft concerned, and resulted in the use of the course settmg bomb sight being abandoned, and the method of diving attack bemg employed. The general opinion requires the supply of some simple sight on the ring and bead principle, by means of which bombs may be released during a front gun attack. It must be realised that the raiders scatter on the approach of aircraft, and do not offer a suitable target for attack by ordinary methods. It is possible that the negative lens type of sight would be more suitable than the complicated course setting sights now issued for operations of this nature. 6. Bomb Carriers. No trouble was experienced. APPENDIX VII. SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT SERVICES. Period June, 1928-May, 1929. 1. Supply columns were formed in January, 1929, as follows (a) Kerbala—Nukhaib. (b) Samawah-Sulman. (V) Ur-Busaiyah. These columns were run by the R.A.F. Civil Transport Contractor at exceeding low rates, and worked efficiently. Commissariat representatives were placed at Kerbala, Samawah, and Ur. These columns made two journeys each week, thus enabling fresh rations to be supplied twice weekly. 2. Emergency Reserve Rations. As the strength at desert posts was liable to alteration at short notice, a reserve of 150 composite rations for emergency purposes only was provided at each post. Six cases contained 25 rations, made up as under . Itin biscuits. 12 tins preserved meat. 12 tins M. and V. 2 tins jam. 1 lb. tea. 4 lbs. sugar. J lb. salt, i oz, pepper. This arrangement proved of advantage on several occasions, and provided a better variety of food than an ordinary iron ration. 3. Supplies—General. During the cold weather rum was issued under the authority of the Principal Medical Officer as in former operations. The issues of tea and sugar for personnel with the columns were increased by aO per cent, on account of the quality of the water available in the desert.23 Water. Towards the end of the operations water became a difficulty, the supply of the wells gradually diminishing and becoming unfit for drinking purposes. An adequate supply of drinking water was accordingly sent out twice weekly by columns, 5-gallon benzol drums proving satisfactory and easily handled containers for this purpose. APPENDIX VIII. STORES ORGANISATION AND ACCOUNTING. Period June. 1928 May, 1929. 1. The following instructions were issued on 8th January, 1929 :— 2. General. All stores issued for use on operations will be accounted for by Station Accounts, Hinaidi, under instructions to be issued separately to them. 3. Flight Inventories. 'A' and ' B ' class stores taken bv flights and sections of armoured cars, on leaving their permanent stations, will be struck off flight and section inventories and 'Articles in Use ' ledger charge by Forms 21 (conversion voucher), which will be forwarded to Station Accounts for action. Forms 601C and 464 (Deviations from Standard Equipment) will not be taken in the field. 4. Demands. Demands for stores required by units and detachments in the field will be made by signal on the appropriate supply base. The base will con solidate all items from units and detachments in the field and demand on aircraft depot by signal repeated 'Aviation.' Demands must quote Section No. and Reference No. 5. Issues. Issues of all classes of stores will be made to the Supply Bases, and vouchered on Forms 600 under the normal accounting procedure to the appropriate force, and the vouchers will be forwarded direct to Station Accounts for action. 6. Bases. Lists of stores for columns will be compiled by the Supply Bases each day showing the quantities of items and weights.' Stores will be checked by the officer in charge, aircraft, at the time of loading (if packed in cases the number of cases only will be checked), and loading lists will be initialied as concurring in the amounts shown. On off loading at the columns the pilot will again sign the lists certifying that the stores were handed over. 1 he lists will be returned by the Bases. Each Base will maintain a stores inwards book, and all stores received will be entered therein in detail. 7. Returns. All unserviceable 'A' and repairable ' B ' stores will be returned to Aircraft Depot by the bases as opportunity offers, and brought on charge by C.R.V., which will be forwarded to Station Accounts for action.24 8. Closing. ~ \11 items of 'A,' ' B ' and ' C ' class stores not required for retention in units at close of operations to be returned to Depot and brought on charge by C.R.V., which are to be forwarded to Station Accounts for 30 Items of 'A' and ' B ' equipment required by flights and sections at close of operations are to be returned to the parent unit and transferred by conversion voucher (Fonn 21) to unit's 'Articles in Use Jedger and flight and section inventory charge, such conversion vouchers to be foiwarded to Station Accounts for striking off. 9 Ledgers. Stores for Ur will be accounted for in Sowforce ledger. Stores for Kerbala will be accounted for in Norforce ledger. 10. General Remarks. No difficulty was experienced in following the above procedure. A specia ledger was opened, and stores were issued to either the Norforce B^e or the Sowforce Base. When this ledger was closed it was found that the to ensure .ha. Voe,b.Uar y Rof. Nos were quoted in all signals received from detachments, thus removing uncertainty as to what was actually required. The necessity for this had been shown clearly by past experience, and great importance is attached to observance in future. , r c+^nc Steps have to be taken to ensure an adequate supply of Stores Vocabularies. APPENDIX IX. MAINTENANCE OF AIRCRAFT AND ENGINES OF DETACHMENTS ENGAGED. Period June, 1928-May, 1929. 1. Advantage was taken of the experience gained during the Akforce operations of 1928 to reorganise the maintenance of aircraft and engines within the limiting conditions of Desert Posts. I hough the pn'sen onorations lanuary-May, 1929, were not so intensive as those of Akforce, 1928 it is thought that the improvement realised in the case under review would have been maintained under more trying conditions. 2 In regard to No. 70 (B) Squadron, the position was eased by the provisioning of Desert Posts by convoys, Victorias not being used for this purpose in 1929 to the same extent as in 1928. It must, however, remembered that the Posts at Sulman and Busaiyah were closed down during the third week in April, 1929, and Nukhaib in the third week in May, 1929, whereas in 1928 the Posts were not closed down till the first week in June ; moreover, the weather in 1929 remained relatively cool during the operations, whereas in the previous year the hot weather arrived abnormally early. Had the conditions in 1929 been the same as in 1928 Victorias would probably have had to be used for the conveyance of fresh rations and ice, and it would be unsafe to assume that the 1929 organisation would apply to any given year in future. Moreover, the relatively cool weather in 1929 was a factor in more successful maintenance by avoiding undue fatigue of personnel.25 3. The attached copy of the maintenance card for a Liberty engine, which was evolved as a result of the experience gained during Akforce operations, was fixed to the bulkhead of the D.H.9As. in such a position that it could be read by the fitter while working on the engine. These cards were in position on D.H.9As. for some months before operations started, and personnel had become thoroughly conversant with the procedure laid down. 4. The following is a summary of the maintenance organisation :— (a) Normal inspections were carried out at Desert Posts. (b) Sufficient spares to effect all minor repairs were available at Desert Posts. (c) Aircraft requiring major replacements were flown when possible to Hinaidi, the period of unserviceability thus being reduced to a minimum. (d) Engines and spares required for forced landed aircraft were flown out by No. 70 (B) Squadron either from Hinaidi or Shaibah. The following details show the speed and ease with which this can be accomplished:— An engine was required for a forced landed aircraft of No. 55 (B) Squadron operating from Sulman. On receipt of the signal at Hinaidi, a liberty engine was obtained by No. 70 (B) Squadron from the Aircraft Depot, the engine carrier gear was fitted to the Victoria, and the engine was fitted in the carrier in a total overall time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. When the Victoria landed alongside the forced landed D.H.9A the old engine was removed from the latter, fitted to the Victoria, and the new engine was installed. The time from landing alongside the D.H.9A to the moment when both aircraft took off again was 5 hours and 30 minutes. In other words, this operation can be carried out in approximately 7 hours from the receipt of orders at No. 70 (B) Squadron, exclusive of the time taken in flying from Hinaidi to the forced landing and locating same.BASRA AND HAIL</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000177_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/63</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000177</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/63</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Report on the operations carried out in the southern desert in connection with the Iraq-Najd borders, June 1928-May 1929.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1930/1930</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-31T00:55:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (15 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio (except for the back cover, where the folio number is on the verso).Pagination: The volume also contains an original printed pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>A printed report on air and motorcar operations carried out along the Iraq-Najd border following several cross-border raids.
