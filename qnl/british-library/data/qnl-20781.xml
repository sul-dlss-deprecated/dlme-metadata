Just as I informed your honour in my letter, dated the 17th Jamadi-us- sani 1332, that when time comes for obtaining that I will certainly consult the Political Agency, I do hereby repeat to you that if there is any prospect of obtain ing kerosene oil in my territory of Bahrein, I will not embark on the exploitation of that myself and will not entertain overtures from any quarter, regarding that without consulting the Political Agent in Bahrain and without the appoval of the High Government.

In the spring of this year, in deference to a request received from Your Excellency, approval was given to the increase, as a temporary measure, of the duties in question to 7-|% on luxury articles. Despite this relaxation, the financial and economic situation of the Islands remains acute, and I am accordingly now authorised to inform Your Excellency that consequent on further consideration of the position, approval is given, as a temporary measure, to the withdrawal of the limitation imposed by Article 4 of the Friendly Convention of 1861 quoted above on Your Excellency's freedom to modify the rates of duty which may be imposed on the goods of British subjects, subject to the condition that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed on any other goods of the same kind. I am, however, to say that it is desired that Your Excellency should inform the Political Resident and give him an opportunity of making any observations which he may consider desirable, before in fact making any change in tariffs, and that concurrence in the temporary modification of the limitation imposed by Article iv of the Convention of 1861 is given on the understanding that notice of four months shall be given to the Resident of any changes of the nature in question.

Should economic conditions at any time render it necessary, in the opinion of the Government of Saudi Arabia or the Government of Bahrein, to reconsider the arrangements set forth in the foregoing paragraphs, the Government desiring to modify them shall inform the other Government through the diplomatic channel. Should the two Governments be unable to reach agreement in regard to such amendment, it shall be open to either Government to terminate the present agreement on giving six months' notice of their intention to do so.

In continuation of previous letter intimating the out-break of war between the British Government and Turkey, I am ordered by the British Government to convey to Your Excellency gratitude for your loyalty and your offer of assistance, and to request you to attack Umm Qasr, Safwan and Bubiyan and to occupy them. You should endeavour, afterwards, in co-operation with Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Amir Abdul Aziz bin Saud and other reliable Shaikhs to liberate Basrah from Turkish possession.

I also hope that two of our men-of-war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troops there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request that you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British merchants in Basrah and its dependencies, to protect the European residents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, I am ordered by the British Government to promise to Your Excellency that if we succeed thereinâ€”and we shall succeed therein, please God,â€”we will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government and we will not surrender it back to them at all.

Persons guilty of premeditated acts of aggression, such as raiding or robbery, shall be obliged to make good all losses suffered by the victims as a result of the aggression and shall pay the value of animals which have been killed in the fighting, or which have been looted and have died or been lost while in their possession. The frontier officer appointed in accordance with Article 3 of the Agreement for Friendship and Neighbourly Relations who is responsible for the collection and return of loot, shall likewise collect from the aggressors out of their property objects equivalent in value to those losses, and shall deliver them together with the loot as required by Section 1 of this Schedule. The frontier officer of the Govern ment whose nationals were the victims may collect any evidence which he considers appropriate regarding the losses and forward it to the frontier officer of the other Government engaged in collecting the loot. 6. Khidma. On the return of the looted property or animals nothing shall be deducted therefrom by the way of Khidma, recompense, wages of herdsmen, or expenses. If the Government collecting the loot has incurred such expenditure, it is free to recover it out of the property of the offenders. The recompense, however, of a person who has found stray camels and taken charge of them until application is made by their owner shall be calculated at the rate of one gold pound for every five camels, provided that the finder has given notice of his having found them at the time of its occurrence and has not attempted to conceal it. The frontier officer to whom notice is given shall give notice of the fact to the frontier officer of the other Government. 7. Losses. The nationals of either country may enter the other country to search for any of their property which may have been lost or stolen. If the searcher finds anywhere what he lost or what was stolen from him he shall demand his losses from the person in whose possession they are. If the latter surrenders them, well and good; but if not, the searcher shall not have the right to recover them by force, but shall apply to the nearest Government centre in order to inform those concerned of the result of his enquiries about his losses or what was stolen from him. The authority to whom this information is given shall take the necessary measures to give what is due to the rightful person and to punish the offenders.

Some years have passed since then. The Great Government think it is oppor tune for me to remind you again that it would be altogether disadvantageous to the interests of all you Chiefs of Oman if any one of you were to grant concessions to foreigners in connection with the fishing for pearls or sponges. I am therefore to warn you that you should on no account respond to over tures from any quarter for concessions for fishing on pearl banks over which you possess rights without first consulting the Residency through the Residency Agent. Kindly let me know through the Residency that you have received and under stood this letter. 46133 G42 ib) Translation of a Letter from Shaikh Tahnun-bin-Zaid, Chief of Abu Dhabi, to Colonel P. Z.

It is obvious and certain that we have no object in matters which have not been regulated by custom from the first and which have not been habitual to those who were before us. As you know, the soul will not tolerate such (a matter) and you should have no doubt (about this).

No. 2 Letter from the Viceroy of India to Saiyid Thuwaini of Muscat containing His Arbitration Award in the Dispute over Zanzibar, dated April 2 1861, and Saiyid Thuwaini's Reply Accepting the Award, dated May 15, 1861â€” Beloved and esteemed Friend! I address Your Highness on the subject of the unhappy differences which have arisen between yourself and Your Highness's brother, the ruler of Zanzibar, and for the settlement of which Your Highness has engaged to accept the arbitration of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Having regard to the friendly relations which have always existed between the Government of Her Majesty the Queen and the Government of Oman and Zanzibar, and desiring to prevent war between kinsmen, I accepted the charge of arbitration between you, and in order to obtain the fullest knowledge of all the points in dispute, I directed the Government of Bombay to send an Officer to Muscat and Zanzibar to make the necessary enquiries. Brigadier Coghlan was selected for this purpose, an officer in whose judgment, intelligence, and impartiality the Government of India reposes the utmost confidence. Brigadier Coghlan has submitted a full and clear report of all the questions at issue between Your Highness and your brother. I have given my most careful attention to each of these questions. The terms of my decision are as follows: â€” 75/.â€”That His Highness Syud Majid be declared ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of His late Highness Syud Saeed. 2nd. â€”That the ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 crowns. 3rd. â€”That His Highness Syud Majid pay to His Highness Syud Thowaynee the arrears of subsidy for two years, or 80,000 crowns.f*l) 51 I am satisfied that these terms are just and honourable to both of you; and as you have deliberately and solemnly accepted my arbitration, 1 shall expect that you will cheerfully and faithfully abide by them, and that they will be carried out without unnecessary delay. The annual payment of 40,000 crowns is not to be understood as a recognition of the dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, neither it is to be considered as merely personal between Your Highness and your brother Syud Majid. It is to extend to your respective successors, and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement, compensating the ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequality between the two inheritances derived from your father. His late Highness Syud Saeed, the venerated friend of the British Government, which two inheritances are to be henceforward distinct and separate. I am. Your Highness's Fort William ; Sincere friend and well-wisher. The 2nd April 1861. Canning. To His Exalted Excellency Lord Canning, Governor-General of India, etc., etc., etc. In the name of the great God! After Compliments. â€”At a most propitious and favourable time we were honoured with the receipt of your esteemed letter and were highly gratified with its contents. What Your Excellency has stated is most satisfactory to us, more especially as regards your award betwixt us and our brother Majid. We heartily accept the same and are at a loss how to express our regret for having occasioned you so much trouble, and our appreciation of the kindness which has been manifested towards us in this matter. We thank God for your efforts on our behalf, praying also that your good will may be rewarded and that you may never cease to be our support. We further pray that our sincere affection may always be towards the Great (British) Government, and that it may increase continually: moreover, that your exalted affection and noble solicitude may always be exercised towards us, and that we may never be deprived thereof. As regards our brother Majid, we pray God during our life-time he may never experi ence anything from us but kindness and hearty good will. Furthermore, we rely implicitly on your arbitration between us (being carried out). What your exalted Excellency may require in any way from your attached friend, a hint alone will suffice for its accomplishment, and we shall feel honoured in executing it. , , . , i , . ^ We pray finally that you may be preserved to the highest honours and m the most perfect health. We send you the salutation of peace as the best conclusion. From your truly sincere friend, the servant of God, who confides in him as the Giver of all good. Thowaynee bin Saeed bin Sultan.
