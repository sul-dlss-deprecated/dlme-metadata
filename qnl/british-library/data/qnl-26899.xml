Road-making in Oman. I have the honour to forward herewith a report Ho.K/102 dated the 11th Auguet 1932, from the Political Agent, Muscat, on the above subject. 2. Captain Walker, Captain Alban 4 e predecessor as Ccmmandant of the Muscat Infantry, started road-making in Oman by the construction of the difficult section from Muscat to Matrah, and some miles beyond, (vide Bus hire letter Ho.85-T of 27th November 193®), and the Infantry have now under Capt. Alban extended the work. Much of this was undertaken during the hot weother under adverse conditions and reflects great credit on Captain Alban, his Indian Officers and on the Infantry in general. 3. The effect that road-making has on tribal territory is a truism on which I need not dilate, and Captain Alban has indicated the advantages which will accrue from the extensions which have been made. One of the difficulties which the Muscat Government has to contend against in the general administration of the State is its size, the coastal line is many hundred miles long,'and anything such as roads, especially roads through important and fertile tracts like the Bat inch area, which quickens up communication between Muscat and the rest of the country, is an obvious benefit.

To The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushir e ROADS IB MUSCAT STAm Memorandum. HI—iW In continuation of previous correspondence on the above subject I have much pleasure in announcing the comple tion of the projected new motor road from Boshar along the Batineh coast to Sohar and thence to the Sham&amp;liyeh district up to the nortnern boundary of Muscat State at Marair. 2. The total length of this road is approximately 200 miles and for the whole of its distance it runs through the date gardens of tue Batineh and Shaaaliyeh coast. Between Sohar and Muscat a great deal of trouble was experienced on account of numbers of Yfadis which emerge from the high ranges of the interior and find their way to die sea across the Batineh plain^. Most of these ^adis axe dry and sandy with precipitous banks in sane cases as much as 20 feet in height. These banks had to be cut through to enable motor traffic to pass and the sand in the Wadis them selves was bridged by means of causeways constructed of cut x bushes, palm fronds and gravel collected in the vicinity; no stones c£ sny sort were available for this purpose. 3. As the result of these improved communications it is now possible to motor from Muscat to bohar or the bhamaliyeh in reasonable comfort in the space of oi nd it is noticed that as a result motor traffic has already increased. Last year and at the beginning of this year, before the completion of the road, I had occasion to perform this journey and can vouch for the fact that the roughness and discomfort of this journey could not have been exceeded even on the worst tracks•&gt; 9. racks in Persia* 4. Between bohar and Khaboorah a distance of nearly 100 miles and the most difficult portion of the road, the work was entirely carried out by the Muscat Infantry. About 20 large Wadis had to be crossed and for many miles sand had to be cleared away t o e nable the road to pass. 5. Prom Khaboorah onwards to Marair, a distance of about 100 miles the road was cleared by the local inhabitants, the Sheikh of each Tillage being made responsible for the good order of the road between his village boundries. The whole work was completed in a space of roughly one month and it is almost solely due to this improved communication with the chief revenue bearing districts of Muscat State that it has been -possible this year to effect such ^marked improvements in £akat collections. 6. The aim of the taxpayer here, as elsewhere, is to evade as much as possible, the payment of Customs and other taxes and it nas already been found that the more frequent inspec tions of Customs and Revenue establishments made possible by the new road, has considerably decreased the amount of revenue lost by peculation i on the part of the subordinate officials. 7. The system of ccmmunications in Muscat State now comprises the following roads;- 1. Muscat to Matrah approximate distance 3 miles 2. Mat rah to Bos ha r * M 20 * 3. ' ' £.uqa(lim H ”47 ^ 4. Boshar * Sohar ' H 140 * 5.S.ohar n Marair M M 60 ** Total 270 « 8. In addition to these, it is hoped during the coming season to be able to commence work on the road to Sur. This of course will be a much more difficult project than the Batineh road just completed as the whole area to be traversed consists of amass of hig h mountains and ravines. The route is at present being surveyed in detail and it is not anticipated that any insuperable difficulties will be met with.9. In conclusion it may be remarked that the Muscat Infantry have had to work very halid to get this road completed, on one occasion at least kxjh owing to a heavy downfall in the hills part of their work was washed away and had to be built up a second time. I am glad to be able to say that all ranks displayed the greatest enthusiasm in their work.

I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Muscat, lorwarding a report on the Muscat - Muttrah road by Captain Walker, the Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps. 2. Having regard to the extremely dilficult terrain through which this road had to be constructed, I entirely endorse the views expressed in Major Fowle’s letter and consider it an astonishing piece of work for an untrained local Levy Corps under the guidance of one British Oificer. Its construction reflects the greatest credit on Captain Walker and the force under his command.

From Major T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Agent and H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat. To The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. The Muscat-Matrah Road . I have the honour to attach, herewith, a report on the Muscat-Matrah raod by Captain Walker- Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps. 2. Through the original idea of the road came from my predecessor, Major Murphy, and though Mis interest in the work was of material value to the project. I cannot - beyond a few references here and there in the Muscat Diary and so forth - find in the Agency files any connected account of the making of the road. I therefore suggested to Captain talker that he should compile a narrative of the work, which he has done. 3. I think I can let Captain Walker’s report and the road, which of course you have seen, speak for themselves. Without exaggeration the making of the road, consiaering the conditions under which it was constructed, seems to me little sort of amazing, a sentiment which is shared by all visitors to Muscat, the latest being the Commander-in-Chief East Indies and his staff. Such a road in the North West frontier or in Baluchistan, to some roads in which areas it can fairly be compared, would have been carried out underthe superintendence of a highly qualified engineer, assisted by a technical staff, trained supervisors and skilled workmen, backed by large resources in impliments, machinery and money. I need not labour the point, which is obvious, that the kuscat-Matrah road was made without a single one of these advantages. The work too was often performed under conditions most trying climatically» and sometimes dangerous to life and limb; 2 men were actually killed, and others had narrow escapes. That in spite of difficulties, discouragements and discomforts the Levies carried on cheerfully and keenly, actually working overtime voluntarily, shows '|iat an excellent spirit exists in them. 4. As I have stated in a separate despatch the road is ol considerable military importance in enabling the Levy to carry out its main object; the defence of Muscat and Matrah from attack. It has also had an excellent political and general effect in opening up the Batinah coast to motor transport. The road indeed is a work of which the Levy as a whole, and specially Captain Walker and his officers, may well be proud. I have, etc., Sd. T.C.Fowle Major, Political Agent and H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat•A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MUSCAT - MATTRAH ROAD. Previously to the making &lt;3&gt;f this road the only communication between Muscat and Mattrah was by sea. There was also a road of sorts built by the Portuguese* but it consisted of a narrow track, in many places so steep that it was cut in steps and was incapable of taking a laden donkey. All loads must have been carried by human porterage and one can imagine the labours of unfortunate slaves toiling over this road under the grilling sun, the heat reflected to greater intensity by the rocky hills. This road is still in some places intact, its steps worn and polished by bare feet to the semblance of black marble which invites the unwary traveller to an unexpected seat when going downhill. Its use was mainly tactical, to enable supplies to be brought from the town to the outlying watchtowers which were built with great skill to overlook every possible approach through the rough and hilly country lying to the southwest of the town. The ruins of these permanent piquets still remain, many of them in good condition. Soon after taking over command of H.H. The Sultan of Muscat’s Levy, I *as asked by Major Murphy The Political Agent in Muscat if I considered it in the power of the Levy to construct a road between Muscat and Mattrah. It was pointed out that it was a long felt want and that the Levy would be very usefully employed. The distance was only about Three and a half miles, but, owing to the nature of the country it was a somewhat hopeless looking task. Steep, rocky hills of the knife edged variety and very numerous ran transversely to the line the road must take and, to make matters worse, ended in steep cliffs running sheer into the sea. Only at low tide could one find a way round thesethese cliffs and then only at the cost of getting thoroughly wet in the innumerable stretches which were always A year previously the Levy had actually made a rough track, fit to take a loaded camel. For half the distance this ran under the cliffs and was only about thfcee feet above sea level then climbed over a hill into I&amp;iscat. Here the to crown all, the whole of the seaside part was completely washed away the very day after the road had been opened in state i Not a vestige of it remained after the Shimal had done its work. Though ail this was disheartening it did show that it might be possible to construct a more robust road. After much reconnaissance it was decided that the western part of the road must follow the sea shore and, to have any chance of withstanding the onslaughts of the Shimal would have to be cut out of the rock and be sufficiently high to prevent the full force of the sea breaking over it. The prospect was not a pleasing one. The Levy had no rockcutting tools of any description except a few picks (which were soon found useless) and some crowbars. In addition anj* abundant Merani) rumoured to be Portuguese in origin. Work commenced on the Muttrah end of the road.. At first the troops looked upon the enterprise as a mild, or perhaps acute form of lunacy. After three weeks work there was no change in their opinion as the total result so far resembled nothing so much as a hens scratching in seaich of a meal. It was decided to carry on for a further ten days and immersed. gradient was so steep that it tried the strongest camel, and, supply of black coarse gunpowder was available(in Fort thisthis was justified, as, when once a start was well made and a fairly big hole in the rock had been cut out, blasting began to have more effect. The initial piece of work consisted of the cutting out of the road from a solid piece of serpentine rock. This was about forty feet high, extending back into the hill and constituted a solid barrier for about seventy five jcatxxxx yards. It was found that a blast hole took from three to four hours to make. They were all drilled by hand two men wielding a crowbar becween them as a drill, most monotonous and tiring work. All through the cool weather the work went on. At the end of it a rough road had been made along the cliff side between eighteen to twenty three feet above sea level and about eighteen feet wide reaching to the village of Riyam situated in a sandy cove about half way to iluscat. The work had gone on much faster than had been anticipated owing to the fact that the rock had been found to be softer in some places than in others and the strata sloped down towards the sea in slabs about six feet wide. Vhen the bottom of each slab had been cut out, it was possible to dislodge large pieces of rock from above by skilful mining. These pieces were sometimes so large that sixty to seventy men on the end of a wire rope could not move them and they had again to be blasted in two or three pieces. The stone thus displaced was used for making a strong sea wail. When batteries of mines were blown at the same time, fragments of rock, some of them of considerable size were hurled far out to sea. Fisherman in their small canoes would not be persuaded of the danger and stubbornly stayed in the danger zone. Oneday, however, a very large rock was hurled several hundred Its progress was followed by all the troops, its ascent and fall accompanied by their curious It fell with a terrific splash about a yard from the canoe and swamped it, much to the troops’ delight. Henceforth these canoes kept at a very respectful distance. At one part of this first reach no work could be done at the base of the cliff owing to the dangerous nature of its overhang. All the work had to be done from the torp to take this bit away. The men were roped together by sections and became in a short time, most skilful and daring steeplejacks working about a hundred feet sheer above the sea and rocks below. Here another exciting inciaent occurred, A party of men were working unroped on a steep slope, when a small landslide took place and seated on a large boulaer in the midst of it was a solitary sepoy. He and his mount crashed down some fifty feet. Except for a severe shaking he was unhur/t. Two years previously this same man had been shortening sail on the yard of a dhow during a storm at night and was blown overboard. He was picked up two days later by another dhow. He evidently has his own little cherub. This point was to claim two victims, however. After the t©p had been cleared away work was begun below. At one place a large piece of rock appeared to hand out a little from the cliff face. Efforts IxxhaHgxaixkxjpcixJkkk^lxjUDclliK were made to displace it but it would not move and appeared to be firmly held. It was decided to sink a row of mines beneath it and bring it down with some more of the cliff face. Two men were detailed to a mine immediately below it. They had scarcely been working five minutes, when the rock, which had resistea all efforts to move it, fell. The feet into towards a small canoetwo poor lads below were squarely caught and were killed, one instc^aneously and the other died in half an hour just after he had reached hospital. fortunately these two men were practically the only ones in the Levy with neither relatives or dependants. Three storms visited Muscat in the cool weather of 1928-29. A keen interest was taken by all and sundry as to whether the road would disappear or not. Knots of anxious sepoys were to be seen dashing off to the scene of their labours to watch the effect of the sea. Parts of the road were breached, to the joy of the platoons whose areas stood up to it and some very h^|ted ^ackchat* took place. Extra work put into these weak places greatly strenghtened them, but the small amout of damage done increased the already high moral of the troops. The energy put into the work by the men was an object lesson. Seven hours a day was the ration of work, a severe one, as the temperature after 9 a.m. was seldom less than 80 degrees in the shade, while the greater part of the work was done in the blazing sunshine. Yet, in the evenings one would often come upon a section working at some particularly stubborn part in its free hours. When Riyam was reached work was stopped for’the year. Near here one stretch of some two hundred and twenty yards required the blowing of no less than three thousand mines, ail hand made. Riyam to Muscat. The following cool weather the work was easier. The men were by now all skilled and knew to a nicety how to get the greatest effect from crowbar ancjmine. The road now left the sea and crossed a final range of steep hills before descending into Muscat. GreatGreat difficulty had been j^ound in obtaining a reasonable grade but after days of diligent search and calculation and scrambling over rocky hills, a grade «tf an average of six degrees was found. Several places required much blasting and for some two hundred and fifty yards the road had to be constructed on the face of a seventy degree slope. Several culverts had also to be constructed to allow rainwater from the hilltops a clear passage. The greater part of the hillside here yielded to the pick. On the 12th Dec.1929 the road was so far advanced that it was possible to take a car right into Muscat. The Levies Morris Commercial lorry had the distinction of being the first motor car to enter Muscat. The opening of the road was to have taken place on the eighteenth December but on the seventeenth a violent Shimal blew up. Would the road stand up? Fortunately it did, despite a severe hammering. At the same time the opening was postponed fcntill Boxing day as H.H. the Sultan was to come by sea to Mattrah, drive over the road in his car, address the troops formed up on both sides of the road on top of the Muscat hill and open the road formally. The storm made the sea journey impossible. This ceremony duly took place. A procession of the four cars in the country passed without mishap which nearly occurred when a Ford car with many of the j^uscat notables \and city fathers, so to speak, in charge of a not very sober river, missed going over a twenty foot wall. In tnis car re five people in the front seat, one on the drivers knee ani the driver all but failed to take’ a hairpin bend on the descent to Muscat. Thef.
