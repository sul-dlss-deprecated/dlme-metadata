The object of the War Injuries (Compensation Insurance) Act is to impose on the employers concerned an obligation to pay compensation in respect of war injuries to the following classes of workmen, calculated to amount approximately to the difference between the amount paid by the Government under the War Injuries Scheme and the amount which would have been payable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, if the war injury had given a right to tom- pensation thereunder. (a) Workmen employed in any employment or class of employment to which the Essential Services (Maintenance) Ordinance, 1941 (XI of 1941), has been declared under section 3 of that Ordnance to apply whether such declaration is or is not subsequently revoked. (b) Workmen employed in any factory as defined in clause (j) of section 2 t of the Factories Act, 1934 (XXV of 1934). (c) Workmen employed in any mine within the meaning of the Indian Mines Act, 1923 (IV of 1923). „ (d) Workmen employed in any major port. (e) Workmen, employed on any estate which is maintained for the purposes of growing cinchona, coffee, rubber or tea, and on which on any one day in the preceding twelve months twenty-five or more persons have been employed as workmen. (f) W T orkmen employed in any employment specified in this behalf by the Central Government by notification in the official Gazette. . Under Section 4 of the War Injuries Ordinance, 1941, whatever liability an employer may have had under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, in respect of war injuries or war service injuries, was removed. The present Act now imposes on employers of workmen mentioned above a special liability to pay compensation in respect of war injuries. The amount of compensation provided for in the Act is roughly such as would bring up the relief paid by Government under the War Injuries Scheme, to the appropriate level of com pensation which would be payable if the provisions of the Workmen’s Com pensation Act had applied. Where the monthly wages of a workman are more than Es. 300 the compensation payable under the Act is the amount payable in the case of a workman whose monthly wages are more than Rs. 200. It is possible that some employers may have voluntarily undertaken to pay compensation in respect of some of their employees on a scale even higher than what is provided^ for in the Act. A provision has, therefore, been made in section 4 of-the Act limiting the right of workmen to receive compensation otherwise than under the Act and under the War Injuries Scheme, to so much only of compensation as exceeds the amount of compensation payable under the Act. Insurance of Liability. Every employer other than a contractor whose contract is of less than one month in duration, to whom the Act applies is required to take out a policy of insurance from the Central Government and this policy will insure him until the termination of the present hostilities or until the date he ceases to be an employer, if such date is earlier. The provisions for compulsory insurance are naturally not made binding on the Crown; nor will they bind any Federal Railway unless the Central Govern ment orders otherwise by notification in the official Gazette.2 Insurance business in respect of liabilities for insurance under the Act is prohibited otherwise than by agents authorised by the Central Government. These Agents will collect on behalf of the Central Government the premiums from employers. A list of Agents will be found at pages 28-30 of this book. Amount of Premiums. The scheme of the Act is that the total amount of premium will be fixed finally after the termination of the hostilities. The total premium will be assessed as a percentage on the total wage bill of an employer for four com plete ‘quarters’ immediately preceding the termination of hostilities. Advance payment against this final total premium will, however, be recover ed from employers. Such periodic payments shall not be more frequentJdW once in each quarter of a year. Under the Act the first of such payments shall not exceed 4 annas per Rs. 100 of the wage bill for the period by reference to which the amount of the payments is fixed. Clause 8 of the Scheme fixes the amount of the first premium at 4 annas per Rs. 100 of the wage bill. As regards subsequent periodic payments, there is an important limitation on their rate: “The rate of any periodic payment after the first shall not be higher than the rate estimated to raise the amount in the Fund after repay ment of the advances, if any, paid into the Fund by the Central Government under sub-section (2) of section 11, to a sum of Rs. 15 lakhs”. In order not to prejudice the payment of claims, if the amount in the insurance fund is not sufficient at any time, the Central Government is required to pay into the Fund as an advance out of general revenues, such amount as the Central Government considers necessary. How to Insure. Every employer required to take out a policy of insurance must apply for insurance to a Government Agent or to such Officer as may be authorised by a Government Agent in this behalf. Such application shall be made— (a) if the employer had been an employer for one complete quarter before the 1st January 1944, then on or after 10th January 1944 and not later than 9th February 1944; (b) in all other cases, within one month of the employer s having been an employer for one quarter. Wage Bill. Wages are defined in the Act to have the same meaning as in the Workmen’s Compensation Act and this definition will govern the amount of compensation which would be payable in any individual case. The.Act, however, gives the Central Government power to prescribe by rules the principles to be followed m ascertaining the total wages bill of employers “including provisions for the exc usion therefrom of certain elements” included in the definition of wages. Rule 3 of the rules made under the Act provides that the wage bill for the purposes of calculating premiums shall include all cash w r ages excluding allow ances, if any given on account of increased cost of living. The amount of premium will be calculated with reference to this wage bill. * una contractors. The Act provides that the liabilities of a contractor whether he lends or lets. cli'al/n 6 f v? servic ® s °f workmen or executes any work for a principal employer onlv hp°r e . ra S 1 ^ erre to the principal employer. The principal emplover will arrJntrempnf ire r d t0 ^ ” eoe8sar y information regarding the terms of his a denarture fmm C fg n ^ ^ the, contractor. In this respect, the Act makes Act im^s T ft' Pr ° V,810n , 8 ° f th t e Workmen ’ 8 Compensation Act. The latter Act imposes on the principal employer, by virtue of the definition of an(S&gt; 3 ‘employer’, liabilities in respect of workmen whose services are lent or let on hi^e to him. That Act also imposes on the principal employer himself, the primary liability for payment of compensation in respect of contractor’s work men, giving him however the right to indemnify himself from the contractor who executes any work for the principal. The War Injuries (Compensation Insurance) Act does not impose on the principal employer any liability to pay compensation in respect of workmen employed by contractors. The Act further provides that it shall not be necessary for the contractor to insu/e against the liabilities imposed by the Act where the contract or arrange ment'is for a term of less than a month. As will be clear from other provisions of the Act, although the workman may be employed for a short term the interests of the workman who sustains injuries, or in the event of his death, of his depen dants, are preserved. Compensation in this respect will be payable directly out of the insurance fund, although no insurance of the liability of the employer is necessary in this respect. The liabilities of the contractor and the principal have been defined in clause , 21 of the Scheme as follows: — ‘‘The contractor .—(a) The contractor shall be under an obligation in like- manner as if he were any other employer for insuring the workmen working under him. (b) The contractor shall be responsible for informing the principal of the name of the Government Agent with whom he intends to insure. The principal .—The principal shall be responsible for bringing to the notice of the Government Agent with whom he has insured the existence of any contractors working under him. The principal will not be responsible for the accuracy of figures included in the applications made by the character.” The Insurance Fund. The War Injuries Compensation Insurance Fund will consist of all sums received by way of insurance premiums or by way of payments made on com positions of offences or by' way of expenses or compensation awarded by the Court out of any fine imposed under the Act or by way of penalties imposed under the Scheme. The Fund will be utihsed to pay sums required for the payment of compensation to workmen, for the remuneration or expenses of agents employed for the insurance scheme and for payment of the cost of admi-' nistering the Scheme. The Fund cannot be utilised to pay compensation to workmen employed by the Crown for the obvious reason that the Crown is not required to pay insurance premiums in respect of such workmen. As stated earlier the Central Government is required to make advances to the Fund when the amount standing to the credit of the Fund is not adequate for the purposes of the Act or the Scheme. The Act makes an important provision regarding the balances in the Fund: “If when all payments which have to be made out of the Fund have been defrayed any balance remains in the Fund, the balance shall be constituted into a Fund to be utilised and administered by the Central Government for the benefit of workmen”. Assessment of Claims and Payment of Compensation. The compensation payable under the Act will be only in respect of war injuries for which provision for basic relief is already made in the War Injuries Scheme. As every case of compensation under the Act must already have been a case of relief under the War Injuries Scheme, the work of assessment of claims can easily be done by the “Claims Officers” under the War Injuries Scheme. The War Injuries Compensation Insurance Scheme therefore provides that theam { I same “Claims Officer' as would make decisions under the War Injuries Scheme should decide applications for compensation under the present Act. The Scheme also specifies that the compensation payable under this Act may he withheld, cancelled, reduced or reviewed, if the award under the War Injuries Scheme is withheld, cancelled, reduced or reviewed, the appropriate authorities under both Schemes being the same. Thus the same machinery as administers the War Injuries Scheme will be utilised for the purpose of the War Injuries Compensation Insurance Scheme As regards payment of compensation, payments will be made at Post Offices W through Government Treasuries. ^ the^Scheme^ 8 ^ 6 ^ ^ pa * yment ' ° f com P ensation by instalments. (Clause Application to Indian States.

It aJso provided that no compensation should be payable under the Workmen’s Compensation xict in respect of a war injury. Workmen under that Act are now only entitled to receive relief from Government under the War injuries Scheme. 2. in more highly industrialised countries where variations in the industrial wage scale are not so large as in India, payments under the Personal Injuries beheme are, in respect oi labour, both relief and compensation. In India the amount of relief under the W ar injuries Ibcheme does not at present give higher paid labour adequate compensation, it is impossible for Government them selves either to increase generally the scale of relief under the War Injuries bcheme oi to undertake a liability to pay further compensation to a particular class of employees from Government funds. It is, however, reasonable that that obligation should be put on certain employers- There is also probably more danger to employees in factories and other industrial concerns (which may be a target for enemy attack) than there is elsewhere. 3. The Bill imposes on employers of essential services, of factory and mine laboui, in major ports, and other employments to be specified, an obligation to pay compensation in respect of war injury to their workmen, calculated to amount to the difference between the amount paid by Government under the War Injuiies bcheme and the amount which would have been payable under the Workmens Compensation Act if the war injury had given a right to com pensation thereunder. I his will mean additional payments in respect of labour drawing roughly over Rs. 24 a month. 4 Many employers are prepared to undertake the extra liability but the liability may prove either an embarrassment or an impossibility in the case of a. factory w'hich might be seriously damaged by enemy action, unless insurance can be taken out to cover the risk. It is understood that few insurance com panies are now prepared to cover such r^sks although in a few cases insurance in this matter has been effected. The Bill therefore provides for compulsory insurance with the Central Government, of the liability referred to above by employers throughout British India. 5. A piovision has also been made to extend the scheme of insurance to employers in States provided that provisions substantially corresponding to the provisions of this Bill are made in that State. xi follows closely the War Risks (Goods) Insurance' Ordinance and the War Risks (Factories) Insurance Ordinance.

But we are of opinion that steps should be taken to unite opinion on the proposed Scheme and rules before &gt;hey are made, and we have received an assurance that this will be done bv cireuhn ting them beforehand to the All-Indio associations of employers and employees We have also been assured that a similar course will be pursued before ,m- amendment affecting the principles of the Scheme is subsequently made Sub-clause (.5) (b).

Clause 12 \[new). —We have inserted in the Bill provision on the lines of section 12 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, imposing upon the princi pal employer, where contract labour is employed for the execution of any work of the principal employer, liability for the payment of compensation under the Bill to the workmen so employed. For the assessment of the principal’s insurance premium, the principal will require to obtain wages figures from the contractor. Sub-clause (2) enables provision for this to be made in the Scheme. Clause 13 (formerly 11). —The changes made enable the authorities admi nistering the Scheme to call for certificates, and restrict the exercise of the power of entry given by the clause to cases in which 48 hours’ prior notice of the intention to make such entry has been given. Clause 13 has been, omitted as unnecessary in view of the arrangements which we understand the Scheme will make for direct payment of compensation cut of the Fund. * \Clause 18 (formerly 17). —We have removed the, general power given to the Central Government to exempt employers from the provisions of the Bill. Clause 19 (formerly 18). —The addition made to sub-clause (2) (a) is intended to enable adjustments to be made, if necessary, for the present-day dearness of living allowances drawn by workmen in addition to their ordinary wages. The pew sub-clause (2) (g) merely rectifies an oversight. 2. The Bill was published m the Gazette of India dated the 13th March 1943. ' ' 3.

In reference to new clause 12 it was agreed at the Select Committee Meeting that m the case of short term contracts which do not extend to a period of more than a month, 'while the workmen under the contractor will be eligible to &lt;'et compensation from the Fund, there will, howfever, be no obligation either 'on the employer or on the contractor to make returns in respect of the men employed •or their wages, or to pay any premium. If the period of contact, however extends beyond a month, the machinery laid down in the Workmen’s Compensa tion Act shall generally apply; but the Bill shall impose an obligation on the contractor to submit through his principal employer a return as regards the strength of the labour force, the wages paid and the amount of premium payable or paid m respect of such workers. The contractor shall Supply all information through the principal employer and shall be responsible for the payment of pre- mium in respect of his workers.

QE 40135, Cliffords Inn, Fleet Street, LONDON E.C.4. Mr. Hanna, I send you herewith a copy of a letter I received on the 29th &lt; T une froir t r. R, T. j eel of the India Office, concerning Employees* com pensation in respect of death or injury arising from the war. liy delay in writing this letter has been occasioned by a desire thoroughly to consider ay advice to you. That advice is this 14th July, 1943. The United kingdom and the United States of America and, I be lieve I am ri^t in saying, India, undertake responsibilities for the ueath or injury of their Subjects where such death or injury arises from or as a result of enemy action. The Governrtent of India appear to have taken exce tion to what seems to tho/r, to be discrimination by the Company apainst their British- India Mnployeee in favour of the Company** United States and Dritish- 2uropean ,irLployees. The aovarnraent of Indio find b difficulty, which I can fully appreciate, in assisting in any such discrimination. It re mains, therefore, I think, for the Company to withdraw their generous if perhaps a trifle misguided, suggest! n to the Government of India and to leave all Employees to whatever claims they may have against their respective States. To take this attitude may conceivably remove a llt'tl® difficulty which the Government of India might labour under as a result of your suggestion. The third paragraph of Mr. heel’s letter under consideration would appear to i .;.ose o burden upon the Company (in common, of course, with other Employers) to which the Employers might object. I have no knowledge of whether the necessary legislation has been passed, and, if so, what is the present form of it; X will roake enquiries into this if you think it necessary. It is not stated whether or not the Indian legislation referred to has been or will be extended to Bahrain; if it is, then, in my view, it is a further argument in su port of my suggest ion above. The implications of the fourth paragraph of kr. Reel’s letter tempt one to enlarge upon the benefit of the continuance of the Cosipeny’s operations, not only to the State whose inhabitants have thereby been saved from destitution, but to the *ur Lffort as a whole.kr* Reel’s laat pera^raph is one wMoh it is not neceasarj’ for me to cor:uent upon. I would lile to haTe your instructions on the formal reply (if any) that is to be mad© to kr» leal in due course. I am, of course, glad that the risk of injury or damegre to person or pro erty is now remote from the scene of the Company’s operations. In any event, it would be rather a pity if this letter fror Ur, Peel were to cause any feeling of dissatisfr.otion in your mind. The principles involved are wide, important end puzzling and incapable, I think, of being thrashed out by letter. C-- 0 - As I have said at the beginnix^ of letter, I cen appre ciate fully the attitude of the Government of India and have every sympathy with them in regard to it, and that is why I have suggested that the Company should withdraw proposals of a discriminatory character, rather than that they should attempt to be generous to everyone.

Dear Peel, This is formally to acknowledge receipt of your letter (Reference EXT.2427/43) of the 28th instant. R.T.Peel Esq., C.B.E. M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.&amp; h INDIA OFFICE, 7/HIIEHAIL, EXT. 2427/43* LONDON. S. W, 1. 2&amp;Jmie, 1943 . Dear Ballantyne, With reference to my letter No. Ext. 3862/42 of November 19 th last, vie have now received the Government of India’s reply to the points which we put to them on the question 01 the compensation of your Company *s employees in Bahrein for death or injuries arising from the war, and I am therefore In a position to give you some further indication of our views. Your letter of 28fch October last contained the text of a cable from your Company which stated in effect that they did not feel justified in accepting liability for paying compensation in respect of -jar injuries sustained by their Indian employees at Bahrein, on the ground that employers in siiallar industries in India were exempt from any such liability. But, as the .j^overnment of Indict point out, this argument is not a valid one since, according to their information, neither in the United Kingdom nor in the U. S.A. any more than in India has any liability in respect of war injuries to their employees been placed upon employers* Nevertheless your Company have undertaken to pay, in respect 01 their American and European employees who are killed or totally c.l permanentdisabled as a result of war action while on the Company * s premises, double the benefits ordinarily payable under the California. State Compensation Act, That boing sc, it seems difficult to see any justification for aiiy differentiation in the treatment of your Company^ Indian employees, who equally with the United Kingdom and United States employees are serving overseas, and it would appear H.R.Ballantyne Esq,, The Bahrein Petroleum Co,Ltd., Cliimoras Inn, Fleet Street, S.C.4. equitable/equitable that in their case your Company should undertake to pay double the compensation which would ordinarily be payable under the Indian T/orkr.ien's Compensation Act. As these Indian employees number little more than 200, while the risks of war injury in Bahrein arc now remote, it is hoped that the Company will see its way to accept this proposal. In view of all the circumstances, it is not the intention of the Government of India to extend the War Injuries Ordinance 1941 to British Indians in Bahrein. The Government of India have also informed us that they have recently introduced legislation to provide for a War Injuries Insurance Scheme in which, among others, all employers of workers notified under the Essential Services (Maintenance) Ordinance, other than the Crown, will be compelled to participate. Such employers will be obliged to pay cls compensation for war injury to their workmen the difference between the amount of relief paid by Government under the Indian War Injuries Scheme and the amount which would have .been payable under the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act if it had boon applicable. When therefore this legislation is in operation, it will no longer bo the case that employees in similar industries in India are exempt from liability to pay compensation for war injuries. In this- connection your Company will doubtless not overlook the fact that the restrictions imposed under Persian Gulf Defence Regulation No. 2 of 1942 (which of course applies to all British employees of your Company including Indians), while they were dictated by reasons arising out of the war, in fact conferred considerable benefit on the Company since they ensured that at a highly critical period a supply of skilled labour was available for the Company’s operations. With/I * &gt;• 'with regard to the question cf conpensation for v/ar injuries to Bahreinis employed 'by your Company, who are in a different category from the Indian employees since they are working in their homeland, it is suggested that it should be left to the Government cf Bahrein to negotiate with your Company for the provision of such protection for those concerned* Yours sincerely, CSgd.)

It will be I'anecfcered that the Bahrein Petroleum Company wish to disavow all liability for paying contponsation for war injuries to their Indian employees at Bahrein on ihe ground that similar industries in India are exempt from any such • liability. They likewise want to deny any such responsibility in regard to their Bahreini employees. £n his letter of October 28th last Mr. Ballantyne, the Ccnpany’s London representative, went further and suggested that they should extend this disavowal to all their employees, including citizens of the U.K. and the U.S.A. vf ' y ■ i * ~ ^ *** ■-,.&lt;. . -i.. • . ^ . .i, . l - _ In making this suggestion Mr. Ballantyne was unaware that his Company had already undertaken to pay, in respect of their European and U.S. employees killed or totally or permanently disabled as a result of war action while on the Company’s premises, double indemnity,viz twice.the benefits payable under the California State We put Mr. Ballantyne right about this. We have now received the Government of India’s views on the Company's attitude and on the question generally. The Government of India point out in effect that since the Company have in fact agreed to compensate their European and U.S. employees although they were not b^id to do so, they should treat their Indian employees, whfllanikewise serving away from their home country, in the same way, instead of classing them with their Bahreini employees, winhe^serving at home. They therefore suggest that the Company should undertake to pay, in respect of Indian employees killed or totally or permanently disabled as a result of war action, double the compensation which would ordinarily be payable under the Indian Workmans' Compensation Act. Paragraph 3 of the Government of India's letter points out that the Company's statement that similar industries in India have been exempted from this class of liability will shortly cease to be correct, in view of the introduction of the War Injuries (Compensation Insurance) Bill. Under this Bm/w Rill workers who sustain war injuries will receive conrpensation up to the amount which would have been payable had the Indian Workmftns &gt; Condensation Act been applicable* If the Company accept the Government of India's proposal, their Indian employees who sustain war injuries will receive double this amount* But no doubt the Government of India wdflLlJljustify this discrepancy on the ground that Indians working overseas deserve better treatment than those working in their own country* • a * * • ^ • Paragraph 4 refei^ee. to Persian Gulf Defence Regulation No. 2 of 1942 (copy below) which is designed to prevent employees of certain undertakings in the Gulf which are essential to the war effort from leaving their employment without the permission of the Political Authorities*. The Government of India's reference appears to mean either that one good turn deserves another or that Indians, having been prevented from leaving their employment and returning hcaae should not be deprived of contingent benefits which will soon be enjoyed* by their^*brethren in India* This latter interpretation, although probably the correct one, is somewhat inconsistent with the statement that follows,viz that the Government of India do not propose to extend the War Injuries Ordinance 1941 to British Indians in Bahrein* The Government of India conclude by expressing the opinion that the question of providing similar protection . for the Company's Bahreini employees should be left to be settled between the Bahrein Government and the Company. The Government of India's reasoning appears to be , sound, and the draft below passes on what they say, unchanged in substance, to the Company's London representative. As they point out, the risks of war injuries in Bahrein are now remote, and so the whole, question is really academic. Do you concur in the draft?ifo 1 ' w To OOVBaCSNT OF INDU.

It also prowded that uo eompeusatiou should be payable under the Workmen s Coi.jpeusatiou Act m respect ol a war injury. Workmen under that Act are now only entailed to receive reliel Irom Oovernmeut under the War injuries bcheine. 2. In more highly industiiali^d countries where variations in the industrial ' aye scale are not so large as in India, payments under the Personal injuries beheme are, in respect ol labour, both rchei and compensation. In India the amount ol rebel under the War Injuries Scheme does not at present give higher paid labour adequate compensation, it is impossible lor Government them selves either to increase generally the scale ol reliei under the W’ar injuries Scheme or to undertake a liability to pay further compensation to a particular class ot employees from Government lunds. it is, however, rca&amp;onable that that obligation should be put on certain employers- There is also probably more danger to employees in lactones and other industrial concerns (which may be a target lor enemy attackj than there is elsewhere. 3. The Bill imposes on employers of essential services, of factory and mine labour, in major ports, and other employments to be specified, an obligation to pay compensation in respect of war injury to their workmen, calculated to amount to the difference between the amount paid by Government under the War Injuries Scheme and the amount which would have been payable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act if the war injury had given a right to com pensation thereunder. This will mean additional payments in respect oMabour drawing roughly over Bs. 24 a month. 4 Many employers are prepared to undertake the extra liability but the liability may prove either an embarrassment or an impossibility in the case of a factory which might be seriously damaged by enemy action, unless insuranco can be taken out to cover the risk. It is understood that few insurance com panies are now prepared to cover such mks although in a few cases insurance in this matter has been effected. The Bill therefore provides for compulsory insurance with the Central Government, of the liability referred to above, by employers throughout British India. 5. A provision has also been made to extend the scheme of insurance to employers in States provided that provisions substantially corresponding to the provisions of this Bill are made in that State. fi.

You should perhaps see this, in view of the Viceroy's strongly-worded personal telegram of the 19 th November^in which he invoked your assistance in 'getting the position cleared*' The attitude of the Treasury ha been difficult, and it can hardly be said that the positicr has been entirely cleared; but I think that we can feel that we have teetered the substance of what the Govern ment of India wanted. The question was started by an enquiry from the Bahrein Petroleum Company as to their being indemnified against war damage to their properties. Consideration of this problem led to our suggesting to the Treasury that they might extend to Bahrein and Koweit the following 'statement of intention 1 which the Treasury had agreed to apply to the Colonial Empire:- 'It will be the general aim of H. LLG. after the war that, with a view to the well-oeing of the people and the resumption of productive activity, property and goods destroyed or damagec in the Colonial Empire should be replaced or repaired to such extent and over such a period of time as resources permit. If the resources of any part of the Colonial Empire are insuffic ient to enable this purpose to be achieved without aid, H, L1.G. would be ready to give what assistance they can in conjunction with such common fund or organisation that may be established for post-war reconstruction,' The Treasury replied that they could not agree that these Sheikhdoms shokiid be regarded as covered by this statement, but that the Government of India could of course do something for them, if they chose, at their own expense. It/It was this reply (and perhaps especially the latter # part of it) that provoked the telegrams from the Government of India and the Viceroy in November. Ie wrote again to the Treasury in December,'and the Treat iry reply made no further suggestion that India should bear' the responsibility, but aimed rather at shelving the question. Their letter was however based on obvious misconceptions, and after further correspondence in which these were pointed out the Treasury agreed that the Bahrein Petroleum Company might be informed that the y were regarded as covered by the ’statement of intentionbut that it was hoped that any assurances to the Sheikhs could be avoided. This was a considerable advance on the part of the Treasury (indeed in my view an acceptance in substance of our view), but would have left the position unsatisfactory as regards the Sheikhdoms, as apart from the Company. As a result of further discussions, the Treasury hare now agreed that the Company may be informed that they will be treated in the same way as oil companies operating in such territories as North Borneo (to which, it is understood, the ’statement of intention^* has been extended), and that the Government of India may be further consulted on the question of giving assurances to the Sheikhs. In ny view (but l,Ir, Peel does not go so far as this) the recent correspondence clearly implies that the Treasury are willing to regard the ’statement of intention’ as applying to Bahrein and Koweit (and also, though this seems to me a minor question, to agree to the Sheikhs being given assurances to that effect), provided only that there is no risk of the Sheikh of Bahrein claiming monies that are intended for the Petroleum Company - a point that for practical purposes appears to present no difficulty. As stated above, this seems to me to secure the substance of what the Government of India wanted, and I see f no reason why they should wish to pursue the question of giving assurances to the Sheikhs, unless the Sheikhs themselves raise the question. It is to be hoped indeed that the whole question has now become academic.Register No. Ext. 1693/43 EXTERIIAL DEPARg.ISNT Letter ^Telegram from Dated Rec. 19 Formally acknowledged Date. Initials.

After our initial failure to persuade the Treasury to agree to the application to Bahrein and Koweit of the statement of H.M.G.’s intentions with regard to the replacement or repair of property and goods destroyed or damaged in the Colonial Empire as a result of the war (copy of statement flagged at Ext. 5035/42), we referred the matter to the Government of India. Their reply (which was vigorously supported in a personal telegram from the /iceroy) urged the necessity of achieving for Bahrein and Koweit position reached with regard to war damage in the Colonial Empire (and also in Burma and Newfoundland, to which the statement has also been applied). Our letter of December 8 th passed on to the Treasury, with Secretary of State 1 s support, the arguments in the two telegrams from India (Ext. 6322 i/42). 3. There has followedflvoluminous correspondence in which the Treasury have shown themselves very reluctant to agree to anything which might add to their existing commit ments. In support of their attitude they have put forward a number of arguments of doubtful soundness or relevance # and these we have successfuly rebutted. Although we have failed to convert them wholly to our views, a certain amount of progress has been made. As shown below, this has necessitated our dealing separately with the two cognate questions - (a) Y/hat reply should be given to the Company’s enquiries; and (b) What assurances, if any, should be given to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. 4» With regard to (a), the Treasury have agreed to our giving the Company the assurance set out din r iiflj iph 2 of our letter No. Ext. 69^7/43 of March 5 th last. This formula maices no reference to the statement of H.M.G-. *s intentions. Its purpose and scope are described in our letter of March 5th and in the draft Express Letter to the Government of India below. In the improved war situation there seems no reason why this formula should not satisfy the Compani£|. A draft letter conveying it to them is submitted* ^ 5» In discussing point (b) with the Treasury, our position has not been strong owing to the fact that, so far as we know, neitner of the Sheikhs has ever raised the question of compensation i or, fjt he provision of funds for the replacement or repair of, possible war damage. Nor have we been able to argue that, by giving the proposed assurance to the Sheikhs at this stage of the war, any considerable political advantage would be gained. So far as Koweit is concerned, it is most improoable that any damage of the kind in question could be done to the oil field; since all the wells have been plugged, all operations suspended and the equipment evacuated* x* xi/ lreasur y have also objected that any assurances given o the oheikhs might lead them to expect that they themselves scould be the recipients of any funds paid out in respect of damage done to the Oil Companies^properties^; and that in such circumstances it might be difficult to ensure that these funds were passed on to the Companies. Our letter No. Ext. 1232/4-3 of March 29thwts intended to set the Treasury’s mind at rest on/2, J /L; u v\ ^-Wl/&lt;.t^/L, ^*U&lt;_ U ^K~C ^ u *^ i t ^ |S ^-&gt;C ^Trf^. on this score; and their letter of April 2nd (below the drafts) agrees to the course of action we had proposed on the understanding that we can secure the safe receipt by the Oil Companies of any payments due to them. Our proposed course of action consisted in our giving the agreed assurance to the Bahrein Petroleum Company (see paragraph 1+ above) and asking the Government of India and the Political Kesident whether, in the improved war situation, they would be prepared to agree that, provided it is understood that Bahrein and Koweit are now included in the general statonent of H.M.G.’s intentions with regard to war damage, nothingjoe said to^the Sheikhs unless they themselves raise the point. This^s done in the draft Express Letter below.

As regards this particular objection, I have explained that, in view of the wording of the statement of ’s intentions, I have assumed that the question at issue relates to the provision of funds to be devoted (and presumably under conditions to ensure that they are devoted) to the replacement and repair of property and goods with a view to the resumption of productive activity in Bahrein and Koweit; and that, so far as such funds are concerned, I should anticipate no difficulty either in securing that any funds intended for the Companies were passed on if paid in the first instance to the Sheikhs, or if necessary in explaining to the Sheikhs that the payment of funds direct to the Ccmpanies was the natural method of giving effect in this particular direction to the statement of intention as applied to their territories. 5* In view of the improved circumstances of the war and the removal of any immediate danger to the Persian Gulf Oil fields, it could not be contended that any considerable political advantage would be derived from the giving of the assurance in question to the Sheikhs; while in the case of Koweit, where the Oil Company’s operations have been suspended and their equipment evacuated, it seems highly improbable that there is in fact any danger of damage of the kind in question being inflicted on the oilfield. I therefore agreed, in the light of the Treasury’s strong objections to making any statement to the Sheikhs, that, on the understanding that the Balirein Petroleum Company might be informed immediately as in paragraph 2 above, I would refer the natter to you again to ascertain whether in the changed circumstances you would be prepared to agree that, provided it is understood that Bahrein and Koweit are now regarded as included in the general statement of H.M.G.'s intentions with regard to war damage, no assurance to this effect need be given to.the Sheikhs, unless they themselves raise the point - in which case a further approach to the Treasury would be necessary.

V t k-X lr~^irA r riL* rLooking again at this correspondence in the light of Sir D.Waley’s letters, there is one point in regard to which - in case there might ever be anything in it - I feel that we must safeguard ourselves. There has*been a good deal of use of the word ’compensation’. It appears in the draft below, and also (in a sense that might be different) in the proposed reply to the Company; and I observe that in the Government of India’s telegrams of November they spoke of the Sheikhs receiving compensation. .As I understand the 'statement of intention’ it makes no provision for 'compensation’in the wide sense, but only for a particular form of compensation, conditional on the assistance supplied being devoted to the replacement or repair of property and goods for the purpose of the resumption of productive activity. Presumably this alone is what Sir D.Waley is talking about (and also what is intended to be covered by the latter part of the proposed reply to the Company). But if there were any question of the Company receiving compensation in general, without any obligation to devote it to the resumption of work in Bahrein, the Sheikh would have a similar claim, and we could not agree to its being barred^by reason r ‘ of the assurance given to the Company. To cover, this point, the passage in brackets in the draft might perhaps be amplified somewhat as lows: 'In saying this, we assume in view of the wording of the ’statement of intention' that all that we are discussing in the present connection is the provision of funds to be devoted (and presumably under conditions to ensure that they are devoted) to the replacement and repair of property and goods with a view to the resumption of productive activity in Bahrein.

My only point is that we ought not to give any assurance which will entitle the Sheikhs to expect that any money will he paid to them in respect of claims by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The assurance as applied to Bahrein would end up by saying that if the resources Bahrein are insufficient to enable damage to be repaired without aid, H.M. G. would be ready to give what assistance they can in conjunction with such common fund or organisation that may be established for post-war reconstruction.

It will be remembered that after prolonged correspondence the Treasury have agreed that the Bahrein Petroleum Company may, if they press the matter, be informed that they are regarded as covered by the statement of H.M.G-'s intentions with regard to post-war compensation for war damage; but that they are reluctant to agree to the giving of any assurances to the Governments of Bahrein and Koweit. Our letter No.Ext.697/43 of March 5th pointed out the anomaly of informing the Company that they are covered by a statement which has elsewhere been applied toviiole territories; and made it clear that, in face of the strong representations of the Government of India, we could not reply to the Company as proposed without saying anything to the Sheikhs. In order to deal with this situation, our letter proposed that our reply to the Company should give them an assurance of fair treatment without making any reference to the statement of intention;but that this reply should be given without prejudice to the question of what communication should be made to the Sheikhs, on which we should have to consult further with the Government of India and the Political Resident. The Treasury letter below agrees to our proposed reply to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, bu t only on conditio n that no assurance should be given to the Sheikhs. If therefore we were now to write to the Company on the agreed lines, we should have forfeited any chance of being able to tell the Sheikhs hereafter that they are regarded as covered by the statement. Clearly we could not do this without consulting the Government of India and the Political Resident. Moreover the reason advanced by the Treasury for their attitude is clearly a trumped up excuse for continuing the obstructive attitude they have maintained throughout the correspondence. The draft letter below is intended to make a further effort to induce them to agree to the proposals in our letter of March 5th or fc ^ tv-&lt; ' Ust ^ (jjRy s-t ir d Cv — My9o U ^ Glreazurs (Hfyambers, $&gt;reat (ffitarQt ^trcft. 11th March, 1943- In reply t0 your let ter of the 5th March (Ext. 697 / 43 ) we agree to the proposed reply to the Bahrein Petroleum Company subject to the following point. * If we give any assurance to the Sheikhs, they will presumably expect any funds to he paid to them, and I should have thought one could not safely count on those funds being passed on to the Company. If we had given the proposed reply to the Company and the funds were not passed on to them, they would accuse us of having misled them. It seems to me, therefore, essential that no assurance should be given to the Sheikhs and I should have thought that these somewhat primitive territories are In really quite a different position from British Colonial Governments.

Y/e shall then presumably have to fall back on the reply to the Company previously contemplated, and i am not altogether clear how this now stands. Six 1 ). ./aley’s letter seems to give a new turn to the discussion - and I suppose this is the intention, though it is possible to read what he says as consistent with previous ideas. as I understand it, what we have been discussing hitherto is the application of the ’’statemeht of intention” to the Sheikhdom of Bahrein, and the answer to the Company we have been contemplating, if they were not simply to be informed that the question must be left for consideration after the war, was, I take it, that it was agreed that the 'statement of intention” applied to Bahrein. Sir D. t »aley r now talks of telling the Company that they are regarded as covered by the 'statement of intention”. as Mr. Johnston’s note suggests, this might be a very different proposidon, though there is perhaps not much in this for practical purposes in the present case. Sir D, Waley’s letter also suggests that he wishes to agree to something less than the application of the 'statement of intention' to Bahrein,and probably this is what he does mean - though it is not necessarily to be inferred from what he says, and there does not seem to be much point in cutting down the assurance in this way. We might perhaps press him a little more on this point,and in any case had better make sure whi^«/2 . wifcat he is agreeing to? We do not want to have any misunderstanding either with the Treasury or with the Company, Some such additions as I have suggested to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the draft would perhaps serve the purpose. . /.X. L,Under Secretary of State, The Treasury have now agreed that the Bahrein Petroleum Company may, if they press the matter, be informed that they are regarded as covered by the r&gt;teraent of Gr» 1 s intentions with regard to the replacement or repair of property and goods in the colonial Empire destroyed or damaged as a result of the war. On the other hand, they deprecate any assurances being given to the Governments of Bahrein and :.o//eit ,on the ground that any conpensatory payments v/ould be made direct to the Oil Companies and not to these Governments. It will be remembered that the Viceroy and the Government of India have urged very strongly that, for political reasons ; the formula should be applied to the Sheikhdoms as a vdiole. This would, of course, involve the giving of assurances to the Governments. On receiving the Treasury letter,therefore, we felt that before we could agree that the matter should be settled as they proposed, we should have to consult once more the Government of India, and perhaps the Political Resident as well* oreover, it seemed anomalous to confine ourselves to informing the Company that they were covered by a formula which else where has been applied to whole territories. On this point we sought the advice of the Burma Office, and Mr. Johnston* s note of February 16th (below the draft) ^escribes what has been done in the way of giving publicity to ohe application of the formula to the Colonies and Burma, and explains how it is expected to be put into effect. At the same time we felt it desirable that our reply to the Company’s letter of March 17th of last year (Ext.lijd.3/42) should not be much longer delayed. ^he Petroleum Division have suggested that the Company ought to be satisfied with an assurance that, in the matter of compensation for war damage, H.M.G* will treat them no less t avourably than Oil Companies operating iV■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ in such territories as North ii)meo. ^he object of this would be trrwfc, while leaving the way open for the possible assumption by the U.S.Government of part of the burden of any compensation, to satisxy Company that, so far as H.h.G. is concerned, the i act of their American ownership v/ould not prejudice their chances of equitable treatment# Mr. Johnston’s note shows that some of our assumptions regarding the purpose aiid scope of the formula may have been at fault; but it does not quarrel wxth - indeed it implicitly supports^the line of action describ above.

March, 1943* Dear Via ley, Thank you for your letter of February 6th, from which we are glad to note that the Treasury agree that the Bahrein Petroleum Company can, if they press the matter, be informed that they are regarded as covered by the statement of H.M.G.’s intentions with regard to war damage. Eyres has told us orally that the Foreign Office also agree to this. I am not sure whether you would propose that the actual form of words quoted above from your letter should be used in replying to the Company, or whether they should be told that it is agreed (not that ‘they’ are), but that the Sheikhdom of Bahrein is to be regarded as covered by the 'statement of intention'. We have hitherto understood that the statement of intention is applicable to territories, and not directly to individual enterprises in those territories. For this reason among others vie feel that it would be somewhat anomalous to reply on these lines to the Company without saying anything to the Government of Bahrein. From Syers' letter to Creasy of April ?th last, it appears that in the case of the Colonial Empire the statement was to be made to the territories (which presumably means the Governments) concerned and was moreover to be given 'wide publicity”} and we under stand that this is very much what has actually happened. With regard to Burma, for instance, wc are told that both tne Government and Burma firms controlled from the United Sir David Waley, K.C.M.G. ,C.B. ,M.C., /Kingdom H.M.Treasury, S.W.l.Kingdom nre aware of the statement. In any case, you will remember that the Goverunent of India have urged strongly that Bahrein and Koweit should be placed on the same footing with regard to war damage as the territories to which the statement already applies, (vide my letter to Wilcox, No. Ext. 6324/42 of December 8 th), and we trust that your letter is to be read as agreeing to this. In these circumstances we feel that v/e can hardly reply t^ the Company as you propose without at the same time giving some explanation of the position to the Govornments of the two Sheikhdoms, and certainly not without further consultation with the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persinn Gulf. We are, however, anxious that our communication to the Company should not be much longer delayed, and we are attracted by the suggestion made in Bridgeman's letters of January 28 th and February 3 rd, reference P.E.78/6 , that we should give them an assurance of similar treatment to Oil Companies operating in such territories as North Borneo, without making any reference to the inclusion of the Sheikhdoms of Bahrein and Koweit in the general statement about war damage in the Colonial Empire. If you agree, we could then reply to the Company forthwith as follows»- 'The question of compensation for war damage generally will no doubt be a matter for post war consultation between the members of the United Nations. So far as H.M.G. is concerned, hov/ever, the Bahrein Petroleum Company will be treated, with regard to war damage sustained to their property in Bahrein, in the some way as oil companies operating in such territories as North Borneo'. /Thisf 'S °*3' This formula is designed to assure the Company that, although American owned and controlled, they would be treated no less favourably with regard to war damage than British owned and controlled Companies operating in territory of similar status in relation to the British Empire. At the sane time it leaves the way open for a possible assumption by the Government of the United States of part of the burden of compensation. It would, of course, N be made without prejudice to the question of giving assurances to the Bahrein and Koweit Governments, and we could then take up this question separately with the Political Resident and the Government of India. It is possible that in the improved circumstances of the war they might be prepared to agree that provided it is understood that Bahrein and Koweit are now included in the General Statement about war damage, nothing need be said to the Sheikhs, unless they themselves raise the point. Would you please let me know as soon as possible whether the Treasury concur. I am sending copies of this letter to Bridgeman, Eyres, Caine and Johnston. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. PEEL.DRAFT LETTER.

So far as is concerned, however, the Bahrein Petroleum Company will be treated, with regard to war damage sustained to their property in Bahrein, in the same way as oil companies operating in such territories as North Borneo.' This formula is designed to assure the Company that, although American owned and controlled, they would be treated no less favourably with regard to war damage than British owned and controlled Companies operating in territory of similar status in relation to the British Empire. At the same time it leaves the way open for a possible assumption by the G-ovemment of the United States of part of the burden of compensation. It would, of course,~f t n Seoretaryt fice. Secretary, Financial Departmep^j ^ ^ ’ \ t'4, LT* i10218 \aA7) The Treasury letter below gives a grudging and conditional agreement to our informing the Bahrein Petroleum Company that they are regarded as covered by the statement of H.M.C.'s intentions with regard to the replacement or repair of property and goods in the Colonial Empire destroyed oi^ dam aged as a result of the war. But the Treasury are reluctant tcT^sunilar assurances being given to the Governments of Bahrein and Xoweit, on the rather strange ground that any compensation would be payable to the Company and not to the Governments. The statement has presumably been communicated officially to the Governments of the territories to which it has hitherto been applied r and, so far as the Colonial Empire was concerned, it was to be given 'wide pxjblicity', (See the last page but one of Treasury letter to the Colonial Office of April 7th last). It therefore seems rather anomalous for us to reply as proposed to the Company without saying anything to the Bahrein Government. In any case, in view of the insistence of the Government of India and the Viceroy (see submission at Ext.6324/4^) that Bahrein and Koweit should be placed in the same positior^vith regard to war damage as ether tkiL territories to which thi c j*i£&amp; eaiiS^applies, we could not agree to the course envisaged by the Treasury without further consultation with the Government of India and the Political Resident. Would the Burma Office please say what procedure was followed in connection with the application of the statement to Burma. It is proposed to point out to the Treasury the objection described above, and to ask them to agree to our replying to the Company on lines recently suggested by the Petroleun Division of the M.F.P. A draft for this purpose follows, on which I should be glad to have your comments. It is to be hoped that the course proposed will not weaken our case if and when we have to press the Treasury to agree that the Sheikhs may be informed that the statement applies to their territories. But it may well be that the Government of India will be prepared to agree that, in view of the improvement in the war /situationsituation, it is now unnecessary to give the Sheikhs any such assurances. It certainly seems that to do this in the present circumstances would be of doubtful political value. /0 . M . . Subsequent to Mr. Syers' letter of the 7th April it was decided not to make a public announcement of the formula here, but that Colonial Govern»«w4«*fryf should be given discretion to publish it as and when they thought it desirable to do so. The formula was, however, communicated to various individuals and associations. Sir John Hay sent his correspondence with the Colonial Office to the Press ^eT^quite considerable notice has been taken of it. Steel Brothers published it in their report to their shareholders and Sir Kingsley Wood will probably give it in reply to a parliamentary Question almost immediately (incidentally, the draft of the reply shown to me stated that it applies to Burma but did not mention Newfoundland, of which I have now heard for the first time in this connection). The formula may, therefore, in spite of earlier intentions, be said to have received wide publicity. So far as Burma is concerned the Government and Burma firms controlled from here are aware of the formula. I cannot speak as regards Indian firms operating in 'Rurma but would expect them to know of it. Going beyond the terms of your reference I may perhaps help towards clearing up one of your difficulties vis-h-vis Sir D. Waley. We have been assuming, and I feel sure the Colonial Office also, that any compensation made available under the formula will be paid to Governments. I fear that perhaps insufficient notice may have been taken of the facts (a) That H.M.G. only come in after the resources of the part of the TDmpire concerned are found to be insufficient; and (b) That the object of the formula is not to compensate companies or individuals butto replace property or goods damaged 'with a view to the well-being of the people and the resumption of productive activity.' There is no guarantee that any sum available will be divided among Colonies, etc. (even after their own resources are taken into account) in proportion to the damage suffered. It will be for each to make out its case and what is necessary for the 'well-being of the people and the resumption of productivity' and it is only local governments who will be able to decide how what they may receive can best be distributed to this end. Companies^will not start up again or whose ( properties will be found to have been so badly damaged as to make redevelopment unprofitable should get nothing. Of course things may very possible not work out this way but it seems to t^e worth while to point out that, in the case of Burma at any rate, no individual company has been given any reason to believe that it will have a right to share in any compensation forthcoming or that if they should receive compensation it will necessarily be a free gift. It seems to me by no means impossible for example that dividends may be limited until the money advanced to make good damage has been repaid in part at any rate. /Dear Peel, s~ o. 9T &amp;TtHZur£ Clrantlttrs, ^5r£at ^5c0rg£ Street, S.M.K 6 th February, 1943* 1943 J Bahrein Petroleum Company.

I hope that we can avoid giving any assurances to the Governments of Bahrein and Koweit, for if at any time payments were to be made for the benefit of the Bahrein Petroleum Company commonsense would seem to indicate that payment would have to be made direct to the Company and not to the Government.

The object of the suggestion in nis second paragraph was to satisfy the Bahrein Petroleum Company that, although they are American- owned and controlled, they would be treated no less lavourably than British-owned and controlled companies operating on territory of similar status. At the same tame he thinks it will be as well to leave the way open for the U.S. Government to bear part of the burden of compensation in this case. The guarantee referred to in hds third paragraph was a vague promise of compensation fi&gt;r damage to oilfields, which was issued jointly by H.M.G. and the U.S. Government. It appiied m the first place only to the Dutch East Indies but it was afterwards extended to other territories in the East Indies such as North Borneo. -p i -i ^ talk with Mr. Bridgeman I drafted the following paragraph which, subject to the views of the Treasury, might form the basis of our reply to Mr. Ballantyne:- 'The question of compensation for war damage generally will no doubt be a matter for post-war consultation between the members of the United Nations. p^+r&gt; a T S is concerned, however, the Bahrein Petroleum Company will be treated, with regard to any war damage sustained to their property^intBahrein, in the same way as oil companies opermn^n^orth Bomeo H . 4 .K^ 1 Mr :u P S el a S r ees generally with the above, but thinks that we might wait to hear from the Treasury before showing them the suggested fonnula.Any reply to this letter should be addressed to The Secretary, &gt;' Ministry of Fuei,and Power.

Dear Peel, 1943 i In connection with your letter to Waley of January 26th, of Wiiich you sent a copy to Berthoud, we also feel that the position of the Bahrein Petroleum Company is much more similar to that of British oil companies operating, for example, in B.runei and Sarawak, than to that of those operating in Iraq and Persia. In the case of Kov/eit, it is in present circumstances unlikely that any problem will arise since the equipment has been evacuated and there is little except oil underground to destroy. I am wondering whether it might not satisfy Mr. Ballantyne if he were told that in the event of war damage occurring in Bahrein, the Bahrein Petroleum Company would, as far as this country is concerned, be treated in the same way as oil companies operating in such territories as North Borneo. In this connection you may probably be aware that in order to encourage effective denial, the United States issued a kind of guarantee of joint compensation, though the exact terms were somewhat indefinite. I am sending a copy of this letter to Waley, Caine, Johnston and Byres. [ INDIA OFkfc*- Yours sincerely, R.

Moreover, they were automatically brought into the war when H.M.G. declared war, and the rulers had no say in the matter at all. Their position is, in fact, completely different from that of Egypt, Iraq and Etersia, v/hcf are independent States with whom this country has T- eaties of Alliance, and there is no possible danger that the extension to Bahrein and Koto it of the assurance about war damage could justify any similar claim from those countries.2 . $teL*r\jl l/K &amp;~ Our case is, in fact, that these territories^tlwwgh oot 1 ''S'tally oemidorcd- part of the British -QccLcaaisi: En^)ire^-ea?a-^e«— 4$ A^£Ur cr|- e . •Hfctah.-1h&lt;? »f&gt;nio ftnoting-^a^certain territories/ nntinhlr the *SVva^o£ &gt;^vc/ A/p^/K ^tn-nlo j W^cA ^ ^ uu^ob^sfo^J , y iialay Statesj j^wha.oj^ are-' generaiA** regarded ao being-within-the' / Bmpiroj and that II.M.(J.—are roop^oiblo for thair v'olfarer ^ &amp;a£ '\JifriL*dS L cl 6Ji We- f-eel therefore that they-ought to bo^ covered by th£# statement of post-war intentions set out in Syer^s* letter to Creasy of 7th April. tKiajc/ca^. ^«x£ ’flyout' %r&amp;hASUr\ far'd It is true that the Sheikhs themselves have not raised the point ; and it may also be the case that the Bahrein #41 Company are less apprehensive about the danger^ to their properties a^nue-^they wrote in 1,larch.

Dear Peel, L I 943 7th January, 19U3- V/ilcox has shown me your letter of the 8 th December CS xt-632U/U2) about the Bahrein Petroleum Company. I would like to suggest as a practical matter that when the Bahrein Petroleum Company made their enquiry in July they presumably felt much more arprehensive about war damage than they do at the present time, and that accordingly there is a lot to be said for not answering their letter unles§ they write again. There is, of course, no need to say anything to the Sheikhs, who happily have not raised the matter. ^ i make this suggestion partly because it seems to me really very difficult to know what would be the right answer to give to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As I understand it, they are a company registered in Canada and wholly American-owned. They operate in territories which are in special treaty relations with the Government of India, but so far as I know the inhabitants of those territories are not British subjects and (I speak very much subject to correction) are not British protected persons. If, therefore, we extended to these territories the assurances about war damage given to the Colonies, I do not see how we could justify refusing also to extend those assurances to countries such as Egypt, Iraq and Persia, with whom we have special treaty relations, or to Turkey, if Germany were to invade Turxey and Turkey were to resist. You will understand that we should be exceedingly reluctant to undertake so far-reaching a commitment when the.only enquiry received . is from the Bahrein Petroleum Company so long ago as ^ last July. a e&gt; ExT.I’*-' I+' 1 - Certainly we would agree that it is morally right that these territories should be treated fairly and R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C., India Office. RECd. POL. DEPt. d JAN ,943no doubt politically expedient that they should he ^ treated generously. But does it follow that any assurances given should he given solely hy the United Kingdom on the ground that at present they are in a military area which is a United Kingdom defence liability? Would it not he more reasonable that any assurances given should he given jointly hy the United Kingdom, the U.S.A., and perhaps also Russia and China, and that if any assurance had to he given it should preferably take the form that the Bahrein Petroleum Company would not he treated in this matter less well than other companies operating outside British or Allied territory. Until we know what line is likely to he taken about reparations and restitutions, or about other comprehensive plans for making good war damage, it is difficult to give any precise commitments. When we know more about such matters - which may not be for many a long day - it may he easier to see how this American-ov/ned Canadian Company will fit into the general picture. I hope you will not think this reply too unhelpful. We fully appreciate the desire of the Viceroy that full attention should he paid to the need for treating these territories properly, hut it really is an impossible task to say anything very definite, if I am right in supposing that one could not treat them as part of the British Colonial Empire for this purpose without at the same time incurring far-reaching commitments in other directions.

Dear Peel, I have to acknowledge due receipt, with many thanks, of your letter EXT.5862/42 of the 19th Dovember with its accompanying enclosures. I have cabled to Kew York asking whether they ‘ have S0en the letters, copies of which you have kindly sent to me and so soon as I receive their re ply I will give the matter further consideration. Yours sincerely, R.T.Peel Esq., G.B.E., k.c., India Dffi ce&gt; Whitehall, S.W.l.MINUTE. 1. There has for some time been outstanding an enquiry from the Bahrein Petroleum Company with regard to compensation for damage to property by enemy actionijorby the application of 'scorched earth” measures on the orders of tne^authorities or the Bahrein Government. 2. In paragraph 4 of their telegram No.3894 of May 17th last, the Government of India agreed that the reply to the Company should be in accordance with what they understood to be the attitude of the Treasury, viz. that the question *2ould not be decided until after the war; and they added that it rould then be possible to assess more clearly the relative responsibilities of H.M.G* and themselves. Meanwhile, however, the Treasury had agreed to the publication of a statement (reproduced in our express letter to the Government of India of October 13th on Ext.5033/42) to the effect that it is the intention of H.M.G. to help in the replacement or repair of property and goods destroyed or damaged in the Colonial Sapire as a result of the war. It was felt in this Department that an attempt should be made to obtain the consent of the Treasury to the application of this formula to Bahrein and Koweit. This was done in Mr. Peel's letter to Mr. Syers No.Ext.2881/^2 of July 28th last. In describing our relations with the two Arab States this letter said that “£he political control which, by virtue of her treaty rights, H.M.G. exerciseSoVer these Sheikhdoms, is in practice exercised by the Government of India”. On the other hand it was emphasised that in as much as the C. in C. Middle East (now the C. in C. Persia-Iraq Command) was responsible for the defence of the Sheikhdoms, the military authorities on the spot-who might cause damage to be inflicted on property or issue orders for destructive measures would be the agents of ^sjmilitary command over which the Government of India had no control. It was argued that for this reason the question of compensation in the circumstances contemplated was one for consideration by H.M.G. rather than the Government of India. 3. The Treasury reply of September 15th (flagged) simply refused to agree to the two Sheikhdoms being covered by the formula (which had meanv/hile been extended to Burma and Newfoundland) • 4« The submission at Ext.5035/42 shows what action we took on receipt of the Treasury letter. On the one hand we wrote to the Treasury suggesting that if, as appeared, their refusal was based simply upon the fact that Bahrein and Koweit are not British territory, they were over-simplifying the problem; and we accordingly reserved our right to raise it again with them, should it become necessary to do so. On the other hand, now that the Treasury had declined to take ary responsibility for war damage in the two Sheikhdoms, it appeared necessary to ask the Government of India whether they still wished the Company to be told that the question could not^e decided until after the war - since their agreement to this reply^clearly assumed that the post-war discussion of the problem would not be pre-judged by any disavowal of responsibility on the part of H.M.G. 5* The Government of India have now replied urging the necessity of achieving for Bahrein and Koweit the position reached with regard to war damage in the Colonial Empire, Burma and Newfoundland. The official reply is vigorously supported by a personal telegram from the Viceroy. For the mos u part the two telegrams emphasise and amplify the arguments in our letter to the Treasury of July 28th No.Ext.288:1/42• But they take exception to the passage in that letter quoted in paragraph 2 above, on the ground that H.M.G. retained control in regard to all matters of high policy in the Arab Sheikhdoms andvare final arbiters in major questions arising therefrom. The locus classicus for the relative responsibilities of H.M.G. and the Government of India with regard to the Persian Gulf is still the^ Historical Summary of Events in Territories of the Ottoman Empire, Persia and Arabia affecting the British position eui the rersian Gulf 1907-1928, usually known as P.G.13. The following quotations show that the Government of India's statement of the position is correct:- ^ ^ The effect of the/Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of Bahrein affairs ••••••••••••• to the Government of India,/ n x now India Office * V A fc ua! a. te, o-'M tL e*dW-Uj.y / lZd-Z&gt;~ ^ An\ teje.. cM.

(Page 73)* The intention of the passage in our letter to the Treasury to which the Government of India and the Viceroy object was to explain that the immediate political^control over these Sheikhdoms - as opposed to the ultimate responsibility - is exercised by officers of the Government of India who take the major part of their orders from New Delhi. But the draft letter below is designed to remove any misunderstandings which this passage may have caused. 6. Possibly the Viceroy lays too much stress upon the danger to the Sheikhs of the destruction of their oilfields. At Koweit all the wells have already been permanently plugged and the machinery is being or has been removed; so that before any oil could be drawn from the field new machinery would have to be imported and new wells drilled. (Moreover since the Kuwait Oil Company never reached the stage of production a number of difficulties regarding the transport and shipment of the oil would have to be overcome). At Bahrein a number of wells have been plugged, and a programme has been laid down for the progressive plugging of the others if the situation should deteriorate. If this programme were to be worked out to its conclusion, all the wells would be permanently plugged, and the refinery and equipment would be destroyed, before the arrival of the enemy. Hence the benefits to be derived by the Sheikhs from their oil rezmtnotb would not be lost to them, but merely postponed ; ' . unless the enemy were able to overcome all the difficulties involved in developing the oilfields from the beginning. 7.. Two drafts are submitted (a) d.o. letter to the Treasury, which makes full use of the arguments in the two telegrams from India with the object of inducing them to reconsider their decision that the formula cannot be regarded as covering Bahrein and Koweit; (b) a personal telegram informing the Viceroy that we are going back to the Treasury, and explaining the intention of the passage in our letter of Judy 28th which he and the Government of India have questioned. * '» fc UfJi I'UaU- A. bs ta n«-f cKsA ' f ' An\ERAFT L3OTER, I txT- 631 .+ C.H*M.

The Viceroy, who is taking apersonal interest in ins question^has telegraphed to our Secretary of State stressing the necessity of establishing the position of the two Sheikhdoms with regard to compensation for war damage on the same basis as the territories already covered by the fomula mentioned above. He emphasises CL that ^situation in which Bahrein and Koweit, which constitute an oil supply of inestimable value from the . poj.nt oi view oi the war and as a reserve (a supply which would be still more important were the Germans to reach Abadan), should be required (a) oil our advice to join the Allies and to make u y\ Cr • 'n available to che Allies their oil production etc.; u to lace the risk of the destruction of an indu an industry ox bhe highest value because they have co-operated with the/the Allies; and (c; to De inforaed that they can receive no compensation hecause^ fek^ industry has been destroyed »qndor uhe iiisuCTtetiQna ^nn H.r, ii&gt;f&gt;r ± of tn a n f &gt;vo L'aM-UC^ • needs only to be stated for its political (to say nothing of its moral) impossibility to be seen.

You will see thau in Ivlay of last year, the Chief local Representative sent the- Political Agent a letter stating in effect that the Company could accept no liability for compensating their employees under a number of heads relating to war damage to their persons, families, and property# The 'Lit Political Agent was unable to reply until July ®th^ when, with regard to most of these heads, he simply took note of the Company's refusal of liability. /He2 . He suggested, however, that the Company might be liable, under .clause 7 of its Foreign Service Agreement, to compensate employees covered by that Agreement who might be killed or injured from causes connected with the war, if the death or injury could be shown to have arisen out of and to have been sustained in the course of the man's e mployment• He had already sent the Chief local Representative a letter, dated I^ay 27th, in paragraph 6 of which he asked whether the Company confirmed this liability. It this latter enquiry which has prompted the cable from New York quoted in ycur letter. Lfy reading of this cable is that your Company wishes to repudiate this liability on the ground that similar Companies in India are exempt from compensating their employees for war injuries^ We are not sure to what exemption the Company is referring; but we think the reference must be to section 4 °f fbe Indian War Injuries Ordinance 1941* under which employers are relieved of their liability to pay compensation or damages^ /under\il\ under the Workmen's Compensation Act or otherwise ; in respect of war injuries sustained by their employees. •’ . • . . 1 The main purpose of this Ordinance is to provide relief on a modest scale for war injuries sustained by all gainfully occupied persons; and txie Government of India have had under consideration •k WfwuJ £ a scheme whereby employers wouid^supplement the S* *r&gt; t* ■{fTW-V' ih relief payable under the Ordinance^up to the amount /stp. . / fKcd:, fkt l &amp; fivnncU OtiujL ^ A lAtivvC ^ CfiA/Xvw C/ifea pi h'kdl'UtA fYVA^hl ^ &lt;&amp;&gt; ^ ^ XaT C/jh'a ^ CtMlct* SiWm. ^jJJjUyU 4 ^ fsx ^ v &gt; ^mpdoynna would hp.ve receivedr-had the *j.

In May last, however, the Government of India told us that it might be possible to extend the Ordinance to British Indians injured in Bahrein. We are asking the Government of India whether they have given further consideration to this matteir. You will appreciate that, until we know whether any alternative means are, or are likely to be, available for the relief or compensation of your Company's employees, we are reluctant to comment upon your /Company'sCompany's proposal to accept no liability in respect of any war injuries which these employees sustain. 4 , /Wn W ^ ^ iv^a ^ jot &lt; ^vy ^ ^ friers You add that in your opinion this denial of ^ fwtfXA- responsibility should be extended to all the ; Company * 3 ^ &amp;JSL, In turf »&gt; 4^ employees, including British and Americans. On this point you may be interested to know that the Political Resident told us in kkrch last that he had ascertained from the Company's Local Management that European and American employees (but not members of their families) killed, or totally or permanently disabled while on the Company's premises as a result of war action would be paid double indemnity by the Company. The Political* Resident explained that by 'double indemnity' was meant * twice the benefits which would ordinarily be paid in v ' * -1 • • » tr* * • accordance with the provisions of the California * V State Compensation Act in respect to an employee killed -V or totally or permanently disabled while performing his M t dutiesJ and that indemnity under this Act was approximately one year's salary in the event of death. Yours sincerely, A .. &gt; &lt; f* (togd.) R. ' » y ♦ J4 ' &lt;?Wl £*» ^&lt;rMur\ L tYX CTuL* -I C^l' f M l ) ' &gt; «-N ' V V Uk &gt; Financial Secretary. ^ Please see the letter from the London Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company below. The enquiry from New York has evidently arisen from the enquiry in paragraph 6 of the letter dated ^-■^ay 2?th last, from the Political Agent at Bahrein to the Chief local -c . 'spresentative of the Company. You should also see the letters t c» exchanged - with a long interval between them - between the Political *5 Agent and the Chief local Representative (see the latter's letter of May 2bth 1941 at Ext. 6927/41 and the former's letter at the 8th July 1942, at Ext.4925/42). The present position is that the Political Agent ha^, as a general proposition, 'Serera, aeac of the Company’s refusal to accepl liability for compensating its Indian and Bahreini employees who may sustain injury owing to the war; but he has suggested that the Company may be liable, under clause 7 of its Foreign Service Agreement (flagged), to compensate employees covered by -that Agreement who may be killed or injured from causes connected with the war, if the death or injury can be shown to have arisen out-of and to have been sustained in the course of the man's employment. Paragraph 6 of the Political Agent's letter of May 27 th asked whether the Company confirmed this liability. Mr.Ballantyne's letter is by no means clear, but the Company appaiently now wish to repudiate this liability on the ground that similar industries in India are exempt from compensating their employees for war injuries. The Company seam to be referring to Section 4 of* the Indian »/ar Injuries Ordinance 1941 (flagged); I should be glad to know whether you agree or 'whether you think they are referring to some other exemption. The Ordinance does not, of course, apply to Bahrein, nor is there ar^y similar provision in force there for relief in respect of war injuries. If, therefore, we acquiesce in the repudiation by the Company of all liability, the effect will be to deprive the foreign Service employees of their - admittedly doubtful - contractual right to compensation, without giving them anything in its place. It is suggested tha.t if possible we should avoid any such acquiescence until the Ordinance has been extended to Bahrein and/or some other provision has been enacted in respect of war injuries there. Paragraph 3 of the /GovernmentGovernment of India's telegram 3^94 May 17th said that it might be possible to extend the Ordinance to British Indians injured in Bahrein; even if this were dene, at least two other questions would remain for consideration (a) the making of some similar provision covering Bahreinis, presumably at the expense of the Bahrein Government, (b) whether employers should be asked to supplement the relief payable under the Ordinance up to the amount their employees would have received had the Workmen's Compensation Act been applicable •-) &gt; * O 2 O ■% o o CC o 0$ -D &gt;5 cj &lt;o aS o A scheme for this purpose has been under consideration in India, and we should be glad of any information about,its progress, subsequent to the letter from the Labour Department of the Government of India ci^April 21st, 1942 (flagged). We were promised further information on this aspect of the matter in paragraph 3 the Government of India's telegram number 3^94* If.you agree with the above, we might reply to Mr.Ballantyne by sending him a copy of the letters exchanged between the Political Agent and the Chief local Representative, and of the Political, Agent's letter of May 2?th (he has probably not seen any of these); and by telling him that we cannot go farther than the Political Agent's letter of July 8 th without further reference to India. We might at the same time ask the Government of India whether they have given further consideration to the question of extending the Ordinance to British Indians in Bahrein^ inA then* p* on fadltk+JZyvidl* CttteA. With regard to Mr.Ballantyne's reference to European and American employees of the Company, we might tell him what the Political Agent says in paragraph 3 of his express letter to the Government of India of March 23 th last, at Ext.2869/42. — T. 6 *;. 1750w ' a &lt;d a &lt;o z* Co cj IK£ t!t •dJi- Mr. Lumby* This Department has heard nothing further about the proposal that employers should he asked to supplement the relief payable under the ordinance but an enquiry is being addressed to | the Government of India. , ^^1*' I know of no special^arrangeiient by the Government of India imp &amp; exempting industries in India from compensating their war employees for war injuries. Indeed, I cannot think that any such arrangement would be necessary in view of the terms of Section 4 of the Indian /ar Injuries ordinance 194L, to which I think Mr. Ballantyne must be referring. But the Bahrein Petroleum Company's reasoning in this regard is not v/ithout its flaw. Although the Government of India have undertaken [the responsibility of compensation for war injuries, the industries in India make their contribution through increased taxation. I fully agree that acquiescence in the Company's proposal to repudiate all liability for their employees should be avoided. I also agree that a reply to Mr. Ballantyne and a communication to the Government of India on the lines suggested in the last two paragraphs of your note would be the pe^t course to take in the circumstances. /o, I VlcU~ TJvoi U &amp; (ftwd j huJ* £ dtotv/* fat 1ft Q-^fiiUL ll\ CirUZ^t*-C SWc/uJUl ewi/uhcA (o la^MtiuL fh ^ | 'toSx&amp;t? . 1FILE COPY AHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED fit IL 60 l&gt;^ -m-^ EXT ■ I'LQBOJ&amp;OfiGti uLasxx: I®filBi5KLEi&amp;aDaC CLIFFORDS UNN, FLEET STREET, L0M)0N, E.C.4.

It is proposed to send Mr* Ballantyne a cow of this letter as part of our reply to his letter of March 17th. ^ has, however, not yet 'been decided ■'.That reolv can D6 made to the Oompany with regard to (h). (it was made”clear to kr. Ballantyne in April that it might he some time before he received a reply). Our telegram No. 8097 of May 9 th last told o le Government of India that the whole question was being discussed here in connection with Burma, the Colonial Empire, etc., the general line hitherto taken by the Treasury being that 44 qolvLu not aooittea^LTntil after the war; and the Government of India were asxced lor tneir views.

G. and tne Government of India. (See paragraph 4 of tlieir ^e_egram Bo. 3894 of May 17 th). In the meantime, however - the treasury had agreed to the publication of a statement (flagged) co the effect that it is idle intention of H.M.G. to help in^the replacment or repair of property and goods destroyed or damaged in the Colonial Empire as a result of the war. It was considered here that an attempt. should be made to obtain the consent of the .treasury to the application of this formula to Bahrein and Koweit. t t d0ne in T * P88l ’ s letter to Syers No. Ext.2881 of July -bth.

It 7 /as argued that for this reason the question of compensation of the kind under discussion T/as one for consideration w by H.M.G. rather than the Government of India. The Treasury reply below refuses to agree to the Sheikhdoms being covered by the formula (which, it will be noted, has novr been extended to Burma and Newfoundland}. The Financial Secretary’s notes on the back of that 'letter take the view that we should not accept this as the last word, but sliould reserve the right to raise with H.M.G. the question of their at least sharing the cost. A draft letter in this sense is submitted. 1L 0 As regards the reply to be made to the Bahrein Petroleum Oompany, paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s telegram of May 17th concenr)lated tnat tne question would be discussed after the war on the assumption that both II. .G. and the Government of India irn ght have to oear some responsibility. In view of the Treasury reply, which, in effect, refuses to contemplate accepting any liability for compensation for war damage in the two Sheikhdoms, it now seems necessary to ask tne Government of India whether they agree that the Company (end if necessary the Sheikhs) should be informed simply that the question must be left for consideration after the war - the implication being that the Government of India nmiy well have to bear the whole responsibility. A draft express letter for this purpose is also submitted. f 3. *-• &lt;f V . , U w, t L- , tu ^ lj- t ^ y. bityA b LA U4 L * ^ U t 'it. &gt;)* j^_ ^ *• ( u. Elx.

The military authorities on the spot who might issue orders for the destruction of the property would be the agents of a military command responsible to H.Li.G, and any such action would bo taken in pursuance of the common war effort. Moreover, the operations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, whose properties constitute perhaps the biggest factor in the problem, contribute in an important degree to the common war purposes , and not to any particul iL’ndian purpose, and Bahrein and Koweit are, of course, no more parts of India _ than &lt;pf the Colonial Empire.

Compensation for War injuries.Confidential Political Agency, S,g.y c APQ2» Bahrain, the 8th July 1942• To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain* Dear Sir, My comments on the points raised in your letter Ko.Con-821 dated 26th Lay 1941 are aa followsi- !•(!)• You assert that the Company cannot assume liability for any British, Indian, Iraqi, Bahraini or other local employees who are injured or killed (a) by enemy action, or (b) by action arising during or from the defence of property against enemy action, or (c) by other acts of war, or (d) by the destruction of property py the Bahrain Government or His Majesty's Government. In regard to this assertion I would point out that the Company, in respect of employees engaged under the Foreign Service Agreement, has accepted certain liabilities under Clause 7 of that Agreement. It seems therefore, so far as I am able to Judge the position at present, that if a Foreign Service employee suffered death or injury as a result of such action as Is specified in (a) (b) (c) and (d) above, the Company would, if the death or injury could be shewn to have arisen out of and to have been sus tained in the course of the man* a employment, be liable to pay compensation. In respect of employees not engaged by the Company under the Foreign Service Agreement, the Company is, in the cir cumstances mentioned above, under no contractual obligation to pay / compensation. Whether the Company is under any legal obligation j- to pay compensation in such circumstances is a matter for the i’ I decision of a Court of competent Jurisdiction which would decider~ * r tFx'Y - 2 - ° n the merits any case brought before it. It may be noted, however| th&amp;t no case would lie against the Company under the Indian Workmen*s Compensation Act as that Act has not been legally applied to Bahraini and, generally speaking, a claim against the Company could only succeed if negligence were proved against it. (ii) You enquire whether the Bahrain Government or His Majesty's Government will assume responsibility for meeting claims arising out of such action as is specified in (a) (b) (c) and (d) above. The present position is that neither His Majestyb Government nor the Bahrain Government has accepted any liability in respect of such claims. II. The Company's denial of liability or responsibility in res pect of death or injury sustained by employees belonging to the Local Defence Force while training, while protecting the Shaikh's property or when called upon for defensive action by His Majesty's Government is noted. III. The Company refuse liability for damage to personal or house hold effects of employees living in Company quarters when such damage is the result of enemy action? they also refuse liability for such damage if it arises from any cause other than negligence on their part during regular routine operations. These refusals of liability are noted. IV. (i) The Company refuse liability for death or injury to members of employees 1 families arising out of (a) enemy action, or (b) action arising during or from the defence of property of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. This refusal of liability is noted. \ (ii) The Company enquire who will assume responsibility for meeting claims arising from these circumstances, and whether His Majesty's Government or the Bahrain Government will entertain them. / The-3- The answer is that neither His Majesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government accept responsibility for meeting such claims* X am | Yours truly.

Dear Sir, VaC Reference your Confidential Letter No.C/1003 dated July 8, 1942. ^ As mentioned in ray letter Con-62 dated June 1, 1942, the subject matter of your letter C/727 of 27th May 1942 was submitted with detailed information to the Com pany*s Principals for consideration. This communication was despatched under date of June 2nd but due to the slow and delayed movement of mails, as apparent from advice we have regarding the receipt of airmail correspondence in the United States from Bahrain, we would not expect the infor mation to have yet arrived there. I do not anticipate a reply from them until they have had an opportunity of re viewing the matter thoroughly which, in view of circumstances, may be several weeks yet. The contents of your Confidential Letter C/1002 have been noted and the pertinent information therein has been cabled to the Company’s Principals.

I understand the Indian Workmen T s Compensation Act has never been legally applied to Bahrain but that the Company have voluntarily agreed to abide by its provisions in respect of their Indian and Bahraini employees. Do you confirm this ? I am referring in this paragraph to ordinary circumstances and not particularly to war-time conditions. Yours sincerely, Sd.W.R.HAY E.B.Wakefield, Esq., I.C.S.

But, as a matter of practice and without prejudice to their legal position, the Company have in the past treated deaths of, or accidents to, Bahraini or locally engaged Indians in the same way ss if the death or injury had occurred to a Foreign Service employee. Reports have been made to the Political Agent, meetings have been convened, and compensation has been granted or refused* Payments of compeneation made by the Corapahy in such cases are, however, regarded by the Company as being ex gratia and not a legal or contractual obligation. 6* I think this exposition la sufficient to answer para 3 of your letter under reply. The issues raised in para 2 of your letter are no less complex. ?• Llpp told us ex our meeting in March that, as things stood at that time, the Company could only pay whatever might be found to be due under the Indian tfork^nen's Compensation Act. He•3- was speaking loosely at the time, from his recollection of what had happened at the various 'Compensation Meetings' which he had attended. In any case, I do not think he meant that persons injured as a result of enemy action would automatically be com pensated on the scale laid down in the Act; whot he meant, I think, was that the Act were applicable to a particular case of injury, whether by enemy action or otherwise, the Company would be liable to pay compensation. Anyhow, whatever Lipp^ meaning was, it was obviously necessary to have the position further clarified, so, after receiving your letter of my 16th, I wrote to Ward Anderson. A copy of my letter No.C/727 dated 27th May 1942 is enclosed. I followed up my letter with a verbal suggestion to Ward Anderson that we should meet to dis cuss the situation - a suggestion with which he readily con curred. 8. At our meeting v/ard Anderson stressed that neither he nor Lipp had authority to comr.it the Company to any new obliga tions. In regard to Foreign Service employees he agreed that the Company was bound by clause 7 of tne contract; but he was not prepared to admit, without advice from New York where legal opinion was obtainable, that a Foreign Service employee would be entitled to compensation if injured ae a result of enemy action while engaged on the Company* c work. In regard to i Bahrainia and locally engaged Indians he said that the Comoany had definitely no legal or contractual obligations in regard ! to payment of compensation, and ho was doubtful whether the 1 Company would be willing to assume such obligations. He added that, in practice, and provided casco of death or injury were not very nucorous, the Company would no doubt make ex gratia payments in compensation: But the assumption of an obligation to make such payments was a very different matter. 9. Our discussion, though not conclusive in any way, / waswas ussful in that it enabled me to ascertain exactly what the on,;'eny’ a present liabilities were* And Ward Anderson promised to r«fer the w^iole natter to his Company. Ha also took note of my auggeation that insurance might wall be taken out by the parent Oil Company to cover the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and aaeociated Companies all over the world. By spreading the risk so widely it should be possible to take out an insurance policy on payment of a reasonable premium. 10. kaanwhila y Ward Anderson asked that a further attempt should be made by ns to answer the questions contained in the Company 1 a letter Ko.Con 351 dated g^th May 1941 (copy forwarded with Agency feemo No.C/532 dated 3Cth May 1941); and he has written to me to that effect (vide copy enclosed of Bahrain Petroleum Com pany lette r Ko.Co n-62 dated 1st Juno 1942). 11. I do not see why we should not now reply to the questions asked in the Company’s letter of 26th May 1941. tfe are pressing the Company to assume certain liabilities vis a vis their employees; and it is not unrui sonable that they should be informed by us whether we accept their views on certain points cuncerninrj the existing position.

This appears to have been a correct statenant of the position since it is in conformity with Clauss 7 of the Company• s standard Foreign Service Agreamant, which Is in turn based on §3(1) of the Indian Workman's Compensation Act* 3* Under Clause 7 of the Foreign Service Agreement the Company undertakes to pay compensation in all cases of injury ' arising out of and sustained in the course of employment '* and the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act Is to bs taken as a guide in assessing the amount of such compensation* 4* The point on which confirmation is now sought relates t o the Company* a attitude towards claims made for compensation for injuries sustained, as a result of war action, by Indian or Bahreini employees on the Company’s premises or otherwise engaged on the Company’s business* / ToTo take a concrete instanco. in Indian o^ployae is working ftt the Tiefinery* An Air aold occurs.

And I presume that when Lipp statod that at present the Company could only pay whatever might oe found to be due under the Indian Workman* s Compensation Act, he meant that the capsny xtould not be liable to pay compensation for injuries sustained by amplcyees who were, at the time when th^y were injured, neither on the Company's business nor •ng^ged in the performance of their duties with the Company. 6. Will you pleaae let me know whftther thia presumption is correct, and whether the Comptny confirm that their exist ing liability to pay compensation for injuries to Indian and Bahraini employees is not affected by the fact that such injuries may in future be caused by war action. Yours truly, 3d. 15. B. Wakefield, rolltlcal Agent, Bahrain.Draft of Lattar to Chlaf Local iiaprasantatlva, Bahrain Patrolaum Co. f Lt Dear oir, it/ coamenta cn the points raised in your latter No •Con- 8£1 d ated £'• ;th May 1941 are as follows*- I.(i) You assart that the Company cannot assuraa liability for any British, Indian, Irnqi, Bahraini or othar local amployees who arc injured or killed (a) by enemy action, or (b^ by action arising during or from the defence of property against enemy action, or (c) by other acts of war, or (d) by the destruction of property by the Bahrain Government or His i^jesty*s Government, in regard to this assertion Z. would point out that the Company, in respect of employees engaged under the Foreign 3ervice Agreement, cannot divest itself of the responsibility already accepted by it under clause 7 of that Agreement. If a Foreign Bervice employee suffered death or injury as a result of such action as is specified in K&amp;) (b) (o.) and (d) above, the Company would, if the death or injury could be shewn to have arisen out of and to have been sustained in the course of the mnn* s employ ment, be liable to pay compensation. In resnect of em ployees not engaged by the Company under the Foreign Ser vice Agreement, the Company is, in the circumstances men tioned above, under no contractual obligation to pay com pensation. Whether the Company is under any legal obli gation to pay compensation in such circumstances is a / matterfor the decision of e Court of coarpetent jurisdiction which would decide on the merits any case brought before It. It may be noted, however, that no case would lie against the Company under the Indian Workmen 1 s Cempansa- tion Act as that Act has not been legally spoiled to Bahraini and, generally speaking, a claim against the Company could only succeed if negligence were proved against it. (ii) You enquire whether the Bahrein Government or Hl.i ^jesty* s Government will assume responsibility for meeting claims arising out of such action as la specified in (a) (b) (c) end (d) above. The present position is that neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Bahrain Government has accepted any liability In respect of such claims. It is presumed, however, that in the event of action taking place under (d) above. Tils Sfayeaty^ Gov ernment or the Bahrain Gcvernr*ent, as the case may be, would entertain claims for compensation. II. The Company^ denial of liability or responsibility in reapect of death or Injury sustained by employees belonging to the Bocal Defence Force while training, while protecting the Shaikh 9 s property or when called upon for defensive action by His Majesty*8 Govarnnent is accepted. Ill* The Company refuse liability for damage to personal or household effects of employees living in Company quarters when ouch damage 1* the result of eneny action; thsy also refuse liability for such damage if it arises from any cause other than negligence on their part during regular routine operations. Subject always to the decision by a Court of competent Jurisdiction of individual case® heard on their merits, the refusals of liability are accepted.&amp; r/,(i) The Comoany refuse liability for death or injury to is ember* of employQee , families arieing out of (a) action, or (b) action arising during or fr^ the defence of property of the hanrain Petroleum ro«pany. This refusal of liability la accepted* r ii) The Company inquire who will aaauxne responsibility foi'* njeoting olalrua arising from these circumsUancoa, and whether Kla -fajeety ? 3 Government or the Bahrain Government will entertain them. Tie answer ia that neither His Majesty’s 'Govern ment nor the Bahrain Government accept responsibility for meeting such claims. The I 033 must inevitably fall upon the employee concerned.

The Government of Inci, have def initely recognised in an Ordinance (vice Section 4 of the War Injuries Ordinance 1941) that employers are not liable unaer the Workman^ Compensation Act for injuries e used to their employees by war action and though neither the let nor the Ordinance apply to Bahrain the principle mi.;ht be appealed to -nd y, u yourself might bj£ the Court called upon to aecioe the question.

Dear Syers, 2# JliL W The Bahrein Petroleum Company have raised with us the question of compensation for possible loss or damage to their property at Bahrein by eneny action or by the action of our own military forces (including, of course, scorched earth destruction ordered by the latter). This has led E. A. Beiwmvjau., r'etiroleum Dept. us th£s£question$in relation to the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf generally. It seems to us, however, that for the time being we need take into account Bahrein and Koweit only; that is to say, we do not think we need at present consider either the small sheikhdoms on the Trucial coast or the Sultanate of Muscat, which has a different status from tfaoctr the others.

Their rulers have repeatedly expressed their loyalty to the British connection and to our cause; and they have placed considerable facilities at the disposal of our Forces, especially the Navy and the R.A.F. 3* The political control which, by virtue of her treaty rights, H.M.G. exercises over these sheikhdoms, shsJiaa tn snmft—extent dologatcd to the Government of India. Militarily, however, they lie within the sphere, not of the G.-in-G. India, but of the C.-in-C. Middle East, and it is therefore-he who is responsible A for their defence. We think that this is a factor of cardinal importance in the present connection; since the military authorities on the spot who might ^ damage^on property or issue orders for scorching would be the agents of a military command which is tto-wa^-responsiblo to the Guvcrnuont of India, Jjencey fS. it seems to us that the question of compensation dt&gt;u. £ t'As-J CAT to for such damage, and goorohing is- nnp fnr (l r * ''Sc^J^L l^TU-c. ii &lt;jw- /U consideration by H.M.G. rather than the Government of India. 5. The most valuable privately owned property in these sheikhdoms undoubtedly consists of the installations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company (no oil has yet been won in Koweit, and the Oil Company there is about to plug its wells and suspend its operations for the duration).

In all the circumstances we should be glad ih hHfulel if the Treasury would consider whether/ these /o * sheikhdoms fl»n^be officially regarded as covered by the statement of intention set out in proposal 3 at the end of your letter to Greasy of April 7th last, 7/e envisage that the Governments of Bahrein W and Koweit akould be informed that the aim of H, M.

M,G, and of any 'common fund or organisation' for the replacement or repair of property and goods destroyed or damaged as a result of the war. 8 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Greasy and Johnston; also to Berthoud at the Petroleum Department,s TREASIJRy C VMB'ES, S.ff.l. 7th April, 1942, My dear Creasy, L V ,Var Damap'.e in the Colonial Qnpire. Before he left for iiiaerica, Caine held two inter- u jpartuental xaeetings at \7iiioh we discussed representations from the Ruober Trade Association and other bodies interested in Malayan produce against the ruling .of the Colonial Office and the Straits Settlements Government that the risk of seizure by the enemy was not covered by the Malayan Tar Bisks (Goods) Insurance Scheme (see his letter to me of. the 21st January covering one from the Companies to the Colonial Office of the 12th January). The view taken at these meetings was that the ruling was correct and defensible, but that the question of making some concession to the Companies on grounds of equity and/or expediency ought to be considered before a reply was returned to them. It was accordingly agreed that we in the Treasury should explore the matter' from these-poin ,s of view and report our conclusions to the o uher Departments concerned. This we were on the point qf doing when a neiV and wider question arose which it was obviously necessary to isider si. sly. .miis- emerged ^from correspondence between our two Departments, with reg xd. to the position of Fiji and Ceylon and may be briefly summarised as the. question wnether H,Ii.G. in the U.K. can pledge her .credit to t^e extent of standing behind apy scheme introduced by a Colonial territory for any class of war damage - in its widest sense. (A~ you will appreciate, there ,is statutory power under the Colonial *,ur Risks Insurance (Guarantees) Act of 1941 to guarantee Colonial commodities inaui'iince schemes; there is no such power to guarantee chattels and personal injuries schemes and, though we did not think it necessary to legislate in order to guarantee such schemes in Malta and Gibraltar, we should undoubtedly have to do so if there were an extension of the policy). Consideration of tl matter was clearly incumbent upon us; for not only were Fiji seeking authority to introduce a commodities scheme under G.H.Creasy, sq., G.B.Jk , Colonial Office, guarantee.guarantee from H.M.G. and a chattels scheme which would have in effect to be guaranteed, but Ceylon (who had already a guaranteed commodities scheme) had introduced a chattels scheme and were preparing a personal injuries scheme - neither of which presumably could they hope to finance to the full from their own resources in the ■ unhappy event of the Island being overrun. &gt;Ve therefore had to review the whole lield (commodities, chattels, personal injuries) and in so doing, to take into account not only sporadic ■' damage from air raids and sea bombardment but seizure scorched earth, etc., under wholesale invasioh. inevitably, this nas taken some little time* but the problem is a large and complicated one-and we feel sure that your Secretary of State will understand why it has not been possible for us to convey our views to him before. lov.ever, the matter -has now been submitted to Treasury Ministers and the proposal which I make below is made with the Chancellor^ authority. Taking -the narrowest issue first, i.e. tne representations of the rubber and- Tin Companies. v;e me quite clear that no claim can lie that the risk of seizure covered by the Malay an schemer indeed the fact that the old formula appeared ..in that scheme not tne new one strengthens our case instead of weakening it, as the Companies surest. ■•(•If you will comoare tne wording o± paragraph 3 (a' and 3(c) in the earlier version ox_the O.n. scheme - G.R.p.Kas No. 1731 and o.i.... 1.40 No. 273 - with the amended definition introduced .by S. .0. 1941 jro. 49-1,. you will not •- I nun.. - he in any douht of-this; Parliamentary Counsel wnom .we have consulted privately, support our contention Bor do we tuink that a case for an immediate concession ’ U.e., for piyment once in respeotof goods oroved 2 M v ?, be n(i either of equity or of expediency; I will not trouble you v/ith °ur reasons for this but I can explain them if l? U +h 1S 30 iar &gt; therefore, as any immediate payment to the Companies is concerned (as if the goods were covered by the Malayan scheme) we are clear that a firm refusal should be returned to the Companies. / 7/hen&lt;v | j|&lt; ; ■ . , *&gt; When we come to the wider question, our view may be stated as follows:- ' The policy of guaranteeing Colonial commoditiee insurance scheme*, embodied in the 1941 Act, was conceived at a time when our minds were directed only to damage from aii* raids and seh bombardment. It does not correspond with present realities, v/hen whole territories are overrun; invasion in fact makes nonsense of the root principles of insurance. • But not orxly that- the threat of invasion brings with it a host of oroblems ’ (e.g., scorched earth, seizure, widespread loss of life) which cannot be resolved, so far as compensation is concerned, by adherence to principles which were designed for a quite different set of contingencies. It would be one thing for to staiid behind schemes introduced by a Colony remote from the danger area but liable to sporadic damage; it would be another thing to stand behind a Colony which is in the firing line and may be overwhelmed. The possibilities of restoring, or compensating for, war damage in the Colonial 'mpire must in fact be related co tne wider problem of all war damage. At tills.time no one can foresee how that will be dealt with after the war or indeed what will then be the financial position of any one of the combatants. (If war damage within the British Qapire -is going to be treated on ;uite a different basis from v/ar damage in ISurope, should not the whole lap ire contribute ?) In view of the obvious uncertainties, it would be folly on our part to make promises £t this stage. n.t the same time, we in the Treasury repognise that the territories concerned are entitled-to' such assurances as can legitimately .'be-given; less than this would be neither equitable nor prudent at this time. e would .propose, therefore, for your Secretary of State’s consideration, that the policy should be .1, Coramoditieg Insurance Schemes To cease forthwith divine: guarantees of such scheraes under the 194,1 Act. Those territories which have already been given actual or constructive guarantees would continue to enjoy them. (We can work out the list later but I think it comes down to Kenya and Uganda, Palestine and Ceylon). Other /** territories should be discouraged from embarking on f the preparation of schemes or, if they insist, should be told that H.K.G. cannot guarantee them. (It would not be practicable to draw a distinction between territories in danger of invasion and territories liable only to damage from the air and possibly the sea; even if it were, there would have to be constant revision as the tide of war ebbed and flowed.) . 2. War Damage and Personal Injurie s Schemes To make clear to territories considering these that, while we cannot prevent them from making , their own schemes if they wish, H.M.G. cannot guarantee them and no liability against U.K. funds can be accepted. In the two cases where guarantees have in fact been given - Kalta and Gibraltar - these would continue. (They are in fact defensible per se since Malta and Gibraltar are fortresses, not economic units.) 3. General . To ma^e forthwith the following statement df intention and to give it wide publicity through the Colonial Empire •- 'It will be the general aim of H.K.G. after tne war that, v/ith a view to the well-being of the people and the resumption of productive . activity, property and goods destroyed or damaged in the Colonial Qnpire should be replaced or repaired to such extent and over/over such a period of time as resources permit, if the resources of any part I of the Colonial Dnpire are insufficient to enable.this purpose to be achieved without aid, E.K.G. would be ready to give what assistance they can in conjunction with such common fund or organisation that may be established for post-war reconstraction*” . \ \ It is our hope that this« proposal will commend^ itself to your Secretary of State as the most reasonable one in extremely difficult eii'cumstances* If it does, the way is clear for immediate action in relation not only to Fiji and Ceylon, but to the Rubber and Tin Companies and indeed for a general message to the Colonies. In view of Sidebothorn’s interest in this topic I am sending him a separate copy of this letter. I am also sending copies to Johnston at the Burma office Tours ever, (3gd.)

As regards personal injuries, I can only suggest (bearing in mind Mr. Peel’s note of April 24th, flagged), that we wait and see the result of (a) the consultation between the Government of India and the employers' organisations regarding the proposal that employers should supplement the relief payable to their employees under the -Tar Injuries Ordinance (see para. 3 of the Government of India’s telegram No. 3894 , in which we are promised further information about this), (b) the examination by the Government of India of the question of the relief of British subjects who sustain war injuries in the Indian States (and Bahrein) (same paragraph of same telegram). As regards damage to the Company's property by eneny action or scorched earth destruction, please see para. 4 of the Government of India's telegram No. 3894 . In spite of what/* 2 . what they say, this Department is inclined to think that we might approach the Treasury about the application to Bahrein (and possibly to other Gulf | States) of the formula given at 1 in the Burma Office note below. Do you agree? - * fSecretary, External Department, We have not yet received from the Treasury direct answers to the questions we put to them about various aspects of war damage claims, but from copies we have been sent of correspondence between the Treasury and the Colonial Office we learn: - That the Colonial Office has agreed to the issue of a formula put up by the Treasury designed to cover damage to buildings, business equipment and chattels. The exact wording of the formula is to be followed, and is as follows: 'It will be the general aim of HJ4.G, after the war that, with a view to the well-being of the people and resumption of productive activity, property and goods destroyed or damaged in the Colonial Bnpire should be replaced or repaired to such extent and over such a period of time as resources permit. If the resources of any part of the Colonial Unpire are insufficient to enable this purpose to be achieved without aid, would be ready to give what assistance they can, in conjunction with such common fund or organisation that may be established for post-war reconstruct!on The Treasury have not extended this undertaking to Burma. 2. That the Colonial Office agree with the Treasury that the risk of seizure was not covered by the kalayan War Risk Commodities Insurance Scheme ary more than such seizure in this country will be covered by the United kingdom scheme; and the rubber and tin companies which claim that seizure was so covered are to be informed that no payment to claimants by way of compensation for proved losses could be justified on the ground either of equity or expediency, 3^ That the Treasury is reluctant to guarantee anymore Colonial Commodities Insurance Schemes and will not do so for schemes introduced after a period of say three months, 4^ That the Treasury want more information before agreeing to stand behind Colonial Personal Injuries Schemes and 5^ That the Treasury have agreed that,with their approval. Colonies may introduce schemes for payment in special circumstances to relieve hardship in the case of a person who loses all his goods and chattels, and the means of his livelihood and that if necessary. H,M*Gr, will stand benind such schemes. Having come to these decisions the Treasury are in better position to tackle further problems of the same kind, and might now be approached on the question of Bahrein. 1*5. b.

January The Question of compensation for war injuries’^TTS'taine'd “by- ; the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company arose largely in connection with the Bahrain Defence Volunteers. This Force has-been disbanded and is not, I thinK, liKely to be revived. (A separate reoort is being submitted on this subject.; The failure of the Force was partly due to the fact that the Bahrain Petroleum Company Management announced that they accepted no responsibility for injuries sustained by their employees as members of this'Force unless incurred while actually pro tec tin the Company t s property. 3. I have now ascertained that European and Americ (but not members of their family) kill'd or totally o disabled while on the Company's premises as a result will be paid double indemnity by the Company. By n do is meant twice the benefits which would ordinarily be ance .with the provisions j&amp;I of the California State C Act in respect of an employee killed or totally or pc disabled while performing his duties. Indemnity unde approximately one year r s aalary in the event of' death an employees r permanently of war action u ble inde mn ity paid in accord- ompensation rmanently r this Act is 4. I have asked Mr. Lipp what compensation the Company would pay for Indian or Bahraini subjects killed or disabled as' the result of war action. He replied that as things stand at ore sent his Comoanv could only pay whatever might be found to be due'under the Indian ' ../orkman f s compensation Act. He was willing^ however, to recominend to his Principals the acceptance of further liabilities if similar concerns in the i.iiddle East and India, such as the Anglo—Persian Oil Compary and the Attock Oil Company, etc., had accented such liabilitie s. 5. I presume that^employers in India are not liable to pay compensation to their employees ;‘or injuries received in the course, of their employment as the result of enemy action, but should be grateful for a ruling on this point. So far as the ^nglo-Persian Oil Company are concerned it ap ears from paragraph 2 of Tehran telegram ho. 44 of 26th February 1942 that they have as y&lt;ft made ' no special arrangements for their Indian employees and no information is available regarding their proposal so far as their Persian employees are concerned. I am asking His Majesty's Vice Consul, i\horramsnahr, to let me mow the exact position, would the ‘Tovernment India kindly state what policy the Attock Oil Comoanv and similar concerns are pursuing? 6 . In the preceding paragraphs I have considered only the question ox ^ the payment of dompensation to the euployees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company for war injuries received while they are serving ,n the Company's premises.

(c) From that fund there would be paid to those employees who were injured while actualist work in the factory (or when within a specified distance of the factories if they had worked in the factory 8 n any of the two days preceding the date of injuiy) flat rate sums to each class sufficient to bring the Government' relief approximately up to what they would have received under Workman r s Compensation Act. (d) Contributions should continue to be payable monthly even after the War until the sum in the fund was found to be sufficient at the close of the war to meet the obligations on the f und &amp; -7 r % Contributions if required after the war should be pa^ble by all factories, even those started after the war, in order to avoid placing any factory at a comparative disadvantage. Note. - As immediately on the close of the war the fund would become practically a closed fund, this should not be very difficult to arrange. (e) The Government of India should guarantee advances to the fund to enable it to make the necessary payments, but should be entitled to refunds of such advances. (f) If after the war there is a balance in the fund it wall not be appropriated by Government to general revenues but will be utilised for the benefit of workers as a whole.BY SPECIAL /IB MAIL Si CONFIDENTIAL.

Pi» aricjfe^l Departiaent. question of (a) War Risk Insurance and (Id) compensation for ’’Scorched Earth” at Bahrein. In May of last year the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company sent tv/o letters to the Political Agent, Bahrein, containing a number of enquiries as to the position of the Company and its employees in relation to (a) various forms of war risk A insurance^c f| and (h) compensation for damage to 1 *or demolition of their property hy military authorities or the Bahrein Government. The Political Agent referred these letters to the political Resident, who in turn referred them Ito the Government of I n dia, observing that the ^Bahrein Government were certainly not in a position to finance any system of war risk insuranceT The Government of India did not reply until January 24th of this year, when they simply described the various measures of war compensation and insurance which had been enacted in I n dia, and suggested that the Political Resident should consider what recommendations should be made liar/*the . of Bahrein, including the question t of the provision of funds. There the matter A rests so far as we know. * ,v/Kc^ t *i*r. 5380 It '1-2 No doubt the Company are disturbed at the long delay in receiving a reply. Their London Representative, in agreement'with their Head Office in New York, has now sent us a ’’general question” covering the same ground as /their2 their Local Representative’s letter of Lay last. As regards comr^ensation for personal injuries and the various forms of war risk insurance I think we may legitimately expect ^ between them to provide the answers to the Company Questions. Paragraph 5 of the Government °f In^a • „ letter to the Political Resident of January &lt;-4th seems to imply that they can settle these matters without our help. 1 —^^--4 e question of compensation for ’’scorcried KlcfK 'uA^ct earth' ^st ructlon. they wil l, presumably need guidance. ^ oTtnis sort shou Id) ...» On the from here, /“'claims for compensation of tms sort s presumably be made only to tne autnority whose representative has ordered the destruction m question In the case of Bahrein this authority will certainly not be the United States Government. * It is unlikely to be the Bahrein Government, and I do not think that much attention need be paid to the Chief Local^ Representative’s question regarding 'the possioility that the Bahrein Government might insist upon sacrificing our property in order to protect their interests'. The Company might be on better ground^ in claiming from the Government of India, since it is conceivable that the destruction might be effected on the order of the political authorities; and for this reason we should be glad to have a brief account of the attitude of the Government of India towards compensation of this kind. But the defence of Bahrein is the responsibility, not of the C.-in-C., India, but of the C.-in-C., Middle East; therefore if, as is most likely, the destruction were ordered by the military commander on the spot, it would be ordered, in efiect, by an agent of H.M.G. In the light of the above, there seem to be two possible replies to.the Company nwon the 'scorched earth' question:- (a) They could be told that the question of this form of compensation cannot be decided until after the v/ar. This would, of course, not commit anybody, and /is &lt;xT fk. dj (U. (iua*\a QMno-Cisvfc. is the reply which ttue Colonial have been authorised to make to similar enquiries. (See paragraph 4 of the Colonial Office telegram of x ~— oo4.-u x). Possibly something might be said to t he Company on the lines of the Teniainuer of that^especially the last sentence, since oil is the'Vasting asset” par excellence .. (b) We could delay the reply to the Company until we know the result of the discussions referred to in Burma Office ftote of April 14th. We could then take up with the Treasury the question of how far &lt;UUj principles governing this form of compensation for the Colonial Empire ; which may emerge from these discussions, can be applied to Bahrein. It is to be hoped that in the end we would be able to give the Company a rather more forthcoming reply than that suggested at (a). It is suggested that we should act as suggested at (b). I attach a tentative draft which is designed to draw the Government of I n dia on the question whether a claim by the Company would lie against them or against H.M.G; and to suggest that if it is the latter, nothing should be said to the Company until the matter has been taken up at t.his end. : . . • A || || Af. (V.i'his Department is concerned only with the „ar Risks (Goods) Insurance Scheme. Oil is a commodity whicn is insurable under that scheme. The scheme is at present limited to British India. The Govern ,r oi French India asked the Government of India to extend it to Pondicherry, but the Government of Inuia told us on 31st March that they'felt the;/ could not justily the inclusion of trench India in the scheme so long as the Indian States (who had ueen invited but had shown no uninamity in the matter) are not included. They added that they were in urgent discussion with the States on the subject and expected to be able to rep rt a satisfactory result shortly. Possibly, if the States agree to co-operate and this enables the scheme to be extended to French India, the Government of India might see their way to do something about nahrein hy arrangement with h.M. G. , though since the latter are responsible for the defence of the Island the question would s&lt; em to he more iM&amp;H their concern than India's. lI 6wsuv kf- The defence of Bahrein is now the responsibility of the C-in-C. Middle East and if final denial becomes necessary it will be on his decision that orders will be issued whatever channel they may be conveyed through. It is the C-in-C. Middle East who is settling the details of preliminary measures to be taken and who has asked for H.M.G-s. authority to begin work. It appears therefore that H.M.G. and not the Government of India should accept all responsibility for any compensation vhion may ultimately be considered. Prima facie there seems much to be said for Brigadier McCay's view. But I doubt if the Treasury would accept it, as the Government of India have always had a sha&lt;|dowy responsibility for Bahrain. There is ( of course^ this point: that were it to be arranged/It Is ho A. live Ua!( di^£ctz ■ x f i. 2 fl • (w arranged that any claim should lie initially against it would always he open to the Treasury to get the Government of India to hear a share of any compensation that might he given.

It would he useful to know if the Government of India are willing for the Bahrain Petroleum Company to go into the Indian orhit as regards the War Risk Insurance Schemes, and, if so whether it would he possible to cover the Company hy the new factory buildings and plant scheme as well as the Goods Insurance and Personal Injuries ’'OVV-VV ^ 2 . v. 1942.COPY GOVdBftkiNT OF INDIA. .

GIPD—L130 DofL—5-1.42—2,260.* I lear that the Burma Office cannot assist to any great extent in your problem. A War Bisks Commodity Insurance Scheme was started in Burma almost simultaneously with the war with Japan. As the name implies, this did not cover buildings, chattels or personal injuries, and indeed the more important commodities, including oil ; produced in Burma^ were excluded from the scheme as the resources ofBurma were held oo oe insufiicient to meet the possible risks. We have not yet been able to tell the oil or other companies operating in Burma how they stand as regards losses^ due to enemy attack, our attempts to repel such attacks, to seizure or to scorching. We are in hopes that the Treasury will agree to say that it will be their aim as regards Burma as well as the Colonies that property and goods destroyed or damaged should be replaced or repaired to such extent and over such a period of time as resources permit, and that if local resources should prove insufficient for this* purpose, H.M.G. will be prepared to give what assistance they can in conjunction with such common fund or organisation as may be established lor post—v/ar reconstruction. The Treasury have, hov/ever, not yet committed themselves. I cannot say whether they would be willing to extend such a declaration to cover Bahrein. They almost certainly would not extend it to cover India and they might say that it was for India to look after Bahrein. I suggest therelore, that, subject to any views the Financial Department may have, you should take the matter up with the.Treasury. There is a possibility, though I think it unlikely, that they may have committed themselves to some extent to the oil companies in Iraq, but even if they should have done so, they may be disinclined to give similar treatment to an American company. The Treasury's present attitude is to retuse to give specilic rights to any company or individual. Insurance schemes they admit to be worth while so long as it is only a question of sporadic bombing or bombardment from th-e sea, but they hold, not unreasonably I think, that to attempt to cover by insurance losses due to territories being overrun by the enemy/enemy makes nonsense of the root principles of insurance, and who can say what country may not be overrun. Their policy is therefore to refuse to underwrite new insurance schemes, though it is just possible -that they may relax in certain Colonies as regards commodities which we need and which might not be collected for us without an insurance guarantee. I think that the Bahrein Petroleum Company will have to (a) be content with the general undertaking referred to above if the Treasury will permit them to be covered by it; or (b) go into the Indian orbit if the Government of India will have them; or (c) see what they can get out of Bahrein or possibly the U.S.A.

The Bahrain State and His Majesty^ Government are taking all measures within their power at the present moment to protect the Island and the various interests therein. 4. As regards possible losses it would appear prima fac ie that damage by the enemy should be covered by insurance if the War Risk Insurance scheme can be extended to Bahrain. Damage by the Military authorities would presumably be paid for by His Majesty’s Government and likewise damage by the Bahrain State would be paid for by it. 5. In letter No.Con-821 the Company deny their liabilit to compensate their employees for injury or loss arising from causes due to the war and request a ruling as to whether His Majesty’s Government or the Bahrain State will entertain such claims.i (1) Claims on account of death or injury to employees as a result of the wars presumably these claims would he covered by War H^ks Insurance, while claims due to action by His Majesty^ Government or the Bahrain State would be entertained by the Government responsible. (a) Claims on account of death or injury to members of the Local Volunteer Defence Force, while on military duty, would presumably be entertained by His Majesty’s Govern ment or the Bahrain State as the case may be.

Political Agent, Bahrain.The Bahrain Petroleum I Comping , j Av/ali, CON-818 May 22nd, 1941. Hie Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, In our letter Con-812 we pointed out what is of course obvious to everyone, that present Bahrain defense measures against outside action are ^uite inadequate from the standpoint of the importance of the oil field and the refinery to His Majesty’s Government. In view of the responsibilities of the Bahrain Government and/or His Majesty’s Government in connection with the security of Bahrain Island, we would like to be informed what measures if any have been adopted or con templated to implement the protection required or to cover possible losses to private interests including our own sustained through:- 1. Damage inflicted by enemy action. 2. Damage to or demolition of our property by military authorities with the acquiescence of the Bahrain authorities. 3* i-'he possibility that the Bahrain Government might insist upon sacrificing our property in order to protect their interests. We are also interested in knowing of any measures similar to those in the United Kingdom by which Bahrain Government War Rsik Insurance can be taken out at reason able rates covering the value of our installations in Bahrain Islands.

V/e would like to know who will assume responsibility for claims by employees arising from such action. Will the Bahrain Government or H.M.G. entertain such claims ? (2) The Company admits no responsibility or liability for accidents or deaths involving employees belonging to the Local Defence Force while training, while protecting the Shaikh’s property or when called upon for defensive action by H.M.G. (3) The Bahrain Petroleum Company v/ill not be liable for damage to personal or household effects of any employee living in Company quarters when such damage is the result of enemy action, or for damage arising from any cu^se other than negligence on our part during regular routine operations.

One of. the .lessons of this war has been the great military importance of ''scorched earth' policy in territory invaded by the enemy. To be really effective this policy must be:- (a) Comprehensive. It must be applied to all resources of potential value to the enemy. \ . It should'cover all military installations, aerodromes, commercial and industrial plant, public utility installations such as wireless, cable and electricity stations, harbour works, railways and bridges as well • as a n S ea and river craft which cannot be . ‘ ■ removed. . Only exception is that minimum . .. v ... stocks of essential foodstuffs should be ' .. :r. left for ''local inhabitants but these should ae far as p eg ibis be distributed to population, before withdrawal takes place to avoid bulk supplies falling into enemy hands. (b) Ruthless- It should aim at total destruction for indefinite period and should not be compromised by any desire to recover resources essentially intact when the enemy withdraws. He will almost certainly himself destroy anything of value in his retreat. Destruction is much better than concealment. Where destruction by fire or explosives is not practicable, dumping in sea or rivers may suffice. (c) Carefully planned in advance. (d) Rigorously applied in practice. While premature demolitions are to be avoided, e.g. if enemy attack is in nature rf raid rather than attempt to occupy, experience shows that principal danger lies in leaving matters too late. Responsibility for deciding when denial schemes in respect of commercial installations should be implemented should not (repeat not) be left to companies, but their co-operation will be needed in preparation of schemes. (Military authorities should be responsible^for saying when denial should be carried out and for seeing that it is carried out^ 2. Military author ities will presumably haTe prepared their own denial plans in respect of military installations, etc. In case of civil installations civil Government should undertake responsibility in consultation with military authorities for preparing plans and for seeing* 2 ' that they fall into a comprehensive scheme which will include military plans as well. In Oolonial Dependencies where denial plans have already been prepared these should be reviewed with object of considering whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and.far-reaching. Where no plans exist at present Colonial Governments are requested to review the position with a view to drawing up list of resources which should be denied and preparing general scheme. I consider that this should be done even in those Dependencies which may at present feel themselves relatively remote from active theatres of war. It will not, however, in most cases be necessary to proceed to stage of final preparation, e e g 0 laying explosive charges, 3. You will appreciate importance of keeping strictly secret any discussion of plans since public morale might be affected if such measures were known to be under consideration* 4.

The Treasury were on the point of circularising the Departments concerned on this same subject on the question of compensation in such cases, and it occurs to me that it might be convenient to add a short passage to the draft telegram giving the substance of our proposals. What we should suggest would be an additional paragraph on the following lines:- ’’Compensation: Where damage is done in the course of military operations or on the orders of our own Forces, the answer to any inquiries must be that the question of compensation cannot be decided until after the conclusion of the war. Where we cannot ourselves effect destruction in the course of warlike operations but have to induce other people to destroy, we shall no doubt where necessary have to promise replacement after the war of destroyed property, if the owners regain possession after the war and it is a reasonable commercial proposition for them to resume operations and if compensation is not obtainable any other source. Account would have to be taken of any benefit to the owners due to preservation of a wasting asset, which, but for destruction, would be likely to have been exhausted or diminished by the enemy.” X X X X X George Street, S.W.l. 21st January, 1942.

IMMEDIATE (Fiji only) Circular unnumbe red SECRET . 1. One of the lessons of this war has been the great military importance of ’’scorched earth’ 1 policy in territory inraded by the enemy. His Majesty’s Government have had under consideration application of this policy to Colonial territories. To be most effective it must be: - (a) Selective . It must be applied thoroughly at all ( key points, from which the enemy can derive benefits that he most needs and has greatest difficulty in replacing. Examples are:- (i) Naval, Army and Air Force installations and aerodromes. (ii) Wireless, cable and telegraph stations. (iii) Oil stocks, installations and pumping equipment, as well as wells and refineries. (iv) Stocks of coal, raw materials, gunny bags, drums, clothing materials. (v) Harbour facilities, especially bunkering, loading and ship repairing facilities and sources of power to work them. (vi) Transport facilities, especially road and rail bridges, locomotives, locomotive repair shops, and all sea and river vessels which cannot be removed. (vii) Mine workings and machinery for getting transporting and refining ores required by the enemy, especially wolfsam, lead', zinc, nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, bauxite, chrome, silver, gold, iron ore engineering stores in connection therewith.Water supplies and minimum stocks of essential foodstuffs should he left for local inhabitants but latter should as far as possible be distributed to porulation before withdrawal takes place to avoid bulk supplies falling into enemy hands. (b) Ruthless . It should aim at total destruction for indefinite period and should not be compromised by any desire to recover resources essentially intact when the enemy withdraws. He Vill almost certainly himself destroy anything of value in his retreat. Destruction is much better than concealment c Where destruction by fire or explosives is not practicable, dumping in sea or rivers may suffice. Important that corresponding parts of similar machinery should be destroyed, to avoid enemy piecing together any one installation. {&lt;) Carefully planned in advance . Military authorities will presumably have prepared their own denial plans in respect of military installations, etc. In case of civil installations civil Government should undertake responsibility in consultation with military authorities for preparing plans and for seeing that they fall'into a comprehensive scheme which will include military plans as well. Military authorities are responsible in all coses for saying when denials are to be carried out. Plans must include clear understanding between military and civil authorities as to their respective responsibilities for actually carrying out necessary work when military authorities have decided that time has come for that to be done, and plans should provide specifically for advance organisation and training of reliable personnel to carry out each item of the denial programme. (b-) Rigorously applied in practice . While premature demolitions are to be adoided, e.g. if enemy attack is in nature of raid rather than attempt to occupy, experience shpws that principal danger lies in leaving matters too late. The essence therefore of an effective scheme is that it should be quick. Responsibility for deciding when denial schemes in respect of commercial installations should be implemented should not (repeat not) be left to companies or other private interests, but their co-operation will be needed in preparation of schemes. Policy should be to evacuate all moveable materials in. short supply and to destroy That cannot be removed. To this end priority lists should be maintained for removal of all stocks, of rare motals, machine tools, etc. and should include skilled operatives. Evacuation should be instituted early in so far as shipping resources (where this is practicable) permit. ^ In Colonial Dependencies where denial plans have already.been prepared these should be reviewed with object of considering whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and far-reaching. Where no plans exist at present Colonial governments are requested to review the position with a view to drawing up list of resources which should be denied and preparing general scheme, I consider that this should bedone even in those Dependencies which a* * I t t e : i S i e i V not re , latiV0ly remote f^maotiv^thea^es^f It will not however, in most cases be necassarv to proceed to stage of final preparation, e?g l^irJ explosive charges. &gt; xeying 4.
