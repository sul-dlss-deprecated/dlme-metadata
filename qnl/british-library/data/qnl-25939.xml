By November 15th owing to short despatches from Calcutta the supplies accumulated at Zahidan for transport to Zahidan had all been cleared and the Area Manager was faced with having the larger part of 665 vehicles idle on his hands. Accordingly, in consuUaitian with His Majesty*s Consul-General, he placed trucks up to 100 tons daily capacity at the disposal of the Edareh-i- Barbari Rah for the transport of coal, wheat and other Persian Government loads. Lorries sufficient to bring in 500 tons of coal for the Sugar Factory were sent at once to Chashmeh Gul 117 miles to the S.E. in anticipation of his Head Office*s sanotion. This action caused consternation in the 'black' transport circles (which include 100$ of the Edareh-i-Barbari Rah*s contracted trucks and most of their Lease-Lend vehicles) who saw the bottom falling out of their extremely lucrative market. However the situation was restored by an en clair telegram 2 or 3 days later from the Head Office of the U.K.C.C. disapproving of the Area Manager's action and forbidding further 'forward loading' and the transport racketeers breathed again. These orders have since been modified to the extent that the Area Manager has been instructed to carry 1000 tons of grain from Meshed to Shahrud for Tehran and backload a similar amount of kerosene for civil needs. The Finance Department have not got the grain to send so the trucks will have to go empty for the kerosene, with which the Anglo-1 rani an Oil Company are already overstocked in Meshed. This 'carry', plus 40 tons of petrol a day towards Zahidan for the building-up of stocks in the A.I.O.C. depots along the road, will probably keep the fleet occupied until supplies accumulate again in Zahidan. Meanwhile a first-class opportunity of (l) breaking the hhck-transport ring (2) helping the Industries Department to keep their sugar factory working ( 3 ) depriving the local Finance Department of their favourite excuse for not collecting wheat, is being lost.Ccv^Ucqo ?m] DEPiiRTiiLlNTiJj NO. 1 FROM TEHRtiN TO MBSHSD w»c.o* Sir R, Bullard.

To clarify the position regarding use of U.K.C.C. transport for civil goods in Lnorasan following is a summary of action taken in Tehran. 2. After consultation with Persian and Allied authorities responsible for providing transport for essential civil require ments we asked ^mindia to allow U.K.C.C. East Persia fleet to be used to lift 1,000 tons of oil for civil needs from Shahrud to Meshed. Subsequently U.K.C.G. Meshed in consultation with you arranged to lift various civil comodities mentioned in your telegra m Np*_287_ J . Amindia replied refusing the use of U.K.G.C. fleet: hence telegram from U.K.C.C. Tehran to India [grp. undec. J to cancel arrangements. 3. We then asked Foreign Office to overrule .taiindia’s decision. Foreign Office replied that they approved: Delhi however still require fulfilment of India*s condition regarding handing over of Fariman workshop to U.K.C.C. As however this equipment is most necessary to Persian Government Road Transport Department for maintenance of their fleet of 900/1,000 Lend Lease vehicles and will be transferred to Tehran soon. Persian Government cannot very well be expected to hand it over. 4. U.K.C.C. Cairo have however instructed U.K.C.C. Tehran to carry 1,000 cons of civil oil from Shahrud to Meshed and I under stand that this has begun and that cereals will be back loaded in these vehicles. 5. Neither U.K.C.C. Tehran nor Persian Government Road Transport Department have been opposed to using U.K.C.C. vehicles in East Persia on essential civil work. On the contrary, both have tried hard to obtain sanction to use surplus U.K.C.C. stock for this purpose. We are all trying to ensure that maximum use is made of available vehicles. Needs of Khorasan are fully appreciated and nothing will be done to deprive this orovince of its essential transport. #■ C Lm *• |-!

Dear Peel, You will have seen copies of Tehran telegram fe /70 No. 385, to the Government of India, the Government of India 1 s reply (No. ,541 ^to Tehran, _ren&lt;snted No. / o —the India_Cffige), and Tehran telegram No. 116^ 1q -the Foreign Office, about the'proposal to' divert lorries working on the East Persian route in order to carry oil from the railhead at Shahrud to East Persia and so build up a civil reserve there. Tehran telegram No. 585 to India gives the background fairly fully. But I should add that the oil famine in Tehran last winter probably did more harm and created more anti-British sentiment than any otiier single thing. In view of this, we have agreed that transport for civil oil should be given the highest possible priority in order to ensure against a similar breakdown this winter. The positio as regards West Persia has now been secured by the agreement of Persia and Iraq Command to -lend the necessary amount of transport. It is now essential to make corresponding arrangements for East Persia, where our interests and those of the Government of India are at least as strong as in West Persia. To remove lorries from the Zahidan-Meshed route will almost inevitably cause some diminution of the flow of supplies to the Soviet Union by that route. If this causes the Soviet Government to complain, we shall be prepared to explain to them, /as R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C., 'India Office.as in the case of our action in West Persia, that our action in diverting transport was necessary in order to maintain order in East Persia which is an essential condition of the continued functioning of.the East Persian route. As regards the other points in the Government of India’s telegram, we realise that they have a very legitimate grievance so far as the repair and maintenance of the Shahrud-Meshed road is concerned. Commander-in- Chief, India, has repeatedly pressed to be allowed to maintain this road himself, but as this is really a Russian responsibility we and the War Office have taken the line that the Russians should continue to be pressed to carry it out. So far the Russians have taken no effective action. But in view of the fact that they are now taking active steps to repair the Kasvin-Tabriz route, we and the War Office have agreed that one more attempt should be made to get them to maintain the Shahrud- Meshed road. Meanwhile, as Bullard says in his telegram No. 1166, the Persians are being pressed to improve this road and steps are also being taken to obtain the use of the workshop at Pariman. Whether these efforts are successful or not the fact remains that the building up of oil stocks at Meshed is a question of the greatest urgency, since the onset of winter may mean a complete interruption of the Shahrud-Meshed route. At the same time it seems clear that there is no alternative method of transporting the oil to that proposed by Tehran. We are fully conscious of the drawbacksof this proposal, but we feel that we must suoport Bullard s request with the Government of India^, and we hope that you will agree to telegraph urgently in this sense. As regards the organisation of Persian civil transport, steps are being taken to imorove the Persian Road Transport Department by increasing the nurnbur of European staff. But there is no prospect that any such improvement will take effect soon enough to enable the Persians to move to Meshed all the oil which is necessary in order to secure an adequate reserve.

Government of India telegram No.341 to me repeated to India Office. 2, His Majesty’s Government in conjunction with Command 0 in-Chief Paif_ . have established that highest priority be accorded to civil oil supplies in Persia, and reserve stocks be built up in outlying areas to at least two months’ supplies, 2[sic] Difficulties mentioned by ARM India are thorough) appreciated here but the need is so urgent that I have no alternative but to ask that decision in Government of India s telegram No,341 should be reconsidered. We have learnt bv experience that transport of grain and oil are interlocked to such a degree that a breakdown in supplies of either commodity must have a most damaging effect on the whole population. Again if sufficient oil stocks are not built up now in Meshed I cannot guarantee that there will not be disturbances this winter in Khorassan which would jeopardise the security of Aid to Russia route. 3, I will press the Persian Government to improve the state of Shahrud-Meshed road and do the best I can to obtain the use of^Fariman work-shop. A previous attempt however to buy this equipment for Khuzistan Agricultural Societv was abandoned because of difficulty in removing it from the Russian controlled zone. 4, At present the U.K.C.C. Aid to Russia transport is being diverted by Paif,„ to carry essential civil supplies of cereals and oil in West Persia. This has been possible as a result of experience to which I have referred in paragraph 2. I shall be grateful if a similar decision could be made accordingly by His Majesty’s Government in respect of civil oils for Khorassan on Shahrud-Meshed road* Transport allocated to this could backload cereals to rail head.

There is no difficulty in noving requisite quantities to railhead but it is essential that balance of requirements forward thereof should be in position before the end of November since from that time onwards weather conditions are liable seriously to interrupt road conmunications.
