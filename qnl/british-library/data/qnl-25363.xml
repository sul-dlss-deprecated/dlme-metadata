Onthe strength of this conversation I wrote the Shaikh a From the Political Agent tc Shaikh Isa, No, 326 w of 'SOth instant. letter, a copy of which is enclosed From Shaikh Isa to the Political Agent, dated 25th Eabi 1332. together with a copy of hi reply thereto rr o * It will he seen that the Shaikh in his reply T does not give the assurance required hut contents him self with saying that he will consult the Political Agent if he wishes to get the oil worked. On the other hand he tacitly admits the correctness of the description of the interview given in my letter and does not repu diate the verbal assurance. It is probable that after my departure the Shaikh consulted Ali bin Abdulla or one of his other ignorant and irresponsible advisers, who put suspicion into his mind that the object of my request was simply to take the right of making a con cession out of his hands. probably in a suspicious frame of mind, and in view of the fact that he promises to consult the Political Agent before undertaking anything, I do not think it would be advantageous to press the matter further at present; perhaps, if it is considered advisable, the question might be raised again later. 4 In these circumstances as the Shaikh is I have, etc., Sd.

I am to say that the assurance given in the 8haikh f s letter of the fist February 1914 to the Political Agent, Bahrein, cannot he regarded as adequate inasmuch as it only refers to his own interests and does not include an undertaking to consult the Political Agent before entertaining overtures. It is true that under Clause 3 of the Agreement of 1892, the Ruler of Bahrein is debarred from giving concessions to foreigners, but in view of Major Trevor’s early departure, the Govern ent of India consider it advisable in the present connection that he should endeavour to obtain something more satisfactory in writing from Shaikh Esa before he goes. It might be explained to the Shaikh verbally that if at any time the British Govern ient saw grounds for advising him to have the oil deposits worked, he might rest assured that his own interests would be fully safeguard:d by the pay lent of royalty or other means, but that it is also necessary for Government to know that their interests are safe, and that for this reason they would be glad if the Shaikh could see his way to modify or amplify his letter by writ in that he win not embark on any exploitation himselfhimself or entertain overtures in that connection from any quarter without first consulting the Government of India through their representative. It might also he pointed out to him that the Shaikh of Koweit readily gave such an assurance and even went further, I have tho honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. A. H.

Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, feir » February 24, 1914. Willi reference to my letter dated the 18th instant regarding the alleged application by Ronald Henry Silley and Mahomed Fakri for oil concessions in the Basra district and Nejed, I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty s Government, copies of reports on Koweit and Bahrein which have been received by this mail from the company’s geologist, Mr. Lister James, who accompanied the Admiralty Commission on their tour through the Gulf. As these reports are promising, especially that on the localities examined in Aoweit, and as it is believed the Government would be greatly averse to the acquisition of oil concessions in these regions by third parties, it seems important that this company should lose no time in applying for exclusive licences to prospect for oil both m Bahiein and Ivoweit, and my board would be glad to have the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the steps they should take with this object. It is understood that Bahrein is neither Turkish nor Persian, but under BritisK protection, also that Loweit is autonomous, and that the Sheikh has power to grant concessions within his own territory without reference to the Turkish Government. In these circumstances it is assumed that the company’s applications should be addressed to the Resident at Bushire, and if His Majesty’s Government are in favour of the concessions being granted to this company I am to suggest that the Government, of India and the Resident might be so informed. I have, &amp;c. C. GREENWAY, Managing Director. Enclosure in No. 1. Geological Notes on Certain Areas in the Persian Gulf. NOTES are given below on the localities visited in company with the Admiralty Commission. The remarks on Kishm and Lingah will be found almost identical with the notes submitted to the Commission. During this tour I have had the benefit not only of exceptional facilities for visiting the places enumerated but also of free discussion with the other members o£ the party of all evidence obtained. The following is a list of the localities visited :— Koweit. Bahrein Island. Kishm Island. Lingah. Hormuz Island. Bunder Abbas. Sarzeh District. Jashk. Koweit. (1.) Northern Locality. At a point north of Koweit (roughly latitude 29° 37' 30'; longitude 48° 2' 0 // )), about 6 miles from the edge of the bay, bitumen has been discovered at a depth of 6-9 feet. The substance is said to be liquid enough to flow quite easily 7 in summer. The well in which it was found has now fallen in. The deposit is said to be probably quite as large in extent as that at Burgfin. We were unable to reach the place, but Captain Shakespear, the British consul at Koweit, subsequently went there. He sent particulars, together with samples, to Admiral Slade, who kindly allowed me to take the above notes therefrom. [2034 56—6] I i KH if ft r !H Li * sk- iKoweit. (2.) Southern Area, Burgan. Introduction. —Burgan is situated about 30 'fk°'etarated' by the Arabian coast and 14 miles from the shore. From^lntter it separated by g6nt Udcent^ells wei’e^observed^rom timeTto time on our journey inland. .f “el itself is marked by a small range of low h,Us 100 feet above the plain. It was previously visited by Mr. U H. I'ascoe earlier m year o trato _ The beds exposed represent a thickness of about 100 feet, and consist 1 1 eiliceous o-nts with or without a pure white cementing material resembling S' Gylr bed occur interstratified with these, a thickness of about 8 feet bein™ observed in one exposure. Coloured clays (yellow and brown) are seen at the Mr. itscoe found a similar bed at the summit of Warah Hill, about 5 miles further n ° This is in all probability identically the same horizon. The strata in general are loosely compacted, but the arenaceous beds are protected from disintegration by a partial silicification which forms a hard outer crust or an irregular core ^ ^ ^ ^ uncemi The on l y evidence suggestive of correlatkm with the Ears series is the occurrence of gypsum beds but these are very differen in appearance from those observed m the Ears. They are far less consolidated, a id much more resemble those of the recent deposits seen near Koweit on the opposite s le of the bay The highest terraces in this neighbourhood should be examined with “yfew to possible correlation with Burgan. I StnlJture -No proof was forthcoming that these strata have been affected by any folding movement. Disregarding local dips, due probably to irregularity ol deposition horizontality appears to prevail over the whole exposure, and indeed, to extend over the intervening plain to Warah Hill, about 5 miles away. This is indicated by the existence there of the conglomeratic sandstone previously mentioned. Indications of Oil-l fairly large deposit of asphalted sand occurs at the surface in the midst of the area, while the substance has also been found m pits dug both m the immediate neighbourhood and at a distance of, perhaps, half a-miie. The asphalt is surrounded by desert sand, its original source being entirely ° Concluding Remarks .—With our present knowledge, the strata exposed throw no lioht on the occurrence of the asphalt or the prospects of oil production. S These strata must therefore be disregarded for the present. Attention may, however, be drawn to certain general considerations : 1 The occurrence of asphalt obviously indicates the presence of an oil-bearing series’ beneath whether it be the same series as that exposed or a lower uncon- formab e^one^ be derived from a lower unconformable series, the latter may either outcrop entirely in monoclinal structure or may come practically to t e surface as a partially denuded anticline. In either case the area shou testmg. ^ ^ wortl ^ of note tliat tliig area is far distant from any mountain chain which might form the axis of a folding movement affecting it. As it is the general rule for anticlinal folds to become gentler with distance from such, it seems highly probable that any flexures which ma\ a\e formed in this region are merely gentle undulations conforming m direction u Persian ranges. In fact, the structure is likely to be very favourable for 01 . , It may be remarked here that the outcrop of lars strata near Basra, a r on Dr. Pilgrim’s map, might afford further evidence as to the probable degre folding attained along this strike. armpars t0 It will be seen that on general theoretical grounds the area ceitaimy PP be promising, and it is on such grounds alone that any judgment can be formeu presented advisable befo j. e dr iU ing a deep test-well to determine the structure by sinking a few shallow wells suitably placed.3 Bahrein. This island is situated close to the Arabian Coast, about half-way down the Persian Gulf. Three or four days were occupied in the examination. Physical Features.—From all sides the ground inclines gently up towards the ^centre of the island, the rise terminating in a more or less precipitous drop. This cliff follows a line approximately parallel with the shore, thus forming a central oval basin with only one outlet to the sea—on the western side. From this depression a small central range of hills (Jabel Dukhan) rises abruptly to a height of about 420 feet, while smaller isolated hills are seen here and there. The presence of shells shows that the sea has occupied the central depression in comparatively recent times. The singular form of denudation is strongly suggestive of the tidal action of a retreating sea. Strata. —A total thickness of about 230 feet is exposed, according to independent estimates made by Mr. E. H Pascoe and myself. The strata are of eocene age, as proved by the presence of certain nummulites, first discovered by Dr. Pilgrim, and the identity of which was recognised by Mr. Pascoe. Well-bedded limestones are characteristic of the lowest portion of the exposed series. Pink marl and irregular limestone follow, with quartz geodes and flints ; while the remainder of the section is composed of brilliant white chalk, chalk marls, “biscuit shale,” and irregular nodular limestones. The limestones, which are usually white or cream-coloured within, are very thick in places, but they change rapidly to chalk marl, the transition stage being represented by a network of pitted limestone nodules in a matrix of soft chalk marl. The full thickness exposed in the island is represented in the central hills (Jabel Dukhan) and the vicinity. Here the limestones attain their greatest development, and, but for an almost continuous section, the correlation of this outlier with its representatives on the flanks would be attended with difficulty. Nummulites and ostrea (?) elegans are found amongst the uppermost strata. Structure. —The island represents a large, very gentle, elongated dome striking in a direction approximately north and south. The dip on the eastern flank is not more than 2 or 3 degrees, but on the western side the angle is apparently slightly steeper. The section given by Dr. Pilgrim exaggerates the structure considerably. Oil Indications. —The discovery of asphalt at Ain-el-Ghar was made by a Bedouin in an attempt to find water, the place being situated about 3 miles south south-east of Jabel Dukhan. An investigation was subsequently carried out by Mr. Gaskin, then assistant political agent. Five pits were dug, ranging in depth from 21 to 38 feet. Asphalt was found in three of these at depths of 24, 27, and 22 feet. The pits were sunk through a superficial sandy deposit, filling what was formerly a small ravine. A vesicular-bedded limestone crops out a short distance north of the asphalt deposit, w r hich latter in all probability represents a seepage from this horizon. This rock occupies a position low in the series. * Concluding Remarks. —The eocene is not known to be generally petroliferous in this part of the world, so that this may be only an erratic occurrence. Moreover, the strata are not of the type usually associated with an oil series. Nevertheless, in view of the definite occurrence of asphalt and of the ideal nature of the structure, it appears inadvisable to ignore the area before testing with a fairly deep well. Shallow wells also might yield good results from the outcropping oil rock if placed a considerable distance down the dip from its exposure.MOLD-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY LB f IT'ED, WINCHEHTKF HOUSE, OLD BFOAD 3TFEBTT, LONDOU, E*C. 18th February, 1914.

[August 30.] ^4 w &lt;£» s O : ' - Section 2. [40096] No - 1 - Memorandum by Mr. Weakley on Syrian Oilfields, dated August 30, 1913. FIVE prospecting licences (permis de recherches) for petroleum and one for iron ore, in the country lying between Damascus and the Dead Sea, as shown in the sketch-map enclosed,^ were granted on the 20th October (2nd November), 1910, to the following persons :— . ■ Mustapha Pasha Khallil, Selim Bey Reis, Iskender Kassab, Fuad Sa’ad, Jad Habib Hawa, Selim Hawa, Anis Abiad, Dr. G. Schuhmacher (German subject), all resident in Haiffa, and Abd-el-Kader Effendi Kabbani, of Beirout, Mohammed Habbal, of Beirout, and Mobed Said-el-Azm, of Damascus. - The issue of these licences was confirmed by the Ministry of Mines on the 2nd (15th) October, 1911. ■ n 11 „ . In April 1911 an agreement was made between the holders of these^ permis, jointly, and the Oil Trust (Limited), of 4, London Wall Buildings, London, in virtue of which The Oil Trust undertook to form a company for carrying out the necessary work of research and for obtaining the concession of the oilfields, should the prospecting operations prove that oil existed in sufficient quantity in the properties to justify their development. Owing, however, to various difficulties, and especially the conditions resulting from the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish war, the Oil Trust was unable to carry out its engagements, and the contract made between the London firm and the licence-holders was consequently cancelled. - : 1 . With a view, however, of complying as far as possible with the Mining Regulations,, ar certain amount of prospecting work appears to have been done by the holders of the permis themselves, and the life of the licences was, on application extended tor the term of another year—viz., up to the 3rd July, 1J13 (20th June,^ 132 J). &gt; A further...effort was then made to obtain the assistance of British capital, and a certain Suleiman Bey Nassif, a former official in the Intelligence Department of the Sudan Government, was deputed to interview British capitalists and endeavour to enlist their support. With this purpose in view Suleiman Bey proceeded to London, and, after negotiating without result with the Shell Company as well as the Ang o Persian Oil'Company, finally succeeded in coming to an agreement with a Mr. Edward Thomas Boxall, of 9, Bishopsgate Street, London, said to be director of the Premier Pipe Line Company. The agreement made is dated the 14th November, 1912, anc by its terms Mr. Boxall has undertaken to form a company which is to acquire ai e rights under the licences and to carry out all prospecting operations. It is iur er stipulated that the six licences are to be transferred m the pint names of Mr. Boxail and Suleiman Bey Nassif, but this transfer is made conditional upon the company being first formed and registered and upon the owners of the permis de recherches receiving a stipulated number of shares in this new company. iese c o n ^ 1 ions w fulfilled last May, when Abd-el-Kader Kabbani, acting for and on behalf of all his associates, filed a petition with the authorities of the Damascus vilayet, declaring he and his associates had transferred their rights under the six licences to Mr. Boxall and Suleiman Bey Nassif,_ and requested that all.-the necessary o icia oirna i i connected with this transfer be proceeded with according to the Mining Regulations. The Administrative Council of the vilayet found that the request was quite legal and in conformity with the regulations, and referred all the papers to the Ministry o Mines at Constantinople for final confirmation and sanction. As soon as these formalities were got through at Damascus Messrs. Boxall and Suleiman Bey instructed a certain Mr. D. Murr, a lawyer and native of Beirout, to proceed to Constantinople in order to follow up and hasten the remaining formalities at the Ministry of Mines. Mr. Murr on his arrival called at the embassy to explain his mission and to request that assistance might be afforded him m his endeavour to secure the rights of Mr. Boxall, a British subject. Mr. Murr was provi e vi a * Not reproduced. -&gt;\ Copy to India 26 SEP 1913 [1825 gg 2]o power of attorney from Mr. Boxall, but as the case did not at that stage appear to call for any official assistance, and, moreover, in the absence of any instructions, Mr. Murr was only unofficially put in the way of getting into touch with the Mining Department in order to be. able to follow up the matter himself. Mr. Murr succeeded in getting his documents through the Mining Department the Council of State, and finally through the Council of Ministers, when Mr. H. Goldie and Suleiman Bey reached Constantinople. The official orders to the Damaacas authorities instructing them to carry out the official transfers were taken to Damascus by Mr. Murr himself, and Mr. Goldie shortly after left for Egypt Suleiman Bey, who called on me on the 23rd instant, informed me that in a letter which he had received from the engineer of the syndicate—a Mr. Brown—he had been advised that oil had been found on one of the properties, and that boring operations were proceeding actively. The engineers who have visited the district covered by the 'permis de redierdies seem, according to Messrs. Goldie and Suleiman, to have been much impressed with the possibilities of the development of the oil industry in those regions. I am given to understand that the capital of the company formed by Mr. Boxall is 40,000L, and some 20,000Z. have already been expended in machinery boring operations, &amp;c. The permis de recherehes are now in the names of Mr. Boxall and Suleiman Xassif, and it is presumed that the concession will be applied for in their joint names although Mr. Goldie was advised that, for many reasons, it would be preferable the concession should only appear in the name of Mr. Boxall. r 7 ERNEST WEAKLEY.

Memorandum communicated to Hakki Pasha AMONG the enterprises in the Ottoman dominions in which British capitalists are interested and in which they hope, eventually, to have a large participation, may he mentioned the oilfields situated in the Hauran sanjak of the vilayet of Damascus. Prospecting licences (“ permis de recherche ”), to the number of five, were duly obtained for these oilfields from the Damuscus authorities on the 20th October, 1326 (2nd November, 1910), by a few notables resident in Damascus, Beirout, and Haiffa. A certain amount of prospecting work involving considerable expenditure was carried out; and, the period for prospecting allowed by the licences not having been sufficient, an extension of time for one year was applied for and granted by the Damascus authorities in conformity with the mining regulations. In order to provide the necessary capital lor working to advantage so important an undertaking, the holders of the licences entered into an agreement with a Mr. Edward Thomas Boxall, a British subject, of 9, Bishopsgate, London, and a certain Suleiman Bey Nassif, of Cairo, and, by formal application to the authorities at Damascus, transferred all their rights under the five licences to Messrs. Boxall and Suleiman Bey Nassif. This transfer was duly authorised by the Council of State as well as by the Council of Ministers in the month of July last. The company formed in London by Mr. Boxall for the purpose of carrying out prospecting operations in the properties ceded under the licences has now incurred an expenditure of close upon 15,000b in boring operations in only one or two of the properties. The company, however, realise that the short period of six months which now remains, calculated from the date of transfer, and to which they are entitled undei the regulation regarding transferred licences, is quite inadequate for the purpose of testing all their properties. In view of the important interests which are involved, Sir E. Grey has the honour to request that his Highness Hakki Pasha will urge upon his Government the advisability of giving a wider interpretation to the stipulations of the mining law, as far as prospecting operations for petroleum are concerned, and that, in the case of the company now working in Syria, a further tw r o years extension of time, dating liom the day of the expiry of the licences, may be afforded for conducting boring operations in all the properties now registered in the joint names of Mr. Boxall and Suleiman ey Nassif. ^ . Sir E. Grey further confidently relies upon the Ottoman Government undertaking to confirm the above company in the possession of any of the properties concernec which they may ultimately elect to develop.

[40854] Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received September 4.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, September 3, 1913. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 5th and 18th August, enclosing copy of a draft statement of further concessions which Hakki Pasha desires His Majesty’s Government to grant, and of a telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople relative thereto, and to offer the following observations thereon for Sir E. Grey’s consideration. Section 1 of the Draft .—The Turkish Government are doubtless fully aware of the objections of principle entertained by His Majesty’s Government towards any system of monoplies as being burdensome to consumers and restrictive of trade. Consumption duties may not be open to such pronounced objection, but in this particular instance their establishment would be accompanied by an appreciable increase (amounting to 4 per cent, ad valorem) in the import duty on the articles to which such taxes would apply. Any consent on the part of His Majesty’s Government to the proposals advanced by Hakki Pasha would therefore constitute, in the opinion of the Board, a material concession of such an order as to require some corresponding concessions in favour of British and general trade. Under existing conditions Turkey has in operation monopolies on salt and tobacco. Further monoplies on matches, cigarette paper, and playing cards would have no very great interest to British trade, and all these articles are the subject of monoplies, while spirits are subjected to additional excise or consumption taxes, in one or more of the other Balkan States. The Board would, therefore, not be disposed to advise that His Majesty’s Government should press their objections of principle in these cases, provided that the other Powers agree to the Turkish request and, further, that a disposition is shown by the Turkish Government to meet the reasonable icquiiements- of His Majesty’s Government in other directions, including the matter of light dues. As regards petroleum and sugar, however, the case is on a different footing. e Board are not aware of any countries, other than Servia and Greece, in which petroleum constitutes a monopoly, and even as regards the former country the monopoly is hmited to refined kerosene. If the proposal of the Turkish Government is intended to cover all forms of the product in question—fueloil, illuminating oil, lubricating oil, petroleum spirit, Ac.—the demand is one of considerable magnitude. Although the l mted Kingdom is of couse not directly interested in the importation of these commodities into the Turkish Empire, His Majesty’s Government are concerned m tins proposal on account of the negotiations now proceeding with regard to tne Mesopotamian 01 concession. Sir E. Grey will recall that one of the bases of an agreement, as suggested in the Board’s letter of the 8th August, between the groups repiesented by Mr. Greenway and Sir H. Babington Smith respectively, is a marketing arrangement wherebv Asiatic Turkey would be served solely by the Ango-Iersian 11 Company. Any agreement of this kind, which would necessarily have the support and countenance of ^ MaPUs Government, would directly conflict mononolv which the Turkish Government might make, unless such monopoly were 'ranted (for Asiatic Turkey at least) to the Anglo- Persian 0,1 Company or its nominees. As rehrds sUar the Board recognise that other countries, cm Austria and Russia, are”likely to be more concerned in the proposal Some effort is, however, being made by Em ec * o ^ t [ le es tablish- business in sugar of British refining at tht ’ ^ ^ * t d Eve ’ n were this not the ment of a monopoly ° £ a neces aff aGm eU foo Therwol see less objection to the imposition on this articl^^rf T’consumption dtity sufficiently moderate^^n amoun^ to permit oO^fan international trade being carried on under ordinarj compel [1863 d--2} Copy to Tnd ; a 12 SEP 19134 2 is to be remembered that 15 per cent, ad valorem, which will be the new rate of import duty, will of itself be no inconsiderable burden upon consumers. The Board would therefore suggest that Hakki Pasha should be informed that His Majesty’s Government will not object to the establishment of monoplies or the imposition of consumption taxes in respect of matches, cigarette paper, playing cards and spirits ; that as regards sugar, they would regret the adoption of either course but would regard a consumption duty as the less objectionable, and that, as regards petroleum, their decision must depend upon, and will largely be influenced by, the settlement reached in respect of the Mesopotamian oil concession. As regards paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section of Hakki Pasha’s draft, I am to say that the Board concur in Mr. Mailing’s suggestion that the British share of the future imports into Turkey in respect of any monopoly should be based on the average proportion of the imports from the United Kingdom to the total imports during the three years preceding the establishment of the monopoly. The undertaking formulated in Hakki Pasha’s draft, viz., that the actual quantity to be purchased shall be the average for the preceding three years would deprive the United Kingdom of any right to participate in any increase of trade, and would, on the other hand, compel the Turkish Government or its nominees to purchase a constant quantity whatever the variations in their requirements. As regards paragraph 4, if any consent is given to the establishment of consumption duties, it ought, in the opinion of the Board, to be made clear that this should form no precedent for the imposition of similar duties, under any name whatso ever, in regard to any other articles ; that the maximum limit of such duties must be fixed by arrangement with the Powers ; and that similar articles of local production shall be subjected to precisely the same amount of charge. The Board note Hakki Pasha’s reservation in paragraph 5 with regard to the question of light dues. They assume that His Majesty’s Government will insist on the appointment in 1919 of a joint commission for the preparation of a revised scale of dues to come into effect in the year 1925, and that no agreement made by the Ottoman Government shall be regarded as restricting such revision in any way whatsoever. Section 2 of the Dra ft .— 1 he Board entirely concur in Mr. Marling’s observations on this section, and they also think there is much force in his contention that His Majesty s Government should reserve their right to discuss the contents of any new stamp law before it is applied to British subjects. . Majesty s Government have already expressed their willingness to consider, in conjunction with the other Powers, the extent to which it may be possible to modify the regime of the ( apitulations, and they think it undesirable that the question should be dealt v ith in a piecemeal manner. On this ground alone the present proposal, involving a breach in the regime, is open to criticism, but, in addition, the objection advanced by Mr. Marling to Ottoman authorities or subordinate officials of the Debt Admimstiation being vested with power to interfere with British firms in their places of business, and to have access to their confidential papers, deserves most careful consideration. Section o of the Draft. The Board share Mr. Marling’s misgivings with respect to the pioposed imposition of octroi duties, but tliev* recognise that it is difficult for His i ajesty s Government to meet the Turkish request with a complete refusal, and that it may be necessary to acquiesce in the imposition of municipal octroi on a limited range of aiticles, which in their opinion should be restricted to articles of food i comestlhles . )• The y would suggest accordingly that in the first place Hakki Pasha s ion d he inv ited^ to indicate precisely what the Turkish Government include under the term articles generalement soumis a Toctroi,” and the maximum tariff which they contemplate. T lie Board assume that the octroi duties would be levied on articles of native origin as well as on those imported. AV ith respect to the counter-concessions which, as indicated in the second paragrap i of this letter, the Board are of opinion might properly be sought from the ur us xov ernment, the Board are not in a position to offer any observations' on proposa s (1) to (4) put forward by Mr. Marling. As regards the contracts for the i esopotannan irrigation works, however, it appears from enquiries they have caused to be made that the British firms of Messrs. S. Pearson and Son (Limited) and Sir John Jackson (Limited) were the only firms that were willing to tender for the contracts o ered by the I urkish Government, and that although they ultimately found themselves una lie to agree to certain of the financial arrangements proposed, and the matter is accorc mg y m abeyance at present; one firm (Messrs. S. Pearson and Son) has spent large sums m the preparation of estimates and surveys, and the other (Sir JohnJackson (Limited)) has also incurred preliminary expenditure of this kind and is moreover, at present engaged on the Hindie barrage. In these circumstances the linns have, in the opinion of the Board, established a preferential claim to such contracts as ni&lt;i) be awarded loi the nrigation works by the Ottoman Oovernment, and flight properly receive the active support of His Majesty’s Government. The Board recognise that it: might be inadvisable to stipulate for the immediate allocation to British firms of the contract, for the whole undertaking, but as the work will no doubt be carried out in sections, they think it might be stipulated that contracts for the earlier sections, involving expenditure up to a certain amount, should be given to one or both of the British firms, and that all subsequent contracts should be put up to open tender. Should Sir E. Grey concur in this view, the Board will be glad to consult with the firms in question with a view to fixing a reasonable proportion of the work to be assigned to them. Finally, as regards oil, the Board, as indicated above, are of opinion that Hakki Pasha should be informed that the decision of His Majesty’s Government on the question of the proposed monopoly will depend largely upon the settlement of the matter of the Mesopotamian oil concession. Should a satisfactory solution of that problem be reached, it is possible that the Anglo-Persian Company, which would have the sole right of marketing in Asiatic Turkey, would readily enter into arrangements with the holders of any concessions which might be obtained in Syria and the Farsan Islands. A further letter on the subject of these latter concessions will be addressed to you shortly. I have, See. II.

Our recent experience in case of octroi illegally^ levied at Adrianople shows that Central Government cannot or will not enforce its authority against Municipal Council. Moreover, it would be impossible obviously to devise any means to secure properties and revenue by municipal or any guarantee that such revenue will not be impounded by State in moments of financial stress as is believed to have been done in the case of recent Constantinople municipal loan. Counter-concession might comprise :— (1.) Settlement of all outstanding money claims, including floating debt claims as set forth in Constantinople despatch No. 512 of 1911, and claims arising out of state of war, linaria, requisitions, &amp;c. (2.) Missionary question (see Constantinople despatch No. 331 of 1912, and Church Missionary Society’s letter to loreign Office of 7th July, 1913), on which I shall be reporting in a few days. (3.) Ratification of Aden hinterland frontier agreement. (4.) Extension of Aidin Railway outside German zone. (5.) Mesopotamian irrigation to go to British firm. ( 6 .) Oil concessions in Mesopotamia, Farsan, and Syria. This list is extensive, but, considering immense pecuniary advantages that would accrue from our concession to Porte, I do not think that it is exaggerated. ^ As to inopportuneness from political point of view of proceeding with the negotiations at present moment, I beg leave to urge again considerations submitted in my telegram No. 407 • To discuss adequately with Hakki Pasha, an ex-legal adviser to the Porte, question which forms subject of proposed declaration requires very intimate and extensive knowledge such as can only be acquired by long experience here, and it is imperative, in my opinion, that, if these negotiations are to be pursued, member of embassy or consulate-general should take part in them.56crs u • In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 36771/15 • and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. bir:- Foreign Office 20th.

(e) To work the drill efficiently it should be run 16 hours daily, thus ^ ^ 2 drillers and 14 labourers working in two shifts of 8 noms eacli are required for each drill. by conditions. I -—b*™ 1 ’»* “ j- ^ . mi • L* X- 4 * /LO OOO t.O f ) ^(b) The population at present uses sweet water only for drinking and cooking purposes, and, so far as my enquiries go, in the ordinary household at present from 1 to 2 gallons per head is so consumed; thus supply of some 80,000 to 1 , 00,000 gallons daily is required as a minimum. All washing is at present done with the brackish water obtainable from the wells existing in nearly every house ; but if sweet water was easily available and cheap, a large number of the better class people would use it in preference. Consequently an increase m demand on this account requires to be foieseen. required during the hot weather months from 1st May to 15th October than for the remainder of the year. 5 The Anglo-Persian Oil Company of Mohammerah, who have now an Engineering Department and are prepared to quote for such wor v and plant, inform me that an evaporator plant for condensing fresh water from the sea_, to produce some 36,000 gallons per 24 hours, wouldcost irom £.,000 to £3,009, I have no idea, however, what the working cost of such a plant would he, in fuel, staff, buildings, etc. 6 . I have submitted the above details in the hope that^ the information, meagre and speculative though it he, may prove of use in estimating the probable and possible requirements of the town and m weighing the ^van tages and obiections respectively attaching to a supply dependent on the two methods indicated. The most important points to be borne m mind are (a) That some system of supply is very urgently required. (b) That the system must be such as to admit of the water being avail able easily and above all cheaply. It would appear that though artesian wells may he the more expensive m initial cost, the subsequent working expenses would be so small (m comparison with a condensing plant) that water would he cheap and plentiful. -Further I would venture to submit that the whole initial cost of the drilling plant need not fall upon Kuwait, if Government are prepared to use the plant tor experi ments at other places such as Bushire, Bahrain and Bandar Abbas, where a somewhat similar though less acute difficulty in the provision of a good water- supply also presents itself. 7. In conclusion I would again solicit a very early decision in this exceed- ingly urgent matter. tin As oilNo.'2392-758, dated Calcutta, th e 7th May 1913. From—H. H.

In continuation of my letter No. 2047, dated tlio 3rd April 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. E. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, upon the prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf. Prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf. Some 24 miles south of Kuwait, a small area of Tertiary rocks projects above the surface of the Desert, and is introduction. known as Burqan. I examined it between the dates 2nd to 5th March, 1913. Burqan is close to the rock known as Wara, and consists of some small knolls and rising ground. The knolls are Eocks * ridge*like and are grouped along or parallel to the permiter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately Bom north to south. ^ The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Comglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara* caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has a scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at its edges and a great deal of scree hut here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of oehreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sandstone, and many large fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Flakes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills, and the efflorescent salt m the central plain All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface of Dr Pilgrim’s “ Pars series^ I am inclined to think the Pars beds are actually exnosecf the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone representing the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Pars exposure would be about a mile long by mile broad. The geotectonic features appear to ran, in a general way, somewhere between north, south and north-west-south-east. This is borne out 0) by the orientation of the Burqan dome and the Structure. relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of north from Burcian), («) by the general strike and trend of outcrops in Persia and further south in Arabia, (m) by the trend of the Persian G-u nd Pnohrates and Ti'Tis Valleys, {tv) by the direction of the low flat swcll-ndges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a circumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf which shows a very circumstance j the Arabian side but a comparatively steep gentie eastward sUelviug From this we may dfiduce that easterly-dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerfy-dfpping beds. The dome at Bureau is a very gentle one. A little bituminous earth is found in the central plain. The nrospects of obtaining an si supply depend tUt principally upon (*) ine prosper o age and the capacity lor storage 0 ‘i* 0 f the rocks, (ii) structure, {iii) position •iu a ^ nil “ belt ” The age of the beds is favourable, if it is correct with regard to the oil belt this ig the oil . b e ar i n g series in Persia. to assume f o bebeV e the ’ nature of the beds beneath Burqan should be , f tb „ t 0 f the Pars in Persia, and they may be looked upon therefore different from that ot thenars i^ ^ ; orkable ^u^tities. The structure if eorrertly e diagnosed, is also favourable, a gentle dome in fact being an excellent C19FDtype of folding suitable for an oil-field. As to its geographical position, this locality is not on the line of strike of the rich oil deposits now being worked above Ahwaz, and is, in fact, over 170 miles to the south-west of this line. This does not necessarily mean that oil in commercial quantity does not occur below Burqan, but it adds a decidedly speculative element to any operations. A “floating tract of naphtha,” coinciding no doubt with a submarine seepage was described by Captain Constable as occurring between the islands of Qaru and Kubbar, some 56 miles south-east of Burqan. On the whole, my opinion is that the chances are not unfavourable, and that an oil company would not require much inducement to test it, if protection and permanency of concession were guaranteed. The central plain of Burqan would be the best site for tests, and these should be as deep as possible, as the uppermost layers of the Pars are probably all that are exposed. Under present conditions there would be great difficulty in obtaining water for the boiler ; possibly an internal combustion engine would have to be employed. r r jtier Secret scretary of I jmmittee..
