SECRET. No.8 of 1938. Extract from Intelligence Summary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period 16th to 30th April, 1938. 47. Local Affairs . (i) Three nakhudas of dhows have recently been arrested and heavily fined for attempting to bring indigent foreigners without passports into Bahrain. At the same time an extensive round-up was made in the bazaars of Persians and Qatifis who have been found here without passports and without any ostensible means of livelihood. Some 500 persons were detained for examination and though many of these were subsequently released, the Agency Court is now extremely busy dealing with the balance under King T s Regulation No.2 of 1937. It is hoped that these operations, particularly the heavy fines on the nakhudas, will cause some considerable diminution in the number of indigent foreigners landing without permission in Bahrain.7-o r\ With the Compliments of THE Undek-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

I should be glad to receive your observations on the points raised in Mr. Beckett's minute of the 25th May (Flag S). As regards the first point, the position is that - X - the Bahrein authorities require that the pacsport of any person wishing to land shall bear a visa. Since, however, Bahrein has no officials abroad who can give such vises, the service is performed for the Bahrein Government by British officials. The existing instructiore to this effect are contained in Foreign Office circular -*• of the 10th March, 1932, and will be reproduced in the amended circular which is now under consideration. Prim a facie there seems no reason for defining the expression 'valid visa' in the proposed King's Regulation, and I shall be glad to know whether you agree. Mr. Beckett's second point deals with an obvious &gt;W&lt;' flaw in the^Regulation, and I should be glad of your views as to how the matter should be dealt with. It might perhaps meet the case if the following words were inserted at the end of Articles 2 and 5s- 'in such manner as is prescribed in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the Bahrein Order-in-Council, 1913, as amended by the Bahrein (Amendment) Order-in-Council, 1924' .

ENCLOSURE IN ' ~~ No. 2 6 1 JUL 1937 OM SEC! CQrlf oc.i&gt;41 i rT'sr d i 1 * I Bahrein Order in Council prohibiting the entry into Bahrein of persons who are without passports or visas. 2. As regards Becketts first point, the position is that the Bahrein authorities require that a passport of any person wishing to land shall bear a visa. Since, however, Bahrein has no officials abroad who can give such visas the service is performed for the Bahrein Government by British officials. The existing instructions to this effect are contained in Foreign Office circular No.T.2117/593/ 378 of the 10th March, 1932, and will be reproduced in the revised circular which is now under consideration. In such circumstances it seems to us that the existing wording of Article 1 is adequate for the purpose required, but if Beckett still considers it desirable that there should be some more explicit reference in the King’s Regulation,we should see no objection to inserting after ’’valid visa for Bahrein” the words ’’according to the practice and instructions from time to time in force”if that would meet his view. 3. Beckett's second point refers to an obvious flaw in the draft Regulations we suggest that this might be dealt with by the addition of the following words at the end of Articles 2 and 5:- 'and any direction or order for such removal shall be deemed to be an order to which the provisions of Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, as amended by^ Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council, 19^4', oa* O^/^LcJr^ , 4.

We hope that in the light of the foregoing it will be possible to push on with the 'Allowance' of the draft King's Regulation as soon as possible. )h*u tS£&lt;L) A. C. B.

REGd. POL. 3 JUN1937 IN D . / x ^ r FIC E A.C.B. Symon, Esq., ENCLOSURE IN V/cE’CLY LET1ERt w Copy (E 2793/1913/91) Before we take steps to get this draft King’s Regulation printed etc. I think we must refer to the India Office on the following points: (l) It would appear desirable that the expression ’’valid visa” should he defined. Who are the persons for instance who are entitled to give a valid visa for Bahrein? (2) Both Articles 2 and 5 provide that a person may he ordered to remove himself from Bahrein or may he removed, hut I am not clear whether it has been sufficiently thought out how this is to he done in practice and whether further provisions are not necessary in the King’s Regulation. It is of course simple for the court to make an Order telling a man to leave Bahrein and if he goes within the time limit, all is well. If he fails to remove himself and it is found that this is the result of a contempt of the order, I presume he renders himself liable to further penalties for a second breach of the order and that an order may tl^e/ he made removing him, hut how is this compulsory removal to he effected? Presumably he will he put upon a ship hut is it necessary to have any provision compelling ships to take such persons and who is to pay for the cost of removal? I should have thought that it ought to he provided that the person to he removed should pay if he can and I presume that if he cannot the cost is defrayed from Bahrein funds. Then the question has to he thought of as to what place he is to he removed to. If he possesses a nationality presumably he must he removed to the country to which he belongs,/hut if it cannot he established that he belongs to any country presumably no order removing him can he/be made effective. I think the India Office will want to consider these noints. It would be natural to make use of the orovisions of the Order in Council with regard to deportation, namely, articles 22 to 24, and the India Office might look at these Articles in this connexion. At the same time we should call their attention to the fact that the Articles, particularly Article 22 (4), are really all based upon the assumption that the persons to be deported will all be British subjects or protected persons and as this assumption is not necessarily justified the Article is not really very adequate for the jurisdiction which we exercise in Bahrein and this fact is a further reason why an up to date Bahrein Order in Council should be drafted. We have previously called the attention of the India Office to the fact that the Order of 1913 really is out of date and that for the purposes of its amendment reference might be made to the recent Orders with regard to Koweit and Qatar (Sgd. ) W.

The number of such persons has greatly increased lately, owing to the hope of obtaining employment in the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s oilfield, and the Bahrein Government and the Political Resident regard it as essential that measures should be taken to exclude undesirables of this type. 2. Nearly all these undesirables are non-Bahreinis e.g. Iraqis, Iranians, etc., who fall to be dealt with by the Political Agent, but as it is not an offence under the Bahrein Order in Council for this class of person to enter Bahrein in the circumstances described above there is no proper machinery for dealing with them. 3. The normal procedure for introducing new legislation over British and foreign subjects in Bahrein is - under Section 70 of the Bahrein Order in Council - to apply by a King’s Regulation to such subjects the relevant edict (’Alan) by which the Bahrein Government make such legislation applicable to their own subjects. In this instance, however, no proper Bahrein Government edict exists on which a King’s Regulation can be issued, and after consultation with the local political authorities the Political Resident recommends that the situation should be dealt with by the issue of a simple King’s Regulation. 4. The Government of India agree with the views expressed by the Political Resident, and have forwarded a draft King’s Regulation (Flag A) to be called the ’’Bahrein Passport Regulation 1937” which they recommendshould he allowed. 5. The draft Regulation appears to he generally suitable, and subject to the concurrence of the Foreign j Office it is proposed to take the necessary steps to issue the Regulation.

I entirely concur. 2. When these leUidesirabies are Bahrain subjects it is of course the business of the Bahrain Government to deal with them. Nearly all these undesirables are, however, foreigners (Iraqis, Iranians, etc.), with a few British Indians, who under the Bahrain Order in Council can only be dealt with by the Political Agent. But it is not an offence under the Bahrain Order in Council for this class of person to enter Bahrain in the circumstances described in paragraph 1 of this letter. There is therefore no proper machinery for dealing with such cases. 3. As you are aware the normal procedure for introducing new ligislation over British and foreign subjects in Bahrain is - under Section 70 (a) of the Bahrain Order in Council - to apply by a King's Regulation to such subjects the relevant edict ('Alan) by which the Bah/rain Government make such legislationapplicable to their subjects. In this instance, however, no proper Bahrain G-overnment edict exists on which we can issue a King^ Regulation. There is an old Bahrain Government Order which purports to govern the landing of persons at Bahrain, but as this Order is obscure and itsy^of its Sections are now out of date, it is unsuitable for use to-day. 4. Captain Hickinootham, when Acting Political Agent, Bahrain, suggested, after consultation with the Bkhrain Government, a Bahrain Government Landing Regulation and a King’s Regulation making it applicable to those persons to whom the Bahrain Order in Council applies. But the proposed Bahrain Government Landing Regulation is father complicated and in some respects unsuitable. 5. In the circumstances, therefore, I recommend the issue of a simple King’s Regulation, of which a draft is attached. It is based generally on King’s Regulation No.2 of 1924 issued under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. ,, . 6. The scale of punishment is similar to tfe-e- laid down in the Indian Passport Act (XXXIV of 1920). I should however, explain that Article 4 is designed to put a stop to a practice, which has grown up, of Iranian and other vessels bringing^ over destitute persons and other undesirables for a small fee and landing them by subterfuge. If the masters of the vessels know that they render their vessels liable toddtention, or even sale, they will be less likely to carry on this traffic and the owners of the vessels will take steps to see that their vessels are not so used. 7. With reference to paragraph 5 of the draft King’s Regulation. Since it will be some time before the King’s Regulation can come into force, and since in the meantime destitutes will be entering Bahrain, I Agent should be given under the King’s think the Political Regul ft 11 on ---opowers to deal with such individuals. 8.

The Chief Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under ^ ^ the hand and seal of the Political Resident, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, and to carry him to and deliver him up at Bombay according to the warrant. Where any person is to be so sent to Bombay, the Court before which he is charged shall take the preliminary examination, and shall bind over such of the proper witnesses as are British subjects in their own recognizances to appear and give evidence on the trial. 17. —(1) The Political Resident may by General Order prescribe the manner in which, and the places at which, sentences of imprisonment are to be carried into execution within the limits of the Order.

' removed to, and imprisoned in, any place that shall be prescribed by the Political Resident under the authority provided for in subsection (1) of this Article. 18. Where an offender convicted before any Court under this Order is sentenced to imprisonment, and the Political Resident proceeding under section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, authority in that behalf being hereby given to him, considers it expedient that the sentence should be carried into effect elsewhere than within the limits of this Order, and the offender is accordingly sent for imprisonment to a place outside the limits of this Order, the place shall be either a place in the Presidency of Bombay, or a place in some other part of His Majesty’s dominions, the Government whereof consents that offenders may be ^ent thither under this Article, or a place in which by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means His Majesty has jurisdiction, provided that if a person is not a British subject he shall only be sent under this Article to a place in His Majesty’s dominions. 19.—(1) In cases of murder or culpable homicide, if either the death or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death happened in Bahrein, a Court acting under this Order shall have the like jurisdiction over any person to whom this Order applies who is charged either as a principal offender or as an abettor as if both such criminal act and the death had happened in Bahrein. (2) In the case of any offence committed on the high seas or within the Admiralty jurisdiction by any person who at the time of committing such offence o O. C. 1786*.a 5 «* O. C. 1786* 9 ( 2 ) r= was on board a British ship, or by any British subject on board a foreign ship to which he did not belong, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Order, have jurisdiction over such person as if the offence had been committed within jurisdiction. (3) In cases tried under this Article no different sentence can be passed from the sentence which could be passed in England if the crime were tried there. ( 4 ) The foregoing provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be adaptations, for the purposes of this Order and of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, of the following enactments, namely The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1849; The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1860; The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, Part XIII.; and those enactments shall apply accordingly, and be administered in Bahrein. 20. Where a person is convicted of an offence, the Court before which he is convicted may, if it thinks fit at any time before he is discharged, require him to give security to the satisfaction of the Court for his future good behaviour, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, Cause him to come or be brought before the Court. ? * Y 4 tT 21 , (1) Where it is shown by evidence on oath, to the satisfaction of the District Court, that any British subject has committed, or is about to commit, an offence against this Order, or is otherwise conducting himself so as to be dangerous to peace and good order, or is endeavouring to excite enmity between the people of Bahrein and His Majesty, or is intriguing within the limits of this Order against His Majesty’s power and authority, the Court may, if it thinks fit, by order under its seal, prohibit that person from being within the limits of this Order, during any time therein specified, not exceeding two years. t*' l (2) The Court, by order in writing under its seal, may vary any order of prohibition (not extending the duration thereof), and may revoke any order of prohibition or removal. (3) The Court shall forthwith report the order and the grounds thereof to the Chief Court, which shall forthwith report to the Governor-General of India in Council every- order made under this Article, and the grounds thereof, and the proceedings thereunder. 22.—(1) If any British subject fails to give security for good behaviour or for keeping the peace when lawfully required to do so, or fails to comply with an order of prohibition made under this Order, the Chief Court or the Lhstiict Court may, if it thinks fit, order that he be deported from any place within its jurisdiction as prescribed by this Order. (2) If the order of deportation is made by the District Court, it shall forthwith report to the Chief Court the order and the grounds thereof.10 (3) Thereupon the person ordered to be deported shall, unless the Chief Court thinks fit otherwise to direct, be as soon as practicable, and in the case of a person convicted either after execution of the sentence or while it is in course of execution, removed in custody under warrant to the place named^n the warrant. (4) The place shall be a place in that part of His Majesty’s dominions, or in the British Protectorate, to which the person belongs, or the Govern ment of which consents to the reception of persons deported under this Order. (5) The Court, on making an order of deportation, may, if it thinks fit, order the person to be deported to pay all or any part of the expenses of his deportation, to be fixed by the Court in the order. Subject thereto, the expenses of deportation shall be defrayed as the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Treasury, or with the previous or subsequent assent of the Secretary of State, the Governor-General of India in Council, directs. ( 6 ) The Chief Court shall forthwith report to the Govern or-General of India in Council every order of deportation made under this Order, and the grounds thereof, and the proceedings thereunder. (7) If a person deported under this Order returns to Bahrein without permission in writing of the Chief Court, or the Governor-General of India in Council, or the Secretary of State (which permission the Chief Court, or the Governor-General of India in Council, or the Secretary of State respectively ^ - may give), he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two months, or with a tine which may extend to 1,000 rupees, or with both. ( 8 ) He shall also be liable to be forthwith again deported under the original or a new order, and a fresh warrant. 23. An appeal shall not lie against an order of prohibition, or removal, or deportation made under this Order. 24. —(1) Where under this Order a person is to be sent or removed or deported from any place within the jurisdiction of the Court as prescribed by ^ this Order he shall, by warrant of the Court sealed with its seal, be detained, if necessary, in custody, or in prison, until a fit opportunity for his removal or deportation occurs, and then be put on board a vessel belonging to, or in the service of. His Majesty, or if no such vessel is available, then on board some other British or other fit vessel.
