The Rai Bahadur is the only member of the British Indian Trading communitv possessing property in Oman, A large number of Shaikhs of the interior, inclucling the Imam himself, seem to prefer to entrust their business matters to Gokaldas rather that to Arab merchants of Muscat and Mutrah and as a result the Rai Bahadur has acquired house property and date gardens of considerable value. 273. Reference serial No 257 of 1945. The ill-feeling between the Khoja and Baluch communities has now subsided. Local opinion is that by his failure to watch the situation and to take action in the early stages, the Wali of Mutrah is unfit to hold his post and it is said that representations for his removal has been made to the Sultan. One of the cases brought by three Khojas against a Baluch named Abdur Rahman in the court of the Political Agent has resulted in the conviction of the accused under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code and his imprisonment for a period of one month. 274. On Saturday, the 8th of September, the most unpopular men in Muscat and Mutrah were undoubtedly the two Qadhis appointed to act as official observers of the new moon.

On the following day tiie messages of congratulation on the Id ul Fitr began to pour in, not only from Arab principalities on either side of Muscat, but also from all the neighbouring villages where celebrations were in full swing. Many of the inhabitants of Muscat and Mutrah felt so bitterly towards the Qadhis and their wAypl supporters that a number of altercations took placd in the bazaars, one of which resulted in a case of assault being brought in the court of the Political Agent. 275.

Under the strain of keeping the fast in weather which made life difficult enough even for those who were able to eat and drink when they wished, a comparatively minor incident in tfatrah led to serious disturbances between the Khoja and Baluch communities. On the morning of the 23rd. August a Baluch who Mas selling fruit in Mutrah bazaar was roughly handled by Municipal officials of the Khoja community, apparently because he had obtained no licence to ply as a street vendor and because the use of the particular place which he had se lected for his trade had been forbidden for such purposes by the Municipality. On the evening of the 23rd. some ill-feeling existed between the communities but no incident was reported. Two days later, however, a stabbing affray took place at Mutrah in which a number of Khojas received knife injuries at the hands of a gang of Baluchis and later in the day there appeared to be every likelihood that serious rioting would break out. Combined action was therefore taken by the Muscat Government and the Political Agent on the evening on the 25th., and 10 persons who were reported to be inciting others to violence were arrested and on the following morning produced in the respective courts of jurisdiction and required to furnish security for good behaviour. This action had desired effect and the situation has returned to normal. A number of cases have since been filed by members of both the communities which are being tried in the courts of the Political Agent and the Mutrah Qadhi. Tribal/-I&amp;P AL AFIAffl £. 25S. The tension which now exists between the Ghafiri and Hinawi factions of Oman^howed signs recently of d enveloping into open hostilities in the region of the Wadi Beni Khalid. This fertile Wadi is under the control of Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah of the.feni Bu Ali, but being himself a Kehabi and the efore a Sunni by belief, Shaikh Ali had £©quested Shaikh Sul iman bin Hamiyar of the Jebel Akhdhar, when he saw him receirtjy at Sur, to provide him with a Ibadhi Qadhi for its inhabitants who arg^all the^^barii i sect. ‘Ihe new Qadhi duly arrived and shortly afterwards hoists the nag^ of the Imam over his residence, allegedly at the instigation of Shaikh laa bin Salih of the Sh&amp;rquiyah. Nettled by this attempt to usurp his authority Shaikh Ali despatched a party to tear do. n the Imam's lag and to deal suitably with the erring Qadhi. The flag was removed and Shaikh Ali's authority re-established, but the Qadhi tock refuge with Shaikh Isa. It seemed unlikely that Shaikh Isa woxGLd accept this defeat of his latest intrigue without retaliation and hostilities were expected to break out between the Beni Bu Ali and the Hirth. So far however no fighting has been reported. 259. On the 30th Shaikh Jabar bin Saud, brtther-in-law of Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of the Jebel Akhdhar called on the Political Agent and made a r equest on behr.ll oi himself and Shaikh Sulaiman that the British Consul should take a special interest in the welfare of the peoples of the Wadi Samil and the Jebel Akhdhar.

His Highness has recently been discussing with the leading merchants of Musc-t and itfutrah the pos ibility of establishing the rupee as the only tender to be acceptable for commercial transactions in the territories under his control. 262. The news that no shipping space would be available for the export of dates to Bombay came as a great shock to the merchant community whose investments in this trade amount mk to approximately 15 lakhs of rupees. Some 400 tons of dates were exported by the steamer which left Musc&gt; t on the 27th of August for Karachi in the hope that distribution from Karachi by rail would be found possible.

The regulations draim up by the Sultan to govern the activities of the newly created Control Department have now been published and appear to be generally satisfactory^ though somewhat muddled in their arrangement in places extremely vague. These regulations cover, inter alia , the systems under diich control and distribution are to be carried out # the submission 02 weekly statements to His Highness showing stocks of essential commodities Issued during the previous week and the stocks in hand, the personal control of the Sultan of all sales to the interior, the appointment of Agents at each fco^n on the Batinah Coast and of inspectors who are to carry out regular tours and to submit reports, the establishment of a pries committee, and ths introduction of ration cards in Unseat and Matrah for certain commodities. For the present it can be said the situation has been much improved and that public approval of these measures is widespread. Queues at the Control shops have disappeared end many of the officials responsible for the more serious abusps of this branch of the administration have been dismissed. 230. The Sultan has had under consideration various proposals for inproving facilities for ths more rapid mil ftarHrig 0 f «hips at Muscat.

Very considerable interest was taken in Muscat and Matrah in the result oi the British General Election* It had never occurred to any that there was the slightest possibility of Mr Churchill 1 s Government being defeated, and, as a result, the news of the success of the Labour Party ease as a groat surprise. What little understanding exists amongst the Arab Community of the democratic system is based on highly coloured storlm of evil intrigues and malpractices associated with elections in Iraq and Persia, and there a,re many who think that Mr Churchill's Government must have been the victim of some such circumstances. mmm 232. The Batinah date crop is reported to be good end largo caravans dry dates for export are arriving at Matrah and Muaoat. The high quality dates grown in the Wadi Samel1 are said to have suffered some damage through i allure of a number of irrigation springs, and a disease known locally as Hataq is said to have attacked pains in the neighbourhood of Quryat • The dollar has appreciated sharply during the past month due to the large demand for this coin to meet payments for datss. 233. Some alarm has been created amongst ths Khojas at Gwadur by the receipt of a threatening letter purporting to come from a Baluch named Isa, who in 1929 and 1931 murdered two members of their community. The letter is almost certainly not genuine, but its receipt coincided with the news that Hayatun, a subject of Kalat State who in January 1944 murdered two British subjects near Gwadur, had returned to the Gwadur area end murdered a Muscat subject at Jiandchil. Hayatun was recently arrested by the Kalat State authorities, who claimed that the MuzWs ha*W been committed in Kalat territory. Confirmation of Hayatun's acquittal by the Kalat Courts has been asked for from the Political Agent Kalat and in the meantime the ftn l t-*! * has telegraphed urgent instructions to the Wall to do everything possible to secure his re-arrest.

Saiyid lariq bin Taimur, half-brother of the Sultan, returned to Muscat on the 7th after completing his admisistrative training in India. The Sultan has not yet made up his mind how best to employ this formidable looking relative and it seems that for the present his need for an educated and qualified man to assist him in the affairs of his Government is in serious conflict with his distrust of one who is no true believer, is more at home in English and German than he is in Arabic, and whose sophistication leads him to doubt Saiyid Tariq's ability to settle down in the narrow and regidly iposlem atmosphere of Muscat. The Sultan recently admitted to the Political Agent that the impression he had formed of his hall’-brother when he saw him this year at Bombau, had been disappointing. His Highness said that he had been forced to administer Saiyid Tariq a severe reprimand in connection with his prodigal spending of money. He had found considerable difficulty in getting Tariq to take this matter seriously and had been particularly enraged by the light hearted way in which he has asked for a substantial sum to *cover his debts. Saiyid Tariq has now been despatched on a three weeks tour covering part of the Batinah, the Wadi Hawasinah, Ibri and Dank and on his return, is to be married to the daughter of Saiyid Nasir bin Hamud al Said of Rustaq. 207® Saiyid Said bin.Ali, ex Wall of bur returned to Muscat from India on the 7th. His health appears to have improved but it seems unlikely that he will ever be fit enough to resume his previous appointment. His return journey was nothing but a series of misfortunes. He was uhable to secure a cabin and though desperately sea sick had to remain on deck; at Bombay the customs authorities seized his stores of analeptics for which he had obtained no license! and last and most unfortunate of all he lost his false teeth over the side of the ship and is now practically speechless* 208.

Kef ere nee serial Ho 182 of 1S45. Satisfied with his efforts to intrduce an ordered system of price control and distribution of essential commoditied, His Highness has now turned his attention to his Treasury. He has taken into his own hands the direction and all financial matters and is reported to be busily engaged on the preparation of the long overdue budget. The first results of his attention on this department have been an instruction to xkx his Finance Officer to confine himself to running the Customs, a reshuffle of the various employees at the Treadury, and the addition to their ranks of Harichand XXk Kothari. Harichand Hothari had previously served for a considerable time as Treasury Officer of the Muscat Government until he resigned three years ago to take up business in India. The current explanation for his sudden return to Muscat some six months ago, is that one or two successful bets at Bombay Race Meetings led him to try his hand at book making. This venture proved a disastrous failure, and he returned to Muscat to persue the less exciting, but also less hazardous occupatioubf shopkeeping* S 213. The disposal of the 400 tons of Persian rice recently imported by the firm of khimji Kamdas has caused some difficulty and necessitated the intervention of the Political Agent, As this rice was to be set off against the quota for cereals, control measures were necessary, butthe Muscat Government refused to sponsor the purchase more than 25% of this rice in view of its high price, and while subjecting the remainder to control refused also to indemnify the inporters against loss, xt is hoped shortly to reach a settlement acceptable tp both sides. 214* At the beginning of the month a dhow loaded with cargo manifested for Alula in Somaliland put in at Muscat for water. Thw dhow was flying the xranian flag and in consequence the Muscat Government were reluctant to act on a request that it should be detained pending enquiries, in response, however, to an urgent request from the Agent at Alula that all measures'to safeguard the cargo should be taken , anM Agent was appointed to represent the shippers and arrangements made to unload the cargo at Muscat. The goods will be reshipped to Alula as soon-as the‘sailing season opens. The Nakhoda^ explanation that he had been caught by the monsoon and had drifted helplessly, was belied by his passengers and it seems more likely that high prices offering for* food and piece-goods rather that the monsoon, were responsible for his arrival at Muscat. 215* His Highness the Sultan dined with the Political Agent on the 10th. His apetite appeared unusually poor and when the Politicau Agent commented on this he said that he vas making serious efforts tom w reduce his belly**.

He left Sur on the ftth May after seeing the Shaikhs gathered to meet him there and receiving their acceptance to his invitation to them to come to mscat as his guests. On the 6th May the Political Agent received a letter from the Sultan written at Qantab where the State launch had been towed with engine trouble. His Highness finally arrived in Muscat on the afternoon of the same day and immediately despatched a somewhat terse note to his Military Adviser complain ing of the unreliability of the launch. He did not mention in this letter that the number of his followers crowded on to this small craft exceeded 40 and that 9 in consequenee 9 the launch had proceeded most of the way in an almost sinking condition with the exhaust pipe of the engine some two feet below the surface of the water. His Highness received all the notables of Muscat and Mutrah on the day following his arrival. 149. The news of the end of hostilities in Europe was received in Muscat with great enthusiasm. The announcement was made by the firing of a salute of 31 guns from the Mirani fort and the simultaneous dressing of the Agency and all State flagstaffs. His Highness telegraphed a message of congratulations to His Majesty the King in which he expressed the hope that success would continue to attend His Majesty^ Forces. He also addressed a cordial letter to the political Agent. During the holidays which followed the announcement! representatives of all communities visited the Agency to express their joy and relief. On Sunday, the 13th, tanksgiving services were held at the Mission Church and during the four days following the announcement the poor were fed by both the British and Arab communities, unfortunately various functions arranged in celebration of vistory had to be postponed owing to the unaisoidable absence of the political Agent. On the 14th 9 however, festive parties were held at the Agency Sports Club, and at the Agency. Celebrations were also held at Gwadur where the Political Agent received messages of congratulation from the Wall and prominent members of the community. . v 160. Shortly after his arrival His Highness informed the Political Agent that Saiyid Shihab bin Faisal, his Minister for External Affairs had been taken seriously ill and had been granted leave. A story more acceptable to Muscat ears is that, in his fury at the chaotic state of affairs existing in the most important office of his State, the Sultan immediately dismissed Saiyid Shihab, halved his allowance and, to make quite certain that hie displeasure was fully understood, cut off the water supply of his house. The shock of this action was such that his: uncle and ex-Minister has retired to Iti with high blood pressure^!.•* * His Highness is attending pe reoiiaHy to all matters which were the previous concern of the Minister for: External Affairs.

His Highness is at present engaged in doing everything possible to impress them and hopes to open the conversations shortly Shaikh Sulaiman has found much to interest him in Muscat 3 but so far nothing has exceeded his fascination for the engine of the launch which brought him to Muscat. Shortly after leaving Sur he descended into the engine room and, to the consternation of the rest of the party, amused himself there for several hours. His discovery that the priming valves, when opened, emitted tongues of flame with an impressive noise, so alarmed the rest of the passengers, that the Chief Wali who was accompanying the party was forced to visit the engine room himself to persuade the Shaikh to return to the deck. s mu m 154« No ships called at Muscat during the period under review.

It is not known by hehas choeon to return to Muscat at the present time.

His Highness left Salalah for Cairo on March 31st in a special •Lodestar 1 aircraft, one of the planes at the personal disposal of the Air Officer Commanding in Chief, Middle East. This arrangement was made by the Hon'ble the Political Resident during his last visit to Cairo. The Sultan intends to stay about three months in the Middle East and visit Palestine and possibly Syria. He is hoping to obtain expert treatment for his long-standing stoiftch trouble and also to find a sohooll* suitable for his vouns heir. ^ ,, was P rec Q d e3 by his Secretary, Ali bin Mohammad A1 Jamali who left by B.O.A.C. on March the 22nd.

Survivors have now reached Salalah. Their story is that there were altogether two dhows from Muscat and one from the Hadhramaut. The submarine surfaced sometime after dark and first machine, gunned and than rammed the dhews. They were carrying cloth. The two dhows, Sugarpasa and Haiti are still missing, but the authorities in India have been unable to trace the enemy broadcast alleging that they had been captured. SHIFTING . E-Sang arrived from India on the 17th March 1944 and landed 2 packages stationery. LOCUST MISSION . 63. Reference paragraph 34 of this series. The locust mission has now been withdrawn, as it is required to operate in Saudi Arabia. Until this decision was tal^en it had been Mr. Fitzgerald's intention to try to visit the interior of£ Oman* De'tailed advice on “the “tribal posit.ion^on areas where these visits could be attempted with reasonable chances of success has been obtained from the Sultan but the project has been temporarily abandoned. Very briefly the Sultan has advised that the territories of the Imam and Shaikh Isa of the Sharqiyah are, at any rate for the time being, f out of bounds'. There is a reasonable chance of success in Jaalan and there are two safe routes from Baraimi t; Muscat through the mountains north of Miskim The Sultan has also suggested that the locust party might like to make an expedition from Baraimi via Dhank to Jaalan following a route just outside the South West boundary of the areas under the control of the Imam and Shaikh Isa. This route would be through territory which the Sultan claims is sufficiently under his control to offer chances of success with the usual Khafirs. SLAVE TRADE , 64, It is reported from Llekran that there is a recrudescence of slave traffic with Muscat, slaves being ^exchanged for weapons. Enquiries are being made. So far it .appears that although there is s shortage of ammunition, rifles are fetching high prices. The notorious Mirza bin Barkat, who was rumoured to have been killed, is now said to be still alive and to be in gashkard, Persian Mekran. At the same time the Shaikh of Khadrrah, a port to the North of Muscat notorious for many years as a channel for this traffic is said to be increasing in wealth and influence. GWADUR . The exchange rate for the baiza, the local equivalent of the India peisa, has been for some time 160 to the rupee as opposed to about 60 in Muscat. This had led to hoarding and subsequent smuggling. The local price control committee are therefore fixing the baiza rate in Gwadur at 80 to the rupee and at the same time reducing all baiza prices by 50^. This should mean that the cost of living expressed in rupees will not rise. LQgAL AFFAIRS . • There has been an epidemic of might robberies in Matrah. ^ The reason appears to be that nightwatchmen who wore originally recruited fr^m the Beni Omar were recently replaced by men of the Beni Ali. The former are endeavouring to show that the Beni Ali are inefficient. Forty more nightwatchmen have therefore been appointed and the Wali is endeavouring to extend the * ~ incidence of the Harasa (watchmen) tax which is voluntary. SMUGGLING * 67. There have baen a number of reports of smuggling of restricted articles from India. One of the routes is from Pasni and Jiwani via Gwadur and another direct from India. One Hamad bin Said now resident in India is reported to be the ring leader, consigning the smuggled articles to his brother, Talib a local merchant. Full details have been • sent to the Export Controllers, Karachi and Bombay* TRIBAL AFFAIRS . 68* There is trouble in Dhahirah between the Dhuru and the Manazara tribes and 12 casualties are reported. It is further said that Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of the Jebel Akhdar and the Imam are demanding the surrender of the aggressors who are from the Dhuru tribe.X • KXCHAHGE R-CTR .

Al Aswad has therefore been imprisoned by the Muscat Government on suspicion - a curious train of thought and an even more curious conception of Justice. It is also reported that the Wall of Birka has arrested two leading men of Al Aqda as hostages against the production of the boys or the kidnapper. It will, thus be seen that the Muscat Government is sparing no effort to find at least one scapegoat.

The prospect of His Highness the Sultan's return to Muscat, where he is expected about the 13th October, Continues to be the chief, topic-of conversation amongst the local population. It is now just over two years since His Highness left Mfcscat and the general consensus of opinion is that his present visit will not extend beyond three months as his preference for the quiet and cool of Dhofar is well known# There is much twittering in the dovecots of the? various departments who anticipate His Highness's attentions on his return, and it is reported that,' no least of all, is the wall of Mat rah awaiting His Highness* return with seme* a result of his popular or perhaps unpopular appeal to the fairer sdx# •• The Sultan's usual method of expressing displeasure Is by not answering letters addressed to him and, for this reason, it is thought by some that the Wail of Matrah will have some questions to answer on His Hlghitess* arrival.

LOCAL AFFAIRS * Death of Wali of Boshar . 91 81. The sudden death of the Wall of Boshar, Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah A1 Khalili, on the 24th April has been the subject of considerable comment. He was visiting the Wali of Matrah. IsmaillKhalil Rassasi Effendi, with whom he drank a glass of sharbat. Soon after he left the house and fell dead in the road. His body was examined by Dr. Hynes, the Agency Surgeon, and by Dr. Thoms of the American Mission Hospital, both of whom reported that the death was due to heart failure. This explanation has not however satisfied the relations of the deceased who suspect that the sharbat contained poison. There seem to be no grounds for this suspicion other than the wish of the wall Ismail*s several influential enemies that it should be believed* a wish which they are sparing no trouble to see The success of their efforts may be judged from the facts that the fl/ali of Matrah seldom now leaves his house unaccompanied by armed guards and that he is contemplating going on leave to India; the latter, one would think a move of doubt- tul wisdom. Being a man of character and personality his discomfiture has been a source of glee to the many who are ready to disparage him. it * ^ The late Wali W3S rem arkable in being the brother of the Lnam of Oman and at the same time a loyal and valued servant of the Sultan of Muscat* The Sultan has directed that he should be succeeded in the Wilayat by his son. Eisbt .between the PCPPle of Ibri and Beni Ghaflr . Information has been received that what seems to have been a large battle for modern Oman took place between the people of the town of Ibri and the Beni Ghafir. It is said that 30 of the former and 10 of the latter were killed in this fight at Taka near wadi Sahtan and that included in the dead casualties were the son and the nephew of the Shaikh of Hamra and Ahmad bin Said, brother of the Qadhi of Sohar. The hostility which brought about this action was apparently generated by a series of petty thefts committed by each side against the other. Theft of Muscat Lew camels . 83.

It is apparent that recent counter measures Against Beduin insolence and aggressiveness at Masirah have disturbed the stomach of Omani thence from day to day rumours come rumbling the products of endless windy talx, ^'tending great movements. Nothing of the kind has so far eventuated. It seems possible that, in accordance with ;.rab custom, retaliation for our shootings may be taxon by an attempt or attempts to kill one or more of cur personnel at Ras al Hadd or Masirah but that this can be avoided by continued watchfulness and a display of force.

Some of these became involved in a fracas with one of the Sultan’s guards in which the latter was disarmed an I beaten; two shots were fired, by whom it is not clear. Rearing reprisals from the i Sultan’s men 200 Aden coolies took refuge with the Americans certain of whom went to the scene with their rifles. On hearing cf the incident the Sultan was sc disturbed that he personally visited the Assistant Political A^cnt at the aerodrome and had arrested the four Aden coolies who were involved in the original ' struggle. Ultimately the Sultan agreed to hand over those four men to the Assistant Political urgent for repatriation to Aden.

The difficulties of unloading ships at nasirah Island have been detailed repeatedly in these summaries. These came to a head recently. No unloading facilities other than the boats owned by the local Beduin at Masirah Island have been provided in spite of frequent requests that they should be, and time and again, the owners of these boats have exacted exhorbitant terms as a return for badly given service. Unloading ol the K.T. Jaladurga which took place at the end of December was merely a repetition of a tale oft-told. This ship was shmrt of^co'U and in a hurry to proceed; amongst her c rgo +o unj^cxUtd she had heavy transport for whose unloading o.*e dhows were unsuitable; bad weather intervened further to delay operations; the officer in charge of the unloading w s at his wits ends to get it done, while the Beduin boatmen realizing lully the position took every advantage of it by raising; + heir terms and making everything as difficult as possible in~the multifarious ways which only those who have experience of them can envisage. On this occasion however the Beduin went further than previously. They started stealing and ah attempt w ,s made te place armed guards on their boats. They then refused to do any unloading if they were guarded. On their terms unloading was finished with the result that it was discovered that they ha u stolen Rs 6800 worth of supplies and provisions. eff orts on the part of the Assistant political Agent ph Political Agent, Baiyid Shahab bin Faisal, who visited the Jocund, and the Sultan by letter from Dhof r, failed durin; the peiijd of three weeks to recover any appreciable proportion of th. stolen goods by negotiations. Further emboldended by the fctilure of these, one of the local Shaikhs on the Island threatened with shooting the Muscat coolies if they continued to w-^rk for the Royal ..ir Force. Counter measures to this Ihre ;t were promptly taken. The Political Agent authorized a Company 3appers and Miners to disarm all Arabs within the camp area and to arrest ane believed to be an instigator of the thefts'. These measures were satisfactorily carried cut on the 21st January. 72 rifles, many daggers and ammunition belts were sieze^. One Beduin was shot and believed killed while resisting and five huts encroaching on the camp area were burnt down. The Political ngent visited the Uultan after these events and informed him of them. With his approval, the arrested man travelT ed by aeroplane and launch to Muscat with the Political Agent ;nl is now lodged in prison at Muse t during the Sultan's pleasure, with the arms and ammunition siezed he•is a hostage for the future good behaviour of the Beduin ,f Masirah. The failure to provide at least alternative unloading arrangements has reached its logical conclusion. The issue at Masirah is not now whether services can be obtained from the 1 c il inhabitants but whether the measures taken against them will ensure the security of our commitments there from damage by them. So far they seem to have achieved this but it is too soon to pronounce with certainly. PROCLAILJ 1 ION DAY.

Royal Air Force Headquarters, Aden, now propose to make a flying boat base at Ras Raisut the more or less sheltered anchorage . i UI described at paragraph 88 of Intelligence Summary No. 8. The Sultan is fully co-operating. — (to). MASIRAH. Stoppage of Work . 217. On the 28th of September three hundred coolies at Masirah ♦ stopped work. This was to be expected* They were sent there in the beginning of June last and clearly announced their intention of only working for four months. Of this the Garrison Engineer was fully aware two months ago and was again urged, as was his Headquarter to get arrangements made for unloading ships at Masirah. No I arrangements were made, with the result that those responsible for sending the ships are now holding them up while 300 coolies engaged by the Political Agent are impatiently waiting for transport to Masirah to relieve those who have stopped work. They could be sent by dhows but this would be expensive and probably the journey would take £s long as two weeks. (c) RAS-AIi-HADD. (i)« Shooting of a thief . 218. On the 22nd of September the Political Agent received a wireless signal through the Royal Air Force,Muscat, purporting to be from Ras-al-Hadd and stating that H extensive Arab had been caused there by the shooting of an Arab by a sentry; it added that the Indian fitters and other artisans had fled. At this time neither the Political Agent nor the Royal Air Force, Muscat, were aware that any wireless transmitter existed at Ras-al-Hadd. On the next day the Political Agent with S&amp;lyid Shahab, theMinister for External Affairs, and Major Hirst, Commandant of the Muscat Infantry and Military Adviser, left for Ras-al-Hadd, in the- State launch, the only transport available since the Agency launch is chronically out of action. The State launch y ift. view of the somewhat alarming wording of the signal received, carried three machine guns and their crews. Ras-al-Hadd was reached on the morning of the 24th September, the previous night having been spent at Sur in order to enable Saiyid Shahab to obtain information as to ^^hat really had happened. The facts of the incident were as follows *- On the night of the 17th September a Pioneer Corps sentry • on the dump where ammunition and other materials are stored saw two men sitting on the covered pit where small arms ammunition is buried. He c hall eng-id them and one of them fired. He then fired himself and the second man replied with one shot. Both men then ran away. The sentry then knelt down, steadied his rifle, and let off nine round® at the retreating men. He killed one of them. Next morning there was of course excitement amongst the coolies and other work people, but the ’’extensive Arab unrest' was a pardonable exaggeration on the; part of Mr. Moore, the Assistant Engineer in charge, who sent off the signal to me from the Royal Air Force wireless station established at Ras-al-Hadd a few days before. The greatest unrest seems to hava existed in the minds of the Indian fitters and other artisans who fled and came to Muscat. It looks as if, either with their passion for histrionics they gave in to fear, or they seized this excuse to escape from the rigours rf work at Ras-al-Hadd. Though of course an incident of this type might lead to considerable difficulties it was handled by the local authorities in such a way as to avoid their likelihood. The dead man was a member of the Mushaykh section of the Beni Bu Hassan tribe and, on hearing of the killing, the Wali of Sur arranged with the Sheikh of the Beni Bu Hassan that in accordance with the honoured Arab custom he should take no action in respect of the incident for six months. Saiyid Shahab then warned the Sheikhs of the predominant neighbouring- tribes that their tribesmen wopld in future enter Ras-al-Hadd aerodrome area on their own risk. His opinion, v/hich is worth following in such matters, is that since the main responsibility for his death is on the man who was killed it is up to his tribesmen to make the next move in the matter if they so wish The Minister for External Affairs did not miss the opportunity of pointing out that the haphazard way in which stores and other valuable materials are thrown aboutthe aerodrome area is an invitation to steal. With this the Political Agent had no alternative but to agree and he has addressed the appropriate authority accordingly and made arrangements for those on the spot to take such actionss in within their power. He also arranged with Saiyid Shahab for the provision of more local guards on the aerodrome area and for a much needed definition of their duties. It is hoped that the British authorities stationed at Ras-al-Hadd will co-operate with and make use of them. In one important respect this incident must be regarded as fortunate. It has shown in the clearest possible manner that our army guards mean business and it is a warning to local beduins that they may exoect to pay dearly for their depredations. The enthusiastic, almost joyous, pilfering of stores especially during ! unloading, may now be expected to show a decrease if the least effort is made to guard them. (ii). Civil. Aviation Directorate * s Operatio ns for the Royal Air Force . ^ 219. In paragraph 204 ^fL-Intell igence Summary No. 15l it was reported that the ' Civil Aviation Directorate hope to finish the bitumen runways by the end of this month. The runways are now finished but they still need an upper dressing of bitumen called 'seal coating', but this cannot be put on until the runways have _ hardened sufficiently to take it and benefit from it. This hardening will take about six weeks and while it is going on Mr.3 isc&gt; i I-7$ I \Jrw y i ‘Moore, the Assistant Executive Engineer in charge of the runways, is being sent on badly needed leave. On his return he will carry out the seal coatingo (ii:.). Reval Air For ce Operations . 220 6 lii Syite of th^ fact that the runways are not fully ready the Royal Air Force have found it necessary to use Ras-al-Hadd as an ^operational base from the 1st of October onwards. (iv), Buil din g s for the Royal Air Force . 221. Buildings for the Royal Air Force operational personnel are still to be put up. Captain Hunter, the Garrison engineer, Masirah, has visited Ras-al-Hadd to make plans for doing this. At the same time the Chief Engineer. 201 Base, Basrah has sent down a corporal with a cargo of ,v ballies ?t in a dhow from Basrah. The dhow has not yet arrived and is probably having operational difficulties since prevailing winds in the present season are up the Gulf. THE ROYAL AI R FORC E, MUSCAT . 222. The Political Agent has received a complaint flrom the Musctu State about the conduct of pilots of the Royal Air Force and of one in particular, using the Muscat aerodrome. The complaint states that in order to give tlu Levy guard at the aerodrome time to clear it, the Royal Air Force pilots agreed to circle twice before landing and that they do not do so. Secondly, the complaint continues, when Squadron Leadej^ Faulkard landed on the 19th of September he refused to put his machine in the recognised parking place, ordered about the Levy guard over whom he has no authority, and finally commandeered the Levy lorry to drive him to Muscat. If these complaints are correct then they are justified. Clearing of the aerodrome by the Muscat Infantry and their provision of guards for R.A.F. machines is done by courtesy of the Sultan; he receives no consideration for doing so. STRIKE OF THE MX CAT IN FANTRY, 223. On their return from Ras-al-Hadd after the incident described in paragraph 218, the Political Agent, the Minister for External Affairs, and the Military Adviser (here stated in the reverse order of their concern with the matter) were greeted with the news that the Muscat Infantry had g^ne on strike. The detachment in Muscat town itself was mounting guard but those at the Levy Head quarters at Bait-al-Falaj refused to work unless they were paid Rs. 30/- per mensem and given 2 lbs. of atta per day. The causes of this strike seen to be the same as those of almost of everything else nowadays, viz. high prices, difficulty in obtaining foodstuffs, and the spectacle of others drawing higher pay. The immediate cause was the publication of the order of the Minister for External Affairs that with effect from October 1 st the men of the Muscat Infantry were to be paid Rs. 25/- and issued with no rations instead of receiving a smaller amount of pay with rations. To this must be added the fact that a large number of the Muscat Infantry are Baluchis from Mekran and they believe justifiably it seems that the Royal Aii Force Levies being enlisted at Gwadur are being paid better then thec^, issued with free rations and clothing, and receive other advantages following from recruitment of a force run on British lines. With less justification they also believe that they can earn easy money *$ coolies on the Southern Arabian Air Route. For four days the strike went on while the Military AdviseV explored means of reaching a settlement which would be acceptable tc the men and to the State. This was difficult since on the one hand the demands made, though extreme, were not wholly without justification, and complete rejection of them would probably have le£ to a dissolution of the force; while on the other hand the State wa^ determined to avoid by every means possible the slightest increase in expenditure on the Levies. In the result the men were offered Rs.4 22/- and two measures of rice per day. The majority ofi Mekranis rejected this offer and 93 of them and 26 men from Muscat were .— discharged. The rest of the force accepted the proposal. There shortage of recruits to replace those discharged and the strike and subsequent negotiations were conducted in an orderly manner. prompting from Major Hirst, the Military Adviser, to make a definite &gt;*ffer to the men and to take definite action against those who .ejected it. „ - v Jemadar Saiyid Tarik the Sultan's German educated half bro who featured in the incident reported at paragraph 152 of these 5”7^ Summaries, is said to have had a hand in encouraging the striker#* THE SURVIVORS OF S.S. ,t HAH S SFIELD tt . by a submarine about 50 miles off the island of Socotra on her wayi without cargo, from Aden to Colombo. Two torpedoes were fired, the first missed and the second hit amidships. The ship began to sink rapidly and orders were given to abandon her. They were executed with difficulty in a heavy sea which incidentally made it impossible to see the submarine which had delivered the torpedoes. Finally, four boats got away after two of them had been cut away from jammed falls. It is thought that all the ship's complement were in these boats. As the; moved away in the dusk, the submarine shelled the sinking ship. She was the property of the I itish India Steam Navigation Company. Darin the night, the four boats parted company. Indian crew of the ,, Harosfilild ,! who were landed at Matrah from an Arab dhow on the 19th of September, Their life boat was blown under sail by the South Western monsoon in a direction roughly parallel to the South Arabian coast for four days. They survived the arduous journey very well though one of the engineers was still shaken from tnc. effect of the torpedoes 1 explosion. They were greatly impressed wixn the good treatment offered them by the Nakhuda of the dhow. He was suitably rewarded by the British India Steam Navigation Company's agents here. Muscat on the 30th September, They had a more trying time than the first. They were ten days in oheir life boat before they landed on the south coast apparem^ly near Has* ' Sauqireh about half way between Masirah and Salalah. They were twenty of them, four British, and the rest Indians and Goans and they were short of water and food. The inhabitants of the coast where they landed have an exceedingly evil reputation for their treatment of ship wrecked sea-farers but in this case they did not justify it. After bargaining, they agreed to send the survivors of the 'Karesf ield n by dhow to Ras-al-Hadd for the • sum of Rs. 200/- which the Chief ' Officer was fortunate in having with him. The party arrived at Ras-al-Hadd on the 28th of September and were brought up here by motor launch. Presumably the Arabs brought them to Ras-al-Hadd and not to Masirah in order that they might have to pay more for the longer journey. They knew nothing of Masirah. There were no casualties amongst ther\ sailed straight to Karachi and, if this is true it may be added to the long war list of stout hearted achievements by small numbers. The fourth of the , 5 Haresfield M boats, the Captain's boat, has not been beard of. It appears that Saiyid Shahab was only Induced by constant 224 On the oth of September the S.S.

The third of the M Haresfield n boats is reported to have5 BEDOUIN RAID ON A CARAVAN &gt; 225. The Awamir Bedouin customarily visit Ibri, one of the largest towns in Oman. As might be expected their object is, crudely Speaking, to feed at the expense of the inhabitants, or as the Arab euphemism has it, to favour them with an opportunity of displaying their hospitality. Last month the people of Ibri became indifferent to ^his ^f^vour. The Awamirs decided to leave but determined to make the &gt;wns people appreciate their view as to how relatione stood between them. Accordingly they warned the Wall in ominous terms that *if any harm were done to the country by them , they should not be blamed for it M ♦ Equivocal as this sounds the argument is clearly i«* 'Bedouins have a right to raid. They must receive consideration to forego iV 1 • This was pointed without delay. After their departure the Awamirs met a caravan going from Ibri to Dubai for the purchase of merchandise there. They attacked it, killed three men and robbed the caravan of # 1,600/-. Two of the men killed were belonging to Ibri and the third, a camel driver, was of the Beni Qatab tribe. DEATH OF THE WALI OF RUSTAQ . 226. Hilal bin Ali bin Bedr, Wall of Hustaq, brother of the Wall of Sur, died in this month. It is rumoured that after 'Id the Imam will pay a visit to Rustaq to appoint a new Wall. SUBMARINE IN THE GULF OF OMAN . 227. There has recently risen again the rumour apparently with more foundation this time, that a submarine is operating in the Gulf of Oman. It is also stated that the Axis radio has broadcast that their submarines are so operating. THE DIEPPE RAJD . 228. Some local opinion favours the Axis lie that the Dieppe raid was an attempt at the invasion of the continent of Europe. ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AT SUR . 229. While Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal was at Sur in connection with the incident reported in paragraph 218 he received complaints that the Hindu merchants there were overcharging. •Unlfcimately he established that the complainants were Arabs dealing a large way, who them selves were guilty of what they complained of. COMMERCTAT.. 230. Four steamers called at Muscat during the period under report and landed 211 tons of cargo, of which 17 tons were rice and 19 tons were wheat-flour. Exports during the period amounted to 756 tons of which 734 tons were dates. FOOD-STOCKS AND PRICES . Stocks. Rice - 14 weeks' supply. Wheat and wheat-flour - 1 week's supply.

As reported in paragraph 109 of Muscat Intelligence ^ S umma ry No. 9 the incursion of Pan American Airways into Salalah took, place two months ago. They have since left, but the evil that they did lived after them. Their arrival and stay without warning and without the Sultan's consent was responsible for his somewhat tiresome insistence on his Treaty right to the search and declaration of all baggage, even of that belonging to through passengers, on R.A.F. aircraft* The Sultan's argument was clearly that, though Pan American Airways did not evade his customs they might easily have done so; therefore the R.A.F. might do so* even though it is obvious that the likelihood of their carrying any goods dutiable under the Treaty, is exceedingly remote# It was probably the emergence of this fact and not the nuisance which they occasioned R.A.F. personnel and his own customs staff which induce! the Sultan to waive his profitless formalities. This he did after discussions with the Assistant Political Agent. The general lese-on is that an instantaneous hardening of attitude may be expected fi 009 the Sultan in exact proportion to any infringement of his rights, (b) Masirah (ate Ras«al-Hadd) Works. 204. Squadron Leader Cooper and Major Binnie called to see tk* Political Agent on the 4th September on their way to inspect the aerodromes at Masirah and Ras-al-Hadd. Squadron Leader Cooper from the office of the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Iraq. He. explained that the works at Masirah and Ras-al-Hadd were under V\i charge of the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Iraq but that as he had not sufficient staff he was having the works done through Agency of Chief Engineer 201, Bases, Basrah. He added that Major Binnie was from the office of the latter. While as reported in paragraph 160 of Muscat Intelligence Summary No. 12, Air Headquart*^Iraq? have taken over charge at Masirah they have sent no staff to Ras-al-Hadd as yet. There, Mr. Moore, the Civil Aviation Directorate Engineer from India hopes to finish the Bitumen runways by the end of this month. Civil Aviation Directorate's interest in Kas-al-Hadd will then cease. (c) Has -al-Hadd . Tribal i nvasi on- 205. On the 5th September the Political Agent received a report that two Shaikhs of the Beni bu Ali tribe with a number of their followers had come to Ras-al-Hadd and were behaving in a threatening manner. Mr. Moore, the Engineer in charge, informed the Wall of Sur who arrived quickly with about 300 supporters. No trouble developed and the time seems to have been spent in talking and eating at the expense of the Civil Aviation Directorate. Considerable credit is due to Mr. Moore for the tact he displayed on this and several other occasions in dealing with local people and for the good relations he has established with them and wi mi his labour, nil the more is this due since kr. Moore has been working alone in the harsh climate and grim environment of Ras-al-Hadd for the last seven months. UNREST AT SIB. 206.

On the 9th of September Saiyid Shau^b, the Minister for External affairs telegraphed about this to His Highness the Sultan at Dhofar stating that the Wall of Sib was getting help from his father, the ex Wall of Musannah, who had gone to the interior. Three days later, Saiyid Shahab telegraphed that the trouble was over, the dispute between the V/ali and the Awamirs having been ended by the mediation of Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Khalili.

It is therefore clear that speed is iio longer the essence of the operations at Has al Hadd and Masirah. Dhow transport is not inefficient but of course dependent on the vagaries of wind and weather* As i'or labour, not even his most fervent partisan, if such there be, could maintain that the Muscat labourer whether skilled or unskilled is a fast worker, Should building operations extend- at Has al Hadd or Masirah it will be impossible to depend on further supplies of local labour of any kind. Practically all the resources of any value have been fully drawn upon, HIS HBINE3S THD SULTVJi . 26d. His Highness the oultan f s stay in India was reported in paragraph 257 of the last summary.

In r^Ply to ;.n other question from Saiyid oh ah a b the Sultan merely referred him to the Finance Officer, The indications are that oaiyid ohahub’s way of living has embarrused him financially, pe has recently been indisposed ana somewhat bad t^Lipered. LOCAL AFFAIRS . &lt;^1« ^ It appears that one of the reasons why the PrwSiaont ol the Muscat Municipality asked the suit m that the Municip..-. 1 Engineer should be discharged (as referred to at par--.graph 259 1 is that the Municipal Committee is unable to fine. 1 ibour for i'ts works due to the demand made on Muscat labour by the southern Arabian air route* In reply to the President the Sultan told hvm that he should obtain the views of the committee regarding the termination of the Municipal Lngin^er’s contract.

Indeed, during the peri when it was being received elsewhere it penetrated to one pl 4 c on the whole Batinah Coast. This was Khasab whose Wali posses a wireless receiver. In Muscat as elsewhere in the Arab worl the news cheered our friends and confounded those who were not with us. One of the most notorious British Indian merchants L made a request to the Political Agent that a personal telegram congratulations should bu sent from him (the merchant) to Alexander.

The Wall was wholly within his rights as the R.A.F. have themselves agreed to the Sultan’s ruling forbidding the flying of all flags, other/wind/? indicators, on the aerodromes. It is understood that on £he L Medical Officer’s referring the matter to Air Headquarters, ^dun, they supported the V/ali’s action.

The Wali of Sohar left fi&gt;r Dhahira on the 5th November t.c investigate some cases of theft which had occurred there. The Muscat Government gave him Rs. 500 to enable him to conduct his investigations. HIS HIGHNESS THE SULTAN . 257. The Sultan is still in I^dia* During his tour referred to in paragraph 246 of this summary the Political ngent was questioned in aevery Wilayai as to the movements of the Sultan _.nd especially as to when he would return to Muscat. Some of the more outspoken spirits expressed openly the general feeling that the Sdltan*s place is in Muscat* idb the moment, while affairs are quiet* this feeling is unlikely to lead to anything more serious friUtS than its open expression; but it may have serious results- should political or economic conditions gfavely deteriorate in 0 an. THE DATE CROPLAND MARKET * 258* The Batinah and Oman date crop has been phenomenally good this year. Added to this the demand for these dates and consequently the prices have been better than ever in previous years* This is largely thanks to the fact that the Iraq Government has forbidden the expoft of its own dates and those from Muscat have found a ready market in India in consequence. One of the most prominent Indian merchants here told the Political Agent that in 25 years thefe had never been such a crop and such high prices. These fortunate circumstances have done much to mitigate the likelihood of unrest in Oman as a result of the increased cost of all commodities. LOCAL AFFAIRS . 259.

This undoubtedly causes hardship to those, like the ikgency staff, with rupee incomes. The cost to them of every day articles of consumption, whose prices are not controlled, has nearly trebled in some cases. Nevertheless it is not possible to credit many of the wild asservations which have beei made regarding the increase in the cost of living. The prices the staple commodities are nominally controlled though it is usually asserted that the poor class of people are not sold to the controlM prices. Nevertheless not a single specific comiii t has ever been made to the Political i^ent of a breach of tht regulation imposing the price control. By contrast the Politi .A Agent has been told by one merchant the he knows of cases where officials of the Muscat Government have used their position to tuy at the controlled rate and to hold supplies for a rise in price. This state of affairs may be fairly general and, if so, indicates a possible reason why no specific complaints of breaches of the control regulation are brought forward. large swarms of yellow locusts were pouring in to Gwadur.

Mr, G.N. Jackson, Assistant Political Agent at Salalah visited Muscat on the 13th October. He had travelled to Ras-al-Hadd by air and from there came to Muscat in the State launch which was sent for him. He left Muscat on the evening of his arrival by H.T. “Barjora' *n the way to Masirah. THE KARACHI-ADEN AIR ROUTE * (a) . SALALAH. 236. Roval Air Force . Mr. Jackson reported complaints by His Highness the Sultan at Salalah that the Royal Air Force there had not been ebserving his local rules, particularly those obliging them to take a guard with them whenever they leave the aerodrome limits and forbidding smoking in certain areas. The Indian proverb that ‘tyou can*t clap with one hand 1 ’ is examplified here since there are counter complaints from the Royal Air Force of discourtesy shown to them by the Sultan s guards. The truth seems to be that the inhabitants of Dhofar have been taught to regard the Sultan and him only, as the person on whom their welfare, even their existence, depends, and accordingly as the person to whom only respect is due. Not unnaturally the Sultan wishes to preserve this attitude. It seems inevitable, however, that it must itself become modified by the impjringement on it of western ways and that the effort to preserve Dhofar as an oasis of medievalism is doomed. The greater part of the friction between the Royal Air Force and the Sultan’s men seems to be but a symptom of this process. Air Vice-Marshal Hards, Air Officer Commanding, Aden, visited Salalah recently and expressed regret to the Sultan that there had been trouble between his men and the Sultan’s subjects. (b) . MASIRAH. 237 . Transport of new coolies . The 300 new coolies mention ed in paragraph 217 of my last Intelligence Summary were transported to Masirah by H.T. ’’Barjora” on the 13th October. Stringent orders had to be issued to them not to damage their life belts. Previously they used to cut and pilfer the strings. The ’’Barjora 11 was needed urgently and was not able to evacuate the old lot of coolies from Masirah. 56 of them could not wait for the ship’s transport which has been promised and they left in two dhows for Muscat. They arrived here in a very exhausted condition with hardly any clothing. Out of 350 coolies sent to Masirah in June last it is reported that 8 died from disease. 40 were in hospital during the period under report and the majority of them are said to have lost condition and to have found that the climate, which Europeans find good, did not agree with them.

About eight months ago men of the Awamir tribe living near Sib found on the foreshore the mast of a wrecked boat said to be ,ort about Rs. 400. The Wali of Sib, hearing of this, told the Awamirs that they should hand the mast over to him. They replied that God h, .. sent them the mast and quite obviously believed that this intervention of the Almighty operated to defeat the ordinary right of rulers articles cast by the sea on their shores. The Wali then complained x, the Minister for Internal Affairs, who, as his colleague for External Affairs put it,'played on three ropes'. He professed himself as not concerned while he told the Wali that he should seize the mast ana t Awamirs that their claim to it was just. Nothing of note th^n happened for several months until, in the fortnight under review, the Awamirs decided to take the mast to Muscat. The Wali then sent ior the son of one of their headman, Ali bin Salem, on the pretence of dcm r accounts with him; when he got him in his power he imprisoned him. He also captured the mast. In reply, the Awamirs gathered in force at Sub and demanded the release of Ibr Alx Vn Salem. Tension was furtner increased when, at the request of one of the headmen of Sib, the She-M. of Khodh, under the Imam of Oman, came with his men to guard the market stating that it was under his protection. The Wali increased his forces by a posse of 45 men sent by his father, the Wali of Musev, Negotiations were then opened and resulted in the release of Ibn Ali bin Salim by the Wall, and the mast of contention being put in the custody of one Sheikh Salem bin Abdullah, who is the Sunni Qadhi of Muscat 4 The situation is now reported to be quiet.

The Political Agent left Muscat for Masirah by H*T• l, BarJofra ,, on August the 6th hoping to join the B.O.A.C* aircraft at MaiiMh qpd travel in it to Salalah on August the 8th* The “Barjora* despite the fact that she had a heavy launch to tow to Ras«al-Hadd and acne cargo to unload there f made good time, and arrived at Masirah at &amp; a.m. on August the 8th, She stood off the island in a high wind ana choppy sea. No boats came to her from the shore; none were avail* able; and wind and tide made it impossible for the ship^ lefehoat# to be sailed or rowed to the island. The Political Agent thus had the tantalising experience of watching from the deck of the ship tls* B,0,A,C. aircraft which was to take him to Salalah land at Maslrdii at 10 o'clock, re-fuel, and take off again. Later, when the tide had turned, he landed from one of the ship’s lifeboats* The journey from Masirah to Salalah was accomplished in a 'Vincent” aircraft iM six hours at an average ground-speed of 70 miles per hour. All the flying was done against the monsoon wind and in heavy mist| and some of it through thick cloud which finally forced the pilot to come down low and follow the white surf breaking on the cliff face, the most visible object in a desolate, damp scene. The return journey on August the 13th was made from Salalah to Masirah in a D.C.3 machine, by the courtesy of the United States Army Air Corps* It took two hours and forty minutes. Prom Masirah the Political Agent travelled by the Vincent aircraft to Muscat calling at Raa-al-Hadd en route. While at Salalah the Political Agent was the guest of His Highness the Sultan. TBS..KARACHI-AJDEN AIR BOUTS . (a). Salalah . (i)- The weather for flying . 172. To the south as well as to the north of Salalah conditions for flying are stated to be as reported in the preceding paragraph of2 , «■ *• this Summary. One method discussed of helping aircraftto find the aerodrome in the mist, was to direct them by W/T to fly along the coast until they saw a rocket fired on it by a waiting airman^ and then to turn right or left according to whether they were on their way to Aden or to Karachi. Suspiciously simple as this sounds to ears attuned to the discussion of flying technicalities, it does however indicate the nature of the problem. (ii) . The Royal Air Force and the United States Arpr Air Corps . 173. Wing Commander Hanlon of Aden Command informed the Assistant Political Agent on August the 6th that Air Headquarters, Aden, consider it essential that Salalah should be a Royal Adr Force station under the single command of a Royal Air Force officer, who would administer the United States Army Air Corps personnel there through the senior American officer present. The Royal Air Force intend eventually to send a Squadron Leader to coj***- ^and the combined detachments. The Wing Conmander left for Karachi, from where the United States Army Air Corps personnel in Salalali were posted originally, to take up the question with the United States Army Air Corps. (iii) . Petrol for re-fuelling aircraft . 174. There are now over six hundred thousand gallons of aviation spirit at Salalah, available for aircraft in dumps and stores near the aerodrome. As noted in paragraph 88 of Intelli gence Summary No. 8, a large quantity of this was landed ten miles away at Has Raisut. When the Political Agent, as Assistc- l Political Agent, was in Salalah, he inquired whether the herds oJr grazing camels seen in quantities in Dhofar could not be used to move the petrol to the aerodrome, there being no other transport available. He was told that those camels were kept for their milk only and could not be used to carry loads. Subsequently the Royal Air Force offered a fixed sum of money for a fixed number of cases of petrol carried from Raisut to the Salalah aerodrome. The response to this was immediate and complete.Bull-camels, females and even foals were pressed in to service. Children so small that they had to be lifted on their loaded mounts were sent out with donkeys to help their fathers to earn more dollars, same camels died as a result^the ioads they were forced to carry due to the cupidity of their owners. Several had their skins badly burnt by the high octane spirit leaking from broken cases. There is now no more petrol left on the beaches. (iv) . British Overseas Airways Corporation . 175. The British Airways staff at Salalah have given up living in their quarters in the coconut grove on the moisture sodden Salalah beach which, in fairer weather, waft coripafred by the fanciful to Waikiki. They now live in the less damp atmosphere of the aero drome . ( v ) • Increased circu lation of money . 176. Thanks to the wages they receive for Royal Air Force work* the poorer class in Salalah has now more money than it has ever seen before. They are thus able to afford rice to eat where previously they had to be content with millet grain. They have also shown a wish to purchase other luxuries. The sad irony of the situation is that now that they have the money it looks as if neither the rice nor the luxuries will be available to them. Already rice is rationed in the Salalah bazaar, no more than a fixed quantity being allowed for sale each day. (vi) . H is H ighness the Sul tan. 177. For the same reason as British Airways (paragraph 175 above His Highness the Sultan has deserted his house on the beach and now lives in tents near a shooting-box which he is building some six mile inland. His Highness seems to take considerable interest in the development of the Dhofar province 1 s irrigation and the agriculture dependent on it. He has the construction of new water eourses in hand. His interest ought to show results for water in Dhofar is abundant and there are vast stretches of what looks to be good, culturable soil.

(i)* Unl oading . The Political Agent had made no allowances for the inscrutable ways of those who direct ships when he wrote in para- graph 12? of Intelligence Su mma ry No. 1 0 that the attempt of the •hipe to beat the monsoon to Masirah had ended. The unloading deeeribed tn the paragraph just quoted had been accomplished with much effort, tumult and shouting. The captains of ships departed determined to inform those who direct their destines of the difficulties they had undergone. The Political Agent told their story separately, Yet the 'Barjora 1 - (paragraph 171) was sent to Masirah, over 200 miles off her course to Karachi, with orders to unload 14 sheep, 30 drume of water and a few miscellaneous packages. The orders were not carrt* out and, as explained in the first paragraph of this Summary, could not have been carried out. This should have been obvious to whoevor routed the ship* , i~• Brit i sh Over s eas Airways C orporation • 179. After a complaint from the British Overseas Airways Corporut-ione ,.p° Ta tors at Masirah that the Royal Air Force personnel et Masirah had usurped the British Overseas Airways Corporation’s dormitory and that the British Overseas Airways Corporation's staff had consequently to undergo considerable inconvenience, the Regional Manager of the British Overseas Airways Corporation at Karachi sent Mr. Pointer, who was lately Station Superintendent at Salalah, to enquire. Even at Masirah the ill-defined relations between the Royal Air Force and the British Overseas Airways Corporation seem to run true to form* (iii).

(iv). Coolie Killed . 181. An Indian driver of one of the Garrison Engineer's lorries at Masirah ran down and killed one of the Baluch coolies from Muscat. Fortunately Mr. Jackson, the Assistant Political Agent, arrived in time to make an enquiry and to pacify the two brothers of the c victim of the accident, who showed great grief, possibly in part to justify their openly expressed minatory intentions towards the driver. Saiyid Shahab, the Minister for External Affairs, expressed the belief that the grief and intentions would disappear after the payment of compensation fixed by him with the Political Agent. One cause of the accident is the lack of brakes on the Masirah lorries due to want of brake lining. (c). Ras-al-Hadd . k Civil Aviation D irec torate's o perati ons for the Royal Air Force. 182. Reference paragraph No. 164 of Intelligence Summary Mo, 12 in which some complaints against the conduct of the officers fetal a** of the platoon of the Indian Pioneer Corps at Ras-al**Hadd were reported. Flying Officer Gilbert was deputed by Air Headquarters# ’Iraq, to • \ take the statement of the Jemadar commanding the platoon. He did so, in the presence of the Political Agent. dte Jemadar wholly denied that either he or his men had beaten Dr. Xsaao#. BIDQ BINT NASIB . 183. Reference paragraph No. 165 of Intelligence Summary No. 13 of 1942, which featured Bido bint Nasib the alleged slave woman of Hie Highness the Sultan's mother. It may be remembered that the Political Agent referred this young person's case for manumission to His Highness the Sultan. Hi* Highness replied that she was no slave but a free woman. The Miniat. for External Affairs again pressed for her delivery to him to answer the charge of theft. He was told that at a stated hour she would be expelled through the Agency gate. She was, under pressure, and the6 n a Minister's men took her away. It might well be thought that tha Mj^eet Government, with its experience in these matters would have then found case easy to handle. It did not. With the regrettable disregarc of her sex, where their own interests are concerned, for propriety in the conduct of affairs, Bido insisted on implicating the young eon of Saiyid Abbas, rhe Sultan's uncle, in the charge of theft against herself. It was obviously out of the question to arraign the young Saiyid as a thief, so the Minister, acting indeed as any reasonable man would do in the like circumstances, filed the charge against Bido and let her go her way. She is now employed as a cook, it is said t by a Khoja in Matrah. A reference to paragraph 166 of Intelligence Summary No. 12 will indicate that fate seems ultimately to have dealt fairly with the Khoja and with Bido. MEASURE S_ AGAIN ST, PROFITEERING e !S4, Following many complaints of profiteering the Sultan*a Representative held two meetings during the period under review, whlefc were attended by six British Indian and six local merchants. At the first of these Saiyid Shahab ropndly accused the merchants 3 . (a) of hording, and (b) of not selling wheat and wheat-flour at the controlled prices. He informed them that the prices fixed by the Control Committee allo^t 1 them a nett profit of 10%. He asked them to abide by these prices SV&gt; ' stated that if they did not the State would take over all stocks of these two commodities in the Customs woxehouses and would make their c vn arrangements for retailing them. The merchants ;;ere given a week to reply to this ultimatum. As they were unable or unwilling to come tc satisfactory agreement, Saiyid Shahab informed them at the second meet ing that the State would take over all stocks in the Customs warehouses and make its own arrangements for sale to the public. The merchants., were allowed a profit of 15%. So far there have been no complaints against the working of this ukase. THE DATE TR ADE. 185. On the 14th a circular telegram addressed to all date exporters in Muscat was received from the All Merchants Association in Bombayadvising them to stop shipment of dates owing to tha lack of for them in India, ' HOARDING OF BAD STOCKS » 186. The President of the Municipality has approached the Political Agent for permission to search the godowns of British Indian merchants who are believed to hold large stocks of wheat-flour which is old and unfit for human consumption. The Political Agent anxious to keep his Treaty rights of jurisdiction over British subjects unimpaired has informed the President that he is prepared to accede to the Municipality^ request but that a search warrant shoulu be obtained in each case from him. He has also advised him to get the Quarantine Medical Officer to condemn stocks before they are destroyed. EXPO RT OF GH EE. 187.

Civil Aviation Directorate*a Operations for the Royal Air Forge . , 164* On July 25th, Mr. A.E.G. Moore, Assistant Executive2 Engineer, Ras-al-Hadd, arrived at Muscat with complaints against the conduct of the platoon of the Indian Pioneer Corps at Ras-al-Hadd. In one instance he reported that Dr. Isaacs of the Civil Aviation Directorate was beaten by the Jemadar, who commands the platoon, and by his men and produced statements made by Dr. Isaacs and two witnesses. There was another complaint from the Assistant Wali at Ras-al-Hadd of the maltreatment of Muscat coolies by the officers and men of the platoon. The Political Agent left immediately for Ras-al-Hadd to make enquiries. His launch engine failed on the return journey, 30 miles from Muscat. This distance was covered in an 8-foot dinghy in ten hours. BIDO BINT NAS IB . 165. Applications for manumission from slaves are on the increase in this Agency. Ordinarily they offer no problem and the human features of this humane activity can be caniklised, with the fullest propriety, into the usual channels. The same cannot be said of the case of Bido bint Nasib. She arrived at the Agency on the 18th July stating that sty? was a slave of the mother of His Highness the Sultan, and asking for a manumission certificate. She said that she had been falsely accused of the theft of money in order to buy biscuits for the small son of Saiyid Abbas, uncle of the Sultan; she had been chained&gt; beaten and left hungry and managed to escape from the house of the Sultan 1 a mother at night. In fact, she had a fetter on one leg and showed marks of beating which, she stated, had been delivered with a broom handle by other female slaves. Her case seemed pitiable ajtd the problem of what to do with her? while inquiries were made ^solved by by the kind gesture of one of the married Agency officials who allowed the young person to serve in his house. Meanwhile a reference to Saiyid Shahab, the Minister for External Affairs, elicited the reply that Bido was a servant (i.e. by implication, not a slave) and a thief. The latter accusation she quickly established as correct, crudely by stealing food at the house where she was given shelter and, more subtlely, by proposing marriage to the male servants. She had than to be taken from this house and somewhere else found for her to stay, within the Agency, while her case for manumission was referred to the Sultan at Saiyid Shahab f s (very typical) request. At this juncture, the Political Agent was forced into the role which he now ^ fills at quickly recurring intervals - that of retaining the object ^ undesired by all enlightened persons. To his embarassment and anxiety, from which all traces of pity have been evaporated, Bido now occupies the guard-room in the Agency, the only place which could be found for her to stay while her fate is being deciddd. ARSON . 166. On the evening of July 30th when all the shops in Matrah were closed, some smoke was seen emiting from the shop of one Khoja Jawad bin Salim, a Muscat subject. The watchmen informed the Wali and men were sent to summon the Khoja who could not be found at first Later when he appeared on the scene he seemed reluctant to open his shop and gave the excuse that he had lost the key. When he did opei the shop it was found that some kerosene had been sprinkled in it in an attempt to set it on fire. Nothing of any value was found inside and the iron safe yielded only Rs. 4. The gentleman, who is believ&amp;j to be heavily in debt, on enquiry, stated that he had lost Rs. 2,000/- in currency notes. He was imprisoned and released after two ^days. His behaviour seems in accord with the character given to hi* ’community, the Khojas, here. They are spoken of as dirty, avaricio^, 'mean and fraudulent. GWADUR . 167. On the 8th July the Wali informed the British Agent at .Gwadur that some boxes and other wreckage had boon washad ashore at the village of Peshkan, 12 miles west of Gwadur.

A report from the Assistant Political Agent at Salalah states that the Resident Manager of Pan American Airways informed him that he has received orders to evacuate all Pan American Airways personnel from Salalah to Karachi by the first available aircraft and to hand over all Pan American Airways 1 equipment to the Royal Air Force for eventual delivery to the United States Army Air Corps.

Neither the Royal Air Force ' W/T station,Masirah, nor the B.O.A.C. and R.A.F, W/T stations at Salalah have experienced this jamming, and the operators at Salalah think the noise heard at Masirah was probably due to faulty work while the set at Masirah was being assembled.

Sea and air communication between Muscat, Masirah and Salalnh for the purpose of correspondence is practically closed during the monsoon* Now radio communication between the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent has proved difficult at times* It was formerly by the Sultan’s set at Salalah to Cable and Wireless here. But the Sultan’s set’s weakness, always apparent, has made it more difficult for it to be heard transmitting in monsoon conditions at Muscat. B 9 O.A*Co and the R.A.F• at Salalah do help by transmitting messages in cases of urgency but neither of them keep watches with any Muscat station and messages only reach here from them after long detours. DYNAS TIC A LLIANCE. 148* The Political Agent spent the 6th July with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, the Minister for External Affairs, Muscat Government, at Sib f a date-garden on the coast about twenty-five miles from here where Saiyid Shahab has gone for a month to escape the Muscat climate. During one of the intervals from eating and sleeping during the day Saiyid Shahab said that he was only waiting for the return of the Sultan from Dhofar to get his consent to his own marriage with a daughter of Sulaiman Hamyar of the Jabal Akhdar, and that he thought such a marriage would render the Sheikh of the Jabal Akhdar less remote and aloof in his dealings with the Muscat Government. GUN FIRE A T SEA * 160* At 6-10 P.M n on the 15th July a report was received by telephone at the Agency from Bait al Falaj, the Headquarters of the Muscat Levies, that the sound of gun-fire at sea had been heard andthat it had lasted for ten minutes. The men in the look-out potft at Dar Sait, on the shore near Bait-al-Falaj, were unable to see any ships. Visibility was made difficult by misty conditions. LOCAL O FFICIALS. a6a. Major L.B. Hirst, I.A., Military Adviser to His Highnes# the Sultan went to India on the 1st July for six weeks' recess. SEPOY AMOK . 152. Before dawn on the 5th July the Political Agent was awakened by a request from the Levy guard in the Agency to mount a guard on his roof. A Muscat Levy sepoy under arrest in the 'Bait-al-Bursa 11 * a few houses from the Agency, during the night seized a rifle from hi# sleeping guards, frightened them away with four shots from it, and locked himself in the ,, Bait-al-Bu^za ,, . The guard on the roof of the Agency was one of those laying siege to the 'Bait-al-Burza'. Shortly after one of the Levy Subedars came to the Political Agent asking for a few rounds of shot-gun ammunition, which were given to him. He was told that the escaped sepoy ought to be given a chance to surrender before shooting at him. Indeed it seemed doubtful whether ha could be shot at without giving as good as he got, or better; he was in a very strong defence position and had plenty of ammunition. He surrendered to Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur, the Sultan's half-brother Md a Jemadar in the Levies, at his first demand. He did what he had done, it was stated, because of some deductions made in his pay# The Agency Medical Officer certified him as sane. The Political Agent, since no responsible representative of the Muscat Government was in Muscat, looked in at the man's court-martial before going on his way to Sib to visit Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal (Paragraph 149) and incidentally to tell him of the incident. The prisoner at the court- martial seemed to imagine that he was being persecuted and said 'From the Commandant to the Naik, they all say that everything I do is wrong.' However that may be, he seems- to have been lucky to get off with his life and with only the sentence of imprisonment which Saiyid Shahab, who came from Sib to give orders in the case, awarded him the next day. For Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur said afterwards 'If it were not for the presence of the Consulate I would have shot hi?# before he made any statement'. Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur's mother was a Turkish lady and he has had some education at Heidelberg and other centres of German culture. THE FA LL O F THE RUPEE , 153. The average dollar rate during the period under review was Rs. 177.4 for 100 Maria Theresa thalers. On the let it was Ra# 167% and on the 15th Rs. 188%. The copper Baiza (Muscat pice) has also appreciated in relation to the rupee. The average pre-war rate was 180 balsa# to a rupee, this dropped to 100 to a rupee on the 1st July and to 5 baizas to the anna or 85-88 to the rupee on the 15th. In terms of the baiza, therefore (which is the coin most used for daily purchases), the rupee is now worth little more than 7-^ annas of it# face value. This upward trend of the dollar and baiza is having an unsteadying effect on the economic life of Muscat and Matrah but its full significance will not be apparent until after the date season, when people who have migrated to the date gardens of the Batinah and Oman, return to their homes in these two towns# Currency notes are still at a discount but the rate ha# increased to 1% and occasionally notes can be changed at par. This is said to be due to the falling off of the demand for rupees from Dubai. The Committee formed at the outbreak of the war to control the prices of essential commodities is functioning satisfactorily, but of food-stuffs as only wheat, flour, rice, sugar’and lentils come within its purview, the prices of other foodstuffs are siib.iect to the upward trend of the dollar and baiza. fI SBCHET , « !

It seems very .likely that the burnt coolie was smoking. While the usual fatalistic view is taken of the accident it is now noticeable that the coolies at Ras-al-Hadd no longer cook their foed as, in spite of efforts, they were inclined to do before, within danger range of the petrol dumps. It was fortunate that the accident did so little damage. . t' ' . • • ' N * * * .4 . 131. As explosives and about 7,00,000 tins of petrol are lying on the beach at Ras-al-Hadd in dumps close to each other,the Political Agent suggested to Air Headquarters, ‘Iraq, that a staging party or at least an officer should be sent to Ras-al-Hadd with specific instructions to supervise the stacking of petrol in isolated dumps away from explo3ives. The suggestion has been accepted and an officer is expected shortly. The Political Agent on his viait to Ras-al-Hadd was fortunate in meeting there Major Taylor who with commendable alacrity and in the most co-operative way gave orders for the Pioneer Corps pin 4 &gt;on (c f.

Its source has been difficult to trace owing since both the local B*0,A.C, personnel and Mr. Mams, the B.OrAoCc representative on the. route, denied having given it. Further, B.0oA,C. buildings at Salalah are almost entirely complete It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the information msur have its origin in what the Prime Minister referred to as ♦'expressions of loose, ill-digested opinion'. 91« Whiie bathing from the Salalah beach an Indian observer of the Meteorological Department;, attached to B.CcA.C., was drowne4 # His relatives in India were informed and, as he was a Mohammedan, the Sultan arranged and had. performed a Moslem burial.

Having worked well for 3£ months the Muscat coolies at Masirah, hired by the Civil Aviation Directorate, became tired and wanted to return home. A combination of causes, the chief of which seems to have been the hard conditions/‘and) labour on the *1 °ir Island, created this feeling. There were complaints about the rations supplied. The annual urge to date picking was also in evidence. Even an offer of an increase of wages by five dollars per month failed to reduce ihe demand to be let go and arrangements were accordingly made to replace the original coolies by a fresh detach ment. 95* The high winds and waves of the approaching monsoon supply the main reason for the wish of the dhowmen at Masirah to take their boats to more sheltered waters. Mr. Jackson is seeing whether some of them at least can be induced to stay as their boats, so far, have been the only means for unloading Royal Air Force fuel, explosives and stores.

He was killed by a follower of Sheikh Abdullah bin Sa ? id of the Beni Hasan; and there was some suggest ion that his removal was not entirely repugnant to the Sultan). 192. is understood that the Sultan paid out 3,000 MariaTheresa do Hers tQ Sheikh- All Hn Abdullfh and 600 Xg JOdullah bin 3a : id. The Wall of Sur also got M.T.# 1,600 and a promise that certain debts of his in Muscat, amounting to M.T, $ 3,000, would be paid. His pay is, it is understood, to be raised from Rs, 700/- to Rs. 900/-. as the Masharifi tribe (Sheikh Nasir bin Mas’ud) are standing by the Wali. Further, the Beni Hasan sheikhs are not unanimous in their support of Sheikh Abdullah bin Sa'id. The Beni Bu Ali tribe are considerably more powerful than the Beni Hasan, a fact reflect ed in the comparative size of presents noted above $ and it is to be inferred that the Sultan intends to back them (in spite of his reported personal liking for Sheikh Abdullah bin Sa'id) with a view to their eventual assistance to him in his relations with the Imam. SHIPPINGo 194, Four steamers called' at Muscat during the period under review: and discharged 32 tons. Imports consisted of piece-goods (ll tons) and general cargo (21 tons).

LOCAL PERSONAGES . 198. Preparations for the Sultan's visit to Dhofar are in full swing. It is estimated that the value of the goods he has sent j or is sendingf there does not fall short of a lakh. These goods include medical stores, a lorry, cement,and foodstuffs. Local opinion surmises that the length of his stay there will considerably exceed the 5 or 6 months which he him self admits. 199. Two men have been found dead a little way out of Sib. The bodies were decomposed and mangled by dogs; but they are believed to have been of the Beni Kalban. The murderers are unknown} but two men of the A1 Wuhaiba have been seen going up the Wadi Sama*!! with two extra rifles. The matter was presumably the outcome of a blood feud. 200, During his recent stay in Bombay, the Sultan obtained 100,000 nickel coins from His Majesty*s Mint, These are of face value 10, 20 and 60 baizas. (The baiza is a local copper coin similar to a pice, but worth about a pie, which is used as a subsidiary coin to the Maria Theresa thaler). The coins are for circulation in Dhofar, and His Highness will take them with him on his approaching visit. The coins are handsomely struck, and of similar shape to one-, two- and four-anna pieces. On the obverse they bear the Muscat State arms and the word 'Dhofar**, and on the reverse the legend H The truster in God, Sa*id bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman'. It is learnt that His j3 (tj&amp;s) Suleiman ar~Rashood had arrived in Muscat. According to his state ment, recorded by the Inspector of Police, he claimed Qatar national ity. He came from Dubai on Sheikh Sa'id bin Maktoom’s launch but left it at Sohar and came to Matrah by land. He then visited Rustaq with letters of recommendation to the Imam and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar. He stayed with the Imam’s Wali at Rustaq, and then went to Tunuf, where he stayed twice with Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar for 12 and 15 days respectively. He returned via Wadi Sama’il, where he met the Imam for an hour. His object was stated to have been simply to see Jebel Akhdar, to take photographs and have a holiday. He stated that he spoke with Sheikh Suleiman only about agriculture and n the introduction of improvements”. An examination of his personal effects showed that he was in possession of a revolver of German make. Eight filns taken out of his personal effects were sent to India for developing and were later found to be of a harmless nature. Telegraphic enquiries were made from the Residency Agent, Sharjah and the Political Agent, Kuwait. In Kuwait he is considered as a troublesome fellow and politically minded. He is thought to have been in the Kuwait Youth League, and left Kuwait at the time of the anti-Sheikh agitation. H is not considered by the Residency Agent to be of any importance. Da’ud left Muscat on September 16th for Sohar en route to Dubai. The Wali of Sohar was instructed by His Highness to see that he did not change his intention of going to Dubai. 204. Large number of persons are applying for visas to go to the territories formerly known as Italian East Africa, to which travel has now been re-opened by the Government of India. Twenty-four visas have already been issued and many persons are awaiting visas. PIRACY AND SLAVERY . 205. Reference paragraph No. 159 of Muscat Intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1941.

On July 6th the Sultan accompanied by Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister for External Affairs, Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, and the Sheikh of Dubai visited the headquarters of the Muscat Infantry at 3ait-al- Falaj and watched the troops on parade, A sham attadk ort tribesmen holding positions on the surrounding hills was carried out. The Sheikh was much impressed by the spectacle. On July 10th a luncheon was given by the Sultan in honour of the Sheikh’s visit to which high officials of the Muscat Government and Mr, E,Thomas, Treasury Officer, and Mr, F.E. Prince of the Agency were invited. Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal gave a luncheon on July 11th. The Sheikh left Muscat for Dubai in his launch on July 13th. The Sultan told me that he was sure that the Sheikh of Dubai 1 s real object in coming to Muscat was to intercede on behalf of the Shihuh. It seems that Sheikh Sa'id bin Maktum depends to ,3 some extent on the Shihuh for assistance in his periodical rows &lt;ilco t4o H-m with the Jawasira and wished to ensure that the Sultan would not forbid their helping him while at the same time improving his relat ions with the Shihuh by posing as a mediator between them and the Sultan. Sheikh Sa’id bin Maktum asked for and was given a saluting cannon lying at Saham and one hundred cannon balls. He offered his launch to the Sultan which was politely declined. 152. The leading Sheikhs of the Dahirah including the Sheikhs of the Naim, A1 Bu Shamis and the Sheikh of Dhank visited the Sultan while he was at Sohar. He was also visited by the Sheikh of Fujairah. The Sultan told me that it was extremely hot at Sohar andy as he had not been there for some time, very expensive. &gt; &lt;y. 153. The summer has been an unusually severe one this year and » i i i' '■ 1 t the local populous are all looking very thin. Rai Sahib Gokaldai Khemji informed me that he had not known such weather in his thiriy odd years in Muscat▼ Hot westerly winds are still blowing. Evdry third person has boils. The only redeeming feature is that the dhti* malarial measures seem to have already had an effect as there is a I \ • / definite4 source that he landed a number of slaves at Fujairah and sold them ^ to the Sheikh. TRIBAL AFFAIRS . 160. Dibah . Reference paragraph No- 13X of Muscat. Intelligence Summary No. 10 of 1941. A meeting occurred between Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, i/i, Minister for Internal Affairs, and Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah of Kalba at Dibah. With the consent of the Jawasim the Sultan’s men occupied the Shihuh fort and the Jawasim tower which has been the cause of so much trouble before the conversation took place. The whole question seems to have been amicably settled on the following lines (a) . Sheikh Hassan bin Hahn ah of the Shihuh has been deposed and the tribe have been called upon to choose a successor. Hassan bin Rahmah has been brorght to Muscat and is being detained here under surveillance. (b) . The Shihuh and the Jawasim have agreed in writing to cancel any feud which might exist after the recent disturbances. (c) . The Jawasira have agreed to evacuate the Wadi Mad-hah and Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah is to come to Muscat to discuss the final terms in one month's time. (d) . Pending the selection of a new Sheikh the Shihuh fort is 1 being held by soldiers of the Wali of Khassab. Should the Shihuh fail to agree on a Sheikh then the Sultan will probably appdint a representative but he would prefer not to have to adopt this alternative as it will raise such questions as the provision of a garrison and the collection of Zakat. (e) . The Jawasin tower remains in the hands of the Sultan’s men under Sheikh Ghausn bin Salim al Awamir and by agreement with the Jawasim the Sultan can,if he so desires, destroy it. He will probably not take any action until Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah has paid his expected visit. /The Sultan- 5 - The Sultan told me that owing to the truce which was made by Ali bin Mudhaffar, Wali of Shinas, being signed by a number of the Shihuh Sheikhs he found it impossible to fix the blame for the breach of the truce on any particular man. 161« Ja T alan . Trouble continues between the Beni 3u Ali and the Beni Ot «Jc; Hi ^ Hasan and the Sultan is not anxious to become involved so he has refrained from giving any clear expression of his views to the Beni Hasan. However he will probably be approached by both sides on his coming visit to Sur and will be forced to take a hand in the settle ment of the dispute. The trouble is that the Beni Hasan are quite unreliable as has been said many times before and the Sultan feels sure that they will sooner or later break any agreement which may be come to whereupon the Beni Bu Ali will call upon him to punish or help them punish the Beni Hasan. I suggested ’’sanctions” at Sur might meet the case if he did become involved but I think his policy of keeping clear as long as trade at Sur is not disturbed a sound one. 162. Oman . The Sultan has invited through the usual channels Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar to meet him at Falaij in the neat* future* It is probable that the invitation will be accepted. The primary object of the meeting is for the Sultan and the Sheikh to discuss matters of mutual interest and the secondary object was to arrange for me to visit Jebel Akhdar. This will be the first meeting between the Sultan and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar and much may come of it. I regret that the secondary purpose of the meeting NO ^ovd)T . | ^ I can no longer be fulfilled. 163. The Imam is now in the Wadi Samail. PERSIAN GULF FIGHTER HJND . 164.

Thomas arrived at Muscat from India on May 29th and took charge as Treasury Officer. While at Karachi, the Political Agent,at the request of the Sultan, interviewed candidates for the post of Municipal Engineer. He suggested to the Sultan,that a former Assistant Civil Engineer at Aden should be appointed on six months probation. As the result of the landing of a Syrian subject in possession of an alien Embarkation Certificate issued at Aden and valid for Muscat in transit for India, the authorities at Aden were asked to refrain from issuing travel documents marked 'Muscat in Transit' to persons of doubtful nationality or those who have no bona fide business in Muscat. In spite of the Political Agent's visit to Dibah in April (see paragraph 95 of Summary 8) a report was received early in May of further trouble between the Shihuh and the Jawasim tribes. The Sultan discussed the affair with Major Hickinbotham and said that he was prepared to appoint a representative at Dibah. As/_ p—j-P nr— I As the result of pressure by the Imam, Sheikh Ali Bin Said of Ainane made a v/ritten request to the lluscat Government for help against him &gt; and a verbal offer of surrender on terms of the fort^ of Ainane which is the key to the Wadi A1 Kawasinah 6ind N.^hahirah. The Minister of External /affairs replied that the fort should be surrendered first and terms discussed later. The Sultan also proposed negotiating with the Imam for the surrender of Ibri which was occupied by the latter at the end of last year (see paragraph 14 of Summary No.l). There is little hope of the negotiations being successful, though the surrender of Ainane might have a good effect upon them.

I left for Muscat by car before day-break the following morning arriving, in Muscat- the. s , ^S: evening. L The journey was not without incident. Half way between Khor Fakkan and Dibah our boat was forced by stress :of weather to put into a small village which afforded..-some ..shelter from the strong M Shimal ,, which made further progress impossible. We were without adequate provisions and as no form of transport was available were forced to spend a comfortless afternoon and night nourished by a simple diet of bread and desiccated soup. It rained during the night. The people of the area are. very primitive and subsist principally on a poor quality date and fish but. unfortunately for us fj-i : i -L-i. • ; ‘ ' the storm had made fishing impossible for two days. './ On. our return my car stuck in heavy sand at water level at the foot of a steeply shelving beach with a.rising tide. Urgent and determined messengers to villages at a little distance produced a number of fishermen and what looked very unpleasantly like the total loss of the car re solved itself into, an expenditure of largesse after half an hour of intense physical and mental effort. .. The sequence of events at Dibah was as follows .- On March 28th the Shihuh attacked the Jawasim garrison which had been placed in the uncompleted tower at Dibah. Shots were |_ , • ‘ . 1 'll. • J- s' . exchanged but the action was inconclusive * _ The Jawasim exasperated by the action of their neighbours seem to have decided to accept an invitation to resume control of the villages of Mad-hah, Ghunah, and A1 Hair, whose inhabitants akin to the Beni Said sub-section of the Shihuh living between Shinas and Sohar have been paying Zakat to the Shihuh for a number of years. The Jawasim were not opposed in their undertaking although shots continued to be exchanged between the two tribes in Dibah. The total casualties during the recent-hostilities are one killed on each side and one man wounded but I am in doubt if this last was a Jawasim or a Shihuh, .1 •. The Shihuh action at Dibah was due to-.the fact that they3 knew that the work of construction of the tower had ceased pending the result of the negotiations in progress and they appear to have considered that the Jawasim were not carrying out the spirit of the arrangement by placing a garrison on the foundation of the tower, and reports that the construction was actually being continued were believed by them.

Reference paragraph No. 78 of Muscat Intelligence Summary* No. 6 of 1941. - On April 6th, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister for External Affairs, agreed to send a special messenger to Suwaiq with instructions to the Wali to arrest the Baluchis who had kidnapped Maryam and her family should they be found to be at Suwaiq. At the same time Saiyid Shahab said that he would send a car to Rustaq to bring bheikh Hilal bin Hamad al Sa’adi to Muscat. On April 9th, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal informed me that Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad had arrived at Muscat and denied any parti cipation in the case of Maryam bint Murad. He said that when Maryam* husband came to him he instituted a search and caused the house of Zainab bint Chiragh to be searched and heard that the children, of2 whom there was no trace, had been sent to the Interior. He ordered Zainab and her brother HakimaK bin Chiragh and their servants to leave his area and maintained that they had done so. The Wali of Suwaiq has now adopted much the same story after meeting Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad at Suwaiq. Sheikh Saif bin Amr, the special messenger, agreed that the Baluchis had fled. Saiyid Shahab in conclusion stated that in future he would not make any reference to the Wali or Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad but should another case occur he would send the complaining relative with a reasonable force of police to Suwaiq under the orders of a special messenger who would institute an immediate search. I agreed with him that this procedure was the only one which might result in the recovery of kidnapped persons. There is little doubt that Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad al Sa'adi i has been involved in this case yet in the absence of any certain evidence against him it is not possible to take any further action. I consider that the disturbance caused over the present case will be sufficient to deter him from resuming his profitable parti cipation in sla-Cre dealing for some time to come. TRIBAL AFFAIRS . 86.

On April 9th, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal informed me that he had heard that renewed fighting had taken place between the Jawasim and the Shihuh at Dhibah and that the Jawasim had occupied certain areas which rightly belonged to the Shihuh. On April 10th a report was received by Saiyid Shahab from the Wali of Sohar to the effect that Humaid bin Abdullah of Kalba had sent forty men to occupy Wadi Mad-hah and Ghunah. On April the 10th Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal order ed Ali bin Mudhaffar, Wali of Shinas, to go to Dhibah and endeavour to&lt;v arrange that hostilities should cease and to make a full report on - * . the situation. \ On April 12th, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal informed me that he had heard from the Shihuh Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammad of Dhibah, who had arrived at Muscat, that the Jawasim had taken over control . ...r of the Wadi Mad-hah and Ghunah. The Shihuh maintained that they had not in any way provoked an attack and demanded arms and ammunition to defend themselves and the Sultan's territory. Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammad,who I saw the same day, told me that the Jawasim who had occupied the Wadi Mad-hah and Ghunah were not solely from Kalba but also from Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah, and that the tower at Dhibah over which there had been much controversy was still being built. The Sheikh added that Humaid bin Abdullah of Kalba was at the root of the trouble between the Shihuh and the Jawasim, and that they had got on very well with Sheikh Ahmad bin Rashid but could not get on with Humaid. I advised Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal most strongly not to agree to the Shihuh request for arms and ammunition and said that I was prepared to go to Dhibah myself and examine the position and would take any representative of the Muscat Government that he cared to send with me as he doubted if Ali bin Mudhaffar had been able to get to Dhibah. oaiyid Shahab bin Faisal said he would like to send Mudhaffar bin Suleiman, Wall of Sohar, and that he would take no action as regards arms and ammunition until I returned. I left for Dhibah on the 14th April having suggested that it would be advantageous if the Residency Agent, Sharjah could meet me there. FOREIGN SHIPPING . 88. Japanese . S.S.

On March 15th, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister for External Affairs, informed me that 123,000 dollars had been exported from Muscat during the last four weeks and that it was certain that the export concession was being abused. On March 16th a notification was issued by the Muscat Government, which was made applicable to British subjects, prohibiting the export of dollars from the State. 74. On March 15th, Saiyid Shahab informed me that Mudhaffar bin Suleiman, Wali of Sohar, had reported to him that the Jawasim and Beni Qatab were objecting to a tower that he was building by the Sultan’s order. It was being built to prevent thieving and black mail, controlling as it did the Wadi-al-Qaur entrance to the Batinah. RECn. POL. DEPt. 2 6JUU941 INDfA OFFICE2 According to the Wall's report the site of the tower is situated in Muscat territory. The Wali forwarded letters which he had received from the Sheikh of Sharjah and others on this subject to which it seems he had thought fit to reply. I advised Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal that it was not desirable for the Wali to reply direct to such letters and suggested that he be instructed to forward them to Muscat. On March 22nd Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal informed the Sultan by telegram that the tower had been completed without incident. 75. On March 28th a local subject by the name of Fardous was sentenced to seven days' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25 for selling matchfa at Rs. 3/12/- a gross instead of Re. 1/11/3 as fixed by the Price Control Committee. 76. Sardar Rustam Khan, a brother of Sardar Mehrab Khan of Kech, Mekran, has been in the service of the Muscat Government for forty years. He now wishes to retire and in November last petitioned the Kalat State Authorities for permission to reside in Mekran and for a reasonable subsistence allowance. Should an allowance such as would be in keeping with the position he considers it necessary to maintain as a Sardar not be forthcoming he proposed to send his women folk to Baluchistan and retire to Mecca to spend his remaining years in the holy places. The Sardar's family left for Baluchistan in January, 1941, and are now living with their numerous relatives, some of whom it would seem are their bitterest enemies, while Rustam Khah himself remained here awaiting the Kalat State's decision. On March 26th, Sardar Rustam Khan stated that bitter enmity existed between his brother Mehrab and himself and that he had recei ved reports from Kalat State that his youngest daughter aged thirteen years, who is married to Mir Inayat Ullah Khan a son of Sardar Mehrab Khan, was being ill-treated. In an interview on March 29th he accused his brother of every vice from petty theft to wholesale murder and expressed his disappointment at not having received a reply to his petition to the Kalat State Authorities. The old gentleman seem ed very concerned about his little daughter and asked if the Kalat State Authorities could be asked to take action to protect her. I pointed out to him that the only evidence he had that she was being3 ill-treated came from his other female relations and Mir Sheikh Omer, son of Nawab Mir Bai Khan, to whom his grand daughter is married and ^who he knows has no love for Sardar Mehrab Khan and his offspring and suggested that he should telegraph to his younger son who is at Turbat to enquire into the allegations and to let him know the facts. TRIBAL AFFAIRS . 77. Reference paragraph No. 62 of Muscat Intelligence Summary No. 5 of 1941. The situation remains much the same. SLAVERY . 78. On March 12th a Baluch woman, Maryam bint Murad, reported to me that her two sons, a daughter and herself were kidnapped by an Iranian Baluch from a place called Jigin on the Mekran Coast and that they were brought to Suwaiq to be sold as slaves. Mai yam’s husband arrived from Baluchistan and found her at Suwaiq but it seems she had been separated from her children. The parents state that they locat ed the children near Suwaiq but were unable to effect their release owing to threats by Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad al Sa’adi so they came to this Agency. Representations were made at once to Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal who sent a special messenger to Yaroob bin Kahtan, Wali of Suwaiq, who found that Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad had left for Rustaq to get married. I then sent Maryam and a special messenger to Suwaiq with a strong letter to thb Governor from Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal. The Governor searched the immediate neighbourhood of the town but announced his inability to take any action in the al Sa’ad area and so the release of the children was not secured. I have discussed the situation at length with Saiyid Shahab Atfiuvi. bin Faisal and the matter will be taken up with the Sultan as soon as he returns. The Regent is unwilling to take decisive action, which in this case may mean the use of force, in the Sultan’s absence. The Regent and I are in complete agreement with regard to the part played by Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad in aiding Baluch slavers and we are also in agreement regarding the incompetence of the Governor of Suwaiq.

He said that he had received information similar to that which I obtained and that he had further been informed that the Imam had collected an army of at least eight to ten thousand men at Bahlah. In his opinion, this last item of information was a gross exaggeration as he could not for the life of him understand where the Imam could raise such a force and pay it* when it was known that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi had not till then taken any part in the Dahirah trouble. Even if Ainane was occupied by the Imam, Saiyid Shahab did not consider that it was possible for the followers of the Imam to hold the area they had acquired for more than a month to six weeks. pects of pay and loot dwindled. On February 5th, Saiyid Shahab informed me that he had received letters from the Wall of Sohar which had been addressed to Hamdan bin Saliym by Zahar bin Ghausn and Mohammad bin Salim ar Raqeshi to the effect that the Imam had control of Ibri and that Mohammad bin Salim ar Raqeshi had been appointed Wali of Ibri on behalf of the Imam. Further, that the situation was calm and that in future the law of the Shara would govern Ibri.

On January 19th, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal told me that according to reports received Zahar bin Ghausn had left Ibri with all his men and had retired to Saleef. His move was prompted by the action of the Ghafiri tribes to the north and west of Ibri, who not looking with any pleasure on the Hinawi / successsuccess there, began to collect with the probable intention of taking active measures to turn him out. Minor sections of the Ghafiri tribes were reported to be harrying Zahar bin Ghausn at the village of Saleef, where lie has halted pending the arrival of the assistance which he has asked the Imam Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili to send him.

The Imam was reported to have appeal ed to Saqr bin Sultan of the Naim at Baraimi for assistance but his appeal had not been answered.

He has issued instructions that all dhows must obtain manifests and that their documents will be examined on their return and if the landing of their cargoes at the port noted in their manifests is not confirm ed they will be severely punished. He mentioned that Sur dhows are not likely to trade with the Italian possessions unless they are paid in silver and not in Liras which are not easily negot iable. Watch is being maintained on all dhows leaving in that direction. 261.

LOCAL OFFICIALS . 238, Ismail bin Khalil Rasassi, Wall of Matrah, visited Quriyat on a tour of inspection on October 11th and returned to Muscat on October 13th. LOCAL INTERESTS . 239. Owing to a reduced rainfall in the interior durihg the last three years the water in Muscat has become unpleasantly salt and a number of wells have dried up completely. In order to meet a situation which tends to become serious the Muscat Government have authorised the construction of an experimental dam in the upper part of the Wadi al Kabir. Should this work prove satisfactory and the rain water collected remain* for a reasonable period a more ambitious and permanent work will be put in hand next year. 240. The repairs to fortifications have been very much accel erated since the Sultan’s return from Bombay. Following on the Sultan's own visit to the Batinah in the latter half of August the visit of inspection by Ismail bin Khalil Rasassi, Wall of Matrah, mentioned in my Intelligence Summary No. 17 para 216, has resulted in increased effort to complete the work before the end of the year. 41. Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur, half brother of the Sultan, ecently expressed his wish to marry the daughter of Saiyid Hamood dn Hamad, Wall of Gwadur. The Sultan gave his approval but un- ortunately it was soon discovered that Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal, / the eldestbin Taimur J s intention to marry her. It is to be hoped that Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal will be dissuaded from his intention. 242. Owing to their tanker being required for other work the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company landed six months supply of petrol and oilon, -iU Ottoba. Five thousand tins of paraffin have been stored at Mukalla Cove. GWADURc 243. A difference of opinion has occurred at Gwadur between the Wali, Hamud bin Hamad ? and Qoda Khudadad Khan, the recognised leader of the Baluchis of the Nigor area. The Wali had occasion to admonish Khudadad for what he considered slackness in not effecting the arrest of a man wanted for murder. Khudadad has replied by interfering in the Wali's plans to marry a Baluchi girl. The Sultan is in possess ion of all the facts of the case. TRIBAL AFFAIRS „ 244. It is reported that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi has complained to the Sultan that Dhofar bedouins have stolen two camels belonging to his tribesmen. Action is being taken to recover the stolen property and punish the thieves. 245. The Omanis are becoming alarmed at the world political situation and have expressed their fear that the pre occupation of other nations will leave their country open to invasion by Iran. It is a curious thing that the Omanis always have a fear of an Iranian incursion. The Sultan has received letters from and on behalf of all three of the Omani leaders. The Imam has authori sed the sending of a letter suggesting that the Sultan should receive a visit from an envoy from him. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi has written to offer his assistance if necessary in the defence of the country and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar has authorised the issue of a letter expressing his desire to meet the Sultan and discuss events. The Sultan intends to reply that he has no fear of external aggression but notwithstanding he would welcome a visit from Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar and the Imam’s envoy.MMHfl ■ 7 246. I have recently read a lehter written by Sheikh^lsa hin Saleh al Harthi to Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, who has [been in dis^ra^ for sometime. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh is as anti-foreign ao he ever' was his letter is to be believed. He seems to take pleasure in the European war and considers that the European nations have well deserved their present trials and tribulations.

He has recently come up from Dhofar with letters to the Sultan. He is mentioned at pages 26, 38 and 54 of Bertram Thomas’ ’’Arabia Felix$. He said he had come from Dhofar via Jazir (9 days), Wadi Hugf (3 days), Addm (7 days), Muscat (4 days), making a total of 22 days actual travelling. There is a shorter way direct from the Wadi Hugf to Dhofar which takesA 3 r; i \ vJ t J l 1940 j 8 days but has no water on the way. If this man's statement is true, and I see no reason to doubt it, then the Wadi Hugf is incorrectly cited on the 1934 Survey of India 1/2,000,000 map and should be shown much further South. 187« On August 1st the Sultan informed me that the repair® to the Batinah forts were progressing very slowly and that he hoped to increase the rate of progress. The absence of good masons and the fact that he had been absent in Bombay and that the date harvest is taking up all labour at least in part accounts for the failure to get on with the work. 188.

At an interview I had with the Sultan on the 10th of August he said he had received a pleasant letter from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi. There was nothing of note in the letter except an expression of surprise that the Sultan should permit beer and spirits to be sold in the town. The letter mentioned that the Sheikh of Bahrain had prohibited the sale of all intoxicating liqueur. I thought it worth mentioning to His Highness that the Sheikh's prohibition had not made it impossible for spirits to be obtained in Bahrain by influential people and members of the Ahl Khalifah unless things had chang ed very much in the last three years. The Sultan mentioned with some amusement that Sheikh Isa had returned from Bahrain with a complete set of false teeth. Sheikh Isa is a 'mutawwah' It transpired during the course of our conversation- 4 - 5649 1940 J that Mohammad the eldeet son o*T Sheikh Isa had\augg^ 9 ^ 3 ''hXm&lt;» self as a suitable person to the Sultan as a Governor of one of the Sultan f s districts and according to the Sultan would be willing at any time to accept employment. He is notoriously miserly and therefore is very unpopular. 189. I enquired at my last interview with His Highness about the political position in Jebel Akhdar. He said it was quiet. I said I hoped it would soon be possible to move freely there. He said that he did not think Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar would raise any objection to my going there and said that if I liked he would make enquiries through Suleiman bin Hamiyar's Wazir, Saif bin Hashim. I thanked him and said I should be grateful as I would much like to see the country later on say in the early Springi 190.

Reference paragraph No. 116 of Muscat Intelligence3 Summary No, 9 of 1940. The trouble between the Beni Has^n and the Beni Bu All fr'Uiil--continues but no major action has or is likely to take place between these two tribes. The Sultan declines to intervene in a tribal dispute and he will probably not permit his astute Wall at Sur to have anything to do with the matter. The trouble is that while Ali bin Abdul.lah of the Beni Bu Ali has control over his tribe none of the Beni Hasan Sheikhs are able to exercise any control over their men so that while the Beni Bu Ali Sheikh’s word can be accepted as binding on his men it is very doubtful if the Beni Hasan would be bound by any undertaking given on their behalf by any of their Sheikhs. 168.

As the attack of Abriyin was considered an aggression against a less powerful tribe than the invaders, the Imam is reported to have collected 1,000 men and marched from Nizwa to Awabi. He sent a warning to the Abriyin that he would take up arms against them. The Imam is reported to have received a message on the way from Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar to the effect that he should return to Nizwa as Suleiman was trying to settle the matter peacefully and that the Imam's action would only spread trouble all over the country. The Imam returned to Nizwa, and Sheikh Suleiman has now sent fifty sheikhs of the Abriyin to the Imam with Khalfan bin Ali, whose gardens estimated at Rs 50,000 have been burnt an£ ruined by the Abriyin.

Apart from a slight revival in the dhow-building trade, trade is extremely quiet in Gwadur. it is stated there that the Kalat authorities have prohibited the export of any of the produce of Mekran; and that the State is to purchase any surplus there may be. This is presumably a rumour merely based on Kalat's desire to 'squeeze' Gwadur by diverting trade to her pown ports; since much of her produce is of a perishable nature. FOREIGN INTERESTS . 137.

The people of Nakhl are believed to be intending to approach Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdhar to intervene. asked him why the road had been closed. The Wali replied that the reason is that the Muscat Government have imported lorries and that he fears they may attack Nakhl.

Desai, were asked by the Muscat Government to visit Sheikh Isa bin Saleh, who was reported to 1 0 vary ill. On examination Sheikh Isa bin Saleh was found to be suffering from pneumonia. His condition was sais to be serious. On the 16th March as the Sheikh’s condition was still serious Dr. DMA Thoms of the Arabian tmerican Mission was called in to consultation. On the 17th March the Sheikh was reported to be slightly better and in the evening a latter was received from iyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the / effect thateffect that Sheikh Isa would rather not be attended by the doctors. At the same time Sheikh Isa asked the Muscat Govern ment to allow him to leave for Bahrain for medical treatment. The Muscat Government enquired from the Agency Assistant Surgeon if Sheikh Isa was in a fit state to travel to Bahrain by the slow mail steamer on the 19th March. The Agency Assistant Surgeon replied at once to the effect that the Sheikh was toe ill to be moved and was not fit to travel. He stated that if Sheikh Isa persisted in leaving for Bahrain it would be against medical advice. As the Sheikh decided to ignore the doctor r s advice and insisted on leaving for Bahrain, the Muscat Government said they had no objection tut warned him that he did so at his own risk. On the evening of the 18th March Sheikh Isa changed his mind and decided to postpone his departure. The condition of the Sheikh,is now reported to be very much improved. The Sultan had a very friendly conversation with Sheikh Isa bin Saleh on the 95th March and it has now been decided that Sheikh Isa should go t# Bahrain by the slow mail steamer leaving here on the 2nd April. 86. Reference paragraph No. 231 of Muscat Intelligence Summary No. 22 of 1939.

In the Sultan * s absence on the 19th March Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister fer Foreign Affairs, issued another 'Alan' prohibiting the export of silver or silver coins until the end of March. This will enable the Sultan tj examine the position and decide whether or not he considers it advisable to continue the prohibition indefinitely. 87. The Sultan proposes to leave for Bombay on a private visit on the 19th of April to consult an eye specialist. His Secretary, Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily, will probably leave here on the 5th of April to arrange suitable accommodation in Bombay.F 88. A small committee was formed of local British Indian subjects in January and an appeal for subscriptions in connect ion with His Excellency the Viceroy’s War Purposes Fund was made to the British and British Indian Communities. A sum of Rs. 2,379 has been subscribed and sent to the Honorary Treasurer of the Fund in New Delhi. 89. On the morning of March 29th the Sultan informed me that he had heard on good authority that the Imam’s financial position was weaker. The Imam had sold most of the Crown lands and was now selling ”wuqf” property. Recently a serious murder was committed by members of the Abriyin tribe. The tribe were ordered by the Imam to produce the culprits. The tribe refused and the paramount Sheikh of the Abriyin was imprisoned by the Imam until the culprits should be produced. The Sheikh abdi cated .and the Imam appointed a nominee of his own as Sheikh. The ex-Sheikh was released and went home with the new Sheikh. The tribe refused to accept the Imam’s decision and sc the new man has abdicated and the old Sheikh has v/ritten to say that he has at the wish of his people resumed the leadership of the tribe. The Imam would normally have turned to the paramount Sheikh of Jebel Akhdar, Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar, for aid in dealing with the Abriyin, but unfortunately he was ill advised enough to imprison Suleiman bin Hamiyar's principal adviser and wazir, one Saif bin Hashim, in connection with a money matter. The Sultan had heard that Suleiman bin Hamiyar is annoyed £a±h the Imam’s action and it looks as if the old enmity between this powerful leader and the Abriyin will be, at least temporarily, suspended and a united front will be formed against the Imam. The Sultan further said that the present Governor of Bahia, Abdullah bin Mohammad i-xbu ^ Zaid, who is the most pov/er- ful and wealthy of the Imam's Governors, will certainly side with Suleiman bin Hamiyar in the not unlikely event of a serious breach occuring as he owes his position to Suleiman's father and is a particular friend of Suleiman himself. The situation is interesting.90. Reference paragraph No. 73 of Muscat Intelligence Summary No.. 6 of 1940. On March 29th the Sultan informed me that there had been repercussions in the Ja'alan area as the result of the murder of Abdullah bin Ahmad al Rawaf, a Saudi subject and a ^adi cn thd Beni Bu Ali ? by the Beni Hasan. Suleiman, the son ol the murderea man, has written to the Sultan through the Wall of 3ur, S a ud bin Ali, to the effect that he, the Sultan, should decide the case and threatening to appeal to Ibn Saud if the Sultan refuses. The Sultan has replied that it is a tribal matter and he does noo propose to interfere. It seems that one section ol the Beni Hasan under Mohammad bin Arnr are spread ing a rumour to the effect that the man was murdered by order of the Sultan by the paramount Sheikh of the Beni Hasan. The Beni Bu all are prepared to aside by tribal law or a Shara finding. _,ie Beni Hasan, however, are not. The Sultan does not think that there will be any trouble in Sur proper.

Mr. C.S.J. Collier, C.M.G., called on me on February the 16th. He said that he was on his way to Afghanistan where he hoped to further British trading interests. The object of his visit to Muscat was to interest the Sultan in a plan to inaugurate a State post office in Muscat. j.t seemed that he had some pre liminary conversation with Rai Sahib Dulichand, ex-Director of Revenues of the Muscat State, in London in 1938. However the Sultan had not displayed any interest in the scheme and made it clear that he did not wish to see Mr. Collier. The postal ques tion was not the only reason for his visit as he also stated that he was interested in introducing or in inducing the Sultan to introduce a new coinage into Muscat. The Sultan showed no interest in this scheme. As he found it impossible to make any progress Mr. Collier decided to leave Muscat by the down mail ©n February the 17th. In the course of conversation Mr. Collier informed me that he had been unable to obtain a visa for Egypt in London. However he experienced no difficulty in going to Cairo frftm Port Said and seemed t« have made some sort of proposition to the Egyptian Government in regard to the supply of ams and ammunition, / by a area*. ^by a Greek firm. I gathered that he did not anticipate that the ISgyptian Government would seriously consider his offer and he sail he had called at Jedda after leaving Egypt and made the same proposition to the Hedjaz Government also without success.

Sur was reached early on the following morning. I landed immediately on arrival and interviewed the British subjects. They were content ed and said that t business was very good. Later the Wall, Sand bin Ali, whose brother is Wali of Rustak, arrived accompanied by Saiyid Tarlk bin Taimur bin Faisal, the Sultan's brother. The general state of the country and of trade was discussed. On October the 9th I visited Bilad Sur returning to Sur the same evening and embarking for Quriyat. During my visit I met and talked with Sheikh Mohammad bin Amr, the principal sheikh of the Beni Bu Hasan, Sheikh Said bin Sultan al Ml jail, Sheikh Nasr bin Sultan bin Mansur al Wahibah, Sheikh Yasah bln Hamood, the chief of the Jannabah and the Sheikhs of Sur proper. I arrived at Quriyat at 3 a.m. on the 10th October. I left for Muscat at 6 a.m. and arrived at the Consulate at 9-30 a.m. 179. Mr. G. Murt&amp;za, Assistant Engineer, Public Works Depart ment, Independent Persian Gulf Sub-Division, Bushire landed at Muscat during the stay of S.S.'Bamora ff on the 14th of October and discussed several Public Works Department matters with me. He is proceeding to Gwadur on a tour of inspection. Lo^k^^ggis. 180. Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal, uncle of His Highness the Sultan, who is now 52 years old has asked for His Highness’s permission to remarry. 181. His Highness the Sultan received a telegram dated the 11th October 1939 from Monsieur Daladier in reply to His Highness's telegram dated the 13th August 1939 to the French Foreign Minister. His Hi^iness had asked the French Foreign Minister to reconmend / a firm whoa firm who would undertake to supply him with 40,000 ; 'chargeurs', 30,000 for Martini Henry rifles and 10,000 of 7 millimetre siae. Monsieur D&amp;ladier in his telegram has recommended the name of a French firm who would willingly undertake the execution of the order. 182. Sagr bin Sultan, eldest son of the Sheikh of Sharjah, arrived at Muscat on the 10th of October from B&amp;raimi. he had previously travelled from Sharjah to Ras-al-Khaimah and from Has* al-Khaimah to Baraimi. He stated that he left Sharjah with five followers and that he had been joined by ten more on his travels. He left his followers at Sohar. he travelled by car from Ras-al- Khaimah to Baraimi in one day whereas travelling by camel takes three days. It is believed that the object of his journey to Muscat was to enlist His Hi^iness^ assistance in removing his father and installing himself in his fathers place. He is accompanied by Sheikh Abdul Rehman of Hera, his maternal grand father. On the morning of October the 13th Sagr bin Sultan called on me. He apologised for his grand father*s absence saying he had a headache and was unable to be present (quite untrue as I had seen him in the suq ten minutes before Sagr bin Sultan called). Sheikh Abdul Rehman called in the afternoon when I was unable to see him. He called again on the , 14th of October accompanied by Sagr bin Sultan. It appears that they had received no presents from His Highness on the termination of their visit and that they had no money to settle accounts here and return to Sharjah. I have therefore lent them Rs. 110/-. I gather that the Sultan has refused his assistance. 183. Sheikh Ibrahim bin Sa’id al Abri, chief of the A1 Abriyin, arrived at Muscat on the 11th of October with certain of his follow ers. He has accepted His Highness*s invitation to conduct Ramazan Prayers this year as usual. 184. Mohammad Abdullah Salimin, the late Wali of Nakhl, and / Hamdan bin3 Hamflan bin Salim al-Ha'irl) a landlord, have paid a visit to Muscat* Suleman al Baruni, His Highness^ Adviser on tribal affairs, and Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, have been negotiating with Mohammad Abdullah Salimin with the object of inducing him to accept a Muscat Government appointment* They have been unsuccessful* A local rumour is to the effect that Mohammad Abdullah Salimin would be given the post of the Secretary to His Highness in place of the present Secretary, Ali Mohammad Jamali, who is a Shia* I doubt if there is any truth in this rumour. I understand that Mohammad Abdullah Salimin will pay another visit to Muscat after the Ramazan. 186. Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur bin Faisal, half brother of His Highness the Sultan, has asked His Highness's permission to marry a girl from the al Wahiba tribe. 186• On the 5th of October His Highness asked me if arrange ments could be made to have Rs. 26,000 transferred from his account with the Imperial Bank of India, Bombay to Muscat through the Government Treasury. Arrangements were accordingly made and the money, which I believe to be required to meet the pay of officials etcetera for September, was paid over in silver to the Sultan's head slave at night with some degree of secrecy as His Highness did not wish it known that he was obtaining funds from India to meet his current expenses. 187. His Highness informed me that he had received a gift of Rs. 75,000 from the Burmah Oil Company, Limited on their withdraw ing from the Gwadur Oil Concession negotiations. His Highness said that he was surprised at the Company's generosity but could not see any ulterior motive in the Company's action. 188. Saiyid Nasr bin Haraud, ex-Wall of Quriyat, arrived here on the 1st of October and left for Sib after a stay of few days in Muscat. 189.

On the 19th of ^ugust Saiyid Saud bin Ali bin Salim, a cousin of His Highness* s mother was locked up in the Fort Mi^s for using abusive language against Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal senior uncle of the Sultan. He is still under detention. 129. Two Shaikhs of Dariz with a number of armed followers arrived on the 19th of August and after paying their homage to His Highness the Sultan and receiving presents returned to their tribal area on the 26th of August. 128. Shaikh Isa bin Salih, the paramount Shaikh of the Sharqiyah is reported to he seriously ill. 129. His Highness has received a report that King Ibn Saud has renewed his prohibition of the import of slaves and has ordered the return of those recently acquired. Messengers have visited the Baraimi area and His Highness understands that that the..trade-in I ^IECd. POL.DEPt. 2^001939 S, INDIA OFFICc- 2 -.. mty; oWii Observations slaves has now ceased altogether. From I am inclined to agree and consider that at present there is no trading in the Batinah. 130. The situation of the Baiza-dollar exchange is causing trouble. The rate of exchange in the interior is lowerrthan in Muscat, resulting in a flow of Baizas out of the main towns and a shortage of small change in the markets. Business people are seriously inconvenienced.The Sultan proposes to issue a nickel coinage of his own to supplement the Baizas. The coins will be of small value - the largest probably being of the face vilue of a quarter of a dollar. The Sultan hopes that permission will be granted for the coins to be minted by the Bombay Mint. 131. The Sultan issued an order on the 27th of August,1939 abolishing the Civil Courts. All Civil cases will now be tried by the Shar’s Courts. 132. The Sultan proposes to appoint two Ministers. Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, his uncle, will be appointed minister for Foreign Affairs and will deal with all matters of a routine nature having to do with external subjects. Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim will be appointed Minister for the Interior and will deal with tribal matters. Shaikh Suleman Pasha al Baruni has been relegated to the position of personal adviser, he in receipt of a stipend fr»m^ the State but I gather the Sultan has lost confidence in him. 133. Reference paragraph 112 of last Summary. The recent visit of the Shaikh of Has al Xhaimah has puzzled the Sultan. He informed me at an interview I had with him on August tne 22nd that no mention was made of the construction of fortifications in the Wadi al Q,aur which he believed the Shaikh had come to discuss. The Shaikh, he thought, seemed alarmed and was apparently considering taking refuge in Muscat should there be trouble in has al Khaimah. The Sultan also informed that immediately on his return the Shaikh had started3 a new form of taxation, 1 J •- -- ' conversations together, the Shaikh’s action so soon after his return must give the impression that His Highness was least cognisant of the intention to introduce the tax. 134. Shaikh Suleman Hamyar of Jabal Akhdar has sent a very pressing invitation to the Multan 1 s half brother, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur to visit him. It is probable that the invitation will be accepted and that the Wali of Sur will accompany Saiyid i'ariq. 135. “Mr. T.P. T.

The Sultan thinks consideration. In order to facilitate food control a census of the towns of Muscat and Matrah is to be undertaken. 137. At an interview with His Highness toe Sultan on the 27th of August he mentioned his friendly relations with the principal Shaikhs of the ~briyin tribe. He said that he would Iiks to visit their tribal area( see Lorimer Volumell page 16).

Cn the information being signalled to Air Head quarters 'Iraq# the Vincent which had flown back to Muscat with the nows was ordered to return to Khor Gharim with a supply of water and provisions for the occupants of the 3 rd machine left at the place and 2 Valencias of Ko.70 Squadron from Mnaidi were detailed to proceed to the scene of the disaster to endeavour to recover the bodies and remove them for burial to kiiscnt. The machines arrived at Muscat on 1st Kovember and left for Khor Gharim the same day. Wing Commander F.C.B. -avillo, ?03 (F.B.) Squadron, -Hnerah, appointed to preside over the Board of Enquiry into the accident# Flight- lieutenant ?• L. v.hi teheed# in charge of the led leal arrangc- r.cnte# and Squadron -reader C»H*A» Stevens# Officer Commanding 84 Squadron, were on board. The Political Agent and H.M's Consul, Muscat, also accompanied the party. Owing to the difficulty of landing large machines on the Kkqrjo Gharim ground, one Valencia proceeded only as far as kasirah Island where it stood by until the other aircraft returned. On orriTol 0 t Khop 1 Ohorim on the 2 nd Hovembcr it was found that the 3 bodies which had already been buried were not in a fit state for transportation and it \ wrs therefore necessary to leave them after making the graves as secure nnd inconspicuous as possible. The crashed machine was found to be so badly damaged as to make salvage useless. It was therefore set on fire after various instruments and the personal effects of the- 3 of the deceased had been removed. The 2 Vincents and the Valencia left Khor Gharim on ?nd Kovember and after spending the night at Masirah Island in company with the second Valencia arrived back in liuscat on erd November and departed en route for ’Iraq on the following day. Bcdu appeared on the scon bent on not allowing such a heaven sent opportunity of loot to go by# The personnel of the machine which hod remained at Khor Ghnrirn at this time were engaged in the exceedingly difficult task of extracting the bodies from the tangle of wreckage and solving their baggage and easily removable ports of the machine. The Arabs swarmed around pilfering and seizing any parts they could break off and os fast os some were pushed bock from one side others come in on the other. In this way the wireless apparatus was fount* to hove been carried off. these were eventually recovered though with considerable diffi culty by the Airmen. wrecked machine was recovered together with all the dead men's personal belongings and all solvable ports with the exception of the wireless set reflects, in my opinion, the very greatest credit on the 2 Non-Commissioned Officers, iergent *'roinc and Corporal Bougourd, and the 2 Airmen of the party, who remained at Khor Ohorim. The tact,ability and firmness shown in dealing with these half savage desert Arabs, whoso reputation for law lessness and disregard for all authority is notorious, was, I consider, remarkable and deserving of a high commo^ndation. From the time the relief Valencia appeared until all the aircraft left Khor Gharim not more than half a dozen Arabs appeared. On being asked why they hod pilfered the wrecked machine all protested their innocence and declared it was the ^ wr.'r.W It appoare that shortly after the Accident some 30-40 The sight of the machine gun ammunition being unloddci wild J was however too much for thc/Bcdu and a rush woe mode for the precious stuff. A certain number of rounds were seized but The fact that the whole of the ammunition in thework of Arobe from the interior — the standard excuse in these districts. If the conduct of the local inhabitants on this occasion cannot be said to have been above reproach it might iv, wcil have been worse in view of the total absence of any effective control on the part of the Muscat Government over these districts. The news of the death of Wing Commander Rickards was received with genuine regret by the Sultan and many other persons in Muscat with whom the deceased officer hod been acquainted for several years and to whom his attractive person-, ality and especially hie tact and sympathetic understanding of Arab ways had particularly endeared him.

SULTANtS TOUR IN INDIA . 6. The Sultan 1 s visit to Kashmere was not apparently a great success. After only 10 days 1 stay His Highness left for Bombay in order as he stated to get cool! Srinagar according to him being unbearably hot. For a Muscat! to find any other place too hot must mean that a phenominal heat wave must be on. The probable reason behind the curtailment of the Kashmere trip is that the Sultan finds the comparatively simple life not nearly so alluring as the cinemas and other town attractions of Bombay and Karachi. His Highness proceeded to K arachi on 18th August, where he was met by the Political Agent who came down from Baluchistan to discuss certain important matters with him. The Sultan sailed on 22nd August for Muscat which he reached on 24th. RULING FAMILY.. 7.

He had been summoned from Europe/^urope by the Sultan, as it *as time according to him that Saiyid Tariq learnt to become an Arab. He speaks Jiaaglish, German and Turkish, but not a word of Arabic pray”. So it appears the young man will have plenty to occupy himself with for the next few months at Muscat.

The Sultan said with a yearning tone in his voice that he would much like to possess a few of these weapons as they would be invaluable for sweep ing the bazaars in troublesome towns since to quote his words 'these guns are evidently expressly designed to extinguish life'. Both Captain Byard and myself had assured the Sultan that good as were these American weapns which are, I believe, known as n £ub machine guns', the types used in the British Army were more suited to the requirement of a military force such as his Levy.

The Director of Revenues issued a public notice on 4th February t® the effect that electric current could be obtained by the public from the State Power House. The rate fixed far each light of 40 C.P. is Rs 2/- per mensem f and so far only one merchant has taken current t® his house. An Indian electrician arrived from India at the end of the last month and the State electric plant which was closed on the departure ®f His Highness to Dhofar started working again from the 1st February. 6. It is reported that in the first week of February two men of Bani Said, a section of the Hawasinah tribe, went to the neighbourhood of Deel, a place near Khaburah and carried away a fdw camtls belonging to the Yal Braik tribe. The raiders were pursued and the camels recovered after a fight in which two men of the Yal Braik were wounded and one of the raiders was captured f the other having managed to escape. As a result of this incident relations between the aboveabeve mentioned bribes have been strained* Hewever, the Shaikh of Bani Umar intervened and a truce ef 46 days between the tribes of Hawasinah and Yal Braik was concluded. The prisoner was handed over to the Wali of Khaburah for custody. It is expected that before the expiry of the truce the parties will come to some understanding. 7, Last year a certain Nejdi who took some goods to Khaburah and thence to Dhahirah was killed while on his way and his belongings were stolen. It has now been ascertained that the Nejdi was killed by his own guide whose services he had obtained to accompany him from Khaburah to Dhahirah through a Bedouin of al Fida. Sheikh Sulaiman bin Sinan, th&lt; chief of Yankml offered to pay the Amir of Hasa blood money t and compensation for the stolen goods. The Amir is reported to have declined to accept the offer and to have demanded the surrender of the murderer. Much anxiety is being felt in Dhahirah now as the Sheikh is hesitating to surrender the murderer, and the inhabitants fear that the Amir of Hasa may instigate the neighbouring tribes to attack them any time. 8, In May 1936 Saiyid Hamud, oneof the uncles of His Highness proceeded on six months* leave to Zanzibar in order to arrange for the marriage of his son^ there. The marriage was, however, delayed owing to the absence of the wife of Saiyid Nadir, the senior uncle of His Highness and aanuaptSH consequently Saiyid Hamud was not able to return to Muscat in time. It is reported that the Sultan on hearing that Saiyid Hamud had overstayed his leave has ordered his allow ance to be stopped with effect from January 1936. It is, however, believed that the Sultan of Zanzibar is going to ask His Highness to condone the overstayal and to n rescind his order for the forfeiture of the allowance. 9 , a robbery is reported to have taken place in Sohar. The Askaris who watch the bazaar at night were suspected and detained by the Naib Wali of Sohar. They were, however, set freeset free when the Shaikh of Bani Umar, to which tribe the Askaris belong, demanded their immediate release, FOREIGN INTERESTS * 10. Reference paragraph 12 ©f last Summary.

A descent having first been made on the old landing ground, the new ground which is situated some 4 miles to the southward, was visited. This new ground was found to be in an excellent condition, requiring no work to be done on it, and apparently better in every respect to the former ground. The Flight returned to Muscat the same day• as the inhabitants of the village near the old landing ground were reluctant to undertake the work of transporting a quantity of petrol and oil to the new site, arrangements were made from Muscat to send down a motor dhow to carry out the task. The dhow returned to Muscat on 14th and reported that the petrol and oil required had been trans ported to the new ground. Squadron Leader Fogarty and the 7 machines of hio Squadron left Muscat for Basrah via Sharjah on the 4th. BRITISH INTKKBSTS . 4. Gable Re-organisation . The Cable Ship ’’Lady Denison pender' arrived from Aden on 9th October. She laid the shore end ol a new cable atcable at the gap to the East of tie agency and left for the Persian Coast on the 12th laying out the cable on her way. It is reported that this new cable was connected to the Jask Karachi cable on the 13th at a spot some ICO miles to the East of the former place and Muscat is now consequently in direct cable communication with Karachi. The Muscat end of the old Jask; cable has been taken up and the remainder which is reported to be old and un serviceable is to be abandoned. Similar action, it is understood, is to be taken at Jask as regards the cables leading in to that station. As a result of this change an extra operator of the Cable and Wireless Limited has arrived and it is expected that an Officer in Charge and another senior Signaller will be shortly transferred from Jask to Muscat. LOCAL INTKRLSTS . 5. His Highness the Sultan returned to Muscat Irora Bombay on the 2nd October. His sudden departure to India on the 31st August about which no previous men tion of his intention had been made, was due to Hxs Highness* s decision to undergo an X-ray examination to discover the cause of some internal trouble which he had apparently developed during his recent tour of the Batinah. The result of the examination which was carried out by some German Jewish refugee doctors in Bombay was most satisfactory - the trouble being found to be not of a serious nature. His Highness spent a considerable time and displayed great pleasure in showing the Political ^gent when the latter called on him a number of X-ray photographs of the interior of various parts of his anatomy. The Sultan announced soon after his return that he would shortly be leaving for Dhofar. In an inter view with the Political Agent, His Highness statedthat the reason for his departure being fixed nearly a month earlier than he had originally intended was due to the fact of the Moghul Steamship Company of Bombay with whom he had arranged to take him to Dhofar not having another steamer available after October for several months. His Highness stated that the Steamship Company was charging Ks. 4000 to divert one of their steamers from their regular Bombay Karachi and Red Sea Ports run to Muscat and take him and some fifty of his followers to Dhofar. The steamer the S.S. Jehangir arrived in Muscat on the 12th and left the same evening for Dhofar with His Highness and 50 of his followers and servants on board. 12 riding horses and some camels were embarked in dhows and left for Dhofar a few days later. In the Sultan*s absence Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal will act as his representative. 6. Reference para 9 of Summary No. 14 of 1935. The dispute between the two uncles of the Sultan was referred to him on his return. His Highness eveidently thought this was a good opportunity of getting rid of Saiyid Hamad with whom he has not been on the best of terms for some time. accordingly public notices were issiued displayed in Muscat and Matrah to the effect that owing to Saiyid Hamad*s ill health he was unable to continue in his office and that the Sultan had been pleased to relieve him as Wali of Matrah by Saiyid Mahmud - another of his uncles# The change will probably be for the good as Saiyid Hamad though a strong character and having a pleasant personality, had been grossly Neglectful of his duties as Wali of Matrah.-4- ^ 7. While a party of prisoners were working on the Muscat- Matrah road on October 15th, two of their number made a dash for freedom* They endeavoured to escape by climbing up the rockey hills overlooking the road but were over taken by the Police guard and refusing to stop in spite of warnings were both shot dead. 8.

Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, the Wali of Matrah returned from Bombay on the 24th September. A dispute, which at one time looked like having serious developments,took place recently between two of the Sultan^ uncles, Saiyis Shahab, the sultan^ representative and Saiyid Hamad, the Wali of Matrah. The latter who had been to Bombay for medical treatment returned to Matrah in the last week of September. On his arrival he issued a public notice announc ing that he had resumed charge of his office. Saiyid Shahab hearing of this, ordered the acting Wali of Matrah to ignore the presence of Saiyid Hamad and to continue in control of the administration of the town. The quarrel between the two uncles for a little time threatened to break out into an actual disturbance but the disputants were persuaded by the Chief Justice of Muscat, Shaikh Zubair bin Ali, to keep the peace until the arrival of the Sultan, who is now investi gating the matter. 10.

GWADUR NEWS . 13o It is reported from Gwadur that numerous pilgrims have arrived there from Sind and Dera Ghazi Khan en route to Mecca. These people are said to be practically desti tute, having no passports or money and many being in rags. Their practice is to obtain a little money by begging in Gwadur and take passages in dhows to remote ports in Muscat territory whence they proceed in other sailing vessels to Mokalla, from which place the majority make their way overland to Mecca. 14. The trade of Gwadur is in a depressed state. Mdcranis who used to buy their requirements from Gwadur now go to Pasni for that purpose in order to save the payment of double duty on their goods (one paid at Gwadur and the other to the Kalat State). Previously no duty was levied by the Kalat State on goods purchased in Gwadur and taken t to the Mekran. 15. The fishing industry on which most of the people of Gv/adur depend for a livelihood is in a poor way this year. In spite of the scarcity of fish, prices in Colombo which is the principal export market, have fallen unexpectedly low and the traders who shipped fish there during the last two months are stated to have sustained considerable losses.

The Imam also sought to use his influence but Sheikh Hilal remained obdurate, demanding (a) the demolition of the offending Ghafiri fort and (b) the surrender of the murderers alluded to. Persuasion having failed, in mid-November the Ghafiri Sheikhs deputed Abdullah bin Rashid al Hashimi of Ibri, Nasir al Kalbani of al Ainain and Sheikh Suliman (above) to propose to Sheikh Hilal the release of the Bani Ghafir prisoners against the demolition of the fort, provided the Sheikh would not persist in his demand for the surrender of the murderers of his followers. Sheikh^Hamad having eventually agreed, the Ghafiri prisoners were released. Thereupon the Ghafiri Sheikhs refuted their part of the agreement. Sheikh Hilal has therefore commenced to build a fort in the close vicinity of the Ghafiri fort with the idea of subduing by force. Meanwhile a two months truce has been arranged between the parties by Suliman bin Senan of Yanqul. 95.
