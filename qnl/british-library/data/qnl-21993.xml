Memorandum . The formality of paying for and obtaining tickets on each occasion when a car uses the Manama-Muharraq Cause way results in delay which, in the case of members of the public, does not matter very much. In the case of R # A»F. cars, vans or lorries, however, a delay of a few minutes might, in certain circumstances, have serious consequences. 2m I suggest that, if the Bahrain authorities concerned see no objection, a monthly fee might be charged for each vehicle using the Causeway. At the beginning of each month the Air Liaison Officer would send a description of the vehicles in respect of which a monthly fee was being paid, and these vehicles would display prominently a roundel bearing the R*A.F. colours. Vehicles displaying this roundel would then be allowed past the barriers at the entrances to the Causeway without being detained. 3* I understand that a somewhat similar arrangement was made with the Defence Officer, and I shall be grateful if the same facilities can be extended to the R.A.F. Poli-wcal Agent, Bahrain.11^ No. SOS/SF ? 3 / »• of 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, 'Bahrain Dated, 18th R/Thani 1361 May 5, 1942. H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. 40 lorandum No. C/560 dated 30th Memorandum:- Reference your April, 1942. I fully appreciate the need for some arrangement for season tickets for R.A.F. vehicles. Monthly season tickets for vehicles using the Manama-Moharraq bridge are available. I enclose a sample ticket. The rates vary according to the type of vehicle and are as follows:- *■ Lorries and buses 1 ton and over Rs.75/- per month. Tourers 30/- ' Station wagons and buses under 1 ton 60/- ' Motorcycles 7/8 ' I would suggest that the season tickets should be carried in the vehicle or pasted on the wind screen in addition to the Roundel so that the date of the expiry of the ticket would be visible. Adviser to the Government. End.... S.Z. pb. I * AVj'N o &gt; C/660 &gt; Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th Kay 1942 To The A ir Liaison Officer, Bahrain. Memorandum. During the recent visit to Bahrain of certain senior R.A.F. officers the car in which they were driving from Muharraq to Manama was delayed for some minutes at the barrier at the entrance to the Cause way while tickets were produced and paid for. In order to prevent the recurrence of delays of this &lt;*/ nature Squadron Leader^Aggapeyef was directed to approach me with the request that R.A.F. cars might be allowed past the barrier without having to stop while tickets were purchased. Free passes are not granted for use of the Causeway, but I wrote to the Adviser, Bahrain Government, asking whether monthly fees could be charged for each R .A.F. vehicle using the Causeway. I enclose for your information a copy of my letter to the Adviser No.C/560 dated 30th April 1942 and of his reply dated 5th May 1942 (with enclos ure in original). 2. I suggest that, if you wish to make arrange ments on the basis now proposed, you should apply to the Bahrain Qovernment for the number of tickets you require. ^ A' r Political Agent, Bahrain.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/290</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/290</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 7/28 Payment of toll gate fees by R.A.F.’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1942/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-07-02T00:06:29</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
