The statement was to be submitted to the India Office and the Government of India, and then to the Treasury for final sanction. The memorandum considers:(a) the present position of 'Arab Chiefs' in the matter of subsidies;(b) the obligations to which the British Government are already committed either by treaty, custom or policy;(c) after deducting the amount that these obligations represent, the manner in which the balance of the provisional sum of Â£100,000 can best be divided among the remaining chiefs, taking into consideration their relative importance, their past and present services, and their capacity to injure or benefit British interests in future.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Kinahan Cornwallis</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rulers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00036a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
