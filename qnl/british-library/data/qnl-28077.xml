His appointment should emphasize British connection, and the Political Resident hopes that in the circumstances the Shaikh will feel satisfied about the matter. I am further to explain that the assessment is being arranged for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of our liabilities v/hich is a matter for concern between the ’Iraq and British Governments, and does not affect the Shaikh, other than indirectly. For this reason it is immaterial from the Shaikh’s point of view whether the assessment is high or low, and therefore the.Shaikh has no ground really for objecting to Mr.Jardine’s nomination.

't/lo 27 u ll •-&gt; -»■ ; • l.Iy dear Humphrys f I have had a long conversation today with the S&amp;aikh,^eding the late gardens, i explained to him that as it was not possible for him to sell all the properties and ^ae sale of some of them would not satisfy ’Iraq, and the treaty had now been ratified, etc., the matter was one which, in our opinion, should be settled between the two Governments. I conveyed to hx-n Muri* s . expression of regret for Hamid Beg’s letters and tnen said tn-.t as a preliminary to a discussion between the ’Iraq and British Governments, it was essential that we should ascertain the extent of our liabili ties, i.e* the taxes payable on the properties; and in order to do +v, is ft wos necessary that assessment should be carried out. At first, the Shaikh objected very strongly to this on the following grounds; he said that, had the negotiations for the purchase of the properties been carried out, as .ias intended by His Majesty’s Government, secretly and without any publicity, he would have nad no objection to an assessment of the properties, to which, similarly, undue publicity need ot have been given. But the Iraq authorities so far from keeping the matter qu^et had ~en it the widest publicity. Hirst of all, thej ad sent o-ders • to the dutasamf to levy revenue; then, they had put an embargo on the export of dates, end it was on_y as a result of our intervention that these measures had been frustrated, . • ' Finally Excellency Bir Francis Humphrys,G.C.VO.,K.G.E.G., H.B.E., H.B.M’s High Commissioner for 'Iraq,out • • » * i -2- (3) ^ina-ily, Nuri Pac. .. • i announced publicly in Basrah that it was the intention of the ’Iraq Government to end this exemptibn, and had no•mated a committee of fxve persons to carry out an assessment of the properties. I believe that, as a matter of fact, some of the persons whom TJuri Pasha nominated refused to act. yho-.v the Wx.ole matter was one of common knowledge and gossip in Basrah, and everyone knew the efforts that ’Iraq were making, and was n.iso aware that up to the present T Tis Majesty’s Govern ment had intervened on tie Shaikh’s behalf. If now it was known, as it would be, that His Majesty’s Government had authorised an assessment, then, everyone would at once jump to the conclusion that the British authorities have yielded and Hurl Pasha had won the day and the Shaikh felt that his personal 'izzat” was involved in the issue. The Shaikh admitted frnakly that it was a question of what he regarded as his personal prestige, and I cannot help feeling a good deal of sympathy w±th him in the matter. The action of the ’Iraq authorities has been not merely tactless, but offensive. Hurl Himself admitted that he had threatened the Shaikh with forcible expropriation in order to bring him to a suitable frame of mind. However, I finally got the Shaikh to agree to an assessment if a representative of yours or a British officer of some sort, preferably an official from Bagndad, was associated wiit. Do you think it would be feasible to arrange this? It seems to rae that Nuri might oe reminded that in Young’s letter flo.P,0.197 of the 2nd September 1930 to Ja’far Pasha, we particularly asked that the negotiations should jsxfc be carried out in-3- Ur out in secrecy and that the emissary should not divulge the nature of his business to any person other than the two Shaikhs and Ja’far Pasha was told that any publicity would be likely to have a dama^in^ effect upon the progress of the negotiations* Jespite this they have _^ven the widest publicity to the matter, and it is entirely on this account that the Shaikh is now making difficulties about the assessment. Secondly, this assessment is bem 0 made with the object of fixing the liability of the Britxsh Govern ment, and it seems not unreasonable therefore to ask that the British Government should be represented on the assessing committee. In the Shaikh’s eyes it would make an enormous difference, since the presence cf a British representative would show the public that the British Government were still interesting themselves in the matter, and the Shaikh considera + hat it would make an entirely different impression on the public mind. I hope therefore that you will be able to 0 et the ’Iraq, authorities to agree to this. I should like you to read through again the letter addressed by Hamid Beg to the Shaikh, of which a copy was forwarded to you under my printed letter No.28_T of 8 th November 1930. The statement contained ~n the first pcrtior of that letter was not made to Hamid Beg alone, I believe, but also to other persons who reported the matter to 'he Shaikh. Anyhow unless Nuri Pasha denies the accuracy of his own emissary’s statement, he has deliberately made a a false statement, and it might be/useful argument to use in getting him to agree to the presence of a British representative on the assessing committee. sd/- H. V, Biscoe.SECRET. u Received under Baghdad P.L.No,3.0.314,dated the 6 th anarch 1931. Telegrams Paraphrased. Ordinary From: The High Gommissioner,Baghdad. To: The Colonial Office,London. Dated; 5th March 1931. Ho. 128. Addressed London; copy by b'ag to Bushire. Recently I have discussed with Colonel Biscoe and NuriEPasha the question of the date gardens owned by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah and, for reasons given by the former, I am satisfied that it is useless for the Government of ’Iraq to attempt to purchase these gardens, since, as Biscoe points out, they now belong to more than a hundred relatives of the Shaikhs, who depend on the produce for their maintenance. The matter therefore becomes one for settlement between the Governments of Great | Britain and ’Iraq, and my suggestion for a solution is on the following lines. The gardens should be re-assessed by the ’Iraq authorities, in the presence of a British official, at a considerably lower rate than the present assessment, and the new assessment should be capitalised. Present assessment of £ 8,800 (the total of both properties) might be reduced by the Government of ’Iraq to say £ 6,000. This sum would be paid annually by the Shaikhs to the ’Iraq Government as revenue, but a lump sum representing the capitalised value of this annual payment would be paid to the Shaikhs on full settlement of their exemption. If the lump sum were shared equally between the Treasury and the Government of India, an approximately equal contribution from all three Governments would be involved, which seems to be not inequitable. Continuance of exemption is contrary to ’Iraq law and is fiercely contested every year in ...in Parliament. Arbitration proceedings,even if acceptable to the Treasury, would be derogatory and the award might well go against His Majesty’s Government. Exemption was originally granted, so I understand, in return for protection of the Persian oilfields, of British interests in Basrah and the Shatt-al-Arab, and of the interests in the Persian Gulf ot the government oi India. 1 have already approved the assessment of the date gardens with the concurrence of Colonel Biscoe.

Karch 1931. Confidential O.No.3.0.344. My a ear Shuckhurgh, Ar ^ I Please refer to my telegram No. 123 of the 5th. Larch on the question of the exemption from ’Iraqi taxation of the date', gardens of the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Luhammerah. As we were unable to come to an agreement last summer in London on this case, it was deciuea that the Iraq Government should make an attempt to purchase the date gardens at a fair market price, which would include the value of the exemption, hy private negotiation. Unfortunate- -ly, these negotiations were sadly muddled hy Nuri Pahha a drew forth a very reasonable protest from the Sheikh of Kuwait and the .resident in the Persian Gulf. I invitea Biscoe to Baghdad in January to discuss the question. We talked over the esse with Nuri Pasha and came to the unan imous conclusion that it was useless to pursue the suggest- -iom made in London that the gardens should he privately acquiredthy the Iraq Government. Biscoe pointeu out that any such attempt would he futile,- if only because the. Kuwait gardens were now owned hy more than one hunderd per- -sons, many of whom depended on their produce for their livelihood. It was therefore suggested that the question of purchase should he definitely drppped and that a re- -assessrnent of the gardens should take place immediately. Biscoe said that he was visiting Kuwait before the end of JanuEEy and would try to obtain the formal concurrence of the Sheikh to the reassessment. He afterwards wrote to me that the Sheikh would have no objection, provided that a British officer was associated in.the assessment, and 1 have-a- have arranged with Nuri Pasha that this should be uone. ^ ^ The idea is that the assessment should he substantially reduced and Nuri Pasha pointed out that the present was a favourable opportunity owing to the low price of* dales. He undertook privately that the new assessment should not, in any case, exceed the sum demanded in Turkish times, which 'lb 9 /* is aboutbelow the present rate, but he said that the rate would have to be reviewed every 5 years in accordance | with the general practice in ’Iraq. This is how the case stands at present. It still remains to decide how the promise of perpetual exemption, which was given by Sir. Percy Cox in 1914, is to be \ fulfilled. His Majesty's Government hold that this is an international obligation which devolves on 'Iraq under the new Treaty. The 'Iraq Government, on the other hand, strongly contest this view. They point out that the exemption is contrary to their law and every year it raises a storm of protest in Parliament during the Budget debate. They say that although the exemption was granted on behalf of His Majesty's Government, in actual practice the 'Iraq Government have had to bear a loss of about £ 30,000 to date. They say that whatever assistance the two Shaikhs may have rendered to the liberation of 'Iraq from Turkish rule has been rewarded by the payment of this sum, and they point out that sir Henry Dobbs omitted in 19£4 to include these exemptions as among the international obligations which would eventually ' devolve on 'Iraq. They hold the view that permanent exemption is an unconscionable arrangement and doubt whether any Govern ment would honour it in perpetuity, even in the case of national heroes. They feel strongly that the services in return for which the Shaikhs were granted this exemption were services rendered to His Majesty's Government in connection« l i Po- -3- with the protection of the Persian oilfields and of their interests in the Persian Gulf, no less'than to the •Iraq. Government, I have given this case most careful considera tion and I feel that it might he possible to reach a final settlement fair to all parties concerned, on the lines contained in my telegram No.128, Under this arrangement the ’Iraq Government would at once accept a reduction of approximately £ 3,000 a year in the assessment, and this would have to he tied up in some way to prevent a subse quent unfair increase. A new assessment of say £ 6,000 per annum v/ould he paid annually by the Shaikhs .to the •Iraq Government. In order to enable them to pay this sum without feeling that their rights had been sacrificed, this sum would be capitalised in any manner which His Majesty’s Government deemed equitable and the lump sum accruing would be shared, I suggest, between the Treasury ana the Govern ment of India. I am aware that this suggestion will be opposed in Inaia, but it seems to me that it can fairly be held that the exemption was originally granted partly in return for services rendered to the Government of India in regard to the preservation of their interests in the Persian Gulf, and it seems to me, as an outsider, to be unfair to expect the Treasury to bear the whole cost. I was informed last summer in London by Sir Percy 0ox that the proposal to grant exemption was originally made by him when he was Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and that the Government of India submitted the proposal to the India Office and afterwards sent him the order to announce the exemption when he had been transferred to Mesopotamia. It will perhaps be argued that the ’Iraq Government should contribute their share towards the lump sum to be paid to the Shaikhs, but I feel that they will stronglystrongly oppose any such suggestion and v.ould have the greatest difficulty in persuading any ’Iraq. Government to accept it. In the case of a deadlock 'being reached on this point, the only solution would appear to he a recourse to arbitration and my own feeling is that such a course, whatever the award might he, would he derogatory to the dignity of His Majesty's Government. I earnestly trust, therefore, that my suggestion, which has of course not been communicated in any form to the 'Iraq. Government, may receive serious consideration as being probably the quickest and least debatable means of settling this extremely awkward case.

Ho official reply has yet been received from the India Office; possibly they are awaiting the views of the Government of India on Humphrys* suggestion,| v/ Our telegram No.116 to Baghdad (copy sent to you with &lt; our printed letter of 23rd March, No.88104/31) was sent at &gt; 1 . 0 jf the suggestion of Waterfield, in order that certain obscurities G.W.

My dear Williams, I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your official letter Mo. 88104/1931 of March 17th about the date gardens of the ShaiJdie of Mohammerah and Koweit, but the subject is a very complicated one and I wanted as far as possible to clear my own ideas on the subject in the hope of being able to submit definite recommendations to my higher authorities here and to get their instructions before taking part in any discussion on the subject in the Middle Sast Official Sub-Committee. I have now looked into the question a little more carefully, but it seems to me that the new proposals -are so unlikely to prove acceptable to the Treasury and the India Office that it is hardly worth calling a meeting of the Sub-Committee to discuss them until v/e know whether those departments are prepared to consider them at all. You do not say in your letter whether you have consulted the Treasury and India Office. It.is possible therefore that you may have been waiting to do so until you knew our reaction; but I am inclined to think that it would be well, before we go any further in the matter, to hear what the Treasury and India Office have to say about the proposal in Humphrys 1 telegram Mo.ikJQ of March 6th, seeing how closely they are concerned. In the absence of any indication of their views it will, I think, be difficult for me to obtain any definite instructions as to the line which I ougnt to take • at the proposed meeting..

CCNFIDENTIA1.B. The Residency, Baghdad, 29th May 1931. V 0 hedule &amp; My Lord, I have tjcte honour to refer to Your Lordship’s telegram No.116 dated the 20th March 1931, and to submit the following report regarding the gardens of the Shaikh of Kuwait in ’Iraq. 2. It is simpler to set out the information regarding the area, taxation and produce in the form of a schedule which I attach as an annexure to this despatch, but in order to answer clearly the question in the telegram under reply regarding the ownership of the gardens, particular of each of the five properties , arranged in order of importance, are set out below: - Name. Area Annual taxable jaribs. va lu e. Rs. 1. if ao .. 6,056 •.• 58,510 2. Faddaghiyah 946 ... 12,510 3. Mutawa’a 670 6,470 4. Kut Khalifa 58 ... 710 5. Kut al Zain 12 ... 100 Total 7.742. 78.300 N.B. - A jarib is 3,967 square metres. 3. The two first named properties are held by numerous members of the family of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and are those referred to in my telegram No.128 dated the 5th of March 1931, as belonging to more than a hundred of the Rt.Hon’ble Lord Passfield,P.C., jretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street,London.S.W.1.5 • • • • the Shaikh’s relatives. These two gardens* together, represent both in area and value over 90# of the whole properties under consideration. The remaining three gardens are presumably those referred to in paragraph 6 of Colonel Biscoe’s confidential despatch No.2*7/T dated the 7th of November, 1930, as belonging jointly to the Shaikh and three other members of his family. They are comparatively small in size. It is the larger estates which dominate the problem, and which in my opinion effectively rule out as impracticable any attempt to purchase then^iy private agreement. 4. The schedule attached gives the detailed informa tion asked for in Your Lordship’s telegram of the approximate annual output in produce in 'value and in kind of each of the five properties, and also the rate and amount at which revenue would have been demanded from them had not the exemption from taxation been operative. In considering the figures of produce and the value of produce contained in the schedule it should be remembered that they are not based upon actuals and can only be relied upon as a rough guide. They cover, for instance, only the date crop, whereas a quantity of grain is also raised on the lands, of which no account is taken in the calculations. Also the conversion of the quantities into cash is complicated by the annual fluctuations in the value of dates. The assessed value of the produce as given in the schedule is based upon the prevailing market prices of the 1930 date-crop. Tnese prices were little higher than half of those which prevailed during the preceding year. Thus, in twelve months the estimated annual value of the produce has dropped from Rs.10 to Rs.5 lakhs, and it is not possible to forecast the future trend of prices.5. Taxation on the Basrah date gardens is at present levied in the form of a fixed cash rate per jarib or unit of area# The rate varies according to the classification of trees in the area ,i.e# there is one rate (Rs.14/10 per jarib} for an area containing a preponderance of full bearing trees, a lower rate (Rs.9/6 per jarib) for partial-bearing trees and there are two other classifi cations of area on which no tax at all is levied. ihe rates are fixed and have not been altered in Basrah for sixty years. The classification ofthe units of area comprising the gardens under the four categories would certainly change whenever a new survey was made on account of the development of the trees in them. Up to 1924, the figure of demand upon the five properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait, prepared upon an inspection made prior to the the British Occupation, stood at the equivalent of Rs*57,857. An inspection and a rough reclassification of the gardens in 1924 raised the amount ot the revenue demand to Rs.78,300 per annum. No reclassification has since been carried out and the amount of assessment remains at that figure. It is important to note that the increase in the revenue demand is not the result of any alteration in the rate, or the basis of taxation, but is consequent upon the natural transition of date bearing trees from one stage of growth to another. 6 # The ’Iraqi Government have reduced the rate of demand on date gardens by 57-J&gt; during the current year because of the abnormal fall in the value of dates. Taking this into account the taxable demand on the properties under consideration during the present financial• • • • -4- finaneial year would be no more than Rs*33 f 278* ihe contemplated change in the method of taxation ol date gardens whereby taxes v/ill not be levied upon a unit of area but upon the produce brought to market, will materially affect the consideration of this problem, and 1 shall be glad to be given an opportunity of discussing this aspect of it during my stay in England* 7 # I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant, (sd.) F.H.HUMPHRYS.

It is, of course, not unlikely that the new law, which appears to be an attempt to shift the burden of taxation from the Iraqi to the foreign merchant, may not be accepted by Parliament, ?&gt;nd may be modified in its passage, but until this fact is known, it would, we suggest be as well to postpone detailed discussion of the High Commissioner^ earlier proposal for the solution of this problem by means of joint contributions by His Majesty* Government and the Government of India.

Je propose to discuss the matter with Sir Francis Humphrys at an early opportunity after his return from Paris. Yours sincerely (Sd.) J.E.W. Flood Will you arrange to bring Biscoe? J.C. Walton, Esq., CB.,MCCOPY. (* CONFIDENTIAL A. The Eeaiaency, Baghdad., 18th September 1931. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your predecessor*s despatch Confidential,dated the 24th of July,1931, on the subject of the date gardens of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. On receipt of that despatch I deemed it advisable to await the report of a committee which had been appointed by the 'Iraqi Government to consider the financial effect of the change in the method of taxation on agricultural produce, consequent upon the passing of the new laws for the collec tion of Istihlak tax and land and water rent. This has now been received and a copy of the relevant portions of it is enclosed herewith. It will be seen that the law relating to land and water rent, which is of a temporary character, providing for a general reduction of 25% on the existing rates, does not materially affect the question at issue,and the main consideration is the Istihlak tax. /' 3 . As stated in paragraph 5 of Sir Francis Humphrys* despatch Confidential B,dated the 29th of May,1931,taxation has been previously assessed on an area of land, viz .the Jarib,but such assessment was based on the produce to be derived from that area, and accordingly,the assessment on areas identical in extent,would vary considerably according to their productive capabilities. 4. The new Istihlak law abolishes the area as the unit of assessment and substitutes the produce, irrespective of the land on which it was grown, as the unit of assessment. Moreover, the commodities do not become taxable at their place of production,but at the place of Istihlak (i.e. consumption in the sense of sale), and any produce actually consumed by the occupiers is,therefore,exempt from taxation. 5 . For the following reasons it is difficult at this stagestage to state definitely what exact effect the new ^ Istihlak law will have on taxation values (a) The ratio 'between the produce to he sold and that to he consumed hy the occupiers must remain a matter for conjecture, (h) The law (Article 4) provides for the tax being 'collected at the places of istihlak where the produce is sold or stores (d) ? or transferred into another shape hy artificial means', hut provision is also made (Article 12) for the persons who pay the tax to deduct it from the 'sale proceeds'• On the assumption that the words 'sale proceeds' mean purchase price paid to the occupiers, this would result in the tax being indirectly levied on them. (c) It is also a matter for conjecture to what extent the person responsible for payment of the tax will in fact exercise his right to recover the tax from the occupiers. It seems improbable that, if he is a middleman or an exporter, he will be able to recoup himself by selling at a higher price, but it cannot be assumed for certain that he will not do so. 6 . The Committee, to which I referred in paragraph 2 above, who have no doubt taken these various factors into consideration, have reached the conclusion that the new method of taxation and collection will have little effect on the total revenue from the sources indicated. .taking dates alone,the committee shew in their report that, whereas the revenue estimate for 1931/32 shewed an estimated revenue collected from dates throughout ’Iraq, under the old system of Rs.l2i lakhs, the estimated revenue, if the new Istihlak law had been applied, would have been Rs*l&amp;*39 lakhs, or a loss of revenue throughout the country of only Hs.10,500. If, therefore, it were decided that the exemption previously enjoyed by the particular lands in question should still obtainf 1 otuain under the new method of taxation, it would seem that the financial benefit, so far as the date gardens in question are concerned, would still approximate to the figures quoted in Sir -erancis Humphrys* despatch referred to in paragraph 3 above. 7. Apart from dates, a certain quantity of grain is raised, but at the moment, I have no information as to the quantity or to what extent it is consumed by the occupiers. Accordingly, I regret that I am not in a position to state the financial effect of the new method of assessment on this part of the produce. I am making enquiries on this point, but I am informed that the proportion of grain to dates is inconsiderable, and I have, therefore, decided not to await the exact figures before reporting on the general question. 8 . The two main questions upon which a decision appears to be required are:- (i) Can the exemption from taxation hitherto enjoyed by the owners of the gardens in question in pursuance of the undertaking given in November 1914 properly be claimed for the produce as distinct from the land? (ii) If so, should the indirect taxation involved in the exercise by the persons who pay the tax, of their right to deduct it from the 'sale proceeds' be regarded as tantamount to the collection of 'revenue or taxes' within the meaning of the original undertaking? I have etc., (Sd.) Hubert Young. ACTING HIGH COMMISSIONER EOR •IRAQ.'''X 6 | Extract from a Confidential memorandum No.0/2540 dated the 19th of August, 1931, from the President of the Committee appointed to draft the Istihlak Legislation, to the Ministry of finance, Baghdad. X XX You will observe that our estimate of revenue which would be collected under the new method is less than the revised estimated revenue under existing methods by ojjly, 1 lakh, but to this must be added the aeliberate remission ^ of Bs.6,32,000/- arising out of the decision to collect as &lt; water-rent and land-rent only 75# of the previous assess ment: this reduction of revenue arises not out of the change of method but out of the considered decision of the Govern- Bjent to lighten the burden of direct taxation. You will observe that of the estimated revenue of 51 lakhs, 32 or rather more than three fifths represent a figure that fluctuates directly with market prices. The revenue derived from land and water rents would also do so if the assessment is stated in terms of kind under Second Amending Law No.54 of 1931, to the Land Tax Assessment Law No.40 of 1929. The organization for the collection of istihlak tax will of course require time and experience to perfect and for the first year or two it is possible that collections will be rather less than they should be. XXX Com putati on of Istihlak Tax on Dates. The date ration for jail population is 1 lb. per aay. This is probably more than the average free man consumes. We may assume as a conservative figure for average consumption per head of date consuming but non date produc ing population to be 1/12 kilo per day or 30 kilos p.a. IfIf we accept total population to 1)6 3-g millions* of whom we may assume 1 million, mainly from Northern Liwas who do not consume dates and 1 million as drawing supplies direct from gardens and not 'buying through 'bazaars, we have It million as date consuming population whose supplies will 'be taxable. One and a half million at 30 kilos per annum gives consumption of 45000 tons p.a. Value at £s.35/- per ton. Bs.15,75,000. Tax at 10# rt 1,57,000. That this is a conservative figure is pointed to 'by following: Export in 1930/31. 1,56,000 tons. At least 80# of dates exported are grown in Basrah Liwa .Revenue demand 1930 in Basrah Liwa is slightly less than half demand for whole country (Actuals Basrah - 9,77,000 Iraq, - 19,76,000). Incidence in Basrah ana average for remainder of ' Iraqt is roughly the same, perhaps very slightly less in Basrah. If Basrah production be 150000 tons, we can take production in remainder of 'Iraa to be about 1,30,000 tons. Total production is therefore estimated at 280000 tons of which 156000 was exported leaving 120000 tons for local consumption. We have estimated date consuming population whose supplies will be taxable as equal to population draw ing supplies direct from gardens (the former will be, if anything, greater) 45000 tons does not then appear a high estimate for consumption of population whose supplies are taxable.————cm mi- - t , _ 1 j 1 c*&gt; SUMMARIZED STATEMENT SHOWING ANTICIPATED EINANCIAL EFFECT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS FOR THE COLLECTION OF ISTIHLAK TAX AND FOR THE COLLECTION OF LAND RENT AND WATER RENT IN 1951-1932. • Actuals Bulgetted .Revised fievenue ~1930-31 1931-32^ Estimate , from Istihlak Tax on exported produce • Revenue from Istihlak Tax on produce consumed in the country.

I am sending you a note on the probable effect of the new ’Iraq law of w Istihlak ft or 'Istihlah', as the Shaikh says it should be called, as far as it concerns the Kuwait date gardens on the Shatt al-Arab. t 2 . The note embodies, as far as I have been / able to remember them, most of the points raised by the \ Shaikh in his recent conversation with you. 3 * In one or two places, I have enlarged somewhat on what the Shaikh said, to make things clear. 4 . I apologize for the length of the note, but in this important matter, justice to Kuwait appears to me to be the paramount consideration, and everything is justifiable I think, which helps to throw light on the Kuwait point of view. % ; The Hon’ble Lieu tenant-Colonel H.V.Biscoe, I*A., Political Agency, Kuwait. Dated 21st November 1931. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bus hireCONFIDENTIAL. &lt;&amp; Note on a conversation which the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had with the Shaikh of Kuwait on 25th October 1931 regarding the new f Iraq K 'Istihtah' tax, with special reference to the effect Krwwt-^. such tax wilJL have on the Kuwait properties on the Shatt al-Arab, if it were enforced. In the course of a general conversation on this subject and in reply to several questions put by the Bon'ble the Political Resident, the Shaikh made the following points. Under the old system, a garden owner had to pay his tax according to the number of w jaribs w he owned, and not according to the number or size of his date trees. This shortly was the system in force in Turkish times in Basrah . In the Muntafik aid some other Liwas, the system was different, and a tax was levied on each date tree, a garden owner possessed and to encourage, the owner to cultivate the ground under the trees, which improved the country side and incidentally the palm-tree tteelf, a reduction was made in the rate of tax taken per tl*e tree in accordance as the garden was 'ainar n (cultivated) or 'kharab' (uncultivated). In Basrah therefore if a man had a large garden and a small area under dates he stood to lose as compared to the man who had a small or even similar sized garden which was all under dates. It was the discontent caused by the above system which probably brought the new proposed tax into Ihe sphere of practical politics. Actually there was method in the Turks madness jot behind the idea was the desire to encourage landlords who were careless garden owners like the'Saadun* families to put down an increased number of date- trees each year, by penalizing the man with a large area and few trees in favour of the man who took the -fewfa trou ble to grow the maximum number of trees possible on his plot of land. 2. When asked how the collection of the new tax would work in the case of an ordinary garden owner who lived on his property, the Shaikh replied that as far as he understood the proposed new law which he had read, the garden owner would, after cutting down his dates, put what he, his family and fellahee^fn required for their own personal use, on one side. This would not be subject to taxation. The balance he would oot£ect on his 'sif' i.e. the river bank, until he could find a buyer. Such buyer coming along, would pay cash down for what he bought, and remove the dates, either for export by dhow or steamer. As such buyer would eventually have to pay the 'ashur' or 10 % government date tax, he naturally would deduct this amount from the price paid df the dates, Le. the market price, which each year is fixed by a committee for the whole of the Basr£t date area, and would still further have to allow for his own profit, after deducting carriage expenses to dhow or ship, packing etc. etc. It was of course the buyers business also to keep in touch with the Customs authorities take out necessary documents, aid pay the 'Ashur' tax. The garden owner had no responsibility in this direction at all. Should on the other hand, the garden owner in question be faced with a bad year, and be unable to find a buyer at all, then his produce remained with him, and was either thrown into the river, or sold fora song^pxl^e to wandering shepherds, Bedouin or other migrating elements, who during the date season are usually to be found camped on the desert side of gardens seeking what they can pick up cheap, or steal. The garden owner in this case pays nothing-3- to Grovenunent and the latter loses the 'Ashur' from his dates* V ^ tax due 3* The Political Resident then asked the Shaikh how he thought the new law would work if applied to the five great Kuwait properties situate on the lower reaches of the Shatt al-Arab. The Shaikh without hesitation replied that it would fall harder on himself than, if he had to pay the U/VC^sC Kr iVuH' * ordinary n jarib' taxation, as 4. vtfhen asked to explain how he arrived at this conclusion, the Shaikh pointed out (a) That he was not in the same position as the resident garden owner, for he was both an absentee landlord, and worse, resided outside ’Iraq. Actually he employed only M fellahs w (or gardeners) in the gardens and these were the only persons who resided there. Hence under the new law only these resident fellaheen would be entitled to take their share of dates free of taxation, while he and the remaining 100 branch families of the al-Subah who resided in Kuwait would presumably have to pay the n Ashur rt taxation on the large stores of dates, garden produce, fruit, wood, palm fronds, barley, fodder, lucerne grass etc. etc. which was annually brought to Kuwait for their own use, under the plea that they had been exported from the garden areas, and also out of ’Iraq. In this connection the Shaikh pointed out that the amounts brought to Kuwait by himself did not merely include that share of the ^rdens produce which he and the 100 junior families of the al-Subah (numbering some 1000 souls, I suppose) had a right to, in their capacity as joint shareholders in the estates, but included the annual free food ration of his body-guard and paid ’’fidawi' land forces numbering some 500 men who with their families allii) -4- received half their pay in kind and half in cash. The former apart from rice (obtained in India) was practically all obtained from the produce of his Shatt al-Arab estates. (b). Again,in the matter of the date produce which the Shaikh ' exported ” overseas to India, the Red Sea, Zanzibar etc., the Shaikh pointed out that he came under a different category to tin ae4^h^e*¥4&amp;g ordinary garden owner of Basrah or the well known Arab and European merchants who annually bought up and exported dates from Basrah seeing that in a sense he was both owner and exporter. And while the latter both Arab and Europeans purchased direct from individual garden owners and paid cash down for the produce, he as Shaikh of Kuwait sold nothing to these exporting merchants but instead dealt with his own merchant! of Kuwait who nearly all owned regular fleets of dhow,'East Indian men' which made annual voyages to eilher India, the Red Sea, East Africa or Zanzibar, taking as outward cargoes Basrah dates, and bringing bade ship-loads of wood^beams, spices, rice, building material etc. The system under which this export business was conducted was as follows;- The Shaikh, #10 it must not be forgotten runs his state on our old feudal lines,annually and before the dates are ripe sends for his leading Kuwait merchants (largely also pearl dealers) and enquiries if any of them will take up cargoes of dates from his estates. The res ponse is generally good, aad that part of the produce of the gardens previously earmarked for overseas expor t, is now sold to these local merchants. The method of sale is as follows:- The dates are sold by ihe gosara (basket) at the6 rate prevailing at Basrsii, but no cash passes hands , instead the buyers sign documents promising to pay the Shaikh his money, after one, two or three voyages (i.e.years) as the oase mcy be and only after they have disposed of their return cargoes• These signed documents are deposited with the Shaikh, who recovers his money gradually, and by a method which bears easily on his merchant and keeps his overseas dhow trade alive. Under this method fthow captains on behalf of their principals do the actual trading and with the money’which they realize from the sale of the dates they carry, they buy their return cargoes* In bad trading years as at present return cargoes fetch little, and often merchants have to ask the Shaikh fbr an extention of the period of repayment* The latter naturally assists more often than not for his policy is literally to he the 'father of his people'. 5. Taking therefore the above two systems (paragraph 4 (a) and (b) for dealing with the produce of his date gardens in ’Iraq, it was clear, the Shaikh pointed out, that he himself would have to find tie 'Ashur' tax both in the case of: - (a) Dates and garden produce exported to Kuwait for state purposes. (b) Dates exported to foreign countries by Kuwai t dhow owner s • In the fomer case, because,according to the letter of the law, the goods would be taxable he being the exporter of the produce, and in the latter case because the-actual exporters (the dhow owners) would not be paying for the dates till aJL they return from India etc* and had disposed of their return cargoes. They would naturally expect the Shaikh to pay the ’Iraq date-tax on the top of the credit he had given, they promising to pay same back on settlemait day.-6- tiation with tte ♦Iraq Gove mxnent that the produce sent to Kuwait (for family and state use) paragraph 4(a) shculd be exempt from taxation, the Shaikh pointed out that much irritating accounting and checking by officials at both end* would be involved, and he did not see how in any case, he could avoid having to deposit large guarantee sums to the various ’Iraq officials in control, which would only be released after documents had been received from Kuwait to say that the goods had arrived. The conforming to such cumbersome and irritating methods before he could get the produce of his own gardens to Kuwait was in the view of the Shaikh unthinkable, especially as it would lay Kuwait open to the danger of perpetual demends from rapacious junior ’Iraq officials for largesse etc. Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.

IfV question of the date gardens of the &gt;he i kn s of Luwa i t a nd Mohamme rah• The following were present!- Mr. Flood ; (In the Chair). Mr. Hall i4r. James. ) Colonial Office. Mr. Baxter Mr. Anderson. Mr. Walton. Mr. Trickett. Sir Francis Humphry a. ) India Office. Foreign Office. Treasury Mr. Flood explained that in March last Sir Francis Humphrys had proposed a settlement on the following liness- The date gardens to be re-assessed by the Iraqi authorities at a lower rate than the existing rate. This sum would be paid annually to the Iraq Government by the Sheikhs as revenue, but a lump gum representing the capitalised value of the new assessment would be paid to the Sheikhs in full settlement of His Majesty’s Government’s liability under their pledge of 1914. On the supposition that the Iraq Government would reduce the existing assessment from £ 8,800 to £6,000, the capitalised value of the Sheikhs* exemption on the basis of 20 years* purchase would be £120,000. If this sum were shared equally between Hie Majesty’s Government and the Govermaent of India, taking into account the sacrifice of revenues by the Iraq Government, an approximately equal contribution would have been made by all the three Governments concerned. In actual fact, the Iraqi Govern* ment had since reduced as a temporary measure the assessment on {m • athe date gardens by 57^ per cent, i.e. to about £ 3,747. The Government of India had refused to admit that any part of the expenditure in connection with the date gardens should be debited against Indian revenues, pointing out that this exoendit any part s expenditure would be directly connected with the war and that all war expenditure jutaide India was borne by Hia Majesty's Government* the Indian government only making a lump sum contribution of £ 100 ,000, GOO. The Treasury,on the other hand, would only make a contribution irom Imperial funds on the understanding that the Indian Government would make an equal contribution. ..lea nwhile, the situation had been complicated by the impending introduction of two new laws, the effect of which will be to abolish the revenue taxes on dates and all agricultural produce and to substitute what is called an Istihlak tax and a water rent. The question now to be considered was in what manner, if at all, these new laws affected His Majesty's Government's liability under its pledge of 1914. It was explained that the Istihlak tax abolished the area as ^ a unit of assessment and substituted the produce, which will not become taxable at the place of production, but at the place of 'Istihlak' (i.e. consumption in the sense of sale). This means that the middleman or exporter will pay 10 per cent on what he buys or exports. Any produce consumed by the owner in the country of origin will be free of tax, but any dates exported to Kuwait or Mohammerah for consumption by the owners of the gardens resident in those territories would probably be liable to the export tax. The effect on the surplus dates for export or sale was difficult to foresee. In theory the producer would be exempt from tax, but in practice it was probable that the middleman or exporter would pass on to the producer part or whole of the ourden in the form of0 f a reduction in the purchase price. The Iraq Government were at present finding difficulty in securing markets for their dates abroad, and, in consequence, the tendency wo'old be to pass on the incidence of the tax to the producer rather than to the ultimate purcha se r« It therefore appears that under the new laws the owners of the date gardens if they live in Iraq would be exempt from tax on the dates which they themselves consumed, but would pay indirectly part or whole of the 10 per cent. Istihlak tax on surplus dates sold or exported. The proportion between the two classes of dates is not at present known, but it seemed clear that the Sheikh of Mohammerah would be very little better off, since practically the whole of the produce of his date gardens in Iraq was sold or exported. Moreover, the Sheikhs would pay water rent which was estimated at about £3,000 per annum. The meeting then discussed the question of referring the matter to arbitration. Apart from the invidious position in which His liajesty^ Government would be placed by taking such a matter to arbitration, the chief objection to this method of settlement was that in the event of an adverse award, His 'Majesty’s Government might find themselves faced with the payment of a very large sura of money which, in view of the Indian Governnt * s attitude, would fall entirely on Imperial revenues. Although the Law Officers had advised that if the matter were taken to arbitration there was a reasonable prospect of success, the result was clearly uncertain and the Treasury were not prepared to adopt this solution unless the Indian Government would give an assurance to p^y a moiety -f ^.y compensation in the event of an adverse a.vard. Sir Francis Humphrya explained that the direct negotiations authorised last summer between the Iraq Government and the Sheikh of Kuwait had failed completely. This was due in the first place to the tactics employed by the Iraqi Prime Minister, but there wa s &gt;ewas reason to believe that in any case this nethod would have proved fruitless. Sir Francis Humphrys went on to explain that the time factor had now become important. The exemptions from revenue hitherto accorded to the Sheikhs are contrary to Iraq law and every year nave raised a storm of protest in the Iraqi Parliament. Year by year this protest had grown in strength and increased pressure by the High Commissioner had been necessary. Last year it was with the very greatest difficulty that a further year’s exemption had been secured and the Iraqi Prime ’inister had since said that it would be impossible to retain the exemption in this * year’s budget. The debate on the budget will take place next month. It was suggested that it night be possible to get the Iraqis to maintain the status quo until the effect of the new laws had been ascertained. Sir Francis Humphrys considered, however, that there was no hope of this. He recapitulated the arguments used by the Iraqis in support of their refusal to continue the exemp tions, the chief of which is that they have already lost a sum of about £80,100 in honouring the pledges given by His Majesty’s Government. It was generally agreed that the Iraqi arguments would be difficult to overcome. The meeting further agreed that it would be difficult to main- tain the position that it would be proper to inform the Sheikhs that as the new laws would abolish the land tax, His Jajesty's Government were absolved from all obligations under their 1314 ( pledge • The remaining solution of the problem, therefore, seemed to be a composition of His Majesty's Government's liability by payment of a lump eum on the lines suggested by Sir francis Humphrys la st &gt;e T , the meeting indicates that the budget A telegram ^^/^/e^ller than the 1st February, 1932. debate will take place not edruer{ 'll 4 ™. . li The Ba &amp;J®atlon 'JK.6 made that any settlement must take account ot the possibiUty tna t the Iraq Governaent mi^t in the future (a) re-l«poee some form of direct land tax and or ( b) raise the water rent. Ae xc^cirus (a) air Francis H-iinphrys thought that the Iraqi Government would do its beat to avoid this as the land tax had been repealed for political reasons and its re-imposi ti on would be extrertely unpopular. In regard to (b), Sir Francis Humphrys thought that ne might sound the Iraqi Government with a view to ascertaining whether they would be willing to give a guarantee not to raise xor a period oi twenty years the water rent and any direct taxation payable on the gardens after the abolition of the land tax. It was, however» doubtful if the Iraqi Government would be prepared to give such an undertaking, though they would almost certainly agree that the taxes to be levied upon the Sheikhs* gardens should only be increased or reduced in the same proportion as the taxes on the gardens of other landowners of the district. The Iraoi Government might therefore be asked to undertake that, in matters of taxation the Sheikhs should receive treatment not leas favourable tnan other landowners in tne Vilayet of Basra (to see equal treatment with the whole of Iraq might be inequitable, as conditions vsry considerably in the different districts, which from time to time demand special treatment, • It Bt would, of course, have to be made clear in the terms of settlement that His Majesty’s Government would' be aosolved from all liability past, present and future under their pledge of 1914. In the circumstances Sir Francis Humphrys thought that the only present liability to be commuted was the water rent amounting to about £3,000 per annum, and any other similar direct tax on the land. There was, however, the risk of the imposition by the Iraqi Government of fresh taxation, and there was the risk increase in existing taxation, and these points would have of an to be taken i !taken into account in fixing a r*=a onnc,^ n d rea sono ble figure ae a composition of all Hie JSajeety'a Govern.aent'e future liebilitiee under the 1914 pledgee. Sir Francie Humphrye eventually suggested that on hie return to Baghdad he should disc use the matter with the Iraq Prime ]&amp;niater and ob tain all possible inf or ma tl on about tlie effect of the new laws etc. On receipt of this information the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government would a rre on a ixgure which would be a fair composition of His Majesty's Government's liability, and the taek of negotiating a settlement # on the agreed lines would then be entrusted to the Resident in the Persian Gulf in respect of Kuwait, and His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran in respect of Mohaimoerah. Mr. «7al ton explained that the India Office would feel bound to obtain the views of the Indian Government on the proposed terms of settlement as, although the Indian Government refused to accept any financial liability in the natter, they nevertheless held | j jf- themsel ve 3 *re aponsi ble for safeguarding the interests of the Sheikh’ of Kuwait and must be given an opportunity of commenting on any proposal that would affect hie interests. The meeting finally agreed that an endeavour should be made to find a permanent solution on the lines of Sir Francis Humphry s' suggestion and decided that as a preliminary step a telegram should be despatched to the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq asking whether the new laws had yet come into force and requesting particulars of all taxes (including water rent) that would be levied on the date gardens. Mr. *#lton agreed that it was not necessary to repeat this telegram to India, but he asked that copies of the new laws should be sent to the Indian Government for their information. Mr.Trickett M * Hote by Sir Francis Humphrys . 'I a m personally of the opinion that it would be a mistake to negotiate a settlement with the Sheikhs, unless this means informing them tactfully of the decision of His Majesty's Government in the matter'. If IV v Mr. Triokett wished to make It quite clear that he saw considerable difficulty in supporting a provision in the Vote for making a payment of this kind# especially one of ?o large an amount as he gathered was in the minds of some of those p re sent; he regretted that the Government of Indie* still maintained tneir refusal to share the responsibility; and for these reasons tae vtfiole matter would inevitably have to be re submitted to tne Chancellor of the Excheqjer•'jy£ Telegram from tne acting Higii Comraisoioner for Iraq to the Secretary of Jtate for the Colonies, doted 27th October.

Humphry a night be asked to include in the information vtfiich he is going to obtain about the effect of the new laws, ( l) Article 9 of the law for the collection of land produce duty provides for the fixation of prices of land produce. Does this mean(a) the prices paid by the viiolesaler to the cultivator or ( b) the prices charged by the former to his customers or both? If (a), clearly the producer has no means of recouping himself for the tax (if passed on to him by the wholesaler) by raising his prices. (2) Do the words 'sale proceeds' in Article 12 mean the purchase price paid to the producers? (This point was raised in paragraph 5(b) of Major Young’s despatch of 18th September 1931» Confidential A). (3) Article 12 says that the persons who pay the tax 'shall be authorised to deduct' it from the sale proceeds* In paragraph 5(c) of Major Young’s despatch referred to above he raises the question whetner the person responsible for payment will in led exercise his right to recover the tax from the producers* ^ajor Young vyar says that it cannot be assumed for certain that the taxpayer will not recoup himself by selling at a higher price( instead of passing the t ax back to tne producer). It appears, however, that lie would be prevented from recouping himself in this way by the fixation of prices under Article 9, if the prices there referred to a re the prices charged by the wholesaler or middleman to Y ^ r s a °“rlly. i 16 To Sd.

Dear Sir Francis, w ,id3 , , ft)' ft' We have received siccoe‘B despatch of the 6th of December enclosing a note by Dickson regarding the effect of the new 'latihlalr* Tax upon the shaikh of Kuwaitis properties in the Shatt-el-Arab. Die&amp;son's note makes rather depressing reading; but it occurs to me that there may be the gem of a settlement in Hie last paragraph of his note. if the Shaikh of Kuwait were not an absentee land -lord, and if he and his entourage lived in his estates in Iraq, then the Iraqi Government co ild only oollect tax upon that portion of the produce which was not consumed on the estates. Gould it not be represented to the iraqA Govern ment that it is scarcely fair that the Shaikh should suffer and the Iraqi Government benefit from the fact that he and his household live not on those estates but in Kuwait. Even if this argument is not watertight, and admittedly it is not, might it not provide the iraqi Government with some sort of excuse to justify granting to the shaikh a generous measure of exemption. if the Iraqi Government could be induced to exempt from tax such part of the produce o* tne t&gt;haikh‘s estates as is needed for family and iitate use in Kuwait (i.e. , that portion not used for sale or export xrom Kuwait) , and could be persuaded to fix the amount oi pio- duce covered by the exemption at a generously high figure, then possibly only a small balance would be left liable to tax/ Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Humphrys, G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., K.J3.i5. , C.i.Ke,- 2 - © , |V' tax, and it is conveivable that hie Matty's uoverrane^T mieht llnQ 80rne way of compensating the bhaikh financially in respect of the ta* that remains to he paid. xhe figure of exemption would, however, need to be fixed for a number of years. ibe Iraqi Government do not seem to be so much concerned • wi th the financial loss to their treasury as with justifying that loss the Iraqi Parliament, and the above suggestion, which is pmt forward wholly tentatively as it has not yet been discussed with the other interested Departments here, might concievebly provide the iraqi Government with the means of doing this. .Perhaps you would turn over this suggestion in your mind, and if you think that it might possibly pro vide a basis of settlement you may think fit to sound the Iraqi Government informally on the subject, if you do this it wo^ld be advisable not to mention the possibility of Hie Majctty’s Government providing any financial com pensation to the tfhaikh, xourssincerely, SD/ J. hathorn hall.( /-vJwj ^ /V.

The Keeidency, Baghdad, Jith January My dear Flood, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter «o. dated the 11th of ueceiaber 1931, forwarding a copy of a letter from Walton of the india 011 ice, regarding the revenue exemption of the ahaikha of Mohammerah and Kuwait. My enquiries into the effect of the new istihlak law upon the problem are not yet complete, but sufficient information already exists from which to answer Waltoon's queries. They appear to arise out of a belief that the fixation of prices for land produce, which is ordered in Article 9 of the law, is an attempt by Govern ment to control buying or selling prices in the market. This however is not the function of Article 9. The figure which is to be fixed is only an index price for taxation purposes. The system of notifying a conversion rate, in order that Government demands on produce may be turned into terms of cash, is already in force, buyers ana sellers are in no way bound to deal at this rate, or indeed at any fixed rate. Article 12 authorising persons whft pay the tax to recover it from the sale proceeds ie inserted in the law because, by Article 11, the tax is payable by the owner of licensed premises to which the produce is brought for sale or store. The payer of the tax 4 0U -Ld. therefore frequently not be the owner of the produce and would lit ea to recover it when the goods are disposed of. The article gives him legjLl power to recover the araount he has paid to Government as tax from the proceeds of the sale when it takes place. There is of course no compulsion upon ary taxpayer to xkxbu recoup himself in any particular way and he may pass the tax back to the producer, or pass it on the ultimate consumer, as circumstances may dictate.

Sir Prancie Humphrys has recommended that the Shaikh should pay this export tax on the winter produce and leave the main issue to be fought out on the major question of the date orop, which has not yet been subjected to ' , Istihlak ,, tax. Xhe Shaikh on the other hand has forwarded a statement showing that while the winter produce ig of course small compared to the summer, it is by no means insignificant, and contends that whether the amount is large or small a definite question of principle is involved, and that the levy of thie tax is a i definite breach of the undertaking given to him by His Majesty’s Government that these gardens should be free of taxation* 2» I would submit that there is much justification for the Shaikh* s view, and would most strongly urge that an early • • • • ajesty 1 ! Secretary of State for the CoUniee, The Colonial Office,- 2 . early deel• ten should bs taken regarding this question, which has been under consideration for two years now and the issues of which are really very simple. 7e gare the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah definite promises that the proper, ties belonging to them in 'Iraq should be free from all taxation* Owing perhaps to a misunderstanding this obliga tion was not included among the other financial commitments that the 'Iraq Gorernment were compelled to assume and they hare consistently protested against the liability. It is, I submit, obviously incumbent upon His Majesty's Government to honour their bonds, and there are two ways of doing sox either to compel the 'Iraq Government to continue this exemption, or to pay the taxation on the gardens themselves by capitalising the sum involved. The fact that the 'Iraq Government have changed the form of taxation in no way releases us from our liability (though it may of course affect the sum involved) so long as that tax falls either directly or indirectly on the owners of the gardens. The Shaikh can and does claim that he holds the definite promise of the British Government that his gardens shall be free from all taxation, and this promise, I submit, it is in cumbent on His Majesty’s Government to fulfil. If the 'Iraq authorities are now allowed to levy any tax on properties, the principle will have been adraicted, and the Shaikh will, in my humble opinion,be able to charge ua with a breach of faith* 3. In the discussions which have taken place up to the present it 1». been generally assumed that «re are not now in a position to eompol the ’Iraq Government to continue this sxemptlon, and that the only solution is for the liability #. s oQonfid»ntl»l.

Under (b) he would probably object to the 'subsidy*, and though the offer might be wrapped up in some way go as to sooth his tyao ur propre » there would still remain a lever with the ’Iraq Government to say that in any particular year Kuwait had not done its best to stop smuggling and so the 'eubaidy* was not due* Nevertheless the attitude of the finance Minister does give gome hope that a means may bs found for dealing with this difficult aspect of the question. .whichever scheme wac adopted the amount of the 11. dates for the personal use of the owners living in Kuwait would have to be calculated. The Shaikh could perhaps be persuaded to put this at a reasonable figure, and the consumption per head might be worked out on the figures given in the confidential memorandum of 19th August 1931 (Comput- -ation of Istihlak tax on dates) which formed an enclosure to the Acting High Commissioner for ’Iraq's letter of loti; September 1931 to the Colonial Office, at 1 pound per .^n per day.

Produce used fcy the cultivator or owner is not taxed at all. *hen produce is sold in ’Iraq, the istih- -lak tax is paid oy the purchaser, not by tne seller, and no taxation would fall to be paid by the Shaikh upon produce of his gardens sold in ’Iraq* It is true that the amount oi the tax would be reflected in the price paid by the purchaser, but the effect of it upon the Shaikh would be indirect only. It does not seem feasible or proper to ask the ’Iraqi Government to except the marketed produce of the Shaikh’s gardens from this form of taxation, or for his Majesty’s Government to accept liability for the drop in sale receipts thereby occasioned. 4. It does,however, seem fair that he should be exempted from the payment of istihlak tax upon the produce of his gardens exported from 'Iraq for his owa use, ana to regard this taxation as coming with- -in the scope of the 1914 promise. This repre- -sents taxation directly payable by the Shaikh from which he can claim exemption. The tax is in etieot and export tax upon produce, and not upon the garuens I themselves, but a good case can be put up for the Shaikh's claim to Immunity from it. The advent of the revised system of taxation of the shaikh’s exempwuu, the law putting the revised basis into force was possible for the Hi the High Commission to prevail upon the3. the f Iraqti Oovernment to refrain from Issuing aemand notices upon the properties of the Shaikh, although it has been increasingly difficult each year, and the resistance of the 'Iraqi Government haa atiffeneu^i.each succeeding request. *hen teiegram Ko339 dated the 9th of June, 1932, was received from tue Hon'ole the Political Hesiaent, x*usuire, stating that the Customs autnorities of the 'Iraqi Government were demanding istihlak tax upon the produce of the Shaikh's gardens before permitting its export to Kuwait, the matter was immediately taken up with the 'Iraqi Government through the Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, hut it soon became apparent that the 'Iraqi Gov- -ernment was taking the view that it %as not pos- -sible to exempt this produce from istihlak tax without an amendment to the law, and that there was every intention of insisting upon payment being mace. Subsequent discussion with the Minister of Finance and the Irime Minister has emphasised this fact, and it was clear that the problem was coming to a head, but tnat no useful action could be taken until it had been decided to apply the revised method of taxation to the date crop, it had been .decided not to apply it to this year's date crop, air i’ranole Humphrys would aave oaen satis -fled to acquiesce in the comparaUvel&amp;fflall aBlount of exported winter produce toeing autojectea to the LtlfcUk tax, and to press for demand notices upon the gardens to toe witheld as heretofore.IX' 4 . 6. A notifioation has, however, now been pub- -lished ordering the date crop for the current year to be placed under the istihlak system, and action to deal with the whole question is now necessary. has teen established that there is no means where- -l&gt;y the produce of the shaikh of Kuwait, or of the Shaikh of Mohammarah, can be exported from ‘Iraq free of payment of tax without legislation and that such 1 Gc^islcition uill not bo onactod* I undorstand that dir Francis Humphrys intends to discuss with you certain proposals he has cdrawn up, whereby the ’Iraqi Government and His Majesty’s Government should co-op -erate in compensating the Shaikh of Kuwait for the loss which the withdrawal of the exemption will en- -tail, and for compensation to he paid by His iiajestyls Government to the Shaikh of Mohammerah on similar grounds. 7. With regard to the contents of the despatch from the Hon’hie the Political resident, Bushire, I think that I need only point out that the High Com- -mission has no power to compel the ’Iraqi Government to accord the exemption, and the efforts of the High Commission have consistently been directed to the protection of the Shaikh from any action by the ’Iraqi Government which infringed upon his revenue exemption. This however, could not be continued for ever, and the introduction of the istihlak tax has so changed the situation that the time for measures of expediency has passed. It is5. It is clear that Hig Majesty’s CJovernment must take suitable measures to obtair compensation for both the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Shaikh of Mohammerah for the immunity from taxation which they were promised, which they have for so long enjoyed, and which His Majesty’s Government are no longer able to secure for them by the means which have been applied in the past* &lt;3* I aiu aeuaing a copy of onis aesp&amp;tch to the Hon* ole the lolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf* I hr.ve the honour 10 be, A Ir hir, lour most obedient, bumble servant, ad/- S.H.

The Treasury took the riew that th. new tax (the Istihlak tax) was not cowered hy the undertaking given in 1914 to the Sheikhs, who had, therefore, no claim that, in allowing this tax to be levied upon the produce of their date ger e ;«. Hi* Majeety* e Qoverment was breaking faith. The jovensaent of India and the India Office held the opposite opinion that the ietlhlak tax wae covered by the pledge, and that if the Sheikhs were compelled to pay it th y sh.uld receive full financial ewnp.ne.tion, and apparently th. Cov.rnm.nt of India took the extreme view that the Sheikh. should b. guaranteed in perpetuity against all taxation on th. lands or th. produce thereof. • position which could hardly be eu.taln.d seriously a. such a promis. mm*/w*« totally impoRslbla of fulfllmont. It would bo moreover, th»t tho •ug««»tion vns mndt that if any payment waa to ba rnada, Hia ^ajoaty’a Govermant should bear it* India not contributing ona ativar# me JL^ia l Position. 3. Sir Franoia Huraphrya aaid it waa important to bear in mind what wtra tha intent!ona of the officara who gaYe tha undertaking to tha Sheikha• They ware servants of tha GcYern^ent of India and, at such, ware wall *equiiinted with tha grants of immunity from taxation known in India as •Jaglrs'. There are other jagir* in Iraq* e.q.* that of the Kaqib. £one of tha holders of these j&amp;glrs receives any privilege under the iatihlak lawj in point of fact everybody now has a Jagir. It waa quite oertain th-1 the Sheikh of Koweit knew that eomething had happened which aarioualy weakened his caae. Sir ifrancia warned tha meeting against supposing thet the iatihlak tax was merely s different machinery for taking the same amount. It was estimated th*t ths Iraqi Govern ent would in fact lose sows 25 lakhs by the change. If the Sheikhs or their dependants consumsd the dates in Basrah they need pay no tax whatsoever. In his opinion, therefore, ths Shsikhs had no logs! elal® to compensation. 4. Hr .Beckett took the same view. He felt strongly thst the undertakings of 1^14, the texts of * ^ ch ® re b.far. tb« ■••tingi c.ulrt not l.*.ai y b. h.ld to apply to • fx of th- pr...nt typo. if It «fcoul&lt;J hopp.n thot th. of foot of the to* in pr.ctlc# w«» ®«« h spm9 *• th8t of • lo«4 t«.

Ha fait, tharafora, that, apaaklng from tha purely legal point of ▼lew, the undertaking* of 1914 put ua under no obligation either to eeoure the exemption of the Sheikh* from the #per*tion of the letihlak ta* or to pay them oompeneatlon for ite imposition* 5* Mr*Beckett pointed out that even though there might be no legal liability so long as Iraq retained the istlhlak system, it was possible that a land tax might ba reintroduced, in which case the legal liability would once more arise* It was, therefore, important that any payment now mad# should be in final liquidation of all the 1914 undertakings, so that they might net again ba inrokad in any eventuality. 6. Br.Trickett agreed, saying that he had previously advanced the view that under the law it uo* stood there was no present liability arising out of the undertaking, and therefore no case for a present payment to the Sheikhs* The Treasury could not f*gree to relieve the Sheikhs of a tax in the nature of a» excise or export duty. The Treasury quite agreed however that it any payment were to be made on any ground, it should bs made in full *md final satisfaction of all claims present and future. 7. itr.waton explained tb»t tfc.

Their view vaa that compensation ought to he paid irreapeetiTe of the strict legal position (though this might affeot the amount of such compensation) t on account of the moral obligation and for the sake of preserving the British reputation for reliability in the Gulf, where the pledge to secure Immunity from taxation for the Sheikh’s date gardens, was widely known, and where it would be held that the faith of Great Britain was inrolTed in implementing it adequately* $. It was generally agreed that steps ou$it to be taken to secure the payment to the 'aeikhs of seme kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the obligations arising out of the 1914 undertakings. Mr.Trickett added that he did not think the Treasury would dissent from the conclusion, provided the payments could ba assessed within reasonably narrow limits and the Government of India were prepared to participate* Amount of SompwBgBUon. 9* The question of how the amount of this compensation should be arrived at Had previously been discussed. It was agreed that it would be necessary in the first place to attempt to form some estimate of the extent to which the Sheikhs would be out of pocket as ths result of the imposition of the new tax* This calculation would not be easy as much depended on how the produce w»a disposed of and on the quality of the dates. The Shsiidia would no doubt exaggerate both the quantity and the quality in the hope of obtaining larger compensation. Sir Francis Humphrys said that he thought the calculation could C* rn.de by mean* of a Joint In.MtlgnUon2P+ by tht AdminiatmtiTe Inapeotor at Baarah, and the Britlab Consul. It was that tha Dapart^enta should be guided by Sir Friunei* Humphry* 1 advice in this matter after his return to Baghdad. ilr.Flood pointed out that the Resident» in pura/nraph 6 (2) of his despatch of the 16th of August, had undertaken to secure freri the Sheikh of Koweit the details necessary for the making of this estimate, in so far as the gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit were concerned. 10. It was agreed th*t when this calculation should be available, a figure should be worked out which Hie Majesty’s Government would regard as fair and adequate compensation for the two Sheikhs, ^nd that this figure should not be allowed to form the subject of discussion or negotiation with the Sheikhs (vide paragraph 2C). ftovernffiiatL* 11. i*r Francis Humphry* sal* be had always thought tt would be fair for Iraq to contribute a sh*re of about one-third of the amount of compensation ultimately decided upon, at any rat# in so far as the Sheikh of Koweit was concem.d.

Sir Francis explained that this proposal would raise in an acute form the question of whether the le^al liability lay upon Great Britain or Iraq. ^henerer thie question was raised the Iraqis took the view thp.t, if the liability was legally theirs they would meet it to to . but that before they would do this the legal position must be settled by an arbitral award. 12. Sir Francis emphasised that the settlement between Iraq and Kowelt must be direct. Intervention by His Majesty's Government would not be likely to facilitate the negotiations. Mr. Walt on pointed out th:t the proposal for an Iraq-Kov?eit agreement would require careful h&amp;ndling* and the Sheikh would of course be adTitpei by the PcliUcftl nuthoritiee in ths Gulf. Arbitration. 13. Mr.Valton enquired *hat w.re the objections to arbitration between His Hajesty’s Government and Iraq to determine upon which country the liability reatei. It was explained that the wain objaction in the past hnd been that the ro.ult of arbitration would be very doubtful, and that if Hi' Majesty'• Govsrnnent l.«t they would be faced/u° f^c«d rlth n he^ry and olear liability! for th® payment of which it would be very difficult to obtain Parliamentary sanction. Since the introduction of the latihlak tax, however, there appeared to be no ponelbillty of achieving a satisfactory eolation by arbitration* since an arbitrator would almost certainly take the riew thnt the istihlek tax was not covered by the undertaking given to the Sheikhs, »nd thpt consequently no liability rested upon either Great Britain or Iraq. Sir Francis added th*t even if an arbitrator decided that the liability lay on Iraq, although the Iraqi Government would probably observe scrupulously the letter of the award, they would find sane means of reimbursing themselves et the Sheikhs* expense or at all events of seeing that the Sheikhs did rot gsin on the balance* 14* It was r-greed thrt the proposal to put the to arbitretion b(»tw**n Hi* Majesty* » 3 ore rumen t nnd Irn&lt;i should be rbandone^ exoept in the remote oontinsenoy of it beini? decided that t^e istihlsk tsx wan coeered by the undertakingt W* 11 th '* t * T8n in thia cape arbitrntien could not effect * satiefmetory fmnl settlement for the reason stated in tho preceding prragr*# Source of jL^iao*LeiLJii^iiifi2i^- 15. Hr.Trickett stated that his instructions were still to the effect thst any payment made to the Sheikhs m u«t be shared between the United Kin S dam OoT.wment and the OoTernment of India. The Treasury were not satisfied however that sny legal liability existed, and had never oomitted themeelves to pay anything except in r spona. to a l.g.1 liability to pay. They did not admit that even then the whole liability should f.U upon His Majesty's Oov.m*ent. The India Office on the other hsnd/hand hald that oompan^tlon -art „• paU irraap.ctive of th. 1.^1 position, and hold -or.or.r that the who!, li.hilit, rested in a-V oa^ with His Ifcjerty*. Covert. ain o. . ^ia's iluuillt/ or all war obligations had been 11 °* '“e oontributlon which had been made ^ the Covemnent of India towards tho expenses of the war. The Treasury did not accept the riew that this liability was owe rod rgr the 'War settlement'’. 16. Hr. ;;endel auesested that if there was no legal iiabii-ity, and if the proposed payaent was Intended solely tc pr * ,wrT ' aritlat Pr«»ttB* in the Oulf, then the paj-oent ooald not be regarded oa a war liability, bat a-jrt be treated as arising out of prssent policy. Ur. alt on suggested that the question whether tU# istihlah tax was cowered the I 9 I 4 pledges should be referred to the La* -fflcers. The Treasury wlew was that a corollary to sueh reference the India tiffioe should undertake to share any coneequent financial payment. Hr. 1 niton suggested that in wiew of its importenee, the 'inert ion of legal liability should in any oas* o« oi.«Ar«4 up.

Randal pointad oat that if tha Law fficars* opinion was that a legal liability did not exist, the case for an Indian aontrioution would oa strengthened, as it would oa possible to represent to tha Ooremment of India that a-y p^rwent which it might erentuallgr be decided tomakt waa aori* of * politloal and X«aa of a wart 1 dm payuwnt • kn however any payment made would also oe in the nature of a final liquidation of the I 9 I 4 pledges and intended to ensure that those pledges should not be invoiced in future in the event of Iraq re-imposing land taxes whieh might legally be regarded as covered by the pledges, the payment could not be regarded ae a purely ex gratis political one, and, in so far as it constituted a final liquidation of the 1914 pledges in respect of the future, could legitimately be represented as arising out of a war obligation. Hr. Trickett said that he oould not wholly agree. As matters stood at the moment, there was no liability to ensure immunity from taxation or in default to pay oompensation. Possibly, in the future, the for;n of taxation might be changed to that of a land tax, to which the pledge would apply. But that - as sir - — ■■■ ■—■—i Francis Humphrya had advised - was a very remote oontingenoyj and in substance therefore any payment which it might be decided now to make would be a political payment for whioh the Government of India should share responsibility • 19 . It was eventually agreed that the division of liability b.tw.tn Hi. Me.J..ty'8 aor.rnm.Trt in th« UnitaA Kingloa and tha Got. ns».nt of India would hare to ba dealt with separately and poa.ibljr referred tb the abinet. 2v. After furttier discussion it wae agreed that as a preliminary to referring the matter to the Cabinet, it would be desirable to obtain an authoritative opinio n the legal question. Mr. Triohett said that he would be willing - and he would ash ur. 3 wkett to be so good as to collaborate - to consult the Treasury solicitor on the question whether the undertakings Siren to the Sn.lkhs couldooaM be held to placii Hie Majesty*a Govermuent under a legal obligation to indemnity the sheikha ugaintrt any istihlak tax whioh might he levied on the sale or export of the produce of their gardens* 21# It was agreed that no decision should b« taken regarding a reference to the ..aw Officers untiii after the conversations with sir M.

At the end of the meeting a brief discussion took place on the question of the ownership of the gardens of the Sheikh of Xoweit* The Sheikh of Xowslt t s claim to ownership of certain of these gardens has recently been challenged on the ground of a flaw In his original title. Sir Francis explained that there had been e test case in respect of a portion of one very smallaardon; this case the Sheikh hud loat. Another case was pending in respect of a larger property. At present a deadlock had been produced* because the shaikh hud withdrawn his power of attorney from hls Ament in Basrah, which prevented the Courts from taking action, since the Political Resident would not serve the writs on the Sheikh of -Covrait. -6.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's intention to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ, and the Shaikh of Mohammerah by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in the First World War.The correspondence is mainly between British officials discussing the possible solutions to the gardens taxation issue. Among the suggested solutions was the selling of the property. British officials report that the Shaikh of Kuwait is entirely flexible in regards to the selling of certain estates but not the ones in Al-Faw. But they also suggested that it would be rather useless for the Iraq Government to attempt to purchase the gardens as they belong to more than a hundred relatives of the Shaikh who depend on the produce for their maintenance.The volume includes statements of an estimated value of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s estates on Shatt al-Arab. It also contains economic reports on the proposed new basis of taxation on agricultural produce in Iraq, and copies of the Government of Iraq’s new laws for the collection of consumption (
                           Istihlak) tax and for the collection of land rent and water rent (ff 79-101). The correspondence also includes records of meetings held in London in regard to the question of the taxations as well as the new system of land revenue collections in Iraq.The main correspondence is between the British Resident, Bushire, the Political Agent, Kuwait, the High Commissioner, Baghdad, and the Colonial Office, Downing Street, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Al-Fāw</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consumption</topic></subject><subject><topic>Water</topic></subject><subject><topic>Meetings</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Mohammerah</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Mohammerah Khaz'al bin Jābir bin Mirdāw al-Ka'bī</namePart></name></subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ṣabāḥ (Family)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al Arab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Taxation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Land</topic></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conferences</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000053#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
