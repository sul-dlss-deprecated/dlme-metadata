It concerns the future involvement of the Government of India in Persia. Grant suggests that the Government of India has the following options:to clear out of Persian entirely and 'leave it to stew in its own juice without financial or other assistance';to acquire a mandate to run Persia, retaining troops there, controlling the Government and practically administering the country;to acquire a mandate for some other power (such as America or Belgium) to undertake the task;to continue – with or without a mandate – to assist Persia on a limited scale.Grant goes on to list objections to the first three options before stating that the fourth course of action is the one that the Government of India would advocate. Grant cites the concerns of Sir Charles Marling [British Minister at Tehran] regarding Persian public opinion on the presence of the British in Persia. Grant concludes his note by proposing that a public declaration should be made to the Persian Government, in which His Majesty's Government would promise a number of actions – including the withdrawal of its military presence in Persia – in return for being able to assist the Persian Government in the regulation of its finances.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000181#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
