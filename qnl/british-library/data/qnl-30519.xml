With the advent of the monsoons, and the stricter vigilance exercised by the Karachi Customs, the smuggling of rice into Gwadur, hitherto flourishing, is almost at a standstill, v/ith the result that the price in Muscat has risen by about 200 % n A further rise is expected DOLLAR RATE, 251. The rate of the Maria Theresa dollar is falling rapidly and there is every indication that it will fall lower still, inspite of the good date season which usu lly results in a high rate. This, according to a leading merchant, is due to the fact that dollars are being smuggled in large quantitiesSECRET. MUSCAT INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NO. 16 FOR THE PERIOD 16th to 31st August. 1948.

In the struggle that ensued two of the women made their get-a-way, the others being carried off on camels to the interior, where, it is feared they will be sold as slaves. Reports made to the Wali of Sib were of no avail as he has absolutely no means of either following the beduin or even preventing further cases of kidnapping. 259. • Within a few days of calling on Mr. Stobart Shaikh Hamed bin Ahmad Alhaiyay of Dhank made a second appearance at the Consulate to pay his respects to the new Consul.

He has spent considerable time attempting to raise a loan at the Consulate on the grounds that he had rendered great aid to His Majesty^ Government at the outbreak of the war. His frequent references to this and his connection with various representatives of His ffcjesty^s Government give one the impression that he is trying to trade on them. The Shaikh is being repatriated, THE BERLIN ISSUE. 295. Arab, Indian and Pakistan nationals have registered general approval of Mr. Churchill’s recent prounceraent on Russia and the Berlin issue. One prominent Indian was heard to remark 1 ” When Mr. Churchill takes the stage to make such an important prouncement then we can safely bet that we are heading for another 'JUNG' ( war ) n • PRIME MINISTERS CONFERENCE. 296. A casual comment made by the B*B.C on the conference in London regarding any one Dominion that wishes to be independent of the Commonwealth yet • •yet enjoy all the privileges extended to a Doninion, has created the inpress- ion that the reference was a ^E&gt;einte&lt;if to India and its possibility of leaving the Comonwealth. Local Indian opinion favours the idea of India remaining within the Commonwealth for some time more until India can build up her resources, especially her armed forces* PALESTINE. 297. Reference Serial 230/48. The news of the establishment of an Arab Government at Gaza that has so far not been recognised by any of the leading Powers has been received with marked indifference. Local Palestinians cannot concieve the idea of an Arab Government without Jerusalem. The recognition of the Arab Government by Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab states has made no impression on them. HYDERABAD &amp; KASHMIR. 298. The utmost satisfaction was expressed by the local Hindu community on the quick settlement of the Hyderabad question, and the announce ment of Shaikh Abdullah, the Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister, on the deter mination of the people to cede to the Indian Union. Recent broadcasts by Sardar Vallabhai Patel and others on Kashmir and Pakistan relationship have left a bad taste in the mouths of the Muslims in general. ID AND DUSSERAH. 299.

She is being treated at the American Mission Hospital. 308. News that the new Baizas of various denominations were to be intro duced very shortly appeared to cause some panic amongst the local shop keepers. The Baiza rate which had fallen to 50 per rupee steadily increased to about 70 when most of the baizas disappeared including those brought in from the interior by the donkey load. It is stated that whilst some got rid of as many baizas as possible having heard the Government rate would be in the vicinity of 100 per rupee, others again are said to have hoarded them hoping to obtain at least their metallic value. Owing to this increase prices In food stuff went up considerably. 309. If one is to judge a bank by the sound it makes, there is not much the matter with our local branch. The cheerful smile of the Manager, the happy look of the merchants who can do business at the bank without having to wait for weeks as in the past, and the constant jingling of the rupees and dollars till quite late in the evening give one the impression that all is for the best in the best of all possible Banks. TRIBAL AFFAIRS. 310. Shaikh Salih bin Isa al Karthi, accompanied by Shaikh Hamid bin Suleiman arrived in Muscat on a visit to the Sultan presumably to talk ’oil’. Accompanied by a retinue of some thirty beduin armed to the teeth, Shaikh Salih called on H.M’s Consul to pay his respects. Escorted by the Dragoman Shaikh Salih was followed by his retinue who soon invaded the draw ing room. They too felt they had to pay their respects to the new Consul, and making short shrift of the refreshments that were served they were ’ smoked out M of the drawing room, ' 311. It is rumoured that the tribes of Baraimi have declared that they would not pay allegiance to the Sultan. This is because they feel that any agreement signed by the oil company should be signed with them and not the Sultan. This appears to have followed in the wake of the news that Mijor Bird was on his way to Muscat to see the Sultan. H Oil w is now the talk of the town including the leading merchants who are hoping for possible contracts with the company the moment anything is found. SHIPPINGSHIPPING 312. s.s.

Woods-Ballard as Minister for Foreign Affairs, is causing some uneasiness amongst certain officials of the State, who feel this appointment would deprive them of considerable amount of pov/er they had previously enjoyed. It is stated that Saiyid Shahab, uncle to His Highness, who usually officiates for him during his absence from Muscat has decided to leave for India, possibly to discuss affairs with the ex-Sultan who is now in Bombay. 326. With the advent of the new Baizes, the end of the date season and mostly the opening of the bank, the dollar is steadily going down at an alarming rate, having reached the figure of 160 rupees for 100 M.T* dollars. According to reports from the merchants the circulation of the rupee and its demand for local purchases has devaluated the dollar, which according to some has lost its silver value. It has been well over a decade since the dollar was at so low a rate. Despite this the market values even of local commodities appear to rise rather than decrease. It seems that the local suppliers who formerly would only accept dollars, now take rupees, which they can exchange for baizas. 329. Merchants present themselves almost daily at the Agency for assistance to import Japanese goods, which appear to be invading the markets of the gulf, particularly piece-goods. Their cheap textiles afford the local merchant a greater profit than those from the United Kingdom. Similar goods, particularly cotton piece-goods appear to be smuggled through Gwadur to Baluchistan and Pakistan where prices are high, 330.
