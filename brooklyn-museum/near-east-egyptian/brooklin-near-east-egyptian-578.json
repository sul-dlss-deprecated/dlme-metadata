He wears a nemes with uraeus. The head of the uraeus is gone and there is no indication of a tail. The nemes rests low upon the forehead. The brows in relief dip slightly toward the root of the nose. The eyeballs are well rounded. The lips are full but the mouth is relatively small. The space between the base of the nose and upper lip is short. The cheeks are full. The lappets of the nemes are striated horizontally. A pronounced median line and navel with an additional division between rib cage and abdomen. The broad, flat topped back pillar ends at the shoulder blades. The arms and shoulders are mostly gone but the portion remaining shows the arms were at the sides. Probably from a striding statue. \r\nCondition: Arms mostly gone (parts remaining are inner edges on both sides). Right shoulder gone from nemes outwards. Small part of left shoulder mostly gone. Three large chips in wings of nemes. Chin chipped. Large chip in left breast. Other small chips. Traces of red, green and yellow pigment over the piece which is not ancient as a portion is in a chip.", "medium": "Granite", "dimensions": "13 3/8 x 6 3/8 x 5 9/16 in.
