His Highness intends visiting India for six weeks leaving Salalah in late December returning there about the middle of February* It is hoped that it will be possible to arrange for an unofficial meeting for His Highness during this period with H.E. Lord 7/avell whom he has not yet met. 166. His Highness proposes to come to Huscat sane time towards the end of March 1945 and spend the summer here. This will be first summer the Sultan has spent in iluscat for three years and there is much scepticism amongst the Ministers and their entourage as to whether this decision will be carried out. It is believed that His Highness* main reason for braving the rigours of a Muscat summer is that the Director General of Custaas* (who is also Finance Officer) terms of office expires in June 1945 and he would like to see his successor who has not yet been chosen, installed in office while he is here. His Highness has also asserted that he intends changing the Liinister for External Affairs and replacing his uncle Saiyid Shahab try his half-brother Saiyid Tariq aged 24* A short precis of the latter* s antecedents and career is attached at the end of this-summary.Extract from Muscat Intelligence Suramary No. 12 for the period from l 6 th to 30th June, 1944* KIS HIGHNESS THE SULTAN 139. Reference paragraph 12y of this series* His Highness the Sultan returned to Salalah by R.A.F. plane on the 15 th June. * - 140. His Highness spent 39 days in Jerusalem under treatment of his doctor, an Austrian Jew. Captain Bird has seen the doctor*s report and the sultan's stomach trouble was apparently due to liver trouble. The Sultan says he has been completely cured and feels very much better now. 141. During his stay in Egypt, His Highness had an interview with K^l.King Farouk with whom he apparently struck up an iiunediate friendship. He is sending with Ali bin Mo hammad, his Secretary, some Muscat dates in silver boxes to H.M. the King, as a small present. . 142. The Sultan told Captain Bird that at a certain lunch ‘Party he could not help but notice the ill-feeling between the Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha, and H.M. the King. 143. His Highness also lunched at the British Embassy and the news of the invasion very appropriately arrived when he was there. He says Sir Keith Parke, the Air Officer Comanding in Chief, who was also present, executed a war dance in expression of his pleasure at the good news. 144. The sultan's general reaction to his three months in /the■H BfiSBHHi * * * * W ' : \V i 2 . the Mddle East, may be sui.med up by his statement to Captain Bird that it was an, experience which he valued very greatly but that there was a good deal to be said for the peace and calm of Dhofar. His Highness was particularly struck with the abject poverty of the 'fellahin' in contradistinction to the wealth of many of the city dwellers* He said the 'fellahin'j were infinitely worse off than the Dha'af, Bahara or Abid (slave) in Dhofar* * . 145* His Highness entertains no illusions regarding 'Ittihad El Arab' (Ban Arab Federation) and is well aware of the irreconci lability of H*l.:. Abdul Aziz Al Saud and H*M*King Farouk in this matter* He thinks the most that could be hoped for, if a Fan Arab Conference ever were convened, would be some agreement on removal of customs barriers and currency differences. As far as is known he met none of the Saudi Arabia pfficials. 146 * The sultan's reception during his journey to and frcm Egypt was apparently all that could be desired, and he met an old - acquaintance, to his great surprise, in Brigadier Longrigg, ex A.I.O.C. in Asmara* He also met Colonel Bertram Thomas, his ex-Wazir, in Jerusalem. . His Highness expressed his very great appreciation of Sir Keith Parke's assistance in token of which he has written to Captain Bird forwarding a cheque for £5Q0/- to be placed at the Air Officer ccmmanding's disposal for R.A.F* flands in the Middle,East. ribctract from: MUSCAT L TELLIGi-dC , SUMMARY HO. 12 POiv Tilt HSEIOD FROM 16TH TO yjr. JUNE 1^44. m\ a.ickica:^ air.^s, ^51* The Officer OociKiandingy U. C. A.T.C. (hunself an ex- employee of P*A*A. Ltd*) told the Assistant Bolitioal Agent that a subsidiary cotr.&gt;any of P. ^A. Ltd., known as P.A.A. (Africa) Ltd. are operating the South Arabian Air Route under Contract to the .S.A.T.C. It is a fact that P. UA. J lanes and pilots are marked as such on all arrival an'l departure boards in Salalah, asirah and Karachi. The American 0 ficors Ckyaruanding at ] asirah and Salalah are both ex F.A.A. personnel but from outward appearances it is impossible to distin*aiish between P. A. A. and U. S. A.T. C. machines and personnel. It is interesting to note how P.A.A. are therefore, by their system of contracts acquiring a vast working capital for post war Civil aviation. B. O.A.C., it would seem, will start at considerable disadvantage if this is true. 152. The Pultan shows a marked aversion to flying by B. 0. A.C. aircraft mainly due te his having travelled by a 1 Lodestar* aircraft of the Corporation which made a one-engined landing in Kasirah some time ago. One other reason for his preference for travelling by American plane, is undoubtedly the fact that they carry him free while he pays by 1L0.A.C. *s plane. His Hi^^iness* affected trust in the reliability of the American planes (he seems to forget that the lodestar is, in any case, an American built machine J; has recently however been somewhat shaken by the sight which greeted him on arrival of a bumt-out * Commando * transport 50 y girds from a bomb dump /containingv * \ containing 500 lb. bombs and depth charges etc. near the runaway at Salalah and a • Liberator* vhich ended up on its nose on the runaway. Further lurid accounts of recent mishaps to American machines Tdiich have reached His Hifhness* ears (e.g. the DC4 which missed runaway at Masirah and landed in the sea, the DC3 which arrived at Karachi with one engine afire and other which circled I/asirah for 1 ^ hours trying to induce the under-carriage to lower itself, may tend to make him alter his opinions - but apparently money still talks, and the Sultan intends travelling to India, in December by American planeiINDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l June, 1944. ^LL Ext. 2327/44. June , Dear Prior, Thank you for your letter No.379-S of 5th May regarding the Sultan of Muscat’s interview with 'Al Musawwar.' We wipre interested to see the Sultan's remarks on the subject of Arab Federation, though they do not seem to have amounted to a great deal, and it looks as if the Sultan was merely being polite and saying what he thought was expected of him. But I suppose the notion of an Arab Federation might have some attractions in the eyes of the Sultan as a possible aid (additional or alternative to the support afforded by His Majesty’s Government) to safeguarding his independence at some future date against the designs of Saudi-Arabia or other acquisitive powers; but this, as you said in paragraph 11 of your letter to Caroe of 26th January, 1942, is not an idea that should bo encouraged. I am sending copy of this letter to Caroe. You're v he Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I. E 0 , The Residency, Bushire.which I enclose a copy. The Arabic shows that both in the heading of the article and in the body His Highness is referred to as ’•Azm&amp;t* which is the more exalted form of 'Highness* 1 and the one which we use in addressing him, the lesser form being ‘'Simoo** which we use for Bahrain and Kuwait. Within his own territories the Sultan likes to be called »«jalalat* which means »Kaj e sty', in fact Ijykstra, the -hnerican missionary in Kuscat found he made no headway until his petitions contained this superscription, but apparently he found the air of Cairo unsuited to this title J 2. The portion regarding his status is accurately translated where it says 'This Sultanate is independent but is bound to Britain with a treaty of Alliance and Friendship', and since Hi&amp; Highness must have supplied the information himself, it is a good sign that he should have mentioned his treaty relations to an Arab journalist, knowing that he -would, almost certainly be quoted. I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe and also to Ketcalfe and Hiekinbo tham . riecTfSTiiS; 2 1 MAY'''’ INDIA OFFICE R. T.

Extract from New York Sun,Dated 3rd March,1938, Muscat's Sultan Hepays a Call Ruler of Asiatic Sand Dunes Rates Much Pomp on Arrival in Washington, WASHINGTON, March 3 (U.P#)- The Sultan of Muscat, a little twenty-seven-year-old bachelor in flowing brown and white robes, arrived here today to repay a 106 year-old diplomatic obligation and to be welcomed by the United States Government, A troop of cavalry at full war time strength bared sabres, detachments of marines and sailors presented arms, and high officials of the United States Government in official silk hats hurried down the platform of Union station to greet the ruler of a land of 82,000 square miles. The Sultan is repaying a call made in 1832 by a representative of President Andrew Jackson, He will have supper with President Roosevelt and tonight Secretary of State Cordell Hull will entertain at dinner in his honor. Ranking officialdom of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps as well as State Department officers turned out to do honor to the Sultan, ruler of an independent kingdom of sand dunes and occasional oases on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Blase Capitalites gaped as the little man, his brown and white robes whipping in the wind, walked down a lane of marines, sailors and soldiers. Crowds pushed a ainst .dice lines at Union station, spectators were shunted about, and a policeman was hit on the jaw by a spectator angered at the confusion. Although/Although the Sultan^ special car was shunted into the Union station at 6.55 a.m., official Washington did not hecon-e cognizant of his presence u&gt; til 11 a.m. when the dictates of protocol decreed that he should be welcomed officially by Mr. Hull and other high ranking officials. As Mr.Hull and the accompanying officials arrived at the sultanate’s car, a little brown man dressed in flowing brown and white robes descended the steps of the car and made his salaams to the American dignitaries. He was one of the aids to the Sultan. He was followed by the Sultan, also dressed in brown and white robes with gold facings and a multicolored, bejewelled turban. He shook hands formally with Mr.Hull and the other officials and the party passed back through the double line of marines and sailors to the President’s reception room in the station. (The Army band played the American and the Muscat and Oman national anthems. Following the ceremonies, the party paraded in automobiles, escorted by the cavalry troop, to a downtown hotel.&gt;* &amp; r FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. lltn March, 1938.

Yours ever. iSfiB. POL. L: 14 MAR 1938 INDIA r'iC: J.P. Gibson, Esq.\ COPY. (S 954/305/91) H Sultan of Muscat . Payment of Zanzibar Subsid.y ' The question dealt with in Mr. Oiosonls letter of the 17th February and its enclosure^ (Sir T. Fowled letter of the 7th January), becomes rather clearer if we take events in their historical order and take stock of tne position at each relevant date. In 1861 the Canning award was given, under which Zanzibar had to pay a suDSid,y to Muscat. Under this award Zanzibar was the debtor and, though I am not very well acquainted with the exact status of Zanzibar at that time, I think it was quite definitely not a British protectorate and inside the British Bmpire in that sense. 2. in 1873 an arrangement seems to have been made, which was accepted by Zanzibar, Muscat and the United Kingdom under which the United Kingdom, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say Her Majesty the Queen, became suustituted for the Sultan of Zanzibar as the debtor. Muscat thereby ootained, in place of a bad payer and a ruler of perhaps uncertain financial soundness, a new debtor wnich was a good payer and of the highest financial soundness^ therefore a great advantage to Muscat. In return, however, for tnis advantage a new condition was introduced, namely that the new debtor would be only bound to pay tne subsidy for so long as the creditor Continued faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government ,, . The acceptance of this condition seems to me to oe part of the bargain by which Muscat acquired a mucn better debtor tnan it had previously had in respect of this suosidy. Zanzibar I think/ r- iV ( . i t t j I . I &gt; \ »• I f \ S - *think must be regarded as having gone out of tne picture from this date, as far as Muscat is concerned. 3. In 1890 the status of Zanzibar changed. It became a British protectorate and part of the British Empire but it seems to me that, as Zanzibar had already disappeared from the picture this change in the position of Zanzibar had no effect whatever in regard to the conditions on which the suusidy was payable to Muscat. If in 1873 Her Majesty had not become substituted for the Sultan of Zanzibar as the debtor, then the change in the position of Zanzibar would have had the result, not that the subsidy was payable out of the revenues of the United Kingdom or any other part of the British Empire except Zanzibar, but that Her Majesty as tne protecting Power was bound by international law to see that the Sultan of Zanzibar managed his revenues reasonably prudently and paid his suusidy deot punctually whenever these revenues permitted him to do so. But in any case the point is, I think, irrelevant seeing that Zanzibar had disappeared out of the picture so far as Muscat was concerned seventeen years earlier. 4. The position therefore remains that the subsidy is payable by His Majesty subject to the condition which I have mentioned. This condition remains, but legally I think we are not entitled to add further conditions without the Sultan of Muscat's consent. 5. The question whether His Majesty’s liability to pay this subsidy should fall upon India, upon the United Kingdom or should once more fall upon Zanzibar is of course a purely domestic matter which in no way concerns the Sultan of Muscat.

J^pan. The main purpose of the Sultan's visit to Japan (which lasted for five weeks and was of a 'private' nature) was to see his father who abdicated in his favour in 1932. His Highness does not seem to have had a particularly happy time in the country and spent most of the time at Yokohama. During short visits to Tokio he lunched at the British and American iilmbassies.

Outwardly at any rate the Sultan avoided contact with Japanese officials and the Ambassador thinks it unlikely that any discussions took place between the Sultan and Japanese officials. America. The Sultan seems to have fared better in America. He reached San Francisco from Japan on the ICth February and was met by officials of the State Department, one of whom has remained with the party. His proposed tour through the Southern States was quietly dropped owing to the colour question. At Washington he was treated as a Government guest for a few days and Secretary of State and the Under Secretary of State. These were attended in turn by some Cabinet Ministers, a fev: Heads of ''issions, the Chairman of the Senate and the other officials. His Highness refused an invitation to lunch at the British Embassy on the ground that his visit to Washington was official. He is now' in New/ York and w'ill leave for England by the S.S.”Q,ueen Mary” on 22nd March.

He was accompanied by his brother, Saiyid fariq bin Taimur, by two secretaries, Heial bin Bader and Saiyid Abdulmunim 3 »awawi, by an oiiicial, xlhan Bahadur Ahmad Shub&amp;ily, and by two negro servants. The main purpose of his visit was to see his father Saiyid Taimur, who, having abdicated in 1932, has for the last two years been living in Kobe with a Japanese wife. The announcement of the Sultan’s arrival appeared in the Japanese, although not in the foreign press, and throughout his stay in Kobe His Highness was constantly troubled by Japanese reporters although he refused to grant any 2 His Highness arrived at Kobe on December the interviews./ The Bight Honourable Anthony Eden, M*C. , m.p., etc., etc. , etc.In terviews 3. I instructed His Majesty’s Consul it Kobe to oall on His Highness and to inform him that I desired to take an early opportunity of welcoming him to Tokyo and that I hoped to arrange a dinner in his honour, I also asked Lir. Ovens to make dis creet enquiries a* to whether His Highness would like to stay at the iiabassy when he came to Tokyo. 4. On the 31st December Mr, Ovens called by appointment on the Cultan who received him most courteously and appeared to be gratified by the solicitude shown on his behalf. He looked forward to visiting the Embassy but hoped that any enter- tainment which was arranged in his honour would be of a 'private” nature, since he was anxious to main tain the strictest incognito while in JTepan. as regards staying at the Embassy, he had already decided to stay at an hotel in Tokyo in view of his desire for as much freedom of movement and as much privacy -s possible. Mr, Ovens reported that the Sultan had been very harassed by newspapermen and that the impression which he and his suite had formed of this country up till then had not been an entirely happy one. 5. After a short visit to Kyoto the Sultan and his party arrived in Tokyo on the 10th January where they were met at the station by a member of my staff, who conveyed my greetings to His Highness. Fears for/10/ - 3 - for the preservation of the Sultan's incognito, however - to a very large extent these determined all the party's movements - led to a sudden change in their plans and after only one night in fokyo they left hurriedly for an hotel in Yokohama where they stayed until they left Japan and where they successfully concealed their identity, at least from the press. 6 . The Sultan eventually accepted my invita tion and came to luncheon at the Embassy on the 18th January, the guests consisting solely of members of my staff and their wives. 7. \s he had expressed a desire to attend a session of the Diet which was then sitting two members of the staff accompanied His Highness, together with i^d 5 . r.»awawi and Mr. Bader, to a session of the Lower House on the 24th January. 6 * On the following day, the 25th January, His Highness lunched at the American .Snbassy, my United States colleague having been concerned in making arrangements for his journey across the United States to Washington where he will be the guest of the Presi dent. On January 27th the Sultan and his suite left for San Francisco by the steamship 'Tatsuta Maru ,, . His father was in the party but it is expected that he will soon return to Kobe.10 . The Impressions which the Sultan and his oarty formed of Ja ,an were far from favourable. Reference has already been made to the unwelcome attention to which they were subjected by reporters in Kobe, who on more than one occasion forced their way into the Sultan’s room at the hotel, and the police, both in Kobe and in Kyoto, were as impor tunate as usual* As is the case with most tourists, their contacts with the Japanese were almost con fined to their dealings with guides, hotel-employeos, taxi-drivers, shop-assistants, curio-dealers and others of that predatory class, which m^y account for the low opinion they foriasd of Japanese intelli gence and efficiency. Ihile the party were in Tofcyo a member of my staff accompanied them at their invi tation to a Japanese wrestling tournament, the classical Japanese drama and on a motor-car tour of the sights. On the whole they appeared to derive little pleasure from their visit to Japan and to find the time hanging heavy on their hands. So far, His Highness confided, Japan had proved to be the least interesting stage of his tour round the world. 11. It is unlikely that any discussion took place between the Sultan and Japanese officials. Y*hen I suggested that he might like to meet some Japanese officials at the luncheon-party, he recoiled from the idea as if nothing could have been more dis tasteful.Il the course of a conversation with a number of my staff he stated that ..iuscat was not in treaty rela tions ^ith Japan, that tnere had been no talk of opening relations and that it was unlikely that relations would oe opened in the future. If any dis cussions did in fact take place during the ciultan’s stay in Japan, the fact was concealed with considerable skill and a deliberate attempt made to suggest the contrary. the i&gt;ultan when he came to the sab assy and his manner towards the British officials with whom he came into contact was consistently affable. He appeared to desire to keep on good terms with us, expressod to me the British, and seemed to appreciate the little which we were able to do for him. I 12 .

I sent a copy of tne same note to .7 alt on and enclose for your information a copy of extracts from the letter which I have received from him in reply. Y °u will no doubt agree, as we do, with Walton f s general remarks as to the desirability of maintaining as friendly relations as possible with the Sultan at the present juncture. With regard to paragraph 3 , nothing was said here about any proposal to visit Italy and l do not suppose that you have any further information. Personally I should be inclined to deprecate any attempt to dissuade His Highness from going there, if he has made up his mind to do so. That opinion is however based on a comparatively slight acquaintance with the Sultan and I should be grateful for your views on the question raised by Walton at the end of paragraph 3 . la paragraph 4 of his letter ./alton raises two questions: (a) that of providing the Sultan with a British Officer. We have already had some Private and Personal correspondence on this subject and I have written to you demi-officially asking for your general views. This is a matter in v/nich the Viceroy is also making a personal interest and he hopes that it may be possible?to make some officer available for the purpose. Have you any suggestions ? (b)/2 . (To) the question of the arms subsidy. % idea was that the Sultan would himself raise the matter officially through y^a, out he will hardly of course be in aposition to do this u.itil he returns co kuscat. You will remember the previous correspondence on the subject which I have again examined. it was agreed between us in 1935 , when we were both at home, that there was no justification for making any further recommendation for the continuance of the suboidy. in this connection please see your demi-official letter No./348-S. dated the 7th November 1935. There was some subsequent correspondence in 1936 (vide your demi- official letter No.526-3. of 1936 , dated the 1st July 1936 to Caroe) in which reference was made to the Sultan’s liberation from his previous agreement with regard to the arms tratfic by reason of the withdrawal of the subsidy. The recent interest shown by both the Japanese and Italians in the Persian Gulf might possibly provide a reason for revising uhe attitude towards this question which you took up in 1935 and 1936. if therefore you like to raise the question of the subsidy without waiting for a direct application from the Sultan, I would certainly have it considered here and it would then be possible to agree with the suggestions made by 17a It on in paragraph , r of his letter.

With regard to Fowle's paragraph 5, the logical outcome of his argument would be the acceptance by H.M.G., to the relief of Indian revenues, of responsibility for the payment of the Subsidy, whether or not the sums required were recovered from Zanzibar. Actually no recovery of the Subsidy from * Zanzibar seems to have been made since 1868. In 1873 Government assumed responsibility/responsibility for the payment of the subsidy, subject to conditions which It have been repeated whenever th^—aubsidy has been renewed to Saiyid Turki's successors. It was contemplated at the time that the Sultan of Zanzibar should be formally relieved of all future liability in respect of the subsidy. Difficulties over the signature of the Zanzibar Treaty seem to have prevented this being done, and Zanzibar 1 liability remained in theory unaffected, but practically Zanzibar thereafter dropped out of the picture. For ten years the cost of the subsidy was shared between H.M.G. and the Government of India, and from 1883 it has been borne entirely by India, The change of status of Zanzibar had Her tynach’cAi tUhv ctrtHjc+netxt mi n ffy.tyl’. tfltyxo, J India in 1890 byottght no praotioal oferngo and still pays the entire subsidy - which, by the way, has remained fixed at the rupee value (Rs.86,400) in which it was expressed in 1873, no account being taken of subsequent fluctuations in the exchange value of Hrrl^ur■ wni the original award of ho t ooo AoUcurs. Whatever be the result of an academic discussion, the fact remains that the subsidy has been granted to successive Sultans for over 60 years on certain conditions, which were accepted by the present Sultan without demur.

The presence or absence of these conditions may indeed make little practical difference, for it is improbable that in either case we should hesitate to withhold the subsidy if the Sultan were guilty of serious unfriendliness Nevertheless we feel we should maintain our right to impose the conditions and we do not think there should be any serious difficulty in resisting any attempt by the Sultan to challenge it.

Personally I agree v/ith Beckett*s views (paragraph 2 of his memorandum). As he points out, the inclusion of the words “save to the British Government 11 was both un necessary and unfortunate. However, the situation now would appear to be as stated in the last sentence of B®ekett*s para^aph 2 * and is a point of some importance. I also agree with Beckett*s view expressed in paragraph 3 as to the possible deposing of the Sultan. Xuridicial arguments apart, though such action may have been practicable in 1899, it is not so in 1938, and would raise a storm of criticism against us not only in the Arab Press, and Arab countries, but in European quarters which are only too ready, as we know, to seize any stick to beat us with. The only occasion I can imagine v/hen we could take this extreme step would be in the event of a major war, in which the Sultan either openly joined our enemies, or by his acts showed himself definitely hostile to us. He would then be in the position of being at war with us, and4* I also agree with the first part of Beckett*a paragraph 4. With regard to the last part of that paragraph, however, re the termination of the Zanzibar subsidy, I doubt whether our position is as strong as suggested by Beckett, or perhaps I have read more into what he says than he intended* CotZo_ (U* 5* The history of this subsidy is given in paragraphs j'Z'X-Z and 3 and 4 of 218006*8 letter Uo.70-S, dated 12th February 1932 to the Government of India, a copy of which was sent to the India Office. Briefly the case seems to be as follows. The Canning Award of 1861 as to this subsidy is given on page 303 of Aitchison f s Treaties, Vbl. XI,..and is unconditional* The Sultan of Zanzibar failed in his payments to the Sultan of Muscat (Lorimer in Vol* I Part I page 490}^ and/1873 His Majesty*s Government assumed responsibility for future payments, the Sultan being informed that it would be maintained **80 long as he continued faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Govern- ment. rt His Maiesty*s Government had of course a perfect right to make this stipulation since they were assuming a responsibility for which they were in no way bound by the award, which was issued by them acting as an arbitrator. In 1890 Zanzibar became, and still is, a British Protectorate. It therefore appears to roe that from 1873 to 1890 the subsidy was subject to the condition laid down by His Majesty*s Government, but that from 1890 onwards. His Majesty*s Government having taken over Zanzibar, assumed its liabilities, of which one was the unconditional payment of the Zanzibar subsidy. In fact our/-our position with regard to this liability is not unlike be that which we maintain to/that of the Iraq Government in the matter of the Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens in Iraq. If I am right in this assumption then the Zanzibar subsidy cannot of course be used as a lever for influencing the Sultan in any direction. Ifcis* of course, goes further than biscoe's conclusion at the end of his para graph 4. 6 . If I am not correct and the subsidy is subject to the conditions laid down in 1873, even so 1 do not think that we can consider using the possibility of its termin ation as a lever for insisting on our being consulted on the Sultan's relations with foreign Powers. Such relations are not precluded by his treaty engagements with us and therefore do not constitute a breach of the conditions of the grant of the subsidy. cr£ 7. Ihe Government of India concurred with Biscoe's views as given with his letter quoted above and accordingly the Sultan was informed that the subsidy was subject to his being on terms of amity and friendship with His Majesty's Government and to his faithfully observing his treaty 7&lt;^3xengagements (vide Bushire Egress Letter U 0 . 6 OO -S, dated 20 th August 1932, to the Government of India). Ihe Sultan in his reply, sent to the Government of India under my letter Kb.0-55, dated 5th March 1933, made no demur at the conditions attached to the continuation of the subsidy. It is possible, however, that he may query these conditions at some time in the future and it might be as well there fore for His Majesty's Government to make a decision as to whether my assumption in paragraph 5 above is correct, iVin which case the threat of withholding the subsidy cannot be used at all. Jtarther, if my assumption is incorrect then do my views as stated in paragraph 6 hold good ? a.

Dear George, The state Department tells me that the Sultan of Muscat arrives at San Francisco on February 10th. They are sending Summerlin, the rather bibulous Head of the Protocol, to meet him there, but Summerlin leaves him at San Francisco, and thenceforward the Sultan will be in charge of a State Department Agent, who can be trusted to act as a very competent courier and maker of arrangements. The State Department sent him a hint that he should wear Arab costume, this in order to minimise the possibilities of unpleasantness arising out of the colour question. The Sultan has said that he will wear his robes on formal cccasions, and plain clothes on others. He apparently means to visit Hollywood and to travel by the Southern route, which is perhaps rather a pity for colour reasons, and he will arrive at Washington on the 10th of March where hev.will I be the guest of the United States Government for ' two or three days; and he apparently sails in the 'Queen Mary” which I see leaves on the 23rd of March. I understand that the president will probably give him a luncheon, and the State Department rather wants me to throw a party for him. I should propose also to give him a luncheon, which is pretty plain sailing. The •.• G. W. Rendel, Esq., C.M. G. , Foreign Office, London, S.W.lThe Department is much excited at having found a lady in Washington who is the direct descendant of Edmund Roberts, the New England merchant who sailed round the world in his clipper and negotiated the Treaty of 1833; but I can’t help wondering whether the Sultan will experience any corresponding emotion when he sees the old lady. I should be very glad of any indication you can give me as to what my own demeanour towards the Sultan should be. In legal theory he seems to be as much an independent Sovereign as the King of the Belgians. Ought I to pay a first call on him; if so of course I do not in the least mind. But I rather fancy he will get enough incense here to turn his head and you may not wish me unduly to add to it; and yet I should not like to be too markedly behind what the American attitude will be. I am inclined to suggest that I send him an invitation to luncheon to meet him on his way here; and that then I should be on the station platform in Washington when he arrives, if I can manage this with the State department, as 1 daresay I could; and I might leave it at that. Sorry to trouble you with these tiresome details, but I should be glad of some guidance. Yours sincerely, (Signed) R. C. LINDSAY.POnKIOH opfick, S. .1. 89th ecenber, 1937.

On disembarlcation at Karachi on November 10th the Sultan was met by the Collector ol Karachi representing the Sind Government, the Brigadier General Oornmanding the Sind Independent Brigade and a Guard of Honour furnished by the x'oyal ,eet Kent Regiment. As His High ness disembarked a salute of 21 guns was fired by H.M.3. Enterprise. On 11th November the Saltan left by rail for Delhi in a special saloon provided for him by the Government of India. At New Delhi Station the Sultan was met by Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary to the Government of India in the External ^d'fairs Department, the Military Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, the Deputy Commies!oner of Delhi, the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and an Aide de Camp to His Excellency the Viceroy. station, the Sultan accompanied by his suite and Sir Aubrey Metcalfe drove in procession to the Viceroy’s House where he was received informally by His Excellency. The Sultan and his After inspecting the Guard of Honour provided at the party/party stayed at the Viceroy^ House until the loth after which they were the guests of the Government of India at Malden’s Hotel, Delhi. The dultan was accorded an official interview with His excellency on November 16th and on Novezaber 18th with the Secretary in the External Affairs Department at which various matters were discussed* These interviews have been reported on separately. For the Sultan’s stay in Delhi the Government of India had arranged a varied and comprehensive programme of sight seeing and demonstrations of different sorts. These were all genuinely enjoyed and appreciated by His Highness. Perhaps the object of the greatest interest to the Jultan was his visit to the Imperial Agricultural Institute an certainly the greatest thrill he experienced was tne demonstration by the Delhi Flying Club at an At Home given in his honour and his night flight over Delhi on a machine of India Airways. The Dultan and suite left Delhi in a s ecial rail way saloon provided by the Government of India for Bombay on November 22nd. The Gultan’s official visit (the first he had paid to India) can be described as a great success. Thanks to the excellent arrangements made by the various Departments con cerned everything went off without a hitch and His Highness it seems was genuinely impressed with the treatment he received and grateful for all the trouble taken to ensure his comfort and amusement. On 30th November the Multan left Bombay via Singapore for Japan where he intends to stay about one month with his father, saiyid Tairaur bin Faisal, late Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who has ettled down in that country and is living at present at Kobe. From Japan the Sultan proposes to proceed to the United States of America where his visit to ■ /. shington will be official and where he will be the guest of President Roosevelt/&gt; * * 7. 0 k Roosevelt. After leaving the United States of .merica the Multan is to pay an official visit to England in March and probably to France later on.

I enclose a statement containing particulars of the programme of entertainment which was arranged for the Sultan’s father in 1928, and I should be glad to receive any suggestions which you may wish to offer in connection with the entertainment of Sultan Saiyid Said oin Taimur. A visit to Broadcasting House might be included in the programme and the suggestion has been made that tne oultan (or perhaps a member of his suite) might oe invited to broadcast a short talh in Arabic, the talk being included in one of the programmes of the short wave broadcasts in Arabic which are about to be undertaken by the British Broadcasting Corporation. I should be glad to have your views on this suggestion. 3. A British officer (Mr. Bertram Thomas) was attached to the Sultan’s father during the 1928 visit, and it seems desirable that an officer should be appointed on the present occasion. If you agree I should be glad if you would recommend a suitable officer.4. Assuming that consideration of the Sultan's proposals for revision of the 1891 Treaty will have proceeded sufficiently far, his presence and entertainment in this country might give a good opportunity, if this is agreeable to the Sultan, for making further progress with the question by at any rate informal discussions with him. Atmosphere might be favourable for this and it might moreover save time in view of the delays inevitaoly involved in dealing by telegraph with aspects of the negotiations in 'which other Departments of His Majesty’s Government ai e concerned. For the purpose ox such discussions 01 conversations, however, it would of course be desiraole that we should have available here a political officer competent to conduct them, who might be either the os„icer attached to the Sultan for his visit or an officer deputed for the purpose of such treaty discussions. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. (Bd.) J. C. WALTOH.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.YV.l 13th Deceru'ber, 1937* Dear Gibson With ray letter E 6525/1025/91 of the 25th Noveraher I enclosed a copy of a memorandum hy Beckett about our treaty relations with Muscat. 2. There is one further point which we should perhaps mention. It concerns the so-called Zanzibar subsidy. Towards the end of paragraph 4 of the memorandum Beckett refers to the possibility of using our right to terminate the subsidy as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Sultan to consult us in important matters affecting Muscat’s foreign relations. After looking into the question further it appears to us that even in the matter of the subsidy our powers are less substantial than was at first supposed. 3. So far as we can make out, the Zanzibar subsidy was originally the outcome of the Canning award of 1861. This award was intended to settle a 8EC0. POL. DS?T. 14 DEC1937 dispute/ J.P. Gibson, Esq.dispute 'between the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar, two brothers who had in 1856 inherited their respective Sultanates from their father, the previous Sultan of both Muscat and Zanzibar. By it Zanzibar became independent of Muscat, but at the same time an annual subsidy of 40,000 crowns (86,400 rupees) was to be paid by Zanzibar to Muscat. The subsidy was apparently paid till the death in 1866 of the particular Sultan of Muscat with whom the arrangement had been made. After that the Sultan of Zanzibar objected to paying further, on the ground that it had been due his late brother personally and to nobody else but was eventually persuaded to continue it, on the understanding that payment was to be effected through the Political Agent at Muscat. Further trouble arose in later years and eventually in 1873 an assurance was {■riven to the Sultan of Muscat oi the day by the o Political Agent that so long as he continued faithfully to observe his treaty engagements and ’’manifest his friendship' towards His Majesty’s Government, the subsidy would continue to be paid to him during his reign. 4. Since 1873 the subsidy has been paid to the Sultan’s/Sultan*s successors, including the present Sultan, on the same understanding and with substantially the same provisos, the present position eing governed by the terms of the note which the Political Agent at Muscat addressed to the reigning Sultan on 9th August, 1932, and in which it was stated as regards the Zanzibar subsidy that M Kis Majesty’s Government ’‘will continue this subsidy to Your Highness subject to ”your being in terms of amity and friendship with His ’’Majesty’s Government and faithfully observing your ”treaty engagements.” 5. I am not quite clear at what point the Government of India ceased to recover the subsidy from Zanzibar, but in any case the point has long ceased to be material. 6. We think that in view of the terms of the note of 9th August, 1932, the Sultan would have to do something very flagrant before we could justifiably stop the subsidy. It might not be easy to say exactly when the point was reached at which he was no longer ”in terms of amity and friendship with His Majesty’s ”Government”; but from a strictly legal point of viewat any rate, the mere fact that he acted as an independent sovereign and did not do everything in precisely the way His Majesty's Government wou^-d like, whether in his foreign or his internal affairs, would not in itself constitute a 'breach of the ? true conditions set out in the note. It isj^ime that this statement must, in its turn, he qualified by his letter of 10th February, 1932, in which he undertook to be 'guided by the viev/s of His Majesty's Government in all important matters'. But when it came to the point His Majesty's Government might find, like the man who agreed with his wife that he should decide the important questions and she the unimportant ones, and then found that nothing important ever happened, that it was difficult to translate this undertaking into practical terns. At any.rate the point I wish to make is that Beckett thinks, in the light of further investigation into the origins and conditions of the subsidy, that his reference to the subsidy in his minute/minute was rather too categorical and should he read in the light of the present letter. Yours ever.14 /» L/ y ' &gt;. ^7 nomiDSHTIAL fTTz. 1 t 7607 i 1037 j The Heaidenoy, Buahire, the 26th October, 1937. h.O.flo. 759-3. Loa-**^ ft If pf. p^I 'as//! I have been reading with great interest Rendel 1 s note on a conversation with signor Crolla, Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, forming an enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 19th July 1937* The particular point which strikes me is the reference in paragraphs 6 and 7 to the States 'under British protection' on the Persian Gulf, and to Muscat. I note that Signor Crolla was clearly informed of Muscat’s independent status* The Sultan now proposes to include Rome in his European itinerary, and will no doubt receive a certain amount of attention there. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe. t*-C/ J. G. Walton Esquire, CB. ,MC., The India Office, London. * sent under Printed letter No.760-S of the 26th October 1937.J.p. Dear Gibson, I write in reply to your letter of the 4th November to Brenan (v/ho is away on leave) about the Sultan of Muscat. 2. As Ntherington Smith has already told Symon by telephone, we concur in the terms of the draft telegram to the Government of India enclosed in your letter subject to two verbal alterations in the first paragraph viz. the substitution of the words 'Approach has had the effect 'of acquainting Sultan with our views and it is to be 'hoped that he will in fact consult us' for the corresponding passage 'Approach - consult us in the fourth sentence, and of 'I propose' for 'I should 'be inclined' in the fifth sentence. 3. We also agree with your views regarding the degree of assistance to be given to the Sultan by His Majesty’s Government in the matter of obtaining facilities/ Gibson, 4sq.facilities in foreign countries, and His Majesty 1 s Representatives in the countries which His Highness proposes to visit have 'been informed accordingly. 4. As regards the question of the Sultan’s correspondence with foreign powers, I must confess that we are not entirely happy about our last approach to the Sultan (i.e. the Political Agent's letter No * R-55 of the 5th August to the Sultan). We take our full share of responsibility for this, as we certainly concurred in the terms of the proposed communication. But I feel sure we did not visualise a letter in quite such abrupt terms or realise that the pill which the Sultan was expected to swallow would not be gilded by enveloping it in phraseology and circumlocutions appropriate to a com runication addressed to an Oriental ruler. The fault is ours for not making our assumption clear. But at any rate it seems evident that the Sultan, who appears to be growing more and more sensitive to interference in his affairs and is moreover an independent ruler, whose policy, whether foreign or internal, we control by custom only and not by any legal right (unless we count the letter which he wrote on the 10th February, 1932 after his accession promising to be guided by our advice in important/important matters), has taken the opportunity for making a 'breach in the customary position. 5. On the other hand we note that Fowle thinks the whole transaction has done good, and that having said his say on paper, the Sultan will 'behave discreetly in practice. We hope this will prove to 'be the case, 'but we feel that we shall have to watch our step in future communications to the Sultan if v/e are to maintain without open wrangling the position of practical ascendancy in his affairs which we have managed to establish 'by custom. V/e agree, therefore, that it is advisable to proceed cautiously and that it will be better for the time being not to pursue the question of our alleged right to consultation. 6. In this connexion I enclose a copy of a memorandum by Beckett on the subject of our relations with Muscat, which I think you will agree forms a very useful addition to Laithwaite T s admirable memorandum of the 2nd November, 1934 (India Office Confidential print B. 458. F.Z. 681l/5 4j, and which shows that our treaty rights in regard to Muscat are,in fact, extremely tenuous.Copy (E 6525/1023/91) 7769 Relations of His Iiajesty’s Government with the Sultan of Muscat. ■ The declaration of 1862 under which hoth we and the French engaged ourselves reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat applied also the Sultan of Zanzibar. By the Anglo-French Declarations of the 5th August, 1890, this declaration was abrogated as regards Zanzibar, and the Sultai of Zanzibar now enjoys no independence whatever in the international sense of the word, but is the ruler of a British protected State. The abrogation of the declaration as regards Zanzibar leaves it still in force however as regards Muscat and it seems to have been relied upon by both t&gt;ie French and ourselves subsequently to 1890. 2. The essence of the declaration of 1862 is the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. How one of the rights of an independent State is the right of alienating a portion of its territories if it wishes, unless it has entered into an engagement uo tne contrary. Unuer the Exclusive Agreement of 1891 the Sultan of Muscat bound himself towards the United Kingdom no o l.o cede, seol, etc. save to the British Government any portion of his dominions. I think it is perfectly consistent with the agreement of 1862 for us to obtain an undertaking from the Sultan of Muscat that he would never cede any part of his dominions to any other Power. The only questionable part of tiiio Exclusive Agreement lay in the words '’save to the British ’’Government/’’Government, ” words which it was very foolish to have inserted, since the effect of the agreement of 1891 was exactly the same without these words in (since the Sultan could not cede territory to the British Government without the British Government’s consent and if they consented there was no oreach of the agreement of 1891) and the existence of these words gave the French the only handle they could have had for pretending that the agreement of 1891 conflicted with the declaration of 1862. When in 1899 the Sultan had leased a coaling station in iiis territories to the French we quite rightly objected to the Sultan that this was contrary to the agreement of 1891 and made him cancel it on this ground. In their objections to the French His Majesty’s Government relied:- 1) On the agreement of 1891. 2) On the declaration of 1862. In reply to this the French Government could quite rightly contend that the Exclusive Agreement of 1891 was res inter alios acta so far as they were concerned, but I am less certain that His Majesty’s Government could say that the lease was contrary to the declaration of 1862. Indeed, as a matter of legal construction, I doubt if His Majesty’s Government’s contention was right that the lease was a breach of the Declaration of 1862. That does not matter now, however, because in the end His Majesty’s Government’s interpretation of the declaration of 1862 that it precluded either the French or ourselves from acquiring any territory from the Sultan of Muscat was accepted by both sides and must I think govern the future interpretation of the declaration. 3. I should hesitate to accept as legally correct the view of the Law Officers in paragraph 2 of their opinion of 1899 that the British Government would be justified in punishing and even deposing a particular sultan who broke his engagements/engagements to the British Government and that such action would he consistent with the declaration of 1862. I can conceive no greater interference with the independence of a State than the forcible deposition of its ruler and his replacement by another. Leasing a little bit of territory is a very small matter compared with this. l.y only purpose in making this observation is to point out that the Law OfficeTs view of 1899 is not one which we could probably establish in an international dispute conducted on legal lines. ye should never ourselves accept such an interpretation of the 1862 declaration if the French Government thought of deposing a sultan. 4. It would appear from the above that there is no treaty which His Majesty's Government can appeal to as obliging the Sultan of Muscat to consult or even inform His Majesty's Government as regards his dealings with foreign Powers unless he v/as contemplating alienating a bit of his territory in which case the declaration of 1891 could be appealed to. Further, as a matter of strict lav/, it is in fact contrary to the declaration of 1862 for His Majesty's Government to insist that he should do. To compel him to do so is exercising our influence in a manner v/hich (l think) is inconsistent with independence. I do not suggest, however, that it is necessary for us at the present time to construe and apply the declaration of 1862 very strictly. In fact the biggest lever we have over the Sultan would appear to be the Zanzibar subsidy which I believe he receives annually through the political Agent and I suppose, if and when we wish to do so and if we think it effective, we can use the possibility of the termination of this subsidy as a lever for exercising our influence inter alia in connexion with insisting on being consulted on the Sultan's relations with a foreign power. I gather the French know of the subsidy and do not object to it; otherwise/otherwise it would he maintainable that the subsidising of ruler was at least as prejudicial to his independence as obtaining the lease of a little bit of his territory.

He is due to leave Bombay on the 30th November by the Lloyd Triestino steamer, and will make his first stop at Singa.pore, where he will remain for about a week before leaving for Japan. We understand that the Lloyd Triestino steamer which leaves Bombay on 3Cth November is due to arrive at Singapore on 6th December. The Sultan’s party will consist of the following:- 1.Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, Sultan’s brother. 2 . Halal bin Badr, Secretary. 3. Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily, State Official. 4.Saiyid Abdulmunim Zawawi, A.D.C. 5.Two servants. As you are probably aware, the Sultan is an independent potentate in treaty relations with H.M.G., and it is probable that he will be treated a,s an official guest for a short period during his visit to this country. Although His Highness has not asked for any assistance in connection with his , proposed/proposed tour, we should be grateful if the above information could be passed on to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, with the request that His Excellency will afford the Sultan^ such courtesies and facilities as may be possible during his short stay at Singapore.

Please see Bushire Express Letter of 28th Septemher at P.Z.7021/37. We have asked for the Government of India f s views in regard to the Sultan’s request to he treated as a State guest when he comes to England, and it is now necessary to consider what further action, if any, should he taken regarding the question of the Sultan’s correspondence with foreign Pov/ers. The Foreign Office have asked that this matter should he dealt with separately. 2. Sir Trenchard Fowle * s views are contained in his Note of 29th October below. The Sultan does not take kindly to outside influence and it has been obvious for some time that he is doing everything he can to assert and emphasise his own independence. That being so, it would seem that no useful purpose would be served in attempting to press the Sultan further at this stage. S^r Trenchard Fowle, v/ho knows the Sultan well, considers that the approach has done good, and he thinks ; that now His Highness knows our views he v/ill probably consult us in advance on any important matter which he proposes to take up with foreign Powers, e.g. the revision of his existing Treaties with the U. S.A. and France. Subject, therefore, to any views which the Foreign Office and the Government of India may have to offer, it seems best to let the matter rest for the present. 3. As regards the Sultan’s visits to foreign countries, it seems obvious that he is content to rely on his own pov/ers to obtain facilities, etc. , and Sir Trenchard Fov/le does not consider that we should go out of our way to press our services on him, provided that it is made 6474 b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 lOP n _ /clear to the Sultan that H.

I enclose for information a copy of a letter from tne i Political Agent, Muscat, to tne Sultan, and of nia reply. 3* It will be seen tnat, althougn tone of Sultan^ letter is on the whole restrained, he resists advice that he should give information through Political Resident to His Majesty’s Government of any communications which he proposes to maJce to foreign powers. He qualifies this attitude by statement tnat he has at present no important communications to maiee to any foreign power (though even here he proposes to consult His Majesty’s Government only in cases when he considers it to be in his own interests to do so;* Effect is, moreover, considerably discounted by his obvious desire to be entertained by His Majesty’s Government ana to have the honour of audience with His Majesty The King.] 3( - 2 - 4* As regards communications to foreign powers I doubt whether any purpose will be served in attempting to press Sultan further except by means of friendly explanations for which opportunities will no doubt present themselves both during fortn^ coming visit to Delhi and subsequently in England* It may for instance be possible to convey verbally a hint somewhat in terms of final sentence of paragraph 3 of Powle’s telegram No*650 of 1st July* 5. For the rest Sultan sets out an indefinite programme for a round-the-world journey, starting from India after visit to Delhi, via Japan and U*S*A. to London, and tnence bacX through Prance and possibly other European countries, only fixed date x. being arrival in London on March loth 1938. Date proposed for his departure is likely to be inconvenient in tnat negotiations will still be afoot for revision of Muscat Commercial Treaty at express request of Sultan himself* Projected tour will take him through Japan and America in depth of winter and bring him to England at inclement time of year* Visit to the IJ.S*A* may possibly lead to some embarrassment, if question of tariff revision is under discussion as a result of negotiations for revision of his treaty with His Majesty’s Government. Finally owing to Sultan’s protracted recess in Dhofar we have had so little opportunity of maintaining touch with him that renewed absence at this juncture will certainly be ill-timed. Sultan is due to leave for Delhi on 7th November and, if ne adheres to his programme, he will be unable to meet the Resident again until he returns from his world tour. 6* Subject however to Powle’s views I feel that little is, to be gained by placing these considerations before Sultan and endeavouring to prevail on him to postpone his tour. tfe may hope tnat treaty negotiations will be well on way before visit to /i: &gt;3WB' 1 h '*»• ***■ »5 \ to Delni, and it would probably be preferable to use some of these arguments as means to induce Sultan to agree to continuation of present Treaty until such time as new agreement can taice snape# I tnerefore recommend tnat Sultan be informed tnat his majesty's Government are glad to near of nis projected visit and will welcome nim as State guest* nis request to be received by nis Majesty when he visited England in 192b and was received by nis Majesty, (see correspondence ending witn your telegram .tto*1664 of otn July 1923)* There are also recent precedents of visits ox Snaiicns of Kuvrei t and Banrain, and it will no doubt be tnougnt desirable to accord similar treatment to sultan* as regards projected It may be possible, despite attitude taken in nis lo^ , wv suggest to Sultan tnat nis Majesty’s Government will be glad to communicate on nis behalf witn governments concerned if ne will inform them in more detail of nis itinerary* will no doubt receive consideration* 7* Sultan’s father was treated as State guest for one month visits to iftrance and other European countries, wnen ad* O* K* Caroe* /I Officiating political Kesinent in the Persian Gulf* Attested* for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*Copy of a letter No.R-55, dated the 5th August 1937 from the Political Agent and H.B.M*^Consul, Muscat at Ziarat to Kis Highness the Sultan oif Muscat end Oman at Karachi.

And are, as We have ever been, very grateful to Our friend. His Majesty’s Government, for their kind favours and good wishes for the prosperity of Our State. We do not doubt their helpful attitude to assist and give all necessary facilities, whenever these are wished, ane. recuired by Ua, «6 has always been their custom with our pr^f^e.osors and with Us in view of the close friendship existing since Treaties have been exchanged between the ' &amp;nd 0ur Government.Z m Ion will probably remember that after Our return from Dhofar in February last We received the letter addressed to Us toy the Hon^ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in regard to the Coronation of His Majesty the King in London* In Our reply to him We mentioned that We *ould visit Loudon when the opportunity offered and would then see His Majesty the King and have the pleasure of His &amp;.ijoscy f s personal acquaintance and that that meeting Y.ouid be a substitute for the secting at the time of His Coronation. You will also remember that rhile in Karachi oorir.) mtm and a half months p^o *t ore of •'hir meetings a mention .vas made of Our visit to Fngl&amp;nd in the course of a talk about Our visit to Tf i8 PKc^llency the Viceroy and. Governor General for India in Yovember next* We then asked you hov long a period wa.$ necessary to notify Hl$ Majesty^s Government when r . r e intended to proceed to England* &gt;!ou replied that We should notify them at laest six months beforehand. There was no doubt that you understood that We held tne Intention of going there, tuougri you were not sure of it and did not know the time ffe intended to toe in England* We ourselves were not sure about it and when it should be. So, we were not in a position to intimate it to you, but intended to inform you in good time when We ma3&gt;e Our determina tion. Hence Our question as stated above. There is no doubt that Our travels in Europe is not &amp; matter ol secrecy and that fe have to inform you ol it in good time, as We shall pass through your Possessions and shall request you to arrange the necessary facilities for Us when fte are in your Countries, 5* As for Our writing a letter to Our friend the President of the U.8.A. and what We stated therein. It is a/is a fact that We wrote a letter to him on the occasion of his assuming the office of the President of the U.S.A, for the second time, offer^in^ him Oar congratulations. This !e did in view of the bonds of friendship existing between Us and that Government since a long time. We took this opportunity ana mentioned to him what you stated in your letter: that We intended to travel in turopo and suggested that m might visit him in America to renew the bonds of friendship. This letter W© ^rote to him a few days after We had written Our reply to the Political K esident in the Arslan Gulf’s letter to which ; We have made a reference above, We thought 'lien We decided to travel in Europe the distance from there to the U,S,A# would be short and We could visit it at the same time. We did not inform the Hon’ble the Political Resident of either of theae projects, because, have already stated, We had not made Our decision, 6 , There is no doubt that We realize what are the Treaty Relations that exist between Us and the British Government, We do not think that Our writing directly f to the President of the U* 8 .A, would make a breach of the I provisions of the Treaty, Further, as you are aware, I there are Treaties between Us and the Governments of the | U.S,A, and France and We have to write to them directly 1 on certain occasions when necessity calls for it. 7 , as for previous communications on the subject of the increase of the Muscat Tariff. That was done as a result of special representations made by Our Government and not by the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for that matter only. We recognize the pains taken by the British Government over this question and Our benefitting therefrom, which is due to their kind and benevolent attitude.8 You stated that His Majesty»s Government would be grateful if We would inform them through the Hon*ble the Political R/eeident in the Persian Gulf of ; any communication we Intended to sen}to foreign Powers, We thank you for these expressions. You are well aware th*t at present '.Te have no treaty relations with any foreign Powex’S but the ana France with whom Our Government have since time long ago been communi cating directly in accordance with the treaty relations existing between U$ and them* We do not want to incon venience the British Government with any communicetinns f but those which We consider ougnt to go through them. We are confident that the British Government would never agree that their officials should make such demands as neither Our predecessors nor Ourselves have been accus tomed to dO There is no doubt that whenever We have matters on which We think His ffz Jesty f s Government - 1|| | * should be consulted, We shall not fail to do so, at oresent there are no importent communications which We intend to make to any foreign power that re should, according to the Hon*ble the Political Resident, ask His Majesty*s Government to communicate with such -’owesr on Our behalf. But should ? r e have any such communi cations in future and We consider that I t is in Our interests to send them through His Majesty’s Govern ment We would be pleased to do so, in view of the advantages that this will give to Us. Otherwise W© mi11 ''tunKn^mkiunm «i»~i '&lt; i' 11,11 n ■ &lt;*' shall continue to act in accordance with the old pro cedure which is usual to Our Government, and shall not in the least inconvenience His Majesty’s Government and their officials* 10. We are well aware, as stated by you, of all the common interests and close relations existing between/between Uc and His Majesty’s Government, and We are always observant of and following the path of friend ship and affection that bind Us with His Majesty’s Government, in accordance with the old conventions and \ even more. Moreover, We shall endeavour as far as possible to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Us and maintain the independence and interests of Our State. 11. Now We would Inform you to convey the follow ing to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian'' Gulf for communication to Our friend the British Govern- ' ment j - God willingly and trusting in Almi^ty God, We intend to visit His Excellency the Viceroy at Delhi ’ in the month of November next, as We have Jf&amp;ready in formed you. This visit having been fulfilled. We shall proceed to Bombay in an unofficial capacity, thence We shall leave for the Far East to visit Our Lord and esteemed Father, which is 0 ur duty towards him (and We have already informed you of this)• America being nearer from there We shall make Our way to it and | visit His Excellency the president of the U.S.A., having intimated In Our letter to him that We would visit him when We visited Europe.

We do not want to return from the Far East to India and chence proceed to Europe, for this means a longer dis tance and We have not got the time for it, as We want to return early to Our State and pay attention to the many reforms of which it stands in need.1®.

But, on the whole, I think it best for him to make his own contacts. As, however, he is said to be diffident in personal relationships, he might be given aid of political probationer. Possibly he could be reassured by message that meeting with His Excellency will be personal and direct. 3. I think it important that Watts should attend the meetit^ between the Sultan and (?

My dear Sir Trenchard, In connection with the correspondence now going on between yourself and His Majesty’s Government regarding the Sultan 1 s proposed visit to President Hoosevelt at Washington it may interest you to learn that he informed me at Karachi that he intended to make a trip to Japan this year in order to see his father Saiyid Taimur who is living at present at Kobe. 2. I understood from the Sultan that he has not addressed the Japanese Government on the subject as his visit will be a private one. If the Viceroy is able to receive him at Delhi, as requested, in November, the Sultan told me that he intended proceeding thence straight to Japan via Calcutta and would be returning to Muscat sometime in February of next year. Yours sincerely, Sd. H.P. Watts.

The Sultan was much impressed at the quickness of the handling and accurate firing displayed and is now, it is hoped, convinced that the military type of light automatic weapons as used by the British Army is the most suitable for use in his own Levy Corps. at the request of the Political Agent after consultation with the Commandant of the Muscat Levy, Captain Byard, who was anxious to dissuade the Sultan from his desire to purchase a number of fancy weapons of American manufacture of which he had lately been showing a tendency. and in a recent conversation with the Political Agent he said that the last time he was in India he had seen in some films of life in America a remarkable light machine gun of a new type which in the scenes depicted had carried out terrific execution on crowds of people. The Sultan said with a yearning tone in his voice that he would much like to possess a few of these weapons as they would be invaluable for sweeping the bazaars in troublesome towns since to quote his words 'these guns are evidently expressly designed to extinguish life'. Both Captain Byard and myself had assured the Sultan that good as were these American weapons which are, I believe, known as 'Sub machine guns', the types used in the force such as his Levy. The demonstration was accordingly arranged and has had, it is hoped, the desired effect. The demonstration was given by the military authorities The Sultan it turns out is a regular cinema 'fan' British Army were more suited to the requirement of a military His Highness left Karachi en route to Kashmere for 'f' A-Notes.

Muscat seems to specialise in absentee Sultans. Although the peregrinations of the present Ruler have not taken him as far afield as his father, yet the difficulties of communication between Dhofar and the Capital are such that direct contact with the Sultan is almost impossible. This is very irritating for our officers, as there is at least one important question — that of the boundaries Muscat vi-s-a vio Saudi Arabia - which needs urgent consideration. There is, however, nothing to be done, but it might be a good thing, if opportunity arises, of reading him a good lesson as Colonel powle suggests. 3330 1000 12.34 Al v tAK ^ uoJ MU ^i Confident l&amp;l The Residency.

The position is obviously not satisfactory, but our hands are somewhat tied by the arguments touched on in para graph 3 of ^atta 1 letter: i.e. we have to help the Sultan whether we want to or not, and we can do no more at present than tfhat we have already done (.latte 1 paragraph 6).

He replied he would be staying in Dhofar until next October at least as he wished to remain on up to May at which time the monsoon would have started and so cause a delay until the autumn before it would be possible for him to make the journey back. I said I was sorry that we should not be seeing him for such a long time and I was afraid moreover that especially during the monsoon season, when he would be for practical purposes isolated from us, that a good deal of inconvenience would be caused if some important matter requiring reference to him cropped up# To this the Sultan replied that we had already settled all outstanding matters and he could not imagine anything of an urgent and serious nature arising which Sayid Shahab his Representative could not settle. I then said that you had heard with some The Hon* die Lieut.-Col# T.C.Fowle, GBE., concern / Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire#- 2 - concern of His Highness's intention not to return to his capital in April and that you wished me to impress on him that should anything untoward happen in the State by reason of his absence in Dhofar that it would be his responsibility alone and not that of His Majesty's Government. To all this the only answer I got ^as a beaming smile and the pious expression and hope that no such untoward event would happen* 3, As you are well aware the Sultan is quite a young man but he is no fool and I feel myself that he is very much alive to the real facts of the situation that if, on the one hand, he is entirely dependent upon us for the maintenance of the existence of his State, on the other hand we are bound for our own interests to support him and that we could not afford to allow the State to disintegrate* He feels confident therefore that if a crisis arose our help would always be forthcoming. 4. From what I saw at Sal ala 1 think there are good grounds for believing that the present Sultan intends to follow closely in the footsteps of his Father i.e* enjoy himself as much as possible and let others look after his State. The life of a country gentleman at Dhofar appeals to him more than the cares and worries of public affairs in Muscat and combating the intrigues of his numerous uncles* The Sultan is doing up his private house at Salala from top to bottom and to judge from those rooms I saw he has made a good job of it* New furniture has been imported from Bombay, fly-proof gauze is being put in over doors and windows and a twin-engined electric lighting set has been installed complete with refrigerator. Some twenty ki horses and two cars were taken down in November last from Muscat. /-3- 5. The Sultan talks about developing the fertile province of Dhofar by experimenting with cotton and rubber growing but I saw nothing to disprove the obvious fact that the real object of his prolonged stay is toanuse and enjoy himself. Shooting excursions in motor cars, marking out roads in the small cultivated area of Salala, doing up his house, making a garden at his 'shooting camp' - a pleasant little spot some three miles distant - with radio, gramaphone and small cinema displays in the evenings appear to absorb most of his time. The Sultan’s small brother aged about twel^ve years is with him and the latter’s tutor Ismail Effendi who isused also to carry out various odd duties. The 'Court Jester' a certain Muscati Arab, famous for his indecent jokes, whom the Sultan took with him to Bombay on his last trip and upon whom he is said to have lavished gifts, completes the establishment at Salela. 6. This does not of course reveal a satisfactory state of affairs but I do not see, under all the circumstances, what more can be done at present than give the Sultan, as you directed, the warning of the possible consequences of prolonging his stay in Dhofar and neglecting the affairs of his State.

The political effect of the tour was apparently excellent and shows how much can be done with Arabs by the personal touch of the Ruler.

His Highness’ youngest brother aged about 8 years and doctor Mardi the stout and cheerful Assistant Surgeon, lent to us by xind favour of the Political Agent, proceeded in my car* cooking pots, etc. to resemble a steep mountain around which, like leeches, hung the Royal cooks, scullions, euC. Precariously perched at the back was Sha’ar, the Court Jestei , clad in an enormous ’Amamah and a long and shabby cloak which might have been tne latest fashion in the days of the Caliph His Highness’ party or Shoma, was composed entirely The rest of us, including myself, little Saiyid Fahr Behind us came the Morris lorry piled with luggage, These unfortunates had a very strenuous Haroun al Rashid*time as, in ed ition to being constantly raked fore and aft by the long thorns of Ghaf trees overhanging the road, they were expec-ed also to push the lorry through the frequent patches of heavy sand as well as assist in mending punctures, etc. His Higiiness 1 tour occupied about fourteen days and was broken up by halts of from 1 to 3 days at each district head quarters. Outstanding cases were settled and several changes were made amongst the walis. At Barkah difficulties in collection of ^akat revenue were satisfactorily settled by His Highness’ personal influence with the Shaikhs. At Swaik His Highness was entertained and spent the night at the residence of Shaikh Hilal bin Hamed, Chief of the Yal Ssad. The arrival of the Shoma at each halting place presented a rather imposing spectacle. Approaching in mass formation upon a broad front, the camels would be halted some hundreds of yards before reaching the encampment and indulge in races pair by pair on the hard sand along the waters edge. Amusement was provided by the frequent falls of the competitors and in some cases camels took fright and bolted into the sea to the embarrassment of their riders. Kxcept for those places where houses were available accommodation consisted of date palm shelters erected on the beach or other open ground. An open air Barza or meeting was held each morning at about 7 acxw. this being attended by several hundred of the local inhabitants for paying of respects and putting forward grievances. Heals were taken twice a day, morning and after-noon, and consisted of the usual Arab dishes of rice, fish, chicken, bread, etc. The hearty laughter necessary for the proper digestion of these delicacies was provided/provided by the presence at the end of the table of the Court Jester whose indignant protests and recriminations at the indigni ties inflicted upon him by the flibian slaves and his immediate .neighbour added further zest to the horse-play anu agreeably **s. enlivened the assembly. Occasionally, as a mark of great favour, His Highness would be pleased to select a bare and gnawed bone for presentation to'*him, when the poor man’s vigorous exhortations repudiation of such unseemly gifts and axtoKkifixa to the cultan to remember his position and dignity would arouse the assembly to even greater Heights of merriment. His Highness was met and accompanied by all the important Shaikhs owing allegiance to Muscat, and at Sahar the Shaikh of Baraimi also appeared. The effects of this tour upon the Batineh as a whole have been excellent and, but for this, it would have been difficult to carry on the administration during His Highness’ projected long absence at Dhofar, *****SIDEXED CONFlDlN^’IiX.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.C.48 of 4th March, I have the honour to enclose herewith the trans lation of a letter from His Highness the Sultan on the subject of his visit to Dhofar. The letter is a long one, and His Highness is at pains as you will see - to explain that he is not visiting Dhofar on a 'holiday' but on business, and aske me especially to forward his communication to Government. I daresay His Highness may do some reorganization of the Dhofar administration, but it will not take him the seven months or so he proposes to stay there. However, the difference of opinion oetween His Highness and myself on this point is quite a friendly one. His Highness brought across his letter with him unsigned to the Agency ( at Muscat) where he was lunching with Major Bremner and myself, and ai. te- having gone through it with me asked whether it was 'alrignt*. I replied 'quite', and that I would be pleased to forward it to Government. Thereupon he signed it. S2. In the course of his letter His Highness draws a ^comparison between the Council of Ministers vmich existed c'in the time of his father, and the Council of Deputies which ne His Highness - has formed to carry on during aisluring his absence at Dhofar, and claims that the latter Council can he given the same measure of assistance hy Gl-overnment, as was afforded to the former. I explained carefully to His Highness that the position and status of the two Councils were entirely distinct. The Council of Ministers was a Council of Regency, with His Highness himself - then Heir Apparent - as President formed because fc the late Sultan insisted upon living abroad, and had virtually ceased to be Sultan in everything but name. Affairs no?; - I was happy to say - were on quite a different footing. His Highness was the Ruler, both in reality as well as name, there was therefore no question of a Council of Regency, and any Council which His Highness might institute to deal with routine matters during his absence could not be regarded in any way as a substitute for himself. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- T.C.Fowle. Lt. Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Dated 8th Ziqaadeh 1551 r 8th March 1933. From His Highness Sayed Said hin Taimoor Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Mus cat. To The Hon*hle Lieutenant Oolonel T.O.Fowle, Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. After Compliments, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.C.47, dated 4th March 1933, and understood what you mentioned therein in connection with what we discussed atiout my going to Dhofar and my enjoying holiday, etc. I reply to you (as ‘below). Firstly. That Your Honour as well as H.B.M. *s Consul Major Bremner well understood from me that my journey to my territory Dhofar is not only for holiday and a change t&gt;ut it is also for effecting some reform there hoping that it should have a good future and that it should Be favouraBle to this side of my country in future. Aid as regards your remark that that part of the State is severed from communication Because steamers do not call there a: on stormy days, etc. I Beg to state in reply that during the rainy season and when the sea is stormy it is possible to send a messenger to Dhofar and from there to Muscat By the land route whenever any important matter may crop up: the journey from one place to the other will take aBout twenty and a few days. If I were to think that Dhofar is far away from Muscat and no interest must therefore Be taken in her affairs how can we then wish a £ good future for her? And you, undoubtedly, would not agree that anypart of my country should remain neglected. ind as I have already explained to you in my absence a Council of Deputies which I shall form, will look into the affairs of the State. I further beg to state that this Council is not the first one that has 'been formed in our State: one Council preceded i t in the past and during its days it enjoyed the help and counsels of our friend the British Government. Then why should this Council which I now organize be deprived from the assistance of the High Government during my absence? I have firm hope in the High Government and their officials to help this my Council in important and intricate affairs as it was the case with my father's Council of Ministers which I presided over for two years and half and during that period I experienced nothing 'but complete assistance from the High Government and their officials which they rendered in serious matters. And I hope and trust in God Almighty that no untoward event will happen in this part during my tour to my territory Dnofar. And I beg to state in conclusion that what you told me verbally and im mentioned in your letter is nothing else except that friendship which I know you harbour towards me and those good wishes which you entertain towards my status as Ruler (of my country). You have mentioned that you would send a copy of your letter referred to above to your Government in order that they should know as to ho?/ the matter stands. I also reguest Your Honour to send the original of this my letter (which is a reply to yours) with your own to your Govern ment so that they should also kno?/ my reply to you. I have no doubt that the Government would not agree to what will bring me losses in the future if I were no?; to neglect that part of the State. Your Honour knows well as to ho?/ many reforms I enforced in Dhofar during the past year and which I do not see existing no?;. Hence thethe journey to Bhofar for 'bettering its affairs hecause it is wanting in law and order. I thank you for your good wishes towards my Government and trust to enjoy a holiday in Dbofar and to return safe and sound. ind I repeat my statement that my journey to Bhofar and staying there for a long time, as mentioned hy you, is for nothing else except for v. enforcing orders in that part of the State. I have the honour to renew the assurance of my respects. Usual Ending.COmDsyTIfl L.

I have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Sultan of Muscat and which explains itself. It is unfortunate that His Highness should insist on being absent from his headquarters for so long. I cannot, however, prevent him going. Moreover, since coming to the throne he has certainly tackled the various problems of his i^tate energetically and has shown good will in carrying out our suggestions - lately at Gwador for instance, vide my letter No. C-41 of 3rd March - so I suppose it is not unnatural for hin to take some relaxation. At the same time I thought it as well to make it quite clear that the responsibility for any contretemps which might occur on account of his absence was entirely his, not ours. ENCLOSURE IN ! !

With reference to our conversation of yesterday at which Fajor Bremner was present on the subject of Your Highness's visit to Dhofar, leaving Fuscat early in April and returning about the middle of October. I pointed out to Your Highness that in my opinion this was a long time for you to be absent from your Capital in a district which, though situated within the limits of your State, is Q.uite cut off from the out side world. No steamers call at Dhofar, during the Fonsoon no dhows can reach or leave it, and there is j of course no wireless installation there. During the time you are away therefore Your Highness will be completely out of touch with the Government of your State. In answer to these arguments Your Highness replied that the Council, which you proposed forming to officiate during your absence, would be able to do all that was necessary. I explained that from my point of view, and that of my Government, it was q.uite impossible to afford the same measure of support to a temporary Council in an emergency, should such arise, as it would be in liKe circumstance to Your Highness, however decided to visit Dhofar, as you have intimated, involving some seven and a half months absence from Fuscat. I therefore considered it to be my duty to explain to Your Highness that should any thing untoward in the State happen by reason of Your Highness's absence, it would of course be Your HighnessHighness*s responsibility and in no v^ay mine or my Government's. I am sending a copy of this letter to the latter so that they may he informed of the situa tion. 1 thought it as u/ell to have the record of our conversation in writing, which is the reason 1 am sending Your Highness this letter.
