In continuation of my telegram No. 1158, dated October 15th, I have the honour to report that consequent on the death of Shaikh Tahnun bin Zaid, Chief of the Abu Dhabi on the Arab Coast, which took place on October nth last, the succession to the chiefship has devolved on the late Chief's brother Hamdan bin Zaid. a. On receipt of Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid's letter announcing the death of Shaikh Tahnun and his own succession to the chiefship, I wrote a letter of condolence to him, and, in a separate communication, whilst congratulating him and taking note of his expressed desire to adhere to and maintain the obligations which had devolved upon him asked him to inform me in writing that he accepted the obligations of Treaty and usage as his predecessors have done, and that he was steadfastly determined to act up to them. Learning however that the copy of the bound compilation of Treaties which had been given to his predecessor in 1909 had been lost, I forwarded a fresh copy to him. I now attach a transla tion of his acknowledgment, which may, I think be accepted as sufficient, and therefore request authority to accord him recognition.

Usual Knding.Repor t. , * Z * ' From - The Residency Agent, Shargah. To - The Hon'ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Ho.88. Dated 9th March 1927. A.C . I beg to state that the messenger who was sent to Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid the Chief of Abu Dhabi to deliver to him Your Honour's letter asking him to recover the Indian boy from Muhammad bin Rashid, informed me (on his return) that he had seen with his own eyes 12 boats and 2 booms v/hich the Shaikh had ready to start, the boats were loaded with 400 armed men and the two booms with 4 guns and shells of old pattern HW&amp;X,. They left for the Seer island which belongs to Beni Yas, and the islands of Dalma and Ghagha. They were under the command of Ziab bin tjciqor the son of Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid. It is understood that Shakhboot and Plaza the sons of the late Sultan bin Zaid had proceeded from ^atar to Dalma. to see their^ uncles who belong to the Qebyat tribe and reside at Dalma and that Ziab had gone there with his force to fight Shakhboot and Haza. After the return of the above messenger from Abu Dhabi I received a letter from Shai±:h ^aqar bin Zaid, the extract from which is enclosed herewith for your information. The Shaikh has mentioned therein that he had sent his son, Ziab to the Islands which corroborate the statement made by my messenger. 'fterwards I received news from Abu Dhabi saying that the sons of Sultan bin Zaid had returned to t^atar from Dalma.y one night before the arriva^ at Seer^ of Ziab bin Saqar and that the latter pursued them by the two booms which were loaded with guns and 150 men; nothing further has yet been knov/n as to what hapx^ened after that. When the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast and' especially the Shaikhs of the Jawasims tribe heard that Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid had sent his son Ziab with troops by sea to figh^ they thought that the High British Government have removed- 2 - the restriction (regarding despatch of tropps) by sea tnat any chief of a town or island whose subjects might have rebelled against him is allowed to send troops by sea to fight and subdue them or to restore any island which might have been occupied by torce. The Shaikhs especially those of Jawasims tribe v/no own towns and islands on the sea side are having a talk on this matter, and I think if the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who has cOLimitted this breach of law will be left alone there is a likelihood of a breach of peace in the sea in these parts. Decision rests with you. Extract of a letter dated 26th Shaban 1M5 ( /• 3 * ) from Shaikh baqar bin Zaid, the Chief of Abu Dhabi, to the Residency Agent, Shargah. r: liy son Ziab has / today proceeded to the eastern islands viz Dalma and its neighbourhood for some business which is perhaps not hidden to you. I had received news and letters from the inhabitants of those islands which belong to me saying that the sons of Sultan aoco^panied by some mischief- makers had gone to some of those islands. I was afraia that perhaxjs they may ooianit mischief and attack my suo^ects therefore I have sent my son to safeguard the islands and turn out the sons Ox oultan.I• - -■I SET »From - The Residency Agent, Shargah.

A • C • With reference to your letter No.224, dated the 18th Octoter 1927, calling for a report on the subject of the Shaikh of Dehai's remarkinjhis letter dated the 16th oafar 1346 (14-8-27) to me that Shaikh Hamad bin Ibrahim, Chief of Umm-ul-^aiwain, had sent a force by sea to Shargah in support of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad bin Sultan against his cousin. I beg to state that the Shaikh of Debai expressed that opinion at the same time when Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad attacked Shargah about which I reported in my letter No.221, dated the 9th June 1927. The Shaikh of Shargah told me that as Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad had suddenly entered Shargah he must have come by sea and moreover the said Shaikh claimed that the Shaikh of Umm ul Qaiwain had confiscated a boat and had taken from a man of Shargah pearls to the value of Rs.6000/-. I made enqmiries into the matter and found that neither the entering of Khalid bin Ahmad into Shargah by sea nor the confiscation of the boat and the pearls by the Shaikh of Umm ul Qaiwain was correct. On the 21st June 1927 v ;hen the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, arrived there he instituted enquiries in all differences which occurred between Shaikh Khalid, his cousin and the Shaikh of Umm ul Q^iwain; the Shaikh of Debai was also present. He arranged a peace between the parties and a written agreement was drawn between them as per copy forwarded with my letter No.277, dated the 30th June 1927. Since then neither any incident happened by sea not by land. The shaikh of Shargah granted the village of Dhaid to Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad as was mentioned in article 5 of the agreement. ^ eCl L- - T- ? cvul .A.■mm^ v vOV. ■ 'wfo ^ ' ' / ac/ x Translation.

A . 0 • V/ith reference to my telegram No.51 oonoerning fi _iJj3ini no the happening at Ummul Qafwain, I nave the honoai to report for your information that from enquirieB institute^ the murder of the Shaikh of Ummul Q.a^raiiii hy his ssrr^nt named Said and his unole A*bdur J^ehman 'bin \hmed is oommitt- ed at the instance of certain persons united in the jlut. These men are Vhmad Mn Kashid, the present Shaikh of T Tmmul- QaWlllf his nephew AMulla^'bin Said y a man called Abdullah 'bin Rashid, an inhabitant of Ummul Q,aSfain and the shaikh of Shargah as their secret partisan. The proof of this is the admission of a man from Ummul QaVain. Tie servant and Vbdur Behman have been,on purpose, burnt so that no ne\ys should leak out of them. The proof that the Shaikh of Shargah has a hand in this plot ** is that when he received the news of the murder of the Shaikh of Ummul Q,awain, he sent a man going b^ name Abdullah bin Bashid to that town and the man came back to ^hargah and then the Shaikh of ^largah ri^ge^ i boat with 60 men and made for Ummul Qavwain on th^retext of going there to offer his condolences! to the relatives of the murdered Shaikh) but in reality it/wds to o^er congratu lations to^^haikh and to ask him to irive out o: Ummul at- wain Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed- the ex-ruler of Shargah, who is in exile at Ummul Qa^wain. Here I should mention for your information that on June 24, 1927(2 ( 3rd ^ilaejjah, 1 345) tae S.N.0 on board H.M.S. '•Lupin'* drew a treaty between Shaikh Sultan bin Saq.ar and Khalid bin Ahmad and a copy * y '^7 of that treaty was sent to you under my letter r To.277, dated the 30th June 1927 and the murdered Shaikh of Ummul Qaiwain undertook that Shaikh Khalid bin/Ms brother utouLC Abdullah bin Ahmad^Tnot tet commit any intrigue at Shargah.1^3 Both these two persons have sbnj# not done anything to the contrary until now. The departure of the Shaikh of Shargah for Umm-ul- ^aiwain in this way is not for offering condolences, it is rather for expressing his rejoicing 'because the present Shaikh ©f Umm-ul-Qaiwain is not a nephew of the I^uler of Shargah nor Umm ul Qaiwain is under his sway. Sultan 'bin Saqar is from the Qawasim tri'be while the Shaikh of Umra-ul- Qaiwain has come from the Al-Ali tri'be neither there is any relation 'between them 'by marriage or lineage. T T.M.S. M Lupin M arrived at Shargah on the 18th February. I at once went on 'board and met the Commander w^© enquired from me ahout the event ®f TTmra-ul-Qaiwain, I informed him of the case. I then accompanied him to Umm-ul-Qaiwain where the present Shaikh came on 'board. The Commander enquired from him ahout the murder ©f Shaikh Hamad 'bin Ihrahim and he replied H his servant killed hira rt . The Commander asked what was the reason hut they did not give a useful reply. , * ■ s / ■ I enqLuired from Shaikh Ahmad 'bin Kasriid whether the Shaikh of Shargah was at Umnuul-Qaiwain and was informed that he was there. Then I enquired for what purpose he had gone there and was told that he had gone there for the purpose of offering his condolences. The Commander enquired if Umm-ul-^aiwain is under the Government of Shargah and was t^ld •'No'. He again asked -I* the Ruler of Shargah your cousin'. 'No' 7/as the answer. ''That is the relation 'between you .and the Ruler of Shargah'• 'Frienship' said Shaikh Ahmad bin TtacsTlTd. At this Juncture I interferred and said he was not formerly a Shaikh so that there should 'be friendship 'between them. Thereupon th* Commander warned the said Shaikh (Shaikh Ahmad hin not to transgress upon the children of the murdered Shaikh nor on Shaikh Khalid hin Ahmad who now resides in Umm-ul- Qaiwain in accordance with his treaty with the S.N.O., concluded with the Shaikh of 3hargah / and ordered all to- V /MH 9 refer to Your Henour. In fact the going the Shaikh of Ghargah to Qaivrain is suspected eren 'by his neighbouring Shaikh^and it is a matter which might give cause for disputes 'between him and Shaikh Khalid 'bin Ahrnal the exiled Shaikh. ^haterer that might take place later on shall he reported to you in due time* 4f 3.$.
