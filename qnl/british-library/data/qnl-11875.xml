ROUTE No. I. DUZDAP to NASH AT AB AD (SI8TAN). 132 miles. 9 stages. Authority. —E. P. Cordon, 1918. Quetta Bureau, 1927. Epitome .-—The road is fit for motor traffic throughout the year, except during heavy rains. There is a masonry bridge (fit for all aims) over the Nurab at the Burj-i-Karami. There are several other bridges between Lutak and Nasratabad which frequently fall in. Diversion .—The direct motor road between Duzdap andi Meshed takes off at Hurmukh. For details see Note at end of this route. Water .—250 camels could travel daily along this route. Brick wells are made at Rig Chah, Nawar Chah, Tasuki, Chah Muhammad Reza and Girdi. 1 squadron cavalry or 1 com pany infantry could march along this route. Fuel. —Scarce, obtainable from the thorn bushes. Fodder .—Fair grazing along whole route. Tasuki and Rig Chah villages the best.3 Route No. I— contd. iato the Duzdap plain. There is a considerable amount of tamarisk m the vicinity of the Ziarat along the nala which, wTf th !u n °S her x and westej,n P arts of the plain, passes just below the Ziarat on the K, cuts through the projecting ri ge referred to and rejoins the main Lar stream at 18 ^ 8 ATT? 7 g °! Clear but sli g htI y ^line water in the nala 100 yards NW. of the Ziarat, yielding 4,000 gallons of water per hour. At 3£ miles the road leaves the actual plain ascending gradually up a daman and crossing a low shoulder of the ridge on the E. at 5 miles. Continuing in the same direction, it descends 200 feet into the valley of the Shara . main dr y channel at 7 miles. Camel grazing is plentiful in this valley (as also in the next) and a few tamarisk bushes suitable for fuel are also to be found. Turning almost due N. the road ascends a side valley to a low pass. At the 8 th mile a little to the side of the road is a well yielding a good supply of water. The water is 16 feet below ground level and is 9 feet deep. The pass is reached at 10 miles. Descending gradually into the next valley the main channel is passed at lo miles. The hills now become more irregular and broken. After an ascent of 600 feet in 3| miles the Shamadar Pass is* reached at I 62 miles. Water holes containing slightly saline water were found in the small nala running down to the pass from the left. From the Shamadar Pass the road, which has hitherto been crossing water courses, now runs along the main Shamadar nala for 6 miles generally keeping in the bed of the stream. Going would be difficult after heavy rain in some places and dangerous between miles 19 and 20 where the hills, which are of a very decided shale formation, close in on the' road, and the valley is only a few yards wide. At mile 18 the track to Pipli leaves the valley to the left. Kaindak Spring is reached at 20 miles. The water here is neither good nor plenti- ftd* This place has hitherto been considered the stage and has been used as a halting place for convoys. Space for camping very limited. Picquetting would be difficult and fuel and grazing very scarce. There is a better site a mile lower down the valley where it opens out to a width of 100 yards. Camping ground .—Sufficient for a regiment. Fuel .—Very scarce.4 Route No. I— contd. Grazing. —Fairly plentiful. Water. —Good water from a spring accessible to camels about £ mile up a tributary stream which runs into the Shamadar v nala from the left at 21 miles. 2 HURMUK .. 17 m. WNW. up the Shama- dar nala bed for 7J 37 miles. Road good and hard track then enters the Vavaila nala round western and northern bases of Kuh-i-Malik Siah. At 11J miles Ziarat Kuh-i- Malik Siah is reached. Banks of nala are 15 feet to 20 feet high and ground on left is open and undulating. On right Kuh-i-Malik Siah rises abruptly. Water at Kuh-i-Malik Siah is bad and not plentiful. A bungalow, a Persian Customs House and a Post and Telegraph office are situated here. Camping ground in nala or on plateau on which bungalow is situated. Supplies for a few individuals only. Road leaves nala at 12J miles and turns W.; slight ascent and descent Hurmuk is reached at 17 miles. Going on this stage is good and fit for light motor vans but as it is built on a silt foundation is too soft for heavy lorries. Camping ground. —For a brigade. Water. —Plentiful and very good, sufficient for 2,000 camels. Huts built by E. P. L. of C. afford shelter for travellers. Fuel. —Firewood abundant from thorny bushes.

NASRATABAD (SISTAN) to MESHED, via DURUH, KARAT and TURBAT-I-SHAIKH JAM. 489 % miles . 29 stages . Authorities—$myt\ 1902; Douglas, 1903; Dobbs,, 1903 ; Wanless, 1903 ; Gibbon, 1907. (stages 1 to 12); O’Connor, 1911, (stages 1 to 12); Fowle, 1912, (stages 1 to 12); Wilson, 1912, (stages 13 to 29) ; E. P. Cordon, 1918, (stages 8, 9 and 10) ; M. A. Meshed, 1927. Epitome. —Suitable for camel transport and for Field Artilley with some detours. Motor cars are now running on this route- between Karez (stage 21) and Meshed. For a cart road im provements are required in stages 10, 11, 14, 15 and 19. In stage 2 , seven miles are across part of a hamun, impassable in wet weather. In stage 4, the track crosses the Bandan pass, then follows the Bandan river for 2 stages ; thence for 3 stages over an open plain. In stage 10, Gudar Masham pass and another easy Icutal are crossed. In stage 11, is a steep stony Icidal avoidable it is said, by a detour. In stage 14, is the Amrutak pass (6,690') ; in stage 15, a stretch of 4 miles of heavy sand, and in stage 19, low Icutal. Water —very scarce for the first 10 stages, in stages 8 and 9 there is a stretch of 24 miles with only one well. At stages 11 to 15 the supply is good, but between 16 and 17 there is a stretch of 34J miles, waterless save for a small well at Chapkai. This might be avoided by a detour via Findukt-Ruknabad-Mijnabad, a distance of 44J miles. The remaining stages have plenty of water. Fuel.—Nil in stage 1, fair in stage 3, otherwise apparently plentiful. Fodder —Camel grazing is plentiful up to stage 21 . Little grass S. of Sangun, stage 18, but N. of that place much lucerne is grown. Supplies. —Obtainable in small quantities at stages 4 and’ 8 . and for a considerable force at stages 11 and 12 , also at Tabas;11 a Koute No. II — contd. and other villages of Sunnikhaneh district. The Khaf valley oould support a division for a week. Small supplies at stages 15 and 17, elsewhere up to stage 22 , practically nothing can be relied on. Stages 23 to 29, ample supplies. General—The end of March and April is the best time for obtaining water and fodder but crops are not harvested till the end of June and July, so the stock of grain and dry fodder is then at its lowest. The movement of anything but a small force along this road would be difficult. Between stages 1 to 6 and 7 to 11 , unless advanced depots were arranged, gram and fodder would have to be carried. Water, too, in many places would be a difficulty. Alternative stages, (a) Nasratabad to Duruh via AspaiaH. ( 6 ) Baring to Asparan. Via Chah Mago. (c) Chah-i-Ziran to Chah-i-Banah.

The track leaves NaS' ratabad in a W.S.W. direction and for 15 were about o* mnes oi —• — &lt;=&gt; the Hamun is generally dry, and its bed ofiers good going12 Route No. ll—contd. troops and transport. But through the winter of 1911-12, and up to November 1912, when the Hamun should have been dry, there was still enough water to prevent camels crossing,, except unladen, and then only with difficulty. During the summer months the Hamun is sometimes as much as 12 miles broad, with an average depth of 4 or 5 feet. It is then crossed by means of tutins. The tutin is a reed raft con structed by the Sayads, who are a nomad tribe, who make a living by catching fish and water-fowl on the lake. The tutin can be made to any size, and the material from which they are constructed is unlimited, as the reeds cover the greater part of the lake. The largest kind of tutin in common use is about 18 feet long by 8 feet broad, and on this cattle and donkeys (tied firmly down) are ferried across. Such a tutin would hold about 10 soldiers with rifles, besides the 2 Sayads needed to pole or paddle it, and would take 3 men {i.e., Sayads accustomed to the work) about 2 days to build. A tutin only lasts about 2 months, when it becomes water-logged and useless. Ordinarily there are some hundred tutins afloat on the lake. The length of this stage would vary according as to whether the Hamun were in flood or not. Camping ground .—On W. bank of Hamun. Water .—Plentiful and good from Hamun. Hud.—-Scanty. Fodder .—Good grazing. Supplies. — Nil. 2 BARING or 10 m. General direction NW- _ LAB-I-BARING. A circular hill, called 25 the Kuh-i-Khwaja, standing up about 400 feet above the level of the naizdr, is passed lying about 2-|- miles to the S. of the track. Guns could be got on to it, and it is an excellent position, completely commanding the low-lying country.. No village at Baring, which is merely a caravansarai and a customs-house. It stands well above flood level. The telegraph line follows the road. Camping ground.—In dry season, down near the reeds ; when the swamp is full on high ground beyond.- Water .—Good and plentiful from Harndn.13 Route No. II — contd. Fud. —Plentiful. Fodder. —None in actual vicinity but there is good grazing on the.dasht 3 miles southwards. Supplies. — Nil. 3 HAUZ-I-NADIRl 16 m. General direction NW. The track leaves the 41 naizdr and ascends to a gravel plain ; excellent going for both camels and wheels. The hauz, protected by a wall and dome, contained an abundant supply of good water (April), but dries up after a prolonged drought. This hauz contains about 12,000 gallons of water when full it is generally empty from mid-August to mid-December, and is at its fullest in April and May. Drawing water frcm the hauz is a difficult process. Fuel. —Enough for a large caravan from bushes. Fodder. —Grazing enough for a large caravan, from bushes. Supplies. — Nil. 4 ZAINULABAD 17fm. General direction NW- (2,450'). The track continues 58J across the dasht, as above, as far as Bandan, crossing the Bandan river which has a slight flow of slightly saline water at the 5th, 9th and 12th miles. At 16 miles the village and date groves of Bandan are reached at the mouth of the Bandan Pass, which is here about- 400 yards wide. There is a route from this village to Lash. Bandan village is shut in at the end of the valley by steep razor backed hills, which are within rifle-shot of the town. Would form a good position for a force to take up to oppose hostile advance either from N. or S. as the case might be, as 2 or 3 routes connect here. Guns on the heights round Bandan could command the country for miles round in either direction. Water. —Abundant supply from Bandan stream, which never runs dry ; it is slightly brackish but quite drinkable. Also from a spring in palm grove. Grazing in immediate vicinity of village scanty. Fud. —Scarce.\ii 14 Route No. II — contd. Supplies .—Enough for caravans of 200 camels. The track now follows the left bank of the Bandan river up the pass to Zainulabad at 17f miles. Just before reaching Zainulabad a track branches off to the left to I\eh, through a gap in the hills. Camping ground .—For a brigade. JFaier.—Plentiful, slightly brackish, water-supply from the stream. Fuel. —Scarce. Fodder. —Camel-grazing good. Supplies. —Scanty. The grain grown in the southern half of the Kainat is not sufficient for the needs of the people. Con siderable supplies available from neighbouring villages o Bandan and Tabasin. GISH A (or Gisheh). . 19 m. General direction NNW. The track hhs continues up the Bandan valley which gradually opens out. Good going for both camels and wheels. At 1£ miles the village of Tabasin, situated within a small fort, is passed on the right. Here there is a karez of good water. At 4 miles a track branches off up a valley to the left to Birjand via Anjireh. At 5 Z miles a track branches off to Aliabad. The track continues to foUow the course of the Bandan river over gravel plain, until at 16 miles the valley opens out into the Gisha plain, and water is found in the bed of the river. No habitations. _pientiful supply of water (slighty saline). Fuel. —Abundant. Fodder. —Camel-grazing abundant. Supplies.—N il. ;6 91 KHWAJA-I-DtJ CHAHAN (ok Chahi). 13J m. General direction N. Good going through out. The track con tinues to follow the course of the Bandan river, crossing and re-crossing it several times. The valley gradually contracts_ to about half a mile in width and opens out just befo re Nhwaja Du Chahan is reached, to about a mile in width. There are no habitations.15 Route No. II— contd. Water .—Excellent water from two wells, which the natives say are inexhaustible. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Camel-grazing excellent. Supplies. — Nil. 7 CHAH-I-ZIRAN 8 m. General direction over plain in NW. direction still ascending, and then descends slightly into Duruh plain which stretches some 20 miles to the N. Chah-i-Ziran is situated at the foot of a low spur running out into the plain. No habitations. Water .—Spring with abundance of good water. Zarudni in October 1898 estimated that 250 gallons could be drawn from it at once ; in May it was much fuller. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Camel-grazing plentiful. Supplies .—Very few supplies. 8 DURUH .. 22 m. General direction N. ning NNW. to Chah Baneh and Hasanabad, but the track to Duruh is indistinguishable for the first 10 or 12 miles after leaving Chah-i-Ziran. A guide should be employed, other wise follow a compass bearing due N. over a level sandy plain thickly covered with tamarisk bushes. At about 14 miles, some patches of cultivation. At 18 miles small hamlet of Parong; water plentiful from a Icarez. Thence 4 miles by an easy upward slope to Duruh. The plain is sandy and covered with white tamarisk (tagroz). Village contains 350 houses and 8 shops, and is surrounded with walled gardens and a fair amount of cultivation. Popula tion 800—1,000. The village possesses 150 donkeys, 150 cows and 10,000 sheep. Overlooking the village is a fortified ridge up which a covered way formerly led from the outskirts of the village. The roofs of the houses are continuous and cover a network of tunnel-like passages, by which access to the ridge was possible without exposure. 99 (or Zira). NNW. Road con tinues for 4 miles 121 (3,900'). There is a well- defined track run-16 Route No. II — contd . Camping ground. —For a brigade.

Road over plain, direc- — tion WNW. with 143 hills on right hand (N) going good for first two miles then very stony. At 6 miles hills to right recede to NW. and road progresses across plain which is good going. At 9 miles approaching hills W. and S. again very stony. At 11 miles Durhh in sight, back view, enter ravine, direction now NW. Chah Baneh a few hundred yards up ravine to right &lt;(N) of road. Water, sweet and good from a well, 8 feet to surface of water, feet diameter, depth of water 4 feet. Can be emptied in a couple of hours by one man and takes as long to refill. Said to be perennial. At 14 miles river bed contains •salty but drinkable water at a depth of a yard from the surface. Three or four holes dug at this spot which is called Shand-i- Sard-Gudar, short ascent to Gudar named Meshan on map but unnamed according to local people. Easy descent through iow hills but very stony going. At 16th mile reach fork-roads —left fork going WNW. to Sarbisheh. Take right fork NW. At 17 miles direction changes to N. 18 miles short rise then level going with low hills on either side to Husainabad at 22 miles. Ruined Kila. The Kila is occupied by one family. A -ruined disused 'kila lies 2 miles to E. at opening of karez. A spring of sweet water, Dehnan, lies a mile to W. of road 2 miles back from Husainabad. (Dehnan on map is non-existent.) Water. —Water plentiful en route, and at Hasanabad from .springs and kdrezes, but brackish. Water runs 50—100 gallons a minute into a large pool. Fuel. —Scanty. Fodder. —Camel-grazing good.

General direction N. JAZIK Road northwards 182 (4,800 / ). across the plain, through very fertile country with a lot of cultivation for first 10 miles ; passes the two villages of Faizabad and Allabad. At 8 miles reaches Tabas, a large village, the centre of the Sunnl- khaneh district. Three hundred houses with 40 wind mills and 9 or 10 shops. Fort has a garrison of 1 Sultan and 15 sar- hazes. Water from 5 kdrezes. Annual produce of grain about 3,000 kharwdrs of wheat and barely and 1,000 kharwdrs of bhusa. The population of the district is 3,000 and possesses 400 cows, 500 donkeys, 100 camels and 20,000 sheep. Cultivation ceases at Tabas, and at 13 miles main road branching off to right, crosses a low ridge and descends into valley running eastwards in which is the village of Avaz 18 miles. Here there is a gap in hills to east, down which runs the main road from Blrjand to Herat. (Through the gap also runs a road in a northerly direction to Ahangaran, by taking which, troops could avoid the difficult pass of AmrOtak. This road avoids the hills passing along to the east of them, but although an easy road, is not much used, partly because it is longer, and partly because owing to its proximity to the Afghan frontier, it is less safe.) At 18 miles road begins to ascend again, on the18 Route No. II— contd. far side of the valley up the bed of a saltish stream, and continues up it for 20 miles, where the outskirts of the village are reached. Gazik is a small town of 1,000 houses surrounded by high walled gardens and has more than a square mile of wheat fields. It lies in a hollow surrounded by hills on every side except the SSE. Road to Gazik is a good level gravelly one. Water. —Supply good and plentiful, sufficient for 800 camels. Fuel. —'A good supply. Fodder. —'Camel-grazing good and plentiful. Supplies. —Should be available. 13 GUL-MIRAN .. 18J m. General direction (6,100'). slightly W. of N. 2Q0| The track runs N. and ascends the steep skirts of the long mountain opposite Gazik, rising and dropping continually across ravines, which make it very trying for camels. Still ascending, at about the 12 th mile, near the northern end of the valley, a tank of fresh water fed by a spring is reached, and also the small village of Mark. The track now ascends steeply to Gulmiran, a small hamlet. Road stony in parts, otherwise good. Water. —Good from a kdrez. Fodder. —Fair camel-grazing. Supplies. — Nil. 14 AHANGARAN 21 m. Ascend 500 feet in a (3,743'). NE. direction to 221 J crest of Amrutak pass (6,690'). It would be difficult for troops, and much work would be necessary before wheeled transport could be got over it. It can, however, be turned by a longer but easy road to the east via Tajnud. This latter road runs along the foot of the hills, but is little used, although it is said to have ample water, owing to its proximity to the Afghan border, which makes it liable to raids. It leaves the main road at Avaz coming in again near Ahangaran. The main road descends gradually from the kutal into a ravine, and the going here is good but stony. At 101 miles, there is water in the bed of a stream, and some cultivation, but below this for a mile the valley is very narrow, and the road rough and stony. At 11J miles, the19 Route No. II — contd. valley again opens out, but at 15 miles, narrows between preci pitous cliffs. It is a very striking gorge and is called the Dehaneh- i-Ahangaran ; it is about 1 J miles long. The road here is down the bed of the stream, stony and rocky in places, and though good enough for mules or camels, would require a lot of work before guns or wheeled transport could be got over it. At IbJ miles, at the mouth of the gorge, is the ruined Kila-i-Dukhtar, on a high steep rock commanding the entrance to the defile. Camping-ground 1 | miles lower down, where the valley opens out into the plain. Fuel, water and camel-grazing is abundant, but no supplies. The small village of Ahangaran lies about 2 J miles to the NE. in the plain. In descending from the Amrutak Pass, Gumi, a village of 60 houses, with a kdrez of delicious water, ample supplies and some fine trees, is passed in ravine to the W. 15 *BAMRUD .. 18J m. General direction N. — (2,900'). A low range of hills _ 240 in a semi-circle shuts Ahangaran, and Muhammadabad to the W. into a cup at the mouth of the Ahangaran Pass, and there is only one outlet from the cup—to the NW. of Muhammadabad about 7 miles from Ahangaran. The track descends fairly steeply, passing through low shrubs to Muhammadabad, and then passes through sand dunes covered with tdgaz near the outlet of the cup already described. After emerging from this cup or basin there is a gradual slope, very sandy and free from stones, and the track runs in a NW. direction towards a short isolated range, beneath which lies Bamrud. For 4 miles the sand makes going very heavy. Bamrud contains about 150 houses. The caravan route branches off to the W. at 12 miles, avoiding Bamrud, and makes a patch of cultivation, 4£ miles W. of Bamrud, called Pa-i-Jui, the halting place. Water brackish ; abundant camel-grazing; no supplies. The caravan route joins the route given below again at 6 miles from Pa-i-Jul. W at er.—Brackish. Fodder .—Ample camel-grazing.

The track 257 runs SW. for a short distance over terraced fields, and then turns up the valley which runs NW. from Bamrud, keeping close under the northern hills ; it is good going and free from stones. The Bamrud hills continue on the right for about 7 miles, and then gradually sink down, to be succeeded by some low hills at about the 12 th mile. At 17 miles, Chakpai is reached. The well is not more than 3 feet in diameter and the water is 70 feet below the surface r it is said to fill up quickly, but, in any case, the difficulty of drawing water from it would prevent any but a very small party being watered here. A force using this route would have to bring water with it. There is absolutely no water in dry weather on the main road between Bamrud and Mijnabad, 34£ miles, except at the Chakpai well. A better route could be found by marching to Findukht, 20£ miles, thence 24 miles to Mijnabad passing the village of Ruknabad at 22£ miles. Total for tho 2 stages, 44| miles.

The ground on either side of the track is very broken and difficult. The ascent is gradual to the summit of_the pass, Buri-i-Gulugah, mile 15, about 1,500 feet above Sangun, where the kutal is not very marked. The descent is also easy and gradual ; for a mile down a rather narrow ravine, and then down a grassy valley. At 17 miles Burj-i-Kara a watch tower on a mound to the right (south). At mile 20 reach Sar-i-Chas meh-i-Karat, where there is a perennial stream of good running water (1,000 gallons per hour). In summer this stream may dry up nearer Karat, and this spot would form a good alternative halting place. Wood and grass abundant : supplies m The remainder of the road is through hills and rather stony ; it runs down a ravine into Karat. Karat is a small village situated where the valley opens out into the plain, and is conspicuous by reason of a ruined mmare ;about 140 feet high.

This valley affords splendid grazing ground even in July, and for this reason it is clearly the line that should be taken by the cavalry of a force proceeding to the E„ if other considerations permitted. The defile of Kila Minar is certainly impracticable for artillery as it stands, but it could easily be made practi- cable in a'few hours, as the soil of the hill is soft. The summit of the pass is called the Gardan-l-Klla M.nar. It abounds in strong positions, and the road is completely com manded bv a very steep, rugged and impracticable ridge which runs along the left the whole way.

Track gradually ascends. At 4 miles the Ziarat of Said Ali is passed on right and track crosses another small water channel fed from a reservoir of brackish water which is reached at 6 miles. Ascent continues to a pass at 8 miles. Here going somewhat bad owing to extensive excavations by which karez water is brought from far side of pass and collected in a small reservoir on this side —this water is good. Existing track is easy for troops and animals but would require broadening and improving for motors. From pass, track descends into valley, good going.

The road leaves 25 Birjand over a plain and about threeRoute No. Ill— contd. merges into a very narrow and rocky tangi and continues along this for about a mile when it merges into the open hills again. Soon after this, it passes a very small village called Darvish Hussain and again a little further on another village with plenty of water. The road then goes over some rounded hills and at about the eleventh mile commences to go downhill. Up to this point the road has a steep upward incline the whole way. The road now takes a downward trend for some miles. A little way beyond a pool of water is passed on the left fed by the brackish stream. After again going over some more rounded hills the road passes the three small villages of Kargaz, Ballasangi and Baghun. All very close toge ther. Prom here the road takes some very steep, up and down gradients all the time, gradually climbing up. After a little while another small village with a karez is passed and a little further on it takes a steep descent into the village of Aghaldar where there is a small karez. The road here becomes more level and enters a wide valley passing another small village called Rhunik possessing a karez and also a little further on a patch of cultivation with another karez. The road continues along the valley to the village of Nuqab where there is plenty of water and culti\ ation. Piom here to Afzalabad the road passes through cultivation and orchards. Afzalabad is a fairly large and prosperous village. The only good defensive position on this road is the nanov tangi as here the hills are very high and it is the only apparent road through them ; a small number of men posted at one end could hold a great many times their own number. The road is more suitable for mule transport than any thing else, but is just passable though difficult for camels, but in any case it is very hard for the animals as the road is con tinually going up and down some extremely steep slopes. There is no camel grazing on the way and the cultivation round the villages is in proportion to their size and appeals to be only enough to feed the inhabitants. The only iiiel to be had is from trees growing in the villages. Goats and sheep are very scarce. Water is plentiful. The gradients are too steep to allow a satisfactory motor road to be made and at many places some very heavy banking and rock work is necessary, especially in the narrow tangi78 Route No. Ill— contd. which would require a gret deal of blasting and extremely heavy work. 2 A FRIZ .. 30 m. Leaving Afzalabad, the , road continues along ~~ the valley and after about 3 miles, again picks up the small brackish stream. At the end of the valley the road crosses a saline river bed with a small stream of drinkable water, thence it goes up on to a small plateau and passes small village where there is a little cultivation ; continuing along this plateau it again crosses the river bed, turns to the right, and goes over some low rounded hills and down into the village of Kundur, where, there is plenty of good water and a good deal of cultivation. From here the road goes through some clay hillocks to the en trance of a large plain where it passes a small stream running into a fairly large karez ; just beyond this village of the Shur where the water is brackish. The road leaves Shur on the left and o-oes along a level plain passing two hauzes both contain ing excellent water. Just after the second hauz it takes a sharp upward slope and goes out on to a large wide plain where it passes one small stream and seven hauzes all con taining water and according to statements of the local in habitants these hauzes are nearly always full. At the end of the plain the road goes up rather a steep incline o^er some rounded hills, and down again into the fairly large village of Afriz, where there is excellent water and a good deal of culti vation. On this road the only position of any military importance are the rounded hills at the end of the plain just before Afriz is reached. From the top of these hills an excellent view can be obtained of the road across the plain and it also looks down into Afriz. The road is very level the whole way and only a few places would present any difficulties to motors. It is an excellent road for mule and camel transport. The only camel grazing to be got on this stage is on the large plain but it is rather scanty. Bhusa in small quantities (30 lbs.—60 lbs.) can be pro cured at Afriz. Local inhabitants say that the small brackish stream, which is quite drinkable, is running all the year roundRoute No. Ill— contd. and other water is plentiful and should be enough for any number of men and animals. Too much faith must not be placed on the information that 14 hauzes on this stage always contain water as the only visible means of these hauzes getting water appears to be rain. Herds are scarce and there is very little wood in the villages. 3 MUHAMMADA- 15 m. The road leaves Afriz BAD. across a fairly wide 70 plain passing three hauzes en route. It then goes through a range of hills passing the small village of Charchashmeh and goes again into a broad plain, a great part of which is saline, to the village of Muhammadabad where there is a large karez of rather brackish water. In crossing this saline track care should be taken to keep to the camel tracks as in places the shorn is very deep and water is only a few feet from the surface and nowhere does the shora seem firm enough to take anything heavy- This saline track is a great obstacle in the way of motors and any other heavy traffic. The range of hills between Afriz and Muhammadabad form a good observation point as from the top, an excellent view of the road across plain to Afriz is obtained and on a hill a little further back a good view of the road across the plain to Muhammadabad can be got. Camel grazing can be got on the plain out of Afriz but a large number of camels, say two or three hundred, would have to wander rather far afield. There is no firewood at all on this stage except scrub and herds are again scarce. ALTERNATIVE ROUTES III (H). KAIN (Stage 18) to RUI KHAF (Stage 23) via ZUZAN. 87 miles. 4 stages.

It then descends for half a mile and crosses a slightly saline stream by an easy crossing. After an easy ascent for 1 ^ mile the top of the kotal is reached. From the top of the kotal, the road descends by a cutting into the adjoining hill for a distance of half a mile until it reaches the river bed which contains a few huts.

The village of Asadabad populated by Arab cultivators is reached at mile 16. The village produces wheat, barley, melons, bhusa, etc., but the water is not too good or plentiful. From Asadabad to Khidri the road passes over a hard level plain of pat, which provides good going during the summer months, but is impassable after rain. At mile 22 the village of Salaiani, containing 50 houses, is reached. Water abundant from a good karez, and sup plies of wheat, barley and bhusa are obtainable, good camel grazing from May to August. From Salaiani to Khidri a distance of 12 miles, the going is over a hard surface cut by three water courses, which would require a little repair for wheeled traffic. Khidri is a large village populated by Arabs, who culti vate a considerable amount of wheat and barley and possess good fruit gardens. (Also see footnote.) W ater. —Abundant.

For the next 11 J miles the road ascends and descends kutals byRoute No. Ill— contd. gradients varying from to Two kutals 6,800 and 6,600 feet respectively are crossed at the 8| and 11-| miles. The road at the 13th mile passes a small hamlet containing a few huts, trees and a flour mill with a plentiful supply of good running water. At the 15th mile the road descends from a high kutal by a very steep descent into the Kakh river bed where it takes an abrupt turn to the N. and reaches Kakh at the 16th mile. Throughout the road is unfit for wheeled traffic although the surface is hard, the gradients are too steep for loaded camels and it would necessitate considerable expense and labour to make the road passable even for the lightest of vehicles. The hills are in many places covered with grass, affording excellent pasture for sheep and goats, and there is good camel grazing on many of the slopes. Kakh, which is situated at the entrance of a broad ravine subject to heavy floods is a picturesque little town ; said to contain 1,500 houses and 10,000 inhabitants. Wheat and barley are produced on terraced plots but in quan tities hardly sufficient for local requirements. There are many gardens of mulberry and various kinds of fruit. The main street of the town has a few blacksmith shops and a tinsmith but they are not capable of any really heavy repair work. 4 JUMIN . • 14 m. The road from Kakh to Jumin crosses a 64 hard gravel plain until it reaches the village of Jumin at the 14th mile. Jumin is the most westerly village of the group of 80 closely nestling together to form the city, or as it might also be called, district of Gunabad.* The area occupied by the various villages of this city com prises about 9 square miles of fruit gardens and wheat, barley and poppy fields. • There appears to be an unlimited supply of water and no fallow land in the entire area. Considerable supplies of wheat, barley and bhusa are pro curable.

Authority. —E. P. Cordon— 1918. Epitome.—Stage 3 may be broken at Chah Gazi (3 saltish wells in the desert at 19J miles) and stage 5 at the village of Sadrabad at 9|- miles. Route runs parallel to, and at an average distance of 4 miles W. of the main Amrani-Maina-Turbat carriage route, with which it is coincident for the first 4-| and last 5 miles. Stage 3 is a faintly marked camel track over flat desert. Stage 4 is a good hard undulating carriage road along W. side of Sikanderabad-Faizabad plain to crest of watershed dividing that from the Sadrabad plain. Stage 5 is in this plain and rises gradually the last 5 miles to Turbat.96 Route No. Ill — contd . Route throughout has good surface being passable without difficulty for all arms, and for motors with difficulty at 3 points only, viz., sand and a river-bed crossing in stage 3 and a defile in stage 4. As a through route to Turbat from Jumin, Kain, etc., the route is little used owing to the desert state of stage o which is really only used by inhabitants of Amrani and Faizabad. Stages 4 and 5 however have heavy local and through traffic (Turbat-Bijistan road). As an alternative line of advance for a force it compares somewhat unfavourably with the eastern carriage route chiefly owing to stage 3. In stages 4 and 5 there is little to choose between the two routes—the bigger supphes with grazing at Faizabad and Abdulabad but poor camping ground and absence of supphes or grazing at Zirabad having to be balanced with the lesser supphes of Mehneh, small supphes of Junnuk, and the good grazing and fair camping grounds of both villages. fort at 1J miles and ascend at 4 miles gently on to a plateau for 2 miles good going thence over a steep kotal “ Dehaneh Sulaiman ” with steep ascent on N. side and down into a nala for 1 £ miles ; leaving nala, road ascends over low hills into an undulating plain, going hard and good.

Track clearly marked over the pat, unmarked over the sand. Very difficult to follow at night even for local guides, difficult for motors and heavy going for guns at all times. At 5 miles a track leads 1,000 feet E. to Hauz-i-Gulu Reg. Two hauzes with sweet but muddy water. This sandhill country continues to 6 § miles where route enters flat pat plain with scanty shrub in patches and is onwards better marked —sometimes with a double camel track. At 8 miles the bed of the Kal-i-Shur is crossed. Banks 15 feet high, 100 feet apart and though almost vertical at most points eould be quickly ramped down. Crossing at present used is firm and roughly passable for all vehicles though in no way a made crossing. In bed is a string of saltwater pools connected by a gently flowing stream. Bed is apparently fordable anywhere but quicksands are said to be numerous. From N. or right bank track continues N., less clearly marked and scanty vegetation appears. Route rises gently over the lower slopes of the Robat Kamahi spur and is perfectly open. From 10 to 11 miles camel grazing is abundant and good. At 16 miles surface becomes hard “ dasht.” At 17 miles and £ mile to E. is Hauz-i-Haji Garbu (single somewhat pointed dome) full of fair water. Being off the road, this hauz, normally, has water perennially. From the tup of its dome only, the tower of Robat Kamahi is visible, 4J miles to E. at bearing 112. Communication by helio, and lamp practicable and by flags morning and evening. At 17£ miles track starts to descend N. side of spur at bearing 5.

Onwards route descends IS. towards gap in red hills and is more clearly marked with good and hard surface throughout. At 21 miles track rises gently over a spur of the hills to E. from which Faizabad can be seen and descends to Hauz-i-Haji Ibrahim, at 23 miles—good water melons are cultivated here in season.Route No. Ill— contd. Route continues at bearing 351 to Hauz-i-Do Burji at 24f miles ; needs digging out. Hauz is at important cross roads. NE. at 358 Mehneh is visible to which a good track runs ( 1 st mile a mere track, then better marked to Hauzi-Haidar ; at 3J miles with 4J feet good water, then an excellent road through cultivation to Maina at 7f miles). This route continues SW. from Hauz-i-Do Burji to Miandeh, direction 240—distance about 8 miles. Hauz is single dome type and once formed part of a fort of which only 2 fragments remain (the Burji). Close by is a modern building at edge of a band enclosing a large melon field. Here there is a well yielding almost negligible amount of water. Bearing of Faizabad 358.. Onwards the track, which is augmented by donkey tracks, skirts melon fields but is rough for cars at 1 point only. 2 to 3 miles W. of Hauz-i-Do Burji is a hauz of water and at 28J miles J mile to W. a hauz in the form of a large open reservoir is passed.. The ruined fort of Old Faizabad lies f mile to W. at 30J miles. Faizabad is entered through gardens at 3If miles and streets through town are passable for motors. Road to Turbat turns off to NE. before town proper is entered. Faizabad is a prosperous town with plentiful trees and gardens, and good camel grazing. Water. —Good and inexhaustible from 2 large Jcarezes (flowing from direction of Abdulabad) and some 15 especially large and deep rain water hauzes in the town. Supplies —of grain, fodder and atta obtainable in large quantities. Wood is obtained from Daughabad.

From here the track to Abdulabad branches off along the Western karez. At 4 miles route crosses carriage road leading from Abdulabad, 1 mile NW. to Hassanabad 2 miles to SE. Thence a gentle ascent to Daughabad at 5£ miles, the road passes through the E. edge of a graveyard. Faizabad-Daughabad section of road is passable and good for motors though rough across several dry torrent beds and stony near Daughabad. Onwards road ascends for 1 J miles and then descends gently to the hamlet of Shahrak IJ miles to SE. At 7-| miles is a hauz. There are here 2 nala crossings difficult for cars, and onwards the road surface is of soft fine gravel. At miles pass the hamlet of Salam Dasht to SE.— through which a route goes to Sikanderabad. Road onwards is good with a gentle ascent to Anarak, a hamlet at 10 miles. Here the crossings of an irrigation stream and a dry river-bed are somewhat difficult for vehicles. Road then rises up to a pass (at 11 miles) among hills of hard rock covered with a layer of soft red earth. Passage is difficult for vehicles but can be easily improved except in 2 places for which explosives would be needed (Persian carriages constantly cover the stage over this pass). Road then descends to Zirabad at 15 miles—going open but rough. Zirabad, as often called Robat-i-Bibi is a hamlet (10 families living inside the Fort) among the jumble of red hills which stretch from Anarak to Sikanderabad and Junnuk and which forms the water-shed between the Faizabad valley and the Aliabad valley. Besides the fort there is a caravanserai and a large fruit garden. Supplies. — Nil, except fruit.

BIRJAND to KERMAN, via GARMAB and HAUR (Across the Lu t) 273 miles. 10 stages. Authority. —Gibbon, 1908- Epitome .—This route is very extensively used in the_winter months by caravans proceeding from Khorasan to Kerman. In the summer months it is impossible owing to the intense heat and the hot winds, which are said to be fatal to man and beast: in the winter months the possibility of being caught in the open desert in a bhzzard must be faced One hundred and twenty-five miles of the route runs through an absolutely waterless stony desert, on which there is not a vestige of vegetation. The route throughout is fit for camel transport. The possibility of its use for other than a small detachment, mounted on camels, may be said to be practically nil. Throughout the passage of the desert the road runs across an absolutely bare but gently rolling plain, the surface of which is hard and covered with a layer of black shingle. The track is well marked in daylight. At night, however, the greatest care must be taken that no man strays even the shortest distance away ; should he do so, he will probably never find the track again, as there are no landmarks to guide him. At about108 Route No. IV— contd. 80 miles, there is a zone, about six miles in width, of kavir, i.e., ® soft salty clay surface. After rain this would become almost,, if not quite, impassable for camels for the time being. On leaving the level desert at 118 miles there is a long and somewhat steep descent into the valley of the Ilud-i-Shur. Thence the track lies up a narrow nala with high precipitous sides, over a low pass, and then down on the other side on to a plain, some 7 miles wide covered with tamarisk and camel- thorn. Close to the foot of the pass there is some kavir where the going would be dangerous for camels after rain. But in the plain about a mile from the foot of the pass above-noted runs a small trickle from the Rud-i-Shlrin, which comes down from the hills and dries up before reaching the Rud-i-Shur. After crossing the plain the route enters the valley, or, as it is in many places, the gorge of the Rud-i-Shur. This is followed almost the whole way until after Haur is passed and the Naiband- Kerman route is joined. At one point the 1 ’oad runs up over a pass, known as the Gudar-i-Lakkar Kuh, which is very steep and trying to laden camels. It would involve an enormous expenditure of labour to render this portion of the road fit for wheeled artillery. The going in the waZa-beds is generally stony and very trying to transport animals. The fourth stage, across the desert, is generally estimated as being seven Hingums, i.e., in the language of the Khorasan camel-men, the camels are loaded seven times during the passage of the desert. Climate .—During the summer months a very hot wind is said frequently to spring up, which is fatal to animal life. It apparently resemble the simum of Arabia. Previous travellers have mentioned this wind as being known to the natives by the name of the BUd-i-Samum, but this name was not recognised when questions were put on the subject. During the winter months blizzards are not at all of uncom mon occurrence. These are much dreaded by the camel-men as they may result in loss of life to men and animals. When the blizzard is actually blowing, it is said to be impossible to continue the march, as the cold is intense, and the wind blows with such violence that neither men nor camels can stand. As a precaution, during the winter months, an extra provision of water and forage for the animals should be carried, so that109 r , almost, igand pitous into a camel- ' ivliere tin the ed nins- m from , or, as allowed aiband- i over a y steep lormous d fit for ly stony nated as iorisan passage wind is life. K ravellers s by the rognis^ uncom- lel-men When isible to d blows , stand, revision so that Route No. IV— contd. in case a blizzard is encountered the pangs of starvation and thirst may not be added to the suffering caused by exposure. Miscellaneous .—The camel caravans generally march about 10 a.m. and continue to until 5 P.M., when they halt to feed and rest. At about 9 p.m., the camels are again loaded and the march continued until about 8 a.m., when another halt is made. This is repeated until the desert is quitted. After the first night the men with the caravans, especially those not used to the work, become so sleepy and exhausted that the greatest care must be taken that no one is allowed to loiter or remain behind on the road. Men have been seen to fall to the ground whilst asleep on their donkeys, but they are so overcome by sleep that even the shock of the fall does not av'aken them. The village of Fidishk, situated about 25 miles to the V . of Birjand, furnishes the majority of the hardy camel caravan men, who frequent this route. This route during the winter months appears to be grven the preference by caravans going either to Kerman or Khabis. During the summer months the few caravans that go from KhorSsan to Kerman travel by the Gai m ab-Nalband -R avar route. . Water .—There is absolutely no water in the desert. Ine water of the Rud-i-Shur is so salt and bitter that it is untuink- able and injurious to both man and beast. All w^ater therefoie must be carried from Garmab. This water moreover, though drinkable, is brackish and impregnated with sulphur. It is most dangerous to rely solely on mussaks for one s w atei supply in the desert, since they are so liable to injury and leakage. Camels are not watered during their journey across the desert ; water, however, must be carried for donkeys, mules and horses. It was found that in winter the donkeys existed, without exhi biting injurious effects, on an allowance of a quartei of a bucket of w^ater, morning and evening, horses on half a bucket, and men on a pint of water. Sweet water is reached at about 125 miles at the lowest point of the Rud-i-Shirin near Sar-i-Jangal. Good and plentiful water is obtainable there from the stream. There was said to be water obtainable from a spring in the Kuh-i-Murghab, lying some 10 miles to the W. of tbe road at about 75 miels. That this supply could not be relied on is apparent from the fact110 Route No. IV — contd. jthat the spring and hill are said to owe their name to the fact that the spring is so small that it would only be able to provide sufficient water for a bird to quench its thirst. Pud,—vide remarks on grazing, under fodder. Fodder .—For the first two miles after, leaving Garmab, ,there is plentiful camel-grazing from tamarisk and adur . Once this zone is quitted, there is not a scrap of grazing or a vestige of vegetation of any kind or description until Sar-i-Jangal is reached at about 125 miles. Throughout the journey up the valley of Rud-i-Shirxn grazing from tamarisk and adur is plenti ful. Supplies .—There are absolutely no supplies of any description -to be obtained on this route till the village of Haur is reached. This village is a very small one, consisting of half a dozen houses. Small quantities of supplies could, however, be collected from the numerous villages and hamlets situated in the vicinity and from neighbouring valleys. No. of stage and total distance.

At 7J miles a dry hauz, known as Hauz-i-Kila-i-Mad’AH, which is reported to contain excellent water in most seasons. There is a brackish well, about 120 feet to the SW. of the hauz, and another at 11-|- miles. From here road bends more to S. and makes for hills on the opposite side of the dasht. At 131&gt; miles the bed of the Shur river is crossed which contains several streams of brackish water, about 6 inches in depth. Road keeps on its left bank for a little way ; about here a great quantity of firewood can be obtained. Road goes on steadily SW., making for Nalinau which can now be seen under the hills. Height of lowest point of valley is 3,360 feet. The road ascends about 200 feet up gentle foot hills and reaches Nalinau at 47 miles. There is one fair spring here of slightly brackish water, and one or two oozing springs ; they fall into a pond.

March to 60 Garmab, distant 13 miles. The road for the first three miles runs W. along the foot of the ridge of hills ; it then enters a nala-bed, up which it continues, the direction being generally W. The nala is wide, the bed easy-going, and has many tamarisk trees in it. At 5-5 miles a kutal is reached (height 3,940 feet), the watershed between the N. and S. slopes of the range. The road up it is very gentle and the kutal very low (305 feet above Nalinau). From here the road runs over undulating ground in a SW. and SSW. direction to about 9 miles, where it enters another broad nala-bed, down which it runs WSW. till Garmab is reached at 13 miles. Here there is an old tower situated on a knoll on high ground well above the nala-bed, the ground about being undulating. The road is quite passable for guns. How ever, like all roads, used only by baggage animals, It wouldRoute No. IV — contd. Tvant smoothing here and there, where cut by water-courses, but there is nothing that could not be done, as the guns went along. Garmab may be looked on as situated on the edge of the real Dasht-i-Lut. One has a very extensive view from here trom SE. round to W. Far away to the SE. a high conical peak, Shah Kuh, is visible. This lies a little to the S. of the route from Neh via Sar-i-Chah to Birjand, traversed by Khani- koff. To the S. were several lower hills, apparently detached which lie in the middle of the Lut near Khanikoff s road across it. To the SW. appeared the double peaked Kuh-i-Murghab which lies almost on the other side of the Liit not very far from Kerman. Directly W. was visible the high peaked Kuh-i- Naiband, at the foot of which Naiband, fifth halting place, is situated. • Water .—There is a hot spring source close under the tower on the high ground. The spring has a good steady flow of water much moi’e than at Kalman. The temperature of the issuing water is 107° (Fahrenheit). hen cooled it is drinkable, but salt and sulphury.

From j §5 Garmab the track descends gently into the Lut desert. The track is good and well defined. It runs over a level plain, the surface of which con sists of a sandy pat covered with black shingle. For the first ,10 miles there is certain amount of tamarisk and adur scattered about. At 34 miles a hollow in the desert is reached which is known as Daghar, and here the camel caravans are in the habit of halting. At 35 miles there branches off a well defined track to Khabis. At 62 miles the road crosses a succession of small dry nala-beds, known by the name of Haft Gaud. At 69 miles a road branches off to Faizabad. At 70 miles is a place where there are one or two small hillocks, known as Seh Changi. This is another much used halting-place. At about 80 miles the road crosses a zone of kavir, i.e., ground consisting of very salt clay, which has much the appearance of the effect that might be produced by baking powder. The whole of the surfaceRoute No. IV — contd. ;has risen in bubbles forming a hard crust. After rain this is said to be almost impassable for camels. The zone is about 6 miles in width. At about 116 miles the road begins to descend into the valley of the Shur Rud. The descent is steep and the road winds down to the river, which is crossed at about 118 miles. The river-bed is about 20 yards across ; the stream is about 6 inches in depth. The water is so salt that it is unfit for man or beast ; moreover, it is said to have injurious effects on any man or animal foolish enough to drink it. When crossing the stream care should be taken that the thirsty animals do not attempt to quench their thirst. Up to the point where the river is crossed there is not a vestige of grazing or of vegeta tion of any kind or description. All fodder must be carried for the animals. From the river there is a somewhat steep ascent for about a mile up a narrow nala or gorge and over a low pass. Thence the road descends on to a plain, the northern edge of which is covered with a growth of tamarisk. This is known as Sar-i-Jangal. In this plain the Shir in Rud, which has its source near Haur dries up, and the proximity of t e water to the foot of the pass above mentioned^ depends on the dryness of the season, and consequently the distance to which the water flows before drying up. In January the water was fount at a distance of about two or three miles from the foot. The water of the Rud-i-Shirin is sweet and plentiful. Water. —Procurable, see description of stage.

The road lies on the left bank of the stream, which is about 5 feet wide and varying in depth from ,3 to 6 inches. The plain is stony and is covered with a growth of adiir and shura and other camel-grazing plants. The usual oamping-ground is at the exit of the river from the hills Here four roads meet, namely, those from Garmab, Kerman, Aaiband and Khabis.Route No. IV— contd. Water .—?

The going is rough and stony and the stream has to be forded repeatedly, the depth of the water increasing rapidly as one advances. At about 3J miles the road leaves the bed of the stream turning up to the right over the left bank. It then runs over undulating stony ground in a direction nearly parallel to the course of the river. The turn-out of the river-bed is easy to miss and caravans some times continue up the bed of the stream. This is a round about route and the going is very bad through rocky gorges, the sides of which tower high above on either hand. At about 11 miles the road once more descends into the bed of the stream,which at this point runs in a broad open stony valley. After ascending the stream for a short distance the water again follows up the bed of the stream into a narrow gorge, in which there is a good deal of tamarisk. At about 13 miles the road leaves the stream turning to the right up a nala w’hich comes in on the left bank of the stream. There is a good track there for some five miles, ascending over rolling ground, on which there is a scanty growth of camel-thorn. The route then enters some very rugged and stony hills. The track at about 20 miles leaves the main water course by which the hills were entered, and turns off to the left up a smaller nala which leads to the foot of the Gudar-i-Lakkar Kuh. The ascent of this pass is most trying to camels on account of the steepness, but it is not stony. From the summit of the pass the road descends gradually to the bottom of the main valley of the Shirin Rud, which is reached at 224 miles. The track throughout the descent is, on the whole, good and not very stony, but it is very narrow in places, being worn out of the sides of very precipitous hills formed of a shaly soil. It would be very difficult to make this pass fit for the passage of wheels, and it is considered that much labour would be neces-115 Tom the ed of the direction I the first the road ough and depth of t3| miles the right y ground er.

Epitome .—This route may be conveniently divided into two sections— (1) Khusf to Khabis. (2) Khabis to Kerman. Section ( 1 ) is mostly across the desert. For over 100 miles before reaching Khabis not a drop of water is obtainable, nor is there any sign of vegetation. Water, food, firewood andRoute No. IV— contd. forage must be carried. The route is only used by camel cara vans which travel night and day across the waterless track, only halting for an hour or two for the animals to feed. Even then the route is only passable in winter. In summer the dreaded Bad-i-Samum blows, and if encountered means certain death ; it withers up and desicates any living body exposed to it. In winter the cold is often intense, and hurricanes blow with such violence that it is impossible to stand erect; when accompanied by snow they are a positive danger to life. Section (2) is a hill track, difficult in places but passable by mules. Only artillery of the lightest description could be taken by this route ; and the track would require a great deal of improvement to make it passable for field artillery.

A steep and rocky descent to a river bed which the route runs ■through then a narrow defile among hills. The track crosses and re-crosses the stream many times. Probably when the stream is swollen by heavy rains this part of the route would be impassable. The defile is left at 23 miles. The defile is ■called the Darreh-i-Sakht and contains large quantities of poisonous oleander of which great care must be taken. When animals eat it, the first sign of poisoning is a great weakness iin the legs. Then the pupil and ball of the eye dilates to or 6 times its normal size. A frothy foam appears at the corners ■of the mouth, the jaws close convulsively and the animal expires. Natives declare that they can save animals by administering a strong decoction of dates immediately after the poison has been swallowed ; but this remedy, however efficacious when given immediately, is no good when administered 2 or 3 hours after the poison has been consumed. The only method of safeguarding animals through this part is to muzzle them so that they cannot ■eat the poison.

At 9 miles remark- 137 able hills with scarped sides, road as if between two walls. At 18 miles reach what seems to be a wall of rock. The road enters it by what appears to be a nala-hed, | to 1 mile wide, from cliff to cliff. The -cliffs are formed by a limestone cap overlying unconformable blue clay bed, interspersed with strata of shale. It is a very curious place. Bed, up which road went, gradually narrowed, cliffs approaching one another more closely. Passed an imper ceptible watershed, and then descended through a similar nala to Chehilpai. Here is a good serai, a dry hauz and the well, all situated in the bed of this curious nala, which is here perhaps | mile wide, with cliffs on either hand. The road the whole way was very well-marked, being greatly used by pil grims. There were generally five or six well-worn tracks abreast. From the Naiband kutal to Chehilpai it is perfectly easy for guns. The Lut on the western side of the Naiband range appears to be much more hilly than to be eastward, rides of -detached hills being scattered over it, with next to no vegetation. All supplies, etc., must be carried ; firewood is very scarce. Water. —Well at Chehilpai is 87 feet below surface. It is approached by an inclined tunnel, down which steps (40 in number) are cut in the rock, more or less rough. It is very troublesome to water animals from, as the water has to be carried up these steps. Watering 36 miles and 6 horses about dried it out, but it filled up fairly well again in about 6 hours.

To S. a few miles off are said to be the remains of a Shahr-i-Lut, called. Rakkr. At 21 miles there are low hills and road winds up bed of a salt stream bordered with tamarisk, reaching Darband at 23 miles. There is one soldier who lives in the tower, a small but good caravanserai and a brackish spring situatd in a date grove. Supplies of forage, etc., are obtainable from the soldier, but in very small quantities. There are pillars at intervals of 2 miles on the Lut. Road good for wheels. About 5 miles from Darband is a mine of asbestos. In 1890 three Europeans came to see it. In 1892 they returned and took away some loads of the asbestos. Two miles above it is a spring (5,400'). The mountains on both sides are very high and contain game. Until 1883 there was a guard of 100 soldiers to escort the pil grims between Darband and Naiband as a protection against the raids of Baluchi camel riders from Sarhad.

After about miles it drops into the bed of nala, banks having this time become some 30 or 40 feet high. From here road goes along the stony bed of nala, hills gradually closing in on it, and passes to right of precipitous, flat-topped hill. Road, where possible leaves the bed and ascends the banks. Guns, however, would have to stick to the bed. It would be a heavy bit of work for them in any case. After a tiresome march of 13 miles Abld or Ab-i-BId is reached. The ascent is very considerable all the way, amounting to 1,660 feet. Here there is a small serai. There is a large willow tree on the rising ground, and from all over this bit of ground near the tree water oozes out, making little running streams. The water is good but scanty. The dasht is much more like the Afghan ones, having vegetation on it. A donkey track, passing numerous hamlets, runs from Abid to Zarand. Road runs from Abld SE., still up same valley, with high hill to S., for about 1 mile, where it passes over a gentle watershed, and, leaving the Ravar drainage, descends another narrow valley still in the same direction. At about 3J miles end of this valley is reached and road emerges into a sort of basin among high hills which receives drainage in various directions, the resulting drainage running apparently away NE. into the Lut. At this point road turns sharp to right and runs due S. The Khabis road branches off to the SE. At 2b miles low kutal over some clay hills is passed, and about miles a second higher and stonier kuial is crossed, and the road drops down on to Sar-i-Asp in the bed of a stream which makes its way into the aforesaid basin.

Epitome. —An important caravan road, being a continuation of the Bandar ‘Abbas-Yazd route. Much used by pilgrims travelling to Meshed. Suitable for camel transport and practi cable for field artillery, with slight improvements in stages 4 and 21. Major Sykes took a carriage with considerable difficulty, along stages 1 to 9, when marching from Kerman to Meshed. For his route onwards see note to stage 10. An elevation of 5,800 feet is reached in stage 2 ; the Gudar-i-Qalmarz (4,482') and the Gudar-i-Chinar (5,590') are crossed in stages 9 and 21, respectively. The first 100 miles of the road are infested by armed robbers who frequently attack caravans. Major Sykes had an escort of 4 savdrs and was not molested. Newcomen, 1905, says that camels take about 45 days to reach Meshed from Yazd (more in summer and spring, less in autumn and winter). Water. —Generally unsatisfactory; brackish or lad at stages 3, 4, 9, 16 (fresh water can be obtained a farsakh away) and 22 (except in winter and spring).

Here there is water and a caravanserai in an extremely ruinous condition. Road now gets somewhat more stony, but going is good. At 12| miles road enters the mountains, and ascends very gently and easily by a narrow valley, with high, steep, rugged and bare mountains close on each side. Road still good, and here valley is covered with tuffs of camel-thorn. At 14 miles ascent continues to a point 852 feet above Yazd and 4,630 feet above the sea. From here road gently descends over the same kind of ground, closely shut in by mountains. Road continues to descend till 15J miles (4,430 feet above the sea). From here a valley that expands to the dimensions of a plain falls by an easy descent to the west, and opens out into the great plain of Yazd. At 17 miles arrive at good caravanserai at Anjirak. Here there are latrines outside the caravanserai, a thing very rarely to be seen. Grass is the only thing to be bought here. Anjirak is nearly enclosed by high, bare moun tains ; there are stones everywhere. The serai is 80 yards square and would hold 400 men. Sykes makes this march 18 miles.

At 11^ miles the road is of a rather steeper ascent for 50 yards, with low black hills sweeping down on both sides, and reducing it to a narrow track, where there is only room for one horse to pass. Beyond this road is level and good descending very slightly. Here the valley gradually opens into a plain bounded on the left by high rugged bare mountains of red sandstone and on the right by low black rounded hills. At 14J miles reach altitude of 5,800 feet. Road is now in a plain or plateau with tufts of vegetation ; about 2 miles wide, sloping down from here very gently. Beyond this some old wells are seen, and at 18 miles the village and fort of Khurunak is reached. In this village there are 100 houses and a good, new, caravanserai. There is also a fort. This plain is 5,450 feet above the sea. There is no village nearer to Khurunak than Saghand (stage 4) to the K, or Ar 7 akan about 45 miles to the W. on a bearing of 255°.

Starting from Sag- 921 hand, road is over a plain, in some places rather rough, and crosses a gully here and there, one of which is about 20 feet deep ; but wheeled artillery might go over the whole. Wheeled transport upon leaving Saghand has to make a circuit to W. of village and track requires a little making, although carriage passed safely. In some places road goes over clay, surface which would be stickly in wet weather but these are short, and the road generally is very good. It gradually leaves to mountains on the left, and approaches some low broken hills. On the left there is broken ground. The plain is covered with tufts of vegetation. At 4 miles the hamlet of Dukali with round tower is passed having sweet water situated on left bank of nala. At Ilf miles halt at a houz, where the water is muddy and deficient in quantity ; hence road descends steadily, but easily, to Allahabad, which is reached at 14f miles. Here is a ruined fort and tumble-down caravanserai; no people ; no houses ; no cultivation ; no water. Road, which up to his point has been, though tolerably straight, over broken and rough ground with hills on both sides, now enters a plain sloping down from both sides to the centre. It is extremely salt, and there is a great efflorescence. At 18 miles reach the bottom by a gentle descent; altitude 3,490 feet. Gravel soil and covered with tufts of vegetation.

A low jagged black hill lies close on right. At 7 miles altitude is 4,610 feet. Beyond this the ascent is even more gentle than before, being only 100 feet per mile. Leaving black hill behind the country is now broken, and rough extending 3 or 4 miles to right, to bases of a rugged, red mountain that gives the name to the Gudar. On left are mounds of black limestone veined with quartz. Road runs close under these, ascending a dry water-course, the limestone mounds become larger, till they assume proportions of good sized hills. After this road winds about amongst low hills on both sides, and the summit of the Gudar-i-Surkh (“ the red pass ”) is gained at 8| miles. Altitude 4,890 feet. Road now descends a dry water-course; in some places imprac ticable for wheeled artillery, as the track is narrow with steep banks on each side ; but these are of clay, and it w'ould be easy for a few men to make a road. Road winds about in a general NNE. direction with clay mounds on both sides, des cending the dry bed of a watercourse. Further on the country gets more open, but still there are hills close on both sides. Road stony in places. At 11 miles descend into Pusht-i- Badam valley. Which opens out into plain. The road at first is near the mountains on left, but the robdt lies near a spur from those on right. From the Gudar, road at first descends somewhat more steeply than usual; but soon there is the usual gentle gradient. Plain is about 3 miles wide. At 16 miles the villages of Mazra’eh Bala and Hajiabad lie close under the hills on left about a mile away. One of these villages has a tower. They both lie close toge ther. At 17 miles arrive at the caravanserai or robot of Pusht- -i-Badam. This is a good building of brick, new, and in good order. The village has 200 houses.

Road runs at first 128f among low hills, then down the bed of a water-course, about 100 yards wide, gently descending with a high hill close on left, and a mountain away on the right, about 5 miles distant. Surface stony, but fairly good. At 5 miles Shor Ab with half a dozen houses, a tower and a very small patch of cultivation with a few trees and one or two dejected looking dwarf date-palms. There is some water, and though it is very salt, horses will drink it. At 10 miles tank with sweet water. From here there are two roads to Robat-i-Khan. The northern or shorter road is the one now described. There are no dwellings of any kind on this road. At 12 miles the mountain on the right ends, and the plain stretches many miles to the E. On left is the same apparently limitless plain. The road up to this is hard and good. In front to the NE. there is a distant range of hills, towards which the road is directed. At 14 miles there is some small tamarisk here brown and scrubby; and near this, road passes over one or two sandy bits. At 15 miles road is again good and hard, and the growth of tamarisk ends. At 15f miles road passes through sand hills. Going very heavy. Up to 17 miles road has steadily descended. Alti tude here 2,310 feet. Road now suddenly leaves the heavy sand, and by a gentle ascent crosses end of some low black hills on right. Here road is hard and good. At about this point is the boundary between Khorasan and Isfchan. At 19 miles road enters an immense strectch of sandhills, where there is a considerable growth of fairly large tamarisk shrubs, and also a good quantity of yellow grass in tufts. Going is terribly heavy. Camel caravans halt in these sandhills, as there is good feeding for camels, but of course, no water. There is also plenty of fuel. Water. — Nil.

There is a flat-topped mountain in the range now drawing near, called the Takhs-i-Shah ‘Abbas. It lies 2 or 3 miles to the right of the point, where the road subsequently enters the hills. At 9 miles the road finally emerges from the sand on to hard ground. The road through the sand has been fairly level with slight ascents and descents, some rather steep. Now it begins to ascend regularly but gently. At 10 miles a tank of salt water. Horses drink it freely. The road now gradually enters the hills. At 15 miles the black hill on the left comes to an end, and the plain extends in that direction to the horizon. There are black hills on the right, 1 mile distant. At 16 miles road descends the stony bed of a dry watercourse, and is completely enclosed by hills. There are one or two sandy bits, but generally it is hard and firm to Robat-i-Khan. At 19 miles, Robat-i-Khan where there is a good new caravanserai with a fine badgir or wind tower, also the remains of an old caravanserai. There is also a fort, a few houses, a small patch of cultivation, and one or two very small date palms. Water .—Brackish fresh water 1 mile to NW. Supplies. —Scanty. 9 QALMARZ .. 16 m.

The water is sweet. Road now descends regularly and more rapidly, and is stony. There are a great many small ascents and descents into ravines from 20 feet to 50 feet deep, and some of the gradients into these are steep. Track up river-bed extremely difficult, but just possible for carriage. This is the worst section cn the road for some 4 miles. At 13 miles gain the crest of the Gudar-i-Qalmarz, altitude 4,482 feet. The pass is only just practicable for wheeled transport. Hence road for £ a mile is nearly level; it then descends steadily through a valley.

Road continues to des- (Ja’afarabad). cend in the same 176f (3,290'b direction, the valley gradually opening out and enclosed by high, bare and rugged hills. At 2 miles, road turns more northerly. At 4| miles there is a trifurcation of roads. One to right leads to a well; the centre one goes on a bearing 25° direct to Shur Ab ; left hand one to Ja’afaru or Ja’afarabad, which bears nearly due N. from here. A not very high hill divides the two roads, and they join a little short of Shur Ab. Plain here is about 2 miles wide, hard, and covered with tufts. Altitude 3,720 feet. Route No. 2 connects in this stage. Road now' approaches the hill that divides the two roads, and at 7 miles passes low hills close on right. These are skirted for some distance, the plain being 4 or 5 miles wide. The road crosses the plain, and ascends very slightly to Ja’afaru, which lies close under the hills on the W. ; but another direct road to Shur Ab goes straight on skirting the eastern hills. Ja’afaru is a very small village of 10 houses, an old tower, a small patch of cultiva tion, and half a dozen date palms. Shur Ab, 22 miles from Qalmarz, is sometimes made the 10th stage. There is a ruined caravanserai, water brackish.

At 10J miles plain is shut in by hills on both sides, and is not more than \ a mile wide. Here is a bifurcation of roads. One going nearly E. to Shur Ab, distant about 2 miles, and thence to Chahar Deh ; the other turning NE. to Deh Muhammad and Shirkhist. The latter is the one here followed. Shur Ab is visible from here, bearing E., also great plain of Chahar Deh, stretching to horizon. This plain appears to extend a great distance to E., and to be cut up on its westerly side by a series of small ridges cropping up out of the sand, and running parallel to one another, nearly N. and S. Road continues in a NE. direction, skirting the hills on left. At 12| miles there are some trees close on right. Here the wide and dry bed of a water-course is crossed ; here also are some wells and salt water. Road now gradually leaves the mountains on left, and enters ridges spoken of above. At 15 miles ground is very much cut up by ravines. Road, how ever, is pretty good. From here a tower and some date trees are seen a few miles off to the NNW. At 18 miles road winds in a maze of low hills where there is a rill of water flowing from left to right. In the valleys between these ridges there is some coarse grass, a little scrubby tamarisk, and camel thorn. At 18§ miles another rill running from left to right. Road goes up and down a good deal. The ascents and descents, 20 feet to 50 feet; some of them rather steep, but road is good and hard. Here there is a little sandy valley, but going is not heavy. At 19J miles another trickle of water.

At 11 miles there is another open space with a patch of cultivation. At llj miles a road from Bijvat joins in from left. Here there is a stream of water. The cultivation soon after this comes to an end. At 13 miles there are neither trees nor cultivation, and the valley is surrounded by low hills. At 14 miles gain the summit of the Gudar-i-Chinar by an easy road. Altitude of the gitdar 5,590 feet. The ascent has been gradual, and nowhere very steep ; but road goes a great deal up and down small spurs. * In some places it is almost impassable for wheeled artillery, but it could easily be made practicable. From here the snow range above Nishapur is visible, and road is directed generally on the highest point. Up to here, road which has zigzagged about, has borne away to W. From the gudar, road is good, and descent slight into open valley surrounded by low bibs. At 111 miles tliere is a stream of water, and cultivation commences. Near here is the small village of Chinar, with trees, and 50 houses, lying a little to right of road. There is a good deal of cultivation also. At 19| miles a tower lies a little to right of road, and tliere is some cultivation round it. At 20 miles there is a stream of sweet water. A ruined fort lies a J mile to the NW. An isolated pyramidal peak lies also to NW., rising alone amongst the low hills in that direction. To W. the country is broken and hilly for some miles, but there are no high mountains. To E. there is a distant range of hills. Plain is much cut up and broken. There are low hills in every direction. Altitude of this point 4,850 feet. The «148 Route No. V — contd. road proceeds in a NNW. direction among low hills. It con tinues thus as far as Kilah-i-Maidan. At 24 miles there are three villages ; they are poor places, containing some 30 houses each, all enclosed in forts, which are square, with towers at the corners. There is a considerable amount of cultivation, where not cultivated the plain is stony and covered with tufts. The road from the guddr to this point is good. At the Kilah-i-Maidan the water is sweet from qandts, and supplies are procurable. The principal of the three villages is on the right of road. 22 SANGIRD 12 m. General direction N. (3,910'). At 1 mile road 388f strikes the bed of a dry, water-course, but running alongside it is an irrigation channel. Road follows down this water-course for some dis tance, keeping on its left bank. At 3|- miles the large, wide bed of a water-course enters from left. There is in winter a small salt stream of water in it. Road now follows down the winding river, keeping entirely to its bed; the amount of water increases, and the banks, which at first were only 6 feet or 7 feet high, get higher and higher, until the river is running through a gorge, between steep hills of clay and sandstone, 200 feet to 300 feet high, which slope sharply down to the bed, leaving but little flat ground for bed of river. Road is good enough in dry weather, but impassable when river is swollen, and then there is no alternative route, except for people on foot. Bed of river is covered with fine black sand, but going very good. The water is crossed innumerable times. Road continues thus without variation until 10 miles from Kaleh- -i-Maidan.

Ascent easy, road very good. Altitude 3,700 feet. Prom the crest road descends a little to a small uneven basin, surrounded by low rounded hills. Good grazing for sheep and camels. At 17| miles road ascends again very slightly. At 18J miles pass a well. At 19 miles road descends very gentlj- down valley about 200 yards wide, bounded by low hills. At 20f miles some dirty water is passed. At 21 miles reach village of Pai Baz, enclosed in walled square with towers at the angles. At none of the villages about here are there any gardens or fruit trees, and they are most miserable-looking places, with dome-roofed houses of mud. Pai Baz is situated at the edge of another great plain running E. and W., and bounded on the N. and S. by low hills. The hills on the N., however, do not extend beyond the bearing NNE., and on that bearing, and to the E. of it, the plain appears to extend to the foot of the Nishapur Mountains. There are a great number of villages in this plain towards the E., each of which has its patch of cultivation, and is more or less supplied with water. There are also in the plain great numbers of little towers, formerly built as a protection against the Turkomans. 24 KAFGlR . • 164 m. General d i r e c t i on (3,200'). ENE.

About 2 miles after leaving Yazd by the Narinj Kilah, desert of heavy sand is reached. About 4 miles road crosses a ridge of hard sand and thence to Hauz-i-Ja’afar. Ten miles from Yazd is a succession of hard sand and gravel ridges and heavy, soft sand hollows. Water is good (from two db- ambdrs) at Hauz-i-Ja’afar. Road then enters the hills seen N. of Yazd an ascends very gradually over stones and gravel up a valley enclosed by steep, rugged and bare hills on either side. At 6 miles (from Hauz-i-Ja’far), a river-bed is crossed and then there is an almost imperceptible rise to the ■watershed between this valley and the next. The road then descends very easily to Anjirak, the general direction of the march being NNE. and NE., and the distance not far short of 22 miles. ALTERNATIVE ROUTE V(B).

At 6 miles the summer track from Meshed joins and (see Alternative stages VI A), Nishapur is reached at 25 miles. Nishapur is enclosed by a partly-ruined wall and shallow moat. It may be entered by the gate in the western way or it can be skirted by passing to the S. and thence around the SE. corner to the large serai on the E. side. Vehicles, however, must go through the town, the other road being very narrow in places. Nishapur possesses telegraph and post offices. Outside the town, on the N., E. and S., there are two factories fitted with machines for ginning and compressing cotton for export, run by Russian Armenians. There is a fair-sized bazar, well- stocked with Russian goods. The prosperity of Nishapur, like that of Sabzawar, has returned, thanks mainly to the demand in Trans-Caspia for cotton. (A track suitable for mules runs N. from Nishapur to Ghinaran ; said to be 2 stages.) The Governor-General of Nishapur is appointed direct from Tehran, and is not under the Governor-General of Khorasan.Route No. VI — contd.

In summer and autumn, before rain, the stage may be shortened 4 miles by keeping to the left along this sheet of water. As the ground here is soft it is easy to see which way the bulk of the traffic is going. The track is un* dulating and stony but provides good going. At 14 miles a square watch-tower and large db-ambdr by the road-side. The water here, rain-water, is sometimes drinkable and is seldom sufficiently bad for animals to refuse to drink it.

At 39 miles the caravan and wagon roads bifurcate, the latter running through the town of Shahrud, the former passing to S. through narrow and tortuous, lanes dull of holes.160 Route No. VI— contd. Shahrud originally consisted of a walled village, the avails of which are still in good repair, around which the modern town and bctzdr have been built. It is situated close up under the mountains near an opening in them which leads to Bustam and Astarabad, and through which the Shahrfid enters the plain. _ On the N. of the town there is another outlet to the Astara bad road. It passes through the burial ground in the same direction as the Shahrud-Astarabad telegraph line goes over a stony pass, and thence by a winding descent gains the Bustam plain. The two roads unite about 3 miles N. of Shahrud. The town possesses a post office and telegraph office. There are several blacksmiths and shoeing-smiths, also a coach and waggon repair shop. Water .—From the river and from a qandt. The first is good, but the water is doubtful, as it comes underneath a graveyard, where it is in one place not more than 2 yards from the surface. Fuel. —Abundant. Fodder .—No grazing in the immediate vicinity. Supplies. —Good. About 4,000 sheep and goats, 100 cattle. Transport mules and waggons may often be hired here.

Take road to left on entering valley. Simalqan is the name given to a collection of a dozen small villages, containing perhaps 500 houses in all. Shahabad, at 14 miles, is the only village through which the road actually passes. Road through valley level. Supplies. —Abundant. 9 CHAMAN-I .. 19 m. At 7 miles village^ of BID Kalat-i-Zamin-i-Sufi 117 (5,000'). supplies very scarce. At 12 miles, Juza, a small village. Road branches here, one to left going to Robat-i-’Ashk. Track here enters defile and rises slowly to Chaman-i-Bid. Here there is good grazing and water, but no village. The defile is known as the Darkash Pass and is thus described by Napier ; the ascent is very gradual and the road is passable for wheeled traffic throughout. The Aleh Dagh range on the S. terminates at the Darkash Pass, and the Kurkhud range here commences and extends eastwards, gradu ally rising in height. At first the hills have no wood on them, but further E. junipers commence to show, till at Chaman-i-Bid the range is pretty thickly dotted with them. Chaman-i-Bid itself consists of a level open tract at the top ot the pass with a spring of water in the centre. 10 ROBAT-I- .. 12 m. Leading up the level KARABIL Chaman-i-Bid plain 129 (4,200'). for the first 2 miles, cross the watershed at Sangchil at a height of some 200 feet above the spring, and thence commence a gradual descent o169 mdRilaTiit gest is ttii :er abundant ihgan.

For the first 4 or 5 miles road traverses the northern side of a plain, that slopes away down to the SE., and, finally, drains into Shaughan, the only thing visible to break the monotony of its arid surface being the small tappeh or mound of Robat-i-’Ashk away in the distance to the S. The road here runs W. immediately under the Kurkhud range. To the N. of the Kurkhud hill lay the Kastan spring, forming the source of the Fucha stream. About half way from Chaman-i-Bid a slight descent is come to, and beyond that the plain slopes westwards, finally draining into the Dehaneh-i-Gurgah near Dasht. This plain is known in its upper part as the Karabil valley. Robat-i-Karabil consists of a small village of 5 or 6 houses built near the ruins of an old stone robdt. No water in this stage between Chaman-i-Bid and Robat-i-Karabil. Water .—Scanty supply but it could probably be improved. Supplies. —Scarce. 11 DASHT .. 17 m. Eight miles W. of (3,000'). Robat-i-Karabil and 146 9 miles E. of Dasht is the little village of Armutli containing 5 houses, and situated at the foot of the Sarai range which bounds the valley on the S. The Karabil valley gradually narrows, as it goes W. and at Armutli is barely a mile in width, and half way to Dasht, becomes quite narrow. The road there leaves it and descends through the hills to the S. into the Dasht plain. The village of Dasht contains about 60 families of Gandar Turks. These families provide a guard of 25 savdrs who are all armed with Werndl rifles. These 25 savdrs are supposed to keep a watch on the road from Sugha, the valley lying to the W. of Fucha, and other places by which the Yamuts cross the Qara- tigan hills to the N. These hills to the N. and NW. of Dasht are wooded on their upper slopes with mdzu trees. Below them are sprinkled small junipers, but these end here, and arq not to be seen further W.170 Route No. Yll—contd. Gurgan defile. Lofty hills on either side wooded to their summits with mdzu, a kind of oak, and the valley, which, as a rule, does not exceed 200 yards in width, full of trees of various sorts more or less covered with moss, lichen and mistletoe. The road is stony in places, and in others, to judge from the holes, it must be very muddy in wet weather. The jungle is so dense that nothing but a pack animal could get through and a regular road would have to be cut through the wood before it could be made passable for wheels. Laden camels must have difficulty in getting through. The descent is gradual, but about 3,100 feet in the 11 miles. The stream for the first half of the way is very small, but lower down it increases in size to some 12 feet in width, and nearly a foot in depth. The village of ’Ishaqi lies away up in the hills to the S. and is not visible from the road. It contains some 20 families of Turks. Supplies procurable. The road continues on down the defile through thick wood. The trees on the hill-side are of fair but not great size, but the oaks in the valley rise to a height in places of 100 and 120 feet with a circumference of 14 or 15 feet at the base. In addition to the oaks there are species of beeches and sycamores and a dozen other kinds of trees, and the dades are full of brambles, ferns and bracken. Some 4 miles below Ishaqi the defile gradually widens, and the narrow pass may be said to end there. Gurgan. like Simalqan, is the name given to a group of villages. Tangrah is the first at 17 miles. There are many encampments of Goklan Turkomans in the valley of the Gurgan river. Water .— miles from Tangrah the road branches, the one to left leads to Gumbad-i-Kabus about 18 miles from last stage ; the other, which should be followed, keeps on right bank of Gurgan river and goes on to Baba Shir. At Tusa (right bank) 2 miles from where road branches, there is a ford, and from here to Passang is about 4 miles. Fuel .— Fodder .— Supplies. —Obtainable. 13 PASANG 180 .. 17 m.

After leaving Miang KATUL. road enters jungle 221 and for 12 miles is very bad, water-courses and streams with steep banks being numerous. Findarisk like Simalqan, being the name of a group of villages, is 12 miles from Miang. Namtalui, 13 miles and slightly to right of road, being first village of any size. From here road is good and villages every J mile or so until Findarisk district is left when 6 miles brings you to Aliabad-i-Katul, (name of group of 16 villages). Rice is staple food here, bread is scarce. 16 ASTARABAD.. 31J m. Direction slightly S.

At 24 miles, Nau Deh, and, at 3J miles, Pichak to the N. of the track. At 7 miles. Bariftan and, at 8 miles, Muhammadabad to the S. of the track. Behind the latter village is the Dehaneh Katul. At 9£ miles, there is a belt of forest, with a stream at 10| miles, the small district of Fakhr-Tmad-ud-Din, is now entered, and this forest is considered to be very unsafe for caravans, owing to Turkoman gangs. At 15 miles, the village of Kinareh or Daulatabad to the N. of the track, shortly beyond which the forest termi nates. At 16 miles, Nau Deh to the N. of track, and at 17£ miles, Takiabad, also to the N. of the track, where the stage can be broken ; behind is Turang Tappeh. At 20£ miles, ChauplanI to the S. and Mazdan Kila to the N. of track ; then Sultan Kila and the shrine of Khadiju to the N., and Isfan Kila and Jilin Bala to the S. of track. A^ 27 miles Siyah Talu, Sultanabad and Faizabad to N. of track. In the distance to the N. deserted Ak Kila stands up on the Gurgan.172 Route No. VII — concld. Astarabad gives the impression of being well set up when approached from the E., and a clump of very high chindrs inside the walls show up before the town itself is sighted. A gradual rise is made to the eastern wall in which there is no gate, and the track leads round to the Bustam gate. Astarabad has a population of some 8,000. A fair bazar and three caravansarais. Supplies. —Ample. ^ In the Gurgan valley there is, generally speaking, a good deal of rain, which increases in amount as' the Caspian is approached. In the winter of 1893 Sykes found the country a morass, and in the case of military operations, this would have to be taken into account. As a set off to this, there is excellent grazing in the spring and early summer also fuel is abundant except in the open steppe. FARIJ (Stage 1) to BUJNURD (Stage 6) via ' RAZMAKAN.

Following the water course which runs between orchards, a defile is entered, on each side of which are great cliffs nearly perpendicular, at the base of which the stream winds. After this the path lies up and down a succession of barren hills. Large flocks and the black tents of nomads visible m the distance in April. Pass Kizil Kila ( the red fort ), with a trickle of water. Thence over barren hills to the large village of Nuvdak, where there is ample water, irrigating many thousands of acres of wheat cultivation. Then to Chinaran through beautiful scenery.

The valley ends in a well cultivated plain, surrounded by hills, and containing many orchards. \ illages of Husaina- bad, 30 families, Qishlaq, 15 families, and the small fort of Guk Kamar. Thence the road runs up a sharp ascent to a dip, called the Ak Kutal (white pass), from which there is an extensive view, including Bujnurd. The road then leads down uncultivated hill slopes, and after several ascents and descents another village is reached. Thence over the plain to Bujnurd. ALTERNATIVE ROUTE VII (B).

Sykes was entertained by him and saw two Dimadi’s Greek Agents of Bujnurd, who sells silkworm “ seed ” also an Armenian and a Russian subject, who sold tea and sugar and bought cattle. The reeds, some 15 feet high, begin in this district and cover almost the whole valley, which is apparently most fertile. The site must be most unhealthy. The valley opens out rapidly ; at 15 miles the Gurgan River, which is easily fordable and flows between high banks, is crossed at the ruins of Shahrak, which are important, but which are difficult to identify. At 19£ miles, the semi-permanent camp of182 Route No. VII — contd. Chakdr. The plain is clear and level close by, and we saw millions of pintail sand grouse. Chakur is held to be the centre of Gurgan, which is the valley inhabited by the Goklan Turkoman. There were a few camps of Goklan nomads scattered about, but it is deplorable to see square miles of fine land given over to a few hundred families of a nomad tribe. Supplies .—Small quantities at high rates. 3 PARAS .. 9| m. Direction approxi- (600') mately W. skirting 53f the Nilah. Kuh, which is beautifully wooded. Half way up a prominent spur are the ruins of a fort known as Takht-i-Rustam. Hidden away out of sight of the track which, generally speaking, lay through reed brakes, are a few villages inhabited by Persian speaking agriculturists. After passing the Nilah Kuh, the district is termed Haidarabad. At miles Tarlui Tappeh to S., and Khaidar Tappeh to N. of track. At miles camp in the district of Khar, near ruins of Paras, which was possibly an ancient capital of Parthia. The relations between the Goklan and the Yamut are not good ; the former is much the weaker tribe. 4 GUMBAD-I- .. 141 m - The famous Gumbad KABtTS or Dome bore 250° 68 (200'). from Paras, and the route lay across a plain, with less and less of the reed brakes, as the road goes W. At 1^ miles, Tanga Tappeh to S. and Shah Tappeh to N., at 4£ miles, Tappeh-i-Misr Khan and, at 6 miles, Kila Giaur, both to S. of track. Beyond this last named mound the Yamut country begins. At 7 miles, Sula Tappeh and, at 8 miles, a sluggish tributary of the Gurgan, which only a few miles off. Beyond it, the open steppe begins. At 12 miles, the ruins of Hajihur lay to the N. of track and, at 14 miles, the Russian cantonment of Gumbad-i-Kabus. This interesting Russian outpost has become the capital of the district, and shops are kept both by Armenians and Persians. It is crossed by a wooden bridge, guarding which is a custom 0 post. Water. —From a muddy rivev distant about 1 mile to the N. Supplies .—Abundant ,Route No. VII — contd. 5 RAMlAN .. '20£ m. From Gumbad-i- — Kabus, the route 88 | most usually fol lowed by messengers runs down the right bank of the Gurgan to Ak Kila, whence it is about 10 miles into Astarabad. The route Sykes followed would be that used by caravans as a rule, although sometimes the Fidarisk district is made for a direct way. Direction due S., passing the extensive ruins of the ancient city of Gurgan at 2 miles. Just beyond, a second Kara Su, termed the Sumbar by Colonel Yate, is crossed by a wooden bridge. At 4 miles, the Purta Su is crossed by a ford. Both flow between high banks, as the alluvial soil is very soft. At 8 miles, the forest is again entered. Ramian, a large village of 200 houses, is situated in a clearing up valley. A route leads across the hills to Shahrud. The telegraph line from Gumbad-i-Kabus to Astarabad was festooned along the route, and the Russians who work via Chat-i- Atrak make no efforts to have it mended. There are telegraph offices at Gumbad-i-Kabus, Ramian and ’Aliabad (Katul). Supplies. —Abundant. 6 SAR-I-CHASH- 10 m. From Ramian, Kila MEH Maran, a very fine, 98J (250')- flat-topped moun tain, bears 195° ; it lies some 15 miles up the valley. For 1£ miles, direction is NW. until the forest is re-entered, when the track swings W., and thence WSW., parallel to the range. Owing to heavy rain Sykes stopped at the picturesque village of Sar-i-Chashmeh. The forest is thicker in this district, with wild vines and other creepers. At the same time there is not much undergrowth. Supplies. —Abundant. 7 ’ALIABAD .. 15J m. General direction (Kattjl) WSW. Ride through 114 (350')- beautiful forest and cross a brook at 3 miles. To the S. of track is Shirabad, the home of Saiyid-Ullah-Khan, the Governor of the district. He is termed the Ilkhani, and is supposed to incite the Turkoman to make raids and to indulge in cattle-lifting, etc. At 4^ miles, a low spur, termed Gardaneh-i-\ alaman (350 ), is crossed.184 Route No. YII— concld. From it a view is gained of the fertile district of Findarisk, which is erroneously shown as a town on the map. Descending, at 7 miles, the large village of Namtalu. Two miles farther on is Darkela, the chief village of the district, which is evidently most fertile. At 12 miles a track branches off to Shahrad close to a river termed the Surkh Mahalleh ; and, at 15£ miles, Aliabad, the chief village of the Katul district—a large and fertile centre. ROUTE NO.

Epitome .—From Meshed to Kuchan the road runs up the Meshed valley which is dotted with villages and nearly all cultivated. The road rises very gently until halfway between Mihrabad and Farkan and then drops slightly into Kuchan. There is no position of military importance in the valley, and supplies are very plentiful. At villages where supplies are few, grain, etc., can easily be collected from neighbouring villages. From Kuchan to Duringar the road runs through hills with very little supplies and very bad going for transport. There are defensive positions all along the route and, in the gorge to N. of the Darvand Pass in Stage No. 10 , twenty men could hold up a Brigade. From Duringar to Muhammadabad road runs down the Duringar River valley, which is very narrow to begin with but which widens out to about five miles near Muhammadabad. To the S. of this valley there is another parallel valley of about the same width, bounded to the S. by the high hills which bound the N. edge of the Meshed valley and which are crossed between Kuchan and Duringar. The road is in use by motors. In June 1927, the bridge at Bajgiran was broken down.Route No. VIII— contd. Camping-grounds. —For an army crops as far as stage 7.

Camel-grazing. —Good on hills. Supplies. —Grain, 50 kharwars approximately. 10 DURB ADAM .. 10 m. General direction (5,200'). NNW. At 1£ miles 132 small village of Kishlak. Road winds along Duringar stream down the valley ; after leaving Kishlak, road enters Durb Adam defile, at first wide, with low hills on each side, but narrowing half-way to 150 yards, with high precipitous hills on either side. Stream crossed by stone bridges in three places, but is also fordable. A stretch of over 200 yards of road, where it runs alongside the river, has been washed away owing to the erosion of the banks, and carriages and fourgons have to drive over 200 yards in the river itself. This is no slight inpedimenn to traffic, as the river sometimes contains as much as 2 feet of water, and the river-bed contains numerous snags and boulders. A difficult stage. Country mountainous and barren, except near stream. HillsRoute No. VIII — contd. well adapted for guerilla warfare. Road kept in fair repair except as noted. 11 BAJGIrAN-I- .. 14 m. At Durb Adam stream IRAN (5,500'). goes northwards ; 14 g road leaves it and goes up a side valley. Steady ascent in one place, through a gorge barely wide enough to allow two vehicles to pass. A few miles up road leaves valley and commences to ascend range of hills to N., rising rapidly by zigzags. The zigzag ascent is very steep but the road here is in fair condition. Descent on N. side steep for 1 | miles; road then ascends again, crossing two low watersheds before reaching Shamkhal valley, in which is Persian Bajgiran. At 12 miles seraj and spring of fresh water, whence water is carried to Bajgiran. The water there is salt, and hoises only drink it with reluctance. Wheat grown on the hills above the village. Small Persian village with serai and few supplies. It is the Persian frontier station and customs post. Telegraph office. Shamkhal valley narrow but level ; drains towards Duringar. Road as in previous stage. 12 (POSTAL STAGE) 16 m. Road ascends slightly (KURT SU.) to low kutal at head j 02 of valley, which is on actual frontier line and from there descends to Russian frontier post of Gaudan (2 miles). It is sometimes called by Persians Bajgiran-i-Rus to distinguish it from Bajgiran-i-Iran the Persian post, but every one knows it now as Gaudan. It is a small village containing a Russian population of about 100. Telegraph office. Fifty frontier guards under an officer and customs officials in a fortified stone blockhouse, which lies a few hundred yards N. of the frontier line, and 1 ^ miles from the village of Gaudan, where the telegraph and passport offices are. Near the village is about 1| square miles of cultiva tion. Small bad serai ; water and supplies very scanty. It is situated at head of valley draining southwards. Road after leaving it, for a few miles, keeps high up above bed of stream and then drops by series of zigzags to bottom of valley and on down it, where the road through the gorge is broken away, and carts have to move in the dry bed of the stream. At 16 miles is the half-way halting-place between Gaudan and Askhabad, G190 Route No. VIII — conoid. where relays of horses are kept for the postal troiks, etc. The postal station is called Kurt Su.

Road heavy till last 7 miles, when it is metalled. ROUTE No. IX. MESHED to SARAKHS via MAZDARAN. Ill miles. 6 stages. MacLean, 1889 ; Smyth, 1902 and 1906 Marsh, 1914. M. A. Meshed, 1927. Epitome. —This is the direct road from Meshed to Sarakhs along the right bank of the Kashaf Rud. Camel road practicable for artillery with slight improvement to the Mazdaran pass in stage 4. The pass would offer no great obstacles to the construc tion of a road. Smyth believes that guns could be taken all along the route. A fair weather motor road could be made between Mazdaran and Sarakhs. The Kashaf Rud is difficult to cross except at the recognised fords on account of the steep banks and soft bottom. There are numerous good fords unless the river is high in spring, or after unusual rain. The fords are usually about 1 foot to 2 feet deep, and the current runs at 1 to 1^ miles an hour. In May 1906 these fords were 3 feet to 4 feet deep and the current was running at from 4 to 7 miles an hour, making it very difficult for a good horse to cross. The only bridge across the river between Meshed and Sardrabad is a temporary structure (1914), passable for camels but not for wheeled traffic, 1 mile W. of Ismailabad in stage 3.Route No. IX — contd. The Mazdaran pass, 3,200 feet, offers a strong defensive position. It can, however, be turned by various footpaths over the precipitous Kara Dagh range. Water .—Sufficient for the above force as far as Mazdaran and the whole way if alternative Route IX(A) be followed. By the main route, however, should the reservoirs at Shurrukh fail there would be in summer a waterless track of 46 miles between Mazdaran and the Kandukli canal in stage 6. Supplies .—Rough supplies sufficient for a cavalry regiment with transport, procurable at two days notice at all stages up to and including Mazdaran (4). After that by the main route no supplies are procurable until the vicinity of Sarakhs is reach ed ; and by alternative Route IX(A) nothing is available at Chah Haji Ramzan except scanty grazing. Alternative stages. —(A) is the route which Smyth followed in 1906. He says that it is the shorter of the two, but as it works out to 5 miles more than the one given as the main route, the latter is probably under-estimated. The route is practi cable for field artillery and for strong two-wheeled carts with the exception of from stage 1, mile 1, to mile 10, but a detour of some 8 miles could be made to avoid this difficult section, which is only suitable for pack animals. The Mazdaran pass itself is difficult, but is not impassable for field guns. Carts would require extra help in ascending and descending the pass. There is a very difficult winding gorge 9 miles long in this stage. Alternative routes .—By Route No. IX(B), 144 miles in 8 •stages. (2) By Route No. VIII(l) to Amirabad, and thence 8 miles down the valley of the Ab-i-Garm or Khaur Su to Cheh- cheh and then by Route No. VHI(m) to Sarakhs, 96 miles in 6 stages. This is the shortest of the 3 routes and is practi cable for camels throughout but water and supplies are very scarce in the last 2 stages. No. of stage and total distance.

There is an equally good road down the left bank. At 3 miles pass Buz Shakh on the left. At 5£ miles villages of Ishabad on the right and Sbahrabad on the left. At 7 miles Kila Bagh on the right, and at 9 miles Husainabad on the same side. At 11 miles Kila Ulang on the left, where the river is struck. At 15 miles village of Rajbabad on. the left. Here there is a ford across the river, immediately below the ruins of the Gazgun bridge. From this ford, a mule track leads, ENE., across the foot of the hills, to Mazdaran 41 miles, by the follow ing route :—Narband, 6 miles ; Chapunak, 8 miles ; Chinarak, 4 miles to the N. of Nazaria, 12 miles; Ordukak, 14 miles; Maiamai, 16 miles ; Nauruzabad, 18 miles ; Gazal Yar, 19 miles ; Ahmad Sara, 27 miles ; Gulu, 33 miles ; Mazdaran, 41 miles. At 16 miles Chulghi on the left. At 28 miles Langarak, 30 houses. The road, this stage, is unmetalled and of firm earth and is passable for all arms. The river in May is fandable almost anywhere, generally speaking, for there aie easy fords near most villages, the depth and current varying according to the season. It is deepest in the spring of the year. The river banks are steep and the bottom muddy and treacherous. Paver flows down a valley some 10 to 12 miles broad, bounded by mountains, and steeper and higher on the northern side. Many villages en route and all over the valley. Only the chief ones are named here. From these ordinary supplies are pro curable. Camping grounds. —Camping grounds are numerous ; almost any open space near the river is suitable for camping ; there are generally good places near villages. A small party could break the stage and camp near any one of the numerous villages passed en route. Water. —From the river, slightly brackish. Fuel. —Fair amount from brushwood in river bed. Fodder. —Good grazing for camels, especially in summer. Some grazing for horses. Supplies. —Supplies of all sorts, enough for a brigade pass ing through might be collected from the country. 2 KICHIDAR .. 17 m. General direction (2,680'). ESE.

At 12 miles Siah Bala, 50 houses ; and at 17 miles reach Kichidar, 80 houses. Road as in the last stage, but not so good. There are occasional sharp turns along the banks or on spurs of hills, but it is passable for field guns. The river valley is as in the last stage, but is more contracted, being from 1 to 2 miles wide only. Camping grounds .—Camping grounds are not so good as the valley is more cramped, but there is enough room almost any where along the river bank for any force likely to pass this way. W ater.- —Brackish. Fuel .—More than at stage 1. Fodder .—Grazing better than in stage 1. Supplies .—Less supplies, as villages are fewer ; supplies might be collected for one cavalry regiment passing through 3 MAZDARAN .. 18 m. General direction (2,800 / ). ENE.

Keep along the left bank, passing Robat Mahi on the left at 5 miles (in ruins), until 11 miles. Turn NNE. up a slight slope which gets steeper but is still easy, until Mazda- ran is reached at 18 miles, 1 mile short of the top of the pass. One hundred houses. Road as before ; more stones and gravel after leaving the river. Passable for all arms up to Mazdaran village. Camping ground .—There is a good camping ground for a brigade on open ground SE. of the village. Water .—Good and abundant. Supplies .—As in former stages.194 Boute No. IX — contd. 4 SHURRUKH .. 16 m. General direction N by E. Reach crest 79 of Mazdaran Pass (S^SO'). Ascent stony but not difficult ; gradients on both sides easy. It is a good camel road, and with slight improve ment practicable for field artillery. No great obstacles to the construction of a good cart road. With the exception of this pass and that crossed by Route No. VIII(l), the Kara Dagh range is very precipitous and difficult. There are several watch towers on the crest of the pass. From this point the track runs NNE. for 2 miles, along a saddle, which connects the Mazdaran range with the Kuh-i-Chashemeh-Zarchubeh range to the N. The latter range is crossed at the Kotal-i-Du- Biradar (or Gardaneh-i-Du-Biradar), which is seven hundred feet higher than the Mazdaran pass, and is marked by two Turkoman towers. Here the track descends in a north-north easterly direction, bottom of the descent is reached in the Tash Sang Nala, 2,750 feet, whence the road is quite easy to Shurrukh. The Mazangan Nala comes in on the left. No village at Shurrukh merely a halting place near some rough reservoirs made by shepherds. There is an important track from here running NW. to Chehcheh (Route No. VIII (m), stage 2) via Mazangan, a village with abundant water, total distance between 30 and 40 miles. Note. —From the Mazdaran pass a good muletrack, fit for lightly laden camels leads, KSE., to Shurijah, or Senpanja, on the right bank of the Kashaf End, 27 miles by the following route E. to a saddle at mile 2, elevations,6 00 feet, thence descend the northern slopes of the Mazdaran range to Inja Bulak, at 7J miles, a substantial village, deserted during the summer, elevation 2,900 feet; good and abundant water from karez and pond ; at 10i miles pass through a pro nounced cleft in a razor-backed ridge, which extends for about 10 miles along the centre of the valley between the Mazdaran range to the S. and the Kuh-i- Chashmeh-Zarchubeh to the N. Thence ENE. to a spring and nomad summer encamp .nent, at mile 13J, whence turn down the silavah valley, E^E., passing 'Jb a spring and nomad summer encampment 17£ miles. At mile 20J, Eadeh Ab spring and some 10 mud houses, occupied only in the summer.

Water. W hen the reservoirs are full there is enough water or 1,000 men and 300 horses. The flow of water from theRoute No. IX — contd. spring, which is slightly brackish , is very weak and little reliance can be placed on this supply. Fuel. —Abundant. 5 GUMBAZLl .. 14 m.

At 16 miles 111 Kanduklicanal with a good body of water from the river. Persian Sarakhs lies on the left bank of the Hari Rud, and about \ mile from it. It is a tumble down walled town, whose people and prosperity have departed to Russian Sarakhs. There are some 300 houses in the town and 200 houses in the villages around. Water from wells. Forage plentiful. There is a large fort with a small Persian garrison and telegraph office. A considerable amount of wheat is grown. From Sarakhs and its neighbour hood sufficient supplies for a brigade passing through can be obtained. Russian Sarakhs is on high ground on the oppo site bank. ALTERNATIVE ROUTE IX(A).

After leaving the mouth of the defile, troops of all arms could move easily across the open plain, v 7 hich is firm earth, gravel, few stones, and no sand. Water and camping ground are available at the 6th mile, where there is a spring and a stream affording about 600 gallons per hour. It runs about J mile and then disappears ; this same water crops up again at the 10th mile, where it affords about 1,000 gallons per hour and runs for about 200 yards ; it crops up again at the 12th mile, v 7 here it affords about 500 gallons per hour and runs for about 100 yards. Good camping ground for a force of any size anyw r here between 10th and 12th mile, near any of these springs. Water is said never to dry up in this place, the Dehaneh-i-Chakudar. Water .-—There are 6 wells at Chah Haji Ramzan ; the water is found in an open shallow trough-like valley or depression about -} mile long. The bottom of the valley is about 40 feet below r the hills on each side of it. Water at 25 feet to 30 feet below the surface of the ground.

Road runs in a north- north-easterly direc- 53 tion. At 2 miles strike the main Sarakhs road, which is a clearly marked track, running across open , undulating grassy plain with good going earth and gravel soil, probably dry and dusty in summer. At 2 miles change direction NE. by N. and again at the 10th mile change to NE. At 18th mile arrive at the furthest edge of the ground cultivated by irrigation from the Hari Rud river. From here onward there is occasional cultivation, flat open country with a firm earth soil. At 24 miles cross a canal by a pakka bridge, and at 24| miles another by a kacha bridge. It is better to ford these two canals, which are usually only about 2 feet deep, than to trust to the bridges. Guns could cross the fords but not the bridges. Change direction N. At 25 miles Karbalal Lutf’Ali on the left, 20 houses. At 25J miles Asafabad on the left, 25 houses. At 28 miles reach Persian Sarakhs. There is no water or camping-ground on this stage until irrigated country is reached. When the canals are reached there is ample water and open space to camp in. Supplies en route none.

The distance could be shortened by a tew miles by not following the river so closely. R 0 ad (1) Unmade and unmetalled throughout. Suitable for camels throughout. A fair-weather motor road could be made from Meshed to Sadrabad. Field artillery and rough two- wheeled country carts could pass with some difficulty on account of the roughness and steepness of the track m stage o, unless the Kashaf Rud is in high flood, which is unusual except in April and May, and not always then. In this case the usual track is often covered with deep mud and water and horses or camels take precarious tracks along the face of the hill to avoid the floods (2) Unmade and unmetalled throughout. Suitable for all arms throughout ; the only obstacles are the irrigation canals, especially in stage 8 . These might delay, but would not stop wheeled vehicles. The road crosses a pass of 3,600 feet in stage 5, but it does not offer any great obstacle. The Kashaf Rud is hard to cross except at the recognised fords, on account of its deep banks and muddv bottom. There are numerous good fords unless the river is swollen with heavy rains in the spiing time, or, ess frequently, after unusual rain at other seasons.

Leave Ark jg gate and the new (1914) road outside the city to the Pain Khiaban gate and follow main route by the right bank of the Eashaf Pud 'which is struck at Kila Ulang at 11 miles, and at 15 miles cross to the left bank by the ford, immediately below the ruins of the Kuzghun. The river here is like a ditch, and has steep banks and a trea cherous muddy bottom, except at fords which are fairly nu merous when the river is low. In May, 1906 when Smyth visited it, the river was unfordable except by a strong horse. For supplies and camping grounds at this stage, see stage 1 Route No. IX, which also applies. 2 NAZARlA .. 11m. General direction ESE. The road is a 20 well-defined, un metalled cart-road of good, firm earth with not many stones and no gradients. It does not follow the windings of the river, but heads straight from the ford to Nazaria. At 1| miles pass the village of Chulghi on the right bank, 35 families, Sistanis and Meshedis. At 6 miles village of Kara Bugha, where there is a ford to the right bank (30 yards wide, 2 feet deep, current 4 miles an hour, March 27th 1914). As Nazaria is approached the Meshed valley narrows down, and at the village is 2 miles wide. Supplies, camping-grounds, etc., as in the last stage. 3 SARSARl .. 28 m. General direction ESE. Road runs E. for 1 mile and 54200 Koute No. IX — contd. then turns ESE. Then over some low rolling hills and undu lating hilly country out of sight of river, from £ miles to 1 | miles from it and 50 feet to 100 feet above it, until the village of Gim- zard is reached at 6 miles. (A camel-track runs from Nazaria, within f mile of the river, past the village of Shadichah Bala, at 4J miles, 20 houses, to Shadichah Pain, 6 miles where there is a ford, 20 yards wide 2% feet deep, current 4 miles an hour, March 28th 1914, to the right bank and the village of Kalateh-i-Mirza Jan). Between Nazaria and Gimzard there are several more large villages along the river bank, but they are not passed by this route, which does not come near the river in these 6 miles. After leaving Gimzard the country slowly becomes less culti vated and loses its open appearance. The hills become steeper and higher, and the valley gradually closes in. At 9 miles pass village of Siah Bala on other side of the river, 50 houses. At 14 miles Kiohidar, also on the other side of the river, 80 houses. Here the valley is about 1 mile broad. Still following the left bank of the river, at 19 miles pass Isma’Ilabad, 100 houses, on the other side of the river, and at 19 miles Robat Mahi in ruins on the near bank. At 28 miles reach Sarsari, 50 houses. Water .—Salty and scarcely drinkable, but is fit for animals. Fuel .—More plentiful. Fodder .—Fairly good grazing for camels and horses. Supplies .—Less than in then preceding stage. In normal seasons with a day or two’s notice, supplies sufficient for a cavalry regiment or infantry battalion, with transport passing through could be procured. 4 AK D ARB AND 21m. General direction. E. by S. The road fol- lows the river, keep ing more or less along its bank, with occasional short-cuts, but never leaving the river’s edge for more than J mile. The road is of firm earth, with not many stones, and is only passable for camels if the river is high. If, however, the river is low (at times it almost dries up) field guns could be taken by using the river bed where the path along the hill side becomes too narrow. The river valley is from J to J mile broad, and the201 XOJ-' and un|. tollmik age of Gi' an Xazana, ichih Bali, re therein ionr, Marti iteh-i-Mira veral mort : passed Ij ese 6 milts, s less cri me steep: ) miles pass looses, is , 80 hoosft miles pas ver, andal \t 28 mile for animal;, es.

It is densely overgrown with tamarisk and other brushwood, with under growth of camel-thorn. The river valley is enclosed by hills on either side, generally steep, but with occasional slopes. These hills have other hills behind ohem rising to thousands of feet. Crosses Route No. IX(a) about here. The road passes the village of Baghbaghu at 6 miles, where there are 80 houses and a telegraph office. It lies on the other side of the river. At 7 miles Haji Muhammad Husain, 20 houses, on the near side of the river. At 8 miles Husainabad also on the near side, 25 houses ; and at 10 miles Akkutab on the other side, 30 houses. Ak Darband on the bank of the Kashaf Rud is reached at 21 miles. The ruined village of that name is on the other side of the river. It is deserted except by nomads. Throughout the route the water-supply is abundant from the river, and though distinctly brackish, it is drinkable. Fresh water from springs and hauzes can generally be reckoned on at the villages. A small party of a squadron or a company could get ordinary supplies at the small villages en route, unless the season was bad. Ak Darband would be a suitable position for a force wishing to oppose or delay the advance of a hostile force on Meshed from Pul-i-Khatun, via the Kashaf Rud, as the Kashaf Darband runs through difficult defiles. A force at Ak Darband Rud bebw Ak could with advantage oppose the debouchment of a hostile force from the defiles below Ak Darband, or its passage across the hills ; while the defender’s retreat up the Kashaf Rud would be easy, especially if the Mazdaran pass were bed to prevent the risk of the retreat of the Ak Darband defenders being cut off by hostile troops advancing from Sarakh- or Nauruzabad by that pass, vide Route IX. Camping ground —For a brigade at least. Ample for any force likely to pass here. Fiel. —Ample. Fodder .—Being good camel grazing. At any season except winte’, this grazing would suffice for the camel grazing of a brigale. Fair grass grazing on the slopes of the hills. Sipplies. — Nil. Nomads, Timuris and Baluchis owning large flocks of sheep are generally in the neighbourhood, so that,Route No. IX — contd. although there are no regular supplies, a Cossack, Turkoman, or Afghan regiment would probably find ample supplies for themselves and grazing for their horses. 5 SADRABAD .. 23 m. General direction SE. (Pul-i-Khatun). Ascend from the 98 Kashaf Rud from an elevation of about 2,000 feet for 2 miles in an east-south-east erly direction. The direction then changes to E. and the ascent continues to 3 miles. Slopes easy and passable by guns- At 3 miles the top of the kutal is reached, and is crossed with ease, at an elevation of 3,600 feet. Then descend by easy grades across stony hills with occasional bits of rolling down, and with steep, rocky hills scattered about in a confused way on both sides. At 9 miles reach the river down a stony valley. Then E. along the river valley to the ruins of Kila-i-Shurijah at 10 miles, about 1,800 feet deserted except by Timuri nomads. ENE. from the valley of the Kashaf Rud to an easy kutal at 11 miles. Here a road to Nauruzabad, stage 7, branshes off, as does the telegraph line from Meshed to Sarakhs. This is an ordinarily rough track and seems passable for field gunj. Des cend E. by S. with steep country on the right and open on the left, to a shallow, low lake, about \ mile long and 203 yards broad. Then ascend after leaving the lake on the left E. by S., to a slight kutal at 15 miles, ascent easy. Road thm runs E. by easy, well-defined track down valley, with rolling hills on the left, and precipitous rocks rising sheer over 100 feet on the right. At 19£ miles reach the river again opposite the village of Pishkaurar at an elevation of about 1,650 feet. Hsre the road from Pishkaurar, Zulfikar, Zurabad, etc., cuts in br a ford usually easily passable for all arms, with a gravel lottom. Route No. H(q). In May 1906, however, it was impassable except by a strong horse, as the river was about 4 feet deep and running at 6 miles an hour. Ascent from the river E. byS. to 1,800 feet at 20| miles. Thence gradual descent SE. ova- the hills on the left bank of the Kashaf Rud, overlooking the 'iver. Fairly easy slopes, gradient not more than 1 in 6 anywhere.

Sadrabad is situated at the junction of the Ka sJ ia Rud and the Hari Rud, on the left bank of either river. The Pul-i-Khatun is a bridge over the Hari Rud and is on the far- f, ., Kashaf Rud. It is a stone bridge of 5 arches, pass a We for all aims The Kashaf Rud in May 1906 was 60 yards wide and over 2 feet deep at the ford, with a current run- Jincr at some 7 miles an hour, making crossing on horseback , JL. impossible. Usually the ford is easily crossed by men, animals, and carts, but there are said to be large boulders in the river bed, which are dangerous at any time, and make e f rrl imnassable when the river is in flood. Supplies for one Indian 11 c^aRyRegiment can be obtained at 2 or 3 days’ notice SoepJ in a bad season.

During the dry season this water, which re-appears in the bed of the Hari Rud in the shape of springs, forms the main supply of water which goes to both Persian and Russian Sarakhs. There is a standing dispute on this account between the Russians and Persians. Recently a com mission of officers of the Persian and the Soviet Governments decided the frontier water question. At Kalat and Darajaz the inhabitants of the two countries were to receive equal halves of the supply while at Sarakhs the Russians were to be given a little over an exact half. The decision of the commission was committed to a written agreement which, perhaps, would re quire ratification by the two Governments.

Russian side as before. The road is passable for all arms but, although it keeps at from J to 2 miles from the river to avoid the swampy cultivation, ditches, etc., near the river, guns and carts would have trouble in passing the numerous irrigation canals, which have often 2 feet of water, with steep banks and foot bridges only. At 7 miles Daulatabad, 80 houses of Sistanis who in 1890, owned 30 yoke of oxen and 30 ploughs. Opposite here on the Russian side is the Kizil Kia cliff, beneath which is the head of the highest Russian canal. The nature of the bank precludes their cutting canals higher up.

NASRATABAD (SISTAN) to LASH JUWAIN. E. P. Cordon, 1918. M. A. Meshed, 1927. (1) Nasratabad, Qasimabad, Maliki, Siadak, Dost Muham mad, Kila-i-Kang-Shand, Lash Jmvain. 80 miles. Description. —From Nasratabad to Qasimabad the track passes through several water channels all of which are bridged with narrow wooden bridges which require strengthening. The water channels vary from 6 to 12 feet in width and contain from 2 to 3 feet of water. The surface as far as Qasimabad, a distance of 10 miles, is hard pat and suitable for wheeled traffic. After leaving Qasimabad the track winds round various ‘Hard ground underneath Sa “ d duneS * and through thick tama- could be kept clear by risk jungle for a distance of about gang - 6 miles. About 2 miles from Qasimab»d the track crosses the Rud-i- Pariun by the ford Guzar-i-Mahki.

Description .—The track leaves Nasratabad in a north easterly direction and affords no difficulties for camel transport as far as Bulai (10 miles). v At the 11th mile a strong Bund running N. and S. has been erected to protect the land from inundation. From the Bund to Jalalabad a distance of about 4 miles the low lying country which at present is dry, becomes inundated by the flood necessitating the use of tutins. After leaving Jalalabad the track runs in a northernly direc tion along the left bank of the Rud-i-Pariun, which it crosses by the ford Guzar-Kundil or Gurgali. Between Jalalabad and Pulgi there are at present 3 main shilas of the Panun 100 yards, 40 yards and 150 yards in width respectively. These shilas are about 1| miles apart and sepa rated by a track of tamarisk jungle. The shilas near Jalalabad and Pulgi are said to contain about 10 feet of water when in ^°° d ai l d can . on ! y be crosse d by means of tutins. When the Rudi-i-Pan.H is m flood the extent of the inundated portion ot the track is said to be 7 miles. After crossing the Rud-i-Parian the track passes through Deh Haji and affords no difficulties until Takht-i-Shah is reached. krom Takht-i-Shah the track crosses the Shila-i-Mish Kushi and runs to the Is E. of Tappeh-i-Kharan through Salian and Pishawaran to Lash Juwain. From Takht-i-Shah to Salian the country at present is quite dry, but in the flood season the shilas has to be crossed in tutins. r 5P° r f e d, that the above is the only suitable road across the Isaizar for laden camels.

From Pulgi the track passes in a northernly direction through m Deh Jangi to Deh Surkh and thence Hamun ' crosses the Hamun* by the Rah-i- Shila-i-Deh Nau. * This is a shorter Route than Route 2 but is subject to heavier inundations and therefore not favoured by caravans. (4) Nasratabad, Adimi, Deh Kuch, Koshabad, Laftan, Lash Juwain. Distance 56 miles. It is understood that this route is used by tutins, when the Hamun is in heavy flood. The route would be impossible during the period of high winds, so is hardly worth considering. (5) Nasratabad, Afzalabad, Dashtak, Lab-i-Baring, Kharika Chaka Chaku spring, Gudar-i-Gabrak, Laftan, Lash Juwain. Distance 96 miles. This is the main route from Nasratabad to Neh via Lab-i- Baring as far as which place a motor road has been constructed. At the present time this is the only route practicable for mechanical transport, but when the Hamun is in flood it would be impossible for motors to travel from Nasratabad to Lab-i- Baring, although feasible as far as Afzalabad and from Mil-i- Nadir to Lab-i-Baring. During the season of the Hamun flood the intervening portion between Afzalabad and Mil-i-Nadir would have to be traversed on tutins (from 16 to 20 miles). It is understood that, the. route from Lab-i-Baring to Lash Juwain is perfectly feasible for mechanical transport, that track almost the whole way passing over “ Dasht,” which makes a hard and uncorrugated surface. With the exception of the Rud-i-Dumag there appears to be no rivers, which would present any difficulties. (6) Nasratabad, Rahdar, Ziarat-i-Khwaja, Musa, Rah-i- Chashmakeh, Lurg-i-Gaz-i-Julleh, Lurg-i-Gamshad, Kulah-i- Khan. (Distance 55 miles.) This is the shortest and most direct route to Lash Juwain, but is only used when the Naizar is dry or the water very low. The chief objection to this track is the thickness of the reeds, which have to be cut before traversing. This makes the route impassable for tutins.242 Route No. 11(a)— contd. From the above description it would appear that in the dry season the most suitable routes are routes 2, 3 and 6 and when the Hamun is in flood routes 2 and 5. For purposes of military transport it is probable that route 5 is preferable to any other route although considerably longer. It it? undoubtedly an advantage to have only one shipment by tutins instead of two which is the case by all routes except No. 5. ^ If mechanical transport was available at Lab-i-Baring it is highly probable that with a detachment of Pioneers a suitable motor track could be constructed to Lash Juwain. It is impos sible to pass an opinion as to the possibilities of the navigation of the water routes across the Hamun until the arrival of the flood. The high wind, which blows throughout the hot weather in Sistan would probably debar an extensive use of tutins for the conveyance of military stores. It might be feasible to utilise flat-bottomed boats or boats with a draught of not more than two feet, propelled by petrol motors, with air or shallow draught propellers. During 1918 steel pontoon punts were obtained from India by the General Officer Commanding the late Sistan Field Force for transporting supplies and personnel when the Hamun was in flood. However these were not used and were, on the with drawal of forces from East Persia, back-loaded to India SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES on the ROUTES from NASRATIBAD, ETC., to LASH JUWAIX qt T1 U sh , orte $ U? w most frequented, is Sistan, Deh Shaitan Gazbar, Kohlak, Shaikh Vaisi, Tappeh-i-Kharan, and thence to Sahan in Afghanistan. Between Sistan and Gazbar there are only jus, the bridges of which require attention. From Gazbar to Shaikh Vaisi it +L° r • 8 enerall y requiring tutins. At Sheikh Vaisi there is a broad stream (“ rud ”), now only 2 feet deep but generally about 12 feet deep. From Shaikh Vaisi to Deh Sadullah (about 2 miles) there is a ridge of land which is generally dry. From Deh Sadullah to Salifn (in Afghanistan) it is Naizar again which is dry in the hot season.Route No. 11(a)— contd . (2) A road, which remains passable longer than the Gazbar road, is Sistan, Bunjar, Deh Arbab, Burji Afghan, Bulai, Jalala bad, Majdak, Tappeh-i-Khamak, Kurki, Tappeh-i-Kharan and thence to Salian. From Sistan to Bulai the road is easy if bridges over the jus are kept in repair. In flood times •Tutins some years start tutins* are used between Bulai and SgVS.iSriSS 1 ,”* 4 Majdak and again between Kurki, Tappeh-i-Kharan and Salian. There is a “ rud ” between Jalalabad and Majdak generally flowing, but at present dry. . ' , ,, (3) A longer route lasting later into the flood season than (1) and (2) is Sistan, Bunjar, Qasimabad, Malaki, Burj-i-Mirgul, Dab Ghurguri, Takht-i-Shah, Shalghami, Mishkushi stream to either Salian or Zahak. This route also is difficult in times of fl0 °The Mishkushi stream at present is 6 feet deep and 2 miles broad. It is deepest in normal years during March, April and Ma T 4) T he easiest road in flood time is Sistan, Bunjar, Qasim- abad, Malaki, Siadak, Deh Dost Muhammad, thence to Tappeh- i-Sikhsar or Kila-i-Kang in Afghanistan—across the Aslikmak to Chakhansur, and then after crossing Khar Rud (now dry) along the edge of Hamun-i-Puzak direct to Lash Juwam. At present the Ashkinak is dry, but m the flood season (March to May) it is under water for 8 miles of the road. Ridden horses can then wade through it, but camels loads must be crossed in tutins. , In dry seasons the Afghans go from Tappeh-i-Sikhsar along the frontier, i.e., via Tappeh-i-Shahiraki, Tappeh-i-Kurki and Shalghami across Mishkushi to bahan. . . , (5) A route, rarely used on account of its length, is ^istan Labi-i-Baring. Kharika, Ziarat Khwaja, Saban, round t re Hamun and Sabari, across Rud Harut to Lash Juwam. In low water seasons there is any easy driving road over turf below the Hamun cliffs. In flood seasons the road above the cliffs would take a good deal of making, &amp;nda f h ^l er ™^ could probably be made from Hauz-i-ISadiri via Gkah Mago, Lapai Nalo, Rud-i-Harut and Dargo Samur This crosses a “ dasht ” and avoids nalas.

General observations on the valley of the Hari Bud. (Condie- Stephens, about 1885.) Prom Kafir Kila the river runs in a northerly direction along an uninhabited but fertile valley, piercing the Jam and Siah Babak ranges through a gorge known by the name of Tang-i-Daria. This gorge is exceedingly narrow in parts, and is impassable for all arms, except in the late summer, when a few horsemen might, by crossing and re-crossing the shallows, force their way through the thick brushwood and jungle. On the right bank, from the Siah Babak range northward, the ground is high and undulating as far as Daulatabad, where the undulations of ground finally subside into the desert. On the left bank, after the Jam mountains are crossed, the ground is flatter than on the right, there being a tract of open fertile land near the river, and another further on ; the stream winds west ward round the foot of a high range till it reaches Pul-i-Khatun. whence, after running eastward for a few miles, it again flows northward in a widening valley to Sarakhs. Between Kuhsan and Nauruzabad (18 miles S. of Sarakhs) the country on both sides of the stream is uninhabited, except at two spots, Muhsi- nabad and Zurabad. Portions of the valley abound in natural pasturage, and the land near the banks between Toman Agha and Tang-i-Daria, and between Pul-i-Khatun and Sarakhs might easily be irrigated. Rainfall is said to be small. UsualRoute No. II(m)— contd. rainy seasons are November, April, and beginning of May, River water wholesome, but somewhat muddy in winter and spring. To the W. of the river there are three passes in the Jam hills, viz., Bani Tak, Istui and Yaki Tut. Of these the second, though a mere pathway, is the best. On the E. eight separate roads and pathways cross the Siah Bubak range (Barkhut mountains). The Khumbau Pass is the easiest, and is said to be fit for light carts. There is a good cart-road down the right (Russian) bank of the Hari Rud to Sarakhs, passing through Pul-i-Khatun. Supplies—Xiong both banks of the river from Toman Agha to Pul-i-Khatun and from Nauruzabad to Sarakhs, as well as in the defiles of the mountains, there are plentiful supplies of fuel. Grass abundant in places. The supply of water in the mountain springs is small, but sufficient to water small detach ments of cavalry. The total resources in provisions of the three inhabited towns in the neighbourhood of the Hari Rud are as follows:— — Quarters of wheat. Sheep. Oxen, cows, and goats. Karez .... 600 3,000 30 Muhsinabad 2,250 7,000 1,000 Zurabad .... 7,500 2,000 400 (It is improbable that Zurabad can now furnish this amount.) No. of stage and total distance.

The road runs § mile down the Jam and then for 7 miles through a valley with the old bed of a river in the centre, intersected by many nalas. It then crosses two ridges running SE. to NW. The second ridge is difficult even for pack animals. The path then winds through a labyrinth of hills and ridges. At 8 miles there is the spring of Gala Chashmeh with brackish water, a little off the road.

Turn off to W. and arrive in camp 25 minutes later. Kila-i-Karau is a small village of about twenty-five houses. Milk and lucerne procurable ; very little at Chashmeh Timuri. This pass over the Pishkamar range is generally known by the name Burj-i- Khuda Bakhsh. It presents no difficulty worth mentioning to construction of a road or railway. There is a direct toad to it from Pul-i-Khatun, known as the Shurab route, because it passes through the Shurab plain above-mentioned. Sykes makes Pul-i-Khatun to Zurabad 32 miles, or 2 miles less than these stages. He remarks that field guns could be got over the pass, but with difficulty. 9 ZURAbAD .. 14 m.

About the Karau nala are a number of Nurzai shepherds from Herat In all there are about 400 famihes scattered between Zurab’ad, Bakharz and Khaf. People of Zurabad are called Urcmnils. Zurabad was once a large place, but is now in a state of decay. It lies in a fertile valley in which there are numerous268 Route No. II(q)— contd. villages, but supplies are scanty, as the nomads are bad cu ivators. Water is abundant, said to be very unhealthy ; fuel and forage obtainable. There are about 100 families in e vi age. The lands are irrigated by a canal from a stream which rises about 1 farsakh to the south-west, and joins the Hari Kud at Khwaja Sahm-ud-Din. It contains little water. The ura ad plain is capable of furnishing a large quantity of supp les of wheat, barley, lucerne, if it were properly cultivated.

It has 12 yoke of oxen and supplies of wheat, barley and lucerne are procurable in considerable quantities. The Jam river is then crossed. It is liable to be impassable in spring, which is the flood time, but subsides a few hours after the cessation of rain. The banks are low and the crossing at other times quite easy. In wet weather the last 4 miles of the road are very heavy, otherwise it is good and hard. Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam is stage 23 of route II. Note. —Captain Smyth, 1902, gives the following alternative stages between Zurabad and Turbat:—Shahnissan (or Bani Tak), 17 miles, Chashmeh-i-Gul 24 miles ; Turbat 10. Total 51. Suitable for camels throughout. Stage 1; good hill track ; suitable for camels. Plenty of water at stage ; supplies scanty. Stage 2 ; good for camels, but impassable for carts owing to the Mintug Pass, elevation 3,750 feet. Water supply in this stage very unreliable, though it is abundant at Chashmeh-i-Gul. Stage 3 ; passable for carts. This would make Pul-i-Kliatun to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam 85 miles in 5 stages. ALTERNATIVE ROUTE.

It is supposed to have been dry for some time. Thence (a) a track leads W. up a deep canon on the wide Rigavak valley. There are pools of undrinkable salt water along this water course.283 Route No. 111(f)— contd. At 4 miles the Turshab valley enters from the S. and at 11 miles when the direction is NW. is the confluence of the Mazurak vallev from the N. One route to Chah Bidu follows this branch valley in which lies Mazurak Chah (said to be hard to find not visited). At about 12| miles a nala runs N. to good water at Chah Sahib Dad. From here to (i) Chah Bidu is about 14 miles NW. (not visited), (ii) Koh-i-Lunka is about 32 miles W. via either Kura Chah or Dana Tuzgi (pass) in the Tuzgi range. (&amp;) From Chdh-i-Haibo up the, Turshdb valley. This \ alley enters the Rigavak Canon at 4 miles and 3 miles SW. of this point is lower Turshab (marked Turshab on 30-B) on S. side of nala. Plenty of good water flowing in a deep channel, but rather hard to reach ; 2f miles further is Turshab (marked Zt-i- Sultan on 30-B) at N. end of small Turshab plain. M ater sufficient in July for 1 troop cavalry from water holes (1 of sweet and 2 of slightly salt water). All around are high rocky mountains. A route leads N. to Chah Sahib Dad at 6 miles ; 51 miles to S. is Bijaraji a water hole with very good water. The route (i) to Chah Fulad is about 24 miles long. The track-surface very good, at first has a general direction is NW. for 4 miles then SSW. for 1|. The direction is changed to W. at this point, where there are two conspicuous hills (1 black and 1 white) to N. of road, while to S. at 1 mile is a water hole 4 feet deep, and \ mile further S. is Gamih Chah at the head of a sandy valley. Direction now W. for 3* miles where, at edge of main hills and to N. of road is a conspicuous white hill with a red top. From here to Chah Fulad is 15 miles—good going no water en route. (This route—Chah Allah Dad—Turshab Chah. Fulad is the usual caravan route from Sistan to Kerman via Sipi). From this “ Red cap hill ” a route leads S. to Gorandi Chah (13 miles) through low hills. (ii) From Tnrshab to Chahuk is 6 miles, good going, bbVV., first crossing to S. end of Turshab Plain Chahuk is at the iunction of 4 nalas and has two wells of slightly salt vater. Maldars live here permanently. The W. nala leads to Chah Fulad 17 miles W. and Garagheh 21 miles SW.

Baluchab is off the main route and water course and has a suitable site for a camp SW. of a high red hill—a conspicuous landmark on the route from Girdi. The water is 1 mile away from this camp up a narrow nala. There is a direct hill track to Gorandi but impassable for animals. The ordinary route leaves Baluchab, -over very undulating ground and descends into the main water course. Direction WNW. to Kila-i-Nadiri (ruins) W. of which on the hill side is said to be a spring of water. After passing through a narrow defile (which can be circumvented) at 31- miles, the route changes direction to SW., later to S., and again to SW. up the wide riverbed. At 9 miles 1,000 feet W. of the road is Chakul (vide 1-6 (in)) and at this point routes join from Turshab, Chahuk, and Jauri all from the Chahuk Valley running NNE. At 13 miles is Malik Siah Kuh Ziarat, a wayside grave marking the point of entry of the route from Rah Du Chahi vid Jushak Spr, which latter is 2J miles ESE., flanked by stony nalas, and reached with difficulty up a nala branching from the route to Rah Du Chahi. VY ater from a small fall and pools 1£ miles N. of the Ziarat up a difficult nala is Qasuri (or Jush) two wells of sweet water. Thence a pass leads to Chahuk over a steep and difficult pass. After passing over the Wad-i- Gorandi and starting to descend into the Lera Dik plain, Gorandi is reached at 16 miles. The camp is at the mouth of a nala rising due S. to the water at 1J miles. There is a second site for a small camp 1 mile up the nala. Water from a sweet but not very copious spring. From the low hills about the camp heliograph communication is obtainable with Dehani Baghi at a bearing of 270. From Gorandi to Chahuk there are four routes, (a) ‘ W. route ’ steep and difficult for animals, distance 10 miles, (6) ‘ E. route ’ follows a nala starting from Ziarat Malik Siah Kuh. At 7 miles pass to W. of 2 conspicuous white mountains (vide 1-6 (ii)) this route is difficult for animals. Distance about 9 miles. Vid Qasuri—a very difficult route—distance 9 miles (see nore on Qasuri in 3). (d) the Chakul route—distance 14 miles. First to Chakul 7 miles, then up Chakul valley for 6 miles, then W. to Chahuk through the Bijarab nala (vide 1-6 (in) and 2-6).

(a) From Hurmuk to Baluchab. —Route (i). Goes along the E. slopes of the hills and crosses many nalas. It is difficult for loaded camels. The distance is 24 miles—the route, generally speaking, following the telegraph line. The journey can be broken at Lavariab (at 10 miles) where there are some black tents besides a small perennial stream, (for Baluchab vide 1-3). Route (ii) is a track through low hills parallel to (i) a series of nalas and is very bad for transport. At 5 miles are two springs (|- mile apart) at Padagi and at 9 miles Lavariab. Thence 12 difficult miles to Baluchab through hills (vide Routes Nos. III(&amp;) and 111(c)). (b) From Hurmuk to Bah Du Chdhi.—This is a rough path (only partially traversed from the Chahuk end, and distance not known definitely) up the Nagat Rud and gorge', and is not passable for animals, the quite impassable point being said to be 10 miles from Chahuk. For 6 miles before Chahuk the water course is between high perpendicular rock walls, with poolsRoute No. 111(f)— contd. of water at intervals for the whole length. All these are salt except the few highest (near Chahuk). The surface of the route here is only difficult in places. At 1 mile from Chahuk a nala runs N. to Robat. At Chahuk there is a small hole of good water, and a few inhabitants (6 in July 1919) living in huts built into the hillside. The route continues up the Nagat Rud general direction S. and after 2 miles a nala enters from the NW. 500 feet E. of this point is Du Chahi a hole of sweet water. From here, route turns up the branch nala (direction bearing 290°) going fair. After IJ miles the pass is reached and thence 4 miles down a nala at bearing 305° to Rah Du Chahi in an open gorge. This road * is good—difficult for laden camels at only 1 spot and trottable in places. At Rah Du Chahi are two wells 1| miles apart with good and plentiful water. Here in July 1916 were 7 black tents and maldars with flocks. A camp would be best placed at the northern well. From here to Garagheh is 14 miles good going over the plain. 2. From Jushak to Rah Du Ghdhi .—Road runs S. for 6 miles up stony waterless, course then 1 hour up a very high, steep, and stony ravine. After another 30 minutes is Robat, a spring in a rocky pass 1,000 feet E. of the road. This route is very difficult for animals, especially when taken from N. to S. (Robat is at the N. end of the main watershed of this system of hill, Du Chahi being at the S.). There is a route from here down a branch of the Nagat Rud to Chahuk (4£ miles). To Rah Du Chahi is 2|- miles—direction SW. down nala. 3. From Gorandi to Kundi, (i) via Lera Dik. —Route descends SW. towards Garagheh for 1| miles, and there circles ro und to S.

At 5J miles there were two hauzes full to the right of road. To the left of the road at a distance of approximately 3 to 4 miles there is a range of big hills which run from 7| miles till the road reaches Afriz at 14 miles. At 8 miles there is a hauz to the right. From 10 miles to 11J miles road winds through low range of gravel hills running from E. to W. From 11J miles to 14 miles road runs down a gentle slope. From Chahak to Afriz there would be no difficulties for motor cars. Up to 9 miles the surface alternately is pat and hard gravel and from 9 to 14 miles is entirely gravel. After leaving Afriz the road goes up a gentle slope for a mile and then crosses a very steep spur; gradient 1 in 10 which could be avoided by taking the motor road round the foot of the spur. On leaving the low foothills on far side of spur the road runs for 6 miles up a steady rise across a stony plain till it reaches a range of high hills where it enters a Jiala, At 22^ miles ? i.e., I mile up nala is Kalateh Chahak and a mile and a half further up is Kalateh Sar-i-ab. From entrance of nala to end of stage it is impassable for motor cars and would re quire very heavy construction work. In its present state it is even difficult for camels. From Afriz to entrance of nala very little construction work required for motor road. Kalateh Sartab has about 50 houses and a ^ flock of _ 200 to 300 sheep. Sides of nala between here and Kalateh Chahak are terraced with barley, fruit trees and vines. Water. —From a small stream, yield £ gallon per second.

Gradient for last l mile to top of pass 1 in 8. Horses had great difficulty in getting up. On the further side of the pass the downward gradient is more severe. This steep gradient lasts for about half a mile, after which the road S^es down mila beds at a much gentler gradient. From Kalateh Chahak in stage 1 to where the path meets the pre sent motor road Birjand-Kain (in stage 2) at a distance of £ mile on the Rum side of Kalateh Kunuk a motor road could be constructed with heavy work if skilled engineer labour could be obtained to cut down the gradients on the f mile of road containing the summit of the pass. ^ ^ miles from bar-i-ab the road, still in neila bed among e ^dls, passes a small village Kalateh Baringa and half a mile further on joins main road above Kalateh Kunuk. From here e main road runs down a gradually widening nala passing two small villages with abundant water supply from small streams yielding approximately £ gallon per second. At 9 miles road leaves hills and crosses a broad plain wdth hills running parallel to right of road at a distance varying from ^r. ° \ ^ rom At 11 miles there is a rainwater hauz at presen alf full. At 13 miles there is another rainw r ater hauz at present empty. To stage 2 the pass would offer a very gooc position for delaying action. The approaches to it on eitiier side would offer great advantage to defence. The hills long which the pass goes would be passable to infantry out cavarry dismounted would have great difficulty in getting their horses over the hills. 66337 Route No. V (b)— contd. 4 TABAS (W) .. 16 m.

Supplies are scarce and totally inadequate to meet the supply of anything beyond the few caravans and solitary travellers who pass this way. The road, though unfit in its present state in a few places for guns, is a good one, and though it crosses several mountain ranges, the ascents and descents are so gentle that they form no serious obstacles, if the passes E. of Duzai and N. of Chah Pali be excepted. The greater part of the road now runs over open gravel plains or ■along glacis like slopes, formed of the same materials which connect the hills with the kavir. To the S. the Dasht-i-Kavir stretches away for miles, and though I examined it with the greatest care and questioned many natives in the hope of finding routes across it, there were only two that I saw or heard of— the route from Yazd to Damghan via Jandak, and the road I crossed N. of Chashmeh Dubur, which was said to run direct from Anarak to Meshed. The country to the N. of my route between Samnan and the Kuh-i-Taurab contains, I believe, at least one parallel route and several large towns, which are not shown on existing maps. For instance, Khar to the N. of Riza is said to be a place of about 1,000 houses, and a centre of desert communications. During the months of June, July and August the heat on this route is excessive. March, April and May are the best months for movements, when the climate is milder and the water supply considerably larger. A vast supply of it might be obtained by the construction of dams and shallow tanks, by which means shepherds maintain thousands of sheep for weeks together out in the desert during spring time, when grass herbage abound everywhere^except on the kavir itself.

At 9 miles Kishtak, with 90 houses situated on both sides of a narrow treeless valley. The main range is shown as Kuh-i-Kishtak on the 1910 map, pro bably from this village. Now-a-days it is termed Kuh-i-Rizi or Chal Dishkan. From this village there is a severe ascent up the side of the mountain. At 10| miles there was a small spring termed Chash- meh Gandum, at an altitude of 5,200 feet. The forest com menced at this point, but was (in 1912) being ruthlessly des troyed. Thenceforward the ascent is easy to the crest of the great ridge at 15 miles. Altitude 7,000 feet. A route from Khalateh-Khij mentioned in Route VI (6) (a), joins in from the left.

Then gradually descend, some 1,400 feet, into the Oghaz valley passing the villages of Usbeg at the 9th mile and Chapa at the 10th mile. The Oghaz valley or district contains six villages alto gether, and is a fertile and well cultivated spot. The nomad flock-owners all go across the border into Russian territory for the winter, paying a grazing tax of from 10 to 15 brans per 100 sheep.

The Jiristan Buluk, in which Milanlu is situated, contains 15 villages, with a total population ot some 400 Kurd families. One of the villages is named Alkhas. A second road from Hasan Kaleh to Milanlu leads direct over the hills, but said to be bad for laden mules, and the lower road taken in preference. Milanlu itself stands in an open upland and the climate is beautifully cool. There is a direct and well worn road from Milanlu to Askhabad. S ARAN I .. 12 m. General direction NVV. (4 900').

The rise from the village to the top of the kutal by aneroid is nearly 1,900 feet, making the heig ofthe kutal, known as the Yenikera in Turki, or Kharparanin Persian, 7,700 feet. The view from the top over the hills to the S. is very fine, but the view to the N. is stopped by anot ei paraUel range of greater height, called Chupan, said to now Form the Russian frontier in this direction Some distance to the E. is an open level upland valley, called Gulul, said to be well watered and fertile.

Whole of higher range and deep valley between the two ranges thickly wooded with small jumper and the hill well covered with grass. Descent on northern side of kutal runs down a long spur, and is very steep in places. Four miles down in bed of the nala, the ravine is entirely blocked by huge landslip of ancient date. The small lake formed thereby does not contain water for more than a month. The water gradually disappears underground, to appear again presumably m the form ot the springs at Sarani and other places, which form thi' Fnuzeh stream The climb over this landslip is very rough, and below it the valley is again blocked by a succession of other slips, making the final descent into Sarani very steep The village contams about 35 houses of Kurds and lies in a little basin at the head of defile leading down to Firuzeh. Descent down this defile very rapid.Route No. VII (a)—concld. Coningham gives height of Flruzeh as 2,294 feet, so there is probably an average fall of nearly 300 feet per mile. KHAIRABAD .. 8 m.

The fort above the village and the walls around it are now in ruins, and half the population has been moved to Muhammadabad further S. The village now contains about 100 houses. The kandts during the times of the Turkoman raids were allowed to fall into disrepair, and the people are now too poor to dig them out afresh, and the con sequence is that the gardens around are mostly dried up. Large quantities of unirrigated grapes are grown here and are turned into raisins.

There is no village of Maneh as marked in the map, the name applying to the district or valley in general, Gazabad is simply a name for some ground covered with low tamarisk opposite the ruins of an old village, named Zulmabad on the other side of the river.

A good deal of water is taken from it above Gazabad for irrigation at that place, where large tracts of land are now being ploughed up. Wheat and rice are the staple crops, and once the fear of the Yamuts is removed the area under cultivation will increase year by year. The probability is that a new village will shortly be built at Gazabad, as the people, once danger is removed, will soon get tired of coming all the way from Bash Kila to look after their crops, and thus the valley of the Atrak will be gradu ally re-populated. The number of old wells and water-channels show that the valley was well cultivated in olden days, and there is no reason that it should not be so again, unless indeed Russia steps in and prohibits further cultivation on the plea of there not being sufficient water for her subjects lower down. As it is, the whole valley from Kharaqi right down to Chat is said to be entirely uninhabited. Kharaqi itself consists at present of 30 families of Firuzagis from the 400 who were turned out of Firuzeh when it was handed over to the Russians. Much malarial fever at present, but as the ground is cleared, the fever will probably diminish. Atrak valley here about a mile in width, as a rule, perfectly level and with a rich soil. At present it is covered with low reeds, camel-thorn, thistles and weeds about 2 feet in height. On the S. a range of hills, known as the Bishum, runs parallel with the river some 2 miles back, and on the right bank a little below Kharaqi is a long high hill, called Buzdaghi. Both apparently sink lower and lower as they go W. Climate of valley warm. Hills on either side bare and brown, and country generally looks hot. Land at Kharaqi irrigated from spring in nala coming down from N., but water runs through a lot of thick reed heds, and is not good for drinking. From Kharaqi several well marked tracts lead on down valley, one, it is said, leads from Kharaqi to Anakarin (uninhabited), 4 farsakhs ; thence to Incha Pain where supplies are procurable, 3 farsakhs ! thence to Aman, 2 farsakhs ; Jiransu (uninhabited), 4 farsakhs ; and Gurgan, 5 farsakhs.

Note. —The route from Kartlk-KUa to crest of ridge was not surveyed but the line it takes was visible from the direct bridle-path. The Persian guns were dragged up by hand. There is no means of avoiding this high ridge says by a detour by the Chat-i-Chandir, for it maintains a nearly uniform height at Dinaalan a considerable elevation, 20 miles W. along the ridge. The path crossing route at the 7th mile from Qizlar Kila follows stream to junction with Khartul stream, and then enters a very narrow and rugged defile, known as the Chehil Guzar, or 40 crossing. This route was surveyed down to the Atrek, having been described as the best route into the Atrak valley from the Atrak and the northern tributaries. A narrow path leads from side to side of the defile, barely affording passage through dense jungle for a single horseman ; and the stream, which in rainy weather would offer a serious obstacle, has to be constantly crossed and re-crossed. A road fit for guns at dry seasons might be made without much difficulty, and would turn the inaccessible slopes of the Buzdaghi and Ak Chashmeh mountains which extend for many miles on either flank of the defile.

The low hills here exactly resemble the Chul of Badghis and the Maimana frontier which have been so aften described. The village of Shams Khan stands on the left bank of the stream just above the junction with it of the valley just descended. It is a pretentious little place, and has a small mud wall and gateway. It was built and occupied for defence in olden days, against the Turkoman raiders. It is a filthy place with no accommodation. The village of Zangalanlu is said to be about a farsakh higher up the stream which is said to take its rise like the Lain stream in the Hazar Masjid hill.

The buluk is terminated, and the head of the Darreh Gaz valley is closed, by a gorge, with precipitous rocks rising 200 or 300 feet on either side at the entrance, and rising higher and higher farther on. Through this gorge the stream enters the valley. From here there are three tracks. The first is on the S. side of the gorge and runs over the moun tains to Durb Adam. It is said to be a less difficult road than the third, and to make a stage of 5 farsakhs. The second runs through the gorge in many places down the river bed. It appears to be liable to floods, in which state Bruce found it. The third is the track here described. The distance is only 34 farsakhs, but it is extremely difficult, and takes anything up to 7 hours to accomplish. Leaving the valley just on ng it of the gorge, at an elevation of 3,400 feet, the path loads straight into the mountains and commences an ascent up the side_ of a steep hill. At about 2 miles reach a high crest, elevation 4.500 feet. Thence up and down, in and out of variousjavines along the southern slope of the hills, with the Duringar river gorge below on the left the whole way. At about the /th mile we got to the foot of the Kutal-i-Chub Bast, the crowning difficulty of the whole march. Here necessary to climb up the almost perpendicular face of a hill for some 400 feet and then a passage along a narrow rocky ledge with a steep decli vity below and nasty rocks jutting out above every here and there, just so placed ag to catch the loads on the mules andRoute No. VIII (e)—contd. send the animals over the edge. It took an hour and a half to get the few Abdari and other mules over this pass, and at one place felts had to be laid down to get the horses or mules up at all. The crest has an elevation of about 5,250 feet and from it the Kuchan-Askhabad road is visible over the moun tains. Beyond this there is an easy and gradual descent to Shamkhal, where the first water was reached at about the 11th mile. The muleteers suffer greatly from the want of water on the road, and any one doing this march should he careful to carry water with him. Colonel Yate’s baggage mules, which started at 5 a.m., did not reach Bajgiran till 4 p.m., and many of them had cut and bruised legs and heads from their frequent falls on the rocks. Shamkhal is a small village just at the head of a second precipitious gorge which runs down and joins the main Duringar stream gorge. About a mile beyond is the high road at Mihmankhaneh. Some 2 miles beyond or to the N. of the Mihmankhaneh reach the village of Bajglran-i-Iran, as it is called to distinguish it from the Russian post, called Bajghan-i-Rus, on the opposite side of the frontier.

Track runs steedily W., sometimes WNW. At 1 hour a conical hill on one side of the track, elevation 3,200 feet. Not high enough to give a view of the railway over the next ridge. Shortly afterwards pass the village Lain. Follow the valleys on to the W., crossing ridges and winding in and out of valleys hemmed in by low rolling hills, until 2 hours after starting, when a large open valley is reached. This valley is very fertile and full of herds of sheep and goats, with the black tents of many Mdlddrs. The latter are not Persians, but wandering shepherds of Turk! extraction, who cross and re-cross the frontier as they please. Elevation of valley 2,550 feet. 1 e track direct from Meshed to Kacha Kaakha crosses the route here, coming from the S.W. At another place near Kirnabad during this march, Bruce saw hundreds more sheep and goats quitely grazing under the shadow of a steep, grassy ridge which ended in a rocky bluff. Seven hours after starting strike the main track from Meshed to Kalat, leading to the frontier. Follow this for another mile and reach Shams Khan.

The road runs from Marushk in a NW. direction following a good stream of spring water for about 6 miles. The first 2 miles from Marushk the land is cultivated. The succeed ing 8 miles is through an uncultivated, broad valley enclosed by low hills. There is no water to be found here, but grazing for camels is abundant. At the 10th mile the road enters the hills and here going is very slow on account of the steep ascents and descents. The road in some places is about 3,600 feet above sea level. About the 15th mile there is a small spring of good drinking water. From the 15th mile the road continues to descend until it comes to the river bed (at present dry), here the road is un defined. At 22 miles road branches into two, one leading to Khakistar and one over the hill to Lain. The approach to Lain is by a rapid ascent and a similar descent. The village of Lain consists of about 250 houses. Cultivation is not carried on very exten sively on account of the rocky nature of the soil. The chief employment is goat rearing.

The remaining part of the road to Shams Khan is level and good going. The road from Lain to Kiergiun is over a series of high hills. The road is very badly defined in places and is very rocky. A water channel containing a little water follows the road. The village of Keirgiun is passed at 12 miles and contains about 200 houses and is occupied mostly by Kurds.

This stage, with the BAD. exception of the first 120 five miles, the road is quite good and well defined. It is of a clay nature. From Shams Khan the road runs in a NE. direction along the bank of a river. The first five miles the road is very bad and undefined, through prickly grass.

The remaining 18 miles is over undulating country where cultivation is very poor on account of scarcity of water. The road is good. At 20 miles there is a small village with a few houses with orchards. Water supply, two small streams, would water a squadron. At 22 miles the road follows the telegraph line into Muhammadabad.463 Route No. YIII (f)— concld. Alternative Route Marushk to Muhammadabad. By far the best road from Marushk to Muhammadabad is to proceed as far as where the road divides into two, one going to Khakester and the other to Lain. Continue on to Khakester and from there to Robat and thence to Shams Khan. From Shams Khan follow the telegraph line to Muhammadabad. Telephone Communication. The telegraph line follows the road as far as Iskabad, from there it runs into the hills and is next seen again at Khakester. From there it continues by the above mentioned road to Muham madabad. Khakester has telegraphic communication with Meshed and Kalat-i-Nadiri. The whole system is carried on thin wooden poles which would not bear an additional wire. If a special wire were required, a system running parallel to this would be the most economical. The movement of troops along the Khakha road to Muham madabad would present great difficulties. The passage of infantry, especially in the third and fourth stages would be exceedingly slow. The picketing of the heights would also entail great difficulty and a large expenditure of men on account of the great fluctuation of difference in heights. At certain points in the passes, a few enemy with machine guns would be capable of holding up the progress of a regiment. The transport of baggage would be slow and arduous. Cavalry could not be used, nor field guns. ROUTE NO. VIII (g). RIZAN to KALAT-I-NAIDlRl. 53 miles. 5 stages. Authorities. —Bruce, 1902 ; Annotated by Tanner, 1906. M. A. Meshed, 1927.

Then enter the defile of Zu-i-Andarukh, which is the first of the rocky gateways which occur all the way to Kalat-i-Nadirl. The narrow part is about 1 mile in length and is hemmed in with precipitous rocks, whose heights are variously computed at 800 feet to 1,000 feet {Napier), 200 feet {MacGregor), 1,000 feet to 1,500 feet {Curzon,), 300 feet {Yate), and 150 feet to 200 feet {Bruce). Down the centre flows a good stream. The entrance is a narrow gorge, some 40 yards in width; further on the gorge sometime narrows, and sometimes widens to 60 or 70 yards. The track becomes the bed of the stream and vice versa, until J mile up the gorge. The stream leaves the track and rejoins it in the next valley. The track leaves the gorge and follows a side valley, still shut by low hills, and crossing a low ridge, on which stands a Turkoman tomb, descends into another vallev, with bare and arid hills all round. At 9 miles pass the village of Qardeh, situated on the left of the road, in a little valley of its own, I 5 miles long by f mile broad. Although only a village of 30 houses, there is a considerable amount of cultivation in the valley. Supplies procurable in abundance if notice is given. The road says Napier, might easily be made practicable for artillery as far as Kardeh. From here tracks lead to Chinaran W.; NW. to Khakha via Marushk and the road to Kalat N. After another rise and descent the road strikes the stream again and follows it to Al which is a picturesque little village in a basin in the mountains, formed by a narrow pass. It is Inhabit ed by some 25 families of Chubs. Supplies. —Procurable. 2 BALGHUR— .. 11m. General direction W. of - (6,000'). N. Road continues up the valley some 2£ miles, then passes the small village of Panj Maneh, near which there is a curious high bluff, about 600 feet to 700 feet465 Route No. VIII (g)— contd. high. A track from below the bluff leads to Narisk. Then on through rough ground. About 1 mile beyond, the road branches, the telegraph line following the main nala to the left, passing over the difficult Tang-i-Shikast, which is quite impracticable for artillery; there is a better road round to the right by the village of Sij, some 2 miles beyond. Half-way through the defile, rocks on either side come down so close that, at one place, a laden camel can hardly get through, and a steep ascent just beyond causes mules to slip their loads. Here there is practically no track. Boulders of all sizes block a gorge which narrows to 15 or 20 yards. Kurd camels, however, get through laden but some of them are as active as a mule. The position at this point is unassailable, the road leading straight up a cliff, going between precipices, and apparently coming to a cul de sac, as no sign of a road is seen. The hill rises 400 feet above the defile, and searches every foot of it for a mile. It would be possible to ascend the hills on the S. bank of the defile, and going along the crest, to get in behind the position J mile to the rear, and descend from this to the Tang-i-Shikast, whence a steep path leads up to the rear of the hill. This path, however, is so close that it would be impossible for troops to get up it unperceived, and no troops could force their way up. It might be possible to turn this position on its right, but the hills are so open that there would be little chance of doing so without being exposed, and the paths to it are all of an extremely impracticable nature. Leaving Sij to the right, rejoin the main'track some 2 miles beyond. Follow it for 3 miles on the Robat-i-Balghur, the name of an old ruin. Here turn off to the left for mile up a lateral nala to the village of Balghur. The villages in the hills between Andarukh and • Balghur are known by the general name of Chul-I-Khaneh, being the settlements of the Chuffs, a Turk tribe, but speaking both Turki and Persian. There are about 90 families in Bal ghur, but they say that the weather is so cold that grapes will not grow here, and they have very little fruit. The village is a lonely spot in a fertile little valley, on to which, surrounded by high mountains, it looks down. The rise in this stage by the aneroid is about 1,200 feet. 3 BARDEH .. 13 m. General direction is first N. and then a sharp turn to S. of 37Route No. VIII {%)—contd. E. Returning to Robat-i-Balghur, the road runs for about 1 2 miles up the main valley and then a narrow gorge in the rock. This is the narrowest gorge yet traversed. ^ At two places, not more than J mile from one another, the rock walls are not more than a mule’s length apart. A pack pony can just pass. (Bruce). The road winds up the nala for another d 2 miles, the gorge occasionally opening out into miniature valleys, only to close in again. Everywhere are boulders of all sizes and shapes, some the size of a mans head, and others as large as a farmyard cart, but all scattered about in the wildest confusion. (Bruce). After 3£ miles another bad gorge is reached; at the top of this the road divides that to the left or . ’ S oin g i* i s sa i c i&gt; direct through Charam, and that to the right or E., to Bardeh. Bruce says that on gaining the top oi the end of the gorge a broad track leads by Ziang to Ssachsh (Itia Su ?). One mile beyond this the watershed is reached at a low kutal, called Kila-i-Pirzan, with a rise from Balghur of some 1,500 feet. Beyond this, instead of the narrow rocky defile previously traversed, cross an open undulating country on the top of the hills, known as the Karadagh range, and the. road runs along this up and down crossing ridge after ridged ihe elevation of these rolling mountain tops is about 6 500 feet, and Bruce in April found a snow field, f mile across ’and too deep to cross. One mile from the Kila-i-Pirzan, a small hamlet of nomads is reached, and here a road branches off to the left to the village of Abkamak. For the first 2 miles , left ° r of the track runa tlle crest °f the main ridge 400 feet to 500 feet above the road level. It is a regular saw tooth edge of curiously irregular shape. Some 34 miles beyond , the kemleri the second kutal, called the Diveh Bulun, or, in Persian Shutur Gardan, is reached after several steep ascents and descents. It crosses the SE. and of ridge mentioned above. It has an elevation of 230 feet less than the Pirzan, but has a much steeper approach. The ascent from the S. is very rocky and difficult for laden mules, and impassable for camels. Bruce says that there is a straight climb of from 50 feet to 60 feet impassable except for led animals, and bad enough for them Nothing but a hill pony or mule could surmount it. Some miles upon the Meshed side of the pass are some good springs, the track to the left under the saw tooth ridge. The descent on the N. side is very steep for the first 300 feet, and467 Route No. VIII ( g )— contd . then it winds down to the village of Bardeh, or rathei trvo villages of that name close together. Bruce makes the descent to be 900 fdlt. The 2 villages occupy two round hills ; that with the lesser number of houses commands the other. There is an old mud fort, now in ruins but, at one time a place of some strength. The hills for the last part of the way are thinly dotted with juniper trees. The stage is said to be passable for camels with the exception of the second kutal. Water.

Then turn up a side nala to the N. Up this it winds, rising steeply for about miles, when un dulating ground on the top is reached. Arcoss this it runs for another mile to Mirza Kushti Pass. The surface is for the most part roughly ploughed, although there is no sign of water. The road then drops down a fine glen with startling abruptness. The glen is V-shaped, both sides rising from the little stream at an angle of 50. The descent down this on the northern side of the hills is very steep, comprising first a sudden drop from an elevation of some 6,400 feet to about 5,000 feet to the bed of the nala, where water is reached. Thence down the nala between scarped hills on either side, until the camping-ground is reached at the junction of this nala with the Istuk nalas some 5 miles from the top of the pass, and with a further des cent of some 800 feet.
