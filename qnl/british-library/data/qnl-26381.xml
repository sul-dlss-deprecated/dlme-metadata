(J'lH.Prendergast DSO MC)HALF YEARLY REPORT ON THE ROYAL AFGH^JI AIR FORCE, S E 0 R E T »—r For the pe r iod 1st Kay, 1%-9. to 31st October, 1949. 1 . Introduc tory, In previous reports I have provided a good deal of detail concerning the ori ? »« s nisation and administration of the Royal .Afghan nir Force (R # /i’g,A.F.). iiS ^.n the period under review there has been little change of note, I do not intend in this report to repeat details relating to this organisation and administration. Addressees have all the information they require in my last two reports. I am not providing, a thumb-nail sketch of Air Force personalities for the same reason. There have been no important changes since my first report on personalities. jigain, I am not going to dwell further on the reasons for the extreme inefficiency of the R.Afg.A.F. In the past I have been at some pains to emphasise the causes of this inefficiency, as at one time the i^ir ministry not unnaturally considered the R.A.F. Officers’ reports exaggerated in this respect due to the latters ' feelings of frustration when attempting to give the Afghans of their best. A repetition here of such failings in this small air force would be redundant. In any case I feel that with Afghanistan’s limitations, this gross inefficiency is a foregone conclusion. I have studied the R.^.F, Officers’ current reports and find them both painstaking and accurate. They also provide all the necessary minor detail which leaves me able in this report to confine myself to matters of policy. 2 . Cu:--rent Difficulties . During the period under review the Afghans have been talcing stock of the sums paid out in employing foreigners, because of their economic difficulties. The result has been the decision not to renew the contracts of some of the more expensive employees and to enlist foreign employees such as Austrians and to a lesser degree Germans who are content with smaller salaries. The R.A.F, might be considered expensive employees and had there not been a gradual greater appreciation of their services they might have been dropped, especially as previously they had been employed upon what amounted to vague verbal agreements on the ii’ghan side. In order to consolidate the R.n.F. detachment’s position here I have dm ing the period under review and for a far longer time tried to get the .i'ghan War Kinistry to sign agreements and contracts concerning the terms of employment of the detachment. In this I have tried to strike a happy medium between what I considered the Afghans could afford to pay and what the R.A.F. personnel needed for their well-being in Afghanistan. The Afghans agreed to a small rise in pay to offset discontent which was apparent at the time of my appointment, due to the rising cost of living. The Air ministry has also come to the rescue by agreeing to make up in allowances the amount they consider necessary for the R.^.F. personnel over and above the pay that these personnel are receiving from the Afghans, This has resulted in the detachment being far more content. Try as I may, however, for over a year during sessions with one C.G.S. and then later another, of always some three hours' duration, upon an average of once a fortnight, I have been unable to get them to sign contracts for these personnel. Without contracts the Afghans remain completely muddled. They cannot remember the terms of employment and are also able to delay payments, ostensibly because each relieving C.G.S. has been able to sa}*- that he has no knowledge of one after another of the clauses in the original agreement. The Defence Ministry is therefore able to prevaricate and put off the evil day when they have to wrestle with the finance department for money to pay out. This prevarication is of course inherent in the East. The Afghans, ever since the days of Dost Mohammed have been accustomed to subsidies and gifts from the British and they still hope by delay and obstruction even in these hard times to find that they will be released from having to meet their obligations. My predecessor, out of deference to the Afghans’ dislike of written agreements, allowed the terms of employment to remain verbal. In fairness to him this worked fairly well, as he had worked for some years with a C.G.S. who was more intelligent and stuck firmly to his agreements. when I arrived a new C.G.S. had just been appointed, who at first - 1 - /denied, r- 2 - dr \. i * * * + d f 11 knowlod g e of the terms of the agreements. /ifter six months, when he got to know me better, he agreed to sign the contracts when they arrived from England.^ The original contracts I had received contained a demand for such a great increase in pay from the Afghans to meet the increased cost of living that I had asked the Air Ministry to reduce their demands to something a little higher only than the sums originally agreed upon verbally. I knew the Afghans could not pay such great increases and that we should lose our detachment. Ministry on being informed of the situation re-drafted the contracts upon recommendations, which included a slight rise in pay which I felt sure ti.e Afghans, if tactfully approached, would agree to. It was these new contracts that the C,G.S. declared himself ready to sign when they arrived. He also agreed to the small increase of pay and commenced payment before the arrival of tixe contracts. The C.G.S., who was a reasonable individual, though slow, became ill and went abroad before the contracts arrived. In his place was appointed an unintelligent man who was also obstinate and hoped by delaying not to A vo to beard the finance department. He has offered every resistance to tne signing oi the contracts, though upon each visit he has promised to do so immediately (for the last eight months). It is worth adding that the contracts as drafted now for simplification and easy comprehension by the Afghans have been me.de uniform by me, rank by rank, c..nd contain ep.sy round sums. Previously, some R.A.F. personnel were employed on one set of teruis and some on another which made the whole problem apparently difficult for the ‘Afghans to grasp. I have seen that if the Afghans do not grasp a problem, they become suspicious. Once the simple terms I have drawn up in conjunction with the Air Ministry are grasped, things will be easier, Such problems as future increased cost of living and devaluation of currency will complicate matters, but at least I shall have a clearly recorded base to work from. There are signs that with the recent appointment of a new War Minister a man of influence, energy and drive, the contracts will be signed and with them tre outstanding allowances of R.A.P. personnel will be paid. If so, over a year’s hard work (which actually involves trivial matters which could be settled in a civilized country in a few hours) will have been settled. Apart from consolidating the R.A.F's position in the above respect, it is even more important to make the R.A.F. detachment indispensable on account of their work. ^ This is a still more ticklish problem, as the War Ministry has shown little (thougn increasing) interest in its air force. Consequently it has had little interest in the R.A.F. detachment and its often frustrated efforts to become indispensable. The danger is that lack of interest and lack of knowledge of its potential very real worth, may also result in a belief that the detachment is really only a luxury to be dispensed with. I cannot tell the imr Ministry its job, though I have gradually by hints and remarks been able to stimulate its interest in the detachment’s potentialities. They do not, however, realise that if the R.A.F. Officers' ideas and suggestions were fully implemented and their efforts at instruction conscientiously followed, their Aii Force which is little more than a normal squadron could quickly become a really good force. The Afg.A.F. and the instructors are, however, still remote in the minds of the War Ministry. The R.Afg.A.F. is still an unhealthy appendix to the Afghan Army. But the gulf has been narrowed. My efforts to find, and the Air Ministry's efforts to provide, instructors who have the patience and tact to work harmoniously with the exasperating Afghans have produced good dividends. The present team are gradually showing their worth both in pilot and techruca! instruction and in drawing up schemes for civil aviation, the expansion oi the Air Force and better organisation and administration. They have themselves helped to draw the j.ir Force closer to the Defence Ministry, although practically none of their recommendations .have been implemented. The pilot instructor by personally piloting very important personages has thus stimulated interest in his party and in civil aviation as an offshoot of the Air Force, i 13 k °P cd that h y hints a n d suggestions, though one must wait to be asked, I can showthe new War Minister the advantages to be gained if students attend lectures and instruction provided more frequently and the advantages of new simplified ° ° r 5 an ^ S f t:L ° n administration to replace the present unworkable system. Then the R.^.l. detachment’s position will have been fully consolidated and as I am convinced of the desirability of the detachment as a mark of England’s continued interest in Afghanistan now that the latter feels lonely and isolated and from ?he point of view of British prestige, then something will have been achieved.- 3 - 3. Policy - Training and Supply of idrcraft and Equipment. (a) The policy regarding tre-ining of personnel oi the R.hfg.A.F. is clear. If full advantage were taken of the pilot and technical instruction offered, this should be sufficient, with the addition of courses of instruction in England for^he very few whose education would make such instruction profitable. The Air .Inistry have held vaonneies open and candidates for courses were selected by the Commandant with the help of the R.A.F. Officers who held preliminary language exams and tests. It is regretted that the Commandant with characteristic suddenness decided not to send candidates at the last moment, as they were shortsightedly to be employed in civil aviation, a new scheme in the Afghans' 'grasshopper minds'. (b) I should still like some indication of a clear dividing line as to what equipment the R.A.F. are prepared to supply from their stocks and for what items application should be made direct to firms. The j.ir Ministry's views would also be appreciated as to how their interests lie in assisting the unimportant -“fghan ^ir Force. From the Foreign Office point of view it is understood, that the assistance we are affording the id'ghans is desirable as a mark of British friendship and from the point of view of prestige. I too feel that our help is important. It is probable in time that the Afghans will want to increase the R.A.F. detachment considerably and I have agreed already to making the request on the .tifghans ' behalf, of which the Mir Ministry knows, for two more Sgt. fitters. However, should further increases be requested eventually, the desirability of tying up valuable R.n.F. personnel in a comparatively unimportant role should be weighed against considerations of prestige. It is also known that the Afghans contemplate buying more aircraft, though they speak of being interested in the purchase of camparatively large numbers, it seems clear that they can at present only buy a few. The idr Ministry's views would be appreciated concerning the type of aircraft the .ifghans should be encouraged to buy, although of course they may determine this for themselves. The Afghans are at present divided in their minds. They wish to buy fairly modern fighters and are interested in the Fury and the Firefly. On the other hand they have during the last two weeks shown more interest in aircraft suitable for civil aviation. At present they are hardly sufiiciently advanced to fly so modern a fighter as the Fury safely. The cost of the individual plane is very high and accidents would be frequent, Their desire for such fighters is due probably to envy of the Pakistan and Iranian Air Forces. Purchase of a few such fighters would not constitute a threat to either of the above countries, nor would Afghanistan intend it to be a threat. However, Pakistan at the present moment might be expected to be somewhat touchy over such a purchase. Further, it does not seem strategically important for us to encourage small countries to set up comparatively modern small fighter lorces where they would at once be mopped up at the outset of another war. vvere Afghanistan considered a worthwhile ally in a future war, she could presumably count on air support from Britain and America at some period in the course oi that war. 7/hat appears to be really important is to assist the -Afghans to maintain a small air force which v/ould be a decisive factor against tribesmen, should the latter, as is possible, stage a large scale revolt. X have reported already that in the event of a major tribal uprising the Afghan ^J^my might prove unwieldy and it is doubly important that the air arm should be efficient if small. If we can help the Afghans achieve a small effective air force in this respect, a pressing need will have been met. Should the present regime be over throv/n, control for a time would also be lost over the tribes on her side of the Durand Line by Pakistan. Any such disturbances v/ould leave the frontier of Pakistan more vulnerable to communist infiltration. Therefore the Afghans should be encouraged to buy (provided they are willing) obsolete fighters which Q-re in fact more suited to anti-tribal warfare. These would not be so costly but on the other hand they should not be so obsolete as to be without adequate balanced spares for about five or six years' flying.- 4 - It is felt that the jjfghans should be encouraged to buy planes suitable for running a small civil aviation service in which they are interested. Some aircraft like their present . nsons would be suitable, provided they had a slightly better ceiling as the present ./.nsons can traverse some of the mountain ranges only with dilficulty, if at all. Such aircraft could also be used for anti— tri^l warfare in bombing and supply dropping. The Afghans are interested in the Chipmunk ti ainer and it is felt that they should be encouraged to buy a few, I am in favour of maintaining the Afghans * interest in British aircraft and everything possible is being done in this respect, even if they are determined to buy one or two modern fighters. Presumably such purchases favour British exports even though Afghanistan is a soft currency country. Further, I fear that should Afghanistan decide to buy a gradually increasing number of planes from another foreign country, she would eventually require instructors and technicians from that country. This would be all the more likely in that such personnel, with the exception of the Americans, would be cheaper. The ifghans have had several ofj eis from other countries for the sale of planes. I am maintaining interest in British planes and equipment as Skodas have-been trying to sell a large amount of workshop equipment to the A.ir Force. Skodas were kept out by obtaining a quotation from an English firm in which essential items were cheaper. Some of oxodas quotation consisted of very expensive items which the Afghans could never want.^ In this way the Afghans were induced to place an order with a British firm for absolute essentials only. Thus, as in other ways the R.^.F. technical xnstruetor has proved his worth by saving the Commandant from making rash and expensive purchases. Additional Instructors , ivjy request for two more Sgt fitters from the „.ir /Ministry was made at the instance of the Afghans. The Ansons as they become older will need more servicing. The Afghan technicians are lazy and show little progress. I do not wish to see a British made aircraft deteriorate through neglect. The British technical staff cannot cope with increased maintenance and instruct fully as well. i.orcover, I fear that the R.a.F. instructor may be involved in a crash if we have no one to look over planes before they take off. There have already been two instances of maladjusted pipes and controls which might have resulted in his encashing. A final unofficial check over by British personnel is desirable. Mechanics provided by Ajisons have not been a success and I was glad to advise their removal after their tour- vans complete, although there was some thought of extending the tour. They did the British no good and were lazy and unco—operative with the R.A.F. The present Armstrong Siddeley representative who came out upon a furtner purchase having been ma.de has, due to certain representations, proved a success, The additional two R.A.F. fitters are also required to take their part in instruction. 1- 1 S E C R E HALF YEARLY REPORT ON THE ROYAL AFGHAN AIR FORCE FOR THE x^RIOD 1 £ t Ni 1 s t NOyglilBE^ 4 1948 TO 30th APRIL, 19A9. 1. General t I948 The following report will include extracts from the reports of both the R.A.F. pilot officer and technical officer loaned to the Royal Afghan Government as well as my own general observations. My reason for this is that though the Air Ministry receives copies of these excellent R.A.F. reports,recipients'of my^report do not. The Air Ministry are therefore asked to bear with a certain amount of redundancy. Moreover, as the M.A. is discouraged from a too close inspection of minor details concerning the working of the Afghan Air Force, the R.A.F. reports compiled from day to day contact with the Air Force provide the necessary minor details to make this report complete. It is well to emphasise that I con sider that the reports compiled by the above two officers are no exaggeration of the general inefficiency of the said air force, although they are couched in somewhat pessimistic terms arising out of a feeling of frustration. 2. Causes of the Royal Afghan Air Force’s Inefficiency. The reasons for the R.A.A.F’s general inefficiency are manifold. The root cause of this inefficiency is due mainly to Afghanistan’s financial plight out of which other limitations inevitably arise. Afghanistan’s financial difficulties have been increased due to the partition of the Indian sub-continent which has caused a disruption of her trade. She also cannot find a market for her. main export of Karakul skins, due to bad seasons and the loss of European markets as a result of the war, and to the entry of rivals into this field of trade. Closely knit with the above is the lack, of education. None of the air force personnel has the educational qualifications to render him efficient. Education in the schools requires overhaul, and cadet schools for aircraft personnel should be started at a reasonably early age. Personnel are, at present, taken from the Military College for Officer ranks in which they receive no air force training, and are subsequently trained in a ' haphazard manner within the Air Force. Other rank personnel are conscripted and trained within the Air Force, and are bolstered up by a small force of civilian wood and metal workers of poor ability. The backbone of the Air Force is a party who were trained by the R.A.F. at Drigh Road, Karachi, although many of these have fallen back into the prevailing slovenliness. In addition to these ape the R.A.F. instructors, consisting of a pilot instructor and a technical 'infetruc^bor, both Squadron Leaders, together with three other rank fitter instructors (to be increased by two). Finally there are three civilian fitters loaned by Messrs A.V. Roe and Armstrong Siddely who have not v/orked as conscientiously as they should. Without the three categories above and in particular the R.A.F. party, it is doubtful if the Afghan Air Force would exist as a coherent body at all. Cadet and technical schools in the country are essential to get at the root of the evil and something could be done within their limited resources at present if the Afghans would listen to advice, though to be a working concern they would need outside financial and instructional aid. Training of Afghan personnel abroad would only assist in a small w r ay. Moreover, it appears probable that such training could not be sup lied free or even on concessional rates, which would mean that it would be a most uneconomical, and limited way of removing the general ignorance. Such courses strain the Afghans’ finances severely. Moreover I have found that only a handful of these personnel are fit educationally to benefit from courses in Europe. Concerning this, the Afghans are shortly to make a request for vacancies for training in flying and administration in the U.K. A form of test has already been carried out by the R.A.F. Officers, with the Commandant's concurrence,and an English examination has been held resulting in a handful of officers being found suitable for training in England provided that they are prepared in the first instance to join N.C.O. cadres.2 •v/' Lack of money leads to poor pay of Air Force personnel. The result is that personnel are ill nourished and this contributes to their general lethargy. This * is most noticeable in the severe winter months when the lack of fats in their diet causes them to hybernate and suffer acutely from the cold resulting in a high sick rate. Other factors contributing to their chronic inefficiency is that the more promising men are offered no incentive through examinations and promotion to excT&amp;. Nepotism and favouritism are rife leading to a force top heavy in the higher ranks. These higher ranks are filled by men of no ability and who accept no responsibility. To sum.arise; it is doubtful if the Air Force will succeed if Afghanistan receives no outside financial aid in one form or another. A desire for progress is apparent, and a fatal tendency to run before they can walk. The roots are rotten, yet they contemplate buying a few more aircraft when they are really unfit to maintain those alread}' in their possession. They even visualise organising an internal and to a limited degree an external civil air service. 3. Civil Air Service, The Afghan Air Force is seriously considering the establishment of a civil air service between Kabul, Kandahar and Herat and between Kabul and kazar-iHBharif, and if permission is accorded, between Kabul and Peshawar. This service is to be found out of the slender resources of the Air Force. Of course it is just possible to do it, but training of the Air Force would suffer further. To become a proficient service, considerable mone 3 &gt;- is necessary v, r hich is not available. In the same way basic training will be necessary otherwise the uneconomic employment of foreigners 1 is the only alternative if the Afghans are to reach a standard whereby they will 1 qualify for the benefits available from international air (Organisations, A. Organisation. The Koyal Afghan Air Force is organised as follows:- Commandant of the R.A.A.F. Chief of Air Staff. H.Q, R.A.A.F. Station Commander S.H.Q. Avro Squadro n Training Squadron Main Store 11 aircraft 8 Tiger Moths. (one to come) (remarks as for Hinds) Hind S quadron 1 7 aircraft of doubtful service ability due to lack of spares. 3. Comman dant of the R. A.A.F. (G.M. II (W/Cdr) Abdur Razak Khan) The nearest equivalent in the R.A.F. is the C.A.S. The above officer's powers are very limited as he has to refer everything to the Defence Ministry, a body which is as lethargic as the Air Force. New ideas, prompted by the R.A.F. Officers, generally lose themselves between the two. The Commandant is a poor disciplinarian, being tied to his office chair. He will not decentralise due to the inefficiency of his officers, and out of fear tbP-t they would undermine his authority. Workshops Photo Section W.T. Section- 3 - 6 • Chief of Air Staff. (G.M, II (w/Cdr) Asaif Khan), He has no staff and is really deputy Commandant. He is, as one would suppose, related to the Commandant. Ho has more personality than his superior but no clearly defined duties. The H.Q. is organised as follows : Commandant Chief of /dr Staff (Dep. Comdt). H.Q., K.A.A.F. Admin Brarich Stores Accounts. Internal Security Branch Pay Accounts Ops and Trg. 8. Admin Branch ( K.lvl. (S/Ldr) Said Karim Khan). This branch deals with overall admin of the R.A.A.F. Their scope includes thf 1 issue of ration cards, register of personnel, leave register etc. It is, in I 1 fact, a S.H.Q. Orderly Room. The above officer is at present under arrest for accepting bribes in exchange for exemption from conscription. 9. Pay Accounts. This section deals with all pay matters including (in a dilatory manner) pay of A.A.F. personnel. 10. Ops and T rg. _ (K,M. Abdul S^id Khan), 'This officer is merely a cypher, he has no ability or enthusiasm. He is elderly. He has a small staff of civilian clerks. He is glad to accept programmes set out by the R.A.F, instructor without comment although this does not help train the man ultimately responsible. There is no equivalent in the R.A.F. 11 . Internal Security Branch. Criticism even never heard. This H.Q. has a small administration staff. The above is one of the best officers in the force, being energetic and a good disciplinarian. All orders for wksps, sqns, etc. are passed from A.F. H.Q. to him and he does in fact see that they are carried out. He can be described as W/Cdr Flying, and Squadron Admin Ofiicer. 1 3.

Photography is about to be carried out at the time of writing; as an experiment, archaeological excavad-ions west of Kar ohar are to be photographed .Cameras have been made ready by the R.A.F. technical officer in the Ansons. The above officer (Ghul Muhd) is R.A.F. trained and is r'ff 'Qient. Due to lack of photographic activities he is also Adjutant to the bt'- ■'or p-der.

Machinery is Note: Necessary machinery has been listed and prices have been supplied by Messrs A.V. Roe of Manchester. The Afghans may and should purchase this machinery why-jja is essential. 1 5. Main Stores (K.il. Muhd Hussain Khan) . The store holds all equipment for the force with the exception of Sqn Wskp stores. Storage lacks any form of workable system. Issue of stores derives from an unwieldy- Turkish system. This system, or lack of system, is the chief stumbling block to maintenance. It is almost impossible to obtain issue of spare parts, an indent for which has to go through many channels. A screw may take a month to obtain. A modified and simplified R.A.F. system has been proffered but between the Commandant and the Defence Ministry nothing has yet been achieved. Until this situation is rectified, I see little hope of aircraft maintenance being efficient, even assuming that the Afghan mechanical staff are efficlent,which they are not. 1 6 . nvro Sq uadro n (K.M. Ghulam Haider Khan). of This squadron, formed in February 1948, consists of two flights and a total (one to come) aircraft. The pilots are completing conversion training, and nave done some formation flying. They are about to carry out cross country flying but will not be fit for ops before the end of the year. 1 7. Hind S quadr on (K.M. Sher Muhd Khan). This sqn is the only ops sqn at the moment. There are 16 usable aircraft of doubtful sicability due to lack of spares. There are sufficient pilots to man all the aircraft in the event of ops. The flying standard of this squadron is fair only and suffers from lack of flying hours. Navigation is patently -weak. 18. Training Squadron. (K.M. Sawar Khan), This squadron is equipped with Tiger Moth aircraft. Very little flying is carried out due to lack of spares. No qualified Afghan instructor exists. The R.A.F. instructor is fully occupied with the Arsons. 19. Annual ^'rai n ing. To sura this up briefly it is sufficient to say that the force does not put in oil ugh. /. flying hours. In the winter the force hybernates for reasons already stated and due to the absence of an efficient snow plough although weather is often ideal for flying. Such subjects as navigation, armament, signals and administration are not given-sufficient attention. Technical training in spite of all efforts by the instructors shows very slow progress, personnel are lazy and lack the mental capacity to understand anything technical. They show no ability at fault finding due to lack of reasoned mechanical thinking. The Air Force has drop ed only $0 practice bombs in the past few years. Bombs dropped are not plotted and misses of a hundred yards are cc nsidered good even when dive-bombing. No- high level bombing has been carried out. Not a single round of S.A.A. has been fired on training in the last two years. 20. Morale Poor pay, favouritism, lack of incentive etc, all play their part to lower the morale v.liich is, without doubt, poor. Lack of amenities and ;ames and the absence of mess life contribute their share to lack of esprit de corps. Off parade the Force is forgotten and all personnel disperse to their homes.* As the Air Force lacks a code of law and regulations such as K.R., A.C.I. of M.A.F.L., discipline is poor. Summary imprisonment is common, officers ^are put on hard labour with the men. Such imprisonment does not subsequently affect an officer's career. Striking by superior of immediate inferior, down to first private punishing second private in this manner is a daily occurrence. Punishments are capriciously carried out and follow no standard • code. Medical attention is primitive. 21 /^ Operational Ability. Only the Hind Squadron is in a condition to carry out operations and that,of course, only against tribesmen. They have been effective in the past as they b^nb villages without warning, unlike the R.A.F. during frontier ops. The Arsons being general purpose craft will in the future be useful in a tombing role, or in supply dropping though only a little thought has so far been given ±o this aspect. Many pilots are over age and others constitutionally unfit to become proficient. 2?. Value or oth erwise of the R.A.F. loaned Instr u ctional Staff. From the R.A.F. Officers' reports it may appear that their efforts are largely wasted. I am, however, satisfied that they are achieving some progress. Much of their advice, which is eagerly sought, at least on every subject relating to the force, is given consideration, if at present little is done. From the political angle their presence is most desirable. They help to strengthen the Air Force, which in its turn, contributes to the stability of the present rep■me against dangerous tribal disturbances. It is also good for British prestige. Again the Afghans must be convinced that we have some interest ir them in order that their morale does not suffer as a result of the proximity of their northern neighbour. Should military and air force togeiner with other, loaned personnel be increased appreciably, they could be used as a lever to restrain the Afghans from wild political and military adventures by threatening to withdraw their services, should the occasion arise. There signs tha* they’, will wish for more instructors in the future and in any case two more R.A.F. fitters are to arrive. The advantage of training and organising che Aefghan forces on British lines against a future war, from the point of view of iAffiliation and expansion should not be*lost sight of. Tone]uaion. This report is designed to give a deeper insight into the organisation of the force than previous ones and also to underline the limiting factors towards ultimate efficiency. Progress in flying Ansons has been achieved during the period under review. The R.A.F. personnels' advice is also more readily sought. A greater measure of co-operation and oameradcrie has been achieved recently between the R.A.F. and officers of the Afghan Air Force, The Afghans’, suspicious by nature, are no' longer suspicious of the R.A.F. personnel. Pay and allowances of these personnel always present a problem as the Afghans are always unpunctual in making payments but improvements in this respect have been achieved.1.

Gol) Abdur Razaq Khan has been aD^ointed r ''&amp;6mmandant of the Afghan Air Force and G.M.II Asif Khan has been nn^ointed his 2 i/command and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Previously the Air Force was commanded by the C.G.S., this former arrangement was better from my noint of view and that of the R.A.F. nersonnel as the young Commandant is inclined to intrigue and muddle, whereas formerly the C.G.S., being an older and more exnerienced man, ensured that the R,A.F, nersonnel were treated with consideration. Recent representations by myself have produced some improvement in the relations between the Commandant and the R.A.F. personnel, and I am trying, with some success, to convince the Afghans that someone senior, such as the C.G.S., should resume a more active part in the direction of the Air Force. It i c honed that by this arrangement, advice by R.A.F. personnel will be given due weight and that interference in their actual instruction will be avoided. I have asked chat the R.A.F. senior instructor be given direct access to a senior Afghan officer such as the C.G.S. in the same way as is the Commandant. (ii) Ten Avro XIX aircraft have now been delivered by air to Kabul. S/bdr Reid flew an Avro to Kandahar and gave demonstrations. The Governor of the Province was given a short flight. 3/Ldr Reid, at a later date, again flew an Avro to Kandahar to bring to Kah the wife of the Governor who was seriously ill. This officer also flew an Avro t° Peshawar recently taking two civilian mechanics on ar. argent replacement task. (iii) Kandahar air strip is a fair weatuer one wi-h a dus : surface and inadequate drainage. The dimensions are aporoxinr ''i9 i .. T 1,200 X 1000 yards. (b) Squadron Organisation:- Hind Sqdn. i i i f No. 1 No. 2 Flight. Flight. Avro 3qon. I T Nc. 1 No. 2 Flight. Flight (incl. Romeo a/craft). Training Sqdn , I T JL Tiger Moths. Stearman P.T. 17. 2. (i) Serviceability of Aircraft. The Avro aircraft are often grounded, through lack of spares. Defects are noi of a serious nature. The position should improve as spares are novj coming tnrough from Karachi where they have been held up. The civilian mechanics (on temporary loan) do the major part of the Avro maintenance, but it is doubtful If they have achieved much towards training Afghan mechanics in these duties. (ii) There have been two crashes of Hind airc'af: due to engine trouble. One plane is probably a ’write off. (iii) The Romec Squadron is now disbanded as an T'^dependcnt formation and has become part of the Avro Squadron. Of the 12 Romeos, / are serviceable and 8 unserviceable due to lack of spares„- 2 - 2• (Gontinued) . (iv) The Hind Squadron has done very little flying this year due to a lack of balanced spares. Of the 17 Hinds 11 are servicealle. The question of Hind snares is being taken un. (v) The Training Squadron is equipped with Tiger Moth aircraft. Of the 8 Tiger Moths, 5 are serviceable and 3 unserviceable. ^ Little flying has been done due to lack of snares. The ’'hole question of snares is to be reviev/ed again. •»&gt; (vi) The Stearman P.T. 17 is serviceable but difficult to fly at these altitudes and i 0 seldom used. 3• Airnort or Landing Ground I mpro vement. (a) The only improvement that has taken place during the pexiod under review is at the Khwaja Rawash airfield, where ground has been^ levelled to give an additional run of 300 yards in a N. Tr . - S. ln . direction, airfield is one of two in Kabul). (b) Two large hangars are under construction under the supervision of Ma,i. F.E. Donnithorne, a retired Army engineer under contract to the Afghan Government. One hangar is complete except for doors at either end, ana overall painting. The second is half completed. (c) Morrison Knudsen (American Engineers employed by the Afghan Government on many engineering projects), have offered to make the Kandanar axrf-eia fit for all weather. So far the Afghans have not approved tnis offer but will probably do so when they start a civil service. 4• Civil Aviat ion. (a) The question of an internal Government air service is t' : ng seriously considered by the Afghans, T,1 ith but few pilots trained in -lying A.vro-, the Afghans are not ready to start yet. (b) The Russian courier plane has made regular flights using Dakota aircraft. On one occasion it was reliably reported that a Russian made Dakota was used. This aircraft found difficulty in taking off and since then only American Dakotas have been used. (c) One or two INA aircraft have flown in to Kabul, these ouanes having been chartered by the Indian Embassy, (d) One R.P.A.F. Dakota flew to Kabul bringing a ’good will 1 party of Pakistan officials. 5. Efficiency of Afghan Pilots. (a) The flying efficiency of the Hind Pilots is deteriorating due to lack of flying time. (b) There are 9 pilots trained in flying the new Avros of which one is rated above average, 5 average and 3 below average. (c) A certain amount of dive bombing has been carried out b,.t the standard of skill displayed was poor. (d) Formation flying was carried out at the Afghan Independ r ace celebrations after some practice. The standard of flying ..gain poor. 4. R. A.F. personnel seconded to the Royal Afgh an Air_F oP£_ ; - (a) S/Ldr G.F. Reid, D.F.C., carries out pilot instruction .nail types of aircraft used by the Afghans. He acts as G.O. of the refining R.A.F. personnel. His advice is sometimes sought on all ma' ters connected with the Afghan Air Force, quite apart from pilot instruction affairs.&amp; (c) Rigger Instructor V’/O R. Elyth instructs in rigging and also carries out maintenance tasks when called upon. (d) Fitter Instructor F/Sgt J. Orbell instructs in fitting and carries out maintenance tasks if required. (e) Sgt. A. Hammond is r7 ireless Instructor in all types of radio and electric work. 6. (Cont inued). (t) S/Ldr F.C. Foolley, M.B.E. is technical instructor and advises on all technical matters and is in charge of the technical N.C.Os. 7. P.O.L. All aircraft in the Afghan Air Force now use 87 Octane aviation spirit. Nothing is known of Afghan reserves of petrol as it is stored in an area where foreigner 0 are not given access. The Afghans are also reticent as to quantities held. 8. F. T. Section. This is under the instruction of Sgt. Hammond and Mr. Edwards (Avro Representative). The sets used in aircraft are Marconi 1154 and 1155. On the ground, Canadian Army 19 sets are used. Nine students have been trained and passed out as W.T. Operators. They are nov working, under supervision, on the Avro aircraft. 9• A fghan Air Force Expansion . It is very doubtful if the Afghan Air Force will expand much in the near future unless it is subsidised, but, however, the purchase of a considerable amount of workshop equipment is being considered. This equipment is urgently required as there is insuffici ( nt to carry out maintenance of the existing aircraft. I have made preliminary enquiries concerning the supply of such equipment in England and await information as to its cost. 10. Outl ine of the Technical Aspect. (a) Organisation. There is no centralised technical control to co-ordinate the activities of the three squadrons and workshops. The senior technical officer, holding the rank of Lt. Col., is employed in the Anson Sqw.dron on duties comparable with that of an R.A.F. Flight Mechanic. Technical control commences at Squadron level. Each Squadron has a few fitter rigger tradesmen who are responsible for minor daily maintenance. Major and minor servicing is carried out under the supervision of unit workshop personnel. Fhat is required is a central servicing Squadron to handle all work beyond the scope of user Squadrons. This modification has been suggested to the Afghans. (b) The low proportion of serviceable aircraft can be attributed to the follovring. There are no skilled mechanics. This defect is remediable in time but the Afghan is by nature lazy and unreceptive to anything which involves precision. Spare parts of the older types of aircraft are unbalanced and there i° considerable difficulty in obtaining more. The matter of these spares is being reviewed again to see if any are available either in the Indian Union or the U.K. Finally workshop equipment i o old and insufficient. The Afghans are considering making considerable purchases of new equipment. 11. Airfield Equipment. The Afghan Air Force have absolutely no fire fighting or rescue equipment. They have been advised to make minor purchases of this equipment, and appear interested in the suggestion. They also lack guiding beacons for their airstrips. ******************,1 • FILE COPY ^ S E T -^-K-XX^X X-X-X-^ From:- The_Military Attache’, Lega ‘ British Legation, KA BUL INDEXED , I t To:- Director of Military Intelligence (I)* U.1.2(a), War Office, LONDON 3.W.I., (2 copies).

Inis di^cusoioa . the appro valof the Ministry of Defence. It was agreed tnat th,. i n / I&lt;$&gt; proposals put forward by the Air Ministry will involve many changes ii recruitment of officers and other ranks for the Afghan Air i^orpe* the elimination of many of the older and inefficient officers^ serving in the Air Force at present, the institution of some system whereby better educated officers and tther &lt; ranks can be secured for the Air Force and the introduction tf considerable improvements m tne conditions of service for all ranks. It was recommended that tne Afghan Air Force should reorganise itself from scratch, though it was realised that this will be difficult because the Afghan Government ^ musS^at all times have some pperational aircraft available fpr^internal security duties and cannot dispose of the older and loss clficient officers and men until new personnel can &lt; be trained to take tneir 'Diace. The position bristles with difficulties and i some time will brobable elapse before any whplesale measures are taken to reorganise the Air Force on a more efficient basis. The Ministry OiDeiunco will undoubtedly discuss the question further when the Stall uiiicer of the Air Ministry, London and the R.A.F. liaison Officer in rakistan pay their projected visit to Kabul. (b) In March, the Air Ministry, London offered to train five Signals officers of the Afghan Air Force on a 34 week course in England commencing in April 1948 providing the officers_selected have_a University Degree with 2nd Glass honours in engineering, pnysics, science or applied mathematics and a good knowledge of English, - 7 U 0 , Afghan Government were very grateful for this offer but were compoliud to decline it because there wore no officers with a University Dwgrv-u or similar qualifications available and only qne Signals oifiocn witn a good knowledge of English and signals experience up to W/I operator standard. They hope that the offer will be repeated in about one year’s time. (c) In August 1947 the Afghan Government &gt; made a request for the loan of the services of an R.A.F.

He was required to take charge oi the workshops oi teu Afghan Air Force, supervise%the training^of fitters and riggers ^uo , and advise the Air Force concerning the inauguration ox small civi.i air services using Avro XIX aircrait.
