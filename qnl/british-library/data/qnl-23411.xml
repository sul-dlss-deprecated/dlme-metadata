His Britannic Majesty*s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to enquire whether you think it is possible that the Government of India Survey Department would accept two or three young Bahrain Arabs to be trained as surveyors and draughtsmen. There is and always has been a considerable amount of survey work done by the Land Depart ment in Bahrain. At present all the surveyors are Indians. Although their work is very satis factory it would be useful if one or two local asr*0C. young men could be trained X&gt;b eventually take the places of the Indian surveyors. The Bahrain Government would be prepared to pay all the expenses of men who were sent from here to learn. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the GovernmentPolitical Agency, No. 2504-6/18 Bahrain, the 8th December 1937. From H. liVeightanan, Esquire, I.C.3., Political Agent, Bahrain, To ine Honourable uhe political Itesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Suojecu:- Training of Bahrain Youths in the Government of India Survey Department, Sir, 1 have one honour to say that the Adviser to the Bahrain Government has enquired whether it would be pos sible to arrange for uhe training of two or three young Bahrain Arabs as surveyors and draftsmen by the Survey Department of the Government of India. 2. Though no land revenue is collected in Bahrain, the Land Department here undertakes a considerable quan tity of survey work corresponding closely to revenue surveys in India, including the preparation of village maps etcetera. The Administration are anxious to train a few local youths for this work and they would of course be prepared to meet all expenses incurred if arrangements can be made for their training in India. I regret that I am not av/are vdiether the Central Survey Department holds training courses in revenue survey work or whether it will be necessary to apply for accommodation in a Provincial Survey and Settlement School, but I would suggest that, if you see no objection, the advice of the Government of India may be sought on this point and their assistance solicited in arranging for the training- 2 - of the tv/c or three Bahrain youths whom it is desired * . to send. These youths possess a fair knowledge of the English language, hut of course are ignorant of any Indian vernacular.

It would be very useful for the Bahrain Government to have him trained for a further period of a year in the Bengal Traverse Party. The other two have plodded valiantly to pick up as much knowledge of the work in the short time at their disposal. They have also been shown the methods of printing and drawing as carried out in the Drawing Office. Sd/- C. B. Sexton, Officer in Charge, Bengal Traverse v Party and Bengal Drawing Office. 16 . 3 . In. Remarks of Director of Land Records and Surveys, Bengal:- The three youths have done fairly well. They do not know the language of the province which has been a handicap.

Abdulla Alzaed has two boys at school and neither of them are particularly intelligent or promising. He recently suggested that his older boy should be sent by the Bahrain Government to Egypt in place of one of the boys who were chosen to go there. He was told that this could not be done as his son was far behind the students who were selected for advanced training abroad. The Bahrain Government does not propose to make any special arrangements for the sons of Abdulla Alzaed to be educated abroad at Government expense. If he himself wishes to send his boys to school in Egypt, or elsewhere, he is entirely free to do so.

Yusufbin Ahmad al Sa f id Sir, , (T- u I am directed to refer to your letter No.2053-6/69, dated the 25th November 1939, communicating the orders of the Bahrain Government that the monthly allowances of the Bahraini youths named in the margin, who Rs.37-8-0 j have recently been sent to India 2. Ahmed bin Mohammad J urn an j 3. Mohammad bin Yusuf Jalal- Rs.15-0-0 Is.50—0—0 for training in Revenue surveying in Bengal, may be paid at the rates noted against each. The youS^EeFlioFTFaFe~HrTIieir :, representations(copies enclosed) that they took advance of some money ^rom their Government against their salary and that probably for this reason their allowances have been fixed at the figures mentioned above. They however claim that they were assured by their Government through the Superintendent of Survey that all their expenses in India would be borne by their Government in addition to their salary. They have also approached this Government to move the Bahr ai n- 2 - *rv Bahrain Government to postpone recovery o^ the advance till they return to Bahrain. Their contention that the allowances sanctioned by the Bahrain Government are inadequate is not unreasonable. The Government of Bengal are not competent to offer any opinion on their requests, but they feel that their allowances need revision. Then they are living in Calcutta, the actual expenses per day for each are Food - Re.l - 4 - 0 (in a local hotel) House rent - 0 -13 - 6(Rs.2/8/-charged for 3 persons) % Tram hire - 0-5-6 'hashing etc - 0 - 1-0 Similarly in the mu^assil they find it difficult to maintain themselves on anything less than Rs.50/- per me'nsem each. m he Government of Bengal therefore consider that the rates of Rs.75/- per mensem in Calcutta and Rs.50/-per mensem in Camp which have been recommended by the Director o^ Land Records and Surveys, Bengal? are reasonable and do not admit of any reduction. 2. The youths have no return tickets with them and their passages to Bahrain via Bombay will have to be arranged by the Steamer leaving Bombay for Bahrain on the 2 4th March 1940. The total cost on account of the training of these youths including their return passages has been carefully estimated at Rs.1,838/- in round figures, the details of which are given in the enclosed statement. The estimate in subparagraph (f) in the statement has been made by the youths themselves. The railway fare to Bombay has been correctly estimated and the other charges are not unreasonable. It will be seen the statement that if the Bahrain Government can arrange the return passages amounting to Bs.123/- ^or these youths, this GovernmentGovernment will require no further remittance and will meet the deficit of Rs.15/- by cutting the allowances. If, however, the passages have to be arranged by this Government further remittance of a sum of Rs.138/- will be required ^rom the Bahrain Government to meet the entire cost. 3. I am to request that in the circumstances stated above the Bahrain Government may be moved to sanction the payment o' the monthly allowances to the youths at the increased rates viz. Rs.75/- per mensem each in Calcutta and hs.SO/- per mensem each in Gamp, and that this Government may be informed at a very early date what arrangements the Bahrain Government propose to make for their return passages.
