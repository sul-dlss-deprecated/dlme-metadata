It also includes a copy of the joint note issued to the Government of Persia by British and Russian ministers outlining the terms of the Anglo-Russian Advance (1912).This memorandum continues in a subsequent memorandum dated 1 September 1913 (see IOR/L/PS/18/C120c).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public debt</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00010d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
