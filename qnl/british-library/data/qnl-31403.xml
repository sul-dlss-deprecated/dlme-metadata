(WITH APPENDIX DATED 10TH JUNE 1919.)THL KHURMA DISPUTE BETWEEN KING HUSSEIN and ibn saud. N. GARLAKD, ARAB BUREAIJ. under Mohammed Aly in 1817, and which, since then, has existed mqribund state chiefly within the confines of Nejd. The tenets of the Ikhwan creed are very similar to those of Wahabism though its followers are without doubt more fanatical. To the non-Moslem' hou ever, it is the brutal methods of effecting conversions and of punishing sinners, rather than tne principles of the creed itself, that appear objectionable There is no doubt whatever that the Bedouin are systematically terrorised into conversion and that those who refuse are done to death. In w'ar the Ikhwan are said to take no prisoners but to cut the throats of all who fail into their hands. It has been stated repeatedly that Ibn Saud had no connection with the Ikhwan movement in its early stages, and this is probably true, but it is now sufficient for our present purposes to knowfirstly, that the sect originated close by his own capital and was allowed to flourish there, and its leading missionaries are his own subjects; secondly, that it is merely a desperately fanatical edition of Wahabism of which he is the acknowledged leader; and thirdly, that Ibn Saud has recently put himself at the head of the movement and will certainly not fail to use it for furthering his own ends. For the purposes of this review, therefore, it is unnecessary to differentiate between Ibn Saud and the Ikhwan or between the latter and the Wahabis. Since the first appearance of the Ikhwan, about 10, years ago, in the vicinity of the Nejd capital, Riadh, it 'has made rapid progress. It is practically certain that the whole of Nejd is Ikhwan and its missionaries have penetrated to all the corners of Arabia. But its doctrines are detested by all orthodox Moslems and the rulers of the Arab States surrounding Nejd (especially King Hussein) live in constant dread of its spread to their people. Khurma Dispute.—T liq present Khurma crisis has two causes : one religious, the other political. The religious cause is the King’s determination to stop Ikhwan sectarian propaganda in the Hejaz : the political cause is a dispute as to the actual ownership of the Khurma district. King Hussein has put forward a very good case in proof of his owner ship of Khurma, and this, after much delay, has received the support of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, but Ibn Saud, who bases his claims more upon the allegiance of the population of the Khurma district than on ownership of the actual ground, has agreed that the quarrel should be submitted to our arbitration. The territorial dispute has its origin in the conversion to Wahabism, in 1914 ), of the King’s local representative at Khurma, a Sherif named Khalid,§ i the King appointed Emir of Ktoma before the war- Kiag to whom the Ki g a rel)el and for four J m ^ Lls taxes hovftaten no step to rectify the P» sltl ® but they were arrested by ibere-.

The King stated that he was o occupy Khurma as Emir of the Ateibah tribe (Khurma is Ateibab termtory). Shakir’s force ultimately arrived at Marran. The next military incident was an attack by a loyal Ateibah sub-tribe (the Miqatah) under their Sheikh Skuleiwih, against the Ikhwan in Khurma, but they were utterly routed. This attack was probably, though not necessarily, instigated by Shakir. In August Shakir moved from Marran and met the Ikhwans at Hannu wells, 16 miles East of Khurma where his force was annihilated. It was reported that during the conflict one of the Ateibah tribal sections (the Kuqa) deserted en masse to the Ikhwan. Each side was blamed by the other as the aggressor in this action, but it was undoubtedly the result of Shakir’s advance from Marran, which may not, however, have been intended aggressively by him. Up to this time, Ibn Saud, pronouncing the King the aggressor in hr7ffi mC s de ih de v 01 T d Hi 56 res P 0Ilsible for bis men at Khurma,-though a ® rme d that he himself would not intervene.

The Indian view at that time was that it would be wrong for us to support the King in military action against our Treaty ally, Ibn Saud, and it was not until March 1919 that a message was sent by His Majesty’s Government to Ibn Saud “ advising him to modify his attitude and to persuade his followers from further opposition to the administrative measures of King Hussein at Khurma.” The fall of Medina in January 1919 left Abdullah free to set out on his long-cherished expedition to Khurma, which, he had often prophesied, would be over with the complete destruction of Ibn Saud’s forces within two days of his (Abdullah’s) arrival on the scene. It was feared by British advisers on both sides (Iraq and Egypt) that Abdullah’s ill-advised move must inevitably result in a collision of the rival forces and it is quite probable that had Abdullah remained in Medina the present crisis would not have arisen. Indeed, had we been aware of the Emir’s actual warlike intentions we should no doubt have strongly protested against the advance instead of merely suggesting the impropriety of it. Abdullah’s regular force consisted of 60 officers, 770 other ranks, ten guns and twenty machine guns. It reached Asheira early in April ? As soon as he heard of Abdullah’s move from Medina, Ibn Saud began counter-preparations. He certainly warned His Britannic Majesty’s Government of these, and, reasserting his wish for arbitration, stated that he was compelled by pressure of public opinion to take measures against aggression by the Sherifian troops. . “ If the Kin^ and Abdullah will remain in their own places,” he said, “I will remain in mine.” But although we looked upon Abdullah’s advance as unwise and foolhardy and advised him not to start, we do not, and cannot, deny his right to occupy Khurma. The next military incident was a raid by Ikhwan (as reported by Abdullah) on lovalists at Degheibiah early in May 1919. The raiders were pursued by a detachment of Abdullah’s who failed to overtake them but intercepted and defeated a second party, said to be ^ route to attack a Sherifian post at Madarmah. About the same date another detachment of Ikhwan was attacked at Badheim bv a patrol of Abdullah’s and routed, whilst sleeping, by a hand grenade bombardment. Of these raids we have not yet received reports from On May 21st Abdullah reported that, after two and a half hours fig^mg i Tnrnbah and that, after consolidating it, he would ad\ance to he occuf ■ report Abdullah stands self-condemned.

And, further, they are just as vulnerable to the proselytising methods of the Ikhwan as the other tribes, and at a critical moment might go over en masse to the oppssite side. The Ikhwan menace will not cease when the present crisis is over. Aeroplane defence of Taif and Mecca can be but temporary, even if its moral effects (combined with our political pressure on Ibn Sand) are great enough to stall Ikhwan aggression, but directly our aeroplanes are withdrawn the pro- Kejd tribes on the frontier will recommence their raids and the safetv of the Holy Places will depend on— (1) The maintenance of a regular force by the King.

GARLAND, Captain.7 V ' f Note on thi Khurma Dispute.” Appendix. Latest Information. it is worthy of note that, although they had had previous warning of the night attack, the . ^ ' ‘.7 ^ v iuuo warning ui tut? ill gilt atwiua, i^uc regular officers who got away did so in their night attire. It was ever one of the Baghdadi Officer s maxims not to allow military duties to interfere with his night's rest, and during tae w ar, outposts, picquets, and the like were invariably dispensed with by the Hejaz armies. The 10,000 Bedouin originally reported to be with Abdullah seem to have melted away and, as Colonel Bassett remarks, “ everything points to the majority of the tribal elements which profess allegiance to King Hussein being absolutely unreliable/'’ A consoling feature is that the captors of the guns, etc., have no followers trained in their manipulation and employment. In spite of the King’s assertion that Ibn Saud reinforced Tarabah and Khurma, with a view to attacking Abdullah, no enemy advance from Tarabah is reported. Abdullah, according to the King, is now “ remaining on the defensive/’ but both he and the King fear an advance by Ibn Saud on Taif and Mecca. • It is thought, however, that Ibn Saud will now rest content with his success and his reoccupation of Tarabah. He has common-sense enough to realize that any further advance towards the Hejaz Cities would mean sacrificing our friendship, subsidy and help, and he must realize that we possess the means to punish him even if he knows the King does not. It seems probable that His Britannic Majesty’s G-overnment’s orders to withdraw from Tarabah will have the desired effect when he gets them. The fact that the Ikhwan have not advanced from Tarabah since they recaptured it, tends to show that Ibn Saud has them under some sort of control and if the more fanatical elements had intended to raid Taif without his authority they would surely have moved towards it by this time. On the arrival of our aeroplanes, the King will no doubt insist on immediate punitive bombing raids on Tarabah, Khurma and other Ikhwan camps, but it appears necessary that the possible results of such action should be well considered befpre undertaking it. From everv point of view it will be infinitely better if Ibn Saud can be compelled to withdraw by political pressure from Baghdad, as aeroplane bombing would increase the hatred and ill-will between Nejd and Mecca, would render future reconciliation more difficult, would henceforth affect the hospitality extended to British official travellers through Nejd, and might quite conceivably precipitate a wholesale conflagration, besides possibly forming matter (suitably distorted) for Indian anti-Sherifian propaganda. One feels constrained, therefore, to suggest that the aeroplanes should be reserved entirely for defence purposes, in case of an ad /ance by Ikhwan from their present posi tions. And, if Ibn Saud retires personally from Khurma district, it would be wisest for the Kino* to refrain from occupying it until the boundary dispute is settled by our arbitration. ThelKino- will, of course, denounce this as a mere maintenance of the defensive policy, which, according to his views, is at the root of the present trouble, but. he should realize by this time that armies incapable of carrying out successful offensives have no alternative to keeping to defensive measures. It is obvious that the settlement by us of the boundary between Nejd and the Hejaz is .one of the Arabian affairs claiming our prompt attention and it ought not to be much longer delayed. The military position at Khurma today (10th June 1919) is as follows:— Ibn Saud is said to be at Tarabah and his force probablf amounts to 20,000 Bedouin, pf which some are posted 10 miles W. of Tarabah. Emir Abdullah has collected from his original force a remnant of about 3,000 Bedouin at Okheidir 250 semi-trained regulars have left Mecca under Sagh.

Tasked 'Much stronger', he replied., I gathered that he alluded to a definite and successful attempt on Ibn Sa , ud ? s part to establish his supremacy in Eastern Arabia. Two months before the fight at Tarabah, Ibn Sa»ud sent round a madhbatah to all the settled population of Najd. In this he said that he should claim from them in % future not only ’adabi (customary service) but alsi Shar f i.

They replied with one voice that he was the Imam and that they had no rights against him. This means that he has established his position as a religious as well as a political leader. Kansur recited the text of the adhbatah. it was fine and dignified declaration, .yhile he was away at Khurmah, Shisal al Duwish took the opportunity to extend hie claims.

Nine months ago Emir Abdullah’s regular army of about 250 men was costing, in pay alone, £4,000 per month. In addition to this peculation, gold sovereigns have been melted up by thousands and converted into fancy swords, daggers, etc., for distribution broad cast as presents to paltry Sheikhs and slaves, and as sops to potential enemies. Much money has been spent by the King and his sons on propaganda in the Iraq, Yemen and Syria. Erom the earliest days of. the revolt the Bedouin have been unreasonably overpaid, a simple Bedouin receiving £3 per month for his personal services and £3 extra for his camel. There is a story going round, too, of a gold tea service which is said to have Been made at Mecca at a cost of £10,000 for use in the Royal House,, To those British officers who witnessed something of the misuse of British subsidies and who are still unconvinced that the results are commensurate with the outlay, the recent progressive reduction of the King’s monthly subsidy of £100,000, by monthly decrements of £25,000 in October, November and December, brought so great a feeling of relief that they may have overlooked the fact that the future of the Hejaz is a question closely affecting British interests and one calling urgently for consideration. In establishing the i ew Hejaz State His Majesty’s Government incurred a moral responsibility for its future and even had they not given King Husein a written promise to assist him in every way and to provide advisers (which he agreed to accept) it would still be in their own interests to take steps to secure and maintain a sound government in his Kingdom. The importance of the pilgrimage to the Empire has been dealt with too often already to need further emphasis here. Further, the Hejaz has not been properly explored and there may yet be more gold in Midian than the intrusive deposits now lying beneath the tents of the Bedouin. Oil is rumoured to exist on the Red Sea coast and other places, whilst there are many native stories of the existence of metals of all kinds in the neighbourhood of laif. Eighty per cent, of the Hejaz imports are received from India whilst a recent report from Mecca contains the surprising statement that halt the popu lation of Mecca is Indian. These are important facts. . ■From every pent of view therefore-it appears desirable that King Husein .houid recefve future financial aid from us, but we know well that he cannot be trusted to use fubds properly or to lead his country towards prosperity without trustea to use tunas prop ^ h Q keeps and ladles out the subsidy. guidance.

His worst faults are hi iSof progressiveness. and his desire to keep all the Government in his own unskilled and erratic hands. . i pj. tt • The withdrawal of the Turkish officials from the He 3 az left the Hejaz without skilled administrators, advisers or technical assistants. King Husem failed to renlace the maiority of them from other sources, hut, as a rule, has appointediUiterateand^untmstworthy natives of the Hejaz to the various posts. The result is that Civil Administration has made practically no headway and very few improvements of real import have been introduced. Indeed, it is to he feared that the Arab, edition of the Turkish system in all its worst ramifications which Husein has set up is a cause of alarm to the greater number of the citizens of his country. The King has been inclined to spend too much on his regular army and his rivalry with Ibn Saud has undoubtedly led him into further heavy ex penses. The time has now arrived, however, for him to be told that he really requires only a very small army. (1) A small mobile force (in which machine gun power should replace rifle srength), for dealing with recalcitrant tribes, and (2) small garrisons for the defence of Medina, Mecca and the railway. A force on the following lines would probably meet his requirements :— Mountain Guns. Infantry or M. I. Machine Guns. Mecca and Taii ...... 6 300 « 10 Medina 6 300 10 Railway . . , 2* 800 60 Mobile Column 4 300 6 Total 18 1,700 76 * On n-rmnnwail Say a total of 2,500 including officers to ordnanop and The monthly pay list of an armv of tln'o an , ^ u PPty services, etc. £12,000. 5 0t tbls str9n S tb wultl amount to about3 (IP/ For the defence of the Railway the King should depend more upon the subsidies to the Bedouins than upon armed force. He has the following tribes to placate south of Maan H uweitat Beni Atiyeh . Billi and Moliab Juheinah Harb 70 miles of line. IbO do. 150 do. 70 do. 50 do. Bor this purpose he will have to make small monthly pay mentis to the Sheikhs of the above tribes in the same way as did the Turks, who it is under stood spent about £T.500 per mensem on this service. The King’s fears of aggression by Ibn Baud will not be allayed until the dispute over Khurma has been arbitrated on by us. Indeed, until the bounda ries of the Hejaz have been definitely fixed and our treaties with the various Arab rulers concluded, King Husein will have an ample supply of pretexts at hand for keeing up a larger regular army than he can afford. The King should, I think, be reminded of the revised Arab Policy of His Majesty’s Government and, at the first opportunity, should be advised that our help, financial and otherwise, is contingent on his confining his activities to the Hejaz and on his abstention from all propaganda in the Arab territories outside his sphere. He should be made to understand that our funds aie not given him for political intrigues and conspiracies outside the Hejaz or for arming for anything but defence. T nm further of oninion that, once the subsidy to Peisal has ceased, we should a which King Husein must now lay out considerable sums of money (1) Improvements in the Quarantine stations at Jeddah, Yenbo and one on the Railway. (2) Repairs to Railway and renewal of rolling stock. (8) Water supplies at the large towns. (4) A road from Jeddah to Mecca. The present local sources of income to the Hejaz Govern out as follows :— (1) Quarantine dues. (2) Railway receipts. (3) Postal receipts (and probably cable). (4) Customs receipts. (5) Wakfs.In Eeypt there will he at the end o the ^'.7has been about £d3,000 of Wakf momes o approx i ma tel y £10,000 sent during the war The yearly contr. u^ a Medina^ for Watfs and about for the - P obviousl cann ot be regarded m any the Hejaz Railway aid t^ 6 r ®“® ,[ an( j ^he small stock of engines, extensive damage was done to the line, ana «e etc., must now be sufficiently worn ou^as M^req^ ^ Kailway Lt winH-rVunder 1 the Turks, who, by means of their conscript *as a paymg ^ OQY , lTr but the Arab Government will certainly army, ran it very cheaply, find it an expensive luxury but tne Arao uuvexuujouu their skilled labour will have to be imported • 1 1-1 1 * 1 4 ~ find it an expensive luxury . rntn saincu and their working costs will be considerably higher than were those of- the Turks, It is therefore very doubtful whether a separate loan purely for railway purposes and secured against Ilailway receipts would be feasible. ^Moreover, Eailway receipts would be difficult to check and supervise should the lending Government find it necessary to intervene at any time. The possibility of Commercial Syndicates taking concessions to repair and w r ork the Eailway, water systems, etc., should not be overlooked. Such a course would probably be preferred by His Majesty’s Government, but private firms would have to be satisfied with the receipts from their enterprises and could not be allowed to have any lien on the Customs revenue which must be reserved as security for British Government loans, etc. It is probable that the firms would ask for guarantees from His Majesty’s Government before embark ing on business in the Hejaz : this might be done. It may perhaps be possible to issue part of our loan in kind, in the form of locomotives, rolling stock, machinery and material for Quarantine, Post and other purposes. In order that a reliable estimate may be made of the future financial needs of the Hejaz, it is suggested that an expert should be sent there to report on the existing financial conditions, and on improvements which could be made towards increasing the Government receipts. He would enquire into the present administration of revenue earning departments and ascertain the rates of the dues and taxes actually levied at present and would further report on the actual yearly receipts from these sources so that their values as security against a loan may be appraised. He would further report on the extent to which Wakf contributions may legally be used in the development 'fth^ MeccI h lnf C Me(hMT t andTrLmm a en^ 0 th e S’he ai h M .

Ibn Saud at present receives £5,000 per month, but doubt less this will be reduced. It is considered that King Husein’s stipend should, m any case, be greater than that of Ibn Saud. In the present state of uncertainty as to the outcome of the negotiations now proceeding for the settlement of Arabian and Syrian territories, it is dimcult to foresee what share King Husein will have in future in Arab rule outside the Hejaz proper, and particularly how far he will have to provide or assist civil Government, railway administration, etc., north of Maan. Our present discussions with him might, however, he based on the assumption that his activities will be confined to the Hejaz Province as it existed under Turkish regime and that the financial assistance now contempla ted is for the development of that area only, the districts of Khurma and Qunfudah being for the time being excluded. It is very important that the Hejaz boundaries should be fixed at an early date, more especially those between Nejd and Asir as King Husein will certainly continue to heavily bribe the tribes on and across his borders in order to influence their allegiance until we are in a position to instruct him that his activities must be confined within the recognized Hejaz boundaries, and that we will not countenance any encroachments or external propaganda by him. Attached is a Budgetary Statement prepared by Colonel Wilson in April last. It was compiled from certain figures supplied by the King but several items were estimated by Colonel Wilson personally, e.g., items 5, 6 and 11. Although according to the King’s figures the expense include those of quarantine, water supply, Tax Departments, Harbour Masters, post offices, etc.,, no revenues are included from any of these services, the King s list only showing the receipt of £15,000 per month from Customs. Also, with regard to the £3,000 per month shown as expenditure for the Medina-Maan railway, no Railway receipts are shown. The cost of personnel for Medina would appear to he overestimated as it amounts to over three-quarters of that for Mecca, Tail and Jeddah .combined. £3 000 per month for hire of camels from Yanbo to Medina also seems an excessive item, as it is presumed most of the material to be transported will be merchandise at the owner’s expense. A total of £27*000 per month for Army expenditure also seems more than the King can afford. , The King in his statement also included large sums for his Ministry o Wakfp and the Haram employ^ (£1,000 per month) imams, and for the rTlief for sick and needy, all of which it is thought should form a leg.trmate charge against W r akfs revenues. , , . „ The statement is very incomplete and not a ' t ’of re- TOW A month.

I have a kind of informal understanding with Dr. Harrison that he*will give me due warning of any projected visit m case I have any objection to it, while I will not stand in his way without some reason. I may mention that the sanction of higher authority has been obtained to the visits to Qatif, Iliyadh, and Abu Dhabi/ I personally believe that Dr. Harrison’s attitude towards Great Britain is quite friendly, but I am sure that the attitude of some of the other mission aries whom I have met is not friendly at heart, and any individual whose feelings are m any way anti-British has great opportunities for mischief owing to the influence the mission exercise through their hospital, school, and, most difficult to discover or combat, the visits of the lady missionaries to the harems. It appears that the Arabian Mission, in common I believe with other American Missions, has been informed by the United States Government that, if any one of their number causes trouble in connection with the war, the •Not received. whole of that Mission will have to go ' ■ (reported in my memorandum* No, 772 of August j.bth 1917), which disposes of the matter for the period of the war. I think that touring by the Political Agent to places visited by mission aries would help to prevent their influence becoming inconveniently great, but to discourage any tendency to disseminate anti-British ideas after the war l venture to suggest that it might be feasible to come to some agreement with the United States Government to the effect that the Arabian Mission should be warned that Great Britain holds a special position in the Persian Gulf, and that, if complaints are received from the British Government of mission aries being guilty of conduct to the prejudice of British interests, they will be liable to removal I am inclined to think that the United States Government would listen to such a request with sympathy, as their attitude towards missionary work, though in the past distinctly cordial is now, I understand, the reverse owing to their own unfortunate experiences in the Philippine Islands, Copy to Civil Commissioner Baghdad.

Please see attached copy of a memorandum No. 49-C. of 20th February '1918 by Political Agent, Bahrain, on the subject of the movements of the American Mission. I have discussed the subject with Captain Loch, and it appears that the matter is complicated by the fact that the Branch Mission at Bahrain appears to have no definitely recognised head who could give an undertaking binding on all the other members. I am not sure whether the Secretary to the Mission now, I believe, at Basrah can give such an undertaking or not If so, it appears to me advisable to discuss the question with him, pointing out that with the gradual improvement of conditions in the interior it is possible that members of the Mission may desire to do more touring than m the past, and it seems necessary, in view 6f the fact that any mishap to any European or American must necessarily react on the general safety of all foreigners, to ask for a definite engagement to consult the Political Agent Bahrain, before any Xticular journev has been undertaken. This would only formalise and ren- tier more binding the informal understanding mentioned by Caj-tain Loch as eristTn- between him and Dr. Harrison.

With, reference to correspondence ending with your telegram No. 691 * of 26th May 1918, regarding the visit of Not received. fly p Harrison of the Arabian Mis sion to Qatar. I have the honour to inform you that Dr. Harrison left on the 28th ultimo accompained by the Hererend G. J. Pennings. I might mention that I was not aware that the Reverend G. J. Pennings intended accompanying Dr. Harrison, and in fact did not even know he had gone until several days after his departure. The whole thing seemed, in my opinion, to savour of secrecy, as not one of the missionaries breathed a word of his intention, theugh they must have known something^ about it. When Dr. Harrison raised the question of visiting Qatar and Darin Mr. Pennings was present, but never said a word. I received a note from Mrs. Harrison the day her husband left, specially written to inform me of his departure, but she even, did not mention the fact that Mr. Pennings had also gone. A short while ago I had an opportunity of personally interviewing the ■etary to the Shaikh of Qatar, and I cautiously pumped him regarding the ™ . 1 “; si nanes to Qatar, and he revealed the interesting fact tha the Shaikh was always being pestered with letters from them solicitin invitations. He added that of course they had no objection to the visit °t Ue medical fraternity because incidentally they' did a certai- “rttfer' begged for invitations.

X sent for him to Agency, as hie movements seemed suspicious. He told me affairs in mainland of Oman were not satisfactory and that people were anxious that Bin Baud should rule over them, as his forefathers did.

X finQ a consideraole feeling of hostility to ourselves tlue to religious, economical, personal and war reasons, assisted in a negative way by the missionaries. Also there is a considerable party hostile to the Shaikh and consequently to ourselves. In contrast to this I find no British party and a general lack of touch especially with those hostile to ourselves. Proposed remedy ( 1 ) Half-monthly: majlis to explain any qiatter of importance, to act as a vent for public opinion, to hear grievances and to bring the Agent into closer touch with British subjects and Foreigners. 2. More entertaining especially of those hostile or supposedly so ; updo the present these have been excluded from association with the Agency! This I hold to he wrong policy,. as an odd word may give warning of trouble, or a sentence enable an action to be anticipated. 3. The definite formation of a British party by indirect methods, such as rewards, w r hieh you have kindly agreed to, by closer association, and by visits, by letters of appreciation from yourself or Mr. Bill, in really deserved instances, through schools, presents and literature. (b) The extraordinary backwardness of the place considering its long- association with ourselves. X propose to improve the water supply I already promised. To get electrical plant. ) 1 Start the municipality on sound lines ; at present it is only a pretence. Import fruit trees suitable to climate and soil and trees.

Prom—(1. H. Bill, Esq;, Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, To-LiBOTENsHT-goLONEL A. T. Wosos,- C.I.E., D.S.O., C.M.G., Officiating Political Resident, Persian Qulf, Baghdad. &amp; Bray’s demi-official of May 27th raises a large question of principle, which applies not only to Bahrein, or evijn to Nejd, but to the whole of the territories bordering on the Persian Gulf. It i s a question to which I have given much thought, and the issue may be fairly stated as follows 1 Hitherto the historic role of the British Government in these water* h-s been that of keeper ot the Maritime Tmop -pAfii ^ wie&amp;e waters lic*s to predominanee in the Persian fsif ^ r y 19Cen t times our claims performanoesdwthe rdie mentienS.

It is a' very arguable position, which is by no means without attraction to my mind that Jhe is, though an animal, a fairly happy animal, and that the heady wine of Western civilisation may merely turn him into a discontented decadent, ^and, such a policy accords very ill with the present trend €t P° ilc y m lndia ? and in particular with the sentiments of the Montagu. Chelmsford Report, and would stand little chance'of deliberate adoption” I should think, by the Powers that be, if they were brought face to face with it. In any case, it is desirable to do this; to bring them face to face with it and make it clear that we can either let the Arab continue to dream out his low life, or we can set ourselves to create in him a divine discontent. In any case, let us know what we are doing. A sordid, but weighty detail, in favour of the former policy is that the latter is bound to cost a good deal of money, and there is not the remotest chance that anything in the nature of schools or hospitals will be self-supporting in these tracts. It is much more likely, except, I think, in Bahrein, that any such efforts will be met with a stolid, and solid, opposition, as tending to interfere with cherished institutions, such as the sectarianism of the Wahabi and Omani, and the possession of diving slaves. So much for the question of principle; if we are to let things aloim, the enthusiastic local officer, like Bray, must be if devout American citizens like to spend discouraged, and informed that their dollars enlightening the - -x: n o ~ Bahreini, it is no concern of ours, and in any case we are not going to enter into competition with them at Government expense. In the same way we should leave Shaikh Abdulla Bin Jasim of Qatar, and all the petty Shaikhs of the trucial coast, and their subjects, as much alone as we do at present. Assuming, however, that the alternative policy is deliberately accepted with its necessary financial consequences, I sketch below what I conceive might be the lines of development in each sphere. I take Bahrein first, an actually and potentially the most important, and as the subject of Bray’s letter. Setting aside for the moment his projects for an active competition with the American missionaries, his proposals for permaneat institutions are— (a) A municipality run on sound lines,’ J i.e., in the present state * pf Bahrein, on lines approved by the Agency, the running of the machine being also N carefully, if at the same time quietly and tactfully, supervised by the Political Agent. % - (&amp;) A school, obviously on the same lines. Prom the standpoint now adopted, these proposals are obviously sound; I would go further and say they are indispensable, if the Bahrein is to be raised in 5 the scale of Western civilisation, Tl is also true that though there will be more people in Bahreini who •i, we i oom e these developments than anywhere else, still there will _ be an will welcome . _ l B aT » s e 6 ti ma te of the American activities is actively hostile^party. or, it Bry ^ Islamic ooaser vatism, and that of correct, even tw ” §&gt; 0 me et these, and create an atmosphere favourable PWnda work will Questionably be t! it T,resent regard the case against the American Mission as proved ; , .i d ?Qm t CsTdei it certain that their attitude, which was first noted that is, I do not com f f loeal idiosyhcracies rather than to the delibe- SSB’iSKKrfc* «*•* Mt last, certainly goes ^ow that tl the State Department is not paying very the state ^ notice ttat t ij e m June last, ceriamijr • re p-i 0 I i, xou wm --- *. close attention to the atiairs Basrah, is included by them i whole ot the Persian Gulf, iBcludmg mises no t to transgress the laws British India,’’and the American subject p. gtate ^ whioh ,he American of British India while residing m i b inclined to attribute the extra Government itself has a treaty.

However, the always understood to 1 » defin. Islamic conservative could propaganda work undertaken to win ovei we u. eouallv well sorye to conciliate all classes. , j j a O ne caution i the most conservative Arab on th ' ^’^^ “titude kteS Shaikh Isa himself • he certainly seems to have mouified ms attimae Jaiei}, but I amnot sure that he would quite swallow the new municipalny. In any case, his susceptibilites would have to be very carefully consideied. Shaikh Abfiulla’s visit to Europe should certainly yield very valuable results in this direction, if his mind is not too crowded with impressions, avc.l if be can avoid exciting the jealousy of his brotners on his return. It is little use saying anything about Nejd and Hasa under present circumstances. As far 'as I understand the situation, the fact is now well m the fire, and we can only wait for the results. However it w'&amp;uld do no harm at all for Biay to go deeply into the question of machine pumps, and bring cut pots of good literature on the subject. If the present crisis gives birth to anything like a really stable government in Persia, I have plenty of projects of the kind. As regards the steam tug I am writing to you separately. The above covers the ground as regards Bahrein, I think. The net result is that assuming the new policy, all that is necessary is money for propaganda work, with a view to the establishment, as soon as possible, of a good school and a strong municipality. Bray s othqr desiderata are points of detail. Next to Bahrein, we have Qatar and the Trucial Coast. I should 'be in clined to deal with them together, as they are in the same stage of primitiveness and the Po’itical Agent, Bahrein, will have his,hands full w T ith Bray’s programme* I he first condition ot any advance in those regions is the establishment of 'a Political Agency, at suggested by Sir Percy at intervals from 1911 to the out- bieak of war. 1 ou doubtless remember the Zora correspondence; Zora was event ually abandoned, but every year on the approach of the cold weather Sir Percy asked whether the post and telegraph scheme for Debai could be proceeded with, and every year some reason was iounfi which prevented action till the approach ot the hot weather Government never, as far as I can discover agreed to ^g^butinhis despatch No. 1112 of’sotk April f„ c( .' , ,, \ . ,~ 7 \ itdl v &gt; an on is aifiicult to imagine anvthmo- as “ the iest except the establishment of a regular mu as . e that New might run over occasional!x ^ u* v , S J ' at3 ^ ime ' was unsatisfactory compromise. * ' ^ 1 Lmgail i I regard this as a very There would be no practical difficulty that I can see if itm ro*fi ,h,‘. 8 ~S, S SSaTh', “ a W’O were about to open up a 'post and f Q i Q d gree i nent ’ an(i nC) central spot, 'this communication would^B 0!Ece I&gt;ebai, as the Deputy in the “ Lawrence, ’’ and the s Mn ! ’- v the Resident or arrive the same day. 1 here would he a w gmS th !

Memorandum No. 6 -C., dated Bahrein, the 5fch January 1920. (Secret.) From— Major H. K. V. Dickson, C.I-E., Political Agent, Bahrein, nv f The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. °””BThe Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, The attached note on the existing political situation in Bahrein is for warded. for information, , The note is compiled from close personal study and observation of the people of Bahrein during the last two months, also for valuable material left behind by my predecessor Captain N. K E. Bray, M.C. ote on the political situation in Bahrein as existing at the end of 1919, with suggestions and proposals for improving the situation. \ I arrived in Bahrein on November 6th, 1S19, and since my arrival I have ken wains to try and get at the bottom of the curious atmosphere of aosti- v which seems to exist everywhere in Bahrein for the foreigner and more oeciallf towards the Agency. To accomplish my purpose I have spent much ne interviewing persons, great and small, and have taken special care to get f. ‘ ~ ? ° f -nprvnlp bv frequent visits and dinner parties at the houses the confidence ofpeople Mutral , Sunrdand Shiah. I have 3 Xttily helped 3 Sl f fS W The general nclusions that I have arrived at are enumerated below. 2 ‘ W ThVpoScaTatmosphere of Bahrein while not in any way dangerous (b) Theresa Itrong anti-British,sentiment which is long standing and (c) British’ prestige rests on entirely false standards, nameiy on lear ana &gt;“!^ 3 l hoth extremely difficult, vet iterative.10 al Khalit*^ Imust perforce give a rou-u ^ . g &amp; ^ ru ]e r , at the to convey^he true atmosphere S t0 ourselves and means extremely to com Y li e he ls a very loyal tnena G u e ither personal oi tor same time I letter that he writes to myse e pleasure, well hy to g{ s Majesty’s Government gi^ ^ them and boast “frC oi ««»;?*■ ' £ attempting to assert his suppose! ? , p v discernable intentions. ments by puerile' methods and east} vices is easy of expiana ion. a a ' Ttn honest one, that we may ourse. ve.’ Ph both Jlfor ^eciaTconsideration and partly Son mmSulto them, with the constant dread that their freedom maybe still‘further curtailed. _ (ii) Pride, which is equally part of the Arab character, encourages t ie to acts that will gain them renown, however small, m,the eyes ot their com patriots, and makes them equally averse to surrender an action once committed, or an attitude once assumed. Pride of comparison hears a rea. part in tiien line of thought, that is to say, their own power compared to that exercised by other Arab rulers, and the fear of loss of prestige in any curtailment o,. their powers in the eyes of other rulers. / (Hi) Suspicion, which, as I said above,^ is an inherent vice or virtue, depending on the standpoint of regard in the constitution ot Arab minds, and which always exists in the minds oi a more or less primitive people, its degree depending on the extent of their backwardness, as a wild animal de pends on suspicion, whilst a domesticated depends on its confidence, for its com fort and well being, ' B—Dishonest opposition. This we may take for granted comes in no inconsiderable extent from those opposition to Shaikh Isa himself; mainly from his cousins Ali Ibrahim ashid the sons of Mahomed ai Khalifah who was formerly deposed by us and ’ a t -f.! rta! t n ( 1 , ex r ent £r r -b heir pre^l'tive. Quite apart from the natural utility ot tne former family to ourselves for ousting their clan (hamoula) from ie succession ana tneir natural rights, it may be easily understood how Uiev would aoniy too ready to advise Shaikh ’Isa to take a line of action tfiai will Mg him m opposition to ourselves, Eor they aim at noth e Shaikh himself, and clumsy diplomats cease from attemntim? to ey hope and never nothing as will less than8 11 prestige no less interesting and no less delicate. 'For here in the game and the material for the edifice of hostility. We will divide them into two classes A—The Gqvernment officials ; B—The notables of the Islands. A—-Like all Government officials of an oriental State, we may expect to find abase of authority and extortion, but unlike most oriental States in such close relationship to a European Bower, we may he justly grieved to find that these exceed all bonds of propriety and sense of justice, so much so as to call forth the odium oi the Arabs themselves. The Amirs or Governors of the towns of Muharraq and Manama are officials entirely unsuited for control, and the power they wield is oppressive and immoral. The Amir of Manama encourages and receives an income from prostitutes and gamblers, impresses boat and donkey transport in a shameless manner and generally extorts money from householders, shopkeepers and the people as a whole. - The Amirs of Muharraq is little better, and would be equally as bad, were fee not more or less under the supervision of the Shaikh who resides therefor the greater part of the year. The Amirs being men of this stamp, it is not surprising that the “lidawis (police) and officials under them follow their lead. This being so, it is obvious that any measure of reform is at once opposed by these gentlemen, and intrigues set on foot to prevent them being carried out, ^ JB—The Notables of the Island.—Oi these 25 per cent, are friendly to a greater or less degree, while 75 per cent, are definitely hostile. I will attempt to describe the more important of them further on in this note, but for the present I will confine myself to anticipating the causes of our unpopularity in a general way before coming to details. These causes we may study under three headings (i) War, {ii) Normal, (m) Individual. (i) War. (a) Economical .-—The necessary restrictions due to the war have^ hit the Island hard as in most other places., The prohibition of the export of silver and restrictions as to the export of rice from India during 1919 especially have caused acute hardship and discontent, but except where these have been taken advantage of by ill-disposed persons they should be speedily corrected or erradicated by the return of normal conditions, when present prohibition prices will fall and normal trade be resumed. Our efforts then must be directed to the removal as soon as possible of trade restrictions made necessary by the war.13 10 . Mahomed bin Hamad al Qazi 11. Salaiman bin Hamad al Bassam !.«.

Action proposed to improve on the situation, (a). To meet and defeat these various difficulties, an energetic and open handed policy is immediately imperative. For in my opinion with so much cheap sentimentaiity at large in the world to-day, sue to catch phrases used for political purposes both during the wor’d war and throughout the period of the Armistice, men’s minds, especially those of orientals, are apt to fasten on unrealities rather than on /attfs of the outcome of the world conflagration. These ephemeral ideas are greedily fastened on to by the astute Arab mind and especially by those unfriendly to us, and if British prestige is not to sufier, I submit a change of manner in dealing with these people is essential. And the primary duty of a Political Officer in these serious times is to break away from the fetters of the past and enter a wider and freer sphere of political thought lest British domina tion or control appear weak-kneed and sentimental. Added to this the general upset due to the war, the doubts and uncertainties, propaganda and dislocation of trade with its necessary hardship necessitates infusing energy and wideness of vision into our work in order to lead minds unbalanced by recent events into same channels. ( 5 ) A closer touch with individuals, who have the least influence in educating public opinion, with the closest possible study of their individuality and especially, if hostile, their reasons for hostility. The Political Officer must be the doctor of his charge and know accurately the medicine required for each of his patients. It is impossible for tbe senior political officers to have leisure to -do this except in the case of men of real importance, but so well should they be sured by their junior lieutenants that the exact tune and mentality of any particular place can be clearly and accurately sounded. I must be pardoned if I appear to generalize, I am writing a note on Bahrein and the moiniand under it, (in a junior sense) and I purposely write at ^length so that one’s superior officers may themselves feel tne atmosphere as I feel it, and as I am about to ask for support, to give my fullest reasoning. I have started, there fore* a list of every important and fairly important personage m the place, I intend to meet them frequently to study them individually. A short visit of a few hours Biay easily change an enemy mfara friend. I need, not emphasise this aspect of political dealing, that gained an Empire a hundred years ago, but has creatly fallen into disuse to our disavantage, mainly through pressure of office work To the above end I have set apart four days in each week tor Xng purposes. The hours selected are from 5-30 pm. to 7 P.M. between subset prayer and the Arab’s dinner hour.Hal and I intend to M Entertainment and ^^f c f there'rumou® may b 0 '‘ioS- s^s^gSlHS|rf£i matters, hnl also m his P«'^ elf ’^ - ther eIore, instituted a 'veeh y citizenship becomes something to mm abov are £ree to come (Monday) Darbar or Mhyhs at which all or any j and res e . and will be serred with light ^e^eshment to actioll can be They will be enconraged to spea . mu ^ channel I hope firstly to gain “■ “ 4 ^ l Mueation.-ne Political Officer ^ .hope ^ literal sense, yet edncation on s0 ^ n ^ predecessor’s proposal to have is to be rectified.

While not cheapening he higher decorations and distinctions, we may by a generous distribution ot to* less imposing*ones gain many friends and encourage honest endeavour. Ulten have I heard the Arab cry that he has served faithfully 10 or 20 years, buo ha&amp; received nothing, while his less deserving but intriguing brother has been rewarded in some incomprehensible manner. fi\ Tr...

I do not deny that we have and do give presents, hut a judicious increase in this respect will help us- greatly, foreign firms were very generous in this respect, with excellent results to themselves, and we as a Government should be no less generous. (i) Letters of appreciation or thanks are treasured and have their weight, and occasional letters from the Senior Political Officer go a very long way to cementing a friendship. An instance of this I saw only last week when in public Darbar Sheikh' Abdul Latif al Dosari of Budaiyeh pulled out a black edged letter written him by Sir Percy Cox, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., on the occasion of the late King Edward’s death. He paraded this letter with a great show and obviously placed a very high value on it. He insisted on reading it ovei twice to his audience.

In view of he the recent correspondence and reports which have been v ry kindly forwarded to me on the Internal po itics of Arabia with special reference to the state of affairs in Nejd and the Hejaz, a few remarks on the opinions held in these parts of the world* on these matters may be of Interest and value. Cut off tho i^h Muscat is, it is yet the recipient of much Arabian news and gossip. Many travellers visit it, and historically it has had a long If unpleasant connection with Hejd. Recently I have had the oportunity of conversation with travellers recently returned both from Nejd and froa the Hejaz, and though I do not for a moment regard their information as reliable, it is neverthe less informative as representing what I know is a very widely held view, a view which up to the present does not seem to have received expression in the voluminous correspon dence on the subject. (1) The Akhwan movement and Bin Saoud. The Akhwan are regarded generally as Moslem an! Arabian Bolsherlca, not of course in any way connected . .. in their avowed intentionioy truckle to tae Aknwan, anl the beat way he can do this in by becoming their leader. But noone is better aware than he that at any moment the Akhwan amy get beyond his control. Tuen If ae does not bend it la all over as' far aa he la cone rnei* This universal praise of Bin Saoui is therefore due to two reasons, '’lie first, that outside the British G-overmaent he is the only restraining influence on the Akhwan, the second the respect which he inspires as actually the only man of character and power in Arabia, It is openly said that the subsidy which he xft&amp;oix receives from H.MGr. he spends entirely on food for the Aknwan, and that were to stop this subsidy Bin Saoud would no longer be able to control them. His oftquotei remark that did he not fear God and respect the British Government he would have long ago driven the Sharif into the sea is probably not far off the truth. It is not for me to press the possibility of the truth or otherwise of this view of the Akhwan movement and Bin Saoui, except that to the outsider n seems eminently reasonable. It does bring however into exceptional prominence what I venture to submit should never be lost sight of in Arabian olitics, the overwhelming Importance of the personal factor. It may be said that the stability of the present status quo, or of any arrangement teat may be arrived at at the proposed meeting, depends upon the personal Influence of Bln Saoud over the Akhwan, and the fact th t he is known to be friendly to us and to be amenable to our advice, vere anything to happen to Bln Saoud there would be noone -ho would have the power even If he ahad the inclination to rs strain t»h6 AKhw&amp;n* 3) King Hussein arritne Hejaz. It must be rememb r d that Muscat has never been m the least profurkish. There Is therefore a certain amount of respect for the Sharif as an Arab. But the ^ - re arded as a fool In every sense, ends there. He is commonly re.arinlatraUon Is known to be farcical an! oppressive, cooinon talk taat he woull he bankrupt without our support, ani noone eve- supposes that he can control the tribes. As long as the Sharif Is not replace! b, the Turk n00ne ilere 8ilei 3 tear whatever happens to him. When ask el my opinion as to the tt probable effect on opinion If the Akhwan were to occupy Mecca, I answered ihat It would be vlewel with apprehension as It woull be assume! that as wew were well known to be supporting the a Sharif, such action woull be against our wishes and would have been ta^en because we were powerless to stop It, The prblem of the Sharif ani Bin Saoud which is well known to every Arab, la the fact that we are cosoitted to tne support of a pompous fool who w all be crushed in a moment probably by hie own tribesmen to say nothing of tho Akhwan were we to withdraw that support, and at the same time to the support of the most powerful prince in Arabia who relies upon our moral and practical supx&gt;ort to enable hi® to control his fanatical hordes. Could we find some means grounds to withdraw on adequate our support from the Sharif matters would adjust themselves very quickly. U) Anti British feeling in Arabia. Major Dickson in his note on the growth oi this feeling in Bahrein has gi en several reasons a* to accou* for It, chiefly the Ignorance, suspicion and pride of the Arab. These vices are however Inherent in what is the most backward, degraded and bestial of semicivilised races. It is ,m ghat I have seen of the situation In Mus.at and Oman lt x venture to give some rather more general reasons for . unpopularity In those portions of Arabia where for some le we hhve exercised influence but not control. f for the safety of trade, th suppression of piracy and ; Blave trade we have been compe led to enter into relation , h various Arab rulers .

The result Is that the weak ruler with no rivals owing to our support gets into the hands of the worst possible men, corruption flourishes, adalnlstration ceases to exist, and we very naturally get the blame. The sal thing Is that t ,e blame certainly falls on the right person. It is for this reason that at the present all the socalled notables in the Gulf are antiEnsliah* It ie they who profit by this state of affairs. They can and do loot the people to their hearts* content. In contradistinction to the true Arabian state as in Nejd, the popular voice which would soon bring ann oppressive notable to book , is not heard cr regarded in an Arabian state where British ’’influence' is predominant• The notables must regard the Agency which usually ,eps in to rescue British ibj -ctu fro ■ their clutches, with rt-Fwd. The less intelligent are too stupid to see that such m attitude if continued in will be their undoing, while te more intelligent fear that goaded to madness we will act id as they knew that they are the people who will suffer if ? do, the do not love us the more.

From the old Residency files I have extracted and precised the follow; In 1766 A1 Khalifa Section of the tribe of Utah emigrants from NejJ migrated from Koweit and settled in Zubara. By 1782 the A1 Khalifa has succeeded in establishing their supremacy over the whole of the Qatar peninsula and in this year attacked the Persian Governor of Bahrein and captured the island. From this year to 1842 there was continued fighting and confusion. In 1842 Shaikh Abdullah of Bahrein quarrelled with bis grand nephew, one Mohammad bin Khalifa, and drove him out of Bahrein. Mohammed bin Khalifa went to Qatar and rebuilt the town of Zubara which had been deserted since 1811. In 1847 Shaikh Abdullah, at the invitation of Shaikh ’Isa bin Tarif of the Al bin Ali, made an abortive attempt to reduce Shaikh Mohamed bin Khalifa and died the following year. Apparently one Shaikh Mohamed bin JCkani succeeded Shaikh Isa bin TaAf as head of the Al bin Ali tribe during the next decade, and rose to power in the Qatar peninsula. In 1867 and 1868 a series of raids and counter-raids between Bahrein and El Qatar ensued in which the Resident interfered and deposed the Shaikh of Bah- Shaikh Mohamed a»d fined others heavily and Shaikh Ah, his brother who had commanded the forces of the Shaikh of Bahrein was installed. Shaikh Mohamed bin Than! in 1889 signed an agreement with .he Resident promising M 0 ea C| H nf piolirein 9 OOO Kraus “Zakat” a year, to refer all disputes o fhJ “nt aS to mam?ain with Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa the same relations which had existed between himself and the former Shaikh of Bahrain.

In 1895 a division of the A1 bin Ali under Shaikh Sultan bin Salama fled from Shaikh'Isa to Zubara where they were encouraged to settle by Shaikh Jasim under the Turkish flag. A naval expedition went to Zuba-a and a por-. tion of the A1 bin Ali were persuaded to return to Bahrein, the others went to Bida. • In 190' Shaikh Ahmad bin Thani, who had succeeded Shaikh Jasim, wdshed to come under the protection of the British Government, out, owing to pressure from the Foreign.

What views I do therefore, put forward must of necessity be those of one lacking experience in the affairs of the Islands and I trust due allowance will be made for discrepan-’ cies, and possibly false conclusions. r Before making any remarks on the three points raised, I should like to make some general observations on the attitude in general of Shaikh Sir ' Isa bin Ah al Rhahfah and his sons as they have struck have in Bahrein. me newly arrived as I .From conversations I have had with both Shaikh ’Isa and his sons nr Wilson's ntUren&lt;»s I rl^ardhlg 0 the I policy^of^self^dete &lt;1, ^ not ‘? n C and President to have had its effect or, the mentaHtv of th!

Point l The Civil Commissioner states in hi«a TVn 1 ‘;qqq a oa^i October 1919, to “ ZinneremoLondon, that the matter ^s for’aUp aetical purposes settled when the Oj-der-in-Council was brought into force There are still points, however, over which a ruling is required.' As I understand it the term “ neighbouring Arab Rulers ” refers to the inhabitants of Qatar Peninsula t V 1 ' mtendBd rB T r ‘°.* e “habitants of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar! Hadramant, Yemen, etc., the inhabitants of all which places are to he found uere trading at al times p in other words are local resident subjects of the Rulers of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hejaz and inhabitants of Hadranfant and r emen to be considered under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrein or imder that of the Political Agent ? A ruling 13 required on this point as Shaikh Isa certainly thinks he should control them. Point 2. £ have nothing to say except that up to the day of his depar ture, my predecessor was carrying on a correspondence with the Shaikh of Bahrein over this very subject. The Shaikh had dismissed a member of the 4 ‘Majlis-al-TTrfi ” and Tad appointed another member without the knowledge or approval of the Political Agent. The circumstances suggested an attempt to make a test case to see how far the Political Agent wmuid be supported. The Political Agent contended that under the Order-in-Council he had every right to be consulted in the matter and refused to recognise “ Majlis- al-TJrfL” until Shaikh Tsa withdrew his nomination. My predecessor went away at this stage of the crises and it has been left for me to settle the tangle. I certainly consider the Order-in-Counoil is cfear . on the subject and should be insisted on. In the meantime the Majlis-al-Drfi s sittings have been sus pended pending settlement of this vexed question. Point 3. The question of Zubara.—l have been through a great many files on the subject and have consulted confidentially various local people of prominence, without, of course, divulging the reasons for my questions. The conclusions 1 have arrived at are that it would be distinctly tmwise to allow Shikh Isa to occupy Zubara. On the following grounds :— (a) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim of Qatar would strongly resent the Shaikh of Bahrein again getting a footing on the Qatar * peninsula. He is a weaker man and Zubara in the hands of Shaikh Isa would be a pistol at his head always. (b) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim would certainly object to the develop ment of a new port on the peninsula of Qatar since it would at once divert all trade from Dohad (Bida) to Zubara and he would not only lose a large amount of revenue at present accruing ' from the Customs House Al I)ohah, but would stand every chance of seeing Dohah entirely disappear as the seaport of Qatar. (e) Ibn Saud similarly would take offence at a revival of the port of Zubara under Shaikh Isa’s jurisdiction for like reasons to ( 6 ) above, as such a port would mean the killing of his new trade centre of O’Jair. It should be noted that the harbour of Zubara is naturally much better than that of either I)ohah or O’Jair, and with the Shaikh of Bahrein actually compelling all Bahrein trade to go to the mainland through his port of Zubara, the end of both Abdullah bin Jassim’s and Ibn Saud’s ports would be certain and quick As matters stand a good deal of coolness already exists between Ibn Saud and Shaikh Isa owing to the latter having recently instituted a 5 per cent, tax on goods passing through Bahrain for O’Jair even though such goods never leave Ibn Saud contends that Shaikh Isa through Bahrain for the Bahrein Customs House. . should only take demurrage charges (or Arthiyeh).

Ihe Aqa,, are all men of Najd, but they are not of one tribe nor have they any triba. organization. They are professional neutrals who conduct the commerce of the desert, whether in , ‘ e Capacity 01 merch:mts r,nand 'R ‘beif own enterprises, or of servants in the employ of the richer Aqail and of other merchants and travellers. The poorer class cf ‘Aqail are known as Zuqurt; they are to be found with every caravan which crosses the desert and they are employed by merchants in the towns, ‘Aqail or non-‘Aqail, to buy camels and sheep from the tribes. Their qualifications are knowledge of the desert and of the tribes, and the fact that they are recognized by the latter as neutrals who are not implicated in intertribal feud, and are therefore given freedom of passage. In Arabia, where every tribe is at enmity with its neighbours, it is essential to have a class of men like the ‘Aqail who can safely pass from one tribal district to another. They alone make trade in the deseit tolerably secure, i.e., they enable the tribesman to sell his animals and to obtain in exchange such commodities as he needs. In order to preserve their neutral character, men of big tribes, such as the Harb or ‘Ataibah, are not allowed to become ‘Aqail, on account of their interminable blood feuds. The settled population of the Qasim, who are of various ancient tribes no longer of political importance as units, are best suited for the purposes required, and it is from them chiefly that the ‘Aqail are drawn. Any man of this kind coming up from Najd and engaging in desert traffic or service is recognized as an ‘Aqaili. Some families, like the Bassam, have been ‘Aqail for two or three generations, but there are others, like the Rumaih, who have become ‘Aqail in the last two or three years. The capitalist class of ‘Aqail, generally known as Jammalah, are to a large extent settled in Zubair, Baghdad and Damascus, but they retain an intimate connection with their relatives in the Qasim and work in partnership with them. They may even form a network across the desert, like the Bassam who have a house in Damascus, another in Zubair and manj- representatives of the family in the Qasim, all playing into one another’s hands. The chief business of these merchants is camel-buying ; they pay partly in money and partly in goods brought from the towns. They are also camel owners, bring up their own caravans and buy goods from the towns, supplying them to the ' iterior. It is obvious that, this traffic can readily be extended into supplying Syria, or any other part of enemy territory, with goods from the 'Iraq, and the ‘Aqail will as gladly supply enemy tribes, such as the Shammar, as tribes friendly to us. In war time the professional neutral is a suspect. The movements of 'Aqail merchants should therefore be watched carefully aud reported. The poorer class of ‘Aqail, the Zuqurt, are exceedingly numerous, but they are less important than the ‘Aqail merchants. They will take any job offered to them, irrespective of blockade regulations, but they do not initiate trade. They can be dealt with in connect.on with the caravans which they accompany. ‘Aqail servants and guides who are found with suspect caravans should be given short shrift. A list of the principal ‘Aqail families is appended.(6) Th, far th, r*M, n » for •th«»r« wftleh have oeen Inilcatei elaewher* ar« »uap*&lt;&gt;t«l anl unpopular, have without ioubt lo»t tholr aoral pr«sU e « i n tho : )H7 Of tht Arml&gt;«* Tho porttnent question to amk now is, Is it worth it ? ought not tha whole question of the Arab shore ef the Gulf to reeonsISere* while there is tiae and before we oo-n^dt ourselves further ?

In other words it is a situation which depends on outside props and continual inter- -ference for its stability, and which therefore cannet fct endure.

The pertinent question t© ask new is, 2s it werth it ? Ought net the whole questlen of the Arab shere ef the Gulf to reconsiieret while there Is time and before we eoamit ourselves further ? Cannet we simplify our complicated enga^eaents with tenth rate and unimportant sheikhs, define eur position and diminish our interference and commitments whieh are at present eut of all proportion to the interests involved in the light of the results of the war ? I venture te suggest, with great deference, that it is possible t® d© all these things, and that it is necessary te do them. If we put off the evil lay it will enly be much mere difficult te de later. Clearly the first tiling te de is to revise the treaties with Muscat, Bahrein and Keweit. They are all ebselete and vary very greatly, except in so far that they commit us rather unnecessarily. Cemprehensive treaties could *esumably be made, practically similar as regards conditions, th all three states.

Major Dickson, with his staff and several others, came to see us off on board and gave me a good * send-off • 2. Owing to Shimai we had to anchor off Aqariyah near Zallaq, where w® reached at 8-30 p.m. Sailed again at 2-00 P M. vhen Shimai went down, arriving J Ojair at 6-30 a.m Wasted two hours in trying to get into the inner harbour going as near the wooden pole (mark) as seemed safe ; but the launch was nearly aground f north-west of pole) and bad to go back and anchor quarter mile away to the north of the pole.

It is a watering place or where* temporary little pools are dug, as at Muwaih, and sweet water eomes out in a sufficient quantity. Small level plainer wadi with a patch of green surrounded by sand hills or dunes (Taus '^ plural of Taas as these are called by Arabs). We passed on at some distance of it, leaving it at about 400 yards to our left (east). The route, seen now, lay over a level plain of whitish (salt) ground, a narrow valley among sand dunes, for about two miles. Saw several little heaps of camel bones, skeletons lying in this valley These were the poor beasts that were “'Inqataa” (= cut off—very expressive word indeed characteristic of the Arabic language) from the train by sheer fatigue and heavy load. This is about middle of the distance between ’Ojair and Hofu^ ; the wretched animal must have found himself unable, after a halt, to go on any farther, and been beaten to death by the cruel Rai in an attempt to make him go on. We had to exchange two of our camels which had been giving trouble, sitting down every now and then and refusing to go on (Muhammad* al-Aswad’s and Farhan’s). Former picked out two out of a lot going down unladen to bring cargo from 'Ojair j as result we went on at a better pace. 10. Qekdeht I was told, was some miles off to our left (east).,. It was at this place that fche whole of the Turkish Askar (garrison^ was surnrised and. butchered to a man by the Manasir Badoos, 1 11.

Prom Jisksheh onwards the road is a good level one on hard ground (at times stony), even a motor or gari could go provided the small‘Masur ’' or bridges over the little canals irrigating the palms around were broadened a little. Part of the way runs between good date palms whicn are very well tended. We passed by three small fortresses, at short distances, on the road between Padhul and Hofuf. These were built by the Turks to protect the road and to serve as an outer defence for Hofuf itself against the incessant attacks of the Arabs. The Qusaibis tell me that since the ocotipation of Hassa by BinSaud, these have never been manned, as no danger of disturbance was feared after the oxodus of the Turk (in 1911-12). H Hofuf, commonly called Hassa, was reached at 5'45 p.m., on Saturday the 17th July 1920 = 30th Skawwal, 1338, 2J hours.after leaving ’Ojair. Pairly big^ walled tow n of good appearance, with a fort inside, west part. There is also a tug mosgue in the fort, known as Jatnait Ibrahim Pasha, built years ago. Mr. Philby’s photographs of this and other places of interest have been published. Good building in itself, with only one very big dome in the middle, but'in comparison to our Indian Jamias of the Pathan Kings and Mughal Emperors this is of no consequence at al-L The town has only two gates. We entered by the east gate, where there was a big crowd of Askaris and common people. Pound servants standing near by in front of a house. It is our quarter : the former Turkish Kushdior primary school. We passed along the bazaar, about two hundred yards to the Amir’s house, where we were received bv him. Here we have the great Bin Jiluvi (Abdullah Bin Jiluvi) who, of course, has airs, talks with an amount of reserve and in a patronising tone'. Has received us fairly well on the whole, and somehow makes me feel that I, at least, am welcome to him, although be first took the coffee without the usual courtesy of offering it first to the guest. He has reason to be proud and conceited as he has, an uncouth Badu that he is, achieved what his big predecessors, the Turkish Walls, with high-flown titles, etc., failed to achieve—-• peace and tranquillity. He is feared and respected by high and low» far and near, for his even handed justice, as the punishments which Bin Jiluvi awards are the severest possible, beyond even the strict 4 Sbara hand A He always cuts a man’s right hand for theft as soon as it is admitted or proved before him. He beheads the murderer without fail. The last was on Thursday last, the day fixed for “ Hudud ” punishments, 15th July, when an Arab (Akhwan) was decapitated with sword for having recently killed a Shiah Syed, whom the bigot suspected of having smoked before coming out to meet bis demand to sell some goods. The story goes that the Akhwan went to buv provisions in a village ; the Shiah Syed offered to supply the wants, and asked the Arab to sit down in the shop, and went inside for something returning after a few minutes. The Akhwan said that he smelt of tobacco, and that the man must have gone in to smoke. “ You chafir, you smoke titin you must be butchered ,s ; with these words the poor wretch was stabbed to death with Khanjar, )5 We sal for about quarter of an hqur, as it was first meeting. ^in Jiluvi talked of common things, asked after Major Hickson, Shaikh Isa, Y usuf Kanoo, etc. etc. He did not show Interest in the talk about Haj j, wluon 1 arhan started, shewed ignorance of the Imam’s wishes or intentions m the matter Came to our q uarter (the former school) and found servants and kit alright, ± wo attendants added by the Ann'r, Muhammad Effendi, with his son-in-law AbduJah came to us at 6-39 p.m. Both are interesting relics ot Turkish times in Hassa.

Nice respectable people, full of praises for their Imam. ^ I noticed again that Bin Jiluvi is not only feared hut also respected for his just though harsh administration .of this district, which w as so notorious for murder or rapine during* the time of Turks, only seven years ago. 20. Our departure to-day is postponed again, it is said, to await arrival of good mounts; camels sent for from some distance. 21.

He escorted Dr. Harrison last w inter and remembers with surprise that the “Brekani” (American) walked Ions? distances ahead of the camels bare-headed although strong cold Shimal was blowing. At 8 a.m. we come up on high rocks with big deep ravines below, about 300 feet down. We dismount and descend slowly, the way being by no means easy or safe. Many a poor camel has, I am told, fallen dow n here to rise no more. Bugged rocks, all round, the highest seen far. The most prominent is called Khashm-Al-Ausah. The hilia running south to north are called Al-Urumah, with a big plain opening out to west, and a ring of black, jet black, rocks to west and north. These are called Bughma. Far away to the south-west are the big hills of Jabha* behind which lies the town of ELharaj and other villages of Duwasir Arabs.

Bin Jabir sent a man ahead with miter to Rlyndh saying we would reach to-morrow morning. At7*30 a.m. passed Bhuahbah Haniyan, a dry river-bed running around at the foot of the high rocky plateau, bowl-shaped, At 10 a.m. halted at Wadi Abun Nas, a sandy valley among rocks, with good grazing for camels. After lunch and rest started at 4-30 f.m., marching over hard rock ground with rocks all round at a distance. At 6 p,m ..descended into a low wadi or plain where there is a good pasture of ‘‘Ashab ” and “ Afraj,” etc., some Sumr (Indian Kikar) trees. We now enter Jubail rocks, low muddy hills of dark brown colour extending South to north. Last rock protruding to the west is called Khashm-Al-Aun from where the route descendsinto the’Wadi As-Salai. Halted at 6-30 p M., Brayed, took dinner and re-started at 8-30 p.m., matching up to 11-30 p.m. Halted on a level rock of Mugharizat hills. Biyadh is only an hour from here. Slept well, very cool night. This was where Abdul Aziz hid with 40 picked camel riders and dashed at Riyadh at midnight, re-captur ing it from Ibn Rashid, 16 years ago, so Bin Jabir tells me, TJQLAT-HAMAID TO SAL AX—10 HOURS. 34. Tuesday, 27ih July — 10th Bhil QaacZa/L—Starting at 5-30 a.m., -we soon came up on the hills called Mugharizat (milked dry). These are really milked dry by the Riyadh valley below on to which all the water of rainfall must flow*from these rocks Brom the last ‘of these and the highest you see Riyadh, lying like a princess on a^green bed. It is a very pleasing sifirht after a hard journey of live days and nights running. Some people do it in ten days and a special post runner in three only, hut often kills his camel. ' 35 . M'e arrived in Riyadh at 7 a.m. : thus actual time occupied in travel ling (moving) is 65 hours. _ ' ♦ 36. As soon as we dismounted in front of the “Qasr ”, palace of the ruler, a secretary whom I later knew to be Ibrahim Bin Jummah Shammari, received us at the gate and took us up and ushered into the “ Maktab,” office of the Imamu % ^ x . v 37 . The Imam Bin Saud (Shaikh Sir 1 Abdul ’ Am, K.C.I.E.) received us.Yerv kindly and courteously rising and meeting us in the centre of his oihee. Tall, well-built, fair, good-featured man of about' 40. Talks with ease, ramec fast Welcomed our visit which he said is a bit delayed, and repeatedly said that answer to bis letter was much delayed by Government. ALer lo minutes’. ordinary talk, we were sent with Ahmad Thanaiyan to the other, west side of the Q,asr, the quarters set apart for us. Good, commodious, well- furnished house with all requirements. Two attendants and one coffee-man given to us and we settled down comfortably. It is ™ th “. not ua P oa ' sant, oppressive like Bahrein. It is dry heat.’ i he wind is bhimal. 38 Ibrahin Bin Jumaah Shammari, secretary, and Bm Shalhub, treasurer, and Ibn Suwaidan, clerk, came to visit us t After Maghrib the Imam called us to his private Majlis and talked a lot. qq Wednesday 28th July — Hth Bhil Qaadah.—W ent out for a ride to . north of the town, called the Shamsiyah.

All this must entail a xery heavy expenditure in spite of usual Arab economy. In course of 1 conversation Him Sana said that Salim, Khazaal and Talib were his enemies in spite of his naving been a good friend to each of them formerly. Salim was of a suspecting nature and possessed little or no sense. Khazaal was always jealous of him and insincere to all ; while Talib was a double-faced old intriguer whose return to Iraq w^ould only create trouble for Government etc., etc. 44. At noon first Ibn Shalhub the Imam’s treasurer, and then Ahmad bin Thanaiyan visit us and offer any assistance, etc., to make us quite comfortable. As a matter of fact we ^re quite so and are only anxious to get orders to proceed to Mecca as early as possible. Former talks of the great incessant calls of the Imam on the treasury and Tosha-Khana, his ever-growing “ Ikrah ” (presents) etc., latter about the Mutadaiyanah (Akhwan), who are an ever-increasing compact body and a great force which the Imam has always at his command : two lakhs of these could be mobilized at any moment. I w r onder if any part of Arabia could possibly maintain so large an army, were it ever raised and marched, as food, water and fodder are so much lacked in this part of the world. 45. Good day, Shnnal wind, rather hot, especially out-of-doors. Nights are- cool and pleasant. 46. liiday, oOth July = 7.3th Dhil Qaadah .—Early morning walked out to Imam Abdur Rahman s garden. It is one of the best vineyards in Riyadh and contains various Buit-trees pears, peaches, apricots-^pomegranates and giia\as ; also winter aelons.

States no reply received as yet from Bahrein regarding Bin Sand’s proposal to send with us a small body of Nejd Hajj party, in charge of one of the As-Saud, ruling, family. Hints that he himself may be selected for the job. He says the Imam’s mind is not a little disturbed to s§e that Government presses him to go to Mecca with a very limited follow ing and without arms. Wondered if Government really considered situation or knew |he full facts about Bin Saud, Bahrein and Baghdad dkh not sufficiently adYOcate liis cause, so it was ignored and nothing came of his repeated representations : (he even said Major Dickson had no power, but only passed Bin Sand’s communications on to Baghdad, which in its turn passed them on to London ; that ■ decisions were made and orders were passed in London without fully knowing circumstances and facts), I had to argue matter and lecture to him on the point to correct his views, and Parhan also spoke, till at last Ahmad saw his own mistake,, 60. In the afternoon Bin Sand called us and took us round, his “Mudhif,” guest-house, a big square hall with balconies in front. It is a two-storey building which is just completed In one corner on the ground floor there is the “ Matbakh ,v (kitchen) where 10 or 12* huge kettles were ready with hot pufao (rice and mutton), while some sixty to seventy men sat dining in three groups upstairs- They were eating out of big round trays. I was told that some of the kettles contained two goats’ meat and 60 lbs. nee, and others three goats and 80 lbs of rice. Several scores' of men had already dined and^ some more were waiting outside for their turn. Bin Sapd said, with an air or self- satisfaction, that that feeding was going on daily with very slight increase or decrease in number of guests and visitors who are also 3 oined by Imam s slaves ©I* strVcints* 51 \fter the Maehrib prayer Bin Saud called us both to his private M-Uie and spoke firstabout Kuweit-llutair affaars, which evidently womed i us &gt; aiu : ?1“ .0 ,, n „T, p n for Government s intervention at the him a good deal. He »id ^at he arfcedto . himself with Shaikh very out-set, but was told rnment had changed their mind, submit 1116 dispute t0 Government’s arbitration which he was willing to o. 62.

Sunday, U* fT** 1 T » ~ shots fired in front of the .P“' a ®® uttp'-s for the Imam stating the Akhwan (bearer of good news) has arrived with t * Al-Harra near Medina.

The Imam’s brother, Abdullah, is credited with an expression of adherence to have uttered in his Ma]hs, with many men present that these blind fanatics must one day be visited with the wrath o. &amp; J and be doomed to destruction. I wonder if Bin Saud shares such pious or limited senthnehts. Eater, when I saw Bin Saud and asked him (after waiting to see if he would mention it) about the firing, etc, he said it was an ordinary event; nothing of importance : a man had brought news of some fighting and so-called Akhwan success in a distant place on the borders of Ne]d &amp;nd asked for a Bhului (riding camel) as his own had died of fatigue on the road ; he. Bin Saud, would give the man one, as he Was accustomed to do in such cases. This was not telling the whole truth. 55. At noon wrote letters to Bahrein, then tried to sleep but could Tiot owing to heat and flies, the latter a great nuisance and seem to be over-growing. Punkha and hand-fans are a great necessity and we employ both as much as possible. 56. After Asr (afternoon) prayers Bin Saud sent us horses and we rode out and met him on his way to the Badu camp, outside Riyadh. Bin Baud was riding a very fine mare, a thorough-bred Arab from Jabal Shammar, the best mat I have seen. His sons Saud and Faisal and brother Abdullah, several cousins and about two dozen attendants accompanied on good mares. Bin Saud talked on .horses and pointed out various gardens and buildings on the way. Reaching the camp, we sat in a flig open tent in the centre of some 200 f Buyut Shaar ( tents) scattered over a distance of miles all around. The host is one Salaihi (?), a nice old Badu who has charge of the Imam’s camels. x S^t about three quarters of an hour, had the three rounds of coffee, and all the time Bin Sand talked of camels, their uses, kinds, diseases, etc., etc. There was a bustle as hundreds of camels were returning from the wadis after the day’s grazing, and were formed into batches and taken to water on a large well close by. There were over 200 white camels which were part of the recent booty from Bin Rashid, of which the Imam’s share alone is said to be 3,000. These tut 6 over several different places for convenience of grazing. Prayed Maghrib with the Imam and party, and noticed a slight softening of Wahhabi ( hwan&gt; *aees around: perhaps we were, after all, regaled as somewhat like themselves, pseudo-Moslems, if not Moslems. t&gt;._ ^ Monday, Sni August = 16th MU -Wrote letters to Bahrein. that the vouthhif Rte‘TvS ^ ® G 1 hl “ U agaillst Bin Rashid.

Information received one Abbas-al Faliaj arrived from Syria ten days ago ; probably a secret messenger : in camping outside Eiyadh, near Imam’s garden. Has five horses and several attendants.. Is said to have come thrice before, 59. Two big Akhwan Mullas, Xluhammad Bin Abdul Latif of Artawiyah and Abdul Aziz Angan of Saderah. are also visiting the Imam to-day. 60. In the evening (8 to 9 p m.) the Imam read out a portion of Hadith (traditions) to a large gathering of Mullahs and other visitors from the mofussil in his Majlis and then delivered a lecture of sermon on obedience to God and His Prophet as an essential qualification of a Muslim and a Momin (true believer). I could easily hear every word he uttered as I was on the next roof. An A slim, probably Shaikh Abdullah Bin Abdul Latif, strongly supported 'what the Imam had said quoting from Al-Quran. x 61. I am afraid it is getting rather late for the Hajj. Bin Saud has not had Government’s answer as yet, and we are strained in Riyadh, 62. Tuesday^, 3rd A ugust—l7th Dhil Qaadah. -With Bin Sand’s permission Farhan and myself went and saw the bid Imam Abdiu Rahman at his house. He is a nice old man, looks over’TO. of short stature, rather dark and stout, with Kina-dyed he^rd of medium size. Talks slowly in a low voice and wears’a contented look and a pleasant smile. Asked me what part of India I came from and where I learnt my Arabic. Was glad when told that Arabic was taught in public as well as private schools in India. Also said that my name was familiar to him, as he had. beard it many years ago when the famous Wahhabi Maulvi Siddiq Hasan Kliifcarried on his campaign of religious lectures and debates throughout India and Hejaz, more ^especially Mecca, where he was reputed to have ‘ defeated ’ the Ulama of the other Sunni sects m public debates. It may be noted that this gentleman is the author of several Aahhabi books. He rose in life by dint of his great eloquence, and knowledge, and married the last Begum of Bhopal, Sultan Jahan Becrum (mother o| the present Begum), whereupon he was styled Nawab Siddiq Hasan J£ban, ^ T-- 63 The old Imam also asked us about Shaikh Isa s health and^the welfare ■eras not a little surprised to see mm ^ then sit at a distance, near the ordinary “ Hsluyah (adherents) _ It did impress one to see this wise, capable and strong rulef, who is so much It did impress c . * at a res p ec t to his old lather.

We could not even often the Imam the commonest thing, coffee, as our coffee-boy had looked up the room and gone out. So' I had to content 'myself by apologising and saying that after all it was his own house, and we his own guests ; he would kindly excuse the shortcoming, whereupon Bin Saud repeated jbis favourite couplet (0, our guest, if you visit- us you will ^.tind that we are (like) guests and you (like) the host),, and then departed saying that he was going to Shaikh Abdullah Bin Abdul' Latif’s, to try and reconcile this powerful old Shaikh to a number of ' Mutawiah ’ (mullas or priests) who have been summoned for disobeying Shaikh Abdullah’s injunctions regarding public preaching and disposal of cases, etc., etc. Some of these worthies have been reported publicly criticising Bin Saud’s policy and relations with the other rulers and the 4 Ajanib ’-(foreigners) and preaching 4 Shiddaffi’ (Jehad) against ght, perhaps and the ‘ Ajanib ’-(foreigners) and preaching ‘ ShiddaL’ (Jehad) against all non-Nejdis, who are Kafir to their mind.

Thursday. 15th August ~Wth Mil Qa’ad ah,-Wrote letters to Bahrein, Am much depressed, feeling as if stranded here At 10 a.m. Ibn Shalhub called on us with Bin Sulaiman a katib (secretary) of Bin Sa’ud, Latter wants medicine for his brother who is sutfering from malarial fever and bronchitis. I give him some quinine pills and a little chlorodyne Which is received very thankfully—almost, as a boon'—in the total absence of doctors and medicines here* Ibn Shalhub inquires about our requirements for the journey. We ask for two pairs of Mizwadas (bags) for carrying c-otbes and other kit, as the ekdans (boxes) we have brought with us from Bahrein are too bulky and inconvenient to be carried on the long journey to Mecca, Offers tents but we have brought two with us fjwa Bahrein. Arms are, he says, ordered to be supplied us as to all others going with us. After all, we are to go armed, let us hope, for show only. V, 72. At 8 p.m. Bin Sa ? ud calls us to his private mejlis, and speaks, in the some strain as before, against the Sharif, and the hopelessness of the proposed endeavours to make peace or find a modus tnvendi, etc, I thought this was said, preparatory to an excuse for still more’delays or refusal to send even a representative w r iih a small number of Nejdis. I said that I did not know bow far the reports about King Hussein and his attitude of hostility to Bin Sa’ud were true but, eyenif all wfcat Bin Sa’ud had from time to time heard and said, on the subject were taken for granted, it was only, reasonable and human to try and put an end to enmity and ill-will, that it pras His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s oft-expressed desire that their two great friends King Hussein and Bin Sa’ud should live in peace ; that both of them bad expressed their willingness to meet each other and discuss makers in a friend y way ^ that after Several alternate proposals, the present one bad, been put forward by Bin Sa’ud himself and accepted by His Majesty’s Government, and .hat it was up to him to put it into action and thereby show his readiness c accommodate matters, i added that if tbis^ latest proposal of sending his* representative and a suitable number of Nejdis for the llajj and ^ | preliminary negotiations for peace was not acted ^upon y aim, opnorkmitv would be lost and the bond fide of his infen ions ^ ^ coild possibly be doubted, etc. As supported my above argument, and spoke an{ j ija/o-of tired Government had had tpo much of that game gaud ami t»f the feuds and* mutual recriminations of ^mg wi ^ and Major Dickson there must be an pud to that attituue ; that C wou ld be disappointed who were sincere friends an o supporters t p US hed through with and displeased If he evaded the solution which m^t be pusn. out any further delay and so on and so iortb. , f lincrerine in 73.

We were entertained with home-made sweets, grapes, melons, and sherbet and coffee. Glad to find the second pleasant and sociable man in Hiyaun, the first being Bin Saud himself. ; 76. Prayed in the Jamia mosque for the second time. Surprised to see a majority of men entering the mosque with shoes on. Before beginning to pray, shoes are taken off and placed in front almost touching the head when the ${ Sijdah ’* (prostration) part of the prayer is performed. This is truly Wahhabi, First row behind the Imam (leader in prayer, Shaikh Abdullah bin Abdul Latif) is occupied by Bin Sa’ud, his father, brothers, sons and relations and retainers. There are about 20 rows of *200 to 250 men each. The mosque is spacious hut low-roofed, and of a very simple unornamenfced type. Even the mosques in our villages in India are better in every way, to say nothing- of those qi towns. So much for Wahhabi simplicity or purbanism, 77. At 4 p.m a jug dust-storm or hurricane arose from the North and soon spread ail over, making it as dark as night. Windows and doors had to be shut, and after half an hour a fairly heavy shower of rain fell and drove away the dust. Water flowed down from roofs into streets, but after an hour the ground looked dry again This rain is quite an unexpected boon they seldom have rain here at this time of the year, their usual rainy season being a brief spell during rabia (spring). 78. After Maghrib, Bin Sa’ud had the selected camels collected from two or three grazing centres outside Riyadh, brought betore himself. He con descended to examine each one of these excellent mounts and ordered one or t wo tO a be substituted by better ones. This shows what a thorough man he really is He could well have left this job to a servant, but “Abdul’ Aziz did it himself ana remained standing in the street in front of the qasr (palace) for quite an hour examining the beasts, their ‘‘shidads’’(saddles), trappings, etc., and asking questions and making remark about some of his favourite OQSLSXS* / .• ./ 79 ' ? e t ^ en , re * urned t ° hi ? sitting-place on the roof between his ff, and ttere called As soon a, we sat down he said that all arrangements for our journey to Mecca had been completed and we could start early next morning, thread Thanaiyan was to fetend to som! minor detads that evening and to consult us regarding cooks, attendants etc It was most important to go as light as possible and yet take eveSw of necessity as nothing except “dhahihaa” (goats or sheen) could be hS on tte way.

We camped on the excellent cool sands of Wadi Hahifah outside and below (south-west) Baraiyah, took cofee, prayed “ Iska” and then slept a few hours and started at 2 a.m. soon after the moon had risen. The route lay over the bed of the said Wadi, with high rocky banks for about 10 * miles and then, over stohy. ground, 90. The Imam 5 g men with horses took leave for returning to Riyadh, and X gave them letters for Bin Sa’ud and Political Agent, Bahrein. They were all very good lads and I wished that I had asked for a loan of their services for the journey but it was too late then to think of it, Ahmad Thanaiyan, who had bften charged with the arrangement of servants, when asked this evening as to those appointed for us said that be bad ten or eleven followers who could work for the whole party but that none had been specified for us except Our old Riyadh coffee-boy Bahaim. At &amp; ?,n. halted for ^ Pajr^ prayers and then resumed the march. 91. Jnbailah Was reached at 7 a.m. It is a half-ruined kachcha fortress with a little village around it on an elevated ridge. A small wadi lies below it, and there are two wells at which some 200 camels were being watered, the waiey being drawn in large skin-buckets, drawn by two camels on opposite sides. We halted at one of the wells, and some of the party took water. The Amir sent us dates and coffee and after one hour’s rest we started again, the road is now on a hard, sandy ground. 92 ’Awainah now in ruins, left about three miles to the north. It was once a prosperous town and the seat of the Al-Maamar rulers of Nejd, the predecessors of Al-Sa’ud, the present rulers. Accor din gAo Ahmad Thanaiyan the Al-Maamar perished in a terrible plague, which swept away 300,000 inhabitants of these parts, about 130 years ago. Some of the Al-Maamar are now serving under Bin Sa’ud, chiefly as Amirs. Fahad Bin Maarnar, the present Amir of Qassim and Bin Sand’s well-known genera), is one of them, K 0| M 11 a.m. we camped in a vast plain thinly covered with sumar ” n aia n trees and “ asbab ” grass and surrounded by hills, This is called ^r 11 ^ •- i, Wa rsit#*fapd our tents at a distance of some 40 yards from the. f AhmiA Bin 1 Thanaiyan and that of his party, as thejr had shown some ten of f “ ifen marching some 300 wds ahead of us, or keeping .aloofness on the way, dUmm* - * and Tarhan to say it out, that we SlUOiuesa vj&amp;i s •““ a. e some distance behind, I ba Jegan f* 6 ' Took tea and lay down in ware rather disagreeable compamons to the»e mem ^ ioo^ ^ my little tent, feeling ^ ordinary “ shidad” (saddle), was very Sn' thi8 was my ^ 6Xper!enCe ' Lmem at 12-30.and then slept for two hours or sft of 0mar xbn-al-Khattab, 94 .

Started at 4 r, m., after saying collective &lt;f Zuhr ’ and ‘ Asr prayers, as yesterday. At 8 ?, m. we arrived in Shumaisah, a small low- lying valley suron^ded by barren hills. There are two wells here and a small Badu (Ataibah) camp. The headman, with live others came and took eoffe with us They have large flocks of excellent sheep, but a small number of camels and half a dozen dogs to guard the sheep from wolves and thieves. After watering our camels and taking fresh water, which is very good, we resumed our march at 10 p, m. and after an hour came to a sandy plain with deep sands and high dunes called Nafud, round and over many of which our camels walked slowly and laboriously. There was no sign of a route or track for hours, but our guide, Sagar-al-At awi, led us with' ah air of certainty, he himself being v guided by the stars, which shone brightly in the dark moonless night. At about midnight there were two or three brief pauses to let those behind catch up; one darnel rather heavily laden with provisions refused to climb over a high dune, and the keeper, Bakhit negro, shouted out “ ala bun, ala hum” (go slow, go slow), when we all stopped at the top and then sent down two men who brought up the poor lingerer. We liad hoped to finish with this sandy m. found ourselves still surrounded by dunes and came portion but at 1 a. m. iouiiu uurseives si to the conclusion that we ha^l lost our way f r- ,v —A W AAX.* ICSJLT ¥f l VIA *J4.JL1.9 surrounded by dunes and came Man &amp;ud beast were tired to the \last degree, ana a bait was made, every body falling asleep almost immediately tm this nice and cool bed of sand. : . u n 98 * August—24th DIM Qa’a^.-The usual shoufe of tjumu feallu ' roused us and after hurrying through the brief “fair ” prayer we started at 5 a. m, coming out of the Nafud' a sea of sand, at 7 a. m.^ when the route, a slight track, lay over an undulating plain of hard soil The* ground was at times black and rocky. The wind is “ gharbi ” (west) to-day nnd is rather hot and dry unlike the Shimal (north) which prevailed tilf yester» day. There is fair amount of Ashab and Afraj to which the poor beasts help themselves while on the march. 100, At 11-30 a.m. halted in the far (S.-WV) corner of the plain called Huwaitaniyab. Here there are two little camps of about 20 to 25 Buyut Sbaar (tents) of the Dalahibah (Ataibah) Bedouin. Large flocks of sheep and goat are to be seen over the farthest end of the plain under the rocks to our south and east, also about -iOO camels. There are two wells near the Badtt camp whence we obtain water. But it is dirty and bitter with a pecu liar smell. I could take only a little of it with difficulty and preferred to remain thirsty. Farhan and the others who drank more freely got many motions the same afternoon and my bottle of chlorodyne was handy. ana or 101. It is the hottest day we have bad so far ; the hot wind, the dust a the glare added to groVing fatigue make life most unpleasant. Cannot sleep ur rest or do anything but lie down covered with a blanket which affords hut little protection or relief. The condensed milk and pine-apple I have brought are more freely used than on the three previous days and two big “ badiyas ” (wooden bowls) of milk and water with sugar added, two tins of pine-apple and some biscuits sent Over to Ahmad Thanaiyan’s tent, bring us a return of good home-made cakes and “ ugga ” or dried powder like whey, which makes a. really enjoyable and very cooling drink. 102 . Gbazi, my khalasi, used also as a cook, was too ill to be able to prepare our lunch so we nad to do without it Wb all, especially Farhau arid myself, haVc little appetite or inclination for the sort of food we are getting here (rice and mutton cooked together) and cold drinks are profusely used to supply the want. i . \ ' 10A Farhan goes and talks to Ahmad Thanaiyan who comes to my tent with a sorry face, saying that he was ashamed to face me as he had been under a misapprehension about servants and attendants for the journey. He supposed the Iman had fixed it up. himself, and so overlooked the matter. Those he had then were good for nothing, etc. I did not want to make much of the matter, and so put him at ease by saying that I did not mind it at all, as my own servants were sufficiently looking after me. 104, No rest possible, so make- early start at 2-30 the idea is to reach Al’-Muehirah early to-night, as we are practically withsu. water.

Wednesday, llth Augusts 25tl jjhu ^ ^ Musrhirah valley at 5 a m., I saw only one large well nearivnere we camped, but another is said to be further up the valley. Water is very good, light and sweet. The route lies over a stony plateau or elevated plain in which there are several beds of jet black stones or pebbles sometimes mixed up with white marble-like pieces of stones. There were patches of good e&lt; ashab here and xr pjigh hills 0 f a d u ii dark colour were visible far away to the south and l -i —n- 1 - -l- * l ' —^ a + i a * ■»*■ Uoi^ri ^ « plain near there.

It was very hot again and the camdls having had little grazing, were left to graze, as* there was good pasture around us near by. 107. At 11 a.m. Farhan and myself went to Ahmad Thasaiyan’s tent, where we took tea and then coffee. About half a dozen of his eom- panions who were in his tent left on seeing us approach it and went over to the other open tent of servants and 'followers. Ahmad Thanaiyan read and interpreted in Arabic extracts from a* French paper called L'Asie Arabic, published in Paris dated the 3 5th June last. The leading article was headed “His Majesty the King of Syria” and commented upon a public speech of Amir Fahal in which he dwelt on his relations with the Allies and pointed out tpe duty and task of the Syrians, Also a column on “ Kiots in Mesopotamia , which tbe paper alleged, were due to the harsh treatment of the datives by the English, etc. Ahmad lhanaiyan said that the editor had been awarded a gold meda 1 by King Hussein, and consequently the Kind’s umkHng^ S ° ^ S ° US ’Abdullah were sung in that paper , 108 / at 12-30, and slept two hours in spite of the “ gharbi * 5 nd sun s heat.

Sha'arah is the centre of trade between the Hejas and Neid : Las a bazaar in the centre where cloth, rice, sugar, coffee and spices are sold. Many a Badu caravan comes from all sides to buy their needs here. I now see about 0 Buy lit Sha ar lying half a mile south of the to^n, and a large number of camels around tno two wells Water is very good indeed. Thanks, however, to the Akhwan spirit, manifested in the Amir’s refusal to meet no less a. man than the cousin and representative of Bin Sa’ud, we are not allowed to enter the town and see it. There was a quite a long line of fresh-looking graves near thq camp,\arid I was told that Sha'arah had lost many of its inhabitants in the last influenza epidemic, which raged all over Nejd including Biyadh, Bin 8 a*ud himself having lost two sons among other relations. It was hard to leave this cool and nice little spot so soon, but we started at 4-30 p. m. though I was feeling extremely tired and every inch of the body was paining like a sore, after five days' and nights’ marching—ordinarily Sha’arah is reached on 8th or 9th day after leaving Riyadh III. Passed under another little cluster of “Ithl ” ( ?) trees with date- palms to the souJh-west of the town Two Baduof the Ar Bogah tribe have at last joined us from the Badu camp here for Hajj. Ahmad Thanaiyan says these will be better guides than our old ones—Sagar and Aayidh. 115.

It is usual for Nejd pilgrims to assemble at Asheirah coming by different routes, and Koweit Hajis join those at Qnssim and then gaunder Bin Sa’ud’s flag; the number is some times forty thousand or thereabouts. 119. At 9 a. m. passed by a camp of Alhargah Badu a section of the Ataibah, lying in a low valley in about 40 “ Bnynt Sba’ar ” (tents), about 300 camels and perhaps one thousand or twelve hundred sheep and goats grazing around. Their Shaikh is a Bin Hindi, \ 120. At 11 a.m. halted in a sandy plain with good pasture for camels Lunched and slept as the wind “gharbi” (west) still blowing; is less hot than last few days. Probably rain lias fallen in the distant hills towards- the Hcjaz (west). Gave medicine to three men, Fahaid, Bin Nassar and Marid. Former had toothache and the others diarrhea. All cured at once.

Saturday, 15th Auynst=-29th Vhil Qa'adck. Started at 4 a.m. At my suggestion Ahmad Thanaiyan has spoken sharply to the two Ro£ah Badu .guides, who now admit “ dhallaina ” (we have lost our way) and promise afresh to take us to Saja in five hours. It now appears that we have been moving in a circle more than seven or eight hours and are now as far away from water as at 4 p.m. yesterday. At sunrise pass by a number of strange rocks which look like artificial mounds or dunes lying in a sandy plain, 122. Saja wells reached at last at 9-30 a. m. There is no permanent population here, hut a large number of the Badu of the Adh-Bhibah section of the Ataibah are camping in taeir black tents. They have over 1000 camels and very large flocks of sheep and goats. These are one of the recent converts to Akbwamsm from the Hejaz tribes and have been driven* south east chiefly by fear of the Harb Bedouins, their hereditary foes.

At 7 a.m descended &amp; large plain of white surfaced ground called^ Sabakha, tne wnOiO of wineij is covei'ed with hard sal amshoniac, over which the camels could move very slowly. We came out of it at noon and camped on. a small piece of rocky ground with very little pasture. It is too hot to allow any rest or sleep. 130. Started at 4 p.M. The route lies over good, level plain of hard, slightly sandy s soil with a chain of black hills visible at a long distance to the west and south-west. At 6-30 p m. suddenly arrived at what seemed shining white sands, but our thirsty camels, three days without water, knew better and stretched out their eager necks and began to drink. What we mistook for streaks of white sand thus proved to be tiny little streams of rain water running down from the distant hills in the west and south-west. These streams have just reached here though it must have rained last night when w r e §aw heavy clouds and lightning in this direction. This was a most unexpected and extra ordinary phenomenon, and caused great jubilation.’ Man and beast drank to his fill of this excellent, cool, sw r eet, though muddy, water. As if in thankful ness to the boon, we decided to halt, thus giving up Muwaih (the next water) for which we had given up Murran, to the north-west. It was a very cool and pleasant night ; some of the party bathed and even washed their clothes, and it goes w ithout saying that the nearly empty water-skins were washed and refilled. For the first time since leaving lliyadh. I had five hours* good sleep, getting up at 1-30 a. m. and resuming the march. iSi.

At t-CO a.m. halted for prayers, re-starting at o a.m. Soon |iter sunrise saw two little streams of fresh rain water lowing down from black rocks called Hurrat-al-Kisbab, which were reacted at 7 a. m. Here.% once more, the guides declare we have lost our way for the third or fourth-time which means a total loss of one precious day’s march. Ahmad Thanaiyau is f urious, and the guides, especially Sagar-al-A taibi give cheeky an&amp;wers. Have to turn roui d and go about three miles and then proceed on a well-marked • track, travelling over dusty ground. We now see the Hadhn hills in the distance. 133. I recall one of Bin Baud’s very interesting remarks : “ Xou will see Hadhn ; that is ,the limit of the Hefaz as the Holy Prophet has said, ‘ Man raa Hadhna faqad tanaijad, * (As soon as one sees Hadlm, he is in Nejd.) How can the Sharif claim any ground this way of Hadhn ? .Needles to says that this if true and abided by 3 will give Tarrabah and Khurmah / to Bin Sand without much ado. 134. At 11-30 a.

Started at 3-30 P. m. ? after a brief rest and the, usual prayers. Pass over little tracts of small white and black stones with which are mixed up tiny little green and red coloured pebbles. Ground is alternately stony and. sandy. Halted at 6-30 P. m. for prayers, also took coffee, and ^resumed the vmarch. The camels though much spent, seem to go pretty fast, not less than, five mile an hour I should think. Halted at 11-30 p m. No supper as usual I content myself with biscuits which T share with Parhan and Ahmad Thanaiyam Had a good sleep in spite of the fears betrayed by the party who seemed'.to expect a sudden raid or onslaught. This was to my mind a sure sign that w e were then in the Hejaz territory. 136 Thursday 19th August = 4lh Dhil-Hijjah.. Started at 4- a. m., soine^ov'er stony ground witk kany shiubs aUa.oufid.

We now see fto south-south-east) t e black Zala-TarahaL which is one of the chain ofAhiils called Haithn. I he town of Tambah is udder one, thp highest of these rocks and is commanded by if. Dahaim declares that a gun like one of those possessed by the Imam can bit the town from the top of the zala {lit. a rib). Route (a slight track) now lies over good level hard ground slightly sandy at times. *•142. Halted at 6-30 p.m. for prayers, also took coffee and resumed the march at 7-30 p.m., and at 8 o'clock were overtaken by a very strong gale of ffharbi (west) wind which soon compelled us to stop and make our camels sit. Fearful noise, dust and pitch dark prevailed for'an hour or so, after which we started again, hair,ing at about midnight. Slight’ east wind, rather cool and damp. Slept well The plain is called Helemab. 143. Friday. 2&lt;Jth August —5th Dhil BijjaA.—Started after prayers at 4-30 A.k. Ground is rather wet as .there has been some rain. The route over hard ground full of shrubs and numerous “ sunar ” (kikar) and “ khamt 55 trees, which hamper the n arch and often tear our clothes and khurjins. Soon after sunrise are sighted the black rocks Al-Harrr h in front of us (west and south-west). 141.

Neither he nor any one el 8 e could tell-where we were and many sa|d “dhallaina ^ (we have lost our way), \After watering the camels and nlhr.g our skins we started again at i 1-30 a.m., going very slow m the hope of being met by the Sharifian escort. The route goes winding r0Wg The sandy bed of a “ shuaib 'A(river) with numerous large st surer * tices and other shrubs and high rucks stretching as far as thg eye could see. 145 It was not thought safe to go on without made at 12-30 p.m. Fabaid Bin Na-sar and Abdul watch on three of the nearest hillocks. Camels were xijiiy un-loaded, but weie simply tied up. Those an escort and a halt yvas were sent out to to graze, nor not left who went round collecting -*■:, 21 1 • ' Hrewood carried their rifles, ready for ati emergency. None came and the pickets were called and the march resumed at 2-30 p.m., after a hurried lunch. 146. As we were going along slowly and cautiously, three men were lighted about a mile ahead of us riding on camels and coming in our direc tion,, A halt was ordered and there was a suspense till the men came up slowly. These proved to be the escort so anxiously awaited. They gave us their names as xlwaz al-Asmi, Jabir Ar-Rogi and Said-Ar-Begi. Their party of 30 men had been ordered the previous night by telephone and started from Taif from'three different routes “ to meet Bin Sa’ud’s jama’at of 300 or 400 men They were puzzled to see our small parly, and wondered if it was not a different party and an Akhwan “ GhazU ’\ 147. Took coffee and started again. Asheirah left about four miles to our right (north). There is no permanent population there, I am told, but only temporary Badu equips of Ar-ftogah, Al-JHadhil and others. 148. The route goes winding round hills. At 4 p.4l, we reached a small valley lying under high hills and a party of some ten or twelve Badu were seen on the top of one of these about 800 yards away. They fired ten shots in our direetion,and as others were joining them by twos and threes from behind the hills, about thirty shots more were tired at intervals from this and two othe/rocks. Fortunately, no One )vas hit, although a few shots passed Just oyer our heads. We stopped at once, made our camels sit and sat behind them y hile one of the escort ran up, explained matters and brought off two of the Badu with him. They were Mugatta (Ataibah) Badu, whose Shaikh m Shallah bin Shailyan. The shots they said, were fired only by way of “ ta’aruf ' /(introduction). They had Martini rifles and looked like robbers anu cut throats in spite uf their poor physique and rugged appearance. It 9 . We proceeded going up hill and at 5-30 p.m., began to descend into the Mudbiq,, a narrow rugged and steep pass with high hills on both'sides. Bad to go very slowly and cautiously as the road was very steep and /stony till at last we came out at 7-30 p.m., on a large river-bed, and then ascended some rocks reaching Maghasil (Sail) at 9-30 p m.

We started after taking coffee and tea and at 8 a.m. entered the Holy City which now.seen in daylight appears to be very large aiMw'ell-built, with beautif^l• puc'ea houses having mostly two to four stories, with big broad streets and bazaars all full and bustling with people of all lands.

Just before we, the Nejd Mission, were taken into King Hussain’s presence, the Sharif’Abdullah made apology on his behalf saying: “I pray yqu make every allowance and don’t contradict the old man (al-shaib); you will find him quite impossible with a ‘head of wood ‘ rasu mithl al khashab.’ ” To my mind King Hussain is violently anti-English, though I know Syed Siddiq Hasan does not quite agree I'ith me. Before people, and especially before the members of the mission, the King pretended that the British Government were his friends and supporters, but in private nothing is too bad for them, He continually denounced the English for their deceit and double dealing; especially did he show bitterness over Sir Henry MacMsdion’s so- called premises to him. King Hussein in one of bis outbursts held out his arm and bared his wrist and said : “ The English have encircled Arabia with a band of steel just as a bracelet would encircle my arfn ” He gripped his left wrist with his right hand to bring home bis simile, In my opinion King Hussein is. certainly deeply engaged in a wide propaganda to put Moslems generally against the English and Europeans, This bears Out what Bin Sa’ud told me in Riyadh later and, which 1 believe he has long been trying to explain'to His Majesty’s Government.

Mecca is full of Effendis (ex-Turkish officials). There is no doubt what soever that as long as such rascals are employed by*he Sharif he will never be able to put his house in order. (2) Sharif Ali is a &lt;i faqir” not a man. Has no push or energy. A person altogether of most unpreppssessing*appearance. Tall, thin, with a small head like that of a bird, he has nothing to say for himself. He has almost as bad a temper as his father when he breaks out. Ali holds the title of Governor of Medina. As assistants he has one Shahadth and Sharif bin Mansur. Ali remained in Mecca during our stay there. (3) Sharif ’ Abdallah, is a donkey (hamar) who does nothing but eat and drink and sleep. He does'not even dine, among men nor does he know the meaning of a Shaikh’s tc Mejlis ” or “ Mudheyf ff{ He sups regularly along with his mother ”, and that describes him better than anything I can tell you. For the rest, Sharif ’Abdullah is good-looking, and well-built, but entirely lazy.

He is one of the Imam’s trusted generals. It was he who recently led, 2,000 Akhwan againskthe Harb tribe and captured Safainah and Suwairiyeh on the Meeea-Medina road. This, at the time, was duly reported by King Hussein.

Faisal captured all the camels together with 100 camels of Hilal Al-Mutair, an important merchant of Koweit. These latter will doubtless be returned as Hilal is in secret one of Bin Sa’ud’s supporters. Feeling against Bin Tuwaia wa^ very bitter in Riyadh.

The Imam delivered an oration starting with the quotation from the Quran “ Ati-ul-lah wa Rasuluh ” etc. (Obey God, the Prophet and your rulers) adding that he who disobeys'the ruler becomes n a Kafir (apostate). He then proceeded to say, “ You, 0 people of Nejd are all ignorant of religion. We went up against you and Bin Rashid in support of God’s word (Islam) and God heightened and glorified His word, the true religion, and granted us victory over'all ‘munafiqs’ (hypocrites). Now every one of you has^ wrapped* a piece of white cloth round his head and has stood up claiming religious learning and leadership; every one claims to follow the word of God, but does so only by words not by deeds; this is purely because religion is not ripe (well-ingrained) in your hearts.

Muhammad Bln Rashid, a great Akhwan A’alim who accompanied bin Masud on the expedition against Assir, died in Ibha. Bin Sa ud was much cut up on hearing of this learned man’s death. It means a great loss to Alshwan ranks. ' • - * 17. Before closing up my report I should like to add two final points for the information of higher authority. These are as follows :— (a) The Akhwan are not nearly as bad as I originally thought them, and all the wild stories one hears of Ithem in Iraq and Bahrein are false. Bin Sa’ud has taught them so well that the English are his friends, that whenever yon go among them, if yon only give out that you are an official of the Government, you will receive a great welcome. There are fanatical fools among them, of course, but the majority are endeavouring to purify the religion, and in time v ill be cured of this foolishness and the movement will result in good in the end. (fi) The Imam has the Akhwan absolutely and entirely under control. There is not the slightest fear they will ever get out of hand. There is no dcubt of what I say. (Sd).

They have many attributes which lead one to suppose that they are descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of Arabia, possibly the Himyanfes. They are gr^at camel-owners and breeders but possess no.sheep or crops. Are great hunters, raiders and above all tracker Many are the wonderful stories told of the tracking powers of these wild people. In appearance they are tall well built, wear large-busby beards, and often wear skins in place of cotton clothing. They are well armed and used to be the terror of the Hassa-Nejd trade routes before the present Bin Sa’ud put them down. They are one of the few tribes that know the dreaded “ Ruba’a Al-Khalil ’’for great southern desert. When persued they disappear into its sands and pnly emerge to raid again, whilst they drink camels’ milk and eat camels meat. Their only other food are dates from Jabrin, which is entirelv under their control. At the Jabrin basis are reported to exist extensive ancient ruins. No man knows when they date back to. Very probably they are Himyaritic remains. A visit to Jabrin of the Political Agent, Bahrein, would be well worth while. In the vicinity of Jabrin exist vast herds of oryx. It was from there that the oryx sent Home to Kis Majesty the King by Bin Sa’ud were obtained. The Murrah though under Bin Sa’ud’s control refuse entirely to become Akhwan. Bin Sa’ud takes zikat from them when they migrate during the spring to Hassa. He has found it impossible to cpllect tribute while at Jabnn. The tribe practices circumcision, but only undergo the operation when ftMly grown up^ and only when about to marry. They have no A’alims, and the ceremony of marriage and giving in marriage is performed by the local Shaikh and consists of the simplest of affairs resolving itself into the woman being publicly handed over to her suitor. Though they call themselves Moslems, the Murrah are very easy-going in their religious observances. APPENDIX “H”.

I suggest, tfcers- fore, that either X, myself, should again address ifcn Sa'ud, or that you should do so, calling attention to his previous correspondence with me and eaphaoising the importance attach ed by His Majesty’s Government to the early establishment of this tribunal* 4* 1 have considered in the case, at all events, of the first conference, which would have to decide a mass of daisse, whether it would not be desirable to appoint a president from some other European nation* It appears to me, however, that such an appointment would involve both Xbn Sa*ud and the 1 Irafi Governaent in considerable unnecessary expense, and I tm inclined to suggest, subject of course to the con- / currence of the Honourable the Resident in the °ersian Gulf, that the conference shall be presided over by Major More, the Political Agent at Kuwait$ 5o In regard to the suggestion that disputes which may arise should be settled by direct negotiation, I would point out that such direct negotiation has already been going on for some months between officials of the ’Iraq Government and Hajd officials* The suggestion that local officials on either side should correspond with each other with a view to the settlement of minor troubles as and when they arise, was made to Ibn Sa’ud by Mr* Bourdillon on the £5rd of April, 1926, and was accepted by Ibn Sa'ud (vide telegraa bo46 dated the let May, 1986, from Hie Majesty's Acting Consul, Jeddah, to the Foreign Office). This direct correspondence between local officials has been working satisfactorily and a number of minor raids have been disposed of. It would, however, be impossible to deal in this way with the mass of claims that existed prior to the ratification of the Bahra Agreement, nor.101 &lt;?$ x conceive it to be the desire of Xbn Sa'ud that they should ha so dealt with. *3. 1 asa sending a copy of this despatch to the Honourable Che Resident in the Pewlen Gulf and His Majesty’s Consul Ag&amp;nt at Jeddaiin I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, (sa.)

I would invite your attention to the fact that the letters were written on the very^day of the attack on the Busaiyah post and their wording sug gests that King Ibn Saud was aware of the impending attack and was attempt ing, if not to justify it, at least to excuse it in advance and to charge the Iraq Government with the blame. 3. King Ibn Sand’s protest against the visits of motor cars to the frontier and neutral zones and against the flights of aeroplanes over Nejd territory is somewhat singular in view of the fact that, as reported by Sir Edward Ellington in his telegram No. 558 (No. 617, to Resident, Bushire, and Political, Kuwait) (Enclo. 3 to Serial No. 62), dated the 18th of November 1927, no aeroplane or armoured car had up to the date of the attack on Busaiyah been near the Nejd-Iraq frontier or the neutral zone since last April. His Majesty’s letter on the subject is not very definite and it occurs ro me that he may have bad in mind the proposed Arabian air route from Basrah to Karachi, his objection to which as you are aware he has already based on the alleged military activities of the Iraq Government on the Nejd frontier. 4. Provided you agree, I do not propose to reply to either of these letters until a reply is received from King Ibn Saud to the communication referred to in your telegram No. 409, dated the 14th of November 1927. 5. I would invite your attention in this connection to Sir Edward Ellington’s secret despatch, dated the 21st of October 1927, forwarding a translation of an earlier letter from King Ibn Saud on the subject of the Busaiyah post. Materials for a full reply to this letter have been collected, but the attack on the Busaiyah post occurred before the reply could be des patched, and consequently it has not been sent. 6.

Although I myself do not believe in the truth of _ these rumours, .. however interpret this daring action of certain Iraq officials, in their con struction of this fort only as a means ti bring about misunderstanding and difference between us and Britain. But our desire not to leave any way open for difference to arise between us has induced us frankly to explain to you the facts about the situation in Nejd in order that you may do your best—which we have no doubt you will do—for the solving of this problem and the closing up of the avenue of difference. As you are aware, most of the inhabitants of Nejd are desert-men and that the greater part of their winter abode in winter and spring is in the northern and eastern regions of our country, close to the Iraq frontier and far aw T ay from our headquarters. Aware as I am of the evil effect on their minds of the threat of this fort, I am, fearful of some sort of aggression on it being taken by them, though it may spell the destruction and extermination of their lives. We are afraid of such result which is loathsome to us. That is wiiy we have addressed to you two letters from the Hijaz for the purpose of averting such things before serious developments set in. It is however regretted that we have had no answer from you to our two letters. Out of the desire on our part to expedite the removal of the cause of difference we have written this to Your Excellency, hoping that you will order the removal of these forts which are contrary to Article 3 of the above mentioned Protocol — - £ — i : - 1 - - ^ 1 j • * *• - —j la/ xxx livid o yji tbuuve menuiuneu. and the retention of which is fraught with evil possibilities of a nature that T cannot Vioar l^ocnmiGiKiiifTr frw* ^y&gt;-*t . 1.0 YVJ.LI1 r V 11 JJUohlUillLlUo U1 d ' '~ v / cannot hear.

With reference to my telegram No. 201 of to-day’s date I have the honour to forward herewith in original, together with a translation, the letter therein referred to from His Majesty To King of the Hijaz and Nejd and its Depend encies to His Excellency the High Qommissioner for Iraq. Copy to the Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, together with a copy and translation of the letter. Translation of a letter from His Majesty Sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al-Paisal as-Saud, King of Hijaz, Nejd and Dependen cies, to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq No. 3/M -27—3/M., dated the 12th Jamadial Ula, 1346 (i.e,, 7th November 1927). * I have the honour to state that I wrote to Your Excellency from the Hijaz regarding the construction of forts at Baswah (i.e., Busaiyah) and other places on the frontier, and pointed out that it was contrary to the provisions of Article 3 of the 2nd ITqair Protocol. I also described the bad effect which this action had produced in Nejd, and how it had perturbed the minds of the p eo p] e — a natural result, of which I have been afraid ever since the ponstruc- tion of these forts—in spite of there being high responsible authorities at Baghdad and ’Amman, as you are well aware. The desert people on my fron tier frequently receive provocations.6 I wrote to Tour Excellency the day before yesterday, after I had arrived at Riyadh and described the increasing spirit of disquietude prevalent on the frontier, the ill consequences of which I feared and still fear, as I do not want anything of the sort, which certainly does not please me. As soon as I realised the vehemence of the people’s feelings, I issued strict orders for any movement on the frontier to be suppressed, as I am all for solv ings, the question amicably in accordance with the law:. Since writing you my letter No. 3/M -27—2/M., dated the 10th Jamadi al-Ula, 1346 {i.e., 5th November 1927) a report has reached me that some desert people have decided to go out, or have actually gone out Irom some unknow-n place, to oppose the construction of the fort. 1 have not yet obtained any confirmation of this, hut I immediately ordered the forces resposible for the safety of the frontier to follow r them and investigate the report that they have crossed mv frontier, and if possible, prevent them from doing so. I hope to hear that they have been stopped, but T have ordered their arrest and punishment if the story about them be true. I want you to know that this new r s has reached me so that you may realise the extent of the disquietude caused by the construction of the forts, which, in fact, is contrary to our previous agreements, as also the difficulties w hich the Government of this country is experiencing in preventing these incidents that have dimmed the whole atmosphere of the relations between the British Gov ernment and myself—merely for the sake of erecting these ill-omened forts. It is my earnest hope that I received timely help from His Excellency the High Commissioner in having the building demolished, so as to enable me to pacify the hearts of the people in this country, and prevent the occurrence of untoward happenings throughout the length of the frontier lyini? between me and those countries, which lies at a full month’s journey a wav and itself extends for a similar length ^ u u cu Usual Ending., i 869(C) F&amp;Pdl ^ B ®SR*nE3Sgg»ig5g5 ( 68 ) Endorsement from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulp, DATED THE 14th DECEMBER 1927.

We regret the action of the Iraq Government in these days which is a breach of tbe agreements entered into between us and them for the preserva tion of peace and order between the two countries. We see in each incident that takes place between us and them a proof that it was not done with good intention by the Iraq Government and I give in detail a number of recent incidents from which you can understand the real situation between us both. The Shammar tribes who took refuge in Iraq used to raid on the Nejd frontier and we have protested against such raids at that time. I do not want to repeat in full the details of what happened. After some time the High Commissioner for Iraq warned us that a party of Shammar had left Iraq and were gathering in the Syrian desert with the intention of raiding our tribes in our country Nejd. This w'as about the month of November last year. We took this action to be contrary to the agreements for the prevention of raids as tbe raiding tribe cannot enter our territory without entering either the boundaries of Trans-Jordania or Iraq. We protested against the Iraq Govern ment for allowing this and asked for the prevention of such incidents. But the High Commissioner for Iraq kept quiet and did not reply to our protest at all. However, after ten months of our protest the Iraq Government began to build military stations near the wells and places near the frontier and spread a rumour that they were going to join up those places by railway lines and will then make them strong military fortresses on our bound aries, whereas Article III of Hqair protocol of I2th Rabi II, 1341, does not allow any building at the wells and stations near the fron tier. We protested against this action which had the worst effect among the Nejd tribes and caused undescribable excitement and rage. We sent our above mentioned protest to the High Commissioner for Iraq on 9th Rabi I, 1346, but t he High Commissioner neglected to reply to this protest of ours and replied only to our first protest against the egress of the Shammar from Iraq to Syria with the intention of raiding our country. He said that as it is the intention of the Iraq Government to take precautions for the prevention of the going out of such raiders they have established them {i.e. posts) on the fiontier adjoining Nejd territory which, as you can see, are far from the road from which the runaway have come to Syria aud has no relation with that (road). The number of fortresses has been mentioned in his letter which we received in August 3.927, No. 9963, while the erection of such fortresses is forbidden in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. .

Both Governments on the part of each of them under take not to use the water and wells existing at the borders of the boundary or any military purposes such as the building of forts at them or the mobilisa- tion. of troops at their borders). This is the wording of the article three of Ljair Protocal dated 12th Rabi-al-Awal 1341. Would not then Busaiyah, the places belonging to it, the waters near by it and other places at the border come under this article which had forbidden building at them. Was there any mention in the article about the miles or the distance ? And is that building a breach of this article or not f If they (Iraq) pretend that this breach was in our interest for prevent- ing raiders from raiding us the INajdis consider such sort of a building as a breach of their treaties and precisely the road that leads trouble to them. Therefore I can see only two clear methods of meeting the situation, either the abovementioned article is considered in force in which case the buildings erected should be removed and Busaiyah should be the first of them as they are contrary to the provisions of the said article or this article is not to be carried out and the forts built are not removed in which case the treaties with the Iraq Government will all be considered cancelled, for which we shall feel very sorry for the obstinacy which the Iraq Government display. We still repeat our protest against the breach of that article and ask for the removal of the buildings which have been erected at the earliest date in compliance with the. undertakings in the interests of order and as a precaution against troubles which arise on account of letting matters lapse and become critical at the frontier as we have explained in our previous letters to His Excellency the High Commissioner on the subject* Usual ending.6 Enclosure XIII of Serial No. (98).

We are in receipt of your letter No. 128-0. of 22nd Jamad al Awal I3 t 6 conveying’ a message sent by the Hon’ble the Political Resident to us, in which he states that H. B. M.’s Government were astonished at the recent incident at Busaiyah. We request you to telegraph to him (the Political Besident) that we were more astonished and regret very much its occurrence. W r e have issued orders for enquiries about the people who had done it and tor their punishment. At the same time we have issued orders for a stricter watch on the frontier and have taken all the necessary steps to prevent any further action until the end of the correspondence regarding this evil omened fort which has been erected only for purposes of intrigue and for causing troubles. As regards the compensation referred to in the letter it is a trifling thing which is not worthy of causing a dispute between us and the British Government. But before discussing this matter we want to invite the attention oi the just British Government to the matter of the responsibility and on whom it falls in this case, whether on us or the Iraq Government ? A second thing—This case should be compared with the others like it which have taken place between Iraq, Trans-Jordina and Nejd and Hejaz. Eor when the responsibility is faced and the matter is compared with the previous incidents the compensation can be fixed. W r e—and we believe that the justice of the British Government will support us—see that the responsibility falls on the Iraq Government as they alone had caused this incident. W r e have already warned the Iraq Govern ment of the bad results which may fallow on their behaviour towards us. But the only reply was silence or procrastination or lame explanations. The Hon’ble the Political Besident on referring to our letter of 30th Jamad-al-Awal 13l6—25th November 1927 will observe the difficulties and troubles which the Iraq Government have caused and are causing to give rise to a dispute between us and themselves and in addition to that to cause trouble between us and the British Gevernment. VV hen one’looks at all the actions of the Iraqi Government towards us one will not see that they are the actions of a friendly neighbour to one in treaty with them but the spirit of an enemy will be seen and rather you can say that they are a breach of the spirit of peace. I give in detail a chain of actions done by them (Inq) in these days from which you can understand their real situation and it will make clearer to H. B. M’s. Government the responsibility for che recent incidents. 1. The High Commissioner for Iraq warned us that a raiding party of bhammar were collecting in Syria to raid our country and that the Iraq Government were not responsible for their action. I protested as the raiders were bound to pass on their way to our country either through the territorv of lians-Jordania or Iraq and asked that the responsibility of the same mav be borne either by the Imq Government or Trans-Jordania but the reply was as I have informed the Hon’ble the Political Resident in mv abovementioned Je ter a silence for about 10 months without a .reply. Then came a renlv ;&gt;ui in a very strange way as be made our protest a means of breakim? the nm “T mt °„1 Ujair wi * L thfi ^ 4 building a number oT forts t protection and for preventing raiders from raiding n&lt;s mr _ would be pleased if the Iraqis raided them eveo “ornL d ev J ^71 they do not agree to the building of one metre oi the waters and thPnlaces on vs Inch building has been prohibited by an official document TL i CGb are visited by them and are their wateriig places as weT! *' i these I ,laces and watering for others than them S Cb e hrlke ex* ““ l '“ ns ” ,| ”— 1 *««»2. The Iraq Government were not satisfied with, this sort of breach hut began to interfere with the chiefs of our tribes and called them to attend its meetings (conferences). This is totally prohibited by the provisions of the treaties entered into at Ujair and Bahrain An example of this is a letter from the Mutassarrif of Divaniyah to Mahammed-al-Turki bin Mijlad and Jaza bin Mijlad asking them to look into the claims relating to the plunder of the tribes. We have protested against this action in a letter which we send to the High Commissioner for Iraq, dated the 1st Rabhal-Awal 1346 but no reply has been received from the High Commissioner up to this hour and we cannot understand the cause for this neglect. 8. The motor cars of the Iraq Government officials and also some aero planes are alwmys going as far the frontier and mix with our Arabs. This is dune wdth the intention of having an effect on our tribesmen either to per suade them to commit an act which will cause dissension between neighbours or for some other reason of which v r e cannot see the justification. 4. Those W'ho study some of the Iraq newspapers especially the papeis connected with the High officials of the Iraq Goverment vill see from the attacks and insult against us and our Government show 7 indications of the amount of hatred and hidden (bad) feeling. From this you w r ill see fhat t e Iraq Government have broken our treaty first by allowing hex officials to communicate with our subjects and by allowing their officials to visi our country wdth their motor cars among our tribes to cause sedition and have broken their promise by building these posts the building of w ic i is no permissible and have shown in their new spapers a com i ion - ^ ea s 0 } kindling of the flame of enmity between the two countries. o icn be responsible for all this for the incidents which may be caused by some of those people whose feelings have been roused. ney for respect dishonoured, their treaties broken an en ^ . i ^ his chance inside those buildings. They went w ^ out of f ^ Government, I prevented the Ne 3 d people totally ^ raxdmg fmm the date we entered into treaty for the prevention of the rams and i i. u -.i, .. lT1 i rr) n srip. But raids on us have never oeeu have held them with ^ Trans-Jordania. The Nejd people discootmued either by the Iraq ^ ^ ented as they were respectin;; the obeyed us with much pa,tience oto „ D gids. But I bad no excuse to put undertaking we have taker , ,J , Jl, „ As they had seen the provision before them about this evil omened buildm A y prevented them of the treaties which prevent such buildmg and that we nave J from building such post in similar stations within our , y- We warned the British Government to bok wd| justice on this case then they wOl see that we are the people who comply witn preser ve what belong to others.

They are most anxious that arrangements should be made at the earliest possible date for full oral discussion between Ibn Saud and competent British officer. They find it difficult to understand Ibn Sand’s attitude on the question of Busaiyah post and think it possible that he may be under some real misapprehension which oral explanations could remove.

On the other hand it is probable he will re-establish his authority by persuasion and peaceful means and will then he in a position to keep tribes qmet, at any rate for some time This is what is hoped wi 1 happen as anvthing would he better than the appaling chaos which would follow revo- lution in Nejd even if it did remove ban on trade with Kuwait. Meanwhile recent events and success in raid which Dawish has up to the present enjoyed are having a very prejudicial effect on our prestige in Arabia (Iraq Government has no prestige and is looked on as a negligible quantity). It is argued our aeroplanes cannot protect the frontier or harm raiders. Our respect°for treaties and frontiers is not understood : our reason for not retalia ting and punishing Mutair by bombing them or their villages is that we Cannot ? or dare not. Were we to take such a course and go right into Nejd to punish them Ibn Sand might possibly protest but really he would be very pleased. Unless our aircraft have good fortune to get an opportunity to teach them a severe lesson soon not only will all desert tribes inevitably become Akhwan soon but the movement would probably spread to the Jezireh.

In arguing against po^t at Busaiyah he is more than probably merely voicing frontier tribal opinion not because be wants to, but because he has to do so and ms statement that this post and others projected have caused excite ment amongst frontier tribes is correct. My own information corroborates political Agent, Kuwait, that Ibn Saud would not be sorry to see Faisal al Dawish disappear but he cannot take action to this effect himself. I have to-day received telegram from Bahrain saying letter has come Horn Ibn Saud in answer to my letter sent under sanction of your telegram 438, dated 9th December, saying that he is detained by pressure of work at Biadh but hopes to meet me later. I think there is little doubt that he is post poning meeting until situation clears and until he has taken such steps as he can.

Telegram P., from the Secretary of State for Colonies, London, to High Commissioner, Baghdad, No. 1, dated the 2nd January 1928. (Repeated Political Resident, Bushire.) My telegram of 30th December. Akhwan raids. Whole question has now been further considered. His Majesty’s Govern ment are convinced that whatever may be the personal attitude of Ibn Saud towards raids, as to which results of Haworth’s conversation with Ibn Saud must be awaited, it is essential that early steps should be taken to make raiders understand that further aggression on their part will not be tolerated. In view of the difficulty of catching raiders red-handed, which would clearly be best and most effective method, only practicable course appears to be to attack their headquarters from the air. Selection of particular villages etc., most suited for such attack must be left to your decision in consultation with Air Officer Commanding. Air Ministry suggest following objectives as possibly suitable for purpose Hafar al Batin, Jariyah Al Ilyah, Jariyah as Siflah. 'Would no doubt consider what advanced bases it would be necessary to establish in order to facilitate attack. Question of bombing main tribal headquarters at Artawiyah has also been raised but the place could presumably be reached only from bases in Kuwait and political objections using Kuwait territory for such a purpose are obvious. I shall he glad to have your views on this point. You should send immediate message to Ibn Saud informing him of latest raid and stating that we regard it as absolutely essential to take nunitive action against raiders who, by his own admission, are acting m direct defiance of his authority. He will understand these measures indicate no hostilities towards himself but are temporary expedients forced upon us by renditions arising out of his loss of control over his own tribesmen. It should be made clear to him that our action will take the form of bombing Tillages of guilty tribes.6 exercised that no action is taken against any place which has been occupied by Ibn Sand’s regular troops or where his authority has been re-established. As to this you will no doubt confirm rumour mentioned in your telegram No. 622 that Artawiyah has been occupied by Ibn Sand’s forces. You will doubtless do all that is possible by show of force or such other means at your disposal to restore confidence of wavering Iraqi tribesmen. Enclo. XY of Serial No (99).

Summary of correspondence with Ibn Sa’ud, etc. No. Description. Reference to correspondence. 1 Correspondence was initiated by the High Commissioner in July 1926, with the object of warning Ibn Sa’ud that certain Shammar tribes who had mig rated from Traq to Syria were believed to be contemplating raids on Najd. In reply to a request from Ibn Sa^ud that more effective measures should be taken by the ‘'Iraq Government to prevent raid ing, the High Commissioner informed him through the British Consul, Jiddab, off the measures taken to this end and also sent a list of the Shammar tribes believed to he in Syria. The High Commis sioner added that while the Traq Government could not accept responsibility for raids carried out by such tribes against Najd, they would do their best to prevent raiding parties from crossing Traq territory. ' ,Summary of correspondence with Jbn Sudd etc. contd Ibn Sa ; ud replying to the British Consul said that he must protest to Syria ; if the raids continued however and if the raiders were allowed to traverse the’Iraq corridor he could not be he responsible for reprisals taken by his ri es. e enclosed at the same time a list of raids to show what his tribes had suffered. The British Consul in acknowledging receipt pointed out that some of the raids mentioned had already been dealt with and that the remainder were receiving attention but th»t he was forwarding tie list to Baghdad. No further reply was sent to Ibn Sa’ud by Commissioner. the High Ibn Sa ; ud’s letter No. 166 r dated 22nd October, 1926, Consul Jiddak's letter No. 679-M., da ( ed 27th October, 1926. In November Ibn Sahid wrote a further letter to t e British Consul drawing attention to the importance of checking raids from '’Iraq and emphasising the fact that though the raiders may have come from Syria, none the less they had to pass through ’Iraq territory and consequently the ’Iraq Govern ment must hear the responsibility. He urged that this matter should be settled at the earliest date possible. No reply was sent to this letter. The Secretary of State commenting on Ibn Sa ad’s letter (see 2) considered that some responsibility rested on ’Iraq in respect of raiding parties traversing the ’Iraq corridor and asked for pro posals for preventing such raids. The High Commisdoner replied in February 1927 giving details of the different ’ Iraq Police posts designed to intercept raiding parties. (Busaiyah w’as not included.)

The list of posts was amended by the Ministry of Interior, and Busaiyah was included. High Commissioner’s No. 9963, dated August, 192?.. letter 17th. Note ,—Busaiyah was first occupied by camel police on 15th October 192U. During 1927 the Police began build ing a small fortified post to accommodate and pro tect the garrison which consisted of 10 men only. 11 was the building of this post which enraged Faisal al Dawish and the Akhwan. I In September 1927, Ibn Sa’ud addressed to 'the High Commissioner a protest against the building of barracks and forts at Busaiyah on the ground that it constituted an infringement of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. (This letter war written before the receipt of the H&gt;gh Commissioner’s letter referred to under No. 8.) He asked that British Government should not connive at bremh of treaty by ’Iraq.

The Colonial Office, after 16 days'delay, telegraphed that Jiddah has been authorised to communicate reply to ibn Sa'ud ; suggested that the message should also be sent through Bus hi re, as Ibn Sa'ud was reported to have left for Hasa. This was done, (though it turned out that Ibn Sa'ud was still at Riyadh). Note .—An acknowledgment of this message was received by Consul Jiddah from the Hizaj Ministry of Koreign Affairs who disputed the location of Busaiyah.

In fche meantime a further letter was received from Ibn Sa'ud acknowledging receipt of the High Com- m ssioneCs letter of August 17th (See No. 8) point ing out that the High Commissioner had taken nearly a year to answer his letter and that erection of “ frontier ” posts by the 'Iraq Government, even though intended to check raiding into Najd, were contrary to the Uqair Protocol. He must therefore insist on the removal of these fortifications which alarm and commotion among his were causing tribe?. ftote.- -This letter was referred to the ’Iraq Government and it was proposed to supply Tbn Sa ud with detailed information of the position and strength of the posts- The ’Iraq Government agreed and supplied the information, but the attack on Busaiyah intervened and the letter was not sent. On Novemlier 5th, the day of the Bnsaiyab attack, Ibn Sa'ud wrote to the High Commissioner that on arrival at Riyadh he found that the tnbes wwe tilled with resentment on account of the milna y activities of the ‘ Iraq Government; he added that the tribes were on. the'Iraq fronber far from Headquarters and he could not guarantee the safety of the’frontier unless the frontier forts were dis mantled In a second letter wrttten on the same Tv he referred to the resentment aroused among the tribes by the flights of British ™ their territory and the vrsifcs of cars to the tront.er and neutral zone. _ r . wii ru,, SrPrirl wrote a further letter to On November 7th, ibn oa u infnrmation the High rartS? dLrt tribes had ^ g nt ouUo op^ the construction of the actually go ^ He had sent forces in pursuit to stop them and'to effect their High Commissioners tele gram No. 480, dated 12th October, 1927.

On 8th December, 1927, a telegram was received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, saying that Shaikh Hafidh (Ibn Sa'ud's representative, who had been sent to Kuwait to attend the conference) had been instructed by Ibn Sahid to warn the High Com missioner that serious trouble had broken out in Nejd and that a force was marching north contrary to his orders. The Secretary of State authorised the Political .Resident, Bushire/ to despatch to Ibu Sa’ud a message acknowleding the warning referred to in para. 16 and informing him of the conflict between British seroplanes and an Akhwan force in the neutral zone on December 9th and adding that as a temporary expedient and until Ibn Sa’ud had re established control of the frontier areas, British seroplanes would pursue Akhwan raiding parties across the Nejd frontier where necessary to inflict a lasting and salutary lesson, On November 30th Ibn Sa’ud wrote to the Political Resident, Bushire, referring to past correspondence between himself and the High Commissioner claim ing that his protests against raids from ’Iraq had been ignored and then answered by the crea tion of frontier posts in defiance of the Uqair Protocol. He had protested again and again against the creation of these posts without effect. The re sponsibility for subsequent events rests with the 3 Iraq Ijovernment. Reference to correspondence.
