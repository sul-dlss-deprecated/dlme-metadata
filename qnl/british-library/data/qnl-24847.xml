Your telegram No. 1152: Persia. State Department will instruct United States Embassy at Tehran to take similar action. They will instruct United States Embassy to point out in so doing the danger that the controversy which would be caused in Persia by the convening of a Constituent Assembly would almost certainly be so acute as to prevent the Majlis from doing any constructive work for a considerable time, that such a controversy at the present moment would have serious effects abroad since it would lay Persia open to intrigues of all kinds and that the ability of both the United States and the United Kingdom to support Persia's resistance to foreign pressure would be greatly lessened by disunity within Persia. 2. The State Department believe that even the constitution of a Senate might cause a certain amount of controversy, since a proportion of the Senators would be nominated by the Shah. On the other hand there would be some advantage in having simultaneous elections for both the Majlis and the Senate since some of the more obstructive members of the Majlis might desire to enter the Senate and their ambitions in this direction might to some extent lessen the amount of hostility to its establishment. They suggest that, if th^re is time, our two Embassies should consult together as to the possibility of suggesting to the Shah that he might wait to see whether the Majlis will pass the bill for the seven year plan before taking action about the Senate, in order to prejudice as little as possible the chances of its early passage, but they realise that the Shah may be too anxious to initiate some measure of constitutional reform rapidly for such delay to be practical politics.

There are important considerations on either side. Apart from the intense propaganda attacks on the Persian Government and still more on American intervention in Persia, Soviet-Persian relations are relatively quiet. It may be undesirable to stir them up 9 Secondly it is by now a well-established part of the Persian Government's foreign policy that while they in fact realise that their interests lie with.the west, they must maintain a kind of fictitious balance in their relations between the east and the west, i.e. if they take some anti-Russian action such as communicating their.correspondence to the Security Council or if the Americans do it for them, they will be tempted either to make some conciliatory gesture to Russia or to take some step contrary to Anglo-American interests 0 2, We know that some Persians at least have had doubts of the effectiveness of American help if an emergency arose. If the proposed American action took a form calculated to set such doubts at rest it would be valuable in stiffening Persian opinion, but the actual form of United States action would have to be carefully considered from this point of view.

According to information from more than one person in the Shah s confidence, His Majesty is determined to go ahead with his plan for the convention of a constituent Assembly on the lines indicated in my telegram under reference. In that event he will issue the necessary decree^ not later than next week, and if he is to be dissuaded there is therefore no time to be lost, 2. When I last saw the Shah I understood, as I reported at the time, that he intended to consult further with laqizadeh about the manner and timing of launching his programme of constitutional reform. ~ I have not yet been able to ascertain whether he has done this, and if so what the result has been, but I understood that he intended to discuss the matter with me again on my return from the south, and I have no doubt that he will do so. I am however conscious of the risk that, if my next audience is delayed, I may find myself confronted by what is virtually a fait accompli. I have reason to believe that some of the Shah’s own entourage and his sunporters outside the household e.g. Hajir are very definitely of the opinion that the time is not ripe for the convention of a Constituent Assembly and I suspect that His Majesty is being urged to take action again by Ebtehaj who has told me that ne believes that the constitutional reform should be put through during the life of the present Majlis. 3. The line I have taken hitherto with your approval has been, while not opposing the_constitutional reform in principle, to urge consultation, as regards the timing and execution, in most responsible quarters. It would therefore be open to me to ask the Shah whether the action he now proposes to take has been recommended to him by Taqizadeh and other responsibleSECRET.

I would go on to say that I consider the present time singularly ill- chosen for committing the country to one national roll after another within the space of a few months. [Grp.undec.]His Majesty objects that the action must be taken during the life of present Majlis, I should urge him to consider as an alternative course the early [? grp.omitted] Constitutional Senate. This would not entail raising the reform issue now, but as the Senate and the Majlis would to get her _ form the Constituent Assembly, it should greatly facilitate doing so at a later stage, and should dispose of any valid argument in favour of pushing the constitutional reform through before the general election. 4. It would greatly strengthen my hand if you would authorise me to speak to His Majesty on the above lines, and I shall be grateful for immediate instructions to that effect. But if I am not summoned to an audience during the next two days, I may feul obliged to ask for one, and in that event I shall speak as suggested failing instructions to the contrary.

It seems Taqizadeh has advised the Shah to convene a Constituent Assembly. This body would consist of two representatives from each constituency one of whom might be a member of the present Majlis. The decree may be issued in about three weeks time i.e. about three wee' before.the c cree ordering the next general election. If this time table is adopted the Constituent Assembly will mee - in April, the election will begin in May and the new.Majlis will assemble in July. The Shah hoped that in addition to the reforms already contemplated the Constituent Assembly.wouLd pass a bill to reform electoral procedure. If this is done the next election cannot entail a repetition of the farcical procedure which has been the custom hitherto 5. His Majesty said that he intended to discuss the matter fur .her with Iknizadeh and would let me know the outcome when I returned, to Tehran from the south at the end of next week.

CQNEIDEI\T I^L 7th December, 194-6, Sir, MONTHLY REPORT FOR NOVE^ffiER 1948. With reference to my despat ch No. 155 o£- the Ird November, I have the honour to submit the following report of events in Persia during November 194b. The failure of the Majlis to carry out any of the measures proposed by M. Hajir, the obstruction caused by the constant withholding of the quorum in the Chamber, and opposition to his government outside it, finally induced him to resign on November 6 th in spite of a further vote of confidence; he was replaced by M, Mohammed Sa^d, whose government had not, however, become firmly established and had not even received its initial vote of confluence by the end of the month. The political situation therefore remains unstable and uneasy and there have been increased Tudeh activity and prepara tions. There were no developments of note in Persia’s foreign relations. FOREIGN AF FAIRS 2. The Soviet Ambassador, M. Sautchikov, returned from leave and consultation with his government on November 1st. The Soviet Consul- General at Tabriz, Resht and Kemanshah have also returned. No further incidents took place on the Scviet-Persian frontier, but the Moscow wireless maaejplay with a visit by some United States A r my Officers to Azerbaijan ns a further /instance The Right-F r nourable Ernest Bevin, M,?., His Majesty’s Principal Secrc^ry' of state ^ for Foreign Affairs, The Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 . 1949instance of American interference in Persian affairs. Since his return M. Ssdtchikov has made it apparent that the removal of the United States military and gendarmerie missions is the first objective of Soviet policy in this country. In spite of earlier conflicting statements, it became clear during the month that the Persian Goveriment has not, in fact, communicated to the Security Council the notes which passed between them and the Soviet Goveriment on this subject last spring. 3. The American Ambassador, Mr. 7/iley, left Tehran on November 22nd for leave in the United States. There have been additions to the strength of the United States military mission, especially on the Air Force side, and the heads of both this mission and the gendarmerie mission have been changed. The agreement for the supply of military equipment to Persia from the United States, and that prolonging the contract of the military mission, have now been signed. The first deliveries of arms, including tanks, are expected to take place at Bandar Shahpur in mid-January. A group of industrial and engineering experts from the American consortium, Overseas Consultants Incorporated, visited Persia from November 14th to December 2 nd to make a preliminary study cf the Seven-Year Plan and to indicate those sections of it for which foreign experts should be engaged. Their presence in the country has been attacked by the Left-Wing press as evidence of the Persian Government 1 s subservience to United States policy. 4. The new Houmanian Minister presented his Letters of Credence on November 8 th. A Finnish Minister, Baron Pusekimen, has also arrived in Tehran but has not yet presented his letters. THE ROYAL FAMILY 5. On November 19 th tha press published a Court announcement cf th= divorce of the Shah and £ueen Fawzieh, which it attributed to the unfavourable influence of the Tehran climate on Her Majesty 1 s health. The announcement was published side by side with one issued by the ; i n Cairo regarding the div.rc^ of F^roi^c. HjTSRNAL AFFA IRS 6 * M. Azad*s long-pending interpail ;ti n was finally taken on the 27^ October ana lasted until November 3rd, ranging widely over issues of internal and external pciioy. M. Hrjir had no difficu • ty in demolishing thL criticism, and on Novcmtar h received anot'nr substantial vote of confidence, only b deputies voting against him.. He at cnee tr ed by enquiries from tae deputies to discover whether this support would be translated inU action by the passag- 3 - 6240 I r. 194$ of the Budget, He evidently received an ^ ~ unsatisfactory reply and resigned on November 6th having failed, through obstruction, to carry out any major item of his progranme. 7. The Shah then sent for the leaders of the Majlis fractions to consult on the appointment of the next Prime Minister. This experiment in constitutional practice failed to elicit a clear answer, and His Majesty thereupon referred the matter to the President of the Majlis who obtained the signed agreement of 63 deputies recommending the appointment of M. Mohammed Sa’ed (Tehran Personalities No.134). The Royal Firman appointing M. Sa*ed issued on November 8th$ he was, however, a long time forming his Cabinet (by the usual process of bargaining with the Majlis fractions), which included many members of M. Hsji^s government. A number of deputies were dissatisfied that all their nominees had not been included and accordingly prevented M. Sa*ed from presenting hie government to the Chamber on November 20th by absenting themselves and withholding the quorum. After twenty-four hours of confusion the government presented itself to the Majlis on the following day. 8 . M. Saied's declaration of policy gave prominence to his intention to execute the Seven- Year Plan^ to take various measures for the benefit of the population and particularly the workers and peasants^ to continue negotiations with the Oil Company 5 to reclaim Persian territory now under foreign rule (no specific mention of Bahrein) and to pass the budget and reorganise the Civil Service. This programme, however, has not yet been capproved by the Majlis, although more than three weeks have passed since it was first femulated by the Prime Minister, for as soon as the debate opened Mr. Razavi, deputy for Kerman, started a long speech attaching the Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Caspian fisheries. J&amp;e speech occupied the Majlis for an entire we£k. He was followed by Mp« Batman-Ghelich, deputy for Ardebil, who spoke in favour of the Government. His illiteracy moved the hilarity of the House and his personal attacks caused one of the usual scenes. Mr. Batman-Ghelich was still speaking at the end of the month and meanwhile the Government, having had no vote of confidence, is unsure of its future. The sole measure passed by the Majlis in the last month is yet another provisional twelfth of that part of the Budget which covers the payment of Government salaries. Considerable progress was made curing the month towards the launching of the Seven-Year Plan. The visit of the advance party of experts from Overseas Consultants Incorporated (see paragraph 3)- 4 has ar&amp;used public interest, and the supporters of the Plan are confident of the early passage tnrough the Majlis of the Enobling Act. The advance party ie expected to recommend to the Persian Goverrment the engagement of about 40 foreign experts would come to Persia early in 1949 for four months to draw up a detailed programme of the work to be carried out under the Plan. The Persian Government has approved this proposal in principle, out the required Decree has net yet been signed. Before leaving, the leader of the party made a public statement to the effect that they considered that the Seven-Year Plan was workable and that the agricultural section cf the Plan was the most important and might probably occupy the first two or three years. 10. Sir Herbert Stewart and Dr. Murray of the British Midole East Office each accompanied the Americans on part cf their tour in the provinces, am Colonel Alistair Gibb, of Sir Alexander Gibb arid Partners, visited Tehran specially in order to meet the group. The American visitors welcomed th£ information and assistance which the British experts gave them, and co-operation was most cordial. They invited Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners to join the group for the next stage of their work and indicated their willingness to leave the sections of the Plan dealing with agriculture, statistics and forestry in the hands cf the experts from the British Middle East Office. 11. One cf the first acts of the Sated Government was to lift the ban on the movement of wheat in certain provincial areas where smuggling had been rife. This measure d^es not appear, so far, to have had the desired effect of bringing wheat out of hoarding, and the price continues to rise. The Government are now negotiating with the United States Government for 100,000 tons of wheat and 12,000 tons of flour. VJith these additional stocks under their control it is hoped before long to compel the hoarders to disgorge. Action is also being taken to increase the number cf bakeries in the capital with 0 view to ensuring a better distribution of bread. In spite of steadily rising prices, there has been little overt evidence of industrial unrest during November. At a Kerman textile factory and at the Agricultural Bank in Tehran, however, there were two minor strikes which appear to have been spontaneous and based on legitimate economic grievance. There have been no changes in wage rates during the month, and the current statutory minimum wage rates etill bear little relationship to the high c«-st of living. Some progress has, however, been made in the development cf a co-operative movement; new societies are in process of formation at Shiraz and Yezd, and f-r railway workers in Tehran. Discussione between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Persian Alinistry- 5 - Ministry Lsbcur on the immediate action to be taken to inaugurate societies in Khuzistan were satisfactory. 12. The Second Annual General Congress cf the ESKI Trade Union took place in Tehran during the month. It was composed of lOJ delegates from Tehran and the provinces claiming to represent 71 separate Trade Unions with a membership cf. 70,000. The Presidents report was an admission of negligible achievements during the year. Rivalry between the two principal leaders of ESKI (Hed?.yat and Gezelbash) over the selection of the Tehran delegates to the Congress led to the dismissal fr^m the organisation of Gezelbash who now proposes to form a new Trade Union of his own. IRE PROVINCES 13* A more active phase of Tudeh and Communist tactics seems to have begun, both in the provinces and at Tehran. Further preparations for subversive action are reported to have been made in Tehran; the town has been dividea up into operational areas and Tudeh agents have been instructing their followers about their duties in an emergency; and a number of 'muhajjirs M and Caucasians have recently made their appearance in the capital. Tudeh activity has increased in the schools and at Tehran university, and an official ban on political activities among students, imposed by the Hajir government, led to a so- called strike of university students organised by Tudeh. 14. ludeh and Russian agents are reported from Resht and Kermanshah to be canvassing the villages, and in the south the Central Union of the Tuaeh is apparently making an energetic appeal for more funds and the Party is foming new cells. A number of Tudeh leaders expelled from the A. I.O.C. concession area after the general strike of 1946 are returning, ana other suspected Tudeh agents are arriving from Tehran and are reported to be in touch with the Russian Consulate at Ahwaz. In Isfahan, Tudeh efforts are less successful and the Governor-General has managed to expel three Tudeh organisers who recently arrived from Tehran, and is confiscating all copies of the Tudeh paper MARDOM. There ore reports from several provinces of successful attempts by Governors-General to interest the C e ntral Government in reformsand improvements in their provinces. The Governor- General of Seistan has apparently secured approval for several Imp rtant measures, including the construction cf a reservoir at a cost cf £90,000 to /protectprotect Seiotan against any future shortage in the Helmand water, and the improvement of roads in his area. The new Governor-General of Azerbaijan has also secured appropriations for Azerbaijan factories, and in Fars M. Ardalan^ the Governor- General and formerly Minister of Communications, has obtained authority for improving various reads and bridges. 16,. Soviet wireless propaganda to Azerbaijan continues extremely active and has fastened particularly on the alleged penetration of the province by American military advisers. The return to Tabriz of Arkadi Krasnikh, Soviet Consul- General under the Democrats, is also significant since he has been on leave for no less than seven months. The new Governor-General, although he is apparently wtll liked ; seems to lack the strength of character necessary for countering strong Soviet pressure. Nevertheless, the loyalty of the province is not yet seriously in doubt. *17. There has been no major trouble in the tifibal areas, though minor internal conflicts are Reported from the Boir Ahmadi country; but both in the Bakhti^ri country and in Fars the authori ties are meeting with difficulties in their plans for grain collection. The Governor of the Bakhtiari, Menuchehr Khan, whose position seems insecure, has gone to Tehran and left the Army and the Ministry of Finance with the responsibility of collecting grain in his area. Nor has General Alavi Moqhaddam, who has been on a similar mission in Fars, been much more successful; faced with tribal opposition, he has agreed to allow the tribes to dispose privately (that is, for smuggling) of half their grain surplus. But the smugglers in Bushire are reporteo to be determined to resist the Government’s preventive measures. Both M^hamned lussein Khan Qashgai and the new General Officer Commanding Fars Division, General Mo’tazadi, have confirmed beth their own and the tribes 1 friendliness towards Britain. 18. There has been a marked revival of religious feeling on the occasion of Muharram, which has exc ..oed in fervour anything seen for some years. In Tfbriz it is reported that five men □ led to death after self-inflicted wounds: in Ahwaz a strict ban &gt;.n the sale of alcohol was maintained during the s-. 2 rud month; a group of merchants in Kermanshah h v^ token the law into their own hands in preventi ' ; the sale of alcohol and the supply of electricity t.o the distillery: ana even in Tehran the number of ..°nds parading the streets during the month was murh greater then in the previous years. 19« In m ny •'.reas the price of food is on Uhe increase ana wheat supplies are precarious.

My telegram No. 979. Radio Tehran broadcast a statement on January 5rd in reply to allegations on the Moscow wireless on December 31st to the effect that a dictatorship had been re-established in Persia. These were apparently based on press comment about the explosion of anti-aircraft rounds (reported in my telegrams Nos. 995 and 1001) and Moscow linked them with the activities of the American military mission. 2« _ Persian statement emphasised that the explosions on 19th December had been fully explained by the communiques issued by the ..unistry of War and the police. Subsequent investigations by a commission of qualified experts confirmed accuracy of these communiques and showed that there was no room for doubt. It was therefore deplorable that the Moscow wireless had transmitted unfounded statements about snooting affrays and had made them the pretext for saying that dictatorshiphad been re-established. Such tactics showed the unreliability of the sources used by Moscow wireless and showed up still more the irresponsibility of other allegations through the same channel about military activities in Persia* My last Saving telegram to Washington was No. 17, Moscow No. 16, British Middle East Office Cairo No. 16.

Persian Government's programme. I intended to defer calling on Prime Minister until the time came to speak to him about Median line but as further delay might have been interpreted as a coolness towards him and his Government I decided to call on him yesterday. 2. We discussed a number of subjects on which I will report separately but as regards policy general sense of the Prime Minister's remarks was that he will concentrate on (a) Restoring domestic order especially in regard to the distribution of essential foodstuffs. (b) Passing the budget for the four outstanding months of the fiscal year and (c) Initiating Seven Year Plan. 3. In spite of the slow start he is now making, the prime Minister did not seem to expect that his programme would encounter serious opposition. Speaking of Qavan he said he would be glad to make way for him if he thought his regime would be beneficial but he was convinced that it would be quite otherv/ise.

The press to-day publishes text of a statement broadcast by Radio Tehran on the instructions of the Persian General Staff, designed to counter Soviet propaganda. 2. Statement contains the following points:- 1. Contrary to the allegations made by Moscow and Baku wireless stations that thousands of tons of armaments and munitions have already been sent from America to Persia in reality none of the equipment that has been purchased has yet arrived. 2. The purchases are perfectly normal ones, such as any country must make which has not sufficient factories to supply ordinary requirements of its array. 3. The only purpose of the Persian Army is.to ensure internal security and to safeguard the frontiers. Persia has ordered only light weapons and has never wished to purchase heavy arms for aggression. 4. The Persian Government first asked the Soviet Union and Great Britain for conditions of sale. These proved unacceptable and Persia therefore turned to the United States which already provides more than 27 countries with armaments. 3. The United States are delivering arms under normal commercial conditions and there is nothing secret about the purchases. The contract was signed on October 1^1“ and the first deliveries will take place on January 15th. 6 . These purchases concern no one but the Persian Govern ment who on their side, have never made any comment on the enormous Soviet armaments and the arms factories, distributed throughout the vast territory of the Soviet Union. 7 % The truth of certain statements made by Moscow ydreless that foreigners are intervening in the internal affairs /of Persia isTehran telegram No, 979 to Foreign Office, of Persia is denied..

The Government this morning was accorded a vote of confidence by a narrow majority having received 56 votes to 2 with 37 abstentions ( and at least 30 absentees). In the last few days its position has slightly improved, largely due to a statement issued by the Court making it clear that stories to the effect that Saed did not enjoy the Shah’s full support were unfounded. 2. A resolution was yesterday tabled in the Majlis proposing new regulations limiting the time during which individual deputies might speak and imposing sanctions on continued absenteeism. After a frenzied debate the House agreed that the resolution should be considered under procedure of strict urgency but did not vote on the resolution itself and the meeting was cut short under the quorum rule by withdrawal of deputies. 3.

PERSIA Shortly before the resignation of the Hajir Government, the Persian Prime Minister consulted us and the U. S. State Department on the question of Soviet-Persian relations. We then learned that, contrary to previous indications (my telegram 17 th April Q.No.40 Saving, last paragraph), the Persian Government had not communicated to the Security Council copies of the notes exchanged between the Soviet Union and the Persian Government but were considering whether they should present to the Security Counc a note which they had prepared previously, appealing to the Security Council for consideration of Article VI of the Soviet- Persian Treaty of 1921. (This Article gives the Soviet Union the right 10 move troops into Persia should the Persian Government be unable or unwilling to prevent Persian territory being used as a base by a ohird power hostile to the Soviet Union). 2- The Persian Government's appeal would be based on the .tibilioy of Article VI with existing conditions, i.e. the demonstrable -p .p of f01 ’ ces m Persia which might threaten the -ovie,. Union and the existence now of a. Security Council specifically empowered to deal with such a threat should it ever the Council Preferred not to recommend revision of the Article, the Persian Government would ask for it to be declared null snd void. /3. AtT'wr - 2 - A * L ^ e Some time, the U. S. State Department asked for our views on their suggestion that the Persian Government might be ^ advised to communicate to the Security Council, for its information only, an account of the recent Soviet-Persian exchanges and differences, in the course of which it might be pointed out that the 1921 Treaty was incompatible with existing conditions and that, in the circumstances, the Soviet Union ought not to have the right unilaterally to move troops into Persia. The State Department also suggested that, if the Persian Government were to take this action, a statement might be issued the same time by the United States Government refuting Soviet allegations about u. S. intrigues in Persia and supporting the Persian position. 4. We subsequently reached agreement with the State Department that the Persian Government should not be advised to raise in the Security Council the question of the revision of Article VI of the 1921 Treaty, as such an appeal might well provoke sharp Soviet reaction and might result at the lease in greatly intensified Soviet pressure on Persia (especially as the United States Military Mission Agreement with the Persian Government is about to be ron ev/ed) • 5. As regards the question of the Persian Government oommunicatin to tnc security Council copies of the recent exchange of notes with the Soviet Government, we were inclined to think that, if the ' Persian Government themselves did not wish to communicate the correspondence, it would be better not to raise this subject at the present time in the Security Council in Paris, unless the state of relations between Persia and the Soviet Union grew markedly worse in the neor (future. 6 * W ° 0180 “ cle *r that, in our view, the question of /a supportingsupporting stntcment wns primarily cine for the United States Government. if however the fereinn Government deoided to communicate the correspondence to the Security Council and if the U. 3.

Le Rougetel to Mr. Bevin. (Received 21st September) (No. 305) Tehran, Sir, 15^ September, 1948. With reference to paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 275 of 13th August, I have the honour to inform you that the debate on the budget, which opened on 26th August, still continues in the Majlis. In the effort to produce a Bill simple enough to receive the approval of the Majlis with out undue delay, the Government have laid themselves open to the charge of failing to provide the Deputies with adequate in formation and have now to face the long and largely irrelevant debate which their proposals w^ere designed to avoid. The Government has been opposed by M. Haerizadeh, Deputy for Sabzavar, and M. Taqizadeh, Deputy for Tabriz and for mer Persian Ambassador in London. The latter, in a well-reasoned speech, effectively exposed the faults of the present Budget Bill, but it seems unlikely that his criticisms will do more than prolong the debate. The Government’s supporters have, in general, admitted the imperfec tions of the Bill, but have urged that an indifferent budget is better than none at all. A large number of Deputies have an nounced their intention to speak on this subject, and as the debate has already been interrupted by the discussion of a Bill to organise the pilgrim traffic to Mecca, it is almost certain that another provisional twelfth will have to be voted before the whole budget becomes law. After the bud get debate is over, the Prime Minister will answer M. Azad’s interpellation of the Government on their suppression of cer tain newspapers and alleged breaches of the Constitution. 2. On 26th August the debate was opened by M. Mokaram (Daragaz), who spoke in favour of the Bill and said that the prac tice of financing the country by a series of provisional twelfths was retarding economic progress. He criticised certain items of the Bill and, when the debate was continued on 31st August, he concluded with an expose of the needs of his native province, Khorassan, where public health and education had been neglected, and where the decree prohibithug thg^cultiva- tion of the opium poppy had olllfccht 120-24 ‘ + L)ECi94&gt; hardship. To counter this, he suggested that the sugar-beet industry should be increased. 3. M. Haerizadeh (Sabzavar) made a long, rambling and bitter speech, in which he attacked the Government both col lectively and individually, and repeated again and again that the Shah was sur rounded by corrupt flatterers who were encouraging him to rule rather than to reign, and that the army was too large, too expensive and too fond of interfering in politics. He deplored that the provincial and departmental councils had, in practice, ceased to exist, and advocated suffrage for women as well as men. The Soviet Govern ment had abandoned all her concessions in 1921, and His Majesty’s Government should now annul the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession. To be called “ the bridge of victory ” was poor compensation to Persia for all she had done for the Allies in the war, and in this connexion he attacked the Government for their weak ness over the railway claim. The Foreign Minister was accused of passivity over Bahrein and the Shatt-el-Arab, and the speaker concluded with an attack on the Prime Minister, whom he held personally responsible for the difficulties and internal dissensions of the two previous Cabinets. He blamed M. Hajir for having organised the Shah’s reception in such a way as to estrange the sovereign and his people, and for having failed to invite representatives of the press to his reception in honour of the Shah’s return. 4. This speech, which had continued into the session of 2nd September, was fre quently interrupted, and when M. Haeri zadeh was unable any longer to make him self heard the President was obliged to suspend the session for a few minutes. On its resumption, M. Sadeghi (Tehran) reminded the Majlis that no budget had been approved in Persia for the last five years. The present Bill was not perfect, but it was the duty of the Majlis to approve it. He was followed by Engineer Khosro Hedayat (Tehran) who answered M. Haerizadeh’s attack on the army and paid a tribute to the work of the Imperial Organisation for Social Service.2 5. rOn 5th September, M. Taqizadeh (Tabriz) condemned both the substance of the Budget Bill and the form in which it had been presented to the Majlis. The Deputies, he said, were being asked to approve a number of round figures without any explanation of how they had been arrived at. He asked for details of the £2 million sterling from the railway settlement which was said to be for the purchase of cartridges. He did not believe that any sound principle underlay the proposals, but that they had been devised solely to benefit the greedy ruling class. In spite of the poverty of the people, the Administration for the last twenty-five years had spent the national budget almost entirely on themselves. Huge buildings, like those of Chicago and Paris, had been built in Tehran and were still being built, and probably dance-halls were next on the list. The Civil Service had been allowed to swell to unmanageable proportions, with the result that Government employees en gaged in politics, edited newspapers and publicly disputed with each other, yet the new budget allowed for the engagement of still more Government employees. 6. M. Taqizadeh criticised the 8 million tomans allotted to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which represented one-hundredth of the whole budget, and he objected to the wastage of foreign exchange. Missions abroad were too large. He asked what use were the legations in such places as Brazil. Poland and Yugoslavia, and said that he would prefer to see the money that they cost used to build hospitals in Luristan or Kerman, or to provide a water system for Bandar Abbas. Instead of appointing political, commercial, cultural and finan cial attaches in large numbers to countries in Europe and South America, the Govern ment should follow the example of the Danish Government, who had recently abolished the posts of military attache in certain of her missions abroad. Yet Den mark, compared with Persia, was a rich country. 7. In conclusion, the speaker briefly out lined the points which he considered should be covered by the budget* if it were to bene fit the people as a whole. These were agriculture and irrigation, industry, com munications, the control of profits, public health and education (including compul sory education in hygiene), housing and what perhaps can be best described as moral rearmament. He praised the Shah for the sincere interest which His Majesty showed in serious reform, briefly lamented the delays in the judicial system and the unhappy plight of many prisoners and, in conclusion, in marked contrast to M. Haerizadeh, said that he had nothing personally against the members of the present Government but had spoken out of a sense of duty to the nation. 8. On 7th September, after the inter pellation of M. Azad had been read, Dr. Shafagh (Tehran) spoke in favour r&gt;^he Bill. He realised the necessity for economies, particularly in the Civil Service, but they must be effected slowly. A detailed plan was needed to restore the in dustrial position of the country, which had declined since 1941, and he hoped that the Bill for the Seven-Year Plan would be approved as soon as possible. He did not doubt the good faith of His Majesty’s Government over the A.I.O.C. concession, and welcomed the talks which were in pro gress between representatives of the Per sian Government and of the A.I.O.C. A nation which had given India her freedom was not likely to have sinister designs on Persia. He asked the Majlis to approve the budget proposals. 9. At the conclusion of Dr. Shafagh’s speech the President ruled that debate on the Bill in general was closed, and that it would now be debated article by article. Engineer Razavi (Kerman) said that the country’s finances had been in disorder since the time of Dr. Millspaugh, criticised the gendarmerie and the postal service, and asked why the revenues from A.I.O.C. royalties were not shown in the budget. M. Batmanghelich (Ardebill) offered to put 400 tractors at the disposal of the Ministry of Agriculture. 10. Most of the sessions of 9th and 11th September were taken up with the discus sion of a Bill to organise pilgrimages to Mecca, which was accorded a vote of double urgency. However, it was eventually dropped without a vote being taken, and the debate on the budget was resumed. Dr. Taba’ (Nain) said that the budget must first be approved, in spite of its failings, because without it the Government were prevented from carrying out further re forms. He praised the work of the for mer Minister of Finance, M. Najm, and emphasised the need for a thorough purge of the Civil Service. He went on to speak at some length on the inadequacy of the medical services in Persia, outlined a scheme for State scholarships for sending medical students to study abroad. Above all, more doctors were needed in the provinces. The debate continues. 11.

The ohah received me today. he seems to be coming round to the view that the Government should concentrate on passing the budget and seven .years plan before tackling the constitution. But he is as convinced as ever that there can be no real progress here with the existing political machinery. 2 . ,,fter some discussion he agreed that it might be better to take the Senate bill before raising the issue of constutional reform. ae also agreed that no government which is not exceptionally competent and well led will have any chancs of executing such a programme. It is already becoming clear that unless Sa'ed developer unexpected strength he will not be up to this task and that in any case he may soon be forced to resign. The question of his successor may therefore become urgent at any time. The Snah is thinking seriously of xJi j...;an[igu]r but is not entirely convinced that he will stand up to Soviet pressure or throw his heart into the task of social reform. Yvhen asked for my views I said that I had a high opinion of _.an...r’s ability and believed that most of the’criticism I had heard of his integrity were circulated by his personal enemies. Having heard that War. Taqizadeh Is now m favour of the Senate bill I asked whether His Najesty could not persuade him to go one step further and assist actively in'the work of constitutional reform. The Shah this morning doubted whether Hr. Taqizadeh would go as far as tnis but said that he would think the matter over. 5. The Shah mentioned the fact that ^uvam and Seyyid Zia have now joined forces, and made it very clear that he will not allow them to obtain office either together or separately. He quoted several instances to show why he would never trust puvaffl. In this sense he saw no reason why he should reward Seyyid lia for the campaign of calumny which he is now conducting against the royal family in the press. I aid not contest I.is Najesty’s views about Quvam and Seyyid because in my opinion if either of them were to come into power at the present time it would make a bad situation Distinctly worse.

Hazhir’s Government has been accorded a vote of confidence, but the dead lock in the Majlis continues, and no pro gress whatever has been made with the Government’s programme of legislation; a further provisional twelfth of the budget has been approved. There has been a severe earthquake in Northern Khorasan. Foreign Affairs 2. During the month Soviet troops on three occasions crossed the frontier into Persian territory. The first of these inci dents took place to the east of the Caspian, where the frontier is formed by the Atrek River. Soviet troops w T ere found to be occupying a dry watercourse, formerly the bed of the river and now on the Persian side of the frontier. The other two inci dents were on the Azerbaijan frontier, in the area north of Ardebil between Astara and the Araxes River. Fire was exchanged on all three occasions, and one Persian soldier was killed. These incidents were given some prominence in the press at the end of the month, but according to infor mation given by the Chief of the General Staff to the military attache, they all took place at points where the exact line of the frontier is not clear. General Razmara also said that such incidents were common enough, and had happened even during the reign of Reza Shah. 3. Although the Soviet Ambassador, M. Sadtchikov, was still on leave at the end of the month, he is expected to return during the first week in November. The Soviet Consul-General at Tabriz has returned and it is reported that the Persian Government have agreed to the appointment of a Soviet Vice-Consul at Bandar Shahpur to reside at Ahwaz. 4. M. Jan Magru has| arrived| ^tJehran to take up the post of Rumaman“MimsCer here. He has not yet presented his cre dentials. Internal Affairs 5. On 12th October the Prime Minister asked the Majlis for a vote of confidence, which was accorded to him by 64 votes to 8, with 16 abstentions. This was an unex pected move. M. Azad’s interpellation, which would have provided the occasion for a vote on Government policy, was already on the agenda for the day, but it seems that the Prime Minister wanted to be sure of his position before he announced the stage reached in the conversations which were then still in progress with representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In fact, the vote does not seem to have strengthened his hand. The Majlis is as intractable as ever, and the Cabinet is still not complete. On 6th October M. Varasteh resigned his post as Minister of Finance, having held office for less than a fortnight. 6. The decision of the Judicial Commis sion, acquitting Ghavam os Saltaneh. has not yet received the approval of the Majlis. When the debate on this subject started on 5th October, Ghavam’s opponents showed their determination to delay the proceed ings, and the argument was advanced that the decision of the Judicial Commission was no longer valid as the commission itself was automatically dissolved on 6th October, its members having completed their six months’ tenure of office. It is widely be lieved that the influence of Ghavam has much to do with the present situation, m which Hazhir’s Government is kept in office, but prevented from exercising power. 7. A short communique was issued by the Government on 19th October to say that the conversations with representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had come to an end, and that Mr. Gass had left Tehran for London to discuss the Persian Government’s proposals with the board of 120-302 directors of the company, after which the conversations would be resumed. There was some indignation in the press that no more tangible result had been obtained, and the Prime Minister was attacked for once again sacrificing the rights of the Persian people in order to please the British. 8. At the beginning of the month the Prime Minister held informal discussions with the Deputies in an effort to get the budget approved, but his various proposals were rejected and although he has continu ally emphasised in the Majlis the need for the approval of the budget as a whole, no progress has been made. On 31st October a provisional twelfth for the month of Mehr was approved and in a clumsy attempt to secure tacit approval of the railway settle ment, the Government inserted a clause authorising the expenditure on ammunition of £2 million sterling from the sum to be paid under the settlement. A heated and inconclusive debate on this clause ensued. 9. Although the seven-year plan has not yet been approved by the Majlis, a pro visional organisation for carrying out pre- liminary work has been set up, with powers to engage foreign experts for a period not exceeding six months. An advance party of five from an American group of con sultants is due to reach . Tehran in mid- November for a short visit, and arrange- nieiits are being made for British experts to co-operate with them. The Statistical De partment of the Ministry of Finance has been put under the control of the new organisation. 10. At a meeting of the Central Com mittee of the Tudeh Party the Secretary- General, Dr. Radmanesh, presented a report in which he reviewed both national and international affairs. He attacked the Government and criticised the Shah’s recent journey to Europe. Apart from this orthodox pronouncement there has been little Tudeh activity. 11. The six-monthly election of officers of the Majlis took place on 6th October. M. Sardar Fakher Kekmat was re-elected President by fifty-three votes to M. Taqizadeh’s forty-six. New parlia mentary commissions were elected on 31st October. The Provinces 12. There was a very severe earthquake in Northern Khorasan on the evening of 6th October. Shocks continued for several days. Early reports of severe damage in Meshed proved unfounded, but the district of Daraghaz, near the Soviet frontier, was almost completely devastated, several hu.. dred people being killed and wounded and many thousand rendered homeless. Re ports from Moscow indicate that this earth quake was felt even more severely at Ashqabad, in Soviet Turkmanistan. 13. In Azerbaijan the new Governor- General, Khalil Fahimi, took up his duties on 8th October. Most of the political prisoners pardoned under the general amnesty have now returned, and a number of army officers, including two generals, who were imprisoned in connexion with the Azerbaijan Democrat Movement, were released on the Shah’s birthday. 14. In spite of the fact that the Govern ment have now rescinded most of the regu lations forbidding the free movement of grain from one province to another, the biead situation remains unsatisfactorv. Since it became known that stocks in the Tehran silo were dangerously low, land lords have hoarded their grain and the Government seem unable to prevent their doing so. There was a threat of a critical wheat shortage in Khuzistan owing to the complete failure of the harvest there. The Governor-General appealed to the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, who were unable to help him out, but he managed to get some supplies from other provinces to tide the province over until the arrival of wheat which the Government are arranging to purchase in Australia and the United States. A very cold spell in the middle of the month ruined much of the fruit crop at Hamadan and Kermanshah. 15.

Le Rougetel (Tehran) \Vih (No. 250) Foreign Office, Sir, 3rd November, 1948 As 'the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was on a short private visit to this country I took the opportunity of renewing our acquaintance by seeing him this after noon. After an exchange of compliments he asked me if the international situation was any clearer since our last conversation on 1st October and whether I thought speedier progress could be made in settling the outstanding international problems now that the United States elections were over. I told him I did not expect that the result of the United States elections would greatly affect American foreign policy, but I hoped that we would now be able to settle more quickly certain outstanding problems of economic co-operation and defence. 2. The -Persian Foreign Minister then asked me about Burma and whether India would declare herself a republic and leave the Commonwealth. In reply I said that the situation in Burma showed some im provement and now that the Government of Burma had established better relations with India and the Karens we could hope for still further improvement. As regards India, I could not forecast at this stage what the Indian Government might decide to do. 3. The Persian Foreign Minister went on to say that his Government’s policy was a national one and not, as had sometimes been the case in the past, a policy dictated by the interests of small groups of individuals 120-14 looking either to Russia or to Great Britain. The Persian Government wished to maintain the most friendly relations and to co-operate to the full with any nation such as Great Britain which showed itself to be Persia’s friend and mindful of Persian interests. He was glad to say that, whatever may have been the differences in the past between Persia and Great Britain, none existed now. I thanked him for this expression of his Government’s friendship which I said I reciprocated. I went on to say that I hoped the Persians would be on their guard against Russian attempts to drive a wedge between us. If at any time the Persian Government had a problem let them come and talk it over with us and I was sure that together we could find the solution. 4. Before leaving, the Persian Foreign Minister thanked me for giving him this further opportunity to discuss Persian affairs and said he hoped one day to be free of the cares of office and to pay a more lengthy visit to Great Britain and to learn our language. I replied suitably. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Wash ington, Moscow, Cairo, Bagdad, Jedda, Beirut, Damascus, Amman, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the B.M.E.O. and the United Kingdom Delegation to the U.N.G.A., Paris.

Le Rougetel (Tehran) (No. 246) Foreign Office, Sir, 29M October, 1948. At his request I received the Governor of the National Bank of Persia, Mr. Abul Hassan Ibtihaj, on 29th October, Mr. Ibtihaj expressed with evident sincerity his determination to do everything which was in his power to make the Persian Seven-Year Plan a success. He informed me that while in Washington he had had discussions with the International Bank and, as a result, was hopeful that in due course the bank would be prepared to make a loan for suitable projects. He described the preliminary work on the Seven-Year Plan which the Persian Government have done in drawing up data and preliminary plans, and referred to their engagement of the American firm of Overseas Consul tants to advise them on the next stages. He hoped that British firms, especially Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, who had done good work in Persia, would be asso ciated with Overseas Consultants. He attached great importance to supervision of the plan by American and British experts since only with foreign supervision could the Persians feel assured that the money voted for the plan would be used for the purposes for which it was intended and not go into private pockets. 2. He then proceeded to describe the Majlis as the principal obstacle in the way of the successful carrying out of the plan. In his opinion it was an utterly irrespon sible and obstructive body; once it was elected its members were completely secure from removal for its two years’ term and, since there was no second chamber to revise legislation passed by the Majlis and the Executive had no power of veto, the Majlis could pass the wildest legislation and the Government could not prevent them. He therefore thought that constitu tional changes, including the grant to the Shah of the right of dissolution, were necessary. He appreciated that anything 120-7 that was to be done would have to be done carefully since there was always the danger of a relapse into military dictatorship and he certainly did not wish to see his country handed over to the ignorant rule of the Ministry of War. 3. I said that I always used ail the means at my command to urge the importance of reform and development on the Persian Government as the only sure defence against communism. All the help that was within our power we would gladly provide. What seemed to me absolutely essential was that the Persian Government should pro cure the passage of the Seven-Year Plan Bill as soon as they could. At this stage it was better not to take up the time of the Deputies with talk of constitutional reform; the Government should concen trate on passing the budget and the Seven- Year Plan Bill and after that see if it needed to make changes in the Constitution and, if so, what they ought to be. I said that it was not for me to advise the Persian Government on the details of their constitu tional arrangements; to do so would smack of intervention. I was always very scrupu lous not to intervene in Persia’s internal affairs. To this Mr. Ibtihaj replied that he also, as a Persian patriot, certainly did not want foreign intervention. What he wanted was an assurance of my sympathy in the efforts which the Persians were making to improve the condition of their country and a spirit of understanding should they find it necessary to make changes in the Constitution. I concluded the interview by repeating that what was wanted before anything else was the passage of the Seven-Year Plan Bill. 4.

We said that, we v/ould'-ask yo.u fpr your opinion but meanwhile, in view of yo-ur telegram under reference, it v/as necessary to come to an agreement with the United • States authorities about correcting the-Persian prime Minister's understanding that Mr. Wiley had advocated communication to the Security Council of the Persian note on Article 6 of the 1921 Treaty* State : Department again said that the final decision would be taken in Paris and suggested that the United Kingdom Delegation should discuss the point with Mr. Bohlen* This could best be done when Mr. Wiley had reported, as he doubtless would within the next day or two, what exactly he' had told the Persians. The State.

Le Rougetel to Mr. Bevin. {Received Wth October)^ Q i * n (No. 331) Sir, Tehran, 5th October, 1948. With reference to my despatch No. 294 of 6th September I have the honour to sub mit the following report on events in Persia during the month of September. There have been no developments in Persian relations with the Soviet Union; the pilgrim traffic to Mecca has been resumed after a lapse of several years. M. Hazhir has re-formed his Cabinet, but the budget has not yet been approved and the prestige of the Government is declining. A decree forbidding civil servants to direct news papers or take part in journalism has created considerable excitement. A Par liamentary Judicial Commission has ac quitted the former Prime Minister, Qhavam -us-Saltaneh, of the charges brought against him. Foreign Affairs 2. The Soviet Ambassador is still on leave, and there has been remarkably little Soviet activity either in Tehran or the pro vinces, where the Soviet consulates are for the most part thinly staffed. The policy of closing down the V.O.K.S. cultural centres continues, and women and children of Soviet nationality have left Khorassan and the Caspian provinces. Reports have been received of the evacuation of civilians from certain villages in the neighbourhood of Soviet Astara. 3. At the end of the month a number of pilgrims, variously estimated at between 8,000 and 15,000, left Tehran for Mecca by road and air. Although the discussion of a Bill to provide for a special organisation for their protection has been postponed by the Majlis, the Red Lion and Sun Society have arranged for ambulances to accom pany the pilgrims. A former Prime Minister, M. Sadr ul Ashraf, has been appointed by the Shah chairman of a com mittee to supervise the pilgrims’ welfare, and it is reported that the counsellor of the Persian Embassy in Cairo, who has gone to Jedda, will shortly be appointed Minis ter there. The Shah has presented a sword and a Koran to King Ibn Saud, and the religious leader, Ayatollah Behbehani, has been invited to be the guest of the Saudi Arabian Government while he is in Mecca. 4. The Persian delegation to the third session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is at present sitting in Paris, was headed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and included M. Adi, Minister without portfolio. On 25th Sep tember M. Isfandiari spoke in general terms, reminding the Assembly of the fate of the League of Nations, and assuring them of Persia’s adherence to the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Organisation. Internal Affairs 5. During the month the Majlis has been almost solely occupied with the debate on the budget, which has still not been approved in spite of the Prime Minister’s efforts to obtain the co-operation of the Deputies. The Budget Bill has been condemned by M. Taqizadeh and others, and many Depu ties, speaking ostensibly on the side of the Government, have not only criticised details of the budget, but have taken the opportunity to review at great length the whole position of the country. The right to speak and to conduct business after their own leisurely fashion is jealously guarded by the Deputies. Although they have agreed to hold a session every week-day while the budget is still being debated, at none of the special sessions has there so far been a quorum. With seventy amendments to it already tabled, the budget does not seem likely to become law in the near future. Another provisional twelfth was approved on 26th September. Meanwhile, internal reforms are hanging fire, and the Labour Bill and the Seven-Year Plan Bill are waiting their turn on the Majlis agenda. Work on the former by a parlia mentary committee has, however, been continuing.9 6. Discussions between the Persian Government and repi’esentatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have con tinued during the month. On 19th Sep tember the Prime Minister told the Deputies that the discussions had reached a point at which he would welcome their advice, and asked them to form a committee to assist him. This they refused to do, saying that it was the duty of the Govern ment to continue the discussions with the help of their expert advisers, and to submit a report to the Majlis in due course. The Government have now made their detailed proposals which are being considered by the representatives of the A.I.O.C. 7. Early in the month a decree of the Council of Ministers was published which forbade Government employees, on pain of dismissal, to engage in business and to own or edit newspapers. This decree, although apparently reasonable, in fact strikes at the roots of the Tehran press. Since the abdication of Reza Shah in 1941 a very large number of daily newspapers, many of them little more than political pamphlets with a small circulation, have appeared in Tehran. There is no tradition in this country of an impartial civil service, and Government employees, who are more often than not aspiring politicians, play a con siderable part in journalism. The Prime Minister has been petitioned to repeal the decree, which has been condemned by all sections of the press as an attack on their liberty. It was also the subject of an inter pellation of the Government made by M. Azad on 5th September. The Prime Minister expressed his readiness to reply to this at once, but it was subsequently decided that he should do so after the budget debate. 8. On 23rd September the Prime Minister announced a reshuffle of the Cabinet and introduced three new Minis ters—M. Golshayan, Minister of Justice; M. Yarasteh, Minister of Finance; and M. Ashrafi, Minister of National Economy. The Prime Minister himself became Minis ter of the Interior, and Dr. Shadman, formerly Minister of National Economy, became Minister of Agriculture. The for mer Ministers of Justice and Agriculture, MM. Mali and Bushehri, had announced their resignation some days before, and M Fahimi, formerly Minister of the Interior, was appointed Governor-General of Azer baijan. These changes do not appear to be of much significance, though it is pos sible that the Prime Minister hopes,' by unburdening himself of the portfolio of Finance, to speed up the budget debate. The Minister of Finance has to be present while amendments to the budget are being debated. 9. Changes have also taken place in the Prime Minister’s office. The resignation has been announced of the two Under secretaries, MM. Moadel and Tafazoli, and the functions of the Director of ganda, M. Faripur, have been taken over by the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Shad- man. Although M. Abbas Hishmati, at present Governor-General of Mazandaran, has been widely reported as about to become Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, no official announcement has yet been made. 10. Between 200 and 300 tribal leaders from all parts of Persia attended, in the latter part of the month, a course at the Senior Officers’ School, at the same time as provincial divisional commanders were called to Tehran. A conference of di visional commanders is held annually, and although last year certain tribal leaders from Azerbaijan attended it, this is the first time that a large number of tribesmen have been invited. Visits to the Majlis and to military installations were arranged in Tehran, and at the end of the course the tribesmen were received by the Shah and swore allegiance to him and to the country. The press and public opinion have been sharply divided on the subject of this tribal influx, which has excited considerable com ment and gave rise to a spirited debate in the Maj lis on 23rd September between those who believed that nothing but trouble has ever come from the tribes and those who were disposed to commend General Razmara for his initiative in encouraging them to think of themselves as a vital part of Persia’s armed forces. 11. It was announced on 28th September that the Parliamentary Judicial Commis sion which has been considering the report of the special committee on the indictment of Qhavam-us-Saltaneh had pronounced in his favour. The Majlis has now to approve the decision of the Judicial Committee, and it is generally believed that they will do so. The strong probability that his final acquittal will result in Qhavam again be coming Prime Minister is the principal topic of conversation in political circles. The Provinces 12. Several hundred political prisoners and others wdio were deported to the south have already returned to Azerbaijan under the terms of the amnesty. Although there have been no disorders in the province there is fairly high feeling against the return of so many politically unreliable people, and M. Taqizadeh has been criticised for advo cating that the amnesty should be widelyapplied. He and other Deputies from Azerbaijan have received protests from their constituents against the return not only of many muhajjirs who were of Russian origin and had no roots in Azer- J ^a Han, but also of young men of no par- R^par trade who would swell the ranks of the unemployed. 13. At the end of the month the Shah paid a visit to Isfahan and inaugurated the work on the Kuhrang tunnel. The road to the site, about 200 kilom. from Isfahan, has now been completed and work on the tunnel itself has been started. The con tract for this has been awarded to the Norwegian firm of Nortrac, and machinery is expected shortly. It is estimated that the tunnel will take about two years to complete. His Majesty also inspected the weaving factories at Isfahan, opened a new bridge and returned to Tehran by way of Kashan and Ghom. 14. The harvest has been good in the north and west, though prices are high in Azerbaijan and a good deal of grain has been hidden for eventual sale on the black market. In Khuzistan, however, it has not been good, and in their efforts to prevent smuggling by prohibiting the free move ment of grain between provinces, the Government have probably caused some hardship in the south. In Ahwaz the Governor-General’s grain company is in difficulties and smuggling on a reduced scale continues. 15. In Ears the migration of the tribes to winter pastures has started, and there has consequently been a slight decline in public security. In general the tribal areas are quiet. 16. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Wash ington, Moscow and Bagdad, and to the British Middle East Office, Cairo; to Air Headquarters, Iraq, through His Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad; to the United Kingdom High Commissioners at Karachi and New Delhi; and to all His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia. I have, &amp;c. J. H. LE ROUGETEL.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT CONFIDENTIAL ^ 11971/2232/34 . Sir J. Le Rougetel to Mr. Bevin. (No. 294) Sir, Tehran, §th September, 1948. With reference to Tehran despatch No. 261 of 3rd August, I have the honour to submit the following report on events in Persia during the month of August 1948. There were no further developments of note in relations between Persia and the Soviet Union; the Shah concluded his successful tour of Europe with visits to France, Switzerland and Italy, and re turned to Tehran on 27th August; and the Majlis, after a recess of fifteen days during Ramazan, had some lively sessions and passed a further vote of confidence to the Government. There was little sign, how ever, that M. Najir was meeting with success in his campaign for lowering the cost of living, and in the second half of the month shortage of grain gave rise to dis content in the provinces. Foreign Affairs 2. The Soviet Ambassador left Tehran for the U.S.S.R. on leave on 11th August. Before his departure, M. Sadtchikov had a further conversation with the Prime Minister on similar lines to that of 1st July. He still insisted that some gesture must be made by the Persian Government to atone for the cancellation of the Oil Agreement, but was less precise than before on what form the gesture should take. It also seems possible that a new commercial understanding acceptable to both sides may be concluded, and negotiations are continu ing. Immediately after the Soviet Ambas sador’s departure, however, a deputation of the Tudeh Party waited on M. Hajir and presented him with a list of political measures which they considered essential for the restoration of internal and external stability. These demands were much as would have been expected had they been dictated, as M. Hajir believes they were, by the Soviet Embassy. * They included the total suspension of martial law. with drawal of American military advisers, can cellation of the agreement of 3rd October, 118-29 PERSIA September 15, 1948 Section 1 r 'fil Vo -. 4 (j !; 1 7 4 4! * ■ i u, 1 !948 (Received \5th September^ 1947, withdrawal of the Bill for the formation of a Senate, and abstention from borrowing from abroad, as well as the general protests against interference with the freedom of press and speech, and lack of measures to assist the labouring classes. It now appears certain that there is being a general withdrawal of all Soviet per sonnel not considered essential, and besides the withdrawals mentioned in paragraph 2 of my despatch under reference, all Soviet children are being returned to the U.S.S.R. for schooling. There has, however, been a lull in the frontier incidents. 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an official note, again raised the question of the status of Bahrein. He was informed in reply, on instructions from you, Sir, that the Persian Government were well aware that His Majesty’s Government do not recognise any Persian claim to Bahrein, an Arab sheikhdom in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, who are responsible for its foreign relations. In a reply dated 26th August the Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated the Persian claims and stated that any agreements concluded with the Sheikh of Bahrein were regarded by Persia as invalid. Neverthe less, when on the interpellation by M. Abbas Eskandari the Majlis discussed Bahrein at length, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his reply made no mention of any recent protest to this embassy, and was not, therefore, faced with the necessity for admitting that this protest had been rejected. 4. The dispute over the water of the Helmand appears to have quietened down for the moment. The Foreign Affairs Com mission of the Majlis debated the subject and approved the continuance of bilateral negotiations with the Afghan Government. Military forces on both sides of the fron tier in the Seistan area have, however, been strengthened and difficulties have been experienced in the implementation of an Agreement between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Afghan Government for PERSIAN AFFAIRS Monthly Report for August 1948the delivery of petroleum products to Afghanistan, possibly as a Persian reprisal or in preparation of a bargaining counter to use in connexion with the Helmand water question. 5. The United States Senate has now finally approved the credits to Persia for the purchase of arms and their transport to a Persian port, but no arms have yet begun to arrive. 6. Towards the end of the month the Yugoslav Minister issued a statement say ing that he could not submit to the “ terror ” now reigning in Yugoslavia, and left Tehran for the Soviet Union with several of his staff. M. Mirosevic, whose appointment as first secretary was notified shortly before the Minister’s departure, has assumed charge of the legation and issued a statement saying that the Minister's attitude is not shared by the whole legation staff and is not approved of by the Yugo slav people. The Shah’s Visit to Europe 7. The Shah left the United Kingdom at the beginning of the month and con tinued his tour through France, Switzer land and Italy. No particular political significance seems to attach to these visits, though the Persian press featured His Majesty’s statement in Berne that he fully understood the profound necessity for Swiss neutrality. The tour, which ended with the Shah’s return to Tehran on 27th August, was prolonged ten days over the period originally planned, and the Persian press reporting declined noticeably in space and enthusiasm towards the end. In spite of His Majesty’s request that the formali ties attending his return should be reduced to a minimum, many triumphal arches were erected and Ministers, Deputies and heads of foreign missions attended at the aero drome to greet His Majesty on his return, which was marked by a display of con siderable popular enthusiasm. Internal Affairs 8. The Majlis reassembled on 8th August after a recess of a fortnight. Though its activities were reduced at first by the numerous public holidays marking the end of Ramazan, there was a lively debate in the second half of the month on the proposed amnesty for political prisoners from Azerbaijan and Zenjan. The draft decree had caused alarm to officials and the military authorities in the northern provinces, and the Prime Minister, to avoid awkward amendments, hurriedly withdrew it and substituted another. This was duly passed in the face of violent opposition from Left-wing Deputies, who created a disorderly scene in the Chamber. In anticipation of this measure a number of people previously deputed to the south have already begun to return to Azerbaijan, while others who had remained in Azerbaijan in hiding have nq^ begun to show themselves again. On Wxy August the Majlis began to debate the interpellations tabled by MM. Abbas Eskandari and Ardalan on the subject of Bahrein, the A.I.O.C. concession, the state of prisons and the new foreign exchange regulations. This debate ended in a vote of confidence for the Prime Minister by 93 votes out of 101, the division being taken without particular reference to the subjects of the interpellation. Opposition to M. Hajir in the press has increased during the month, and he temporarily suppressed four newspapers which, however, at once reappeared under new names. 9. Negotiations have been opened be tween the Ministry of Finance and the A.I.O.C. on the “ Iranianisation ” article of the concession. There has been consider able clamour in the Majlis and press in favour of a revision of the concession, and the Chamber has authorised the G-overn- ment to engage three experts—from “ neutral ” countries—to assist the Minis try of Finance in negotiating with the oil company. 10. The Government’s new foreign ex change regulations (paragraph 7 of my despatch under reference) have now been in operation for some weeks. They have resulted in the establishment of different effective rates of exchange for various types of goods, and in the stabilisation of the free market (at present at the rate of 230 rials to the £) by sales of Government exchange. The new regulations do not yet cover all classes of merchandise, and a new decree is already in draft which will deal with industrial and agricultural machinery. The Provinces 11. Except in Azerbaijan and the rice growing Caspian provinces, where pros pects are extremely good, the harvest is likely to be below expectation. Canditions are especially bad in Khuzistan, where there has been a general rise in the prices of food-stuffs. Grain from last year’s harvest is now running low elsewhere and there have been shortages (resulting from bad distribution, smuggling and the with holding of stocks) .at Ardebil, Kazvin, Bujnurd, Semnan and other places. Demonstrations occurred at the first two places and led to the temporary impositionof martial law at Kazvin and to an emer gency decree authorising the Government to control, and where necessary to forbid, the transport of grain from one locality to another. 12. In Isfahan there has been a certain S ;scence in the relations between rs and mill-owners and between rival unions. The employers are appre hensive that Khaivan, the head of the inde pendent union, is causing dissension among their employees; while Sadri, the Isfahan leader of E.S.K.I., has delivered an attack on the employers. Conditions appear favourable for agitation by Tudeh, whose seventeen leaders arrested in April have now been released. They will not be re employed in the mills, but this would not seem to reduce their potential capacity for mischief. The Governor-General has warned the mill-owners to look out for a revival of Tudeh activity. Elsewhere in the country there is little sign of Tudeh progress. 13. The Prime Minister’s promises to restore the prosperity of Azerbaijan have not so far impressed the Azerbaijanis. The cost of living continues to be high, and action so far taken is limited to projects for the improvement of communications. Nevertheless, Soviet propaganda continues to fall on stony ground and the loyalty of the population of Azerbaijan is not open to doubt. 14. Tribal conditions both in the Bakh- tiari and Qashgai areas remain quiet. The Governor of the Bakhtiari is reported to be in Tehran complaining of army inter ference with his tribesmen, and similar interference is reported from the Qashgai, though relations there between the tribes and the authorities remain generally good. From his exile in Tehran Abul Qassem is reported to be inciting the Bakhtiari leaders against the Governor. There has been no revival of trouble with the Javan- rudi Kurds in the Kermanshah district (the special campaign against them was reported in paragraph 10 of my despatch under reference) and it is reported that of the 600 rifles declared by the tribesmen, 300 have been, or will shortly be, handed in. 15. Considerable progress has been made in the improvement of roads and the asphalting of the streets of Shiraz by M. Ardalan, the new Governor-General of Ears who was formerly Minister of Roads. Work on the Shiraz water supply project has begun, and the Government has been conducting enquiries into the possibilities of reviving the trade of the port of Bushire. Contracts have also been signed for asphalting the streets of Isfahan and for the Kuhrang tunnel and irrigation scheme. 16. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Wash ington, Moscow and Bagdad, and to the British Middle East Office, Cairo; to Air Headquarters, Iraq, through His Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad; to the United Kingdom High Commissioners at Karachi and New Delhi; and to all His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia.

J R ft Copy | Sir J. Le Rougetel to Mr. Bevin (Received \5th September) v (No. 298) Tehran, Sir, September, 1948. With reference to Foreign Office tele gram No. 517 of 21st August, 1948, I have the honour to report that His Majesty the Shah returned to Tehran on Friday 27th August. Before his arrival a message of welcome from all ranks of the army was telegraphed to him by the Chief of Staff, and fifteen fighter aircraft of the Persian Air Force escorted him from the frontier to Mehrabad aerodrome. There His Majesty was greeted with a salute of twenty-one guns and was received by the Imperial Family, the Prime Minister, the Diplomatic Corps and a large gathering which re presented all sections of the population of Tehran. In his speech of welcome the Prime Minister said that the Government had, with the support of the Majlis, done their best to contribute to the country’s welfare in spite of the activities of ill- disposed persons. The Shah, in reply, re minded the Prime Minister that he would never have left Persia if he had not believed that his journey was in the interests of the country. He had learned that Persia was known and respected by other nations and was recognised as having a place among the free peoples of the world. It was not enough, though, to be content with that. The two essential points were that Parliament, by passing the necessary laws, should ensure the welfare of the popu lation and that the people themselves should have a sense of patriotic duty. He assured the Government of his satisfaction with the progress made in his absence, and looked forward to discussing at greater length on another occasion the many problems affecting the present situation and condition of Persia. 2. The President of the Majlis welcomed His Majesty in a short speech, the Turkish Ambassador spoke on behalf of the Diplo matic Corps and further speeches were made by two of the Majlis Deputies. M. Ali Mansur spoke on behalf of former Ministers, Dr. Siassi on behalf of the Uni versity, M. Abbas Khahili on behalf of the press and the Mayor of Tehran on behalf of the remainder of those present. His Majesty then drove from the aerodrome to his summer palace at Saadabad, escorted by motor-bicyclists of the police and followed by a long procession of cars. In spite of the Shah’s own request that his return should not be the subject of expen sive demonstrations, over twenty triumphal arches, some of them most elaborate, were built over the route, which was lined by enthusiastic crowds. Animals were sacri ficed, flowers thrown under the car and teams of athletes performed in honour of their sovereign. At Saadabad the Shah received the religious leaders of the country. 3. Public rejoicing continued that even ing and for the next two days. Buildings were everywhere floodlit and decorated with flags, and there was a firework dis play in the main square. On 28th August the Queen Mother gave a reception and on the following evening the Shah was the guest of the Prime Minister at a reception at the Sahabgharanieh Palace. 4. On the morning of 30th August His Majesty received in audience representa tives of the industrial and labouring classes of Tehran and of the Armenian and Jewish communities. They were intro duced by the Mayor, M. Doulatabadi, and requested that the Shah should give orders for the election of a Municipal Council for Tehran and for the formation of a com mittee through which the people could directly approach their sovereign with complaints against the Government. Apparently the Shah made no reply to this request. 5. On Tuesday 31st August, His Majesty received the Majlis deputies in audience at Saadabad. After thanking them for the work they had done in his absence, His Majesty explained in general terms that he was impressed bv the i 118-402 patriotic spirit of the countries which he had visited and also not only by their determination to repair the ravages of war, but by the extent of the reconstruction which had already been achieved. The Shah then went on to deal separately and in turn with each of the four countries he had visited. In England he was struck by the orderliness of the people and the speed with which they got things done. In particular he was impressed by our parliamentary procedure. During the visit of some forty minutes which he paid to the House of Commons, he heard no less than thirty-six questions asked and answered. Government and Opposition were not divided on essential principles but worked together for the common good. He added that public business was transacted when only about 100 Members of Parliament were present out of a possible 600 or so, and he favourably compared this with the state of affairs in the Persian Majlis where the quorum rules so frequently prevented any business being done. In France the Shah was also impressed by the way in which the Deputies worked together for the country’s good, and by the skill with which Parliamentary business was handled in spite of the multitude of political parties. He emphasised that although France had suffered so much during the war, she was now able to play an important part in Europe, and said that he was impressed by the energy with which deficiencies in the armed forces were being made good. The Shah compared Switzerland with Great Britain for the remarkable smoothness and good order with which the life of the country was conducted. In spite of the paucity of her natural resources Switzer land was one of the richest countries for her size in the world and had very highly developed social services and an impressive army, the size of which showed that the Swiss were prepared to defend their liberty. In Italy the energy of the people and the work they had done to repair war time destruction had won the Shah’s admiration, and he was impressed by the way in which the Government’s orders were carried out throughout the country. 6. In conclusion, His Majesty empha sised that Persia must learn to benefit from the experiences of the countries which he had visited and to draw inspiration from the progress which they had made. Persia’s contribution to victory in the war was well-known and appreciated, and all the Governments with whom the Shah had been in contact were anxious for the best possible economic and political relations with her. It was therefore up to this country to increase production and -i^s her holdings of foreign exchange. The Shah did not believe that another war was imminent or that it would become so unless an unforeseen and unaccountable factor arose. 7. In reply to a question, His Majesty said that a foreign loan was no danger to a country confident of her own independ ence. He added that social progress in Persia must be in an orderly fashion and from above. Each country had to find a balance in her internal organisation with out which there would be a constant danger of revolution, and the first conditions necessary for this balance were that the law should be just and that it should be properly enforced. It was the duty of the ruling class to ensure this. If they did not do so they would be the first victims of their own negligence. The world was moving fast and Persia was not isolated from the world but was one of the links in a wide chain of nations. 8. Both the Shah’s return and his speech to the Deputies received, on the whole, favourable notice in the Persian press. Except for those of the extreme Left, the newspapers were united in welcoming His Majesty’s return and many special editions were produced for the occasion, but those opposed to the Government were inclined to criticise the Prime Minister for the way in which the Shah’s reception was organ ised. In particular, the triumphal arches were said to have been erected contrary to the Shah’s expressed wish and paid for by contributions forcibly exacted from the people. Only the Tudeh papers and those associated with Sayed Zia ignored the Shah’s speech to the deputies. It was printed in full by the more responsible papers and was the subject of a number of leading articles. 9.

Soviet Persian relations. i State Department were not aware that notes exchanged between the Persian and Soviet governments last spring had been communicated to the Security Council or that a note concerning Article 6 of the 1921 Treaty was ready for communication to the Security Council should circumstances warrant this.. They knew that some in the Persian Government had been in favour of preparing a note on Article 6 at one time but the Persian Ambassador in Washington had counselled that only the exchange of notes with the Soviet Government and perhaps information about border violations should be communicated to the Security Council for the latter's information. 2.

The State Department emphasised that the decision on these suggestions would be left to the United States Delegate (owing to the presence in Paris of most of the high State Department officials) and that consultation with the British would probably take place there. ' State Department realised that the timing of such a move was very important since the desirability of making clear to the Soviet Government where the United States Government stood on the Middle East must be balanced against the Soviet Government’s probable views cf effect on its own prestige in the light of ■/international - • ~ developments generally. In particular it might be disadvantageous to have any trouble about Persia in the ' Security Council if the latter/proved unable to do anything • about the Berlin controversy. ’ State Department thought that only their representatives in Paris were in a position' to judge. According to the State Department the United States A mb a s s ad or in T e hra n h ad rep or t e d that he had only t a Iked. . to the Persian Government (and even so without specific instructions) about the General suggestion for a'note to the Security Council referred to in paragraph 2 above' : (soe Tehran- telegram No. 81.8 paragraph two) and not about a note primarily concerned with article 6 of the 1921 Treaty. r . Mr. T/iley’s advice to Persian Government on latter subject (.see third sentence of paragraph 3 of Tehran telegram No,8’50)was therefore news to State Department. We accordingly suggested that our conversation should be treated in confidence. .. The State Department thought that the Persian Government would not in any event take action with the Security Council before the matter had been threshed out a bit further in Paris,.

I appreciate that the Soviet Government may protest to the Persian Government against the renewal of the American Military Mission agreement. If they do so the Persian Government might be well-advised to communicate the text of the note and of any reply which they make, to the Security Council as they have done with past correspondence. But to appeal to the Security Council to consider a revision of Article VI of the 1921 Treaty might well provoke Soviet reactions similar to those vrtiich a direct denunciation of the Treaty would provoke (Mr. Burrows* letter No. E5327/552/54 of the 8th.May). To make such an appeal at the same time as the Military Mission agreement is being renewed would result at the least in greatly intensified Soviet pressure on Persia. 2. A further reason why in our view it is.desirable that the State Department and ourselves should discourage the Persian Government from referring the 1921 Treaty to the Security Council at present is that if the Persian Government did so they might well feel bound to. attempt to restore their position with the Russians by taking some action against United States and .United Kingdom Governments. They could be expected to make difficulties over the communicat: on which is to be made to them about the Continental Shelf in the Persian Gulf and to make trouble for the A. I.O.C. who are at present engaged in delicate negotiations with them /5. In the light» Foreign Office telegram No* 11665 to Y/ashington 5. In the light of State Department's views summarised in your telegram No. 3539 [of 8th July] advising against denunciation of the Treaty it is rather surprising to us that the United States .Ambassador in Tehran should have advised in favour of asking Security Council to recommend revision of Article VI which we believe must necessarily have much the same effect. We feel bound to instruct'His Majesty's Ambassador at Tehran to advise against this course and we should naturally be most reluctant for him and United States Ambassador to give divergent advice. You should put the above considerations to the State Department and ask them whether they would reconsider advice given by Mr. Wiley and express the hope that it may be possible for us to continue to keep in line on this matter.

Prime Minister received me this morning and explained in more detail what the Persian Government proposes to do* 2* It seems that notes exchanged between the Persian and. Soviet Governments last spring have in fact been communicated to the Security Council. Owing to my absence last summer I was unaware of this. But after this communi cation had been made the Persian Government prepared a note containing appeal to the Security Council for consideration of Article 6 of 1921 Treaty. This note requests the Council to recommend the revision of Article 6 so as to render it compatible with existing'conditions, i.e. the demonstrable absence of counter revolutionary forces in this country which might constitute a threat to the Soviet Union and also the fact that there is now in existence a Security Council specifically empowered to deal with such a threat should it ever arise. If the Council prefers not to recommend a revision of Article 6 the Persian Government asked for it to be declared null and void. 3. Mr. Hajir explained that although this note was drafted some months ago it was decided not to communicate it to the Council but to hold it in abeyance. A copy is with the Persian Ambassador in Washington so that the necessary communication can be made at short notice whenever it seems desirable. United States Ambassador has now informed the Persian Government that he considers that the time has come for this note to be communicated. Mr. Hajir asked whether I agreed with this view. I said that my personal opinion on such points was unimportant, but I under took to ask you for instructions and I shall be grateful if I may receive them in the course of the next day or two. /4.

I have discussed this telegram with the United States Ambassador but so far as I am aware he has not yet received instruction foreshadowed in paragraph 2. For my own part I venture to comment as follows: (a) It is becoming increasingly clear that no real progress is likely to be made without constitutional change of some kind, no matter by whom it is initiated. (b) Subversive movements are already at work. If they were to gain the upper hand it would be too late to initiate reform. (c) Both the United States Government and His Majesty 1 s ' Government have received a full statement from the Shah himself of the reforms he has in mind (see my despatch 58 [gp.undec ? January 20th]. (d) There is no confirmation whatever of statement that 50$ (or any appreciably lesser proportion) of Persian garrison in Azerbaijan is ’teady to desert'. (e) The Shah is far from backward in making known his progressive views on important social and other issues. He needs no encouragement in this. On the other hand nothing, but harm would come of ventilating the issue of constitutional reform unless it were intended to follow publicity with action. (f) The Shah is frequently seen on public occasions and is personally popular no matter what may be thought of his attempt to dabble in party politics.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT CONFIDENTIAL E 11135/25/34 j&amp;- JE ji t \ ' r 3 1943 PERSIA August 24, 1948 Section 1 Copy No. 162 PERSIA: ADMINISTRATION OF M. HAJIR’S GOVERNMENT Sir J. Le Rougetel to Mr. Bevin. {Received i 2Ath August) (No. 275) Sir, Tehran, IMh August, 1948. When Hajir’s Government received, on 29th June, a vote of confidence by 88 votes to 6 (as reported by Mr. Creswell in his telegram No. 521), the prospects both of political stability for some time to come and even of some progress in administra tion and economic reform seemed to be good. The relative calm of the last month has, however, been caused more by apathy and the hot weather than by a sense of security, and the reforms have not yet left the paper on which they are written. 2. A number of parliamentary commis sions have been charged with the investiga tion of certain branches of the Adminis tration. One is dealing with reform of municipalities, one with general questions of justice, and a commission composed of the Under-Secretaries has been meeting at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to discuss the selection of personnel. M. Pirnazar, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, has been the target of considerable criti cism in the press, and the announcement that the counsellor and first secretary of the Persian Legation in Brussels had been removed has not increased public confidence in the civil service. 3. There has also been criticism of the appointment of two Under-Secretaries to assist the Prime Minister himself. One of these, M. Moaddil, has the title of Parlia mentary Assistant and the duty of answer ing for the Prime Minister in the Majlis. He is also charged with the general super vision of the Press and Propaganda Office, which is directed by M. Faripur. The other is M. Jehangir Tafazuli, brother of the proprietor of Iran Ma. Although described as Political Assistant, his duties are not clear, but he is known to be on good terms with the Russians and is believed to be employed to guide the Prime Minister in his relations with Left-wing politicians. The interviews which the Soviet Ambassa dor has recently had with the Prime Minister have provoked lively comment, but 118-4 no details are available. Before his depar ture on leave the Soviet Ambassador was accorded the unusual honour of a luncheon at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 4. A further step towards internal reform was a letter of the Prime Minister’s to all Governors-General, published on 31st July, calling a conference to discuss the protection of home industries, and to fix a proper proportion between the cost of agricultural produce destined for the fac tories and the finished products of industry. Owners and workers of all concerns employ ing more than 100 workpeople were to be represented. At the same time the Prime Minister announced that another confer ence would be held to study agricultural questions and the relation between land- owners’ profits and the share of the culti vator. The Minister of Agriculture, M. Bushihri, has announced his intention of purchasing agricultural machinery from abroad, and suggested that greater use be made of oil as fuel in order to arrest the serious deforestation of the Caspian provinces. 5. After his election the Prime Minister made the budget his personal concern, and as a result of his efforts it was approved by the commission on 1st July and a draft was published, but it has not yet been debated in the Majlis, and on 24th July another provisional twelfth was approved. 6. The Labour Bill is second only to the budget in importance. Until it becomes law, and until the position of the Ministry of Labour is regularised and a Minister appointed, there can be no prospect of a permanent improve ment in the relations between employers and employees. The original Bill of some fifty articles has twice been redrafted and is now reduced to twenty-one articles, but the passage of a Bill of this length still seems to look too much like hard work for the present Majlis. A budget of 20 million rials for the Ministry of Labour has been approved by the Budget Commission, and the Under-Secretary, M. Habib Naficy, has2 &gt; formed a commission of factory inspectors which will supervise the activities of factory inspectors all over the country. 7. The Majlis has done practically nothing. In the first half of July the special commission to investigate charges of corruption against Qavam-us-Saltaneh reported in his favour by 3 votes to 2. When this verdict was announced it created an uproar in the Majlis. The next step was that the report of the special commis sion should Te referred to the Commission of the Ministry of Justice, and this was known to favour Qavam. His opponents, after angrily expressing their opinion that the whole affair was illegal, left the Majlis and again absented themselves from the session of 15th July, where their absence prevented public business being done. On 18th July there was again no session as most of the Deputies were present at the airport at 4 a.m. when the Shah departed for Europe. At the following sessions a law was passed allowing foreign traders to import any goods which were already on the way at the time the law of 8th July came into force, a provisional one-twelfth of the budget was also approved, and on 25th July the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement about the Shatt-el-Arab and announced that negotiations were in progress with the Iraqi Government fof a permanent settlement of the boundary dis pute. The Majlis then adjourned until 8th August. Two sessions have been held since the recess, and at neither of them was there a quorum. 8. The Fast of Ramazan was this year enforced by the Government with unusual severity. The most vociferous opposition to M. Hajir’s election as Prime Minister came from the religious leaders, and it was perhaps to be expected that he would take steps to assure them of his orthodoxy and devotion to Islam. M. Hakimi's Govern ment had already appointed a commission to make proposals for the restriction of the sale of alcohol, and on 3rd July a decree was issued prohibiting its sale at the religious centres of Meshed, Qum and Rey. This was followed two days later by a police order prohibiting during Ramazan the sale of alcoholic drinks and the sale of food in restaurants during the hours of daylight. Except in the case of the three hotels frequented by foreigners, which were allowed to serve meals, these regulations have been enforced. 9. On 26th July a decree of the Council of Ministers was published altering the exchange control regulations. Under this decree the control exercised by the Bank Melli is increased, and its effect should be to narrow the gap between the official and free market rates of exchange. It has been attacked as unpatriotic by those who believe that all Persia’s problems could be solved by the enforcement of a rate of 60 rials to the £. 10. There is evidence that the Govern ment intends to do something about provinces. The Bill for the creation i? provincial universities has been approved in commission, and the Prime Minister has issued instructions to Governors-General about the collection of the harvest. M. Jamal Imami, the Minister without Port folio charged with the affairs of Azer baijan, made a statement to the press on 2nd August, in which he announced that a trade route had been opened from Tabriz to the Mediterranean and that measures were being taken by the Government to improve local communications, to facilitate the issue of licences to Azerbaijan mer chants and to grant a credit of 10 million rials for Tabriz University. The proposal for a general amnesty for those concerned in Pishevari’s Democrat Government has also been widely discussed, and, it is believed, will shortly come into force. Although proposed by the Majlis Deputies for Azerbaijan, it is viewed with some disquiet by those responsible for keeping law and order in the province. 11. The inactivity of M. Hajir’s Govern ment has disappointed the country. No organised opposition to it has yet emerged, but the press is now increasingly critical. Sayed Zia is still believed to be in contact with Ayatullah Kashani, but even if they went seriously into political partnership it is doubtful whether such a union of oppo sites could achieve anything constructive. The return of Qavam-us-Saltaneh has taken away Sayed Zia’s chances of the leadership of a reformed Democrat Party, but Qavam himself still seems content to remain in the background—perhaps secure in the knowledge that without the votes of his party Hajir would not have come to power. Abbas Iskandari, who led the small minority which voted against both Hakimi and Hajir, put down a written interpellation on 29th July on the old subjects of Bahrein and the southern oil, but this has not yet been debated in the Majlis, and when it is there is no reason to suppose that Iskandari will be able to command more than the same handful of Russophile Deputies. 12.

S ECRET Eight addressed to Foreign Office No. 810 of 5th October, repeated to Washington, Moscow and B.M.E.O. (Cairo). My despatch No. 319: Political situation in Persia. Shah received me in audience today. He has just returned from Isfahar where he ioaugarated Kuhrang irrigation scheme and he expressed lively satisfaction with the good start mode by Messrs. Alexander Gibb with this project. 2. iis regards the political situation in this country His Majesty expressed disgust and apprehension. He pointed out with much truth that the Majlis as at present constituted was quite incapable of positive action. It was seven years since they had even passed a budget and there seemed to be no real prospect of any improvement in this wretched state of things. Some deputies now talked of resigning. If 50 or more of them were to do so the Majlis would be automatically dissolved but there could be no certainty of this. 3. He was therefore thinking of asking the Prime Minister to make an announcement in the Majlis to the effect that the Shah invited deputies to prepare the way for changes in the constitution which would bring it into line with those in force in other democratic countries e.g, a reform of the present futile quorum rule, an increase in the life of the Majlis from two to four years and some provision for dissolution if it should prove impossible to form a reasonably stable government. In putting these proposals to the Majlis the Prime Minister would make it clear that unless they were accepted within four months the Shah would feel obliged to abdicate. 4-. I pointed out that such a decision could hardly fail to create a dangerous situation and that it would be widely represented as an unconstitutional act on His Majesty’s part, but he refused to admit this, presumably on the ground that he cannot be deprived of the right to surrender his throne if he/....Tehran telegram No* 810 to Foreign Office - 2 ~ throne if he wishes to do so* He said that he absolutely refused to .acquiesce any longer in the present deplorable state of his country in which a handful of corrupt political manipulators in the capital had a free hand to exploit the misery of their ^ess fortunate compatriots all over the country. 5. I did not feel that any useful purpose would be served by contesting this view, more especially as I entirely agree with estimate of present position on which it was based. But I pointed out that only an exceptionally able and forceful Prime Minister could be entrusted with the execution of such a programme. Did he think that M. Hajir would be up to it? If not whgm did he propose to appoint in his place? The Shah tfyen considered various alternative candidates, Mahommed Sa‘s Ed, Reza Hekmat, Tabatabai etc., only to dismiss them all. Finally, as I had foreseen, he mentioned Qovam and it was clear that he would like to feel that he could count on him. It was.also cle,.r that he wished to knov/ whether I meant to press Qavam on him,..but I did my best to avoid giving His Majesty any such impression and thereby discovering his innate dislike of such a solution. On the other hand I did not express any objection to Qavam for it may soon transpire that his return to power is the only way out of the present deadlock for which Qavam himself is, I suspect,largely responsible.

(Received Wth August) : (No. 261) Tehran, Sir, 3rd August, 1948 With reference to my despatch No. 240 of 6th July, I have the honour to submit the following report on developments in Persia during the month of July 1948. The principal event of the month was the departure of the Shah for Europe: the Government continued to prepare legisla tion for submission to the Majlis and was occupied, in particular, with the prepara tion of the Budget: there were no develop ments in foreign affairs beyond a sounding made by the Soviet Ambassador regarding the policy of the new Government. Foreign Affairs 2. In 1st July, in the course of a courtesy call on the Prime Minister after the forma tion of his Government, the Soviet Ambassador outlined the terms upon which the Soviet Government would be prepared to settle outstanding questions with the Persian Government. He said that the questions of the return to Persia of the Bank-i-Melli gold, of the Customs claims arising from the war and the cessation of frontier incidents and hostile propaganda from the Soviet side were minor matters which could easily be settled if the Persian Government were prepared to give Moscow some satisfaction in the form of a “ gesture ” to restore Soviet prestige in connexion wuth the rejection last autumn of the proposal for forming a Soviet- Persian oil company, and if the Persian Government were prepared to terminate the activities of the United States Military and Gendarmerie Missions. The Prime Minister consulted the United States Government and His Majesty’s Govern ment, who were in agreement that Persia’s attitude to this approach should be one of firmness, that the Prime Minister should demand the satisfaction of the gold and Customs claims, and the cessation of frontier incidents as of right and should not be led on to discuss the wider political issues raised : but that there would be no objection to the opening of negotiations for an agreement to cover current commercial exchanges. This advice was given to M. Hajir in the middle of the month; the matter was, however, pursued no further, as the Prime Minister did not wish to re open it by summoning the Soviet Ambassador again. It was rumoured at the end of the month that M. Sadtchikov would shortly return to Moscow, whither he had been recalled for consultation. In the course of the month the Soviet Consul- General at Resht, and the Soviet Consuls at Ahwaz and Kermanshah, all left their posts for leave or consultation; and a further sign of a change in Soviet policy was the closing down of the Russian school in Tehran and the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society. 3. There appears to have been an unex pected hitch in connexion with the delivery to Persia of United States armaments under the Arms Credit Agreement. The difficulties connected with the payment of packing and transport charges (see Tehran despatches Nos. 70 and 151) appear to have arisen afresh owing to unwillingness on the American side to meet these charges in addition to the cost of the very great reduc tion in prices quoted in connexion with the sale of the arms themselves. 4. The Helmand river dispute did not develop further during July, but it is note worthy that the “show of force' men tioned in paragraph 8 of my despatch under reference was duly forthcoming in the second half of June. Fifteen Hurri canes of the Hurricane Regiment were moved to Zahidan, ostensibly to carry out gunnery and bombing practice. The Chief of the Persian General Staff confirmed to the military attache that one of the objects of this exercise was to impress the Afghans, whose Air Force is reported to consist largely of Ansons. Independently of the American proposal for a neutral commis sion to settle this question, bilateral discus sions are to be resumed between the Persian and Afghan Governments. 117-392 Internal Situation 5. News of the impending departure of the Shah from the country for his visit to the United Kingdom and Western Europe gave rise to a certain amount of opposition, both on the part of the Government, who were nervous of the additional responsi bility which would devolve upon them during His Majesty’s absence, and on the part of a number of deputies, some of whom may have been moved by reasons of hostility to British policy or to the dynasty, though in most cases their opposition was due to nothing more than vague nervousness and anxiety. The Shah was himself careful to pay due consideration to these feelings, and after detailed consultation with the Gov ernment on the internal situation in the country, in which the possibility of a post ponement of the visit was mentioned, he made an announcement on 12th July about his forthcoming departure on 18th July and summoned the members of the Majlis to the Saadabad Palace on the fol lowing day in order to explain his decision to them. In the event, once the public had been notified of the visit, reactions were far from unfavourable and the press as a whole welcomed his journey to London both as a contribution to the improvement of Anglo- Persian relations and as a means of making the Shah more closely acquainted with the democratic and Parliamentary traditions of the United Kingdom. 6. After the successful vote of confidence reported in paragraph 5 of my despatch under reference, the position of the Govern ment is thought to have weakened slightly, as many of its critics are believed to hold the view that Mr. Hajir has been trying to please all the deputies all the time. His action in appeasing the Mullahs by impos ing strong police measures as regards Ramazan has been specially criticised. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the Government still has a substantial majority and it has settled down to the preparation of various legislative measures which will shortly be brought before the Majlis. The most important of these is the first com plete Budget which will have been sub mitted to the Parliament in the last four years, previous Governments having lived from hand to mouth by adopting the expe dient of making monthly votes equivalent to one-twelfth of the annual budget. The Senate Bill and the Labour Law are also expected to be submitted to the Majlis in the course of the next few weeks. Finally, the Commission entrusted with the study of the Seven-Year Plan has pursued its labours and it is expected that the Bill will be submitted to Parliament in the course of a month or so. Though there were at one time doubts of the Government’s keen ness and sincerity over this matter, I under stand that detailed discussions between the Prime Minister and the protagonists of the plan in the latter halw of the month^^uc- ceeded in convincing the latter that-M. Hajir does, in fact, mean to put the plan forward with sufficient eagerness and energy. 7. New Government regulations for the allocations of foreign exchange for imports were announced on 28th July. The Majlis has also approved a Government measure exempting from the provisions of the article in the Rice Bill restricting the activity of foreign traders (see my despatch No. 240) all goods which had been ordered but had not yet been passed through the Customs when that Bill was approved. The Bill itself has given rise to protests from many foreign diplomatic missions whose nationals were affected by it, and retalia tory action has been taken by the Swedish Government against Persian traders in Sweden. The Provinces 8. The proposal to grant an amnesty to persons implicated in the Azerbaijan Democrat regime, and to allow those who have been deported to the south to return to Azerbaijan has created some anxiety in that province. The authorities there feel that the law and order which they have pre cariously enforced for the last eighteen months is not likely to survive the return of the Muhajjirs, and they regret that M. Taqizadeh, and more recently Dr. Martin Daffari have, in their speeches in the Majlis, painted an unjustifiably gloomy picture of Azerbaijan. These feelings have to some extent offset the good impres sion made by the appointment of a Minister responsible for Azerbaijan and the hope that the new Government was getting to the heart of the matter when, on 15th July, the Governor-General, Ali Mansur, was recalled to Tehran. It is reported that he is to be succeeded by the present Minister of Court, Mahmud Jam, when the latter returns from Europe. 9. In Khuzistan the Governor-General continues to keep a watchful eye on Tudeh activities. At Khorramshahr Rear- Admiral Zelli and the local governors have formed a committee for this purpose, but rumours that the second anniversary of the oil workers’ strike on 14th July would be marked by disturbances proved ground less. Although their visible activities have recently amounted to little more than thedistribution of pamphlets, the Tudeh Party in Khuzistan have succeeded in creating a feeling of uncertainty among the authorities. Both the number of meet ings and the attendance of the Central Unimi of Oil Workers have dropped in rec^R weeks. Public security is reported to be bad near Khurramabad, in Luristan, but to be good elsewhere in south-west Persia. 10. For some time the Javanrudi, one of the more turbulent Kurdish tribes, who inhabit an area north-west of Kermanshah, have been giving trouble. They have encouraged smuggling across the Iraqi frontier, they have taken illegal toll from travellers and, in contrast to neighbouring tribes, have not contributed materially to the Government’s measures of tribal dis armament. During the second week of July the G.O.C., Kermanshah, ordered some five hundred troops to the tribal area. He hoped to bring the Javanrudi to heel by peaceful means, and employed three air craft to drop leaflets, but when one of these was fired on he decided to use force. One of the loyal neighbouring tribes was called on to co-operate with the Persian army, largely with the object of preventing the escape of the Javanrudi across the border into Iraq. With the aid of this tribe two military columns succeeded in bringing the Javanrudi leaders to heel after a brief engagement in which a few tribesmen were killed. Four military garrisons, each of about battalion strength, are now to be established in Javanrudi country to super vise the handing in of arms by the tribe and to remain until conditions have entirely quietened down. 11. In the Bakhtiari country there has been a brush between two minor tribe^-q the Mahmud Saleh and the Mamivand-— over pasturage rights. This incident has increased the determination of the military to disarm the Muhmud Saleh, who are reported still to possess between 2,000 and 3,000 rifles. 12. Prospects for next spring’s harvest are causing anxiety. In Khuzistan the Governor-General continues his consulta tion with the grain company, and hopes on the one hand to obtain help from the northern provinces, and on the other hand to prevent the leakage of wheat to Iraq and Kuwait, which still continues in spite of recent measures. In the irrigated parts of Northern Khorassan the harvest promises to be good, but speculators have already started buying forward at high prices, relying on there being a bad harvest in Southern Khorassan and Seistan. A Wheat Commission has been formed by the Governor-General of Khorassan to devise a means of preventing the harvest from being cornered by the northern landlords for their own profit. 13.

With reference to my despatch No. 209 of 9th June, I have the honour to submit the following report on events in Persia during the month of June 1948. The prin cipal event was the change of Government at Tehran, M. Hajir succeeding M. Hakimi as Prime Minister in spite of considerable extra-parliamentary opposition which gave rise to demonstrations lasting several days. There were no outstanding developments in foreign affairs; frontier incidents with Soviet connivance continued on the Azerbaijan frontier. Internal Situation 2. As forecast in my despatch under reference, M. Hakimi’s Government did not survive for long. On 8th June M. Hakimi made his report to the Majlis, reviewing the period he had been in office and asking for a vote of confidence. In the division which followed he failed to obtain an absolute majority and his Government resigned. The defeat of the Government was followed by five days of indecision and intrigue, while the fractions debated the election of a new Prime Minister. Although there was no question of his taking office himself, the influence exercised by Qavam-us-Saltaneh was considerable, and it was widely believed that the new Prime Minister, whoever he might be, would lead a caretaker Government and would withdraw whenever Qavam was ready to take office. The refusal of M. Suhaily to be considered as a candidate (he had recently been appointed Ambassador to France) narrowed the field to MM. Hajir, Muhammad Said and Bayat, and on 13th June M. Hajir was elected by 66 votes out of 120. 3. The announcement of M. Hajir’s selection as Prime Minister provoked an outbreak of hostile demonstrations in Tehran. The active instigator of these was the mullah, Kashani, but the name of Sayyid Zia w T as widely associated with them. Beginning on 12th June, the distur bances culminated on 17th June, when a large crowd encountered soldiers and police outside the Majlis and several people were wounded. The Chief of Police had already issued a warning to rioters, and on 19th June the Prime Minister himself drew the attention of the public to the article of the Penal Code against incitement to disorder. 4. Meanwhile the Prime Minister had chosen his Cabinet, which was presented to the Shah on 21st June (see my despatch No. 229). Its members had for the most part held office in recent Cabinets, but the Prime Minister, like his predecessors, seemed to find the filling of his team a difficult task, and, as finally constituted, the Cabinet did not give an impression of uniformity or cohesion. It includes, how ever, several Ministers who are known to be pro-British in sympathy and progressive in their ideas, and M. Hajir has expressed his determination to tackle the country’s chief internal problems with all means at his disposal. The new Government's pro gramme was announced on 22nd June. The declaration affirmed Persia’s adherence to the charter and principles of the United Nations and her determination to safe guard her rights on all frontiers. The internal programme included measures for reducing the cost of living, increased local participation in Provincial Government, reform of the Administration, the imple mentation of the Seven-Year Plan, and the formation of a Persian company to exploit the petrol of the northern provinces. The Prime Minister referred to negotiations with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and to the question of Bahrein in his first press conference, but did not mention these questions by name in the Government s official declaration of policy. 5. The debate on the Government pro gramme in the Majlis continued for several days, and though individual members did not hesitate to attack the Prime Minister, 117-82 it became clear that the opposition to him was not strong. It also became known that the Shah was in favour of an early vote of confidence for the new Government. Out side the Majlis the name of Sayyid Zia faded from the headlines and Kashani’s opposition confined itself to the religious newspapers, where an attempt was made to make the demonstrations of 17th June appear as no more than a peaceful religious procession. At the conclusion of the debate on 29th June, M. Hajir obtained eighty-eight votes out of a total of ninety- six Deputies present. 6. The suspension of activity during the change of Government reduced the legisla tive work of the Majlis to a minimum. In the first week in June many Deputies who were opposed to M. Hakimi’s Govern ment stayed away in order to prevent business being done, but on 8th June the Rice Bill was passed, with the inclusion of a clause, irrelevant to the main subject of the Bill, prohibiting importation by foreign traders. Thereafter there was a long and almost unbroken lull. Discussions on the Seven-Year Plan and on the Senate Bill continued in commission, and the Labour Law was reported to be ready for submission at the end of the month. Foreign Affairs 7. Continued reports of frontier viola tions by the Russians kept the press and public in a state of some anxiety at the beginning of the month. A frontier post on the Araxes River was reported to have been attacked on the night of 10th June, and there have been other attempts at in filtration. On 15th June a Soviet fighter aircraft made a forced landing at Bandar Gaz on the Caspian Coast. These incidents formed the subject of a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Ambassador, who in his reply denied all knowledge of the incidents, for which he said the Soviet Government was in no way responsible. The negotiations with the Soviet Government for an agreement to regulate commercial exchanges during 1948-49 were brought to a standstill by the fall of the Hakimi Government. 8. In the first half of the month the Helmand River question figured largely in the press. Unfriendly references to Afghanistan provoked an open letter from the Afghan Ambassador, in which he tried to prove, by reference to a note from the Persian Embassy in Kabul, that too much water, and not too little, was flowing into Seistan. This attempt to make capital out c of the spring floods only aggravated the situation, and many newspapers demanded a show of force on the Afghan border. After further discussion the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a statement con firming that both Powers had submitted the dispute to the United States Government for arbitration. 9. Considerable progress was made in the negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government regarding the settlement of claims between the two Governments arising from the war, in connexion with the use of the Persian railways and with damage inflicted on the Persian navy. Substantial agreement was reached on both these matters, and by the end of the month the negotiations were about to he concluded, in each case, by an exchange of notes. A new civil airline operating internal services in Persia—the Eagle Airlines—began operations during the month; it is under B.O.A.C. technical management and control. 10. The long-standing uncertainly about the exact scope and function of the United States Gendarmerie Mission has been brought to an end by an exchange of views between the United States Embassy and the Persian Government. The head of the mission, General Schwartzkopf, has now been transferred after five years’ service in Persia and has been shcceeded by Colonel Pierce; the functions of the mission have been clearly defined as being purely advisory, and the executive command of the gendarmerie rests with the Persian Ministry of the Interior. The Provinces 11. M. Taqizadeh (former Persian Ambassador in London), who is one of the Deputies for Tabriz, spent the first half of the month in his constituency, and on his return spoke in the Majlis on the situation in Azerbaijan. He contrasted the present unhappy state of the province with the prosperity he had known in the past. He urged that deportations to the south should be stopped, that the railway from Tehran to Tabriz should be completed, and that wealthy merchants and landowners should remember that it was their duty to return to their province. The announcement that one of the Ministers without Portfolio in the new Cabinet, Jalal Imami, has been 'given the special task of dealing with the affairs of Azerbaijan may mean that some of these abuses, which, to a lesser degree, are true of most of the provinces, may be remedied.3 12. In the south there has been little activity. It is not yet clear whether General Ahmadi’s visit to Fars and Khuzistan has had any effect on the smugglers, but eight merchants have been arrested in Ahwaz and the Governor- Gsfleral of Khuzistan has formed the com- pa / for selling grain at fixed prices, which was referred to in the Monthly Report for May. Highway robbery in Fars continues on a reduced scale, and on 12th June a bandit was publicly executed at Shiraz. The tribes have completed their move to summer quarters and the collection of arms continues at a leisurely pace. 13. In Isfahan the future of the Pashmbaf factory has not yet been decided. It is being run for the time being by a committee under the supervision of the Governor-General. No noticeable progress has been made with the Kuhrang irrigation scheme. 14. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Wash ington, Moscow and Bagdad, and to the British Middle East Office, Cairo, Air Headquarters, Iraq, through His Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, United Kingdom High Commissioners at Karachi and New Delhi, and to all His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia.

The Shah received me in audience to-day. He was in good health and spirits and has obviously benefitted by his journey. He expressed great appreciation of his reception in England and of what he saw there. He seems to have been much impressed, and I think surprised, by our moral and material strength. 2. His Majesty dwelt at length on the internal political situation here and it was clear that he is determined to go ahead with his plan for constitutional reform* I urged him, as I have done in the past, to make a determined effort to push the Seven Year Plan through the Majlis before raising yet more controversial political issues, but I do not feel that I made much impression, for it is now fairly clear that v/ith the best possible intentions the Shah is quite determined not only to rule but also to govern. He agreed, however, that the Seven Year Plan Bill should be introduced v/ithout further delay. He did not anticipate serious opposition but pointed out (quite rightly that it was scandalous that the budget should still be m suspense. He thought that the present Government would need reforming, but that Hajir would be ecqual to the task, and would then be able to give the country the stable government which it needs. 3. With regard to constitutional reform, there were His Majesty said two possible courses. One was to proceed at once to create a Senate, which would then introduce a bill to establish a Constituent Assembly. This procedure would take at least six months. The other course would be to introduce in the Majlis the bill to establish a Constituent Assembly, and if the Mailis refused, tohavean immediate referendum. I have little doubt that His Majesty would prefer the second course, but I pointed out that whatever the merits of either might be, a referendum on such an issue might be a source of grave embarrassment. It would raise the political temperature and therefore play into the hands of subversive elements, while the issues involved were hardly such as could be explained to an uneducated electorate. I also pointed out once more the grave danger of raising the constitutional issue unless overwhelming support was first assured in the Majlis and in the country, / 4.

The Prime Minister told me last night that immediately after the departure of the Soviet Ambassador on leave he ^ceived a visit from two prominent members of the Tudeh party, Keshavarz and Yazdi, who presented him with a memorandum setting out conditions which their party considered essential for a restoration of internal ppiitical equilibrium and of friendly .relations with the Soviet Union. 2. The Prime Minister said that he had asked this deputation to state whether their memorandum was intended to express the views of their party as a whole and, if so, what was the strength of their following in the country. They replied they were not at liberty to answer such questions. The Prime Minister however is m no doubt that they were sent by committee of their party actmg under mstructipns from Soviet Embassy. In fact, therefore, though not in foim, memorandum (substance of which as subsequently published in the press is contained in my immediately following telegram) is in his opinion tantamount to an^official intimation of views of Soviet Government; and it supplies information which the Soviet Ambassador forbore to impart at his meeting with Prime Minister on August 3rd.

It is too soon after my return to.offer definite comment but I suspect that the Minister for Foreign.Affairs surely over-emphasised Sadtcnikov’s statement of grievances by removing them from their context. If this is so he may in his desire to accelerate the Shah*s return have given His Majesty an unduly alarming impression. [Copy sent to Mr. Dening in Mr. Wright*s absense].

Prime Minister received me yesterday mining. and gave me a full account of recent events.. i 2. Shah's visit to England at this time had. he said, increased the difficulty of his own task in consolidating the Government,,which he had only agreed to form at His Majesty's express request. His political Opponents had not given him respite which is usual at the outset and they continued the attack on him, and through him the- Court, with persistent bitterness. In this they were largely inspired by Sayid Zia# .-.However, he was, he said, determined to fight it out and Ms main purpose would be to ensure that cohesion between the Government, Majlis and the Crown which had been sadly lacking in recent years. I assured the Prime Minister that in this task he could count on my firm support, I also told him, to the best of my belief His Majesty , s visit to England had been an unqualified success. 3. It was clear from what the Prime Minister said that his views on constitutional reform are the same as our own-i.e., that the time is not ripe for such an experiment. . . - -: 4.

M. Hajir'does'not'-expect serious opposition to the* Bill which has bt^en amended so as to bring [grp.undec] under effective Government control*. He is however seriously perturbed about financing the programme and reverts -to the overt suggestion reported in Mr t Creswell’s [grp.undecJ for a sterling or dollar [grp.undec ? credit] of some £10,000,000. 5. I said I was not authorised to discuss such.a matter. He explained however that what he had in mind_was not a Government credit but a ’’purely commercial transaction' erg., an advance royalty from anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Without some such help he saw no real prospect of any development being realised* Aijglo-Iranian royalties were now about one/sixth of ordinary 'revenue- ^tod^correspondedgraughly to the proposition ; - already earmarked for * current de ve 1 opmeri 11''' 'Such development might with advantage he incorporated''in'-the s ?T en y ear P la;n it would not by itself relieve the situation end other measures would require other finance. 4s increases of direct or indirect taxation were quite impracticable proposed increase in note issue only domestic source available.

SadtchikovTehran telegram No:660 to Foreign Office - 3 - that M. Sadtchikov would shortly be going on leave and [? grp.omitted] asked to.see him. ’ # .• i .. . 8* « On both of these occasions much the same ground was covered but according to M. Hajir there were differences of emphasis. At the first meeting Sadtchikov seems to have made it abundantly clear that relations between the two countries could not be expected to revert, to normal .unless the Persians made amends for the ’‘insult 11 offered to the Soviet Union by'rejection of-ail agreement, and in particular agreed to the withdrawal of United States-military and-.gendarmerie missions. At the second meeting he still maintained that some gesture by the Persians would he an indispensable prelude to better relations but did not specify what it should bo # On this occasion he complained of removal of Governors General such as Ali Mansur from Tabriz and Ashrafi from Meshed because they had not been sufficiently anti-Soviet. He also referred to numerous frontier incidents which have occurred lately and to offensive line of -certain sections of the Press. On the whole, however, Sadtchikov's attitude at this second meeting seems to have been less uncompromising than before. 9. The Prime Minister for his part persisted In maintaining that if a ’’gesture” were to be made at all it should be by Russia whose policy towards this country since 1946 had been quite different from that which under lay treaty of 1921 and had done much to destroy Persian confidence in Soviet sincerity. While vigorously rejecting and even ridiculing the suggestion that Persia was plotting or conniving at aggression against the Soviet Union, he drew the Ambassador’s attention to the serious dilemna which had been forced upon this country by the cessation of all normal commercial intercourse with her Northern neighbour. The economy of the Northern provinces was already undermined and if collapse were to be averted Persia would soon have no alternative but to divert their exports from the North into other channels. This they did not want to do. 10. The Soviet Ambassador seems to have been impressed and the Prime Minister thinks it quite possible that the Soviet Government may shortly agree to open trade negotiations. Knowing that M. Hajir would thereupon be exposed to fierce criticism by diehards here, I volunteered the personalf Tehran telegram No,660 to Foreign Office volunteered the personal opinion that it would be an excellent thing if such negotiations could take place, provided of course that there was no question or any future attempt to infringe Persian sovereignty. May I be authorised to assure him that this is also the view of His Majesty 1 Government?

(No. 209. Confidential) Tehran, Sir, §th June, 1948. With reference to my despatch, No. 151 of 4th May, I have the honour to submit the following report on events in Persia during May 1948. Relations between the Soviet Union and Persia continued to show some slight improvement in spite of a frontier incident on the Araxes River. The Persian Government gradually lost its majority in the Majlis and its position at the end of the month was extremely insecure. Qavam-es-Sultaneh returned to Persia from abroad, but has not yet re entered the political arena. Foreign Affairs 2. After his change of tactics during April, when he emerged from a mood of sulkiness which had lasted since the rejection of the draft agreement for a Soviet-Persian Oil Company in October 1947, the Soviet Ambassador continued to give an appearance of cordiality to his relations with the Persian Government. In his pursuit of sweet reasonableness he even went to the length of attending the salon of one of the Princesses to hear a recital b^ a Greek pianist, sponsored by that monarcho-Fascist beast, the Greek Charge d’Affaires. The visit of a Persian delega tion to Tashkent to take part in the celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the poet Ali Shir Navai also seems to reflect a more conciliatory attitude towards Persia than the Russians have shown for some time. 3. M. Sadchikov again visited the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the beginning of the month and is said to have complained of lack of response on the Persian side to the hand of friendship extended to them by the Soviet Government. The Persian Government, however, were forthcoming enough to act on a suggestion that conversations should be held between the Minister of National Economy and the head of the Soviet Trade Delegation with a view to negotiating a new commercial 115—65 16808 indexed for May 1948 {Received \bth June) j »' / agreement, and on 25th '''May it was announced in the newspapers that the Minister had submitted to the Cabinet the heads of a proposed agreement regulating Soviet-Persian trade over the period of twelve months starting at the end of March 1948. The proposed agreement is based on the quotas fixed for the preceding year, and the Soviet Government have asked that approximately one-quarter of the total Persian import quota should be earmarked for Soviet products, including sugar, cotton piece-goods, cotton yarn, agricultural machinery, iron and steel manufactures, newsprint, mineral oils, chemicals, furs, plywood, electrical apparatus and silver, platinum and precious stones. Against this, the Soviet Government ask for rice, wheat, barley, lentils and peas, vegetable oils, livestock, horses and camels. In ask ing for authority to negotiate an agreement on this basis, the Minister of National Economy has stated that he intends to modify the list of Soviet exports according to the needs of the market, and the list of Persian exports according to the yield of the harvest. The efforts of the Persian Government to discuss the question of Persian gold blocked in Moscow and of customs duties has so far met with no response on the Russian side. 4. An incident occurred on the Araxes River at a point between Julfa and the Caspian coast in the second week in May, when a force estimated to number about forty men in Caucasian dress and armed with automatic weapons crossed the frontier and were engaged by a Persian patrol. After an exchange of fire, causing casualties on both sides, the irregulars withdrew across the river by the light of flares from the Soviet frontier guard. The purpose of this frontier violation is not clear, though the men concerned may have formed part of a group of irregulars on their way through Azerbaijan from Soviet territory to Northern Iraq. The Persian Government is believed to have protested about this incident in a diplomatic note to the Soviet Ambassador.2 5. There have been expressions of sympathy with the Arab cause in Palestine, but no serious suggestions of any action beyond contribution to relief funds. mass meeting organised by the religious leader, Ayatullah Kashani, was held in the Tehran Mosque on 22nd May and another, later in the month, under the auspices of a group called “Moslem Union,” attended by the diplomatic representatives of the principal Arab States and by the Pakistan Charge d’Affaires. Criticism has been directed principally against the United States and Soviet Governments for pro moting arid officially recognising the Jewish State, and only to a lesser degree against His Majesty’s Government. On the whole, a distinction has been drawn between the Zionists and the local Jews of Persia, to whom no harm is apparently intended. In reply to questions in the Majlis, the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained, on 27th May, that the Persian delegation to the United Nations had consistently opposed partition and that the Government’s attitude in this matter would remain unchanged. 6. Although Afghanistan as well as Persia accepted a United States proposal for a neutral commission to investigate and make recommendations for the settlement of the Helmand water dispute, relations between the two countries remain unsatis factory and attacks on the Afghan Govern ment, against which the Afghan Ambassa dor has protested to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, have been made in the Persian press. 7. Diplomatic relations have now been resumed between Saudi Arabia and Persia and the first Saudi Arabian Minister to be accredited at Tehran, M. Saved Hamza Ghouth-al- Madani, presented his creden tials to the Shah on 26th May. The Govern ment of Pakistan has appointed as ambassador to Persia Ghazanfar Ali Khan, though he has not yet proceeded to his post. A delegation of Iranian journal ists who had visited Pakistan returned to Tehran at the beginning of May : their visit was very successful and they were most impressed by all they saw. 8. The Majlis approved, on 22nd May, a Bill authorising Persia’s adherence to the International Health Organisation; a similar Bill, for Persia’s adherence to U.N.E.S.C.O., was approved on 30th May by the Foreign Affairs Commission and will now be submitted to the Chamber. Internal Situation 9. The position of the Government has steadily weakened throughout the month. M. Hakimi, and particularly his Finance Minister, M. Nadjm, have for some time been the object of criticism, chief 1} because in their efforts to end corruption in public life they have inevitably come up against vested interests. In previous months oa|o- sition had largely centred upon the Mi^is parties of liberal tradition who, as reported in my despatch under reference, organised various meetings of protest against the Government's action which they repre- presented as being dictatorial and a threat to the liberties of the people. These meet ings have continued during the present month. These activities were largely led by Saved Zia-ud-Din who is thought to have made some working arrangement with the Tudeh Party for the purpose. During May, however, partly owing to this and partly owing to the return from abroad of Qavam-us-Saltaneh on 3rd May, the picture changed and opposition to the Government became manifest on a much wider basis in the Majlis. A coalition was formed between the three Opposition parties towards the end of the month, and finally a number of Deputies who had formerly supported the Prime Minister stated that they would no longer do so. At the end of the month, therefore, it seemed unlikely that the Government would survive for more than a few weeks. 10. Considerable public attention was directed to the affairs of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company owing to two debates in the Majlis on the subject of the negotiations carried out by Qavam’s last Government in November 1947, which were concerned very largely with the article in the conces sion regarding the progressive replacement of European and other foreign employees by Iranian nationals. In answer to an interpellation, the Finance Minister said that he had no trace of any negotiations opened by the former Government. This, and an open letter addressed to Deputies by the Left-wing agitator, Abbas Eskan- dari, called forth a statement from M. Hajir, who was himself Minister of Finance last November, in justification of his own activities and the Majlis then be came the centre of a public dispute between these two members of the Government. The matter was soon disposed of by a mutual apology, but the incident served to draw renewed attention to the terms of the A.T.O.C. Concession and also contributed to the unpopularity of the Finance Minister and to the weakness of the Government. 11. In consequence of the dwindling support for the Government, the Majlis was prevented in the latter half of the month from doing any useful work. The budgethas still not been passed and the financing of public expenditure is continuing on a basis of provisional monthly votes each of one-twelfth of the previous year’s budget. The Bill for the Seven-Year Plan of Eco- no*k Development was submitted to the Maps on 3rd May and was referred to an ad hoc commission of the House for detailed study. The commission has been working intensively at this task and it is believed that it will be ready to submit the Bill, with certain modifications, to the Chamber by the middle of July. The commission is thought to be in favour of strengthening the clause in the Bill which will give the supervising authority power to direct the execution of the plan without having to refer at every stage to the Government of the day. 12. A Bill for the creation of a Senate was submitted to the Majlis on 9th May, and referred to a commission. The Bill, which provides for a Senate of 60 members, 30 to be elected and 30 nominated by the Shah, was attacked in the press as another step towards dictatorship and an increase in the power of the ruling class. The Provinces 13. Demonstrations planned for 1st May took place in most parts of the country without any breach of public order. In Tehran and the larger provincial capitals meetings were organised by Government- sponsored organisations such as the E.S.K.I. Trade Unions. Tudeh meetings which were also held were on a relatively small scale and were not in any way provocative. The Government ban on pro cessions was successfully enforced. At Resht, a meeting organised by members of Qavam’s former Democrat Party was attended by the rank and file of the Tudeh Party, most of whom have now found it wor&gt;;h their while to become members of the E.S.K.I. Union—an unholy alliance which should be attributed to individual oppor tunism rather than to any significant political development. At Khorramshahr a meeting of 3,000 workers was held under the auspices of the recently formed Central Union of Oil Workers. The Tudeh Party held no meeting or demonstration, their May Day celebrations being confined to the distribution of pamphlets. They do not yet seem anxious for their leaders to be brought into the limelight. 14. Disarmament of the tribes continues in Pars and in the Kugalu country. The G.O.C., Ears, estimates that one-third of their arms have now been collected from tS*E X i- 16808 the Boir Ahmadi in his provinqe.^JJ? s i of this, there has been a furtheVui&amp;heriprk-^,,., tion in general security in the Shiraz area. The most serious incident for some time took place on 5th May, when thirty-five armed robbers were prevented by the gen darmerie from looting a truckload of sugar near Sarvestan, between Shiraz and Fasa. Six gendarmes and two civilians were killed. The Persian Government are also said to be apprehensive of tendencies to secede to Pakistan on the part of Baluchi tribes in the area south of Zahidan. .0 i Measures are being taken to limit move ment across the frontier, and preparations are being made to enforce some degree of disarmament and to bring these tribes under control. 15. In South Persia the shortage of grain continues to be serious, but efforts are being made to cope with the situation. On 6th May the Minister of the Interior visited Bushire, where the shortage of wheat was said to have been partly caused by its being smuggled by local merchants to Kuwait. This year’s crop, which will be harvested towards the end of June, should be a good one, but to bridge the gap the Minister arranged for supplies of rice to be made available. In Khuzistan the crop will not be adequate to meet the needs of the farmers themselves and the Governor- General, in addition to asking for supplies from other centres, has planned to form a company of the leading merchants in the province to sell grain at prices fixed by the Government. Harvest prospects in Seistan, the most important granary of East Persia, are also poor : though there is now water in abundance, the extreme drought last year and the drying up of the Helmand River resulted in a very small area being sown. Crops are expected to be only 45 per cent, to 60 per cent, of a normal year’s yield. 16. The Commission of the Ministry of Labour appointed to examine conditions in the Isfahan textile industry has now com pleted its investigations. Meanwhile con ditions are still unsettled (see paragraph 18 of Monthly Report for February) and at the beginning of the month a strike was threatened at the large Pashmbaf factory, which has about 1.300 employees. Wages are two months in arrears and the direc tors, who were assumed to have misappro priated the funds, have fled to Tehran. However, a loan of 2 million rials has been granted by the National Bank and work has been continued without interruption. Work on the Kuhrang irrigation scheme is still delayed. The Shah, who hoped toinaugurate the work early in June, is not now likely to do so before September. 17.

The Prime Minister today told me that he had received reports that Sayed Zia and Qavam - Saltaneh were in contact with a view to combining their forces at some suitable moment in order to get him out of office. The former was also said to be in touch with the Soviet Embassy and the latter to have the support of the Americans (which had been repeatedly expressed by a member of the Embassy staff). 2. I said that he should really dismiss from his mind any stories of American interference in internal politics here and that he knew, as well as I did, that the ambassadors policy was one of strict non-intervention. Deputies and others were only too ready to misinterpret and exaggerate remarks and enquiries made by junior members of the Embassy staff whose sole purpose was to keep the Embassy informed of what was going on: and that it was foolish to attach importance to such things. 3. In general I said he should not be too much concerned by these reports of opposition activity - the fact was that the country was quieter and the Government more stable than v/e would have dared to expect some weeks ago, to this he assented and I hoped that he would benefit thereby to go ahead with his corstructive policy. A. I have no means of estimating the truth of reports mentioned in paragraph 1. But whatever he may be planning for the future I do not think Qavam is likely to challenge the Government for the next month or two: nor would he be in a position to profit himself until he has been cleared of all charges ag^ind; him.

Paragraph 5_of your telegram Nos: 5538 lTo'f the tlftW&amp;o JjiMi Soviet-Persian Relations]- The position as we see it is that the Soviet Government in a series of notes protesting against the rejection of the Soviet-Persian oil agreement and against the presence of the United States Advisory Mission with the Persian army have put the Persian Government on notice that they feel justified in taking violent action at such time as they think fit- 2- In spite of Soviet hints about the 1921 treaty it does not in fact seem to us extremely likely that the Soviet Government would invade Persia and so start a train of incalculable international consequences. It seems much more likely that they will proceed by building up the Tudeh Party both politically and industrially and by fomenting trouble wherever they can, especially in North West Persia. 3* Recent Soviet activity has included (a) The Soviet Ambassador's complaints to the new Persian Prime Minister about the rejection of the oil agreement and the presence of the American Military Mission# (b) Frontier incidents# (c) Routine propaganda attacks. Internally the TudehForeign Office telegram No:8021 to Washington - 2 - Internally the Tudeh Party maintains its position and the party's trade unions have considerable influence. But there has been recently no marked increase in Tudeh activities. If the Persian Government are right in thinking that the Soviet Government are encouraging Kashani in his agitation against them and the Shah this action would be consistent with the Soviet policy of stirring up trouble by any means that come to hand. 4.

He had had information of journeys to Provinces (Kerman Yezd Isfahan) by representatives of Kashdiz with the object of stirring up trouble, of approaches made by certain deputies to Mansour; Governor General of Azerbaijan (who had been recalled) and other elements at Tabriz in favour of a Republican plot, of contimed activities of Sayed Zia with the support of wealthy commercial interests and of contacts between the Soviet Embassy and Hedjazi editor of one of Sayed Zia’s papers. He said that though the situation at present called for no action, it might develop in such a way as to make it necessary to arrest or exile one or more of these people, in order to prevent any breach of security. I urged him to do nothing which could be regarded by the public as a provocation: in answer to questions of defence I repeated the assurances I had given before that Sayed was not supported financially in any way either by the Embassy or by the iAnglo-Iranian Oil Company and I said that I would repeat the instructions to the staff of the Embassy to give the lie to the allegations that we gave any kind Political support to friends who of course include wealthy merchants with whom British firms and British Military Authorities during the war have had many commercial dealings. 2.

The soundest course would appear to be for the Persian Government to continue to insist on satisfaction on. these two questions and on a cessation of frontier violations and to show that on there is no lack of desire for good relations by offering to continue discussions about current trade which should benefit both parties. 5. I agree with the State Department that it does not seem, at the moment advisable or necessary of the Persian Government to inform the Security Council of recent developments. v v v* Washington telegram No, 3.338 to Foreign Office - 2 - into Soviet intentions,. According to- the United States Ambassadors report the Soviet Ambassador had told the Persian Prime Minister that the loss of Soviet prestige resulting . u from .the failure of the Soviet-Persian oil negotiations 'had to be remedied' and that the presence of United States missions in Persia v/as 'inadmissible'. There seemed there fore to the State Department to be no room for further enquiries. The Soviet Ambassadors move, together with the exchange of notes in the Spring, and the frontier incidents, are, in the State Department’s view, one facet of Soviet pressure in general. They do not think that it would be advisable for the Persian Government to acquaint the Security Council with these developments at the present moment, since the.Soviet Government may be particularly sensitive to events, such as those in Berlin and in Yugoslavia which affect its prestige. They think it would be better for the Persian Government quietly to maintain a firm stand over its rights, as suggested by you. 5. State Department would welcome your views on the inter pretation to be placed upon recent events in Persia, including the apparent Soviet attempt to control Iranian airways. They are inclined to believe that this succession of incidents indicates that the Soviet Government is once again turning the heat on Persia.

Two points strike me about the Soviet Ambassador’s remarks: (i) he give no indication of what sort of ’'declaration or compromise” was needed to put right the matter of the Soviet-Persian Oil agreement. It occurs to me that he may be manoeuvring with a view to offering technical assistance and even finance to help the Persian Government’s proposed North Persian Oil Company, (ii) That he is trying to obtain important political concessions in exchange for doing things which the Persian Government are entitled to expect the Soviet Government to do anyhcw, i.e. (a) to hand over the gold due to the National Bank, (b) to pay the customs charges due for the war years and (c) to refrain from sending armed men over the Persian frontier and from propaganda against the Persian Government. 3. I think therefore that we can only advise the Persian Government to be extremely cautious and to attempt to find out what it is that the Soviet Government are proposing. But in order to shew their friendliness they might be well advised to continue their discussions about current trade which, if proper arrangements are made, should benefit both sides. And in order to show that they are not prepared to give up their rights they should also insist on the Soviet Government meeting their obligations over gold and the customs charges and on their refraining from frontier violations. 4. Before replying in this sense to the Persian Government I should like to make sure that there is nothing in the preceding paragraph incompatible with the instructions which the State Department will presumably be sending to the United States Ambassador in Tehran. Please discuss urgently with the State Department, and inform me of their viev/s. I am anxious to reply as quickly as possible to the Persian Prime Minister.CYPHER/OTP FRCM TEHRAN TO POREIGH.

Prime Minister yesterday sent for American Ambassador and .myself and gave each of us an account of his conversation two days ago v/ith the Soviet Ambassador. 2. After an exchange of slightly ironical formalities Hajir had raised the question of the frontier incidents asking that the Soviet Government should take measures to stop them. Sadtchikov had sought to make light of the incidents saying that minor friction of the kind was inevitable on so long a frontier and had gone on to attack Persia for having made herself subservient to American policy and for having become a base for possible American aggression, making his usual charges about United States service missions and about alleged strategical airfields and underground petrol storage installations (see point in His Majesty’s Ambassador’s telegram No, 106). The Persians had refused last year Stalin’s own offer of gratis supply of Russian armaments (and instructors) and was now.proposing to purchase American armaments at a price her economy could ill afford. 3. Hajir had then replied tha t if the Persians were now moving closer to America, Russia only had herself to : t blame for it and the more threatening and unfriendly the Russian attitude became the more the Persians would be, obliged to look the other way for assistance. Was this what the Soviet Government .really wanted? ’ There was no. truth in the stories of strategical preparations - nothing that was being done in Persia was in the least degree offensive and why should she build expensive installations for petrol storage when she had all she wanted at Abadan? If the Soviet Government wanted to improve relations let them show some sign of friendliness to Persia by stopping frontier incidents and hostile propaganda, by renewing commercial exchanges (particularly by taking exports from Azerbaijan) and by returning the Persian gold and paying /customs charges■% Tehran telegram No., 5% to Foreign,-Office. - 2 - customs charges due from the v/or years. 4. Sadtchikov had replied that a cessation of 'props ganda could only be done by a mutual agreement putting an end alao to Persian press attacks on the Russians, The others • minor questions and there would be no difficulty about giving Persia satisfaction over them provided: (a) seek, gesture were made to efface the bad impression Octob^r 0 ^ re ^ eG ^^ on Persian oil agreement last Persians would teminate the unacceptable state of ffairs represented by the presence and activities of the two United States missions, -Hajir had said that the- oil • - nnd ro °Pened: it had been decided once * thn l 1 ',' ihc Amb 3ss8dor nevertheless insisted that derl^Jti ? n ri G0Verriinent ^ ad lost mUGh P rosti ge and that some declaration or compromise was needed to put this right, v* • ? iG minister was anxious for the views of His under n S d ?Y crr + imerit Gn conversation.

V . • • The Government received a vote of confidence this morning by 88 votes to 6 with only 2 abstentions. Thi-s result is better than expected and is very reassuring. 2. The Prime Minister received me this afternoon a’nd;; ; described his policy, in pursuit of which he hoped for the^ ;: support of .His Majesty r s Government and United States ' f j •. Government o •’ t; p (a) He would put the labour law through, the Majlis as soon as possible, though in a slightly abbreviated form. (b) He intended also to take the initiative as regards agricultural conditions by summoning representatives or landlords and peasants and insisting on full utilisation of land for agricultural purposes* and on an assured standard of life for agricultural labourers; he for his part would ii: undertake to give the landowners Government assistance by enabling them to obtain agricultural implements and medical equipment on advantageous terms. For this he would require help from abroad. . ^ He would submit 7 year plan to the Majlis as soon as possible and proceed at once to implement it. (d) He would undertake a thorough reform of the administrative machine and a revision of status and terms of service of officials. 3. I said that (a) (c) and (d) were in accord with our conception of the basic tasks with which Persia was faced. As regards (b), details would need further examination. I could say however that examination of these problems by [gps. undec.] of the United States Embassy had brought out (D that development was a first priority and ( 2 ) that it should be effected by increased use if simple implements and by improved working conditions, rather thanV ■ J Tehran .telegram No. 521 to Foreign Office ( 2 ) by any far-reaching mechanisation of agriculture. These conclusions seemed to be in line v/ith nis proposal. In f eneral I thought that, though the extent of possible inancial assistance in execution of this programme might prove to be limited, he could rest assured of the general support and approval of His Majesty’s Government. 4. As regards foreign policy he said that he would take what measures were possible to prevent a repetition of frontier incidents with Russia, and would try to improve relations by establishing early contact with the Soviet Sabassy in order to propose resumption' of commercial negotiations (see my telegram No. 424). 5. He .also said he wanted to reopen negotiations with the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company on the clear understanding that he in no way challenged or disputed the validity or the concession itself (see my telegram No. 506). I said ^hat ! thought the canpany would recognise his goodwill, would receive his proposal in the same spirit, and would pe prepared to continue discussions which were tentativelv begun last Autumn. .

Goods he mentioned were sugar, cotton piece goods and possibly steel for housing and shoes, electric u wiring and fittings etc. Details could be worked out by experts but the main purpose of the proposal was two-fold: (D As anti-inflationary measure, (2) To.assist the 7 year plan, currency realis ation by sale of these goods be kg made to take the place of proposed increase in note issue by National Bank, to which he was oppos ed. 2. I have asked Commercial Counsellor before he goes to call on the Prime Minister and discuss this proposal further. Though no doubt it will be hard to interest the Treasury and though I understand International Bank can only extend loans for re habilitation purposes I would be glad to know what prospects there are of obtaining facilities for the Prime Minister s [grp.undec.] either from British or American sources. 5. I think this proposal should be judged not on its merits alone but against general background of economic development and the 7 year plan. Monetary aspect of plan will.need careful consideration and this is the first sign from Persian side of an awareness of the attendant dangers of inflation and of appreciation of usefulness of imports of consumer goods as a means of checking it.. The Persian Government will certainly need, expert advice on this aspect in a few months time and it has. been suggested to me that Leith Ross or some other British or American expert should then be invited to visit Tehran to go into these matters both with the Persian Government and with the planning authority when the latter has been constituted.
