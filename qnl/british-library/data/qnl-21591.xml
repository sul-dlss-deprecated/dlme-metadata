HISTORY. The following historical notes on Kuwait, Bahrein, Hasa, Qatar, Trucial Oman and Oman show the events which have led up to the present political status of these States. Kuwait. 1. General. —The town of Kuwait came into existence about the commencement of the 18th century, and was founded by settlers of the 'Utub tribe or Bani 'TJtba, a branch of the Anazah of Nejd. The 'Utub consisted of three principal divisions; the Jalahimah, Al-Khalifah and Al-Subah. The Al-Khalifah subsequently moved South and conquered Bahrein where their descendants rule to the present day, while the Al-Subah remained at Kuwait and founded the present dynasty. Kuwait sprang rapidly into an important commercial centre and soon became the entrepot for the trade of Cen tral and Northern Arabia, a position lost to it only within the last few years by the blockade instituted by Ibn Saud. Tt is still a centre of the pearl-fishing industry. 2. Belations with neighbours. —In the latter part of the 19th century, the relations of the Sheikhs of Kuwait with their powerful neighbour in the west, Ibn Rashid, the chief of the Shammar, were generally hostile, and it was largely owing to the assistance of Sheikh Mubarak of Kuwait that 'Abdul-Aziz Ibn Saud, now ruler of Saudi Arabia (and at one time a refugee in Kuwait), was able to conduct a successful campaign against their common enemy, thechap. i. history kuwait.

O S,ieikh Mubarak signed an agreement with the British Government, binding himself and his successors not to hand over any part of his territory to foreigners with out the consent of the British Government. Four years later he accepted a British Political Agent at his court. He subsequently regarded himself as under British pro tection and made important and exclusive concessions to ois. 3. Ttecent History. —On the outbreak of war in 1914, the Sheikh of Kuwait made a declaration of loyalty and placed his ' efforts, his men and his ships at the disposal of the Government of Great Britain ', offering at the same time to eject the Turkish garrison from the Islands at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. The termination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Kuwait, which EL M.'s Government had promised in November 1914 to recognize as an independent principality under British protection. As a reward for having entered the war on our side, the Shaikh was also exempted in perpetuity from paying taxes on his date gardens in Iraq. The outstanding feature of the post-war history of Kuwait has been the strained relations with Ibn Saud. Owing to the non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish conven tion of 1913, the boundaries of Kuwait, which had been defined in that convention, remained in a fluid state at the end of the war, and it was not nntil 1922 that an agreement was reached. Under this agreement Kuwait tost two-thirds of her territory.chap. i. history bahrein. 3 A further difficulty, to which no solution has as yet (1932) been arrived at, is that of the customs dispute bet ween Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kuwait. This dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El-Hasa in 1913, Ibn Saud acquired a sea board, which has, however, no port of any real value. A friendly understanding with Bahrein and Kuwait, therefore, on the question of customs and transit dues was essential. Agreement with Bahrein on the basis of a 2 per cent, transit duty was reached in 1920. Agreement with Kuwait has not yet (1932) been reached and since 1920 Ibn Saud has in consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Kuwait, with the result that the prosperity of the principality (as indeed of Qasim and Hail in Nejd) has been seriously affected. One of the principal causes of the rebellion against Ibn Saud in 1928 was the determination of the tribes of Northern Nejd to raise this embargo, which seriously affected trade as well as their livelihood. Relations between Kuwait and Iraq are outwardly cor dial. Bahrein. 1. General. —In considering the general history of Bah rein, it is necessary to go back to the year A.D. 1602, about which time the Portuguese were expelled from these islands by the Persians. The Persian occupation of Bahrein is of uncertain duration, but about 1718 the Muscat Arabs succeeded in establishing their power there. About the middle of the 18th Century, the tribe of Huwalah Arabs—still represent ed in Bahrein—held the chief authority, but as^ their power decreased as a result of internal feuds the islands for a short period again came under Persian rule. Bahrein had attracted the notice of the East India Company as early as 1613, but proposals to establiyh a representative there were abandoned, in 1763, in favour of Bushire. In 1783 the Persians, who were in possession, were expelled by an Arab horde frotti the mainland led by Sheikh Ahmad ul Khalifah of the 'Ubub tribe, and his descend ants have held the ruling power ever since.4 chap. i.—history—bahrein, I' rom this time onward the history of Bahrein is a tale ot protracted hostilities with Muscat, the Trucial Chiefs, and her neighbours on the promontory of Qatar. From time to time the Persians have made abortive attempts to recover the islands. Strenuous efforts have also been made by the Wahabis to gain possession of the State, which indeed, for a short period, they actually controlled. The Ottoman Government, in pursuance of its policy of extending Turkish influence in the Gulf, interfered in the affairs of the State. Meanwhile, misrule and piracy on the part of the Sheikhs of Bahrein, and dissensions among the \ arious members of the Sheikh's familv, weakened its power. British influence in the islands gradually increased. Treaties were entered into with the Sheikhs' of Bahrein extending that influence, and it was finally consolidated by an agreement signed in 1892. 2. Recent History. —(a) The Turkish claim to sove reignty over the Bahrein Islands, put forward from time to time since 1847 and as often denied by His Majesty's Government, was finally renounced by Article 13 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. This instrument however was unratified at the out break of war in 1914, and has not since been revived. (b) The claims of Persia to sovereignty over the islands bave persisted over a longer term of years and have been as constantly repudiated by His Majesty's Government. These claims (which have been referred by them to the League of Nations) have not yet (1932) been finally dis posed of. At no period, since the middle of the 18th cen tury, has Persia had effective control of the islands. (c) Ibn Saud's contact with Bahrein commenced with his capture of Hasa from the Turks in 1913. By the Treaty of Jedda, 1927, he undertook ' to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Bahrein ' an undertaking which has been fulfilled. His power is appreciated and feared, and Ibn Saud and the Wahabi movement represent a real danger to Bahrein. Were His Majesty's Government to abandon their present position, Ibn Saud would, as matters stand, be their natural successor.CHAP. I. HISTORY THE WAHABIS. (d) The Sheikh of Bahrein's relations with the Trueial Chiefs are friendly, and have been so for the last 90 years. (e) British relations with Bahrein are perhaps best e- scribed as those of a ' veiled protectorate over the islands The Government of India have been represented in' Bahrein since 1904 by a British Poht'ca! duties approximate to those of a Political Agent m a Native State in India. Treaties and Agreements were made wrbh the Sheikhs of Bahrein in the years 1820, 1861, 1880, 1892, 1898, 1911 and 1914. On the outbreak- of war in 1914, S h ai ^Jl?. ^ Khalifah loyally observed his agreement wiMi His M^esty Government and offered his assistance. Since the war tne relations between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh have remained friendly.

Even domes pver tombs and shrines were not permitted, and so the Prophets tomb in Medina, and other tombs and shrines in the Hejaz, which the pilgrims were wont to treat with reverence, rub themselves against and kiss were regarded as mere temples of idolaters. The Arabs had always been at heart staunch to the punciples of the puritan school of Hanbul and it needed but little effort to force the embers of fanaticism, ever latent among the desert folk of Arabia, into a flame. By the end of the 18th century the prophet and his champion Ibn Saud had achieved complete success. The H§sa province had succumbed to them, lesser states had been ravished and even the Ottoman Empire was threat ened. In 1801 the Shiah Shrine of Kerbela was attacked and desecrated. The lurks organised a force to recover tho Hejaz and to destroy the Wahabis, and in 1812 reoccwied Mecca, Medina and Taif. In 1818 Dara'iyeh was besieged and captured and Abdullah-bin-Saud deported with some of the more import ant members of his family to Cairo. The remainder were massacred. In 1842 F aisul, the grandson of Abdullah, regained the throne and by 1867 had restored to the Wahabi State something of its former glory. His death was followed by a fratricidal war between his sons Abdullah and Saud. This weakened the Wahabi State. In 1885 it fell an easy prey to Tbn Rashid of the Shammar Arabs and Saud was killed. His brother Abdullah spent the remainder of his days with the Shammar at Hail as a prisoner guest. The remnants of the Saud family went into exile in various parts of Arabia; the sons of Saud to the Hejaz, and Abdur Rahman, the 4th son of Faisul, with his children, to the southern shores of the Persian Gulf. The first effort made by the Wahabis to regain their lands from the Shammar was made by Abdur Rahman with the help of the Sheikh of Kuwait, in 1900. Abdur Rahman's forces were decisively defeated by the; Shammar, and Abdur Rahman abdicated in favour of hi* sson Abdul Aziz, known as Ibn Saud.(tf) CHAP. I.—HISTORY THE WAHABIS. In tlie winter of 1900-1901, the latter set out for the new capital of lliyadh with some 200 men. Of these he selected 15 and with them captured the capital by a stra tagem and thus recovered the throne of his fathers. The first years of his reign were spent in consolidating his position and in 1904 the Turks sent a force to help the Shammar stem the Northward advance oi the Wahabis. Early in 1914 Ibn Saud succeeded in driving the Turks out of the Hasa, and before they could organise a force against him they were involved in the Great War. Ct was about this time that the Wahabis realised that their name was held in general disrepute outside Arabia. Turkish propaganda combined with true stories oi acts of vanda lism and other atrocities had shocked the civilised world. They thought therefore that it might be advantageous to adopt a new name—the Akhwan (Is 1 Safa or the ' Brothers of Purity ' which was the title of a famous religious trea tise in Arabia. The name however was found too cum bersome and was shortened to Akhwan, which name, howr ever, has not been generally recognised in the outside world. Even in the Hejaz they are generally referred to as the ' Mutayyanin, i.e., those who have given them selves to religion '. In the Great War, Great Britain wished to enlist Ibn Saud's help against the lurks and Ibn Saud wished to get British support in his campaign against the bhammai who were allies of the Turks. An agreement was arrived at but the death of Captain Shakespear—the British re presentative with the Akhwan iorces in the first battle with the Shammar—nullified the effect of these operations. The end of the war found us trying to find some modus vivendi between Ibn Saud and the Sherif of Mecca, both of them our allies, but mutual hereditary enemies. The situation was made even more delicate in 1921 by the creation of the Arab kingdoms of Iraq and Trans-Jordan on the border of Nejd, under sons of the Sherif of Mepca, in both of which the British were to be the mandatory power. In 1924 and 1925 Ibn Saud was engaged in a campaign against the Sherif of Mecca, whom he decisively defeated,, and annexed the Hejaz, of which country he was later proclaimed King.s CHAP.

This was arranged by the British Political Authorities and the two vings discussed outstanding difficulties, recognised each others status and agreed to submit to arbitration future disagreements between them. Qatar. In 1909 the important tribe of the A1 Bu Ainain emi grated from Wakrah to Qasr al Subai near Qatif as a result of enhanced dues levied on their pearling boats. On the 17th July 1913 the veteran Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad a) lhani died and was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Jasim al Thani who had been his right hand man for many years past, his peaceful accession being; no 'doubt due to this fact.CHAP. I. HISTORY TRUCIAL OMAN. In 1915 the Turks abandoned Dohah leaving 3 guns, 500 shells and 105,000 rounds of ammunition. On the 3rd November 1916 the Shaikh entered into a new treaty with His Majesty's Government but the oper ation of three clauses, principally those regarding the re ception of a Political Agent and a wireless station was. postponed by agreement between the Shaikh and Sir Peicy Cox. Trucial Oman. 1. General. —The history of the region, now known as Trucial Oman, before the middle of the 18th century is almost entirely lost. It seems clear, however, that neither the Portuguese nor the Persians then retained any hold upon the country, and that the predominating influence was that of the Qasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Ivhaimah. The decline of Persian influence in the Gulf after the death of Nadir Shah first brought the Qawasim Arabs upon the scene, and from 1778 until 1823 their depreda tions by sea (and on land) were a scourge throughout the Persian Gulf. They even sailed into the Arabian Sea where at times they harried the coasts of India and the Arabian coast as far south as the island of Socotra. The Government of India took action against them in 1809-10 with a combined Naval and Military force which was successful locally, but whose action had no lasting effect. A second British attack in 1816 proved futile, but in 1819-20 a third expeditionary force, which had as an ally the Sultan of Muscat, was more successful. On the con clusion of operations a treaty known as the General Treaty of Peace was signed in 1820 by the Sheikhs of Ras-a - Khaimah, Hamra, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Sharjah, Umm-al- Qaiwain and also Bahrein. The main articles of this Treaty provided for absten tion from piracy, by land and sea, and the suppression ot the slave traffic. An Arab official was established as Agent of the Government of India at Sharjah in 1823. Piracy now ceased to be a profession, though cases of it occurred, and in 1835 the Beni Yas and Albu Falasah tribes revived the flickering spirit of piracy tor a time. The period 1820-35 was marked by hostilities with Muscat and internecine feuds among the Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast themselves.10 CHAP. I.

Although it has not been found necessary to exercise more than a nominal control over these States m the past, the recent establishment of an air route along the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf has brought this part of the coast into prominence. It is probable now that this air route is established that a closer control will be necessary. (b) No direct interference by Ibn Sand in Trucial boast affairs has been noticed since 1928. The Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai. together with a number of tribes subject to them, are believed to be opposed to Ibn Sand; the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Bas-al- Jvnaimah to be definitely his supporters; and the Sheikhs of A]man and Umm-al-Qaiwain to be neutral. But owing to the long-standing Wahabi connection with the Trucial Coast and the natural tendency of all small Chiefs in Arabia to look to Ibn Saud as the most important figure in Arabia, the indirect influence of Ibn Saud and Wahabism on the Trucial Coast is very strong, and all of tliem attach great importance to avoiding amy action which might be opposed to his wishes.CHAP. I. HISTORY—OMAN. 11 (c) In 1926 Persia commenced to adopt an active pcilicy in the Gulf. The result of this has been to bring her into conflict on certain points with the Trucial Chiefs and their interests. The Trucial settlements on the South Persian coast and the Trucial ownership of the islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, which is claimed by the Sheikhs of Sharjah, and Ras-al-Khaimah and which is con tested by Persia, have all afforded grounds of friction. In 1928 Persia put forward tentative claims to suzer ainty over the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast but these claims have not since been seriously pressed. Oman. &gt; 1. General. —The Imamate of Oman owes its origin to the peculiar tenets of the Ibadhi sect of Islam-—an offshoot of the Khawarij or ' Seceders ' who originated in the dis satisfied soldiers of the forces of the Imam Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet. Most of the tribes of Oman belong to the Ibadhi sect. The Imams were invested both with religious and civil powers and for a space of nearly 900 years until the acces sion of the Imam Nasir bin Murshid of the A1 Yaarabah dynasty in 1625, were elected for their personal merits or popularity, irrespective of family descent. There was how ever a preference for the ruling family and for the son, not necessarily the eldest, of the last Imam over other members of that family. In 1650 Nasir bin Murshid was successful in expelling the Portuguese from Oman, thereby acquiring a prestige which enabled his descendants gradually to modify the principle of election which had previously prevailed. 2. The ILinawi and Ohafiri factions.—The Yaarabi period was disturbed at the beginning of the 18th century, by a contest for the succession which paralyzed the power of the Imam abroad and gave birth to the Hmawi and Ghafiri factions at home, a source of anarchy which none of the later rulers of Oman have been able to suppress and very few to control. As the modern history of Oman is mainly the narrative of the enmity between these two factions, it is essential to know the origin and causes ot the feud.1 9 CHAP. I.

The gradual increase m the number of rival and aspiring ' Seyyids ' has been a fertile source of internecine feuds which have arrested the progress of the country. Up to 1793 the temporal ruler, who was also the spirit ual ruler of the country, had, in accordance with the prin ciples of the Ibadhi sect, been elected by the people. In 1793, however, Seyyid Sultan usurped the throne and pro claimed himself Imam, thus dispensing with the formality of election, and causing the tribes to look on the titu lar ruler as an usurper. The transfer of the capital from Rostaq in the interior to Muscat on the coast, which took place^ about this time, relieved the fanatical tribes of the interior of the direct control to which they had been accustomed. The relations with infidel foreign Powers which followed the transfer of the capital to Muscat and the progressive degeneration of the ruling house further weakened the position of the Sultan (as he now came to be called by the English) vis-a-vis the Omani tribes.

Between that date and 1913 numerous rebellions took place against the Sultan whose survival may fairly be said to have been due to the support of His Majesty's Government. 3. Becent Ilistonj. —In the years before the Great War tribal feeling was inflamed by the stoppage of the arms traffic, following xipon the suppression of the slave trade, at the instigation of Great Britain. A carefully organized conspiracy followed and in May 1913 the Omani tribes rose in rebellion. Reinforcements were despatched from India in accord ance with a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895 and the Sheikhs of tile interior were warned that attacks on Mus cat or Matrah, or indeed ou ports of the Batinah Coast, would not be permitted. This warning was disregarded and a large force of rebels under the so-called ' Imam ' made an attack on the Bri tish outposts stationed at Beit-el-Felej in January 1915 and were heavilv defeated. Ihe Sultan, however, was not permitted to follow up the victory and regain possession of his lost territories, &lt;111 cl by 1916 the rebels liad obtained complete control of Oman proper and established a Govern ment, the nominal head of which is the self-styled ' Imam '. The Imam was murdered by his followers m July 1920, and by September 1920 an agreement was reach ed involving recognition by the Sultan of the practical in dependence of the tribes oi the interior. Broadly speaking the situation has stabilized itself and the tribes of Oman, while they would, without doubt, con stitute a menace were the support of His Majesty s Gov ernment withdrawn, have ceased, at least for the time being to harrass the Sultan's Government.

CLIMATE KUWAIT. 27 N ote.— Water arrangements. —For a small force, say up to a brigade, it would be preferable to obtain drinking water from Sbatt-el-Arab at Fao. For troops it could be distributed in Kuwait by motor vans carrying tanks. The town of Kuwait gets it water largely in this way. It is brought in specially prepared local craft fitted with wooden tanks. 40 craft are always employed in water carrying. On an average 6 such boats arrive daily and bring approximately 35,000 gallons of water. If local craft are employed medical supervision would be necessary. 7. Climate. —The climate of Kuwait compares most favourably with that of other ports in the Persian Gulf. In winter, especially when a Shimal wind is blowing it is sometimes bitterly cold. In summer the heat of the sun is tempered by sea breezes and the sandy desert around cools down rapidly at night, ihe Barih wind blows for 40 days from the north-west by west from the beginning of June. Coming over the bay ox Kuwait it carries clouds of dust but reduces the temperature very considerably. The cool months are from November to March and the hot months from April to October. The rainfall occurs in the spring and winter. The average yearly rainfall is 4 , 8 inches. Good winter rains ensure the supply of water in the desert wells during summer. They also ensure abundant pasture in spring and incidentally increase the range and frequency of Bedouin raids.^0 CHAP, II.—CLIMATE—KUWAIT. Prevailing winds at Kuwait. Approximate Period. Name.

Epidemics. —There have been no epidemics of Cholera or Plague for many years. Small-pox is endemic all the year round. The town being walled lends itself to Strict quarantine supervision, the regulations of which are governed by the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1926. irisecis —A very few sandflies and mosquitoes appear in the Spring and Summer; the latter are mostly of the non- malarial type though a few cases of malaria have been v found during the last 3 years, in persons who have never -left the town. Flies are troublesome during the Spring :-and Autumn months only. No mosquito nets are necessaij. Hospitals. —There is a charitable Dispensary for Out patients only, but the American Mission have a hue Hospital, where Europeans can be treated. Quarantine. —The quarantine service for Kuwait Bahrein and Muscat is under the direction of the Political Agents at those places and the agency surgeon at each place acts as quarantine medical officer. 9 p os tal. —There is an Iraq Government Post Office in Kuwait; in which the postage stamps sold are however fVmse ef the Government of India. This latter arrange ment is due to the reluctance of the Sheikh of Kuwait to have the head of a neighbouring Arab ruler on stamps sold in his own territory. Now that Iraq has entered the iLeaeue of Nations and gained her independence steps are being taken to have a British Post Office and wireless -service. BAHREIN. General Rescript ion.—The Sheikhdom of Bahrein con sists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Manama, Muharraq, Umm-Na'san, Sitrah and Nebi Sala, with a number of lesser islets and rocks. The whole forms a ©ompact group almost in the middle of the bight whichCHAP. II. GEOGRAPHY BAHREIN. 33 separates the promontory of Qatar and the mainland of Hasa. The most striking feature of the Bahrein group of islands is the low-lying and flat featureless nature of the land and the shallowness of the surrounding sea. which is a mass of reefs, partially dry at low water. The anchorage of Bahrein is entirely exposed and land ing of men and animals would be much interfered with in a high wind from any direction. Muharraq, which lies north-east and is separated from Manama bv a strait miles broad, has a maximum dia meter of 5i miles, but owing to its horse-shoe shape has actually a very small area. Umm-Na'san, which is less than 4 miles by 2}, lies 3 miles off the west coast of Manama. Sitrah separated from the east coast by a narrow channel has a length of 4^ miles from north to south and a maximum breadth of miles. Nehi Sola, commonly called Jasaira, lying in the inlet of Kabb on the east coast north-west of Sitrah, has a diameter of only | mile. Manama, the principal island, has an extreme length of 30 miles from north to south and a maximum breadth of 10 miles. The land surface of Manama is mostly flat and low- lying but rises gradually to an interior plateau 200 to. 300 feet high, in the middle of which is an oval depression about 13 miles long from north to south and about 4 miles wide. On this plateau is the only hill on the island, Jebel Dukhan 440 feet in height. The plateau is stony and surrounded by a sandy plain which extends m all directions to the coast draining generally from west to east. On the north side of the plateau is a wide held of ancient tumuli covering about 12 square miles^ called by the Arabs Muraqib. A large inlet, Khor-el-Kabb, runs into the east side of the island penetrating nearly to the centre. With the exception of the central plateau the northern half of the island is covered with extensive date planta« tions while the southern half is sandy and barren.34 CHAP. II. GEOGRAPHY BAHREIN. ?'n- iT V \ Towns and Villages.—Manama, Muharraq and Uidd are the principal towns and there are about 100 villages in the islands. Manama The political and commercial capital and port, extends for miles along the coast in the north east corner of the island and has a depth inland of about j mile. The town is in the process of being modernised* there are many fine large buildings situated along the sea front, and electric lighting has been installed. There is a large and flourishing bazaar. The Political Agency is situated at the extreme north end of the island. Muharraq on the adjoining island is about the same oize as Manama and is the second town of the principality. The electric lighting from Manama has been extended to Muharraq. 1Alphabetical List of Principal Towns and Villages in Bahrein. Name. Position. Families. Water supply Wells. Remarks.

The atmosphere of Bahrein, owing to the proximity of the sea on all sides and abundant irrigation, is damp, heavy, and unhealthy. In January and February north winds blow and fires are necessary in houses. Though the weather is hot from the beginning of May to the middle of June, the heat is tempered by the sea breeze and the nights are fairly cool. The oppressively hot weather lasts from the middle of July to the end of September. In this period, though there may be irregular land breezes, the thermometer remains persistently above 95° F. All rains fall between November and May but actual wet days are few. The prevailing wind is the Shamal, or north-west wind. From the second week in June it blows for 40 days consecutively and is then called the Bariha. It is very violent in winter. On 33 per cent, of the days of the year the wind is north-west. On 20 per cent, of the days of the year the wind is west. And on 17 per cent, of the days of the year the wind is north. For the remaining days the winds and breezes are variable- Bahrein has the highest average annual relative humidity of any place in the Persian Gulf. The maximum humidity, however, occurs in winter. The maximum rainfall in 24 hours is 1-6 inches.CHAP. II. HEALTH BAHREIN. 4:3 6. Health. —Incidence of diseases in Bahrein— (1) Malaria. (2) Eye. (3) Digestive diseases. (4) Diseases of respiratory organs. The Spring and Autumn of the year are unhealthy seasons in Bahrein. During these months Malaria, dis eases of respiratory organs, Diarrhoea and Dysentery are generally more common than during the Summer and Winter. Malaria .—Malaria is now far more prevalent than formerly. This may be due to the numbers of artesian wells that have recently been bored in and around the larger towns. In 1930 35 deaths occurred at Galali from Malaria in less than a month. Venereal Diseases.—These diseases are very prevalent. Leprosy. —Five or six cases come under notice yearly. Dysentery. —This disease is common. Both types occur. Probably spread by lack of sanitation. pi a n U e. —A very severe epidemic started on 6th Janu ary, 1924, and continued until August of the same year. Small -pox.—An epidemic raged in 1928. Vaccination has been tried on a large scale, but the local inhabitants are just beginning to offer themselves for vaccination. Cholera. —Bahrein has been free from Cholera for the last fifteen years. Hospitals. —Victoria Memorial Hospital—Twelve beds. Not equipped for European patients. Non-dieting. Mason Memorial Hospital-Fifty beds. Can accom modate one or two European patients. Wdietmg. Women's Hospital—Twenty beds. The Victoria Memorial Hospital is attached to the Political Agency and ^ ^^ ^ ^^o 3Ts QiTarantine 11 Medical Officer for the Bahrein Government.

General. —This region is bounded on the north by the southern boundary of the Principality of Kuwait and on the south by the northern frontier of Qatar and the desert ot Jafura; on the east by the sea and on the west by the desert of Summan. It is a province in the dominions of Ibn Saud. The greater part of Hasa consists of steppe and desert rising westward from a low coast. The stony ridges of the Summan running more or less parallel with the coast of the Gulf intervene between Hasa and the belt of the Dahana desert which separates it from Nejd. Shallow wells of drinkable water are fairly numerous. The Hasa and Qatif oases in the southern part of the pro\ ince are the only fertile and well watered tracts in the area. - ■ Districts Hasa Oasis. —This is an oasis of great fer tility separated from the Gulf at Oqair by over 30 miles of desert. It contains the two large towns of Hofuf and Mubarraz. The mass of the cultivated territory extends for about, 12 miles to the east of Hcfuf and Mubarraz, but there are detached blocks of cultivation further to the noth. The most remarkable physical feature of the Hasa Oasis is tlie abundance of water in the cultivated area, from a very large number of springs, some of which are hot. Much or the area is marshy and there are two small lakes at Birkat-ul-Asfor, 12 miles E.N.E. of Hofuf, and Birkat Umm-ul-Mahza, 7 miles east of Ayim. The springs are x? i drama S e of the highlands of Nejd passing under the Dahana. &amp; The oasis extends for about 30 miles noth and south and 21 miles east and west.

The average maximum temperature would then be about 110 o F and the average minimum about 40 o F the hottest weather occurring in July and August. The cool season falls between November and March. Moisture is increased in the oasis tracts by the amount of surface water used in irrigation. The average rainfall would be about 4 inches, almost the whole being confined to the winter season and to the comparatively few wet days. Qatif has a very bad reputation for malaria, and most of the inhabitants suffer from enlarged spleens. Qatar. Qatar is a remarkable tongue of land projecting north wards from the coast about midway between Ras Musandam and Kuwait. The promontory as a whole measures about 85 miles in length by about 40 miles in breadth. Boundaries. —On the east, north and west Qatar is bounded by the sea. The southern boundary is indeter minate, but may be said to run from Dohat-as-Salwa south- eastwards to the wells of Sakak thence to the Khor-Al-Odaid. Physical characteristics. —Practically the whole promon tory consists of undulating rocky and pebbly desert. The northern part is very low-lying, though the southern por tion is generally higher than Bahrein Island. The only hill of any importance is Jabal-At-Tawar. The soil is poor, consisting in the best localities of gravel and marl mixed with sand. There are practically no fields or date groves. Such gardens as exist near towns and villages are small and unproductive. Hardly a tree is to be seen anywhere. The only natural vegetation is coarse grass, growing in tufts among the sandhills, and some occasional stunted brushwood. In the centre of the promontory the water level is be tween 150 and 250 feet below the surface of the ground.CHAP. II.

Boundaries.—On the coast, Trucial Oman extends, in the Persian Gulf from Khor-al-Odaid to Ras-ash-Sha'am, and in the Gulf of Oman from a point between the vil lages of Bei'ah and D&gt;ibbah to Khor Kalba. A line joining Ras-ash-Sha'am to this point between Bai'ah and Dibah forms the Southern frontier of Ru'us-al- Jibal, a mountainous district nominally subject to the Sultan of Oman.chap. ii. ge0g11aphy tuucial oman. 63 From a point between Khor Kalba and Murair the Eastern frontier of Trucial Oman, which is essentially fluid, turns inland westwards and then south, passing north of the districts of Mahadhan and Jau to an uncei - tain point in Khatam. From this point the inland dary follows the edge of the Ruba'al-Khali and Jaturah deserts running more or less parallel to the Gulf. 2. General. —Physically Trucial Oman consists of three zones or divisions—a maritime belt and islands; inland plains; and a. mountain system. The Western coast is low and monotonous. In the north there are occasional date groves but as the coast trend 8 away to the south and west trees die out, until at Abu Dhabi they cease altogether. The shore is lined by shoals, reefs and islands; creeks are numerous, uniting sometimes inland to form backwaters and swamps, and quasi-isiands are created in this manner. Navigation is extremely dith- cult and dangerous even to local craft and the whole coast is exposed to the strong Shamal (north-west) gales. The Eastern coast {i.e., that washed by the Gulf of Oman), is bold and steep, the hills in places coming down to the water's edge. The inland plains, which consist almost entirely of sandy desert, commence from the coast and merge m the north into the hilly tract and in the south into the desert. Mea gre desert vegetation and some wells and water holes sup port a scanty Bedouin population. The mountain tract is in the East where a section ol the spinal range of the Oman Promontory is included. This tract is about 50 miles in extent from north to south and its average breadth is about 20 miles. The mountain ridges run from north to south. The tract is bare and, for the most part, waterless. 3 The Principalities, (a) Abu Dhabi.-—This princi pality is the largest in the area. It stretches along the coast from the creek of Ghanadhah on the north to Khor Odaid on the west. Towards the interior the boundaries are ill-defined. They are said to extend on the east to the Baraimi Oasis and on the south to the margin of the Great Desert.Ukti* Poor,i, of ifljj chap. ii. geography trucial oman. m At the south end is a land-locked harbour with a depth of from 4 to 6 fathoms. Across the entrance is a bar carrying only 2 or 3 feet of water at M. L. W. S. The island is conveniently placed for use as a seaplane anc aor- age and has been used as such by the Royal Air Foice. (h) Dihai. —This principality lies on the coast south of Shariah between Abu Hail on the north and Khor Ghana- dhah on the south. Its extent inland is not precisely de- Ened. It consists of low sandy country without important natural features, the only hill being Jebel-al-Ali (22o ft.) 19 miles south-west of the town. The creek is suitable for use by seaplanes, for though narrow it is parallel to the prevailing wind. The principal settlement is; — Place. Dibai . Position. 7 m. S. W. of Sharjah. Water supply.

(c) Sharjah. —This principality has coasts on both gulfs. The northern boundary follows a line from Jezirat-al- Hamra to the southern extremity of the Jirri plain and from this point a line to Dibah on the Gulf of Oman forms the north-east limit. Its southern boundary is a line from Sharjah Town on the Persian Gulf to Khor Kalba on the Gulf of Oman. From this area the principalities of Ajman Umm-al- Qaiwain and Hamriyah must be excluded.66 CHAP. II. OEOGRAPHY —TltUCIAL OMAN. I'he principal settlements are: — Place. Sharjah Khan .

Boundaries. —The word Oman, in its widest geogra phical meaning, is used to designate that part of the Ara bian continent which is enclosed between the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the Ruba-ul-Khali, or Great Desert of Southern Arabia. The Sultanate of Oman is not coincident with Oman in its geographical sense; for Trucial Oman, the Baraimi Oasis and the Mahadhah tract are not included among the Sultan's possessions. On the other hand, the Gwadur Dis trict on the coast of Baluchistan, and the Dhofar District on the Southern coast of Arabia form part of the Sultanate of Oman. The dominions of the Sultan of Oman, if taken as c o m ' prising also independent and semi-independent localities, extend along the coast from Tibbat, on the west side of the Musandam promontory, to Ras Dharbat Ali in Dhofar. A small strip on the east side of the promontory between Dibah and Khor Kalba belongs to the independent Shaikh- dom of Sharjah in Trucial Oman, and must be excluded. The northern land frontier on the side towards Baraimi is vague; but may be placed at the watershed between Baraimi and the coast of the Gulf of Oman. The Ruba-ul-Khali, or Great Desert, forms the remaind er of the land frontier. 2. General. —Oman consists of three belts. First, th« low littoral extending for about 900 miles from Tibbat, on the western side of the Musandam peninsula, to Roe Dharbat Ali in Dhofar. From this must be excluded a70 chap. ii. geography—oman, small strip on the east coast of Ras Musandam from Dibab ^ r ,,^ a lba, which is in the administration of the minor chiefs of the Trucial Coast. The coastal strip varies in width from a few hundred yards to several miles. The second, and chief, physical feature is a mountainous tract which, commencing at Ras Musandam. runs parallel to the coast and terminates in the vicinity of Ras -al-Hadd ^ as Musandam to Dibbah this tract is called Ruus- ul-Jibal; the remainder is known as the Hajar of Oman and is divided by the Wadi Semail, bej'ond Jebel Akhdar into Eastern and Western Hajar. Hajar attains its maxi mum altitude (nearly 10,000 feet) in Jebel Akhdar a group of lofty mountains south-west of Muscat, enclosing many valleys of great fertility. The third and inner belt is a long and uneven south westward declivity of the high lands which merges into the desert of the interior. The country is not regularly divided into administra tive areas but falls naturally into several distinct geogra phical tracts. Ruus-ul-Jibal and the two parts of Hajar form three territorial divisions, and between western Hajar and the sea is enclosed the long and narrow, but fertile and populous, maritime district known as Batinah. Im mediately east of the rich Wadi Semail the mountains of Hajar approach the coast in confused masses and beyond this again the range actually skirts the sea almost as far as Ras-ul-Hadd. The valleys of eastern Hajar are not so, numerous, nor, with the notable exception of Wadi Tayin and Wadi Semail and their tributaries, generally so popu- lous as those of western Hajar. Separated ' from the Batinah by western Hajar lie the two inland districts of Dhahirah and Oman Proper. Of these Dhahirah slopes westwards to the Ruba'-uI-Khali, while Oman Proper, a table-land rising 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the sea and practically surrounded, by hills, discharge its drainage towards the Indian Ocean. Inland of eastern Hajar are the districts of Sharqiyah and Jaalan. Sharqiyah adjoins Oman Proper, while Ja alan touches the south-east corner of Sharqiyah at one end and the Indian Ocean at the other. •p T ^ T e barren and desolate coast from Ras-al-Hadd to Ras IS us has no general name. Off it lie Masirah and the Is una Muria islands. Beyond Ras Nus is the district ofchap. ii. geography oman. 71 Dhofar consisting of a highly fertile maritime plain and surrounded by the crescent of the Samahan hills. Springs and streams abound in the hilly districts of Oman and in Ja'alan, but elsewhere the supply of water depends entirely on wells and varies in amount and quality. 3. Districts, (a) Buus-ul-Jihal.—A mountainous dis trict forming the northern part of the Oman Promontory. Its coast line runs from Has Sha'am in the Persian Gulf round Has Musandam to Dibah-Beiah in the Gidf of Oman. The Trucial frontier between Has Sha'am and Dibah-Bei'ah form the southern boundary. The whole area is a maze of barren mountains which, on the eastern side, rise abruptly from the sea and form precipitous cliffs. The promontory is indented by numer ous deep water inlets, some of considerable extent. Two of them viz., Ghubbah Ghazirah (or Malcolm Inlet) and Khor ash Sham (or Elphinstone Inlet) form fine natural harbours, capable of sheltering a number of ships, but, owing to extreme heat, are impracticable as harbours during the hot weather for ships with European crews. The district is sparsely populated by the Shihuh tribe. The principal settlements are given in the table below : — Place. Khasab Kumzar Bei'ah Position. On south side of Elphins tone Inlet. At head of a cove on north face of promontory. On east coast of promon tory, 1 m. north of Dibah. Water supply. Remarks. Good water in abunda nee from wells 30 to 60 ft. deep.

Inland it extends to the foothills of western Hajar which run roughly parallel with the coast at a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The Batmah is famous for its date belt, which imges the sea shore and in some places extends for 7 miles inland Water is everywhere obtainable from wells the average depth of which is 15 to 20 feet. The district is populous and many tribes are represented. The chief of these are the Yal Sa'd and the Hawasinah. The Sultan maintains Walis or representatives at nine of the coastal towns.

It is about 30 miles in length and includes the upper basins of the Wadis Adai miles (Mijlas). Its greatest width is about 8 The principal towns are: Muscat Town.—The capital of the Oman Sultanate and the residence of the Sultan. Inland the town is cut off from the interior by rugged and precipitous hills of ieneous TnTand of\ eXt T d 10 - iles the coast to a^ptb inland of 3 miles. The town of Muscat is built in thechap. ii. geography oman. 75 basin formed by these hills at the head of the Bay of Muscat. Muscat consists of a walled town and an extensive col lection of unwalled suburbs. The town fronting the har bour is about half a mile in length from east to west and extends a quarter of a mile inland. The wall is built on the south and west sides and has towers at intervals. On the east side the hills are precipitous and no wall is neces sary. The main gate, is on the west side, the Bab-ul- Kebir, through which runs the motor road through the. majority of the suburbs and to Matrah. The Bab-us- Saghir, on the road to the village of Sidab, is on the south side. On the seaward side are two forts built on cliffs, about 150 feet high, on either side of the beach in front of the town. Tbey are of Portuguese construction and that on the east side called Jalali is used as a jail. The one on the west side is called Mirani. They are now of no mili tary value. Small blockhouses command the approaches of the town from the land side. The water supply of the town comes from wells situated about half a mile up the Wadi-ul-Kebir which receives the drainage of the surrounding hills. The water, though plentiful, is slightly brackish. Many of the houses of the town are well-built structures of two or more storeys. The British Consulate and the Sultan's palace ai-e situated on the sea front. The sub urbs consist mostly of mud huts, but some of them contain a few fairly good houses. Post and Telegraph Offices have been established by the Indian Government. The town is connected by cable with Jashk and thus with all parts of the world. The bay is three quarters of a mile deep and half a mile wide, giving good anchorage for steamers. It is open to the north-north-west and consequently to the Shamal wind. Matrah. —A large town about 2 miles to the west of Muscat. It is larger than the capital and is more import ant commercially, as it has direct communication with the ■interior. Like the capital, Matrah is enclosed by rugged hills on the landward side but its isolation is less complete.76 chap. ii. geography oman. The town is built at the head of Matrah Bay and extends along the beach for about | mile and has an aver age depth inland of J mile. It is protected on the land ward side by a wall with fortified gateways, the principal gate being the Bab-ul Kebir at the south-west corner of the town. By this gate, the road leaves to the village of Riwi whence routes branch to the Batinah coast and to various parts of the interior. On the seaward side, at the east end of the town, is a fort built on a rocky eminence. It is a Portuguese construction of the same type and value as the forts of Muscat. As around Muscat, blockhouses command the approaches of the town from the landward side. The houses of Matrah are meaner than those of Muscat. The suburbs also are more squalid. Water of indifferent quality is obtained from wells around the town. The Bay of Matrah is less remarkable in appearance than the Bay of Muscat and is more easily entered. Though open to the north-east it is sheltered from the north-west and is preferred as a harbour by native craft. It has anchorage for steamers. The town is governed by a Wali on behalf of the Sultan. (d) Western 11 ajar. —The mountainous district of Western Hajar extends from Wadi-ul-Kor on the north west to Wadi Semail on the south-east, having a length of about 160 miles. The watershed of the range is roughly parallel to the coast and runs at an average distance of 40 miles inland. Its boundary on the seaward side is the line of its foothills rising from the plain of the Batinah. The boundary with the district of Dhahirah is indefinite. The mountain system rises to its highest in the mass of Jebel Akhdar at its south-east end which has an eleva tion of nearly 10,000 feet. There are no large towns in Western Hajar and the small towns and villages are, with one or two minor excep tions, on the seaward side of the range. The most important valley in this district is the Wadi Fara,CHAP. II.

At Muscat and along the sea coast generally the climate owing to its humidity is relaxing and oppressive except in the coldest months. In winter from October to March cold and wet weather may he encountered, and malarial fever makes this season unhealthy. Muscat has the reputation of being one of the hottest towns in the world, and the thermometric observations present no cri terion for the actual intensity of the heat, which is here con centrated by the hills. The barren hills further sustain the heat throughout the day tintil midnight. The Batinah and the district round Sur is much cooler in summer, especially at night, than the rocky tract in which Muscat lies. In the interior the summer heat is dry and oppressive and hot land winds prevail./ / e) chap. ii. geogeapi!y—oman. 91 Tactia! poi® iiitv. called S® ghaandfc abi on lit ridge, (ii) Towei al led Ais ii neighlomis tidge N, J, of caipit! The ordinary annual rainfall in Oman varies between 3 and 6 inches but occasionally violent storms sweep over the country. The prevailing winds in the Gulf of Oman in the winter months during the north-east monsoon are Shamals and Nashis. The general direction of the Shamal is north-west but it changes with the trend of the coast. Its usual dur ation is three days but it may last seven. The Nashi is a north easterly wind which blows very violently in the Gulf. During winter south-east winds called Qaus or ' Sharki ' alternate with the Shamals, but only have great force from December to April. These winds often arise suddenly and are much dreaded by native craft; and, owing to the fact that most harbours in the Gulf are unsheltered, it is neces sary foil steamers to keep steam up while they are in port. The south-west monsoon is not felt inside Ras-Al-Hadd and only light variable winds prevail between June and Septem ber. Muscat and Matrah have the most sheltered anchorages on the Arabian coast, but landing of men and material would be much interfered with during a strong wind from any direction and may in the case of a Shamai or Nashi be held up altogether. Weather is the ruling factor in landing operations at every place along the shores of Oman, as with the excep tion of Muscat and Matrah every anchorage is exposed to winds from any direction.

They are given in the order of their incidence. Endemic— (1) Eye diseases. (2) Malarial fevers—all types. (3) Skin diseases. (4) Septic sores. (5) Digestive disorders. (6) Venereal diseases. (7) Tuberculosis (in over-crowded localities such as Muscat and Matrah). Epidemics. —Up to March 1930 no epidemic of plague had occurred for the previous 16 years. The last epidemic of small-pox occurred in 1922. Sporadic cases are common along the Batinah coast during the summer months. Cholera is infrequent, no cases having occurred for some years. Quarantine regulations are carried out at the port of Muscat in accordance with the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1926. The Political Agency Surgeon acts as quarantine medical officer. Insects. —Mosquitoes are numerous during winter parti cularly in the towns. The practice of storing water obtain ed from wells in cisterns and in earthenware vessels in houses as well as pools in gardens afford ample breeding places for mosquitoes. Plies are a pest during the cooler months but die off when the temperature rises in the hot weather. Hospitals. —There is at Muscat a Civil Hospital of 20 beds, non-dieted, and an out-door D-ispensary in charge of the Agency Surgeon, an officer of the Indian Medical Department assisted by an officer of the Indian Subordinate Medical Department. Two beds at the hospital are reserved for Europeans. 7. Postal. —There is a Government of India Post Office in Muscat.chap. iii. population. CHAPTER III. POPULATION. Kuwait. 1. Ethnography. —The population of Kuwait town which represents practically the entire settled population of the Principality is made up of a large majority of Arabs of the Awazim, Ajman, Mutair, Rashaidah, Beni Khalid, Da wasir. Anizah, Dhafir and other tribes, besides Hasawiyah or Arabs from Hasa, Baharinah from Bahrein, and Nejdis from Nejd. There are also a large number of Persians, some Jana'at, many Negroes, some Jews and a few Indians. 2. Characteristics. —The Arab population of Kuwait is not on the whole of a robust type. They are generally long faced, slender and inclined to lankiness. The complexion of many is sickly. The greater part are engaged in sea faring. fishing and pearl diving. The Persians are shop keepers and labourers. Though no census has ever been taken the settled population of Kuwait Principality is believed to be about 50,000 increasing to 65,000 in the pearl season. The only permanently settled villages are Jahra at the head of the Bay, Qasr-es-Sabiya on Khor-es-Sabiya, Zor on Failakah island. Dimna and Hawaii in the Qaraiah dis trict and the Qusur villages of Fantas, Fuhaihil, Abu Hulaifah and Shu'aibah along the coast. None of these are more than 25 miles in a direct line from Kuwait. The Bedouin within the recognised boundaries of the Princi pality, who still own allegiance to the Sheikh of Kuwait— are confined to such remnants of the Awazim, Rashaidah, Ajman, Mutair, Ataibah, etc., as did not join the Ikh- wan movement, and to wandering bands of the Solubba— the gipsies of Arabia. In the undetermined territory to the south, the tribes nearly all joined the Ikhwan move ment, more from expedience than conviction, but since the revolt against Ibn Saud in 1929-30 and the constitutional methods he is now introducing into his administration, Wahabi influence is rapidly on the decline, and the Awazim, Ajman and Mutair tribes are showing a greater desire every year once more to come under the principality and control of Kuwait.chap. iii. population—kuwait. 95 3. Tribal Camping. Grounds. —The principal camping ground for the tribes when entering Kuwait area are the wells of Wafra, Grain, Tawil and Suhaihiyah in the south, Jahra in the west, and those of Shaoniyah, and Dasma in the vicinity of Kuwait Town. But wherever there are wells Bedouin may be expected to encamp. These camping grounds are only occupied from May to September, when the scarcity of water in the desert drives the Bedouin to them. In winter no Bedouin encampments are found on the wells. Many of them during summer months work as divers with the pearling fleets. 4. Labour available. —Labour is available only in Kuwait Town. The great majority (about 2,000) are Per sians, but their numbers fluctuate. The water carrying trade from the water boats to the houses is almost entirely in their hands. The normal wage of a labourer averages Rs. 1-8 pel 1 day. If organized, there is no reason why they should not work outside Kuwait. 5. Census. —The following list gives the figures of popula tion, settled and nomadic inhabiting Kuwait and the sur rounding villages, most of whom are Sunnis of the Hanbali sect, though there are some Malikis. The Baharinath are all Shiah and the Persians mostly so. 5. Census. —The following list gives the figures of popu lation by categories. It is only approximate. Town or village. Category. Num bers.

III.—POPULATION BAHREIN. 97 Bahrein. 1. Ethnography—The largest community in the prin cipality is that of the Bahama who compose the majority of the Shiah community and about | of the rural popu lation. They are undoubtedly Semitic in race, but little is known about their origin, except that they were settled on the islands at tlie time of the occupation by Arabs from the mainland, towards the end of the 18th century. In the year 1783 Bahrein was overrun by Arab tribes chiefly from the neighbourhood of Kuwait and their des- cendents form the Sunni Arab population of the present day. The slave trade accounts for the large numbers of negroes. Persians have been established in the islands since the year 1601, and immigration has continued since. They come from Persian ports, notably Lingah. 2. Characteristics. —The population of Bahrein has been estimated at 120,000. Of this number Manama and its environs account for 40,000; Muharraq and Hidd for 30,000; while the villages account for the remaining 50,000. The inhabitants of the villages are chiefly Baharinah, Shiah, and form % of the rural population. They are mainly agricultural, but also depend though to a less extent, than their Sunni brethren, on pearl diving and other seafaring occupations. As a class their condition approximates closely to that of serfdom. The population of the towns of Manama and Muharraq is unusually mixed, being composed of Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Sunni Per sians and Shia Persians, negroes and Indians. The Per sian is the largest foreign community and they are said to number 15,000. They have doubled their numbers in the last ten years. The negroes number about 5,000. Indian Hindus are about 300 and Muslims 200, and are principally located in Manama. There is an important colony of natives of Hasa and Nejd, and a few Basra Arabs and Jews. For about half the year there is an influx of foreigners who come for the pearl diving. Pearl divers come from most of the Gulf ports, the largest contingent coming from100 CHAP. III.

Qatar is also visited by A1 Murrah from Hasa and in the cold weather by Manasir from Trucial Oman; 'Ajman too are sometimes seen, but not frequently. The inhabitants of Qatar—whether townspeople, vil lagers or Bedouin—are Maliki Sunnis in religion. From this statement we must however except the Sudan and a few of the Ma'adhid, who are Hanbalis; the Sadah, who are Hanafis and Shafi'is; the Bahama and Persians, who are not Sunnis but Shi'ahs, and the Arabs of Najd who are Wahabis. Negroes generally follow the religion of their masters. 1. Ethnography.—The total population of Trucial Oman has been estimated at over 80,000 of whom about 8,000 are nomadic. They belong to numerous distinct tribes. The country is, tribally, one of the most intricate and perplexing in the Persian Gulf. As a result of the slave trade in former times, there is a large negro element. 2. General. —With the exception of a few thousand nomadic and semi-nomadic Bedouins of the interior, who raise herds of camels and goats, and engage in a little cultivation, the bulk of the people live by the sea. In summer pearl diving employs most of the able- bodied men. In winter, though some take part in the ordinary fisheries, the majority are unemployed, being sup ported by the pearl boat owners during the slack season. The people are divided between the Hinawi and Ghafiri political factions. The population of the principalities of Abu Dhabi and Dibai lean mostly to the Hinawi faction. The majority are Sunnis (Malikis). The people of Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-al-Qaiwain, and Ras-al-Khaimah belong mostly to the Ghafiri faction, and a great many are Wahabis, though not of the militant order. Trucial Oman10^ CHAP.

III. POPULATION OMAN. 107 Oman. 1. Ethnography. —The total population of Oman has been estimated at about half a million, of whom at least 30,000 are Bedouin. Seven-eighths or more of the population are Arabs, the rest consisting partly of aboriginal tribes such as the Shihuh, partly of later immigrants representea by Persian colonists (the relics of former invasions) Baiii- chis (from the Mekran Coast), Indian communities at Muscat and Matrah and at most places on the coast, and a large negro element the outcome of several centuries of the slave trade. The Arabs of Oman belong to two distinct stocks, the Qahtani or Temeni who claim to be the earliest settlers, and the Adnoni or Nizari, the later immigrants, whose pedigree is regarded as less purely Arab. Each of these supposed racial groups is split up into a number of separate tribes and these again into sections and sub-sections. 2. General. —Throughout the whole of Oman faction feeling is strong, and political divisions are far more important than those of race. The two great political factions are the Hinawiyah and Ghafiriyah. The origins of t&amp;is political division have already been discussed in Chap. I. The two factions are intermingled throughout the coun try usually in groups of villages belonging to one tribe or section each maintaining a feud with neighbouring groups belonging to the rival faction. On the whole the Ghafiri- yah predominate in the north-west districts and the Hina wiyah in the south-east, 3. Beligions.—The majority of the Hinawi tribes belong to the Ibadhi sect of Islam. A considerable proportion of the Ghafiri faction are orthodox Sunnis but a few such as the Beni Bu Ali and the Beni Rasib are Wahabis. 4. Settled Population.—The following is a list of the «ettled population of Oman inhabiting the towns and prin-108 cipal villages. As no attempt at taking a census has ever been made, the numbers are necessarily only approximate. Place. Muscat di Matrah ,000 Komarks. The population is very mixed and in cludes few pure Arabs. Baluchis pre dominate : the next most numerous classes are Negroes and half-caste Arabs called Mawalid. There is a considerable Persian community. The Hindu community is smaller: there are a few Indian Khojahs some Jews, Abyssinians and Nubians. Occupations. —Baluchis serve as soldiers, sailors, porters, servants, casual labourers. Negroes and Mawalid are sailors, porters, servants, small traders and casual labourers. Persians are shop-keepers and fish mongers. Hindus and Khojahs are bankers importfers of Indian gbods, date ex porters, silversmiths; the commer cial community also includes Jews. Abyssinians and Nubians engage in fishing and casual labour. With the exception of the Persians, who are mostly Shiabs, and the Jews, the remainder are mostly Sunni Muslims, some of whom are of the Ibadhi sect. The population is as heterogeneous as that of Muscat. At least half the population are Balnchis. Hindus are fewer than in Muscat but Indian Khojahs number about 1,500 and form the headquarters of the Khojah com munity in the Gulf.

They are a pastural people and collect and sell fran kincense and other gums. They are re garded as belonging to the Ghafiri faction. The inhabitants belong chiefly to the Dha- wahir but they in clude some Nairn and Beni Yas. They grow many fruits in addition to dates and cereals. The DhaWa- hir and Ben Yas are Maliki by religion and Hinawi in politics. The Naim are Sunnia and of Ghafiri faction. It is the headquarters of the Beni Kaab tribe, Sunnis by reli gion and ^ Ghafiri in politics.CHAP. IV.—WATER SUPPLY. 121 CHAPTER IV. (A) Water Supply. 1. General. —The question of water is the most import ant factor that will affect military operations in the arid and waterless area with which this Report deals. The following points should be noted: — (a) The extent of water available varies in summer and winter. j • r. i (b) There is no river in the whole area, and with the exception of the mountainous interior of Oman, the oasis of Qatif, Hasa, and on the islands of Bahrein and Tarut, there are no springs or streams. Water, therefore, is generally obtained from wells, many of which are brackish. (c) Winter is the rainy season. During the months December, January and February, the supply of water in the wells and springs is replenished and the quality improved. During summer the length of time that wells continue to yield good water is dependent on the extent of rainfall in winter. 2. Buhterranmn Water. —It is generally accepted that the subterranean water supply of wells in the Kuwait, Qatif, Hasa, and Bahrein areas has its source in the region round Jebel Tuwaiq in Central Arabia (Nejd) though some believe it comes under the Persian Gulf from Persia. The rainfall in the region of Jebel Tuwaiq will therefore also affect the subterranean supply of wells in these areas. The tables in Chapter II show the normal state of the water supply in the different areas, but owing to the reasons given above the information can only be approximate. In every case it would be safer to depend on local and up-to- date information as to the state of the water supply in areas where operations are under consideration. 3. Kuwait. —This area is almost entirely desert. There is no running water in the whole territory only numberless shallow wells. In winter, water collects after rain, in hollows and remains for several months. Wells in many cases fill and overflow. In summer, water is confined to the wells. Many of these are brackish. Wells, sweet in spring, may become brackish towards the end of summer, and frequently dry up. e 2/ / &amp; CHAP. TV.—RESOURCES. (B) RESOURCES. Kuwait. I. General. —Agriculture in this principality is almost entirely confined to the village of Jahra and, to an increas ing extent, to the Qusur villages south-east of Kuwait. The products however are insignificant, consisting only of a limited supply of vegetables, and a little ^rne a Jahra. All other supplies have to he augmented fro abroad principally Basrah and the Persian ports Rice is brought from India. Wheat, barley and bhoosa from Per- 2 ^Fuel. —Firewood from Indin. Camel dung (jella) is used as fuel by the very poor to supplement the supply ot brushwood which comes in from the surrounding desert. In summer a force landing in Kuwait could not depend on any local supplies. In winter, however, about 2,000 sheep should be available per week. 3 Boat buildinci.—lt is claimed for Kuwait that the finest boats in the Gulf are built there. They are almost entirely of the Bum or ' Sambuq ' type with pointed and square sterns respectively, and vary in capacity trom 50—300 tons. . 4. Transport. —(a) Camels in any quantity are not avail able on hire, but their owners would sell them. The camels are usually scattered in the desert grazing and only the owners could collect them. (b) A limited supply of donkeys (about 200) could be obtained on hire from Kuwait and Jahra. (c) For boats and shipping available see Appendix II. (d) There are 52 ' Taxis ' in Kuwait and as Motor cars can move everywhere in the desert, a force operating in the hinterland will no doubt find these preferable to camels. Bahrein. 1. General. —The supplies locally obtainable in Bahrein are limited to dates and lucerne in ample quantities and a limited supply of vegetables. For the rest, all other commodities are imported, ana a force landing in Bahrein would be entirely dependent for its supplies on an overseas base. 2. Crops.- —Lucerne is the only crop. It is widely culti vated.! 3. Vegetahles. —Small quantities of vegetables and fruits are obtainable.124 chap. iv. resources. 4 Animals.—There are about 500 heads of cattle of a for milk d 0n the Island - These are kept Sheep are imported from Persian ports and from Kuwait and Hasa, 5. Fuel.—-Fuel (wood) is brought from India and from the smaller Persian ports. There is no grazing for either camels or horses. 6. Effect of migrations on local resources. —The influx of divers m April and May for the pearl diving season causes scarcity and high prices. 7. Bazaar. The bazaar consists of 500 shops well stock ed with imported goods. There are two shops which stock European groceries. The market is a large one and well supplied. 8. Transport. —There are about 200 cars and light lor ries on the Island. Motor launches number 47. • i bl f donkeys of the fam ous Hasa breed stand- ^ ° d hands exist in lar ge numbers. They are obtainable at Manama and from the villages on the islands. Manama 2oo Vi,Ia 2 es ' 1,400 Total . 1 600 1 J There are about 30 donkey carts in Manama. They are 2-wheeled carts drawn by a single donkey. Their capacitv is 4 maunds. ^ ^ For boats and shipping see Appendix II. Hasa, Qatar and Trucial. Oman. 1. General. —A Field Force landing in these areas could not rely on local resources for any supplies whatever with the exception of a small quantity of fuel. For boats and shipping available see Appendix II.CHAP. IV.—RESOURCES. 1^5 Oman. 1. General. —The local resources in Oman are, for prac tical purposes, negligible. The country is barren in the extreme and except for dates and fuel, both of which are largely exported, produces nothing. The aridity or t e soil except in a few places in the Batinah, and ttiere m mere patches, will not support the growth of cereals. These are imported from India, in quantities sufficient on iy ' or the needs of the population. A force landing m Oman would therefore be dependent for all supplies, except fuel, on an overseas base. 2. Vegetables. —^Vegetables are grown in quantities sufficient for local consumption at Ruwi near Matrah, but the supply of vegetables at other places is negligible. A limited quantity is available at Kurayat, Sur, Sib, and Sohar, in which'places cultivation could be extended. Ruwi supplies vegetables for the markets of Matrah and Muscat and as, it has a large water supply the cultivation of vege tables could be extended. The undermentioned vegetables are obtainable at Matrah and Muscat. Brinjal, broad beans, pumpkin, cucumber, water melon, melon. 3. Fuel. —The main source of supply of fuel is the Batinah coast. Wood is exported from here to the Trucial Coast and to Persian ports. The acacia bush called ' sumr ' grows everywhere and is used as fuel. 4. Grazing. —There is no grazing for horses. Small quantities of lucerne are obtainable at Ruwi, Sur, and Kuryat,- Camel grazing is to be found in most parts of the country. 5. Cattle.—There are no supplies of cattle. The few heads there are, are used for drawing water from wells, and are chiefly to be seen along the Batinah. Goats are fairly plentiful: the local supply being supplemented by imports from the Makran coast. 6. Transport. —For boats and shipping available see Appendix III.CHAP. V. ARMED FORCES KUWAIT. CHAPTEE V. ARMED FORCES. Kuwait. nf kJ^Sl er Ci'~~ e A J ahnla ^ ed staternent of the Armed Forces ot the Sheikh of Kuwait is given below: The policy was laid down in 1929 that the Royal Air Force based on Iraq, would come to the assistance of Kuwait if she were in danger of serious attack by strong organized forces from Nejd- but that for dealing with ordinary raids, large or small, and for patrolling her frontier, she would have to depend on her own resources. For this purpose it was decided that a small highly mobile force of armed Ford cars would be the only satii factory method of dealing with the problem. The Sheikh was advised: — (a) to purchase 12 Ford Vanettes and arm them with Lewis Guns, (b) to purchase 2 complete Field Wireless Transport bets and mount them on lorries, (c) to engage a British Officer or Non-commissioned Umcer to organize the above force, (d) to send 3 Lewis Gun teams to Basra for a course of training. The State finances (May 1932) have permitted the pur chase of 5 \ anettes and 1 lorry only complete with 6 Lewis Uuns. One Lewis Gun team has been trained by the Royal A it *orce ; and there exist as spare one Vickers and one Lewis Gun. The complete scheme is being introduced as finances permit. 2. The Fidawiyah or paid mercenaries The role of the Fidawiyah is primarily to protect the Sheikh's property, his camels sheep, horses, etc., but they could be counted on to repel any fairly strong raid. They are paid and armed, and are under the orders of their Amir. (Haif bin Hasan) working under the direction of Sheikh Abdulla bin Jabir al ba bah, the latter acts as commander-in-chief of the Kuwait h orces. The Fidawiyah number some 350 men.CHAP. V.—ARMED FORCES—KUWAIT. 127 3. Araihdar (Tribes owing allegiance to the Shaikh).— These are made up of those loose Bedouin elements whose interests directly connect them with Kuwait. In summer many of them join the pearling fleets as divers. They can muster 1,000 rifles approximately. 4. Town defence force. —This is recruited from the able bodied townsmen of Kuwait. Their duties are confined to the actual defence of the town. They are in possession of rifles. Each quarter of the town is responsible for sup plying a fixed number of armed men. The Sheikh of Kuwait holds a reserve of 4,000 rifles (British and Mauser) and 350,000 rounds (British and Mauser). Total numbers available in an emergency 4,000/5,000.The Armed Forces of Kuwait.

It is probable that these Indian ranks will be replaced shortly by local men. (&amp;) 151 Arab police armed with long -303 rifles. Of the local tribes approximately one man in three possesses a rifle—Their fighting value is negligible. Details of posts is given in the attached table.CHA1 ,, v. —ARMED FORCES—SEJD. 133 3 Numbers. —The number of men ^ ^ tained in the field depends, water ' and in winter on supplies other than water. Operations may be considered under the headings of Kaids and Protracted Campaigns, Tn the former in winter, the maximum available man newer !an put in the field - but in the latter the numbers will be considerably reduced owing to difficulties of supply. Other factors affecting the number of men in the field are; — (a) Hereditary feuds between tribes which necessitate a considerable portion of the tribal fighting forces being left to protect the home camps, herds, and grazing, (b) The Arab dislike, to leaving his family for any considerable period. This would cause many to leave the field and return home. 4. Fighting Characteristics. —When they attack, the Akhwan usually dismount from their camels and horses, at some distance from the enemy, and then advance on toot in several lines. Their principle is to move swiftly and secretly to the objective and then attack on foot. A regular reserve is always maintained in rear of an attacking force. Such manoeuvres as dawn, night, flank and rear attacks are well understood and regularly practised. Personal bravery, and fearlessness of death, are the characteristics of the ' Akhwan Trucial Oman. 1. The armed forces of the Trucial Sheikhs consist of the personal escorts kept by each Sheikh. These bodies of men are paid and armed with modern rifles by the Sheikh. They wear no uniform.134 CHAP. V. -AKMED iOECES OMAN.

Nejd Air Force—The only ruler in the area covered by this report, who is in possession of an Air Force, is Ibn Sand. His Air Force consists of four Wapitis (Jupiter 450 h. p. engines). There are about three trained pilots and five mechanics. The Air Force is at Jeddah, to which place it was transferred from Qatif in 1930, flying via Baghdad and Amman, 2. General. —From an aviation point of view the area covered by this report is of importance chiefly as it con tains the air route from Basrah via Bahrein— Sharjah, etc., to India. 3. Civil Air Boutes.—The following civil air route is m operation by Imperial Airways Limited: Basra (night stop)— Bahrein—Sharjah (night stop) Gwadur and thence to Karachi. 4. Climatic conditions—It can be safely assumed that the Persian Gulf is suitable for flying all the year round. Strong winds and dust storms are encountered periodically^ particularly during the 40 days Shamal in June and July,- but do not render air navigation impossible. 5.

Kuwait. 1 Civil Administration.—The principality is an in dependent Arab State, under British protection, but is not a British Protectorate. The present Sheikh is Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir al- Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.T.. who succeeded his uncle Sheikh Salim in 1921. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh assisted, in theory, by an elected council of Advisers (two from the Subah or reigning family, four from the inhabi tants, elected for one year). The Council though duly elected has never met. The rule of the Sheikh is personal and autocratic. 2 British Influence.—B-is Majesty's Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Agent, an appointment created in 1904. Ihe 1 olitical Agent is directly responsible to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf. He is not a consul. He exercises the powers of District Magistrate and Sessions Judge subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident, he also exer cises jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons of foreign States other than Muslim Governments. Control of the internal administration and affairs^ of Koweit are vested in the Government of India, but questions of foreign policy, especially questions affecting relations with Ibn Saud are dealt with by the Colonial office in consultation with the Foreign office and India otnce. Bahrein. 1 Civil Adm, inistra tion. —Sheikh Sir Isabin Ah al- Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., now a very 0 ^ oo man ' lieved of control of the administration m 1923, and though he remains titular Sheikh of the Islands, his eldest survi ving son Sheikh Hamedbin Isa, C.S.I., has taken over the administration as the fully empowered agent of his father The principalitv is an independent Arab State under the protection of His Majesty's Government, but not a British Protectorate.CHAP.

Ibu Sand, though precluded by treaty from attacking Qatar interferes from time to time through his Amir at Hasa and there is little doubt that the Shaikli pays him a handsome sum yearly so as to be on the safe side. Qatar is under the political control of the Political A (rent at Bahrein, but unlike Bahrein the Political A^eno has no judicial powers there over Persians, (there are no British subjects at Qatar) but whenever the Political A went has intervened in any special case the bhaikh has so' far met his wishes. Both Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Ja?im and his very influential secretary Saleh-bin-Mana are reasonable and surprisingly well informed. Trucial Oman. 1. General. —The Trucial Chiefs are so called on account of the treaties of maritime truce concluded by them bet ween 1820 and 1853 with His Majesty's Government under , which a check was imposed on their feuds and their piratical and slaving activities in the Gulf. 2. Administration. —The Trucial States are tribal piiu- cipalities governed by independent Arab Sheikhs. The Trucial Treaties accord to the contracting parties the light to accredit a representative on the one side at the head quarters of the several Sheikhs, and on the other at the British Residency at Bushire. But in practice the Chiefs have no representatives and His Majesty's Government aie represented only by an Arab Agent of the Pesidency who is stationed at Sharjah and moves from place to place as required. His summer quarters are at Ras-al-Khaimah. 3. British Zn/Zuence.— Responsibility for the political control of the States rests with the Government of India, subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty s Govern ment. His Majesty's Government by their treaty engagements control the foreign relations of the Trucial Chiefs, to horn in addition they have promised either directly or by impli cation a degree of protection which it is difficult precisely to define.146 CHAP.

Currency, Weights and Measures. A.—KUWAIT. 1. Currency. —The Indian Rupee has been the currency since 1911 when it replaced the Maria Theresa Dollar or Riyal. The latter however is still largely used and of necessity in all trajisactions with the Bedouin of the interior. The Rupee—Riyal exchange for May 1930 stood at 85* Riyals to 100 rupees. This is liable to considerable fluctuation. 2. Weights. —The ordinary unit of weight is the waqiyah of which there are 3 kinds, viz., one of 4 lbs. 10-22 oz., another of 4 lbs. 15*168 oz., and a third of 9 lbs. 4-44 oz. being respectively the weight of 75, 80, and 150 Maria Theresa Dollars (Riyals) on which coin the Waqiyah is based. The Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 15-168 oz., is used by the local customs for imports from the desert only. The Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10-22 oz., is in general use by the customs and in the bazar except in the sale of fish for which alone the double Waqiyah of 9 lbs. 4-44 oz. is used. A larger measure is the ' Mann ' of which there are 9 distinct varieties, all based on the Waqiyab of 4 lbs. 10-22 oz., and used for different commodities; — (1) For weighing goods for customs assessment, and in bazaar for all goods for which there is not a special measure. (2) For wheat, barley, Iraq rice and firewood, ghee and fat, the mann of 30 Waqiyahs or 139 lbs. 2*6 oz. (3) For sail cloth only. The mann of 12 Waqiyahs or 55 lbs. 10-64 oz. (4) For salt, juss (gypsum). The mann of 24 Waqiyahs or 111 lbs, 5*28 oz. &lt;'5) For sugar only. The mann of 48 waqiyahs or 222 lbs., 10-56 oz. The term ' kis ' (bag) is now commonly ussd for this particular mann. iff184 appx. t. bahrein. (6) For wheat and barley imported from Basrah, The mann of 36 waqiyahs or 166 lbs., 15 , 92 oz. known as the ' main Basri '. 1 Kuwait Tagar = 20 manns Basri (of 36 waqiyahs) or 3,340 lbs. Firewood is normally sold by the Rata' of 4 manns of 30 waqiyahs or 556 lbs., 10 - 4 oz. Juss (gypsum) is sold by the Kara of 100 manns of 24 waqiyahs or 11,133 lbs. The Kara is also used for the sale of date palm branches (used for hutting) in which sense it equals 25 branches. Kuwait stone is sold by the Tishalah or lighter load, averaging 150 cubic feet. The 4 gallon kerosine and petrol tin is used as a measure of capacity principally for the sale of water, but ghee, fab, and ' dibs ' or date syrup, are also sometimes sold by the tin. The price of a tin of water is 2 annas. 3. Measures. —The unit of length is the Dhra' or cubit of 18 inches. The war, or 'yard, is also used. Tt is used for cotton and woollen goods and for some kinds of plank ing. Also used for measuring masonry work. For beams and masts; 1 Calicut Kandy = 10 cubic feet 29 cubic inches. For round rafters (bullies) or spars; 1 Korjah = l score. For boat ribs; 1 Gari or cartload of 40 pieces. Rope is normally sold by the Ba' or fathom, the full span of the arms. There is no square measure in use; a plot of ground is described as being so many Dhra' according to the sum of its sides. B.—BAHREIN. 1. Currency. —The Indian rupee is the currency of Bahrein. Pearl divers are sometimes paid in the Riyal (or Maria Theresa dollar) and also in Turkish gold liras or £ sterling. The general term in use for 'money' in Bahrein, is ' flus though ' gawazi ' is sometimes heard. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank at Bahrein, and all classes of business are transacted.186 APPX. I. I1ASA, ^T? ere ^ 0re a 7 essel have capacity of 200 gallas ' would in English terms have a capacitv of 1 of 200 i.e., 10 tons. ^ 0i 2^ 3. Measures— (a) 1 dhra (standard of measure) equal to 18 ins. 2 dhras equal to 1 war or yard. 2 yards or from tip to tip of the outstretched arms equal 1 ba' or fathom. Also used— 1 shibr {i.e., span) approx. equal to 9 ins. 2 shibrs equal to 1 dhra. (b) Distances by road are described in farasakhs (farasakh—3 miles) but more commonly in hours (sa'at). (c) Among date cultivators a rather loose measure of time is in use called Wadha. It serves to denote the period during which a cultivator may use all the flow from a common spring. The ' wadha ' is the space of 12 daylight hours, and is divided into | wadha % wadha i wadha, etc. (d) At sea, watches called ' zam ' (pi., ' zawam ') are used. A ' zam ' is a four hour watch. The first watch is that from sunset (Arabic 12 o'clock) to 4 o'clock (Arabic). When coast ing in sight of land the ' zam ' is 12 farsakhs = 36 miles (calculated by distance bet ween landmarks). C.—HASA. 1. Currency. In the Hasa ports the riyal and the ! ml 1 gol(i lira are current but the Rupee is also accept ed. The Government of Ibn Saud has now standardised the riyal at 40 qirsh or 160 tawilahs. Qirsh are minted in coins of: — 1 qirsh minted 4 tawilahs. i qirsh minted 2 tawilahs./ / APPX, I. OMAN. 187 i qirsh minted 1 tawilahs. The tawilah of Hasa, a brass piece shaped somewhat like a nail and equivalent tq J anna or 2 hezas, is dropping out of the currency, but is still used in computation. The Muscat beza is now found in use in Qatif and Jubail only. 2. Weights— (а) 1 ruba equal to (weight of) 12 dollars (riyals). 32 rubas equal to 1 qiyasa. 6 qiyasa or pi. qiyis equal to ^ mann. 24 qiyasa equal to 1 mann. (б) The following weights are used exclusively for rice and wheat grown in Ilasa; — 1 mosumiya rice in husk equal to 10 qiyis. 1 mosumiya wheat equal to 12 qiyasa. 3. Measures. —As for Bahrein. D.—TRUCTAL OMAN. The currency, weights and measures of the States of Trucial Oman approximate those of their neighbours. E.—OMAN. 1. Currency. —The currency of the country is predo minantly the silver Maria Theresa dollar called ' riyal ' and the Muscat copper coin called ' beza ' (a corruption of 'the Indian word ' paisa '). The principal silver coin in use in Muscat and Matrah is the Rupee which would also be accepted in all places along the Batinah and now-a-days in most places inland. The generic term in common use for money is ' gawazi plural of ' gazi originally a Persian copper coin no longer in general use but which still circulates in Ja'alan. The value of the dollar fluctuates according to fluctua tions in the price of silver, and that of the Rupee accord ing to the requirements of local merchants. The table given below shows the fluctuations in the rate of exchange/ APPX. I. OMAN, 189 2. Weights.—The weights given below are those autho rised by the Sultan's Customs, and in general use in the bazaars. The metric system is not used. (a) 1 kiyas = 6 dollars, or 5-9375 oz. 24 kiyas=r 1 muscat mann or 9 lbs. 3 manns = l deli mann (28 lbs.) or 'dast'. Specially used for sugar. 10 manns = l farasilah. 200 manns = l bahr. {N ote .—Kiyas are sub-divided into half, quarter, and eights of a Kiyas; and the Mann is divid ed into half and quarter manns). (&amp;) The ' farasilah ' is used exclusively for weighing dates. The dates are packed in reed baskets of 1, li, and 2 farasilahs. The ' bahr ' is also used only for dates in Muscat and Matrah. (c) There is a ' bahr ' of 400 manns used for weighing wood fuel in Muscat and Matrah; and for weighing salt in all places. (d) For rice, grain, sugar, and commodities sold by the sack, the ' gonia ' (pi. gowani) is used. 1 gonia = 160 lbs. (locally). 15 gonias = l ton (approximately). (N ote.- —1 gonia of flour) = 196 lbs. (c) The ' palli ' and ' farah ' (wooden bowls) are sometimes used in Muscat and Matrah for measuring cereals in small quantities. 40 pallis = l farah. 20 farahs = l khondi. &lt;/) In addition to the above there are local weights for fuel in the Batineh, the chief source of supply. They are very approximate. 1 waznah = 45 manns, or the approximate weight of three men, 10 waznah = l murr or 450 mann, 4 mur = l kara or about 1800 mann. These weights undergo some variation in Sohar where—APPX. II. LANDING FACILITIES KUWAIT. 191 APPENDIX II. Landing: facilities—Maritime. A.—KUWAIT. There are no modern landing facilities at Kuwait. Ships anchor one to two miles off the town, and discharge into local craft. Landing at low tide is inconvenient as the beach dries out to a considerable distance. In front of the town there are several tidal harbours called ' niq'ah ' formed by breakwaters of loose coral rock. Any high wind will interfere with landing operations. The best place for landing troops is Bandar-esh-Shuwaikh, a narrow basin about two miles west of the town, formed by the mainland and islet of Qrain. Here there is a deep sheltered channel, where native craft may anchor in three to four fathoms of water within fifty yards of the shore. Numerous sailing boats are available for landing troops and animals, but it would be necessary to construct some sort of a jetty or ramp for the landing of guns and M. T. vehicles. Lighters could best be used for landing purposes. There is however a masonery ramp, running into deep water and originally built by the navy. This ramp could be utilised for the construction of a jetty. Beaching is simple and easy at this point. The fore-shore is sandy, but would not seriously hamper movement. Place. I Method of landing.
