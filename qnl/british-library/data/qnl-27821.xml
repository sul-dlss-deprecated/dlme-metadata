The original title chosen by the Sherif himself, when he first assumed the style of royalty in October, 1916, was 'King of the Arab nation'. The India Office observed (letter of 4th November, 1916) that this title, being national not territorial, 'would 'not necessarily exclude the idea of the local autonomy 'of other Arab Chiefs'. But the formula evoked criticism in various quarters, and a number of alternatives were suggested. Colonel Wilson, after personal discussion with Husain and his son Abdulla, suggested 'His Majesty the Sherif'; Sir R. Wingate (then Sirdar, not High Commissioner) preferred 'King of the Arabs in Hejaz'. The French Government proposed 'Malik-el-Haramein' (King of the Holy places), considering that any such title as 'King of the Arabs' or 'of Arabia' might prove inconveniently wide. Sir H. MacMahon suggested 'King of the Hejaz'. The Government of India took strong objection to the French suggestion, and were disposed to favour 'King of the Arabs in the 'Hejaz and its dependencies', which they considered would be inoffensive to other Arab Chiefs. Sir P. Cox, then at Baghdad, recommended, as a combined temporal and spiritual&amp; spiritual title i rr . (Sultan of tl P n .

I fully appreciate objections that have always been taken on your side to this title, and I do not like it myself. But change of title will, it is thought, not involve change of status vis &amp; vis of other Arab Chiefs which will remain what Husain can make it, and though it is not part of our policy to force any Chief or tribe to submit to him, some modus vivendi must eventually be arrived at between them all unless Arabia is to be scene of perpetual fighting and security of Holy Places possibly threatened, odium of which would fall onI should like you therefore to take the broadest possible view of the question and advise me with least possible delay as to probable effect of recognition on Bin Baud and throughout Mesopotamia, and as to any measures that could be taken to make it palatable**.

Jeddah, November 5th, Sir, I have the honour to forward the following papers for Your Excellency’s information; 1. Notes on the telephone conversation with the She ri f and j'lsir Abdulla concerning his proclamation as King of the Arabs, repeated in my telegram Mo. 465 and Tio. 4®?, (these were taken down in writing by Hussein Sffendl Buhi at the Mme). 2. Letter from Sherif to myself confirming the above conversations (original attached;. 3. Two letters from IM 8AUB to mir Abdulla and one from « leading notable of Yemen to the Sherif. (Originals enclosed) .(I asked sherif to allow .me to send originals to Your Excellency to which he agreed, but wishes to have them bank again as soon as possible.) 4. Copy of a note on the Military Situation as it appears to me which 1 forwarded to His Excellency the Sirdar together with a copy of Colonel Br4mond’s se cond note to me. 5. Copy of a letter I sent to Colonel Parker. 9~ t 6. Copy of a letter addressed to me by His Excellency the Sirdar dated 4th November, forwarding copy of a letter to the Sherif from Smlr Faisal, etc. As I stated in my telegram lo. 473 of November 3rd, I, personally, consider that the action of the Sherif in proclaiming himself a King ©ill do good as far^ clr as He&amp;jaz outside thn Hedja^ goes; regarding prominent chiefs , the hherif has no fear of Ibn any exception to his action. the j letters I enclose certainly show the former to be on 1 Most friendly terms. j I8W HASHIB is to be blotted out of existence and I | sath(,r Wiat ' the IDKXSSI is to take what action he likes i in the matter, he is regarded as an upstart. In my above quoted telegram I recommended that a qualified approval be given because I considered it possible that considerable objection might be taken to the Sheriffs action and title of » King of the Arabs ” by the Indian Government and others. I therefore en deavoured to suggest a middle course in order to pre vent a refusal on the part of His Majesty’s Govern ment to give any recognition. Personally I feel confident that the title sounds | more than in fact it really is or is intended by the Cherif to be; he has no idea of attempting to enforce { sovereign rights over IBS CAUD, the XMISSI, the IMAM, st*. i By his proclamation, he has made himself the temporal ruler of an independent Hedjaz and thus hopes to cut I away the ground from under the feet of those who say he is doing ham to the Holy Land and giving his coun try to the British.• I, personally, as in favour of His Majesty’s Go vernment giving the Sharif the fullest official recog nition that may be found possible. I suggested in my telegram that reference should be made to the Caliphate, which the ; herif has so de finitely declared he does not claim, because there is a feesfear - poseitoly alight - that the Mr Abdulla, who is the ’HB.ii behind the throne'’ my, in an evil moment persuade the iherif to declare himself Caliph of Islam. You* occelloncy’s very urgent telegram of the 4th instant was only received by me this afternoon, I went to see Colonel Srfeond but, as reported in my 495, he considers he should await instructions from his own Government, on receipt of which he would send a similar message to mine. Colonel Brfeond informs me that on the lioftamedan New Year’s day, the Sherif sent a messenger to the French Moslem officers asking them to come to the Palace, the latterv.ent and found the Ministers and Ho tables all collected; the ShettE El Islam read a long address (fre quently corrected by Bnlr Abdulla Who had no copy in his hand and knew it by heart which probably indicates him as the author} in very classical i rablc with a Syrian accent, no word of which the French officers understood, afterwards everybody cheered and congratu lated the Sberlf. The French officers, thinking they had congra tulated the Sherif on the hew fear, left the alace knowing nothing of what had occurred until a few hours afterwards, when they found that the talk of the Town was that they had congratulated the fberlf on becoming King In the name of the French Republic, Lieut, colonel Cadi hsn now gone to bed with 'fever until the decision of the French Covernnent as to recognition Is received. The somewhat move was doubtless evolved in the fertile brain of 3nir Abdulla but it has &amp; ludicrous^ Bide to it* VSu Hie i, herif informed twice is tlie last two &lt;5ays that be is really coming to Jeddah soon to see roe and I think he probably will. I suggest to Your '-bccellency that it would be advantageous if Mr fterra, C.s.Q,, was present when the Eherif comes, as he will be eebtaln to talk a good deal about previous coremBioatloPS which passed between Your Excellency and himself, of which Mr. Starrs probably has full knowledge. I have asked the Sherif to give me a full week’s notice and expect him to come about the 17th instant. I will wire as soon as I hear anything de finite, if anything can be definite in this extraordi nary country. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient Servant, Lieut. Colonel.

Because His ajesty’s Govern lent was afraid that the Islamic world would suspect it of possessing the holy spot, it caused much delay in sending what was necessary along Military line for the Arab Cause. 2. , Because/His Majesty’s Government was well aware of li|EBAR 8 proclamation, it did not send us all we wanted quickly. 3.

Because the pulpits of MECCA and HEDJAZ have the supremacy over all the pulpits of the world i.e. when they mention any one as the Caliph all people roust recognizes hi®, . 5. Because the jUIEC of MECCA were not originally under the suxerainty of the • arks hut they simply agreed to be under the Turks by themselves and not by war. Therefore the the people here have declared him to be/Xing of the Arabs in order to show that they are not under any other power, as for IBS SAUD he is a Sheikh of Arabs and the Sherlf does not interfere with his work or his land.

That are the reasons for which the Grand Sherif was suddenly proclaimed King of the • rab$$ Cation ? Ans. 1. There is no suddenness in the m ter. It was not sudden as we were negotiating secretly about the matter with 'is Majesty’s Government. T.e were going to inform His majesty’s Government of the independence a«d the 3herif being the King since the first day of the rise as was decided by both sides (parties). His Majesty’s Government and His Excellency the High Commissioner seem to have expected such news to he sent to them officially hut His Majesty the cterif de layed it until now for the purpose of gaining the confi dence of his sole and respectable ,lly in the woi^ Secondlysecondly, for the expiration of the pilgrimage seaHon to gain the satisfaction of the public opinion of the majority of Islam openly. All the above-mentioned matters have taken place actually* praise be to God, with the two parties (England and the Sherif), There is another utility in such declaration which must he noticed and it is that the enemies advertise that the Arab cause or movement is very weak and that the Sherifate has no right of independence and that the Sherif has wasted all the country away. The declaration of the Kingship is giving the actual lie to such rumours and the Allies approval of this matter immediately will be considered as giving the lie to such rumotirs and as a fulfilment of previous decisions and to avoid the suspicion and doubt which our Ally fears on the part of the general thought of Islam, That is, to prove is to the Islamic world that the ITedjaz Government/actually independent and that its ruler is a great Moslem King. With this, the agitation of the people will be calmed and all become satisfied and we also be freed from fluctuation in our movements. His 'iajesty the . ’serif has left the question of Caliphate to the opinion of the Islamic world and there fore he declared that there was no presuggested Caliphate but that all that matter is left to the public opinion of Islam and the Ulima of the tibia (MSCCAj decided not to accept the Turkish Caliphate and all the matter will come back later on to its origin. This is the reply to the question, 0. 2. You did not tell Hi® Excellency Wilson Pasha about this miter as be represents lit Majesty ? s Govern**Government, but you have tele?

There is a letter from His tejesty’s Government in which our lord was addressed as the possessor {- Xing) and he replied that he is satisfied with the Amlrate and Sherifate and this matter does not need further explanation. IBS SAUD, mxsez* etc. are rulers in their places and we would not interfere with thee. They are respected and if anyone were to attack them we have to help them. Our boundaries were settled before the rise and therefore we have no other ambition as terms were eon- that eluded before ths Klr.gdhi of the Sherlf will be up to Iraq* Our respect to this treaty concluded between us and Great Britain forbid us to oopose them and such is well known to you, c, 5 . That is the Eherlf’s side of the question ? Ans. g* The Eherif’s side^ of the question Is that he is the Xing of the *rabs and a religious leader until the Islam will be of one opinion as to the Caliphate. p,. 4. can we consider what you have said now as from the Sherif himself because His Excellency the Pasha wants to1 — ' — h % -5- to Bend to Hir Majesty's Government ?

The people of the country want that matter and they are well aware of their posi tion amongst the people of the world, and thay want to explain to the whole world their intentions and plans in order to avoid suspicion a® to other Amirs and . heikhs of Arabs, etc. I have received none letters from 8U SAUB which I will send to you to read.

I simply said all these thing® to His excellency the -asha In order to let him know them. I gave all my opinions to His Excellency the Igh Commissioner concerning the nosiest opinions and feelings and he understood that this (l.e. declaring himselfto be-2 King}. I’e intend ty such doing to be a matter of pre caution to remove off difficulties they may have. I have denied the Caliphate entirely and officially leaving it to the opinioa of those who know all about its regulations until all Moslems choose one to be their Ca- lipha. Have you understood this point ? We have a book from el Sheikh SL^AB&amp;II a Wahhabi in which it is stated that there is no Caliphate giving all profound proofs in this concern. We shall publish such book if needed. These things Mis bccellency explains them to ills Majesty’s Govertaent. The Letter which Abdulla will dic tate to you now should be considered. I know that falSAL is a friend of His excellency and that his words are accepted, please see what he wants and let him have it under our own expenses. He is well known to His Excellen cy who knows his work, I say that the matter of declaration (of the Kingship} is of our rights. The rise which took place was for it and no hf rra in it.

Therefore and because I ata well aware that His Britannic a.jesty The King and the mm of his Government and his noble nation have built their policy upon the convenience of all people In general and the Moslems in particular, and because I consider it a great fault to avoid this matter, I have com-rainicated my reasons to ills Majesty*8 Government and informed them of the means by which we will be enabled to attain such aims and good desires. Consequently, and as I m well aware of the fame of His Majesty’s Government in keeping it® word and as it has accepted my specified requests, I have begun to deal with the subject with all liberty of word and deed and I am still continuing and will continue the same re solution and action until i see something injurious to such a principle especially against the principles of trustfulness and reliance.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith tot Your Excellency’s information a translation of the telepho nic reply from the Grand iherif to my message of con gratulations on behalf of Kls majesty’s Government oil the occasion of the Eherif’s coronation. I also attach a copy of the letter sent by Lt. Colonel BrSmond on behalf of the French Government to which Colonel Brlmond informs me he received a telephonic reply. Bnir Abdulla informed me two days ago that a telegram couched in some what similar terms to Your Sxeellency’s had been received by the Grand ;herif conveying the conr&amp;efculations of the Russian Govern ment. As stated in my telegram No. T&gt;. 491 of Novem ber 5th Your excellency’s instructions contained in Arab Bureau’s telegram No. 145 of 3rd November arrived the day after the Coronation festivities, i.e on the 5th instant. Had they arrived in time I do not consider I could have attended any ceremony; the mere fact of my doing so would - in the eyes of the people here have given the Sherif’s action that approval and re cognition by His Majesty’s Government it is so desi rable to avoid until a decision has been come to re grading the extent of recognition to be recorded - a decision which I trust will not be long relayed.How far the Sherlf’s belief that, by his declaration of Kingship, the fear said to exist amonsgt certain Mos lem Com •'unities that the Hedjaz will become a British Protectorate will be dissipated I do not know, but that I the action is welcomed by the majority, if not all, of [j the Hedjaz tribes is I think undoubted. The worst feature to my mind is that the Declaration was made without the slightest warning or hint to Ills Majesty’s Government, especially after the advice I understand Mr, ftorrs gave the Smir Abdulla on the latter raising the question during hid recent visit here. As stated in my Despatch Ho, 14 of the 5th Novem ber, I think that the title sounds more than in fact it really is or is Intended by the Sherif to be. Ha cares far more in my opinion about eventually becoming Caliph than for any temporal title; it is probable he thought that by proclaiming himself King he would Increase his claims as a suitable candidate for the Caliphate and consequently chose the grandiose title of 'King of the Arabs' but he is far too clever a man to try and force his position as King on such independent Arab Chiefs as Ibn Saud etc, 5 I am inclined to think that he decided (in i spite of Mr. ftorfs’ warning} to make his Declaration because he realizes the fact that he is an oldish man and his work may at any time cause a serious breakdown a title of and therefor© wished to leave/of independent king* ship to his heir as a stepping stone to the Caliphate which he wishes to be vested in his own familjr and chose thethe MolMwmedan New Year’s day as an auspicious date for the announcement. I feel sure, from various odd telephonic conver sations with the ; Mr Abdulla, that the Sherif did not mean any discourtesy to His Majesty’s Government by not giving previous notece of his proclamation and numerous actions of his tend to confirm this opinion, but there Is no doubt that he expected Instant re cognition. AMUR’S telegram Wo. 1.5. 885 dated 12th July repeats a Cypher telegram from Sherlf Faroki to the Therif in which It Is stated ‘'High Ccwwiiffilonarwill approve the title of King of Arabs' to whlcl/replled (see Artur’s telegram Ho. 1.5.908 dated 16th July) 'I will keep my present title'. It Is possible that this telegram from Faroki caused the Sherif to consider all would be well In spite of the recent advice given by Mr. Storrs C*M.G. and it Is possible that these telegrams are the 'secret negotiations' the Fherlf referred to.

This style is sufficiently, non-committal. I concur that uccgnition by us of the title 'Malik el Haramein' to which (? presumably) would Ye added 'El Sharif ein', would not pave the way to further claims by its possessor of extended territorial or national sovereignty nor does it affect the lights of other chiefs of Arabian peninsula. The title may nevertheless be open to objection on the ground that a religious as distinct from a territorial significance would be given to it# In that case I incline to the opinion that my original suggestion of 'King of the Arabs in Hedjas' as a title would be safer.

A copy of Emir Abdulla’s telegram (original for warded to the Director, Arab Bureau; and my reply. 2. note by Hussein :ffendi Buhi. 3. A copy of the public declaiation read by Sheikh Suleiman Qabil at a mass meeting at the Municipal Offices last night. The telegram of Emir bdulla was a complete any surprise to me. I had not received a hint of/such intention on the part of the Eherif, whose conduct would appear to be all the more astonishing in view of the very strong representation against any such action which Mr.Storrs, C.M.Q., informed me he had made to Emir Abdulla about two weeks ago, while here. I am of oplniom that the Lherif should have had the courtesy at least to consult His Majesty’s Government before proclaiming himself 'Xing of Arabs which I presume h he has not done as I have heard no AS it is, I fear that the Proclamation will be a subject for * part of the HSDJAZ Is still held by the furks. Beyond my reply to Emir Abdulla I have taken as MSBIHA &amp;nd &amp; Isxgfc Beyond my nono notice of the Sherlf’e action and have not attended any of the official functions, etc. Hearing that SHMIF MOHSKW IBM MAMCUR had publicly announced that the Sherif had received congratulations and messages,approving his action, from the ailed Governments and also some Neutral countries, I have in structed ruhi :f fendi to ask Sharif MOHSEM to confirm til 6 this by telephone. I heard/reply which was to the above effect. This entirely false information and the sending of a stereotype form of a congratulatory telegram to be used, gives some idea of the methods employed. Sub Inspector SHAIK of the Bombay Police is appre hensive of the effect in India of the Sheriffs action more particularly the reference to the Caliphate and fears that the Sherlf in the near future may declare . | himself the Caliph of Islam, a fear not altogether un- 1 justifiable, as, after the Oherif’s present action ] without any reference to His Jajesty's Government, he j appears capable of any stupidity. I sending All Bszani and Inspector SHAIK to Mecca to-morrow. k telegram was received from Mecca yesterday by Sherif MOHSEN stating that all notables and mer chants of Jeddah should be in Mecca by the 3rd November as the ’’Coronation' will be on the 4th or 5th.

The accession of the Grand Sharif of Mecca Hussein Ibn All to the throne of the supposed new Arabian Empire tooK place on Sunday 2nd Moharram, 1336 (29.x.16) at about 11 o’clock a.m. when all the Diem of Mecca and Its notables etc, assembled in the Sherif’s house and named and recognized him the King of the Arabs and the reli gious head (a step towards the Caliphate ). Amir Abdulla sent telegram in his own name stating the facts and gave orders that several copies of it should be made and distributed amongst the notables of Jeddah and no sooner was this order given than it was carried out. Abdulla made his tools here (like Couliman Qabil, fttstapha Sffendi the Muawin, Sherif Mahsin, Mohammed 1 Tawil director of Customsjand other Sheikhs Harahs spread rumours that the Grand : herif had received telegrams from the following powers: England, France, Russia, Italy and all Feutral countries approving his action and ack nowledging him to be the King of the Arab nation and the great religious leader etc., etc. and that some have congratulated him. He also told them to keep a record of the names of those who decorated their houses, shpps, etc. In honour of the event. Abdulla also dictated to Souliman Qabll by tele phone a telegram that all merchants and notables of Jeddah must send to the )herif at once. The telegram To reads as follows:To rlls Majesty the possessor of power, greatness and respect, our grand King the most honoured Sherif, may God assist his kingdom with glory, victory, and strength. Let the Islamic Nation In general and the Arab Nation in particular rejoice and be glorified by the exal tation of its glory and by being honoured hy the privi- Lftdges which God hath assigned at which the throne of Islam has rejoiced and by acknowledging His lajesty our Grand Aing also to express our dutiful congratulation, I kiss your noble feet and acknowledge my special adherence to the Majesty of your Grand Kingship. Your slave. Abdulla also gave orders to tbe telegraph office not to accept telegrams of congratulation which were not sent in the above mentioned form. There was only one person who congratulated the Sherif by the following telegram after a long talk with the Director of Telegraphs: It is as follows:- His Majesty the Great Master our Lord the King of the Arab Nation, may God help him! I congratulate the Arab Nation and myself for the restoration of its glory and the attainment of its right, hy recognising Your Majesty according to the Noble Islamic Law, I beg the Supreme God to assist Your Lordship oy His everlasting help, and cause the rejoicing of trie Islamic nation eternally. Our Grand lias ter, Your humble servant Mohammed Nasif* NearlyNearly all the great merchants have decorated their houses and exchanged visits. Sherif Muhsin besides deco rating his house with a few lanterns and candles, has stayed at the Sovernment House receiving people who came to congratulate him and to express their good feelings. The other who form the Committee for receiving the visi tors with Sherif Juhsin were Mustapha Fahmi, the Muawin, Sherif Taha Ibn Mohanna, Sheikh Souliman Qabil and Mo hammed Bur Jukhdar, the chief mutawif of the Javanese. They stayed in the Government House till 9.30 pm and then Sherif Muhsin, Sherif Taha ibn Mohanna and sheikh Souliman sabil mounted their horses, followed by a number of Arab police and went to the houses of the merchants and notables who joined in the decorations. The people of note who have decorated their houses are: 1. Mohammed effendi Nasif 2. Sheikh Souliman Qabil 3. Sherif Taha Ibn Mohanna 4. Mohammed Ali Lari (the Persian Consul) 5. Abdulla Pasha Banagi (Minister of Finance) 6 . El-Hazzazi (the son of the man whose house was raid ed three days after Jeddah was opened) 7. Sheikh Hamza Jalal, the chief Motawif for the Indians 8 . Sheikh Omar Bajnaid of Hadramut; Yamen. It seems that the people in Jeddah are not pleased with the Sherif declaring himself King. It is decided that the celebration of the access ion*•*4—« accession will remain for three days, on Monday night l the will receive congratulations. Sherif luhsin was asked whether it was true that all the European Powers have sent telegrams to the Sherif recognizing him as the King of the Arabs. He replied ” Ye8i a11 the Powers ha ve sent telegrams and approved of Pis Majesty's being the King To-day i.-'onday at 1,30 p.m. a fnan was crying in the streets saying: •&gt; o people of the town! 0 notables! 0 GovernorsI please come and honour us in the Baladieh to-night, that you my hear the circular and the most pleasing news of His Majesty the King of the Arabs our Lord.

With reference to your telegram Mo. 18 of November 20th to me. I have had private letters from colonel Wilson and have also had an opportunity of discussing Hedjaz situation with an Influential and intelligent native of the Soudan who Was sent to Mecca as a delegate by Sir Said All el Murghani. I gather from both the above sources of information that one of the Shereef's principal objects in declaring himself independent King Was to counteract propaganda sediSlously intro duced by C.U.P. leaders that Shereef had practically sold Hedjaz to the British and that he was nothing more than the dupe of the British Government. Shereef admitted privately that this information was to seme extent credited by some of his own loyal tribes. The information Lawrence gave me when in Khartoum is no doubt of the same origin and he is probably quite correct in warning us of the danger He&amp;iaz;. I also concur to place bexore xoux . far as I am able to g confirmed by informat of landing Christian troops in any large numbers in Hedjaz. I also concur in this view, but desire again to place before Your Lordship the true situation as far as I am able to gauge it and which is now fully confirmed by information received from colonel Wilsonds Wilson at Jeddah, Colonel Parker at Habegh and ty Sir Said’s delegate who has just returned and who was admitted to closest confidence of Shereef and hi son Avdalla* 1. Shereef can he trusted as loyal to Arab cause and to Allies: he has definitely turned his boats with C. Ih P* 2* The Arabs hate the Turks and are really keen to see the triumph of Shereef’s cause but they are very open to anti-Christian propaganda. Rather than fall under Christian yoke, with which the c.thp. propaganda threaten them, they would prefer to re main under Turkish domination with all its tyranny, oppression and misgoverment. Therefore the more the Allies can publicly proclaim their territorial dis interestedness in I-iedjaz end the more they can support the Shereef's claims of independent Kingship, tne more likely is Shereef to gain the solid adherence ox tribes and defeat the ends of the C.luP* V 'P- 0 “ r0 worlc ^ ns incessantly from Medina to undermine his cause. in phis connection I have gathered the impression that our views and those of the French are slightly divergent on one point. We should welcome ^cap ture of Medina by Shereef whereas the French, in view of their future Syrian policy, seem to regard „iPn some alarm the great acquisition to its str ng which Shereef's cause would inmeaiaoely ocoexn by , f -in Arab tribes in the Syrian active support of all ^ + n -h in Shereef’s x av our hinterlxjid who have sworn immediately Medina is in his hands. 3.• * u “ e we liave now of assisting Shore of wiuh war stores, supplies raoney, instruct ors to train his levies, airships ^., is quite sound and is having an excellent effect - the presence of CliristicUi technical staff etc seems to 'be under - stood and is warmly welcomed* Even the most fanatic^ al of the Shereef ! s adherents realises that it is only by such moans they can fight against well aimed Turkish regulars with erny chance of success* 4* None of the above facts has been absent from my mind when making my recommendations on the policy to be adopted, nor have Lawrence’s views modified the carefully considered plans elaborated in my telegram No. 9 of November 7th to your Lordship, which was drafted and concurred in by both Lawrence and Admiral Wemyss when they discussed matters with me in Khartoum* 5. To avoid any misunderstanding I will again repeat these views as briefly as possible. (a) It is of vital importance to British Empire and to the Allies that Shcreef's cause should not Toe allowed to fail. (b) The military and naval action and support given to the Shereef hitherto have had the effect of considerably consolidating his position. (c) The present policy of not landing any large bodies of Christian tro'vps, English or French, at Rabegh is sound: but more mobile artillery is required. This the French can supply but their l^cal represen tatlve colonel Br emend, id opposed to sending them tc RabeghBa£ogh with cruet an infantry supporting force of practically a brigade, (d) The strategical importance of holding Babegh and making it an organizing base for Shereef's trained bands is obvious and already some progress on these lines is being made; but the impossibility of holding it without the support of a British or French- . brigade, in face of a determined advance of Turks*- is admitted, (e) It is hoped that activity now going on at Babeghj the presence of war ships and airships, and the exaggerated reports which these steps will givo rise to, may have the effect of delaying, if not actually preventing an advance in force of the enemy- already hampered by transport and supply difficulties &lt; and thus giving more time to Shereef to organize his forces and undertake that independent action against Turks which is so desirable, whilst more time would also be given to Sir A* Murray to organize his offensive from Sinai which will be of the greatest value to Shereef 1 s movement as a direct menace against Hedjaz railway:, (f) If however the Turks can succeed in advancing South from Medina with a view to re-capturing the Holy Places, we should in my opinion oppose that advance by throwing British or French troops into Babctfc; tut in vlcvl of W remarks i* 1 9arl1 ' pa ” ol this telegram, « 1= elearly desirable vie shoul. delay such action as lens as we possibly con. Inis mavmay maka us ijoo laijG and it/ is for that raason that ♦ I proposed that arrangements should ho mads for with- drawal on hoard steamors of European and Egyptian personnel now there. If on the other hand our airships and intelligence clearly indicate that an advan.ee in forco is intended, then I think every effort should ho made to stop it. In recent scare when Turkish troops were said to havo reached Bir Ihn 61 Hussein, Shereef implored our assistance and hegged for British troops to he landed at Rahegho In face of the defeat which threatened him* he threw religious scruple to the winds and undoubtedly a similar situation will arise should a serious advance take place and should his own pre parations to resist it he not sufficiently advanced to give him some reasonable hope of success* (g) For above reasons I again repeat my care fully considered opinion that neither British nor French brigades should be sent to Rabegh until true facts of enemy 1 s situation and intentions are clearer, but that preparations for an emergency should be made* I fully understand and sympathise with views of Sir W 0 Robertson and Sir Ao Murray that io will seriously interfere with .latter*s Sinai plans to detach from his already depleted forces the troops required for an emergency which may or which may not arias in Hedjaz and therefore, French infantry force recormended by Colonel Bremen to be collected at Suez and kept there pending develop ments, it would simplify the situation and would alsoScll&gt;j.GI^ 'bfoG SIlGrOGf WllO Vi/8 0 ^ , 0 Vva ° aj-lG^ed to accept offer Of French aonistance at the time His Majesty's Govern ment had definitely decided not to allow any British troops to be landed in Hedjaz. if,for political or military reasons, this plan is not feasible and if the French Government will not allow their artillery and machine gun units now at Suez to proceed to Rabegh without the infantry support Bremcnd insists upon -ohen I must carry on as best I can on the present lines buu l would ask to be absolved from responsibil ity if, owing to emergency preparations being impossible, Shereef's movement should unfortunately collapse. May I suggest to Your Lordship to show this tele gram to Sir W* Robertson? Since drafting the above I have received full text of Lawrence’s telegram despatched to London November 17th and telegraphed to me to-day by Commander in-Chiof Egyptc I see no reason to alter the views I have now expressed to Your Lordship*[TM.

The British were concerned that recognising the title would compromise treaties acknowledging the independence of other Arab chiefs.The papers include: reports by the High Commissioner, Egypt, Sir Arthur Henry McMahon; reports and discussion of the issue by the India Office, the Foreign Office, British officials in the Middle East, British diplomats, and the Government of India; suggestions for alternative titles by McMahon, the French Government, the Government of India, and others; the vital importance, in the British view, of supporting the Sharif's military operations against the Ottoman Turks (e.g. folio 134); the question of whether to allow the circulation of the newspaper
