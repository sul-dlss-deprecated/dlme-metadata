Jones writes that a separate report on the slave trade, covering the period October 1844 to 30 April 1857, will follow. Following Jones’s letter is a chronological table and index (folios 4-5), which list occurrences in the Gulf between the period May 1855 and April 1856, though not in a strict chronological order. Each occurrence has a page number, although it is unclear how the page numbers refer to the report, which has no consistent original pagination sequence.The report itself (folios 6-36) is arranged by geographical area or tribe, as follows:Joasmees [Qāsimī, incorporating Sharjah and Ra’s al-Khaymah]Beniyas [Banī Yās]Debaye [Dubai]Ejmaun [Ajman] and Amulgavine [Umm al-QaywaynUttoobees [ʿUtūb] and Wahabees [Wahhābī]Muscat</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023652101.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
