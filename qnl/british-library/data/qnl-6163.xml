Dated 16th February, 1949 The Kuwait G-overnment have published a notification (Copy by Bag) warning all foreigners to register with the oecurity Department and take out perrais de xhm j sejours. Time limit of one month is imposed failure to comply entailing fine or imprisonment. punish foreigners under our jurisdiction but I am sure of latter’s obligation to comply with local law controlling residents not imposed upon them by a Kings Regula/tion. Unilateral publication without any prior consultation with me is most regrettable in view of special relations. Nevertheless Kuwait's desire to control influx of foreign labour entering Kuwait deserves our co-operation. I am unaware of the practice and should be grateful for instructions as to what course I should adopt. 2 Kuwait Grovernment cannot of course OaLLUWaY TMTelegram Code. From Prodrome, Bahrain.

If you see no objection I suggest you should ( ? tell ) Shaikh that as notification was published without any reference to you, you presume it is meant to apply only to foreigners under his jurisdiction and ask him to confirm this. If he says he wishes k® it to apply to all foreigners, you should point out impropriety of his action in publishing it without consultation with you and please inform him that it cannot be applied to foreigners under H.M.

DaTLD 26TH FKBRUaI^Y, 1949. Your telegram No. 4b. There is no doubt that the Shaikh intends or intended, that the notification should ao^ly to all foreigners on grounds that matter is internal and not external, e.g. since rny telegram No. 31, Kuwait Oil Company have been asked to comply in respect of all foreigners. They have replied that matter is under reference to me. 2. I have discussed matter with Shaikh who now wishes me to adjust the notification to conform with his internal authority and our authority over British protected persons and at the smae time not to weaken the former. 3. In fact it is doubtful if his Security Department wish to co-operate in working of Kuwait Orcler-in-Council in so far as it affects what they consider their internal independence. The notification is discriminating against foreigners since Kuwaitis do not have to register and this particularly affects our special position. The situation involves first principles and I think should be considered of importance as involving basis of position of His Majesty's Crovernment. Trend is evidenced by recent arming of security and town police and similar activities e.g. employment of Palestinian instructors without asking our co-operation. I am continuing discussions and will report further. 4. as regards foreigners not under our jurisdiction I have informed nuwait Government that we are closely concerned since any repwccussion abroad would eventually devolve upon us. I have also advised them to reduce fees to correspond with fees charged Kuwaitis abroad. Political A^ent, Kuwait.*j/v. CONFIDENT! Al • Kuwait Ktcript !

My C/37( 13/11) ;Saving doted 26th February, 1949, and foreign Office Circular No. 37 dated the 24th fay, 1948. /alidity of Palestinian Passports after the termination of the Mandate. 2. Problem of visas for Palestinians the period of validity of whose passports has expired, or v;ho have no travel papers at all, is assuming important proportions. 3. Acco&amp;ing to ray interpretstion of the spirit of Foreign Office Circular No. 37 there should be no oujection, until more permanent arrangements are made, to our extending the validity of time-expired passports for shor t periods and granting visas when journeys are unavoidable. If you approve of this there remains only the question of Palestinians who have come here without documents. 4. Kuwait government have started issuing forms of ’laissez passer’ to certain of their Palestinian employees who have no travel papers at all. A ‘here seems to be no objection to this on analogy of the Kuwait Government’s right to issue its own passports. They have, however, asked me to issue visas on them. 5. Problem is complicated by definition of 'British dubject' and 'Ku ait iubject' by Section 8 (corrected to 9) (iii) of ifert 1 of Kuwait Order-in-Counc11, according/according to which Palestinians here who are not registered as in the employ of British Subjects or Foreigners (which includes the Kuwait Oil Company and other foreign companies) are, since the termination of the mandate, subject to jurisdiction of Bhei.th of Kuwait; whereas those who are in registered under the Order in Council as/the service of British Subjects or Foreigners are subject to our jurisdiction with certain reservations relating to Jfert / of the Order in Council, £his means that, if they are so registered, they are subject to our passport control. 6. Bo far only the provisions of Part /I of the a, ^ V 0 ^ Order in Council relating to the registration of Companies have been complied with; and it will not be possible to register the 4457 passports of British Subjects as required by Part /I until we get more staff. ^’he Kuwait Oil Company and their contracting firms, who fitu are by far the largest employers of Kuwait Subjects (as defined by the Order in Council), have given us lists of all their employees by name; but this has not been done for the specific purposes contemplated by Article 8 (iii) of the Order in Council, Nor am I certain that it is desirable - in view of local sentiment - that they should register for this purpose all of their employees who are Kuwait Subjects, and I do not propose to suggest to them tl,at they should do so. ^ 7. As long as they remain unregistered at the Agency the Palestinians among them who have no papers s.ould loo^ to the Kuwait Government for travel documents; but such documents of laissez passer are unlikely to be of much, if any, value without our visas. 8. Until further instructions are received, I shallissue visas on these forms of laissez passer when I consider it desirable to help Itelestinians in this respect. 9.

Dated 3rd April, 1949. Reference my Saving No. 0/37(13/11) dated 26th February, 1949. I have had further discussions with the Sheikh and the Chief of Security, Abdullah Mubarak, with the result that it has now been agreed that the Notification published by the Security Department does not apply to foreigners who come under our jurisdiction in thelterms of the Kuwait Order in Council. 2. With regard to registration of British Passports under Bart 71 of the Kuwait Order in Council we are making arrangements with the Kuwait Oil Company and other British Companies to send the passports in small batches for registration. 3. There remains the question of the registration of the passports of United States citizens. It will not be desirable to register their passports in the Agency. This should presumably be done by the American Consul, Basra, who has unofficial notarial power in Kuwaio. I should be grateful if you would confirm.No.C/67 (13/11). The Political agency, Kuwait, M,' April, 1949. Please refer to Oalloway's Saving No.C/63 (13/11) of the 3rd April, 1949. 2. I have been ^oirv; into the administration . t i nave oeen i-nou unc of the passport section of this office in connection with K the registration of British Subjects under Part VI of tne x Order in Council and other matters. cc 70t 3. The number of British Protected Personsin / T Kuwait has risen from a mere 100 in 1944 to some 4400 ^ c odd today. In addition to the passport work which the presence of these persons involves (which induces the issue of new passports and making the necessary enquiries before they are issued in doubtlul cases), we have a Kood deal to do in connection with the passports of forei^iers and of Kuwait Subjects. To do all oi tnis there is one locally recruited Arab cierk. He has done his oest and is, I consider, to be congratulated on wnat he nas manag ed to do; but he is clearly npt fitted by education or background to run a passport office at the standard of efficiency expected by the Foreign Office, -^nd, iiicieed, I find that he lias not fully digested or understood all the circulars that are received, and the necessary files have not been properly maintained. Nor is he qualified to receive in the way that they have a right to expect the Kuropeans and Americans that frequent the passport olxice, and as long as the Political Agent is the only officer here clearly he cannot receive them all himself, or, ' n indeed, invariably be in the office ./hen they call. I understand that complaints were made by the British residents to Major Tufton Beamish, M.P., when he came nere m hallo,/ay s time about their reception by clerks in the Agency, and t.vice recently the Consul-Creneral at Basra nas taken it himself to draw our attention to mistakes maoe in tne issue of British passports. 4 Now we are faced with resuming the registration of some*4400 British Subjects under Part VI of the Order in Council. This was done formerly but neglected in the last three years. Each passport has to be stamped separately and the Consular stamps have to be accounted for. We are making a start again because our failure to do this work led to serious political qonsequences — the Kuwait hpyern- ment trying to rorestall us by the issue of tneir notification regarding the registration of all persons who are not subjects of the Shaikh —; but we cannot complete this task during tne year without additional staff. 5. There still remains the supervision of Americans and European foreigners. There are a number oitne latter employed' by the Schlumberger Overseas S.a., a French enter prise working for the Kuwait Oil Company, i/e snould not &gt; register their passports; but, for security reasons, it is desirable that we should keep a record of particulars of them/.. ,E. Sir W.R. Hay, KCIE.,CSI., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.then and of their comings and gpin^s. The security section of the Oil Company are very seriously concerned about the movements of certain of these people. 6. To introduce Foreign Office standards into the passport section, to restart the registration of British Subjects and to keep a record of foreigners here we clearly require, in addition to the existing clerk, the B4 officer already sanctioned for this post; and I should be grateful if he could be sent here as soon as possible. There is also a good deal of other work for the B4 officer to do. /sNo. 0/^5(13X11).
