Letter to Foreign Office on qatar policy, dated 1st February. Letters to and from Air Ministry about Qatar air facilities. Letters to and from Air Ministry about Koweit air facilities. f&gt;M Ki /L I H i he Hon'Me Lt.Col. T.G.W. Powle, C .B * K • Cj (/ 0~C -Js * J ^&gt;-4 i As/ immmmmr- 2 - \4\ .. (W. ^ ^ As you will see, we have suggested to the Air Ministry that the A.O.G. might take advantage of your visit to Baghdad to have a talk with you and Dickson on this last subject. The Koweit oil company have strongly urged us to select our sites straight away in the interest of simplifying subsequent operations, and, as you will see, we have, in the light of this, suggested to the Air Ministry that they should iirmedlately reconnoitre for sites at JWa&amp;ra and Suhaihiya and find out exactly what they want. Itien they have done that we can then consider the question of either purchasing them, if they are In private ownership, or getting them on favourable terms or free of charge from the Sheikh if they are Government p2X &gt;perty. It will not matter if we do not make any use of them for quite a long time to come, de main thing will he that we shall have secured an unassailable title and that the oil concessionnaires, whoever they may be, will not be able to interfere with us in respect of these areas. £• I am sending under a separate letter an advance copy of the note of a discussion here about the date gardens, which may be useful to you in case the question comes up. of a talk with Janson and Holmes about oil concessions in general, with particular reference to the Neutral Zone. 3. There is also going to you officially the note Yours sincerely.P.Z.736/34. DUPLICATE. Origir|a! aant toy ^^0 INDIA 5th February 1934. My dear McCiaughry, ( Many thanks for your letter of the 29th January, No. S.31084/Part 2, about air facilities in Kowelt. We note the views expressed by the Air Officer Commanding. 2. .Permission for the free use of the existing land ing ground will presumably be covered by the arrangements which the Political Resident has been Instructed to endeavour to make with the sheikh of Koweit in regard to civil and military aerodromes in his territory. possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we shoula, so far as possible, have selected any areas we may wish for defence etc. purposes in advance, and while the suggestion made by you in connection with ' the Qatar facilities, that the phrase 'any sites which kg Commander W.A. IvtoClaughry, rnay// ,. , D30., MC., DPC.. As regards additional facilities to meet Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C. 2.X (?) may have 'been selected' in Clause 5 01 the Government Agreement should be strengthened, e.g. on the lines ''any sites which may he reciuired', was discussed with them a few days ago, they took the line that the revised wording would place them in an impossible position. Unless, therefore, the Air Ministry see strong objection, we think it would be desirable to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Coirnianding's opinion, be required near Jhaira and Suoaihiya. Once the sites have been selected the cicsirability oj. acQuiring them ano. also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding^ telegram of 26th January * as an insurance against the future, could be considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably be desirable not to let it become gene rally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Corrrnanding are not Government land tte effect may be to put up the price against us. 4. The position in regard to the points dealt with in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply is generally similar to that in regard to Qatar. An assurance has been/- 3 - been obtained from the Company as regards wireless and other methods of communication; difficulty should not presumably arise as regards the point referred to In (h); point (c) Is one for consideration, as is point (d); point (e) is a matter for local discussion and agreement 0-i- x inanelal terms once ai-^y nei/v lanoxng j^rouncis have oeen acquired; (f) is equally for local discussion in the first place, as is (h); the position in regard to (g) is as stated in respect of Qatar in paragraph 5 of my letter No. p.Z.727/34 of 1st February. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner at th= i orel &amp; n Cfj-lce, Seal at tne Admiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Copies will also go by the next air mail to Powle, to whom a copy of your letter under reply ana of my letter of 1st February, p.z.727/34, to you about Qatar, were sent by the air mail of 2nd February, fife understand that the Resident, accompanied by Colonel Dickson, is to visit Baghdad about 15th Jebruary to discuss anti-smuggling measures in Koweit, and we suggest that the opportunity might be taken for a/- 4 - a discussion between Fowls, Dickson and the Air Officer Coniffianding, on the subject of Koweit air facilities.

Will you please, therefore, let us know whether the information given by A.O.C. Iraq under (b) and (c) is sufficient for your purpose, or whether you wish a reconnaissance to be carried out to select actual sites which would be required near Jnhra and Bubaihiya. 2. Additionally, of course, we will require provision to be made similar to those already mentioned in my letters on the subject of ^atar for such facilities as:- (a) W/T and prevention of interference by other stations.

I added that whatever these future intentions were, any such measures as contemplated were clearly to his advantage as they would render his State very much safer from an outside enemy, and were clearly of a defensive nature only* Herethe^laughingly interrupted me and said 'Yes, and the will B.A.F./also be able to defend the Oil Company that gets the Kuwait Concession, so why not say that this is the sole purpose of the R # A»F# wanting landing and base facilities in my State t »7hy beat about the bush Colonel Dickson'. The Shaikh having rather 'taken the wind out of my sails' and so to speak having 'broken the ice' by his quick perception of what I was driving at, at once assisted me in my object by discussing the whole business with great friendliness and frankness. He said that (a) He had no objection to the R.A»F» marking out the landing grounds at Subeiyiyeh and Jahara as specified, any time they chose. (b) He could not however give such areas outright to His Majesty's Government, nor was he prepared to sell. He would however loan them for as long as His Majesty's Government desired (rent free) provided the water rights of * his Bedouin and the villages of Jahara were not interefered v/ith. His Majesty's Government could also, if they liked, erect~ 2 - 7#/ erect buildings on the sites required* 4. As regards the ^Shuwaikh Area' (including Quarantine Buildings and Goal Depot,miles by 1 mile in size): The Shaikh said that he could neither sell nor present these to G-overnment, but he would be willing to rent the area on terms which he would make as easy as he possibly could and for as long as was required provided (a) That the road to Basra passing through the area was not interfered with; (t)) aitisiy^r^ggi specified were not denied to local craft - it being necessary to them as a harbour of refuge during 'Shamals', when they were unable to enter the various ♦basins 1 in front of the town on account of low tide# (c) He was not asked to repair the Quarantine buildings which would cost at least Rs»15,000/-, he opined* 5 # When I asked what rent approximately he would require if His Majesty's Government eventually decided on taking the 'Shuwaikh 1 * area, he replied that he would have to think about it, but in any case he would make it as reasonable and as low as he could for the sake of the Royal Air Force, who were King George^ troops and so entitled to every consideration. The Shaikh reminded me, however, that the area mentioned included the land leased by His Majesty's Government in 1907 (during the Berlin - Baghdad Railway scare) under the name 'Shuwaikh Lease' and that His Majesty's Government had then paid an annual rent of Rs,60,000/- until 1923 when it was cancelled. 6« The Shaikh then went on to say that the area in question would also obviously be required by any Oil Company, operating in Kuwait, but that he thought it possible (thou^i he was not quite sure) that both the Royal Air Force and any Oil Company operating could find room for ther separate requirements side by side.7 # Here I thought it wise not to press the point either in the matter of rent or whether the area beyond that required by the Royal Air Force, was suitable for Oil tanks, landing stages etc. etc. .'/hat stood out very plainly was the fact that the Shaikh entirely appreciated the advantages of Shuwaikh area both as an Air Base and &amp;ujh to any Oil Company operating in Kuwait, whether it would be possible for both Air and Oil requirements to be met side by side only experts can decide. Second Interview (28.3.24) . This was mainly devoted to discussing the latest offer of the Kuwait Oil Company, which he, the Shaikh, was entirely dissatisfied with. (See separate note). The Shaikh then told me that he had that morning passed a hint to Mohamed Yatim (Major Holmes' Confidential Agent) to the effect that possibly His Majesty's G-overnment would ask for the Shuwaikh area as an R.A.F. land and Flying Boat base and that he wanted his principals, Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm to realize beforehand that if their Company (The Kuwait Oil Company) had an eye on the area also, he, the Shaikh, would always give the preference to the Royal Air Force, as obviously any Royal Air Force base contemplated would be for the protection of the Oil Company before anything else. I here pointed out that in the Political Agreement which had been come to between His Majesty's Government and the Kuwait Oil Company in London, I believed that there was a clause (though I had not yet seen it, the Agreement) to the effect that His Majesty's G-ovemment had the prior right (with the approval of the Shaikh, of course) to select any sites, landing grounds etc., which the Royal Air Force might require for defensive purposes. The Shaikh seemed rather pleased than otherwiseotlierwise to hear this, but expressed the wish that he had been put in possession of a copy of this ^ Political Agreement n at the time the n Draft Oil xi^reement ^ had been handed to him, as it would have saved him some anxiety.cni^ruJuTi^L. D.O.No.G-84. -Hs % Q/ POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT • Dated the 1st March 1934 The following are the results of an intervie?/ which I had with the Shaikh on 25th February 1934 on the question of 'Oil'.* 1, I opened the talk by saying that I understood that he, the Shaikhj had received the Kuwait Oil Company's new Draft agreement and presuoied that he had read it* 2, The Shaikh at once flared up and said he was going to see Holmes and Chisholm on Tuesday (27th February) and was going to ask them what they meant by treating Gsl him like a child. How had they A imprudence, he asked, to offer him Rs.200,000/- Con Jfere signing) when Holmes had offered him Hs.250,000/- last year and Sir John Cadman had offered as much as 4 lacs. Surely if his Concession was worth 4 lacs to the latter, it was still worth that to the Kuwait Oil Company. 3, The Shaikh continued and said, that he was going to tell Holmes and Chisholm to 'clear out' and 'leave Kuwait' unless they could see their way to talk sense, that there were many other Oil Companies in the world who would no doubt be willing to offer a fair and decent price. Why, even Bin Saud had not so long ago made it known that if he, Shaikh Ahmad, followed his lead and gave the Kuwait Concession as well as that of the Neutral Zone to the Standard Oil Company of California he. Bin Saud would take it as a very friendly act. 4® I then asked Shaikh why he had not accepted Cadman's offer, as it really had been good. His reply The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T^Fowle, Go.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R S .his reply was that previous to Gadman's arrival, Holmes had told him that anything that the A^P^O.CU offered he, Holmes, would be able to beat, so he had begged him to give him the chance of outbidding A»F # O.C. in any offer they made. He, the Shaikh, had promised to do this. The Shaikh went on to say that Holmes had added that should there come a time when h^ company could not beat the A.P.O.G. t s offer, then he, Holmes, would say so and the Shaikh could go ahead and deal with A»P»G.G» unhampered by him, Holmes. Before Gadman made his offer, Holmes 1 offer had reached Hs.250,000 (on signature). After Gadman T s offer had been made and you had come here and seen him, he, the Shaikh, had not asked Holmes to bid again, for he had decided to potpone all netotiations (as he didK 5. The Shaikh again said that unless the Kuwait Oil Company played tT fair 7 f and made a decent offer, he was going to tell them that there were many Oil Companies in the world whom he could get to bid against them and he fully intended to frighten the Kuwait Oil Company in this way. But he was determined that if they did not 'play up n they could go. 6« I here agreed that he had every right to get the best he could out of the Kuwait Oil Company, but told him that as man to man 1 proposed giving him a piece of private advice. This, I emphasized, had nothing to do with anyone but myself and him. It was to the eflect that as I knew His Majesty f s G-ovemment had n no use Tf for the Standard Oil Company of California, who had got into Hassa recently, he must be very careful indeed not to allow them to come into the field, as bidders against Kuwait Oil Company. The Shaikh smiled at my remark, and saicj 'Leave that to me. I give you my word of honour that in whatever way I manoeuvre with the Kuwait Oil Company or whatever I say by way of threat to themthem, I shall never give a concession to any Company that is not approved of by your Government. You must however let me go about getting Kuwait Oil Company to N come to reason in my own way tt . 7. Before leaving ^the Shaikh begged me to say nothing at all of what he had said to the Kuwait Oil Company's representatives {Holmes and Ghisholm), as I might spoil all for him. He desired to deal with them hiw own way» 8. I think the Shaikh is really roused against the Kuwait Oil Company's lo?/ offer of Rs.200,000 as against Holmes' and Cadman's offer of last year. He, of course, only has himself to blame, but we must not forget what we want too . In my opinion the Kuwait Oil Company ought to get on with things and act 'big;*. They can surely afford to spend money. They will, I fear, get aj&gt;ywhere if they start haggling over small figures. If I were than, I should either n go all out Tr and offer Cadman's figure of four lacs (on signature) or else ask the Shaikh now and without delay what he wants , and then either agree out of hand or work downwards. The point is that at present they (K.O.C.) have a clear field and no competitors. But they soon will have if they don't watch it. Forgive this hurried scrawl, but I wanted you to know how the Shaikh had reacted to Kuwait Oil Company's first offer.Telegram xx ITrom Political Resident, JBushire.

Your telegram of the 16th February No.T/44 paragraph 3. Our object is of course to secure Kuwait concession for Kuwait Oil Company and we should much prefer therefore to have informed Shaikh frankly and had wished it given to him. This course would from Foreign Office point of view have had fur- -ther advantage of 'being easily defensible if necess- -ary with United States Grovernment whose original intervention was on behalf of ?Gulf Oil Company who. now participate in Kuwait Oil Company on a fifty? fifty basis. But we appreciate your views that over enthusiastic support might make Company's position more difficult. If in view of above you are still of this opinion we should prefer warning to Shaikh should be to the effect that His Majesty's Government will not consent to grant of concession to any company whichwhich is not ( like Kuwaiti Oil Company ) at least 50$ British. We are in a position a— — — ^ to go further in the case of Kuwait than in the case of Qatar which as you know falls within •Irag Petroleum Company's sphere under oil agreement so that it was impossible to secure 50$ British participation. The Poreign Office think however and I agree that any warn- -ing should 'be given orally and not in writing. The fact that there has 'been diplomatic discuss- -ion with United States Government in the past and that definite pledges ( though possibly not covered hy the present case ) were given make it necessary to walk very carefully. 2.

He leaves tomorrow for Egypt and Syria. He will he 'back next months perhaps with YdliM, whom he hopes to meet in Kgypt* In the course of conversation Awayni made the following statements 1. The Standard Oil of California have officially asked the Sa'udi Government about the position between them and the Arabian Development Syndicate. The Government have put them off by saying that nothing has been settled, 2. Awayni wished to get the Government to agree to his general proposals before discussing pecuniary terms. He has, however, made his proposals under this head unofficially. They are (a) to pay a sum down of £.15,000 (not a loan) to the joint Rulers for the grant of the Neutral Sone concession; (b) to pay £.5000 a year rent until commercial exploitation is possible; (c) to pay thereafter 4/- a ton royalty. The Ba^di Arab Oovernment want £.15,000 down for their own share of the payment at (a). Awayni thinks they would take £.10,000. 3. The clause in the secret agreement between the Sa^di Arab Government and Standard Oil of California giving a right of preference on equal terms in regard to Ibn Sa'ud^ right in the Neutral Zone provides for a penalty of £.30,000 to be paid by the Sa f \idi Arab Government in the event of the concession, as regards Ibn Sa'ud's share, being given over the heads of Standard Oil of California. 4. The King is determined by hook or by crook to get out of any conunitment to the Standard Oil of California and /has 'V /has instructed his Government to do the necessary to this end. Awayni outlines the following possible evolution Sa f udi Arab Oovemiaent come to terms with Ydlibi. Sa'udi Arab Government them offer the concession on those terms, so far as their interest is concerned, to Standard Oil of California. Standard Oil of California agree and Sa^di Arab Government then say that it is up to Standard Oil of California to square the Sheykh of Kuwait and/or His Majesty's Government. Standard Oil of California fail in this. Sa'udi Arab Government then say, * e have fulfilled our obligation. ¥e are now free unless you pay us the lump sum (say £.10,000) that you agreed to pay.' Standard Oil of California would be unable to pay on this scale for an ineffective concession and would thus be eliminated. 5» The Standard Oil of California have got permission to send a geologist to the Yanbu 1 - Muwayba area, subject to his report being communicated to the Sa'fidi Arab Government. Awayni has had a promise that this report will be passed on to his group. 6. In both cases the King wants to have nothing to do with any but genuinely British interests. 7. Major Holmes is to have nothing to do with the business. The Sheykh of Kuwait mad© this a condition, when the Syndicate sounded him about the Neutral Zone. Awayni has given an official undertaking to the SaMdi Arab Government that Holmes will in no way be concerned. I discussed the whole subject enough to elucidate the above points and I do not think I have gone materially wrong in my attempt to reproduce them in nrecise form. I avoided as far as possible any comment on the position of the XtrnxAxxA Ba'Mi Arab Government, beyond suggesting that there might /bebe a case for arbitration under head 4, as the Sa'usli Arab Government and the Standard Oil of California had apparently not provided for the contingency of the Sheykh of Kuwait refusing to have anything to do with Standard Oil of California. I put a direct question regarding Major Holmes* For the rest, I said that any question in regard to the Sheykh of Kuwait 's interest was entirely outside my province, both in principle and in actual fact as the matter was far too delicate for me to mix up in it. The only advice I would give was that Awayni's principals should ascertain the views of His Majesty 's Government in London. Awayni again spoke of Mr.Philby as working with the Americans, but more casually than when he last came to see me. AHDREl RYAN. 8/2/34.4 By Air Mail. P.Z /J9 /v.... /S CfrfM-/ ha 1 . J 'll 1 !

These terms are embodied in the draft agreement I between His Majesty's Government and the Company of which copy is enclosed herewith. The representatives of the Company have also agreed to include in the draft of their proposed agreement with the Sheikh (copy of which has been communicated to your Department) additional clauses to the following effect:- (l) The insertion in Article 11 A, which provides for the cases in which the concession may be terminated, of the following sub-clause:- '(d) If the Company shall fail to observe any of the terms of an agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government signed in London on. . .

Though he was due to sail this week, he has postponed his departure till Wednesday, 88th February, in order that there may be an opportunity of considering whether arrangements can be made for the execution of the agreement on behalf of His Majesty's Government before that date. 4. Sir Samuel Hoare for his part feels fully satisfied that the terms of the proposed agreement adequately secure the essential desiderata of His Majesty's Government, and the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who have been consulted on the substance of the terms, share this view, Colonel Fowle having stated his opinion that the agreement is most staisfactory• In these circumstances, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that, it, as he hopes, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agrees to the pioposed terms, there would be considerable advantage in taking the opportunity offered by Mr# Stevens s willingness to sign at once and in arranging accoi. dingly it possible, for/3. for the execution of' the agreement before he returns to America. 5* As regards the manner in which the agreement should be executed on behalf of His Majesty^ Government Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that, if the other Ministers concerned concur, he might authorise its signature by one of the Under Secretaries of State at the India Office^ and that such authorisation by the four Departments primarily concerned would constitute a sufficient authority for the execution of the agreement, in the manner suggested, on behalf of His Majesty's ^Government. 6. Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful for a very early reply to this letter, in order that if at all possible the agreement may be executed before Mr- Stevens's return to America. 7.

It woula be very aifficult for H.M.G. to get any efiective safeguards in respect of the Neutral Zon« but on the other hand they coula not aivest themselves of all responsibility in the event of a concession being granted. Mr. Laithwaite saia that before H.i.G. agreed to the grant of a concession in so far as toe aheikh of Koweit was concerned it woula be necessary to insist on some prior agreement with Ibn Saua on the question of jurisaiction. Y SENT PY AIR MAIL protection/protection, etc., in the Neutral zone. jir Loula Kersnaw suiu tout If oil concessions were developed in Hasa and Koweit it would be extremely uii'iicult to resist inaeXinitely toe grant oi' a concessio: in toe Neutral Zone if both Ibn Saua and the Sheikh, as seemed probable, were in favour of it. 'flie meeting agreed and Uimeu to the consideration of the competitors for a concession who had already appeared in the field. These seemed to be; (1) The Arabian Oil Development Syndicate represented by Yulibi ana&gt;5roup, in which fcr. Janson of the Eastern and General Syndicate had a considerable interest; (2) The Iraq petroleum Company; am (3) Hie Standard oil Company of California. ..r. Starling explained that since the Neutral Zone was within the red line of the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Koweit Oil Company, in which the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf Oil Corporation each had a 50^ interest, would be unable to compete for a concession independently of the Iraq petroleum Company. Sir Louis Kershaw said that it was presumably politically most undesirable that the standard Oil should obtain the concession, IVir. fiend el agreed. He said that as far as could be gathered from the information at the disposal of the Foreign Office (Jedda telegram No.20 of 9th February) Ibn Sauu had already given toe standard Oil Company of California an option on a concession in toe Neutral Zone. The position now appeared to be that the Arabian Oil . -velopment syndicate, to whom Ibn Saud had also given some encouragement, hoped to be M.ble to get round this option by getting the Sheikh of Koweit to refuse to let the/the Standard Oil get a concession in the Zone. Mr. -UathWAitft aujtrested that perhaps the position was rather that Ibn Saud merely wanted some other competitor in order to bid up the Standard Oil. He asked what the preference granted to the 'tandard Oil really amounted to, and suggested that they had merely been offered a preference in the event of other considerations being equal. That meant that in spite of the penalty provision in Ibn Saud's agreement with the Standard Oil, to take effect if some other Company obtained a concession, the concession would in fact be given to the Company which offered the best terms. Mr. Eendel agreed that, other things being equal, Ibn Saud would perhaps prefer that the concession should go to the Standard Oil, and .Ir. ^rrmr suggested that it was merely politeness on the part of the King when he said that he would rather give the concession to a British company. Sir Louis Kershaw said that on the whole if we could arrange things so that a party acceptable to H.M.O. obtained a concession it was perhaps better in the long run to aim at this than at sterilisation.- Mr. .Earner saia that whoever got a concession it would be necessary in view of the joint sovereignty of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh over the Neutral Zone, to reach some definite agreement with Ibn Saud for carrying out unified measures of control, protection, etc., on behalf of both rulers. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that if the Americans got the concession the result would be that Ibn Saud's interest in the Neutral Zone would tend to increase, while/while similarlj the Sheikh's interest would be increased if the ooncesaion went to a British company. The question was thir one of actire political importance to us. Mr. I;endel said that it had been suggested that His Majesty 's Government might escape responsibility by informing any Company which competed for a concession that they would hare to work the concession at their own risk. He did not think such a course offered a real solution. If United States employee? of the Company were attacked by beduin raiders. Hie Majesty 's GoTernment would in practice either hare to intervene themselves or agree to the United States GoTornment doing so. It would be impossible in practice if an outrage occurred for His Majesty's Government to justify inaction by saying that the Company had already been warned. Mr. Lai ihwaite said that there seemed to be only two British companies whom His Majesty's Govemment might support in getting a concession, the Iracj Petroleum Company ana the Arabian Oil i/evelopment Syndicate. It seemed almost certain that the latter were merely concession hunters and would not work any concession themselves. ::i r T.nnKershaw disliked the idea of the concession being obtained by concession hunters l$ke the Arabian Oil development Syndicate, and it was agreed that His Majesty's Government should have as little to do with the Syndicate as possible. LaithTOite suggested that if we wanted the Iraq Petroleum Company to get the concession there were two alternative??. In the first place we might at once inform the Iraq Petroleum Company that we would support them if they/they oompeted for a concession; or, alternatively, we might offer our support to Ydlibi and his group, on condition only that they transferred any concession to the Iraq Petroleum Company. Mr. Warner thought that Itm Saud was not seriously thinking of granting a concession to the Ydlibi group who were not a syndicate with any real backing, and that he had merely entered into negotiations with them because he wished to get off a debt which he owed to Ydlibi, H« suggested that His Majesty's GrOTernment might say to Ibn aud that, in riew of the position of divided soTereignty in the Koweit Neutral Zone, it would not be practicable for any oil concession to be granted in that area until the King and the Sheikh had reached some agreement on the question of protection and control. Mr. Randal suggested that this would amount to a kind of provisional sterilisation and ir Louis Kershaw pointed out that it night let the Americans in, and defeat our purpose, which was that the concession should if possible, go to a British company. r .ftndel thought that His Majesty's Government might be able to use the power of vet© which they possessed in virtue of their agreements with the Jheikh to secure the acceptance by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of suitable conditions regarding protection, jurisdiction etc., and to ensure that the concession was granted to a suitable company, Mr. Walton said that it was desirable to make some approach to the Iraq Petroleum Company in the matter as soon as possible, end 'Ir. Laithwaite suggested that in raising the question with the Iraq Petroleum Company who were/were knavm t. be actirely interested we sheuld as a osnditisn of our actire suppart with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh get them te agree ts but cenditiens in regard t® British central, safeguards, etc. We cauld then aariee I.JH -aud against negotiating a canoesaian with Idlibi and make an offer ta the King ta advise the Sheikh te agree it ■«a&lt;mae«ioio» nirV« nr. .ffr,. tn t' yu, ta a cancessian in the Neutral 2ane. in return far a satisfaotary agreement with Ibn aaud on the queatian af jurisdictian and central, and an canditian that he agreed ta the grant a£ the oancesaian ta the Iraq Petroleum Company. .ftift lientlftl suggested that the raising of the Kaweit blackade by Ibn Saod might also be made a canditian af Hia Majesty's Garernment advising the Sheikh ta agree ta &amp; concession, but ^lr Lenin Kftrahaff. thought that this cenditian would prejudice the chances of an agreement in regard to oil, —hX i s'tirling said that far historical reasans the Iraq ?«troleura Company could be relied upon to oppose very vigarsmsly the grant af a concessian in the Neutral Zane te the Standard Oil Company af Califarnia. The Iraq Petroleum Company were a very wealthy cancern and, if they made up their minds ta get a cancession the question of money would nat be the same cansideratian ts them as it would be far instance to the A.P.O.C. said that the meeting was agreed that the Ydlibi Syndicate cauld be left out af account s® far af? the support of His Majesty's Gavemment was concerned, The/The first thing t# d® was t® get the Iraq Petroleum Company to agree t® conditions mere or less the same as those which were proposed for Qatar, in exchange for which His Majesty's Gorernment would offer to use their influence with the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud in favour of the Company. Mrt Bendel suggested that if the Iraq Petroleum Company were successful in getting a concession, they might in practice lease it out to the Koweit Oil Company and thus utilise the latter's organisation and avoid a duplication of staff and machinery, —otarXxng said that lit was noti'Sr&amp;e, as Mr, Janson had recently alleged at an interview at the Department of Overseas Trade, th«t Major Holmes had had conversations about this matter on behalf of the Syndicate with Mr. Eraser of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Mft L»ith7?aite explained that Major Holmes had himself admitted to him in a recent interview, the record of which had been circulated, that the conversations referred to had taken place last year when the position in regard to the Neutral Zone was much more indefinite but that Mr. Praser had refused to have anything to do with him when he (Major Holmes) had recently approached him by letter on the subject, Mr* Starling said that he was confident that the Iraq Petroleum Company would certainly avoid having any relations with the Eastern and General Syndicate or the Ydlibi Group in regard to a concession in the Neutral 2©ne, and he was sure that if Mr, Praser were told that sterilisation, whieh the Iraq Petroleum Company had been inclined to favour, was impracticable, the Iraq Petroleum Company would be ready at once to become a competitor for a ooneession. There need not/—8- net be any delay abaut this since he understood that Mr. Praser had already received instructions from the Board of the Iraq Petroleum Company to compete for a concession, if any concession were to be granted in the area Ty-- f-muanaiBHs of the meeting may be summarised as follows (a) that atefllisation, while desirable in principle, was impracticable; (b) that on this assimption it was desirable to secure the Neutral k-one concession for a British company or a company with a substantial British element, and that there would be strong objecton to the concession being secured by the Standard Oil of Oulifomia, (c) that the Iran Petroleum Company, which was definitely interested in the area, was the only Company with a British el ment which appeared likely to be able to take it up*, (4) that it was undesirable to support the Arabian Development Jyndicate, particularly in view oi their relation- with the Eastern and General Syndicate; (e) that an immediate informal approach should be made to the Iraq Petroleum Company by the India CKfice, with a view to explaining frankly the official attitude in regard to the situation and intimating that subject to their meeting us over the terns of any agreement as regards control and safeguards, we vould support them both with Ibn frwrf and with the Sheikh of Xoweit. (f) that subject, to a satisfactory response by the Iraq Petroleum Company, Sir A.Kyen, to whom no interim reply/^ 'I reply need be sent, should be instructed to infom Ito Saud that we did not recommend the irabian Development Syndicate; that we appreciated however his anxiety for British exploitation and understood that the Iraq Petroleum Company whom we could recommend, wishea to apply; that any concession would, as he would agree, raise questions of jurisdiction and protection which would have to be settled between us and that it woula be necessary to reach an understanding on this as a preliminary to our allowing the Sheikh of Koweit concur in any concession; but that, subject to tiis, we would, if proposals satisfactory to Ton Saud and the Sheikh were submitted by the Iraq Petroleum Company, be prepared to advise the Sheikh to grant a ccmcession to them.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, 3.W. 1 p.Z.1400/34 1st March 1934.

The Admiralty concur in the course of action agreea upon at the meeting. They wish, however, to bring two points to the notice of the India Office. The first is in connection with safeguards. Sir Louis Kershaw has, as you know, already informed the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that a very tight Sovernment agreement would be necessary and it is perhaps therefore unnecessary to say that the Admiralty would attach fully as much importance to provision for a refinery and for pro-emption in the Xoweit Neutral Zone as elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. The second point is the protection of the oil company's personnel in the Keutral Zone - a question which was not dealt with at the meeting. We clearly cannot leave them unprotected; and it would be very unsatisfactory to leave protection to Ibn Saud, since this would greatly strengthen his hold over the Neutral Zone. It would also be impracticable to collaborate with him - a solution which might otherwise seem to be the natural consequence of a regime which really amounts to a Condominium. l'he only practicable possibility. therefore, is for the British Government to assume ... responsibility/ Ifeite. Esq., ■■ - ' In 4ia Office, S.W.I.responsibility for the protection of European personnel, an arrangement to which it would no doubt be difficult to get Ibn Baud to agree, since he is as jealous as the Sheikh of his position in the Neutral Zone. The grant of a concession in the Keutral 2one would therefore represent an additional defence commitment, albeit a commitment which cannot be avoided since sterilisation is not a practicable policy. In these circumstances the Admiralty would suggest that the whole question of protection should be gone into fully at an early stage, bearing in mind that the Chiefs of Staff in their report about .atar suggested that the question should be referred to the C.I .i).

T o dated the 1st Mar oh 1934, 1 am sending this down to you to Bahrain by the liand of Imperial Airways pilot, so that you oan get an idea how Ghisholm and Holmes have progressed with their new draft 'Concession' since they arrived* 2 # I shall send 4 copies of this direct to Bushire, and in anticipation of your approval, one copy, under private cover to Laithwaite by Westbound air mail so as to give him 3 first hand news of what is happening,. 5, As you already know the Kuwait Oil Company submitted their Draft Concession on 22nd February and made no progress at all up to the 8th March, the Shaikh showing by his manner, at every interview which took place, that he would discuss // /» nothing until the Gompaay f s representatives talked reason and offered much more attractive terms.. 4. As both Holmes and Ghisholm thought that perhaps the Shaikh was marking time until the arrival of the vioal Agreer^nt tr from London, I took the trouble to enquire j-j.om him on 8th March when he came to see me about soue other business, if this was so # 5 f The Shaikh assured me that the non-arrival of the Political Agreement was not worrying him much, as he knew that His Majesty's G-overnment had to safeguard both theirs and his interests; what was holding things up was the question of the 'lump sum' to be paid, on signature ^ The Kuwait Oil Company ^TQft:ress of iCuv/alt Oil Goiiiftany* s ireg;otiations» In continuation of my Confidential D.0»No.G-»84, must/ The Hon* ble Lt.-Colonel T.C # ./a r owle ? C # B»E»,1.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at B a h r a 1 11 oa ~ must, lie said, offer a reasonable figure, or he would have none of them. There were one or two other small items which he wished to get altered in the Draft Agreement, hut these were unimportant as compared with the !t lump sum 1 * on signature. 6 # The same evening I suggested to Chisholm and Holmes that they migjit, instead of heating about the bush with the Shaikh, ask him point blank v/iiat he wanted and thought a fit fi^oire for them to offer , as if the^ could get that, it would be a distinct advance, on what was happening, and they could then start beating him down to a reasonable figure. 7. They took my advice on Saturday, IDth March, and the Shaikh promised to give thou his figures later. 8. Yesterday, 13th March, the Shaikh sent for Llohamed Yatim and handed him a sheet of paper for delivery to Holmes and Ghisholm containing his terms. These were as follows: (a) Initial payment, Rs»550,000/- instead of Rs.200,000/- offered by Coy. (b) Rental Rs.120,000/- instead of Rs.65,000/- (c) Royalty Rs. 3/12/- ' n Rs.B/l0/- Tt ' (with minimum payment of Rs. 250,000/- insteaa of Company's Rs.200,000) (d) Sxport Tax of 5 annas instead of 2 annas offered by Company, te) Shaikh to have a Local Representative to deal with Company's Representatives in Kuwait; (f) Shaikh to have a Representative on Board in London. 9 # During a few minutes conversation which I later had with Holmes, I gathered that the Rs.3/12/- Royalty and the 5 annas Slxport Tax was the thing that frightened him most about the Shaikh's figures. It y /ould be quite impossible, he said, for the Company to accept the Shaikl^s figures, as i^ agreed to, it would prevent any Oil being marketable. Both he and Ghisholm (who later joined us) seemed rather pleased than otherwise to get the Shaikh's figures. They seemed to feel that they had something to start on atlaast. They, of course, intend to bargain downwards. 10o I myself think the main thing that now counts is the initial/(2)/ 1 0 VL i nitial 'oa^Tiient on signature ('a* aboTe): but I do not think the Shaikh will accept anything below Jls.4^0,000^ jJiiis, of course, is my private view only, I also think that provided the Company can get the Shaikh to agree to something reasonable as regards Royalty and Export Tax ('o 15 above), they should not waste time about the t t initial ftoqire' , but should act big and generously. It is most important to my mind to arrive at a quick decision . Holmes, I believe, thinks, as I do, though Chisholm appears to be more keen on bargaining. In this matter I value Holmes opinion more than that of Ghisholm, as he knows much more of the Shaikh* s psycholog/ical T, mak3 up 1 ^ II, I have a shrewd suspicion that perhaps both Holmes and Ghisholm think that I have been giving the Shaikh advice&gt; needless to say I have done nothing of the kind, I am leaving him entirely to himself at present, IS, I have also noticed a sli^it tendency on the part of Holmes and Ghisholm to distrust each other, which is a pity — his between ourselves . Holmes appears to be in favour Ox each of than seeing the Shaikh separately, but Ghisholm does not agree* Holmes* idea is that the Shaikh will 'thaw some— ■what if he sees him alone , and complains that when they are both present together, the Shaikh is as stiff and non-committal as the proverbial 'poker^. ^ After Noteo (1) Holmes told me on 9tii March 19 34 and again on 13th March that the one great danger that he feared was that the Standard Oil Company of California should get ^atar. iie was absolutely positive that they were exertingalltheir influence to get there and would in the end, £et the oonoessio unless His Majesty Govemmaat acted soon. I(2) Holmes was equally positive that there was no immediate fear of any attack on the Kuwait Neutral Zone by the California people, he said, however that I could take it for a fact that the Americans (California Company) had told Bin Saud that they ?/anted him to give than first refusal in the matter, they having stated their willingness to 'top' any other companies offer by 10^, if made at any time what soever. With this I am inclined to agree and it bears out IC.B.Abdul Latif's recent statement tome- You recollect he arrived back from Riath on £7th February» (He, as you know, is late Customs Director of Kuwait), (3) Incidentally Abdul Latif also brough back froa Bin oaud a do cument authorizing him to introduce any Company (Oil or otherwise) who were anxious to negotiate a concession with Bin Saud. Obviously Abdul Latif hopes to get the Kuwait Oil Company to nibble at the Neutral Zone, and has asked Bin Saud to let him do 'go between'. (4) Abdul Latif similarly hopes to get an 'Arms Concession' for the supply of rifles and munitions to the King. He is working for a Spanish firm as I told you when you were here. (5) Behind everything, and looming clearly above all else, is Bin Saud * s p;reat need of money. Can we not turn this to account?r, i GOH-ID^IVL .

An informal discussion took place at the India Office on the 1st March with representatives of the Anglo Persian Oil Company about oil in the Koweit neutral sone. Present;- Sir Louis Kershaw In the Chair Mr. G-.W. Rendel Foreign Office Mr. F. 0. S t arli ng Pe troleurn D e partme nt Mr. E.A. Seal Admiralty- Mr,. J.G. Walton ) ) Mr. J.G. Laithwaite ) India Office ) Mr. G.E. Cromhie ) Mr. Fraser ) ) A.P.O.C. Mr. Hearn ) The discussion may be summarised as follows:- Mr. Fraser said that since sterilisation was apparently ——— —- ■ — ~ impracticable the I.P.O. were eager to compete for a concession in the neutral zone and that the A.P.O.C., who had authority to act on behalf of the I.P.O. in regard to a concession in the neutral zone, were ready to consider at once y/hat steps could best be taken to secure a concession. It was pointed out to him that in the event of the I.P.O. securing the concession His Majesty's Government would require veiy stringent safeguards in vie?/ of the peculiarly difficult situation in the neutral zone. Mr. Fraser said that so far as the A.P.O.C. were concerned, they would he thought be willing to meet the wishes of H.M.G. on this point in a reasonable way. He hinted however that there might be difficulties in tnis connection with the French element in the I.P.C. but said that/that the A.P.O.C. would do all that they could to overcome any such difficulties with the French element. With regard to the immediate steps to he taken 'by the A.P.O.G., three lines of approach appeared to he open to 'the^ Companyi (a) The A.P.O.C. might themselves negotiate for a concession with Ihn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit on behalf of the I.P.C. (h) They might make use of Ydlibi and the Arabian Development Syndicate as agents in securing a concession. (c) They might just possibly be able to reach some sort of understanding with the Standard Oil Company of California under which the Standard Oil Company might agree to leave the I.P.C. a clear field in the neutral zone. With regard to (a) and (b), Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.O.C. would not even have considered the possibility of using Ydlibi and the Arabian Development Syndicate as agents had it not been for ohe A•P•0•u• s lack of success with Ibn Saud in previous oil negotiations. They were extremely suspicious about the standing of fdlibi and the Syndicate and their previous relations with the Eastern and General Syndicate, who were intimately- connected with the Arabian Syndicate, and with Major Holmes, were not such aa to inspire them with confidence. -They were therefore very apprehensive ahout using the Syndicate agents and thus making themselves responsible m any way for any action which might he taken hy the latter in their negotiations with Ihn Saud or the Sheikh. The A.P.O.C. had/(0 had hitherto declined to have any dealings with the Eastern and General or Arabian Development Syndicates and had refused to allow them to consider themselves as their agents in any way♦ Mr. Fraser knew however, that Major Holmes was anxious to discuss with him the possibility of the Arabian Development Syndicate securing a concession in the neutral zone on behalf of the I.P.O. Ydlibi claimed to be able to exercise influence on Ibn Baud in regard to the grant of oil concessions, but they had no reliable information as to how far Ydlibi could be trusted. It was known, of course, that Major Holmes himself was not persona grata with Ibn Saud. With regard to(c), Mr. Moffat, who used to be r i ii , umihw m wh 'hi — n ^ Tice President of the Standard Oil of ITew J ersey but had had to leave that Company, apparently on account of difficulties connected with internal American politics, and had now become Vice President of the Standard Oil Company of California, was at present in London. Mr. Praser knew that he wanted to have a discussion with him about Bahrein oil. The Standard Oil of California were in difficulties in regard to their Bahrein concession since they had up to now been unable to arrange fo r the marketing and refining of the oil. They appeared to have received some sort of option from Ibn Saud on a concession in the netural zone but Mr. Praser hinted at the possibility of being able to reach some sort of understanding with them as a result of which they might possibly agree to withdraw from the neutral sone and leave the I.P.O. a clear field in return for concessions made to them in other quarters At any rate Mr. Praser hoped to be able to obtain from Mr. Moffat some information about the intentions of the Standard Oil of California in the neutral zone and he believed that ^ could trust any information which Mr. Moffat gave mm.Mr. Eraser was quite emphatic that any understanding with the Standard Oil of California would not involTe the participation of any further American element with the frun I I.P.O. In developing a concession in the netural zone. It was pointed out to Mr. Praser on 'behalf of the Foreign Office that if the Standard Oil Company of California did compete for a concession in the neutral zone and if it offered to Ihn Saud and the Sheikh much more favourable terms than the I.P.O. it would 'be extremely difficult for His Majesty's G-overnment to support the I.P.O. in obtaining a concession. Mr. Eraser recognised this but did not think that this difficulty would arise since the I.P .O. would be ready to pay a good deal to prevent the Standard Oil of California from obtaining a concession in the ITeutra Zone. It was agreed that Mr. Eraser should proceed with his enquiries as to the steps to be taken Joy the A.r.O.O. and that meanwhile no action could be taken by H.M.G.B?/ Air Mail .

C India Office, Whitehall ? London, S.W.I, Copy sent to.^V^^. HHHH,2.1639/1934. FOHEIGN OFFICE, S .W .I (E 1201/160/91) 8th March, 1934. IMMEDIATE. jjtydear Gilbert, Following our conversation over the telephone of this afternoon, I write to give you the views of my higher authorities on the draft telegram to thePolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf about the oil concession which we drafted at our meeting on the evening of March 6th. 2. You will remember that that draft telegram explained that we should greatly prefer to inform the Sheikh fraufcly that we wish the concession given to the Koweit Oil Company. If, however, Fowle still sees objection to this positive course, he may warn the Sheikh - but only orally - that His Majesty's Government 'will not consent to the grant of the 'concession to any Company which is not (like the Koweit 'Oil Company) at least 50/ o British'. higher authorities here, while prepared in the last resort to agree to the second alternative, i.e. proposed warning to the Sheikh - would very greatlyprefer the first alternative - i.e. active support for the Koweit Oil Company. They question indeed whether it is really necessary at this stage to give the Hesident latitude for the second and less desirable course, i.e. the warning, since they find it hard to believe that, if Fowle is tactful and, while not giving over -enthusiastic I support to the Koweit Oil Company, makes it perfectly plain [ to the Sheikh that we will not consent to his giving the I concession to anyone else, he will fail in the end to have his way. They would therefore much have preferred to put this/ llithwaite, Esq.., I India Office,0&gt; ~ 2 ~ this point to Fowle in the first instance and ask him whether he thinks it will meet the case. If Fowle*s reply is a categorical negative they would then be p'repared to agree to the second course, 3. I have already explained to you orally our reasons for holding these viev/s. The whole origin of our dispute with the United States Grovernment over this question was that Governments support of the Gulf Oil Company of California, and their suspicion that we were secretly favouring the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The fact that these two competitors have now combined their forces on mutually satisfactory terns means that if the new combine - i.e. Koweit Oil Company - gets the concession there will be no further reasonable cause for dispute, and the United States Government will have no legitimate grievance. I think therefore that if our support of the Koweit Oil Company were at any time called in question, we should be in a very strong position and have an excellent defence, and therefore there seems no reason from the international point of view why we should not frankly and definitely veto the grant of the concession to any Company - whatever its national complexion - other than the Koweit Oil Company. Indeed, by doing this we shall be ensuring that the original object of the United States Government's intervention - i.e 0 that the Gulf Oil Company of California should have an equal chance of participating in the development of Koweit Oil - is adequately met. 4. If on the other hand we make a statement to the Sheikh which implies that he is free to invite any other Company to compete for his oil provided it has a British complexi on/- 3 - complexion, we shall sacrifice vis-a-vis the Americans the. whole strength of our position in giving our specific support to the Koweit Oil Company, and we shall expose ourselves to the accusation of having made conditions based solely on considerations of nationality the effect of which will be to exclude practically all American competitors. This will be a much harder position to defend, since it will be clear that we are no longer observing the principle of the|open door to which in the case cf Koweit the Americans regard us as committed. 5. It is quite true that we are not observing the principle of the open door in Qatar, since we are warning the Sheikh of Qatar that he must not give the concession to any Company which is not at least partially British. But we have never been committed to the open door policy in Qatar and can always reasonably argue to the Americans that Qatar is such a wild and dangerous place that we have feund it necessary to insist on retaining a direct hold of any Company which may operate there. I think this defence is likely to be strengthened rather than weakened if we treat Qatar somewhat differently from Koweit, as we are thus less likely to expose ourselves to the accusation of following a general poltoy of differentiation on national ground^purely for the benent of British as opposed to American enterprise. 6. I gathered from you over the telephone today that owing to a misunderstanding the telegram has already been sent off, and that in view of a later telegram which has now come in from Powle, you do not think there is any possibility of either cancelling it or asking him to suspend action on it. As my higher authorities are prepared in the last resort to accept the second alternative course of action/action proposed in i't, and I unders'tand 'tlxal; your iiigiier authorities felt very strongly that the telegram should go without further amendment, I do not want to press this point further. I hope, however, that you may be willing to consider sending Fowle some urgent supplementary message, passing on to him the substance of the arguments developed above, so as to reduce to a minimum the risk of his giving the Sheikh of Koweit, without its being absolutely necessary to do so, a warning which, even in its present form and even if given only orally, may yet we think, in certain eventualities, give us a good deal of trouble from the international point of view. Tours ever. (SD.) GEORGE EEHDELIndia Office, Immediate. Whitehall, S.W.1. P.2.1659/54 . ISth March 1934. y dear George, Many thanks for your letter of the 8th March, E.lS0l/l6O/91. I am sorry for the misunderstanding about the telegram to the Political Resident on the Koweit oil concession, which I had incorrectly assumed that we had agreed. I The telegram, as I explained, issued on the 7th, 'but we sent ■last night a supplementary telegram asking Powle and Dickson to suspend action (if they have not already taken it) pending receipt of a further telegram. 2. We have carefully considered the views set out in your letter under reply, out we still think that the right course is that suggested in the draft telegram and our reasons are the following. 3. In the first place, we feel that in a matter such as this, we must be guided by Fowle, who on the one hand fully appreciates (for he has copies of all correspondence and has 'been in close touch with us throughout) the possibility of difficulties with the Americans and the point of view held at this end, but who, on the other, is in close personal touch with the Sheikh, knows the local situation and is the best Judge of what is or is not likely to conduce to achieve the ends which we both desire. Fowle has emphatically recommended in the first place that we should not overemphasise the strength of our support for the Koweit Oil Company, because to 40 so would defeat its own ends. Secondly, that it is important ^ give the Sheikh a warning in the terms he suggests that he lo^ aeli i Est1, ' haS// ior 6ign Office S-W.l.2. has not an entirely free hand as regards the disposal of his oil concession. His telegram of 6th March, 287, which was received after our meeting, further emphasises the importance «- C. ' -«—■ of some warning on these lines. 4* We recognise the attractiveness of your suggestion that we should tell the Sheikh in so many words that we will give our consent to the grant of a concession 'by him to no company other than the Koweit Oil Company. But, attractive as this may appear to be, we doubt if it is practical politics. Quite apart from the fact that it would in our view 'be unfair to present the Sheikh with an ultimatum ©f this type (we, have to consider his financial interests and the terms of our treaties with him) and that its effect on our general relations with him might well be veiy embarrassing, we think v/e should probably entirely fail to secure our object. The Sheikh might reply that in the circumstances he would give the concession to no one, and the next stage y/ould oe that in a year t s time or so we should find that he was in close touch with the Standard Oil, had compromised himself with them, and that it would be impossible for us to refuse our approval to the grant of a concession by him to them, a concession, moreover, in connection with which we should not be able to get safeguards anything like as satisfactory .as those which we have got out of the Koweit Oil Company. 5. We fully appreciate the possible difficulties with the United States Government: they have been present to us throughout. But we cannot agree, as I made clear at the meeting, that a warning such as that proposed could give the United States Government any ground for complaint on the basis of the 1932 correspondence, the only pledges in which were that/that we abandoned our right to .require that any concession should be given to an exclusively British company, We have now, 'closed door 1 policy, and it is open to us, on the ground of local conditions, to impose restrictions as to the conditions under which such capital shall operate in the Sheikhdom. In ;any case, even if we were to avoid difd&amp;^ulty on this score in Koweit, we should certainly have to face the issue in the near future in Qatar, and while there may be a difference in the circumstances of the two Sheikhdoms, it is a difference of degree rather than of principle and in any case what critics will look at is the substance of any restriction rather than our special reasons for it. But we should in both cases justify our attitude not, as suggested in paragraph 5 of your letter, on the ground that we are anxious to benefit British as opposed to American enterprise, but on the ground that we hav [special responsibilities in these areas, and that having regard i v... to this we must within reason prescribe the terms on which preign capital or foreign nationals shall be employed in them. ^ For these reasons, we feel strongly that the instruction Itt. our telegram to Fowle of 7th March should be allowed to stand and we regard it as important, in the interests of making |the position clear to the Sheikh, that the Resident should be flowed to make the necessary communication to the Sheikh with as little delay as possible. We trust that in view of the Explanation I have given above you will now be prepared to agree Yours ever, GILBERT LAITHWAITE. as Fowle has pointed out, admitted American capital, and there can be no reasonable suggestion that we are maintaining aV Air Mail. gomimmial .

Further discussion vvith A.P.O.C. and i.p.c. shows that there is little hope of obtaining neutral zone concession from Sheikh of Koweit through Koweit Oil Company, negotiations for Koweit concession being already difficult enough. Koweit Oil Company could not hold concession themselves as neutral zone falls within sphere of I.P.C. for which they could therefore ' only act as agents. 2. I.P.C. are now inclined to. consider that to enter field as third competitor for concession at this stage would merely result in raising the price. They are therefore trying to ascertain on. w hat terms Arabian Development Syndicate would be prepared to act for them.

No*118 of 3rd April 19 34, I have the honour to report somewhat fuller on the question of rental of the Shuwaikh property, as it is diffi cult to express everything one would like to say by means of a cable message, 2. Owing to iiie recent visits of Colonel Ward,and Mr^Sdmonds of the f Iraq Foreign Office followed by the visits of the Mutasarrif of Basra and the American Minister, Baghdad (the second and last of whom stayed in my house) I was obliged to postpone my discussions with the Shaikh in the matter of the rent he was prepared to charge for area (a) Shuwaikh t till the 30th of March and 1st April* 3. Matters were delayed still further by my having to make a rather important and extended tour (some 250 miles in all) on 25th March, when I visited the camps of the large number of Mutair, Awazim, Zab and Adwan tribes who recently were forced to alter Kuwait territory from Nejd owing to ocmplete lack of grazing in their own country* 4® To revert to the question of rental: The Shaikh at my two interviews with him received me with more 'than ^sual courtesy and consideration, but showed distinct reluctanc e- 2 - m reluctance to quote me a figure for tke rent he expected to get from us in the event of the Royal Air ^orce deciding to lease the Shuwaikh site* He pointed out that he looked upon himself and Kuisait as part of the British jJmpire, and when it came to the demanding of rent frcm the Royal Air Force for an area they might require for the possible defence of Kuwait, and the Kuwait Oil Company (should the latter get their concession), he felt faced with a real difficulty,. It was of course up to him to assist, he said, in reducing the rent he would charge to as moderate a figure as he possibly could, seeing that the Royal Air Force were part of the armed forces of His Majesty T s G-overnment etc* etc*, but he felt that if he mentioned any figure at all he might fix on some- thii]g too high and so be accused of ingratitude, or of trying to squeeze money out of His Majesty's G-ovemment* This was the last thing he wanted, and he ?/ould, he said, far prefer that His Majesty's Government, advised by nie , should make him an offer, which would be fair to himself and agreeable to them* Were he dealing with a commercial concern, he added, he would know how t o get the best for himself, but the Royal Air Force was a different proposition* 5^ On my pointing out the unfairness of placing the burden of a decision on His Majesty's Government, the dhaikh turned to me and asked me to fix myself what I thought a suitable and fair rental, assuring me that he had such entire faith in my sense of what was fair, that anything decided on would be acceptable. I ccntinued however to press him for some sort of gi- figure, and eventually the Shaikh reluctantly agreed to £*1200/- per annum* 6* The above figure as I said in my telegram, I do not consider at all excessive, in view of the large and valuable pioperty involved and in view of the fact that the Quarantine buildings would be thrown in also* One must always/- 3 - alifays remember that in 1907, thcxigh I admit circumstances were thai scmewhat different, we leased the same area from Shaikh llubarak for Hs&lt;»60,000 per annum a 7• I of course mentioned to the ShaiMi that the Royal Air Force if indeed they ever took over the site had already agreed to abide by his conditions viz (a) to allow native oraft to use the Shuwaikh harbour: (b) not to interfere with persons using: the Kuwait-Basra road which passes throu^i the property: (c) not to expect him (the Shaikh) t0 ever undertake repairs to the Quarantine buildings• This pleased the Shaiklu 8* What stood out during the whole of our talks, was the fact that the Shaikh appeared genuinely anxious to assist and make things as easy as possible for the Royal Air Force n for the simple reason that they were part and parcel of King George's fighting forces and so protectors of Kuwait' (his words) ► It is therefore not improbable that in the event of the figure £1200/- being coisidered excessive by the Air Ministry, I might be able to get the Shaikh to agree to a sligjitly further reduction. I, naturally however, would not like to try and beat him down further as it would rather savour of my trying to take an unfair advantage of his expressed loyalty t o His Majesty*s Government. I think also that the Shaikh t s feelings would be considerably hurt, were I to try and beat him down farther.

Opportunity should arise when Saudi Government communicate to you California Company's reaction to Syndicate's proposals if not earlier. if (2) above is correct Syndicate would of course disappear from negotia tion with Saudi Government, If (l) is correct there might still be advantage in Iraq Petroleum Company reaching arrangement with Syndicate though they are not anxious to do so, Pending elucidation of this point therefore you should adopt non-committal attitude regarding Syndicate if Saudi Government repeats enquiry as to His Majesty's Government * a/f -2- Government' s opinion of its status. Anglo-Persian Oil Company hope that negotiations for Kuwait concession are approaching conclusion, when HOLMES will leave Kuwait» British group in Iraq Petroleum Company therefore now favour attempt immediately there after to secure grant of Heutral 'one concession from Shaikh for Iraq Petroleum Company on lines of suggstion in last paragraph of your telegram 39 or option on concession similar t© that held 'by California Company from Ihn Saud. If deadlock ensued Iraq Petroleum Qompany might possibly fee ahle to make some bargain with California Company. Iraq Petroleum Company feel however that they cannot approach Shaildi until Kuwait concension is secured. Importance of time factor and difficulty of your position vis a vis Saudi authorities have 'been impressed on me. Ifou may inform Saudi Government in reply to enquiry in 2nd paragraph of your telegram 51 that approach should 'be from Saudi Government to His Majesty's Government. It is impossible especially in present obscure state of matters to give direct answer to enquiry in your telegram. Moreover a positive declaration at this stage that California Company would be objectionable might give Saudi Government opportunity to put onus of refusal to grant concession to them upon His Majesty's Goverrment. Best reply would be that His Majesty's Government Wild naturally prefer British Company. Question of affording protection to concessionary company and of exercising jurisdiction in concession area will be one of great difficulty. Ideal would be that protection should be/g) -3- 'be assumed 'by His Majesty^ Government on 'behalf of 'both Rulers; but it is presumably unlikely that ibn Saud's consent could 'be secured. It is premature to raise question with him at this stage; 'but 1 invite your observations and you should take an early opportunity of informing Saudi Government that it would of course be necessary before any concession were granted that agreement should be reached between the two Governments and Shaikh in regard to method of carrying out in Neutral Zone administrative measures that exploration of concession would necessitate. - SSCRSTAH^ OF STATS TOR FORKLGN AFFAIRS -CONFIDENTIAL.

I have not seen the shaikh since the receipt of His liajesty's Secretary of State for India's telegram No. 963, and of course have taken no pending receipt orders from you» ^ 5. I am a little bit anxious however, lest the Shaikh when I do eventually deliver His Majesty^ Government's message to him, may take things rather unkindly and possibly try and do something rash such as closing, dorni all further negotiationsavoid all chances of aich a contingency, I propose approaching the matter very cautiously in the first place, and if I find the Jhaikh reasonable and receiving what I say well, 1 shall go full speed ahead* 60 One must admit, I think, that the Shaikh (who like all Nejdis is most suspicious and. proud by nature) cannot but have felt that he has been rather scurvily treated, if we impartially examine the dates on Y /hich the various documents and amendmesits were submitted to him. These read as follows: (a) On 22nd February the Commercial Agreement is given to him. (b) On 10th ^pril he is asked by the Kuwait Oil Company to introduce two further and important Articles into the Commercial agreement, after he bas discussed and thrashed out every single item, time and again over a period of several weeks with l.Iessrs: Chisholm and Holmes and never been given an inkling that further new articles would be introduced. (c) Lastly after being carefully told by yourself and me that the Political Agreement would follow the Commercial ^igreement with as little delay as possible, he is only given it on 12th April. 6. What apparently also added to the Shaikh's |iique was the fact that the Company's representatives made out to him that the. articles were being inserted by the Company'sCompany's wish, Mien in reality it was His I.:ajesty T s Government's desire that they should be put in. Had the negotiators told him the truth at the time, I do not think the Shaikh would have thrown out the proposed articles as he did. 7. If the shaikh receives my^approach** conversation in a sensible and'r easonab le manner (that is to say if I get him in good mood) I think I shall have little difficulty in talking him round to His I-lajesty T s Government's point of view, but ±t will be necessary, I think, to avoid anything: of a 'minatory' or 'big stick' attitude if I am to be success ful. ^ 8.

As regards the other points that we have already explained to you, we feel their insertion in the Agreement necessary, therefore ?/hen you have done accordingly please submit your Concession Agreement for our observation and we shall sign it if we would find its terms agreeable and accppt- able to us. In conclusion may G-od save you. Yours sincerely, Signature of H.E. the shaikh./ i 2 vr 1^3 ) GCilinDll&lt;HALi tueWiKF RE&amp;OSNCY 7^' .'CLiiT GAL Aamcr f C-12S. n viph V Villi.

(a) Major Holmes informed me after the Minister's departure that Mr.Knabenshue T s Secretary at a luncheon party 'iven in my house,, asked him about the 'Red Line Agreement', and whether Kuwait could not be properly considered as falling within same. M^jor Holmes said that he 'rode him off' tactfully, and gave an evasive reply# (in this ccnnection see foreign Off ice,London No.123, dated 22.3.34 to oir, Percy Loraine, Bart., K .C.UG. etc., iuigora). (b) Mr .Knabenshue, on more occasions than one took the trouble to emphasize to me rather more strongly than appeared necessary that his visit to the G-uli and especially to Bahrain and Kuwait was entirely unconnected with Oil, thougti some people seemed to think it was. (c) Mr .Knabenshue , before he left, asked my advice as to what would be the best course for him to follow, should 3in Saud either die or have a reverse or defeat in emen, when presumably there would be a period of chaos in the interior, which would certainly endanger the lives of American Geologists anddrillers working; in the hinterland of Eassa.

Included within the volume are copies of both the draft concession agreement, in Arabic and English, (folios 16-27) and copies of the political agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Kuwait Oil Company (folios 57-65, 71-80 and 83-84) as well as correspondence regarding particular clauses within both agreements. Also included are records of interviews between Harold Dickson, Political Agent Kuwait, and the Shaikh of Kuwait, 25-26 February 1934, discussing the Shaikh's thoughts on the draft concession presented to him (folios 28-35). The Kuwait Oil Company's negotiations were handled by Major Archibald Chisholm and Major Frank Holmes.The British Government's concerns over an oil concession for the Nejd-Kuwait Neutral Zone, and particularly the possibility of an American company receiving the concession from the Saudi Government. The correspondence is primarily between the Foreign Office, India Office and the British Legation at Jedda and seeks to determine what the position is between the Saudi Government and the two interested parties in the Neutral Zone concession: the Standard Oil Company of California and the Arabian Development Syndicate. Also included in the volume are records of two meetings held at the India Office between Sir Louis Kershaw, Deputy Under Secretary of State, and representatives of the Foreign Office, Admiralty, India Office and Petroleum Department to discuss the oil concession in the Neutral Zone, ways of attempting to ensure that British owned company secures the concession, and the difficulties of jurisdiction and protection of employees within the zone itself (folios 89-97 and 125-128).Correspondence between the Air Ministry, Air Officer Commanding , the Political Agent Kuwait and the Shaikh of Kuwait regarding the lease of three sites within Kuwait: two at Jahra and Subaihiya [Şubayḩīyah] for use as landing grounds and one at Shuwaikh for use as an air base. The correspondence includes details of how the three sites are to be used and the conditions which the Shaikh of Kuwait places on their lease.The volume also contains file notes (folios 220-225) which list each individual item of correspondence received and its date.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian Development Syndicate Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Archibald Hugh Tennent Chisholm</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shuwaikh </geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait-Nejd Neutral Zone</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000268#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
