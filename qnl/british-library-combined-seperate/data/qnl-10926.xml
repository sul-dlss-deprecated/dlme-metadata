The question arose from the fact that Persia did not recognise British nationality in persons of Persian descent. In particular, it references the case of Agha Mehdee; a person of Persian descent who has enjoyed British subject status for a number of years. His status as a British subject is accepted by the Government of Persia, but they do not consider this to be a precedent to be conferred on others. The attitudes of France and Russia towards their subjects are considered in order to inform the British position on the matter. The papers included are outlined below.A letter (No. 1, folios 96-100) from William Taylor Thomson, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia, to Edward Henry Stanley, Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated Tehran 15 February 1876, with the following enclosures:1.
