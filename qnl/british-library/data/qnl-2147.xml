The Allied victories over Germany and Japan were both warmly welcomed. In the Khorranshahr area the American Forces completed their evacuation of Persia by moving out on 30th December* By that date the Iranian Naval base at fthorrarshahr had been returned by the British Navy to the Persian Government and the transfer of responsibility for security from the British to the Persian forces had reached an advanced stage. 2 # The 1145 grain harvest in the Douth was a good \ one and the date harvest was also plentiful. Prices however did not drop and the assistance to the needy given by the local branch of the Anglo-Persian Hellef and Reconstruction Fund fulfilled a real need* and the British share in it earned wide praise. 3 # In July the peace of the districts of Hiat Daud, Lirawi and Rud Hilleh was disturbed by a dispute between Fathullah Khan Hlat Daud and hohammed Ali Birawif which was still unsettled at the close of the year. Insecurity prevailed in Dashti and in Dashtistan. Tang- istan, however, remained secure due to the firm and ruthless methods of Rais Ali Tangistani (Chapiri). i 4 # In September the Bushire Shahristan was I separated from that Pars and brought directly under Tehran, a reform which will help considerably in improving i the standard of the local administration. 5. Relations with the Governor of Bushire and the Heads of local departments were excellent throughout the year. 6. The security of the Bushire-Shiraz road remained on the whole good. / 7.2 2 « 3 © 7. A new American Financial adviser, a Ur.John W. Phillips was appointed, a tremendous improvement on his predecessor who had secured an unenviable reputation for corruption. The American military personnel in this area were agreeable and cooperative. 8* H.K. Sir Header Bullard paid a visit to Bushire in April. 'i Arab aide. 9. Oil. The Kuwait Oil Company comrenced operations planned on an export programme of 30,000 barrels of crude oil a day. By the end of the year much progress had been made and the jtaff had greatly increased. The Bahrain Oil Company produced an average of 20,000 barrels a day. The construction of a causeway, pier and wharves to permit the direct hunkering of ocean going ships at Sitra was air ost completed by the end 6f the year. With the end of the war the large scale refining of high octane aviation spirit ceased. Petroleum Concessions Ltd., restarted work in Qatar and are putting into operation a heavy drilling and production progra ;: e. In harch they obtained an oil concession fron the Huler of Umn al Qaiwain. exploration in the Truclal Coast area was planned for the Winter of 1946-46. 10* Air . The Trooping Transit Bcheme resulted in heavy military air traffic throughout the year along the Arab Coast. In May the U.3.A. Air Transport Command ceased operating from « aerodromes in Luscat territory which were, however, continued to be operated by the Royal Air Force. There was a large There was a large /increasei 3 increase in the services of the British Overseas Airways l Corporation but owin£ to service priorities and the pref erence given to long distance travellers* passages from the Persian Gulf were difficult to obtain. No final decision was reached about a new aerodrome at Bahrain, and air officers commanding continued to change with bewildering rapidity. 11. Paiforce . Lieutenant General Sir Arthur Smith, General Officer Commanding in Chief Paiforce paid a visit to Bushire in April on his way to Bhiraz. Such problems as arose with Paiforce were rapidly and smoothly settled with his assistance. 12. Navy . Our relations with the Navy remained as ex cellent as ever, but the number of war ships suffered a severe reduction. 13. Education . Kducational activity in Bahrain and Kuwait were much hampered by the failure of the British Council to provide a Director of Education. The Kuwait Government opened a hostel in Cairo for their students. Several Egyptian teachers were engaged by Kuwait and Bahrain. The indulging in propaganda by some of them suggests that the action of the Egyptian Government in paying half their salaries is not wholly altruistic. 14. cprasr^lal* The end of the war brought little relief to * trade as few of the manifold restrictions in force had been lifted by the end of the year, and shiping space continued to be scarce. Steamer communication in the Gulf was in adequate and irregular. 15. The Imperial Bank of Iran at Kuwait continuea . /toto do a flourishing business* The business of the newly opened branch in^Jahrain showed a steady increase and its competition with the long established Eastern 3ank was beneficial to trade, and may have been the cause of the Americans not proceeding with the proposal to open a branch of the National City Bank at Dhahran* At the end of the year the Imperial Bank of Iran was considering the opening of branches at Dubai and Muscat. 16. Food rationing and price control measures were enforced with success throughout the year in all the Shaikhdons. 17. Despite the fact that the Indian Post Office at Bahrain was making a monthly profit of some Es. 9000/- staff, accommodation and furniture were kept far below the standard required for bare efficiency, in fact the Bahrain Oil Company volunteered to provide the necessary furniture free of charge, an offer which was scarcely flattering to the Indian Postal Administration. IB. The number of boats that put out to the pearl banks was small but the catch was good and high prices prevailed. BSE 19. Great pressure was brought to bear by the Bahrain ' L j . Oil Company to be allowed to undertake their own lightering, which would have been a very serious blow to Messrs Gray Mackenzie. The latter firm had Invited such action by their general inefficiency but at the close of the year their monopoly was still intact and some improvement promised. 20. Foreign Interests. The State Department appear to be attaching a growing importance to the United Utates Consular post at / Dhahran. It was raised to the status of a Consulate during the year and the Consul's informal jurisdiction was extended /toto Uuscat* Qatar and the Truela1 Coast* Cordial relations ware maintained between the Bahrain Agency and the Consulate) and in January the Consul accompanied the Political Agent* Bahrain, on a tour of the Trucial Coast* 21. i£ifi£&amp;£* The tfultan of Muscat arrived at Muscat from Dhofar in May and remained there for the rest of the year. I The serious illness of the Imam has given His Highness the opportunity of taking measures to fulfil his long cherished ambition of re-establishing the authority of his dynasty over the hinterland* He has established contacts with j several tribal leaders of the interior, aiid towards the end of the year requested the assistance of His Majesty’s Governr.ent in carrying out his plans. His pleasure at the receipt of the G*C.I*4* was marred by the description of him by the as an Indian Prince* 22 . The summer was one of the utmost severity and the plight of the population of Bahrain was not improved by the frequent failure of the electric supply owing to deterioration cf the existing plant and the difficulty of obtaining replacements. 3d.

This reform has already led to a considerable improvement in the loca administration of justice. Formerly the local court wa* a Petty Court (Dndgah-i-Bakhsh) every decision of which had to be refer red for decision to tihiraz, whereas it has now become a Court of First Instance (dadgah-i-Chnhristan) which can decide and pass judgement on any case brought be Pore it. ShCTIOK III . qoiiMUracATlP^. (a) hand . The main road to Shiraz, in spite of receiv ing little attention from the Persian Hoad Department, was up to the end of the year, in fairly ood condition. The main road between Sabzabad and tiushire town is still in deplorable condition. The Road Department made a half-hoartad attempt to repair it in October, but the earth with which they filled the worst pot-holes was wash ed away by th* first winter storm. During August, September and October a number of lorries travelling be tween Burazjan and bhiraz were held up and robbed. (bi boa . Owing to the withdrawal from service in the Gulf of the ,, Risang , \ ,, Wobsang ,, , and ,, T8inan ,, , the steamer situation during the year became worse than ever, and on the average only one slow mail steamer per month called at Bushire. A.I.O.C. tugs continued to assist in providing a means of communication with Khorramshahr. (c) AiE* The K.A.F. continued to maintain the Bushlre airfield. From the beginning of Hay Irapiour planes maintained a weekly service between Bushlre and Tehran via Shiraz and Isfahan. These planes can carry four assen# / 5 . •- 6 - gers in addition to the mails. In accordance with the proposal made by this Consulate General, the extension of the landing ground at Asalu (referred to in the Administration Report for 1944) has been completed. (d) Telegraphs . At the request of the local autho rities, the Persian Wireless station In Bushire was in September unsealed by s Consul in the presence of the feting Governor, and formally handed back to the Persian Post and Telegraph Department. On the occasion of the handing back of the transmitter cordial messages were exchanged, through H.W's Consul, between the Persian authorities and Cable and Wireless Ltd., Bushire. sKmo py tbibal AND .POLITICAL (a) Mat Baud. Llravl end Rud Hillah . Peace reigned throughout this area until July, when i ohammad All Llravi made a sudden descent from Zal- dun upon Hisar fort* which ^as in the possession of Fath- ullah Khan Hiat Daurii, and, in contravention of the terms of the agreement aimed by Uohaiwad All in November 1944, occupied the fort. The Persian Military authorities then proceeded to send two columns, one from Shiraz and one from Khusistan, to expel Mohamrad All from the fort. As soon as the Khuzistan column had reached Hisar and occupied it, the Officer Commanding ©C this detachment proceeded to a point about 9 miles to the South East of Hisar, there a lively little battle had taken place between the Shiraz column and Mohammad 411*8 men. The Officer Commanding the Khuzistan column being senior to the comsiander of the Pars column ordered the latter to withdraw.••• / 6 .- 6 - withdraw his troops f which he did - at first to Gana- wah, and later to Shiraz. Fathullah Khan Hiat Daudi proceeded to Tehran in August to complain to the Persian civil and military authorities at Mohamad Ali hiravi's unwarranted occu pation of hisar fort, and at the way in which the Officer Commanding the Khuxlstan column had sided with Mohammad Ali. The only result of x^athullah Khan 1 a complaints in Tehran were that another military detachment, this time from Xazerun was seat to occupy Ganawah, which is the most important port in tho Kiat Daud area, with instructions to disarm tho hiat uaudis. The Khuzistan column, which was still in occupation of Hisar had orders to carry out a parallel disarmament of the adherents of hohammad Ali Liravi, who, however, had few arms to surrender. As a result Fathullah Khan not only lost possession of his fort at Hisar, but was deprived of over 80 rifles, and was put to much loss by the exactions of a iiarwan (Captain) Urdubadi, who was in command of the Kazerun detachment which carried out the disarmament of the Iliat Daud - Hud Hilleh erear At the end of the year the question of whether ♦ Fathullah .lhan was to be allowed to re-occuoy Hisar fort was still undecided. The Khuzistan column was still in occupation of the fort but the Kazerun de tachment had in November returned to Kazerun. (b) Pashtlstan. So great was the insecurity caused by feuds between the leading factions of Burazjan that in Septem ber a special detachment of the Persian army had to be quartered in the town. Though security had greatly improved, the troops were still stationed in BurazJ an at the end of the year. (c) Tangistan A.and social spheres continued to be very friendly. The Allied VActories over both Germany abd Japan were warmly welcomed, and V.E.DAy particularly, was celebrated with marked enthusiasia in Bushire town. The bazaars were decorated and illuminated, and the leading officials and -enchants gave entertainments in honour of the occasion. Receptions, to which all British subjects as well as the leading Persian officials and notables were invited, were held at the Residency to celebrate V.fi.Day and (in the absence, on recess of the Consul-General),at the Consul's house in honour of V.fl.Day. -Iki Anglo Pers ian Reading Boon Club . s The Anglo Persian Reading Room Club has, if any thing increased in popularity. In anticipation of a reduction in the publicity budget, on the conclusion of the War, arrangements were made with the Committee of the Club to put the Reading Room on a more or less self- supporting basis. As a result by the end of the year the whole expense of maintaining the Reading Room, with the exception of the cost of electric light, was being met from the subscriptions of the members of the Reading Room ^lub. i ! oreover the Club me bers agreed to bear more than half the cost of repairing and white washing the club premises, which was carried out early in the Summer. An evening reception for the members of the Reading Room Club was held at the Reading Room by H.Mfcs Consul to celebrate the Final Victory. The Reading Room Club at Lingah continued to flourish # and by the end of the year its membership had increased to 80 . The Borazjan Reading Room continued to be well attended. The quality and quantity of the magazines sent for distribution in the 8ush'.re qrea was satisfactory. The supply of periodicals from India was generally slow/10 &lt; u ^ ' and erratic. (c) Clnernaa . A IGia/m projector was supplied early in the year, and with this bi-weekly shows were given in the local , schools during, term tirce throughout the year. The 35!n/ia projector continued to do very useful work both in Bushire and in the villages further inland. The projector was also taken by sea to the port of uananweh, whore a cinema show had never previously been seen. A film show wtis arranged for tie members of the Heading boom Club, once a week throughout the year, except during koharram. (d) ,'.r.?lo Persian Holier and fteconstr.uctl&lt;m, J&amp;nd . The Anglo- Persian Kolief ano heconstruction Fund continued to do extremely useful work throughout the year. It supported at the Caravanserai Shakari 85 paupers who would otnerwise have been begging in the streets. A.P.R. R.F. medicines were dispensed free of charge to largo numbers of sick people in the towns and villages of the Bushire area, where no medical service is provided either by the Persian Government or by any private medical pract itioner. During the course of 66 expeditions made 6/ the Mobile Dispensary during the year to villages outside Bushire, a total of more than 9000 sick were treated. The balance of the cloth purchased from India by the ^ocol committee of the A.P.n.rt.F. was distributed per sonally by H.t *s Consul In Borasjan, Ahrara, Ganaweh, baadabad, Darwahi and behkoneh. A distribution of cloth was also made at hingeh. As the poor in this area have been unable to buy any cloth during the past five years, the free distribution of cloth through the A.P.R.H.F. has been greatly welcomed, and our action in helping bo^h to cure and clothe the poor has been widely praised.- 10 - \b® IRCTIOa VI . (a) &gt;ereals. As a result of the bumper wheat harvest the Persian Government were able in Kay to discontinue the rationing of wheat, and for the first time for many years large quantit ies of wheat and barley wore brought into Bushire from the surrounding countryside for sale in Bushire town. (b) ih fi vh ft' p .p fla K ar a II Ixi Owing to a lack of funds and apparently,', a lack of intere.it on the part of the Agricultural Department, this project has made no progress. There are many square miles of prairie in the Ghabanakareh area which at present support only rough grass, and in places a sparse wheat crop, which could be made to bear a heavy whaat crop if the half-fin- v ishad canal which runs from iaadabad in tne direction of V. Deh Khoneh were to be completed, and if tne land thereby brought under irrigation were to be properly cultivated. At present the land to which canal water has bean brought is most inefficiently farmed by the original cultivators of the arsa, who still use an old-fashioned plough, quite unsuitable for irrigated soil. unfortunately it et present appears very doubtful wnetner tne Persian Government will ever achieve the double goal of completing the canal and training the cultivators how to fam it pronerly. Owing to a lack of funds no progress has been made by the Persian Government /with the proposal to utilize the water of the Mund river for Irrigation purposes. (c) S ea. Jugar and .'ieco-Koods , The oonoply for the sale and distribution of tea and sugar remained in the hands of the Persian Government. In Bushire town these commodities are distributed by coupon. The tea and sugar for the areas outside Bushire continued to be handed over to the Halses, who sell most of the allotment for their villages in the Black Market. Al.- 11 - In March th« Persian Government m?»de a general distributianof cotton cloth on a basis of 3 s tres per person. The cloth, however, was only suitable for women's wear, and in an/ case little or any of it reached people living in villages outside of Bushire . In November the Persian Government abolished the piece-goods wonoply, and merchants, were at the end of the year free to import cloth. (d) Owing to plentiful rain d uring the winter of 1^44- 45 the 1*46 harvest was the bfsst for 23 years. The -ri-M v- i.i— mi[ — -y --- ii ; I,'ji L autumn rains were very late, and ploughing could not be started till mid December. Tha rain which fell then, however, was sufficient to encourage the hope of an average Tssotf crop in 1^46. The date crop w* s also good, and the price of dates wns lo^er then it has be*n at any tine since 1^39. Si-:CT;OU VII.

The main Imports werr tea, sugar, pieco-ggods etc.; the main exports consisted of gum tragacanth, gua arable, •attari', assofoetida, wool and carpets. (b) Owing to the great diminution of steamer traffic in the Gulf, the owners of country craft have been enjoy* ing a period of great prosperity. Dhows carry cargoes of rice, potatoes, dried fruits, walnuts, ghee etc., to ports on the Arab Coast, whence under a recognized system of barter, they bring bac* tea, sugar and piece-goods.

December, 1944 to June, 1945 !• The period under review ha&amp; been epecially notable ae a period of peace and security* This, in a 'tribal* province, ie a remarkable record and an Administrative. 5 achievement that should be kept in mind when reading the account of local bickering that f oliowS• 2* Pars has three outstanding personalities who could be a powerful influence for good if they all worked together for the public weal or a powerful influence for bad jf they all seek only their own personal ends* The men in (iuestion are ;avam ul Hulk who setcie blindly determined to play the part of the viIlian of the place. General Firuz th$ Governox-General who is the often ineffective fairy gggatmaiflflx godmother and Kuhammad Naair Khan &gt; the impetuous and directionless leader of the ^ash^ai who thinks he has the one true claim to fill the role of hero* 3* tfaftir Khan is wh^t fate has made him,. That is he was born the eldest son of a tyrannical tribal leader with an anti-British reputation, he suffered imprisonment under Aeza Shan and saw his father die (of natural causes) under restraint* When the Allies entered Persia in 1942 Haair Khan escaped to hi a native mountains where (at least mentally) he has remained ever tince and where he is at a complete lose to know what to do next or to work out where he stands* The facts that on the one hand he and his family claim to have made approaches to us over a period of years and to have have received little or no encouragement and on the other hand that in addition to their record during the la a' war they received German parachutists in the present war do not help N&amp;sir to define his position and to fix on seme safe and sure line of policy for the future* He wants to get on our side and so has become reconciled to ^avam ul i’ulk but heither of them trusts the other and the alliance is not likely to be a lasting one* 4. ^av&amp;m ul Hulk is Known, too well in Fara, as the faithful friena of the British* This is a r putatinn of which v^avam has taken the fullest advantage in the pursuit of his own ends* He has not been above implying that « consuls come and go in Shiraz according to whether they suit him, that he has access when required to bimbasay archives and that he receives his directions straight from London. Because his hearers are eager to win out support and have never heard the lie given to his pretentions, qavam is able to get his implications of British backing accepting in general by all classes of people through out the lengbt^and breadth of 1 ars and in particular by persons such as Kasir ^ashqai and political parties such ae the Hfzb &gt;emocrat ( which represents the bazaar of Shiraz and hag a backing of big proprietors and landowners)• 5* The l^st twenty years stem to have taught ^avam nothing and he is now perhaps past learning. He is a rich man and a mean one* ne is as public spirited as a fecial oaron and his ultimate aim sterns to be the increase of his own wealth and influence* K€ is, as the Tudeh Itrly says, a frtnk reactionary and, as such, a millstone around our neck. 6* Between the uneasy bedfellows, ^avam xakJt&amp;Kg x ul Hulk and Hasir _,achqai stands Geaferal iruz unuettrmined and unhappy. He cannot forget that a&amp; a ^ajar prince he is a superior person and yet he sjufffra frori the inferiority complex that he does not enjoy our complete co fidence. Firuz is generally held to ce weak because he is anxiouc to ^laa^c everyone. a stronger man than Firuz would have called qavam’S bluff long ago* But we arer 2 . in no position to criticise Firuz because his weakness largely a ises from uncertainty as to the amount of support C)avam enjoys from us. Whatever his past Firuz, too. claims that he wishes to work with us but lacks precise directives. 1 7. The results of Qavam*s arrival in Shiraz as the self- appointed champion of freedom defending Fans against the Russians onslaught have not been very happy. Qavam seems to have made up his mind that the Dest form of defence is attack with the result that he got mixed up in a very unrewarding newspaper campaign that resulted in much mud being slung at him and aimed at us. This profited only the four Tudeh youths that formed the opposition to Qavam and were delight d at the importance thus given to themselves.and the publicity they obtained. From his press campaign Qavam preceded to some violent Quarrelling with the Gov rnor-General in which he was backed and encouraged by Khosru Qashqai, tfasir Khan's youngest brother and irresponsible and even vicious youth with a capacity for mischief which there seems to be no bounds. By associating himself with and suffering himself to be guided by Khosru (ashaai Qavam lost much face locally, . i’he ^ovuinor-General claims to be as alive as Qavam to the Russian menace but believes that the greatest immunity from the infiiteration of communistic ideas can be secured by improving the lot of the poor by for instance undertaking works of public utility than by embarking on polemics. Luring his term of office General Firuz has opened the so-called 100 bed hospital housed local orphans in new surroundings and provided a new permanent home for beggars. He has also laid the foundation stone of a nev. mediccil school that is to open within three months a nd is intended to provide a supply of doctors for work in outlying village^where at the present moment no medical attention is obtainable. The Governor-Generalhas tried to increase the consump tion of oil fuel In place of the charcoal and firewood the use of which is responsible for the deforestation of this form^Cly well wooaed province. As a result too of consular intervention a number Oi the a. I.O.G. distributing centres that had seen closed owing to the £ar have been rsoponed. The comoletei1st is now ; Afceats * Fasa, Jahrun; Listrioutlng Jentresj Sarvistan, Istahbanat. Darab, Niriz, Abr Qun, Ardekan, Firuzabad. Most of the bakeries in ^Thiraz have now changed over from wood to oil fuex. Increased use of oil fuel in bakeries throughout the province is retarded by the high cost of installing the necessary burners. 10. Progress has also bten made under the encouragement of General riruz with various local water schemes. Two British engineers have collected on the spot data for the preparation of a plan for piping the ^hiraz town water supply. It looks as if thi.. project will materialize. A not her scheme under active consideration is that to dam the ?lood waters of the Shesh Fir springs and valley behind a convenient gorge and so provide a reserve store of water for the irrigation of the iraz plain in Summer. This scheme ii it goes through should render service to agriculture and encourage local interests to go ahead with similar schemes in the Mervdasht (Persepoiis) plain, at Fasa and at Firuzabad. 11. The crash in price levels that was cxpecte-d to follow the end of the v r in Europe did not take lace. The bazzaar has remained buoyant and there have been no bankruptcies to undermine confidence. The tendency of prices is to fall but the downward movement has been extremely slow. lb• 'V.E” Day fell during the period under review but it can scarcely be said to have caused any considerable stir among the loc 1 population.

J &gt;KJKb British Consulate, Shiraz* July dSth, 194£&gt;./ ws s a.. • CONS!JLAT£ T SHIRAZ Appreciation of local conditions. July to December, 1945. The last six months of 1945 saw a change of holder in the post of Governor-General of Fars. General Firuz who had left Shiraz for Tehrap in June last rather than stand up to his opponents sat in the capital fcr some months apparently in the hope that these same opponents would ask hi* to come back. They were unrepentant and after the names of many possible successors had been mentioned Firuz was replaced towards the end of December by Farrukh. Immediately prior to his appointment to Shiraz Farrukh had been appointed Governor-General in Tabriz but did not proceed to this post as he was unacceptable to the Russians. 2. Qavam ul Mulk had been the chief opponent of Firuz and it was now the turn of the Qashqai to come freward as chief opponents of Farrukh. They declared objection to Farrukh was that he was hasty- tempered. But they also saw in him a survival of the Pahlevi regime (he previously served under Pahlevi as Covernor^General of Fars) and a further objection was that Farrukh was a friend of Kuadel, the Shiraz deputy who is a particular enemy of Khosru Qashqai. Opposition to Farrukh was general and not limiued to the Qashqai and his appointment is said to have been at the insistence of the Shah. Farrukh is said to be able and honest but rough in his handling of people. 3. The arrival of Farrukh coincided with a serious deterioration of the position in Azerbaijan sc that the end of the year saw Qavam and the consulate attempting to persuade the Qashqai that it was in the interests of Persia that Farrukh, whom they wanted to chase away, should stay and thus give the Russians no opportunity of saying that there was unrest in Fars as well as in Azerbaijan. Behind the Qashqai objections to Farrukh lies their ambition to be the Warwicks of Fars. 4. The absehce of a Governor-General for more than six months had a serious effect on the administration particularly from the point of view of grain collection and distribution of monopoly goods. Already before the withdrawal of the last British officer seconded for grain collection landlords were refusing to sign fresh contracts for deli- ' varies from the next harvests and even to honour contracts signed for deliveries of grain from the last harvest. Shiraz, in consequence, started t*?e winter with an empty silo and nothing better than hand- to-meuth arrangements to ensure the supply of bread to the town. 5. Continued scandals marked the administration of the department responsible for the distribution of monopoly goods and embraced an inspector specially sent down from Tehran to enquire into the situat ion. Distribution of monopoly goods was grossly defective and generally months in arrear. 6. The newspaper editor appointed as Mayor by General Firuz from outside the usual cadre in the hope that a local man would study local Interests and please the populace soon became the object of complaints that went as far as the Imperial Court and legal proceedings were commenced against him. The fact that he was penniless when he took over the job and at the end of the year was building himself a new house was, even if no other evidence existed, weighty evidence against him. The Municipality remained behindhand in payment of wages, in debt, without a budget and apparently unable to get funds even for essential services. 7. The lack of a Governor-General had very much less effect on the armed forces than on the civil administration. In fact as Firuzwas a Major-General his departure freed the commanders of the Army and Gendarmerie from the restraint that his higher rank placed upon them, 8* Brigadier Khosrudad who commands the Ger.darmerxC is o rogue but doubtless no worse th&lt;-n any other Persian officer simx.iorly placed (it is said in his excuse that he is constantly su^ect to pressure to send greater and greater pickings to Tehran)• From our point of view he has the advantage of being pleasant with and apparently anxious to co-opernte. The tribes' objection to him is that he has been in Fars so xong that he knows not only all the ropes but all the tricks as well* 9. In colonel Himmat the army has an officer of ability, out standing honesty and devotion to his duties and a reputation for courage in the field. His extensive knowledge and experience of Pars and of its tribes stand him in good stead. There is an armed truce between him and the Qashqai but the tribes without exception speak of Himmat with respect. 10. The (^ashqai in particular stood to gain by the general pardon of the tribes in Pars announced by the Sheh but the effect of this act of clemency was overshadowed by the turn of events in the north. 11 . The Khamseh, who are the smaller of the two larger groups of tribes in Pars, have been well-behaved. Under their new supervisor, the Governor of Fasa,(a relative of Qavara ul Mulk) their conditions of life and general outlook have improved. By this good handling of Khamseh affairs the Supervisor has built hiraself such a reputation that he claims he could disarm and settle the Khamseh without any difficulty. It is a pity that the Government are unable or not sufficiently interested to produce the money to cover the cost of settling the Khemseh and so net only make a start in tackling the question of the migratory tribes but also make it sagaciously. The Khamseh are not rich encuvh to settle themselves. Qavam ul Mulk might be induced to put up the necessary money but the ob^e ction to turning to Qavam for assistance is that it would strengthen the hold on the tribe that he has particularly been able to resume through the appointment and good work of the supervisor. 12. The Qashqai, who are the other main tribal group in Pars, but greater and richer than the Khamseh, have had their loyalty to their leader, Nasir Khan Qashqai, assailed but managed to maintain it unimpaired. The first attack on laser's position came from his uncld Ali Khan, his uncle's two son® Chengiz and Amir Mansur and from the sons of another uncle, Sardar Jthtesham. These severally went out in tribal country but seem to have enlisted little or no support and so could whip up no real challenge to Naser's authority. But Naser, who, wrongly attributed their activities to spurrings from the Government and from beyyed Zia seems to have been sufficiently moved to consider buying them off. 13. A second and much more serious challenge to his position arose from Naser's sending an impetuous telegram to the Prime Minister saying that in disgust at the Government's suppression of newspapers, parties, associations and freedom in general he renounced his leader ship of the ^ashqai. Naser's telegram gave tne general impression that he had gone over to the Russians because the newspapers and parties suppressed were Tudeh. But jthe later corrected this impress ion and quickly changed his mind about leading the Qashqai &amp;hen his uncle iili Khan said he would assume &lt;harge in Naser's place. ^ a f® r was obliged to beat up the kalantars to wire Tehran to say that they would have none other than him. His telegram was a further source of embarrassment to Naser when the situation in Azeroa..Jan started boiling up and he was then at some pains to convince Tehran of his loyalty. 14. In general the conditions of the Qashqai show improvement. / The3 The consulate has lost no opportunity of urging the Qashqai to settle and the summer of 1945 saw 500 more Darrehshuri families settling permanently in the summer quarters thus making a total there of S 1 ? 000 families• Maser Khan, who 3s building a school in Firuzabad, put the public bath there in working order and proposes to build a hospital, has produced a plan for large scale settlement at Baigjin on the Piruzabad plain 10 miles from Firuzabad. He has been strongly encouraged tc go ahead with this plan. 16. Kaser Khan overcame his fe;rs and presented himself to the Shah in July thus returning tc Tehran for the first time since he fled from the detention in which the Shales father placed him. 16. The remaining tribal groups in Pars, the Mamassani and Doshmanziari, have kept quiet. Hossein Qoli Rostam who leads the ftfamassane seems tc have few friends and to be lacking in the sincerity that makes friends. He has however managed to keep the Qashqai off his lands. 17. The Boir Ahmedi, who only partially come into the provincial picture, have maintained their reputation as thieves and raiders and at one period penetrated as far as the Isfahan- Shiraz road near Abadeh. The Gendarmerie took appropriate steps in the general and the Darrehshuri took steps in their own interest with the result that the Boir Ahmedi withdrew. Apart from this incident and a short break in the early summer (attributable to the absence of a Governor-General) security on the roads has been well maintained. 18. Relations of the province with Tehran have not improved. The Shah, who has only once been to Fars and seems to mean little or nothing to the people of the province has lost ground over his matrimonial affairs. Tehran Government's in general are accused of neglecting Fars. Lar which is still a fine town and has architectu rally one of the best bazaars in Persia has been slowly dying for years and no move seems to be made to save it. Now the rot has started in Shiraz. A number of the richer merchants have gone to Theran to live finding that with the increasing centralization of affairs in Tehran they must be in the capital if they are to survive. Currency control and the accentuates this desertion of the provinces and gradually all -the wealth of the country seems to be collecting in the capital. It only needs ten of the biggest merchants to leave Shiraz to shake the economy of the town completely. 19. ^avam ul Mulk who followed Firuz to Tehran in September returned to Shiraz at the beginning of December. Whether it was because he had achieved his aim in ousting Firuz or because of a warning given him by the Embassy he returned apparently a much changed man. With Firuz away he tended to usurp the functions of Governor-General and to run Fars from his private residence but with the worsening of the situation in the north showed wisdom, balance and calm. The Tudeh newspaper campaign which he foughx before his departure for Tehran died down in his absence and on his return the one remaining Tudeh newspaper was under suppression. One of the first acts of the incoming Governor-General was to raise the ban on this newspaper. # 20. Party activity has been sluggish. In August the Tudeh were ejected from Mervdasht (on the Persepolls plain) where there is a sugar-factory and had their club there gutted. With the temporary loss of their Shiraz newspapers they were not very vocal. The Adalat Party showed little sign of life. The Democrat Party (which is a conservative body and nothing to do with the movement in Azerbaijan)opened a reading room but otherwise followed its leader, a local mullah, into a state of deep depression. The Eradeh Melll (Seyyed Zla’s Party) started a newspaper and theryftost it because it was unwilling to pay sufficient blackmail to the owner. It has a small reading room but undertook no activerecruiting of members.- 4 - /Q ^ / 26. The able representative of Seyyed Zia in Shiraz seems to have chiefly held here a watching brief. 21. All the British Officers attached to the consulate had been transferred or demobilised by the time British troops withdrew from Tehran. One American Military adviser, who made no pretence of doing any work, left for assignment to a battle area and his place was taken by a colleague from Kerman who seems to regard his mission to regenerate the Persian Army in Ears as divine as well as American. The American Financial Adviser terminated his employment at the end of December. In one respect, by discharging a scoundrelly inter preter, he shov/ed to advantage over his predecessor but to judge by the number of days he was actually present in Shiraz to attend to his duties the Persian Government rn^de in him a bad bargain. 22. The Public Relations Bureau reading room in Shiraz was virtually closed. Only the relaying of broadcast news has been continued and that in order to keep the town informed of the march of events in the north and thus prevent the Spread of rumours likely to disturb the public calm. It cannot be said that the P.R.B. activities in Shiraz have been a striking success. The reason is that this sort of work to be done well is a Whole time job, calls for constant European supervision and an unfailing supply of bright ideas. In Shiraz the reading room has had to make do with such attention as memoers of the consulate staff could spare it. The regular P.R.B. staff was engaged locally. 23. ^ If P.R.B. activities gave little cause for xsxi satisfaction the British Institute has on the other hand gone from strength to strength ana in Shiraz at least it looks as if it would have been much more rewarding to concentrate on the British Council than on P.R.B. The general impression given that the British Council , was short of money while the P.R.B. was flush points to misplaced emphasis. The expansion of the work of the British Council in Shiraz is limited only by the cramp premises available and by the number of the European staff employed. 24. The British aeroplane used for weekly flights between Tehran and Bushire has given good service and could be duplicated with profit. 25. There has been occasianal criticism of the A.i.C.C. in the local press chiefly because stocks of primary products have been in short supply and in conse luence there has been no op ; ortunity or serious attempt made to provide for the needs of outlying areas. If during the war the first care of the A.l.c.C. was to attend to the allied fighting services one of the first cares of the peace should be to study the local market. Ears is a province that has suffered from severe aeforzsstation and every year brings a crisis in fuel. It is here that the Company should make an effort to substitute oil for the diminishing charcoal and wood stocks. In Shiraz only bakers, and not all of these, regularly use oil as fuel. The bakers find the necess- ry equipment is expensive and difficult to obtain so the carnpnay might well in trie public as well as their own interest make arrangements to supply bakers' outfits on reasonable terras. They might also produce stoves suitable for use*in Government departments, scnools, baths and private houses and so increase the consumption of oil and reduce the demand for wood and charcoal. Some charcoal will always be consumed for domestic purposes but a drive on the part of the company to supply oil-buring domestic ap liances seems much overdue, ARxexxm^iexEfxtfcKXEHjaxxR^lxxfaiiMXRxJfcfixijmkeiKgxi. as is also the vigorous development and local sale of by-products. An example of the company's failure to interest itself in local needs is to be found in the two Shiraz wine factories both of which burn wood in their distilling processes.- 5 - JiA r k 26. There have been few signs of Russian interest in Pars although the Russian Assistant Military attache paid a visit to Shiraz and two Russian agricultural experts spent some time east of Shiraz in the Jahrom - Fasa area. Reports have been recei/ed that the Russians do not use expected channels, particularly the small local Tudeh Party, to further their ends in Pars; They are said to be preparing Behbehan as a jumping-off Around for future activities and to have contacts with Mamassani.^ The Mamassani are conveniently near Behbehan and their reflations with the other tribes and the character of their leader lend colour to these reports.

At the close of the year there were no signs of restarting work. scoifomic Despite the cessation of hostilities, prices of essential commodities remained high and only the moderately well to do were able to obtain their daily needs. The poor lived on fish and dates. /. j. iLIfiuiY Jervan Ghaffari con anded the Garrison in B a ndar Abbas throughout the year. The Garrison still maintain its detach ments at Jask and kinab. GBrflJAKLARIB The Gendarr erie has had no less than six officers during the year. Jarwan .llai vacated his post on the 13th July and his assistant oervan Pur Homayun held charge temporarily4 * X temporarily until the arrival of Servan Bayzai (3rd August;. Bayzai remained in charge until the 24th September when he in turn handed over charge to Bervan ^hojaian.

Jackson M•B•E•, of the Indian Political 3ervice held charge up to the 19th April, when he proceeded to England on leave. His place was ta^en oy Major M.P. O’C Tandy of the Indian Political Bervice who held charge until the end of the year. (b) Assistant Burgeon C.E. Hynes I.M.J., held charge of the Government dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. II. THE RULING FAMILY . (a) Eor a man of sixty with a weak heart His Highness Bhaikh 3ir Ahmed al Jabir As-3ubah K.C.3.I., K.C.I.IS., maintained remark ably gooa health throughout the year. This was probably due to his habits of moderation in diet, of avoidance of exertion, of implicit obedience to the American Mission doctors who visit him twice weekly, and of keeping a loaded revolver to hand even in the privacy of his harem . He remained in Kuwait throughout the year except for the periodical pogroms of bustard which were committed as usual daring the winter months. He did however during the summer proclaim his intention of visiting India in September for optical and dental treatment, and tnis proposal may have been a ballon d'essai to detect any tendency on the part of Government to accord him e reception on tne lines of those given to other Arab rulers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. ./hen no trace of any such tend ency was apparent the proposal was allowed to drop, but a similar ballon may well be released in 1946. His Highness celebrated the 25th anniversary (by Muslim reckon ing) of his accession on the 23rd Eebruary and was suitably felicit ated by all comruunities, although the Government of India took no special steps to mark the occasion. By our calendar the 25th anniversary of His Highness' accession will fall on the 24th of March, 1946. (b) Shaikh Abdullah Salim C.I.S., continued to administer the Revenue and supply Departments with a degree of competence and probity hitherto unsuspected, and to punctuate his spells of duty with frequent (and apparently innocent) visits to his island haunt of failecha. He led the exodus to the Levant caused by the untimely advent of Ramadhan in August and September and gave rise to not_a little scandal by passing the sacred month congenially in the red- light quarter of Damascus. (c) Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak C.I.E., continued to supervise the Department of Public Security with ruthlessness and energy in no way diminished by his increasing weight - now in excess of 20 stone. He remains more pro-shaikh than the shaikh and more pro- British than the British. The result of his efforts has been an astounding degree of security throughout the town and state of Kuwait. He visited the Levant between 31st July and 6th September and returned from his first journey abroad convinced that there is no place like home. (d) Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir remained Chief Justice and Director of Education in which posts he discharged his duties loyai/|l and efficiently. He visited Bombay in the Spring, partly for optical treatment and partly in the hope of finding an easier cure for his hereditary disorder than the repeated and painful salvarsan injections prtfcribed by the Mission doctors in Kuwait. In this he was unsuccessful. (e) Shaikh Abdulla al Ahmad- 2 (e) Shaikh Abdullah al Alunad, who has iacroasea if possible in adiposity, wheeziness,and geniality, regained in charge of the Arsenal - a suitable post as it does not require a high decree of mobility. (f j ShaiKh iubah as -^lim remained Chief of olice. (g) :lheikh Mubarak al Hamad al Mubarak remained in charge of the Customs. (h) Shaikh Mohammad al Ahmed continued to live in Basrah and to manage His HinAness* property in ’Iraq, but the even tenor of w his existence was broken by an affray with the ’Iraq Customs police in which he suffered a bullet through the neck (which should have killed him) and the loss of his right thumb. (1) Shaikh Fahad as aalim’s not inconsiderable talents remain ostensibly unemployed but it in difficult to estimate the extent to which he participated in the administration of the departments officially entrusted to his brother Abdulla. (j) Shaikh Salim al Hamud, an uncle of His Highness and the senior living member of the Subah family, succumbed to tuberculosis in a sanatorium at Beyrouth. Until the lost moment it was doubt ful whether tuberculosis or diabetes would have the honour of carry ing him off. He leaves t^o sons: a boy of 13 who is accounted demented by reason of his ordinate predilection for the bottle and the opposite sex, and an infant who has been adopted by Bhaikh Abdullah Mubarak. III. THE POLITIC lb AGrffHT ’ S KHIATIOHS 'VI Til TiDi SHAIKH . The Political Agent’s relations with the Shaikh remained cordial, although in warmth they varied im srseljr with the amount ol^ friction generated by er.orts to curtail the smuggling propen sities of Kuwaitis in the interests of war-time trade control. His Highness renewed the Civil Air Agreement for a further period of 6 years and was co-operation itself in his dealings with the R.A.F. Karly in the year he offered them the use of the uarant- ine buildings at Shuwaikh rent free, as a rest-house; an offer which was gratefully accepted although itpay cone lovably have been not unconnected with e desire on the part of the 3haikh to evade fhe obligation to maintain a quarantine station. IV. LOCAL IHTKRA3T5 . (a) General In the absence of a published budget the administration of the Btate reEiains something of a mystery. It is however clear that the Consultative Assembly born with so many pangs in 1933 has passed away, for it held no meetings during the year. ’’Progress ive*’ elements appear to have been too pre-occupied with their own progress in profiteering to have had time for politics. Shaikh Ahmed has retained control of the x?olitioal destinies of the State and of the not inconsiderable income from the family properties in ’Iraq, anu continues to supervise if not to control the activities of the energetic municipality. Other State incoxae, including apparently the oil royalties, (which amounted to approx- I imately £.5,000 during the year and will probably amount to over £.340,000 during 1946) was collected by the Kevenue jepartmeat under the control of Sheikh Abdullah Salim. The Revenue Jepartmeat paid the following approximate monthly salaries:- Hia liiglniess Hs. 4,000. Shaikh Abdulla Salim Hs. 4,000. Shaikh Abdulla trubarak Hs. 1,500. Shaikh Fahad as Salim Hs. 1,500. Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir Rs. 1,100.- 3 - &gt;4 r) Other members of the As-3ubah received from /?s. 1,000 to Hs.600 monthly, d e r-i v cd The revenue of the Customs (from a duty of 6^ $ on imports and exports) and the profits of the Landing and Transport Company (which possesses a monopoly of the unloading of steamships) were divided as follows:- CUSTOM:} 4 # Revenue Department 1 'jo Education ” 1 p Public Health i j&gt; Municipality LiiNDINC C0M.RANY 10 j Revenue Department. ^0 jo to v^hare holders. oO j education Department. 30 jo Public Health. r\l 1 Ok (O Those v.ho administer this system remain convinced that it cannot be improved upon and have apparently not yet been confronted by the problem of an excess of revenue over expenditure. This problem is likely to arise during 1940 and the traditional solution, if applied, may aefc meet with opposition from those who are not given a share. (b) Medical (i) The Kuwait (Jovernment Medical Department Hospital remained under the supervision of the Syrian joctor Yahya Hadldi and employed an Egyptian lady doctor during the year. Dork on the new hospital remains suspended owing to lack of materials but over Rs. 1,000,000 are said to have been set aside for its completion. An excellent feature of the organisation is the employment of a special doctor on the health of the school-children, ali of whom are examined at regular intervals and treated if necessary. A proposal to provide one free meal &amp; day in the schools had to be dropped on grounds of expense. (ii) Approximately 55,000 men and 23,000 women were treated as out patients and 531 as in-patients in the Mission Hospital. 843 operations of all sorts were performed. An interesting development is that the women of Kuwait are beginning to change their attitude towards men doctors and have not ceased to visit the clinic since Dr. Ruth Crouse left and Dr. (Jerald Nykern. took her place in February. (Hi) 5432 patients were treated in the Agency Charitable Dispensary, the most common diseases being eye and digestive. (iv) There was no general epidemic and the influenza which was pre valent in 1944 did not recur. On the other hand typhoid and dysent ery was much heavier during the latter half of 1945 than in previous years, and malnutrition and tuberculosis increased considerably as a result of the high price of food. (c) Education. The Education Department under the direction of the capable and energetic Egyptian, Dr. Ahmed Sidiq Kamdi, continued to stand out as ai one of the brightest facets of the state administration, and the British Council representative in Cairo gave it as his opinion that the Kuwait schools compare favourably with these of Bahrain in clean liness and general organisation. There are now 10 boys’ and 4 girls* schools with an attendance roll of 1,459 and 443 respectively. Of the 56 male teachers 12 are Egyptians and 44 Kuwaitis, and of the 21 female teachers 8 are Egyptians, 4 Syrian, 3 Lebanese, and 6 Kuwaitis. There are a further 7 boys’ schools with 300 pupils outside t*he town of Kuwait. During the year the Government rented a house in Zamalek, Cairo, and furnished it at a cost of over .a 24,000/-. The recurring cost will be about .a 10,000/- per mens-cm and it will form a hdstel for the Educational Mission to Egypt which has now grown to a strength of 50 boys. Kuwait Government meet all expences except for tution fees. The ultimate object of the mission is to make Kuwait independent of foreign teachers. /■Bests &amp; Telegra shs • • • •- ffc - (&lt;*) floats &amp; Telegraphs K { J - i IT (i) The Indian Postal Administration continued to run the float Office throughout the year. 1?he land telegraph line to Basrah has worked satisfactorily. At present messages are only accepted and received in English. As a result of representation from His High ness the Director of Post's &amp; Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi has been requested to Instruct the Sub-Postmaster to receive and transmit messages in Arabic. The matter has been referred by the latrfcor to the Director General of Posts Telegraphs, New Delhi. fo *ne (ii) Messrs Cable &amp; Wireless have continued to operate their wireless telegraph station efficiently. The automatic telephone system installed by Cable fe Wireless in February, 1942, is showing signs of wear and tear which has been lar ;ely due to their Inability to procure necessary replacements from the United Kingdom due to war conditions. There are over 76 applicants for whom instruments are not available. (e) Municipality During the year yet another executive officer of the municipality was detected in defalcations and dismissed, but not otherwise punish ed. Executive officers are now presumed to be corrupt until the contrary'dis proven. (f) Haj. The Baudi Government maintained the ban on tne entry of ^persons into their territory who were not in possession of regular travel papers and the pilgrim traffic through Kuwait was consequently small. 387 people in all left for the Haj during the year out of whom 314 made the journey by camel. fhe lorr: fare. Xreturn)-u?as Ks.800/- per pexaQaA___dar^--w'er-#*-fur more expensive: 3 Hajis hired one for Hs.10,000. (g) Pear ling . Very few boats put out for the dive but those that did returned for Ramadhan with good hauls. Consequently a greater number left after Ramadhan but their catch was most disappointing. The following were the ruling prices in October:- Jewan Rs. 200/- per chaw. Bheeren Rs. 100/- M Golwa Rs. 50/- 20/- W Bad 3_u Rs. 15 to tt Naeim Rs. 60 to 65/- tt (h) 3hip-building . Shortage of wood, particularly teak, still hampered the industry and activity was almost entirely confined to construction of boats for the Tvater-Supply Company. Owing to these new boats and to an unprecedented and very welcome rain-storm in July, the usual summer water crisis did not occur. {i) The iafar . As a result of the paucity of steamer sailings ocean-going dhows continued to prosper. 76 returned to Kuwait in the early summer and 139 left for India and Africa towards the close of the year. V. _ DESERT INTER ..313 1945 was an easier year for the bedouin than either of the pre- ceeding two. Rains end grazing were better and the distribution of quota goods v/as more efficiently and fairly organised than previously Finally they had had time partly to adjust themselves to the use of substitutes*for rice, although digestive ailments arising from the consumption of wheat cooked and milled by unorthodox and ineffective5 Owing largely to the efforts of L*-CoIonel H.H.P. Dickson C«I*E., numbers of bedouin have been induced to engage in i^anunl labour for the Kuwait Oil Company and the latter have been persuaded to put up with the wayv/ardnesa an&lt;T irresponsibility of bedouin employees. VI ^Qs-hiai ltlV'ub.: f ? S (a) ^udl nrabia Keletions with the 3audi Government have remained friendly throng out the period under review. Every conceivable precaution is taken by the shaikh not to offend his powerful neighbour. (b) ’ Iraq . (i) helations with f lraq have remained correct, but Kuwaitis were much inconvenienced by the new ’Iraq Visa Regulations which tane no account of the fact that Kuwaitis, who have numerous relations and large interests in ’Iraq, have frequent occasion for visiting ~ that country at short notice. (ii) On the 27th October. Shaikh Mohammad (second son of His I Highness) was fired on by an ’Iraqi police car a few miles to the west of Zubair while returning to Basrah from a hawking expedition. His ri^ht thumb was shot off while another bullet traversed his neck. His Kutairi guide was killed. The I’utassarraf of .Basrah telegraphed his regrets to His Highness and the latter did not lodge any official prot co t. VII DATE G4PBEN3. The value of the 190 shares of the Bashiya garden which were lost in 1944 has been computed at I.D.G,980.631. Early in the year the ’Iraq Ministries of finance and the Interior are said to have granted His Highness’ tenants the right to cultivate the extensive mud-flats lying between His Highness’ date gardens and the rivor^' './hen this cultivation is taken in han-1 it v/ill cause a very great drop in the value of His Highness’ properties. Certain of the tenants have appealed against the registration of the estate in the name of his Highness and the ’Iraqi authorities have wade the fact that there is an appeal penuing an excuse for refusing to taxe action on complaints of theft or wilful damage against the .tenants. / VIII C03T OF UVINO . The coat of living has continued excessively high during the /period under review. The daily wage of an unskilled labourer reached and remains at Rs.5/- plus food and other wages ere in proportion.

X. KUWAIT OIL QOMRANY At the ooxamencement of the year the company was still wording on a shut-down basis, but during the first quarter of 1945 work was begun N \on a hyarographic survey and the testing of proposed sites for load, ng tankers. Late in Larch the Company wmg oriBCd to begin wojrJt on the 50,000 barrels oer day crude oil export schema. Two braelcleh water /ells at a point about 20 miles vV.N.iV. of Burgan were sum., and bn their completion worA was started on the well reconditioning pro gramme. A party from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Pipe-line Construction Le.^irtment began to arrive in October end their work has progressed satisfactorily up to the end of the year. A contract for one construction of tankage was placed with the Motherwell Bridge &amp; IShgineerlng Company who commenced their work in the beginning of November and have made fair progress. At the year’s and the Company’s personnel strength amounted to:- Senior Staff 79. Junior Staff 68. Foreign artisans 55. Labour 894. In addition approximately 507 co LIU labourers were employed.

(i) His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah, K.C.I.E,, the Ruler of Bahrain, continued to take a great interest in all state affairs and, in par ticular, in the food rationing system which was subsi dised by his government to the extent of Rs.11,800,000. V in late November His Highness accompanied by his uncle. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., xhxx and other members of the Al Khalifah family went on a shooting trip to Saudi Arabia. The party proceeded as far as Hafar where most of the shooting was done and, on tneir return a month later, were seen off at Al Khobar by His Highness the Amir Baud. It is said that the trip cost more than Rs.300,000. (ii) Shaikh Salman bin Mohammad, fifth son of the senior uncle of His Highness was sent to Jerusalem in April for a course of judicial training. (iii) Khalid bin Mohammad bin Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa returned from Egypt in November. His education has led him into the paths of youth organizations, in this instance not conducive to the best interests of Bahrain. POLICE . police. Naturs.

The decrease in the strength of Naturs is due to the lack of suitable men for enlistment. fhere were no serious crimes during the year. The incidence of thefts was smaller than that of the pre vious year. The three most prominent cases were those in vyhich 35,00(1 rounds of ammunition were stolen from the Royal Air Force, 18,000 rounds of ammunition from the State police and 20 tyres by an American citizen from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. There were 34 road accidents resulting in 12 deaths and 3 serious injuries. AGRICULTURE . The Egyptian Agriculturist left the Bahrain Government during the year. (Continued)(continued) 6. MUNICIPALITIES. The work of the Municipalities was confined to routine matters and no important projects were instituted. 7 * PUBLIC WORKS . No new major works were carried out during this year. 8 * electricity department . (a) The new generating set of 206 KW capacity arrived in-^lri^n in March, 1945, but the extension of the power TTouse having proceeded little beyond the stage of planning and the engine having arrived minus , certain essential parts, the plant was not in operation by the end of the year and the three overworked and long enduring British sets catered very spasmodically for the needs of the hard tried and perspiring population of Bahrain during a very unpleasant hot weather. ^'ere it not that the R.A.F. f s plant at Muharraq came into operation on the 1st June and thereby released the Government Power House of about 100 KW of their load the situation would have been even worse than it was. Consumers were, during the hot weather, cut off daily at regular (sic) intervals and the total period during which supply was proportioned was'as follows:- A Sc C Feeders Royal Naval Base, 264 hrs. 11 Minutes Jufair 233 ii 8 ti Belgrave Feeder 196 ii 49 u Bazaar Feeder 73 » 30 ii Muharraq, which has its own feeder, was cut off for a total of 18 hrs. 37 minutes. The total period of shutdowns for mechanical defects was 786 hrs. 15 minutes during the months April/December. (B) Extensions to power Supply . (1) In April the Royal Air Force Rest House and the British Overseas Airways Corpora tion Jetty were connected by means of a new L.T. Line and transformer from the Shaikh’s Palace at Gudhaibiya. (2) The British Overseas Airways Corporation Transit Camp, Gudhaibiya, was connected by means of a new II. T. Line and 20 KVA Transformer during July. (3) A new sub-station for the British Overseas Airways Corporation Rest House was connected direct from the Government power House by(Continued) -5- means of an H.T. underground cable to provide an increased supply for Air Conditioning during 1946, The length of this cable line is approximately 1,350 feet and power will not be available to this new line until the new generating set, now being erected, comes into service. 9. TELEPHONE DEPAimffiNT . The Bahrain Government^ telephone system is antiquated in ther-extreme. and badly needs replacement. The scheme Tor installation of an automatic telephone exchange has, regrettably, shown little progress due to various factors. One is the tendency of the landlords of the few convenient sites to hold out for high ground rents and Messrs. C*ble &amp; Wireless Limited^ unwillingness to meet their demands which renders,it, most unlikely that an automatic telephone exchange will be in operation In 1946. The fact remains that by the end of the year Cable &amp; Wireless had not placed the order for the new exchange much to the detriment of British prestige. 10 - PSARL INDUSTRY . The pearling season was a successful one. There were about 121 pearling craft out this year. The catch was better and prices higher than those of the previous season. 11. CUSTOMS . Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Rs.25,98,093 for the year. There were 113 launches registered with the Customs on the 31st December, 1945, including those belonging to tne Navy and the various companies. 12. FOOD CONTROL . During the year under review the Government again devoted a considerable amount of time, money and energy in ensuring that adequate supplies of essential foodstuffs were available for the public. In all a sum of Rs.11,800,000 as compared to the 1944 figure of Rs.8,000,000 was spent on the purchase of wheat, millet, rice, tea, sugar, and dates. The monthly ration per adult was maintained at a high level throughout the year. Towards the close of the year the Government introduced a cloth rationing system, which should prove successful. The number of recall shops was increased ' and rations divided equally amongst them. During the year there was a sceady stream of commodities such as potatoes, onions, fresh and dried fruits, v/alnucs, etc., from Persia, where the good rains of the previous winter assisted in maintaining a sufficient supply.- 6 - w 13, SHIPPING &gt; The folio vying is a statement of ships that called at Bahrain during the year 1945:- British American Dutch Panamanian French Norwegian Italian Swedish Greek Total 171 154 27 15 9 9 4 3 2 394 The total imports for the year amounted to 92,901 tons, while exports amounted to 17,326 tons.

(i) On the 24th January, 1945, a local craft laden with a cargo of dry dates, sprang a leak in the harbour and went aground. The cargo was damaged by sea water and had to be removed ashore for drying. The craft was later repaired. (ii) On the 23rd December. 1945, a boat lying at anchor laden with 300 maunds of Persian wheat was wrecked in a strong ”shamal”. The cargo, badly soaked with sea water, was brought ashore for drying and cleaning and the boat was eventually salvaged and towed in for repairs. 15. MEDICAL (General ). The medical work of Bahrain was carried out by three hospitals - Victoria Memorial, Mission, and Bahrain Government. Their reports show that the health of the community remains at much the usual level. There was no epidemic in Bahrain throughout the year due to control by mass vaccination and effective quarantine arrangements. The persistence of the Kaus wind and lack of the ’’shamal” (NW) probably accounted for the higher than normal incidence of malaria. Small pox reached a very low level only 15 cases being treated in the Victoria Memorial Hospital as compared with 56 in 1944. (Continued)(Continued) -7- Venereal disease showed an increase during the year under review; this is duo mainly to the reluctance of patients to undergo a complete course of treatment. (1) VICTORIA TiIMORIAL HOSPITAL . Lieutenant M.L.A. Steele held charge during the year except for a period from the 20th July to the 25th October when he proceeded on leave, his work being carried out by Drs. George and Storm of the Mission Hospital. Humber of Out-door patients treated 15,800 Number of In-door patients treated 37 Number of operations (all minor) 774 Malaria .

Harrison held charge throughout the year assisted by Drs. George, Mylrea and ttorm. Out-door patients treated 18,263 In-door patients treated 2,114 Number of operations per formed (both major and minor) 3,906 (iii) STATE MKDICAL HOSPITAL . Dr. R.H.B. Snow held charge throughout the year except for the period from 3rd May to 25th October 1945 when he proceeded on leave. He was assisted in the ^omen’s Section by Dr. I.M.A. Doeg who also acted as State Medical Officer during Dr. Snow’s absence on leave. Men’s Section .

M.L.A. Steele was in charge as Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year except for a period of leave from the 20th July to the 25th October when Dr. Bhandarkar of the State Medical Hospital officiated In his place. The quarantine service in Bahrain has aHcptu progressed during the last few years, credit for which goes to Dr. Steele, whose efforts in this cause under difficult local conditions have had effect. Some idea of the progress and efficacy of this service may be gauged from the following figures of Bahrain’s worst epidemic, small pox:- Year. No. of cases 1941 (from Sept.) 193 1942 119 1943 43 1944 57 1945 14 The quarantine station is situated near Muharraq. The site is admirable in that it is cut off from the town at high tide. There are two buildings with accommodation for about 150 persons. This station is designed for local use only. It was expanded and improved in 1941 and the folioving years. Compulsory segregation of infected cases and mass vaccination were also introduced at the same time. No facilities for segregation of passengers from ships and ’planes, if necessary, exist at present, but it is hoped that some arrangements to this end will be made soon. A total of 62 passenger steamers and about 20 tankers and, freighters were visited by the Quarantine Medical Officer during the year under review. At present no effective quarantine arrangements have been made for yellow fever, as the expense involved would be too high and not justified by the circumstances, as only passengers of the British Overseas Airways Cor poration f, C” class ’planes, which touch at yellow fever Infected areas on route are affected.* 16. THE POST OFFICE . Mr. Rajab Ali was the Sub-post Master through out the year assisted by four clerks. ♦The quarantine staff is too small to keep a vigilant check on the crew and passengers of country-craft. (Continued)(Continued) - 10 - y Number of schools closed during 1946 Number of students on 1.1.1945 Number of students on 31.12.45 Number of teachers on 1.1.1945 Number of teachers on 31.12.45 2619 2736 127 137 (i) BOYS* SCHOOLS . All tne schools are filled to capacity and in some cases the classes aro overcrowded. Numbers of applications for admission had to be refused. According to the policy adopted the previous year to send some boys to Egypt for advanced studies, 16 students left for Cairo during the year. War time exigencies have resulted in a serious dearth of school stationery; a small quantity was, however, obtained through the British Council. The failure of the British Council to provide a Director is a great set-back to the Islands’ educational efforts. LiiJ GIRLS 1 SCHOOLS . 16 students passed their final examinations and most of them have been appoihted as teachers. There has been a considerable improvement in the gene ral health of the girls owing to regular visits to the schools by the Health authorities. The annual Exhibi tion of needlework was a great success. (ill) TECHNICAL SCHOOL . year in the Technical School, viz., Elementary Electri city and Weaving. Three students were sent for further technical training to Cairo. an d Chief Loeal^-iiepre.sentativ.e of the Company through out The year. £?r. Don J. Hanna, one of the Vice-rresi- defrts of the company was present in Bahrain from time to time throughout the year. (k) Production and Development . net barrels,-20,024 net barrels per day.- The rate of production has been held practically con stant throughout the year with distribution of production from the reservoir being slightly altered due to expan sion of the artificial gas cap. During the year faci lities for the production of aviation gasoline and increased quantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war were completed and put into operation. The construction of facilities to permit the direct loading and unloading of ocean Two new subjects were introduced during the 19. THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY , (a) General Management . Mr, Ward P. Anderson was the General Manager Total oil produced during 1945 was 7,308,938(Continued) ocean going ships at Gitra was conmenced during the / year and was progressing satisfactorily at the year’s end* (c) producing Field . Although no actual development wor/w was commenced during the year, plans were laid, equip ment and materials were ordered and some preliminary work was done pursuant to a development programme to be Inaugurated in 1946. Considerable detailed work of a geological nature was done in the re-examination of well formation samples to obtain all data possible. Several water wells throughout the island were electric logged* Four more wells were rehabilitated during the year leaving four wells in this programme which are still secured requiring extensive re-work before they can be returned to production. Import of Arabian American Crude Oil . The total import of Arabian crude during 1945 was 15,649,272 net barrels. Upon completion of the 12 u Arabia-IBahrain sub-marine pipe line from Arabia to the Refinery, the Zellaq terminal was dis mantled and is now obsolete. The last cargo received through Zellaq was on 3rd March, 1945, and from 1st January to 3rd March a total of 1,831,053 net barrels were handled through its facilities before being abandoned in favour of the Arabia-Bahrain pipe line. The balance of Arabian crude was received through this line except for 564,225 net barrels delivered by tanker and unloaded at Sitra. (e) Refining Operations . Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput and were augmented by the coromissioning of aviation gasoline production facilities During the year crude rims totaled 22,875,136 barrels of which 32f was Bahrain crude while the balance was imported from Arabia. Shipment of' products manufactured from the foregoing crude runs were divided as follows Aviation gasoline Motor gasoline Kerosene Diesel oils Fuel oils Total 17,615,320 Barrels With the ending of the war, the demand for aviation gasoline dropped rapidly with the result that all aviation shipping tankage was full about the end of October. All aviation facilities were shut down at that time and still remained idle at the end of the year The balance of the refinery continued operating at full throughput. 322,997 Barrels 5,236,866 ’• 2,061,684 ' 4,356,643 ' 5,637,130 “(Continued) (f) New Refinery Storehouse . With the enlarged refining facilities installed during the last two years increased storehouse equipment was necessary. To fill this requirement, a new QS* x 204* storehouse was started in the latter part of 1945 and should be completed early in 1946. (g) Additional Generator - No.2 Power Plant . An additional 3,000 KW. generator purchased in connection with the increased operating facilities is* in the process of installation and should be avail able for use early in 1946. With the completion of this unit the total rated nominal electric power capa city will be 14,000 KW. (h) Causeway . fhe new 30* width causeway which was indicated in last year’s report «s being built to a point about 13,000 feet offshore was placed into operation before full completion in order to utilize it in connection with the new wharf construction. Also during the latter part of the year it was used to great advantage in con nection with a 6,500 ton cargo of bulk coke and three full cargoes of drummed products from the drum plant. As intimated above, the causeway construction is not yet complete, a certain amount of dirt and rock fill still being required to bring the roadway up to sped-, fled elevation before final grading can be completed. (i) New n foarf . During 1945 construction of a new 4 berth wharf was started, located about 1300 feet beyond the pierhead terminus of the new causeway and connected to it by an elevated trestle capable of full scale truck traffic. It is expected that the south end will be ready for receipt of incoming cargo in January 1946 and that all construction will be complete for full opera tion about March, 1946. With the completion of these facilities and the new loading pumps at dtra, it should be possible to finish any bulk oil shipment in 24 to 36 hours. (j) Camp Facilities . The growing Company facilities and increased personnel have necessitated extensions to the Awali village. A new housing area has been laid out and six new two-bedroom and eleven new three-bedroom air cooled houses have been built and twenty two-bedroom houses are in the course of construction. A new sewage pump house was also constructed in this area. The Awali storenouse office was found to be inadequate and was extended during the year. • (k) Personnel . The following gives a summary of the personnel employed by the Company on their regular operations and on additional construction work during the year:-(Continued) 6 ft? 0 » \ Americans British (U.K.) Canadians South Africans Other inropeans British Indians ’Iraqis Bahrainis Others 261 (including 105 Contractors Employees) • 292 m' 28 8 681 . 20 3580 736 5638 (1) Royalties on Bapco Oil . Burin one half year perion from the 1st January, 19$5, to the 30th June, 1945, the Royalties paid to the Shaikh and the Bahrain Government amounted to Rs.15,65,925 (Rupees fifteen lacs, sixty-five thou sand nine hundred and twenty-five only). The statement for Royalties for the second half of the year under review had not been received at the time of compilation of this report. 20. VISITS OF FO.tEIG:; NOTABLES . (i) Mr. Van der Meulen, minister for the Netherlands, at Jedda, passed through Bahrain en route to sushire on the 7th January, and spent a couple of days here. (ii) His Excellency Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Has al Khaimah, spent almost two weeks in Bahrain during June. He stayed with His Highness. 21. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (i) On the 1st January in accordance with the usual custom His Highness accompanied by his senior relatives paid an official call on the political Agent. Later the same day some 200 of the leading members of all communities in Bahrain were received by the political Agent. (ii) On the 16th February the Spring Race Heetia^ was held in aid of War Charities and resulted in a satisfactory collection of Rs.16,000/- to that end. (iii) As hour by hour publicity made V.E. DAY more obviously imminent, there were local attempts to 'jump the flag'; the anxiety to celebrate, coupled with the normal nervous tension of the Arab, could not wait for the official all-clear, when it did come there was inevitably a tinge of anti-climax in the picture. Nevertheless, flags during the day and lights at night made a brave show. The squibs were old and damp but their dulness served only as a reminder that material for making them was for use in sterner fireworks.(Continued) Floodlights on the Agency did wonders of mcike-up fo* -tfrs diurnal Tace. The 9th, 10 th and 14th May were public holidays. On the 14th May the poli tical Agent gave an Arab dinner for His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, the heads of local British and American institutions and leading merchants. (iv) Celebrations for V.J. DAY on the 15th August came as somewhat of an anti-climax to that of V.E.DAY. Celebrations were reserved and the inevitable lassitude engendered by the month of Ramadhan undoubtedly played its part. (v) On the 21st December Haji Yousuf Ahmad Kanoo died at the age of 71. His association with f?is Majesty’s Government started in 1898 in the time of the Agent Haji Ahmad bin Abdur Rasool. He continued to serve as Assistant until the arrival of Mr.Gasken in 1902, and was associated with Major Prideaux and Captain Mackenzie until 1909. He received the Kaiser-i-Hind medal second class in 1911, the title of Khan Sahib in 1917 and the M.B.E. in 1919. In 1924 a C.I.E. was bestowed upon him. The death of this well known old Arab was marked in Bahrain by the closing of the Bazaars for one day. 28. THE -7EATHBR . Local repute has it that for ten years Bahrain has not had weather of the severity experienced during the month of July of the year under review. For days and nights without intermission the steamy heat was intense, and there was no wind to relieve the atmo- sphere^/or ruffle the oily expanse of the sea. It was during this period that the electrical system in Bahrain struck for shorter hours of work and ceased to function for irregular and frequent periods. Some forty to fifty R.A.F. personnel had to be flown out of Bahrain as a result of heat exhaustion and severe ’’prickly heat”, a skin disease which in its mildest form produces nervous irritation and when severe can be acutely poisonous, and of which there were very many cases. No European or Indian during this period was free from it and many Arabs also were affected. 23. ECONOMIC . (i) Banking and Currency . With the cessation of hostilities both in the west and in the east during the year, there was a con siderable loosening in the regulations controlling trade and currency which gave both the merchants and banking authorities a chance once again to do business. Added t^o this was the opening^ of a second banking house - the imperial Bank of Iran - towards “tlio close of 1944. The rates offered by the banks to businessmen had now to be on a competitive basis. Demands for exchange were(Continued) more than doubled and Increased towards the close of the year. Exchange on India in particular was in great demand during the last three months of the year.. (ii) Eastern Bank . The transactions of the Eastern Bank were concerned chiefly in financing the requirements of the oil companies operating in this area, and the Navy, Army and Air Force Services. Their imports in currency notes amounted to Rs.119 lacs and sales on India amounted to Bs.70,94,392. During the year they received 583 bills for collection chiefly from England, India, south Africa and the United States of America with a total value amounting to £.98,691. The chief goods imported through the bank from England were cigarettes, piecegoods, hosiery, bicycles, woollen material, hats, photographic material, stationery, medicines and machinery; and from South Africa, tinned provisions, and canned fruits. (iii) Imperial Bank of Iran . The year 1945 was the first year of the Imperial Bank f s working in Bahrain, and its activities showed a steady increase throughout the year. The total held In current accounts increased to Rs.31,00,000 on the 31st December, 1945, from Rs.5,00,000 on 31.12.1944. The Bank*s total operations in foreign exchange were:- purchases Rs.103 lacs. Sales Rs.56 lacs. Their imports in currency notes and coin amounted to Rs.56,15,000 during the year. Credits were opened to cover imports into Bahrain to the extent of Rs.375,000. The total value of bills received for collection amounted to Rs.850,000. During December of the year under review the bank made an agreement to purchase-a-^slfce for a new office. This site Is situated on/prior Road between the offices of Messrs. Gray ?l.ackenzieCompany, Limited, and the Arabian American Oil Company. 24. CABLE &amp; WIRELESS LIMITED . / The staff of this branch number 43, of whom five are European and the rest Indian. Their services were adequately maintained throughout the year, continuous watch for shipping and aircraft being kept, in addition to their telegraphic activities, both Commercial and Service. , During the year an agreement was reached between the Bahrain Government and Cable &amp; tireless iLimited for the installation and operation by„.the(Continued) -16- latter of an automatic telephone system in Bahrain. Plans to this end showed no progress by the close of the year. 25. BRITISH OVI^RoBAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION . The anticipated stepping up of frequency of services to serve the Far Eastern theatre of war developed for the first half of the year. Due to the sudden collapse of hostilities with Japan It was evident towards the latter half of 1945 that the frequency of services would tend to decline, especially in regard to the R.A.F. Flying Boat Refers Programme which was planned by and for whose handling the Corporation was responsible. The Corporations scheduled Sunderland services which transit-Bahrain were extended from Calcutta to Rangeoft'-ln TKrtober. In the first half of the year the greater portion of the passengers was Service personnel - transient, embaricing and disembarking. Towards the latter part of the year this proportion diminished and the majority of'passengers carried was civilian, both Eastbound and Westbound. It is expected that a Trunk Route Service will shortly be introduced from the United Kingdom to the Far Bast calling en route at Bahrain thrice weekly. A Lockheed Lodestar Service may be instituted once weekly between Cairo and Bahrain touching at Basra, Baghdad and Damascus. The following is a table of statistics for the yearj- Services Sunderland 739 'C' Class 390 'E' Class 286 'IT Class 6 Dakota 7 Lancastrian i Lockheed , 1 Total 1,480 R.A.F.

War time conditions and their aftermath during 1945 again prevented the Petroleum Concessions Limited from obtaining personnel and equipment with which to carry out geological exploration or drilling in the concession areas in the Persian Gulf. Towards the end of the year, however, it became possible to make some ’ \ preparations towards geological exploration in the I Trucial Coast and hinterland, and for resumption of \ drilling in Qatar early, in 1946. With the end of the war with Germany and Japan, the Ruler of Qatar showed a revival of interest in the re-opening of the Qatar Field. He again drew attention to the oil developments in the territories of his neighbours, Bahrain and Arabia, and he is not easily persuaded that every effort is being made to recommence drilling and expedite production. On the 20th March, 1945, an oil -concession agreemen, /as concluded with the Ruler of Umm-al-Qaiwain on terms which compare with the other concessions on the ^Trueial Coast. Towards the end of the year the Company were in correspondence with this Agency on the subject of the use of Company Aircraft in the Persian Gulf and Muscat territory. Approval has also been obtained to the construction of a Company Landing ground in Qatar. 27. THE ROYAL AIR FORCE . Early in the year tinder reviev/ Air commodore Oliver accompanied by rather more than 20 experts made a survey of the new R.A.F. commitments on Uharraq Island and informed the Political Agent that the per sonnel of the R.A.F. would be increased by a further 600 men during the summer. The progress with the laying of pierced steel sheeting alongside the runways has been satisfactory. Later a firm of Palestinian contractors commenced work on the laying of pierced steel sheeting on a bitumen and sand foundation on the main runways themselves, and making other improve ments.-18- 28. Aia^HICAIv 7 CONSULATE . Mr. Parker T. Hart and Mr. Clarence McIntosh were U.S. Vice-Consuls at Phahran at the beginning of the year under reviev/. In May Mr. Parker T. Hart left for the United States on leave and was succeeded in turn by Mr. William L- Sands and Mr. Walter W. Birge, Jr. In December Mr. Parker r. Hart returned to Dhahran. Mr. Clarence Tldntosh was Vice-Consul until the end of the year. The state Department has attached growing importance to theiT eunsular post at Dhahran. In January Oman OJuscat), Qatar, and the Trucial Coast were informally included within the district of Dhahr&amp;n Consulate and in December fir. Parker T. Hart returned to Dhahran as the United States Consul. A close and friendly liaison was main tained between this Agency and the Dhahran Consulate In all matters of common interest, in January Mr. Parker T. Hart accompanied Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.2., O.B.E., the Political Agent, Bahrain, on a tour of the Trucial Coast. In June and July Mr. William L. Sands attended as a spectator at the trial of an American employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who was sentenced to one yea^s simple imprisonment by the Agency courts.(Continued) 29. QATAR QATAR . 29 (i) The Ruler of Qatar, His Excellency sheikh Abdulla bin Qasim al-Thani, C.I.K., is now about 74 years old, and continues in good health despite a few set-backs such as an attack of impetigo of the feet. He was treated for this by the Agency I/iedical Officer who went to Qatar in late November to attend to him. His age prevents him from carrying out efficiently all affairs of State most of which are now done by his second son and heir-presumptive, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdulla, v/ho is now 40 years old. The latter, of whom the father is very fond, is the keeper of the official seal and issues all letters in his father’s name. (ii) Local Affairs . Sheiiih yamad goes down to Doha, the Capital • of i^atar, daily to attend to affairs of State and also tries important cases. Petty and minor cases are dealt with according to Islamic Law by the .Amir of Doha, one Hanmam by name, an old and trusty follower of the Shaikh. (iii) Revenue . The chief source of revenue for the Shaikh accrues from the subsidy on oil given by Petroleum Concessions (Qatar) Limited, Other sources of revenue are Customs duty at 7$ on imports and exports of barley and wheat and duty and 2% demurrage tax on all other goods. (iv) Education .. Education is confined to boys, there being about eight small schools with a total number of 300. They are taught the Koran, simple arithmetic and the Arabic script. No schools for girls have as yet been opened. (v) Pearling industry . The pearling fleet consists of about 70 craft with a total crew of about 1,600 persons, most of whom come from the hinterland and Persia during the pearling season. During the year under review the catch was small but due to the high price prevail ing for pearls the margin of profit was most encouraging. (vi) Shipping . No steamers call at Doha, the port of Qatar. The 'Khuziztan' of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited periodically calls there to replenish Qatar’s supply of kerosene oil and petrol. Traffic between Qatar and ports outside is carried by dhows.(vii) Oiflcial Visits . The political Agents visited Qatar twice during the year. The first visit was by Hr. C.J.PELLY* O.B.E., I.C.S., during April in the P.C.L. launch 'GHAZAL' and the second in November by Lieutenant- Colonel A.C. GALLOWAY, 0.3.E., accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, in H.M.S. 'SEABRLLE'. (viii) Health . There are no doctors or medical facilities in Qatar, sanitation is most primitive and as a result the health of the community is not of a high order. Malaria is most insidious. Fairly prevalent too are dysentery, syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis. 3nall- pox appears fron time to time. Dr. Steele, the Agency ?£edical Officer, paid a visit to Qatar at the request of the Sheikh late in November. As news spread of the arrival of the Medical Officer people streamed in from the country-side to be treated. After 4 days the doctor returned, his supply of drugs having given out. Many people had to return home disappointed.30. TRUCIAL COAST. THUGIAL COAST. 30 (a) (i) Truclal Shaikhs . The following were the Ruling Shaikhs of the various states on the Trucial Coast throughout the year:- 1. Dubai Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.R. Sharjah Shaikh Abu Dhabi Shaikh A j roan Shaikh Umm al qaiwain Shaikh Has al Khaimah Shaikh Sultan bln Saqr al Qasimi. Shakhbut bln Sultan bin Zayid. Rashid bin Humaid.

(1) Mr. G.R. Shea was the Station Manager of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, Sharjah, from 1st January to tho 8th May when he was relieved by the (Continued)*Blr. J. u /. Queckett, v^io in turn handed over to Mr. p. Ward on the 8th of October, ffe continued in charge till the end of the year. The British Overseas Airways Corporation East and ? t est bound services were regular during the year except for a period from the 20th November onwards, when the Ensign Services ceased. The local people could not travel by the B.O.A.C. flying boats which touched at Sharjah due to their inability to obtain inoculation against yellow fever. However, arrange ments were made with the Royal Air Force Transport Command to carry local passengers during this period. (ii) Mr. Monteiro was in charge of the branch at Dubai of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company, Limited, until he left for India^on the 13th October. He was relieved by Mr. E. Fernandez. During the year under report 34 ships called at Shariah and 50 at Dubai.

(iv) On the 22nd November Mr. Khurshid Ali Mirza took over charge as the sub-postmaster, Dubai, from Mr. Mohammad Zaman, who left for India on leave. (v) Consequent upon the ending of the war \ Messrs, petroleum Concessions Limited again began their activities on the Trucial Coast.. Mr. B.IT. ter* mitte spent a week there in March when he concluded an oil agreement with the Shaikh of 0mm al Qaiwain. (c) AMTI-LOCUST MISSION . In the middle of June the Anti-Locust Mission closed down having concluded a campaign. Captain U. Joyce, R.O.A.C., the head of the Mission left for Cairo by air on the 18th June and the Indian personnel for India on the 16th June. (d) TOURS . (i) On the 6th March the Hon»ble Sir. Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Sharjah by air from Bahrain and left again for Bahrain on the 8th of March. (11) Major T.

There were no epidemics of any kind reported during the year. The majority of people suffered from chronic malaria with splenomegaly. Other prevalent complaints were venereal disease, and diseases of the eyes and respiratory and digestive systems. (f) ROYAL AIR FORCE . # A large number of thefts from the R.A.F. Camp were reported during the year. These included thefts of cash, ammunition, cable, M.T. Parts, and machine tools and parts. Theft was rendered com paratively easy on account of the very inadequate security arangements in the camp. In October, however, the camp was partially fenced with barbed wire and Levy guards were, with the approval of the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai, ordered to open fire on any person found in or around the camp at night and who failed to halt when challenged in the proper manner. These measures resulted in some decrease in the number of thefts. (g) U.S.A*A.T.C . (i) in August the American Air Transport Command Detachment were withdrawn from dharjah. They took with them most of their vehicles and equipment. A small staff of one officer and eight men were left behind who expect to leave there shortly. (ii) An American Survey Party, consisting of Lieutenant Moore and four men, arrived at Sharjah for the purposes of establishing ground ”fixes” in con nection with the survey for an air route. They operated in *bu Dhabi, Dubai, Has al Khaimah, and Diba, and eventually left the Truclal Coast on the 22nd October for Muscat territory to continue the survey. They returned to Sharjah on the 20th November where they closed down and left for Cairo. Lieutenant Moore later returned and disposed of the party’s six vehicles by a sale to the Trucial Shaikhs. 1 (Continued)-24- (h) LOCAL AFFAIBS . (I) In February a merchant named Roopchand permanand of Tatta (Sind) was murdered in Abu Dhabi. He was. the only British Indian subject in that place and had settled there many years ago. fhe murderer was caught, found guilty, and was executed by shooting. A (ii) on the 6th March the Hon*ble Sir Geoffrey prior, K.C.!•£., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Major r* Hickinboti am, C.I.S.. O.B.E., political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah by air. The next dac/ the Hon’ble the Political Resident visited the village of Dhaid, some 40 miles from Sharjah, where he received the Shaikhs of Has al Khaimah, Ajman, Sharjah, Dubai, Timm al ^aiwain, the Regent of Kalba, and the paramount shaikh of the Beni Qitab tribe. The gathering w^s of considerable size and the Shaikhs were accompanied by many of their relatives and followers. The Hon'ble the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain, discussed various matters of interest with the Shaikhs and later invited them and their followers to lunch. After the lunch the Hon’ble the Political Resident addressed the gathering and then returned to Sharjah. It is interesting to note that all the Rulers of Trucial Oman were present at this gathering with the exception of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who was absent owing to the distance of his State from the rendezvous. The greatest amiability prevailed during the gathering and the Shaixhs appeared to be on very cordial terms with each other though, with one exception, they all appeared, as is customary, armed to the teeth. The exception was the most warlike of them all, Shaikh Muhammad bin All bin Huwaidin, the Paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab, who, out of courtesy to the Resident, arrived with his followers unarmed. (ill) On the night of the 17th October, Shaikh Rashid, son of the shaikh of Dubai, occupied Khor Ghanadhah with about 300 armed men. They took with them large quantities of building materials and showed i every intention of building a fort there. In 1937 a settlement of the boundary between Dubai and Abu Dhabi v/as attempted and Ghanadhah was then not included in Dubai’s claim. This move then amounted to an aggression against Abu Dhabi, and moreover as many of the armed men were transported by sea it also constituted a breach of the treaty of 1833 with His Majesty's Government which forbade aggression by sea. The Assistant political Agent, Bahrain, left on the 21st October for the Trucial Coast to investigate and reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was preparing to*meet force with force, and that hostilities between Dubai and Abu Dhabi appeared to be imminent. The Political Agent, Bahrain, acting on the iftsfcructions of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf demanded the J withdrawal of all Dubai’s forces from the Khor. This (Continued)This demand was complied with on the 29th October. At the same time a promise was extracted from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi thuc he would not take any retaliatory action. (iv) Khalifah bin Zayid died peacefully at Buraimi at the reputed age of 108 years. He was the uncle of Shaikh shaihbut bin sultan bin Zayid, the present Ruler of Abu Dhabi. He played a pro minent part in the affairs of Abu Dhabi and was Shaikh Shakhbut’s chief adviser and confidant. H.B.M.'s Political Agent, Bahrain. NS.

Medical Officers Captain A.G.T. Matthews, I.A.M.C. throughout the year II. MERICA&amp;. (a) General. The Municipality were unable to find a successor to Saiyid Abbas bln F&amp;lsal, whose services as Director of Public Health were terminated last year. In so far as his time al lowed . the Agency Surgeon assisted in the supervision of anti- malarial measures and sanitation, but lack of equipment, the reluctance of the public to permit inspections of house pro perty, and the absence of any responsible official in the Mu nicipality to carry out any suggestions made, rendered progress difficult. Towards the end of the year, some improvement in public health measures was manifest due, principally, to the personal interest taken by the new President of the Municipality, Saiyid Tarlq bin Taimur. (b) Agency Hospital. The hospital was open throughout the year. Although some difficulty was experienced in obtaining cm adequate sup ply of drugs, particularly quinine, attendance figures showed a substantial Increase. Nith the end of the war, it became possible to consider the general improvement of facilities available at the hospital and generous support for the achieve ment of the object was received from all communities. The attendance figures were as unders (1) New cases 9376 (2) Total number of cases treated during the year 24798 (3) Average dally attendance 68 (4) Total admitted to hospital 211 (5) Major operations (emergency) 2 (6) Minor operations •• 43As before, the chief cause of Illness was malaria, a total of 2409 patients being treated for this ailment alone. Cerebel symptoms were obserred in some of these »as|s. On ly a very small proportion of patients treated £*em malaria had been Infected outside Muscat. The incidence of malaria appears to be considerably higher in Mutrah than in the town of Muscat. Other prevalent diseases were ulcers, digestive diseases, diseases of the eyes, malnutrition and venexal diseases. Unusual cases Included two of snake-bite from Rus sel's vipers, and the treatment of three fishermen bitten by sharks outside Muscat harbour. Quarantine. Muscat was free from epidemics during the year. No quarantine measures were necessary in the case of stea mers visiting Muscat. One case of small-pox was found on a dhow in April, but no subsequent cases occurred. Extensive repairs to buildings at the quarantine station at Haramil, which suffered considerable damage from the heavy rains of the previous year, were undertaken by the Muscat Government. A permanent guard for the quarantine station was appointed in May and shortly afterwards the Muscat Govern ment appointed officials to examine all persons entering Mutrah and Muscat either by overland routes or by dhow. III. POLITICAL SITUATION. (a) Tribal In the first three months of the year it seemed likely that a dispute between the Muscat Government and the Beni Ka'ab supported by the Beni Qltab and Awamlr tribes, might assume serious proportions. The cause of the dis pute was an unfortunate decision to appoint Salyld Moham med bln Hilal as Wall of Shlnas. This wall had previously been involved in a quarrel with the Beni Ka'ab and had, without reference to the Muscat Government, attempted its settlement by ruthlessness. His actions, which culminated in the execution of one of the tribesmen by firing him from the mouth of a cannon, had necessitated his immediate removal; but they had not been forgotten by the Beni Ka'ab. On be ing re-posted to Shinas, the dispute broke out again and on this occasion the Chief Wall, with the concurrence of the Minister for External Affairs, decided to support Salyld Mohammed. Keeping well in the background himself, the Chief Wall despatched arms, ammunition and money to Shinas, but when it became evident that the tribesmen were not to be Intimidated by such a move, he hastily reversed his at titude and Saiyld Mohammed was once again removed from his post. With the appointment of a new Wall, conditions at Shinas returned to normal. Later in the year, news that the Imam was seriously ill led to developments which are likely to have important consequences in the future. His Highness has always regarded the death of the Imam as the moment for him to attempt to ¥ restore•3 restore the authority of his dynasty in Oman. With the knowledge that the Imam could not be expected to lire much longer, he has been anxious for some time to establish closer relations with the Shaikhs of the Beni Bu All, the Beni Riyam and the Hlrth group, the three most powerful tribes in the Interior. The first indication that an approach to the tri bal leaders might meet with satisfactory response, came in a friendly letter from Shaikh Isa bln Saleh of the Shar- qlyah (Hirth), the Inlands most influential supporter, in which he stated that he Intended to take no part in any questions concerning future of the Imamate. Shortly after wards, the Sultan was much gratified to receive letters from Shaikh All bln Abdullah of the Beni Bu All and Shaikh Sulaiman bln Hamiy&amp;r of the Beni Riyam asking to see him at Sur as early as possible. On his way to Muscat in May, the Sultan met these two Shaikhs at Sur and arranged for them to come to Muscat as his guests. The ensuing talks at Muscat gave him great satisfaction and convinced him that the Ghafiri confederation,of which Shaikh All and Shaikh Sulalman cure the leaders,would support hi* in his aims. Of the attitude of the rival Hlnawi faction, the Sultan was less certain; but when Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, the leader of the tiinawis, visited him at Muscat later in the year there was every indication that more friendly relations than had hitherto existed, had been established between them. Though His Highness was aware that political action would be the main stay of any success he might achieve in the unifica tion of his state under his rule, the need for sufficient force to discourage opposition led him to approach the Po litical Agent for an indication of the support he might expect from His Majesty's Government. In making the ap proach, His Highness stated that whatever advice were given him in regard to his alms by the British Government he would accept. He took the opportunity of discussing this question with the Hon'ble the Political Resident during the latter's visit to Muscat in December and the matter is now under consideration. The events already described Inevitably caused tension between the two great political factions in the interior, the Ghafiri and Hlnawi, each being Intensely suspicious of any move by the other which might upset the balance of power between them. In August, this tension showed signs of developing into open hostilities in the neighbourhood of the Wadi Beni Khalid - an area under the domination of the Beni Bu All of the Ghafiri faction. At the request of Shaikh All, and with the agreement of the Sultan, and Shaikh Sulaiman, a new Qadhi was appointed to ' this Radi in September from the Beni Riyam. On taking over charge, this Qadhi hoisted the Imam's flag and, at the mi tigation of Shaikh Isa bln Saleh, conducted his affairs under the Imam's name. Enraged by what he considered to be a Hinawi intrigue to usurp his authority. Shaikh All bln Abdullah of the Beni Bu All despatched a party to tear down the flag and to deal suitably the erring Qadhi. The dispute then took a more serious turn, for Shaikh Isa, con sidering that the Imam's authority had been Infringed, oc cupied the Radi by force and Shaikh All's men were forced to beat an ignominious retreat. The matter was eventually settled by the Sultan who, with his customary skill, turned thethe dispute to his own advantage by securing the agreement of all concerned to the appointment o.f a Qadhi from Muscat. It was further agreed that the new Qadhi should fly His - Highness* flag and conduct his affairs in the name of the Sultan. For the firstlirae in the recent history of Muscat, a representative of the Ruling Family, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur visited Dhahirah area. The visit was made in July and Au gust and Saiyid Tariq was well received throughout his tour. (b) Local. Ismail bin Khalil Ar Rassasei, Chief Wall and Wall of Mutrah together with Anwar al Kh&amp;tib, Headmaster of the Saldieh School, proceeded on leave to Palestine in July. Their places were taken by Saiyid Sultan bin Hamood and Saiyid Thuwaibi bin Shihab, respectively. It became evi dent during the month of Ramadhan that the former was not equal to the task of controlling affairs of Mutr&amp;h. Tension between the Khoja and Baluch communities, allowed to grow unchecked, led to stabbing affrays and a threat of serious rioting. The situation returned to nomal after ten ar rests had been made by the Muscat Government and the Poli tical Agent. Saiyid Saud bin All, Vali of Sur and one of Muscat's most capable officials was unfortunately forced to relinquish his charge in September owing to ill-health. He subsequently died at Mutrah in November. His place at Sur was taken by Saiyid Hamood bin Hamad pending the appointment of a permanent successor. The following transfers amongst Walls were made by the Sultan during the year: Saiyid Saud bin Badr from - Khassab to Gv«dur, Saiyid Hamad bin Hilal from Gwadur to Sur, to relieve Saiyid Haoood bin Hamad.

(2) The exchange rate of the Maria Theresa dollar, the local currency, remained fairly constant through out the year, opening at Rs.223/- per 100 M.T. dollars and closing at Rs.243/- per 100 ll.T. dollars. The highest rate was Rs*2o0/- recorded in July and the lowest Rs.213/- in June. (3) Trade conditions were as favourable as could be expected, except for the marketing of the date crop. Prices fetched for Muscat dates in India had, in previous years, been rising, but during 1945 the difficulty of transport, particular- lyfor distribution within India, caused a considerable drop in prices and losses* to a nucibcT of merchants.

ENFiff ACTIVITIES . mi. x. mm*' In common with the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, Muscat experienced a very unpleasant summer- Total rainfall during the year amounted to 18 cents and the absence of rain at the end of the year is generally regarded as a bad omen for the coning summer. PARI n . / i. MJM LM IM. (a) Bla Sajyld Said bln Talmur i His High- nesa the Sultan returned from India to Dhofar on the 12th Feb ruary in an aircraft provided by the United States Government. On the 4th April, he paid an official visit to M&amp;sirah island and inspected the various installations and buildings of the Royal Air Force, the United States Transport Command, the A^en Protectorate Levies and the British Oversec-s Airways Cor poration. In May, His Highness arrived at Muscat, where he stayed for the remainder of the year. His long absence from the capital of his State and the consequent inadequate supervision over the various depart ments of his Government had resulted In the standard of admi nistration falling to a deplorably low level. Immediately on arrival, His Highness set about the ranch needed re-organisa tion with vigour He took into his own hands the direction of financial matters and control of the Treasury, preparing himself the leng overdue budget. His Director General of Customs, who had previously acted as Finance Officer, was ins tructed to concern himpelf with Customs matters only. The control and distribution of essential supplies and the regu lation of price levels, in connection with which a number of malpractices and abuses had been allowed to go up, were placed on a mere satisfactory basis under his personal direction. His actions soon produced a very marked improvement in all branches of his administration. In March, His Highness requested the assistance of the Political Agent in securing the services of a British Of ficer to act as his principal Advisor and to undertake a number of executive and administrative responsibilities. War time conditions made it difficult to Find a suitable person for this post, and, upto the end of the year no appointment had been made. OnOn the occasions of the celebrations of the Allied victories over Genaany and Japan, His Highness of- ferred his most sincere congratulations on the achievements of His Majesty*e Forces in bringing about these victories. On various occasions he stated that he was very glad to feel that his territories had been of some use to His Ma jesty’s Government in the prosecution of the war* His Highness remained in excellent health throughout the year. (b) Saiyid Shihab bin Falsnl : A few days after the Sultan's arrival at Muscat, Saiyid Shihab tjHs removed fron Ms post as Minister for External Affairs. His High ness made no attempt to conceal the disgust he felt at the way in which, his representative had conducted himself during his absence. Saiyid Shihab left for India for medical treatment in September and returned to Muscat in December. (c) Saiyid Tajnur bin Faisal : The ex-Sultan paid his first visit to Muscnt, since abdication, on the 21st September and remained at Muscat till the end of the year. His arrival was celebrated with considerable eclat. Flags flew frovs Oovemrent offices, reaidences of the members of the Ruling Family and Muscat notables; Muscat buildings on the sea front were festooned with hunting, and sailing craft in harbour were gaily decorated. The reti nues of the various Shaikhs who had arrived at Muscat to meet him gave him the customary welcome by firing their rifles wildly in all directions - a proceeding fortunately not attended on this occasion by any casualties. The object of the ex-Sultan's visit was stated to be his desire to see his aged mother. His behaviour while at Muscat was unobjectionable. (d) Saiyid Ahmad bln Ibrahim : He remained in office as Minister for Internal Affairs throughout the year. (e) Saiyid Tapia bin Tnimur : He returned to Muscat on the 7th July after completing his administrative training in India. The Sultan had some difficulty in making up his mind as to how best to employ this formidable looking relative, but after good deal of discussion on the subject with the Political Agent, eventually agreed to appoint him as President of the Municipality. In snite of the Sultan's fears that Saiyid Terlq's temperament would prove unsuited to Municipal affairs, the appointment bar. so far been a dis tinct success. (f) Saiyid F&amp;hr bin Talnrur : He continued his education at the Fayo College, Ajmer. II. MUNICIPAL ATTOTf . Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur's appointment as Presi dent gave new life and prestige to the Municipality. A vi gorous campaign to clean up the towns of Muscat and Mutrah was undertaken. Prooerty owners were called upon to either repair or demolish derelict buildings, roads were widened and dangerous corners opened up. The conetruction of a soa-wall to protect + he road from Muscet to Mutrah was com menced, and for the first time a determined effort to improve sanitary conditions in the 'Sur' inhabited by the Khoja com munity was made.

The party worked in the Batinah area until March when they returned to Sharjah. A second visit by the same party was made in April. Two expeditions were planned to investigate locust breeding in the Interior; one from the north and the other from the south. Only the second of these expeditions was possible.

ANTI-LOCUST OPERATIONS, Anti-Locust operations were carried out at Gwadur during the first half of the year and it is understood that a considerable measure of success was achieved. serviceable by the Royal Air Force for use as an emergency landing ground. On the 28th of November an earthquake shock of con siderable intensity was felt at Gwadur. Some damage was done to buildings and, as the result of the tidal wave which followed iti three persons lost their lives. A small island some ten miles from the shore of the Vest Bay was thrown up by volcanic activity. Gwadur was fortunate to escape so lightly in view of the much more serious casualitles and damage reported from mother places on the Mekran coastline. vii. mjmwps A landing strip on the Gwadur Aerodrome was made mi. FARSflQVAP. Political Agent, Muscat.REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY FOR TOF, YEAR 1945. 1. Muecat Defencea. There Is nothing to add to last year’s report, the de fences are in good condition and nothing other than minor re pairs are required. It Is proposed to remove one 3 Pdr. gun from Bait-al-Falaj to the vicinity of the Mutrah Fort, where it will be in a position to cover the town of Mutrah and all entrances from the Batinah direction and also the coast road from Muscat to Mutrah. A revision in the defensive system will become necessary in the event of there being any alteration in the strength and armament of the Force, as the siting of piquets will be changed. This will also be affected by the II.T. situation. The situation regarding the 12 Pdr. 'Dahpu H Naval gun remains static. After the first burst of enthusiasm by the Navy nothing ftcrther has happened, and it rather looks as if it is to become a permanent monument in the same way as the Dahpu herself who continues to disfigure the harbour. The two 2.75 guns are in serviceable condition although the supply of spare parts asked for in 1944 has not been received. It is presumed that these are in very short supply as, so far as is known, this gun is not used anywhere else except by the Tochi Scouts who have some, I believe as Post guns at Miranishah and Datta Khel in the Tochi valley in ttasiristan. 2. Launch . The launch has been out of order since March as a new Magneto was required. The old Magneto was repaired in Karachi but proved unsatisfactory. A new one was obtained from Bahrein at the beginning of December and the launch is now running well. A number of planks were replaced in the under water part of the hull during the summer, but a considerable number still require replacing dwing to worms. A new keel is also required (see Annual Report for 1943)• It is considered that the present under water pert of the hull will give at least another year’s service, and it is my opinion that further repairs would be a watte of time ane money until seasoned teak and copper nails become available. The iron nails used in repairs a few months ago have already started ’’weeping”. 3 . Mrqiess. There has been no change in the situation. Various firms have been approached with a view to having the sets put in order and providing a suitable wireless mechanic to install them, and to obtain operators, but no satisfactory answers have been peceived. The Cable and Wireless Comjttny are of the opi nion that iti$dcubtful whether a sufficient^ highly qualified man could be obtained for much under Rs.800/- p.m. The makers, the Premier Radio Company have been add ressed a number of times with a view to obtaining blueprints of the sets as none were sent with the sets, but no answer has been received. Mr. Howell of the Cable and Tireless Company very kindly locked at the sets and is of the opinion that repairs to the damaged s» v t»s •..• 2 &lt; sets night be done locally. He has off erred to attempt to put some in working order when he has the time, but to work them efficiently he says that it Is essential to have operators who can read and write English reasonably fluently. If the sets were installed between here and Salalah he is of the opinion that, under the International Convention, it would be necessary to apply to Geneva for the necessary wave-lengths to prevent interference with other stations 4- Strength. The Force has been 24 under strength on the average. To all intents and purposes no recruits are coming in either from Muscat territory or Mekran. Coolies are still being em ployed at Maslrah and this undoubtedly affects recruiting. It has been suggested that each hall be asked to sup ply a certain number of men. They would be enlisted for five years with the dolours and five on the Reserve. During the reserve period they would be called up for 6 weeks training per year. If this scheme were adopted a strong reserve of trained men would be built up for the future should the neces sity arises. Desertions this year are considerably lees than in the three previous years. This is due, in my opinion, to the easier living conditions, and will drop to practically nil as conditions improve during the post-war period. Subedar Major AllakDad is due to retire in February, and although he wishes to stay on, I think it is time he went. Re is 9 getting too old for the work and is blocking promotion. He received the O.B.I. Second Class in the New Tear Honours. Jemadar (local Subedar) Shaikh Mohd continues to work well; although not particularly outstanding he is a good steady type and quite suitable for the work. Jemadar Ahmed Sher baa reverted to Military duty and has been replaced by Subedar Ahmed Khan. This was an error, as the replacement should have been a Jemadar. However in the event of Subedar Major Alla Dad retiring, I propose making Subedar Ahmed Khan Subedar Major. He appears to be excellent and is young which is all important. It is essential that the replace ment sent for Alla Dad should be a Jemadar and not a Subedar. The Consul has been asked to get a V.C.O. with M.T. and/or Machine Gun Training. Jemadar Fakir Mohd is due to go and it has been agreed to give him 6 months salary and I am trying to find other work for him.. I hesitate to discharge an officer with his service and without &amp; pension as it is unlikely that he has saved any money at all. Jemadar Lashkaran is average, but it is doubtful if he would fill the post of Havildar in the Indian Anqy. Lack of education is the great drawback to all local officers as they are, to all intents and purposes, unable to read Roman Urdu, which la the language in which all the Training Manuals are written. This lack of education also prevents men being sent on courses. If money&gt; If money permitted, it is agr opinion that it would be a good scheme to have a cadre of Indian Ariqy N.C.Og here for at least a year. On the basis of 2 per company they would be ad ditional to the ordinary strength and would therefore not block promotion. They would act in an advis6ry capacity If this scheme were decided upon it is thought that they would notybe obtainable. 5- Training. (a) Training has been carried out as usual and is eonsi- dered to be xtac satisfactory in every way for the work for which the Force is intended. Training Camps have again been impossible owing to short age of Tentage and Transport, mainly the latter. Short schemes are held and, ae reported last year, are considered more bene ficial than long cemps, as with the type of man enlisted it is not possible to hold their interest for long periods. 0 The results of Cadre Courses have been better than usual as the standard has been set higher than previously and promo tion stopped if men have failed to qualify at the new standard. Individual and collective training has been carried out satisfactorily• (b) Signallers: All men, with one exception, have passed the Indian Army Tests in Flag, Hello and Lamp, and have worked well on schemes. An Instructor, however, is really necessary to keep the standard up. Since the departure of Jemadar Ahmed Sher we have no one from the Indian Army capable of dealing with this branch. The Signal havildar is good but is inclined to be a little lost when dealing with FJLectrical equipment. (c) Artillery: The standard, as before, is exceptionally good considering the very low standard of education, All practice shoots have produced excellent results. It is unfor tunate that owing to lack of transport we have been unable to carry out shoots at any great, distance from Bait-al-Falaj. During the year no shoots were carried out with the 3 Pdr. guns owing to shortage of ammunition, none havwing been available during the previous two years. This has now been received and shoots will be carried out in the near future. (d) Machine guns: The results this year show a consider able improvement despite the fact that the funs are greatly overdue for overhaul and replacement. It is hoped that with the end of the war this will now be possible. Jemadar Lashkaran is still in charge and is very keen. The gun drill and general handling is as good as I have seen in any Indian Army Unit. The standard of Range Taking is below average and consi derably more attention will be paid to this during 1946. (•) Weapon Training.4* i C -4- (•) Weapon Training: The standard is generally good. All officers and men armed with the pistol fired the Course as laid down* There were two failures. Both these non passed after further practice. We are suffering at present from the lack of a properly qualified Armourer, our own hawing deserted in India. Requests are being made for a replacement from India. It is believed that the Baluch Regt. who have helped us in the past may possibly be able to provide a suitable man. Grounds Training has been carried out but practice with 'live* bombs was not possible is our indents for 1944 had not been filled. This has now been rectified and bombs and Detona tors have been received. Recruit Course . Total Y.G. Good Fair 55 2 . 26 7 Trained Soldiers .

In last year’s report it iras stated that it was proposed to attempt to bread a mule with a view to using them in future for 2.75 guns This has not yet been possible as, owing to an unfortunate liaison the mere is in foal to a ©tallion. The e*tr&amp; fodder grown at Ruwi and Bait-al-Falaj was sufficient for all animals up to the end of October. Since then a certain amount has had to be purchased outside. Unfortunately the heavy rain last year which caused the F&amp;laj to flow for the first time in many years does not appear to have had any lasting effect as dried up in the middle of the year The damage to the various channels was very great and we have been working throughout the year clearing the stoppages. (b) M.T.i Please see reports for 1943 and 1944* Our M.T to all Intents and purposes has been non-existent. Two 30 cwt. Chevrolets were sent to Karachi for repair but were 'written off' by the I.workshops as beyond repair. We have managed to keep one lorry going by stripping the fourth which was also unserviceable. This lorry can do the journey between Muscat and Mutreh, but the radiator has to be filled up eight times in the 4^ miles. The old R.A.F. lorry has been purchased fyom the Consulate and although this requires a lot of attention, it is helping us to carry on. The Government of India has agreed to supply four lorries. It is now learned that they are 15 cwt. and second hand Fords. They are apparently in Bombay and shipment is being delayed pending the receipt of an Export Permit. ~ ' -&gt;* * It appears that the issue order for these lorries was published in Delhi in January 1945 and received in Bombay in December 1945. We now hold a very large stock of Chevrolet spare parts as a result of the past three years* indents. All these spares arrived too late to be of any use and will have to be returned or disposed of and Ford spares indented for. The same applies to tyres, of which we have a considerable stock. 9. Medical; Captain Matthews, the Agency Surgeon, continues to officiate as our Medical Officer. His report is appended below: ANNUAL HEALTH REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY from let January' 1945 - 31ct December 1945. The general health of the Unit has not been very satisfac tory. Although there was no epidemic of an infectious nature, nevertheless the numbers of sick have been high. I feel that the summer of 1945 must be regarded as accounting a great deal for this rise in sick numbers. During May, June and July the average maximum temperature was 100° C to 102®C. The wet bulb reading was between 94°C to to 98°C. With a high maximum temperature and a relatively high humidity reading, a very dangerous period exists. Fortunately no casesno eases of Heat Fffects or Heat Exhaustion occurred, but un doubtedly the large numbers of men who suffered from ulcers, relapses of malaria, and those unable to recover from the most trivial of injuries, was due to a very lowered vitality fol lowing a severe summer. Th/e reason Heat Effects etc. were not contracted was due to the lay-out of Barrack Rooms which always had fresh currents of air passing through and at no time had a more humid atmosphere than the outside air. amaaaa Actual Ratio per 1000 1S45 1944 1945 1944 Average strength 300 300 (excluding 10% on leave) of Unit Total admitted to 111 Hot recorded 370.00 hospital Average constantly 3 Not recorded 10 00 • sick in hospital Sick in Barracks 506 328 1687.00 1093.30 Average constantly 14 Not recorded 46.60 - sick in Barracks Deaths in hospital 1 Nil 3.3© - Deaths out of hos- 1 1 3.30 3.30 pltal Discharged as medl- 4 5 13*30 16 30 cally unfit gTATJtSTICM,, ‘Mas , 3 ,, (Diseases) Actual Ratio per 1000 1945 1944 1945 1944 Malaria 174 93 $80.06 310.96 Qyphllls 8 27 26.66 90.00 Gonorrhoea 9 43 30.06 143.30 Diseases of diges- 15 7 50.00 23.30 tive system Diseases of respl- 18 13 60.00 43-30 ratory system Diseases of the eye 13 11 43.33 36.60 Dysentery 10 9 7 33.33 30.00 Diarrhoea 4 13-30 23.30 Minor septic 163 51 643*33 170 06 diseases Local injuries 49 36 163.33 120.00 Infectious fevers Nil 3 - 10.00 All other causes 23 7 76.66 23.30 CommentaryCcnanentary i A v«ry sstisfRctory decrease in V.D. is noted above.

One snake-bite (Vipbr) was admitted to Hospital. he recovered but where he was bitted the muscle necrosed and the man was lame. a •Sanitation and health matters are closely watched by those in authority. When wire gauze is available I would suggest the cook house and hospital being made fly-proof, The men*s food is receiving a lot of attention from the O.C. and has definitely improved. Men are also being encouraged to eat more vegetables. The senior Z.O. with the other officers take an interest in the sen's games, and the Unit lias the best hockey team in Muscat and Mutrah 10. Rations . The scale of rations remains as before and is considered by the M.O. to be sufficient. Atta (no rice available) l£ lbs. The extra messing still remains at As.3/- per man wh‘ch is just sufficient to cover the cost of Misala etc. The following ag vegetables are supplied from our garden at Ruwl during the cold weathers Cauliflower; Knon-khol; Cucumber: Brinjal; Cabbage; Pumpkin; Chillies Ladies fingers; Tomatoes; Melons; Spinach Garlic; Turnips; Radish; Beetroot; Beans. As reported before the men do not care for many of the vegetables other than Radish, Brinjal, Ladies fingers. However I insti tuted a 'parade* and each man had to eat one raw tomato a day. This according to the M.O. has had a definite beneficial effect. It appears now that the men are becoming more 'green vegetable minded'. As meat is prohibitive it is proposed as soon as the opportunity occurs to start breeding rabbits on a large scale. This, it is hoped, will be of some use in filling in the meat deficiency.

A number of games have been purchased for use in this Canteen and it is hoped that it will be well patronised and keep men away from the basaar This is more than likely as they will be allowed monthly credit which is not available to them in the basaar. Ball are played regularly. The Hockey team has now won the Consulate Club Cup three times running. A seven a side Hockey Tournament has been organised by the Maqbul Club but owing to the w professional ism” being shown by other teams in the wetter of holding up rames in order to see how many points are required before two teams of another Club can make certain of winning the cup it can hardly be called an unqualified success.

CONSUlitTE gersonnel .—» Major A.C. Stewart, O.B.E., held charge throughout the year as Consul. Captain W*R # Eowson held charge as Vice-Consul ' till the 25th January, and Mr. W.P. Keelan from the ?th February till the end of the year. Consular Statistics .— British Subjects in the Area 4995 Passports issued 415 Passports renewed 146 Endorsements granted 2668 Visas granted 475 Briths registered 40 Deaths registered 14 Marriages performed 7 Documents legalised, attested, etc. ... 1898 Shipping Protests registered 29 Fees levied ; £2198-9-6. 11^-- ,BRITISH INTERESTS Trade .— There is now an embryo Trade Section in this Consulate, for the promotion of British and Indian trade in this area. It is in the charge of H.M. Vice-Consul, and its further development depends on the receipt from India and the United Kingdom of trade lists, catalogues, pamphlets, samples, etc. Its present functions are limited to answering questionnaires as to the local demand for particular manufactures. There has been an almost complete absence of British and Indian goods in the market, due chiefly to the fact that orders are not accepted owing to the short supply position in both countries. I Ando-Iranlan Oil Company.— The Order-ln-Council, under 1 the Defence Regulations of 1939, preventing the Company^ employees from leaving Iran without the permission of H.M.Ambassador, Tehran, was rescinded on October 1st. The withdrawal relieved H.M.Consul of the very unpleasant \ task of dealing with discontented and recalcitrant employees. In practice, only the Britishers were affected ! by the Order, owing to transport and recruitment difficulties, and there were no cases of Indians being held to their posts against their will, even though they came under the provisions of the Order. Apart from this, and the almost |universal demand for married quarters, most of the employees appeared reasonably contented: they were adequately paid, and the food and clothing made available to them under the Company^ rationing system kept them better off than they would have been in their homelands. Projected operations include the provision of accommodation for the Company's greatly increased staff, and extensive new drilling operations in the 'Fields'* area, at Agha Jari. •III.- FOREIGN INTiaUtota Kepresentatlon .— The Iraqi Vice-Consul still is the only other foreign civil representative in the area. This appointu.ent was held by Ur. Khalil Ibrahim from the beginning of the year till the 21st October, and thereafter by Mr. P.D. Azoo, the head Clerk, who officiated till the end of the year. Trade .-- About the only imported goods to be seen on the market throughout the year were those of American manufactures beauty preparations, sun goggles, etc. were always available, and immediately on the cessation of hostilities with Japan, fresh supplies of these together with large consignments of glassware, oil lamps and second-hand winter clothing arrived from the ti.G.A. The arrival of the clothing was timely, and kept prices down to a reasonable level. \ Russian crockery and sugar appeared in some shops at the end of the year. Significance however attaches to the frequent visits to Khorramshahr of the Russian Consul at Ahwaz, who on these occasions showed great Interest in the newly-built jetties at Sentab, and who went to no little trouble to obtain figures of imports from Britain, India and the b.S.A. At the very end of the year, a branch of the American-Iraqi Shipping Company, whose main office is at Basrah, was established at Khorramshahr for the purpose of shipping away all surplus B.S. .army supplies. It is understood, however, that it will remain permanently as a trade rival to British shipping agencies. Ustandar (Governor-General).-- The appointment was held by Aghal Uisbah Fatemi throughout the year. Farmandar (Governor).— Khorramshahr and Abadan continued to be separate governorates, under civil and military authority respectively. Aghai Hassan Mateen remained Governor of Khorramshahr throughout the year, except for the period from 30th June to 27th November when he was absent on leave, and during which time Aghai Mahmud Darwish, Mayor of Khorramshahr, officiated. Sarhang (Colonel) Mohamed Sadlq Daulatshahi who has been Military Governor of Abadan since late in 1943, retained the appointment throughout the year. He was the object of anonymous complaints and of Press attacks on the score of corruption, from which he was acquitted by a Court of Inquiry set up in January. Owing to continued libellous attacks, he on more than one occasion threatened to resign, but was persuaded to remain, while attempts were made to silence his detractors. Throughout the period of his charge he has proved to be helpful and cooperative. Since the end of the War, the question has been discussed as to whether the Military Governorate should be abolished, or not? it was decided to allow it to continue at least until the Allied forces evacuate the country. SinceFarmandar (continued) ''/o Since its inception in 1943, no separate budget has been sanctioned for the Military Governorate* Ji-dlciary .—■ Aghai Ashraf Ahmedi held the appointment of President of the Abadan Court throughout the year. P olice ,-- Sarhang (Colonel) Vighar was Chief of Police, Abaden, throughout the year. Sarwan (Captain) Hussain Nikokar was Chief of Police, Khorrainchahr, throughout the year. Gendarrerie .— Sarwan (Captain) Heza Hakimi was Chief of Gendarmerie, Khorramshahr and Abadan, till the month of July, when he was succeeded by Captain Hamimi. Health .— Dr. Reza Nighabat held the appointment of Quarantine and Medical Officer throughout the year. In April, a severe epidemic of typhus took a heavy toll of life in the district of Shadegan. A noticeable decrease in the number of mosquitos is probably due to the spraying with crude oil, of all the creeks and stagnant pools in Khorramshahr, by the Americans. Municipality .— Aghai Mahmud D&amp;rwish was Mayor of Khorramshahr till the 2£th November, when he was succeeded by Aghai Shukrullah Manuchchri. In April, the Central Government sanctioned the levy of new taxes by the Municipality. The Karun embankment, begun in January, was completed by the end of the year. In the Spring, the construction of a new drainage system, and the asphalting of roads was begun. The end of the year saw the completion of the asphalting of most of the lanes inside the town, and of the pavements only along the main streets. Trade and Commerce .— The institution of a Chamber of Commerce for Khorramshahr and Abadan was sanctioned by the Central Government. In May, elections to a nine- member committee took place, and Aghai Abraishamkar was elected President. The Chamber^ first meeting was held in June. In July, shares were floated for the formation of a trading company, to be named 'The Khuzistan Commercial and Engineering Company', which would deal mainly with imports and whose endeavour it would be to centralise trade in Khuzistan. There is still no indication that the required capital has been subscribed. Education .— Aghai All Asghar Fayyaz was Director of Education throughout the year. In April, the Education Department closed one of its primary schools from lack of accommodation. The re-opening- 4 - (continued) The re-opening of schools after the summer holidays was delayed for lack of teachers. In June* the merchants of the town formed a committee, of which the Director of Education became a member, to examine the prospects of improving the condition of the schools of Khorramshahr• It was decided that two new schools should be built, ho provision for teachers appears to have been made. Allied Fcrcfcs .-- The only British military forces in Iran air those stationed at Ahwag end in this area, i and the end of the year saw the transfer of authority from the British to the Persians in a very advanced stage. This transfer process has been going on ever since the end of the Japanese fcar, and is being carried out gradually end systematically in accordance with pre-arranged and agreed plans so that the Persians will be in complete control of the area at the time when the British troops finally evacuate the country through this port. On the 30th December, the American forces completed the evacuation of Persia by moving out of Khorratsshahr. They left behind a party of 20 men attached to the American-lraqi Shipping Company, and 70 in the Air Base at Abadan, all of whom now wear civilian clothes. It is understood that the aerodrome is now being operated by T.W.A. under a temporary agreement arrived at between the United States Government and the Persians, tc facilitate the repatriation of American troops from India and the Far East* along this route. No final decision as to the fate of the Karun Hull Bridge has been reached, but it is expected that it will be dismantled and towed away to Basrah. The Persians wish it to remain, but the problem of its maintenance arises, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are not interested. Moreover, administrative difficulties arise over its sale to the Persians by the British, as the material was received under Lend-Lease. Iranian Army .— In April, a battalion of about 400 officers and men arrived from Ahwaz as a permanent garrison for Khorramsh&amp;hr. Its Commanding Officer is Major Rashid Nadirkhani. At present, the Garrison is accommodated in the former Persian Naval Base at Kfcorramshahr. Iranian Navy .— The Naval Base at fhorramshahr, which was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in August 1941 and transferred to the British Military authorities in mid- 1S45 for use as a hospital, was handed over to the Persians on December 22nd, Owing to the non-existence of a Persian Navel administration, the hand-over was conducted with representatives of the Persian Ministry of War. At—X - 5 - Ir.anlm.Mrg (continued) &gt;' . At about the same time a number of the ex-Navy’s river craft and the tug 'Soyrou' wore returned* Further restitution of vessels is to follow as soon as re conditioning has been completed. All this has led to expectations of the Persian Navy’s revival. On the £th of July, the Steam Yacht 'Ivy'' sank at her moorings alongside the Naval Base jetty, its hull having rotted from disuse and lack of repair. Its salvage was fixed as a Naval-responsibility, but eventually, at the end of the year, the Admiralty came to the decision that salvage operations would not be undertaken by then because they would be uneconomical. The Persians are now considering the sale of the vessel as scrap. BecurltY T— Aidesoread pilferage of commercial and military cargoes continued, as also incidents of hooliganism. The former has been kept in check by the activities of the Port Security authorities, aided by the Field Security Section. Hooliganism was dealt with by expelling under Military Governorate Law, many of the loafers and other undesirables from the town. In about the middle of the year, robberies in the European residential areas of Abadan had so Increased in number, and became so daring in character, that the question of establishing a corps of special constables, recruited from among the huropoan employees of the Company, was considered. The proposal was dropped however, owing to administrative and practical difficulties. The departure of Allied troops from Persia, and the Inadequacy of the Police and Gendarmerie forces in I thjs area, are likely to encourage an increase in thefts \ and smuggling, in the towns, and of brigandage on the trunk roads which run mostly through tribal territory. To counter this threat, it has been decided that in the interim period while the Police and Gendarmerie forces are being brought up to their required strength, the Persian military forces should be used to buttress them? and, to ensure co-ordination of the activities of these three Services, the General Officer Commanding, Khusistan Army Division, has been appointed as the co-ordinating authority in the matter of security in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s areas and in the event of operations. Smuggling and piracy, of the latter of which there were a few incidents in the vicinity of Gusba, at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab, were sought to be countered by the establishment of the International River Patrol, which is composed of a few motor launches, each of which comprises a crew of Iraqi and Persian Police and Customs personnel, commanded by a British Military Policeman. At the beginning of December, there came to light a quite unexpected source for the illegal acquisition of arms: the crews of American merchant vessels visiting Abadan from Far Eastern ports were discovered to be selling iodally, Japanese weapons which they had been given as souvenirs, or purchased at places like Singapore. A number of these weapons were seized by the Field Security Section in the act of being sold, and the control measures which have since been taken, have ensured the drying up of this source of arms traffic.V s it u ation Throughout the year, the tribes of this area were remarkably quiet. This fortunate state of affairs may be attributed to the presence of the Allied occupation troops, and to the employment they afforded the local inhabitants. It is difficult to predict to what degree security will be affected when these restraining and palliative influences are removed. The year was only barely uneventful however, for on January 10th this year, Shaikh Abdullah, the fourth and slightly demented son of the late Shaikh khazal Khan (formerly Shaikh of Mohommerah) ilegally entered Khorram- shahr from Iraq with a following of armed retainers, and established himself in one of his father's old palaces at Failiyeh, after evicting the four gendarmes who were stationed there. However, on receiving no rally from the local tribes, and finding the Persian force, which the General Officer Commanding, Khuzistan Army Division, had sent against him with commendable promptitude, to be too strong for him, Abdullah withdrew the same night. His precipitate retreat was probably also caused by receipt of the news that Iraqi troops were taking up positions along the frontier to effect his arrest should he try to re-enter Iraq. Abdullah therefore sought sanctuary in Kuwait. The attack was not altogether a surprise, for reports were received in December that Abdullah was agitating among the Iraq tribes on the border for action which woiild effect the restoration of the Khazal Family's fortunes in Khuzistan. It was considered however that Abdullah had no real following, and that his was only a hare-brained scheme which would, at most, prove only of nuisance value if it was carried out. Nevertheless, all precautions were taken against such an eventuality. (SGD) A.C.STEWART.

Although most of the information in this Report has already been received and will be found on other files, it provides a useful sumnary of events in the Persian Gulf in 1944- Attention is drawn to the Political Residents review of the year, pages 1 to 8. Trade restrictions^ the shortage of shipping and 1 the universal scarcity of food presented a major problem on both sides of the Gulf; lack of rice and the control of the export of dates from Iraq causing considerable hardship on the Arab Coast. Though prices decreased slightly during the year, they were still abnormally high compared with those of 1939. irM. &lt;$* There wet® a recrudescence during this period of gun-running across the Gulf and of thefts of arms and ammunition from the R.A.F. in the Arab States and from the Army in Persia. (Page nos.quoted are those in pencil in the top right-hand corner of the page)• Chapter I. BUSHIRE. (pages 9 to 21) The prosperity of Bushire was considerably affected by the closing down of the U.K.C.C.Truck Assembly /Planti Plant which threw many people out of work* Trade was slack due in a large part to restrictions of exports from India and to the lack of shipping, though by the end of the year B*I.steamers were calling more regularly and merchants were able to obtain some shipping space for the export of local products. The cost of living remained very high compared with pre-war levels. In spite of the partial crop failure owing to lack of rain, the cereal^ supplies of the town were comparatively well maintained. Cultivators were able to engage in record sowings thanks to seed wheat supplied by the Government of India. Security on the Bushire—Shiraz road improved towards the end of the year but the condition of the road, no longer maintained by the British authorities, deteriorated. The Tribal Areas were comparatively &lt;juiet under the control of their local chiefs with little interference from the Persian Government. Relations both official and social between the Consulate- General and the Persians were most friendly. The Bushire Reading Room and Club were well patronised. The sale of periodicals was maintained and the visits of the cinema van from Shiraz most popular. Chapter 4. KERMAN AND YEZD (Pages 23 to 40) Owing to war-time restrictions there was little trade with foreign countries though some carpets were exported to America. Thanks to the work of the Consular Liaison Officer, Major Hassan, the food position both in Kerman and Yezd was satisfactory. The American Director-General of Finance,who arrived about the middle of the year, made great efforts to ensure the proper distribution of monopoly goods, he was less successful, however, in his endeavours to check corruption in the Economic and Finance Department. A general state of insecurity existed throughout 1944 both in the Kerman and in the Yezd Areas, the operations of the Indian Long Range Squadron on the Kennan-Zahidan route doing less to discourage banditry than had been hoped. The gendarmerie, as elsewhere in Persia, were hopelessly inefficient and ineffective and in some cases openly connived at robberies and hold-ups. Allied successes swung -public opinion both in Kerman and Yezd from apathy and even hostility to whole-hearted belief in Allied victory, ‘and Anglo-Persian relations both social and official became most cordial. Persian broadcasts from London and Delhi were popular, as were cinema shows, and the Reading Rooms were well patronised. Local distrust of the Russians grew during 194A*At the end of the year a branch of the Tudeh opened at Yezd. Chapter 3. BANDAR ABBAS (Pages 41 to 44) The state of security in the Bandar Abbas District was exceptionally good during 1944 “ pleasant contrast to the rest of Persia. Owing to restrictions on the export of goods from India and the Trucial Coast, the volume of trade at this port was comparatively small. Chapter 6. KOWEIT (Pages 45 to 52) The investiture of the Sheikh with the K.C.S.I. demonstrating his excellent relations with H.M.G., was the occasion for a remarkable demonstration of loyalty to their ruler on the part of the people of Koweit. Relations between the Political Agent and the Sheikh were most cordial, and His Highness continued to give every possible help to the fighting services. In April 1944 the Sheikh proclaimed an amnesty for the political prisoners, who led the agitation against him in 1939. /The(11704) \Vt.2(i090/l J .28^ 10,000 0/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 /A t ♦ ♦ Minute Paper. Department. w/ The cost of living in Koweit continued to be very high, but the distribution of rationed foodstuffs and of piece-goods was improved and price control extended. The working of the G-overnment of India’s Established Shippers’ procedure left many loophopes for traffidlng in quotas, etc. which were fully exploited both by Arabs and Indians, The Bedouin suffered from the scarcity of rice but the grazing was plentiful owing to excellent raj^s early in the winter. The Water Supply Co. allowed their water-ships to fall into disrepair and the consequent water shortage would have become serious but for timely help from the Koweit Oil Co. who ran water barges from Abirdan. Relations with Saudi Arabia continued friendly. Smuggling from Iraq was much reduced, but the Iraq Government gave the Sheikh fresh cause for complaint by refusing transit facilities for goods consigned to Koweit through Basrah. Chapter 5. BAHREIN AND THE TRUCIAL COAST (Pages 53 to 78) Much of the information in this chapter has already been received in the Administration Report of the Government of Bahrein but Section 18 (pages 65 to 69) about the activities and construction programme of the Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd. is of interest. A partial settlement of the long-standing dispute between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Qatar over the ownership of Zubarah on the West Coast of Qatar Peninsular was effected in July, both Sheikhs signing an agreement under which formal relations between them were resumed, but the question still rankles in the mind of the Sheikh of Bahrein. The problem of the provision and distribution of food was dealt with most efficiently by the Pood Control Department, the Bahrein Government not only purchased essential foodstuffs for retail to the public but also Indian cotton piece-goods which were sold to the poorer members of the general public at 5/£ only above cost. In September the United States of America opened a Consulate at Dhahran on the mainland of Arabia, Bahrein was included informally within its jurisdiction ahd the Consul paid regular visits to the Oil Company's premises at Awali on Bahrein. There was a considerable increase in air traffic during the year but accommodation for B.O.A.C. passengers left much to be desired. During the year the number of R.A.F. and U.S. A. A.T.C. personnel stationed at Bahrein and Sharjah increased and a building programme for increased accommodation at Sharjah was put into operation. Cordial relations between and the Trucial Sheikhs were extended to some of the more remote tribes, in particular the Beni^ Qitab^and the Hinterland was to some extent 'opened up'. Companies farmed at IXibai and Sharjah for the distribution of cereals, the control of piece goods and to operate a barter system, functioned with great success. Chapter 8. MUSCAT (Pages 79 to 93) Little of importance appears to have happened in Muscat during this year. Various tribal disputes were settled satisfactorily. The Sultan spent the greater part of the year at Salalah, visiting Cairo and Jerusalem from April till June.A very interesting report on the Muscat Infantry by Captain/Temporary Major Hirst, Military Adviser to the Muscat Government, is attached to this chapter# Chapter 9. KHORRAMSHAHR (Pages 94 to 96 ) The year 1944 saw considerable developments in the port facilities at Khorramshahr and improvements in communications with the interior, which should lead to its increased importance as a trade centre when normal conditions return# Further development during the year of the Oil Refinery at Abadan meant an increase in the number of British subjects employed there# British and American forces served in the area during the year and there were some Russian soldiers in connection with the supply of lease lend goods to Russia# Proposals to establish a Russian Trade Agency at the port were rumoured but so far have come to nothing# O-VhV/ Pilferage among military/comnercial cargoes was widespread and led to the formation of a number of gangs which may prove a source of trouble to the Persian Government when the Allied Forces finally withdraw.

Trade generally f already slack 9 declined further and a small number of merchants ^ left for Uiiraz and elsewhere to better their position. (b) The Bushire town area and neighbourhood was occasionally insecwe during the first six months of the year and insecurity on v.he Bushire - Bhiraz read continued during the same period but the situation improved over the latter half of the year. This was popularly attributed to the fact that the German agents located with the ^asiiqai tribes had boon handed over. (c) The drinking water scheme for the town of Bushire, the inauguration of which was recorded in the last administration report, made some progress during tha first half of the year but left dormant for the summer months when the engineers in charge went to Tehran to escape the Bushire heat and tc obtain an increase in the budget for the scheme. At the request of tho Governor, the Political Resident lent his ^ood offices tc secure the release of some 1200 sections of iron piping fron the army authorities and • these arrived in August. Pork contiencod shortly afterwards on laying the section of piping from Bushire town to the reservoir constructed on a high point of Bushire islanc near Uhdur Bundur. Good progress on this section and on the digging work at the point of water supply at All Changi had been made by the end of the year but the whole of the ^lashileh section between BurJ-i-lluqam and All Changi remained to be covered by earthemware piping. (d) Owing to poor rainfall in the winter of 1943 - 1944 there was again a great shortage of water in the town. Here again this Consulate General was able to be of assistance- 4 . % by obtaining the loan of two water-tankers from the British Military authorities for the use of the Bushire Viater Company* These tanker lorries were of the greatest service in supplying water to the town until the first rains fell in November. aismjLU £§S&lt;i* ‘I** 1 ® condition of the main road to Shiras, which was no longer maintained by British authorities f deteriorated end thoiv.h pf;S 3 ablo without nnch difficulty, was . in need of repair and 'naintenance by the close of the year. The exceptionally heavy autumn rains caused small landslides on the ialu and hudak pasass which vere repaired, but net without holding up traffic, particularly a*I*O.C* tankers, for some days. The 'oad was ocoasionally insecure in tho first half of the year but improved thereeifter* The main read in Bushire town continued to deteriorate until its condition became so bad that by the end of the year the Municipality was obliged to take up the work of repair. Tills has commenced frrn the torr «nd and *^ill continue up to tho suburb of dangi. Travel on the unmade roads to Tangistan ond Pashti was occasionally subject to petty holdups but on the roads north towards Hiat Baud war secure. (b) Sea * Mail steamers were few and far between at the beginning of the year but an Improvement set in and by the end of the year two and occasionally three ships a iaonth were calling. Ships however shewed a tendency to bunch together instead of being spaced 2 *eguiarly. The M*V. Resang, which had maintained a circular run inside the Gulf approximately once a fortnight since 1942, was withdrawn towards the end of the year. A.X.O.C. tugs continued to assist corimunications with Khorramshahr and the North.(o) Air . No chung* is to be reported regarding Bushire Aerodrome which remained serviceable throughout the year with the exception of a few days in December after exceptionally heavy rain. The aerodrome, however, seems capable of absorbing up to alaost one inch of continuous rain without becoiaing unserviceable* The aaxftrings on hingah aerodrome were renewed in November and their visibility*is now reported to be good.

Tang1stan continued to be disturbed by occasional holdups, a contributing cause being thu poverty and hardship causod by alraost total crop failure* This area continued to bo lawless and disturbed but not beyond the normal degree.

(a) Relations *ith Persians continued most friendly, alike in the official and social spheres. Though the year saw great changes in the war situation which drought practically everyone to believe in an early and complete Alliad victory, it is not cut of place to rscore fchs officials and citizens of Pushirc, ever, at xhe ^jorst crises of the war, continued to maintain that well- disposed and cooper, tive attitude vijhich long standing and friendly relations with this Conaulate General seeu to r have anganderade Public relationa activities remained centred on the But hire Reading Hoob :md Club v.ith its me^ibership of over 200 leading officials and citizexia. tfore books were obtaired for the library section in the course of the year. When the cinema van was available a weekly cineiaa show on Thursday nights was instituted at idiich refreshments v/erc provided. The Club certainly annoys the best possible tribute wnich can be paid to it. It is invariably to bo found full of iieiabera listening to the radio, playing cards or takht-i-nard, reading the boohs, nev/ipapers, of magazines, drinking tsa, neating friends, or aven perhaps merely using the telephone. Reading Rooms continued to be maintained at Lingah and Borazjun. Ihe daily cyclostylod news bulletin in Persian, which was inaugurated in the spring of 194^,continued to be issued, paper supplies only setting the Unit for the number issued. Not only war news but iteias of interest to Persians broadcast from Radio Tehran are Included• The system of distribution of publicity matter by sale through agents, inaugurated at the close of 1^3 to replace free distribution, «?as maintained. Publicity matter, with the exception of the last two xaonths of the year, continued to be received regularly from Tehran and Delhi. Consideriz^; the comparative poverty of the area, 3 ai *-3 of periodicals have been well maintained despite the fact that periodicals are available for perusal in the Reading hooiis also. The eine^u- van centred on ohiraz was available in Buahlre for the early iontha of the year and again fro^ the ulddle of Koveiaher. Its popularity in a tom and areo without a cinema is yreat and It pjrovitios a fiiost fruitful instrument of propaganda. Towards the end of the year, Public Relations Bureau, Tehran, was completing arrangements for tlic sending of a 6 ii itaa. projector to Jushire.

There has been no appreciable change in the method or. rather, lack of method, of rationing these monopoly goods by the Persian Government dtiring the year ‘under review* Cloth was only issued once, in the beginning . 1 —•— - ' of the year, at the rate of 3 metres per head and no iijore was issued until the end of the year in spite of several petitions to the authorities# nufcar and tea were issued in the usual way to tow; inhauitants and to all outside districts through the agents of Khans. Very little of these allotments reached the peasants, the greater part being sold by the Khans in the black market at high rates. U) The harvest was very ,A&gt;or owing to lack of rain. Rain, however, fell heavily towards the end of the year enabling cultivators to engage in record sowings made possible by the timely arrival of 800 tons cf excellent seed wheat supplied by the Government of India. This wa»'~ the second year in succession in whloh tlie Govemment of India had come to the rescue by providing seed wheat. There is every hope of a bumper crop which will relieve all anxiety for the bread supplies of the bhahristan during the coming year. The date crop was good but as more transport was available the crop reached a wide market and local prices increased accordingly.VII jhlaolnK a nd Jonjorcla.!.. , («) Tii© ©©utraXisatioA of trade control in Tehran unclor th© Jwiddl© Kast Supply Coritr© and the Foreign Trad© Control Department of the Persian.

Blackwood, who arrived here from Australia to look after the women** section of the Hospital. The work done by the hospital continued to be excellent in spite of a shortage of European nursing staff. The charitable work has to a large extent been made possible by the monetary grants made by the Angl*-Iranian Relief Fund and their assistance in obtaining necessary drugs for the hospital.

Colonel i^utasham, the Chief of lolice, carried on the v*ork of the Governor General in audition to his own duties. The new Ustanaar, Aqai Fazlullah Bahrami, arrived from Tehran on the ^otn October, trom which date he held charge of the post for the remainder of the year. He has so far been on very inendly terms with this Consulate and shows signs of being as co-operative as his predecessor. Since his arrival he has £&gt;nown a keen desire to make improvements in the district, such as establishing permanent housing arrangements for the poor *na improving the existing water supply. (b) Farmander A.qai Reza Fahirai who had received orders of transfer to Tehran towards the end of 1943, left Kerman on the 15th -anuary, 1944. From that date the post of Farmandar was unoccupied for the remainder of the year. ^.qai Vosuq, who in%h!! e o*i ap ?w nteffl a *. iQ8p * ctor of the Ministry of the Interior in the 8 tli Uetan was however unofficially carrying out the autiee of rernandsr, J ' (ci iiconoaiic and finance Department tn i , ; r r ; T M&lt;i 3 * r J ari helcl ^e post of director of Finance bv 1 th« b *m^i^I ! i 54 01 '^^t, when i'.e waa auinmarily diamisaed w? ic 1 n director General ef Finance, Hr.

The post was vacant till the l?t ovember, when r. inami arrived from Tehran to fill the vacancy, which he occupied for the remainder of the year. th. and Fin8 “* e Departments have for long had ?L e Deing notoriously corrupt, and in spite of r.

The cniti- ^ 10w * v ® r j bad. a grivance against the Agricultural Depart- meat, which took over their crops, but was uiable tTpay for them except in xxm small sums, with the result that the^culti- tors lacked the money for further cultivation. * lth u ‘° re,ult «»» «&gt;. Buck is(e) Education Dc^»rt. f nent Mr. Ha**an Mubarhan held the poet of Director of iiduda- tion till 23rd «Xuly, when he went to Tehran on transfer. Mr. Afzal Roohi officiated from that date till oepteaiber 3rd, when Dr. Muzaffar Baqei arrived from Tehran to take up the appoint ment. Dr. Baqai ia a youn^ mon and ia a member of the Ibrahimi family. The following schools were established in Kerman ana in the Districts during the year *- Kerman. Chatrood Baghin. Mahon Bandar Abbas. One primary One primary One primary One primary Two primary boys' school girls' echool girls ' school mixed school schools (6 classes) (4 •» ) (4 M ) (4 ' ) (6 * ) 28 night classes, which included 3000 pupils, were opened in the Province. (f) Agricultural Bank Mr. Mukhtarian held charge of the Agricultural Bank till the end of August when he was transferred to Tehran, his place being taken by Sayed jawad loinzadeh, who arrived in Kerman on September 5th. Apart from money advanced to landlords, approximately 20,000 tomans were advanced to cultivators, to enable them to purchase farming implements, at the rate of interest per annum. (g) Department of Justice Sia Ibrahim (Shazdeh Soleiman Mirza) officiated as Chief Judge during the year. Agha NiJ^ Murad, the Public Prosecutor, was transferred to Yezd during the year, his place being taken by Mr. Alavi. Mr. Asadullah Aastigan was the assistant to the Public Prosecutor. This Department is, ironically enough, said to outdo all others in corruption. Most of the Judges h^ve recently graduated and have had little or no experience before coming to Kerman, where their primary aim is to line their pockets in the shortest possible time. (h) Police Colonel Yawar Suleiman Mutasham held the post of Chief of Police till ^©Member 29th, when he left for Tehran on leave. He was very popular with tha general public and was always ready to co-operatie with this Consulate. Though this depart- nent continued to be ill-equipped, it showed a noticeable improvement in other respects under his supervision. There was x general regret expressed at his departure. After his departure, the former Chief of Police at Raf- sinjan, Captain Hishmati, acted as Chief of Polite for the remainder of the year. He appeared to be a worthy successor to Colonel Mutasham, both in his work and in his dealings with thia Consulate. (i) Posts ana Telegraphs Mr. Ahmad Badri retained charge of the Department through out /wool /- 8 - out the year. The general opinion appeared to be that he ie more interested in the affairs of other departments than in his own and reports have been received to the effect that he is in the habit of disclosing the contents of telegrams to interested persons before delivery to the addressees. (j) Health Department Dr. Ali AJcbar Vakili held the po*t of ivedical Officer Kerman, during the year, Msny steps were taken a nd great interest shown by all the Hospitals in respect of the treatment of the poor. Two new Hospitals were opened in Kerman ana Raf- sinjan for them, and the Ustandar made many attempts to raise funds for their treatment. No epidemics were reported during the year, though there were a fair number of cases of whooping cough among children. Venereal desesees continued to be the most prevalent, but cures on anything but a small scale were hampered by the scarcity of essential drugs and the failure of the authorities in persuading patients to attend a full course of treatment. (fc) Municipality . Mr. Nazirzadeh held the post of Chief of the Kerman Municipality till the end of June, when he was appointed Aisist*nt to the Director General of Finance. In October, when the authorities in Tehran disapproved thia appointment and ordered his transfer from the Finance Department, he returned to his former poet in the Municipality. On November 2nd her received orders of transfer and went to Tehran, his place in the Municipality being taken by Mr, Arbabi, who held charge for the remainder of the year, 4 fter Arbabi’s assumption of charge, the affairs of the Municipality suffered a steady deterioration. In consideration of l^rge sums of money reported to h^ve been paid to him in bribes, the control on the sale of many essential commouities was lifted, with the result that Black Market prices soared upwards and were at a very hign level at the end of the ye-,r. ( l ) Gendarmerie Colonel Zawoah held the post of Officer Commanding, Gendarmerie, till the 15th June, when Colonel Lhadivi returned from Tehran to resume charge. Durin, the year, the Gendar merie retained their reputation of being notoriously corrupt and inefficient, ana were quite unequal to the task of dealing effectively with lawlessness. They made little attempt to improve the insecure state ef the roads in the Province, which was not surprising, in view of the reports that they have actually connived with the bandits and shared the proceeds of the robberies. In some instances robbers on the Kerman - B^ndsr Abbas road are said to have obtained receipts from their victims for the cash and valuables they had removed from them in order to safeguard themselves from excessive demands for 'rske-off' made by the local Gendarmerie. To add to the general disoruer, relations between the Military and Gendarmerie deteriorated rapidly. Vhile the Military accused the Gendarmerie of inactivity and connivance with the bandits, the Gendarmes accused the former of non cooperation ana saia thr^t they had neither the arms, transport nor reserves to deal with the situation with any effect. (m) Industry . Carpets. Due to a sharp rise in the prices of ayes and- 9 - wool, carpet* continued to be very expensive during the year. Local tr-*de wa* at a standstill and exports from Lerman to other contries were difficult owing to the restrictions imposed by the war and the unavailability of shipping space. fthile there were some merchants who made large profits at the beginning of the year, many had to give up weavin , completely and to dismantle their looms. The greater portion of the carpets completed during tne year were sent to Tehran, while america was the only country to which they were exported. Kura hid Mills . Due to the difficulty in obtaining an adequate amount of raw cotton, production was curtailed to some extent. In aduition to cotton yarn, cotton piecegooda were also produced and sold locally or sent to other towns. The dividend earned during the year is not yet known. (n) Transport . Captain Harper arrived in Kerman in February to take charge of the Transport Department. He was joined in April by Major Boyd. Towards the end of that month, they were both replaced by four members of the American Army, who were however recalled to Tehran four months later. From then until the end of the year, the Hoad Transport Department was under the charge of Captain J.W. Wilson. VI. MILITARY . General Officer Commanding . Sar-i-Laahkar Abdul Reza rtfkhami lie Id charge oi* the post of General Officer Commanding the 7th Division till the 16th September 1944. In an inter view which he had with H.M. Consul a few days prior to hi* departure, he stated that his transfer from Kerman was due chiefly to the intrigues said to have been instituted by the ex-Governor General, Ahmad Rad, and other interested merchants ugain^t the Ibrahimi family, of which he is a member. General ^fkhami was to a large extent responsible for the improvement in the general security in the Province at the beginning of the 2 nd half of the year and for the military measures against the bandit Muraa-Ali-Murad, which compelled the latter eventu ally to take refuge in flight from the Sirjan district where he had been increasingly troublesome. Sartip Ali Askar Sha •ri arrived in Kerman on the 17th de^tember as successor to General Afkhami and held charge of the post for the remainder of the year. He came with the firm determination of wiping out banditry and one of hia first moves was to hang five captured robbers publicly in their own villages. He made a number of tours to various areas in the Province, including Sirjan, Bandar Abbas and Persian Mekran. Though a few bad cases of hold-ups occurred during hia period of office, hia efforts had the effect of discouraging organised raids on villages by large gangs. Gtaff Officer . Lieutenant Colonel Alikai was Staff Officer to the (j. 6 .C. during the year. He made a number of tours in the district and directed operations against hoStile tribesmen. Chief Military Medical Officer . Colonel Owhadi held charge oiTl’ne post of Chief Military Medical Officer till August, when he received telegraphic orders of suspension from Tehran. At the end of the same month, however, he was reinstated in this post, which he continued to hold for the remainder of the year. SECURITY9 % •ugar /- 10 - VII. SECURITY . A general •tste of insecurity existed in the Province throughout the greater portion of the year. Reports of hold ups on the main roads were frequently received, »nd though the Indian Long Range Squadron ©persted periodically on the Zahi- \ dah -Kerman route, their presence did not discourage the 1 ®ctivities of the bandies as strongly ee-mlght have been ex- 1 pectbd. At the baginning of the year, the focal point was, as in the previous year, mainly in the Sirjan area, where Akb^r Khan Shujapur, the elder aon of Husain Khan Buchakchi, and Muraa-Ali-Murad, another member of the Buchakchi tribe, and hi» gang continued to abscond ana to raid travellers and villages with impunity. Husain Khan, who had by this time apparently made attempts to settle down peaceably, professed to be doing everything in his power to control Akbar Khan Shuj&amp;pur's actions and to bring him in, together with Murad- Ali-Murad. Sarly in the year, the military authorities issued an ultimatum to Shugapur to the effect that if he did not surrender within a given period, operation* against him would commence. The period of the ultimatum was later extended and finally expired, but Shujapur showed no signs of complying with the order, nor were the promised operations set in motion. In March, owever, Shujapur surrendered on his own accord handed in his arms nd was reported to have settled down to faraing with hi* father. i'arad-A1 i-Murad, however was still at large. In March, he wrote a letter to thi* Consulate asking for a guarantee of laanunity and future employment if he would come in ana surrender his arm*. He was advised to surrender, but told that no guarantee could be given him. In the meantime, he anu his gang became increasingly active and strong rumour* circulated to the effect that he invariably managed to evade capture by the payment of large *um» of money iiTbribe# to 0 -.iicers ot the Gendarmerie, whose connivance in brigandry became a public scandal. Sorties which were made against him by the military authorities often reaultad in amall engagement* in which the military usually suffered heavier casualties than the bandits• Towards the end of the year, however, a more serious view was apparently taken of thi* bandit's activities ana the military garrison at Sirjan was supplemented with more troops ana the attacks on the outlawa were thereafter carried out with more effect. Lurad-Ali- Murad was forced out of the district and eventually fled to tfsr* with a handful of his followers, the remainder of his gang being captured and brought to Kerman for trial. The following are the more serious incidents reported during the year :- * 1# .« * vill *£ er was attacked, wounded and robbed by bandits on the ezd road, 15 miles from that town on January 4th. A daring robbery took place at Baghin during the 2nd half of January, when robbers entered the house belonging to a member ot the Ibrahimi family and removed all the valuable* aiov ®* ble Property they could lay their hands on. One of the robbers was wounded in a clash which followed with *m.t Ild th6 r9malnder • )etti * 0Md their • uui ing the first half of March, thieves broke into a store room in the Consulate premises and made off with someof /- • ugar and tea. They were later tracked down by the local police (who diacovered that ~they had been led by a Consulate gardener) and a greet .ortion of the stolen property wes recovered. 4. Early in *pril, a number of hold-ups occurred on the Bandar Abbas road, near Hajiabad. The Gendarmes were unable to apprehenu the bandits and it was in this connection that the General Officer Commandin^ iniormed H»k. Consul that he had no confidence whatever in the Gendarmerie, and that he had proposed to Tehran that a body of the military should be sent to this area to maintain security. 5. During the first half of May, several hold-ups were reported. The most important of these was the attack on Colonel Azizi (the Brigadier at ^abul) ana his wife while on it] their way to Kerman from dahidan. Both received gunshot wounaa. Until this incident occurred, it was generally believed that, owin^, to the presence of the Indian Long Range ' iatrol, the Kerman-Sahidaxi road was reasonably safe for travelloraI 6 . Later in May, Mured-AliMurad, with a party of 20 armed biadits, attacked a detachment of troops two fbrsaks from Sirjan. Four soldiers were killed and a number of Government rifles captured by the bandits. Colonel Alikai, the Staff Officer to the General Officer Commanding, Imme diately left for the spot with a Cavalry Regiment, but Murad had apparently foreseen this move and had taken refuge in flight to Pars. 7. Onj^ June 3ra, an armed gang, believed to be of the Buchakchi tribe, attacked and robbed a caravan near Qaratul ~rab and another coming from Rabur on the Bardsir-Bam road. 8 . On June 14th, ,qai rjnanullah Khan Ameri, a leading landowner of Kerman, was fired on by an armed gang while on his way to Rayin. His chauffeur received severe wounds in the neck and shoulder anu was brought to Kerman for treatment. The robbers relieved -imanullah of four Government rifles which he had obtained on loan from the Military for issue to his private guards end decamp4d with his personal kit ana some cash. 9. On June 7th, *qai Ahmad Dilmaghani, a prominent land- owner anv* merchant of Karman, was held up by a party of four armed men while on his wsy to Ahmedabad from sarand. His driver and two companions were bound and placed in a well nearby anu Dilmaghani was taken a short distance from the car and deliberately murdered in cold bfcooa. This incident caused a wave of public indignation against the authorities responsible for maintaining security snd wild rumours were circulated in which the Zorastrian community, the rival Moslem party, the Ibrahimi family and even the British authorities were accused of having instigated killin- • A commission of three individual* arrived from Tehran to make investigaf tions into the case sna after a considerable period, arrested 11 persons suspected of complicity in the murder, whom they took to Tehran. These included Batwan Mir Hussaini, a Gendarmerie officer and Aqai Rustam Khan, a prominent member of the Ibrahimi family, who was however later released on bail. 1C.

IX. KCONOMIC . There were no serious shortages of essential commodi ties during the year, due, no doubt, to the efforts of the Consular Liaison Officer, who was able to build up sufficient reserves in Government ambars. By the end of February, only 150 tons of grain remained to be collected from 'tt’ahuds' taken in the previous year in spite of the numerous diffi* culties and escuses put forward by landlords before deliver ing outstanding amounts. Undertakings during 1944 were successfully obtained, though not unaccompanied by the usual intrigues on the part of the landlords to underestimate grain surplusses. By the end of November, when the British Officer assisting the Director General of Finance left Kerman, the position was a* follows s- W heat Burley Total Ta , ahuds taken 4448 tons 2303 tons 6751 tons Collections 3850 ' 2034 H 5884 ' The general situation was at that time considered to be quite satisfactory and difficulties if any were purely technical, e.g. storage etc. Issues of Government monopoly goods were made period ically under the coupon system. Sarly in the year, it was14 - @ 3 ^ realise /- eviaent 'that 'the a of t.he Kharbsr Oep^irtiiien.'t were inaking khie an opportunity of filling their own pock ets and the manner in which every possible obstacle was put in the way of tnoae who wished to buy cloth etc* *1 Government shops oecame an open scandal. The American director general of Finance, who arrived during the miadle of the year made strenuous efforts to effect a proper distribution and his efforts were to s large extent successful. Frequent ^iatrioutions of tea, sugar, cloth, cigarettes etc* tended to make things easier for the poorer classes. The abnor mally high prices in the open market cropped considerably during these distributions, but always returned to their high level immediately after them. The news of Allied successes in the European theattoe of the war and the con sequent feeling of nervousness which it produced on profit eers often made prices fluctuate wildly, but generally speaking, they remained at a level well beyond the reach of the middle and lower classes. A conservative estimate of the increase in the cost of living as compared with pre-war days was about 10 Q 0 %• X. POLITICAL . The satisfactory progress of the war during 1944 in favour of the Allied Armed Forces has in itself promoted ' Anglo-Persian relations considerably, both in the social and official spheres. Local officials have been most nnxious to co-operate with this Consulate and our relations with both officials and private families have been of the most cordial nature. In complete antithesis to the sus picion felt at the beginniag of the previous year, that the wheat collected with the help of the Consular Liaison Officer was eventually to find its way to the Allied Armies, the local people regained their confidence when they recognised that collections were being maae on their own behalf and when they founa that Government ambers ana the local market contained more stocks than ever before. Pro-German factions, as such, did not exist in Kerman. The landings and swift progress of the Allied Armies on the Western Front ana in Italy and the lightening advances of the Russians on the Eastern Front left no room for even remote hopes for an eventual Axis Victory in the European theatre, and by the end of the year, public opinion was of their ultimate designs on this country continued to gain ground during the year. These feelings were at their height towards the end of the year when the Russian demand for an oil concession in the North became known. The belief that they never had any intentions of leaving the country after tne suspension of hostilities became stronger than ever and the new aspect of an angry Russian wolf without I it*s sheeps ciothix^ gave rise to feelings of indignation end fear. roadcasts from Lonaon and Delhi were appre- hg the year# Ankara and Tehran broadcasts popular especially the letter which broad- The decline ia the popularity of the Berlin raaio continued as the local inhabitants had come to wholeheartedly in favour of the Allies.

Following this a lav. imposing sn 805 tax on business people was promulgated but no action was taken to enforce its regulations. St the close of the year the local head of the Education ^apartment announced compulsory education for menial Government employees in the ni;ht schools, but like most other measures ior reform nothing hs»s resulted from the announcement* V. MILITARY AKD Fo noticeable sfeanga activities have been reported in this area during the period under review except that raiding gangs, mostly from Kars, have been active in Terat, Marwas and on the main Yezd-Kerm^n Road necessitating the occasional movement of Gendarmerie forces to deal with them. The most important event of the year waa the re-orga*Aea- iion of the Gendarmerie force in this district and the establishment of two permanent ,, Guruhans M at Nain with a _ garrison of 150, each under the Officer Commanding.

His Highness then replied. Arrangements were made by Cable and .tireless Limited to broadcast the speeches through their .tireless station in Kuwait and reception was good and much appreciated. After the ceremony all those present and great numbers of the townsfolk attended an 'Ardha' or war dance in the town square. The'The Kon f ble the Political Resident’s address considered in conjunction with the obvious closeness and cordiality of his relations with the shaikh left no room for doubt, even in Arab minds, that Mis Majesty’s Government had conferred this most recent honour on Mis Highness in recognition of his loyalty during the last few critical years. The Hon’ble the Political Resident and Jiis Majesty's local representatives have also in recent years made it abundantly clear that they regard the shaikh of Kuwait as the sole source of authority within his State, thus correcting the j almost disastrous impression allowed to gain prevalence at I an unfortunate period of local history. The remarKable demonstrations of loyalty by the people of Kuwait to their Ruler on the occasion of this investiture established conclusively that this impression has been dissipated. The real friends of the ohaikh were genuinely pleased, end the waverers came over to him en masse finally convinced that they could safely give their allegiance to one who so clearly had the support of one of the leaders of the winning Allied side. The opposition party were confounded. (b) In the absence of shaikh F&amp;had As Salim As -ubah on holiday in Egypt, shaikh Abdullah Salim As jubah, C.I.S., has tasen a much closer interest in affairs of )tate; and, as Head of the Rationing Committee, has been running the rationing of foodstuffs and piece-goods. He has also been in charge of price control. A certain amount of progress has been made in preventing the diversion of quotas, but the wording of the Government of India’s established shippers’ procedure left many loopholes for trafficking in quotas in Bombay, and for diversion to Persian Ports of goods carried in sailing craft — opportunities that were exploited to the full by Indians and Arabs aliiie. (o) shaikh Abdullah Mubarak, C.I.E., has remained in charge of the Department of Public Security and has been most active and effective in recovering military property stolen in Iraq and Iran and in preventing its being disposed of in Kuwait, security in Kuwait itself and in the hinterland continues to be excellent. KhaiKh Abdullah Mubarak was awarded the C.I.E. in the Now Year’s honours in 1945. (d) Shaikh Abdullah Jabir As fubah retained his appointments as Chief Judge and Head of the Education Department. Unaer his guidance considerable pro ress has been made in the field of education. Shaikh Abdullah’s health has, however, not been good. He is reported to be suffering from pyorrhoea and autointoxication of the heart. He has also been experiencing trouble v/ith his eyes, and arrangements have been made for him to visit specialists in Bombay early in the New Year. (e) The post of President of the Municipality is still nominally vacant but the work is being done by the Executive Officer under the direct supervision of the Ruler. (f) Shaikh Abdullah Al Ahmed remained in charge of the Arsenal. (g) Chaikh Tehad As Salim spent most of the year in and, on his return in December, wes not permitted to resume charge of finance or Eood Supplies. (h) Shaixh fubah As Salim remained in charge of the Police. U)/3 (i) Shaikh Mubarak Al Hamed Al Mubarak As continued to hold charge of the Port* (j) Shaikh 53ubah An Nasir spent most of the year in the desert and has shown a tendency to arrogate to himself in desert affairs certain of the powers and prerogatives of the Ruler. (k) DEATHS . The following members of the As Subah died during the year: Shaikh Subah bin Mohammed As Subah, a second cousin of His Highness at Zubair on the 5th July; Shaikh Abdullah Al All Al Athbi As Subah on the 12th July; and Shaikh Ali bin Salman Al Hamood As Subah on the 11th December. HI- THE POLITICAL AGENT * S RELATIONS ;/ITH Tin: -UTATKIT . The Political Agent’s relations with the Shaikh have remained most cordial. His Highness — ably assisted by shaikh Abdullah Mubarak, C.I.E. — continues to assist our fighting services in every way possible and has been of considerable help to the Royal Air Eorce and the Inland Water Transport Detachment here. And, while His Highness has insisted on complete control of such essential commodities as cereals which are entirely handled by the State, the influence and interests of the merchant community have, on occasions been allowed to teraper, perhaps unduly, the enforcement of certain necessary economic controls. IV. LOCAL interests . (a) POLITICAL . The most important internal political event during the year was the proclamation by the Shaikh on the 24th April of an amnesty for the political prisoners who led the agitation against him in 1939 and have been in prison ever since. This was followed by an order allowing those who fled to Iraq during the disturbance to return to Kuwait, with the exception however of three men, Abdullah Al Hamad As Saqir, Rashid Abdul Ghafoor, and Mohammed Al Barak. Amongst the supporters of the Shaikh there was criticism of his action at first, which gradually crystallised into a recognition of its sagacity In demonstrating that he alone without outside interference, is master in his State and holds, in this case, the power of imprisonment and release as a matter of grace. This was only made possible by the fact that the political authorities had resisted all suggestions that they should interfere in the matter and had made no secret of the fact that it was regarded as a question for the Shaikh alone. His opponents, fortunately without any result of importance, did all in their power to defeat this attitude by falsely representing the release of the prisoners as being done under the orders of the British Government in whose hands they contemptuosly referred to the Shaikh as a tool. Another welcome aspect of the matter is that the prisoners were a focal point for disaffection which has now been removed. (b) TRADE. A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confiden- tial publication. (c) CUSTOMS . The Customs duty remained at ad valorem. During the month of Ramdhan an order was passed by His Highness that the import of sheep, goats, and cattle should be ex'- from4 ~ - ~ ~v^^ujr , anu unc jjrxue or mUULC so that the poor could afford to buy it. (d) MEDICAL . (i) Activity in the Agency Charitable Dispensary vms resumed on the arrival of Assistant Surgeon C.E.Hynes, and an average of 200 new cases and 350 recurring cases a month have 'been treated. (ii) The Kuwait Government medical establishment has been increased by the appointment of a doctor in charge of the schools. At the beginning of the year their work was to some extent handicapped by shortage of medical supplies — largely due to lack of foresight —- but adequate orders have since been placed in England. &lt; u Gerald Nykerk and Dr.Miss Ruth 0. Crouse, in charge oi the men’s and women’s hospitals at the American Mission, have continued to fill a very real need An llves of tlle People of Kuwait. No less than 47,978 cases were treated in the Out-Patient Dispensary during the year and 312 major operations and a similar number of minor operations were carried out in the men’s hospital alone. The retirement of Dr.Miss Crouse early next year and the impossibility of replacing her until after the war will unfortunately lead to a temporary curtailment, although not a cessation, of the Mission’s activities in the treatment of women. The Mission also consider their present facilities for the treatment of male patients as quite inadequate, and plans are well v advanced for rebuilding the men’s hospital as soon as materials are available. (e) (D POST AND TELEGRAPHS . _ r J e ■ ?ostal administration continued to run the Post Office throughout the year. The land teJLegraph line to Basrah was put in order and opened to traiiic on the 1st March, and the public have made considerable use of the facilities offered. (2) Messrs. Cable and Wireless have continued to operate their wireless telegraph station efficiently, and are also responsible for the excellent internal telephone (f) EDUCATION . i t3le post of Director of Education upto the 16th November when he was relieved by Sadiq Hamdi a new Director engaged in Egypt. The scope of the Education Department’s activities has increased considerably and Shaikh Abdullah labir, Head of the Department, and the new Director are now in charge of 12 oys schools with 1315 pupils and 2 girls’ schools with 285 pupils. They are assisted by 64 male teachers, of whom 12 are Egyptians, and 15 female teachers including 11 foreigners. In addition, 21 boys from Kuwait are°studyinr in colleges or secondary schools in Egypt and Syria. ^akelin of British Council continued to advise Shaikh Abdullah Jabir and his committee throughout the ^ear, and to assist them in numerous ways — particularly in matters of staff and equipment. (g) THE PILCxRIMAUE - Owing to the Saudi Arabian Government’s refusal — at the instance of the Minister Resident as a measure of ... . &lt; • economy/5 economy — to permit Persian Pilgrims not in possession of valid national passports to enter Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage, and to the Persian Government's refusal, also at the instance of the Minister Resident, to visa their nationals' passports for that purpose, the pilgrimage this year was the smallest in living memory. All the Persians who came to Kuwait for the pilgrimage returned without making it. No Iraqis made the pilgrimage from Kuwait, and only 375 Kuwaitis did so — 340 of them on camels. (h) PEARLING . The high cost of fitting out the ships and the difficulty in obtaining ships' gear of all Kinds prevented all but a fraction of the prewar pearling fleet from putting to sea. The diving was further hampered by rough weather and the break for Ramdhan. The catch was little over half of last year’s and prices were from 10% to 15% higher than in 1943. (i) SHIP-BUILDING . The Kuwait ship-building and ship-repairing industries were badly dislocated this summer by the failure to secure adequate stocks of timber from India and many dhows were laid up for lack of wood to repair them. The shipwrights, however, who normally do this work were all kept fully employed assembling barges for the Army at Bandar Shuwaikh. (j) SHORTAGE OF DRINKING WATER . The water-ships of the Water Supply Company had been allowed to fall into disrepair to such an extent that by the summer only 28 remained to fulfil the needs of Che entire town. The result was an acute shortage of water when winds were light and craft were becalmed; and, had the Kuwait Oil Company not come to the rescue by running water barges from Abadan, the situation would have been critical indeed. To prevent a recurrance of the crisis Che Water Supply Company plan to build ten new ships next spring, and a special application has been made to the Government of India for the release of materials. V. DESERT INTERESTS. Arrivals of considerable quantities of second hand overcoats from the U.S.A. together with the institution of control over the prices and distribution of piece-goods and the extension of the food rationing system have somewhat aleviated the lot of the bedouin; but they are still the chief sufferers from the lack of rice. Unlike the townsmen, they do not know how to make bread from the wheat, wheat flour, and barley issued to them as cereal rations; nor can they afford grinding stones or. the necessary cooking utensils. Instead, they use the cereals to make a coarse porridge which gives rise to serious digestive ailments, especially in children. The plentiful grazing resulting from the excellent rains early in the winter, however, has much improved the condition of their flocks and they now have more milk and meat to sell in the town than for many months past. VI./6 VI. FOREIGN INTKHSSTS. (a) SAUDI AR/iBIA . Relations with, the Saudi Kingdom, have remained friendly throughout the year and the Shaikh has continued to help Ibn Saud to ship quotas of essential commodities for Nejd through Kuwait. (b) IRAQ . The attitude of the Shaikh to Iraq has undergone no change. The smuggling of goods from Kuwait to Iraq^ however, has been on a much reduced scale because of the control over quotas exercised in Kuwait. On the other hand Iraqi rice has been smuggled into Kuwait in small but regular quantities throughout the winter months. At the instance of His Majesty 1 s Government the Shaikh was persuaded to co-operate with the Iraq Government in the matter of vehicles smuggled from Iraq for the pilgrimage, and the racket was completely checked. The Iraq Government, however, has given the shaikh a fresh cause for complaint by refusing transit facilities for goods consigned to Kuwait through the Port of Basrah. As a result, many cargoes consigned to Kuwait as part of the controlled importing programme have been held up in Basrah. VII. DATE GARDENS . * The situation was as follows at the end of the year (a) BaSHIYAH . The appeal lodged in Baghdad by the Shaikh’s lawyer failed and the case has not been pursued in the Court of Cassation. The areas lost to the Shaikh have been ascertained; but, upto the close of the year, a satisfactory estimate of their value had not been obtained. (b) EADHAGHIYAH . There have been no developments during the year. (c) FAO. Th.’. ^ com The gardens at Fao have been registered by the Land Settlement Board of Basrah in the name of the f, Heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah A1 Awal n , the great grandfather of the present Ruler. Certain appeals have been lodged in Court of Appeal in Baghdad against this decision, and at the end of the year summons were outstanding against the Heirs because, upto that time, no list of the heirs who could empower a lawyer to accept service of the summons had been prepared. Prior to reference of the case to the Land bettlement Board the Mutassarif' of Basrah, in his executive capacity, supervised the distribution of the produce of the Fao gardens between owners and cultivators. He has since received orders, however, not to interfere in the case as long as it is sub judice; and the Shaikh can now only secure the owner’s share of the produce by recourse to the courts. This he was unable to do because the court refused to accept the pleadings of a lawyer empowered to act on behalf of the Shaikh and held that, for his pleadings to be heard, the lawyer should hold a power of attorney from the heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah. Upto/7 Upto the end of the year, the Shaiich had not made up his mind to prepare a division of the property between the heirs, on which such a power of attorney could be based. VIII. GOST OF LIVING. The cost of living continued to be very high throughout the year and was* aggravated by the increased cost of drinking -water, of servants, and of labour of all kinds. These increases were, however, to some extend mitigated by improvements in the rationed distribution of foodstuffs and piece-goods, and by the extension of price control to certain commodities not previously controlled. The following is a comparative statement of prices in 1943 and 1944;- P-rtCM 1_9_4J3. i-AAA » Wheat(controlled)..

The Inland Water Transport Detachment continued to assemble barges until November when they had completed their initial project. They assembled a total of 98 barges. They have materials for a further 30 barges landed here but it has been decided that they are not now required in this theatre of operations and preparations are being made to ship them away and to transfer the Detachment. X. ROYAL NAVY . The only ships of the Royal Navy to visit Kuwait were H.M.S. Fiery Gross and H.M.3. Seabelle. H.M.3. Fiery Cros called on the 7th October to bring Commodore J.N. Howson, R.N., to bid farewell to the Shaikh on his relief by Commodore I.W. Whitehorn, R.N. (Retired), who visited Kuwait in H.M.S. Seabelle on the 14th November. XI. ROYAL AIR FORCE. Numerous visits were paid to Kuwait by aircraft of the R.A.F. and many hundreds flew over head. The R.A.F* maintained a signals detachment in Kuwait throughout the year, and also a detachment in charge of an aerial navigation beacon situated at Bandar Shuwaikh. They also gave a demonstration in Kuwait of the 'Warah' Spitfire, purchased out of Kuwait’s contributions to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. • XII. KUWAIT OIL COMPANY. The Kuwait Oil Company continued to operate on a ’closed down’ basis throughout the year, and their engineering staff rendered invaluable services in the maintenance of mechanical equipment of all kinds in Kuwait. In addition, they did a great deal to mitigate the water shortage in the summer/y 8 summer by running water barges from Abadan, and have repaired and are in the process of extending, the bitumen road running irom the Dasman Balace towards the main square of the town, ihey have also icept in operation the three desert water wells fitted with windmill pumps which they presented to the ShaiKh in 1942 and 1943. Since August they have been making an extensive meteorological survey, and latterly marine and coastal surveys to collect data on which to base plans for future development * and a combined British and American Technical Mission has visited Kuwait to examine the problems involved. In November Mr. C.M. Roseburgh, Chief Pipe-Line Engineer of the Gulf Oil Corporation of America, also paid a two day visit to the Kuwait Oil Company. XIII. EASTERN GULF OIL COMPANY. In August some drilling equipment and a staff of seven American technicians arrived to start exploratory drilling for sulphur, as required by the Eastern Gulf oil Company’s concession. By the end of the year they had drilled ohree wells and started a fourth in the vicinity of the Kuwait Oi company’s No.l oil well. The results, however, were most disappointing. XIV. IMPERIAL BaNK OF IRAN. ^ ne Imperial Bank of Iran has continued to do business on a fairly substantial scale. It appears to be popular amongst the mercantile community who continue to avail themselves ol uhe facilities it offers. The number of the Same’s customers, already large, has increased to some extent: • U \^ 0V/ar ? s Cile 6n(i t '^ e Y ear there was evidence of a decline in the volume of its operations due, in large measure, to the Increased restrictions and controls on the import and re-export of goods. / The Bank still occupies the same' premises, but it is Intended, on the return of more normal conditions, to request the bhaikh to build a new office which will be leased from him ty the Bank, a course to which His Highness has agreed. Mr.3.3. Matheson, who was awarded the O.B.E. in the New Year’s honours, held charge of the bank until the 2nd October when he was relieved by Mr.R.W. Haig, who held charge until the close of the year. s XV. VISITORS. . . considerable number of service personnel continued to visit Kuwait throughout the year. The Royal Air Force maintained a rest house for this purpose in the first half of one yesr, but later discontinued it as the rent was found to be too high. It is now intended that they should take over the house occupied by the Inland Water Transport Detachment f S ?u res E Camp when the Army va o at e it. It has been offered to them free of rent by the Shaikh. XVI. METEOROLOGIOAL .

X (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad bin f Isa Al Khallfah, K.C.I. %, interested himself closely in the government of his country generally, and particularly in the maintenance of adequate food supplies for his people. During the period under review a rapproachment was effected between His Highness and shaikh Abdullah bin i^asim Al Than!, C.I.S.* the Ruler of the neighbouring territory of Qatar. Difficulties had arisen as far back as 1936 with regard to the ruined settlement of Zubarah on the west coast of the Qatar peninsula which resulted in en^ry into Bahrain being denied to all subjects of the shaikh of Qatar except for those who were in urgent need of medical attendance. On the 17th of June 1944 an agreement was signed by the two shaikhs to the effect that formal relations would be resumed on the same lines as they had been in the past. The immediate result of the signature of this agreement was the lifting of the ban against the subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar by His Highness and the arrival in Bahrain for medical treatment of Shaikh Hamad bin Abctullah /Ai Than!/'-N - 3 - Al Than! the heir-presumptive to the shaikhdom of ^atar who was suffering from a serious infection of the face which kept him here,somewhat to the embarrassment of His Highness, for approximately five months. The agreement between the two shaikhdoms made it possible for several thousand unskilled labourers who were badly needed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Royal Air Force to come to these Islands and obtain employment. It was hoped that the vague terms of the 9 agreement would preclude the raising of specific questions with regard to the oraership and dimensions of the Zubara area but His Highness indulged in long discussions on the subject, in purticul-r with regard to certain armed guards in a fort within the area, with the political Agent and towards the end of the year s in not altogether profitable correspondence with the Shaikh of qatar on the same subject, (b) Shaikh itoham jd bin ‘Isa Al Khalifah paid his usual annual visit to Egypt and took his usual place in social events in that country. Shaikh Abdullah bin •Isa, C#I*3.f hia younger brother andjunior uncle of the Ruler was present throughout the year with the exception of a period of five weeks in the early winter during which he went to Saudi Arabia on a hawking expedition. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed a nephew of His Highness remained Superintendant of police throughout the year while Shaikhs Mubarak bin Hamad and Dhaij bin Hamad, brothers of His Highness, continued to hold their appointments, the one as a judge of the Bahrain junior Joint Court and the other as,a judge of the Bahrain Senior Court. Shaikh Ali bin Hamad one of His Highness* cousins held the &gt;ppaintmer_. of a judge of the Bahrain Senior Court, and arrangements were made for Shaikh Salman bin Mohamed a brother of the aforementioned Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed to undergo a course of legal instruction in Palestine early in 1945. His Highnsss* brother Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad was president of the Merchants Court and also of the Muharraq Baladiyah. A- 4 • a: ■■ V 4. B^HHALN POLICE Police Ifaturs Strength on 31-12*1943 31-12-1944 • • • • • • • • • • * • 371 182 328 173 No serious crimes were committed during the year. Sixty seven cases of smuggling of tea, sugar, cigarettes, and or piecegoods were detected and the number of petty thefts increased. There were two cases of very up-to-date crime when two motor vehicles were stolen and stripped of their tyres and tubes. The vehicles were recovered and in one case the tyres also and the criminals were produced in court. s* mmam There h^s been a steady increase in the area of land under cultivation in those parts of Bahrain where water is available. The area of the Government experimental garden at Budaiya was increased towards the end of the year and the Bahrain Government Agriculturist was available to advise garden owners and cultivators on agricultural matters. 6 . The municipal ^ork of both the municipalities was restricted to ordinary routine duties owing to lack of building materials. The municipalities, as in previous years took an active part in assisting the Food Controller in the rationing and distribution of foodstuffs. ?. mhi c om Owing to the impossibility of obtaining cement and other building materials no fresh construction work could be undertaken and it was only with the greatest difficulty that urgent repairs were carried out. 3. ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT (a) General The new transmiuting station of the Royal Navy was con nected during the year (connected load of approximately 35 K:tv ) /and5 /~\ and the Royal Air Force added approximately 232 Kw making their total connected load 246*5 KVf at the end of the year. The charges for lighting and power were not increased during the year in spite of war conditions resulting in an increase in the running and maintenance costs. Connected load on 31st December 1943 Connected load on 31st December 1944 Maximum recorded load in 1943 Maximum recorded load in 1944 Total units generated in 1943 Total units generated in 1944 770 KW • 1092.5 KW 198 KW 308 KW 7,37,472 11,44,115 Wiring of houses by local contractors was continued and a further 293 points were added during the year under review. In the latter part of the year bad weather conditions resulting in rain and high winds were in part responsible for no fewer than 166 power distribution failures. It must be recorded that these failures were very largely due to the condition of the external circuits which are in urgent need of overhaul, replacement^, and repair. The condition of the power house plant is far from satisfactory for the engines are obsolete and in urgent need of replacement. The present system of small generating sets is uneconomical and the power house is so under-powered that even when the new 200 KW gene rator arrives from the United Kingdom, as it is expected to do in the next two or three months, there will not be a sufficient reserve of power to allow for essential, overhaul of machinery. The Bahrain Government will soon be faced with demands for additional electrical power for air conditioning and lighting and they are being urged by the Agency to embark on a sound long term reorganization plan designed to provide adequate generating power with reasonable reserves not only for their present demands but for future expansion. (b) Telephone Department * The present telephone system is most unsatisfactory and the subject of general complaint. This is partly due to lack of foresight on the part of the electrical department in failing to make provision for adequate replacexaents and repair /and /- 6 - &amp; and partly to inefficient operation. Enquiries are now being made from Messrs. Cafcle and tireless Limited with regard to the possibility of their being able to instal and operate an automatic system. Similar enquiries made from the Director of posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan, resulted in an indication that it was unlikely that equipment could be made available from India* 9. PEARLING INDUSTRY The season was not a successful one. This was due in part to the month of Ramadhan, during which there is no diving, occurring in the middle of the season and in part to the small number of boats taking part. This in itself was due to the great demand for unskilled labour at attractive rates caused by the extensive building operations of the Bahrain petroleum Compoy and the Royal Air Force. Curiously enough there was a considerable rise in the price of the lower grades of pearls in the Indian market due to extensive buying in India and at the same time there was no corresponding rise in the price of good quality gooas for the reason that the American and European markets are still closed, and large quantities of high quality pearls are being held in Bombay against an expected rise in prices on the cessa.tlon of 10 . 11. hostilities in Europe. CUSTOM Imports during the year 1944 showed an increase over 1943 which combined with a general rise in the cost of goods resulted in a customs revenue of l?s. 21,06,806, being the largest sum which has ever been received in the form of customs duties. FOOD CONTROL The Food Control Department under the supervision of the Director of Customs succeeded very efficiently in overcoming the problems of the provision and the distribution of food for the people. 3 ome idea of the magnitude of the 'undertaking /can-7 can be obtained when it is realized that no less than Es«80|00 f 000 were spent by the Government on the purchase of such essential foodstuffs as wheat, barley, flour, rice, sugar, and dates. In addition to this sum a further outlay was incurred by the Bahrain Government in the purchased cotton of one-third of certain standard types of Indiaivpiecegoods for sale at a price five per cent above cost to the poorer members of the general public. The greater part of the expenditure incurred by the Bahrain Government was of course recovered from sales to the public. The cereal ration was maintained at twenty pounds a head a month throughout the year but there were variations in the constituents from time to time to accord with the variations in the supply of the dif ferent xinds&gt; of grain by the Middle r.ast Supply Council. Rice disappeared almost entirely from the menu whereas prior to 1942 the population of these Islands were almost exclusively rice eaters. in Owing to the failure of the winter rainr^the season 1943—44 in South Persia the quality of the meat obtained from that country was of the lowest,and even then the quantity was much less than the local demand with ^he result that there occurred meat shortages in the late summer and early winter of this year. Early in the year difficulties with the local butchers who consistently refused to sell meat at controlled prices resulted in the Bahrain Government themselves purchasing a 1 imports and selling direct to the public through salaried butchers in the meat market. In the last quarter of the year the falling off in the quantity of imports necessitated a system of slaughtering only on four days in the week being introduced. possibly not unlike many other countries excellent price control and anti-hoarding regulations issued both by this Agency and by the Bahrain Government to prevent profiteering were to a large extent nullified by the apathy of the general public tod a marked disinclination on their* part to inform- 8 - against local dealers. An Interesting table of comparison between prewar and present rates showing the percentage increase is attached to this report as Appendix 'A'. 12 . ssisma The following is a comparative statement of ships 13. using the anchorages!• 1942 1943 1944 British •• 134 109 171 American • • • • 24 51 188 Dutch .« .. 1 10 24 Norwegian •. • • 2 21 10 0 uhers .. .. - 9 12 The total imports during the year amounted to 1,96,681 tons while the exports, exclusive of oil shipments, amounted to 14,423 tons. Since the beginning of the year sixteen steel barges, four wooden barges, and three deep sea tugs were brought into commission by shipping agents. The United Kingdom Commercial corporation, for whom Messrs. Qray Mackenzie &amp; Company act as agents, imported the following commodities during 1944i— Sugar Barley Wheat Flour Rice 448 tons 2,149 ' 14,039 « 4,636 ' 393 ' Ass mm mm the mi mm Two accidents occurred within the port limits during 1944. The first of these was the destruction by fire on the 11th of September ©f a launch belonging to Messrs. Cray Mackenzie &lt;5: Company Limited which was lying alongside the Royal Air Force pier on the Muiharraq causeway. The secodd accident, in some ways more serious, for the commodity was in extremely short supply in the Islands, wi|S when a dhow belonging to Ali bin Mohamed Omar Bazara of Aden ran aground north of Manama anchorage on the 26th of December and was severely damaged, the whole of her cargo of cement being a total loss. v /14.&amp; 6 / 9 (i) Victoria Memorial Hospital Lieutenant M#L»A* Steele 9 I*M*D * 9 held charge throughout the year with the exception of a period during the summer when Lieutenant Shyaa Sunder of the Indian Medical Corps acted as locuis tenens* There were no epidemics during 1944 and it is interesting to note that there has been a steady decrease in the number of endemic smallpox cases since 1941. This is probably due to the very careful quarantining and vaccinating which have been carried out during the past three years. Malaria - There was a decrease in the number of malarial cases treated from 3,452 in 1943 to 3,279 in 1944. Most of these cases are considered to have been relapses from old infections in persons who had not carried out a full course ol treatment. The same applied to the venereal disease cases treated in this hospital and about which the medical officer reported the difficulty of persuading patients to complete a full period of treatment. (ii) American Mission Hospital Dr. Paul W. Harrison was in charge, assisted by Dr.i .H. Storm, Dr. J. Chandy, Dr. Mrs. J.H. Ames, and towards the end of 1944 by Dr. C.H.G. Mylrea, O.B. J. Dr. J. Chandy left in uhe early summer for a post-graduate course in the United States towards the cost of xvhich a very generous sum of money had been contributed by grateful patients. 1,122 major operations were carried out and 1,700 minor operations ms compared with a total of major and minor operations amounting to 4,300 in 1943. 1942 1943 1944 Out-patients treated In-patients treated Operations (minor) 15,759 20,029 19,602 11 36 14 525 416 635 1942 1943 1944 Out-patients treated 45,000 10,610 14,124 In-patients treated 1,165 2,030 2,879 /The/15 &amp; £% 10 The Mission Hospital dealt with more cases of venereal disease during 1944 than in previous years. This is apparentlj due partly to an increase in the incidence of the disease and partly to an increase in the desire of those afflicted for treatment. It is hoped that before long the very promising treatment by Penicillin will be available and within the financial limits of every^member of the general public. (ill) State Medical Hospital Dr. R.H*B. snow held charge throughout the year assisted Miss by Dr-/ I.M.A. Doeg in the womens section of the hospital. 253 major operations and 1,908 minor operations were carried out as compared with a total for operations of 2,516 in 1943. The Service ' ards continued to be administered, by the Royal Air Force medical officers and ulsters were in charge of the actual medical teatment and nursing of the patients. Of the 410 European patients who were admitted only two failed to recover. Service out-patients are now dealt with by the 74 major operations and 433 minor operations were carried out as compared with a total for operations of 524 in 1943.

Defence Savings Certificates to the value of Rs. 31,110-0-0 and Five Year Cash Certificates to the value of Rs.74,672-3-0 were sold during the year under review. 16. ADMINISTRAT ION OF JUSTICE (i) Agency Courts The total number of civil suits and criminal cases decided during the year was 1,033 and 304 respectively as compared with 1,341 and 336 in the previous year. (ii) Bahrain Government There was no change in the personnel of the magistrates of the Bahrain courts during the year 1944. 17 . m mm (i) Boys 1 Section There has been very little increase in the number of pupils in the Boys 1 Section for classes were already full to capacity at the end of 1943. An innovation during the year was the sending of nine students for further education to Egypt and the engagement of thirteen trained Egyptian teachers. The work of the schools has been carried on in the face of almost incredible difficulties for it has been impossible to obtain paper or chalk from India and the United Kingdom with the result that black boards can.only be used on the12 - rarest of occasions and writing work had to be reduced to 07 ) a minimum. * (ii) Technical school There has been a considerable falling off in the number of students in the Technical School due to the abnormal demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers however immature their ^raining. The teaching staff have had to contend with con siderable difficulties oving to a shortage of materials and instruments. The future of the Technical School was discussed with the Bahrain Government during 1944 and it is possible that the Bahrain petroleum Company may be inclined to take over the institution with suitable reservations to the Bahrain Government in the way of a quota of scholarships for boys nominated by the Bahrain Government. Nothing definite could be settled as the Bahrain Petroleum Company are at present very pre-occupied with kh the abnormal war programme they have been called upon to handle. It is probable that in 1945 they will be able to put into exe cution a number of sound schemes for the benefit of the general population which they have been considering in theory during the past year and it is hoped that one of their first actions will be to come to an agreement with the Bahrain Government regarding the Technical school. (iii) Girls 1 Schools The Girls' Section luid much the same difficulties to contend with as the Boys' Section. There have however been very large increases in the number of students in the Girls' Schools. This is due to the higher standard of education brought about by the recruitment from overseas of skilled mistresses, and the realisation by the general public that an educated girl has much greater chances of making a satisfactory marriage.

BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED (a) General Management /'N Mr. Ward P. Anderson was the General Manager and Chief Local Representative of the company throughout the year except for a brief period in the latter half of the year when he paid a flying visit to the United States of Ameiica and ?&lt;4r. H.B. Nichols, an Assistant Vice President of the Company, acted as the Chief Local Representative and General Manager. It has been the recent policy of the Company to ensure that a member of the directorate is present in Bahrain to obviate the necessity as far as possible of conti nual references to New York for decisions outside the powers of the General Manager. Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton the Chairman of the Company remained in Bahrain until 1st of June while Mr. H.B. Nichols was present from 21st June to the middle of November, it being understood that he would be replaced before the end of the year by Mr. Don J. Hanna one of the Vice Presidents of the Company. (b) Production and Development The total oil production during 1944 was 6,713,795 net barrels, an average of 18 f 344 net barrels daily. During the period January to October the rate of field production was held at a dally average of 18,000 net barrels but as a result of the rapid progress of the rehabilitation programme field production was increased to 20,000 net barrels a day from the 1 st of November and held at that rate until the end of the.year. During the year a very large construction programme was undertaken to provide facilities for the production of aviation spirit and to increase the quantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war. Certain phases of this programme had been completed by the end of the year and the construction of the remaining items was proceeding rapidly with every indication that the works would be completed early in 1945. /(C)- 14 - (c) Producing Field Activities in the field during the year were almost entirely devoted to the rehabilitation of wells which had been closed down in 1942 in accordance with the Oil Derihl Scheme. rhe progress of this work was more rapid than was expected with the result that the field was returned to a state approaching its former degree of flexibility earlier than had b en anticipated. By the end of the year only eight of the original fortyone wells included in the Denial Scheme remained co be rehabilitated. No work of a development nature was undertaken and only minor repair works were carried out to producing wells. (3) Import of Arabian American Crude Oil The total imports of Arabian American crude oil amounted to 7,137,773 net barrels and this was handle 1 through the Zellaq marine terminal. in 1942 the Zellaq equipment had been augmented to permit of the handling of crude at a maximum rate of 40,000 barrels per operating day and although up till this year this high level was never attained it was found necessary in order to deal with increased crude requirements necessitated by the new construction programme to overhaul the existing equipment and augment the handling capacity to 45,000 barrels per operating day. As a part of the Refinery Expansion programme a twelve inch crude oil line running from the neighbourhood of Zellaq to the Refinery has been completed. The work of laying a twelve inch submarine line from the Arabian American Oil Company^ premises has been undertaken and it is hoped that the Bahrain Island section will be linked to the submarine line e^rly in 19*^ ; and that it will then be possible to pump Arabian American crude direct from the producing area to the Bahrain Petroleum Company*s Refinery. (e) Refinery Drying the year under review a total of 13,725,236 barrels of crude were processed in the Refinery. Shipments of thevarious products were divided Petrol • Paraffin •• .* Diesel oil • .. Fuel oil 7 •• • • Total A detailed sumnary of the construction programme which has been in progress will be given later in this report* The new equipment is directed towards the production of aviation petrol to the extent of about 6,000 barrels a day together with increased quantities of other products. (f) Causeway The new causeway which is under construction is expected to reach a point 13,000 feet off shore where a pierhead will be built to handle four barges simultaneously in eight feet depth of water at mean low tide* The causeway will support a thirty feet wide truck road. ( 8 ) C^mp Facilities Very considerable additions to the existing accommodation both at Awali and at Raffa had to be made to house the large construction force which was imported to deal with the Refinery construction programme* A number of buildings such as for instance a fiftytwo room air conditioned bunk house, and nine twentyfour room air conditioned bunk houses will probably be put to use to Increase the social amenities of the permanent staff as soon as the construction programme has been completed* The fiftytwo room bunk house* is expected to be transformed into the basic unit of a new hospital for the Asiatic employees of the company as soon as materials can be obtained.

Extensive alter ations were made which included the completion of * new twelve inch Rviution petrol loading line, extensions to pump houses &lt;*nd control rooms, additional tankage for 1 , 35,000 barrels and the setting up of numerous pumps and control instruments to bring the terminal into line with the Refinery expansion. (iv) Salt Water System In order to conserve the supply of fresh water the Company introduced a salt water system for the cooling of Refinery units# A terminal was built to house pumps with a nominal capacity of 75,000 g.p.m# two thousand feet out from the high water mark and a flume was constructed to bring the sea water from that point to the shore from where it could flow by means of an open canal to the Refinery# A further pumping plant was installed at the end of the aforementioned canal to distri bute at r throughout the Refinery area and an exhaust canal / was-17- was constructed to run parallel to the inlet through which the vrater is discharged, after passing the oil separator system, into the sea* (v) Drum plant A drum manufacturing and filling plant has been con structed with a theoretical maximum capacity of 70,000 drums a month* This plant is intended to provide drums for the shipment of aviation spirit at a rase of approximately 40,000 barrels a month. (vi) Miscellaneous Of the large number of new units which have been com pleted or were in the process of construction in the Refinery and other areas the most interesting is a new two-stage fluid catalytic cracking unit which is being built for producing the aromatic base stock necessary for the production of hundred octane aviation spirit* This unit which is the only one of its size and kind ou&amp;side the United States of America will have a nominal capacity of approximacely 3,500 barrels a day of finished aromatic blending stock. mim OF BRITISH AND FOREIGN NOTABLES The exigencies of the Services and the war conditions prevailing brought many distinguished civil and military personages of many different nationalities to Bahrain during the year 1944. mils OF ARAB NOTABLES (i) On the 2nd November His Highness tho Amir Saud bin Abdur ' Rahman as Saud a youn;er brother of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud came to Bahrain for medical treatment at the American Mission Hospital. He w^s present for a period of 25 days during which time he was successfully treated by Dr* Paul V/. Harrison* (ii) On the 5th May Shaikh Abdullah bin sulaiman the Finance Minister to the Saudi Arabian Government accompanied by Shaikh Yousuf Yassin was forced by stress of weather to spend three21 . -TKv Cumw^ ^TTSfiL*. days in Bahrain enrouce from Jcdda to His Majesty King Abdul Aftls's camp near Riyadh* (ill) dh&amp;lkh Hazza bin dultan a younger brother of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi visited Bahrain from the 29th April to the 5 t h of ^june. (iv) Shaikh Jum^ bin liaktum a younger brother of the Shaikh of Dubai accompanied by numerous relatives paid a short visit to Bahrain in the month of May* (v) Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thaniof Qatar paid two visits to Bahrain approximating a total period of stay of five months during which he underwent prolonged treatment for a septic condition of the Jaw* usak iwm (i) The Merchants Advisory Committee which was Introduced in 1943 has functioned throughout the year with very con siderable success* (ii) In order to attempt to control rapidly rising rents a Re nt Control Order was promulgated in eonsultavion with the Bahrain Government early in the year which provided for by the fixation of the percentage amount^which rents could be increased, and contained regulations governing the circum stances in which landlords could insist on the vacation of premises by tenants* (iii) No record of the events of the year would be complete without some reference to the climate. The summer was one of the mildest that has ever been known and was followed by a winter strongly reminiscent of the English climate, cold *lnds and drizzle interspaced with brief periods of sunshine 22* mxmis, (i) Banking and Currency The most important event in financial and business circles during the year was the opening of a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran on the 16th of December* This branch had not been open for a sufficient length of time to have any very definite effect by the end of the year on the money /marketmarket but che imiuadiate reaction to the introduction of a second banking house , as the improvement, from the customers 1 point of view, in rates, and an unusual keenness to do business on the part of the eastern Bank Limited. (ii) Eastern Limicod The business of the Eastern Bank .consisted chiefly of financing the requirament 3 of the oil companies operating in the area aim whe vice units staticnod at 'ifuliarra j and r nama. For this and otlmr general banking purposes they imported Bs. 1,63,30,000 in notes and silver and &lt;r olc on India B3.20,?6,745 and to loc^l merchants Indian funds amounting to Bs.68,25,000. It is interesting to note that of the fifty documentary credits h^ndlod by this bank covering the shipments of goods to bahraiii twenty of them amounting to £.15,000 covered goods from the United Kingdom, twelve of them amounting to 4*36,000 covered goods from the United States of America, while site oi ther. amounting to ^s.SBjOcX) covered goods from India. BdlTI.dl Ov ho:..^ AXH’ -aT^ CQHiOhi T 10^ The increase in the number of services both eastward and westward has been considerable and it is not unusual for three to four Sunderland fly.mg boats to night stop in Bahrain. Unfortunately no proper accommodation exists for the passengers so tha u much discomfort has to bo d,cceptad by the many senior and distinguished civilians and Service officers travelling by air. fhe Roy«»i Air Force pier, which is used for the operations of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, was extended uo carry a motorable road, emd terminal buildings were constructed to hold a restaurant and servicing offices on the sea-end. The Corporation*s accommodation on the landing ground of Muharraq Island still leaves much to be desired but it is understood that they are moving x'rom their present weatherboard hut to more substantial and imposing quarters early in the coming year.- 20 - &lt;s&gt; 24. MESSRS CABLB: &amp; TIRELESS LIMITED 1 No works of importance are reported to have been carried out by this company during the year under review* Their numerous commercial and Service 'services” were maintained, and there was a considerable increase in staff to enable further Service demands to be undertaken* 25. MlJtfSP &gt;. PETROI^OM COMPELIQMS LIMITED Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited, Messrs. Petroleum Development (vatar) Limited, and Messrs, petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited have made little progress during the period under review. At the end of the year operations in Qatar were still suspended and with the exception of nego tiations to obtain an extension to the Ajman Option agreement no work was done on the Trucial coast whatsoever* 26. AMERICAN CON^ULAT^DftiHRAK On the 2nd September 1944 the United States of America after negotiations with the Government of the Hejaz and Nejd opened a Consulate at Dhahran. Mr. Parker T. dart, an officer of the State Department of six years standing with the rank of Vice-consul was the first Consular official to be appointed. Mr. Hart who is assisted by Mr. C.J.McIntosh paid regular visits to tho Bahrain Petroleum Company's premi- 1 ses at Awali, Bahrain having been included informally by the United Stages Government within his consular Jurisdiction. 27 . asm Ap Baa During the year 1944 there was an increase in the number of Royal Air Force personnel stationed at Muharraq and in addition some two hundred men of the U.S.A.T.C. arrived in the early spring and early summer. This additional personnel was required in connection with the operation of the Far .-^st reinforcement programmes both for British and American aircraft. The Air Liaison Officer remained in charge of the Station but No.43 Staging post, to which more than ninety percent of the Royal Air Force personnel are attached, andthe U.3.A.I.C. Staging Post remained under their respective conimanders. Relations with the Royal Air Force and the U«S«A*T*C. were conducted through the Air Liaison Officer and the same procedure was followed at Sharjah where a con siderable building programme was embarked upon to provide permanent accommodation for the personnel of the Royal Air Force and the U*S*A.f*C. stationed there. The effect of the abnormal rains on the Jguharraq landing ground and the Sharjah landing ground towards the end of the year gave rise to much anxiety as both grounds were out of order for several days at a time. As far as Bahrain was concerned the position was considered to be suffi ciently serious to warrant the introduction of a programme designed to overlay the main runways on the Muharraq ground with pierced steel plates. The work, which had been commenced at the end of the year, will have the additional advantage of strengthening the surface of the ground to enable it to be used for very heavy bombers.- 22 - 1 . TRUCIAL COAST TRUCIAL SHAIKHS (i) The following were the ruling shaikhs of the Trucial Coast during the ye&amp;ri- (1) Dubai - - Shaikh Sa*id bin Maktum, 0*B.E. (2) Sharjah - - Shaikh sultan bin saqr (3) Abu Dhabi- - Shaikh Shakbut bin sultan (4) Uto-al-Qawain - Shaikh Ahmed bin Rashid (5) Ajman - - Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid ( 6 ) Ras-al-Khaiiaah- Shaikh sultan bin Salim (7) Kalba - - shaikh Hamad bin Sa f id (Minor) Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad (Regent) (ii) The shaikh of Dubai spent rather more than a calendar month in April and May in India to which country he had gone in search of expert advice with regard to his eyes. On the Shaikh^ return on the 28th of May he was involved in what might have been a serious mishap to the aircraft in which he was being flown. The aircraft developed trouble with its landing gear and was forced to land at Jiwani ivith the wheels up. Owing to the amazing skill of the British Overseas Airways Corporation pilot not only was no one Injured but the twenty three passengers were scarcely even shaken. (iii) On the 19th of -April the ‘shaikh, of Sharjah went to India for medical treatment. His cure was somewhat delayed owing to speticemia following on the amateur efforts of his son Khalid to give the Shaikh the course of injections prescribed by his physician. After paying a visit to Delhi the shaikh returned to Sharjah on the 12th of September. (iv) Shaikh Hamad bin Sa*id the minor Shaikh of Kalba was with great difficulty induced to come to Bahrain to be educated under the supervision of Mr. F.J. Wakelin the Director of Edu cation. After some preliminary difficulties the young man settled down satisfactorily in one of the primary schools, being lodged in the school hostel. On the completion of the school year on the 30th of June he returned to Kalba for the holidays apparently very willing to return on the re-opening of the schools in September. Unfortunately the return to freedom and the influence of his cousin Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah undid all /the- 23 - the good which the visit to Bahrain had done and by the end of the year he had not returned and there seemed little likelihood of his uncle the Regent having sufficient force of character to insist on his doing so* 2* BRITISH IWT^EdTS There is no doubt that the friendly relations which have existed for many years with the Rulers of the jrucial Coast have now been extended not only to the more remote tribal shaikhs, in particular Shaikh Mohaiaod bin Ali bin Huwaidin the paramount shaikh of the Beni ^itab with whom our relations are now well established, but to the people of the towns and villages. The country is opening up and the inhabitants of the remoter parts of the interior are becoming accustomed to the sight of military vehicles, aircraft, and anti«locust parties carrying on their multifarious works and duties. . sgipp pft During the year under report there was some dissatisfaction I particularly at Sharjah with the failure of the War Shipping Administration or whatever body was responsible to arrange for a regular service to the Trucial coast both from and to India. The situation had improved towards the end of the year and it is recorded that a total of 38 ships called at Sharjah and the same number at Dubai during the period under review. It must however be borne in mind that a number of these vessels were military transports and naval vessels which put in exclusively on official business. (i) Subscriptions towards the building of a hospital at Dubai had by the end of the year reached the considerable total of Rs.1,93,007. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining suitable building materials, in particular iron girders and cement from India or elsewhere, no progress could be made other than the securing of an admirable site for the hospital. The funds subscribed have therefore been placed in the National Banfc Of India in Bombay to await more spacious days.(ii) In the early part of the year a comparatively serious smallpox epidemic occurred at Sharjah and Dubai during which several thousand vaccinations were carried out. Prompt action by the political and medical authorities resulted in the outbreak being rapidly brought under control. A further threat at Ras-al-Khaimah later in the year resulted in the vaccination of 2,400 people in the Ras-al-Khaimah — Rams area and the almost immediate control of the disease. (iii) Civilian motor transport, except in the case of a very few cars owned by the more important Shaikhs,has become a thing of the past on the Trucial coast. Lorries and cars which normally plied for hire were still awaiting spare parts at the end of the year and the donkey has once more come into his own. (iv) The companies formed at Dubai and Sharjah to organize the distribution of cereals and a further commercial body constituted specifically for the control of piecegoods have functioned with conspicuous success throughout the year. The companies dealing with cereals have also been entrusted, under the general supervision of the British political Authorities, with the operation of the barter system which is designed to encourage the import of goods not otherwise available locally by and which are essential for the wellbeing of the people provi ding for export authorised quantities of goods in demand outside the Trucial Coast. (v) The pearling season was on the whole not particularly successful although the local representative in Dubai of Messrs, Dhamanmal Issardas and Brothers, Mr. Qansham Das, is reported to have invested some twelve lacs of rupees for the second year running. The number of boats which went out was less than last year for the reasons already mentioned in connection with Bahrain, that is to say, steady employment on land provided by the building programmes of the Royal Air Force and the United states Air Transport Corps at sharjah induced a \ number of divers to remain on shore.5 . Zucmm (i) A sradi raiding party of Che A’.raair attacked Hira in the miudle of August and killed one jaid bin Abdullah bin Rashic and kidnapped his small boy. The boy f s mother bei ig from the Beni ^itab tribe that tribe insisted on the A^auir returning him to his relatives. It is of interest to note that the raiders were the guests of the Shaikh of ^h^rjali on the night on *hich the raid occurred. (ii) During the s«tme month owing to a disagreement between the Man^six and the Beni , d itab there was«rery prospect of a serious tribal i.uv breaking out between the Beni Qitab and the Shaikli of Abu Dhabi but the mediation of the Chiefs of the N^im and the Al BuShami tribes and the wise advice given by Shaikh Mohamad bin Ali bin Ifuwaidin the paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab resulted in peace being maintained.

MVLQAL Agency Hospital The hospital has sufficient accommodation for indoor cases, tfard furniture requires repair and replacement, which can only be done satisfactorily after the war. The supply of special drugs, dressings and appliances by the Medical Stores at Bombay has been curtailed but ordinary supplies are sufficient. Staff - Medical Officer, Assistant Surgeon, Compounder and three male dressers. The hospital was open throughout the year. The attendances were as under i- 1943 1944 Outdoor new cases • • 4,734 6,597 Indoor admissions • • 108 147 Major operations • • 11 _ _ Minor operations • • 28 35 The chief causes of illness were malaria, venereal diseases, eye diseases, deficiency diseases, minor septic and respiratory diseases. Anti-malaria measures were carried out by the State authorities. Fish w£re introduced into wells and open tanks. The lack of Pyrethrum for spraying inside buildings was a serious handicap. The supply of shark liver oil, although received late, was a great help in dealing with deficiency diseases and even in ulcer cases and eye diseases.- 2 - Major operations were carried out at the American Mission Hospital Mattrah. Quarantine Smallpox - The epidemic continued till April, The last four cases were discharged from the quarantine camp at Eewi on the 28th April. The stationing of quarantine guards at the sea front at Mattrah and the toll bar at Kewi has proved effective. The Haramil Quarantine Station has sufficient accommodation in a store shed for infectious cases requiring isolation. Lymph for vaccination has been regularly received but very often much after the time when it could be classed as 'fresh**. No infectious diseases were reported from ships in harbour. Enteric fevers - Five cases of typhoid occurred in • Muscat. One died. TAB inoculation was carried out where possible. No other infectious disease was reported. III. POLITICAL SITUATION (a) Tribal . Fight between the Duru and ManaXrah tribes . - In March trouble broke out in Fhahirah between the Duru ani Manazrah tribes which resulted in the latter sustaining 12 casualties. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar of the Jabal Akhdar and the Imam intervened, and imposed a fine of 0 4,000 on the Duru tribe. Half of this sum was entered in the Bait al Mai account, ani the balance paid to the Manazrah tribe as bloodmoney for the casualties. Trouble between Bani Hasan and Awamir . - In the month of July a dispute arose between the Bani Hasan of Boshar and the Awamir of Sib. Efforts were made by both Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, and Ismail bin Khalil Ar Rassassi, the Chief Wali, to reconcile the parties but these proved unsuccessful. Eventually the Minister for Internal Affairs called on Shaikh Mohsin bin Zahran As Siyabi of Oman, the Imain , s representative at Nafa* to mediate. This proved successful. Ja*alan Affairs . - The Imam of Oman received information that Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah, Amir of Ja*alan, was, through his Qadhis, endeavouring to persuade the Bani Bu Hasan to adopt the Hahbali creed and drop that of the Abadhi*s. He proceeded to Jatalan and asked the Amir to refrain from these activities and punish the offenders. Later the Imam appointed a representative in Ja*alan to guard the Bani Bu Hasan interests. (b) Local . Shaikh Saif bin Hamad al Aghbari was appointed during the year Chief Qadhi of Muscat Court in place of the late Shaikh Isa bin Salih. Ali bin Mudhaffar, lately *ali of Shinas and Wali designate of Saham was appointed Wali of Luwa in the place of Saiyid Nasar bin Hamood who was suddenly dismissed. The employees of the Customs Department struck during the-3- M o I year because their demand for increase of pay had not been accepted by the Director General of Customs. This is believed to be Muscat’s first attempt at an organised strike, and it resulted in the discomfiture and punishment of the ringleaders. In commemoration of the Bicentenary of the A1 Bu Said dynasty special postage stamps with the words 'A 1 Bu Said' overprinted in Arabic were on sale from 20th November to the end of the year. The total issue was ft.50,000/-. TRADE . ( i) The following table gives the comparative values of imports and exports during the last three years t- Year 1941- 1942 1942- 1943 1943- 1944 Imports Rs. 53,12,403 fts. 63,40,792 Rs.1,43,82,740 Exports Rs. 38,68,298 te. 81,18,976 fls.1,28,34,679 increase in the import figures is due to increased prices and not quantities. The following table shows the average price per package «- 1941- 1942 1942- 1943 1943- 1944 Imports Rs. 14/4/- Rs. 34/3/- Rs. 93/7/- ,^ he increase in the value of exports during the year 1943-1944 over those of 1942-1943 is mainly due to the high price of dat.es and fish, coupled wi*th a favourable dollar exchange rate. The following table shows the percentage of imports and exports from and to other countries Aden and Aden Protectorate Africa Ceylon India Iraq Persia Persian Gull’ United Kingdom Yemen Total Imports 1942-1943 1943-1944 4.00 % 3.20 % 0.80 % 16.40 % 89.00 % 68.00 % -- 0.60 % 1.60 % 3.00 % 2.40 % 6.80 % 1.80 % 1.00 % 0.40 % 1.00 % 100,09 100.00 Exports 1942-1943 1943-1944 1.30 % 4.00 % 1.20 % 2.00 % 2.00 % 0.30 % 66.70 % 66.00 % 6.20 % 12.50 % . 2.00 % 4.00 % 29.20 % 21.00 % - 1*40 % 0.20 % 100.00 100.00 The main articles of imports were cereals, sugar and textiles, and those of export dates and fish.

(f) Saiyid Fahr bin Taimur . - Was at the Mayo College, Ajmer, throughout the year. , II. m SC IF AL •U-'FA j&amp;g. The Muscat Municipality carried out various improvement during the year. These consisted of the acquisition of old houses and their demolition for the construction into open spacos. The mud walls in various narrow streets were replaced by stone walls. The road was broadened. Contracts for the removing of rubbish were also given. The Matrah Municipality was not so active and the friction between the Khoja arid Arab communities in the spending of sums collected during the year continued. A certain amount of road cleaning was carriad' out. The Municipality also repaired the pass to Matrah which was damaged by rain, and also some roads in the Muscat. III. EDUCATION . Anwar al Tamimi, a Palestinian, was headmaster of the local primary school throughout the year. He went on leave to Palestine and there recruited another Palestinian teacher, Abdul Qadir as Sawwan, and returned with him to Muscat in-5- rj October* Average attendance was 130 pupils. There are 3 teachers. IV. GENSRAL COWiKICATIONS .

A locust party consisting of two British mechanics ani nine Indians unaer Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald arrived at Shmas on the 2isnd January and Muscat on the 13th February. The mission* was withdrawn before completing its operations as it was urgently required in Saudi Arabia. I. Q JM A D U R Khan Sahib Mirza Ismail Barduli, from 1st January to 17th April. M». H. M. Ismail, from 18th April till the end of the year. THE ML I. Hamad bin Hilal was the Sultan* a representative throughout the year. w II.- 6 - *^111• TRADE . Gwadur obtains its main imports from Karachi, and these are augmented to a certain extent by supplies from Makran. The chief export is dried fish to Ceylon. Figures of imports and exports arc included in those for Museat. A coast watching patrol of one Jemadar and 8 men continued during the year. They cover the coast from Sur to Pishkan. V. gQM&amp;m: CATIONS . wireless station at Gwadur, which was established by H.Q. Sind District for coast watching purposes, was closed down in November as it is now considered that the civil line is reliable. VI. POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS. Tha re have been no changes in the post system throughout the year. Into it uptione in the telegraph line were frequent but the line was satisfactorily repaired during the year. VII. LOCUST OPERATIONS . i The Baluchistan Locust Department have a Locust Assistant stationed at Gwadur and the British Agent acts as Tahsil Locust ihere was an outuroak of smallpox in eoidemic form during the year which resulted in 491 cases and 145‘deaths. There was also an outbreak of smallpox at Pishkan and Bur whiCax resulted in 150 and 16 cases with 5 and one deaths respectively. IV. v/&amp;l watctoiq. Officer. in some areas. VIII. SMALLPOX . in April a wave of locust infiltrated into Gwadur and population rose to a maximum of 9,600 locusts per square mile The iierodrome remained unserviceable during the year. The trade with India continued to be carried on by dhow as no steamer* of the British India steam Navigation called at Gwadur. Political Agent, Muscat.Jk J BEFORT ON T1IE MUSCAT 7MFAMTP.Y FOR Tyre ^TAP TQ^, / r ; I. Ituscat Defence a . The p«r«flnent defensive works of Muscat are ,in exdefiwiiji condition and no essential repairs are necessary- As stated TnT^ report for 1943 some minor repairs are required to Mirani and Bait-al-Falaj forts. This work consists mainly of •’Facing* and ’’Pointing” and can only be carried out whenoement becomes available. The outer defences, consisting of Watch Towers and Sangars for pi quets, have been repaired where necessary and are in good condition. The 12 pounder Naval gun which web salvaged from the “Dahpu* in 1943 and presented by the R-I.N. is still unmounted at Bait-al-Falaj,. As reported last year, the services of a Naval Gunnery expert were required todieck the deficiencies and give advice as to the mounting of the gun. Several Naval Officers, including N.O.I.C., Horraux, have been down to look at the gun but so fax nothing further has been done, The two 2.75 and three 3 pounder guns are in serviceable condition. Various Gunnery instruments have been recieved which increase the efficiency and make accurate indirect fire possible. The present Gunner V.G.O. has now completed his two years with the Bhiscat Infantry and has applied for reversion to his Unit, his reasons being that he thinks he is being passed over for promotion. T is is a common complaint of young V.O.Otskent hare and I think there is some foundation for their fears despite the Army Instruction to Regimental Centre commanders to the effect that they should ensure that such V.C.C’s are not overlooked.* 2. Batinah Coast . Once more it has been impossible to carry out a full tour of the Batin&amp;h Coast owing to lack of Transport (the Wali 6f Matrah was recently asked to pay eighteen hundred dollars for a tour to Shinas and back over a period of a fortnight). This will be dealt with more fully under 'Launch” and ”Motor Transport” paragraphs. The more important forts are, however,, in reasonable repair and suitable for the role in which they would be employed. 3. Launch . Under this paragraph in the 1943 report I stated that it was ray inten tion to take the Launch to Karachi, for a complete engine overhaul, all ar- ' angements were made but at the last moment the Port Engineer Karachi was unable to undertake the overhaul until many months later. Hermann and Mohatta were then approached but were unable to take the work owing to pressure of Government work. In addition no Insurance Company in India would under take the Insurance of the Launch for a passage between Muscat and Karachi, thus the whole scheme fell through. The launch is still being used regularly but requires a new Magneto. Plug leads and Plugs. Th® Cable and tireless Company very kindly overhauled the Vlagneto to the best of their ability and it is working reasonably well, but I do not consider the Launch safe for long journeys until the above re placements ftave been *ade. Some form of worm has found its way into the hull below the waterline despite the f act that it has been carefully looked after. It is my opinion that the wood used originally could not have been seasoned teak. 4* Wireless . Please refer to my reports of 1942 and 1943. The situation remains uhe same, nothing further can be done until an expert wireless engineer can be obtained. A so^alled expert, the R.A.F. wireless officer from Sharjah, came to look at the sets at the beginning of the year and succeeded in bnm- ing out two condensers and 'blowing” two transmitting valves, he then left for Sharjah.Note* Prior to permission being given to this office to inspect the sets I obtained confirmation in writing from Captain Metcalfe that jPour Highness had sanctioned the use of these sets for Coast Watching. 5. Strength . The force has been between eight end twenty-seven under strength during the yoer. Desertions have been below the average for 1942 and 1943 but recruits for the major part of the year have been practically unobtainable, the reason being, as before, local men can work as coolies at Masirah with better pay add less discipline, and Mekran men are not coming over as living conditions, according to the reports of men return ing from leave, are infinitely better in Mekran than in Muscat. Reports show that the crops there have been good, and that rice is available, rationing being apparently non-existant. During the months of October, Nov ember and December there has been a sudden influx 6.f local recruits, mainly ex Maiirah coolies, a possible reason being the reduced pay of the coolies at Masirah. There is still a certain amount of feeling about the meagreness of pay. It was hoped that as the value of the dollar decreased living, in Muscat, would become easier. But unfortunate as the dollar drops, the shop keepers prices ]go up to counteract the fall in the exchange rate. Subedar (local Subedar Major) Allah Dad continues to work well, he talks of retiring in about a year*s time. He has been recommended or the O.B.I. Jemadar Hassan Gul has reverted to Military Duty and has been re placed by Jemadar Sheikh Mohd, Punjab Regiment, who is a much more suitable type. He is an old regular soldier with plenty of experience and a nice manner• Jemadar Ahmed Sher wishes to revert to Military Duty and a suitable replacement has been asked for. It is a pity th?.t is going ajs he is a great asset, in addition to superintending the Gui^ery he lias trained the signallers, he himself being a qualified signalling Instruct6r. Jemadar Fakir Mohd is satisfactory but that is all, he is a man lacking in intelligence and is becoming increasingly lazy, it is a great pity that he was ever promoted. In view of his long service he has not been discharged but should go on completion of his present agreement as he is holding up the promotion of better and keener men. Prior to my arrival it appears to have been the policy to promote men to such positions as Havildar Major merely because they had long service irrespective of whether they were efficient or not. I am trying to eliminate these M venerable old men' as soon as possible without causing unnecessary ill feeling. This is difficult as there are no pensions. Jemadar Lashkaran who was promoted Jemadar last year continues to come w? to expectations, he still does not realise his position and is inclined to fraternise rather too much with the men. He attended a machine gun course at Saugor this year and obtained a Q2, which is as good as could be expected, in view of the fact that hie knowledge of Roman Urdu is not up to the standard required for the Indian Army 3rd Class Certificate of Education. 6. Training. The standard of training is on the whole good, and I consider the force suitable in every respect for the work for which It is intended. It would be of the greatest assistance if more N.C.O.'s could be sent on Army courses of Instructions in India but this is impossible esxw # owing to the low standard of literacy, it is essential that such men hould be abil^to read Roman Urdu manual? if they are sent on courses. All my ef forts to form a school have been defeated by the ban on the export of writing materials.•4- T t 7. Clothing and equipment . There has been a vast improvement since last year, we have received practically all clothing indented for in our 1943 indent plus ajreplacement of clothing for that which overcarried and was eventually lost at Andimeskh in 1943* We now have, apart from a few minor ai'ticles, all the clothing essential for the next 18 months. I am, however, ordering some more under our 1945 indent as, when I was on recess in India this year, I visited the Kirkee Ordnance Depot and was given to understand that the pres€nt uniform i.e. Push Shirt, Shorts. Hose tops and putties, was ob solescent and that the whole of the Indian Array was going into Jungle Green Battle Dress. I therefore consider it advisable to obtain a stock of Bush Shirts, Shorts, etc. before they become unobtainable as, apart from the unsuitability of Pattie. Dress for Muscat, the change over to the new uniform would be a greet expense as the new dress comprises a green blouse., green trousers, web anklets and boots, none of wVich we possess. It is hoped that by the time all this clothing is expended that the War situation will permit the export of Khaki drill to enable us to make our own uniforms here as was done previously. We have now received six more V.B, guns (2 cf whic v have been sent to Dhofar) which leaves us a total of 5. 8. Ammunition . S.A.A. expended since January 1944 is as followss- Type Expended Balance .303 Ball 24052 3 , 12,$72 .303 Blank 220 4,370 .303 Tracer Nil 2,992 .455 Pistol 284 2 605 .455 Tub Machine Gun Nil IjSOO Grenades 9 107 Cartridges Ballastite 9. Transport. 4 276 (a) Animal . M.G. Donkeys are in good condition and show a great improvement on last year, as we have been able to feed a certain amount of grain Arhich was obtained from a shipment condemned by the Medical Authorities as unfit for human consumption. The three horses on charge are in good condition, two are fit for normal work and the third is used as a brood mare. It is proposed, at the first opportunity, to attempt to breed mules for the carrying of machine guns and 2.75 guns, as donkeys and camels are not really suitable as sad dlery to fit these animals is unobtainable. The camels are still with the Walis as stated in my report for 1943 and consequently we are absolved from the cost of keeping them. They are, however, available in case of emergency. The farm at Ruwi still continues to provide the major part of the forage, i.e. Cherri, Bajri and Lucerne for the animals. More ground at Ruwi has been put under cultivation for fodder this year than was done previously. In addition, owing to the unexpected monsoon-like rain at the beginning of December we have an abundance of water which local experts say is sufficient to keep the falaij flowing for at least three months, should any further rain fall, as is likely in January mjCKmot up it will be sufficient for a year. I have, consequently opened up six fields North of the Fort for fodder. I understand that these particular fields have not been under cultivation for eight or nine y ars owing to lack of water. /4 0 &gt;) 1 LX. Please see my report for 1943. The situation has continued to de teriorate as we have had, to all intents and purposes, none of the spare parts which have been urgently required for the past three years. 2. 30 Cwt. Chevrolet lorries have now boon sent to Karachi for repa by Naraindas and Company, whether these repairs will be possible or not is as yet not known. We now have two lorries fit for running between Muscat and Mat rah. Thes^are only kept going with constant daily attention by the Transport Hevildar, Ali Murad whom I had trained f or t hree months by Naraindas and Company in Karachi. The springs of these lorries which h ve been in use fer the last two years consist of bumporo which I have bought from old taxis, no more are now available. The fan-belts are still being made out of old web-equipment, this, also has now been liquidated. The radiators of the t wo remaining lorries are ^ so full of cement that they boil every two or three miles. This constant overheating naturally causes excessive cylinder wear, and it is unlikely that these lorries will last more than another six months. Repairs which would have been possible two y ars ago, had spares been supplied, hav now become impossible even if we should received the spares indented for. Nothing short of a major Workshop overhaul would have a ny change of putting these lorries into satisffietory working order, even this, in ray opinion, may not be possible. I have asked for an e stimate for the repairs of the two lorries al ready in Karafhi as. I am of the opinion that the cost of these repais will equal, if not exceed the cost of new lorries. No spare parts have been supplied fpr tfte V8 Station Wagon, and from latest information it ■would appear that Ordnance have no spares for this model nor are any likely to become available in the future. The purchase locally in Karachi is impossible under the present sjstem as, after obtaining the necessary per. its from Central Government, one Las to apply to the Provincial Motor Transport Controller who proceeds either to out down the sanctioned quantities as permitted by Central Gov ernment, or else he states that he cannot Issue the necessary permits from his province owing to shortage. As reported last year the Musc&amp;t-M&amp;trah road is in an appalling condition and causes an immense amount of damage to our lorries. Saiyid Shihat bin Faisal has at last agreed to my putting the men of the Muscat Infantly tovork on the road for a short time. This will be good training for them and useful work, as this ro d is a military necessity. 10. Medi.cal . We are deeply Indebted to our Medical Officer, Captain Matthews for his comprehensive report on the Infantry. This is a much filt want but our previous Medical Officers have not been able to produce one. It will be of the utmost value in ascertaining whether our health measures are effective or not. The report in appended herewith. ANNUAL HEALTH REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY, BAIT-AL-FALAJ. January 1st, 1944 to December 31st 1944. Introductory. An Annual Medical Report on this Unit has not, apparahtly, been rendered during the period of the War, but is is proposed to submit such reports in future as proposed by the Military Adviser.- 6 - The statement as below may appear to be of little value at present, but is is /oped that it will be the basis of a statistical record of health and disease, which statistics alone can shoy; progress or otherwise in a Unit 2 nd the ststsinonts made be of value for reference at a later period. Comment . I was attached as M.O. Unit in the middle of June 1944 but have endeavoured, with the help of excellent records left by my predecessor Dr. C. Hynes, D.TM. (Cal.) to report on the health of the Unit fcr the whole of 1944. The Unit has an average strength of 300 Other R*hks (this dees net include 10% oi sanctioned strength of 350 on leave and furlough) commanded by Major L.B.Hirst, Military Adviser to H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. In the strength of Other Ranke are included the senior V.C.O. Subedar Major Allah Dad of the I.A. and two other V C.Os. also of the* I.A. In addition there are two Jemadars locally recruited. The Barracks situated at Bait-al-Fal&amp;J are well sited and orientation in positioning is excellent. The area is at least 3/4 of a mile from the nearest habitation, hence its isolation from infection and other disease. The temperature during the summer months is lower than in Muscat. ine Medical discipline in the Unit isoi’ a very high&amp; standard. Having served over 29 years with the British and Indian Army in War and peace, I can appreciate the attitude of a C.O. who realises that the health of the Unit is his responsibility, and not the Doctor’s, yet seeks advice at every step he puts forward towards the defeat of disease in his Unit. His attitude in such matters is clearly reflected in the work of ^ or V.C.O., Subedar Allah Dad whom I found extremely interested 300 328 I 5 ‘ .3 .3. .6 (It is regretted that the average constantly sick cannot be estimated as this record was not maintained. This will be done in future.) ana nexprui during tne absence of the C.O. on recess. Statistical Table J.

The ratio has been worked out per 1000 in order that comparison may be made with Units of the British and Indian Army at Home and abroad, in which all ratios are so calculated* It is common knowledge that Malaria, V.D., Eysontery, Diarrhoea and Minor septic diseases are classed as Preventable Diseases. From a glance-at the above tables these diseases, except dysentery arid diarhoea, show a very high ratio, but this must not be attributed to any negligence, but rather to a want of weapons to combat these infections. Malaria . Shows the highest infection rate. Uhen it'is realised ± that recruitment into this Unit is from Muscat and Matrah where Malaria is rampant, it can easily be understood how infection is carried into the lines. The store-house of infection is the man who goes to see his people residing in one of the above towns. The C.O. cannot order Mos quito nets down at sunset® fort hors are no Mosquito nets. Nor can he order n Lortg trousers on at sunset# when slacks are he possession of only the opulent. Shirt-sleeves are however worn down from sunset to sunrise. The C.O. does however order all standing water to be grained, all Utility collections of water to be changed every seven days and wells M fished w . Anti-mosquito cream is available and used but we hope some day to have mosquito nets, etc. as weapons in our campaign. ^-•-P• The actual figures though high are a pleasant surprise to those who know the uxorious nature of the people here and around. There are no social amenities or amusements for t he men of the Infantry, except games which are encouraged, otherwise trhere is nothing. I** my capacity as M.O. of the A ency Hospital I am daily in touch with the Civil Population and know how high veneral incidence amongst the women is. In addition there are no P.A. rooms, no P.T. outfits and condon is ianknown. It is hoped that these measures will be taken up when the vex is over. Bowel Diseases . Dysentery and Diarrhoea have a low ratio. This is also surprising when It is realised that Matrah and Muscat are the Filed paradise. It can therefore be surmised that the isolated site of the Fort and the attention to hygiene in the Lines are factors reducing bowel infection. Minor Septic D5res.nos . Under this head are included the ulcers which are and have been the m.o c t disgusting sight that one sees daily everywhere. These ulcers respond rapidly to Anti-Syphilitic treatment and thereby prove hereditary syphilis in many persons. Here one might also include men who are placed in the next heading, deficiency diseases. There is no doubt that Vitamin deficiency is a vital factor in the ulcer cases* I have noticed that chaplis when first issued cause a large number of abras ions on the men’s feet. Deficiency Piseases . Many are the men who might easily have been shown sick under this clause. It ixS a common complaint one hears M my legs ache”, M my back hurts and I feel weak 0 . The men are not malingering but are ^truthfully exposing a neutotic condition brought on by lack of vitamin. The food of the soldier in the Infantry is far better than he would get in his home, nevertheless during sunder months there is a lack of vegetables and there must therefore be a rise in deficiency diseases. The C.O takes a great interest in the vegetable garden at Ruwi. Good vegetables are available for the men during the win - er and this along with the free good ration has, to my mind, helped recruiting which is now on the rise. Anti-scorbutic tablets as an issue would I feel sure greatly help.Qcnclugion . In concl\ision I place on record the very satisfactory sanitation measures, *ater supply and measures to help our rork in the littlt detention Hospital. Here a Naik is left in charge. He has been there five years, is clean keen and obedient. It is realised that every man enlisted as first a soldier then anything else. By couatesy of the C.O. whig Eaik is not suddenly taken for fatigues, route marches, etc. etc. na turally the continuity in treatment of patients is maintained and apprecia tion felt that this system exists. X-ray work and major surgical work has been carried out at the Ame rica! Mission Hospital by Dr, W.Thoms, M.P. He is always willing to help and his proficiency as a surgeon is very deeply appreciated. II. Rations The ration remains the same as in 1943, i.e. Atta (no rice available) Dhal Ghee Salt Onion? Fish Food £ach man pays Annas 3 p.ra. towards Extra Messing vrhich includes kasala etc. Repeated attempts have been made to get the men to increase this subscription to onable mpat to be issued once or twice a week but al though men are willing to spend up to Rs.IO/- per month in Coffee shops, these attempts have invariably beer ret with 100$ refusal. The amount subscribed is extremely low when one considers that the normal subscriptions ox Indian Army Sepoys, on lower rates of pay than here, frequently subscribe Rs.2/3/- per month. l£ lbs. 2 oss. 1 02. i oz. oz. (approx.) 2 oss. (approx) 2 * lbs. During the cold weather we still continue to supply the following from Ruwi. Cauliflower, Onions, Cucumber, Prinj&amp;l, Cabbage, Pumpkins, Chillies ; Ladies ringers, Tomatoes, Melons, Spinach, Garlic, Turnips, Radish, Beetroot, Beans (various types). Unfortunately most of the men refuse to eat such things as tomatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, spinach and beetroot which would undoubtedly assist in preventing ulcers which are so prevalent and will only eat Radish, pump kin, brin^als and Ladies fingers. A number of Papaya trees planted last year have grown successfully but there is a shortage of fruit owing to the inability of any of the garden ers to determine the sex of these trees until they reach maturity. I am experimenting trith bananas brought fro,?, Sib which seem to be growing suc cessfully. The Canteen is supplying milk, tea, sugar, soap, cloth, cigarettes and matches at about £ the bazaar cost3, Aerated waters have not been available for the past 8 months as the Government of India have consistently refused export permits for our gas cylinders sent to Karachi for refill. The necessary permit has recently been obtained, 12. Snorts . Hockey and Basketball are pleyed regularly. The hockey team again won the open tournament for the Consulate Club Cup in April. Sports have oeen organised and men of the Infantry won the majority of priees at the open sports meeting held at the Maqbul Club in March. P.T. is carried out three times a week by all ranks.13. Buildings . Minor repairs have been carried out to the Barracks. A number of new roof beams are required but are unobtainable except at an exorbitant figure. The buildings are, at present, in no way dangerous. During the early part of the year a portion of the roof of the Fort collapsed and an ominous crack appeared in the west wall, both of these hav« now been repaired. During the early part of December serious damage was caused to the Falaij and i± ±w its M feeders M which supply the Fort with water from Ruwi by heavy rain. A large uortion between the Fort and the Aerodrome collapsed and a considerable amount of underground work was necessary to clear the obstruction. The main Falaij is now clear and work is proceeding on the 'feeder 1 * channels. In addition the Falaij collapsed beneath the Soda factory and the Mas.-jid, fortunately without damage to the buildings. This has already been cleared and repaired. All work is done by our own pioneers.CHAPT EH IX ADMIKiSTRATIOA RKPORT OF THE KHORRAMSHAHR CONSULATE FOR THE XEAR 1944. (If // Ilf I. H.M* s CONSULATE. Personnel .— Major A.C.

Trade .— War restrictions have again curtailed commercial activities. There have however been far-reaching develop ments in the port facilities and communications with the interior which must inevitably increase the importance of Khorramshahr as a commercial centre, after the war, and fully justify the presence of a Trade Agent whose appoint ment is under discussion at the time of writing. Anglo- 1 ranian oil Company .— The year has witnessed a further development in the Abadan Refinery and a great increase in the number of British subjects employed there. The rapidity of this increase has created many fresh administrative problems which have been rendered more difficult to solve owing to shortages of shipping and materials. III.— FuREIGR INTERESTS. Representation .— The only other foreign civil representative in the area is the Vice-Consul for Iraq. This appointment was held by Mr. Ahsan Suleiman from the beginning of the year till the 3rd October, and by Mr. Khalil Ibrahim from the 3rd October till the end of the year. Trade .— There have from time to time been reports of proposals to establish a Russian Trade Agent in this area, but nothing so far has come of them, though it seems reason able to expect that, with the rebuilding of their devastated industries, they will not overlook the importance of a port which has proved its capacity by handling vast quantities of war materials, and which can give them an easy outlet for their trade with South-East Asia. Towards the end of the year representatives of the Russian Consulate in Ahwaz showed considerable interest in the establishment of a War Propaganda Centre in Abadan.IV. — LUCa^ WVzBhdkkl^ Ustandar. (Governor-General).— The appointment has been held by Aghai Misban Katimi throughout the year. Karmandar (Governor).— Towards the end of 1943 the Governor ate at Khorranshahr was divided into two Govemorates, Khorranshahr, and Abadan. Aghai Hassan Mateen remains the Governor of Khorramshahr, and Sarhang Wohamed Sadiq Daulatshahi has taken over as Military Governor of the new Govemorate of Abadan. Though the Governorate of Abadan has been in existence for over a year, up to the time of writing, no separate budget has been sanctioned for it, and it exists on loans from the Yunicipality and other sources. J udiciar.v .— There are two Subordinate Courts (one each at Abadan and Khorramshahr) under the superintendence of a Senior Court at Abadan. All three Courts were kept busy throughout the year dealing with cases of pilferage and robbery. The general standard of their efficiency is deplorably low, but on the whole, British subjects who are involved in court cases have not experienced any increased difficulties by reason of their foreign citizenship. Police .— Sarhang (Colonel) Vighar has held the office of Chief of Police, Abadan, throughout the year and superintends the work of Sarwan (Captain) Nikokar who was appointed as Chief of Police for Khorramshahr about the middle of tne year, from Tehran. Both these officers are unusually efficient though they have had to face a serious shortage in the strength of the forces at their disposal, and continuous battles with Tehran for their supplies and maintenance. Gendarmerie .— Sarwan (Captain) Hakimi has held the post of Chief of Gendarmerie under the direction of Sarhang (Colonel) Shams-i-Mulk Ara in Ahwaz. The gendemerie forces are also considerably under strength and efforts to increase them have been fruitless. Hea lth.— Doctor Keza Nighabat has continued to hold the post of Quarantine and Yedical Officer, Khorramshahr, throughout the year. Abadan was however removed from his charge about the middle of the year and is now under the control of Dr. Oyand. Fortunately the general state of health in the two towns of Abadan and Khorrsnshahr has been good and there has been no serious epidemic, against which, apart from periodical issues of drugs and supplies from the Anglo-Iranian Relief Centre to medical officers, they would have had no means of contending. V. — MILITARY. Allied Forces .— British and American forces have continued to serve in the area throughout the year. There has also been a fluctuating force of Russian soldiers taking over Lease-Lend goods for Russia. Military requirements have necessitated tremendous improvement in the port, airport and communications with the interior, which, given the least activity on the parL of the Persian Government, cannot help but be of tremendous value after the *ar. Iranian Army .— Discussion has gone on periodically throughout the year regarding the establishment of a Persian garrison in this area but up to the time of writing they have not borne fruit. Iranian_Nayy.Iranian J/avy .— The Navy is still extinct and the Naval Base in the charge of the Allied Military authorities. Security .— Pilferage has been widespread among commercial and military cargoes landed at the port. The profits to be gained by this means have led to the formation of a number of gangs which, though they are kept reasonably well in check so long as Allied Military forces remain here, may become a menace to security after the War, more particularly as cessation of Aid to Russia Work will throw out of employment a large number of coolies collected here from the interior during the past two years, who have hitherto been assured of constant and lucrative employment. VI.— TRIBAL SITUATION. Cj gneral .— Apart from a scare at the beginning of the year that Shaikh Chassib, eldest son of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah was endeavouring to raise the tribes against the Persian Authorities, there has been little tribal activity. This scare fizzled out almost as soon as it was started and was never of any serious consequence. Disarmament .— At the end of the year disarmament operations were carried out by the Persian General Officer Commanding in Ahwaz and resulted in the collection of about 2000 rifles. The town areas of Khorramshahr and Abadan were however left untouched and it is possible that there is still a considerable number of arms hidden away, which may yet present the police with a serious security problem.

An inspection was made by the Reside; Hospitals, Dispensaries and Quarantine stations at Kuwait, Bahrain, Muscat, Dubai and Sharjah. 2. There are recognised quarantine stations at Kuwait, Bahrain and Liuscat. At present the permanent station at Kuwait is occupied by the military and a temporary one has been erected. The one at Bahrain is good. The Muscat one is fair. 3. At Dubai and Sharjah Isolation Camps are used for infectious and contagious cases. The erection and running of these camps are carried out by the Shaikhs under the advice ox' the medical officer. 4. Kuwait, Bahrain and i'uscat are well run by the Quarantine Medical Officer# there. 5. Small-pox epidemics occurred at Bahrain, Dubai, Sharjah at Ahasab and Bakha on the Trucial Coast and at Muscat.

Rotes on the working of quarantine on the Arab &gt; Coast of the Persian Gulf for the year 1943^ ---ooOjdfiQoo1943 was probably the most dismal year in the history of the Gulf administration. Barly in January the Government of India caused the utmost consternation lay their decision to give up the export of cereals, and the Arab States were obliged to sever their age-old connections with the trade for foodstuffs and look for other sources of supply. These were eventually organised by His Fajesty’s Government through the Middle Sast b up ply Ctntre, and the necessary cereals were back-loaded from Basra, Which unfortunately involved the consumption of a high proportion of lra*i barley, formerly sold for pig food at £2 a ton. as the rates charged exceeded those of Australian wheat. His Majesty's Government eventually granted a subsidy to make good the difference to these States, who were forced to change their diet of rice almost over-night to one of cereals which they had never eaten before and found the greatest difficulty in preparing, since the new arrangements involved offices who were - completely unfamiliar with the Gulf and quite unaware of local customs much extra work and responsibility devolved upon Gulf officers. it is interesting to record that on one occasion supplies were only made available on condition that I gave a personal guarantee for over £ 10 , 000 . Great confusion and dislocation was also caused by the continuing disintegration of the Gulf mail service. These scattered ports are not mere Jy dependent on trade with India and Europe, but also with each other, and the work of the Gulf Residency was almost brought to a standstill by the unwillingness of the Ministry of War Transport to listen to the requests made to them. They at no time showed any grasp of or interest in local problems and constant resort had to be had to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India to bring pressure to bear on them. The tremendous rise in the cost of living which had reached over 900^ in Persia by the close of the preceding year / naturallynaturally caused great discontent amongst the Residency staff. who had received no war allowance of any kind whatsoever. a high proportion of the tenporary men resigned and several per manent hands preferred to give up many years pensionable service rather than continue to serve under such arduous conditions* Nor was morale helped by the death in tragic and distressing circumstances of three of the senior and more experienced members of the staff* The position improved in May when the Government of India eventually granted dearness allowance which to some extent compensated for the altered conditions* No allowances however were granted to any of the officers of the Indian Political Service* and shortage of staff during the first three months of 1943 the Confidential office received three afternoons* holiday, work otherwise proceeding continuously throughout that period* A further feature which had showed itself earlier in the war now began to exercise an increasingly adverse effect. For many years no attempt had been made to train up officers for the Gulf service! and though a handful had acquired experience and languages of their own volition, they were in no way adequate for this highly technical and responsible task* post of Assistant Engineer which had been recommended in 1942* The Public Works Department naturally devolved into a state of chaos, and no works were undertaken, with the result that the buildings suffered greatly and all the grants for 1943 lapsed* On return to the Gulf I immediately brought all possible pressure to bear upon the Government of India for the restoration of the post, but no officer could be found to undertake it throughout this year, so that when overdue works were finally put in hand they cost many times what they would have done if they had been executed at the proper time • A case in point is the Bushire aerodrome which was originally programmed for 1942» but owing It is interesting to recall that owing to press of worl The utmost confusion was caused by the reduction of the / toIf to the absence of a Residency Engineer was ultimately constructed by Kampaax in 1943 at four times the earlier estimate. Stocks of essential engineering stores dwindled aa no fresh purchases were made and were either acquired in the following year with the greatest difficulty owing to enhanced rates and export restrictions or are still outstanding. The total number of vehicles produced by the U.K.O.G. plant in Bush ire is a military secret which the High Command refuse to disclose. Under the energetic guidance of Mr. Bode, who had been lent by the A.I.O.C., the somewhat ramshackle plant produced remarkable results, and despite every discouragement on the part of the military authorities was producing nearly 50 vehicles a day when it was closed down, a figure only just equalled by the Khorraroshahr plant which had every facility that America could provide. The other operations of the U.K.C.C. did not, however, enhance the reputation of the British mercantile community, and in Bushire as elsewhere, they left an unenviable reputation for incompetence and peculation. It would be agreeable to record that our Allies were cooperative and considerate, but this was not the case. Almost without exception the American detachment and visiting .American officers whether of the Army or the civil organisations showed little desire to consult their British colleagues or to cooperate with them. Ihe electrification of the perimeter of their camp, which was done without any intimation to the British .Army or civil authorities, recoiled upon their o«i heads as the first victim was an American soldier. Their behaviour varied from unsatisfactory to deplorable. At the fete given in aid of the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund at Sabzabad, a number of articles including spoons and forks were sto&amp;en from the house, apparently by offioers who penetrated the building. The drunkenness shown by the men on this occasion was without parallel in Bushire. Blsewhere they came to notice in an equally unsatisfactory manner, and the incident of the four American soldiers who penetrated the Governor's house at Khorramshahr one night and requested / himhim to supply them with women will long be remembered* Our Russian allies, though far better behaved, showed no desire to cooperate and remained inscrutable and aloof* A most unpleasant incident was narrowly averted when they defied the order of the British Movement Control not to move a certain convoy owing to insecurity on the road* ’rtie Residency as a whole heaved a sigh of relief when both these bodies took their departure* 'Famine conditions continued to prevail on the Persian Coast particularly in the outlying districts* Insecurity in Fare, particularly on the Bush ire Shiraz road, deteriorated and the inability of the Persian Government to deal with Kasir Khan ^ashqai might have resulted in his complete mastery over Fare had the tide of the success in the war in Bur ope not turned so strongly in favour of the Allies* In Bushire itself the closing down in August of the Truck Assembly unit of the U.K*C.C. threw large numbers of local labourers out of employment, many of whom emigratsd to the Khorramshahr area, where work offered. Much embarrassment was caused by the institution of Consular Liaison Officers for the supply of cereals* In 194i locum tenems had stated that this work would be conducted by this Residency itself, but the communication was overlooked and the area apparently attached to Shiraz. Before the situation could be regularised, (and it was never clear at any time what the functions of consular or consular liaison officers in the matter of cereals actually were,) it was found that this officer had granted a number of contracts for areas which did not exist to men who had no grain, and it was not surprising under the circumstances that one of the contractors, a prominent Shirazi of the name of Hishmat al Mamalik (who had accepted a contract purely as a speculation) produced no more than of his total contract of 2000 tons* Indeed but for the assistance of a local landowner, Fathullah Khan, the town of Bushire would have starvedIt only remains to add that the year was one of the severest famine on record* At the close of 194£ great excitement was caused by an R.A.F* report of lights having been seen signalling towards the sea at Jaak. 'jChe Senior naval officer wished this to be examined immediately in view of the possible danger to convoys, and I pa id a visit incognito to the scene by air with Hr •Rogers who later returned to make a fuller investigation* His researches, together with those of certain other agents who were despatched from different directions, eventually disclosed that the auspicious circumstances were susceptible of innocent explanations* The suspicious flickering of the lighthouse was found to be almost certainly due to the person in charge stealing the kerosene* The Vferey lights which had been seen eventually turned out to have been fired by R # A*P* personnel at a hyaina. The mysterious f signalling which had been seen inshore was discovered to be the mutual recogiition signals given each other with torches by the night patrols of the Persian Gendarmerie so that they might evade contact with the local Baluchis of idiom they moved in considerable dread. as a result of this and as part of a general tightening ✓ up a complete coast-watching system was put into force which very soon produced useful fruit in the best capture of pirates of which we have record for many years. Thie is recounted in the next paragraph* In April, acting on a report from H*M*Consul, Bandar Abbas, a British naval patrol vessel captured an armed dhow which had beon committing piracies off the Jask coast under the notorious Persian Baluchi pirates Husain bin Murad and his brother. The captured vessel together with its crew and their weapons were made over to the Persian authorities, who e entenced the ringleader to imprisomuent for life and his followers to varying terms of imprisonment, while some of the pirates died of starvation in prison before the trial took place* The capture was given publicity in the Persian and Indian press and over the All-India, / Tehran6 Tehran and Bahrain broadcasts* Early in 1943 a Commando was sent to Bandar Abbas to seek out and report on German parties and possible secret wireless stations. This body, which was despatched without consulting the political authorities, had only one member who spoke Persian and were completely ignorant of the fact that Persian morse differed from the ordinary variety. The men were lacking in discipline and gave rise to several unpleasant incidents, and the party was eventually withdrawn without achieving anything*, The Ruler of Kuwait gave his loyal cooperation through out the year. The only noteworthy event was the transit through Kuwait of some 9000 Persian pilgrims to Mecca, which forded up local prices to a high level. The Kuwait Oil Company continued on a 'closed down' basis. Cable and Wireless and the Imperial Bank of Iran worked efficiently. The various cases relating to the Shaikh*e Bate Gardens in Iraq pending before the Iraqi Land Settlement Board had not been finally concluded by the end of * the year, The K.C.I.E. (Honorary) was conferred on the Shaikh of Bahrain on January 1st. 'Eae pearling season was a fair one, much business being done with India in medium and inferior grade pearls* Oil production during the year was approximately 940,000 tons, and some 633,000 tons of Saudi crude was imported for refining. Royalties for the year totalled Rs. 27,13,864. Construction was started during the year on new plants for the production of Aviation Spirit. The services operated by the British overseas Airways Corporation rose from two flying boat and one larai plane service at the beginning of the year to seven flying boat and one land plane service in each direction at the end of the year. In Muscat the Maria Theresa dollar appreciated steadily during the year, rising from Rs. 200 to Re. 260 per 100 dollars. The B.I. S.S. 'Dahpu' was torpedoed in Muscat harbour on 28th June causing 45 casualties. His Highness the Sultan was in Muscat only from 19th October to the end of th e year, the rest / ofA. to the reductiun in mail steamer services, Muscat was for lengthy periods without mail communication with India* A locust mission from India visited the Batineh Coast and the neighbourhood of ^uriyat• It would be agreeable to record that the British military authorities, who had provided so many complications during this year for their civilian confreres bad been consistent ly considerate and cooperative but this was far from the case* The Commander in Chief was generally helpful and sympathetic but unfortunately there were several changes and the post remained vacant for long periods* In most cases the difficulties arose through officers in Baghdad and Basra controlling wide areas about which they knew nothing whatever, and the deplorable muddle in the lightering arrangements at Iftasirah Island was a case in point. This eventually led to bloodshed, and political action was necessary. In the sphere of intelligence the trafSi^^ was strictly one-way. Although the politioal officers in the Gulf supplied their military colleagues with all the information at their disposal throughout the year, the reverse was not the case, and Important documents such as the report on the capture of the German agent Mayer were withheld from this Residency* Through the courtesy of the Senior Naval officer I was able to peruse a porti on of this, and was interested to see that he had * stated in a communication to his superiors that 4 There is not a single Snglishraan between Buahire and Bandar Abbas** This vita] information, which had an obvious interest for the political authorities was not communicated, and was only gleaned long after the events at Jask had taken place* Sd.

(c) The elections to the iajlis, which took place in the autumn, were completed, by comparison with many other areas of Persia, very promptly; and produced the satisfactory result of the election by very comfortable majorities of the candidatas who enjoyed the good-will of the Residency. (d) Towards the close of the year, a drinking water scheme for the town of Bushire was inaugurated. This aims to bring in drinking water from an are a 25 kilometres away, by means of pipes, which in places have to run above the surface of the ground to avoid the effects cf the salt swamps lying in between the Bushire peninsula and the mainland. A grant cf one million tomans from the late Shah’s estate has been secured by Aqai Safavi, one of the Majlis deputies, to finance the scheme. (e) Funds were collected and a church built, mainly owing to the zeal of the Rev. R.N.Sharp, the C.M.S. missionary in charge at Shiraz. The church was consecrated by the Rt.Rev. W.J. Thompson,Bishop in Iran on the 6 th January 1944 and named the Church of the Epiphany. At the Persian opening ceremony on the £th January,' the Governor, Imam Juma and all the local officials were present, a display of friendliness which would be difficult to duplicate elsewhere in Persia. SECTION III . CO^JNICATIQNS . Land . The main road to Tehran was closed by British Army orders for a short period after the Persian Array’s defeat at Serairum at the hands of the tribes. Other wise the road remained open, lorries and cars being run in convoys between Kazerun and Shiraz during the late summer and autumn. Petty robberies occurred on the country roads to the south of Bushire: to the north, travel was secure. (b) Mail steamers became fewer and fewer through the year, until 2 raonths became no unusual inter val between padsenger ships to or from India. Postal communication was maintained only by use of the A.P.O.C. tugs, and the small packet, the M.V. Resang, which has a circular run inside the Gulf roughly once a fortnight. ( c ) Air . The airfield at Bushire was laid out with three runways, two of 1800 yards and one of 1200 yards. In one place the approaches were cleared by levelling a small hill. Arrangements were made for the storage of petrol in three buildings on the airfield, lent by the Persian Government. At Asalu a strip of 1200 yards was laid out and marked. At Lingah, the construction work on the aero drome T/hich was in progress under the Garrison Engineer, Sharjah, during 1342, was completed. (d) Telegraphic . After an unsatisfactory period during which the Persian Government wireless station at Bushire was nominally controlled by a member of the Anglo--4- 2? ) 5 Soviet-Persian Censorship, arrangements were niade for the station to be closed, and the schedules with Linr'ah and Ja»lc were undertaken by Cable and Wireless Ltd. * Liru aii, the Consular Apent took charge of the wireless station on his arrival, and now supervises all transmissions iii 6 lay-out oi tne Gulf cables has been revised, and now consists of two cables from Muscat to Fao, one via Bahrain and the other via Bushire. There is thus no direct cable from Bushire to Bahrain, but telegrams can De sent either via Muscat or via Fao. Cable and Wireless nave opened wireless corarunication with Bahrain, and this service has been announced to the public by the Persian Government. ( Foreign telegram rates are charged). ahCXIQH IV .

Only at Baiyir, where a detachment ox Persian troops was landed by night from H.H.S, Beabelle, in axi attempt to seize tne person of the notable brigand. Aux Ismail, was any result achieved. Although All Ismail, warned in time, made good his escape, and at the close of 'as in refuge with the Qashqai, he suffered some considerable loss of his personal property, and will probably thin* very seriously, so long as the British are in occupation of Persia, before he returns to his araunrllnir stronghold at baiyir. 01 (d) Kanadlr-l- 3 ele«. c . , Barly in the ;n 3 ar, the Chief of Gendarnerie, narwan anadrawan, attempted to arrest and detain Shaikh Audur Kasul al il.suri of Asalu. He detained him 4n a house in nalyir; where durln ( ; tile night an armed party, led by dasir al ^asuri, cane and effected a rescue, in the course of which Barwan Pishdad of the Gendarmerie ms killed. * 1G attitude of the Shaikhs of this area lias been uniformly friendly to the Allied cause; and Shaikh Suleiman al I.'asuri, who is also officially ’’Bakhshdar' (deputy Governor) of the area, has co-operated with Persian t^roops against All Ismail. Towards too end of the year, an American Air Force plane crashed near Asalu, and the-5- survivor, the navigator of the plane, was sheltered and :7Zr/ helped on his way by all the Shaikhs in turn. (e) The Shiblmh. This area was peaceful throughout the year. Two tours of it were made by H. M. Consul, and contacts establish ed with all the Shaikhs ( who are of Arab origin, as is a great proportion of the population). At the close of the year, a Consular Agency was established at Lingah with orders to maintain and improve our relations in this area. SECTION V . ‘ PUBLIC RELATIONS . (a) Relations with Persians, both official and social, remained on an extremely friendly basis throughout the year. Efforts were cade to increase and improve the scope of our publicity activities, which centred round the Bushire read ing room. This was organised on the lines of a club, with restricted membership { which rose however, towards the close of the year to nearly 200 members )5 and several additional amenities such as books, tea and games were provided, contact being maintained with the members through the medium of their committee. At the close of the year, two additional reading rooms, at Lingah and Borazjan, were opened and organ ised on the same principles. A daily news bulletin in Persian, based on the B.3.C fihglish news, was printed and distributed, and demands for this exceeded the limits which paper supply permitted. At the close of the year, a change-over was initiated in the system of free distribution of publicity magazines, to that of sale by a recognized bookseller. That distribution was maintained even after this change, speaks well for the popularity of the publications; and there is no doubt that a magazine for which a sura of raoney has been paid, is much more appreciated than one which has been presented free. • A cinema van provided by the Public Relations Bureau, Tehran, was lent to the area in the spring, and again in the autumn. Although the supply of full-length filmijis was disappointing ( unrelieved news reels and shorts become most monotonous, even to audiences previously unused to cinemas) the shows given were uniformly well attended and received. (b) Public relations were further strengthened by the relief work in the area financed by the Anglo- Persian Relief and Reconstruction Fund- At the close of the year, nearly 200 destitutes were being housed and fed in a caravahserai run by the Residency for the purpose, and food for 30 patients, sufferers from tropical ulcers and malnutrition diseases, who were accommodated in a nearby house, leased by the Persian Health Department, was also being provided daily. To alleviate Bushire*s grave drinking water pro blem, a dam to conserve rainwater was built in a valley near the Residency, with an estimated storage capacity of li million gallons. A large ,, ab-ambar ,, ( rainwater reservoir) w as constructed in Bushire town; and is intended for free distribution 6 f drinking water to persons too poor to buy it. A system by which paupers may apply .to the Residency for free burial of their relatives was also initiated, and has done much to relieve poor persons of an unwelcome and often crushing burden . Cotton cloth has been purchased in large quanti ties ( 7,000 metres in all ) and made up into suits for free issue to poor men and women; and these have mostly- 6 - been distributed personally by K.l;. Consul on his tours of the coast from bandar Dilam to Lingah. ^ates to a total of‘54 tons were purchased from Iraq, and distributed to relieve food shortage in the area during the year. (c) In June, a fete was riven by the Political uesiaen* .^.n the garden at Sahzabad. This was very well attended by Persians, both official and non- officialf and a satisfactory sum of money ( Rupees 8,000/-) was raised for the Persian Gulf Fi htsr Fund. vi (a) Cer eals . -or the 1irst half of ihe year, the Southern Ports area, suffering from the drought of 1041-42.continued to subsist on cereals imported by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. Although various difficulties were experienced, and it was on more than one occasion necessary to raise an urgent loan from the British Army detachment* 3 ‘ stocks of flour, the supplies were just eked out to last until t/&gt;e fruits ox the 1842-43 winter's '’ood ''arvest began to eo?*e in. Xo ensure the collection of the cro &gt; sur plus, a contract was entered into with Fathullah ilhan, C see paragraph V (a) above) for the delivery of the cereals of his three 'buluks* ( sub-divisions). This con- tract, Involving H.k.Consul in responsibility for the obtaining and disposal of Persian Government funds, was admittedly an extreme measure, and can be justified only i?? dire need of the area and the lack of a general directive from the capital as regards policy for cereals collection* The position became more regular at a Is ter stage, when the policy of ccntr&amp;ats-r&amp;S adapted Ih all parts oi Persia| and subsequently arrangecje tts were put in aand tor the re-transfer to the Persian Government department of the management of this contract and the settlement of accounts.

As a result of this visit a report was written, with recomnendations for the reorgan isation of the project; and towards the end of the year.

The prices of these commodities did not vary greatly through the year. At the end of the /ear, stocks were approximately 3.700 tons of sugar and 700 tons Ox oea, as against 4,000 and 3,000 at the beginning of the year. The remainder had been sent up the road to in- land town, mostly by I.fC.C.C. transport (see paragraph II u; xhe rationed issue was (monthly) 400 grammes of sugar, 50 grammes of tea and half a metre of cloth; but only one issue of cloth was actually »ade during the year, of 3 metres per 2 &gt;erson, being arrears of last year.

At the annual general meeting held at the close of the Persian year ( late February ) the aill showed a nett profit of 200% , out of which an interim dividend of 75% had been paid to the share-holders during the year. Considerable dismay was, however, caused by Dr.Millspaugh 1 s new income tax law, assigning a tax of 80% on incomes over Tomans 50,000 p.a.; and through this tax being ass essed on the year’s income of the mi'll, instead of indiv idually on the luce es of shareholders, smaller incomes naturally carrying a much lower rate of tax. ( Mr. Agar would have one believe that the shares of the mill are largely held by otherwise penniless widows and orphans). A second blow was st.rueh to the Hill in December by the announcement of the Persian Governnent’s intention*to control and monopolise all transactions in tea, sugar and piecegoods; and at the end of the year, the mill’s one toman shares, which hed previously stood at Ts. 7 /- had dropped to $s. 4 /- S ECTXON VII I HEALTH AND QUARANTINE .

The cost of living rose still further during 1943 and the Company continued to issue rations of staple foodstuffs, at controlled prices, to labour. Security . There have been several holdups of Company's transport on the Ganoweh and Behbehan roads by armed bands during the year. No loss of life occurred. The following is the strength of the Garrison:- Officers 10 Other ranks 313 One squadron of Skinners Horse provide guards for Du-Gambadah, Ab-i-Shirin and Production Plant. Many Government officials and notables visited the area during the year and were entertained by us. Relations with the local Khans remained most cordial. Water Supply . The supply was satisfactory. The total water pumped during 1943 was 72,278,580 gallons. Production . Wells Nos.8 and 13 were on production. Crude oil despatches to Abadan totalled 236,880,000 gallons.2. There were many other changes during the ye&amp;r, but it only necessary to mention here that Ismail awami (Furrough ul Ihilk) remained Chief of Police, and darhang Khosrowdad remained head of the Gendarmerie. vNOLCt R XA r 'ICH3 . Cn arrival in Shiraz in February, Sipahbod Shabbakhti, apparently acting on orders from Tehran, made it known to his officers that intercourse with the British would be frowned on, and while he remained 0.0.C. officers of the British Liaison Mission experienced some difficulty in their personal relation ships with Persian officers. Otherwise, the a ersian authorities were friendly, and British and ersian civilians mixed together more than usual. hen aw am ul ulk and General Jehanb&amp;ni appeared on the scene in August, the last restraints were swept away, and for the remainder of the year military and civilian relationships were very cordial. Oft Oept. 03rd. the Minister of :*r, who wae visitim: Shi ran, and General Jehanbani, gave a big reception In celebration of Persia’s declaration of war arainst Gern-any. P 'HSIAN PUBLIC OPINION. During the whole of the year, the people of Pars were pre occupied with their own troubles, and these, rat^r than any outside events, set the tone of public opinion, htle the conviction steadily grew that the defeat of Germany was only a question of time, the Allies, and in particular Great nricain, continued to be blamed for ihe troubles of * he country. A record harvest, and the restoration of a certain degree of security in the countryside in the autumn, together with hopes of an early peacejencouraged by the Allied victories, did however do some thing to make the people better disposed towards the end of the year. There was no indication, at the end of the year, that the people of Shiraz had learnt any lesson from the sufferings they had been through. These could so easily be attributed to the war in general and the Allied occupation in particular, that it seems to have occurred to no one that there might be something wrong with a social and economic system which hw.a failed to stand up to the shocks acUiuistereo to it. Instead of a determination to reform and improve when the chance comes, there was only a spirit of helplessness, coloured by the ho^e th*t the Allies would see them through; and, on the part of a growing number, a vague nostalgia for the good old days of Kesa bhah which, as time passes, take on a more rosy hue. Iran’s declaration of war passed almost unnoticed in Ahiraz and the declaration regarding Iran’s independence made at the Tehran conference, made a stronger impression on a people w v &gt;o re-.-^rd t^eir freedom as resting, not on a determination to preserve it themselves, but on the charity or self-interest of she great oowera. It cannot be said, however, that Hussia’s participation in the declaration altogether dispelled the traditional fear of that country, and 'ussophobi a, though weakened, still remained strong. The Public Relations aectiLn of if .^.Consulate, which was opened at the end of 1942, remained in operation all through 1943, and met with an increasing measure o^ success. Ibis success is, however, more probably to be regarded as an indication of the way the wind was blowing, than as the fruit of the propaganda efforts expended, and there is no evidence that British propaganda in Tars Aid much to bring public opinion over to the allied side. Nevertheless, the Reading Room and the publicity material distributed did useful work in providing a focus for those w*o were already well disposed, and no doiibt helped the latter to (spread among.•..2 Raf*imjan 6th wki 7th January.

For the spring he took up his residence at Bayan, some five miles from the town, where he lead a quiet life partly on the advice of his medical attendant and partly from Most of the administrative posts in the state are still held by members of the Subah family. (b) Shaikh Abdullah as Salim as Subah, C.I.E., has remained President of the Advisory Council but has paid (c) Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak al Khalifah has remained Director of Public Security and Governor of Kuwait Town. 3o far he has proved a very progressive and capable man. (dj Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir retained his appointments as Chief Judge and Head of the Education Department. (e) The post of President of the Municipality remained (f) shaikh Fahad as Salim as Subah retained his appoint ment as Controller of Finance and Food Supplies. He married the daughter of Shaikh Saud as Subah on May the 20th. Shaikh Fahad the son of His Highness’immediate predecessor has the misfortune to have had a negress inclination. little attention to affairs of state and nas spent the greater portion of the year living in Failaicha Island. vacantfor a mother and not being of pure Subah blood has been debarred from marrying a lady from that family. However, partly thanxs to his personal influece and partly to the intrigues of the girl’s mother, who had secured a magnificent house on the sea front as a gift for her daughter, and also to a paper signed by His Highness and the leading As Subah that any issue of the marriage will be accepted as pure bbod- ed members of the tribe for matrimonial purposes, tie ancient rule was set aside and His Highness author ised the marriage. (g) ShaiKh Subah as Salim as Subah retained his appointment as Chief of Police. (h) Shaikh Abdulla al Ahmad remained in charge of the Arsenal. (i) Shaiich luhammad al Jabir, Port Director, was relieved of his appointment on the 12th February as he was known to have bean involved in the smuggling of sugar to Iraq. He was succeeded as Port Director by shaikh ubarcuc al Hamad al Mubarak as subah. (j) In January Shaikh Abdulla al Khalifah was present ed with the insignia of a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire; this honour was conferred on his brother the late Shaikh Ali al khalifa, C.I.E., who died of consumption before he could be Invested. Shaikh Abdulla does not hold any administrative appointment. On the 2Drd December 104D he was married to His Highness’ 3rd daughter. (k) Jhaikh Subah an Nasir, the well-to-do member of the family and noted for his acts of insubordination in desert affairs, still resides in the northern4 - frontiers of Kuwait, chiefly among the bedou, and Keeps himself aloof from the Town members of the tribe. POLITIlitL AOKi^rs KELATIQN3 The Bclitical A-genu’s relations with the JhaiKh have remained most cordial. His Highness has display ed willing cooperation in assisting our organisations, such as the Inland Water Transport who have had work to do in Kuwait. xv. uOjal Iplltical . No particular internal event of political importance occurred during the year. As in other parts of the world in 1943 the waverers and doubters in Kuwait fixed, with such finality as they £ ~ e capable of, their rather worthless allegiance to the Allied cause. ( b ) Irade . a full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confidential publication. (c) Justoms . There have been no further increases in the Ou^stoms Import Juty v/hich has remained at 6^ ad valorem. On the 31st October the Kuwait Government issued an 'Alan' prohibiting the export of cotton piecegoods to Saudi Arabia since a separate quota has been fixed ior that country. Another ’’Alan* was Issued on the &lt;JlSo jeoeraber according to which sheep and goats from Saudi Arabia and/or Persia are liable to 8^ Customs duty on the estimated value. This immediately causeda rise of 20% in the cost of mutton. (^) -^edical . (i) Dr. L.Px. jcudder, M.D. f assisted by* Dr.J.H.Nyicerk and Dr. Kut2i c.Orouse have continued the fine medical work of the Arabian Mission.In April a new X-Ray apparatus was installed in the Mission Hospital. This is the only X-Ray installation in Kuwait, (ii) The Kuwait Government Medical Establishment has remained unchanged and the medical officers have done very good worK. Both the State Dispensaries are well kept. The construction of the State Hospital is still at a stand-still owing to the lack of building materials. Posts c Telegraphs , (i) The telegraph line between Kuwait and Zubair which was interrupted during the Iraqi trouble in May 1941 has been repaired by the Indian Post© and Telegraphs Department and is now in working order. One reason for not working it has succeeded another. The arrival of a telegraphist from India is now awaited before it can function. \ii) Messrs lable &amp; Wireless,limited,continued to operate their wireless telegraphy station efficiently. Their excellent automatic telephone system installed in the town continued to give satisfaction. It was opened in February 1942 with 21 subscribers; by June 1943 there v/ere 93, and there are now 100 more applicants for telephones for whom instruments are not available. (*) Education . On the Dnd July the Kuwait Government dispensed with the services of Abdul Latif shamlan, the Director of Education and Ali Haikal assumed charge ol the post. Mr. F.J.Wakelin, Educational Adviser has taken a keen interest in Kuwait education and paid two visits here. He has organised the schools under the supervision of 13 Egyptian teachers. (g) General. An event worthy of mention was the He jpil^riinage. The removal of the Persian Governiaent f s resurictions on the pilgrimage resulted in an explosion of pent-up religious fervour this year, Estimating roughly f about 1 v J 00 Persian pilgrims travelled via Kuwait — a severe drain on the town’s food supplies. Jhe majority of them were well supplied with funds, bringing into Kuwait an estimated sum of £ 3,000,000, the release of which, forced up the cost of all but mere necessities, whose prices are controlled. The motor-car market in Kuwait was particularly affected . th? a - ;e influx of pilgrims all seeking transport and the prices of cars reached fantastic heights. The cost of a seat in a lorry to the Holy Places and back, which was only 3.1,200/- last year, reached 13.5,000/- year. sik oi the costly vehicles broke down on w. o ’ay, but they all reached Kecca in vehicles sent to their aid by King Ibn 3aud and were in time to perform the Haj. v. j&amp; jAhr iirih ;rs The nomads have not been so fortunate as the inhabit ants of Kuwait whose incomes have mostly Kept pace Inflation. ’he Bedouin here rely on a supplji of second-hand American woollen clothes, Indian cotton pieoegoods and cheap staple commodities, which are now either too expensive or not available. For these they used to exchange their own high quality wool.ghi, and meat on the hoof which could be released for export. Before the Bedouin can buy their grain, it must pass through several agencies responsible for putting up the price, not the least of them being the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. They are tending therefore, more and more, to eat their own food products which, however good in quality, do notinolude any grain and are insufficient in quantity. Those bedouin other than the happy owners of flocks are entirely without means of subsistence other than charity, Many are now encamped round the town and live by begging from house to house, an additional burden on the town’s food supplies. Lt-Col. H.R.P. Dickson, Acting General superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company, who is in very close touch with the Bedouin of Kuwait and Kast Saudi Arabia,is convinced that the mortality rate among children and the aged from Tuberculosis and Phthisis, aggravated by under-nourishment, is about 60 a, VI. FOREIGN INTKkiS-STS (a) Saudi Arabia . Relations with the Saudi Kingdom have remained friendly. In March some concern was caused by a report, subsequently confirmed as a ’’’canard*, that King Ibn 3aud had forbidden the export from his territory of desert products to Kuwait. (b) Iraq . The official attitude of Kuwait to Iraq is perhaps best described as one of profound distrust. It seems nevertheless to be tempered by the self- knowledge that, given the opportunity, Kuwaitis are capable of many of the iniquities attributed to Iraqis VII. DATS GARDENS The situation was as follows at the end of the year Bashlyah . This case was heard in Basra and the verdict was given in favour of the defendants. An appeal has been lodged in Baghdad by His Highness* advocate and the date of hearing is fixed for 18th January 1944. There seems little hope that the casewill succeed on appeal or on reference to the Court of Cassation should such a reference be necessary and considered desirable. (b) Faddapiiyah . This case finally reached the Court of Cassation, the highest court in Iraq which confirmed the judgement of the Court of Appeal in the Shaikh of favour. It is hoped that the matter is now, This case was tried by Judge Good but no has so far been given as the Basra Judge is receipt of Fao maps from the Baghdad Survey I/.. CQJT OF LIVING Kuwait’s closed. (c) Fao . decision awaiting Office. The large profits made by Kuwait merchants within the last few years, the restrictions by quotas and control of prices of trade in foodstuffs, and the impossibility of obtaining for trade the majority of pre-war goods have resulted in accumulations of capital feverishly seeking for outlets. The immediate result of the imposition of restrictions by India on any commodity was speculative buying in which prices reached fantastic heights. Indian cigarettes rose from Ha.8 to is.25/- per tin, cement from as. 18/- to .3.25/- per bag.

WAR WORK The barge re-asserably scheme was abandoned in May by barges. Production was then held up due to lack of launching space. The project was reopened in December by the Inland Water Transport. The barges are shipped from America in pieces. On the 24th December a consign ment of 1219 packages (containing K.I).Barges) was received. A sum of Ks* 95,016-5-6 was subscribed to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. Numerous visits were paid to Kuwait territory by planes of the R.A.F. and hundreds flew over head on their law ful occasions. There were also a number of cases of The company operated on a 'closed down' basis during the year retaining in Kuwait a European staff of only two. Nevertheless as the main source of availability of mechanical equipment (from stoves and ice-raachines to lathes) and of efficient engineering staff, it has rendered valuable assistance to Kuwait in supplying to the limit of its capacity, these scarce commodities. main sufferers were those on fixed salaries the Persian Gulf Service Command after completing S5 XII. ROYAL AIR FORCE XIII.KUWAIT OIL CQPPANYIn this way local flour mills, water pumps and a host of minor equipment have been *ept going when, without such help they would have ceased to function;thus add ing to the hardship already caused by strained resources here as in the rest of the world. A Mission of the Petroleum Hesources Corporation of America headed by Mr. Oegolyer visited Kuwait in December with the purpose of reviewing the petroleum resources of the Middle hast. .:XV. IMPERIAL BANK OF IKhM The business of the Baiu: during the year 1945 has continued to maice satisfactory progress in spite of restrictions in supplies of goods from abroad. The merchants coiuinunity, however, tase full advantage of any offers of goods made to them from India, the United Kingdom, the United States and Switzerland, provided currency and export difficulties are overcome. The Bank is frequently used as an intermediary in opening credits in these countries. In the case of the United States and Switzerland dollar exchange is required as a purchas ing medium but this currency is almost unobtainable in the Kuwait marKet. A moderate supply of dollars is occasionally transferred from Iran by merchants who have rial funds available there. The number of current accounts opened curing the year have increased from about 120 to 160 and included in these figures are the majority of the merchants and traders to whom a current account is lively to be of advantage. An interesting point is that the deposits arising from these current accounts have increased from approximately i. 17,80,000 to Ka.65,30,000 during the course of the year. This large figure, while* - 11 - evidencing the confidence of the community in the Bank, probably shows that merchants find more difficulty in employing their money and that smaller stocks of goods are held by them. The Kuwait Government is o^course the largest holder of stocks of sugar, cereals, etc. Rates of exchange fluctuated widely during the year.The lowest point touched by the dinar was hs. ll/l/- and the highest s.13/4/-. Now that war risK races of insurance by air have been reduced, the import or export of notes from and to India is facilitated and this wide fluctua tion is unlikely to repeat itself. !iile the townspeople are now quite accustomed to the use of rupee notes there is a persistent demand for rupee coin for purchases from the beduin and for chari table gifts, a demand which the Banx is unable wholly to satisfy. The market has benefited considerably from large supplies of small denominations of rupee notes and moderate supplies of nicKel coin imported by the Bank from India. The Financial Department and other state departments maintain accounts with the Bank, and the former have purchased from time to time considerable amounts of foreign exchange in payment of their imports of cereals. viDiroRp The number of visitors greatly Increased this year, and the majority stayed or had meals at the Agency.

A ND III; AL K-’APIF^H FAMILY (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Salnan bin *Isa al Khalifah was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire on the 1st of January 1943 and was formally invested with the insignia of a Knight Commander on the 6th of December by the Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at a formal ceremony which took place at the Palace Manama, His Highness has followed the political events of the year end the progress of the Allied Forces in all the theatres of war with the closest attention. He has granted without question and with commendable promptitude every request for assistance which the course of the v/ar necessitated. His Highness has played a leading part in the govern ment of his country end has particularly interested himself in the difficult problem of maintaining adequate supplies of cereals. (b) Shaikh Mohamad bin 'Isa and Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa, the uncles of the Ruler, have played a less prominent part in affairs than might have been expected. The first-named was absent from Bahrain for a considerable part of the period under review and Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa carried out his various functions as President of the Manama Baladiya and President of the Fduc tion Department with his usual ability. t With the exception of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamad who has been Commandant of the State Police throughout the year,The • • • • - 3 - the remaining members of the Ruling Family have done little to attract attention. 4.

There was an increase in thefts of bicycles, clothes and foodstuffs. Smuggling of foodstuffs such as sugar, cigarettes, etc. for export increased owing to the high prices obtained for these articles outside Bahrain. There was a slight increase in traffic accidents, resulting in four deaths and four serious injuries, ihe Police obtained adequate supplies of clothing and equipment from the Indian Army and are now well provided with clothing. 5. AGRICULTURE An experiment was made to cultivate v/heat during the year under review but the results wero disappointing and very few agriculturists came forward to buy wheat seed for the following season. 6 . MUNICIPALITIES The ■lanama Municipality: The following works were carried out:- Construction of sea road in front of the Government Hospital, 1200 feet long. Surfacing of roads with a mixture of sand and waste crude. Construction of eight shops on Government account for the sale of rationed foodstuffs. Construction of 210 town rubbish containers. In additon to above the Municipality dealt with the routine sanitary and other works.- 4 - VTl) The_. Moharraq Municlr-alitv : The Moharraq Municipality constructed a jetty on the shore for the Military Authorities on the south side of the Manama-Moharraq Road. The Municipality ^ in addition carried out a programme of road widening and surfacing. 7. PUBLIC WORKS With the exception of the construction of a new jail on Jida Island the Public Works Department carried out no works of major importance. 8 . ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT (a) Ggnera^.: Lighting restrictions were cancelled on the 22nd of June with a resultant increase in the revenue which has unfortunately not been as great as could be desired owing to a serious shortage of supplies of electric lamps required to replace normal wastage. Naval and military loads have been increased and it is anticipated that there will be a surplus of approximately Rs.40,000 which will be transferred to ’’Operating Reserve”. The following figures are of interest Connected load on 31 st December 1942 - 694 KW ' ' ' ' ' 1943 - 770 KW Maximum units generated in 1942 - 189 KW 198 KW 622817 - 737472. The Power House generating plant capacity is at present 400 KW and in order to meet future demands a new 200 KW. generating set has been ordered. The rates for electricity were not increased during 1 943 in spite of increased running and maintenance charges due to the rise in the cost of materials and labour. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued but, owing to the scarcity of wiring material, at a reduced rate. Approximately 237 points were added in 1943 as compared with 250 points in 1942 and 450 points in 1941. Telephon e Department : There are now a total of 96 subscribers and the present switchboard is almost fully loaded. It .... '*1943 Total units generated in 1942 ” ' ' ' 1943considerable • • • • It is hoped that a nev; switchboard which has been on order since January of 194-3 will shortly arrive and enable the Department to accept new subscribers. 9. PEARLING IKDUSTRY The number of pearling dhows in operation during the year was much the same as that in 194-2 and the catch was reasonably good. Prices continued to rise on the Bombay market for the medium and inferior grades of pearls but there was only a slight rise in the price of the better quality pearls. This was due to the fact that whereas the low and medium grade pearls find a ready market in India the high grade varieties are normally purchased by dealers on the European and American markets. The centre of the European market has always been in Paris which is for obvious reasons at present closed to nine-tenths of the world and the American market is reported to be particularly dull owing to very few purchases being possible out of income because of the high cost of living in the United States and the inclination of people with considerable private fortunes to invest in Defence and other Government loans rather than in the purchase of luxuries. Generally speaking, as far as Bahrain was concerned, the season can be described as a good one. Actual figures have not yet been worked out by the Bahrain Government but there is no doubt that very considerable business was done during the year, one Indian merchant alone making purchases in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast which amounted to rather more than 20 lacs of rupees. 10. CUSTOMS. Although the amount of imports decreased during 1943, % due in a large measure to export restrictions imposed by the Government of India and shortage of shipping space which made it wellnigh impossible to obtain goods from other sources, the actual income was higher than it had been during any individual year for the last 20 years. The receipts were approximately 14^- lacs which is 5 lacs more than in 1942 and this very(iii) • • • • considerable increase v/as due entirely to the fact that customs duty is calculated on an ad valorem basis and the phenomenal rise in prices resulted in an increase in duty paid. 11.

(iv) Quarantine Station, ifeharraa Assistant Surgeon M.L.A. Steele, I.M.D., continued as Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year.

(b) Bahrain Government Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Ibrahim A 1 Khalifah was appointed a Magistrate in the Court of Small Causes replacing ShaiKh Mohamad bin All A 1 Khalifah who died during the year. 16. EDUCATION (i) Boys 1 Section The work of schools has continued satisfactorily but the number of buildings is still inadequate. Efforts are being made to provide accommodation and obtain additional trained teachers but the absence of building materials due to the war and the extreme difficulty of obtaining teachers has made it impossible for the Bahrain Government to fulfil their object. The demand for a good education for their children by Bahrain parents is due to the fact that they have now come to realise that boys when properly educated obtain more remunerative rests and that girls who have received a good education find the con tracting of a suitable marriage less difficult than their more ignorant • • • •- 9 - ignorant sisters. The extreme difficulty of obtaining materials and masters has much handicapped Mr.Wakelin in his endeavours to improve the standard of knowledge in Bahrain but he is making ^ great efforts to prevent any falling off in the progress that he has so far made and it is safe to say d^.iring the year under review he has more than held his own. Cii) Girls 1 Section The Girls' Section has suffered in much the same way and from the same causes as the Boys' Section. However due largely to the efforts of Mrs.Belgrave, the wife of the Adviser, the schools have been able to maintain a high standard of teaching and it is hoped they will be able to tide over the pre sent difficult times. (ill) Technical Section The Technical School like the other educational institutions has suffered much from lack of adequate instructors and also from the difficulty of obtaining raw materials so necessary for the instruction of the students. The school has been concentrating on turning out fitters and mechanics prin cipally with a view to their future employment with the Bahrain Petroleum Company but it was suggested during the year that they should widen their activities and introduce the study of automobile engineering. The Technical School is a very necessary institution and would with proper instructors and adequate materials be the most important educational establishment in the Persian Gulf but that position will only be achieved when the cessation of hostilities makes it possible to obtain the materials and the instructors.

The following statistics are of interest:- Number of schools in existence on 1st Jan. 43 ' ' opened during 1943 '* students on the rolls on 1.1.43 it it 31.12.43 14 1 2168 2303 Number ....102 Number of teachers on 1 st January 1943 ' ” M ” 31st December 194-3 114 . 17. THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED (I) Chief L ocal Representative ^r. Ward P. Anderson was General Manager and also Chief Local Representative of the Company throughout the year. During the latter half of the year when he paid a visit to the United States Mr. Russell M. Brown, Manager Operations, acted for him as Chief Local Representative and General Manager. (II) -Productio n and Development The total oil production during 1943 v/as 6 , 571,609 barrels being an average of 18,004 barrels a day. The rate of production has been held practically constant at the daily average of 18,000 net barrels and observations of reservoir behaviour under the conditions imposed as a result of the elimination of certain ells for security reasons have indicated satisfactory reservoir performance at current rates of withdrawal. No work of a development nature has been undertaken during the year. No exploratory work was conducted in the Additional Area and a moratorium in respect of the obligations under the agreement was granted dating from December 1 , 1942 , and extending until such time as reasonable normal Company operations can be resumed. (iii) Import of Arabian Crude 01 ] A total of 4,840,42? net U.S. barrels of Arabian Crude oil was imported during 1943 . (iv) Refinery No major new operating facilities were completed during the year under review, but minor alterations and additions to existing equipment were made. Some new pumps were installed at the cracking plants, a new condenser was installed at the Polymer plant to augment the compressed gas condensing capacity, the platform at the C.V.T. r lant was extended, a standby steam pumpV L - 11 - pump 1 as installed at the Distillation UnitSj the sulphur burner at the S0 2 plant was rebuilt and certain alterations were made at the Reformer to increase the capacity of this plant. An 80-ton capacity, steam-get refrigeration plant was designed and built adjacent to the Power Plant. Alterations aud additions were made for the enlargement of the laboratory. Construction was started on new plants for aviation gasoline production, and work was well under way by the end of the year; no operating units were completed. (v) Shirring A new section was added to the existing materials pier to increase the available area for unloading barges at the Sitrah loading terminal. New ethylising facilities are being installed at the Sitrah tank farm to replace existing ethylising facilities at the wharf which have been found to be inadequate. A geological test hole drilled at the wharf was completed as a water well and facilities were installed to provide an emergency water supply for ships calling at Sitrah anchorage. Reservation for extended marine and submarine facilities at Zellaq have been granted to the Company. A total of 70 tankers called for cargo during the year. They lifted a total of approximately:- 4,14,351 tons gasoline 1&gt;95*565 tons kerosine 1,24,369 tons diesel and 44,862 tons fuel oil. 177 ships called for bunkers only. The total tonnage of bunkers lifted was 45,739 tons of diesel oil and 1 , 98,532 tons of fuel oil. (vi) Personnel The regular operations of producing, refining, shipping and service organisations required the employment of the following number of men at the end of the year:- Americans 32 Canadians 23 British 114 Other Europeans 7 British Indians 220 Bahrainis 2,096 Others . Total: 2,844 The • • • •The following number of men were also employed at the Company f s Refinery Expansion Programme for the production of aviation spirits- Americans 197 British Indians 19 Bahrainis and others 2.049 Totals 2,265 This number is expected to increase considerably during the next year. (vii) Royalty t o the Bahrain Government Royalty for the first half of 1943 - Rs. 13 , 29 , 978 . 7.0 Royalty for the second half of 1943 was approximately 45? more than the' first half*s figure. 18.

(iii) Many distinguished officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force visited Bahrain during the year in the course of their official duties. 19. VISITS OF FOREIGN NOTABLES (i) Many distinguished officers of the Allied Forces visited the islands during the period under review.- 13 - 20. VISITS OF ARAD NOTABLES (i) On June 17th the Amirs Mohamad and Mansur, sons of His Majesty King Ibn Saud, arrived at Bahrain accorranied by Shaikh Abdullah Suleiman (Saudi Minister of Finance), Dr.Rashid Mahmud Firawan, and a considerable retinue of servants on their v/ay to India. On June 22nd one of His Majesty King Ibn Saud , s younger sons, Abdul Mohsin, also arrived at Bahrain. He had come to undergo a minor operation at the American Mission Hospital. He left on July 19th. Shaikh Abdul.lah Suleiman came to Bahrain on the 28 th October on his way back from India and the two Amirs Mohamad and Mansur on the 30th September accompanied by Dr.Rashid Mahmud Firawan. The Amir Mansur and Dr.Rashid Mahmud Firawan continued their flight the same day while the Amir Mohamad spent the night at Bahrain as the guest of His highness the Shaikh and left for A1 Khobar the following morning. (ii) Shaikh Khalifah bin Sr id, son of the Ruler of Dubai, arrived at Bahrain on July 31st and left on August 9th. (iii) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, arrived by air on July 20th and left on August 2nd after a fortnights visit to Bahrain. He was followed by his son Saqr on August 8th. (iv) ohaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, arrived on the 6th of May to consult Dr.Harrison of the American Mission Hospital here about his eyes. He left after a stay of a week. 21. LOCaL AFFAIRS (i) With a view to getting into closer touch with the mercantile community and thereby being able to deal more adequately with their problems and at the same time make them acquainted with the difficulties of supply and shipping the Political Agent formed a Committee comprising representatives of the principal business communities. The Committee meet once a week and so far the members have been found to be extremely helpful and co-oper tive. The Bahrain Government is represented on this Committee by the Director of Customs.12 • • • • (ii) The Persian Gulf Fighter Fund which was opened by the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in November 1940 was closed on September the 8th. The appeal had been very well answered both by the Rulers and their subjects and sufficient funds were raised to provide 10 Fighter Aircraft for the Royal Air Force. Bahraini contribution amounted to Rs.2,16,555/4/9, the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms contributed Rs.1,14,112/4/-, and the Shaikh of Qatar and his people Rs.48,175/14/3. 22. ECONOMIC (i) Banking and Currency Trade during the year was dull and the business of the Eastern Bank consisted chiefly of financing the requirements of Companies, the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force, ihe sterling selling rate on London was lsh.6d. per rupee and the selling rate on India fluctuated during the year between par and 1% discount. During the year the Bank imported from Inoia Rs.7C,00,000 in Indian Currency notes. The sales on India amounted to Rs.20, 26 ,745 against Rs. 6 ?, 20,500 for the year 1942. This large decrease is accounted for by the export restrictions in India. (ii) Foodstuffs: In spite of serious difficulties towards the end of the year there was at no time an actual shortage of essential foodstuffs during the period under review either on the Trucial Coast, in Qatar, or in Bahrain. The prices of essential foodstuffs have been closely controlled in Bahrain with the satisfactory result that prices have on the whole been considerably lower than in neighbouring countries. At the beginning of the year each adult was issued with a monthly ration of 20 lbs. of cereals which was made up of 8 lbs. of rice and 12 lbs. of wheat, but owing to the fact that fresh rice supplies were not forthcoming by the end of the year rice had been eliminated from the ration which was then composed ofbut • • • • - 1 ? - 12 lbs. of v/heat, 4 lbs. of flour and 4 lbs. of barley. Sucar 1945 r nas also been rationed at 2-J lbs. per month It is satisfactory to note that stocks of tea, coffee, and dates were sufficient to meet local demands though there was a distinct shortage of certain kinds of piecegoods. Cattle, sheep, goats, ghee, charcoal, fire-wood, potatoes, and fresh fruit have all to be obtained from neigh bouring countries as the vegetation and the climate of the islands are not conducive to cattle-breeding or fruit and potato cultivation. There was a serious shortage of these commodities in the late summer and autumn but the decision of the Government of India to permit the export of an increased quota of tea and sugar from India greatly relieved the situation as it provided local merchants with goods for barter purposes. It has been the policy of the Agency and the Bahrain Government that while the Bahrain Government continue to be the ole importers of essential cereals and sugar, quotas for tea, coffee, ghee, piecegoods and cigarettes are divided among the established importers of these commodities. It is desirable to mention how well the Municipalities of Manamah and Moharraq have co-operated with the Bahrain Government in the issue of ration cards and the distribution of rationed foodstuffs. The ration system is working remarkably well and surprisingly smoothly when it is considered that two- thirds of the population are quite Illiterate. The cereal and sugar rations are considered by local medical authorities to be adequate 1 or the physical needs cf the people but unfortunately many of the poorer members of the community have not the where withal to purchase a full ration with the result that malnutri tion and its attendant bodily disorders is becoming apparent. The continual increase in the prices of essential foodstuffs is a matter for grave concern to the local authorities, and it may well be that if prices continue to rise not only will it be necessary to make further and large increases in war allowances- 16 - but some means of subsidizing food purchases will have to devised in order to keep prices at a sufficiently low level to enable the poorer members of the community who are in the vast majority to make purchases of a sufficiency of cereals and sugar to maintain themselves and their families in adequate physical condition for the manual work by which they earn their livelihood. 23. THE BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION The past year has seen a considerable increase in the number of services operated by this Corporation for whereas at the beginning of the year only 2 flying-boat and one land- plane service were operated weekly in each direction at the end of the year there were 7 flying-boat services and one landplane service in operation weekly in each direction. Towards the end of the period under review the Corporation were, owing to their projected large increase in services, forced to embark on a construction programme and to enter into leases for house property to house the increased personnel to be stationed here. During 1943 the B.O.A.C. planes carried to and from Bahrain 800 passengers and 8,500 kgs. of diplomatic, military and civilian mail. 24. Cable a '. IREL^SS limited The Company^ work has much increased during the period under review and apart from maintaining cable communications with Aden, Karachi, Iraq, and Iran the Company maintained a 24-hour daily service for merchant shipping and an 18-hour daily continuous watch during which 'Direction Finding” bearings were provided for aircraft. Alternative radio links with Iraq, Iran and Aden are also in operation and the Bahrain broadcast which consists of one hour*s broadcast of news and talks and music for listeners in Arabic-speaking countries is transmitted from the Company*s premises. 25. PmOLEUH CONCESSIOIIS Hi'ITED The Company continued their dismantling operations which were designed to make available as quickly as possible their • • • •- 17 - their equipment and personnel for more important war-time projects. By the end of the year the Dukhan field had been closed and only 35 Arab guards remained to guard the Company^ premises. In November the Political Agent concluded an agreement with the Shaikh of Qatar which provided for the continuance of certain facilities during the war and recorded certain financial undertakings entered into by the Company.i. trucial shaikhs (iii) • • • • (i) The following were the ruling Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast throughout the year:- (1) Dubai (2) Sharjah ( 3 ) Abu Dhabi (4) Um al Qaiwain (5) Ajman (6) Ras al Khaimah (7) Kalba Shaikh Sa* id bin Maktum, O.B.E. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid Shaikh Sultan bin Salim Shaikh Hamad bin Sa*id (minor) Regents Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad. (ii) The Shaikhs of* Sharjah and Dubai visited Bahrain during the year and the Shaikh of Ajman visited India. (iii) The Shaikh of Um al Qaiwain married a daughter of the Shaikh of Ajman. (iv) During 1942 there was bad feeling between Sharjah and Kalba owing to the Regent of Kalba^ persistent attempts to settle in Sharjah territory - attempts which hadjpreviously been opnosed by the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Political authorities. On 6th January 1943 the Residency Agent arranged peace between the parties, and, since then, the Regent of Kalba appears to have taken up his abode in Hira where, except for periodic vists to Kalba, he has remained throughout the year. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, a nephew of the Regent, has lived in Kalba and carried on the administration. 2. BRITISH IMTERRSTS (i) Agreements with the Trucial Shaikhs remained as in the past and the general trend amongst the population appears to be ene of increasing friendliness as they become familiar with the presence of the R.A.F. (ii) Mr.B.H.Lermitte' of Petroleum Concessions Limited lived in Dubai from 12th January to 26th March. No exploratory work was undertaken by the Company during the year.traders * • • • • 2 (ill) The Sharjah Air Agreement was renewed for five years with effect from 1st July 1943 and the Dubai Air Agreement for a similar period from 22nd July 1943. The agreements with '■'V Atm Dhabi, Ras al Khaimah and Kalba remained unchanged. 3- LOCAL AFFAIRS (i) During the year there were five air crashed resulting in four deaths. One was at Dhaid on Febnwry 1st when a Blenheim crashed killing three of the occupants including It. the Hon'ble A.B. Hailey Officer Commanding the R.A.F. Levies at Sharjah. On the 14th of February a Wellington crashed near Dhidna causing the death of one of the crew. In July a Blenheim crashed near Um al Qaiwaln and in December a Blenheim crashed on the Sharjah beach but there were no casualties. In addition there have been several minor mishaps.near the Sharjah landing ground. (ii) A demonstration of bombing and machine gun practice followed by a fire-work display, and a cinema performance with an Arabic commentary was given on 2nd May by the R.A.F. in the presence of Air Commodore G.L. Carter, D.S.O., D.F.C. It was attended by nearly all the Trucial Coast Shaikhs and their families, some of the Al Bu Sharais Shaikhs of Buraimi, and by the elite of Dubai and Sharjah. Rs.78,118/- was collected for the Pers i_an Gulf Fighter Fund on the occasion. (ili) Intensive anti-locust measures were undertaken during the year under the supervision of Mr. D. Vesey Fitzgerald and a serious outbreak was probably averted by timely action. No opposition was experienced from the Bedouinalthough the Chief of the Ban! Qitab, in whose territory no operations had however to be carried out, sent threatening messages through indirect channels, 4, ECONOMIC (i) Dubai merchants made very large profits in the earlier part of the year but trade restrictions, the imposition of quotas, and export prohibitions from India considerably restricted7 . • • • • - 3 - (try traders* opportunities for money-making in the latter half of the year. (ii) Motor transport on the Trucial Coast had become critical by the end of the year and many cars and lorries had to be taken off the road for want of spare parts. (iii) Special measures were taken during the year to fix the prices of cereals and arrange for their equitable distri bution. Two Companies were formed in Dubai and Sharjah to handle the distribution of cereals and by t he end of the year the scheme was working well. (iv) The pearling season was unusually successful this year, the catch being bought at approximately three times the price paid last year. A new departure was the purchase by Shaikh Rashid bin Sa* id of Dubai of Rs.15,00,000 worth of pearls and by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of Rs.?0,000 worth. 5. SECURITY There was some raiding by Awamir in June in Dubai territory, in which camels were stolen but punitive parties from Dubai killed five Awamir, wounded one, and captured three more as well as ninety camels. About the same time five more of the Awamir were killed in clashes with the Khawatir. Shaikh Rashid bin Sa*id of Dubai visited Buraimi in July and the Shaikh of the Awamir asked pardon for his tribesmen’s offences, offered a guarantee of non-aggression against Dubai, and agreed to forego the blood rights for the five Awamir killed. The captured camels were returned by both sides, Shaikh Rashid received deputations from all the tribes between Buraimi and Dhank. The Awamir have not since raided in the Trucial Oman. There was, however, some minor raiding by A1 Bu Khail outlaws of the Manasir. 6. SHIPPING During the year 22 steamers called at Dubai and 6 called at Sharjah.4 / 7. MEDICAL Malaria was unusually severe in October and November and many deaths are believed to have occurred. The usual out break of smallpox occurred in December. 8. POPULATION Some idea of the present population of the Trucial Coast has been acquired through the issue of ration cards. After due deductions have been made for the invariable exaggerations which the local people make when describing their families and dependants for rationing purposes it is probable that the population of the following towns is as recorded below:- Sharjah 15,000 Ras al Khaimah .... 5»0°0 Um al Qaiwain .... 5&gt;00° Ajman 4,000.

Saiyid Abbas bin Faisal waa Director of the Public Health Department throughout the year. Anti-malarial measures were his chief activity but he himself contracted this fever and had to convalesce in India. Statistics also show an increase of 135 cases, from 1144 in 1942 to 1279 in 1943. During the Summer a small pox epidemic broke out in Muscat, S&amp;lalah and Masirah. 222 cases were removed to segrega tion camps and over 4000 people were vaccinated. (b) Agency Hoapital. The Hospital was open throughout the year. Figures of attendance are t- Outdoor - ( New cases 4,734 ( Old cases 6,686 Indoor - Admissions 108 Major operations 11 Minor operations . 28.page 3 The reduction in tho nuaber of outdoor cases is due to the large nuaber of coolies employed on the South Arabian Air Route. Malaria, eye infections and venereal diseases are still the stain problems. (e) Quarantine. Small pox was again prevalent on the Batinah Coast and a number of cases found their way into the towns of Matrah ana muscat causing a mild epidemic. Stringent measures were taken and the epidemic was soon controlled. Vaccinations were carried out in headquarters but there was difficulty in obtain ing fresh lymph and there was not enough to send a vaccinator to the coastal towns. There were no other infectious diseases. HI* POLITICAL SITU;.TiOM. (a) Tribal . affray, in April 1943, between the people of Ibri aid the Beni Ghafir, casualties amounted to 67 killed and 26 wounded, the Beni Ghafir having considerably the better of the exchanges. Amongst the killed were the son ana the nephew of the Sheikh of Hamran and Ahmed bin Said, brother of the Qadhi of Sohar. The cause of the trouble was a series of petty thefts conmitted by each side against the other. The dispute was finally settled by the mediation of Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, and Sheikh Sulaiman of the Jebcl Akhdar. In early January the tribal leaders assembled at Qabail to discuss the restrictions imposed by the Muscat Governnent on the export of rice from Muscat to Oman. Tho meeting decided that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al liarthi should represent the grievances of the tribesmen to the Muscat Government and, if these were not removed, the Treaty of Sib, 1920, should be denounced. Actually, Sheikh Mohammad bin Isa came to Muscat on his father's behalf and the negotiations ended satisfactorily It was recognised that the lack of rice was not the fault of the Muscat Government and a tribal agent was appointed to Muscat to purchase the □manic 1 share of wheat and barley. In June 1943, Saiyid Mohammed bin Hilal, wall of Kustaq and the last relative of tho Muscat Ruling Family remaining in an official position in tribal territory, was dismissed by the Imam. (b) Local . heath of &lt;.aii of Boshar. The death of the Wall of Boshar, Sheikh All bin Abdullah al Khalili occurred suddenly in somewhat suspicious circumstances on the 24th of April. He had been visiting the Wall of Matrah, Ismail Khalil al .assasi, with whom he drank a glass of sherbet and just after he left the house he fell dead in the road. His body was examined by the Agency Surgeon and by Dr. Thoms of the American Mission Hospital, both of whom reported that death was due to heart failure. Relatives however suspected poison. Though the late Wall was the brother of the Imam of Oman he was a loyal and valued servant of the Sultan of Muscat. The latter directed that he should be succeeded as Wall by hispage 4 son) HiXal bin All, who however refused the offer and went instead to see his uncle, the Imam. ffhjLJfali of Birka. The Wall of Blrka, Saiyid Mahmud bin Muhammad bin Turki, uncle of the Sultan, was dismissed from his post in May 1943. The complaints against him were mainly of peculation and a committee was appointed to look into them. By the end of the year, no decision hfy i been reached and it seemed fairly obvious to the ordinary observer that Saiyid Mahmud was under no apprehension that he would ever be required to refund his ill-gotten spoils. „ , ^ Chief )adhi of Muscat . Shaikh Isa bin Saxeh, the Chief Qadhi of Muscat died on the 19th May from cerebral malaria. He was succeeded by Shaikh Saif bin Hamad Alaghbari. mm* (i) The following table gives the comparative values of imports and exports during the last three years lagftgkfrr Exports. 1940- 41 3s.46,28,977 1941- 42 fis. 63,12,403 1942- 43 &amp;.63,40,792 it.30,22,170 fe.38,68,228 *.81,08,976 The increase in the import figures is due to increased prices and not quantities and the following table shows the average price per package t- Year. is 1940- 41 8s. 8/8/- 1941- 42 to.14/4/- 1942- 43 *.34/3/- The increase in the value of exports was due to the enhanced demand for and export price of dates.

Over 60% of the exports was indigenous i.e. wet and dry dates y salted fish, sardines and fish manure. The remaining 40% was transit trade. (ii) The exchange rate of the Maria Theresa dollar, the local currency, appreciated steadily during the year, from 200 to 260 rupees to 100 dollars. In pre-war days the M.T. dollar and the rupee were approximately at par. The reasons for the present variation are (a) the increased value of the silver content of the dollar vis a vie that of the rupee (b) scarcity due partly to hoarding but mainly to (i) increased demand from tiie interior consequent on the high export price of dates (ii) restrictions on dollar export from Aden and (iii) demand for dollars along the South Arabian Air Route. It is of interest to note that the somewhat debased dollar minted for the use of the Allied Forces in East Africa has no currency locally. His Highness the Sultan can spot one almost at a glance 2 v. XHE BOOTH ARABIAN AIR ROUTE. The three aerodromes in the Muscat State viz. at Salalah, Has al Hadd and Masirah, wore in operation through^ out the year. Masirah expanded rapidly and is now the largest. VI. FBEINCH IHTERESTS . The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. VII. MISSIONARY WORK . The American Mission under the charge of Rev. and Mrs. Dykstra continued their work throughout the year. Dr. W.W* Thoms remained in charge of the medical side of the work at Mat rah.

S.S. H Dahpu rt anchored in about five fathoms in Muscat harbour at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 28th June. At 08.46 a.m. a tremendous explosion occurred in No.3 hold of the ship and her stern sank rapidly to the harbour bed. The ship was anchored at 2$ cable lengths from the shore and the force of the explosion was such that a piece of twisted iron, about two feet long and one foot thick, was hurled over the Agency into the tennis court behind and another large piece hit the verandah of the Treasury Officer’s house on the sea front.

Hie Highness the Sultan resided at Dhofar up to the 30th May, when he left for India by United States Army Air Transport Corps plane. He returned to Dhofar in July. His Highness came to Muscat on the 19th October 1943 and remained there till the end of the year. This was His Highness 1 first visit to his capital for over a yoar. Although he complained to the Political Agent that he felt like a prisoner, towards the end of hie stay he began to move about quite freely and attended a number of formal functions. He also dined and played tennis informally more than once at the Agency and accepted invitations to Knglish-style dinner parties from the Agency doctor, his Military Adviser and the American Mission. Hie Highness is still a young man and welcomes relief from the cares of office. At the same time, he can bo a quick and businesslike worker and this visit enabled the new Political Agent not only to establish immediate contact but also to settle a number of pressing problems. ^ The ex-Viceroy, His Excellency Lord Linlithgow, presented a Sindhi stud bull to His Highness as a farewell gift. It has been sent to Salalah. (b) Salvid Shj riiab bin Faisal . He continued to act as Minister for External Affairs throughout the year. ^ s Besides his own work, he took an interest in internal aifairs and twice toured the Batinah Coast in connection with the new experiment of growing wheat. On both occasions the Director-General of Customs accompanied him. &lt;C) gai/iq bin Fftlsai, the ex-Sultan, is no. living in Bombay.

Saivid Fahr bin Tairair was at the Mayo College, Ajmere throughout the year. He has earnt satisfactory reports and it is Hie Highness* intention, as expressed verbally, that he should complete his diploma course there. MUNICIPAL AFFAIBS. If it were not for petty intrigues, the Municipality would not be noticeable and as an experiment in local self- government, it is a definite failure. page 7~ 7 - ill.

Bs&amp;ftcaal* Only nine stealers from India and nine from Persian Gulf ports called during the year. The sinking of the 'Dahpu” was upsetting and owing to the most extraordinary lack of co-operation between the British-India Steam Navigation Company's agents, the Post Office and the Sea Transport Officer in Karachi, Muscat was without mails from that port for over five months. The Agency launch was out of action for most of the year. There is no car for the Political Agent nor can he afford to purchase one, as second-hand cars (without spares) at fantastic prices are only available. VI. P2MSE. Mohammad Jawad Darweah was in charge of the Police force throughout the year. VII. DSFSHCE . Captain/Temporary Major L.B. Hirst, 10th Gurkha Rifles, acted as Military Adviser to the Muscat Government throughout the year. ^ ' A copy of his report to His Highness the Sultan is attached and the account of his administrative difficulties could apply equally well to the state of affairs throughout the civil population. It will be noticed that the Political Agent is referred to as the Consul. This is a political nicelty which His Highness takes very seriously. A Coast-Watching scheme is in operation but it is entirely confined to local resources and is therefore very limited in scope. Harbour defences consist of a 3-pdr. gun in Mirani Fort. It is intended to augment them with the 12-pdr. from the *Dahpu M , when mended. page 8 .....page 9 ~ s — VIII. STm FIKANCSS . Revenue for the year 1943 was as.19,60,143-2-0 against as.7,44,000 budgeted and expenditure fe.7,26,500 against as.6,73,460 budgeted. The increase in receipts was mainly from Customs duties and since imports were less in quantity, these figures give an excellent indication of the increased prices of imported goods. The Muscat Government is not alone in profiting out of the War and it now has a reserve of about 24 lakhs. The above figures do not include those for the valu able province of Dhofar, which the Sultan keeps strictly to himself. The administration is also entirely in his hands. The following His Majesty^ Ships visited Muscat during the year i- 1) H.M.A.S. 'Launceston' of the Royal Australian Navy, corvette, and four motor launches, between 13th and 14th May. 2) H.M.S. 'Capetown', on the 29th July. 3) H.M.I.S. 'Impala', on the 9th October. 4) H.M.S. 'Seabelle', on the 29th November, bringing the Hon'ble the Political Resident, accompanied by Mr. T.E. Rogers, Vice Consul, Bunder Abbas, on a visit. X. ANTI-LOCUST OPERATIONS . Mr. Maxwell Darling of the Middle Hast Anti-Locust Mission arrived from Sharjah on the 1st January 1943 and returned the next day. The Indian Anti-Locust Mission visited the neighbour hood of Quriyat and the Batinah Coast and found no appreci able traces of breeding. Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald, Locust Officer, visited the Qara Hills (Salalah) during October. There were no signs of breeding there. XI. QENKRAL . Apart from work directly connected with the War, the main labour of the Agency has been endeavouring to maintain some flow of essential civil supplies and to stop profiteer ing* At one time, food grains presented unusual difficulty and at the end of November Muscat was down to its last five tons of wheat and barley, (sufficient for only a few hours). At the same time, the internal price of dates had risen steeply and urgent and drastic measures were required before it was reduced. It is not too much to say that towards the end of the year the poorer classes were very near to famine conditions.S-W ,,.4 PVR I. BRITISH AGENT. Mr. H.M.

Gwadur obtains its main imports from Karachi and these are augmented to a certain extent by supplies from Mekran. Tho chief export is dried fish to Ceylon. Figures of Imports and Exports are included in those for Muscat. IV. I&amp;B. WffCtgJfQ. A Coast-Watching patrol of one Jemalar and 8 men was introduced in May. They cover from Sur to Pishkan. V. COMMUNICATIONS. Headquarters, Sind District, established a wireless party at Gwadur on the 3rd August primarily for sending coast watching reports. This station works with Karachi only. vi. posts and IgUBBAEBS - There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Gwadur under the Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle. Owing to lack of sea communications no post was delivered in Gwadur for the first few months of the year. In June however it was arranged that mails should come by lorry from Quetta to Pasni and thence by camel to Gwadur. The telegraph line to Gwadur has also been continually Interrupted and up to April all telegrams from Gwadur had to be sent to Pasni by camel for onward transmission by wireless. This station also broke down in April and telegrams were then despatched through the British Overseas Airways Corporation's station at Jiwanl. Since Headquarters, Sind District established their wireless station, it has been possible to telegraph Gwadur via Karachi. VII. LOCUST OPERATIONS . The Baluchistan Locust Department have a Locust Assistant stationed at Gwadur ,and tho British Agent acts as Tahsil Locust Officer. There was a thin swarm of dark-pink locusts in the third week of January, which came from the North and settled at Ganx and Pishkan. page 10In July and August swarms Increased. Hand pickings amounted to between 4660 - 6000 per square mileSpecial arrangements had to be made by the Government of India, and His Highness the Sultan gave his permission for the use of Soviet aircraft based at Jiwani and Indian troops. The civil population also assisted, receiving from 2-4 annas per 100 locusts picked. VIII. SMALL POX . Ho small pox was reported during the year under report. The aerodrome| originally built for Imperial Airways, is now unserviceable. x. ssiPPUE- The British India Steam Navigation Company^ service has entirely ceased and trade with India is carried by dhow. Sd.R.D.Metcalf 0 . Political Agent, Muscat.REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY FOR THE YEAR 1943. (D MUSCAT DEFENCES . The condition of the local defences of Muscat and Matrah are excellent. No major repairs have been made nor are any required to the permanent defensive works such as forts, town walls etc. This is fortunate as, had any been required they Wol Tif have toeen *fflpo»Bifcle to carry out as cement is almost unobtainable and there have been no contractors in Muscat during the last year. Practically all the carpenters and masons are employed at Has al Hadd and Masirah. Minor repairs are required to Mirani Fort and Bait-al-FalaiJ. ^ . ,. outer defences of Bait-al-FalaiJ have been completely rebuilt and the line considerably shortened. This was deemed necessary owing to the difficulties of communication. The defensive arrangements for the protection of Bait-al-Falaij and the approaches to Matrah and Muscat from the Batinah and Oman are now based more on the fire power of automatic weapons and artillery rather than on man-power as was previously the case. in addition to the 2.76 and two 3-pdr. guns at Bait-al- ^alaij we now have a 12-pdr. gun which was salvaged from s.s. uahpu . This gun is in the process of being mounted but awaits the services of a gunnery export whom the naval authorities have kindly promised to send down. (2) BATINAH COAST . It has not been possible to carry out a tour of the coast since November 1942 owing to the lack of spare parts and tyres for lorries and to the fact that the launch was wrecked early in the year. (3) MU NCH . This continued to give good service until March. During a heavy ^himal in this month she broke her moorings in Muscat Bay arid tabued ashore at the Consulate steps. She re m ained here throughout three tides when she was finally floated off between two lighters. I took all steps to lighten her during the storm but heavy seas carried away her upper work completely. In addition she was badly holed on both sides of the hull. This was repaired by the end of June but It was not until September that I was able to get any carpenters to carry out the real work of reconstruction. There has been practically no wood avail able here for the past year and the work has been difficult, however the work was completed by the 26th November, the only work now remaining is the fitting of the sails. She will be in service again by December. (4) WIK&amp;gSS. Please refer to my report on 1942. Nothing further can be done until expert assistance can be obtained. In my last report I statoci that four of the seven generators cracked petrol tanks. Two of these have now been made serviceable making a total in all of five. (6) acam . The Force has been between 10 and 26 under strength during the year. Desertions have been very little above pre-war years and lov/or than 1942$ unfortunately this year practically no recruits have come in. This is due to the high cost ofpago 3 ... •. - 2 - U enorrooufi decrease in the value of the rupee and balsa which) combined) give a 700% increase on we-War prices coupled with the fact that coolies at Uaairah and rae al Hadd and H.A.F. Levies at Sharjah and other places draw very much better pay and, in the case of the R.A.F. Levies, much better rations than is the case here. The complete absence of any clothing due to our 1042 clotning over-carrying an ^ 1&amp;43 clothing not arriving is also a contributory factor* ^ It is impossible for sepoys to support a family on their pay at the present high cost of food but should the suggested arrangements for the supply of rations to sepoy's families at P ric ® bo possible I consider that service in the Infantry Wxll bocomo a much more attractive proposition than it is at present# There has been one promotion to Jemadar during the current year* This is B.H.M. Lashkaran, a Muscat born Baluchi. He has turned out very satisfactorily and has taken over the Machine Gunners who were originally under Jemalar Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur who proceeded on a Police Course in India in 1942 and is now doing an attachment with the Zhob Militia. Jemadar Allah Lad has been promoted to Subedar (I.A.) and focal Subedar Major and Jemadar Hass an Gul to Local Subedar. (6) mmm- ^ *. F? 8 £® neral standard of training ie, in my opinion, good whan taking into consideration the very low standard of educa tion of the men available* Practically none of the men could read or write and consequently any learning from Army Manuals is out of the question* I have trained instructors for use in a school but I have been defeated by the impossibility of obtaining writing materials, even slates. I have however manage a to train all signallers, a number of machine gunners and gunners, all Havildar Majors and a number of N*C*0 9 e to read and write. It is hoped to carry on with this and eventu ally make a simple educational examination compulsory for promotion beyond Paid Lance Naik. The new recruit training period of 12 weeks instead of 21 has been found to be quite sufficient. After 12 weeks men appear to develop more rapidly if put on ordinary duty with their company. The Training Camp which it was hoped to hold early in tne year was Impossible owing to the lack of tentage and transport. This has been replaced by schemes covering several days and during the cooler weather men go out for three or four days at a time moving on “Hard Scale' 1 without tentage etc. Normal Individual and Collective training has been carried out and Cadre Courses held. Signal lar»«- w , ff® U P t0 I,A * Standard in Flag but a few are still oolow in helio and Lamp# This has been due to shortage of equipment. This has now been received and it is hoped to raise standard. Jemadar Ahmed Sher, in charge of the gunners, is a Trained Army Signalling Instructor and superintends the work of the Signal Havildar.page 4 .. •.. ACMJULiao Bxcollent, owing to abortage of ammunition firix^ practices have had to be cut down but several practices have been carried out both guns alone and working with Infantry. The guns are now carried by lorry. MasMng frung* Good. Jemadar Lashkaran being new to this work took some time to find his feet but is now doing very well. He was fortunate in that he lias four good and experienced M.G. N.C.O's under him, all of whom are capable of controlling the M.G. Platoon. Training has been carried out with g.G. on pack and in tf.T. The results of Range and Field Practices have been very good. Several schemes both in Mountain and Open Warfare have been carried out using live ammunition with troops. It has been found necessary to increase the safety limit when giving over head covering fire and the five-degree safety limit when giving flanking fire owing to the state of barrels and tripods. All guns are overdue for an Arsenal overhaul. Weapon Training. The annual course has produced good results but the L.K.G# results were not good enough. Steps are being taken to rectify this. All men, other than recruits under training have carried out Grenade Training and a short period of Anti- Aircraft Training. This was reduced as not being essential. All officers and men armed with the pistol have fired the course as laid down for the Indian Army. There were only three failures. (?) IflgaBg and clothing. It is not proposed to deal with this in detail here as Your Highness is fully aware of the situation as is H.B.M. *8 Consul to whom I have addressed many letters on the subject. Equipment is good. A few items of our indents still have to be delivered but clothing (shirts and shorts) is non-existent. We have had none whatsoever since 1941. Men now parade in what few clothes, literally 'rags', they them selves possess. A bale of Jerseys which arrived here in October had been cut open and on arrival only throe remained. This is most unfortunate Just at the beginning of the cold weather. No cloth in sufficient quantity is obtainable locally and it is, literally, a matter of a few months before the men are naked unless the 1942 clothing which overcarried in April 1943 or the 1943 clothing is received.page 5 (e) /wnaxm- 5.A.A. expended in practice since Januaxnr 1943 is as follows I- . .303 Ball .*• ... 25,842 •303 Blank ... ... 432 .303 Tracer ••• ...

Nil The R.A.F., Muscat had some 30,000 rounds of .303 Ball which was time-barred for use in R.A.F. machine gums and it was proposed to ’dump* it. With a view to saving money I offered to take it over free or if necessary purchase it at a reduced price but the quotation given by the R.A.F. was 8s• 136/- per 1000 as opposed to te.56/- per 1000 for new' ammunition from India. The R.A.F. therefore still have 30,000 rounds lying useless in ;*uscat as it has for years. (9) AKIMAL TFANSrOFT . The M.G. donkeys are in fair condition but are entirely grass fed and would not stand up to hard, prolonged work. Grain is unobtainable and dates which at one time formed part of their ration are prohibitive. Three horses on charge are in good condition. The camels which were originally kept for the transport of artillery before it was carried on If.?, have been handed over temporarily to various Walis and can be called in should it be necessary to transport the guns to some place inaccess ible to M.T. The coat of feeding combined with the fact that suit able pack-saddlery was not obtainable rendered them useless. The Farm at Ruwi has effected a large saving in fodder, a considerably larger area has been put under cultivation producing Cherri, Ba^Jri and Lucerne $ unfortunately this can never support the animals entirely owing to the paucity of the water supply except from December to February. ^fotor Transport. Four Chevrolet 30 Cwt. and V/8 Station W&amp;Wbnsare on charge. One lorry has been immobilised for the past ten month© for want of a new cylinder head. The remainder were overhauled (decarbonised, valves grounded) under my personal supervision at the beginning of the year. We had a period of three months when only one lorry was going owing to lack of batteries^ these have now been received. The question of spare parts has now become acute and daily minor repairs are necessary. We have no fan belts, old web pack straps being used instead, re-inforced with Field Telephone cable, these are averaging 600 miles. All radiators require replacing as the present ones are 'plugged” with cement. Tyres require replacement and springs are most urgently required. All these items together with many other essential spares have been under indent for the past year but nothin has been supplied although it was agreed in December 1942 that the I.A.O.C. should undertake the supplies. This ispage 6 This 1 b particularly disappointing in view ofj the fact that, had export licences been obtainable, I could have purchased ‘ all that was required in Karachi either in 1942~^ thig year. These lorries are used continuously on the road between Matrah and Muscat. I estimate that after the rainS in January this road will be quite unfit for the use of M.T. The method of repairing in the past has been to rake loose stones of/rthe road and when M pot holes'* appeared, to level the remainder of the road down to the bottom of the hole Instead of filling up. The road is now so worn that the surface is down to bedrock and little could be done without a stone crusher and a roller. Owing to the terrible shaking the lorries get on this road they have deteriorated greatly in the last few months. uo) magAL. The health of the force has been good. There have been two deaths, one esneer of the stomach and one Typhoid-fever. Malaria cases have been comparatively few but unfortunately we are out of quinine. Although the M.O., Dr. Hynes, put in the minimum indent a number of essentials such as Cinchona Febrifuge, Mag. Sulphas, N.A.B. and Quinine were ommittea coiqpletely. The Consul has been addressed on this subject. The reduction in Malaria and Dysentry cases is presumably due to Anti-Malarial and Fly-Preventive measures which have been taken. The weekly con^ulsory bathing parade for all ranks, although unpopular in the cold weather, appears to have reduced the number of cases of skin diseases, although ulcers persist in the hot weather probably due to an excessive fish diet and lack of green food. There have been very few new cases of V.D. although a number of men have had recurrent attacks. The M.O. attends Bait-al-Falaij on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at such other times as required; he also, at my request, attends families in their homes. All serious cases are taken into the Agency Hospital, Muscat, the remainder are kept in our own hospital. ud m±m- The present ration consists of i- Att a ...

V M^ 3064 1000 8.34 Ai inute. This report is interesting in spite of the fact that it is a year out of date, and that much of the information co. tained in it has already been received in this Office and is to be found on other files. Sir Geoffrey Prior, in his Review of time Year (pages 2-4) stresses the t.vo major problems which confronted the administration everywhere in the Persian Gulf - the question of adequate food supplies and the rapid rise in prices and the cost of living. Once again the comparative calm of the Arab side of the Gulf vra.s in striking contrast to the unrest and insecurity on the Persian side. (page numbers quoted are those in pencil in the top right hand corner). J Chapter I: Bushire - pages 5-2p , During the year the importance of Bushire Port v* • was much enhanced by the establishment of an assembly • I plant for lease-lend lorries and the passage of war &gt;C| material along the Bushire-Shiraz road. The increase K in the Port led to an influx of labour, etc., which had a bad effect on the already steeply rising cost of living. The corruption of the Persian officials, hoarding, profiteering and lack of transport, combined with the unsettled state of the countryside, primitive methods of agriculture, a poor harvesb, and the prohibi tion of the exports of cereals and fruit from Shiraz to cause a sharp rise of prices in the towns and famine in some country districts. ma ersian J i 1 &lt;=d There were revolts in Dashti and Tangistan, and all efforts to re-establish the authority of the Pers Government and disarm the tribes in these areas failed, as did attempts in 1943* /Trade /Trade was slack, conmercial iiiDports, as distinct from war supplies and wheat and sugar supplied by the Allies, were restricted by lack of shipping space which also acted as a brake on exports, in spite of an increased] demand for Persian goods in foreign markets. However, dhows were more in use for local traffic, and the number : of British, American and Dutch ships calling at the x 501 *^ was slightly more than the previous year. Efforts were made to foster good feeling between the British and the Persians, and to improve relations between British officials and the local administration. Chapter III: Shiraz - pages 26-30 » Russian victories and the advance in Libya banished the anxiety that Persia might become a battle-ground, and public opinion became increasingly concerned 'with ) the rising cost of living. The tendency to blame Persian economic difficulties on the British persisted. I Lack of security on the roads and tribal unrest throughout the whole area was aggravated by the refusal of liuharnmad Nasir Qashgai to submit to the Persian Govern ment, and the fact that he was harbouring German agents in Oashgai territory - Nasir is still giving trouble and the Persian Government have now adopted a policy of conciliatioji i a combined with intrigue, intended to play off the tribes | against each other and thus weaken the Qashgai. The harvest was poor, due to lack of rain and the prevailing insecurity. This, together with the failure of the Government to control profiteering, led to a general increase in the cost of living. Hxport trade was on a very limited scale but owing to the depletion of stocks of merchandise and the abundance of foreign exchange, there was great activity in the import business, though showed a falling off towards the end of the year. Practically all imported goods came from India. Chapter IV: Kerman, Y e ad &amp; Bandar Abbas 'Pages 31 - ^ This chapter tells the same tale of lawlessness and j insecurity on the roads and bad harvests, scarcity, and rising prices aggravated by hoarding, corruption, official 1 incompetence and lack of transport. Owing to the war and to shipping restrictions there 'v.' 2 £ practically no trade with the United Kingdom, but trade with India increased, especially the import of sugar and tea, in which there was considerable speculation. The export of carpets ‘to the United States had ceased almost entirely by the end of the year. On the whole, the majority of the population, with the exception of the Amy and some of the merchants, was pro-British. Pear and hatred of Russia was increased 'by ■'exaggerated stories of Russian behaviour in the occupied sone.4 - . v Chapter V: Kg^reit - pa^es $6-69 This chapter presents a different picture frou those depicted by the Consuls on ^the Persian side of the Gulf. Although the sajrie problems of food shortage and steeply rising r^rices had to be faced, there was surx-'risingly little hardship in the town owing to the risii*g wages, the absorbing of ex-employees of the Kcn-reit Oil Company into the various barge-building projects - now unfortunately at an end - and the demand for labour in Iraq. There pvas no uni'est, and the relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent; were excellent. At the beginning of ^pri! the Sheikh tiad a serious heart attack, and although he made a good recovery another attack is liable to occur at any time. • SJ The, rise in prices caused the K owe it Govemment. to fix loa^d.nian. pidces for wheat, flour, rice and sugar, to introduce a system of rationing of essential foodstuffs., and to prohibit all exports except to Saudi Arabia.' high was doubtless one cause of the increase in the smuggling of sugar out of Koweit. The Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department of the Government of India took over the Post Office from hessrs, Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. , in I/iarch, and an agreement, since renewed, y«ls entered into with the Koweit- iubair Transport Company for the carriage of mails to Iraq twice a week. Liessrs. Cable d Tireless continued to operate their wireless station, and a telephone service was installed during the year*. The Palestinian teachers employed by the Koweit Education Department were replaced by teachers from Dgypt recruited on special terms by the Headmaster of the principal school, acting without full authority from the Goyernnent. Honey was plentiful and a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran, opened in February^ proved a great success. Agreements of friendship, neighbourly Relations, Extradition and Trade were concluded with Saudi Arabia. There was no change in relations with Iraq. Incursions of Iraqi Police patrol cars into Koweit territory and the embargo on the expopt of the Sheikh* s dates, though this was later lifted at the instance of the British Embassy, Bagdad, did not tend to inn rove relations. The Date Gardens Cases were still before the Iraqi Law Courts', and the Land Settlement Board. The Koweit - Iraq boundary at Umm^pusr, a ^ort being created by the military authorities, was another cause of fraction. In August the drilling operations of the Koweit Oil Company were suspended and men and materials transferred elsewhere. By the end of the year the CiDrirpany* s plant was on a care and maintenance basis, their only activity being the raining of bitumen at Burgan - and even that was given up in April 1943* - i -k - • - Charter VI - Bahrein - pages 7Q-94 * ...... Much of the information in this chapter was contained in the Administration Report of the Bahrein Government which has already been submitted under Ext. 5135/43• The chief event of tho year was the death on the 20th February of H.H.Sheikh Sir Hamad bin *Isa al Khalifah, KCIE.,CSI., at the age of about 70, and the peaceful succession of his eldest sonySheikh Salman. ^ II.R.II. the Duke of Gloucester paid a hiost successful visit to Bahrein in June } on his way to India. No major public works were undertaken during the year. The /surgerysurgery 'block of the Bahrein Goverrmient Hospital v/as completed, and arrangements were made for the accommoda tion of British Service personnel at the hospital. fhe pearling fleet was slightly larger than the previous year, but the catch .vas not good owing to bad weather. Prices were good but the increased cost of provisioning the fleet meant that nett profits were below the average. 6,2^0,627 barrels of crude oil were produced from the Bahrein field during the yearj and Rs.2,673, 46 2 were paid to the Bahrein Government in royalties. Ho new v/ells were drilled or completed. Facilities for receiving 35&gt;000 barrels a day of Arabian crude oil were installed at Zellaq. a temporary war bonus was instituted in April and paid monthly to all non-staff employees. In lisy. Defence Regulation No.2 of 1942, designed to prevent the Oil Company* s British and British-protected employees from leaving their enployment without permission from the Political authorities, was made by the Political Resident. There was no production at ^atar during the year and no further exploration on the fnicial Coast. as everywhere else in the Gulf, food supplies presented* a major difficulty due to the restrictions on exports from India and the irregularity of shipping, which was further complicated by the need to control re-exports to Saudi Arabia. The export of essential foodstuffs was x^ohibited, a system of rationing was introduced and arrangements were made to obtain wheat from Canada and Australia. Never theless, by the end of the year ’’the food situation looked veiy grave indeed'. Chapter VII: l.Iuscat - pages 95-109 » The chief event of 1942 was the establishment of the Southern Arabian air route with aerodromes at Salalah, masirah' and Ras al Hadd. Once the bad impression made by the ' invasion' of Pan- American Airways at Salalah had been at least partially eradicated, the presence of the Sultan at Dhofar ensured that the local labour gave 'full return for value received', though bis insistence that his approval for all activities should first be obtained neant continuous work for the Assistant Political Agent. There were many initial difficulties to he overcome in the establishment of the aerodrome at Aasirah - lack of water, ebsence of any good anchorage as well as local labour troubles. By the end of the year, ho /ever, there v/as practically a whole squadron of the R.A.F. there as well as a detachment of U.S.A.A.T.C. and a flying-boat base at Umm Rasas. A Both there and at Ras al Hadd, defence was in the hands of R.A.F. (Persian Gulf) Levies raised at Gwadur. The fact that there was no real trouble with the tribes during the year may be /$attributed to some extent to this extension of air power in the Sultan* s territory, v/hich convinced them of our instant ability to support him. Another factor v/as the shortage of food supplies and the enforced reduction by the muscat Government of supplies of rice to Oman which kept the Sheikhs pre-occupied with the problem of how to feed their people• Inports and exports increased in value and decreased in / quantityfa v ’-&gt; quantity, over 30% of the trade being with India. The local currency, Maria Theresa dollars, appreciated' in value throughout the year. By the end of the year steacier traffic to and from Muscat was irregular and infrequent (it has decreased still further since the torpedoing of the 'Dahpu* in Muscat harbour on the 26th June 1945])» and greater use was being made of dhows. The Muscat infantry was up to strength throughout the year and frequent exercises were carried out though the difficulty of obtaining fresh supplies of ammunition curtailed artillery exercises and weapon training. Owing to the delay in receiving supplies from India it was difficult to find sufficient uniforms to dress the guards. Total revenue for the year 1942 was Rs .879 ♦556-11- and total expenditure Rs .642,769'14“» leaving a balance of Rs. 236,586-13-. Besides this the State made a profit of Rs.126.326-8- by the appreciation of the dollar and the baiza. CO.

Gulf throughout 1942* The main problems of the year were (a) the provision of food supplies and (b) the steep rise in prices and the cost of living. quotas of food supplies based on the con- sumption of previous years were allotted to the Arab States, who were supplied from India; rationing was introduced and export control measures tightened; the system functioned satisfactorily except for short periods when supplies were delayed in arrival. Internal peace prevailed on the Arab side. A few rifles of old types were run from the Arab to the Persian coast, and some minor acts of piracy were committed in Persian Gulf waters. v. Ihe Ruler of Kuwait continued to give his loyal co operation in the furtherance of the war effort. He had a serio heart attack early in the year from which he fortunately recovers The main events of the year were (a) the opening in February of a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran (b) the signature in April ! of the Treaties of Trade, Extradition and Bon Voisinage betweay Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (c) the taking over in the same month c/ the Post Office from Messrs. Cable and wireless Limited, by the Indian Postal Department (d) the construction by the British Military Authorities of a deep water port at Utom &lt;^jaer, the owner ship of the site as between Iraq and Kuwait being still in dispute and (e) the cessation in August of operations by the Kuwait Oil Company. The case of the Shaikh’s date gardens in Iraq came before the Land settlement Board and at the end of the yeaf^lfhe were hopes that the major part of the properties would be final! registered in the name of the as Subah family. Bahrain suffered a grievous loss in the death in February of its Ruler, His Highness Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.fei., C.S.I. He was succeeded by his eldest son / Shaikh ^Shaikh Salman bin Hamad C.I.E. (on whom the K.C^I.E. was con ferred in the Hew Year’s Day Honours List, 1943). His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester passed through Bahrain on 6th June and again on 16th July. A net total of 891518 tons of crude oil was produced by the Bahrain Petroleum Company during the year, resulting in payment of Es. 26,78,462 in royalties to the Bahrain Goyermnent. Considerable passive air defence measures in the oilfields and refinery were effected, petroleum Concessions Ltd. suspended operations in ^atar in June. Industrial conscription for certain essential undertakings was enforofid by a Defence Regulation. Except for a brief visit to India the Sultan of Muscat spent the whole year in Dhofar. The roost important work of the year was the development in the face of considerable difficulties of the Southern Arabian Air Route, with aerodromes at Has al Hadd, Masirah and Salalah usable by the largest and speediest aircraft of the R.A.F. and the United States Army Air Corps, and the posting of their detachments and of R.A.E. Levies at these aerodromes. The increase in work necessitated the appointment in May of an Assistant Political Agent, normally resident in Salalah. The tribal situation continued &lt;iuiet throughout the year. The Maria Theresa thaler, which is the local currency, appreciated greatly during the year in terms of the rupee, resulting in hardship to those paid in rupee salaries. In May Muscat was linked by cable to Aden affording an alternative outlet for the Persian Gulf cable system. Comianies of R.A.P. Levies for the guarding of aero- dromes were raised during the year at Bahrain, Sharjah, Dubai and Gwadur. On the Persian side there prevailed throughout the year a heavy shortage of food supplies resulting in famine conditions in outlying districts. Transport facilities declined as more motor vehicles were laid up for lack of tyres and spares. With the exception of the districts of Hiat Daud and Lira i Gover authority in the hinterland was iit\le moi fand disarmament operations made little progress# banditry and disturbances were frequest and the motor road to oliiraz was often insecure# Prices of all commodities rose steeply# Fortunately for the town of Bushire 9 its utilisation during the year as a terminal port and truck assembly station for lease lend supplies to Russia afforded employment to a large number of its inhabitants, who would otherwise have starved. Relations with local officials were cordial and various activities in the field of public relations achieved marked success. The vagaries of the M.E.S.C., who had arranged for all European stores to be placed on the list of prohibited imports caused the greatest inconvenience and discomfort to those unable to supply themselves from N.A.A.F.I# institutes or oil companies stores. These arbitrary restrictions, which affected those living in coastal belt very severely, were imposed without any prior consultation of any sort whatsoever. Sd. G.G.PRIOR. Political Resident in the PersianCHAPTER I. 'y if ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR BUSHIRE CONSULAR AREA for 1942. O^fct £*.T SECTION 1. OFFICIALS . (a) British . (i) The Hon'ble Lieut* Colonel C.G.Prior held the office of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf throughout the year* Lieut. Colonel W.R.Hay officiated from 1st January to 31st September, when Colonel Prior returned from his appointment as Representative of India on the Middle East War Council, Cairo. Cii) Captain A.C.Stewart held the post of Secretary to the Political Resident up to February. 10th, when he ?/as relieved by Captain J.B.Howes, who held the post for the remainder of the year. (iii) Major R.Holmes was Residency Surgeon, Hr. T.E.Rogers Vice Consul, and Mr. R.I.Hallows Under Secretary to the Political Resident throughout the year. (iv) Tenth Army have maintained an officer in BusLIre since April and in November a Town Major was also appointed. (b) Persians . (i) Aqai Mir Ali Zahir was Governor of Bushire up to August, when he died suddenly. After a short interregnum, Aqai Behruz Kasmai, sunstantively Mayor of Bushire, was appointed to officiate as Governor; and has held the post since then. Aqai Zahir was reasonably co-operative, but not noteworthy either for his energy or his integrity. He was a violent Russophobe, having passed most of his service in the Persian Government’s foreign posts in South Russia. Aqai Kasmai has so far shown himself pro-British, helpful and active. (ii) Aqai Daulatshahi has been Director of Customs throughout the year. Though not a man of great strength of character, his attitude is friendly, and the expansion of the / port2 port and its development as the terminus of a supply line to Russia, have been carried through without undue difficulty. (iii) Yawar (Hajor) Mujad was chief of Police until Hay, when he went on leave and was succeeded by Rasadban (Lieutenant) Avar, in a temporary capacity. The latter was evidently determined to make hay while the sun shone, and in his tenure of the office surpassed all records for corruption and the abetting of smuggling and pilfering from war cargoes, ’until his removal was secured through H.M’s Legation. He was succeeded by Pasyar (Colonel) Jahid, who has restored discipline, and whose attitude has been ^uniformly correct. (iv) Sarwan (Captain) Isfandiari, an able and energetic officer, whose military abilities were marred by the ease with which he could be deflected from his public duty by his personal profit, held the post of Chief of Gendarmerie up to 6th October, when he was succeeded by 3arwan dhadrawan, a former officer of the South Persian Rifles. The latter, though lacking Isfandiar^s drive and intimate knowledge of the Inside politics of this area, has so far evinced genuine co-operativeness and a desire to clear up the unsatisfactory tribal situation in Dashti and Tangistan. (v) Sargurd (Major) Nuri has been Officer Commanding the Bushire garrison throughout the year. He has at various times evinced a tendency to intervene in tribal politics, but this has been at the orders of the Governor General at Pars; and although Nuri's sympathies are almost certainly pro-German, it has never become necessary to press for his removal. Towards the end of the year it began to appear likely that he will in future co-operate with Shadrawan in tribal matters. (c) Allied . (i) At the beginning of the year, the charge of the Russian Consulate was held by Mr. Alexander Belaieff. He was shot on January 4th, either by his own hand, or by his wife, as a result of an intrigue with a local bwiss lady. The Russian Consulate has since then remained officially closed, / althoughalthough it has been occupied by a succession of commissars, military officers and lady interpreters, who have visited Bushire in connection with the assembly of lorries and despatch of cargoes for the U.S.S.R. (ii) The U.S.A. have maintained a military officer in Bushire since February, in connection with Lease and Lend activities here. The officer has been frequently changed; but at the close of the year the strength of the U.S.A. detachment had risen to 2 officers and 9 other ranges. SECTION 2. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (a) An Indian locust party arrived in Bushire from Shiraz in April; but owing to lack of instructions went away without achieving any result. A Russian locust party operated from Bandar Dilum during June and secured good effect by spraying poison from aeroplanes. (b) The town electric supply has been out of commission throughout the year. Quarrels between the shareholders have been mainly responsible for the failure to repair the machines. (c) A motorized detachment of 31st Indian Division passed through Bushire in December, and spent a few nights under canvas. They came from Ahwaz, on reconnaissance duties. (d) The Economics Department was, until the last quarter of the year, under the control of the Finance Department. Since yet then, although no official has^irrived to take charge, it has been working under the orders of the Ministry of Foodstuffs. (e) The influx of poor into Bushire through famine in the country districts caused the Governor to call for a committee of Bushire merchants to deal with the situation. In June a subscription of 6,000 tomans was raised by them, and j:as distributed to the poor. This was found inadequate, and the committee then raised money to repair an old caravanserai / situatedsituated just outside the town, where they housed about 500 men, women and children. Plans were also made to feed and clothe them, and for medical attendance on the sick. (f) For rationing and other purposes, orders were issued for a census of the town and surroimding area to a distance of 6 kilometres. A notice was published for this to be undertaken on Christmas Day; but it was not carried out owing to an insufficiency of printed forms. (g) The Land Registration Department reopened its activities during the year, after the stoppage ensuing on the occupation of Persia. In the town of Bushire merchants and other wealthy people have begun to invest in buildings and land at almost three times last year’s value. But in the country districts, insecurity and the pov/er of local Khans have brought the Department’s work practically to a standstill. (h) Early in the year, a sun of Pdals 60,000 was allotted to Bushire from the estate of the ex-Shah. This was distributed to Mullas and poor of the town under the supervision of a committee consisting of the Governor and local merchants. A further sum of Rials 100,000 i'or the purchase of sugar, tea and piece-goods, and a sum of Rials 60,000 for rice was allotted for distribution to the poor in Dashti and Dashtistan. The disposal of this was entrusted to the Finance Department and it cannot therefore be definitely said what use has been made of it. SECTION 3. COMMUNICATIONS . (z) Land . The motor route to the hinterland has been rendered insecure throughout the year by brigandage in the hills on the part of Qashqai tribesmen and others. Animal caravans have also frequently been plundered in the Dashtistan plain. / (b) Sea-5- Wn Coble a-W,&lt; t^ss &gt;)(&gt;W &lt;^^- XlVcless Ly^.c In &amp;° o1 ' or 'boi^iiYfr (b) 3e^. There has, naturally, been a great dearth of mail steamers; and many weeks at a stretch have frequently elapsed between the passage of one ship and the next# During the year, the Persian Government agreed to accept travel certificates issued by the Political Agent, Bahrain for British subjects who have to travel to Persia on duty. (c) Air . Work has been put in hand on the Lingah aerodrome by the Garrison Engineer, oharjan. dQ also inspected a potential aerodrome at Bandar Hugam. During the year, a Persian olx^icer started repairs on the Bushire aerodrome, but this amounted to little more than the merest tinkering# No regular air line has operated during the year. There have been occasional visits by Royal Air rorce and Anglo-Persian Oil Company planes. (d) Telex-raphlc . The cable has been interrupted at frequent intervals throughout the year. During these periods telegrams have been cleared by the Persian Wireless Station. At the end of the year, the two wireless masts of Cable and Wireless Lira!ted, which had been confiscated by the Persians under the previous regime, vjere handed back to the Company, who were preparing to re-install W/T apparatus. The land line with Shiraz and Tehran has never been properly maintained since the Persian Government took it over, and is now liable to interruption for periods of days, particularly after rain. (e) Postal . Posts with the interior have been infrequent and irregular, as lorry transport is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have at times assisted in the carriage of mails, and at the close of the year, it was expected that they would shortly undertake a general contract. A censor was sent to Bushire by the Anglo-Soviet-Iran censorship; but at the close of the year he was confining his attention to the censorship of telegrams. / SECTION 4.6 r a ^ l;c. ^ et*-''' M SECTION 4. WAR SUPPLIES . The year under report has seen .Bushire transformed from a port of declining prosperity to the terminus of an important supply line for lease-lend aid to Russia. A plant for the assembly of lorries shipped here from the TJ.S.A. has been set up; and although the supply of equipment and of staff has been disappointingly meagre, surprisingly good results have been achieved with the material available. The local lighters have been reinforced by two tugs and five barges sent by the Inland Water Transport, Basra. SECTION 5. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL . (a) Dashti . This area has been in a state of chronic revolt during the year, the chief opponent of the Government regime being one All Ismail, the smuggler chieftan of Bandar OptraLons c Paiyir. At the beginning of the year a military force was lii i i ipy c »hsf&gt; : u/ec ? | Ah ls™&lt;' were a»r» lo h/ovembe* slP! lij. a&lt;}&lt; sent to Khormuj, in northern Pashti; but it accomplished nothing until in Kay it was reinforced by an additional 300 men with two tanks. An advance was then made to KSaki, and a few shots were fired. But the fruits even of this slight success were thrown away by entering into negotiation with the rebels? and when a further move v/as made on Daiyir, an unofficial adviser in the form of a certain Sheikh Abdullah Bora^jani was attached to military headquarters* This person succeeded in preventing an^ such results as might have been achieved by the military commander, from becoming effective; and when* eventually an attack was made on paiyir, contrary to his advice, he was in the town negotiating with All Ismail, and escaped with him. The troops v/ere soon afterwards withdrawn and a subsequent visit of the Chief of Staff, Jars, to the area produced a pleasant profit for him; but its result was that the rebels were permitted to remain armed, and a subsequentsubsequent visit to Sargurd Nuri confirmed them in the tribal areas for which they were to be responsible for security. (b) Tangistan . Rais Ali Chahpiri has been Government ma^ur throughout the year. While maintaining outward loyalty to the Government during the Dashti operations, when the line of communication of the military force passed through his territory, he has strengthened his position by intrigue, and has steadily opposed the efforts of the Gendarmerie on the coast to prevent his smuggling operations. He has succeeded in not having any Gendarmerie in his territory except the coast, and has used his freedom inland to practise oppression, connive at brigandage and settle scores with his personal enemies. ( c ) Hiat Daud and Lirawi . (i) Kiat Daud has been under th^control of Fathullah Khan (a grandson of the Haider Khan whose services in the last war were rewarded with the C.I.E.). Although he has undoubtedly connived at the smuggling in of arms through his territory, his attitude has in general been co-operative with the Persian Government and friendly with the British. In particular, he rendered service when a raid was made on Bandar Dilum by Boir Ahmedi tribesmen, and captured their leader, whom he sent to Bushire. (ii) At Hissar, in Lirawi, a coup was made by Mohammed Ali Khan, the brother of the late Khan of Lirawi, Aqa Khan, who had died leaving his minor children in the care of a certain Ahmed Shah, a trusted retainer of his, who is married to an aunt of Fathullah Khan, Hiat Daudi. He seized the fort, and dug up a store of buried arms and cash. Although the rifles had suffered from their interrment, he was able to hold his position in spite of Hiat Daud opposition, and has negotiated a modus vivendi with them. (d) Deh Rud Area C t, Buluk ,t ) . This fertile area has remained in the possession of Rais Ghulam Razni throughout the year. During the early stages of the operations in Dashti, / Razrai-8- '©^ i% Razrai busied himself as a negotiator; but when the military began to show signs of taking action, he withdrew to the Buluk. During the latter part of the year, his position here was disturbed by the arrival back from his family's exile in Tabriz of Shaikh Mohammed Chahkutahi, a son of the Hussein Chahkutahi who opposed the British in the last war* He had come back with the permission of the 'tribal grievances' commission, to try to regain his father's former lands, which included the Buluk. At the end of the year, however, he had made no progress towards his objective. (e) The Shibkuh . News from this area has been scanty, in default of a representative in Lingah and the difficulty of H.M.Consul getting away from Bushire on tour. Gendarmerie posts exist in very few ports, and the real power is wielded by the 'Zabits', who are the leading members of the A1 Hamadi, A1 Nasmi Obaidli and the A1 Ali families. There has been continual insecurity in the hinterland of this coast, the leading trouble makers being Shaikh Mohammed Lavari and Abdullah bu Hindi al Harami, (who was a mercenary of the Shaikh of Qatar at the time of the Zubareh incident with Bahrain). SECTION 6 . PUBLIC RELATIONS . During the year efforts were made to secure the greatest possible improvement in the field of public relations and to remove from the minds of both officials and the public, the legacy of suspicion and prejudice left by the Pahlavi regime. Contact with Persians was fostered, and took the form of entertainments given by the Hon'ble the Political Resident and his Secretary, of opening to Persians such functions as fetes organized in connection with the Red Cross, of social calls exchanged with prominent Persians, of mutual acceptance of invitations to dinner parties and the like, of certain Consulate officials and other British subjects becoming members of local / clubs-9 clubs and, on the other hand, of certain Persians joining the Consulate Sports Club and Library. Football and hockey matches were also organized in which young Persians showed themselves keen to take part. The Residency was able to assist the local administration in a number of ways and to help in improving local conditions. An important step in this direction was the initiation of a water conservation scheme to alleviate the acute shortage of drinking water in the town. Assistance was also given in arranging for the repair of the local electricity plant, in securing transport for the distribution of food and the movements of troops and Road Guards and in many other ways. Towards the end of the year a Reading Room was opened and run as a club in order to attract the support of the more influential members of the community. Amenities at this Reading Room include a wireless set, a small but expanding library of Persian books, a wide selection of Persian newspapers, magazines and periodicals (together with propaganda books and pamphlets) and light refreshments. The club is run by a managing committee of Persians; and members include the Governor the Heads of all the local Government Departments and most of the leading merchants. A cinema van, provided by the Public Relations Bureau, supplied a much needed want; and performances, whether at Bushire or other centres in the Governorste were enthusiastically received. The numerous activites undertaken to improve relations between British and Persian undoubtedly achieved a considerable measure of success. To the good feeling which resulted can , perhaps be attributed the fact that at Bushire, where important war cargoes were handled throughout the year, not a single act of sabotage occurred. / SECTION 7.SECTION 7. FOOD SUPPLIES . (a) The issue of ration sugar, tea and matches was announced in February 1942, but this only continued for a xew months, although large stocks of tea and sugar (tne latter, at the close of the year, in the nature of 4,000 tons) were held in the Customs. It was quite obvious that influential dealers were bribing the Government authorities to withhold distribution, in order that their own stocks of these commodities might be sold in the open market. In December questionnaire papers for a rationing scheme were distributed in the town and new coupons were issued. But their utilization was at the end of the year still held up pending instructions- from Shiraz. In July the Economics Department began to sell rice to the townspeople at a cheap rate; but this was only done for one month. A consignment of rice was sent to Dashti and Tangistan; but was mostly misappropriated. (b) Apart from world causes, the grave rise in the cost of living during the year under review may be put down to (a) an increase in the population of Bushire; (b) hoarding of goods by the merchants and (c) insufficiency of the Municipality’s control over the bazaar prices. The Shiraz Municipality were also partly responsible through their refusal to allow any kind of cereals or fruit to be exported from Shiraz. The Governor has appointed a municipal inspector for the market, and has instituted a committee to fix the prices of foodstuffs. The general increase in the price of staple foodstuffs has been about 400$ since 1936. (c) The Shabankareh irrigation project . Owing to lack of materials, especially cement, little progress was made during the year with the construction work required to complete the irrigation project at Shabankareh, and only a quarter of the / area1L area to be eventually embraced by the scheme has so far been brought under irrigation* It has now been found that the porous nature of the soil will probably necessitate the lining of the main distributaries before the whole of the 12,000 hectares can be irrigated and, unless special arrangements are made to obtain the cement required or some alternative method of lining the canals is employed, expansion of the scheme may, for the time being, cease altogether. During the year crops of cotton, rice, maize, vegetables and melons were produced in this area* (3) Seed Wheat . Bushire’s share of the seed wheat supplied by the Government of India amounted to 350 tons, or less than half the quantity which v/as originally considered to represent the minimum requirements of the Shahristan. In accordance with instructions, 100 tons of this seed were allocated to the canal irrigated area at Shabankareh (together with 75 tons of barley received from Iraq), and a committee consisting of the Governor, the Heads of the Agricultural and Finance Departments and prominent land owners, and attended by a representative of H.M’s Consulate General, was established at Bushire to arrange for the distribution Ox the remaining ^oO tons. In October the main centres in the Shahristan were visited by the Governor, accompanied by H.M f s Vice-Consul, in order to set up subordinate committees to deal with distribution to cultivators under the general direction of the central committee. At a later stage, a second series of tours were made by the Governor, accompanied by the Under Secretary to the Political Resident, in order to examine progress. On the whole distribution was fairly satisfactorily carried out and, as up to the end of the year rains had been unusually heavy, the prospects of a good yield seemed bright. (e) The bread situation gave grave anxiety throughout the year; and the town*s ration was estimated at an average of 6 ounces per head per day. The bakers* shops were daily besieged / by- 12 - by struggling crowds, and many deaths occurred from nourishment. er- (f) In June, M, Vajda, a Hungarian engineer employed by the Irrigation Department, visited the valley of the I told river, to the south of Bushire. He reported that the proposed irrigation scheme there would be uneconomic; but he recommended that it should be put through in order to ease distress in that part, and to give employment.TRADE AKD TRADE FaCILITIIlJ General Condition Trade was in general slack. It was only the passage into Iran of considerable supplies of war materials that increased the figures for imports above last year^ level. Other items of import were the wheat supplied to Persia by the Allies, and sugar. Lack of shipping space together with difficulties in securing export of foodstuffs from India restricted general commercial imports. The shortage of shipping space led to an increased use of dhows. The export trade with India, Iraq, and the United states continued with only a small decline in volume. Had shipping space been available, however, the figures for export might have shown an increase, as there was an increased derrand in foreign markets, e.g. from America for gum tragacanth, and from India for attari, gum Arabic, and goat hair. (a) Irtish . There was an increase in :he number of British ships calling during the year - SI ships as against 69 in 1941. The increase was composed largely of ships taken from the Far Eastern routes after the outbreak of war with Japan and particularly of ships of various lines carrying war supplies. The number of Gtrick Line ships calling declined - 4 ships, as against 8 in 1941. The Import tonnage brought by British slips increased by 50/jy from IP,643 tons to 27,707 tons. (b) Foreign United Jtates of America . 19 ships carrying a total of 19,324 tons called as against 14 ships last year which imported only 1,448 tons. The great increase in tonnage carried represents very largely war supplies. Dutch . 3 Dutch ships called as against 1 last year. But the total of goods imported rose from nil to 2,817 tons. Norwegian lorwewian /Norwegian . 2 ships called as against 3 xast y e ar• Union of Soviet Socialis t ilcpublics. One snip called Opium The decrease in exports mentioned last year continued The bulk of the opium exported went to the United Utates of America which is a nev; market for Persian opium. This is presumably due to the fact that supplies of opium from Turkey, (which is believed to be a better source than Persia of medicinal opium), have been more difficult to obtain. The following shipments were made during the year 2 - satisfactory throughout the year. Its products have enjoyed a good demand throughout the country and especially in Isfahan. The hill could easily have paid a divident of 200/i but, in order to present a less vulnerable front to the Finance Department, an interim dividend of 75% only was paid and the balance of profit remaining put partly into an auxiliary electric olant lor the Mill and partly to increase the share capital. The price of shares was increased to Rials 20,000 on the original face value of Rials 5,000 per share. The price of cloth increased by about 75% on last year’s prices. Workmen’s wages were increased by 50% while a further increase of 25% was made to the clerical s^afo.. There were two small stoppages in the operation oi ^he Mill, due in the one case to lack of cotton and in the oMier a mechanic!! defect in the electric power plant.

United Kingdom. 1170 cases Itemadieh 1.1111 The financial position of the Kill has been very Commercial clearance from the Customs was on a much smaller /smaller scale this year than last, partly owing to the increased use of the Zahidan frontier, and partly - towards the end of the year - to restriction on exports from India. The demana .or credit for clearing and forwarding charges was reduced accordingly. Considerable business, however, was done in the disposal, in a steadily rising market of accumulated stocks, land large profits were made. In support of the Government’s efforts to check the alarming rise in the cost of living, and to discourage the hoarding of, and speculation in, essential commodities, both the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Bank-i- Mellie agreed to restrict credit throughout the country, and to refuse all business of a speculative nature. This policy had little apparent effect up to the close of the year. Interest rates showed little change from those ruling last year. The shortage of local currency has been felt here, as in other parts of the country, but has not yet caused any serious inconvenience. The condition of many of the notes in circulation, particularly those of smaller denominations, is very poor. The uncertainty of the postal service, and the long delays caused by lack of transport facilities for mails, are having an increasingly hampering effect on local business. Agriculture Cr6ps very largely failed during tolie year under review owing to an almost total lack of rain, especial1/ in Bushire town and the neighbouring districts. Only in Liravi and, to a lesser extent, in small areas of Dashti and Tangistan were there surpluses over local needs. In the remainder of the shahristan, which was by far the larger area, th^re was a great shortage of foodstuffs. This was to some extent relieved by the imports of wheat brought in from Canada an&amp;glndia by the Allies. Export of dates from the Bush'.re district was prohibited in order to conserve local supplies. As a result, v /the small4. the small export trade in dates to India was lost to Bushire merchants. The autumn rainfall was satisfactory and it is hoped that the sowings which were above average and eked out by 350 tons of seed wheat from India will produce a good harvest. Agriculture, however, remains pitifully primitive and even a sir all increasd in the scientific methods or even in more careful working of the land would produce good results. Insecurity has been a long-rooted cause of bad agriculture in Persia and even improved seeds and model farms and ploughs will be no substitute for the settled conditions which are a prerequisite of careful husbandry. The changed political situation in Iran enabled this Consulate to take a direct interest in agriculture for the first time for many years. H.B.M. Vice-Consul acted as Consular Liaison Oxhficer and made a number of tours in the company of the Governor and Revenue Department officials in connection with the distribution of seed wheat. Wages and cost of living . The cost of living has risen greatly and prices of foodstuffs have in most cases risen over 200^ as compared with last year. Shortages of rice, cereals, meat and water have caused hardship. There was an increase of over 150/j in the price of Indian piece-goods and woollen goods. Transport Transport rates increased during the year owing to the shortage of lorries, tyres, and spares, and were over 100&gt; higher than last year’s average. No serious efforts were made to organise animal transport. Though it is true that camel and raule breeding has declined for some years, and that the large scale organisation of animal transport would therefore be slow and difficult, it is surprising that merchants have made so little attempt to use animals for transport. Fodder shortages and shortages of animals due to dearth and to drought have reduced the number of animals available /but itjr I' but it seems as if merchants were content to meet the high rates of motor transport which their profits enabled them to pay. After all it has been the scarcity of transport which, by facilitating the holding of goods for a rise in price, has been a major cause of the high profits of merchants. ■^i seel Igneous The -^ushire Sugar and Tea Syndicate which controlled the sale throughout the district of these commodities on behalf of the Government closed down of its own accord during the year having shown loss for two successive years. Rationing of sufar by the economics department, which by the end of the year became merged in the foodstuffs depart ment (Idareh hharbar) , commenced in March but i ai led in its work owing to the successful lobbying of merchants in Tehran and Shiraz to secure or withold the passing of administrative orders. This effectively wrecked the scheme and gained a better market for 'free*sugar. The price of the latter rose over 100# during the course of the year and the large mass °1 people had to restrict their sugar consumption severely. The income of the Customs oeclinen considerably. No duty was of course paid on war supplies. The decline w a s so marked that at one point there was not sufficient income to cover the expenses of salaries and wages and the Director was obliged to make a temporary loan from a Bushire merchant. The population of Bushire increased as a result of the work provided by the O.h.C.C. plant and the greater volume of shipping handled in the port ana in spite oi the steadily rising cost of living. By the enc of the year it stood at little less than 25,000.mmm . « 3SHKSHMHBI r S3z, NOTES ON SECTION 9* THE WORKING OF THE RESIDENCY DISPENSARY % 3J3HIRE, FOR T.-E YEAH 1942, (a) Assistant Surgeon R.Easay, I.M.D. was in subordinate charge of the Residency Dispensary throughout the year, under the Residency Surgeon, Major Holmes.

Belgrave, R.A.F. assumed hie duties as vice Consul and Area Officer, Para, in February 1942 and so continued until the end of the year. Lieutenant Colonel V.3.Robert of the ' nr* a 'rentier ervice acted from 82nd August to October 16th as Consular Liaison Officer in Shiraz between His Majesty’s Legation and the local Persian authorities for grain questions. Colonel Robert subsequently took up the same duties in Isfahan. PERSIAN AJDHIHISTKATION. Agha Assadullah Shams-i-Lulk Ara K.C.V.O. relinguished his duties as Ustandar (Governor-General^ of the ?th T^stan (Pars) and left for Tehran on Varch 30th. Shortly afterwards tip iahpuah, General Officer Commanding 6 th(Southern) Division was also recalled to Tehran and Sartip h:uhamjr ( ad Hussein Mirza Firouz, son of the late Faman Fama, arrived in Chiraz on April 1st and took up his appointment of Governor General (Ustandar ■ of the 'th Ustan, and General Officer Com?&gt;ianding 6 th(Southern's Fivirion. Fome ten days previously . artip Kase» than Shaibani Officer Corm anding, umnieh. Pars, was recalled to Tehran. Various changes took place in the course of the year in the senior personnel of Persian Government departments. The only ones which need mention in this record were the transference in July of ngha Seifpur Fatemi from the post of Sh&amp;hrdar (Mayor) to that of Famandar (Governor) of the hiraz district. This official has the qualities of initiative and drive much needed in the Municipality and the change in this instance was not to the general advantage. Sarhang Muhammad All Galar Khosrowdad arrived from Tehran in October and took over command of the Gendarmerie of Pars, pasyar II (Police rank of Lieutenant Colonel) Ismail : a warn! (Fourough-ul-. ulk) arrived frexn Tehran in May as Chief of Police. ANQLO-P FKRIAG R , Relations between thjs Conrulate and the Governor-General and other local authorities were maintained on a reasonably friendly basis though the somewhat anti-Gritish bias of Prince ’irons, which is of some years standing,militated against really easy and frequent contacts with officials. Karly in June It tramspirad that Marat instructions had been circularised by the then Prime Minister to heads of Government departments not to visit foreign Consulates except in response to invitations on each occasion. The result was that the element spontaneity which had previously characterised the social visits of Persians to the Consulate again vanished and such visits tlresomely became a matter of invitation. Senior regimental officers serving with the Division completely eschewed any contacts with the Consulate though on the occasion of a Consulate At-Home in celebration of the signature of the Anglo-Iranian Treaty ten officers of field rank accepted invitations, and attended. I.»K i-UBLIC ORINIOH. Pullic opinion in Shiraz during the early part of the year may be said to have been inspired by the belief (in some cases by the fear and in others by the hope) that the Germans were certain to defeat the/bogey in the Caucasus and bring some strangely imagined peace and plenty to the country. The serious British sat-back in igypt in the summer curiously enough produced a certain anxiety that in truth there was a serious risk of Persia, becoming a battle ground. Luring all these months however it cannot be said that public opinion in general was manifestly and aggressively anti-British or pro-Geman; it remains apathetic and tinged with anxiety as to the future. The failure of the Germans to take Stalingrad, and the turn of the tide in the Caucasu and in Libya very soon produced a change of atmosphere, anxiety, uncertainty and pro-Axis sympathy manifestly gave way to a readiness2 tO^believe that the Allies were coining out on top after all, and this ii. turn began to turn the fninda of people more towards their own difficulties which were growing daily from the fast rising prices of foodstuffs and goods. , ._ _ _ Nevertheless it may be said that the recollection o^ easy trade with Germans and of markets plentifully stocked with German v Japanese' goods, and the growing realisation that thfct trade waa avan end and was not going to be replaced by . racili cle ®. J Allied sources, and the fact that large numbers uf aliens were flooding the country who so far from bringing goods with them, were using up what was in the country, all contributed to a ^rowing resentment againsl the British. The failure also of the letter to remove totally the evil elements of the late regime, who on the contrary seemed to enjoy their continued support, tended also to produce much disatisfaction amongst many well-wishers who had hoped for better things. RIEA1 SITUATION. ^ , jSurtSi; most of the year interesti has be^n centred on the Qnahg&amp;is. Muhammad Nasir Qeshgai, eldest son of the late Sar-lat-ud- I) owl eh, remained firm in his decision not to core in and submit to the Persian Government, professing nevertheless obedience and readiness to cooperate in the suppression o r banditry ifcn his area. The spring migration of the tribes took place as usual, the flocks and herds with the women and children and a certain propertion of their men folk and gunner, moved northwards to their summer habitats. With them went Xhosrow, younger brother of Kasir .ashgai, and some of the Khans. Of the latter Saki Khan Tarashurli and one or two others called on His Majesty’s Consul and professed a desire to cooperate with the British Government. Naslr lashgal remained in and about the Firuzabad area, over which the Government exercised no control, but paid one or two visits to the pashejuli country north-west of Shiraz where he had opportunities of meeting officials from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as well as His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Bushire, on tour. In the autumn the peaceful return of the tribes to the garmsir was marred by a half hearted attempt on the part of the Persian troops in the path of the migration to disarm some of the gunmen. This effort nerely resulted in the lost? of some sixty Government rifles and horses' to the victorious tribesmen. Towards the end of the year Khosrow *ashgai twice came in to fhiraz when he visited His Majesty’s Consul and convoyed a message from his brother that he was ready to submit provided he received adequate assurances from both the Persian and British authorities as to his life and property. Steps were taken to convey guarded assurances, but at the end of thS year Keair and his brother remained buried in their tribal haunts. ^ Farly in the year the undermentioned Influential Hamassani and Boir Ahmedi leaders succeeded in decamping ^rom ^ehran where they had been r-reviously detained, (l) Hussein ’uli r han ’'ir tar son of Imam ^uli Khan (executed by the ex-fhah\ (2' Abdullah Khan Aarghanirpur son of the late Ghukrullah Khan Boir Ahmedi, and (3^ Muhammad Hussein Khan, son of the late Sartip Khan, Boir Ahmed, ’'hey were accompanied by Theikh Abdul Majid, another Mamasaani firebrand, strongly suspected of nefar/ious ucti^ities for the Axis. These tribal leaders have been the cause of much anxiety, but beyond refusing to allow the grain and produce from their districts to come into Kasemn and Shiraz, do not appear to have indulged actively in banditry. Apart from certain elements engaging in highway robbery on the Shiraz-Iefahan road during the spring migration to their summer camping grounds there has been little to complain of from the Kharaseh Arabs. On the return move of the tribes in the autumn they //ere kept well in hand and caused no trouble. Amir Khan Baharlu, Head of the Baharlu section, called on Ris Majesty’s Consul late in the year and professed to place hia services aft the disposal of the British if required. The situation in the Parab-Fasa area remained quiet and the district accessible. AXIS ivCTIVITIBa. Information derived from various sources pointed to the definite presence with the qashgai of a number of Germans - possibly five - who were being harboured by Kasir, not merely a© refugees but as agents, doubtless with plans for tribal risings to embarrass the British forces in the event of an axis descent on Persia from the Caucasus. The@(0 The definite existence of a prepared landing ground for enemy air craft at FarrasKband was alao proved by aerial reconnaissance by the l lf 0 The ^ovemor^eneral i rince ftwmM disci cry krowledga of any prepared landing ground b in ^ttsh^ai territory* Fnoonfirwed reports of other Ormans 4n the neighbourhood of ^Mraz were also |received from time to time. coykimrcATioNs. Muck work was done on the SbiraB-Tsfahsn and Ohlraz—Bushire poad during the year. This work was taker over entirely by the British military authorities acting through their agents the Kampsax Consortium Ltd., (a Panish-Norwegian organisation already established in Persia). British K.^.Off5cers supervised the work. Considerable improvement has been done to the existing road, especially on the difficult Shiraz-Bushire section, but there was still much more to be done by the end of the year, l arge numbers of lorries and trucks from the U.3.A. and of military sullies for the soviet Union passed over this road to Russia during the year. SECURITY . During the whole of the year there has never been complete security of life and property either on the main ro#3 between Isfahan and Bushire, or in the province of Fare as a whole. &gt; n the other hand the state of insecurity has not been such ss to prevent the movement of traffic up and down the main road though it has militated to a greater or less extent against the easy transport of goods and food stuffs to the main centres of population. The ^ashgai tribal district has not been under Government control And in the liamaasani area government control has been very limited. All through the year there have been periodical attacks on labourers engaged on the road work and holds-up by robber bands - sometimes of tribe! composition and sometimes of neighbouring villagers, in some cases believed to have been aided and abetted by irregular road .guards. Most of the trouble was experienced on the 3hir*z-Kazerun section of the road and chiefly at such notorious points as Ohihil Cheshmeh (31 miles from Shiraz - Tul-i-&gt;jzd (30 miles from SMrez' Deh-i-Sheikh, etc., points where side tracks to the main road afford an easy way of approach and escape for robbers. These banalte aimed generally at holding up and robbing lorry drivers and travellers of their cash and clothes, but in certain cases attempts were made to go off with loads, mor*e especially in the case of tea and sugar. Trouble of this nature was less frequent on the Shiraz-Isfahan section. In the spring of the year however s number of robberies occurred in the neighbourhood of the Sivand-Baadetabad loop(56 miles from Shiraz&gt; perpetrated by farsl^Ambs on the move of the tribe northwards to their summer grazing grounds. The removal of the officer (Captain Fuhamad Hussein Arab) from the post of military governor of the Khamseh Arab Tribes and his replacement by Captain Amir Sadri soon improved matters, and on their downward trek in the autumn these &gt; rabs caused no trouble. One British R. .Officer was a victim of a hold up towards the end of the year when his car was stopped some 3 wiles outside Shiraz and he received a bullet wound in the arm. On another occasion an American officer (Captain Wilson)travelling as a passenger on a lorry lorry from Bushire to Shiraz was a victim and was stripped of his revolver and kit. An American Agricultural Adviser, Professor 7/insor, also experienced a hold ux&gt; and was robbed. Similarly two British officials of the Kemanshah Petroleum Company Limited travelling from Isfahan to Shiraz were held up and robbed of their cash and clothes. Ko lease-lend trucks or material moving from Bushire to the north were seriously interfered with, though on one occasion three trucks, forming part of a convoy driven by Russian drivers were stopped by bandits and one Russian soldier lost hi^ rifle and some cash. On a few occasions both United Kin dom Con^iercial her, oration transport, and Kermanshah Petroleum Tanker lorries were stopped and the drivers robbed of their cash and belongings. At the end of the year a British Reconnaiseance Party from an Indian Motor Brigade visited the area a \d Brigadier Pilose, accompanied by the Additional Military Attach and an officer deputed by C.I.C.I. Bagdad, was deputed by the Commander--in-Chief Paiforce to examineejLanine the military sccwrity aituation and make appropriate i cormrienaations.

Similarly the retail prices of home made products ro«e in sympathy with the increase in the general cost of living and by the end of the year manufactured gooos from the mills at Bushire and Isfahan and of Shiraz itself reached unprecedented heights. TRAP#. Throughout the year 1942 market conditions in Shiraz showed greet activity principally in the import business, in fact greater than at any time since the outbreak of hostilities. The chief reason was due to the depleted stocks of merchandise and the abundance of foreign exchange available for imports. Towards the close of the year imports showed a falling off dde to restrictions imposed by foreign countries on exports a&amp;A the lack of shining facilities. Practically all imported goods cane from India, the nature of the goods being tea, piece goods, sugar, coffee, spices, and yarn.

Ghe Axis successes of the su’a.aer inspire i s fir a belief in i -er • i victory. The ^ro-Jazi feelings of the people ware not due to the fact that they were actually anti-British, but because they heard one half of the story only.

TG.K aUT,r^ 7\iI T T . /’f OauS/n Hie His Highness Shaikh Sir Ohmad al Jabir as Subah, K.G.T.O., the ,iuler ; or Amir^of Kuwait had a very serious heart attack at the heginnln; of April and for some weeks his condition | was critical. H’e was ably attended hy Doctor L.C. Gcudder of the Vrahian “ission who was assisted from time to time by Doctors Maclean and 'arsh from the Anglo-Irani an Oil ho-up any at Ahalan. His Highness* health had much improved by the end of the year and he had resumed, in a mild way, his hawking expeditions, but there I is still cans® for anxiety as another and possibly fatal 'attack may occur at any time. &gt;\t one time it was thought advisable for him to spend the hottest months of the year in a rrilder climate than that of Huwait| d hut the difficulties of travel in war time forced his medical advisers to abandon the scheme and the r hai :a remainei in Kuwait territory throughout the year. (b) There have been few changes in the Government appointments held by members of the family, 'haikh Abdulla as Galitn \s Bub ah, C.I.H., has remained President of the Advisory Council out has paid little attention to affairs of Gtate and has spent two thirls of the year living, in Tailacha Island. During the kuler’s illness ne was the reverse of useful, jayin, little heed to the medical officers* advice and generally behaving in a foolish manner. Kuwait does hot lose by his frequent expeditions to his island home and would express no regrets if he were to abide there permanently. He has considerable influence in politics but his power had declined somewhat and his general health leaves inch to be desired. He visited Baghdad during November for medicaltreatment and remained in seclusion in the Nursing Home to #hich he had been admitted. (c) To the regret of the entire population Ihaitch Ali al Khalifah, the Director of Public Security and Governor of Kuwait Town, died in a Sanatorium in the Lebanon in \pril. A man of fine character and an administrator of ability he had been in charge of Kuwait Town for some years and had controlled the merchant element and settled the thousand and one disputes of the individual inhabitants with the minimum of delay and much fairness. A staunch supporter of the present huler he was honoured by His Majesty The King with a companionship of the Indian Empire on the 1st of January but did not live long enough to be invested, \fter a long illness during which he was atten ded by the doctors at the Arabian Mission Hospital his health improved sufficiently to enable him to return to the ^anntoriurn at which he had resided in 1941 but unfortunately his death occurred very shortly after his arrival there. (d) Shaikh Ali al Ehalifah, O.I.K., was succeeded as Birector of Public Security by Shaikh Abdulla, the last surviving son of the famous Ahaikh tubarak, grandfather of the present Euler. Shaiiih Abdulla is now about 30 years of age and is a progressive man with a capacity^only too rare in xrabia^for getting things done. Por some years he understudied Shaikh \li al Khalifah and had acted for him on numerous occasions. He is a supporter of the Euler and would undoubtedly be a serious rival to Shaikh Abdulla As Salim for the Amirate on the demise of the present iuler were it not that his mother was a Georgian slave, it being a custom of the Subah tribe that the Euler musW be of tribal blood on both sides and this custom has so far never been altered though there is little doubt that such a custom would have formed no permanent impediment to the progress of Shaikh Abdulla’s father who wrested the \mirate from his two elder brothers by the simple expedient of shooting them both on the same morning. («}/\ , /. ' -3- 'tulti ac 1 §On oi; t-Kt ^ulex 3yoirhtV G^ 'RuKv (e) Shaikh 4&gt;)dulla al Jahir retained his appointments as Chief J'idKe and Erector of Education and has carried on his arork with conniderahle success* He is a hypochondriacal individual and visited Baghdad in October for medical treatment hut unlike Shaikh Vbdulla As Salim he found time to enjoy himself and was hospitably entertained by leading Iraqis. (f) Shaikh Ha mood al Jabir, His Highness* half brother was relieved of his appointment of -resident of the Municipality on his return from leave in lyria in October for misappropriation of public funds, do far no successor has be n appointed. (g) Shaikhs Tahad and dubah \s Salim retained their appoint ments of Head of the Treasury and Chief of Police respectively. (h) Shaikh Abdulla al Ahmad has governed the trsenal without undue effort and has increased in weight so that he now weighs at least seventeen stone#. (i) Shaikh al .Jabir has continued to control the port. He was active early in the year against smugglers and made some notable captures but it is to be feared that the enormous bribes which high prices and fantastic profits enable smugglers to offer have not all been rejected and there has been a very serious increase in the smuggling of goods, principally sugar, out of Kuwait. (j) Shaikh Subah an xNasir a very well-to-do but distinctly unbalanced member of the tribe came into prominence during the early part of the year principally on account of his acts of insubordination in desert affairs which eventually shamed the Ruler into taking action to curb this gentleman exuberance. Latei in the year he moved to the northern frontiers of Kuwait where it is probable that with the help of Iraqi Shaikhs, with ,\hom he is on terms of friendship, he engaged in smuggling sugar and tyres from Kuwait to Iraq. III. THK POLITICM RSI ATIONH WITH THE SHAIKH . The 'Olitical 'gant*s relations with the Ruler have remained most cordial and His Highness has on every possible occasion shown his willingness in practical form to further theallied interests. IV. TOO AT, !^T 3 (a) General . 4 There has 'been no political activity worthy or mention during the year. Trade has, all things considered, been remarkably good and the attention of the merchants has been engaged exclusively in their ovn affairs. During the course of the year the continued upvard trend in prices caused the Kuwait Government under pressure from the igenoy to take certain very necessary measures to safeguard the interests of the community and maximum prices vvere fixed for wheat, flour, rice and sugar, the export of silver coin ,as for- bidden, an embargo was laid on the export of goods by sea and l*nd to all places except Saudi Arabia, and a primitive but really remarkably effective system of rationing of essential foalstuffs was introduced. An event of importance was the conclusion of an Extradition Agreement, a Trade \greement and an Agreement of Friendship and Neighbourly Relations between the Ruler and the Government of the Hedjaz and Nejd. The actual signature of these documents had no practical effect as the provisions had already come into force in 1940 by mutual agreement between the two countries. The domestic affairs of the house of 3ubah have attracted no attention and as far as is possible to ascertain the year has been strangely free from family squabbles. At no time during the year was any anti-British feeling readily apparent and such subterranean activities as there may h-'we been died away as the German Marshal Rommel's army in Worth Africa was driven further and further to the west and the threat to Egypt and the iddle East became at first less dangerous and later practically non-existent. Trade . A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confiiential publication. (c) Cu s toms . There have been no further increases in the Customs m-5- ^ Import Duty .vhich h%s remained at 6i% ad valero;n. Tile Director of Dus toms resigned in January iDut his resigna tion yras not. accepted and he continued to attend his office hut ^ eventually he he carte exasperated hy the Kuwait 'overaaent ’s refusal to increase his pay or accept his resignation and in October stayed away leaving the Chief Customs Cleric to carry on the -voric of the Customs. The ex-Director ia now contracting for the ir iy and the Chief Clerk: has taken over as Director of Customs. (&amp;) Council * The Council met at irregular intervals hut their deliberations have caused no stir arid it almost seems as if they had ceased, lixe so many other democratic institutions, to carry any weight at all during the present days of war. (1) Medical . The number of patients treated during the year at the Government of India Dispensary was 20,172 a very great increase on last years figure. The Medical Officer h^s been able to devote much more time to the practice of medicine since he was relieved of various duties connected with the Agency *M which the Political Agent took over himself with the very gratifying result that hunt!reds more of the poor of the Town have been able to obtain free medical attention. (ii) The Tuwait Government Medical Establishment has remained unchanged and the medical officers have done very good work. The State Dispensary is clean and well run and reports show that the experiment has been justified. Unfortunately work on the State Hospital has had to ba suspen ded owing to the difficulty of obtaining materials and the very considerable rise in the wages of skilled and unskilled labour. It is to be feared that there is no hope of completing this much needed building until after war. (iii) Dr. L.C. Scudder assisted by Dr. T.H. Hykerk has continued the fine medical work which the Arabian 'fission have for years carried on under the able direction of Dr. C. . r , T ylrea, CBS. w who retired last year. Dr. Huth 0. Grouse, also a member of the Mission, has been in charge of the Arabian Mission vomen # a Hospital and has done much to break down old fashioned prejudices against- 6 - 6 L hospital treit'Tient for women though the hospital is still not as much used ?s the excellence of the building and the soundness of the treatment would justify. The out-patient department is large ly attended and there is no doubt that Ir. Grouse has made consi derable progress during the year towards winning the confidence of the women of the Town. (f) Post ml Telegraphs . Tn varch the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department of the Government of India took over the Kuwait Post Office from Uesars. Gable and fireless limited. Postal communication was reopened with Iraq by the overland route and *essrs. the Kuwait - dubair Transport Company entered into an agreement for the carriage of the mail twice a week between Kuwait and Iraq and Iraq and Kuwait for one year from the 1st of April. This was indeed a notable step forward but it was not the only one for later in the year the Indian Post and Telegraphs Department undertook the repair of the Kuwait - '.ubair land line as far as “tefwan, the Iraq frontier post, and thirty 4i\ six of the sixty eight miles had been completed by the end of the year. Messrs. Cable and Tireless limited continued to operate their wireless telegraphy station efficiently and during the year installed an automatic telephone service. There are at present seventy subscribers to the telephone service and there are many Not ' ore potential subs- Pi but wvt conditions have made it impos- $ 1 %}# for the Company to obtain sufficient instruments .for all the people who have applied to have telephones installed on their business premises and in their private houses. The system is (Inexpensive and efficient. I (g) Education . In July the Kuweit Government decided to dispense with the services of the Palestinian teachers. The reasons for this decision are somewhat obscure but the ‘iducational Department were probably actuated by a desire to improve their teaching staff an* at the same time save money. It sounds an almost impossible object to attain but they h 5 ve in fact come very near to achieving-7- F«r H™ «ir &gt;7Ct»n«S £*T /i ^/-43. their purpose. The Palestinian teachers had most of them heen here sometime ^nri were asking for increased salaries, so they were allowed to return to their homeland and the Headmaster of the principal school was sent forth to yrt- and Egypt with instruc tions to find better men at more reasonable rates than the D al9S- ti rfijjnz were demanding. This object he achieved by approaching the Egyptian Educational Department ana enlisting four teachers at a silary of C. 12 a month, the Egyptian Government undertaking to allow the men to retain a lien on their appointments in Egypt and paying £‘. IE a month to the relati/es of the teachers in Egypt. It is very doubtful if the Kuwait Govern .ent was aware how their headmaster was going to set about the task of getting better material for less money and he was undoubtedly not carrying ■ anything in the nature of official or unofficial letters of intro duction to the Egyptian Government but his action has placed the ~Thc ^^ a ' KYnrr,cn ^ w tdn i n an embarrassing position. The Educational \dviser who S^toaryL^t &lt;^c W.Hrout carried out a thorough inspection of the Kuwait Educational Gsta- //iy blishments in Octobar considered that tne ne , masters ^ere without question an asset from an educational point of view but the politi cal aspect of the question is not by any means as rosy and the matter is still under consideration. (h) financial . loney has been plentiful, in Tact during the l^st year there has bean more money in Kuwait than for many years previously. This Is partly duetto the general rise in the selling price of all kinds of goals and partly to the import of large sums of none: by various Service formnvions to pay for local ^trchases of dhows, wooden w*ter tanks, and fish oil. Local labour has greatly benefited by Inland later Transport boat building program* mes and the reconstruction of American barges at Shuwaikh so that all classes of the population have had money to spend. In thejfearly part of the year the rupee notes of various denominations were at a serious discount and tne continual demand for silver coin was embarrassing to the Agency, the Imperial Tank, the Kuwait Oil Company, essrs. Cable and Tireless limited,and to the various Ti* lit ary and other Service formations who desired £o ■-nalce purchases In Kuwait. The Buler*s assistance was sought hy the Agency and with the cooperation of the Kuwait Government Departments it was not long before notes were being cheerfully accepted by the general public at their full value and the pendulum continued to swing so that *t the end of tne ye°r notes were in demand and coin was not, merchants insisted on being paid in notes or by cheque, it the end of the y -ar money was in demand in Kuwait and drafts on Bombay were at oit discount. Y. PE3KBT XNTSKET TS. The tribes of the desert have been very quiet and t ere hp.ve been no incidents of tribal fighting or raiding in Kuwait territory or in its immediate neighbourhood. The rains have been poor, the grazing inadequate, and the summer abnormally hot with the result that there has been high mortality among the flocks and the herds so that the bedouin have been absorbed in their own Struggle for existence and have had little time or inclination to quarrel with their neighbours. The food shortage is being felt throughout nomadic Arabia more severely than in tne towns owing in part to the difficulty of supply, no tyres being available for the lorries, and many camels having died and many more having been sold to Military formations, and in part to the very high prices being asked for such supplies as may be available. The bedouin though a pictures que and amusing fellow is a shiftless drone with a margin between income and essential expenditure so narrow as to be wellnigh invisible even In the days of plenty and low prices. Now with high prices and scarcity combined with his inherent dislike of manual labour by which he might gain a reasonable livelihood the margin has become non-existent, and in the desert areas adjacent to Kuwait the tribesmen are faced with what looks very like starvation unless they alter their way of life. In Kuwait territory the situation is not so serious but is still a cause fo anxiety*- 9 - vi. (a) ■Iau.il ntla . Relations iltft -laudl gratia Have seen vary friamly and the final negotiations for the agreements of friendship and Neighbourly Relations, Extradition, and ■rads between Kuwait and that country were completed by the end of „ yp.rch 1948 ani the documents ware signed In Jedda on the 20th Co .lec-Lion I* ~ Fox cv p^ec.s ^ texts up Set Khhj/iZ of \prii.

Incursions by Iraqi Police Patrol cars into Kuwait terri tory have annoyed the Buler, «nd very rightly 30 , an X action in eptember of the Iraq Ooveramsnt in fore idling the I export of the Haler's own dates from the Too gardens to r.await did nothing to improve the relations between the Go/emmcnts of the two countries. The agreement in December of tne Iraq. Government to permit the Huler to ox'ort 6,0G0 maunls of dates u.or consumption in Kuwait though it enhanced our own prestige with His highness did not inclina him to view the actions of the Iraq Government with a raore favourable eya as he rightly considered that the concessi was due to pressure by our Embassy In Baghdad and was not a gesture of poolwill from one Bisdim Itate to another. VII. Pita GAHDKN1 . The date gardens case continues its dreary ay through the. Taw Courts of Iraq without making any ostensible progress toward! a conclusion in favour of or adverse to toe interests of the Kulcr. There ore in fact three main eases,two before the Law Courts and one before the President of the iota Land Settlement Bo-rd, those before tne Law Courts are appeals in the Bashiyah and laddaghiyah cases and that before the land Settlement Board is the ?ao estate. (a) Tile Bashiyah is the least satisfactory as only 36 out ofthe 216 sharis in this land Mrs registered hy the Land Settle- - 10 - ment Board in the name of the \s Suhah and possession of the 180 shares to which the As Subah were unable to establish a valid aim did in fact passed to the heirs of Ali bin Zuhair in 1938. T^rious possible lines of action were considered to enable the Shaikh to regain possession of these estates or to obtain their original purchase price from the present owners but it was considered that none of them offered sufficient chance of success to justify the trouble and expense of once again embarking on lengthy legal proceedings in Iraq. However it seems that the heirs of Hi Zuhair were not content with their 180 shares and appealed against tbe Land Settlement Board f s decision registering 36 shares in the name of the As Subah and the duler has entered a counter appeal with, I fear, but little hope of success. (b) The ^ddaghiya estate has been registered in the name of the As Subah by the Land Settlement Board but an appeal has been lodged the hearing of which is proceeding with the usual lack of celerity before the Court of Appeal in Baghdad. The case has been 'adjourned four times owing to defects in the Buler^ Power of Attorney and from other causes attributable to the negligence of the Buler's Counsel, and five times awing to procrastination on the part of the opposing Counsel. (c) The ?ao estates are still before the Land Settlement Board but there seems little reason to doubt that the major portion of the estates will be registered in the name of the As Subah though the question of 'lazma' land is causing some concern. Tin. UMM Q-A SB» This site of an ancient fort of ’which nothing now re mains but a heap of rubble, bordered on the east by the muddy Khors Zubair and Abdul1 ah has achieved undue prominence owing to the Military Authorities* decision to build a port there.

It was hoped at the close of the year that ships would ce able to bertn there before the summer of 1943 commenced. Politically events moved with disconcerting suddenness early in the year but later the pace became more normal and trie present position is that it is agreed that the Kuwait-lraq boundary traverses the port urea but there are two schools Ol r thought regarding the exact path traced by the boundary on its journey from fafwan to the junction of tiie Khors Abdullan and Bubair principally owing to a difference of opinion regarding the geographical location of this junction. The H 1940 line'* leaves a considerable area of the port area to Iraq, while the •Takefield .^porV*, an illuminating and closely reasoned docu ment compiled by Ir. Taxefield, T.C.B*, while Officer on Special Duty hare, places the boundary much further north and secures to Kuwait the most important port installations inclu ding the actual wharf. Vhich line will eventually be accepted is dif fic’dlt to forecast but it is possible that the project will never be completed and the area will once again sink back into obscurity.

Ruler of Bahrain and the M Khallfah Family The moat important events of the year were the death, on the 20th February 1942, of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa al Khallfah, K.C.I.B., C.S.I., and the succession of his eldest son, Shaikh Salman, as Ruler of Bahrain. At about 8.30 p.m. on the 17th February Shaikh Hamad had a stroke while saying his prayers. He fell on his side, senseless, and never subsequently recovered consciousness. Dr. Snow, the State Medical Officer, Dr. Holmes, the Residency Surgeon, who happened to be in Bahrain at that time, and Dr. Harrison, of the American Mission, attended Shaikh Hamad, and one of them was always with him until he died at about 12.15 p.m. on Friday, February 20th. He was burled in the cemetery at Rafa* the same day. Shaikh Hamad's death at the age of about 70 occasioned general and sincere grief. Hot only had he proved a true friend of the British Government but he had always given a friendly and sympathetic hearing to all who came to him with their troubles. Messages of condolence were received from all quarters of the globe. By unanimous choice of the Al Khallfah, and, as was disclosed later, in accordance with the will of the deceased Ruler — Shaikh Salman, the eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, succeeded his father as Ruler of Bahrain. His succession was speedily accorded formal recognition by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India; and at a public durbar held at the Palace in Manama on the 6th April 1942, the Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel W.R. Hay, / C.I.E.C»!«£•j Political Hosident in the Persian Gulf, formally presented to Shaikh Salman a Kharita from His Excellency the Viceroy congratulating him upon his succession to the Shaikhdom of Bahrain. In JUly 1942 His Majesty the King graciously approved the grant to His Highness Shaikh Salman of a personal salute of 11 guns. (The dynastic salute of the Kuler of Bahrain is 7 guns)• 4.

Due to economic conditions, petty thefts increased; there was also an increase in traffic accidents, resulting in four deaths and six serious injuries. 5. Agriculture The Government Agriculturist, obtained from Egypt in 1941, continued to give free advice to cultivators. There was an Increase in cultivation of European vegetables by small holders. About 400 acres of wheat was sown by the Government and by certain members of the Ruling Family andand a few merchants. The experimental farm at Budaya was enlarged. In order to encourage market gardening and bring more land under vegetable cultivation the Bahrain Government advanced ,, taccavi M loans to approved applicants. The Bahrain date crop during the year was above average. 6. lUinlclpalitles (i) Manamah Good progress was made in the construction and maintenance of roads and the filling up of swamps inside the municipal area. The usual town cleaning and supervision of markets and municipal services were maintained. During the year the municipality constructed 90 air raid shelters in the town. In the latter part of the year, the itfunicipal- ity was entrusted with the local administration of the rationing of rice, wheat, flour and sugar. (ii) Muharraq His Highness Shaikh Salman was, prior to his succession Chairman of the Muharraq Municipality. On his becoming Buler, he handed over charge of this appointment to his brother, Shaikh Abdullah bln Hamad. The municipality carried out its normal programme of road widening, town cleaning, etc. 7. Public Works No new work of major importance was undertaken during the year, the Department being fully occupied with various construction schemes required by the Military authorities. The surgery block of the Government Hospital was completed during the year, and various alterations and repairs to Government buildings were carried out.S- &lt;■ \ 8. Electric Department owing to lighting restrictlone caused by the War f there was not the usual revenue from this source. The two chief additions to the existing load were (1) a new high tension line from Muharraq town sub station to the K.A.F. aerodrome at Muharraq; and (2) a new 400 volt feeder to the old premises of Cable and tireless Limited. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued| but at a reduced rate, due to the scarcity and high cost of wiring material. Approximately 260 points were added during 1942 as compared with 460 in 1941. The total number of telephone subscribers at the end of the year was 93, as compared with 86 during 1941. 9. Pearling Industry The number of pearling dhows in operation was slightly larger than in the previous year — 298 as against 222; but the catch during the 1942 season was not good. Weather conditions were unfavourable, and the smaller dhows had to spend much of their time taking shelter against unusually high winds which swept down the Gulf from time to time. Good prices were obtained for pearls after the diving season had been closed for some weeks, but the profits of nakhodas and divers were much below average as the greatly increased cost of foodstuffs added enormously to the expense of provisioning the fleet. Generally speaking the pearling season was poor but not as bad as that of 1940. Advances to divers were as follows:- Diver Puller Tesqaam fc. 30 25 Salaf fe. 30 25 Kharje eh fc. 20 15 &amp;. 80 65 / y flu10. Cuatoma Customs Revenue amounted to Rs•9 f 53 &gt; 420/- as compared with fc.8,04,089 during the year 1941.

The R.A.F., who paid for the construction of a new ward, also supplied an R.A.F. Medical Officer and four nursing sisters. (iv) Quarantine Station. Muharraq Assistant Surgeon M.L.A. Steele, I.M.D. was Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. / (v)(v) Epidemic disease There w&amp;s an epidemic of smallpox early in the year. The number of cases of smallpox officially reported and treated at the Quarantine Station during the year was 193 with 14 deaths 5 the attacks were of moderate severity, there being only 5 cases of the confluent type and 6 with eye complications. Cases and contacts, on being notified, were conveyed to the Quarantine Station. Those requiring vaccination and re-vaccination were given immediate attention. Apart from smallpox, there has been no definite epidemic except a type of mild influenza, and such an unusual amount of malaria that it has almost amounted to an epidemic. This was due to the abnormal humidity and the absence of the usual amount of cold. * (vi) Vaccination In addition to routine vaccination carried out by the hospitals in Bahrain, a house-to-house vaccination campaign was carried out by the State Medical Officer. Mftny men, women and children were discovered unprotected and were vaccinated on the spot. This measure appears to have contributed to the decrease in the severity of the disease during the year under report as compared with 1941. 14. Post Office Mr. Kanwar Singh held charge as sub-postmaster from the beginning of the year until the 15th November 1942 when he proceeded on leave, tfr.

Judicial (a) Bahrain Government There has been no change in the magistracy. One important estate was dealt with, viz. the estate of Shaikh Jasim al tfehzaa, ex-Qadhi. An increased number of criminal cases was heard during the year owing to prosecutions in connection with price control, smuggling etc. On his succession as Huler of Bahrain, His Highness Shaikh Salman handed over charge of the appointment of President of Court of Wards to his brother, Shaikh Dua'ij bln Hamad. (b) Agency Courts The total number of civil and criminal cases decided in the Agency Courts during 1942 was 1275 and 376 respect ively; the corresponding figures for 1941 were 1633 and 244 respectively. 16. Education Bovs 1 Section Science, Geometry and Algebra were added to the subjects taught in the lanama Secondary School. Kinder- garden classes were started in HUharraq and Hedd. Village schools were enlarged. Classes for the staff in teaching- 10 - teaching methods wore held and resulted in a distinct improvement in the standard of teaching. Girls 1 Section Progress was satisfactory and there was an increase in the number of students. During the year the schools arranged entertainments in aid of the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund and of local orphans and poor students. Technical Section The new Technical School was completed during the year and good progress was maintained under the direction of the Principal, Mr. Hutchings, who visited India early in the year and purchased equipment to the value of Rs.25,000/, The first batch of five students from Kuwait completed their training and returned to Kuwait, Three Bahrain students left the school during the year to take up an advanced engineering apprenticeship with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The number of students in the school was 55.

The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) Chief Local Kepresentatjyg Mr. M.H. Lipp was General Manager and also Chief Local Representative from the beginning of the year until the 21st March when he proceeded on leave. Mr. Ward P. Anderson was appointed in his place on the 26th March 1942 andand continued in charge of these duties for the rest of the year. (ii) Production and Development A total of 6,240,627 net barrels of crude oil was produced from the Bahrain Field during the year. No new wells were drilled or completed during this period. Exploration work in the Additional Area was continued during moat of the year. (iii) Import of Arabian Crude Oil Facilities for receiving up to 35,000 barrels per day of Arabian crude oil were installed at the Zellaq Terminal. These facilities included a deep water wharf, submarine line, steam plant, pumping equipment and a new 13,000 barrel tank. An additional crude oil line from the Zellaq Terminal to the Kefinery was also installed. The quantity of Arabian crude oil imported during 1942 was approximately 4,429,000 barrels. (iv) Kefinery Preparations were made, including the installation of new pipe lines within the Kefinery Area, to increase the crude oil processing rate from the normal 33,500 barrels per calendar day, to 60,000 barrels per calendar day. The Kefinery was not called upon to process this additional crude oil and certain planned alterations to individual processing units were not,in fact, carried out. No new processing equipment was installed in the Kefinery during 1942. Large expenditure was, however, Incurred under the direction of the military authorities. During the months of May, tfune and Jbly crude runs only averaged/662,000 barrels per month or approximately 66 $ of normal crude capacity, and large sections of the refinery were- 12 - £1 'hot w«r« ihut 4«wn entirtly.

(viii) Industrial Conscription On 8 th Way a Defence Regulation (No.2 of 1942) was promulgated which prevented ©11 Company employees who were British subjects or British protected persons from leaving their employment without permission of the Political Resident or Political Agent. The measure was necessary both to prevent a wholesale exodus in the event of air raids occurring and, in general, to enable the Managements of Oil Companies to retain the services of personnel essential to their operations until replacements could be secured for them.

H.R.H. the Duke of Qloucester arrived at Bahrain on June 6 th, having flown from Lydda. He was met at the aerodrome by the Political Agent who presented to him His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and his two uncles, (Shaikhs Abdullah and Mohammad), Shaikh Said bln Maktum, the Kuler of Dubai, who was then on a visit to Bahrain, Mr. C.D. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and the senior officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force present in Bahrain. After inspecting a Guard of Honour of the State Police, His Royal Highness drove to the Agency with H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent. Later in the evening His Royal Highness, who was wearing the uniform of a Major General, visited H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain at his Manama Palace. During the visit, which lasted for some twenty minutes, the Duke of Gloucester informed His Highness that he would shortly receive a present from the British Government of two captured 106 millimetre Italian guns. Shaikh Salman, who was genuinely delighted at this announce ment, presented His Royal Highness with some pearls and with a sword, encased in a gold scabbard, which had been in the possession of the A1 Khalifah for many generations. His Royal Highness spent the night at the Agency and left for Karachi the following morning. H.H. Shaikh Salman and his uncles went to the aerodrome to see him off. His Royal Highness again passed through Bahrain on July 16th en route from Karachi to Basrah. He alighted at the MUharraq aerodrome at 11.30 a.m. and, accompanied by H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent, drove from the aerodrome to the Agency, where His Highness took leave of the Duke. Before the Shaikh left, His Royal Highness presentedpresented to him a signed photograph of himself In a silver frame. The Duke had intended to resume his flight to Basrah at 2.30 p.m. but a defect in his aeroplane made it necessary for him to postpone his departure till 6.40 p.m. The intervening period was spent by the Duke at the Agency. His Royal Highness* second visit to Bahrain confirmed the impression created by the first visit, and left in the Shaikh’s mind an indelible picture of Royal dignity, simplicity and graciousness. 18. B. Visits of British Notables (i) Mr. F.H.W. Stonehewer-Bird, C.M.G., O.B.S., His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, arrived from the mainland on the 6 th March 1942. He was accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Stonehewer Bird, Mr. Cyril Ousman, Vice-Consul, Jedda, Mrs. Ousman, and Mr. J.W. Wall, 2nd Secretary, Legation, Jedda. The party left Bahrain on the 10th March. (ii) Sir Edward Benthall arrived in Bahrain on July 10th and stayed the night at the Agency. He left for India the following day. (iii) Many high officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force visited Bahrain during the year in the course of their duties. 19. Visits of Foreign Notables (i) Mr. Alexander Kirk, United States Minister to Egypt, arrived at Bahrain in the afternoon of May 9th, having left Cairo the same morning. He was accompanied by members of the Legation Staff, by Mr. Twitchell, Head of the United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia, and by Mr. Khair ul Din ul Zarkali, Councillor to the Saudi Arabian Legation at Cairo. On the morning of May 10th* /•V &lt;3,-^ - 16 - then Mr. Kirk and his party called at the Agency and were/taken by the Political Agent to call on His Highness the Shaikh at the Manama Palace where His Highness and his uncles gave his visitors a very friendly welcome. Mr. Kirk and his party left Bahrain on the last stage of their Journey to Riyadh in the afternoon of May 10th. Mr. Kirk was visiting Saudi Arabia in order to present to His Majesty King Ibn Saud his letters of credence. (ii) Mr. James S* Moose, Charge d*Affaires, United States Legation, Jeddah, arrived on the 17th May and left on the following day. (iii) Mr. Hajib Saleh, one of His Majesty King Ibn Baud’s Ministers, arrived in Bahrain on September 24th and left on September 29th. He accompanied Lieut.-Colonel A.C. Griffin, Middle East Supply Centre representative at Jeddah, who had come to Bahrain to discuss Saudi Arabian supply problems. (iv) Mr. Twitchell and two other members of the United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia arrived in Bahrain on June 6 th for a short visit. 20. Visits of Arab Notables ? CeOS in n . (i) Shaikh Subah bin Salim as Subah, nephew of the Shaikh of Kuwait, spent a month in Bahrain as the guest of H.H. the Shaikh. (ii) The Shaikh of Ajman paid a short visit to Bahrain in May in order to condole with the A1 Khalifah on the death of Shaikh Hamad and to congratulate the new Kuler. He had flown to Bahrain from Dubai. (iii) Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, accompanied by his nephew Obaid bin Juma, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th May to condole with the A1 Khalifah on the death- 17 - death of Shaikh Hamad and to congratulate Shaikh Salman on his succession. He left on June 14th. (iv) Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad al Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujairah, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th June and called on the Political Agent on the 29th. In the course of his visit he gave expression to strong pro-British sentiments and declared his readiness to assist the British Government In any and every way open to him. After a short stay in Bahrain as the guest of H.H. Shaikh Salman, he left for the mainland en route to Riyadh. He passed through Bahrain on the 10th August, on his return from Riyadh. He was anxious to interest Petroleum Concessions Limited in the production of oil in Fujairah, but Mr. Lermitte, the Company’s representative, whom he went to see, told him that his Company would not enter into any new commitments or engagements until after the war. (v) Shaikh Fahad bin Salim as Subah, Controller of Finance in Kuwait and the son of a former ruler of that Sheikhdom, arrived in Bahrain on July 24th. He did not leave until August 19th. (vl) On November 3rd Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl the new Saudi Trade Agent in Bahrain, arrived with letters of introduction to H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent from His Majesty King Ibn Saud. 21. Local Affairs (i) On the 8 th night of Muharram (January 26th) a collision occurred between two processions, one consisting of Iranians and the other of Baharina. A general melee ensued during which a sub-inspector of police fired a shot into the air, stones were thrown and a few people injured. Intense/ / / / l j «7 Intense local excitement was caused and religious cere monies on the two concluding days of the festival were somewhat disorganised* The incident had no political significance and the temporary excitement which was caused would have died away completely in a few days if it had not been for the judicial proceedings which ensued. (ii) A Kuwaiti boom left Bahrain on the 19th February bound for Kuwait with a cargo of silver rupees and Saudi riyals to the value of more than a lakh of rupees* The boom never reached Kuwait* but the bodies of the nakhuda and five of the seven members of the crew were subsequently seen floating on the sea near Jezirat Abu Ali. A launch sent from Kuwait to search for the missing boom succeeded in locating the wreckage and in salvaging from it rupees and riyals to the value of about Hs*1*15*000* (iii) A local sensation was caused by the arrival* on May 5th* of thirteen sailors from Qatar whose dhow had been sunk by an enemy submarine. In Bahrain the sailors were hospitably treated by everyone* and were given an interview by H*H. the Shaikh. Thqy were repatriated to Qatar at the expense of the Agency. (iv) in order to provide relief for the poor of Bahrain a committee of Arabs was formed in the middle of the year under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa to collect money in Manama and MUharraq. Within a very short time of the formation of the committee* Ks.ll* 000 /- was collected from Arabs* Sunni Persians and Indians. To collections were made from the Shia community nor were the Shias invited to join the committee. The Shias felt bitterly their exclusion from participation in this philanthropic. -W -4 ■-&lt;r ■■■cgnmii % v - 19 - philanthropic undertaking, this being the first occasion for many years that a deliberate and definite distinction had been made between Shlas and other Arabs* On being told by the Adviser that there was no objection to their organising similar measures among their own community, and being assured that in the matter of affording helo the Bahrein Government would treat Sunnis and Shias alike, they collected immediately fis.7,000/-, and thereafter the rival Committees vied with each other in collecting further subscriptions. Since this rivalry seemed likely to promote serious discord, efforts were made to bring the two parties together and eventually, after much negotiation, a Joint Committee was formed containing representatives of both communities and presided over by His Highness' uncle, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. On August 29th, to celebrate the happy rapprocljment, a gijaden party was given by one of the Shia notables, which was attended by His Highness, the Adviser, and members of both Sunni and Shia Committees. (v) On September 4th it was reported from the Oil Camp at Awali that some 200 migrant birds of unknown species -rh c NcJZyJ Wts/cvij and enormou8 8 i ze had arrived. One had committed suicide by flying into the Refinery and its carcase was sent to Mr. Bertram Thomas, the Public Relations officer, ior identification. It was pronounced to be a stork and a tab round its leg reads- UNTV1SHSITS KAUNAS LITHUANIB B 3973 The fact that the local inhabitants have no name for these birds and that Bahrain notables went after them with guns, whereas in other parts of the Arab world tuiey ti- e never molested and are in places almost sacrosanct, suggests that Bahrain has seldom, if ever, seen them before. (continued)22« Koval Air Force Leviea* Two Companies of H.A.F. Levies were raised locally during the year for the protection of the aerodrome at Muharraq* Discipline was good, and they made excellent progress in their military training. 23. Defence Officials of the Bahrain Government and the Manage ment of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited rendered valuable assistance to officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force engaged on activities connected with the protection of the Island and its oil field* The Bahrain Government also organised an efficient system of Passive Air Defence. 24. Economic (i) Currency . Owing to the high prices obtainable in Iraq for gold and silver, the export from Bahrain of sovereigns and rupees reached an undesirably high level at the beginning of the year and It became necessary to place drastic restrictions on this traffic. For some time a certain amount of smuggling took place, but the adoption of further restric tive measures effectively stopped smuggling on all but a negligible scale* From July onwards illicit traffic in gold and silver practically ceased* (ii) Foodstuffs * During the year the import and distribution of food stuffs developed into a major problem. Due to restrictions on the export from India of rice, wheat, sugar and other essential commodities, and due to the irregularity of shipping, great difficulty was experienced in obtaining foodstuffs sufficient for the maintenance of Bahrain 1 s cosmopolitan- 21 - %* cosciopolitan population. The problem was further complicated by the necessity to control re-exports to Saudi Arabia. Since there was no price control in that country Bahrain merchants endeavoured to divert their goods there in order to obtain increased profits. The Bahrain Government took a number of measures with the object of bringing trade under control. The Manama Municipality opened centres in the town for the sale of sugar to the public at controlled prices. The export of all foodstuffs was prohibited, though exports to Persia of certain non-essential foodstuffs was permitted on a limited scale in exchange for esential goods brought over from that country. In June a system of card rationing for rice, flour % and wheat was introduced, and in August a Food Control Committee was appointed to assist and advise the Food Controller (Director of Customs, Bahrain) over food questions and to share his responsibility. Later in the year the administration of rationing, which had formerly been in the hands of the Director of Customs, was transferred, as far as Manama was concerned, to the Municipality. The imposition of rationing proved to be an invaluable factor in reducing consumption of essential foodstuffs; wastage was practically eliminated, extravagance was curtailed and the people were compelled by self interest to adopt habits of economy. Increased prices also, particularly among the poorer classes, contributed to reduced consumption. During the year there were several crises when the shortage of foodstuffs was felt acutely. On each occasion, however, the arrival of fresh supplies brought temporary relief. Steps were taken to obtain wheat from Canada and Australia, and the Bahrain Petroleum Company generously olaced% K: ' * 'ir- ~^hcyc n^s S&lt;jmc. 6VCY rtmovxvl &lt;j^ 4vi|/in^ ‘^G^'pment kni t n o^tkvnmr.

Petroleum Concessions Limited (1) Qatar By the end of April 1942 the third test well in the Dukhan area had reached a depth of approximately 7000 feet. Promising oil shows had been obtained in Nos. 1 and 2, but No.3 was a disappointment. There was no production In 1942. A certain amount of oil from well No.l was used on road construction and maintenance necessary to the Company 1 s exploration operations. The preparation for No.4 well was brought to an end in June when the Company received instructions to suspend its operations. (il) Trucial Coast No further exploration was attempted during the year. -iAdministration Report of the Trucial Coast for the year 1542« 1.

The Public Health Department of the Muscat municipality functioned during the year under the direction of Saiyyid Abbas bin Faisal. It's main and most important activities were anti-malarial which it continued with a fair measure of success* According to a survey made at Muscat some years ago the commonest malarial mosquito is however the Anopheles Maculapenis which is essentially a house-breeder and it is inside the houses and huts that, owing Treasury Officer Medical Officer'v ' r- ■ owing to the privacy-comp lex of the inhabitants, anti- malarial measures cannot be carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. As long as this attitude persists there is no hope of abolishing malaria* The Minicipality now has two stirrup pumps and a supply of Pyrethrum Extract and sprays huts and houses} this ought to be effective in destroying the adult mosquito and may explain the partial diminution in the number of flies. (b) Agency Hospital . The hospital was open throughout the year and was well attended* The following patients were treated Outdoor department 17,888 Indoor department 136 Minor operations 176 The chief diseases were malaria, eye infections and venereal diseases* (c) Quarantine * During the year there was a virulent epidemic of small pox on the Batinah coast and on the borders of Oman* A few cases were discovered in the town of Matrah, but these either came themselves or caught the infection from others from the coast towns. Three public vaccinators were engaged. One was stationed in Matrah where he vaccinated persons and also inspected arrivals into the town to prevent smallpox being brought in* The other two worked on the Batinah coast* A land quarantine station was established outside the village of Ruwai and was used while the epidemic lasted. The Quarantine Station at Haramil is in good repair and was used for a few cases. 3. POLITICAL SITUATION . (a) Tribal . There has been no major development in the tribal situation in Oman during the year. Grievances between tribes3 f^) i tribe b or of a tribe against the Muscat GoYernroent have been aired in interminable series of discussions, arguments, agreements, breaches of agreements and then further negotia tions culminating sometimes in a single murder but more usually in what would be regarded in a settled country as petty crime to be dealt with by the ordinary police force* Only in a state where even small tribes aseume to them selves some of the attributes of sovereign powers can such incidents be regarded as of political significance* The three important Shaikhs in Oman, Abdulla bin Mohammed al Khalil! ('the Imam'), Isa bin Saleh al Harthi, and Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of the Jabal Akhdar have not been openly activ# though such is their power, it is probably correct to assume, that they have supplied the inspiration for most of the incidents which have taken place* They have kept aloof from the Muscat Government which is equivalent to saying that they have not troubled it* The most likely reason for this is that our extension of air-power in the Sultan's territory has not 6 nly convinced them of our willingness but also of our Instant ability to support him* Also, the Shaikhs, owing to the diminution of food supplies from India have been, like everyone else, preoccupied • • in the problem of how to feed their people* The Bedou regards rice almost as synonymous with life itself and the enforced reduction by the Muscat Government of supplies to Oman has been one of the most noteworthy developments of the year* That it was carried through without more than an occasional protest from the tribes is further testimony to the increased prestige of the Sultan, exercised, as it has been for the whole year, from the distant province of Dhofar* This last circumstance also explains the distant attitude of the three premier Shaikhs who would consider it undignified and, even more Importantn \ important to them would certainly find it profitless to deel with ether than the head of the Muscat State. W hocal . The posts of Finarice Officer and Director-General of Customs were, in Fehruary&gt; amalgajiated by the Sultan in the person of Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan who was formerly Finance Officer only. Hilal bin Hamad al Mawali was appointed Wall of Quriyat in December. 4, TPADd). (i) The following table shows the value of the total imports and exports during the year 1341-42 as compared with the previous year Year. imports. ttxoorts. 1940- 41 46,28,977 &amp;« 30,22,170 1941- 42 k. 53,12,403 Ks# 38,68,298. The increase in the import figures represents an increase in the price of imports not in their quantity which, in fact, decreased. The increase in the value of exports was mainly due to the high price obtained for dates during tho year. (ii) India took practically 80% of the exports and supplied the same percentage of the imports. (iii) Cereals and textiles were the main imports, dates and salted fish by far the most important exports. (iv) The Maria Theresa thaler, the local currency, appreciated steadily during the year reaching the highest figure of 234 rupees for 100 thalers in December. At the close of the year it had never reached lower than 145 rupees for 100 thalers. Prices of local products have all to be paid for in this currency ana the poor, especially those on low rupee salaries have accordingly suffered. The thaler has a greater silver content than thethe rupee and the hoarding of silver is given as the main reason for its appreciation. (v) The price-control committee functioned during the year and the hope expressed in the previous report that it would prevent the worst forms of profiteering, has been fulfilled. It became evident, however, that to function fairly, rationing would have to be combined with price-control. This is however, a consummation never likely to be achieved in Muscat. (vi) Well-established merchants with capital behind them made good profits during the year, but some smaller men carrying on business on borrowed money suffered badly when the time came for them to repay thaler loans raised when it was cheap in relation to the rupee. There were, however, no really large failures. . THE SOUTHERN ARABIA AIR-RGUTK . (i) The development of the three Muscat aerodromes on this route was the most important of the year. At it's beginning they were practically unusable by high-performance aircraft; at it*s end they were the halting places for as I many as eighty American liberators’* per week and were being used as well by operational aircraft of the R.A.F.; V while the buildings for their ground staffs and garrisons had been completed. Started as an alternative to the ’Iraq route at a time when it seemed possible that the Axis forces might close it, the Southern Arabia route is now an important subsidiary. The Civil Aviation Department, India were responsible for its construction until in July they gave over to the authorities noted below. (ii) Salalah . After some initial difficulties concerning the agency by whom the work was to be carried out and with the local labour, work here proceeded smoothly. The Sultan’s preseence and his continuous willingness to ensure• naur* that labour supplied by him gives a full return for value received, ensured this} on the other hand his all pervasive insistence that the activities of everyone in S&amp;lalah, even in the smallest matters, must receive his placet, kept the Assistant political Agent constantly engaged in his successful endeavours to secure it for the manifold British and American operations* What cannot he otherwise described than the Pan-American Airways invasion of Salal&amp;h in the summer of the year temporarily shocked the Sultan not only by it f s method but because of the somewhat wild behaviour of the representatives of the Company who were, without his consent, stationed at Salalah. This iapression has at least been partially eradicated and, it is hoped, wholly compensated for by the conclusion with His Highness of a regular agreement for the use of his aerodromes by the U.S. Army Air Corps. Pan-American Airways no longer operate on the route. The R.A.F. at Salalah are commanded from Aden, the U.S. Army Air Transport Corps from Lagos. The Mewar State infantry are stationed at the aerodrome for its defence and works are the responsibility of the Air Ministry P.W.D. operating from Aden. (iii) Masirah . The aerodrome at Masirah Island is the best of the three — and the worst situated. The island has no governmental organisation, no anchorages, and no water. The combination of the first two defects and the apparent inability of anyone concerned to provide proper unloading facilities allied with theii 1 conviction that the local Bedouin uncontrolled by anyone could be relied upon to unload their material and not to steal it, led to a state of affairs which culminated in a minor crisis when ever a ship arrived at Masirah. The Bedou refused to unload until promised payment of fantastic sums} then he madehe made the inefficient means of unloading; — small sailing hosts — more inefficient by delays and objections to loads. When remonstrated with he struck for more money. '»Vhen the cargoes were got ashore it was often found taut they had been pilfered, while any attempt to guard them during unloading was also mot by a strike. Again and again this performance was repeated and reported upon till by the end of the year it w&amp;r&gt; evident that it would have to be stopped. By that time there was practically a whole squadron of the Royal Air Force at Masirah, a detachment of U.S.A.A.T.C. and a flying-boat base at Umrn Rasas twelve miles from the land aerodrome.

The work of the Municipality during the year has been confined practically entirely to petty repairs of buildings and roads and to clearing and cleaning. This is partially explained by the fact that its budget has remained constant while prices of all building materials have risen. Due to other more immediate pre-occupations it has not been possible to spare this department the time needed to give it the encouragement it was last noted as continually requiring. III. EDUCATION . The primary school still under the headmastership of Anwar Effendi at-Tamini has continued to do good work. IV. GENERAL,COMUNICATIQNS . (i) Cable . Cable and Wireless Limited brought a new cable into Muscat on May 24th connecting with Aden and working with that station on the 30th May. The installa tion of apparatus in connection with this and the general increase in the carrying capacity of the Gulf system necessitated an addition of eleven men to the Company's staff and the building of accommodation for the new equipment. The Muscat-Karachi cable was interrupted for a short period in January and the Muscat-Bahrain cable in January and November. Messages were sent by wireless telegraphy. (ii) Wireless * Communication with the Sultan's station atat Saialah txii*oa^u Cable &amp; Wireless Limited was discontinued from the 29th August owing to it‘a breakdown. It was however always possible to communicate with Salalah through the R.A.F. or British Overseas Airways Corporation systems. V. TRANSPORT . External . The regular British India Steam Navigation Company steamers ceased to call at Muscat during the year owing to the demands made on them for war purposes and their place was taKen by irregular calls of ships mostly chartered by the B.I. company from companies formerly operating on the Chinese coast. In all 72 steamers taking passengers and freight called during the year but as it drew to it 1 ® close their visits became more infrequent, and regular transport to and from Muscat and the outside world ceased. As a result dependence on dhow transport has increased with profitable results for their owners. Internal . The number of motor taxis available in Muscat and Matrah became fewer during the year as one old car after another went unserviceable for want of spare parts, batter ies and tyres. Motor transport on the Batinah coast is no longer to be obtained.

POLICE , v The strength of the force remained as in the previous year. Despite the fact that it has remained under the control of the ineffective Inspector, Mohammad Jawad Darwesh its discipline has remained surprisingly good, mainly due to the Havildar seconded from the Muscat Infantry. (ii) Like the Muscat Infantry the Police contains many Bilochis whose real home is in Mekran. Some of them deserted while on leave and, though measures were taken to prevent them doing so, got themselves enlisted in the R.A.F. Levies being raised at Gwadur. The pay with free rationsrations offered by the Levies is better than that given by the Police. (ill) An increase of pay from &amp;.20/- to )fe.22/- per mensem (without rations) was allowed by the Sultan for police constables. There has been a demand for a further increase. (iv) Recruitment was carried out under the same system as previously, by taking volunteers from the Muscat Infantry. It would seem that in view of the better emolu ments (infra) now granted to that force volunteers are, in future unlikely to be forthcoming and men will have to be recruited direct and trained specially for police duties. (v) Clothing and equipment are supplied to the police on payment from the Muscat Infantry. The delays in obtaining supplies from India have affected the police even more adversely than the Infantry. VII. DLFSNCS. (i) Major L.B. Hirst, 10th Gurkhas took over from Major A.O.C. Pettyfer as Military Adviser to the Muscat Government on the 7th February. (ii) Muscat Defences . The condition of the Town wall is good. The question of •facing* the wall, as originally suggested, was discarded as being an unnecessary expense. Frequent inspection gives qo indication of deterioration. A cement top is being put on to prevent seepage. The surrounding towers of the town can in case of necessity all be defended but the 'Sangars' which have been constructed are of far more value as they are practically Invisible except at close range. Mirani Fort has been completed and is in an excellent state of repair. The aerodrome is now completely covered from four underground and camouflaged dug-outs, with roofs of a minimum thickness of eight feet which should be proof against anything other than a direct hit. They are speciallylU 13 specially constructed to take modi am niachine gans. A line of eunken and cwwooflaged emplacements has been constructed between the l«ndin^ ground and the Fort in the dual role of protecting either the Fort or landing ground in the event of dive-bombing. line of Cangars is being constructed from Ruwi to the sea and this will cover all approaches to Matrah, the approaches to Muscat being already covered. Forward gun positions have been made for the artillery as the guns have insufficient 'crest clearance' to bring fire to bear in the Wataiya area from Bait-ai-Fal^ij. (iii) Batinah Coast . The important forts from a defensive point of view are In a sufficiently good state of repair to be defended in case of attack by a tribal enemy. (iv) Launch . This has done excellent work and given no trouble. She has done two trips up the Batinah and several patrols as well as numerous trips to Ras al Eadd on behalf of the political Agent. Her armament has been increased by one additional medium machine gun. (v) Wireless . All the transmitters and seven generators ordered from England early in the year were received very badly damaged and only one transmitter and two generators were able to be put into working order. Another has now been made ready and is to be sent to Dhofar. It is unlikely that the remaining can be repaired before the end of the Communication with Dhofar was maintained for a short period but was not satisfactory. Kven with powerful sets, wireless telegraphy communication between Muscat and Dhofar is very difficult during the monsoon period. (vi) Muscat Infantry . Fox' the defence of Muscat and Mat rah from Oman, a War (!) Strength . The Force remained up to strength throughoutw. V.^' TT 4 (0 /67 -14 ^lii*oughout tn© year witn the exception of a short period during which there was a rt strike M for increased pay as a result of which 119 men were discharged* At present ten more recruits are required to bring the force up to strength* The type of man now being enlisted is very much better than the majority of those discharged. Jemadar Ahmed Cher has replaced Subedar Mir Bey khan, and although not such an expert in gunnery, he is a signalling instructor and has already made a great improvement in the standard of signalling. A number of the signallers can now send and read up to the standard Indian Army rate. (2) Training . Individual and collective training has been carried out together with frequent exercises. It has been found that owing to the very low standard of education and mentality generally it is a waiste of time to teach the men too many new methods as they cannot absorb them. They are being given a thorough traning in the more simple methods. Sand table schemes and lectures were attempted but were discarded in favour of outdoor practice as they meant nothing to the N.C.O.s and men. The main lectures now consist of general lectures on the war situation, mostly with a view to making the men understand that although Muscat is not at war she is bound to be affected by it. The Recruit Training Period has been reduced from 21 weeks to 12. (3) Artillery . Rigid economy has been exercised in the expenditure of ammunition owing to the difficulties of obtaining fresh supplies. The practices that have been carried out with live ammunition have produced excellent results. The camels maintained for the transport of the guns, are being done away with and in future will be carriedcarried on M.T. This has been done mainly owing to the fact that saddlery is unobtainable. (4) Machine Guns . The training of the gunners is good and the results on Field Firing excellent. ( 5 ) Weapon Training . The course has been reduced as much as possible without losing efficiency in order to save ammunition, hesuits have been good* All nienj other than recruits,have carried out anti-aircraft and grenade training. Ali officers and men amed with the pistol have fired, the annual course laid down for the Indian Army* (d) frouipment and Clothing . Equipment is in good condition, hue to the delays in receiving supplies from India the clothing situation became so critical that it was difficult to find sufficient uniforms to dress the ordinary guards. ( 7 ; Motor Transport . The four 30-cwt. Chevrolet lorries have given excellent service hut a complete overhaul has now to be taken in hand. ( 8 ) Medical . The health of the force has, on the whole been good. There have been very few cases of malaria. There was an outbreak of smallpox which fortun ately died out rapidly; it was, however, responsible for the only death which has occurred this year. (9) Rations . Due to the general difficulty of obtaining food supplies from India and to high prices it became impossible during the year for the Infantry to supply rations to its men. Instead their pay was increased to their great discontent. The Military Adviser then took up the question with the Sultan who sanctioned the supply of a very good ration since when there has been no further difficulty. (10) Sports . Hockey and Basket Ball tournaments have been held. The annual sports were cancelled, on medical advice, due to a sudden and unexpected period ofp of excessively hot weather. Physical training is carried out three days a week by all ranks and daily by recruits. (11) MU aiSgs* (i) Minor repairs have been carried out on the Fort which is in excellent condition apart from the wooden verandahs. (ii) Minor repairs to the hospital. (iii) Five V.C.O.s quarters have now been completed! the work is of surprisingly high standard and was done by the Infantry^ own pioneers. VIII.

First the oppreghve regime of the late Shah and then, after a temporary o „£eversal when British Troops entered Iran and H.M.G's views werg broadcast, for the disorganization of the administration',' the general insecurity and the food shortage. This feeling was aggravated by the fact that the British were co-operating v/ith the hated ana feared Russians. There were sporadic outbreaks by bands of the Boir Ahmedi tribesmen which increased with the confusion foliowing the fall of the Shah. Nasir Khan ^ashyai escaped from xehran in September and established himself at Firuzabad, where he still remains, in spite of all efforts to make him submit uo xhe Persian Government.

The date crop was unusually good and grazing lasted well into the Summer. During May and June there was a shortage of vrtieat flour owing to a delay in shipments from India. The boring of Artesian Wells without the permission of the Government was prohibited. The Manamah-Muharraq sv/ing bridge was opened by Sheikh Hamad on the 18th December 1941. , The pearl season both in Bahrein and on the i Trucial Coast was an improvement on previous years. Owing to heavy rainfall the previous November and in spite of the progress of anti-malaria measures, the number of cases increased.

Chapter VIII- Holes on the working of quarantine on tne Arab Coast of the lereian Gulf. *************In spite of the troubles raging throughout the world the Persian Gulf enjoyed almost perfect peace throughout 1941 and indeed very few incidents of any kind occurred to which it it necessary to call attention. Trade was restricted through lack of shipping but the Arab States continued to receive an adequate supply of food-stuffs, though prices rose considerably. There was famine and destitution on the Persian Coast towards the end of the year but the Arab States as a whole enjoyed peace and prosperity throughout and Kuwait in particular experienced a boomowing to the increased freights earned by her ocean-going dhows• There was also internal peace and no inter—tii^al light ing of any importance took place. At sea the breakdown ol tne administration in Persia caused a revival of the arms traffic on a very small scale and a few rifles of ancient date were exported from the Arab to the Persian dJoast. Towards the end of the year one or two acts of piracy were attributed to Mirza ibn Barkat of Jask and Fujairah and the same person is also believed to have carried off some Baluchi children from the Persian coast for sale as slaves in the interior of Arabia. In December a meeting took place at Haudhat al ^ueuma # « shooting camp in Saudi Arabian territory not far from the Kuwait border^between His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait. This meeting is not believed to have had any particular political significance. In Kuwait political calm has reigned and the Shaikh co operated to his utmost in the war effort. In May the Irani -rost Office was closed and the postal business taken over by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited on behalf of the Indian iosts and Telegraphs Department. In December the Shaikh concluded an agreement with the Imperial Bank of Iran for the opening of a branch of that Bank in Kuwait.fit In Bahrain Shaikh Hamad continued to give abundant proof of hi* unawerving loyalty to the Brltiah Goremment. The pearling trade showed a slight revival owing to increased prices in pearls being offered from India. An alarming fall in ths w»tsr«l»v«l showed that the subterranean water-suppli«« have been rapped too freely and led to a prohibition of the sinking of any further wells. The Bahrain Petroleum Company were compelled to reduc production for a time owing to lack of shipping but increased it again at the end of the year. In December the Manama-Muharr.4 Causeway was opened - a work of great benefit to the general public • The various Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast lived at peace if not amity with each other and no incident occurred worthy of note • The sultan of Muscat also continued to co-operate in the war effort. He spent four months at the beginning of the year in India and in the autumn retired to Oho far for a prolonged stay. He remained however in wireless communication with Muscat and was therefore able still to take part in the direction of State affairs. At the end of the year work started on the idevelopment of the landing grounds at Bas al Hadd, Masirah Island and Salalah for use by the Eoyal Air Force. on the Persian side of the Gulf the entry of British troops into Persia caused considerable excitement and the Persia troops at Bushire turned out to resist a P 0 “ bxUJ - t landing attempt was made to interfere with the Consulate-General and all tension was relaxed as soon as the -cease fire- was ordered. Ths fall of Hiza Shah and the weakening of the Central administratis inevitably led to a certain amount of disorder. Eobb.ri.s took place on the roads and the authorities completely lost control of several cf the smaller ports south of Bushire. In addition, owing toV harvest and the Persian Government's economic policy, there was a great shortage of wheat and otM^tigitJ le s of life. The situation was relieved in the bigger centres by the despatch of large consignments of wheat and su b ar by thethe British Government, but for lack of transport and other reaaone^liita^oftan failed to reach the outlying districts where famine conditions prevailed. Thanks to the changed attitude of the Persian Government British Consular officers were able to supervise the disposal of the wheat supplied by the British Government and ensure that it was distributed as widely and fairly as circumstances permitted within the areas to whicn the. had acoe ss • The Residency suffered a grievous loss by the death of the Residency Surgeon, Lieut••Colonel J.J.Rooney, I.M.S*, which took place in April* sd* W.

The general condition of trade was worse than in 1940, owing to the war and also to the political changes which occurred oyer the last 5 months of the year. Compared with 1940, imports declined hy 13$. In fact the' real decline of Iranian trade is greater than this figure indicates since about 1500 tons of the imports were goods in transit for the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics while some 13,000 tons of wheat represented an abnormal transaction between the Indian and Iranian Governments. Exports declined by about 50^. Trade was mainly with India and secondarily with the United States of America. About 18,000 tons of imports were Government monopoly goods and trade by individual firm| was therefore snail in volume. The figures in Table # A # showing the volume of goods^ imported and exported by steamships were calculated on the same basis as last year with the exception that figures of exports to non-irrnian Gulf ports have this year been included in the main figures shown for British India steamei;' although for purposes of comparison the figures for non- Iranian Gulf ports have been shown separately in the tables. The latter figures are not however included in the main total of exports. Table ’B* is prepared on the same basis as last year, but it is still difficult, in the absence of statistics from the Customs, to show the country of destinations fcr exports. Imports and exports by sailing vessels have been larger than last year owing to the scarcity of steamers. The majority of this traffic is said to have been to the non-Iranian ports. / Shipping.w 4&gt; 1 Shl DDlQg . (a) British. As foreseen last year ttiere bas been a decline in the number of British ships in 1941. Oily 69 ships as against 113 in 1940 and 151 in 1939 called at Bushire. Only 8 ships of the Stride Line called this year as against Zl in 1940. British India steamers, however, enjoyed a greatly increased share of shipping in the G-ulf during the year. The imports and exports carried by their ships showed an aggregate in crease of 130# on the figures for 1940. (b) Foreign. Japanese. Only four ships of the Mitsui Line called at Bushire, during February-May, and imparted 628 tons of goods consisting of porcelainware, glassware, woollen yarn, matches, and sundries. The exports consisted of 471 tons of raw cotton and the balance (28 tons) largely of g c traga)§anth. iXitoh. Only one Dutch steamer of the Silver Jav. Pacific Line called at Bushire during the year under review bringing no imports but exporting 10 tons of opium for Bata\ 1| United States of America. There has been a small increase in the number of steamers from the united States of America during the year. Fourteen ships called as against 10 ships in 1940, importing 1440 tons as against 420 tons in the previous year. Imports consisted of tyres and tubes, brassware, radios, auto parts, and other general goods. Besides th&lt;=?e they imported 1428 cases of motor cars and lorries. Exports in these ships totalled 937 tons as against 812 tons in 1940 and consisted of gum tragacanth only. The ships were mostly of the Isthmian Line* Italian. Mo Italian ship called. Norwegian.

Its products have enjoyed a demand in the up country markets especially at Isfahan and Shiraz. A 30# interim dividend was paid in October, with a promise of a further 40 to 50 per cent dividend at the end of the Iranian year (22nd March 1942 Shares of Bials 5,000 each have advanced to 15,000 rials Two foreigners, a Hungarian and a Czech were engaged by mill in place of the two British officials who left last year. The prices of the mill # s cloth have almost doub'lei compared with last year's prices, and there has been a sa increase in the wages of workers and increments of from to 20 per cent in clerical salaries. The mill was idle a fortnight in November owing to lack of raw cotton. / Finance.Finance. The average weekly demand for credit for Customs clearance and forwarding charges increased hy almost 100# e.g. Bials 3 f 000 f 000 as against Bials 1,500,000 in the previo year. This, of course, is accounted for hy the •freeing* of the various items of commercial goods to private merchants,- such as sugar, tea, cotton, and piece goods. Local merchants made some profit on sugar and tea speculations although the up country merchants who are the original source of imports of such goods enjoyed a much higher profit in these specula- ti ons • Interest rates were higher with the increased demand for accommodation and shortage of cash. The Banque Mellie Iran several times held up the issue of notes and was in difficulty to meet local demands. They also restricted credits to merchants on account of the uncertainty of the political situation. While crops were not so satisfactory as in the previous year they would still have sufficed for the needs of the people if the Government had not furthered the export of considerable quantities of food grains by allowing it free to Gulf ports. Owing to the scarcity of wheat in the north of Iran due to its export to Germany in the first half of the year, stocks of Bashire wheat were sent up country by the Government monopoly. As a result there was a great shortage of wheat in the southern ports, including Bushire. The supply of wheat from India which took place in the months of October to December relieved the position and the anxiety of the population. But the supply of wheat to bakers remained insufficient and wheat was as usual only available to the pub lic in the form of bread. Dates of the same kind as those exported last year enjoyed a good market in India. The autumn rainfall was slight especially in the / immediateimmediate neighbourhood of Bushire, and it is feared that crops in 1942 will he poor. ^ages and cost of living. Wages of coolies and workmen slightly increased i during the year. Since the change in the regime the salari* of Government employees have been advanced by from 100# to 25# according to status. The cost of living has risen greatly over last year and prices of nearly all commodities have risen over 100#. Shortages of rice, meat, water, and other foodstuffs caused great discontent. Prices of matches and tobacco also advanced. The Anglo Iranian Oil Oompany Limited also in October 1941 increased prices of lubricating oil by 100#, petrol by 20# &gt;( 4kerosene oil by 10#, Further increases of from 50 to 100# in the prices of piece goods were ordered by the Government during the year and a shortage of cotton piece goods was experienced. Lorry rates increased towards the end of the year with the increase of demand for transport. show a loss owing to a diminution in sales. The following taxes were imposed by the Government during 1941 Petrol Rials 0.15 per litre. Tobacco (all kinds) 15#. Pipe tobacco 10#. Prepared opium. 40#. The Customs doubled the stamp duty on papers, The population of the town increased, as far as can be ascertained from the imperfect statistics available and from observation, from 6000 to about 11000.

Beudder Medical Officer of the Arabian Mission acted during his absence on leave. II. THE RULING FAMILY. fa) Fis Highness Ghaikh Bir Ahmad al Jabir As Subah, K.O.^.D., C.3. T *, the Ruler, did not leave Kuwait during the period under review. Most of the chief administrative posts in the Gtate are held by members of the Dibah family: - Shaikh Abdullah As Salim, Shaikh Ali al Khalifah Shaikh Fahad As Salim Shaikh Bubah As Salim Shaikh Abdullah al Ahmad Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir GTE - President of the Advisory Council. Governor of Kuwait Town and Director of Public Security. Head of the Treasury. Chief of Police. Governor of the Arsenal Chief Judge and Director of Education.-2- p-ftYltf^S ^tpoYlS Shaikh Muhammad al Jahir - Port Director. Shaikh Haraood al Jabir - President of the Municipality. (h) Shaikh AMulla As Salim, C.I.E., paid a short visit to Syria from 18th July to 15th August. (c) ShaiKh Ali al Khalifah left for Syria on the 25th August for sanatorium treatment. He returned on the 15th December. III . THH POIJTTCHI H^T -TTOTTS The Political Agent's relations with the Shaikh have remained cordial. His Highness places the war needs oC Great Britain before everything else and has always shown his willingness to cooperate. IV. LOGM IiTTSaHISTS . Kuwait politics have been remarkably quiet in spite of the disturbances which took place in Iraq in the early summer The war has brought prosperity to the Kuwait merchants and they have become more and more concerned .dth their own affairs and have taken less and less interested in the domestic politics of the house of ?ubah. This does not mean that the anti-3haikh elements have been entirely ilie, far from it, but it does mean that they have been unable to obtain any of the influential support so necessary to a successful opposition. The May in Iraq caused mild excitement in ■ i Kuwait and the anti-3haikh, ani therefore anti-British, party gained the, as it turned out, temporary allegiance of a number of waverers and His Highness appeared pre occupied in public, but it was a very minor affair and when Rashid Ali retired into Iran the pro-Nazis resumed their occupation of listening to Yunis Bahri in the seclusion of their private houses. The Shaikh and his followers were V triumphant arti Shaikh \bdullah Salim, the heir presumptive, ' retired to his estates on Halaicha Island. The Iraqi refugees, of whom there were a considerable number, regretted that they had changed their dinars into rupees atKuwaitis procseded to return to their 'business * and estates in Iraq.* ('b) Trade * A Tull report on tne imports and exports for the year will he found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non confident ial publication. (°) Customs * About the end of the year, the Customs import duty was increased from bi% to 6i% ad vaierom. The I object of the increase is to provide additional funds for the Education and *!edioal Departments. These departments will share the increased incoma between them. (d) C ouncil . The Council met from time to time and seem to have discharged their duties with discretion. (e) Medical . (i) The number of patients treated at the Indian Government Dispensary for the year was 13,336. (ii) The Kuwait medical establishment which consists of two qualified medical officers from Cyria has been augmented by the arrival of a trained nurse and midwife from Cyria. The State Dispensary is clean and well run and there ds little doubt that the doctors are capable men. fork on the State Hospital is progressing slowly partly through lack of funds and partly because the Kuwait Oovernment are not yet certain that they will be able to obtain the requisite iron girders and other fittings from India and they arc therefore unwilling to spend money on a building which may have to remain unfini shed for some years. (iii) . The American r 'ission continues to do excellent medical work. On 20th of October Dr. C.^.O. Kylrea, O.B.2., H.D., the Superintendent of the mission Hospital, retired after a period of 29 years’ work in Kuwait. He and his wife are most estimable characters and their loss will be felt, particularly by the poorer classes of the Town. Dr.L. ^cu&amp;der,-4- f.D,, ^nd Dr. Uss. H.

Very friendly relations were maintained throughout the year. Tn December the Shaikh joined Bis Majesty King Ibn laud at the Shaikh of Bahrain's Camp at Cecums. The three Arabian rulers spent a very pleasant ten days together, hawking by day and disco-arsing by night. It seems reasonable to assume from reports received that no politics were discussed and that the party was politically of no particular significance. (b) Iraq . The British occupation of Iraq, has resulted in better relations between the two countries, but there is still much room for improvement and there are, ISashlyah .

He spent a short time during the summer at his country house on the island of Umm Nasan and at the end of the year went on a hunting trip, which lasted 25 days, to Saudi .Arabia, where he was .joined by His Majesty King Ibn Baud snd His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, During Shaikh Hamad’s absence in Saudi Arabia Shaikh Salman, the Ruler’s eldest son, acted as his Deputy, Shaikh Mohammad bin ’Isa, togathar with other mem bers of the A! Khalifah family, accompanied His Highness on his hunting trip. During the year, the death occurred of Shaikh Khalifah bin Hamad bin Mohomed who obtained some notoriety many years ago by his intrigues with the Persian and Turkish Governments, He belonged to a senior branch of the Ruling Family, Bahrain Police Strength on 1st January 31st December Police 1941 1941 Indians 6 5 Arabs 329 330 Followers 35 37 370 372 Naturs Manamah 66 66 Muharraq 61 61 Defence &lt;&amp; other posts 21 41 148 168 The/-The Pol5ce Force carried out its usual training throughout the year. As » defence measure,, mounted patrols were carried out during the year by the camel and horse sections of the State Police, thus reducing to a minimum the opportunities of unauthorised persons to enter the island. The state of public security continued to be satis factory. No serious crimes came to notice during the year and the decrease in traffic accidents continued. 5. Agriculture An agricultural expert was obtained from Egypt and a committee y/ps set up to discuss methods of improving agri culture in Bahrain. There has been a tendency among local gardeners to grow a wider range of vegetables. European vegetables were grown in the experiment?! gerden at ^udeye, but this did not prove to be 9 profitable undertaking, owing to the small number of people who consume th^ju. The date crop was un usually good during the year and, owing to the great amount of rain in 1939, grazing was good end lasted well into the summer. While they were drilling structure holes for geologi cal information, the Bahaain Petroleum Company discovered that there was a danger of artesian wells failing owing to the excessive use of existing supplies of water. The Bahrain Government immediately took steps to control water consump tion by prohibiting the boring of artesian wells without per mission of the Government and by ordering that the flow of water from existing wells should be regulated by valves. 6. Mmicipalitles (1) Manamah Progress was made in the constructions of new roads. ^n important new rood was built from the Government Hospital to /■to the main Manemah-Kafa* road and much of the swamp land south of fcanamah was filled in and new roads were constructed over it. The usual town cleaning and upkeep of roads, super- gL vision of markets and nmnipal services were maintained, (ii) Muharraq Apart from the normal isunicipal services, which were maintained throughout the year, the Muharraq Munici pality concentrated their activities mainly on road-build ing. 7. Public Works The most important public work to be completed during the year was the Manamah-Muhsrraq bridge, which was built by Messrs. Holloway Brothers. The war had delayed considerably its completion, ty/o sections of the bridge being lost at sea. However, duplicates of the missing sections v ere made in the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the bridge was opened by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain on the 18th December, 1941. The administrative bj.ock cf the State Hospital was almost completed, the ground floor rooms being in occupa tion before the end of the year. The new Technical school was completed. New married lines were built on the south side of the Police Fort in place of the old huts which formerly accommodated families of the police. Electric Department. Owing chiefly tc the lighting restrictions in Bahrain, there was not the usual increase in load. The connected load on the 31st December i^l was 653 K.W., with a maximum recorded load of 168 K.W., the corresoond- ing figuresfor the previous year being 613 K.W. and 180 K.W. respectively.x 5 - Kew methods of allocating v/orking charges and assess ing depreciotion were adopted exnerimentally during 1941. Under this nev» arrangement it is expected that the net profit will bo in the neighbourhood of te 30,000 for the Arabic year 1360. the annual revenue by approximately Rs 10,000. The rates for air conditioning units were increased. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued. Approximately 450 points ^tsre added, as co/npared with 650 in the previous year, the decrease being due to general trade depression and the difficulty in obtaining wiring material. 5C air conditioning unite were in operation during the year. on the 31st December 1941 the total number of tele phone subscribers was 86. 9. Pearling Industry The pearl season was comparatively good and showed a great improvement on previous years. Though the catch was larger than that in 1940, few important pearls were found. The Indian market was very active and pearl prices in Bahrain were 50&amp; higher than during the lest year, the 'IMS highest prices bei ng paid for medium and 1m/ grade pearls. the year, and another boat built here was converted into a Electricity rates were reduced from 7 as. to 6 as. per unit and it is estimated that this reduction willd ecrease There was an increase in the number of diving boats and all boats made a profit. During the 1941 222 pearling craft were in operation, while in 1940 only 191 operated. 10. Customs The Customs revenue amounted to Ps 8,04,089, as com pared with Rs 8,91,721 during the year 1940. 11.

Accidents within port limits (1) On the 2nd March 1941, « local criift on her return to Bp hr n in frer the neighbourhood of «Teduxn island encountered strong winds and capsized. L.T. u NearchU8 f *, who was in the neighbourhood, sent out her motor launch and rescued the crew. (ii) On the 13th March 1941, e local craft bound for ^ubai encountered a strong north wind, ^he nakhuda, in an attempt to secure shelter in the creek of the Gnlali, struck on the reef, the rudder broke and the boat capsized. The Port Officer on hearing of T&gt;h &lt;3 accident sent out rescue parties and the men and oxrgo were saved. (ill) on the 11th December 1941, R.T. 'Sandra* arrived with two fresh-water steel barges in tow, snd anchored near the West Ip it puoy. The approach wps made in heavy weather, 'ihe same night one of the barges capsized and sank alongside the steamer* The barge, which was for some time a danger to navigation, was later salvaged. 13. Medical (1) Victoria Memorial Hospital Captain R. Holmes, I.M.D., held charge from the 1st January to 1st June 1941, from which date Dr. P.L. • bteele • I.K.D., held charge till the 31st December. 1941 1940 Cut-patients treated 19,602 18,828 In-patients treated ^14 59 Operntions ^36 1,237Repairs on a large scale were carried ouii to the hospital building during the year.

In spite of great progress in uhe anti-malarial work organized b&gt; the Bahrain Government in sheas surround ing ^anamah, Muharraq, Sitra i;nd Buddiya, the number of cases treated for malaria showed an increase over that of the previous year. The recrudescence of malaria during the year under report was largely brought about by the heavy rainfall of the previous November, which caused pockets of water and damp areas to remain for great lengths of time. Venereal /-Venereal diseases are &amp;eing systeraauically attacked by all hospitals, with regular courses of treatment and injections. But patients suffering from these diseases continue to consult local hakims and seem reluctant to undergo regular courses of treatment on modem lines. Late in August a small epidemic of smallpox broke out. Those effected were segregated on the Quarantine island till free of infection, at the expense of the Bahrain Govern ment. About 12,300 vaccinations were carried out by the three hospitals. 14. Post Office Mr* Kanwar dinga held charge as suo-postmaster throughout the year. 1941 1S42 7G43 8223 10130 11778 5706 6258 500 594 No. of registered letters received No. of registered letters despatched No. of registered parcels received No. of registered parcels despatched Commission on foonev Orders from Bahrain h 9555/5 Rs 9111 Total sale of stamps R* 129074 102979 British Postal Orders sold £ ^ r. £ Coamissions on Indian Postal Orders sold Rs 34/10 68/14 Pevenue on unpaid letters ^ 601/1 Rs 774/10 Total 'Revenue &amp; 139274/7 Rs 160597/6 16• J udicial (a) Bair r in Govarranen t Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad, the fifth son of Hie Highness, retired from the Bahrain Court at hia own wish for personal reasons ^nd His Highness appointed another son, Shaikh Daij, to act for him. Later in the year, Shaikh Abdullah acted for Shaikh Daij for a brief period during the latter* absence, and again retired when Shaikh Daij returned. Ihe&amp;e changes did not contribute to the effi- F ciency of the Court. Shsiljdi Ahmed bin Hamad A1 Khalifah was appointed magistrate in the Small Court. Shaikh Mohammed bin Saleh Abdul Latif was appointed Sunni Share Qadhi in place of Shaikh Abdul Latif binMohammad. The new Qadhi has a broader outlook and Is less bigoted than his two fellow judges. He Is of Persian origin and is related by marriage to His Highness. Apart from several large estate cases, no case of particular interest or importance was heard in the Courts, The Minors Department did good work throughout the year and dealt with an increasingly large number of estates. This department is under the presidentship of :»h»ikh caiman bin Hamad al Khalifah and is one of the most successful innovations of recent years. It is still opposed by the Sunni Oadhis and other interested persons but in spite of this it is thriving and doing useful work. The Committee of the Shia Wakf Department completed its term of office and a new election is to be held early in the new year. (b) Agency Courts The total number of civil and criminal cases decided in the Agency and the Senior Joint Courts during the year 1941 was 1633 and 244 respectively. This represents an increase of 247 on the civil side and a decrease of 50 on the criminal side as compared with the preceding year. There were in addition a few cases under the various Defence Regulations made under the Persian Gulf states (Emergency) Order in Council, 1939, relating to profiteer ing, non-observance of black-out regulations, infringement of censorship regulations, etc. 16. Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) Ohlef Local Representative Dr. R.A. Kennedy, acting Chief Local Hapreeentative^ after Lieutenant-Commander J.3. Black relinquished this post for active service, was relieved by Mr. M.H. Lipp, General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, on the 1st /-1st June 1941. Mr. Lipp carried out the duties of both Chief Local Representative and General Manager for the remainder of the year. (ii) Field Development No work of development was undertaken by the Com pany during the year. The main First and Second ■‘ay Pro ducing Zones are provided with sufficient points of with drawal to afford satisfactory drainage of the main reser voir within the recognised producing area, '’ells drilled and completed in 1939 and 1940 provided valuable data, the application of which may make increased production possible and justify their further development. (iii) Well Repair The policy of correcting in its initial stages un satisfactory mechanical condition was continued by the Company. Besides minor repair work carried out on a large number of wells, major repairs on two wells were success fully accomplished. •v (iv) Production Total oil production during 1941 amounted to 6.794.157 barrels, giving an average of 18,614 barrels ^ I \ w a day. Owing to the lack of shipping facilities \the daily production rate was reduced from 20,000 to 15,000 barrels on the 15th September, but this figure was raised to 18,000 barrels on the 28th December 1941. The average water production for the year was 720 barrels a day as compared with 723 barrels a day V in 1940. The reduced rate of oil production towards this end of the year was chiefly responsible for this decline (v) Additional Area Drilling of structure holes for geological informa- tion waa carried out by the Company during the year. The /- \\ S C17/- - 11- 2 eommtrtce 6&gt;-r 3ii3/^i The drilling programme was somewhat interrupted by con ditions arising from the war but some important informa tion, was obtained, though this is as yet insu ficient to justify any positive conclusions• (vi) Refinery Area Alterations and additions were made in the Power, SO , Cracking and Polymer plants, Crude Distillation Mnit 2 and tankage. No new operating facilities were installed during the year. (vii) Minor operational facilities were introduced, orthe existing ones improved, at Sitra, Jebel Camp, Zellaq, Rafa* and Awali. In the main residential areas for Company employees progress was made in the development of housing and recreational facilities. Following the air raid by Italian aircraft in September 1940, the Bahrain Petroleum Company were anxious to introduce a system of wireless telephony, for operation between their offices in Bahrain and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company on the mainland, for defence purposes. Subsequently the Company intimated that this facility was necessary for operational purposes also, to provide for the safety of barges hauling crude oil from the mainland to Bahrain. The matter was still under con sideration at the end of the year. (viii) Royalty to the Bahrain G overnment For the first half of 1941 ... Rs 15,23,353 - 1 -0 For the second half of 1941 ...

Visits of Arab Notables (i)'Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahma of Baraimi paid a visit to the Political Agent on the 13th March. He expressed his sympathy for the British cause. (ii) A party of Saudi officials, mostly Hedjazis, visited Bahrain in the latter half of April 1941. The party included Abdul Rauf el Sabban, now President of the Advisory Council in Mecca, who was formerly, in the days of King Hussein, Editor of ”A1 ^ibleh”, the official paper of the Hedjaz Government. i (ill)/-(iii) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, paid a short visit to Bahrain during August 1941 for medical treatment* (iv) Shaikhs Humaid and Abdullah bin Muhammad, nephews ol of the Ruler of Has al Khaimah, arrived in Bahrain on the 28th August by sea.

(vii) Shaikh Saif el Midfa 1 , Oadhi of Sharjah, came to Bahrain early In October 1941 bringing a present of four camels for His Highness the Shaikh. His Highness gave him a present of Bs 1000/-. 20. Local Affairs (i) On the 22nd January 1941 a census was held through out the islands by the Bahrain Government. There were the inevitable rumours amongst the population regarding the object of the census, though there was no opposition to it. The census was rumoured to be a prelude to such varied measures as the introduction of identity cards, the introduction of conscription, the expulsion of Iranians 3 and compulsory medical examination. The census returns supplied the following information i-- 14 - s— Total population Number of stone houses^ amaras and shops Number of saf houses Males or females Literate or Illiterate Nationality and Religion The total population of Bahrain was found to number 89,970 persons, of whom 27,835 lived in Hanamah and 17,775 in Muharraq; 74,040 were Bahrainis and 15,930 were foreigners. (ii) During the months of May and June, 1941, there was an acute shortage of wheat flour and bread in Bahrain, owing to shipments of flour from India having been delayed. To begin with only a few small consignments were received by dhows but the position subsequently improved when B. I. steamers resumed a more regular service to Bahrain. 21. Petroleum Concessions Limited (i) n atar Exploration (a) Wells and Drilling No. 2 well was completed on the 9th June 1941 at a depth of 6206 ft. at which point a promising oil ,, 3 howing ,, was struck. No. 3 well, about 4 kilometres east of the Company^ Camp at Dukhan, was spudded In on the 1st September 1941 and by the end of the year had reached a depth of 5138 ft. There was no production in 1941. A certain amount of oil from well No. 1 was used on road construction and maintenance necessary to the Company’s further exploration operations. (b) Staff On on average personnel in ^atar consisted of j 8 British 5 American 46 Indians (clerks, artisans, servants) / , 300 Oataris and other miscellaneous nationals These figures do not include the Company* s staff stationed in Bahrain, viz x- i 2 British 12 Indians (clerks and servants) 20 Bahrainis- 15 - (c) Water &gt; No potable artesian water has be&lt;*n located in Qatar. At the end of the year a proposal to establish a small condensing plant in the Company* s Camp in Dukhan was under consideration. (d) On the whole the health of the Camp has been good. —.There were a number of cases of smallpox in the villages amongst the local people but precautionary measures taken in the Company* s Camp proved successful. (e &gt; General Halations between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Company have been friendly* though the Shaikh*s interference in the Company* s recruitment and administration of local labour causes a certain amount of friction. (ii) Truciel Coast Exploration On account of the war no fresh geological explora tion was undertaken. The various rulers were aoparently content to receive their periodical concession payments and some of them were probably glad that assumption of the responsibilities which will devolve upon them when the Company starts active operations was postponed.Administration Report of the Truclal Coast for'~the year 19^1 * 1* Truela1 Shaikhs The following were the ruling Shaikhs of the Truela1 Coast throughout the year (1) Dubai (2) Sharjah (3) Abu Dhabi (4) Um al Qaiwain (5) Ajman Shaikh Sa*id bln Maktum, C.3.S.

There was again a break of smallpox during the month of December.V* f f ft'*. ste ff - 18 - On both occasions vaccine lymph was ordered at once and vaccination was carried out at various places on the Trucial Coast. 8. Raids and Disturbances (i) The Sultan of Muscat did not agree with the peace terms settled by his Wali of Khasab with the Regent of Kalba in the presence of the Shaikhs of Fujairah and Bakhah. In particular he objected to the retention cf a small tower built for protection in Diba during the actual fighting in the month of November 1940. In the month of January the Shahuh resumed their activities against the awaesim at Diba-Hisn. On the 30th Lterch 1941 Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, nephew of the Regent cf Kalba, occupied Wadi Madha in which there are throe villages - Madha, Ghuna and Hayar Bani Hamid in the Shamaliyah District. This aggravat ed the situation and hostilities on a large scale were resumed be tv/sen the Shahuh and the Oawasim. On the 15th April the Wali of Shinas, All bin Liudhaffar, succeeded, through the help of the Shaikhs of Fujairah and Abu Baqar&amp;h, in arranging a two months* truce pv 3 nding a final agreement between the Rogont of Kalba and the iuscat autho rities. On the 10th June hostilities were again resumed between the Oawasim and ths Shahuh at Diba as a result a few men ware killed and wounded on both sides. In July the Sultan of Muscat deputed Saiyld Ahmad bin Ibrahim to settle matters with the Qawasim. Owing to the uncompromis ing attitude of both sides no final agreement was reached but the truce was extended for another two months so as to give time to the Regent of Kalba to meet the Sultan and settle the matter v/ith him. On the ICth A ugust the Regent of Kalba left for Muscat where he stayed for 11 days and then returned to Kalba. No agreement was reached between the parties and the matter was postponed for another two months./-19 months. In December the Sultan again deputed Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim to settle matters between the 'Wasim and the Shahuh but was not successful. When he was on his way back to Muscat he called at Fujairah and with the help of the Shaikh of Fujairah agreed with the Hegent of Kelba to remove the upper portion of the tower ('Murabba 1 ah') in return for which the Muscat Government would compensate the Regent with Ps 600/-. The Regent of Kalba sent men on his behalf who apparently did some demolition and he then sent a messenger to Muscat that he had fulfilled his part of the agreement and asked for Rs 600/- • At the same time the Shahuh also sent a messenger that the Regent had only taken off the upper battleT ments of the tower, which was not sufficient according to the agreement. The Sultan’s Representative refused to pay and sent a reply to the Regent that no money would be paid unless he did the demolition agreed upon# (ii) On the 2nd October Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed, Regent of Kalba, moved from Ajman to Hira with his brother, nephews and all members of their families contrary to the terms of paragraph 6 of the agreement dated the 24th June 1927 accord ing to which he undertook to keep out cf Sharjah territory. He was induced by the Residency Agent to leave Hira. He left for Dhaid on the 20th October. Later he was induced by his \ \ nephew, Humaid bin Abdullah, to return to Hire. Efforts were Jointly made by the Political Officer and the Residency Agent to induce him to leave and these were successful# After arranging with the Shaikh of Dubai to live at Dubai as an ordinary resident, Shaikh Khalid, his brother* nephews and ^ members of their families moved to Dubai. 9. Pearling Both the catch and the prices were good as compared with last year. The prices increased by 100 % at the plose of the season. This helped the local inhabitants, though only for a short time, to cope with the cost of foodstuffs which /-CHAPTER VII .

A Public Health Department has now been started as a branch of the Municipality, which has made a very good start on its anti-malaria campaign under Saiyid Abbas bin Faisal. This has consisted of oiling wells and searching houses for larvae. J This search is particularly carried out in houses in the vicinity of the houses of patients reporting with malaria to the Agency Hospital. It is hoped later to extend this department’s activities by public instruction on the anti-malaria topic, andMB m v policy l&gt; '■ when funds permit, spraying of houses with Pyrocide solution. Sanitary works are reported in Part II under Municipality. (b) . Agency Hospital . The hospital was open throughout the year and was well attended by the public. The following patients were treated *- H Out Patient rt Department - 23,192 persons. Admitted into the hospital - 95 persons. Major and minor operations performed - 380. The chief diseases were malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal infections and eye infections. (c) . Quarantine . At the end of the year smallpox became somewhat serious at Birkah, on the Batinah, and at Nakhl, in Oman. There were several cases in Matrah and some deaths. A land quarantine station has been opened at Kuwi, to the east of Matrah, where local cases ana contacts are segregated, instead of at Haramil, the sea quarantine station. A vaccinator has been daily on duty at Ghureifa, to vaccinate persons arriving from infected zones by land; and persons arriving by sea from Birkah have been vaccinated by the Agency Hospital on their arrival. 3.

A squabble has been in progress at Dibah during the whole of the year between the two clans which inhabit the two parts of the town, the Jawasim (which have now come under the control of kalba) and the Shihuh (who are subject to Muscat), business has been characterized by all the usual formalities attendant on such incidents, truces and breaches of truces, negotiations and protraction of negotiations, and a note-worthy absence of casualties. At the close of the year, a settlement was made by Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, the Minister for Internal he vi3 Affairs, after spending over a month on the spot, which fulfilled all the Muscat requirements. It remains to be seen at what expenditure it was obtained, and how long it will last. An unsettling influence on the situation appears to be exerted by the personality of Sheikh Humaid bi n Ab dullah, the nephew of the Regent of Kalba. There were perennial quarrels in the time of Sheikh Ahmad bin Rashid (before Kalba took over the Husn part of Dibah); but they were more easily composed. (ii) . The feud between the Beni Bu Ali and Beni Hassan tribes in Ja f alan has also continued during the year, and there has on one occasion been something like serious fighting. The Sultan intervened in the dispute when on his visit to Sur in September, and paid out 3,(XX) Maria Theresa thalers to the Beni Bu Ali and 500 to the Beni Hassan. This cannot, however, be regarded as the end of the matter, the more so as there is now a fresh blood feud to fight about (the murder of the head Qadhi of the Beni Bu Ali, last year) 5 and affairs in the interior of Sur are likely to continue unsettled. (iii) . The most note-worthy event of the year was the occupation of Ibri by the Imam in February, when he appointed a Wali, Mohammed bin Salim ar Raqa'shi, who was still there at ;he end of the year. The action of the Imam was originally prompted by the murder of some of his followers by men of the Beni Kalban tribe, who live near the head of the Wadi Hawasinah. When the Imam collected what seems to have been quite a considerable force, and advanced on Ibri, the Beni Kalban appealed to Muscat for help. Little, however, was done for them. The Imam's army was eventually disbanded on Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar (the leading figure of Jebel Akhdar politics) guaranteeing the good behaviour of the Ghafiri tribes. (b). Local . The following appointments have been made to Wilayats • •4 Salim bin Humaiu appointed *ali of Quriyat in January. Hamaa bin Hilal as Somar (ex-Wali of Quriyat) appointed ssali of Gwadur in January. Hamood bin Abmad (ex-Wali of Gwadur) appointed Wali of Sib in April. Sultan bin Hamood appointed Wali of Quriyat in October. Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan, formerly Treasury Officer of the Agency, was appointed Finance Officer on the 6th October. 4. JUDICIAL . Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 6. TRAPS . (i). The following table shows the total imports and exports during the year 1940-41 as compared with the figures for previous ye are s- Tear. Imoorts. Exoorts. 1938-39. Rs. 48,76,193. Rs. 33,31,939. 1939-40. Rs. 46,49,766. Rs. 34,65,795. 1940-41. Rs. 46,28,977. Rs. 30,22,170. The approximate maintenance of the value of imports should not give a false impression of prosperity, as it merely means that a fall in the quantity of imports has corresponded to the rise in the price of commodities. In the case of rice, the most essential food stuff, imports fill by 46 thousand bags. The average rise in the level of the price of essential food-stuffs is nearing the K» marie, the effect of which on the poorer classes may be imagined. They have naturally had to restrict consumption, and imports have therefore dropped. (ii). The rise in steamer freights has played its part in forcing prices up. To Bombay, the rise is nearly 60* ana to Colombo 20*. Dhows are consequently at a premium, and a good dhow may nearly pey for itself in a single voyage. tjtdbA **.mmmm 5 * &lt;1 6 - (tip ^ ^ (iii) . On the export side, the market for sardines and fish meal has almost entirely disappeared as a result of the British navel blockadej and since the outbreak of war in the Far East, the market for shark-fins has also gone. The export of dates maintained its level during the past year, though Iraq is now appearing as a competitor in the dry date market. Exports of limes dropped as a result of a bad crop. (iv) . For most of the year the Maria Theresa thaler remained more or less at parity with the rupee; but towards the end of the year there was a sharp rise in the price of silver caused by the outbreak of war with Japan. (v) • India is now beginning to get a good hold on the local market for cheap fabrics and matches, which was formerly held by Japan. (vi) . A price control committee has been functioning throughout the year. *hile it has not entirely succeedea in its aim, it has probably prevented the worse forms of profiteering. Towards the end of the year, the method of calculating the basic price was reviewed and revised. (vii) . At the close of the year, the question of the formation of a Majlis at-TiJara was under consideration and preliminary discussion^ with the State authorities. 6. BOYAL NAVY A ND ROYAL AIR FORCE. (a). Ro ya l .. N avy. A cruiser flying the flag of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, steamed across the entrance to the Muscat harbour on the 26th April. (b). Roval Air Force. The Royal Air Force maintained their wireless station at Muscat throughout the year. The staff at present consists of three European operators. The station is in direct wireless communication with Shaibah and Habbaniyah in ^raq. Visits of Royal Air Force aircraft to Muscat are given in Appendix 'k' to this report. i7. PIRACY . (VKJ During the early and middle parts of the year, an Iranian Baluchi named Mirza bin Birkat was carrying on slaving and piracy from a base in Fujairah, where he enjoyed the protection of the Sheikh. He was subsequently evicted on pressure being brought to bear on the Sheikh through the 4ali of Sohar; and the Political Agent, Bahrain, who later visited Fujairah, found that he had shifted his headquarters, and cautioned the Sheikh against receiving him again. At the close of the year, he was reported to be based near Jask (he is a Jaski). s. The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. 9 . msmm The evangelical work of the American South Arabian Kiss ion (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) has been carried on by the Rev. and Mrs. Dykstra. They left for their usual hot weather visit to South India in August and returned in October. Dr. W.w. Thomjg remained in charge of the medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah; and he has a new assistant, Dr. Job. 10. During the year thirty-eight slaves applied for manumission certificates and twenty-seven slaves were manumitted. Of the thirty-eight applicants twenty-two were captured slaves (of whom fifteen were manumitted) and the remainder were domestic slaves • U. WttATKgR- The total rainfall during the year was 0.63 inches. The lack of rain was felt throughout the year and the local drinking water supply has become unpleasantly salt. The summer this year was one of the most intolerable ever experienced.1. Hin.ING FAMILY. (a). Hift Hiahnes n Saivid Said bin Taimur. ■ The Sultan spent about four months in India in the, early ft part of the year, where he met his father, SaiyiQ Taimur bin 1 Faisal. He left for Dhofar in the autumn, where he gi-' indication of intending to make a prolonged stay. This matter is, jr however, less of a disadvantage then previously, as uhofar nas J now been linked with Muscat by W/T and aircraft are visiting it 1 comparatively frequently. His Highness's attitude has remained | correct and cordial throughout the year. | (h). s^ivid Shahab X&gt;jn Fai^. | He has continued as Minister for external .affairs, and | at the close of the year was officiating, as usual, as His j Highness's Representative during the latter's absence in Dhofar. | , His favourite 'delaying action' tactics of ending a discussion -jj or a correspondence by saying that it must be referred to the | Sultan, has lost much of its (to him) value by the Increased ease j with which such reference can now be made. (c) . Saivid Ahmad bin Ibrahjm. ^ He has continued as Minister for Internal Affairs; but |I1 has chiefly distinguished himself in the field of external affairs,! where he brought to a successful close the protracted j negotiations following the dispute between the Shihuh and the | Jawaslm in Dibah. (d) . Salvld Mahmood bin Mohammed bjn Tyirkl* * ■ He has continued as Wall of Birkah throughout the year; j: and though his thoughts may occasionally rest on the fact that j his father was an elder brother to the Sultan's grand-father, 1 Faisal (but excluded from the succession owing to his mental : condition), it does not appear that his thoughts are in serious j danger of crystallizing.8 e&lt;5 lo (•). Saivld Tar I k bin Taimur. He has contlnuad to work, at Bait-al-Falaj, and is no &gt; jemadar and in charge of the machine gun platoon} he continues to show great keenness in his work. His private activities had at one stage a somewhat injurious effect on his health; hut this has not prevented him from being married to a grand-daughter of the &lt;«ali of Nakhl. His bride ha* not Joined him at the close of the year, and it is not known when sha will ba sent. (f) . ' Mr. T.F.X. A1 3a»ed '. He has remained in India, and at the close of the year had gone up to Poona. There have been sundry rumours of his intention, to visit Muscat, but they appear to have only a shadowy foundation. (g) . Saivia Fahr bin Taimyr. He has continued to study at Mayo College, AJmere, despite the Sultan's desire at one stage (possibly for reasons of economy rather than for the ostensible reason of dissatisfaction *itn Saiyid Fahr's progress) to withdraw him. (h) . salvia Dhi.vab bio Fahad frjn lAgfei- He was in France at the time of the German occupation and spent some time in a Nazi concentration camp. He was subsequently released, and when last heard of was living in Paris. rhe problem of getting money to him for his expenses, or to enable him to get o ^ 0 f France, has presented considerable (and probably insupei aeie) f*”' difficulties. 2 . and comm* This subject has already been dealt with in Part I of this report 3. MUNICIPA^m. The Municipality have continued to carry out general clearances and demolitions in the towns, and work on the motor road over the pass between Muscat and Matrah. Two minor public works, a laterine and a bridge (with revetment of the sides of the creek; havebean carried through. A fresh budget has been prepared, providing for several new public works, mostly of a sanitary nature. For the largest - the construction of a fish-cleaning ghat at a suitable distance away from the town of Matrah, as a preferable alternative to the foreshore - an advance is to be made from the Treasury. A new house tax is to be imposed, to provide independent funds for the Public Health Department. This Department, in a single year’s work, in Muscat, has reduced the incidence of malaria indoor patients at the Agency Hospital to half the previous year s Inumber. The number of Out patients dropped by one fifth. The electric department is now to be placed under the administration of the Municipality. It has previously been managed in a general way by the Treasury, through a clerk. The Municipality is, however, a department which requires continual encouragement. up to the fifth standard, where the boys can do arithmetic of me&lt; difficulty and have a good grounding in English. It is hoped t« get the top class up to leaving certificate level in the course &lt; sent to the Bahrain secondary school in the autumn. The experi was far from a success. Apparently their experiences in Iraq b unfitted the boys for life in a school with any form of discipli has been considered, and at present the idea of training some of as wireless operators is being pushed forward. it may also be possible to teach short hand and typing. 5. GENERAL CQI fflfUNICATIQNS. the next year. (ii). Six boys, who had previously been at school in Iraq, and at the end of the year their return from Bahrain was expected. The wireless equipment ordered by the Sultan from England in January, 1940, had still not arrived at the end of the year,- 10 - £mi ~ } 7 though it was learnt that .t had been shipped on the 20th October. At the moment of writing, there is some reason to think, that they may have been commandeered for military purposes on their arrival in India, though this is unconfirmed. (ii) . Two sets have, however, been locally purchased i rom the Officer-in-Charge, Gable &amp; tireless Limited, and have been installed, one at Bait-al-Falaj and one at Dhofar. The 'tate thus has now daily W/T communication with the Sultan. (iii) . Four cable interruptions took place during the year*. Three were due to faults in the cable and one due to the diversion of the Muscat - Bushire cable to Muscat - Bahrain. (iv) . The new shortwave set installed at Muscat under Colonial Wireless Scheme, has been tested with royal Air Force | W/T station at Shaibah, Cable &amp; Wireless W/T stations at Kuwait and Bahrain, British Overseas Airways Corporations’e ^/T stations at Sharjah and Jiwani, Government Telegraph Department’s W/T station at Karachi and Sastern Telegraph Company's W/T station at Aden, and satisfactory results obtained at various times of day and night. 6. fQbiQjk- (i) . On the 1st January, 1941, the strength of the Police Force was increased to one Havildar, one Naik, tnree Lance Naiks and thirty Constables. This slight increase was necessary on account of the increased traffic control and night patrol duties, which are fairly heavy. (ii) . In spite of receiving many replies to an advertisement, and obtaining the assistance of the Inspector-General of Police, Sind, no suitable substitute could be found for Mr. Azizullan, the retired Superintendent. The few possible applicants all later backed out for some reason or other} and finally Mr. Mohammed Jawad Carwash, who was originally employed as a police clerk and who had been acting as inspector, was confirmed in his appointment. His Highness the Sultan has decided to let this arrangementcontinue for the present. (ill). The discipline, which had under dr. Azizullah been poor , has greatly improved. To avoid time wasted in training new recruits, vacancies are now filled by transfers from the Muscat Infantry. This system has proved very satisfactory. throughout the year under Major A.O.C. Pettyfer, Military Adviser to the Muscat Government. Discipline is good; and the standard of training is being raised, and brought into line with the Indian U Corps, and produced satisfactory progress before he returned la in February. Extra men are now being trained for is duties on the six W/T sets which have been expected from for many months. An artillery platoon, armed with 2.75 ■s' (mobile) and 3-pounder guns (stationary) is being trained Indian Artillery Jemadar; and carried out practice with aVu ^aeii during the year with good results. The machine gun platoon is now equipped with pack transport. The Levy owns four 30-cwt Chevrolet lorries, which have given good service throughout the year. Company and P a ttalion exercises have been carried out, and a short practice mobile column was done at the beginning of the j year. The sick r^te has remained low, with a decided decrease in malaria. A hotkey tournament and a sports meeting were held during the year; ajid physical training parades take place owice | a week. '■ \| J A sa^iefactory innovation has been a slight reduction of pay, and the issue of free rations in lieu. This has had a marked effec t on the physique and energy of the men. in the handling of a rifle and have fired a special short musketry course. 7. MUSCAT INFANTRY . In addition to normal police work, all men are trained The training of the Muscat Infantry has continued system. A signalling naik was deputed from the IndianI4. STAIK FINANCES . (i). The revenue for the year totalled 7 lakhs, 80 thousand, or 30 thousand more than the budget figure. The expenditure was 6 lakhs, 68 thousand, or 1 thousand more than the budget figure. At the close of the year the State held over 3^ lakhs in cash and had investments of over a lakh and a third. Its nett financial position on 31st December was just 6 lakhs. (ii). To this should be added one lakh saved from the Sultan’s war subsidy, plus a reserve of perhaps 30 thousand which is under (iii). Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan, formerly treasury officer in the Muscat Agency, was appointed Finance Officer to the Muscat Government in October. He has carried out useful which shows material advances over previous budgets, and should lead to a general improvement in the accounting and allotment of (a) . War Measures . Towards the end of the year, the scheme for the devel ment of the South Arabian air route began to take shape, and vi to Salalah, Has al Hadd and Masirah Island were made by aviatic engineers, accompanying the Political Agent. Work was startec the landing ground at Salalah by the Sultan's engineerj an over was installed at Has al Hadd to start work on the landing grour there $ and the Muscat aerodrome was enlarged under the super vi of the Agency overseer. The visit to Masirah Island produced satisfactory contact with the Sheikh, and reconnaissances of ar aerodrome and a sea alighting area were carried out by the air personnel. (b) .

Towers on the surrounding hills halve not been repaired, but they would afford quite good protection as they are should it be found necessary to occupy them. An additional four pmon sangars have been constructed by the Infantry at places considered most necessary. Repairs to Merani fort are now almost complete and the work remaining to be done is not of any vital importance from a defence point of view. (ii) . Repairs to the forts along the Batinah Coast progressed very slowly, but the essential work, such as the outer walls, have in most cases been completed. (iii) . The defence launch arrived from Kuwait at the end ^ of May. A considerable amount of work remained to be done fitting it out for use and this has recently been completed. The J '.ui accompanied His Highness to Sur when he visited that place in August, and it also went to Dhofar in October. Recently it has carried out a reconnaissance patrol along the coast as far as Ras al Hadd. The armament of the launch consists of one .'.axim gun, mounted forward, and one Vickers Berthier gun, which can be used t&lt; fire in any direction. Tests so far carried out have been satisf. ory, but the gunners still require a good deal of practice.^^ Sd./ J.BeHowes Political Agent, Muscat. ,' 4. ^ &gt;1 ISftfl?

The best of the five sites offered by the Shaikh of Dubai was chosen. The plans of the hospital were sent to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and steps are being taken to erect the hospital. Epidemics. An epidemic of snall-pox late^ in 1941, in °ahrain, tested the capacity of the Quarantine station of that port. The matter of isolation of cases and contacts has been taken up in a very effective manner by the Government of Bahrain. The Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah show a very lively inter est in the prevention of the spread of small-nox by vac cination and isolation of all cases. Buildings .

Gp.685 FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. This Report, though out of date, is interesting, particularly the Chapters which deal with the Persian side of the Gulf. They show that many of the evils, suchjas the rising cost of living, the corruption of the Persian administration and unrest among, the tribes, which are now manifest, were in existence under the ex-Shah’s regime and that then, as now, the British were blamed for that state of affairs. Attention is invited to Colonel Prior’s Review of the Year, ^ iitj. Other points of interest are:- 4 . Chapter I . Bushire (pages 1-8) . At the beginning of the Persian year the Revenue Department was divided intone venue Department, which assessed taxes as arbitrarily as ever, and an Economics Department which cont rotted Government monopolies. All Departments of the Persian administration were accessible to bribes as always. A number of the road-guards were replaced by conscripts. The local piornoi-uael/4 peaeantej j i n n n ml finding their exactions as severe as those of the road-guards^ lost no opportunity to make things difficult. Three sub-Govemorships were abolished during the year and the duties performed^very unsatisfactorily, by rapacious subordinate officials. Ali Ismail, a Dashti tribal chief - of whom we have —« been hearing a great deal lately - gave the local authorities considerable trouble throughout the year. Conditions in Bushire town were bad owing to increased unemployment and rising prices. Trade declined and stocks kept in the Customs were reduced by the end of the year. The general position of the Etemadieh spinning and weaving mill^ improved. Debts were paid off and more employees taken on. Chapter III Shiraz (pages 16-18) . ... 'The year was one of increasing hardship and TAe £ discontent' due partly to the war and partly to internal ^ - fh«xC f\jL conditions - diminishing trade, corrupt officials and rising prices, all of which evils were blamed on the British,who were thought to support Re»a Shah and his Government. Public security was good except in Pars where the ^ashgai and the Boir Ahmadi were making trouble,as they are to-day. A shortage of wheat in Isfahan and Northern Iran developed during Ihe Autumn due to two bad harvests and accentuated by hoarding. Chapter IV Kerman and Bandar Abbas, (pages 19-27) • British trade with Kerman via Bandav Abbas was considerably curtailed owing to the war, but Indian trade was favourably maintained. (PVyyU^ GAfi.

Wheat becamq scarce during the Autumn owing to large sales to Russia and to maldistribution of the remainder. The security situation deteriorated and there were retorts of highway robberies. Broadcasts from Delhi and London counteracted,to some extent ; Creman propaganda^ but the feeling that the British were somehow responsible for the miseries of Persia persisted. ^ But' thJ- &amp;Ona'n | 1&lt;/vrv (XiKct ^cvu^ctvn U&gt;€AjC. *©£“ $fcL&gt;yJZjl U/vv tii toe. ’bJfey. d /ke.

The conclusion of \ Trade,3on Voisinage and Extradition Agreements be tv/een H.M.G., on benal^ 01 the Sheikh &gt; and Saudi A r abia, led to a revival of trade and increased Treasury receipts. Efforts were made to induce the Sheikh to make a budget and to bring order out of the chaos in that Department. Security in the desert remained good. The drought meant severe hardship to the Bedouin.

Owing to their inability to declare commercial production the Kuwait Oil Company agreed to advance to the Sheikh the sum of I^s.1,000,000/in four yearly instalments, beginning in 1944,as a loan against future royalties. The Company had failed to find potable wa*:er though four wells had been sunk. Chapter VT Bahrein and the Tracial Coast (pages 32-4-l)_ « The affection and loyalty of all classes towards Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa was demonstrated at the celebrations of the 7th anniversary of his ^accession. Sheikh Hamad has since died and has been succeeded peacefully by his son Salman. The event of the year was the bombing by the Italians of the oil re finery J there were no casualties and no damage was done. A total of 7,073,919 barrels of oil was produced during the year. An agreement was completed between the Sheikh and the Bahrain Petroleum Company which enabled the Company to extend their operations outside the area previously leased to them. The pearling season was poor. The Broadcasting Station was opened at Bahrein on the 4th November, 1940. A r\uo ^\)€^nhx£^jt unvo cUxsii*^ lyi/ i ijLaA~ . Petroleum Concessions (Qatar) Ltd. obtained satisfactory results from their tests. No potable artesian water had been located in Qatar. There were various tribal disturbances on the Trucial Coast during the year. Chapter VII Iluscat 1 pa;-;es 42-51) . Apart from minor disturbances at Gwadur, Dhibah and the Jaalan area,the year was a peaceful one. The Sultan^ influence in Oman was increasing. Imports decreased and exports increased during the year with the result that in spite of unforeseen increased in expenditure, the State was paying its way. No cases of slave trading were reported during the year. This was due to the interest taken by the Sultan in the suppression of the traffic and to frequent touring by the Political Agent. The event of most importance.locally during the year was the birth at Dhofar of a son and heir to the Sultan. fe 3SS oM 'uWtt The Muscat Infantry was increased in strength^and Major Pettyfer of the 10th Baluch Regiment was selected to undertake their training and organisation and to act as Military Adviser to the Sultan. H© has since been replaced by Major L.B. Hirst, 10th Ghurka Rifles. For information. n. 6 h. Tk&lt;i to exit ry\Mck ^Cu . A3. . (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd.

General .—With a few unimportant exceptions public opinion in the Arab Shaikhdoms has been consistently pro-British. With the exception of the Shaikh of Kuwait, whose weakness for intrigue occasionally led him astray, all the Rulers maintained a steadfastly loyal and helpful attitude. In November an appeal was launched for a Persian Gulf Fighter Fund which, despite the general poverty of the local population and the small number of British subjects met with a most encouraging response. Within a few days a sum of Rs. 25,000 was collected and by the end of the year the prospect of sufficient funds for the purchase of two or three aeroplanes was in sight. The bombing of Bahrain in October by Italian aircraft fortunately resulted in neither casualties nor damage. Except for an extraordinary display of panic amongst the American employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company surprisingly little notice was taken of the incident by the general public. Royal Navy .—Owing to other preoccupations sloops of the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Navy have not been able to pay frequent visits to the various Arab Shaikhdoms. An Italian submarine was rammed by H. M. S. “ Falmouth ” at the entrance of the Gulf and her crew were taken prisoner and removed to Bahrain until arrange ments could be made for their despatch to India. Aviation .'—Except for a total interruption from June to September British Overseas Airways Corporation Limited maintained a bi-weekly service between Egypt and India. From September the K. L. M. were permitted to use Bahrain regularly for their weekly service in each direction, and Sharjah occasionally, under special autho risation. The Royal Air Force made several routine flights. Lighting and Buoying .—Proposals were made to ensure that the American oil companies using the Route Lights paid some contribution towards the cost of their upkeep, this aspect of the Gulf lighting and buoying having escaped the notice of the authorities when the Sitra and Rennie shoal—Ras Tanura lights were installed. No progress had been made by the end of the year. Oil and Minerals .—On account of the war no geological survey parties of Petroleum Concessions Limited visited Muscat and the Trucial Shaikhdoms. In Qatar drilling operations have continued and by the end of the year a second well had reached a depth of 4,798 feet and drilling was about to commence on a third. In Bahrain, the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited secured the concession for the unallotted area. The total production for the year was 7,073,919 barrels as compared with 7,588,544 barrels produced in 1939. Royalty paid to the Bahrain Government amounted to Rs. 15,26,886 for the first half of the year and Rs. 14,42,580 for the second half. At the end of the year the Company’s employees numbered :— Americans Canadians European British subjects Indian British subjects . Bahrainis Others ....

At Bahrain the attendance at the Agency dispensary increased in spite of the additional facilities provided by the Bahrain State P Hospitals. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Government dispensary at Dubai was invalided to India early in the year and his relief did not arrive until 29th July. I his dispensary has long been needed and attendance figures are on the increase. The Residency Surgeon visited the Trucial Coast during the year. Kuwait .—Relations with Saudi Arabia have been cordial. Shaikh Hafiz Wahba, Saudi Minister in London, visited Kuwait on the 25th February and started negotiations with the Political Agent with the obiect of settling outstanding points connected with the agreements between Kuwait and oaudi Arabia. His Royal Highness Amir Baud visited Kuwait in the latter half of March. «b A water supply company has been formed to collect drinking water from the £ri a ce o a f water “ ^ haS ^ a ^Merable reduction in the Bahrain.-yu Shaikh’s brother, Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa al Khalifah very nwisely boarded an Italian ship at Alexandria on the 5 th June'on his way to Beirut.

Lighting and Buoying. —The Resident was astonished to hear while on board ilit* JNearchus that after leaving him at Kuwait she was to proceed to Bushire, and remove the Bushire buoys, this decision having been taken without any inti mation to the Persian Gulf Residency. The matter was taken up at once and it transpired that His Majesty’s Legation had misunderstood the Persian request, which was for the removal of the lights on the Town Residency flag staff only. 1 his was agreed to as these lights were of little value and the buoys remained in sjiu. ^ Tne Qishm island buoy which had already been removed was replaced. The Vafs island light vessel was replaced by an unattended light vessel and moved to the Shah Allum shoal, as the Persians had placed a lighthouse on Qais island. Security.—fho abolition of sub-Governorships in the District resulted in a deterioration in the relations between the subordinate officials who replaced them and the tribes, marked by an increase in the number of clashes between road guards and police officials and parties of discontented tribesmen. Relations between the Residency and local Iranian officials continued to be cordial throughout the year. C. G. PRIOR, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.2 B.—BRITISH INTERESTS.

Revenue Department—A.t the beginning of the Iranian year, March 1940, this Department was divided into two separate branches : ( 1 ) the Revenue Department, and ( 2 ) the Economics Department. The co 1 lection of land revenue, income-tax and indirect taxes remained the responsibility of the Revenue Department. As in previous years taxes were assessed arbitrarily and had no relation to actual profits. Discontent would have been greater had it not been possible to obtain relief by bribery. Economics Department .—This Department had control of the Piece-Goods Monopoly, the Opium Monopoly, the Tobacco Monopoly and the Wheat Mono- poly. An adequate supply of wheat was provided for Local consumption and regular monthly supplies were sent to Lingah, Bandar Abbas, Jask and Charbar. Wheat was bought at Rials 400 per ton and was sold at Rials 500 a ton. Tobacco was bought at Rials 2 to 4 a maund of about 7-|-lbs. and having been classified into two grades was sold at Cents 80 and 70 respectively per 100 grammes. The cost of piece-goods was raised by about 25% and 15% for British and Japanese piece- goods respectively. r The Sugar and Tea Monopoly, which is under separate control raised their prices for soft sugar by 123%, for loaf by 133% and for tea by 10%. Smuggling of contraband goods.—During the year considerable quantities of wheat,, tobacco and carpets and a good number of sheep and cattle were illicitlv exported. Piece-goods, sugar, crockery and hardware being smuggled into the country and sent inland for disposal. In a few instances when bribery failed fighting took place between the smugglers and road guards at least 16 of whom were reported to have been killed. • 10 tons of tobacco, 15 tons of wheat and 62 bales of piece-goods as well as small quantities of tea and sugar were seized by the authorities. The Iranian gunboat • Shahrokh also captured a dhow carrying contraband cargo in territorial waters and towed it to Khorramshahr./ r 3 Roads and Communications. 1 . Bushire-Shiraz Road. —Gangs were occupied on repairing the road through out the year. It is unlikely however that the repairs will have any lasting effect. 2 . Bushire-Firuzabad Road. —The Firuzabad-Bushire section of this road is still uncompleted. From Firuzabad to Shiraz however the road is reported to be good. 3. Bushire-Lingah Coast Road. —The road is in a bad state of repair and was seldom used except by the Military and Civil authorities. Land Registration. Applications for registration were accepted from Bushire, Borazjun and Bandar Rig. The value of property was arbitrarily assessed by Inspectors who, in many cases, did not abide by their own valuation and either recovered extra fees or, in consideration of bribes, reduced their original assessment. New branches of the department are to be opened at Dilum, Daiyir, Kangan and Tahir. Education. At the end of the year there were reported to be over 50 Elementary and Secondary schools in Bushire and district with a total staff of 250 teachers. The standard of education is however very low and it seems doubtful whether the large number of children now compelled to attend classes gain any real benefit. Health and Quarantine Department. —Dr. Faris held the post of Chief Health and Quarantine Officer throughout the year. During the month of March when there was a small-pox epidemic at Borazjun, vaccination was carried out in the town and in the districts, The Bushire Hospital maintained 20 beds for indoor patients. Bushire Municipality. —Budget provision was made for an expenditure of Rials 300,000 ; there was however little improvement in public services. In October the head of the municipality was charged with accepting bribes and brought before a tribunal specially appointed to prosecute Government officials. It is believed that he disgorged some of his accumulated wealth and by the end of the year the case against him appeared to have been dropped. No new works of importance were undertaken during the year. SECTION 4. ARMY. The Bushire garrison which consists of 3 Companies of Infantry and one M. G. detachment (total strength about 500) remained under the command of Captain Yusuf Noori till the middle of the year. Thereafter Captain Tabrasi was in command. It is believed that the garrison was reinforced by one field g Un and a small party of gunners about the middle of the year. The latter are known to have returned to Shiraz. It seems probable however that the gun is still in Bushire though it has never been seen. About 1,500 new conscripts were recruited during the year, the majority being sent to Shiraz for training. Old conscripts were also called up for short refresher courses. About the middle of the year it was decided to replace a number of the long service road guards by military conscripts, and 160 conscripts were accordingly posted to the Road Guards Department at Bushire. This change over seems to have been effected in the hope that conscripts would deal more kindly with the local peasantry whose complaints about the exactions of the long service road guards were becoming very bitter. These hopes appear to have been unfulfilled,— 4 and by the end of the year the peasantry apparently tired of waiting for the autho rities to act, had taken matters into their own hands and lost no opportum y o murder road guards unfortunate enough to be caught alone. DISARMAMENT OF THE TRIBES. Little progress was made in disarmament and the tribes in Dashti and Tangistan are believed to have captured more rifles from the road guards than t road guards have seized from them. NAVY. Ghulam Ali Bayendor, who remained in command of the Iranian Navy throughout the year, was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral. Iranian gunboats paid periodical visits to Bushire. In the month of October a reception was held to mark the inauguration of the new Bushire Light House which is in the charge of the Naval Authorities. Lieut.-Commander Zelli, Officer in Charge of the Naval Bureau at Bushire, left for Bandar Shahpur. During the year efforts were made to register all local sailing craft. SECTION 5. AVIATION. British .—No British aeroplane visited Bushire during the year. Eight aeroplanes belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company called at Bushire during 1940. Foreign. French .—The Air France service was discontinued in June 1940. Dutch .—The K. L. M. mail service ceased to call at Bushire in July 1940. SECTION 6 . POLITICAL SITUATION. ffm I I !' The sub-Governorships at Ahram, Khormuj and Kangan were abolished in the month of November for reasons of economy. The duties previously performed by the Governors are now being carried out by subordinate officials under the direct supervision of the Governor of Bushire. This arrangement is understood to be unsatisfactory both from the administrative and executive point of view. The exactions of the executive officials are tending to increase the feelings of hostility with which the tribes have always regarded the Government authorities, and there has been a serious increase in the number of open clashes between road guards or police officials and parties of discontented tribesmen. In one instance reported in December, 26 road guards are believed to have been killed. A Dashti tribal chief, Ali Ismail, has caused the authorities considerable trouble throughout the year. With a following of 300 men he came off best in several encounters with Government troops, and eventually all idea of suppressing him by military action was given up and diplomacy resorted to. Even in diplo*- macy Ali Ismail seems to have come off best, for though he had to surrender 50 old rifles he remains free and is understood, at one time or another, to have taken a good many more than 50 rifles from Government troops who have been sent out against him. In Bushire town itself conditions were even worse than last year. This is due partly to lack of employment owing to the decrease in the number of ships calling ■1:SECTION 7. MANUMISSION.

STEWART, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. SECTION 8 . TRADE AND TRADE FACILITIES. General Condition. —The general situation remains unchanged, Bushire has scarcely any trade of its own, and is merely a forwarding centre. Shortage of shipping and other war conditions caused a slight decrease in commercial activity this year. Compared with 1939, imports declined by about 24 per cent, and exports (excluding those to other Gulf ports) by about 33 per cent, stocks kept in the Customs were much reduced by the end of the year. Table “ A ” shows the volume of goods imported and exported by steamships, the figures, which are mostly received in packages, have been converted to tons, as in former years, at the rough estimate of ten packages to a ton. For British India ships, the export figures for the last two years have not included exports to other Gulf ports, for the purpose of comparison, therefore, these exports are shown separately from the main total. Table “ B ” shows the different types and quantities of goods imported and exported by steamships, similar statistics for former years are not available, nor is it possible to state in detail the origin or the ultimate destination of goods passing through Bushire. Imports and exports by sailing vessels are usually not large, and no details are obtainable, but such traffic has certainly increased this year owing to the decrease in the number of steamers. Shipping. (а) British. There was, as might be expected, a further decline in the number of British ships, and only 113 called this year as compared with 151 in 1939. Two vessels of the City Line, which brought a small quantity of imports in February and April, are included in the figures for the British India Line in Table “ A The British India slow mail service suffered occasional interruptions, and Strick ships became less frequent towards the end of the year. British ships, however, as in 1939, carried nearly 50 per cent, of the total exports (in addition to those to other Gulf ports) and imports. Among imports were medicines, metal sheets, paper, and piece-goods from the United Kingdom and India, tea and attari from India. ( б ) Foreign. (i) Japanese.—The Mitsui and Yamashita lines improved their position further. With four ships less than last year, they increased their imports from 5,114 tons in 1939 to 7,150 tons in 1940, these imports consisted chiefly of cement, MS153EADmatches, piece-goods, glass and porcelainware. Their exports, such as, oil seeds, gum, and cotton seed also increased, though they included less opium than last year. (u) Butch .—Ten steamers of the Silver Java Pacific line, as compared with three in 1939, raised their-imports from 1,592 tons to 5,314 tons, chiefly sugar and tea. Their exports were again small. (m) United States of America.—Yon steamers, as opposed to three last year, brought 420 tons of general merchandise (including a number of wireless sets) and 257 cars (Buick, Dodge, Chevrolet, Fords, etc.). They also carried some exports. Eight of these ships belonged to the Isthmian line, one to the Kerr line, and one to the Isbrandsen Holier fine, which is understood to be starting a regular service to the Gulf. (iv) Italian—Up to the Italy’s entry into the war, seven Lloyd Triestino ships had called, importing 1,145 tons (sugar, paper, medicines, thread, electric goods, etc.) and exporting 2,953 tons, largely gum and linseed, in 1939 there were no exports in Italian ships. (v) Egyptian .—At the end of the year one ship called at Bushire and landed a large quantity of Egyptian sugar. Opium —The following shipments were made in 1940 :— February 250 cases for Macao. March .. 100 &gt;&gt; Singapore. August 200 Macao. 200 &gt;&gt; Batavia. September 166 &gt;&gt; Batavia. 276 5) Singapore. October 500 J5 Far East. November 500 &gt;&gt; Far East. 450 &gt;&gt; Macao. 50 &gt;&gt; London. 2,712 All pxcent 1 000 cases shipped by Japanese steamers in October and November were reported to have been for legitimate consumption. The value of a case of onium (weighing 160 lbs.), is reported to have risen from £120 in 1939 to £300 m October 1940 ° 4,755 cases were exported in 1938 and 7,335 in 1939. The decrease in opium shipments this year may be attributed to smaller demands from J apan, and possibly to lack of stocks after the big sales of last year.7 Etemadieh Spinning ond Weaving Mill- —The general position of the mill continued to improve. Debts were paid off, and dividends ranging from 4 per cent, to 12 per cent, were paid to shareholders in March, June and October. After long delays a new electric plant arrived from Germany, but its efficiency is diminisned by the lack of one piston which was lost on the way. Two of the English experts left on the expiry of their contracts, and the two who remain continue in technical charge. The other employees have increased in number to about six hundred, and for part of the year the mill has been producing its maximum output, about 40,000 metres of cloth a week. The price averages Rials 4 a metre. Good markets are found in Shiraz, Isfahan, and even further away. Finance .—The demand for credit required for customs and forwarding charges has fallen by at least 30 per cent, from the 1939 figure of 1,000,000 or 1,500,000 rials a week. Local merchants, who for some years have had little to do apart from clearing and forwarding, have suffered from the decrease in the volume of trade passing through Bushire, and two more have left the town. There has been little speculation in tea in Bushire, and most of the stocks cleared through this port are kept in Shiraz, Isfahan and Yezd, as well as Tehran. The large imports of sugar have all been on Government account. Interest rates of the Imperial Bank of Iran and the National Bank were un changed, they are lower in Bushire than in many other places as the local merchants are not inclined to overtrade. Agriculture. —The wheat and barley crops were satisfactory. Free export of barley was allowed until August, when Government control was introduced, stocks were bought up by the Economic Department, and bakers have since then been forced to buy a quantity of barley with every purchase of wheat. Exports of wheat and barley, have been made to other Iranian ports throughout the year. The dates exported were of a type known as ‘ Qasb ’, which is not popular in Bushire, but is said to have a good market in India. They are produced chiefly in Dashty. Wages and Cost of Living.—Wages have increased since last year very little, in spite of a general increase in the cost of living. This was most noticeable towards the end of the year, and, coupled with a shortage of commodities such as rice and ghee, caused some discontent. The price of piece-goods rose early in the year by about 25 per cent, to 30 percent, for Japanese goods, and 15 percent, to 25 per cent, for English goods. Tobacco and matches were also dearer than last year. Transport. One of the five garages in Bushire closed down, the rest continu ed as before. Lorry rates have, on the whole, been slightly higher than last year. Miscellaneous—The sugar and tea monopoly paid no dividends this year, the high prices have diminished sales, and the quantity of sugar released by the Government was also said to be smaller than before. A tax rising to one rial per unit of electricity consumed was imposed on all consumers from°the month of April and is collected through the supphers of current.Some minor increases were also made in miscellaneous charges, especially in the Customs department. The metric system for weights and measures was introduced in the bazaar in March, being imperfectly understood by some of the public, it provided the shopkeepers occasionally with the opportunity for a little extra profit. The Chamber of Commerce was re-organised at the end of the year; it has severed its connection with the Governorate, and consists of about six of the local merchants. C. R. LATIMER, His Majesty's Vice-Consul^ Bushire.CHAPTER II. NOTE ON EVENTS IN THE BIKARZ AREA DURING 1940. Company’s operations in the Gach Saran area were very considerably reduced during 1940 on the completion of the construction of the production installations, the pipeline connecting the area with Abadan and the drilling of the necessary oil wells. Consequently British and British Indian staff had been reduced to the follow ing figures by the 31st December 1940 :— Wives &amp; Staff. children. Gach Saran — British .. .. .. .. .. .. 9 2 British Indian .. .. .. .. .. 4 2 Agha Jari &amp; Pazanun — British .. .. .. .. .. .. 16 10 British Indian .. .. .. .. .. 9 Despatches of crude oil to Abadan commenced in June 1940, the capacity of the line being 1 * 6 million gallons a day and the throughput varying according to the demands of the Refinery. A main telephone line was constructed at the same time as the pipeline con necting Abadan and Gach Saran. The water supply for the Gach Saran area is now obtained from a number of water wells at Du Gumbadun, where an ample supply of excellent water has been found. In consequence of this the Zuhra Water Pumping Station has been closed down. Exploratory drilling was continued at Agha Jari.16 CHAPTER III. SUMMARY OF EVENTS AND CONDITIONS IN THE SHIRAZ CONSULAR DISTRICT FOR THE YEAR 1940. 1 . General. —The year was one of increasing hardship and discontent, due partly to the effects of the European War on Iran, and partly to continuation and intensi fication of the general trend of recent political and economic affairs inside Iran. Public works, where personally profitable to officials, were actively carried on, but those of a kind to benefit only the country generally were neglected. Security in Ears degenerated, but remained good elsewhere in the district. Trade dimi nished, but commercial exchanges with Germany, particularly via Batum, conti nued. Russian commercial relations failed to develop to the expected extent. British trade remained very small. The British Consulate, Shiraz, was more strictly boycotted towards the end of the year. 2 . Attitude of the public to the regime. —Criticism of the present regime became unprecedentedly outspoken, and the view that Britain was responsible for the misdeeds of the Shah and his Government was freely expressed. General sympathy with disturbers of the peace was expressed on the grounds that “ the robbers were hungry ”. Attacks were made against the Amnieh partly for the sake of stealing their arms, partly to pay off old scores ; bandits also payed particular attention to the monopolistic Sherkat-i-Rosta’s village shops. The ban on the cultivation, of rice outside North Iran, which had been made in the interests of the Imperial rice fields in the north, was the subject of a petition to the Queen on her visit to Shiraz in April, and was only partially successful ; the price of northern rice in Southern Iran is naturally higher than that of the local produce, and since the wheat crops were affected by drought, the need for rice was greater. The Bakh- tiaries, and people of Lenjan, had an identical grievance, without the favour of any such concession as the rice-growers of Fars received. The Armenian minority, too, had its own particular grievance, namely, their exclusion from the best jobs in the Public Services and the Oil Company and the Iranisation of the Armenian schools. The poor of all classes and creeds had a general grievance in the ever- increasing rapacity of corrupt officials, the poor quality of the bread, and the ever- rising prices of necessities. 3. Attitude of the public to the war. —Russia’s jamming of the Ankara Persian broadcasts left Germany without effective competition on the air during the first half of the year. At the same time the Germans inside Iran were particularly active until the fall of Matin Daftary, the pro-German Prime Minister. These advantages, combined with the German victories in Europe, produced an over whelming reaction in favour of Germany, which has only quite lately been modified by the renewed audibility of the Ankara broadcasts, the tardy but successful low-wave broadcasts from London and Delhi, and, above all, the British and Greek military successes in the Mediterranean arena. German activities produced a specially remarkable reaction in Isfahan, most of whose factories are German- built and whose merchants have profitable commercial relations with Germany. However, about mid-summer, the tension subsided, though a strong pro-German prejudice persisted. Persians make a clear distinction between the Germans and the Italians, and those who still expect a German victory take British successes against the Italians as a matter of course. 4. Administration. —Ali Zahir Homayun was appointed Acting Istandar for the Seventh Istan (Fars) in Shiraz in February. On July 31st an ^-Minister Said Mehdi Farrokh, arrived in Shiraz to become Seventh Istandar. Ali Zahir remained as his assistant for several months, and then was appointed Governor of Bushire. In Isfahan, Iskandery retained the post of Fermandar throughout • the year. 5 5. Propaganda.—A slight skirmish occurred in December between the Seventh Istandar and the Acting British Consul in Shiraz, on the question of propaganda attacking the Axis powers, the Governor insisting on the strictest possible inter pretation of Iranian neutrality. It seems however that propaganda in the form of broadcasts, films, and regular periodicals sent by post, is not the concern of the local authorities, Tehran broadcasts seemed to concentrate on educational talksM?- * r* A A 17 on agriculture, hygiene, etc. By the end of the year it appeared that British pro paganda was really beginning to catch up with German. German propagandists however are not only concerned with the Iranian public, for Dr. Eilers of Isfahan is sending seditious literature via Kerman into India. 6 . German trade. —Germany is busy trying to buy up almost everything in Iran available for export. Wool, copper utensils, wild almonds, dried fruits, oil seeds, pig-fat,—all these raw materials are welcomed as grist to German war- machine. A new feature however has been the export to Germany of Iranian manu factures other than carpets : in 1940 one Isfahan cotton-mill delivered an order to Germany of cotton material, and another mill began making woollen dress mate rial for an order to be delivered in 1941 to the value of 250,000 tomans. At the same time Germany has maintained her exports to Iran, though at an increased cost and not without delays and difficulties. For the first time German cars have appeared in considerable numbers in the local market. Small spare parts of machinery have arrived within three months at Isfahan from Germany, but heavier / machinery is liable to long delays ; for instance some new machines for one of the Isfahan mills arrived after a two years’ interval. Stationery, haberdashery, photographic materials, etc., available in the local market, are still predominantly German. 7 . Russian trade.- —No Russian trade agents made their appearance. 8 . The Tribes.- —Tribal elements were responsible for many of the disorders that marred the peace of Ears this year, but the fact that some robberies occurred in the high places after the return of the Qashgais to winter-quarters shows that some of the bandits belong to the settled country of inner Ears. The Fasa-Lar- Jah-rum—Firuzabad area was particularly disturbed, but a feud between the Boir Ahmadi and the roadguards of the Fahlian area also resulted in a serious incident near Shapur. No report of any troule in Bakhtiari country was heard, but the arrest of several Bakhtiari notables in Isfahan in early December suggests that efforts are being made to stir these disaffected people up. The relative strengths of the Central Government and the tribes is, of course quite the reverse of what it was in the last War, and it would seem that disaffection in the army is the more likely form any serious disturbance would take, and certainly is the pre-requisite for any tribal commotion. 9 . Communications.- —The official announcement in December that the pro jected railway-line from Shiraz to Bushire via Firuzabad would be completed short ly caused great excitement, but the Istandar later admitted to the Acting Consul that the scheme was still under Ministerial consideration and that the engineers whom popular rumour associated with the project had arrived for quite a different purpose. It therefore seems unlikely that anything will be accomplished towards this project in the immediate future. 10 . Military. —At Shiraz Sartip Amidi retained his command of the Fars Lashkar throughout the year. He and other authorities tried to hush up and minimise the disorders that occurred. At Isfahan, Sarhang Sha’ri became Commandant of the local troops, now a Lashkar. No signs of any disaffection in the army were noted, though a certain amount of pro-German talk was reported early in the year. 11 . Movements of foreigners. —Herr Renner, imprisoned in Shiraz since the year before, was sent to Tehran and there reported to be released. Monsieur Ghirshman, the French archaeologist, excavated at Shapur, with a long absence in the summer. Several diplomatic parties visited Shiraz and Bushire in the spring. In August Herr Neumann left Shiraz, for Tabriz. Herr Hauptmann had already left a month or two before. In Isfahan Herr Wulff was replaced by Herr Starke in the Technical School, and proceeded to Tabriz. Herr Schunemann left for Tehran in the late autumn. An occasional German courier visited Shiraz, presumably with secret messages for Herr Kraemer. Isfahan received frequent visits from important Germans. MS153EA.D8 At the end of the year, there were about twenty-two German or German- subject male adults in Isfahan, and about three in Shiraz. There were perhaps as many as half a dozen in the rest of the Shiraz Consular district. Measures, designed to eliminate from Iranian industries foreign employees who were politically undesirable, of which there had been some talk in the summer, \ had not materiahsed effectively by the end of the year. 12 . Educational .—The Iranian Government purchased the premises of the Stuart Memorial College, Isfahan, and took over control of the school. Miss Gerard was allowed to buy the Shiraz C. M. S. Girls’ School; the other two similar Girls’ schools, at Isfahan and Yezd, were bought by the Government but are carry ing on for the present school year as before Armenian schools were rigorously Iranised. 13. Agriculture .—The more extensive cultivation of opium was again permit ted, but if the crop for 1940 was much larger than that of the previous year, the Iranian Government succeeded in concealing the fact. Iran asked for and obtained more than double the 1939 price for the 1940 crop. The cultivation of rice in Ears wns, as the result of a petition made in April, allowed for one year only by special permission for each place, i.e., by bribing the officials who inspected the land and decided whether or not any other crop could be planted there. The Ears wheat crop was not very successful. A shortage of wheat in Isfahan and N. Iran developed during the summer and autumn, due partly to exports made before the War, partly to private hoarding, and partly to twn successive bad years. It was even said that many people died of starvation in the Lenjan area above Isfahan. Whether or not this w^as so, it was learnt early in 1941 that the Government had decided to make a similar concession for 1941 to the cultivators there and in Bakhtiari country as had been made to Ears for 1940. The silo at Isfahan had been completely emptied of wheat. The Shiraz silo w r as completed except that no machinery arrived. Large quantities of wheat ivere sent out of Ears to stop the shortage at Isfahan and in North Iran. The fruit crop was a failure in most parts of Ears. The Marvdasht refinery worked on sugar-beets grown in the surrounding district for four months. Beet cultivation is widely pursued in Ears. Inspite of the laws for the protection of forests, no effort was made in Ears to check deforestation, which is gathering speed, and threatens to become very serious. ILLEGIBLE, Acting Consul.CHAPTER IV. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KERMAN AND BANDAR ABBAS CONSULATES FOR THE YEAR 1940. A.—KERMAN. I.—H. M.’s CONSULATE. Personnel. —Major G. A. Falconer I. P. S. held charge throughout the year except for a period of leave from 9th October to 23rd November when Mr. C. R. Latimer, Vice-Consul, Bushire, held acting charge. Tours. —H. M.’s Consul returned from Bandar Abbas on the 2 nd February. He also proceeded to Tehran in the second half of April. His Majesty's Birthday. —Owing to the war the usual reception was not held but the Farmandar and other foreign residents made customary calls. Consular Statistics (1940)— British Subjects registered .. . . .. . . .. 24 Passports issued .. .. .. .. .. .. 12 Passports renewed .. .-. .. .. .. .. 7 Visas granted .. .. .. .. .. .. 1 Births registered .. .. .. .. .. .. 1 Documents legalised or attested .. .. .. .. 5 Fees levied .. .. .. .. .. .. £14-7-6 II.—VISITORS. The Rt. Revd. W. J. Thompson, Bishop in Iran, visited Kerman for a fortnight in June. III.—BRITISH INTERESTS. Trade (via Bandar Abbas) United Kingdom. —The war considerably curtailed commercial activities with Iran. The ban on carpets into England (formerly the principal item of export from Iran) mainly accounts for the reduction. Figures for the trade year ending 22 nd March 1940 show exports to the United Kingdom a? amounting to Rials, 9,164,300 (£50,912)—carpets, wool, red oxide, while those for the next six months are dowm to Rials 422,000 (£2,344)—gum and red oxide. Im ports from the United Kingdom for the same periods were Rials 1,048,600 (£5,820) and Rials 145,100 (£800) respectively. India. —On the other hand trade with India has been favourably maintained. Exports to Imports from Year ending 22nd March 1940 Rials 2,535,900 (£14,088) Rials 2,816,500 (£15,647) 1st 6 months current year .. Rials 477,550 (£2,653) Rials 1,190,700 (£6,615) The principal exports to India are gum, nuts and dried fruits ; imports from India are chiefly various spices and tea. Iranians prefer Indian tea to either China or Iran products. About 85 per cent, of the tea consumed in this province is In dian. A small quantity of Indian piece goods also found their way to Kerman during the year. They are preferred to German goods but do not yet compete with the Japanese which, though inferior in quality, are cheaper and have more attractive designs. There is a steady demand for British pedal cycles which at present can only be met with difficulty by the United Kingdom. Indian enterprise would probably find a ready market for machines of the British “ Hercules ” standard and price. Anglo-lranian Oil Co .—The Company maintained a central agency at Kerman throughout the year with sub-agencies at Bandar Abbas, Rafsinjan, Sir j an and Bam.20 Church Missionary Society, (a) Medical. —Dr. (Miss) Howgate was in charge of the hospital during 1940 and also acted as medical officer to H. M.’s Consulate. The value of this work to the local inhabitants is illustrated by the figures which show that during the past year the hospital admitted 697 in-patients and out-patient attendances numbered 15,994. ( 6 ) Educational. —1940 brought to an end the Society’s 30 years educational work in Kerman. The closing of the Society’s boys’ and girls schools was much regretted locally. The property has been taken over by the Iranian Government along with other educational premises owned by the Society, including the college buildings at Isfahan. The combined values agreed to by the Iranian Government is believed to be £ 20,000 payable in England over 5 years and Rials 140,000 payable in Iran. (c) St. Andrews Church. —Rev. A. T. Howden was in charge throughout the year. There was no serious interference by local authorities with any branch of the Society’s work. IV.—FOREIGN INTERESTS. * Representation. —There are no other foreign representatives in this area. Trade {via Bandar Abbas).—The extent to which other foreign trade by this route has been affected by the war is best illustrated by the following figures (omit ting United Kingdom and India) :— Exports Imports 1318 (ending 22nd March, 1940). Rials. 22,375,100 22,491,800 1st 6 months 1319. Rials. 7,573,170 6,621,680 It appears certain that figures for the full year 1319 will register a considerable drop from the preceding year. Principal exports are carpets, pistachio nuts, red oxide, gum and wool to America. Nearly 2/3rds of the imports for first six months of 1319 (April-October 1940) consist of sugar from Java. The war completely eliminated a considerable trade with Germany by this route. |f'K m. 0 fUi' As regards trade with Germany, however, towards the end of the year German products were reaching Kerman via Russia and Tehran (machinery spare parts, drugs and cotton piece goods). Considering the international situation the carpet industry enjoyed a reason ably good year. Exports to America for first half of 1319 were up to average and the loss of the British market was set off by much increased purchases in Teh ran. It is believed that most of the saipets sent to Tehran have actually been con- sumed there though increased sales to Sweden (via Russia) were reported. V.—LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Ustandar (Governor-General).—This appointment was vacant throughout the year. Farmandar (Governor).—This post was also vacant until the arrival of Aqai Reza Hikmat on 11 th May. He proceeded to Tehran on 15th September for three weeks leave but had not returned by the end of the year. In the absence of both Ustandar and Farmandar the latter’s head clerk is in charge of Governorate affairs ; a most unsatisfactory arrangement which is far too frequent and which betokens the extensive shortage of competent Iranian officials. The relations of this Consulate with the Governorate of Kerman was very cordial throughout the year. Finance and Revenue. —With effect from new Iranian year ( 22 nd March) this department was divided into two branches (a) revenue, and ( 6 ) trade and econo mics. In August the acting director of revenue was recalled to Tehran to explain the considerable fall in provincial revenues.21 It was commonly thought that after the Shah’s speech in June on the occasion H s truThrth°e coH P t mne there would alleviation in taxation fundus nkc!or- e °i • voluntar y subscriptions to the national aviation : nd ' &lt; ; discontinued but tins was only a minor easement During the year fX^ ^ 25 r CeUt ' and Vehidc tax “ lOTries by loV cent.

The Local branch has been known to use both English and French on occasions. The bank has been authorised to grant special credits to merchants to the extent of the value ot their property or business possessions. Farmandars have been appointed supervisory heads of the bank and are re quired to inspect the working of local branches monthly. A branch of the Agricultural Bank (Bank-i-Faiahat) operated in Kerman iroughout the year. ^ It advanced considerable loans to landowners for which land was mortgaged with interest at 18 per cent. Judiciary. The Minister of Justice inspected the working of the local courts m November. One result of his visit was the re-opening of an Appellate, t ourt m Kerman. This court was closed in August 1939 and appeals lay at Isfahan ' 0 awa y- ^ ie impracticability of this arrangement having been fully ex posed the original system is reverted to. Aqai Ali Akbar Musawi assumed charge °1 118 P 08 ^ f mef Judge of the Appellate Court on 7th December. 1940^° * m P° rtant case i nv °l™g British subjects came before the courts during PoZme.—Sargurd (Major) Yusuf Bahrami was in charge until relieved in May by 1 as y ar 11 (Lt.-Colonel) Amjadi. The new Chief is reported to be popular. The C. I. D. staff was increased to watch the movements of foreigners. But it was noticed that these men were less in evidence in the neighbourhood of this Con sulate than formerly. The attitude of the Police Department towards this Consulate and its staff was very satisfactory. / osts and Telegraphs. This department now employs a number of young male and female telegraph operators whose lack of training causes many hours of addi tional labour to H. M.’s Consul. A combined postal and police censorship was established at the beginning of the } ear and suspect letters and telegrams are subjected to examination. So far as is known no postal covers to and from this Consulate have been interfered with. qi u As 1 ™ ai }y anonymous and abusive letters being addressed to the bkan and other high officials mostly on the subject of taxation and the high cost of ivmg, L. 1. D. men were set to watch for persons who posted covers to these add resses. During the year new post offices were opened at Jiruft, Zarand, Ravar and - Mamin. ^ telegraph office for military use only was opened at Jiruft; a military I. (). already existed at Rudbar. J Wy' p &amp; ^» * imrs. Education .—The Pehlvi boys’ school was moved to the former C. M. S. build- d Eleven night classes for adult men were opened durin 0, the year MS153EAD &amp; J22 Although the Iranian Chief Scout visited Kerman there was little Scout ao- t tivity during the year. With the closing of the C. M. S. girls’ school the Girl Guide movement has practically ceased to exist. The restriction on children under 16 attending the cinema was not strictly enforced. No new schools were opened during the year. Municipality .—There was little advance in municipal administration. No progress was made with the scheme to provide a better drinking water supply for the town. A new and very young Rais-i-Shahrdari arrived in August but he is not popular, mainly on account of his youth. Rials 40,000 were raised locally for the construction of a poor-house in Kerman. Able-bodied beggars were rounded up by the municipality and provided with stocks of cigarettes and matches to sell on commission. Health. —Dr. Irani (M.B., B.S., Bombay) was succeeded in March as Director of Health by Dr. Muhammad Daftari (Tehran Medical College)—a nephew of the G. 0. C., Kerman. Dr. Vakili (educated in Germany) continued as municipal medical officer throughout the year. One of his tasks is a monthly inspection of barbers, bakers, fruit-sellers and prostitutes for venereal diseases. It is said that a “ clean ” certi ficate is granted on suitable payment. The general health of the town was good ; there was a mild outbreak of small pox early in the year and some cases of dyphtheria in the late summer. Vacci nation and inoculation w^ere provided free by the health department. Opium smoking is reported to be on the increase owing to the increased cost of local-made spirit (araq). Agriculture. —Scarcity of rain resulted in small and poor quality gram crops in 1940. No rain of measurable quantity fell in Kerman from January to the end of the year and the prospects for the Spring (1941) crops is not good. The early warmth of February brought on fruit trees too quickly with the result that all blo- som was destroyed by a frost in late March. The pistachio crop was also partially affected but grapes were plentiful. The wheat shortage which began to appear in the autumn gave rise to much . anxiety. There was no real shortage in this area until stocks from here were sent to other centres where the bread shortage was acute. It is estimated that 225,000 maunds ( 6 J lbs.) of wheat were sent from Kerman to Mekran, Isfahan and Tehran during the year. Denuded of its supplies, Kerman had to meet its own bread short age in December by appropriating wheat in the Sirjan, Bam and Baft areas and by mixing barley with wheat. Excessive earlier sales to Russia combined with mal adjustment of remaining stocks was the cause of the people’s sufferings in this respect. 60,000 maunds of expensive rice and 8,000 maunds of inferior quality were imported into Kerman for local consumption from the Mazanderan estates of the Shah. Rice to meet the local demand was formerly grown in this area, its cultivation is now prohibited. Restricted poppy cultivation is again permitted in the Kerman district. 4,200 maunds of opium were delivered to the Government ambars during 1940 but some 13,000 maunds of “smuggled ” opium were disposed of in addition. The Gov ernment purchase opium at rials 300 per maund and retail it at rials 1,200 while smuggled opium is retailed at rials 900. Thus the advantage of smuggled opium to both seller and buyer is well-worth the risk. Rials 80,000 were advanced to cultivators for cotton growing but red-worm again appeared in the crop, most of which was burnt. A scheme originally propounded by H. E. Aqai Ali Soheli, Minister of Interior, when Ustandar of Kerman, to bring water to Kerman from the Chari river about 20 miles S.-E. of Kerman at a cost of ria]s 3,000,000 (£16,500), was submitted to Tehran. But as there was neither Ustandar nor Farmandar to back the scheme at the time of submission it has apparently been shelved.23 Two new kanats have been constructed by Nusrat-ul-Mumalik in the Zarand / &gt; r&gt; area tapping the Kuhistan hills about 40 N. of Kerman. It is hoped to considerably increase agriculture in this region in 2-3 years. The government have leased an area in the Jabal Bariz region south of Bam to Ghulam Beza Agah in connection with his experiments to improve the pistachio crop by grafting on to wild almond trees which are plentiful in this district. Pis tachio nuts are an important export commodity ; America being the principal consumer. Industry and Developments .—With the exception of the search for minerals under an exploratory concession granted to Mr. Weiss a Dutch subject who is re puted to be a dollar millionaire, there were no important industrial developments during 1940. Carpet weaving is still the principal industry in this district. There was no unemployment among weavers. With the increased demand in the country and maintenance of the American market, this -industry had a satisfactory year. Carpet prices advanced by nearly 100 per cent. Several large pieces wen.made to the order of the Shah. The Khorshid Spinning Mill was in production throughout the year. Some spare-parts from Germany were received but a major consignment is reported to be at the bottom of the Danube. The 1,000 rials shares of this company quoted at rials 1,750 at the beginning of the year, fell to rials 1,250 in anticipation of no dividend being passed for the current year. VL—MILITARY. Sartip Ali Akbar Siyahpush retained command of the military district through out the year. Early in the year orders were issued raising the command from a brigade to a division but the actual strength has not been materially changed. Several reports during the year indicated a deterioration in disciphne, parti cularly among young officers trained at the Tehran Military Academy. The G. O. C. who has now held this command for 5 years, obviously intends to finish his time here. He recently married a Kermani girl as his third wife and has purchased house property valued at rials 100 , 000 . He is reputed to smoke 1-3 misquals of opium daily. As a precautionary measure additional military posts were established along the Baluchistan frontier at intervals of 15 miles. The garrisons at Bam and Rudbar were strengthened owing to disturbed con ditions in those areas. A further grant of rials 200,000 was received in the autumn for completion of the barracks at Lar Asiab together with a quantity of old Russian rials for proof supports. Some of the quarters were occupied by the end of the year. About 2,000 military conscripts were recruited in the Kerman district during 1940 most of whom were drafted to the Mekran command ; 800 conscripts from Yezd were absorbed in the Kerman command. Internal Security .—In spite of military activity security was not so well main tained last year. The areas principally affected were Bam and Rudbar to which extra troops had to be drafted to meet the situation. From other districts also highway robberies were reported. Ismailzais were responsible for many raids on villages in the Rudbar and Narmashir areas. A number of these gangsters were rounded up and several have been shot. The military suffered casualties in these operations. VII.—COMMUNICATIONS. Roads .—A military fair-weather road connecting Bam, Jiruft and Rudbar was opened during the year. Most of the neighbouring villages have now been linked up with Kerman by fair-weather motor roads. A sum of rials 400,000 was allotted for repair and maintenance of the Kerman- Bandar Abbas road and the construction of two bridges.24 The alignment of the new major road from Kerman to Khorasan via Shahdad on which work was suspended about two years ago, was once again considered on the spot by a committee of local officials, including the G. 0. C. It is reported that rials 3,000,000 have so far been spent on this road. Wireless. —The Kerman station operates for a few hours twice a week for military communications only. It also contacts with military portable sets in out-stations. Aviation. —No aeroplane landed at Kerman during 1940. The landing ground, which is in the hands of the military department, was in the process of its annual clean-up at the end of the year. VIII.—LOCAL POLITICS. In the matter of the European war public opinion in this province is to a large extent controlled by the side which predominates on the air. Until a news bulletin in Persian was broadcast from Delhi in August, Berlin broadcasts had it all their own way. Consequently pro-German sentiment was general and even those who did not support these sentiments feared a German victory. With German successes in Europe followed by the collapse of France, Berlin found ready hearers for its point of view. When the Berlin prophecy that Hitler would be in London by 15th August failed to materialise and the British Empire showed no signs of crack ing, the first real doubts of an ultimate German victory began to find expression. The Delhi bulletin became available, therefore, at an appropriate time. Public opinion rapidly began to change until by the end of the year the number of those who thought a German victory possible was considerably reduced. The stubborn resistance of the Greeks to Italian aggression, the British successes in the Western Desert and Libya combined with the introduction of a broadcast in Persian direct from London contributed largely to this change of mind. There are now few Ira nian owners of receiving sets who do not listen-in daily to the Delhi or London broadcast or both ; they probably listen-in to Berlin also, but little credence is now placed upon news from the latter source. As regards domestic politics there is a feeling that the British are indirectly responsible for the sufferings of the people under the present regime, since the British were primary instrumental in its establishment. They cannot rid themselves of the idea that it was to suit British policy that a penniless man was put on the throne who now bleeds the country white to amass a private fortune. There are unfortunately many indications which lend colour to the latter part of this theory. Nevertheless it would not be true to say that the majority of the people are anti-British ; they are not. But they do feel that the British are partly responsible for their present economic condition. The check to Germany and Italy in the Near East has greatly reduced tension in this country and by the end of the year much less was thought of possible Russian aggression against Iran. Rumours of marching and counter-marching on the Iran- Russian frontiers ceased to be news. B.—BANDAR ABBAS. I.—H. M.’s CONSULATE. Personnel.- —H. M.’s Consul, Kerman, held additional charge throughout the year. Tours. —H. M.’s Consul returned to Bandar Abbas on 4th January from a short visit to Bushire and left for Kerman on 30th January. His Majesty’s Birthday. —Owing to the war the usual tea-party was not held. Consular Statistics. British subjects registered Passports issued Passports renewed .. Visas granted Documents legalised.. Fees levied 40 4 3 1 3 .. £6-0-025 J II.—BRITISH INTERESTS. Trcule .—(See under Kerman). Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. —The company maintained an agency at this port throughout the year. The local manager was in trouble with the Iranian authorities for making, or aiding the making of, a false declaration of goat-hair for wool in respect of a shipment by Ghulam Raza Agah of Kerman. The company were fined rials 10,582 and the shipper rials 31,746. The payment of these fines did not however end the matter. The company (or its manager) was further charged with bribing Iranian government servants in connection with the false declara tion and this case was pending at the close of the year. Red Oxide.—During the year 1,500 tons of red oxide were shipped from Hormuz to Avonmouth (7,500 tons in 1939) and 3,000 tons to America. Anglo-lranian Oil Co. —Owing to the war the Company did not proceed further with their surveys in the Bandar Abbas district and on Qishm Island commenced during the cold weather of 1938-39. III. —FOREIGN INTERESTS. Representation. —There was no other foreign representation at this port. Trade. —(See also under Kerman). The principal imports by this route during 1940 were from Japan (440 cases glassware, 915 bales piece goods, 1,218 cases matches), Java (35,500 bags sugar, 671 pepper, 600 coffee) and Egypt ( 34,000 bags loaf sugar). In addition some 3,540 cases of military munitions and equipment were dis charged at this port from the Italian S. S. “ Hilda ” which arrived on the 6 th June. Details of this consignment are not available. Machinery and equipment for the Fish Canning Factory was also imported via Bandar Abbas but has not so far appeared in the customs statistics. Exports included 256 bales carpets, 1,046 bags pistachio nuts, wool, goat-hair and red oxide to America and 4,758 bags of cotton seeds to Japan. IV. —LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Farmandar.' —Aqai Abbas Zarehpush assumed charge on 21 st October relieving Aqai Mustovfi of his acting appointment. Customs and Finance.- —Aqai Mina was joint director throughout the year. . From 27th November landing and customs weighing charges were doubled. Local traders lodged protests against the increased charges. Bank-i-Milli.- —The local branch functioned throughout the year but did little business. Six crudely made 100 rial notes were tendered for goods in Minab. The culprit was at once arrested and brought to Bandar Abbas for trial. Police. —Sarbahr Reza Imadi retained charge throughout the year. He investigated charges made by local people against the Lingah police and is said to have accepted rials 30,000 from his Lingah subordinate to hush the matter up. Justice.- —No important case involving British subjects came before the local courts during 1940. Posts and Telegraphs. —On three occasions the post office refused to accept delivery of mail bags from Bahrain. A reference was made to H. M.’s Minister at Tehran and eventually local authorities were instructed to accept delivery of these bags as before. Otherwise this department rendered satisfactory service to the Consulate. Edumtion.—A mixed school of four primary classes was opened in Bandar Abbas and primary schools of two classes in a number of villages in the district. Municipality. —With the arrival of the new Farmandar in October who is also ex-officio head of the municipality, steps were taken to clean up the town. Improved street lighting, provision of refuse bins, removal of old and semi-dis mantled buildings bordering on the main street, a better type of building and pavements are the first results of his administration. Health. —There were a number of cases of measles and small-pox in Februarv otherwise the health of the town and district was good. MS153EAD26 Agriculture. —Nothing was done to improve agriculture in this district. Industry and Developments. —The government hish Canning factory erected by a Danish company was completed and ready for handing o\ ei in Decepiber. Government representatives proceeded to Bandar Abbas foi the purpose but refused to take the factory over because the filter pump was not to specification. Four Danes on a three-year contract wall be on the premanent staff of this factor\ to gether with four other Danes forming the crew of the trawler. It is estimated that the factory will employ 150—200 Iranians when in full production. As most of the local employees will be recruited from neighbouring villages, accommodation for them is to be constructed near the factory. Production is hampered by a shortage of olive oil. It is understood that efforts are being made to obtain supplies overland from Turkey, Syria and Palestine. V.—MILITARY AND MARINE. Sarhang II Izazi was in command of the garrison up to November when he was removed from his post following the theft of some military stores fiom S. S. Hilda when under military guard. The troops moved up to the Ginu hills as usual for the hot weather but their stay was cutjshort owing to the number of deaths occurring among the troops there. Security. —As usual there were a number of raids on outlying villages in the Minab district during the date harvesting season. A small gang attempted to hold up a motor car by night in which the Kerman manager of the A. I. 0. C. was travelling to Bandar Abbas by placing stones across the road near the Tangi Zagh pass. The car managed to pass qyer the stones with slight dainage bpt a lorry coming behind was unable to dp sq and was looted. It is believed that this gang was successfully rounded up ; th^re were no other reports of interference on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road. There were fewer reports of hold-ups on the Bandar Abbas-Lar road, but this route cannot yet h© regarded as safe. Iranian Navy.—M\ units visited Bandar Abbas at various times during the year. VI.—COMMUNICATIONS. Roads. —No new roads were completed or under construction in the Bandar Abbas district during 1940. The construction of a motor road to Minab is still in abeyance. A contract has been given for improving the road leading into Bandar Abbas from the east; an improvement which is badly needed. Wireless. —There is no wireless station at Bandar Abbas. A viation.—No aeroplane landed at Bandar Abbas during the year and no steps were taken to maintain this emergency landing ground in a serviceable condition. It is understood that the Farmandar was instructed to find a suitable site for a new landing ground and has selected an area about 6 miles east of the town. Efe esti mates the cost of making this new landing ground at rials 400,000 (£2,200). Pro bably a quarter of this sum would suffice to enlarge and put in good condition the existing ground but it happens to be adjoining the British Consulate while the new site is near the military barracks, a circumstance which may be regarded as a sufficient justification for otherwise unnecessary expenditure. Shipping. —The B. I. S. N. Co.’s subsidiary mail service steamers called at this port wnekly (with a few exceptions) throughout the year. In addition 34 vessels with an aggregate of 129,497 tons entered and cleared at the port as follows :— British 29,464 1939. 110,977 German .. .. Nil 48,742 Japanese .. .. • • 52,978 46,147 Dutch .. .. 25,398 14,112 American .. • . .. 16,418 Nil Italian • • .. 2,973 Nil Greek 2,266 Nil 129,497 221,447 ton*.27 27 The Italian S. c&lt; Hilda ” ( 2,973 tons) arrived at Bandar Abbas on 6 th June with a mixed cargo for Iran and Iraq. ' In anticipation of Italy’s entry into the war the Master refused to proceed further although most of the Iranian cargo, which included military stores for the Iranian government, was consigned, to Bandar Shahpur. Its discharge at Bandar Abbas where there are no facilities for handling heavy cargo caused much trouble to the Iranian authorities and also in transport ation to Tehran where most of it was destined. The u Hilda ” was finally cleared of all cargo on 23rd September and was still in port at the end of the year. Arrange ments were being made for onward shipment to Basrah of approved items of cargo for Iraq. METEOROLOGICAL.

Personnel. —(a) Major A. C. Galloway of the Indian Political Service held charge throughout the year. For the month of August, R. G. Daubeny, Esquire, of the Indian Political Service, Under Secretary to the Resident, was in charge of current duties to enable the Political Agent to proceed on recess. (b) Assitsant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.B.E., I.M.D., was in charge of the Government Dispensary, and performed the duties of the Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. II.—THE RULING FAMILY. (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir As Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., the Ruler, did not leave Kuwait during the year. Shaikh Abdulla Salim, C.I.E., stayed a few days at Shaklava in Iraq but soon returned to Kuwait owing to the lack of amenities in that much vaunted Iraqi hill-station. There was no change in the distribution of the State administrative offices held by the leading members of the Subah family, though salaries were raised during the year. These rises, paid from the State income and not from the Shaikh’s oil royal ties, were intended to placate the rising generation of the Subah family who will, I surmise, soon cause considerable trouble for Ahmad. His weak attitude towards them is bound to store up trouble for himself. III.—THE POLITICAL AGENT S RELATIONS WITH THE SHAIKH. The relations between the Shaikh and the Political Agent were the same as usual. His Highness is cordial but nevertheless, in my opinion, quietly and persis tently directs his energies to resisting British influence. IV.—LOCAL INTERESTS. (a) Political—The ouststanding event of the year was the conclusion of Trade, Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements between His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia. With the conclusion of these Agreements a land blockade of Kuwait, which was imposed some 20 years ago, was raised. A rapid revival of trade followed. There was no recrudescence of the disturbances of the previous year. The ring-leaders who had failed to make good their escape continued in prison. The attitude of the Kuwaitis towards the Allies continued, on the whole, satis- i factory, and the pro-German sentiment displayed in the earlier part of the year had considerably subsided towards the end. (b) Trade. The Kuwait Trade report gives full information on matters of trade. (c) Customs .—The customs duty was raised by one-half per cent, in December to raise revenue for public health services. The State Hospital of which there has been talk for thirty years has not yet had one brick laid. {d) Council—The, council met regularly until the beginning of the hot weather. About this time Shaikh Fahad as Salim who is in charge of the Treasury, paid a visit to Bahrain during which period it was decided to seize the opportunity to inspect his accounts. On his return he was confronted at a Council meeting with certain discrepancies. In the course of his defence he spat at two members whereupon the Council broke up and did not meet again until mid-December and then only at the instigation of the Political Authorities.i 1 \ U 5 ! (e) Medical. —The number of patients treated in the Government dispensary for the year was 14,903. The prevalent sicknesses were connected with the eye and ear, and there were a larger number of influenza cases than in previous years. There were no epidemics. (/) Financial.- —The Treasury receipts increased owing to the revival of trade with Nejd. Efforts were made by the Political Authorities to induce the Shaikh to make a budget. Certain statements were produced which show a state of com plete chaos, and ignorance of elementary accounting. (&lt; 7 ) Education. —Mr. Adrian-Vallance again inspected the schools, and scarcely any improvement was found on the previous year’s workings. Relatively, however, this department of the administration is not bad. The Kuwait Oil Company sent two boys to Bahrain to the Technical School, and the State four. One boy was sent privately. (h) Building. —The short jetty at the Customs wharf which was commenced last year was finished, and provides a landing place for shallow draft boats at all stages of the tide except low water. The new prison was finished, and it is the pride of Kuwaitis that it is empty except for a few madmen. The Political prisoners are still kept in Mubarak’s dungeon. ■ A comparatively handsome building to house the Municipal offices was finished. (i) Imperial /iim’uys.-—Aeroplanes ceased to call from the early part of the year. (j) Post and Telegraphs. —In January, Messrs. Cable and Wireless concluded negotiations with the Shaikh for the taking over of the Post and Telegraph office after the completion of a wireless station. A telephone system is also to be installed. By the end of the year a considerable amount of material had been collected, but the work of the installation had not commenced. A start in training three Kuwaitis to act later as operators was made. The land-line continued to be fre quently interrupted and this, together with administrative orders issued from Baghdad without regard to the Kuwait authorities, all pointed to the desirability of the speedy establishment of a British Post Office. (k) Commercial. —The Sand and Shingle Contract was renewed between Yusuf A1 Ghanim and the Anglo Iranian Oil Co., at increased rates. The Shaikh receives a royalty of Rs. 5-8-0 on each soodrum of sand, and Rs. 6 - 8-0 of shingle. V.—DESERT INTERESTS. Tkx Kaucit fat OJb'oL ho* Srvnctf ■fajU\ fix/U/i'A O'VA. Security in the desert remained good. Owing to the lack of rain severe hard ship was felt by the bedouin though their lot was ameliorated a little by the re opened facilities for Musahala {i.e., marketing). A large number of sheep and goats died through lack of grazing and water. Up to the end of the year the drought (except for one rainfall) continued. VI.—FOREIGN INTERESTS. The Amir Sand, eldest son of Bin Saud, visited Kuwait in the early spring. The relations between Kuwait and Iraq were not marked by any outstanding incident. VII.—DATE GARDENS. In the spring His Majesty’s Government compensated the Shaikh and the Subah for past taxation imposed by the Iraqi Government and for all future taxation by paying a lump sum of £30,694, MS15JE.4DThe Iraqi Government appointed an Iraqi as Land Settlement Officer for the whole of the Basra Liwa. This appointment was, however, not within keeping ot their undertaking given to His Majesty’s Government and in the autumn u ge Good was appointed as Settlement Officer for the Subah lands. The settlement is proceeding. VIII.—KUWAIT OIL COMPANY. The dispute between the Shaikh and the Kuwait Oil Company which arose owing to the latter’s inability to declare commercial production according to the terms of their contract was settled by the Shaikh’s accepting from the Kuwait Oil Company as an advance a sum of Rs. 1 , 000,000 against future royalties in the form of a loan to be repaid in 4 yearly instalments commencing from 1944. A total footage of 11,794 feet w'as drilled during the year. No. 6 well had reached a depth of 3,750 feet by the end of the year, that is to say 1,000 feet short of the producing strata. The concrete portion of a projected jetty designed to permit of unloading ships at all stages of tide was completed early in the year. An additional ice-plant and a small cold storage unit were installed and also two new 24,000-gallon water storage tanks. Experimental work in connection with the use for road surfacing of a bitumen and sand mixture quarried from Burgan was completed. A club for the Indian clercial staff was started in Magwa. The average staff and labour strength during the year was :— British and American Staff .. .. •. • • • • 16 Indian clerical and supervising staff .. .. • .. • • 17 Indian atrizans .. .. • • • • • • • • 34 Arab clerical staff and labour ., .. .. • • • • 207 Total ,. 274 IX. —W T ATER. Work in connection with the search for fresh water was commenced by the Kuwait Oil Company in the southern section of the State, and a total footage of 1,777 feet was drilled. Drilling was commenced in mid-September, and four wells had been sunk by the end of the year. The westernmost of these near Minaqish, struck water containing 3,100 p. m. dissolved solids at a depth of 530 feet, and the water rose in the bore to 270 feet from the surface. This result is the best so far. X. —SULPHUR. In the early spring Mr. R. O. Rhoades arrived in Kuwait to negotiate for a con cession to extract sulphur. After comparatively brief negotiations the Shaikh agreed to give to the Eastern Gulf Oil Co., an option for one and a half years to be followed by a concession for 75 years. Rs. 75,000 were paid to the Shaikh for the option. The Kuwait Oil Company were not interested in the project. XL—ROYAL NAVY. There were no visits from ships of His Majesty’s Navy. XIL—ROYAL AIR FORCE. The Royal Air Force prepared a new landing ground to the south of the town, and used this on all occasions. The visits of aircraft continued to be numerous and several visits were paid by the Shaibah Armoured Car Section.XIIL—VISITORS. Besides three visits from the Hon’ble the Political Resident, one from the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, in his capacity as Chief Quarantine Medical Officer ; and one from the Vice-Consul, Bushire, the visitors, during the year included Mr. F. W. Humphrey, Cable and Wireless Ltd., Karachi Mr. H. Weightman, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain .. Major F. Holmes .. .. .. • • Mr. R. 0.

Adrian-Valla nee held charge through out the year. 3. Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifah Family. — {i) The seventh anniversary of the accession of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrain, was celebrated on the 7th February 1940 and the two succeeding days. War robbed the celebrations of much of their usual colour but the loyalty and affection borne by all classes towards His Highness were amply demonstrated. {ii) In the last two or three years some of the younger members of the Shaikhly family, though not sons of Shaikh Hamad himself, have caused considerable scandal by their drunkenness. His Highness therefore determined to deal firmly with them and has done so in the case of Shaikh Ali, son of His Highness’ brother Shaikh Abdullah, by banishing him to the lonely island of Hawar for a time. (Hi) His Highness’ brother, Shaikh Mohammed bin Tsa, unwisely boarded an Italian ship from Alexandria to proceed to Beirut. The ship, however, pro ceeded to Italy. Eventually he got to Malta and later arrived at Alexandria, from where he came overland to Bahrain. The reception accorded to him by the Family as a war-battered hero, was remarkable. 4.

Special police Were enlisted by the Bharain Government for the Defence and protection of the Bharain Petroleum Company Area and were placed under the command of the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf. This year batches of Naturs went through a course of training with the State Police and have been taught a little drill and the use of rifles. Havildar Abdulkarim bin Haji Sulman returned from the Police Training School at Nasik and was appointed Sub-Inspector of Police. i The amount of crime was small, the most serious case being that of a relation of the Ruling Family being convicted for treason and sentenced to 10 years’ im prisonment. Motor accidents showed a decrease and the state of public security was satis factory. 5. Local Affairs.—(i) The Agency flagstaff was dressed on New Year’s Day. Calls were received from His Hignness the Ruler of Bahrain, members of the A1 Khalifah family, and leading members of the Indian, Arab and Persian Com munities. (ii) The news of Italy’s entry into the war was greeted with expressions of contempt and hatred for the Italians whose barbarities in Tripoli and Abyssinia are remembered. Subsequent news of the virtual defeat of France confused the people, though their main interest was to hear about the future of French possessions in North Africa and Syria. News of the final surrender of France had a less dis turbing effect on the local population than might have been expected. (in) It was generally known in Bahrain that an Italian submarine was sunk somewhere near the entrance to the Persian Gulf in July, and that the prisoners taken from the submarine were brought to Bahrain and later sent to India. The secret was kept remarkably well while they were here. (iv) The Oil Refinery of the Bharain Petroleum Company was bombed on the 19th October 1940. At about 3-15 a.m. two, or possibly three, machines approach ed Bahrain from a westerly direction and after circling over the refinery at a height between two and three thousand feet dropped salvos of bombs, a number of which failed to explode. Some 84 bombs were dropped, all of them of small calibre. They fell very wide of the target and there were no casualties and no damage was done. Bombs were dropped on the Oil Fields of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company at Dharan, Saudi Arabia, the same morning, probably by the same enemy aircraft. There were no casualties, but slight damage was done to an oil and water pipeline. (v) The Rev. Fr. Irzio Luigi Magliacani, an Italian subject, was deported from Bahrain and left for Bombay on the 13th November 1940. After the raid, public feeling against him became intense and reached a pitch when it was felt impossible to guarantee his safety. 6 . Bahrain Petroleum Company, (i) Chief Local Representative.- —Lieutenant Commander J.’S. Black who was recalled for service in the Navy relinquished his office as Chief Local Representative to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and left for India on the 7th July 1940. From then onwards, the position was filled by Dr. R. A. Kennedy. (ii) Resident Manager. —Mr. M. H. Lipp held charge throughout the year. (Hi) Field Development — Whole. —Total production during 1940 was 7,073,919 barrels of oil, giving a daily average of 19,328 barrels. Throughout the year, oil production was held close to 20,000 B/D, except for two weeks emergency period in October and November, during which the majority of wells were shut in. The process of gas injection has helped to keep the pressure decline under satisfactory control.(iv) Royalty to the Bahrain Government. 1st Half 2nd Half (*;) At the end of the year, Company’s British .. .. Canadians Americans British Indians Bahrainis Others {vi) In accordance with the agreement entered into between His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Company has conducted extensive exploration operations within the dominions of the Shaikh, particularly in the Additional Area. Though the work is being constantly con tinued, it has not advanced to the point where final conclusions are justified. {vii) Refinery .—No new operating facilities were installed during 1940, though major improvements or additions were made in the Power Plant, Crude Distillation Units, S 02 Plant, Cracking Plant, and Pitch Pond. (viii) Alterations were made both at Sitra and Zellaq to facilitate loading and un-loading. Pipelines were re-routed and a new tank constructed at Zellaq. Areas of the Refinery, the anchorage, and Awali Camp were considerably increased. Many improvements were made in the living and recreational facilities for the staff of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, while all offices were air cooled during summer. A programme of housing for natives was started and 26 hollow concrete block houses are being built, part near Awali and part at Rafa Camp. (ix) As a Defence measure, Air Raid Shelters were constructed for the benefit of the staff of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. (x) This year saw the completion of the agreement entered into between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Shaikh of Bahrain enabling the Company to extend drilling operations outside the previously leased area in the Shaikhdom of Bahrain. 7 . Agriculture.- —(i) After the Assistant Adviser ceased to serve the Bahrain Government, the experimental garden at Budaya was handed over to the Public ' W.vi. Works Department. European vegetables, including potatoes, were grown in the spring of 1940 and sold in the bazar. (ii) At the suggestion of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf a herd of white cattle was purchased from Alwar, but their suitability for Bahrain cannot be judged yet. (in) The services of an agricultural adviser from Egypt have been asked for by the Bahrain State. 7 . Municipalities, (a) Manamah.—Some important roads were widened during the year, new roads were planned and laid down on the South and South- West of Manamah town, while about five miles of town roads were surfaced and oiled. 36,000 square feet of swamp was filled in wi^th stone and a considerable area of swamp filled in or surfaced. It was found necessary to cut many shops for the purpose of road widening, but new ones were constructed in compensation. After the abnormally heavy rain at the end of the month of October, large parts of the town were flooded and remained so for two months in spite of every effort to induce the Adviser and the State Engineer to take some action. Ditches have at least been dug and the water is draining away. Es. a. p. 15,26,886 8 0 14,42,580 12 0 employees numbered as follows :— 143 19 55 352 1,837 346 Total .. 2,752Supervision of all markets is said to continue, but filth is much in evidence in the streets and complaints from residents have been received. (b) Muharraq and Hedd. —Extensive repairs were done to roads, artesian wells and water places. The road from Customs to His Highness’ house was widened and the Sea Road was extended as far as the school. 9 . Customs. —The Customs revenue amounted to Rs. 8,91,721, as compared with Rs. 10,56,532 during 1939. 10. Public Works.—{a) The following important public works were completed during the year :— The State Hospital (for Men and for Women) and staff quarters. Fort tower and main wall. Muharraq Sea Road Extension (Municipal). Police Post at Jaw. (b) The following works were commenced during the year but not completed :— 1 New Technical School. Government Hospital, Administration Block (surgery, etc.). The Manamah—Muharraq bridge. Wet, A, 11 . Electric Department—The load showed a steady increase till November 1940, when it was curtailed owing to lighting restrictions imposed on the whole of Bahrain under the Defence Regulations. Revenue from the sale of Electricity amounted to Rs. 1,25,000 as compared with Rs. 1,19,000 in 1939. Additions were also made in the Electric Department. A new high-tension sub-station, complete with 50 K. W. transformer and switch gear, was erected at the Naval Base, Jufair, at the expense of the Admiralty, while at Muharraq, a low-tension overhead line was run along the new sea road extension for fighting and general supply purposes. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued. Thirty five air con ditioned units were in public service during the summer of 1940. The number of telephone subscribers on the 31st December was 87 as compared with 80 on the 31st December 1939. The total revenue of this department was Rs. 1,81,648 and the total expenditure Rs. 1,64,683. Out of this Rs. 64,844 was spent on establishment charges, a large figure for such a small undertaking. Accounts do not appear to be properly kept in this Department. Charges for electricity are much too high and there is general discontent with the whole state of affairs. (See paragraph 11 of last year’s report.) 12 . Pearling Industry. —The 1940 summer season was poor. The catch was small and the pearl business was almost at a standstill. The depression in the pearl industry was to a slgiht extent offset by the Government’s building work, • which gave employment to stone cutters and boatmen. The advances made during 1940 were an year. They were as follows :— Tesquam .. Salaf Kharjieh .. increase of Rs. 5 on the previous Drivers. Pullers. Rs. Rs. 25 20 25 20 20 2036 « £ V . jJj 13.

British Interests. — (i) Lieutenant Alwan Farhan of the ’Iraq Levies arrived here on the 12 th September 1940, to take up an appointment under the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, at Bahrain. (ii) The Bahrain Broadcasting Station commenced operations on the 4th November 1940 at 11-00 G. M. T. The time has now been changed to 16*00 G.M.T. and the broadcast appears to be popular. 15. Post Office, (a) Postmaster. —Mr. Kanwar-Singh held charge of the office from the 21 st March, 1940, having taken over, on this date, from Mr. Zaffar Hussain. The total number of the staff on the 31st December 1940 was 6. The following are the figures for Registration of letters and parcels :—(m) State Medical Hospital— Dt. R. H. B. Snow took over charge on the 24th April 1940 from Dr. M. M. McDowell, who was acting in the absence of a State Medical Officer. The work of these two, the latest recruits to State Employ, is praised by all communities in Bahrain. Men’s Section.

Malaria, Venereal Disease and Trachoma (eye disease) continue to be the main forms of disease. Trachoma is undoubtedly the most deadly disease in Bahrain. The anti-Malarial campaign accounts for the decrease in malaria but the incidence of venereal disease is, if anything, on the increase. In the Government Hospital, the women’s section was opened at the end of May and the men’s side on June 15th. The Police Hospital, originally closed to in-patients, was opened in December as an Isolation Hospital for venereal disease and tuberculosis. (Hi) Among other steps being taken to reduce malaria in Manama, the Anti- Malaria Committee had decided to arrange for the closing of all shallow wells in compounds within 200 yards of public artesian water supplies. These shallow wells have been used solely for washing purposes and their numbers have grown enormously in recent years. They have been a prolific source of mosquito breeding. The closing of these shallow wells caused a great deal of agitation among the inha bitants. Meetings were accordingly held and, in order to fit in with a scheme for a real public water supply and for proper drainage, the six circles in which surface wells were to be filled in were reduced to a radius of 200 feet, while constant care was taken to ensure the supply of larvicidal fish in shallow wells in the rest of the town. (i v ) The women’s section of the State Hospital was opened by Her Highness Shaikha Ayesha on the 25th May in the presence of a large gathering of Arab and European ladies. 17. Judicial, (a) Bahrain Government.- —No change in composition of Courts was experienced. There was a decline in the number of important cases, due partly, to the few diving cases. The Shia Shara Court, unlike previous years, continues to run smoothly, mainly due to the work of the Shia Appeal Kadi. (h) Agency Courts. Civil Suits Criminal Cases 18. Visits of British Notables.—(i) His Excellency Sir Basil Newton, K.C.M.G., His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad, arrived here from Muscat with his Secretary Mr. M. Man on the 10 th March and stayed at the Agency. He lunched informally with His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifah at Sakhir on the 11 th, and visited the Oil Field and Refinery on the following day. Accompanied by the Political Agent, the Ambassador made an inspection of the activities of the'California Arabian Standard Oil Company at Dhahran. He visited Ras Tanura, Safwa and Qatif before returning to Bahrain on the 14th. He returned to Basra by air on the 16th March. (ii) The Hon’ble P. C. Spender, K.C., Minister for Army, Commonwealth of Australia and party passed through Bahrain on the 31st December 1940 en route to Egypt. They were met on the landing pier by the Political Agent. MS153EAD38 &gt; 19. Visits of Arab Notables. — {i) On the 4th April, General Sir Nuri as Said, Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, passed through Bahrain in a Royal Air Force plane on their way to Ibn Saud s camp. The party was met by the Political Agent, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, Shaikh Abdullah, Shaikh Salman and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and lunched at Shaikh Abdullah’s house near the aerodrome. His Highness the Shaikh was indisposed that day. They again passed through Bahrain on the 7th April on their way back to Iraq, their mission having been a great success. (u) His Royal Highness the Amir Saud arrived here from A1 Khobar en route to India on the evening of the 19th April with some of his younger brothers. He was received privately at the Customs pier by His Highness and his Family. The Amir Saud was as charming as ever and expressed his and Ibn Saud’s gratitude for the arrangements made by the Government of India. He referred also to thnr strong sympathy for the Allied Cause. (Hi) Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of Ajman, arrived here on the 5th May 'Wial on a friendly visit to the Shaikh of Bahrain. He returned to Aiman on the 20 th eo '^ lr May. (iv) His Royal Highness the Amir Saud arrived here from India by special plane on the evening of the 8 th June, very much improved in health. He was received at the aerodrome by Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Assistant Political Agent, the Political Agent being absent from Bahrain. His Highness the Shaikh met the Amir at the end of the causeway and took him to the Palace. On the evening of the 9th June the Amir was entertained by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. He left Bahrain for A1 Khobar by launch on the 10 th. While he was here he expressed his gratitude for the assistance given to him by the Government of India. 20. Qatar.- — (i) The Petroleum Concessions (Qatar) Limited had their first small show of oil in their test well near Zekrit towards the end of 1939. In 1940, Co ^ a further test was made by them and the results were most satisfactory. (ii) It is reported that a squabble occurred on the 30th May between minor members of the Qasim and Ahmad sections of the Qatar Shaikhly family. Shaikh Hamad, the heir-apparent, tried to turn this into a major issue and demanded that the Ahmad party should either be disarmed or deported. The Shaikh of Qatar held a meeting at which there was a good deal of excitement but it seems probable that the whole matter has been settled without recourse to drastic action. Shaikh Hamad’s attitude was probably influenced by difficulties following the distribution (or more likely the non-distribution) of the oil money which was paid by the Company on the 17th May. (Hi) Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim A1 Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar, left for the Haj with his heir-apparent Shaikh Hamad and some seventy members of his family. His eldest son Shaikh Aii was in charge during his absence. 21. Petroleum Concessions Limited, (i) Qatar Exploration, (a) Wells and Drilling. —No. 1 Well was completed to its final depth of 5,685 feet at the end of 1939 at which point a promising oil “ showing ” was struck, A test was carried out in January 1940. During the year 1940 a certain amount of oil from this well was used on road construction and maintenance essential to the Company’s further exploration programme. No. 2 W T ell, 10 miles South of No. 1 , was commenced on the 18th June and by the end of December 1940 had reached a depth of 4,798 feet and correlates fairly closely to No. 1 . This test-well will be carried on as deep as the rig and circum stances permit.39 &amp; TyvCIO, l £oc\.*Z* Preparations are in train for the commencement of No. 3 Well, a few kilometres North of No. 1. (6) Staff .-—On an average, personnel in Qatar consisted of some 8 British. 5 Americans. 28 Indians (clerks, artizans servants). 300 Qataris. These figures do not include Bahrain staff, 2 British. 12 Indians (clerks and servants). 20 Bahrainis (clerks, peons, launch crews), employed for the most part on Qatar services as Bahrain is and must be for some time to come the base, port and link with the outside world for parties operating in Qatar. Qataris are at present being trained as drivers, rig workers and in semi-skilled labour of various kinds. There is no literate class and the clerical staff is almost entirely Indians. The Qatari worker is on the whole willing and amenable to camp discipline and gives singularly little trouble. This satisfactory state of affairs is somewhat marred by the heir-apparent and other Arab officials whose control of recruitment is guided by personal greed. Co operation with the Government (in effect the Shaikh, the heir-apparent and the Shaikh’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs) in employment matters is essential at this stage as there is no law nor order apart from the Shaikh and his bodyguard, and no other approach to the labour market would be countenanced. Apart from the annual concession payment to the Shaikh the Qatar people themselves benefited to the extent of some three lakhs of rupees in cash, spent by the Company in Qatar during 1940. 2 J lakhs was expended in Bahrain for Qatar operations. (c) Qatar Terminal Survey. —In December 1940 a short preliminary examina tion of the coastal waters of the east coast of Qatar was made with a view to locating a “ terminal ” future oil export. (d) Water. —To date no potable artesian water has been located and as has been previously reported geological opinion rules out the possibility of any sub stantial supplies becoming available. 2 . Tracial Coast Exploration. —Owing to conditions created by the war to send geological and geophysical parties to the Trucial Coast in 1940 were cancelled and the various Eulers notified to this effect. In all cases the Rulers replied that the reasons for postponement were fully appreciated, and hopes for an early British victory were expressed. 22 . Foreign Interests. —Mr. H. A. Paul Knabenshue, United States Minister for ’Iraq, arrived here on the 24th March accompanied by the United States Vice- Consul at Baghdad, Mr. W. J.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT FOR THE Y^EAR 1940. Part I. 1 . Agency Officials- Political Agent Medical Officer Treasury Officer Captain T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., from 1st January, 1940, to 2nd April, 1940. Captain J. B. Howes acted in the appoint ment from 3rd April, 1940, to 25th July, 1940. Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., from 26th July, 1940, to 31st December, 1940. Military Assistant Surgeon C. E. Hynes, I.M.D., throughout the year. Khan Sahib Maqbool Hussain Khan from 1st January, 1940, to 8th March, 1940. Captain T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., from 9th March, 1940, to 2nd April, 1940. Khan Sahib Maqbool Hussain Khan from 3rd April, 1940, to 31st December, 1940. 2. Medical, {a) General—In. February a few cases of small-pox occurred in Matrah and there was every indication that an epidemic was starting but prompt action by the Medical Authorities proved effective and the infection was localised, contracts being taken to the Quarantine Station. ^The problems of sanitation and malaria are now being dealt with by the Muscat Government. It has been decided to introduce a simple sanitary system in 1941 and funds are being provided for this purpose and for anti-malaria measures by the Municipality. The Agency has agreed, at the Sultan’s request to advise on the introduction and working of these measures which are the outcome of a scheme pre pared by the Agency for the Sultan eighteen months ago. (b) Agency Has k—Treatment at the “ Out-Patient ” Department has continued to be free and funds provided by public subscription have proved ample to meet the cost of drugs and appliances. The re-laying of the hospital floors was completed during the year and new instruments to the value of £86 were purchased from England. Attendances and admittances during the year were as follows :— “ Out-Patient ” Department .. .. .. •• 25,771 persons. Admitted into the hospital Major and minor operations performed Maternity cases Gynaecological cases (c) Quarantine. —Quarantine restrictions were imposed against Karachi for small-pox on two occasions. The quarantine buildings are on the whole in good condition. The examina tion of dhows using the port is still by no means perfect but the new police regula tions have included certain elementary rules making it incumbent on nakhundas to declare cases of sickness among the passengers and crew. 3 . Political Situation, {a) General.—Two minor disturbances occurred during the year. One at Gwadur in November when the Governor’s matrimonial intentions resulted in unrest among the Baluchis of the Nigor, and the other at Dhibah where a quarrel broke out between the Jawasim subjects of the Sheikh of Kalba and the Shi huh subj ects of the Sultan over a servant of the former. The Sultan took prompt action in each case sending a commission to Gwadur to enquire into the grievances of the Baluchis and despatching the Governor of Sohar, Mudhaffar bin Suleiman, with plenipotentiary powers to Dhibah. The Gwadur commission reported against the Governor who has been censured and whose recall has been decided upon. The Goveror of Sohar was successful in restoring the situation to normal at Dhibah where he seems to have co-operated well with Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, and the Sheikh of Fujairah who acted as an intermediary during the negotiations. In March the murder by men of the Beni Hassan of a Saudi subject who was a Qadi of the Beni Bu Ah resulted in unrest between those two tribes which conti nued with varying intensity throughout the year, but at the close of the year peace appeared to have been restored. There was no other tribal strife worthy of notice and the year has on the whole been a peaceful one. 139 persons. 565 3 1 ■a?(b) Oman .—The Sultan’s influence has undoubtedly increased in Oman as a result of his policy of peaceful penetration which takes the form of encouraging visits from important Sheikhs and strict observance of the tenets of the Abadi faith. The process must necessarily be a long one and it will not be possible to estimate the extent to which the Sultan’s influence has increased until the present Imam either dies or is forced to abdicate. The Sultan’s relations with the two principal supporters of the Imam, Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi of the Sharqiah and Sheikh Suleiman bin llamiyar of Jebel Akhdar, have remained good. The Imam receives the support of these two Sheikhs from very different motives. Sheikh ’Isa bin Saleh is a bigoted Abadlii and his antipathy to the Sultan and his regime is a religious one and therefore all the more difficult to overcome. It is unlikely that this Sheikh will ever be on really friendly terms with His Highness or his successors. Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar’s alliance with the Imam is from personal motives. In order to ensure his continued support the Imam has permitted him to acquire more influence and power than would ever have been his had he remained loyal to the Al Bu Said family. Suleiman bin Hamiyar well knows that the Sultan would be willing to grant him the privileges of an important Sheikh and any serious threat to the power of the Imam would probably result in his deserting his patron and making his peace with Muscat. &gt; The most important political event of the year was the visit of Sheikh ’Isa bin Saleh al Harthi to Muscat. He arrived with several members of his family on the 27th of February and remained in Muscat until the 3rd of April when he went to Bahrain for medical treatment. He returned to Muscat in the middle of May and remained until the 13th of June when he left for Oman. A fortnight after Sheikh ’Isa bin Saleh arrived from Oman, that is about the 15th of March, he became serious ly ill with pneumonia and was attended by the Agency Assistant Surgeon and Dr. W. W. Thoms of the American South Arabian Mission. Due entirely to the efforts of these two doctors Sheikh ’Isa bin Saleh recovered and with his usual lack of breed ing and good manners refrained from in any way expressing either his thanks or his gratitude to them for saving his life. Sheikh Suleiman bin Sinan of Yankul spent three months in Muscat towards the end of the year and a number of other important tribal Sheikhs paid visits, some of these for the first time. Most of the important Sheikhs who visited the Sultan during the course of the year have also called at the Agency. Even Sheikh Tsa bin Saleh al Harthi found it convenient to call. The Persians invaded Muscat in 1737 and remained in possession until they were forced to withdraw in 1744 by Ahmad bin Said the founder of the Al Bu Said dynasty. Fear of a Persian invasion is always present in the hearts of the Omanis, normally dormant it is awakened to their realisation by any major world crises news of which penetrates into their country. In November the Sultan received a letter from Sheikh ’Isa bin Saleh al Harthi which amounted to an offer of services in the event of any aggressive action by Iran and of course a request for arms and ammuni tion which was very properly ignored. At the same time the Imam indicated in a letter from one of his principal satellites that he proposed to send a representa tive to discuss the situation with the Sultan after the Ramazan and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar indicated in a letter that he himself would like an invitation to Muscat for the same purpose. . ^ sutA u 1^4 (c) Local .— The two Ministers who were appointed last year continued to hold ni ,|-, . : - office but their actual power has not increased and all matters of the slightest j u. ' b 'g importance are referred to the Sultan. The Director of Customs has been busy n-. • ^ • ' a during the year examining the economic situation and considering methods for increasing the State income. He has also compiled comprehensive Customs Regu lations in which task he received considerable aid from the Agency. The Regula tions although complete will not be introduced until January 1941. There have been one or two changes in the officials, the most important of which was the appointment in December of Saiyid Mahmood bin Mohammad bin Turki a first cousin once removed of the Sultan, to the Governorship of Birkah. ’ c 0 eu- k.u « ; Two members of the Ruling Family gave trouble during the year. One was - r. rc ,v Saiyid Mahmood bin Mohammad bin Turki who became intoxicated and created a disturbance in Muscat town in January, and the other was Sand bin Ali bin Salim, a maternal uncle, who insulted Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal in February. They both spent the remainder of the year in Jalali Fort.44 4. Oil concessions, (a) Muscat Oil. —Owing to world conditions no work has icen done and further exploration has been postponed for the time being. (b) Gwadur Oil. There has been no change in the situation since last year. 5. Judicial.- Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 6 . Trade. The following table shows the total imports and exports during the year 1939-40 as compared with the figures for the previous year :— ■ ^ ear - Imports. Exports. Rs. Rs. J ^ 38 ' 39 48,76,193 33,31,939 1939-40 .. .. .. .. 46,49,765 34,55,795 It will be seen that while during the year 1939-40 imports have decreased by Ks. 2,26,428 exports have increased by Rs. 1,23,856. The principal articles of import were rice and piece-goods and those of export were dry and wet dates and dried fish. Japan remained the chief supplier of piece- goods, matches and cement, and India supplied practically the whole of the cereals. 7. Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, (a) Royal Navy. —No ships of the Royal Navy visited Muscat during the year. (b) Royal Air Force. The Royal Air Force maintained their wireless station at Muscat throughout the year. The staff at present consists of three European lFT ^ 01 - 8 s t a ^ on A s direct wireless communication with Shaibah and Habbamyah in Iraq, \isits of Royal Air Force aircraft to Muscat are given in Appendix “ A ” to this report. 8 Aviation. No machines of the K. L. M. Company or the Air France Company landed at Gwadur during the year and there is no indication that the former com pany intends to ask for the renewal for 1941 of the special authorisation granted for 9. French Interests. The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. ° , T . ^ ss ^ ar y Work. The Missionary work of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) has been carried on by the Rev &amp; Mrs. Dykestra. They left for their usual hot weather visit to bouth India in September and returned in November. Dr. W. W. Thoms remained in charge of the medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah. « ^ , MlS ! i0 ^ have 1 ginned to pay visits to Birkah where Dr. Thoms attends Out-Fatients at the. Mission hutment. c , ,^ n November Dr. Thoms visited Jebel Akhdar at the invitation of Sheikh Su ennan bm Hamiyar to attend a relative of the Sheikh who had been gored by a hull. The Rev. D Dykestra accompanied him and the visit appears to have been generally successful. The Sultan was annoyed that the visit was paid without his permission and has restricted the touring of the members of the Mission to the Batmah coast region. An X-Ray apparatus has been installed in the Mission hospital at Matrah n- Slave Trade.—-During the year thirty-two slaves applied for manumission certificates and twenty-three slaves w/ere manumitted. Of the thirty-two applicants eighteen were captured slaves (of whom twelve were manumitted) and the remainder were domestic slaves. No case of slave trading has been reported and the Batinah area has been particularly quiet This is due to the interest taken m the suppression of the trade by the Sultan and frequent touring by the Political Agent. Any diminution in these activities to suppress the trade would result in an immediate recrudescence. 12 . Weather.--The total rainfall during the year was 2-91 inches. The lack of rain was felt throughout the year and the local drinking water supply was unpleasantly salt. Many wells have dried up and the authorities are concerned at the prospect of a serious shortage. As an experimental measure a dam has been constructed in the Wadi al Kabir with the object of testing the porosity of the Wadi bed to see if water would remain for a sufficient time to warrant the construction of a dam sufficiently high to retain enough water for the population for four to five months thus conserving the supply from the wells The dam was filled during rain storm in December but more time must elapse before the. result of the experiment is known. ♦ADMINISTRATION RETORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, . FOR THE YEAR 1940. Part II. 1 . Ruling Family, (a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur. —Relations between the Agency and the Palace have remained extremely cordial and on seve ral occasions the Sultan has entered into the social life of the town besides playing tennis regularly at the Agency. The Sultan paid a short visit to Dhofar from the 25th of February to the 24th of JMarch. In April he went to India where he remained for three months returning to Muscat in July. He spent most of his time in India in Bombay paying a short visit to Poona and another to Calcutta. In August he made a tour of the Batinah towns going as far north as Shinas to which he had previously never travelled by car. This tour was a success and stimulated the energies of the Governors to make more of an effort than they had previously done to repair and renew their fortifications. In December the Sultan was delighted to hear that his wife, who is living in Dhofar, had given birth to a male child. There was great satisfaction in Muscat and the child has been accepted generally as the heir. He has been named Kaboos and is to remain in Dhofar for the present with his mother who is a lady of good family from a Dhofari tribe. The Sultan was particularly gratified to receive the congratulations of His Majesty the King on the event. (b) Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal. —He has retained his appointment as Minister for External Affairs and was left in charge during the absence of the Sultan in Dhofar and Bombay. Should the Sultanate become vacant there is little doubt that he would act as Regent for the Sultan’s minor son while should any misfortune befalls the child Saiyid Shahab would succeed as Sultan. He is an intelligent man and very well disposed towards Great Britain but unfortunately his somewhat harsh disposition has made him unpopular. (c) Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim.' —He has retained his appointment throughout the year. He has not brought himself before the public eye at all and has been content to carry on his duties to the best of his ability and lay out a garden at Riyam, a village between Muscat and Matrah. (d) Saiyid Mahmood bin Mohammad bin Turki. —Saiyid Mahmood remained unemployed for the greater part of the year. He and his brother Ali bin Mohammad bin Turki were thought in May and June to be voicing opinions not in accord with the Sultan’s attitude of extreme friendliness to the British Government. The matter came to the Sultan’s ears and Saiyid Mahmood and his brother were threat ened with imprisonment in Jalali Fort. In the autumn the Sultan consulted the Agency regarding certain changes in the Governors which he considered desirable. It was suggested to him that Saiyid Mahmood would be better employed in directing his active brain to the solution of the problems of a Wilayat than idling away his time in Muscat. In December the Sultan appointed him Governor of Birkah. His attitude now is distinctly pro-British. (e) Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur. —He accompanied the Sultan to India and on his return to Muscat was ii^fcrbucted to make himself acqua(p^bed with the machinery of Government. The Sultan was concerned about his lack of application and laziness. He sought the advice of the Agency pointing out that no one other than himself was prepared to reprimand Saiyid Tarik who might one day quite conceiv ably become Sultan and therefore the young man was doing just what he liked when not actually under his eye. The Sultan was advised to send Saiyid Tarik to Bait- al-Falaj for a six months course of training under the Military Adviser, Major A. 0. C. Pettyfer, who would report to the Sultan on the young man’s character and general ability. Saiyid Tarik joined Muscat Infantry as a private soldier in October being treated in every way as a recruit except that he occupied an Indian Officer’s quarter and had his own private servant. He has made good progress and is now being instructed in the principles of leadership with a view to his acting as a platoon and afterwards company commander. He has benefited both physically and mentally by the active and busy life of Bait-al-Falaj. (f) “ Mr. T. F.T. Al Saeed ”.—He left Japan in September and made his wav via Singapore and Calcutta to Karachi arriving there in November. He was accompanied by his half Japanese daughter and Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily MS153EAD46 the Sultan’s Secretary who was sent to Singapore to meet him. He will probably reside permanently in Karachi where he has taken a house and where he will be joined by his wife, the Sultan’s mother, early in 1941. (g) 'Ismail bin Khalil Rassasi.-A. Palestinian subject who came to Muscat as a school master fourteen years ago. A man of considerable ability he has worked his way up to the important governorship of Matrah. He has recently been employ ed by the Sultan to carry out inspection tours ot the Batman and Wilayats. lie has considerable influence with the Sultan and was at one time thought to ho c anti-British views. Closer contact with him has shown that while naturally^ favour ing the cause of the Arabs in Palestine his views are by no means anti-British and he has throughout the year willingly co-operated with the Agency m the many matters affecting the interests of the British subjects in Matrah. Since the out break of the war he has been helpful in spreading pro-British propaganda. (h) Suleiman al Baruni al Nafusi. —He accompanied the Sultan to Bombay in April and died there of heart failure on the 30th of April. For years he had hoped and prayed that the call would come for him to return to North Africa to w r ork for the liberation of his country, Tripoli. By a queer twist of fortune the call came six weeks after his death in the form of an urgent request for his ser\ ices from the French General Officer Commanding, North Africa with instructions for him to be sent to Algiers by the quickest means. 2 . Trade and Commerce. —This subject has already been dealt with in Part 1 of this report. 3 . Municipality. —The Municipality have continued their efforts to clean up the town with considerable success and Muscat has a much less dilapida ted appear ance than it had. Unfortunately no new work has been taken in hand and no improvements to the roads or open spaces have been made. The inertia, of the President and his Committee has caused the Sultan to seek the Agency s help. Naturally help has not been refused and the President has received advice on the Municipal Budget for 1941. 4 . Education. —The new school building at Muscat was completed in December and was formally opened by the Sultan who took the opportunity to address the notables present on the importance of education. The building is a pleasant looking edifice of re-inforced concrete. The class rooms are large and airy and the walls are sufficiently thick to prevent the labours of one class disturbing the studies of the one next door. The headmaster is a Palestinian who has recently arrived and who will probably be followed by other masters as the attendance at the school increases. It is hoped to add a boarding establishment next year to cater for the sons of people living in the interior and up the Batihah coast. 5. General Communications. — Mr. J. A. Faithful remained in charge of the local office of the Cable k Wireless Limited, throughout the year. The Bushire cable was repaired in the middle of January and the Karachi cable during the first week of February. The cables remained serviceable the greater part of the year but the Bushire cable again broke in December and had not been repaired by the end of the year. 6 . Police. training of the police in routine procedure was successfully carried out by Mr. Azizullah Khan, a retired Prosecuting Inspector from the United Provinces. Unfortunately this officer was lacking in personality and no discipli narian and became more of a figure of fun than of fear to the lower elements in the population. The Sultan decided, on the advice of the Military Adviser, that an officer of quite a different type was essential and Mr. Azizullah’s services were terminated on the expiration of his probationary period. The police force has been placed under the Military Adviser for discipline and training and under the Minister for External Affairs for policy and police duties. By the end of the year Mr. Azizullah had not been replaced although every effort was being made to obtain a suitable individual. At the request of the Sultan the Agency prepared for te Muscat Government “ Harbour and Police ” rules which were approved by the Sultan and came into force early in April. 7 . Muscat Infantry .-—An important part of the defence measures rendered necessary by the war and for which the Sultan is in receipt of financial assistance has been the increase in the-strength of |he Muscat Infantry from 150 all ranks, to, ■ 47 355 all ranks. The Sultan asked for the assistance of a British Officer to undertake the raising of the additional men and the organising and training of the Muscat InfaX Major A. 0. C. Pettyfer of the 10 th Bale* Regiment was selected to undertake this work and he arrived at Muscat on the 5 th of March. The wor - has been ably carried out and the Muscat Infantry may now be considered as a well eouipped and organised force trained in the use of their arms. The force has been organised into a Headquarter Company comprising signalling, artillery, machine gun and administration platoons and two Rifle Companies of three P^tooiis each. In addition to rides the force is armed with two 2 • 75 mountains guns three 3 -pounct- er Q F guns, seven machine guns and four light automatics. The force is o cere by three Viceroy Commissioned Indian Officers on deputation from the Indian Army and one locally recruited Baluch Jamadar. The living accommodation at Baibal-Falaj has been much improved and there is a well equipped hospitel charae of a qualified medical officer. A training camp was held at Bosher m November and the Company Commanders were able to put into practice the theories thev had learnt in barracks while the Military Adviser, who was himself in camp, was able to test the efficiency and practicability of the organisation which he had .1 instructor on ipntstion .ton, the Indian Army are met by the State. ^ _ K State Finances. — The Sultan retained personal control of the State hnan- i ‘ „ t p e year From figures produced by the Sultan and from careful enqui- rSt Ins clear That inspite of considerable increase in the expenditure which had n&lt; f u totted for the State has not only succeeded in paying its way but has taet that the Director of Customs underestimated his receipts by Ks. b 08 d 87 ' tect that the eireeto ^ f off ^ into Muscat owmg to the disturb- world trade and”expected the abnormally large imports in the last t Af l 939 to effect adversely imports in 1940.

(a) War Measures .—The Sultan has continued to indentify him self witii the Allied cause and his expressions of friendship have the merit ot being sincere. He has followed with interest the varying fortune of the British forces and has never, even in the dark days of May and June, lost faith in the ultimate success of the British Empire. Notifications forbidding trading with the enemy have been issued by the State and the Sultan has issued precise instructions to his Governors to prevent Muscat dhows from carrying goods to the Italian Colonies. The prohibition of the export of silver except in the form of rupee coin has been contir ued throughout the year. The local reserve of foodstuffs was reduced in December from three months’ supply to one and a half months’ supply. It became possible to do this when the shipping position in the Persian Gulf made it unlikely that there would be any prolonged delay in the arrival of steamers from India. The work on the Batinah fortifications has been very slow due partly to the annual exodus of labourers in the late summer to work at the date harvest and partly to a lack of competent masons. The work is now in hand and some of the projects are nearing completion. Merani Fort at Muscat has been largely restor ed and a 3 -pounder gun has been placed on a permanent mounting on one of the towers com nanding the approaches to the town from the Interior and to the harbour from the sea. Unfortunately owing to circumstances outside the State's control the wireless equipment ordered early in 1940 has not yet been delivered although it is reported to have been shipped. In November it was noticed that abnormally large quantities of kerosene were being exported principally to Aden and Mukalla and in order to conserve local supplies and prevent as far as possible any consignments finding their way to the Italian East Africa it was found necessary to prohibit the export of petrol and kero sene except under special permit from the Director of Customs. ( 6 ) W ar Contributions. —Muscat has not been backward in offering financial assistance to His Majesty’s Government and the various charities specially designed to meet hardship caused by the war. In January £ 10 - 10-0 were subscribed to the Red Cross Fund. In March Rs. 2,419 were remitted to the Viceroy’s Var Purposes Fund for comforts for Indian soldiers in France. In July a local W ar Purposes Fund was formed and by the middle of November £l ,200 had been remitted to the India Office. In November the Resident’s Persian Gulf Fighter Fund was started and to date Rs. 4,595-15-3 have been contributed. All the Indian merchants and other merchants of British nationality voluntarily contribute monthly sums to the Fighter Fund based on the value of their imports and exports. (c) Publicity .—While there has never been any anti-British propaganda in Muscat other than enemy wireless broadcasts it was considered desirableso,-pre pare the ground that any attempt to introduce subversive propaganda would, prove unprofitable and to this end a weekly news letter or paper in Arabic has been issued from the Agency. This paper which goes by the name of “ A1 Haq ” reports the latest accurate British wireless news, contains articles received from the Embassy in Baghdad and the Publicity Officer in Bahrain, and from time to time publishes articles written by local contributors. In addition items of local interest are included with the object of making the paper interesting to all sections of the literate public. The paper is normally of six foolscap pages and has a limited circulation of one hundred and fifty copies. The circulation could be much increased but there are various production difficulties which have first to be overcome. It is issued free of charge and penetrates into the interior of Oman where it is the only medium through which news of the war reaches the people. Important copies of the paper are translated into Gujrati for the benefit of the Hindu merchants. Illustrated papers have been received regularly from the Publicity Officer at Bahrain and also from the Embassy in Baghdad and have been much appreciated their appeal being particularly strong to those members of the population who are unable to read.

This was ostensibly to relieve him of work but in practice all matters of importance were still referred to him (p.p.38-39 &amp; 41). After negotiations with the Shaikh of Abu Bhafoi and the Sultan, Petroleum Concessions Ltd. decided not to carry out survey work in the Ibri-Dh^-Hafit area. 'The impression given by the Company was that they were not sufficiently interested to under lake a lon 0 and tedious survey.' (p.39). The Burma/iCil Company withdrew from the negotiations for Cwadur oil, leaving IndiatiOil Concessions Ltd. to reach an agreement with the Sultan (p.39). Reports were received that slaves were being brought from Persian.Baluchistan and landed near Suwaiq. Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad was said to be concerned in the trade.

General. —On the outbreak of war messages of loyalty were received from all the Shaikhs of the Arab Littoral. The Shaikh of Bahrain gave £.‘&gt;0,000 as a gift to His Majestv’s Government for prosecuting the Avar. Royal Navy. —H. M. S. Challenger surveyed local waters in Bahrain during February I March and prepared charts of the channel between Bahrain and Has Tanurah. Towards the end of the year Sloops of the Royal Indian Navy arrived in the Gulf to relieve Sloops of the Royal Navy which had been detailed for duty elsewhere. Until the outbreak of the war in September, Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division paid frequent visits to the various Shaikhdoms of the Arab Littoral. Aviation .—Imperial Airways, later the British Overseas Airwavs Corpora tion, maintained five services a week in both directions until the outbreak of the war, when services were to a certain extent curtailed. The Royal Air Force made several routine flights. Oil Interests .—Negotiations for an oil concession for Gwadur were continued with the Burmah Oil Company but in August the Company withdrew as Indian Oil Concessions limited had obtained a concession in the neighbouring State of Kalat. So far no arrangements have been reached by the Sultan with Indian Oil Concessions Limited. In Muscat geologists of Petroleum Concessions Limited continued their work till February when, after paying a short visit to Dhofar, thev completed their winter programme and left Muscat. No work was done during the winter of 1939140 and the impression given by the Company was that they were not sufficiently interested to undertake a long and tedious survey. On the Trucial Coast protracted negotiations with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi were brought to a successful conclusion by Petroleum Concessions Limited. In the early part of the year the Company were engaged on aerial reconnaissance and photography over the Trucial Coast hi/terland. The outbreak of war pre vented work being continued during the winter of 1939|40. In Qatar drilling operations were continued at No. 1 well and a depth of 5,685 feet was reached during the year. There was a promising show of oil and later tests were highly satisfactory. In Bahrain the Bahrain Petroleum Companv Limited improved their refinery operating facilities and twelve tanks were added. Negoliations for the unallotted area continued between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and Petroleum Concessions Limited. After a careful^consideration of the offers made by both Companies, the Ruler announced his intention of granting the concession for the whole area to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Gov ernment. Negotiations were still in progress at the end of the year. . , r ^ le total production of oil for the year was 7,588,544 barrels as compare with 8,297,988 barrels produced in 1938. Royalty paid to the Bahrain Government was Rs. 15,49,278-12-8 for the first half of the year and Rs. 16,25,554-1-4 for the second half. At the end of the year the Company’s employees numbered Americans 1938. 90 1939. 67 European British subjects . • » * 224 192 Indian British subjects • • • • 422 374 Bahrainis • » # . * 1,596 1,878 Others l»&lt; 1*1 * 286 399 LC81EAD '/In Kuwait the oil bearing strata was reached in No. 3 well. Soon after the outbreak of war the Kuwait Oil Company decided not to declare commercial production. The Shaikh has protested against this decision but to the end of the year no settlement had been arrived at. Medical. The Agency dispensaries at Kuwait. Bahrain and Muscat con- tin uo to do good work. A Sub-Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Department was posted to the Tracial Coast early in the year and arrived at Dubai m June. A dis pensary has been opened there and attendance figures are vei\ high aveiagmg over a 100 a dav. The Residency Surgeon inspected this dispensai} duiing the year and visited all the Shaikhdoms oi the Trucial ( oast except Kalba. Medical work in Bahrain has increased as the result of the opening of a hospital for men and women by the State. Kuwait.—T\\z second Kuwait Council which was elected towards the end of 1938 never met as the members refused to agree to the power ot veto b\ the Shaikh and was eventually dissolved in March after a disturbance in which the recalcitrant members were encouraged by violent propaganda from Iiaq. One of the ringleaders was arrested, tried and sentenced to death. lie was imme- diatelv executed by shooting in the town square, whereupon the remainder fled to Iraq ; those who did not escape are still languishing in jail in Kuwait. During the early part of the year the Iraqi press published inflammatory articles stressing the alleged desire of Kuwaitis to join Iraq. The King of Iraq also broadcast from Iraq in the same strain. On his death however this campaign of vilification died down. Kuwait relations with Sa’udi Arabia have remained good throughout the year and Bin Saud emphatically denied press reports by declaring that Kuwait was Kuwaiti and belongs to Kuwaitis, The question of the settlement of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s date gardens m Iraq dragged on throughout the year. In March a notice was served demanding the payment of taxes amounting to £19,480 within ten days, failing which the pro- perties were to be attached. Actually however the Fao and Faddaghiya estates were seized before the ten days were up and it was only after strong representa tions by His Majesty’s Government that the majority of the Shaikh’s cultivators were reinstated, There was one case of incursion by Iraqi Police to as far as 4 miles north of Jahra at the head of Kuwait Bay. Bahrain .-.—The Shaikh of Bahrain left for Simla on the 16th July, where he had an interview with His Excellency the Viceroy. He returned to Bahrain in September very much improved in health. The Shaikh’s brother, Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa visited the United States of America where he was shown much courtesy, visiting the New York Exhibi tion as an honoured guest. This was the first time that a member of the Ruling Family had visited the United States. The outstanding feature of the year was the visit of His Majesty King Ibn Saud to Bahrain early in May. His Majesty stopped in Bahrain for four days. As a result of the war the Bahrain Police Force has been augmented by the addition of a machine gun section and a motor bicycle section. The Shaikh’s nephew, Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad completed his training at the Police Training School at Nasik and returned to Bahrain as Superintendent of Police. After considering the rival claims of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar to Hawar, an island lying off the west coast of Qatar, His Majesty’s Government decided in favour of Bahrain. The Shaikh of Qatar appealed against this deci sion but was told that it was final. Trucial Boast .—In March the people of Dubai began to exhibit dissatisfaction with the work of the State Majlis. Taking advantage of the situation the Shaikh of Dubai made a surprise attack on Daira. After holding out for two days Shaikh Maui bin Rashid and his brother Maktum fled to Sharjah where they were joined by a number of their adherents. Muscat and Oman .—The tribes of Oman have been at peace with each other and with the Sultan’s Government and the year has been one of the most peace ful that the State has known for some time. AVith the exception of a short visit to Gwadur in April the Sultan spent the whole year in or near Muscat town.PERSIAN SIDE. The local authorities during 1939, devoted more attention than usual to the problem of affecting a much needed improvement in agricultural conditions. In live of the districts coming within the jurisdiction of the Bushire Governorate village councils have been appointed whose principal functions will be to submit peiiodical reports and suggestions for the betterment of local conditions. r Persian Navy .—No comments. Security .—In spite of continued efforts throughout the year to complete the disarmament of the tribes in Dashti and Tangistan reports of clashes between Road Guards and smugglers, and villagers and military, received towards the end of the year indicate that not only have the authorities much to do before they Imish their work but also that unrest and discontent amongst the tribes ia increasing. Relations between the Residency and the local Iranian officials^ which were most friendly throughout the year tended to become even more friendly after, the outbreak of the war. . C. G.

Wheat Monopoly.—Cultivators were again compelled to seH then’ harvest to the Revenue authorities at a rate considerably less than that at wine v 2 W'/T* it w g resold by the Government. Sufficient stocks to meet local requirements were hJwever retained at Bushire and in addition to these stocks, a certain amount of grain was also smuggled into Bushire by peasants who had managed to evade ^ellino- their full crop. Stocks of smuggled gram were sold at a rate lower than that demanded by the Government and it is believed that a certain amount was surreptitiously exported. Snniqnling of Contraband goods.-A branch of the Iranian Piecegoods Monopoly Company continued to supply British, Russian and Japanese piece- goods^ Bushire and districts at prices lower than those prevailing in e interior. As a result, the smuggling of piecegoods into Bushire was kept m check A fairly flourishing trade in smuggled motor tyres and tubes, raincoat, and Japanese silks is however, still carried on. During the year the Customs Preventive Department seized two dhows and about 100 packages of Japanese silk goods. Tobacco Monopoly.—The Bushire Tobacco Monopoly Bureau continued to meet local requirements in cigarettes, cigars and tobacco at a handsome profit It is estimated that their profits on the sales of tobacco which had been purchased locally amounted to about 750 per cent. Roads and Communications. 1. Bushire-Shiraz Road .—-Work on repairs to the road m TTV ^iv wrx was carried on throughout the year ; in spite of this however the road was again impassable for several days during the month of December. 2 Bushire-Firuzabad Road.—Local authorities expected this road to be onen to traffic in March ; they were however, once again disappointed m their expectations, and by the end of the year the road still remained incomplete. 3. Bushire-Lingah Coast Road.—Towards the end of the year preparations were being made to commence work on the Bushire-Lingah Coastal road. Land Registeation. The Bushire Land Registration Department continued work on the regis tration of property in Bushire and districts. In spite of the opening of a branch office at Bandar Rig, however, little progress was made and by the end of the vear much remained still to be done. Registration fees were levied on the basis of the official valuation of property as assessed by the Land Registration Department.Revenue. Many shopkeepers and artisans who had previously claimed exemption from the payment of income-tax on the grounds of the smallness of their income were this year called on to pay ; in many cases the tax being levied on what the Revenue authorities estimated their incomes should be regardless of the indivi duals’ claims to the contrary. Education. The Education and Waqf Department, the construction of which was first undertaken in 1937, still remains incomplete. Bushire Municipality. The Municipality’s five-year plan for the improvement of public buildings and roads and for the construction of a lazaretto has not yet been approved of by the Ministry of Interior and in consequence none of the works have yet been undertaken. Budget provision was however, again made for an expenditure of Rials 20,000 per mensem out of which the Municipality maintained a sanitary staff of 70 persons and continued to make provision for the upkeep of a small lunatic asylum and the local infirmlary. The Municipality also did much to bring about an improvement in the quality of bread sold locally and to provide for a regular and adequate supply of ice during the summer. SECTION 4. ARMY. Brigadier General ’Amidi, Officer in charge of Ears Division, Shiraz, ins pected the Garrison in March when he announced the amalgamation of the Road- Guards force with the Military Garrison of Bushire. It was also notified that with effect from that date local conscripts would be called on to perform 8 months of their service in the Military barracks at Bushire and 16 months as Road Guards. The Bushire Recruiting Office was again very strict this year, few exemp tion papers were issued. Altogether, 1,820 conscripts were recruited from Bushire and districts out of which about 420 were sent to Shiraz for training and the remainder were admitted to the local barracks at various times throughout the year. Some 450 old conscripts were also recalled during the year and made to undergo a refresher course lasting about one month. Towards the end of the year the authorities seemed to be making some effort to separate the educated conscripts from the uneducated, in the majority of cases the educated being sent to Shiraz for training. Lieutenant-Colonel Karimi remained in command of the Bushire Garrison until 22nd February when he was relieved by Captain Yusuf Noori. DISARMAMENT OF THE TRIBES. The year showed no relaxation in the severity of the measures to which the authorities have had resort in order to expose persons in illegal possession of arms and ammunition. As a result, some 250 rifles and 1,800 rounds of ammu nition together with 32 persons found in possession of arms were brought to Bushire and handed over to the Military authorities. The authorities are not yet satisfied that they have unearthed all hidden supplies of arms and are, if necessary, prepared to resort to even more severe measures in orclr to discover /&lt;- them. NAVY. Lieutenant-Colonel Ghulam Ali Bayandor held charge of the Iranian Navy throughout the year. Navigational lights installed at Bushire and Qais Island have not been regu larly operated throughout the year. SECTION 5. AVIATION. During the year five British planes on private flights called at Bushire. Foreign. The Air France weekly service was maintained regularly throughout the year except for 25 days in November and December when owing to heavy rains,'the landing ground became unserviceable. During this period mail ba^s were either dropped from the air or else carried between Basra and Bushire°by the B. I. S. N. Company’s steamers.—— mM* 4 The K. L. M. continued their direct service between Jask and Basra and 33 of their machines landed at Bushire to refuel or take up passengers. In August the Acting Governor of Bushire invited a number of the leading merchants and traders to subscribe towards the upkeep of the newly formed Civil Aviation Club of Iran. By various means a sum of Rials 50,000 was collected. The authorities, however, did not consider this sum to be sufficient and further efforts were made. Eventually, towards the end of the year, after almost every man, woman and child in Bushire had been asked to contribute, a sum of Rials 140,000 was collected and sent to Tehran. The authorities in Tehran are said to have been much impressed by the munificence of this contri bution and it is now feared they will ask for a similar subscription to be made annually. SECTION 6. POLITICAL SITUATION. Apparently acting under orders from Tehran, the local authorities have this year devoted more attention than usual to the problem of effecting a much needed improvement in agricultural conditions and among other things have allotted a sum of Rials 270,000 for the construction of a dam, to be used for irri gation purposes, across the river Shahpur at a village named Saadabad in the district of Shabankareh, some 35 miles south east of Bushire. Work has already been commenced on the dam and it is hoped that it wall be completed by the beginning of March. The engineers working on the dam are reported to be also considering the possibilities of bringing a regular supply of drinking water to Bushire. Towards the end of the year a party of about 400 villagers from Dashti and Tangistan banded together to resist the demands of the military authorities who, they claimed, under threat of making fictitious reports as to the number of rifles found in the district, were extorting large sums of money from the villagers. The activities of the malcontents have so far been purely local and a few of them have been caught and punished. SECTION 7. MANUMISSION. The undermentioned numbers of slaves were manumitted in 1939 :— Bahrain Agency .......... NH Sarjah Agency .......... 112 Muscat Agency .......... 17 t A. C. STEWART, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. SECTION 8. TRADE AND TRADE FACILITIES. General condition .—There has been little change in the general trade situa tion since last year, and the forwarding business remains the chief type of com mercial activity. Fears that the trade which has been passing through Bushire would be almost entirely diverted to Bandar Shahpur have not yet been fulfilled, partly because storage accommodation and other facilities at Bandar Shahpur are still inadequate, and on the whole Bushire has been somewhat busier than in 1938. Table ‘ A 7 shows the quantity of goods imported and exported during the year. Figures are for the most part received in packages, but for the purpose of comparison (according to the system adopted in previous years) are converted into tons at the rough estimate of ten packages to a ton. It is not possible to give details of the classes of imports and exports, or of their sources and desti nations, as the information cannot be obtained from the Customs authorities - nor is it possible to make any estimate of the goods imported and exported by sailing vessels. J and Compared with the figures for 1938, imports have risen by over 25 per cent exports by over 60 per cent., though both are less than in 1937. Dues realized by the Customs during the year, including road and monopolv taxes may be estimated at about sixty-three million rials ; figures for previous years are not available. y t5 \isual congestion of goods in the Customs appeared to have been some what reduced by the end of the year. Monopoly imports, such as motor lorries, spare parts, and tyres, suffered the least delay, but the clearance of all goods has been assisted since it was ruled, at the end of 1938 or early in 1939, that a special import permit need no longer be obtained ; a document of sanction (mawaliqatnameh) alone is now sufficient. At the end of 1939 importers were granted another concession by the removal of the ban on the purchase of foreign exchange except at the official rates. As, however, the ban itself was never very effective, the value of its removal may also be limited, except that the help of banks may now be invoked in the task of finding sellers of foreign exchange at the market rate. Freight charges by sea have risen by 30 per cent, to 50 per cent, since the war. It is perhaps possible that the increase which this will cause in the cost of Iranian exports may reduce the demand, never very keen, for certain third category goods. Sh/.ppinfj. (a) British. The number of British ships calling at Bnshire has diminished, as shown in Table ‘ A \ from 182 in 1938 to 151 in 1939, chiefly because in March the British India fast mails ceased to visit Bushire. The slow mail service conti nued as usual with two calls weekly throughout the year. In Table ‘ A ’ the number of British India ships is given as 112, but a few of these belonged to the Ellerman and Bucknall lines, and, with 39 Strick ships, were the only British ships which provided a direct service to Europe. Vessels of these lines, as might be expected, have called somewhat less frequently since the war began. British ships, in spite of their decrease in number, have improved their position in the carrying trade this year. They took a greater quantity of exports than last year, and raised their share of the total imports to one half. For the immediate future the prospects of the British India line are especially good. They alone run between India and the Gulf a service which is both frequent and regular, and although in the last four months of the year the volume of their imports to Bushire did not increase, they were able to export to India during this period a certain quantity of goods for transhipment, which in normal circumstances would probably have been carried direct to Europe or America in German ships. (b) Foreign. (i) German .—The war interrupted a period of increasing activity for the Hansa line. In the whole of last year, their imports amounted to 15,103 tons and their exports to 5,095 tons. This year, in the first eight months alone, thirty four Hansa ships visited Bushire, importing 12,664 tons and exporting 8,540 tons ; in fact apart from opium, they monopolised the entire export trade amongst foreign steamers. It remains to be seen whether trade through Bushire will suffer any large decrease owing to the total cessation of German shipping ; some loss must be expected, since goods formerly exported to Germany by sea are, it is said, now being sent by land. Hansa line imports included motor cars brought direct from the the United States of America, loaf sugar from Holland and Egypt, glassware from Belgium, and alluminium, iron and machinery from Germany. The German agent, Herr Plate, left Bushire for Ahwaz in December, and Mirza Khalil Dashty became agent for the Mitsui and Java Pacific linos in his place. (ii) Japanese .—The Mitsui and Yamashita lines continued to call. Twenty-four of their steamers imported 5,114 tons of goods, a very great increase over last year’s total of 1,141 tons. The imports consisted chiefly of piecegoods, glassware, tea and general merchandise. They exported aoout 500 tons of opium and 197 tons of general goods. (iii) Dutch .—Dutch steamers of the Java Pacific line have again begun to make an appearance ; during the year, three vessels imported 1,592 tons of goods, mostly sugar and tea, but their exports were confined to 30 tons of opium. (iv) United States of America .—Three steamers of the Isthmian Steam ship line imported 278 tons of goods, all during the last four months of tho year. One of the chief consignments consisted of 150 Chevrolet trucks : most LOS1EADof them have been uncrated and assembled at the Customs, and a few are plying in Bush ire. (v) Italian .—Five Lloyd Triestiuo steamers brought 3,173 tons of imports. The greater part arrived in November and December, and is said to have included goods brought by German ships as far as Trieste, and transhipped at considerable extra cost to the buyers. (vi) Russian .—Russian steamers have ceased to call, the monopoly for the supply of matches has been transferred from Russia to Japan. Stocks of Russian matches are not exhausted, but Japanese matches, slightly more expensive and of better quality, are on the market. Opium .—The following shipments were made in 1939 :— January . - 300 rases for Saigon, February .. 200 yy 77 Saigon. 300 97 77 Batavia. 1,500 7T 77 Dairen.

Most of this opium went, as usual, to the Far East. All is reported to have been for legitimate consumption, except one shipment of 1,000 cases to the Far Fiast by a Japanese ship in October, about which there was some suspicion. The cases are of standard weight of 160 lbs. valued at approximately £120 per case. The ‘ Ihmadieh Spinning and Weaving Mill —A serious crisis occurred in the mill in May, when the Manager, Mr. ’Itemad, found himself unable to fulfil orders for which, though advance sales to merchants in Shiraz, he had already received payments amounting to Rials 1,200,000. An audit of account was begun, as a result of which it was suspected that the manager had embezzled large sums of money, and the members of the managing committee turned against him. In June, the mill ceased work for lack of material, and next month most of the employees were dismissed. In September, however, w r ork was resumed—it was rumoured that the members of the managing committee had been induced to lend Rials 20,000 each—and the manager w r as soon able to repay a considerable sum. Since then, by the judicious use of influence, he has weathered another storm, and the forecast for the mill seems to be set fair. It is producing to full capacity and has been working day and night shifts. The chief apprehension has been that sufficient supplies of raw cotton might not be available, since it is rumoured that great quantities have been sold toPost war 17-20 10-50 7 Germaiiy. So far, however, there has been no difficulty. The products of the mill are too expensive tor the local market, and are sold chiefly in Shiraz. r our English experts have been in charge of the technical working of the mill throughout the year. The other employees number about 450. inanee.

At the same time the purchase of foreign exchange through ; B L ’ ailC !- i aC °T!m been increasi ug. It may be expected that Bushire’s compai a ^ et&gt; smajj black bourse ’ ’ transactions will diminish still further as a icsult of J, ecembei s law, which was introduced in order to meet the increased demand loi loieign exchange. The price of foreign exchange has risen with the demand, ana by the end oi the year to pound sterling was worth 180 or 200 Kials. 1 he inteiest rates of the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Banque Mellie were the same as last year. Agriculture. The wheat and barley crops were good and sale was less icstiicted than last year. The price of wheat was controlled as usual ; grain ot inferior quality was bought by the Government, which discounts of 15 per cent, of the weight for adulteration, at Rials 140 for 300 kilos, and sold at Rials 200. The poor quality ot this wheat made it necessary for bakers in Bushire to mix with it wheat illicitly bought from private dealers. The price of barley was not controlled ; it is used only for export, and, locally for animals. Dates are produced at Borazjun and neighbourhood in small quantities ; most aie sent inland rather than to Bushire, which generally obtains all its needs from Khorramshahr. The price is uncontrolled, and has been about Rials 6-25 for 12 lbs. Smuggling .—Smuggling is said to have decreased since the outbreak of war, owing to lack of supplies on the Arab Coast. 11 ages and Cost of Living .—As shown by the following Tables there has been a rise both in the average rates of wages and in the cost of living since 1938. At the outbreak of war, prices of articles other than food-stuffs rose by as much as 50 per cent. Certain articles, such as cement and iron, ceased for a time to be obtainable at all. One explanation for the recent increase in the cost of monopoly sugar may be that there is now loss danger of competition from smuggled sugar.

They own, however, only a few vehicles each, and although one of them is reported to be doing good business, the rest are making’ little progress. Transport rates, which are given below in rials per kharvar of 655 lbs., have varied considerably throughout the year, in accordance with the amount of traffic and the prospects cxf freight for the return journey.

Merchants pay annually from 1 per cent, to pay large dividends. The price of piece-goods has been rising throughout the year. The control of this monopoly was transferred in December from the Banque Mellie to the Finance Department. Taxation remains as before. Merchants pay annually from 1 per cent, to 4 per cent, on their net profit, according' to the amount ; employees^ drawing over Rials 200 per mensem pay from 2| per cent, to 3 per cent, on their salary ; a municipal tax of 3 per cent, is charged on the value of goods brought into the town from the interior ; a tax of 8 pier cent, is charged on house rents ; and shopkeepers pay a tax varying from Rials 10 to 20 per mensem. The population of Bushire is estimated to be about 8,000 ; there may have been a small decline during the year. C. R.

Hand wells were dug near the springs at Du Gumbadan and proved a large supply of good water to be available. Various new buildings such as stores, offices and quarters for staff and artizans were completed. Apart from the construction of roads to well sites, repair work was carried out to the Kumbal—Ba Mohammad road, the Ganoweh road to Mile 22 and Ba Mohammad road to Turk Village. At the bridge over the Zurab four culverts were cut through approaches to clear flood water and the bridge between Zurah and Gach Saran was widened. Ba Mohammad industrial area was fenced-in. The swimming bath was re-built and enlarged, tennis courts made at Dasht-i-Mirza and Ab-i-Shirin and a 5-ton ice plant installed in the Stores building. During 1939 Ganoweh was completed as a transhipment area ; the work involved included :— Jetty construction and piling. Internal railway. Butters stiff leg derrick on jetty. Filling and levelling transhipment area. Completion of water wells. Installation of tankage and pumping equipment. Installation of 2 30 KAV. Lighting Sets. Construction of transhipment buildings, casing racks, petrol store, dis pensary and Artizan Quarters. Construction of the Gach-Saran-Abadan pipe line continued.CHAPTER III. L SUMMARY OF EVENTS AND CONDITIONS IN FARS DURING THE YEAR 1939. General Situation. —Life in this district pursued an even tenour in 1939. No disturbances or agitations occurred and no reforms or developments were embarked upon. Even the outbreak of war in Europe produced, in this general inactivity, peculiarly little effect. It is true that the steady rise in the cost of living was given further impetus, the boycott of foreigners and in particular ot this Consulate was intensilied and the remnant of the export trade finally dis located but no fresh evils came into being and anxiety over the future problem of obtaining supplies from abroad was only one of a few clouds on the horizon. Local Administration. —Fars, now designated the 7th LTstan, was deprived of an able and honest administrator by the death in December of Abul Hassan Pirnia. He was appointed Governor General (Ustandar) only in January and in view of the constant going and coming of minor officials it is doubly un fortunate that this province should not have enjoyed for longer his beneficent rule. Up to the end of the year no one had been nominated to succeed him and in the absence of a Governor (Farmandar) the practical direction of affairs fell more than ever into the hands of the military authorities and the General Officer Commanding the Fars division became the virtual Ustandar. Military intervention in civil affairs led to no increase of local initiative, for the army is obsessed even more than the civil administration with dread of the Fhah’s displeasure and action, at any rate of a beneficial kind, was paralysed by the pernicious precaution of always referring to Tehran before taking the jjettiest decision. Communications. —No work was undertaken of any major importance. The Shiraz-Firuzabad road progressed no further than Firuzabad and the Kazerun-Basht-Behbehan road is not yet open to traffic. The military road from Shiraz to Behbehan via Ardakan is closed to civilians after Tul-i-Khosrovi. In the spring the Shiraz-Isfahan road was put in good condition for the benefit of the foreign delegations visiting Iran for the Crown Prince’s wedding but little has been done to it since and the surface, especially between Shiraz and Persepolis, is rapidly deteriorating. Petrol pumps and oil depots were installed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany at convenient intervals throughout the whole length of the road from Bushire to Tehran. Agriculture. —As a result of the plentiful winter rainfall grain crops w 7 ere excellent. Fruit suffered from late frosts in April. Sugar beet in nearly all parts of the district was attacked by caterpillars and only a poor crop was obtained. The cotton crop was good but much distress was caused by the Shah’s prohibition of the cultivation of rice, for the waterlogged lands suitable for rice can rarely be put to an alternative use. Trade. —The export trade in the produce of Fars such as gum tragacanth, redgum insoluble, lambskins, almonds, seeds and licorice roots, struggled feebly in the toils of innumerable governmental restrictions until the war gave it the death blow. Shipments to Germanv in the first half of the year were effected under the clearing agreement and to Italv under private barter arrangements. The suggestion of German importers that gum and licorice should be shipped from Bandar Shah via the U. S. S. R. was rejected by local merchants who foresaw much trouble and little profit and efforts were'later initiated to find an outlet in India. The import trade, apart from a few consignments of barter goods from Italy, had long since succumbed to the difficulties created by the exchange and monopoly regulations and practically all foreign supplies were drawn from Tehran. British trade remained nil and signs of the British drive to increase exports were not apparent up to the end of the year. In spite of all things, however, the returns of the Shiraz branch of the Tmnerial Bank of Tran for the year ended September 20th, 1939 showed that satisfactory profits were being maintained. Industrif. —The cotton mills of Isfahan and Shiraz, the woollen factories of Isfahan and the silk factories of Yezd all continued to work satisfactorily and supplied all local requirements. Difficulties however were anticipated for the future in obtaining the requisite supply of dyes from Germany.17 The sugar factory at Merv Dasht was expended to cope with a production of 100,000 tons and the usual party of Czech technicians arrived for the sugar- boiling season with only a slight delay. The machinery for the grain silos at Isfahan and Shiraz which was to be supplied from the IT. S. S. R. did not arrive although the silo building at Isfahan was finished by Kampsax in 1938 and the one in Shiraz is nearing completion. The Khollar wine factory produced some 250,000 litres of wine from the 1938 crop and succeeded in maintaining the good quality of its products. Military A ffairs and Public Security .—The strength of the Shiraz garrison was brought up to about 8,000 men. Mechanization made no progress. Of the three anti-aircraft guns reported to have arrived in the spring one was seen at the time but none were heard of since. Considerably more attention was given to musketry and the three rifle ranges w T ere in constant use. Rumours of movements of troops to the coast after the outbreak of war were not sub stantiated. The road guards (Amnieh) were incorporated in the army in March but no outward change was apparent in their functions or efficiency. Nevertheless, except for a few hold-ups and robberies in isolated parts, public security was remarkably good. Public Opinion and the War .—The sentiments of informed Persians were overwhelmingly favourable to the Allies. This no doubt is largely due to the fact that if a Persian speaks a foreign language at all it is usually either French or English and only very rarely German. Commercial circles in Shiraz and industrial circles in Isfahan which have come under strong German influence in the last few years, regarded the war as an unmitigated nuisance which was likely to lose them much money. They also considered that after the defeat of Poland it was being needlessly prolonged. Only amongst army officers was their any definite body of pro-German feeling. The Persian broadcasts from Angora, to which, every Iranian wireless owner listens, helped enormously to consolidate public opinion in favour of the Allies, but reception towards the end of the year became very disturbed. Control of Foreigners and Foreign Interests .—The strict control of all foreigners which was expected to follow the outbreak of w r ar did not take place. On the other hand special instructions were received by the Governor General to keep a watch on German activities and at the beginning of November the head of the German community in Shiraz, and the only potential emulator of 'Wassmuss, was arrested for espionage and was still in custody, without trial, at the end of the year. Tribal settlement areas continued to be strictly guarded against the in quisitive eyes of strangers. Indian army language students were given little trouble by the local authorities but appear to have aroused considerable suspicion in Tehran. Towards the end of the year the employees of Kampsax began to encounter difficulty in obtaining permits to travel from the north to the south of Iran unless specially guaranteed to the authorities by the company. In August the C. M. S. schools in Isfahan and Shiraz were ordered to be handed over to the Iranian authorities at a week’s notice but were later given a year’s respite when the difficulty of running them without their English staffs became apparent. The archfeological expedition of the University of Chicago closed its work at Persepolis in November and the Iranian Department of Antiquities took over charge of the excavations. Weather Report .—The maximum temperature was 98°F on July 31st and August 23rd. The minimum temperature was 27°F on February 28th. Total rainfall for the season 1938-39 was 14-50 inches in Shiraz as compared with 16-18 inches in 1937-38 and 10-27 inches in 1936-37. Normal weather conditions prevailed throughout the year. A. H.

The Czechoslovakian Charge d Affaires and Mme Fiat arrived on the 4th .Tune and returned to Tehran on the 7th. The Rt. Revd. W. J. Thompson, Bishop in Iran, visited Kerman in May and from 2nd to 28th July. III.—BRITISH INTERESTS. Trade. —In common with the rest of Iran most foreign imports were made by the Monopoly companies and not by individual merchants. Except for a limited quantity of cotton piecegoods, few British products were available in Kerman. It was noticeable, however, that the market carried an increased quantity of British materials, particularly woollens and tweeds, towards the end of the year. Iranian requirements are in any case limited, but there is scope for increasing British and Indian trade if the difficulties of foreign exchange can be overcome. Bicycles are still in demand and the British-made “ Hercules ” is a popular machine. With improved roads there is a growing demand for motor cycles ; 23 German machines were sold in Kerman during 1939. With German trade at a stand-still there seems to be a good opportunity for British manufacturers to step in and meet this demand. Indian grown tea continues to monopolise the market. Notwithstanding the setback due to the outbreak of hostilities, export of carpets from this district to London was slightly above the figures for the pro ceeding year. Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. —The Kerman agency has been extended to include the district of Bandar Abbas. It is the centre of supply for Yezd, Rafsinjan Sirjan, Bam and Zahidan. With the improvement in motor oils and grease the Company’s products have now ousted all competitors. Church Missionary Society.—(a) Medical.— Dr. R. H. Carpenter was in charge of both the men’s and women’s hospitals until he proceeded on leave in October, when Dr. (Miss) D. M. Howgate assumed charge. The hospital con tinued to render good sendee to the inhabitants of this district. Out-patients attendances numbered 29,000 while 774 in-patients were treated ; 272 major and 2,103 minor operations were performed during the year. (b) Educational.—Both the boy’s and girl’s schools, along with other foreign educational establishments in Iran, received orders to close down in19 July. For various reasons the Iranian Government found it was not able to assume control of. the many institutions when it came to the point and the order is in abeyance for one year. It is probable that it will remain in abeyance until the international situation permits more Iranian funds to be directed into the educational channel. Meanwhile both schools are filled to capacity. In view of the uncertain future, work on the new girl’s school has been suspended. (c) Church .—There has been no interference with any of the services. IV.—FOREIGN INTERESTS. Representation .—There are no other foreign representatives in this area. Trade .—Up to the outbreak of hostilities, Germany continued to be Iran’s principal customer. The main items of export were wool, cotton, goat hair and dried fruits (Germany), carpets and pistachio nuts (America). The principal imports were machinery, hardware and general stores (Germany), cotton piecegoods, matches, glass and porcelain ware (Japan), loaf sugar (Holland and Belgium) granulated sugar (Java). The carpet industry experienced a fluctuating year. Business was im proving at the beginning of the year ; buying eased considerably when the in ternational situation became disturbed ; but by the end of the year business was again on the up-grade. Export figures for the year are slightly lower than for 1938. it p 2 V.—LOG AT. GOVERNMENT. Governor General. —H. E. Ali Suhaili took up his appointment as the fiist Ustandar of the 8th Ustan on the 28th February. His Excellency soon became impressed with the possibilities of this Province and prepared a 3-year development plan. Unfortunatelv his term of office was unexpectedly cut short and he left Kerman on 30th October on appointment as Iranian Ambassador to Afghanistan. Aqai Ardalan, the head of the municipality, officiated as Ustandar until the end of the year. Aqai Ismail Bahadur was removed from his appointment of Farmandar of Bam in May. He was succeeded in July by Aqai Zandniapur, the Farmandar of Bandar Abbas. The relations of this Consulate with the Ustandar and other Iranian officials was very cordial throughout the year. Finance and Revenue .—Aqai Ganjehi, a zealous tax-gatherer, was in charge of this departmental until recalled to Tehran in October. Early in the year instructions were received from Tehran that an addi tional sum of rials 1,000,000 was to be raised by increased taxation in the Kerman district during the Iranian year 1318 (1939-1940). Various means were adopted to achieve this. Income-tax was raised by 10 per cent. ; pet \ shop-keepers were taxed according to profits as assessed by the Finance De partment—in some cases the assessment was in excess of the total profits (a refusal to pay incurred police custody) ; price of opium was raised by 25 dinars per misqal. An additional tax was put on tea and^ sugar but m this case the extra revenue was to be devoted to railway extension. The Department was inspected twice during the year by officials from the Jinistry of Finance. During the year the local branch received instructions not o correspond with foreign firms except in Persian It seems that the Ministry J Finance has acquired some sort of control over the Bank s affairs and a copy if the half-yearly balance sheet is now submitted to the local Finance Depart ment. In November the local branch transferred silver coins to the value of rials 1,500,000 to Tehran. Instructions have been received to open sayings hank accounts hut there has been no rush to take advantage of these facilities.M i ** — 20 Judiciary .—Aqai Ghayasi the chief judge of the Appellate Court was in control of the Judicial Department until transferred to Tabriz in June. The Kerman Appellate Court ceased to function in August. Appeals from the local courts now lie at Isfahan. Tehran officials twice inspected the working of the Kerman courts during the year. No important case involving British subjects came before the courts during 1939. Police .—Major Yusuf Bahrami held the post of Chief of the District Police throughout the year. He is popular with the inhabitants but his relations with some of the officials are not so cordial. Under the present Chief’s guidance the police are usually courteous and obliging towards this Consulate and its staff. Posts and Telegraphs .—The services of this department were satisfactory so far as the Consulate was concerned. There were no cases- of tampering with Consulate mail. Education .—Aqai Mayel Tuwaskani was succeeded by Aqai Kasrawi in August as Director. This is regarded locally as a change for the better. In January the department observed the anniversary of the Iranian unveiling, but there was not much enthusiasm ; the severe weather may have had something to do with it. Children under 16 years of age were prohibited from attending the cinema. No additional schools were opened during the year ; one private school was closed owing to the headmaster faking examination papers. Municipality .—A new Committee was nominated in April. A grant of rials 750,000 was made by the Ministry of Interior for town im provements but financial stringency at the Centre in September reduced the amount to rials 50,000. The proposal to provide a better drinking water supply for the town remains at the discussion stage. Work has begun on a new wide thoroughfare running northwards from the centre of the town. For this a grant of rials 120,000 has been received. All lunatics at large were rounded up and despatched to the asylum at Isfahan. The covered bazar is noticeably cleaner than it used to be. Health. —Dr. Vakili, educated in Germany and married to a German, was in charge of the Health Department. The Department inspects bakers’, barbers’ and coffee shops once a week and prostitutes twice a week I A quantity of anti-opium drug of German manufacture was supplied by Tehran for distribution among addicts but opium consumption remained steady. There were no serious epidemics during the year. Agriculture .—From the beginning of the Iranian year, 22nd March, the local department was done away with and agricultural matters became the direct concern of the Ustandar and his Agricultural Adviser. Agriculture was to play a prominent part in the Ustandar’s 3-year development scheme and to this end he toured in most of the agricultural centres of the Ustan. A grant of rials 600,000 was received for agricultural purposes and from this sum advances were made to cotton cultivators. The Government has sanctioned an extension of poppy cultivation which they curtailed the previous year. Opium consumption in this district, in cluding Sirjan, Bam, Shahdad, Jiruft and Budbar, amounts to about 14,000 maunds per annum (91,000 lbs). About half this amount is monopoly opium and the remainder smuggled stuff. Industry and Developments .—There are no important industrial develop ments to record. It is reported that German engineers examined iron ore deposits in the neighbourhood of Sirjan but the results are not known. Work continued during the summer at the Bahr Asman copper mine but there are as yet no indications that it has met with any special success. A limited quantity of coal is being excavated about 15 miles N. W. of Kerman. A sample tried by this Consulate was very poor.r~ i M I 21 The carpet industry is still an important feature of this district. Compared \vith the previous year, exports to America fell slightly while those to the United Kingdom were slightly higher. 155 unemployed weavers were despatched to work in the Royal Silk Mills in Mazauderan. The Khorshid Spinning Mill suffered from shortage of raw material and managerial troubles. The mill also needs new machinery and replacements. The Electricity Supply Co. imported new machinery from Germany during the year. The proprietor would have preferred British machinery but could not obtain the necessary exchange. VI.—MILITARY. Sartip Ali Akbar Siyah-push retained command of the Kerman Brigade throughout the year. There were no important changes in the composition of the Brigade and the discipline and moral of the troops appears to be good. The garrison of the Rudbar area was increased to a regiment in August. The number of troops at Sirjan was also increased. A permanent detachment has been stationed at Rafsinjan. It was noted that most of the posts along the Kermair—Bandar Abbas road from which the road-guards had been withdrawn were reoccupied towards the end of the year. Internal Security .—Security was not so well maintained during 19.39. There were a number of raids on villages and caravans. In one case two lorrie' travelling by night were held-up on the Sirjan—Bandar Abbas road. A number of raiders were captured and one leader was shot. VII. —COMMUNICATION S. Roads.—A grant of rials 600,000 has been received for the construction of a motor road between Kerman and Jiruft. It is understood that the in tention is to extend this road to Bandar Abbas via Rudbar and Minab. Such a road would be of strategic as well as administrative value. _ Surrounding villages are gradually being linked up with Kerman bv lair-weather motor roads. Wireless. It is reported that the Wireless station was operated dailv tor military purposes for three months of 1939 (23rd May—23rd August) and since then twice weekly for a few hours at a time. There is also a one port able set at Jiruft and two spare portable sets at Kerman for military use. Aviation .—No aeroplane landed at Kerman during 1939. able ^conffdm^^ 18 ^ 0wal( ^ s ma ^ a ^ n ^ n g the landing ground in a service- A sum of rials 70,000 was raised by a forced lew on merchants and £m? 1 ’ 8 . as a , eontributl p n towards national aviation. Compulsory contribu- ons.veie a * s0 demanded from all wage earners and every child attending- school was required to contribute rials 10-15 each. In December the local end aviation committee was instructed to raise a further rials 500,000.

Posts and Telegraphs. —This department rendered satisfactory service to the Consulate throughout the year. Education. —No new schools were opened during the year. Municipality. —The Committee experienced some difficulty in meeting the cost of street lighting. The amount they proposed to pay, rials 130,000 (£1,625) per annum, was referred back by the Ministry of Interior as exces sive. The principal consumer is the municipality and the Supply Company cannot function on a lower grant. On two occasions the current was cut off to enforce payment. Health. —On the whole the health of the Town was good. There were a few cases of small-pox and measles. Agriculture. —There is little scope for agricultural development in the immediate neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas, but the Ministry of Agriculture sent Dr. Erwin Gouba, a German subject to report on the possibilities. Industry and Developments. —Work on the Fish Canning Factory went ahead and by the end of the year 12 Danish subjects were employed. Most of the machinery had arrived and it was hoped that the factory would be com pleted by Ihe early Spring. It is unlikely, however, that any canning will be done, except as a test, before the Autumn of 1940. Four Danes will remain as part of the permanent staff. The factory is to produce tinned fish (chiefly sardines), fish oil and manures. Registration. —A local office for the registration of immoveable property was opened in Bandar Abbas in October. Y.—MILITARY AND MARINE. The Kerman Brigadier inspected the local troops in April. The local garrison moved to the Ginu Hills for the summer as usual. An outbreak of measles among the troops in August caused a number of deaths. Conscription. —527 youths were conscripted during 1939. The majority were posted to Charbar. Internal Security.-—As stated under Kerman, internal security w T as not so well maintained during 1939 as in the previous year. In March there were a number of raids on villages in the Minab district and in one clash with the raiders the military were reported to have lost 6 men. The mullah of Rudan was arrested on a charge of inciting the raiders. A number of robberies were also reported in the district between Bandar Abbas and Lar. But this area has never been really settled. Iranian Navy. —All units visited this port at intervals during the year. VI.—COMMUNICATIONS. Roads . No new roads from Bandar Abbas to the interior were opened or commenced during the year. In March the Kerman road between Gakum and Aliabad was breached in several places ; traffic was held up for 7 days. The Bandar Abbas—Lar road which is rough going at the best of times, also suffered from the March rains. _ t ireless .—The former British wireless station at Henjam which was handed over to the Iranian Government in December 1935, was dismantled and the apparatus brought to Bandar Abbas for despatch to Tehran. Aiiafion. The landing ground at Bandar Abbas is not maintained in a serviceable condition. The ground has become bumpy but could probablv be used m an emergency. No ’planes landed at Bandar Abbas during the vpnr &amp; The Farmandar collected rials 50,000 from local inhabitants tions towards the national aviation fund. as contribu-? 24 Shipping .—The B. I. S. N. Co/s subsidiary mail service steamers called at this port weekly throughout the year. In addition shipping with an aggre gate of 221,477 tons (gross) entered and cleared the port as follows :— British German Japanese Dutch Tons. 110,977 48,741 46,147 14,112 Danish 1,500 [ 221,477 The last German steamer to call at this port sailed on the 5th August, VII.—LOCAL POLITICS, European War .—The inhabitants of this district are a very poor class on the whole and have no interest in political matters. The officials and a small merchant class, however, show some interest in the progress of the Etiropean conflict. There are now three or four radio receiving sets in Bandar Abbas and the latest news is obtained from the news bulletins in Persian issuing' from Ankara and Germany. The compulsory absence of the Hansa Line steamers has affected the trade and customs receijjts of the port. Otherwise the outbreak of hostilities' has had no marked effect here. G. A. FALCONER, Major, Kerman, II. M/s Consul for Kerman and Bandar Abbas, 8th February 1940. i25 CHAPTER V. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1.939. L—THE POLITICAL AGENCY. Personnel—(a) G. de Gamy, Esquire, M.C., held charge of the Agency till 15th May when he was relieved by Major A. C. Galloway of the Indian Political Service. (b) Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.B.E., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (London), I.M.D., was in charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of the Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year.. IL—THE RULING FAMILY. (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., was Ruler of Kuwait. Most of the chief administrative posts in the State are held by members of the Subah family. His Highness the Shaikh left for Riyadh on the 29th November on a visit to King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud. He returned on the 23rd December, and was given an enthusiastic reception. (b) Shaikh Abdulla Salim as Subah, C.I.E., cousin to the Ruler, left for the Lebanon on the 12th July for medical treatment. He returned on the 14th August. (c) His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad’s mother died in the autumn. III.—THE POLITICAL AGENT’S RELATIONS WITH THE SHAIKH. The relations between the Political Agent and the Ruler have been of a most cordial nature. IV.—LOCAL INTERESTS. (a) Political .—Reference (c) of IV of the Report for 1938. The second Kuwait Council which never met owing to the refusal of the members to agree to a power of veto for the Shaikh was dissolved by the Shaikh on March 7th after he had regained possession of the Arsenal. Some of the members being reluctant to abandon the semblance of authority they had acquired, and much encouraged by the violent broadcasting and press propa ganda from Iraq directed against the old established order in Kuwait endea voured to delay the handing over of certain papers and accounts of the Council to the Shaikh. While affairs were still unsettled a Kuwaiti water carrier resi dent in Iraq named Muhammad al Munais arrived, and harangued a crowd and distributed leaflets declaring the ruling family deposed. The next morning when Muhammad al Munais was being taken to prison under arrest a hoL headed err-member of the Council, Yusuf Marzook, and another follower of the Council party, Muhammad al Qitami, endeavoured to secure his release. There was a scuffle and Muhammad al Qitami fired on the police, and Yusuf drew and aimed his revolver. The police returned the fire and mortally wounded Muham mad. Yusuf was wounded in the foot and nearby shopkeeper in the posterior. The guard and other tribal followers of the Shaikh then immediately set up a hullabaloo and ’threatened the crowd. Further bloodshed was only prevented by the Shaikh with great difficulty and he was actually hit on the head by the rifle butt of one of his own men while restraining them. He only secured order, however, by promising the immediate trial of Muhammad Munais. A trial was staged and Munais was convicted, sentenced to death, and imme diately executed by shooting in the Town Main Square. This prompt action was responsible for the speedy return to normal. Several of the agitators fled to Iraq, but those who did not escape are still in prison in Kuwait. (b) Customs .—A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confidential publication. There is no change in customs duty which is still 5 per cent., except for British subjects for whom it is 4 per cent. (c) Council .—There is an advisory council of 13 members under the pre sidency of Shaikh Abdulla Salim as Subah. Nine of the members are notables nominated by the Shaikh, and four are nominated members of the Subah family. UC81EADfz VA* 1 f ^ 26 T'he Shaikh himself frequently attends Council meetings over the decision of which he has a power of veto. e,i ] l ew building for the Council and the Law Courts was opened by the ohaikh in June. (d) Medical. —During the year under report the Government of Kuwait have employed a Syrian doctor named Omar Salaami Melieddwi for the State Hospital which it is hoped to open shortly. (e) Financial. —Pressure of local public opinion induced the Shaikh to agree to the income of the Landing Department, which amounts to about Ks. 3b,()00 annually, being set apart for education and the building of a State Hospital. (f) Education. —Education is free in the four Boys’ schools, and in the one Government Girls’ school. The number of trained masters from Palestine was increased during the year, and two more Palestinian school mistresses were em ployed. Negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company for a grant of two scholarships lor Kuwait bo 3 r s to the Technical School at Bahrain were not concluded bv the end of the year. In June Mr. Adrian Vallance of the Iraq Ministry of Education inspected! the schools in Kuwait and submitted a report. (g) Military .—In April Quartermaster Sergeant Booth of the Iraq Levies held a three weeks course in weapon training for the Shaikh’s forces. (h) Building. —Work on a landing pier at the Customs House was begun. It is proposed to build a prison with accommodation for 1st, 2nd and 3rd divisions. D) Imperial Airways.—Imperial Airways land plane service is now sche duled to call at Kuwait bi-weekly, both eastbound and westbound. and Tele 9 ra Ph Office .—Negotiations for the taking over of the ti° S V\ m Tel ^raph Office,^ which is at present run by the Iraq authorities, by the (.able and Wireless Limited are in progress. (k) Commercial.—(i) Boat building .—The famous boat building industry continues to nourish. (ii) market. (in) Lamb shins.—Buying agents of various firms arrived during the Lreahof wa 0 ^ 86 amb SkmS ’ ^ price ° f wllich rose considerably after the out- wU a Ilnring the year under report the Bedouin Kuwait was definitely on the increase, hut it decreased towards the end OI the year owing to export restrictions imposed by the Kuwait Government. nTfi contract.—On the termination in May of the contract held bv pus.it nl Ghamm for the exportation of sand and shingle from Kuwait the K iwai State invited tenders for a new contract. Eventuallv a monopolv was p, 0 ' 1 C ° m P a !g composed of some 20 Kuwait merchants. Negotiations 1 v ’ &lt; ‘ on ' al Ghamm, the new Company and the Angio-Iranian Oil Com pany were in progress at the end of the year. V.—CONDITIONS' OF THE COUNTRY. Security in the hinterland continued to be good during the year, i . ^ October a bedouin was found guilty of murdering another bedouin and executed Were travellmg t0 SllbaiMya - He wa * sentenced to death and VI.—FOREIGN RELATIONS. , 7n yV~ Tn the Ruler reported incursions bv the Iraqi police to as far as 4 miles north of Jahra at the head of Kuwait Bay. 4 P * in the same month it was reported that ail road traffic from Irap to Kuwait hud been stopped by the Iraqi authorities. It subsequently transnteed tW th! incoming mails had been turned hack from the frontier by the PoUceSuperiu! Pearls. The catch of pearls during the year was good, as was the h«co {.onclite iLtahout27 twirl out at Safwan, and that while cars were allowed to enter Iraq none were n lowed to enter Kuwait This state of affairs continued for two days when tlie re f scmd 1 ( ; d t le order J bllt stipulated that exit visas would be required Wlore a traveller could leave Iraq for Kuwait. The official reason given to the 1 ritish Consul at Basra was that the Iraqi authorities only wished to stop those passengers suspected of spreading propaganda against the Shaikh of Kuwait : fins at a time when the Iraqi press was full of anti-Kuwait propaganda. In March the Kaimakam of Abul Khasib served a demand note for £19 480 on the heirs ol Shaikh Mubarak, on account of past unpaid taxes. The demand ■statcG that if the amount were not paid within 10 davs their property would be attached. But before the 10 days were up the Fao and Faddaghiya estates were both seized by the Mudir of Fao. However, after strong representations by His Majesty s Government, the majority of the Shaikh’s cultivators were even tually reinstated. for 1938 6 &lt;J ar dens in Iraq. —Reference (c) of II of the report On the 6th February a decision was .given against the Shaikh by the Bagdad PP ea l C°ort, to whom an appeal had been made against the decision of the Basra court winch had declared the Shaikh’s title invalid. The appeal was dis allowed on a grammatical quibble, it being stated that the correct form of rli^ verb had not been used in the surety bond prepared by Mr. Partu, the Shaikh’s law &gt; or. His Highness had paid the maximum Iraqi appeal tax of £300 at the inception ol the appeal. In June judgment w r as passed transferring the case to Land Settlement. During the earlier part of the year the Iraqi press published inflammatory propaganda articles stressing the alleged desire of the people of Kuwait to join Kuwait to Iraq the object being to incite the Iraqis to try Hitler’s Sudeten methods on Kuwait. The King of Iraq also broadcast in the same strain from Bagdad. On the death of the King the campaign died down. (b) Saudi Arabia. —Kuwait-Saudi relations remained excellent throughout the year. In March, the London and the Palestine Arabic broadcasts mentioned an official Saudi communique to the Egyptian press, in wdiich King Ibn Sand em phatically denied a newspaper report that he was agreeable to the inclusion of Kinvait to Iraq. “ Kmvait is Kuwaiti and belongs to the Kuwaitis ” the com munique said w T as his attitude. i % VII.—OIL. In ,luly the oil bearing strata w r as reached in Burgan well No. 3. The new office building at the west end of Kuwait v 7 as occupied at the latter part of the year. The staff quarters at Magwa w^ere also completed but had not been allotted at the close of the year. Soon after the outbreak of war the Kuwait Oil Company decided not to Cc,- • m declare commercial production, owing to war conditions prevailing, but to pay . R &gt; • the Shaikh the royalty due, i.e., 24 lakhs per annum instead. The Shaikh pro- t .. . **. ^ u tested against the decision and demanded 4 lakhs as compensation. The case had not been settled by the end of the year. p* 71* Sums -/oAks tfc oAfi- Tue usual visits by His Majesty’s sloops of the Persian Gulf Division w r ere . made before the outbreak; of war. VIII.—ROYAL NAVY. IX.—ROYAL AIR FORCE. During the year aircraft of the Royal Air Force used the Kuwait landing ground in the course of their routine duties. Sections of armoured cars from Shaibah visited Kuwait four times during the year on a normal training visits. In September the Royal Air Force installed a pack wireless set at the Agency so that Kuwait in an emergency should no longer be dependent on Ihe single land line belonging to Iraq and on which breakdowns are a frequent occur- Z'cnce.30 Hi Strength on Naturs 1 st January 31st December Manama Muharraq 1939, 1939. 81 70 54 54 135 124 It was decided last year that the Police force should be raised to 350 men ; this strength has now almost been attained. A machine sun section and a motor bicycle section were under training in the latter part of the year, and since the beginning of the war the Police have been occupied with certain additional duties. These have unfortunately disclosed certain deficiencies in organisation and discipline which remain to be eliminated. Shaikh Klialifah bin Muhammad completed bis training in India during the year and took over his duties as Superintendent of Police. Steps are being taken to improve the quality of the naturs. The men are subjected to a strict medical examination before enlistment and are put through a course on the ritie range. 5. Local Affairs .—Bahrain was prepared for the war, and the outbreak of war saw various schemes, which cannot be detailed here, put into operation at once. There was widespread satisfaction at the generous gift of £30,000 made by His Highness the Shaikh to His Majesty’s Government as a contribution to wards war expenses. 6. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited. —(i) Mr. J. S. Black was the Company’s Chief Local Representative for most of the year. He was called up in September last as a Naval Reserve Officer for duty at Basra, but was later released. During his absence Mr. M. H. Lipp acted for him. (ii) Mr. M. H. Lipp became Resident Manager during the year, (iii) The total number of producing wells at the end of the year was 6(&gt; y three of these being in the “ fourth pay 11 horizon. Total production for the year 1939 was 7,588,544 barrels of crude oil. Royalty paid to the Bahrain Government for the first half of 1939 was Rs. 15,49,278-12-8 and for the second half was Rs. 16,25,554-1-4. (iv) At the end of the year the Company’s employees numbered follows :— British Americans .. British Indians Bahrainis Others T 7Ju5 . Tfvt SveWia (uriUck fa wW' (v) Refinery operating facilities were improved during the year by the 1 1 addition of the following major units :— Polymerization plant. uWfiA &lt;3.00, New Oxygen plant. 0 Gas Oil Stripper. Reformed Gasoline Lead Sulphide Plant. Inhibitor Plant. Altogether 12 tanks were added at the Refinery. The following refined products are exported :— Ethylized Gasoline. Straight Gasoline. Kerosene. Diesel Oil. Fuel Oil.31 (vi) laving and recreational facilities were considerably improved during tbe yean (vii) During the early part of the year negotiations for the Unallotted Area continued between the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany Limited and Petroleum Concessions, Limited. After a careful considera tion of the offers made by both Companies, His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, announced his intention of granting a concession for the whole area, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, to the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany. 7. Agriculture ;—The long overdue report from the agricultural expert lent to the Bahrain Government by the Government of India was received in August, and proved to be almost entirely valueless. Captain A. C. Byard, the Assistant to the Adviser, was put in charge of the experimental garden at Budeya where green vegetable crops, potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar cane and lucerne are being grown with some success. Date disease was prevalent in gardens on the south-east ooast. 8. Customs .—The customs revenue amounted to Rs. 10,56,532 during the year as compared with Rs. 11,58,547 during 1938. The fall in total receipts was due solely to the drop in transit duty on shipments to the mainland, which amounted to Rs. 1,03,650 as compared with Rs. 2,19,942 in the previous year. This results from the opening of a port at Ras Tanura and the consequent direct shipment of machinery to the California Arabian Standard Oil Com pany. 9. Municipalities. — Manama .—Useful public works were carried out by the Municipality including the construction of drains, the partial filling in of swamp on the South of Manama, the building of a new road^and some metalling. The Municipality contributed also to anti-malarial measures by oiling and draining stagnant water and irrigation ditches and drains in gardens. Muharraq .—The sea road from Muharraq pier to Busaitin was completed and a double line of shops was built on ground reclaimed near the pier. 10. Public Works .—The extension of the Manama Customs pier to reach deep water and a new Passport Office were completed, while both ends of the Manama-Muharraq causeway were extended preparatory to the installation of a swing bridge. The State Dispensary was completed, a new Rifle Range cons tructed and new garages for the Transport Department were erected. Among important works in progress at the close of the year were hospitals for both men and women (the latter approaching completion), the extension of the Technical School and the erection of a Tower and a wall in the Fort. The contractors for the swing-bridge to complete the Manama-Muharraq causeway were also making good progress in spite of difficulties in obtaining materials as the result of tbe outbreak of war. 11. dectric Department .—A new H. T. transformer station was erected and equipped at Nu’aim, Manama, during 1939 to deal with the increased load in that area. 22 air conditioning units were in service during the summer season of 1939—and more have been ordered to meet the demand in 1940. The revenue of this Department amounted (in round figures) to Rs. 1,19,000 as compared with Rs. 1,03,000 during 1938. Public demand having exceeded the potential supply of the Municipal ice plant permission was given to a local merchant, Hussain Yateem, to install an ice plant for the manufacture and sale of ice. In spite of improvements made the electric supply is still far from satis factory and rates for lighting are much too high. 12. Education.—The following schools were in existence at the end of 1939 to'ntt. *V Boys 1 Schools. Teachers. Students. Manama 11 398 Muharraq Hedd .. Suk al Khamis Budeya ..

School was opened at Iledd, the third largest The Technical School was enlarged in order to admit more pupils and further expansion is under consideration. To the great satisfaction of the public, the Syrian Inspector of Schools was dismissed in March after 10 years’ service in Bahrain. Mr. C. K. L. Adrian-Vallance, then of the Iraq Education Department, visited Bahrain from the 12th to the 22nd June 1939, for the purpose of report ing on the Bahrain Educational organisation and of advising on its future growth. Later, in November 1939, Mr. Vallance was appointed Director of Educa tion in Bahrain. 13. Pearling Industry .—The catch wa» very good in quality but not large. Tisqam (advances paid to divers and pullers) was the same as last year, namely, Rs. 20 for a diver and Rs. 15 for a puller. The number of pearling boats during the year was 219 compared with 252 in 1938. A slight improvement in the Indian market followed the outbreak of war. One local (Arab) firm bought up pearls said to be worth Rs. lakhs and is now trying to sell them in Hyderabad. 14. Trade — 1938. 1939. Rs. Rs.

Throughout this visit communication with the shore was extremely difficult owing to a strong shamal.I 5A^» IS. 34 women of Bahrain and treated many thousands of cases during the year. On the departure of Dr. Jones, she took over control of the entire Medical Depart ment landing the arrival of the new State Medical Officer. Outpatients in all Government dispensaries Inpatients in all Government dispensaries Number of operations Number of deliveries 59,638 3,326 1,079 121 The new Government Main Dispensary was opened in June. (iv) Apart from eye diseases, malaria and venereal disease continue to be the main sources of sickness. (v) In last year’s report mention was made of the visit of Major M. K. Afridi, I.M.S., and of his report on anti-malarial measures. After several months of inactivity on the part of the State Medical Department the initiative was supplied from the Agency and by the summer a beginning had been made on the real drive for the elimination of malaria from these Islands. A general committee was formed on which, apart from officials, prominent citizens were invited to serve ; and executive, financial and propaganda sub-committees were formed. A supervisor and two insect-collectors were recruited with the aid of the Government of India and the volume of work accomplished at the end of the year was impressive. The extent of the work to be done may be judged by the fact that it involves the provision of a piped water supply for the whole of Manama and the closing of several thousand shallow wells in private com pounds, apart from extensive operations in gardens within the Manama Municipality and on its periphery. There is a vast deal of prejudice and inertia to overcome and it must be recollected that the task affects the whole population in their homes and gardens ; but there are at least signs that th« people are beginning to realise that malaria is a preventable disease if all sections of the community co-operate. The work resolves itself into five main parts, the cleaning of all drains, pools and pits, the distribution of oil and paris green, the distribution of larvicidal fish, the inspection by insect-collectors of gardens, compounds and houses and the collection of adult mosquitoes, ajid the provision of a piped water supply in Manama. So far the work has been confined mainly to Manama town and its environs, but will be extended later to other parts of the Islands. (vi) A special feature of this year was the attention paid to the health of the school children. !21. Judicial .—The total number of civil suits in the Agencv Courts was Wil as compared with 1101 in 1938. The total number of criminal cases was J31) as compared with 207 in the previous year. 22. Activities of Germans.—{{) Herr Heinrich Reisinger of the Import ing and Exporting Firm of Johann Schlinz of Bremen, importers of mother- of-pearl, arrived here on business on the 19th January and left on the 26th .

S. “ Shoreham ” on the 31st May 1^39 and formal calls were ex changed with His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. 24. Visil of Arab Notables .—The outstanding feature of the year was the visit of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Saud to Bahrain early in May 1939. On the 1st May the Amir Saud arrived from A1 Khobar by launch and on the same day the Amir Feisal arrived from Cairo by air, accompanied by Shaikh Hafiz Wahba and Shaikh Jamal Hu&amp;seini who had been summoned by Ibn Sand for a discussion on Palestine. On the following morning the Amirs crossed to Al Khobar in company with the brothers of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and his eldest son Shaikh Salman, in order to escort the King to Bahrain. The King arrived in the late afternoon of the 2nd May with a huge party of relatives, Ministers, Amirs, political detenus and retainers, and was met on the Customs Pier by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, the Poli tical Agent, the Adviser and the Assistant Political ^ Agent. After a guard of honour provided by the Bahrain Police had been inspected the King, His Highness and the Political Agent entered an open car to drive to the Palace in Manama where the remainder of the Al Khalifah family had assembled to greet him. After a brief stay in Manama the King and His Highness left for Rafa, where a palace was placed at the King’s disposal. A garden party was given at the Agency the next evening to which the King, the Amirs and several other sons and members of the entourage, together with the Shaikh of Bahrain, his brothers and sons were invited. The Political Agent paid a formal call at Rafa on the King the next morn ing ; and the same afternoon an entertainment was given by the Manama and Muharraq Municipalities in the Manama Municipal Garden. The proceed ings were brief and confined to short speeches of welcome on behalf of His Highness and the Presidents of the two Municipalities and a reply read on behalf of the King by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. On Friday the King joined in the prayers at the Mosque in Manama. In the afternoon he visited the Oil Field and Refinery. A torchlight tattoo was staged by the Bahrain Police, naturs and a num ber of school children on the night of the 6th after dinner. The King and his entourage left Bahrain on the morning of the 7th May after a most successful visit. (ii) Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, and Shaikh Mana bin Rashid and Shaikh Rasliird bin Batti, arrived in Bahrain in May to discuss the Dubai situation with the Political Agent (see Trucial Coast section). 25. Slavery .—129 slaves were manumitted during the year as compared with 142 during the year 1938. 26. Climate .—The summer of 1939 was mild compared with the previous year ; but up to the end of the year there had been no cold weather. There was practically no rain. 27. Qatar. —(i) Relations are, as usual, strained between Bahrain and Qatar. Travel between Qatar and Bahrain is still restricted and Qatar visitors are only allowed to land by the Bahrain Government in emergent cases when medical attention is required. (ii) During the year, after due deliberation of the evidence submitted by both Bahrain and Qatar, the ownership of Hawar was decided by His Majesty’s Government in favour of Bahrain, and both Rulers were informed of this decision. The Ruler of Qatar appealed for a reconsideration of this decision but was told that His Majesty’s Government’s decision was final. (iii) After long and tiresome negotiations during the preceding year the Shaikh of Qatar had agreed to the necessary transfer to His Majesty’s Gov ernment of jurisdiction over British subjects and non-Moslem foreigners in Qatar to enable an Order-in-Council for Qatar to be made on the general lines of the Kuwait Order-in-Council. The Order was published in the Gazette of India of the 7th January 1939 and was brought into force on the 9th February 1939. Inter drafting errors were detected and a final Order-in-Council came into force on the 29th April 1939.(w)- Activities of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited; —(a) Dril ling* operations were continued at No. 1 well Dukhan and a depth of 5,685 feet • was reached during the year. There was a promising show of oil and. later .tests were highly satisfactory. (b) No further attempt was made during the year to obtain a supply of fresh well water in the Qatar Peninsula since geological tests ruled out the possibility of substantial supplies being available, at least in the vicinity of the Oil Camp. (c) During the year the question of establishing an. aerodrome for air craft of the Company near their camp in Jebel Dukhan was under considera tion ; the Air Liaison Officer visited the place in May and submitted a report on the suitability of a landing place. No decision was made till the end of the year. 28.

Shaikhs Sa’id and Suhail iVu\\l&lt;i.d Bati also Hod to Sharjah, whoro tho party woro joined h^y a number of their adherents who had been out in the desert. The question then arose what was to happen to the refugees whose presence in Sharjah, so close to Dubai, °- a ve promise of continued disturbance. On the 2nd April the Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Dubai and had an interview^ with Shaikh Sa ’id of Dubai on board H. M. S. “ Deptford ”. The Shaikh of Dubai promised that he would restore the property of the refugees and grant allowances to those 0 10 .iT\ re 111 need P rovi d e d they went to live in some more distant Shaikhdom. All the Trucial Coast Shaikhs refused to accept the Mana party lest they be involved in future trouble with Dubai, but pressure was brought to bear on the Shaikh of Sharjah to expel the more prominent members ot the 'party from his State and after long dragged out negotiations Shaikh Mana and the Aulad Bati became the rafiqs of the A1 Bu Shami Shaikh Moham mad bin Hamad, of Hamasa. The Shaikh of Dubai handed over their movable properties, but refused to hand back the property of certain of Shaikh Mana’s adherents who remained in Sharjah. On the 14th October the brother and son of the Shaikh of Dubai put out the u*P erSOnS wlj0 Y ere a 9 cuse d Of complicity in a plot to secure the return 01 Shaikh Alana to Dubai. This action caused a strong revulsion of feeling in Dubai against the Shaikh, and in order to take full advantage of the situation Shaikh Mana and his adherents returned from Hamasa to Shariah territory where they began to collect a force in order to make an attack on Dubai. Up to le end of the year no attack had been made but there was considerable uneasi ness and unrest in Dubai town. qi, ( / n the 1 1 lth Januar y 1939, protracted negotiations with tin Shaikh of Abu Dhabi were brought to a successful conclusion bv Petroleun concessions Limited who obtained from him a concession for a period of 71 years.

Medical. —(a) General .—There was an epidemic of Typhoid Fever on the Balinali Coast during the hot season. Measles, Chicken-Pox and Whooping- cough have been prevalent during the year in Muscat and Matrah. Without a public health system it is not possible to isolate and control infectious diseases. (b) Agency Hospital .—As an experiment it was decided to make all treat ment in the “ Out Patient ” department free and to appeal to the public at the close ot the year to meet the additional cost of drugs. An appeal was made by the Political Agent in November and was generously responded to, Rs 2(120 being subscribed. Owing to the American Mission Hospital at Matrah being closed for six months the work at the Agency Hospital increased. The Hospital has been thoroughly overhauled. Re-inforced concrete floors have been laid in all the upstairs wards. The veranda along the north side has been provided with a root and sun shades have been placed over the window® m the west end of the building. The inside of the building has been repainted and the stone work outside re-pointed. Attendances and admittances during the year were as follows : “ Out Patient” department .. .. .. .. 21,359 pereons. Admitted into the Hospital .. nr . . fa.. .. .. .. persons.

His negotiations with the Sheddi of Abu Dhabi had not proved as satisfactory as both he and his Company . ' Somewhat late m the day Petroleum Concessions, Limited, decided to approach the Sultan of Muscat for entry to the area which undoubtedly •eceh? e ? ,T a ' ld lf not t0 the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Mr. Lermitte was well Patm f n C • ‘t S i’ ta ' ^ aS P re P ared to alI °w the survey party to enter the ‘ a i ,’ tla nrah Barauni and Mahadhah areas provided that motor cars were i t used and that the party made their entrance into the area in question from of' \bi ‘ni,',hi r 1 :r a ^; rect,0 , n a '? yf throu « h the territory of the Sheikh ol Abu luiabi. Ihe Sultan also stated that he would arrange for reliable people to accompany the party. He placed no restrictions on the time that the party remained m any particular place. However, Petroleum Conces- ZT ?? 7 er ?- n °* favourab] y impressed and took the opportunitv to ouVsu\wpv U ta V+? b ' ieCt - 0 f t0 Z USe ° f motor cars a reason for not carrving out sun ey work thm winter.

Rs. 32,99,015 33,31,93940 It will be seen that the imports and exports during' the year 1938-30 havo been increased by Rs. 7,09,068 and Rs. 32,924 respectively* The principal articles of import were rice and piece-goods and those of export were dry and w r et dates and dried fish. Japan remained the chief sup plier of piece-goods, matches and cement and India supplied practically the* whole of the cereals. 7. A. Royal Navy —of His Majesty’s Ships and Royal Air Force aircraft to Muscat are given in Appendix A to this report. B. Royal Air Force.—The Royal Air Force maintained their wireless station, at Muscat' throughout the year. ‘ The staff consists of one non-commissioned- officer and three operators from No. 203 (Flying Boat) Squadron at Basra. The station is in direct wireless communication with Shaibah and Habbaniyah in Iraq. 8. Amotion General .—Permission to land at Gwadur was accorded by Ilis Highness the Sultan to machines of the Dutch K. L. M. and Air France Com panies. No aircraft of the two companies alighted at that place during the year. The aerodrome at Gwadur is no longer maintained and supplies of fuel are not now available there. 9. Foreign Interests .—The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. 10. Missionary Work—The Missionary work of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) has been carried on by the Rev. and Mrs. Dykstra. They left for their usual hot weather visit to South India in June and returned in September. Dr. P. W. Harrison, who first came to Muscat in 1913, remained in charge of the Medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah from 1st January to 19th April 1939, when he left Muscat for good. Dr. W. W. Thoms whose family have for long been associated with the Mission at Muscat arrived on the 6th of November and remained in charge of the Mission Hospital to the end of the year. The Mission have continued to make weekly visits to Birkah where they have, with the Sultan’s permission, constructed quarters and Dr. Thoms has started a weekly surgery there on Thursday. 11. Slave Trade .—During the year 53 slaves applied for manumission cer tificates and 37 slaves were manumitted. Of the 53 applicants 36 were cap tured slaves (of whom 28 were manumitted) and the remainder were domestic slaves. Reports were received in May that slaves were being brought from Iranian Baluchistan and landed on the coast near Suwaiq. They were then said to be taken into the interior to Baraimi and sold to buyers from Saudi Arabia. The persons actively engaged in this work were said to be Iranian Baluchis, and the area chosen to land the slaves that inhabited by the Ya’al Sa’ad tribe. There is little doubt that some slaves w r ere brought over and that they were taken inland. Hilal bin Hamad, the principal sheikh of that section of the Ya’al Sa’ad in the neighbourhood of Suwaiq, was undoubtedly involved with the Baluchi traders but to what extent is so far not clear. Representations were made to the Sultan and measures were taken to put an end to the trade. These mea sures have proved satisfactory and no further slave trading is taking place. During the last six months of the year no complaints were received nor were written or personal representations made to the Political Agent on his frequent tours through the Suwaiq area. 12. Weather .—The total rainfall during the year was 4-90 inches. The lack of rain is already being seriously felt and the local drinking water supply has become unpleasantly salt. The summer was mild without “ gharbis ” (hot Westerly winds) of the usual intensity and duration. The occurrence of a “ gharbi ” in October was unexpected and unwelcome as it did considerable damage to the early vegetable crop.4i Part II. 1. Rtilinff Family—(n) His Highness Saiykl Said bin Tammr —Witt, n,» exception of a short visit to Gwadur in April the Sultan has spent the whole year m or near Muscat town.

I of ^hil report^ Commerce ~ This subject has already been dealt with in Part LC81EAD42 3. Municipality .Municipality has functioned during* the year with some success. Although no major works have been undertaken some effort has been made to clean up the town and repair some ot the roads. A timely fire at Muscat destroyed the vegetable market and coffee shops outside the “ Kab al Saghir ”. The Municipality have approved and are carrying out a scheme to provide cement concrete shops some distance from the gate. \\ ork has already commenced and some dozen shops have been completed. The old temporary shelters that sprang up after the fire will be abolished and it is hoped to maintain a reasonably high level of sanitation in the area. The Municipal President, Saiyid Hilal bin Badr, is a pleasant and w T ell meaning man but lacks sufficient drive to really make much impression on the condition of the town. Tlie leading merchants are completely lacking in public spirit and the Municipal Committee seem to have neither the desire nor the courage to introduce neces sary sanitary and public health reforms. The merchants and the public seem to prefer the present insanitary and disgraceful conditions to giving material and moral support to the Municipality in their endeavours to improve the living conditions of the people. 4. General Communications. —Mr. Gf. Gilby remained in charge of the local office of the Cable and Wireless, Limited, from 1st January to 8th February 1939, Mr. F. Lobo from 9th February to 6th September 1939, and Mr. J. A. Faithful from 7th September to the end of the year. From 1st January to 18th April 1939 and from 1st August to 31st December 1939 telegraphic communication with the outside world was interrupted owing to the breakdown of the Company’s cables. Cable and Wireless, Limited, arranged with the Royal Air Force Authorities to send and receive all classes of traffic through the Air Force Wireless Station at Muscat. This arrangement continued until the 17th December 1939 when the installation of the Company’s new wireless transmitting and receiving set was completed. 5. Muscat Infantry .—Subadar Hazur Hussain acted as Commandant of the Muscat Levy, with effect from 1st January to 8th March 1939, when Subadar Jahan Dad of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Punjab Regiment arrived from India and took over charge. For the first few months after his appointment Subadar Jahan Dad was keen and did excellent work. Lately however there has been a falling oft” in his work. ery few V. C. Indian Officers are capable of maintaining a high standard of work and efficiency unless supervised ; unfortunately Subadar Jahan Dad does not happen to be one of the few. However, in spite of a tendency on the part of their Commandant to take the line of least resistance, the Levy are more elheient than wdien he took over. G. State Finances. Rai Sahib Duli Chand, the Director of Customs and Comptroller, left Muscat in March without the Sultan’s permission and was dismissed trom State service on the same day. Since his departure the Sultan ms hnnselt taken control of State finances. He admits no one to the financial secrets of Muscat The Agency is provided with figures quarterly which are ;'“ ,d t . he financial position but as it is not possible to check them it is very difficult to estimate accurately the degree of solvency or insolvency Hie Stale tmance® have reached. From figures produced bv the Sultan and from wn^k'U'T 11 ' 108 Se n mS tha - t this year thc State llas inst managed to pav its a\ Mith a _very small margin on the credit side. Copies of the State “ IC*- ceipts and “ Expenditure ” statements for the last quarter of the year form an Appenmx to this report. The increase in Customs receipts was due o MSl^Malraf e S!; 1Mo f ,10s to the formation of a food reserve in Mu sea. and Alatrah. I lie abnormal expenditure under “ P. W.

Only Rs. 1,59,932-14-0 of this amount is “ ready ” money, which it is possible to utilise as a working balance. The result has been that during the year under review there has been more than one occasion when the monthly receipts have not been sufficient to meet the monthly salary bill and recourse has had to be made to local business men for temporary loans. On one occasion Rs. 25,0(M) were obtained from the State account in a Bombay Bank to meet current expenditure. The State has not been able to pay anything towards the redemption of a debt of Rs. 71,263 which has been owing to Messrs. Khan Baha dur Nasib and Son for some years, and it is more than probable that fresh loans have been obtained from State subjects. The financial position is better than it was last year, but is, however, still unsatisfactory. The State has no reserve worthy of the name and no working balance, nor is there a margin for much needed educational and public health measures. A serious shortage of rain affecting the date crop, or other unforeseeable disaster, and the State wall be in serious difficulties. It is difficult to see how further economies can be introduced. Expenditure has been reduced to a minimum. The Customs Tariff has been revised and duties have been increased. The new duties will come into force gradually in 1940 and may result in a satisfactory balance on the credit side at the end of the year. A further diminution in the Gwadur revenue is anti cipated and there will probably be a fall in Imports at Muscat due to world conditions and the abnormal imports in the last quarter of this year so that the yield from the increased duties may only be sufficient to maintain the estimated figure in the 1940 budget. The Director of Customs with this possibility before him has been careful not to budget for an increase in Customs revenue during , 1940. His estimate is the same as the 1939 estimate. As no new sources of revenue are apparent the State must just carry on and hope that no act of God or the Sultan’s enemies will precipitate a financial crisis. 7. War Measures .—The Sultan has identified himself wfith the Allied cause and has repeatedly expressed his friendship for Great Britain and his earnest wish that His Majesty’s forces may speedily prove successful. He has pro vided all facilities asked for without question. An agreement has been entered into with the Sultan by which he has undertaken to grant such facilities as His Majesty’s Government may require for the Royal Navy and for the Royal Air Force. In return he received a present of arms and ammunitions and a grant of Rs. 50,000. He has also been allotted a financial subsidy designed to enable him to undertake certain defence measures, which the outbreak of hostilities in Europe has indirectly rendered desirable and which the grant of the aforesaid facilities may in the future make essential. The Sultan has issued notifications forbidding any trading with the enemy and making it an offence to do any act which may in any way be adverse to the interests of His Majesty’s Government in their prosecution of the war. Local measures have been taken to prevent profiteering and to maintain a three months reserve of essential food-stuffs. The export of silver has been forbidden with the object of conserving the already inadequate supplies of Maria Theresa dollars. The Sultan has under consideration the installation of wireless telephony at Sur, Sohar, Dhofar and Muscat to enable him to keep in close touch with the principal governors. The strength of the Levy is to be more than doubled and recruiting has already been started. A survey of the Batinah fortifications has been carried out and the long over due repairs to strong points are to be undertaken as soon as possible.APPENDIX “ C RECEIPTS.
