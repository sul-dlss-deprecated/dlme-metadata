MRRATIYE ACCOUNT OF A RECONNAISSANCE CARRIED OUT IN SOUTH-WEST PERSIA DURING THE MONTHS OF MARCH, APRIL, MAY, AND JUNE 1884.PART I. Narrative Account of a Reconnaissance carried out in South-West Persia during the months of March, April, May, and June 1884. The objects of the reconnaissance were— I. —To traverse the road, Muhammerah, Shustar, Dizful, Khoramabad, Sultanabad, Kdm; the direct road from the head of naissanec* ° ^ 1&lt;ton ’ the Persian Gulf on Tehran, and, geographically speak ing, its natural, main commercial artery; II. —To traverse the direct road Kum, Gulpaigan ; III. —To traverse the country bordering the Bakhtian hills to the north and east (the road, I, skirts them to the west) in order to obtain information of all roads leading through them from Shustar and Dizful towards Gulpaigan and Isfahan ; IV. —To traverse the road from Isfahan through the Khugehlu hills to Behbahan and Bandar Dilam, on the Gulf, the most direct road from the sea to Isfahan (with a branch road from Behbahan to Shiraz) and one likely to prove to be of commercial and military importance; V. —And finally, without drawing attention or exciting suspicion, to keep a detailed record of the journey and to map the road traversed. Lance-Duffadar Shahsowar, Farsiwan, of the Queen’s Own Corps of Guides, accompanied me as orderly, and to him I am indebted for most valu able aid; on all occasions, in dealing with both Persian and Lur chiefs, he interpreted my wishes most intelligently and furthered them by the by-play so necessary in dealing with all Orientals; and he, a Shiya’, Muhammadan and co-religionist with them, when upbraided for serving a Christian power, would justify his action by many references to the justness of our rule and the security that he enjoyed under it, in contradistinction to the oppression that they suffered and to the insecurity of their lives and property under rulers of their own faith,—arguments always admitted. The journey was commenced from Bombay on the 5th March, passages being taken for myself, orderly, and cook in the S.S. Bombay to Basra. Arabia, one of the fleet of the British India Steam Navigation Company running weekly to the various ports of the Gulf. The following arms were obtained from the Bombay Arsenal, viz., «3 Henri-Martini breech-loading cavalry carbines, with buckets to attach to saddle and 50 rounds of ammunition per carbine. 6 Rifled pistols, muzzle-loaders, with ammunition. 3 Revolvers, with ammunition. 12 Besides the above (intended for presents and to he carried hy the party), a small stock of presents and medicines was laid in (xee page 112). I received from the firm of Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie and Company, Bombay, Agents of the above mentioned Steamship Company, the gieatest courtesy; not only did they arrange for money remittances, but they also gave me letters of introduction to their various agents in the Cull, letteis which were of the utmost service, as they were the means or procuring for me others to the Ilkhani and Ilbegi of the Bakhtians whose friendship for Mr, Mackenzie is of long standing— Karachi was reached on the Muscat „ „ Bandar Abbas „ „ Linga ,, ,, Bahrein Bushire 7th March 1884; 11th March 1884; 12th March 1884; 13th March 1884; 14th March 1884; loth March 1884; short delays being made at each port or roadstead to ship and discharge cargo. The steamer anchoring at Bushire for 24 hours enabled all necessary business to be transacted. Basra, on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, a Turkish town, a few miles above Muhammerah, was reached on the 18th March after undergoing the one day's quarantine imposed by the Turkish authorities as a means of extorting fees. I remained at Basra till the 22nd March, making final preparations for the land journey from Muhammerah to Kum. From the firm of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company, barats or monev orders were obtained on well-known merchants at Shustar, Dizful, Burujird and Isfahan, as well as letters to them to furnish me with others on Sultanabad, Kum, and Gulpaigan. Muhammerah to Kum (53o miles). On the 23rd March Mr. Robertson, Acting Consul at Basra, accompanied . , , r , , me to Muhammerah in the steam yacht belonging to the firm of Gray, Mackenzie and Company, my hosts, and introduced me to Shaikh Mizal, the Chief of the Ka'b Arabs, and from him I obtained the services of a mounted guide as far as Wais, on the Karun river above Ahwaz, the limit of his jurisdiction. Shaikh Mizal. Shaikh Mizal is a middle aged man of fine figure but sad countenance. He has no children and may not feel altogether secui'e in his position [see page 178) ; his elder brother, Muhammad, who lives at Isfahan, intrigues against him, and the difficulty of collecting the annual tribute is considerable; his darbar is conducted with great decorum and ceremony. The aba and kaba are here worn together with an ample puggerie. I had heard that a short time previously to my arrival some French commercial and military travellers had been displaying' considerable activity in the vicinity of the mouth of this, to us, most important river, the Karun, and had been denied a safe conduct; and I had been informed that it was useless to apply for it, the Shaikh being unable to guarantee a safe passage through the territory over which he exercises a patriarchal authority. Shaikh3 Mizal, however, is on terms of intimate friendship with Mr. Robertson and well disposed towards the British, and by his aid 1 was at once enabled to entertain mule carriage, and commence the journey to Shustar. Two hundred and fifty krans* were paid for seven mules to Dizful. The importance of the Port of Muhammerah and of the Karun river is dealt with in the detailed report, Part III, and pages 41, 178. Leaving Muhammerah on the 24th March, following tracks across the plain bordering the right bank of the Karun, Ahwaz, on its left bank, a distance of 82 miles, was reached on the 27th, the river being crossed at Umer-t-Merh in a small ferry boat, the horses and baggage mules swimming across. In this distance there are no villages and the party camped nightly with one or other of the Arab tribes met with en route ; the Arab guide giving out that I was in charge of property belonging to the Zil-ul-Suitan, ruler of Arabistan, ensured for me, if not in all cases hospitably, at least the power to purchase supplies at high rates. The country traversed is a treeless mud flat, without wells; drinking water is obtained from the river and ponds; firewood is supplied by the low tamarisk bushes, which, in certain localities, grow plentifully. The country, for the first 30 miles to the north of Muhammerah, produces little grazing, and is uncultivated beyond Gisbah, where the growth of the date palm ceases; within this radius floods are frequent both in the spring, from rain, and later on from the melting of the snow ; beyond it the grazing is good; the soil is of excellent quality, capable of growing cereals largely; but such is the unsettled state of the country that these rich lands are lying almost idle, and produce spontaneously nothing but grasses, wild flowers, and sweet-scented herbs which give out a delicious perfume when trodden upon. But a few wandering tribes were met with; these acknowledge either the authority of Shaikh Mizal of Muhammerah or that of Shaikh Molah of Hawizah, a district lying to the west of the Karun and within 30 miles of it [xee page 49 ). My guide did not consider it safe that any of the party should go amongst them unaccompanied by himself, as they are fearless robbers. The wealth of the Arab nomads consists in their flocks of sheep, which are numerous; of stoats, less numerous, and of their herds of donkeys, very numerous; horses and mares are not very plentiful; cows and cattle generally are scarce. Sheep are the most esteemed of their possessions on account of the value of their wool and milk; the former supplies the materials for their black blanket tents and rough blanket cloth ing, &amp;c., and the latter in its various forms of butter, milk, cheese, curds, &amp;c., is a staple article of food, and in the form of ghi a valuable article of commerce. They are generally badly clad in shapeless dresses of home-spun blanket material with slits on either sides for armholes and seem wretchedly poor, a poverty only to be accounted for by government extortion or to the fear of attracting attention by the possession of wealth [see pages .9, 99, 174). The head-dress consists of the usual coloured handkerchief, bound round the temple with bands of camel hair cord, worn by all Arabs. At Ahwaz was encamped the Ihtisham-ul-Sultanah, the deputy of the Zil- - , ul-Sultan, the eldest son of the Shah, who rules Arabis- tau as well as Isfahan and its dependencies (see page 21 ). # A kran = 8c7. Two and one-half krans go to the rupee.4 V The Ihtisham-ul-S nltanah, Ibrahim Mi'rza, is reported to be a weak gov- ernor, careless of the interests of the subjects he rules or Ilitisbam-ul-Sultanah. improving the resources of the country and anxious alone to increase the MniahkU or 'personal pickings,” such as bribes, fees, &amp;c I sent my orderly to inform him of my arrival, expressing a wish to \isi him • this action was necessary in order to obtain from him a safe conduct o Dizful I may here remark that I travelled as an othcer of the Indian Army on five months’ leave of absence, and orderly Shahsowar as a friend, in the same service as myself, a Khan, bent on a pilgrimage to Karbalah, the great Shiva’ shrine as soon as he had seen Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, and other woi - famed towns of Persia. The prince was ill and unable to see me, but sent his Wizir Mirza Buzurg Khan, Mustaufi, Arabistan, to call upon me, as well as the colonels of cavalry and infantry of his escort, the former Hajji Ibrahim Khan, son of the Ilbegi and nephew of the Ilkhani of the Bakhtians. ^ The escort consisted of, it was said, one regiment of infantry, the BaUhtiaii horse, 200 strong, and a battery of field artillery; four field guns were seen, but the existence of any artillery men is doubted; no Persian Camp. co i on pi 0 f artillery came to visit me, nor did I see one when I visited the camp: many of the infantry had been sent to Shustar, with donkeys, to fetch grain for the force, and the majority of the horses had been dispersed amongst the grazing grounds in the vicinity. The men occupied bell tents ; the tents of the senior officers were large, commodious, well pitched, well carpeted and the floors boarded; they were all of white canvas. None of the junior officers were presented. In the intercourse between officers and men, Persian etiquette rather than discipline was ob- Disciplme. served; the men saluted and remained standing; those of higher rank sat round about, at a respectful distance, after repeating the requisite salutations and making the customary bows. All spoke deferentially and in a low key. The “ silver stick,” a man of great ceremonial weight, stood at the door as sentry. There were no sentries over the camp {see page 12 ). I was treated with every courtesy and given a safe conduct to Dizful, but was warned not to go beyond that town as the road thence to Khoram- abad had for some time past been closed by the Dirikawand and Bairanwand, tribes of Peili Lurs occupying the defiles in the hills through which it passes. Halting a day at Ahwaz, I examined, during the early morning, as closely as the presence of the prince would allow, the obstructions there blocking the navigation of the river, and the neighbourhood, with a view to turning these obstacles by canal or tramway; and in the afternoon I went out shooting with the Bakhtians, a band of excellent horsemen, well mounted, good sportsmen, killing their birds freely firing from horseback, and at times, following up a bird, firing at full gallop. My movements were watched, and the Wizir was anxious to find out whether I was inquisitive about the Karun or not. As at the time I was trying the paces of a horse presented for purchase, and whilst riding over the ground I affected to be far more interested in it than in the Karun and its obstructions. The difficulties that beset the passage of the hills between Dizful and Khoramabad already began to make themselves felt. As before mentioned, by good fortune, excellent letters of introduction to both the Ilkhani and Ilbegi of the Bakhtians had been obtained; the former it was now learnt was at Ab-i-bid, one march to the north of Dizful, and to his instrumentality, it became more and more apparent, that 1 must look to effect my purpose, for0 Ahwaz to Shustar. tlie assurances o£ the Thtisham-i-Sultanah, that he 6ould afford no aid and that he himself could not pass through, were reiterated and apparently sincere. To gain the good-will of the powerful chief of the Bakhtians as well as a name for generosity, I gave to his nephew my revolver and to the Wizir of Arabistan a silver watch. This had the desired effect, for in Persia a pos sessions make the “ man.^ Hajji Ibrahim Khan gave me a letter to his uncle the llkhani and sent an orderly to announce my approach {see page 97). He is a man of influence with his tribesmen. Leaving Ahwaz on the 29th, Band-i-kfr, distant 24&lt; miles, was reached that evening, and Shustar, distant another 32 miles, on the 30th, crossing the river at the former stage and thence traversing the plain lying between the two arms of the Karun river, i.e., the Ab-i-Boleiti and Ab-i-huzurg-i-Shustar. The importance of this track and of the Shustar site, both from commercial and military points of view, will be remarked upon in detail [see pages 187 to 196) ; suftice it to say here that this fertile district affords grazing to the Hocks of a few wandering Arabs and is hut sparsely cultivated ; it is treeless, and produces no firewood. Water is obtained from the rivers and canals leading from them or ponds, and is of excellent quality. At Shustar the party was lodged in the house of Mirza Jhan, and were his ^ guests. The house is a fine structure, three-storied, built of stone and wood with balconies overhanging the Ab-i- Gargar which washes the foot of the cliff, 100' below it. It is well supplied with iC sardabs ” {see pages 57,199), excavated 4-0' below the surface and provid ed with air and light by a huge circular shaft. Like all Shustar houses it is falling into decay. Mirza Jhan proved to be an excellent host and a courteous Persian gentleman, and it gave pleasure to present him with material of the first quality sufficient to make an aba and kaba, the Arab style of dress being there worn. Halting at Shustar on the 31st to examine the neighbourhood, on the 1st April I marched to Ab-i-bid, the winter head-quar- Shustar to Dizful. ters of the llkhani of the Bakhtfarfs. He received me with distinction, sending his son and a troop of horse several miles out to meet me. During the cavalry display of feats of horsemanship, gone through for mv edification, over a most rough country, but one horse and rider turned a complete summersault; fortunately neither was hurt. He wished me to change my route and to pass through his territory to Isfahan and thence to Kum, stating that it was impossible for me to go via Dizful and Khoramabad, Lur robbers having closed the road, and that they would not allow the Shah himself to pass; urging the shortness of my leave of absence as an excuse for persevering in my resolution to take the shortest line to Kum, and seeing that 1 was resolved to attempt it, he, after consulting with Asad Khan, Governor of the Dizful district, his son-in-law, who had just arrived from Dizful, gave me a guide and a letter to Hajji Ali Khan, chief of the Sagwand tribe of Lurs, encamped, it was supposed, at Kaha Itezza, distant 45 miles from Dizful, and who was known to be migrating with his tribe to Khoramabad by the road that I was desirous of taking, lo take advantage of this fortunate circumstance it was resolved by a forced march to join Hajji Ali Khan, and to trust to his friendship for the llkhani, to whom he is related by marriage, for protection {see pages 9 } 85). The darbar of the llkhani, a middle-aged man of genial manners, was llkhani of the Bakhti- conducted with less gravity than that of Shaikh Mizal ans. at Muhammerah; the joyous nature and manly freedom6 Dizful. of the Bakhtians contrast, strongly with the sedate bearing of the Arabs whrt inhabit the country to the south, west, and east of Shustar (see page* 49 to od). The temperature under canvas rose to a maximum of 82°; the nights were cold and the dew heavy; temperature at sunrise, 65°. With reference to the lliyat tribes of Feili Lurs, through whose hill District of Lur-i-Ku- pasture lands the road from Dizful to Khoramabad clmk. passes, Sir A. Layard, in 1846, wrote that the Sagwand tribe was the most troublesome and then in open rebellion, so that no traveller could pass, and should on account of their perfidious character be avoided. Sir H. Rawlinson, then serving in the Persian Army, passed from Diztul to Khoramabad with Persian troops in 1866, and remarks that the Dirika- wand, confiding in their mountain fastnesses, had been long in a state of open rebellion and subsisted almost entirely by the plunder of travellers. On account of the unsafe state of the road, it was stated that two years ago two of the chiefs of the Bairanwand tribe and five of the Sagwand tribe were invited to KhoramaMd, ostensibly to receive favors, but in reality to be there murdered. Since this outrage matters have not improved (see poge 86). There was no alternative but to join the Sagwand tribe and to look to them for protection against the Bairanwand and Dirikawand. Halting on the 2nd May at Ab-i-bid to make these arrangements, Dizful was reached on the 3rd May. A very heavy storm of wind and rain drenched the party en route. Through the influence of the resident Wizir mule carriage was entertained at seven times the market rates, no chdrwdddr (proprietor of mules) being willing to run the risks of the journey at a less remunerative one.* At Dizful the party were the guests of the resident M izir, Hajji Hashem, a very perfect specimen of a Persian official and gentle- Hajj 1 Haslicm. m en. He promised great things but performed nothing; he would permit nothing to be bought, yet starved the horses. Notwith standing the reserve that is imposed upon a guest, it was necessary to break through it and to remark in unmistakeable terms upon condnct so calculated to render himself, his office, and the nation he represented despicable in the eyes of a stranger. No official, in this unhappy part of Persia, seems to have any work to do; if he has, he does not do it. It might be thought that a Deputy W izir might have had a few letters to write or a little business to transact; but such was not the case; he chatted with the saiyids, who, here, as elsewhere, presuming on their descent from ■’Ali, consider themselves pri vileged to present themselves everywhere, and others who lead equally idle lives and smoked the kalian all day. I met here a saiyid from India, brother, he said, of the tahsildar of Rawal Pindi, who bemoaned his unhappy fate; he had embarked in trade and had been robbed of everything a few miles out of Dizful. He entreated me not to attempt to pass north of the town lest my fate should be his. The necessity of presenting the Deputy Wizir with a Khal’at of third rate material was a source of regret. Shustar and Dizful are but ruined cities; here as elsewhere one meets with the same complaints of no government, no trade, no security, and, indeed, it was only necessary to look around on the rich but uncultivated soil, on the ruins of towns and villages, the want Government. For seven mules to Sultanabad 665 krans were paid, i.e., 95 krans per mule*7 of population, the rivers without traffic, the canals falling into disuse, &amp;c., &amp;c., to iudge of the extent of the decadence of a once well populated and fertile re&lt;;ion%nd to attribute it to the misgovernment so loudly and openly com plained of by men of all classes and professions, even in the presence of the rulers responsible for the downfall of their country [seepages 122, 174). “ If the Shah robs, why should not we ” ? is the question asked by the extortionate Khans and Wizirs who oppress the agriculturist, and the hill robbers who plunder the caravans. The locust blight of Moslem misrule has converted a o-arden of Eden into a desolate wilderness. &amp; r pi ie party was now fully equipped and consisted of myself, orderly, Madras cook, one Persian personal attendant, and two Servants. Persian grooms in charge of four horses, besides two muleteers, eight mules and two runagates, who, for their own purposes, attached themselves to the party; one was a deserter from the Persian army, the other, a thorough scoundrel, who was eventually ejected for attempting to commit sodomy. The grooms were soldiers, belonging to regiments recruited from the district of Khoramabad. Without pay for months, they had pawned even their percussion muskets, government property. 1 hey, as well as the personal attendant, were taken out of pawn. The wage of a groom on the march is one kran a day. In quarters they receive about 20 krans a month (10 krans = Rs. 4 = 6-v. 8^.). The Persian style of dress is worn at Dizful; it consists of a high or low, felt or lamb’s skin hat, a frock coat, pleated at the waist, I)i ' es8 ‘ with a stand-up collar and buttons down the centre ; the trowsers are wide and of cloth, much resembling pyjamahs in shape. Black and blue are considered to be the most respectable colours. An itinerary of the route taken from Muhamraerah to Dizful is given below :— Date. Stages. Distances. Remarks.

Leaving Dizfdl on the 5th April, Kal’a Rezza was reached by a forced march of 21 hours' duration, over a hilly and difficult Dizful to Khoram- coun trv, cut up by deep ravines, the Bala-rud bein« 4 ' forded (3' deep and rapid). One mule lost his footing 1 and was with difficulty recovered ; he lay down and resolutely attempted to drown himself.’ The country between KaTa liezza and Dizful was known to be infested by robbers, and Hajji Hashem had been directed by the Ihtisham-ul-Sultanah to arrange for the safety of the party. He promised an escort of horsemen. No escort appearing, enquiries were made and Haj ji Hashem's earnest assurances accepted that it had preceded me. No escort ha&lt;l been sent. Several of the inhabitants of Dizful, anxious to reach Khoramabad, joined the party, and numerous were the prayers and many the prostrations of the devout saiyids of their number. At Ab-i-zal the party joined the Sag- wand tribe of Lurs and migratel with them to Khoramabad by easy stages as below:— Date. Stages. Distances. Bemarks. Miles. April 5th ... ...

The nature of the9 hills favour the construction of a road with gentle gradients; the rock cutting required would be small; no provisions are procurable; this latter remark applies equally to any passage of the hills between Dizful and Isfahan, except on the post road Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan; the road is never impassable on account of snow; its chief dilliculties consist in the number of loose boulders strewn along it and which it is no one's business to remove, and in the large boulders blocking it in the ravines, by following which the road crosses the hill passes; obstructions, presenting no great difficulties to remedy ; were the road in good order a caravan of mules could pass from Dizful to Khoramabad in six or seven days at the outside [see part HI).

Notwithstanding the letter from the Ilkhani of the Bakhtfans, he at first received the party coldly and inhospitably; supplies were obtained with difficulty, and not until asked for. Humours began to spread that I was a sartip, called to Tehran by the Shah to join the army, and that I was also about to visit the Zil-ul-Sultan, the only man feared in these hills. They had no doubt been spread by the resident Wizir at Dizful as a means of securing from Hajji Ali fair treatment. They had the desired effect, Hajji Ali now acknowledged me as his guest, and directed his tribe to sell to the party whatever provisions they required. Lurs are a simple-minded people; the men are light hearted and joyous; the women go unveiled; the young are well favoured, with ruddy cheeks and dark auburn or black hair; they age early, but not so the men [see page 105 ); a one day for passage to Shustar and two days for their transit by mules or donkeys to Dizful, Khoramabad could be reached from With reference to the character of the Feili tribes of Lurs, the Dirikawaud, intractable; but were their chiefs treated with justice and firmness, robbery in its natural channel via Shustar to the Gulf. block.' In character he resembles Kalk Ali Khan referred to on page 98 as the murderer of Captains Grant and Fotheringham. Many deeds of cruelty and poor, where all should have been rich (tee pages 82, 263). Hajji Ali Khan may be described as a “ chip of the old He and his numerous sons together with the Sherff-ul-din, a miila who travelled with him, frequently visited our camp to chat, and never wearied in admiring our arms, clothes, sad dlery, &amp;c., and my orderly and myself daily passed some time in his tent. The10 fat or stout man or woman was not seen ; as a rule tlieir figures are wiry and well knit to eivlure fatigue. The prevailing diseases appeared to be indi gestion, rheumatism, fever, liver and spleen, due to scant clothing, sleeping on tlm ground and exposure to cold. The women wear loose shapeless di esses affording no warmth and little underclothing, ihe clothing of the childien is of a like character, affording no protection, against the cold, to the stomach and the regions of the spleen and liver. The women applied for charms to bring back the lost love of a husband, lost generally by reason of their sterility; to induce child-birth, i.vc. j toi amulets to be worn on the caps of their infant sons with the idea that the fortune of the giver would follow the child throughout life, and to this extent I became sponsor to the most infantile of Hajji All’s many sons. 'Ihe sick of the tribe came for medicines. Ordinary pills had little eilect, but when six failed to satisfy, I threw up the case. Unmolested, I was allowed to move about the camps of the various fami lies; each family or group of families, camped on the pasture land told off to it, and each with its flocks and herds took the road assigned to it on the march. The confusion on the line of march passes description ; sheep, goats, bullocks, donkeys, kc , horsemen, and foot passengers, blocked the narrow hill-paths; the cries of the herdsmen and herdswomen, “ Ab-o-ha,” were heard everywhere, and when in the narrow ravines, the pressure and crush were the greatest, the chiefs would add to the hubbub and confusion (tamdshd (spectacle) they called it) by discharging their rifles, of which the tribe possessed about a dozen (Peabody’s Martini-Henry). Great interest was taken in my movements and my note book excited special curiosity. Many were the exclamations “ W hat does he write?” The subjects of conversation that most interest all Lurs are our poli tical relations with Russia, Turkey, Egypt and Afghanistan; our marriage laws and social customs. Great Britain is known as London; admiration is apparently felt for both Turkey and Egypt for having spent such vast sums of foreign money and declining to repay them. Russia is recognised to be a great power {ree page 29). Afghanistan is looked upon as a British possession, and its Amir to rule it by our favour. Orderly Shahsowar himself appeared to be of this opinion. Great interest everywhere was taken in the movements of the Mahdi. Ru mours that he had gained great victories over the British were believed and no denial v T as accepted; it was hinted to me that it was quite natural that I should not acknowledge a defeat. The sympathy with him is political rather than religious, it being hoped that he, a Muhammadan, may conquer a Christian power and be an agent destined to raise the fortunes of Islam ism. A withdrawal from the Soudan will be construed into a Christian defeat and a Muhammadan victory. The Muhammadan tenets do not appear to be strictly kept by them. Hajji Ali observed the hours of prayer, only because, perhaps, the Sherif-ul- dfn, to whom he was greatly indebted for a money loan, to enable him to meet the demands of the revenue officers, was his guest; he had twenty-five wives and did not object to one of the ladies’ of his camp pressing upon me the accept ance in marriage of one of her daughters, an honour declined on the pleas that, whilst Ilajji All’s guest, I was his son, and all his family my brothers and sisters and that I was not desirous of adding to my imperiimenia. When their ailments were such as to require the administration of charms and philtres and they were recommended to carry their requests to Ali, in whom they trusted, they received the idea as an excellent joke.11 \&lt;y Hajji Ali and his many sons were so pleased with the Martini-Henry cavalry carbines carried by myself and orderly that they desired to possess one, and the former sent me word that by friendship or other means one must be his. On declining to meet the demand and on returning a colt, sent for acceptance, on the excuse that there was no groom available to le*d it, he instigated his immediate attendants to rob me. On the night of the 15th April, the horses were cut loose to create con fusion, my orderly drawn from his tent to see to them and an attempt made to rifle it. It did not succeed, as I was expecting some such attempt and was on the alert. From this date, two of the party were placed nightly as sentries over the camp and all baggage was packed in a heap. Whilst pressed on all sides by the.crowd endeavouring to push across the narrow bridge thrown over the Kulohu stream, attempts were made to wrest, from Orderly Shahsowar, his arms. A like attempt made on the 2()th succeeded, but the thief beino- recognised as one of ilajji Ail s retainers and word being sent to him to that effect, he caused the rifle to be returned. Before the whole of his mounted following his conduct was characterized as that of a thief, as coward]v, in hospitable and unworthy of a chief of his high standing. dhis outburst of indignation, accompanied by hard words (in which Orderly Shahsowar took an able and prominent part), a direct accusation of theft and an appeal to the holy Alula of the party, the Shenf-ul-din, to wit ness to its justice and necessity, quite cowed Hajji Ali. He sent several of his sons to explain to me that he, in truth, had not robbed me. Powerless, in his hands, I acquiesced in, without accepting, his explanation, and gave up my intention of escaping from him by a forced march into Khoramabad, on its being pointed out to me that to do so with- out an escort, wnich Hajji Ali, whilst demanding a receipt from myself for my body, refused to give, would be to court destruction and to give to my host the opportunity that he desired [xee page 9S). J tii ^ e Partfd 2 (&gt;od frie ™ ls ; and on passing through Ardal I left with the 11 khani of the Bakhtians a brace of cavalry pistols to be presented to his eldest son ; after his menacing demand and subsequent attempts to thieve it was impossible to give him a rifle although his service to me had been of the utmost value. As^ he had heird that I had given presents to all officials of distinction at Ahwaz, Shustar and Dizful, the omission to satisfy his demand the most powerful and feared of all, must have been galling to his pride* especially as every man and woman of the exodus knew that he had made it. I unng the passage of the hills several attempts at robbery were made w the neighbouring tribes, and Hajji Alps party lost several mules. The .ai king the watch dogs, when the camps were pitched in the vicinity of the Palich pass, the most dangerous part of the hills, was incessant. Khoiamabad resembles Hizful and Shustar, t inasmuch as it is in ruins; Khoramabad. a ! ] .V ade 1S , s * a S' 1,ant &gt; &amp;c. It lies in a treeless district at the head of the gorge of the Ab-i-Khoramabad and to the^north of the wide, extensive and fertile valleys of the Dar-i-rud and Ab-i-Ixnoramabad which unite south of the town. The party were here accommodated in a summer house within the outer waifs of the fort and overlooking the river. The view from the Bala-Hisar in the early dawn, was a picturesque one; snow lay on the distant mountains ■ the black and brown colours of the barren hills contrasted well with the brown- is i yellow of the bridge the green of the poplars and vegetation, and the } ellow muddy waters of the Ab-i-Khoramabad in the foreground.12 The gardens of the Bala-Hisar are well stocked with rose bushes, pome granate and fine cypress trees; on the highest points of the latter flamingoes roost. Both days and nights are cool at this season of the year details, Part IF). 1 was lead to expect to see considerable forests of oak during the pas- sage of the Lur hills; the belt of the country producing them is not 50 miles broad ; the timber is poor, of small size, and the trees anything but plentiful. Ev r ery statement made by a Persian, whether prince or peasant, must be received with the utmost caution and never believed until verified; his mind is of that pretentious nature that a stunted tree is magnified by it into a forest of noble oaks ; a col lection of mud hovels into a populous town; a few field guns into a park of garrison artillery of the largest calibres, and a dozen horsemen into a regiment of cavalry. At Khoramabad the high plateau of mid-Persia is reached (4,000'—0,000') and the dangers of the hill country cease. I was there Plateau of mid-Persia, well received by Shahzada Sharuk Mirza, the Deputy Wizir, acting for the governor of the district the Ikhmut- i-Daulat, called to Tehran to answer for the lawlessness just described. He has since been deposed as Governor. Hearing that a regiment of infantry was encamped on the plain to the west of the town, I paid a visit to its colonel. He received me in the usual Persian manner, serving tea, &amp;c. The junior officers of the regiment came in and sat round the tent, the floor of which was both Infantry camp. boarded and carpeted ; there was no tent furniture ; all sleep on the ground and eat seated on the ground. There were no sentries and no camp discipline seemed to be observed ; the soldiers crowded round about the tent door until ordered to move off! The men's tents resembled those seen at Ahwaz; those of the officers' were smaller; here, too, the “ silver stick' appeared to be a most important cere monial personage [see page 4). Leaving Khoramabad on the 21st April, by the follow- Khoramabad to Buru- ji'rd. ing stages Burujird was reached.

Shahzada Sharuk Mirza furnished the party with a guide, and two sowars of the Telegraph Department (Persian) attached themselves to it The guide's one object was to graze his mare and her filly, and he soon left the party to guide themselves. . There are no caravanserais along this road, and the party found quarters in one or other of the dirty huts of the villages best suited for its accommoda tion. The caravanserai outside the Burujird city walls being in ruins, quar ters in one within the walls were occupied. k13 The city of Burujird is picturesquely situated at the head of the valley, in which direction it narrows, and the barren hills bounding it there lessen in height. Between Khoramabad and Chulunchulah in the valley of the Ab-i-Dizful the mule road is good, or capable of being readily made so, as it passes over or skirts huge undulations of slate or clay, rising to heights of from 6,500' to 7,000', above the general level of the plateau, elevated 5,800'to 6,000'; snow Avas met with at an elevation of 7,000'; the chief difficulties of the road consist in the crossing of the very numerous rills of snow which cut up the hill sides. During the month of January and part of February this section of the road Avould become difficult, for snow then lies more or less deep. ^ hen fording the Hum river a baggage yabu Avas Avashed down stream and recovered Avith great difficulty. The valley of the Ab-i-Dizful is thickly studded Aviih villages, here for - the first time met Avith in the 303 miles traversed Dizfiii. ^ ° ^ 1 since leaving the coast. Here also, for the first time, the pursuit of agriculture is at all seriously attempted. It is well cultivated, but still leaves much to be desired in that respect, and is from 5 to 10 miles broad. Vines thrive. With the exception of a Icav willows and poplars groAving round the villages, the country is still treeless. There are no wells, Avater being obtained from streams or canals, which are numerous. Burujird is a large and thriving town of 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants, the activity in its bazars being most refreshing to see uruJllt ’ after the almost total annihilation of all trade along the route traversed. The curiosity of the inhabitants to see a stranger was great, and 1 AA r as told that I Avas the second or third European and the first Englishman avIio had visited the place. It is surrounded by a Avail from 4 to 6 miles in circumference and entered by 5 gates. In every Persian town ruined houses are a common sight, and Burujird is no exception to the rule. It is noted for its cottons of local manufacture Avell suited to the Persian taste. It enjoys a cold Avinter and a temperate summer in the shade. At times, with a cool atmosphere, the sun's rays are very poAverful and exposure to them is to be avoided (June to September). Wheat and barley are harvested in July and grapes ripen in September. The dangerous hill country being uoav crossed, there was no longer any necessity to seek guides or other aid from Persian officials; and as it was advisable not to attract the attention of princes and wizirs, now that the region of telegraphs Avas reached, by troubling them for quarters, the party from Burujird, until it arrived at Ardal, the summer head-quarters of the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, on the 31st May, when again a dangerous and unknown labyrinth of hills Avas entered, took up quarters in the serais or arranged for its oavu accommodations in the villages, Avhere such did not exist. From Burujird radiate caravan roads to all the fertile agricultural, pastural and commercial districts of Persia, i.e., (I) to ^Importance of Burn- IIamad{ ^ Karmanshah and North-West Persia; (II) to Tehran and North Persia; (III) to Isfahan and East Persia. It is distant from Hamadan 4 marches, Karmanshah 6 marches, Tehran, 14 to 16 marches via Hamadan, and 11 or 12 via Sultanabad, and Isfahan 10 marches [see page 225). Climate of the elevat ed valley, Burujird to Isfahan.14 Situated in a fertile valley extending more or less in a north-west and south-east direction to Karmanshah and Isfahan, and hut three marches distant from Khoramabad at the head of the only practicable pass leading from Shustar, Dizful and Muhammerah, through the hills of Luristan (includ ing the Bakhtian hills, extending to Isfahan) its great commercial and militarv importance to a naval power holding the Persian Gulf is very great {see Pari III). Between Burujfrd and Isfahan extend the plains of Silakhor, Barbarud, Jopalag, Fendan and Chahar Mahal, famous for their fertility. They lie between the main Zagros range to the south, a continuation of the Alwand chain, and a secondary range to the north, composed of hills of shale, more rounded and less elevated than the former, the kernel of which, the Roswand, is however barren and rocky, although easily passed at several points [see page 69). The line Muhammerah, Dizful, Khoramabad, Burujird, Sultanabad, Kum, Tehran may be considered to be the main commercial artery of Persia. A line of railway from Tehran to the Gulf should doubtless approximately follow it; the country is more favourable to its construction on this line than on others; its geographical features also favour the construction of feeders to it, from Hamadan, Karmanshah, Isfahan {see Part III, page 173). At Burujfrd beggars abound and solicitations to Allah to protect the party and to prosper their aims were bought at the cost of the smallest of copper coins. i, / .... , 1 * ' i From Burujfrd, Sultanabad was reached by the stages Burujird to Sultanabad. 1 XJ ] 0W J &amp; April 24th, Ztileon ... 22 miles (elevation 7.640'). April 2oth, Tura ... 14 miles (elevation 6,490'). Serai. April 26th, Sultanabad ... 24 miles (elevation 6,110'). Serai. 60 miles. The road to Zaleon and northward of it for several miles is generally a hard and firm mule track, traversing huge rounded undulations of gentle slopes (up to 20°) rising to heights of 8,000'; its chief difficulties, as before, consist in the numerous snow rivulets, which have, at this season of the year, to be crossed. Heavy snow had fallen in this region 15 days before I crossed it and the scene before entering the Khushk-i-durr valley, a few miles to the south of Zaleon, was a striking one; in all directions were to be seen the tops of the blown barren undulations covered with patches of snow ; the green of cultivation occurred nowhere except in the bottoms of the deep \alleys; with the exception, as before, of a few poor poplars, grown round each village, the country is treeless; no shrubs are cultivated and firewood is scarcely procurable at all; to warm their houses, the villagers use duno- fuel. The villages are small, averaging in size 100 yards x 100 yards'; every other inhabitant is marked with small-pox. At this season, in places’ the wheat is sprouting; in others, ploughing is going on. This section of the road was closed for three months this year (January to March), the winter having been a most severe one; as a rule it is closed for the one month of mid-winter only fmddle of January to middle of February). The rivers met with were deep, rapid, and difficult to ford. After entering the Tang-i-Tura, the passage through the Roswand rano- e , and joining the telegraph road from Ilamadan, the road, though unformed; is generally broad, level and good.15 Notwithstanding that elevations of 8,000' are crossed, yet, on account of the general elevation of the valleys (0,800' to 0,900'), the ascents and descents are not heavy. Sultanabad lies in the wide, populous, and well cultivated valley of the Ab-i-Kallaru in the midst of an important agricultural Sultanabad. and manufacturing district. The first view obtained of the Kallaru valley was the finest seen since leaving Muhammerah, heightened as it was by the picturesque effects of light and shade, on the barren brown hills, and bright green, cultivated valley, caused by a thunder-storm which was raging at the time. The villages round about give evidence of the pros- perity of their inhabitants who are largely employed in the manufacture of carpets. The town itself, cleaner and laid out with greater regularity than most Persian towns, occupies an area of about 800 yards X 800 yards. During the months of January and February snow lies and the cold is excessive (at times 80° of frost). The people of the district are fair complexioned and of excellent physique, both men and women. At Sultanabad a mixed mule and donkey carriage was entertained at the average rate of krans per pack-animal per day. Transport was not plenti ful, and if mules had been waited for, several days would have been lost. From Sultanabad, Kum was reached by the follow- Sultanabad to Kum. ing . stages ._ April 28th, Shah war ... 14 miles (elevation 5,570'). ,, 29th, Ibrahimahad ... 10 miles. Serai. „ 30th, Anetbeg ... 32 miles (elevation 4,910'). May 1st, Klim ... 26 miles (elevation 3,470'). Guest-house. 82 miles. (Kum is 4 stages or 87 miles distant from Tehran.) The mule track through out is level and good, and is capable of being readily widened into a cart- road. The undulations crossed rise to heights of 6,000'. The country between Sultanabad and Kum is very indifferently culti vated and many deserted villages stud its broad plains; the canals and kanats have been allowed to fall into disuse. Wells are almost unknown. The soil is capable of growing excellent cereals; round about its few villages fruit trees of various descriptions flourish, such as the apple, plum, pomegranate, fig, &amp;e. The vine is very extensively cultivated. Rhubarb of excellent quality grows. Drinking-water is obtained from streams and rivulets. From the great want of timber the mud huts of the villages are roofed in with domes of mud bricks ; the frost acting upon these causes them fre quently to fall in and to give to the village a most forlorn appearance, and every spring they have to be renewed. Why the Persians do not use, as a building material, the excellent stone that abounds everywhere in and near the hills, can only be explained by say ing that they are Orientals and do as Orientals do. On crossing the barren neck to the east of Saleon, distant seven miles from Kum, the sight of the golden dome of its sacred Imamzada, glowing in the sunshine like a ball of fire, was hailed with exclamations of delight by the muleteers.16 Abstract of the preceding journey, Muhammerah to Kwm.

Wltl \ a Nourishing bazar and the centre of a well culti yated district [see details, Part IV). The garden of the Miman Khana, decked with red bunting and brio-h, with roses and marigolds presented a gay appearance, and the view towards ic distant brown hills still topped with snow, over the golden dome of tin sacred temple with its slender and elegant minarets covered with 'dazec earthenware of the imdescent deep bluish green and gold so highly esteemed and the art of producing which is now lost, was no ordinary one. The city was full of blue puggaried Saiyads, and its narrow streets more difficult and dangerous than usual to traverse, being blocked by pack-animals and honey combed with holes through which water is lifted from the underground street17 channels or rather drains. The Europeans of the Telegraph Department do not, in this sacred city, lead a joyous existence, and no lady dares to show herself in its streets uncovered by the white sheet worn by Persian woman, lest the populace should insult her. Being instructed not to visit Tehran (to do so was quite unnecessary, the roa eing well known), halting at Kum on the 2nd May to change carriage, Kum to Gulpaigan. ^ ie P ai 'ty set out for Gulpaigan by the direct road and reached it by the following' stages May 3rd, Daghan May 4th, Daulatabad May 5th, Muhallat May 6th, Nazi a May 7th, Gulpaigan 5 stages Miles. 15 24 24 28 21 112 Elevation.

The mule road is good and level for some 50 miles from Kum, following generally the valley of the Ab-i-Khonsar. The road then leaves the valley and passes over the hill known as the Godar-i-nar, at an elevation of 7,890', before descending into Mahallat, a large and flourishing village, well watered and surrounded by cultivation and fine timber trees. Thence do Gulpaigan the mule road taken (there are alternative ones, see part IV) is generally level and good to the foot of the Hulwand, passing between un dulations and hills separated by flat and often broad valleys. The hills and undulations are steep and barren; the valleys are often uncultivated. Wells are almost unknown; water is obtained from streams. After crossing the Hulwand at an elevation of 8,200/ the road descends into Gulpaigan Gulpaigan occupies an important position on the road between Isfahan and Gulpaigan. Burujird, Hamadan, &amp;c., yet its bazar is small and its TT^ll cnn r 1 '*1 tra ^ e insignificant ; it lies in a wide and fertile vallev and is well supplied with fruit gardens.

Khonsar represents a series of villao-e^ known by various names, occupying the bed of a narrow and most fertile valley’ Khonsar. un der the snow-clad Khonsar range. Fruit here 318 On tbc 10th, crcssin' tlio Kuli i-KhonPar, at an elevation of 9,620 feet, Pum-i-Katnnr, elevation 7,860 feet, and distant 15 miles, situated at the foot of the Kuh-i-Afhus and the snowy range blocking all further passage into the Bakhtian country, was reached. Hearing of a pass leading through the hills at Ali-Gudar, I proceeded there Ly the following stages :— the road, skirting the foot of the snowy range at a distance of from 5 to 1 0 miles from it, is good hut undulating. The hill streams are difficult to ford ; crossing the head-waters of the Ab-i-Kum, a baggage yabu was washed two miles down-stream before he was recovered, more dead than alive. Ali-Gudar is a large village, lying in a fertile valley, at the head of the lightly laden, could get to Shustar by this path, which was said to be very pre cipitous and in places obstructed by trees and brushwood ; all agreed that mules laden with Indian mule trunks could only with great difficulty traverse it, if at all. Dizful-Khoramabad-Burujird, no other path exists. r Ihe pasture within the hills was described as excellent. Provisions such as flour, butter, milk, eggs, fowls, sheep, &amp;c., can be obtained from the tents of the lliyats. This road was still blocked by snow, and none of the Bakhtians had as yet come in; the road would probably be passable early in June. Ali-Gudar is 3 stages from Burujird; their names are Derbend and Bahram- abad. This is the most direct Isfahan-BurujiTd road. lletracing my steps 1 again arrived at Dum-i-Kamar on the Hth May. Buruii'rd to Isfahan ^ direct road runs hence to Isfahan via Dumbana and road is used by caravans in summer only; for live months of the year, *.&lt;?., November to March, it is closed by snow, which is then described as lying 6' to 1U' deep {see details, Part IV). Making allowances for Persian exaggera tion and taking into consideration the small rainfall of South Persia, snow probably never lies to a greater depth than 3' at any time [see pages 58, 272). The inhabitants of this district are miserably poor and wretchedly clad in cottons. r lhey weave woollen blankets, but so poor are they that they sell them, and themselves starve with cold. There are numerous flocks of sheep and goats and herds of donkeys to be seen in every village; their dung is stacked and used as winter fuel; the district is treeless and produces no firewood. During^the winter the peasants keep to their houses, huddled round the dung lire for warmth; the dung is burnt under a wooden frame work covered with a large coverlet, affording warmth to all who sleep under it Feet.

The soil is fertile; the vine is extensively cultivated ; fruit trees blossom towards the end of May. Water is obtained from streams and rivulets, which are numerous and caused by the melting of the snow. When this elevated valley was tra versed patches of snow were still lying here and there in the basin. Leaving the direct Isfahan, Burujird road, Akhora-Bala, distant 15 miles sn'i'i ci ' i. and elevated b.IIO feet, was reached on the 15th May. Akhora-Bala to bbustar. ’ . ’ vt \ i i' ' i -n J Ine road from this valley across the Lkikhtian hills to Shustar and Dizful resembles in all essentials that described as entering the hills at Ali-Gudar. Skirting the hills in a southerly direction, on the 16th May, Khugan, elevated 7,5U0 feet and distant LSf miles, was reached ; on the 17th May, Imam- zada Ishmail, elevated 7,060 feet, and distant 17 miles; and on the Iftth May T . r . . the Tang-i-Ghazi (7,100 feet), a pass leading through the Kuh-i-Chuhi over the Zarda Kuh to Bazuft and the upper Isfahan-Shustar road was reached. Here snow and swollen mountain torrents prevented all further passage. The district traversed between Akhora-Bala and the Tang-i-Ghazi is fertile and grows cereals of excellent quality ; vines and fruit trees of many varieties (plum, aprieot, cherry, &amp;c., &amp;c.) flourish. In climate, it resemble - that of the district already described, Dum-i-Kamar, Ali-Gudar; for 5 months its inhabitants are prisoners in their houses, snow falling to a depth, it was said, of from 5 7 to 10\ It affords excellent grazing between the months of June and November, at which time the Iliyat Bakhtfaiis stream across the hills and occupy it. The migration of the tribes from their winter quarters or “garmair ” about Shustar and Hizful, to their summer grazing grounds or “sarcknr” about Ali-Gudar, Akhora-Bala, Imamzada-Ishmail, &amp;c., occupies about a month or three weeks, the pace being regulated by the necessity of daily grazing their flocks and herds [see page 8%). There are many Armenian villages scattered about Akhora-paen, Sang-i- baran and the Feridan district; the Armenian women are short and stout with ruddy complexions and placid countenances; they cover the lower part of their faces, from the nose to the chin, with a triangular shaped strip of white cloth. The men resemble the Persians; perhaps their build is a little stouter. Having completed, as far as was possible and as seemed necessary, the circuit of the Bakhtiaii hills, I proceeded to Isfahan by the stages below; following generally the course of the Zaindarud river. Serai the reconnaissance of the district occupying 1J&gt; days, 257 miles being travelled to effect it.

His second son, a youth of 17 or IS years, was an officer in the same regiment; serving in no inferior position and under little restraint he will acquire few military habits. He was the idol of adulation of all his father’s retainers. The regiment is one of those placed under the orders of the Zil-ul-Sultan, and orders had been - . T « issued for its assembly at Isfahan ; men were met dailv Persian Infantry. , • . marching in from all quarters; they were, as a rule, young men, about twenty years old, of good physique; each man carried a percussion musket; the majority were fairly well dressed but several were clothed in rags. The uniform worn consisted of a long blue coat, with a stand-up collar, of cloth or cotton, gathered in at the waist, and fastened down the front by brass buttons, upon which were impressed the Persian arms (Lion and Sun); and blue trousers of cloth or cotton with a red stripe. The uniform of officers and men is the same in shape and colour, but differs in quality. f l he infantry were seen at Isfahan undergoing their preliminary drills, which consisted, for the most part, in marching round and round the drill ground, the Maidan-i-Shah, in battalions, the companies at half intervals. No accoutrements were worn. Few officers were seen on parade. The district of Chadagan, elevated 6,500', to 7,000', is well watered, fertile, enjoys an excellent climate, and is well calculated to become the site of a sanitarium. Chadagan was 60° cooler than Isfahan. IV. Isfahan to Lushire through the Kuhgehlu hills, Behbahdn and Bandar-Dildm. ^ lo rest and to make preparations for the journey to Bushire through the K tiwgehlu hibs via Behbahan and Bandar-Diiam, a halt was made at Isfahan fiom the 2.oid to the 2uth May. Great difficulty was found in entertaining carnage, both on account oi the reputed badness of the road, the scarcity of provisions and its comparative insecurity. To the apathetic nature of the iersian, to tread in an unknown path is most distasteful. Mule caniage was entertained at the rate of krans per mule per day, through the instrumentality of Mr. Collignon of the lirm of Hotz and ompany, meichants, Bushire, Isfahan and Tehran, who, after great per suasion induced a large mule-owner, employed by his firm, to send seven with tlie party. Of the servants who accompanied the party from Dizful none now lemained ; the cold, long marches in the hills and off caravan roads, proved disagreeable to them. r About one-half of Isfahan, the capital of Southern Persia, is in ruins, and Isfahan. the other half presents but few objects of interest. It . , p ^. s s ^ ua ^ e d i 11 the centre of a very fertile district, pro ducing cereals and fruits, including the grape, in abundance. The poppy is very extensively cultivated (see details, Bart LV, and Revised Gazetteer of Benia). J21 His Royal Highness the Zil-ul-Sultan having heard of my arrival in Isfahan, 1 obtained permission to visit him. He express- Zil-ul-Sultan. himself as favourably affected towards the British, and gave me letters for the road to Bushire as well as a letter to the llkhani of the Bakhtians now at Ardal, and whom I had already visited at Ab-i-bid [see page 5). He also sent me his photograph taken as a general in Prussian uniform, a gift which proved of value, and which being freely exhibited gained for the party honourable treatment. The Zil-ul-Sultan, the eldest son of the Shah, but by an inferior wife, z.e., not of the Kajar royal blood, and therefore not his heir, has gained a name for ability and impartiality combined with strictness and energy. He is the most able of the ShatPs sons, and no doubt, when the time comes, will contest the throne with the heir-apparent, a weak, bigoted and debauched prince. He at present governs about one-third of Persia, his jurisdiction extending over Pars, Luristan, Arabistan, \azd, Isfahan, and Burujird, ?.&lt;?., South, West and South-West Persia. r Ihe Shah has placed under his independent control 17 of the 70 battalions composing the Persian army [seepage 145), and he has been allowed to import 6,000 Martini-Henry rifles and one and a half millions of cartridges. He protects all religions, and under his rule oppression has ceased to harass the Armenians,* so plentifully scattered throughout his jurisdiction. He is fond of manoeuvring his troops, and by granting them favours and paying them at times, he leads them to look to himself as their chief and protector. He affects many uniforms of which the Prussian seems to be most in favour at present. No doubt he does not adopt the soldier's dress without an object. In figure he is short and stout; his countenance is not a benign one, and a east in his eye imparts to it a cunning expression. 1 brought to his notice the very insecure state of the roads in Luristan. His Royal Highness answered that he had dealt leniently with the tribes hitherto, and that his clemency had been mistaken, by them, for weakness, but that he would now act with severity. Silence was kept concerning Hajji All's inhospitable conduct; to have mentioned it would, no doubt, have given a wished for opportunity of imposing a fine which he was quite unable to meet. Leaving Isfahan on the 27th May, Ardal was reached by the stages below:— May 27th, Bagh-i-Wahsh, distant „ * 28th, Bagh-i-Wagarun „ „ 29th, Deh-i-Kurd „ „ 30th, Khareji „ „ 31st, Avdal » 5 stages Miles.

There are no difficulties, however, other than what could be readilv removed by the expenditure of a little skilled labour. Persians seem to be t, , utterly ignorant of hill road making: blasting is never resorted to; picks and crowbars are never used ; smooth places are made smoother and wider, but all difficult passages over rock or boulders are left untouched. Ardal can be reached by a direct road in 3 or 4 stages from Isfahan; the road via Deh-i-kurd was taken with the view of proceeding along the upper Shustar-Isfahan road via, liazuft as far as Ali-Kuh. This was found, even at this forward time of the year, impossible, on account of snow which lay thick on the hills beyond Deh-i-kurd. Full en- Dizfdl! aUt0 mSfcarani1 quiries were made to gain information of the two roads joining Isfahan with Shustar from those who had frequently made the journey and the chdrwdddrs with the caravans met with en route [see details, Fart IF). The party halted at Ardal on the 1st June, guests of the Ukhani, who, by fur- ArJil nishing a guide and giving letters to various Khans tl ' through whose territory the party was about to travel, greatly facilitated its passage through these intricate and difficult hills. Without guides as escort from the camp of one Iliyat tribe to another, it would be impossible to get through the mountains, as there are practically no villages and the road is often a mere single file mule track. The Ilkhani congratulated me on my safe passage between Dizful and Lurs Khoramabad, stating that he had not expected to see me again alive, there having spread a rumour shortly after my departure that the party had been robbed and massacred by the Lurs. He smiled when he mentioned Hajji All’s name and naively remarked that the Western Lurs could in no way compare with the Bakhtiaris in their respect for life and property. A Martini-Henry cavalry carbine was presented to the Ilkhani as a slight recognition of the very valuable services that he had rendered to the party Between Ardal and Behbahan what few villages are met with en route are most uninviting and the party preferred to bivouac rather than enter them. Ardal to Bassuki. Leaving Ardal on the 2nd June, the following stages were taken to Bassaki:— 2nd June Talibac 3rd „ Mardji&lt;ran 4th „ Ali or Khana Mlrza 5th „ Bassaki Miles. 22 22 26 24 Elevation. 7,900' 7,500' 6,300' 7,850' 4 stages 94 Bassaki by the direct road to Isfahan via Kumesheh is distant from it 120 miles {see page 292). The road throughout is a fair mule track, which can be easily made into a good mule road. It passes over no greater elevation than 9,100 feet. For a description of the country see page 287, part IV. Hie sc*enery near the Tang-i-Dusabil, where the streams pass through narrow clefts in the rock, is imposing; and here the surrounding hills are on a massive and grand scale.23 Bassdki, Ihe encampment of Mula Ali Khan, lies a few miles to the eastward of Pelart, or Felat, under the Kuh-i-Dina, the passage of which for midable hill has to be made between Bassaki or Pelart and Sisakht or Chenar. Mula Ali Khan treated the party most hospitably ; his son is connected by marriage with the family of the llkhani of the Bakhtfans and is Pay Sergeaut of the Bakhtiarf Horse. The distinction with which the party had been treated bv its colonel (see page 4) had become known throughout the regiment and caused it to be well received by all its members, who are widely scattered. Mula Ali Khan would not hear of my taking the direct road of 2 stages to Khurrah near Chenar, a Kuhgehlu encampment, on account of its diflicul- ties. On arrival at Khurrah, 1 was informed that this was an easier mad than the one of 3 stages rid Sisakht, which I actually took, but that possibly the two rivers which I found so difficult to ford might have proved imprac ticable to cross unless they had been bridged by the llivats. Changing guides at Bassaki on June Gth, Kina, distant 2J miles, elevation 7,200 feet, was reached by good mule tracks; the greatest Kina, 24 miles. difficulty was experienced in fording the Malburr stream, a rapid and deep hill torrent. After expending an hour in fruitless attempts to cross it, and when, in despair, further attempts were about to be given up, a Saiyid appeared, well acquainted with the nature of the ford. It was crossed at a very oblique angle and by allowing the animals to be almost carried down-stream, whilst at the same time, guided by two men, they were gradually steered across. Highest elevation crossed 8,400 feet. A better halting place would have been Khafr (elevation 7,000 feet) at the foot of the Kuh-i-Dina, distant from Kina about 4 miles. On June 7th the passage of the Kuh-i-Dina was made at an elevation of 10,880 feet (Gardan-i-Bazurr), Sisakht, at the foot of its southern slopes, elevated 7,000 feet, being reached after a journey of 15 Sisakht, 2u miles. hours’ duration. Here Ali Baksh, chief of the district, provided for the wants of the party. The mule track followed could, without difficulty, be improved into a good mule road; the gradients are not as a rule steep; where steep, by zig-zag ging, they could be made gentle. Snow was crossed, but it was hard frozen and pleasant to walk or ride over. On the 8th the Kuhgehlu encampment of Wall Khan at Khurra, distant Khurra near Chenar, 25 miles, elevation 7,390 feet, was reached by an 25 miles. easy track. The crossings of the Derruhun and Chowjehun streams, just above their point of junction to form the Kharsun river were extremely difficult, they being Kharsun river. a ^. jq ie ^hne swollen mountain torrents. It should be noted that the winter of 1883-84 was a sevei*e one and of long duration; consequently the melting of the snow occurred later this year than is generally the case; ordinarily the streams in June would be more readily forded and the passes be less blocked by snow. A considerable number of oaks of a small size grow in this district. The valley pastures had already assumed the brown and yellow tints of maturity. The Iliyats cut and stack no fodder; they prefer to migrate to greener and more elevated pastures (see pages 351, 303, 304). The Kuhgelhu chiefs laughed at the idea of this read being supposed to he a caravan route and assured me that no caravan ever took it. Local traders use it. Y24 From Khurra to Sadat, elevation 7,200 feet, is a difficult march of 18 miles, 9th June. Sadat, 18 several ridges separated by deep valleys having to be miles. crossed; that of the Gardan-i-dast-i-Chalkellah, at an elevation of 9,300 feet and that of the steep and rocky Gardan-i-Chashma- duzun at 9,570 feet. The descent to Sadat is difficult and steep for some distance. The country here may he descrihed to consist of a mass of huge hills (average elevation 9,000 feet to 10,000 feet) generally covered with a low tree growth, and separated by deep valleys (general elevation 7,500 feet to 8,500 feet) ; the length of the hills is too great to allow of their being turned ; con sequently the paths lead directly over them by short and steep zig-zags. If labour were available, zig-zags of moderate gradients could he constructed across them without difficulty and the existing staircases of rock turned into practicable roads. The grazing in the valleys is fairly good; there is but little cultivation anywhere. A few years since this road was quite impassable to Europeans. During the Governorship of the Ihtisham-ul-Daulat, 1877-78, robbery and crime were sternly repressed with the best results {see pages 302, 307). At Sadat the vine grows luxuriantly; walnut and mulberry trees flourish. There are the remains here of a considerable town, buildings of stone with arched roofs, &amp;e.

The de scent into the Tang-i-Nalf is the most difficult descent (of about 700 feet) met with in the passage of these hills, being a winding rocky staircase, untouched by man, and formed in the steep hill side, in the course of ages, by the passage of the flocks of the Iliyats. The passage of the Tan^-i-Nalf over immense boulders, takes 1^ hours to accomplish. Safar-i-ab or Saporio is composed of a few stone huts standing on a small cultivated plateau, at the head of Tang-i-Nali, formed by the openino* out of the valley. This portion of the hills is known as the “garmsir,” being occupied only during the winter months; the districts already passed over are known as the “ Sarhadd or “ Sard-Sir,” and are occupied between the months of June and September. Safario was unoccupied; between it and the coast, burnt up pastures and uncultivated grounds only were met with. The mass of the hills may now be said to be traversed {see details, Part IF, page 302). From Safar-i-ab to Deh-dasht, elevated 2,850 feet and distant 23 miles, the track is good except through the Tang-i-Na-Khiida 23 \ 1 iSes Une ' I)eh ‘ d^ ’ sht, ( the Adless pass), a pass which well deserves its name, hemg 200 feet to 300 feet wide and shut in on either side by perpendicular cliffs 200 feet to 300 feet high.

On the northern side of the Tang-i-Na-Khnda is an ancient cemetery of some size and pretensions. Between Ardal and Deh-dasht about half a dozen Lurs were collected nuditlv by the guide to guard the camp. &amp; J25 4 To the Rumarun river, near the entrance of the Tekab pass, elevatoin 1,400 feet, where forage, uncut hay, is abundant, is 20 miles. 12th June.

In many places the road is revetted; by cutting these places away the pass could be readily made impracticable. My delight on emerging from the hills was great.

If their formation is to be explained by natural causes, it is sufficient to say that they are due to contraction on cooling, or that the abrasive action of water continued through countless ages, has formed them. The last hypothe sis it’is considered, quite fails to account for their formation, and the former explanation is equally unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it leaves unsettled the reason for the contraction, and the resulting crack in the hills, taking place at the head of a valley, just in the place required to allow the passage of a stream through it, and with the level of its bed just on a level with that of the valley {see pages 71, 360). » Behbahan is surrounded by a dilapidated mud wall; its bazar is or no size ; within its walls are numerous houses of mud, surrounded Bekbakan. ^ mu d walls; the usual cry of the stagnation of trade was heard here as elsewhere.

Road Isfahan to Behbahdn (297 to 327 miles). By the route taken via Deh-i-Kurd and Ardal, Behbahan is distant 367 miles or 17 stao-es from Isfahan. By taking the direct road to Chigakhor, two stages or 40 miles are saved. If the still more direct road via Kumesheh from Isfahan is taken to Felat, the total distance is only 297 miles. The great difficulties of the road he between Bassaki and the toot of the hills (Tekab pass), a distance of 173 miles or 8 Road difficulties.26 stages. The river passes or tangs and the staircases of rock are next to im passable to mule artillery in their present state; but not altogether so; for a test load, a mule laden with yek-dans, each 3' long x 2' deep x 1' 9' broad, weight 3 maunds = 240 lbs., was brought safely through with but one serious mishap {see page 143). A considerable amount of blasting will be required to form them into good mule paths, although but little may be necessary to enable a heavily laden mule to pass without accident. The road Bushire to Shiraz is in places equally bad, indeed worse. Persian mules can walk up and down staircases of rock and through bouldery ravines better than most men can. Taken as a whole, therefore, the road is by no means an impracticable military one to an army supplied with good mule carriage. Provided with sappers and pioneers, its difficulties would soon cease to exist {see page 169). With reference to the difficulty of passing through a ‘'tang,” it may be as well to recall first impressions, and this is my excuse for recording here the following entries from my note book :— On passing through the Tang-i-Nali— “A more desolate bit of rock scenery never seen; most awful bed of boulders ever heard of;” and on leaving the Tang-i-Na-Khuda “emerge out of the worst inferno I hope to enter.” Stocqueler traversed this road from Behbahan to Isfahan in June 1831. Leaving Behbahan on the 11th June he reached Isfahan in 12 marches (one of 18 hours' duration). His descriptions of localities are very inaccurate, and of scenery exaggerated. References to perilous ascents and awful acclivities are misleading. He was robbed on the Isfahan side of Simarun and writes : “ We reached Isfahan weary, sick, impoverished ; in short, we had little left us but our souls.” The difficulties of the journey had engendered fever and this no doubt fully accounts for his loose statements. ^ The distance to Isfahan from Bushire via, Shiraz is 456 miles of 24 stages vrd Kazran and 538 miles via Firuzabad, the most practicable route. From Behbahan to Shiraz is 171 miles of 7 stages. From Behbahan to Ahwaz is 121 miles of 6 stages. Behbahan is 2 marches or 48 miles distant from Bandar-Dilam {see page 309 ). 1 he importance of the line Behbahan-Isfahan, with good branch roads from Behbahan to both Shustar and Shiraz, from a military point of view, is consid erable {seepart III). Its importance is however quite eclipsed by that of Muhammerah, Shustar, Isfahan, 6/ miles longer, 187 of which can be accomplished by river. Commercially much- cannot be expected of it as yet • the Zil-ul-Sultan has perhaps been perstladed that the Kuhgehlu have greatly improved it, but the mere fact of no caravan taking it should tell him the truth if he were desirous of knowing-it. Bushire and Shiraz are of too o-reat an importance to allow of trade taking any other road not affordin'* crater advantages than shortness; it must be secure as well; provisions must be obtainable and the difficulties connected with traversing the passes, staircases of rock and streams must be lessened {seepage 23and Strategical and Commercial Consideration*, Part III, page 170). 1 he tribes of Kuhgehlu are closely allied to the Bakhtiari and occupy the Kuhgehlu tribes. mountains to their south, i.e., from the Kuh-i-Dina to . Behbahan and the plain of Ram Hormuz. The moun tains here rise to a greater height than to the westward, and the enclosed valleys are less rich in pasture than those within the Bakhtiari hills. These tribes now£7 t’arely clash with their neighbours, the Bakhtian, Mamasenui and Kashkai* Intermarriage between the various Khans is frequent and tends to friendly relations between them, and I received from the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris letters to his kinsmen amongst both the Kuhgehlu and Kashkai (see details, Behbahda to Bandar-Dildm and Bnshire (148 miles). Bandar-Dilam was reached by the following stages— Dillia balia11 to Bftndar ' 14th June, Zeitiin river, three miles beyond Chham or Zeitun; 24 miles (the Ab-i-Hindiyan is difficult to ford), elevation 760 feet. 15th June, Bandar-Dilam, 24 miles. At Behbahan.is a serai; between it and Bushire there are none and the party bivouacked daily. The river of Zeitun flows in a fertile valley between deep belts of low undulating hills, a perfect sea of irregular mounds, in traversing which the road winds very much. Several of the ascents and descents are difficult, steep, and rocky. Water ig Scarce to the north of the river; to its south it cannot be obtained till the belt of hills is crossed and the village of Daube reached, a march of 5 hours’ duration from the Zeitun. At Bandar-Dilam boats, up to 1U0 tons’ burden, lie in a creek running inland to the west of the village. To utilize it the construction of a pier along it is necessary (see details, Part IF). Some of the creeks must be forded with care. Having conducted the party to the banks of the Khor Geseir, the guide, ignorant of the ford, retired to pray. I endeavoured to find it, but quickly repented, for my horse gradually sinking deeper and deeper rolled over. With extreme difficulty we floundered out. Undressing I left everything I wore on the banks. I bad no further need of them; the journey was over, and they lay there a warning to others. The river at Kal’a-Sirhan (Rud-i-llulla) is forded with difficulty. The road traverses the mud flat between the hills and the sea; it is a mere track; after rain it would be impassable (see Report No. 4(a)). To the w r est of KaTa-i-Haidar a deep belt of broken ground, the skirts of the Kuh-i-Bang, is crossed by good tracks. The plain is cultivated in places and grows excellent crops of wheat, barley, melons, &amp;c. It is capable of being much more extensively cultivated; the, grazing is poor during the summer months and did not promise to be good at the best of times.

Rs. 1,421 19£ 16* 3,000 22 2,500 Survey work executed. Traverses of the routes followed were made by pocket compass. These checked by astronomical observations taken with the sextant and artificial horizon have enabled the routes to be laid down with very fair accuracy. A map on a scale of 8 inches to 1 mile accompanies the report. It is compiled from all available sources, the compilers route being shown in red. The heights have been worked out from observations taken with a large sized aneroid barometer (tested before use in the Mathematical Instrument Department, Calcutta) and worked out relatively to the height of the mercurial barometer, Bushire, which is assumed to be 25 feet above the sea level. Unfor tunately the barometer was spoilt one day's march from Bushire on the occa sion of my being engulphed in a swamp. The readings of the aneroid barometer taken at Basra before commencing the journey showed it to read 0--2' higher than the average of the Bushire standard barometer for the five years 1878—82 [see page 59), and its readings along the coast plain, on the conclusion of the journey, showed it to read 0--2' lower than did the Bushire barometer for the average of the same five years. The heights given have been worked out with regard to these two corrections. As the distances from Bushire at which the observations were made were great, the use of the average of 5 years probably gives better results than the actual heights of the barometer; these height are given in Appendix D. The barometer at noon at Basra, 20th March, read SO^T'; temperature 70° ; and on the 21st, 30-25'. All other observations are given in Part IV.

The difficulty of transliterating sounds uttered by a Turki speaking race is considerable in consequence of the very many euphonic variations of both consonants and vowels. “ The guiding principle of the Turki variation appears to be this, that the mouth having assumed a certain shape for the pronunciation of certain sounds, it is difficult in the compass of the same word to shift the position of the organs; or, when a hard breathing is coming out, to change it suddenly into a soft breathing, and vice versa.” Thus gutturals k, g, gh tend to bring any guttural contained in an affix into the same class, dentals, dentals and liquids, liquids. Thus is it that g and k, d and t, f and p, b and p, &amp;c., and the vowels generally, are interchangeable (S/taw). In transliterating Persian words, the rules laid down by the Government of India have been as far as possible observed.PART 11. Detailed Account of South-West Persia. *PERSIAN GULF. T HE Northorn Coast of the Gulf, as the Persian side may be termed, pre sents in its whole extent, from the delta of the Euphrates to the Mekran coast, a series of rugged, precipitous mountain ranges, one behind the other, running nearly parallel to the coast, and to each other. The mountain ranges increase in height as they recede from the sea, and General character— In- no kind of vegetation can be seen on their bare and habitants and harbours. deeply furrowed sides. Being visible at great distances, they form excellent landmarks. The small seaport towns are almost exclusively inhabited by Arabs, who originally came from the opposite coast, and formed settlements there, owing to intestine commotions in their own country, or to a spirit of enterprise. At the larger places an admixture of Persians is found ; but the Persian is not a maritime nation, all the boats sailing from Persian ports being manned by Arabs. The coast is generally uninviting and barren, except near the villages, where date groves are generally found, with a small amount of cultivation. There are no rivers, as we understand the word; and water is generally only found in wells or reservoirs of rain water. There are no good harbours for large ships, though there are plenty of roadsteads or anchorages sheltered against one or other of the prevailing winds, though not against all. Winds. —The navigation of the gulf in a sailing ship requires great attention. The winds, as in most inland seas, are very uncertain, and blow occasionally with great force down the gulf; and in winter also in the opposite direction. They set in without much warning. The prevailing wind in the gulf is undoubtedly the north-wester, called by the natives shamdl.\ This wind blows down the gulf, changing its direction with the trend of the coast. During a shamdl, if after rain, the air may be clear and sky cloudless, but at times the air is so loaded with dust from the Mesopotamian deserts that a dense mist is the result. During the winter months, south-easters, called by the natives shurgi or loss, alternate with the north-westers ; and, like the shamdls, follow to a certain extent the direction of the coast; they only blow strong from Decem ber to April. The koss is generally accompanied by thick gloomy weather with hard squalls, and often much rain ; sometimes thunder and lightning. The atmos phere is moist, and the barometer generally low. Squalls. —At the change of the seasons in autumn, very severe squalls may be expected, called by the Arabs leheymah ; it does not appear that the direction of these squalls is fixed. * * Persian Gulf Pilot. t The Arabs say there are 40 days of this wind, as also 40 days’ extreme heat, and 40 days’ extreme cold. Forty has always been a favourite indefinite number with the Easterns.36 The period assigned to them by the Arabs is from the 15th of October to the 5th November, during which time no native vessels put to sea until either the squall is over, or 'until the 5th November is past, if no bad weather happens before that date. If they do not occur before the 5th of November, the Arabs consider that none will happen after that date, until the ordinary bad weather of the winter sets in. Weather .—The climate of the Persian Gulf is one of the most trying imaginable, though perhaps, on the whole, not unhealthy for Europeans. The intense heat of the summer is aggravated by the humidity of the atmos phere, and the dust raised by every wind ; nor are there rains or clouds at this season, as in India, to temper the excessive heat. The Arab coast is hotter and less healthy than the Persian, and the southern end of the gulf hotter than the northern. In the winter the winds are cold and cutting, although the temperature is more suited to Europeans; but it appears to be less healthy than the hot season. During June and the first half of July, the heat at the northern end of the gulf is moderated by the almost constant shamdl (the air during these months is generally loaded with dust), but from that time to the end cf August it is most intense, and with a southerly wind almost Insupportable, from the increase of moisture in the air. In the month of August, the ther mometer has been known to rise on shore to lot)* F. in the sun.* In the shade on boardship its range is small, from 90* to 93° at 4 a.m. to 96* or 98° in the afternoon at Abu-shahr. At Basfduh it is a little higher. In the Shatt-al-Arab the thermometer is stated by Loftus to have risen to 121° in the shade. The intense heat of the nights renders the weather more distressing. September is but little cooler than August. The nights, however, are less oppressive, particularly towards the end. The heat of these months is necessary for the'maturing of the date crop. October, though still hot, is by compari son quite endurable. Towards the end the squalls, which generally occur, reduce the temperature considerably. November is generally a beautiful month—fine weather, with often wonderfully clear atmosphere; temperature pleasant. December is often a fine cool month, similar to the last, unless the bad weather sets in, which it seldom does before the middle of this month. It more frequently comes on at the end of this, or the beginning of the next month, and occasionally does not set in till near the end of January. January and February are cold and boisterous months. Gales of wind prevail with rain, and what is termed by seamen “ bad weather.” The mini mum of temperature occurs in the first half of February. March is an agree able month as to temperature, and the weather generallv fine and clear, the winds variable. The natives consider the bad weather over in the beginning of this month for the south end of the gulf. In the northern part of the gulf, a gale often occurs about the equinox, but intervals of variable winds and fine weather are frequent (though some bad weather still occurs). April is a pleasant month, getting hot towards the end. The weather is generally fine, with moderate shamdls now and then. In the northern part of the gulf a very heavy shamdl has occurred in this month; also heavy squalls, or a gale from the eastward. Variable winds, however, prevail, with sometimes rain. * * The blackened bulb in vacuo rises to upwards of 170°.— C.E.K.37 Tliore is seldom any bad weather after the middle of this month.

For tempera!nre and climate of Bushire, see Revised Gazetteer of Persia, pages 59 to 68. The rainfall is small and variable; it may average 8 inches, or from that to 20, in the year. This is at Bu-shahr, where alone it has been approximately registered. On the Arab coast it is probably less. With rare exceptions, it falls chiefly in the autumn and winter months. On the coast of the southern bay of the gulf the rain is said to fall very rarely (see Bushire, Revised Gazetteer of Persia, page 5S). Few .—The dews are very heavy, particularly in the summer months, when the sails appear in the morning as if a heavy shower had fallen. Fogs .— Dense fogs, wetting everything like rain, occur at times near the coast, and always in the morning. They only last a few hours. Barometer .—The range of the barometer is not great compared with more northern latitudes, although greater than in the Indian Ocean. In winter the utmost variation is (hfi inches, the height ranging between 29-70' and 30-80'; average about SOTO'. In summer there is a remarkable permanent depression of the mercurv. It begins to fall about the beginning of May, and during June, July, nnd August stands, with little variation, at about 29-55', varying between 29-4 5' and 29'65'. By the end of September it again stands at its average at about 30 UO'.38 ‘isTwamino- ao-ain S t°bad weather in the gulf, the worst weather sometimes 'occurring without any change in the mercury column or the change not occurring till the gale has set in (see Bushire, Revised Gazetteer of Persia, W J^.—The rise and fall at springs varies in different parts between 6 and 10 feet, while at neaps it is only from 1 foot to 4 feet. At neaps the rise above low-water springs is from 3 to 7 feet The day and night tides are very unequal. In the winter the night, and in the summer the day tide, the superior, while the second tide in either case is quite insignificant. The rise and fall is effected by the winds, as is the general level of the sea, to the extent of a foot or more, the shamdl lowering the general level ot the o-ulf and the south-easter raising it; so that in the first case the tides will appear not to rise so high and to fall lower than usual, and the reverse in the second c£ise« The highest tides occur about the August springs, which may be attri buted to Uie heaping up (during June, July, and August) of the water of the Arabian sea on its northern coast, due to the south-west monsoon. The variation of the compass is westerly, and ranges from to 2° (1870). It is decreasing slowly (s^/w'/e 174). . x . ]{ ea lth. It is in the cold weather that fevers are most prevalent; the so-called gulf fever of the remittent type is very dangerous, and convalescence is only possible by leaving the gulf. Cholera* is generally present in some part or other of the gulf, and carries off great numbers of the natives; its ravages are said to be worst at Bahrein. Small-pox is also common. A small encampment at a short distance from the Arab town is probably a kind of lazaretto for this disease, and should be avoided by parties landing. Ophthalmia is common among the natives. Europeans also suffer (see pages 61 to 68). The hot weather does not seem to be absolutely unhealthy; the men suffer, it is true, from aggravated prickly heat, boils, &amp;c.; but, provided they are kept out of the sun and ventilation attended to, there will be probably little serious sickness. As little work should be done aloft by day as possible. Awn ings are a sine qua non, and the men should sleep on deck (the dew does not appear to have an injurious effect). Nothing but absolute necessity can justify the exposure of the men to the sun, and white hats should be insisted on. For those who may consider these remarks extravagant, the case or H.M.S. L iverpool may be recorded. Through unacquaintance with the danger, this ship lost three lieutenants and twenty to thirty men in one day just as she entered the gulf on her passage up to Abu-shahr in August 1821 from the heat onlv. The thermometer ranged from 10d° to 106°.t * This is not correct/ Cholera is rare, never endemic.— C.H.Tt. f 1 never felt anything so oppressive in Baghdad as this heavy damp heat, which is quite stifling. The thermometer only 95°, bnt it is 91° all night. Sleep is out of the question. The hot sulphurous blasts of a Baghdad saum are quite refreshing compared with it. I never had the prickly heat so bad before. I am one wound all over my body. It is not the heat I have so much to complain of as the steam and closeness, which is very relaxing and irritating. My poor Baghdadis look like ghosts, and even they are covered with prickly heat. “ Sir,” said Yusuf A &lt;r a to-day, “ we can live in fire, but not in a Turkish bath.” He said this upon my remarking that it was quite delightful to hear the Baghdadis at last obliged to complain of heat {Rich).30 SOUTH-WEST PERSIA. ArABISTAN, KntJZISTAN, Luristan. General description. The two great geographical subdivisions of South-West Persia are strongly distinctive—(i) that bordering the coast, an alluvial plain; General descirption. '| 3e y 0n( l it, mountains, passable transversely by but two caravan roads (the road over the Kuh-i-Dina, No. 4, is not used by caravans'), and longitudinally by but one. The peoples of I hose two great subdivisions are as distinct as the lands they inhabit—the one chiefly Arab, the other Lur [see pages 48, 84). (i) The alluvial plain includes the plains of Shustar, Dizful, Hawfzah, Behbahan, the country of the Ka'b and Rani-Lam Arabs and the Mamasenni, an area of about 28,000 square miles. (ii) The mountainous district is known as Luristau or the country of the Lurs. Taking the total area of Persia to equal 600,000 square miles and its population to be 8,000,000, its average population per square mile is 13. Of the 8,000,000* of its inhabitants, 2,000,000 are inhabitants of cities, 2,000,000 . . are Iliyats or wandering tribes, and 4,000,000 are in- P ‘ habitants of villages and country districts. Thus it may be assumed that nowhere in South-West Persia will the population exceed 10 per square mile when a district of 10,000 to 20,000 consideration. This estimate seems fairly accurate, sparsely populated country in the civilized world. Thus estimated, there will be— (1) Of Feili and other Lurs, west of the Dizful river... (2) Of Bakhtiari Lurs, east of the Dizful river (3) Of Kiihgehlu Lurs Total Lurs square miles is under Persia being the most ... 210,000 ... 170,000 ... 41,000 ... 421,000 The area of country occupied by (1) is reckoned to be 21,000 square miles; that by (2) to be 17,000 square miles; and that by (3) to be 4,100 square miles. Of other nomads south of the line Burujfrd-Isfahan, the calculation is as below :— (4) Ka’b Aeabs — Territory, 6,200 square miles ... (5) Mixed Arabs and Persians— Plain of Pam Hormuz — Territory, 2,700 square miles ... ... (6) The Garmsir, Pehbahdn to Pushire (coast plain)— Territory, 5,600 square miles (7) Plains of Shustar, Dizful, and llawizdh — Territory, 11,000 square miles ... ... (8) Mamasseni — Territory, 1,900 square miles ... ... ... 19,000 Inhabitants. 62,000 27,000 56,000 110,000 Total (chiefly Arabs) ... 274,000 Thus the total population of South- West Persia (south of the line Buru- jfrd-Isfahan) considered in this report may be assumed to be 700,000. * Of these, 7,000,000 are Shiya’s, 700,000 Sunnis and other Muhammadan sects; Parsis, 8,000 j Jews, 19,000; Armenians, 43,000; Nestoriaus and Chaldeans, 23,000; &amp;c.40' I The alluvial plain of South-West Persia. General description. From Muhammerah, on the right bank of the Hafar canal, near its June- tion with the Shatt-al-Arab, to Bushire, a distance of Coast liue and offing. over miles, the coast line lies low, and is fronted by a shallow offing, the 3 fathom line being at an average distance of 2 4 to 3 miles from it: its harbours or “ bandai^ ^ scarcely deserve the name, baking advantage of a creek or a river which has worked for itself a way through the sandy offing to low water, often a distance of from 1 to 2 miles, the native craft of the o-ulf will run up them at high tides, and there lie aground till the next favourable tide enables them to leave. The immediate shore line often consists of a belt of low sand hills 10' to 15' high and 100 to 300 yards deep. The principal craft that trade from these ports beyond the gulf are called baghalahs; they are from 100 to 400 tons, and are Baghalabs. clumsily rigged with a huge main sail and latteen sail and small latteen “ mizen^ They cannot tack and require a large crew. They do not go to sea in the south-west monsoon. Though clumsy in appearance above water, with a high poop, they have line bottoms and sail well, especially in light winds {Persian Gulf Pilot). The boats in use on the Karun, and on the rivers generally, for cargo pur poses combine the advantages of sails and oars; they Boat8 ' are of various sizes, from 5 tons to 70 tons burden, and are of one uniform shape, having a broad raking bow, much of which is out of water, and a full and heavy stern, with a kind of open poop, raised for the accommodation of the captain and his crew, the rest of the space being left for the cargo. In general, the rig is the same, consisting of one mast, nearly amidships, leaning very much forward, and spreading an immense latteen sail, which extends from stem to stern. The ordinary size of such a boat is 90' long and 20' wide; the draft of water is 7' 3 # , and the vessel carries about 70 tons {Chesney). The boats used on the rivers contiguous to the Kariin (Euphrates, &amp;e.) resemble a half moon in shape; their ribs and flanks are roughly nailed to gether, and the outside coated with bitumen ; they have no keel; the rudder is a clumsy contrivance of spars of large size; with one mast carrying a large latteen sail, they can tack against the current. Ballams or beilams, in general use on the Karun, are 15' to 20' long, 3' ■wide, flat bottomed &gt; they draw G # of water; provided wdth a huge latteen sail, they fly down stream. The chief harbours between Bushire and Muham- merah are :— Harbours. Khor Ru-hillah.—Navigated by boats of small burden for some miles to the village of the same name ; it is shallow at the entrance {see page 313). Khor Geseir.—A large creek, frequented by large boats {see page 313). Bandar High.—A small creek, inside which boats lie aground (see page 312). Genawah {see page 311). —Near it is Khor Khalil, a tidal creek or watercourse {see page 312Y Khor Sini, Khor Abd, Khor Lulatain.—All small creeks, which can be safely approached to within a mile (see page 310). Dilam (see page 300). Shah Abu-al-Shah, where is a small creek used by coasting craft. Tab river or Hindiyan river.—Entrance shallow ; boats of 20 to 30 tons navigate the river. Khor Masbur.—A large salt water inlet, receiving the waters of the Dorak river. They being all of the same nature, and no one of the small harbours hav- ing a distinct advantage over any other, for military v purposes they are of equal value, in all cases piers would41 # The gannsfr extends to some distance within the hills; see page 24. have to be constructed along the line of the deepest water to enable steam launches to lie alongside at all times of the tide, whilst the transports anchored off shore 2 to 3 miles in water suited to their draught. The shore line produces hard wood trees in small numbers. About the coast villages palm trees are occasionally numerous. Inland the country is practically treeless, and labour to construct piers, &amp;c., not procurable. At Bushire the anchorage for large shipping (inner roads) is miles Busliirc from the town, in 3 to 4 fathoms at low water, over a muddy bottom; its advantages of pier accommodation over the smaller bandars are not great; the advantages of the house accommo dation afforded by the town, and those arising from its working population, are however considerable. Deeper water in shore than that opposite the town is found 4 or 5 miles to the east of it at Kishahr, and there also are the wells of sweet water and the telegraph offices and European residences. It is high tide, full and change, at Abu-Shahr at about 7i hours; the Tides. spring* rise and fall, varies from 6' to 8', and the neaps rise from 4' to 6', their range being 2' to 4 r . In sum mer the day tides, and in winter the night tides, are much the greater. The rise and fall varies little to Muhammerah. At Basra it is 9' [Persian Gulf Pilot.) Muhammerah. ■^ or description of Muhammerah and its advantages as a port over the above roadsteads, see pages 178, 185 and Part III. The Hafar canal, on which it lies, carries 3 to 4 fathoms. The soundings H f r , in the Shatt-al-Arab, at the junction of the Hafar, are 5 to 8 fathoms. The point opposite the Hafar-Zeiu is deep-to, as are both entrance points of that canal. The Shatt-al-Arab (from its mouth to Basra, the boundary between Turkey and Persia) is aline river navigable for vessels of a draught of 18' to 1S|' beyond Basra, or to a distance of 80 miles from the bar. Its breadth near its Shatt-al-Arab. mouth averages three-quarters of a mile, with soundings of 3 to 4 fathoms at low water. The western channel, always taken, at the bar carries 12'at low water springs, the rise and fall varying from 8' to 10'; the winds influence the depth of water on the bar to a certain extent. At the west end of Dubbeh island is the shoalest part of the river, and the most difficult to navigate. There are probably not more than 16' to 18' at high water, and this only in the deepest part of the channel over this bar. Opposite the creek leading to Basra the depth mid-channel is 4 to 5 fathoms. Small vessels can navigate the river to Kurnah at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. The strength of the ebb tide in the river varies from 3 to 6 knots; that Tit j e of the flood from 2 to 4 knots, the ebb stream being about double the duration of the flood. Inland from the low sandy shore, extends to the low hills of sandstone and ♦Garmslr. conglomerate a vast level of variable width (average 35 miles), a barren mud flat for some miles, liable to be flooded by high tides and heavy rains, and beyond a plain growing cereals of various kinds, melons, &amp;c.; it is sparsely populated, its few villages being42 planted at considerable intervals apart; water is found 10 feet from the surface * it is of good quality, except for some miles to the east of the Karu [see pages 42-44). Wells are numerous in and round about the villages not situated on streams (few). It is poorly irrigated. A few trees, chiefly the date palm, grow round about the villages only; firewood is scarce. Each village com munity owns from 50 to 60 donkeys, 300 to 500 sheep, and 5 or 6 cows. The climate of this plain may be assumed not to vary to any appreciable extent from that of Abu-shahr [see pages t&gt;J to 6S). Its summer heat is tempered by no rain, and it well deserves the name of Garmsfr, given to it by the Persians. The pasturage during the hot months of the year'is burnt up, scant, and of a poor quality ; the chief food of all cattle consists of chopped straw and barley, both plentiful. The only supplies procurable from the villages in limited quantities are fowls, sheep, milk, eggs, butter, raughan (gin), barley, corn, and chopped straw. The coast district extending from Hindiyan to Bandar Itig is known as Lehruwi [see Hoad Report No. 4a, Part II ). Irrigation capabilities. A desert stretches from Bandar Dilam westward to within five or Coast plain, west of six miles of Dorak. The river Tab runs through it; its Dil&amp;tn. banks are cultivated. The vicinity of Dorak is fertile; dates and rice are grown there and along the banks of the Hafar and Shatt-al- Arab. The rice crop is harvested in August and September; other grains in April and May. The best pasturage is found inland to the north and west. If the rains have been plentiful, the plains to the east-south-east of Bandar Ma'shur are covered with grass above a horse's knees. If they have been deficient, the grass will be short and fit for sheep, but not for cattle. The sea coast plain from Muhammerah to Dilam is bountifully watered by the Karun, the Tab, the Hindiyan, the Jarrahi, &amp;c. It would be difficult to find a territory of equal extent, where fresh water, containing sufficient salt, is poured through the plain in channels so numerous and so easily manageable. Its rivers are its element of greatest commercial strength and military weakness, for by damming the exits of this water towards the sea, the Persians flooded the country and reduced the Ka'b Arabs. The Ka'b territory is by no means an easy one to traverse. The por tion adjoining the coast is impassable in the wet season, and during the subsidence of floods it would be fatal to horses and men, whether from miasma or the marsh insects. The water from wells near the coast is brackish [Pelly). The water supply of Ma'shur drawn from wells just outside its walls is brackish. Its exports are wool, wheat, barley, rice, gin, and sheep. Its imports are piece-goods and dates. Each petty bandar carries on a limited trade in the above. The low hills above referred to, originating in the Kabir-Kuh, stretch Outer range of sand- fiom the Earkhah at Kal a Bandar and the Earun at stone and eongbmer- Ahwaz in a south-east direction towards Chham, ordinarily ate ' known as Zeitun, to the sources of the Hindiyan or Zoreh river, where they amalgamate with the outer hills of the main Bakhtian and Kuhgehlu ranges stretching from KaPa Kasim, past Ab-i-Bid, Ram-Hormuz and Pashkar, to the vicinity of Abu-shahr. Between the two ranges lie the plains of Ram-Hormuz and Behbahan.43 Ram-Hormuz plain. The rivers— Karun {see piges 41, 71, 17S, 195, 193, and part III) Jarrahi {see page 47,, Hindiyan {seepage 46), break through the range. It also occurs on either side of the latter river (known locally as the Zeitun hills), and consist of a confused sea of tumbled undula tions rising to a height of 900 to 1,400 feet above sea level, and composed of clays and sandstones [see pages 307, 303, 348). Springs and streams are rare, and the water lying in the beds of the dry water courses is saline. The alluvial plains of Itam-Hormuz is fertile and occupied by various tribes of Arabs, some nomads, some settled in villages. The chief tribes are the Ali-Khaims, Ali-Bu-Kurd, Shuli, Ali-Bu-Murad, and Gurgi (see pages 332 to 334). The chief villages are Ram-Hormuz, containing 250 families; Deh Yur, the residence of the chief of the Ali-Bu-Kurd ; Kal'a Shaikh, on the banks of the Kurdistan; Sultanabad, Jaizan, Aliabad, Kherfend, and Chah Mula, a mud fort on the Kurdistan. Under a settled government the fertility of this plain is such that it is capable of becoming a vast grain Held. It also produces rice, dates, melons, &amp;c. The district pays a tribute of 14,000 tomans. Ram-Hormuz was formerly included in the Government of Pars, and was under the Chiefs of Behbahan, by whom, however, it was ceded to the Bakh- tiaris for assistance rendered against the Persians by Muhammad Taki. The latter, without success, endeavoured to settle several of his tribes in this plain. The Persian Government opposed him, and the Kuhgehlu and Arab tribes harassed the settlers. In the Garmsir villages to the eastward of Behbahan, Persian is generally spoken; to the westward, Arabic is spoken, and Persian not always understood. About the Karun as far north as Shustar, Arabic is the only spoken language, and in the villages and encampments, as a rule, Persian is not understood except by a very few. The plain of Zeitun is exceedingly fertile and well watered by the p f , Hindiyan river. It is studded with villages. This dis trict, as well as that of Ram-Hormuz, has suffered on account of Government exactions; the prosperity and improvement of both have been nipped in the bud, and they are to-day less cultivated than they were years ago, for here are the remains of villages, canals, &amp;c , &amp;c., indicating for mer prosperity and population. The plain of Behbahan resembles in character and soil that of Ram- Hormuz, which it adjoins, and that of the Garmsfr, bordering the gulf. It produces excellent crops of wheat and barley, and is well irrigated by canals drawn from the Kurdistan river. The district, together with that of Shulistan (see page 55), pays a tribute of 24 to 30,000 tomans. The plain contains the ruins of several towns, i.e., near Kai-kaus, 8 miles north-west of Behbahan ; Arrejan, 4 miles to its north. In the winter the narcissus covers it (see page 329). Besides the road to Isfahan through the Tang-i-Tekab, described as route Alternative road to No. 4, another path leads from the plain through the hills Isfahan via Tang-i-Sau- by the Tang-i-Saulek, lying 26 miles north-north-west of lek {Salak). Behbahan (seepage 329), and in the Kuhgehlu hills. The Tang resembles that described in page 306 ; a mountain stream traverses it; beyond it are bas-reliefs described by De Bode. Plain of Behbahan.

Between Ahwaz and Shahki, 26 miles on the road to Ram-Hormuz, A lies a trackless and practically waterless plain of an Ahwaz to Behbahan. ,, • , i r .•! i j 'iv • ,, alluvial soil, fertile and covered with grass in the spring, on which the Bowi Arabs encamp. After rain the passage of the plain would be most difficult. Fuel is scarce, and at Shakhi the water is brackish, and drawn from a marsh. The nomad Arabs are more or less turbulent, and the road unsafe. They till soil enough for their wants and no more; they are rich in flocks of sheep, cows, and buffaloes. Notwithstanding the bad quality of the water, the pas turage is excellent. Almost every man possesses a double-barrelled percussion fowling piece. Antelopes are numerous in the plains between the outer range of hills and the sea; also gazelles and houbara. The Gopal river, 30 miles from Ahwaz, flows down from Deh-i-Bid, a place 18 miles from Ram-Hormuz, on the direct road between it and Shustar. Its water is bitter. In December it is 30' broad and 3' deep ; the flood marks were 6' higher than its normal level. The water is rendered bitter by the sulphate of lime which impregnates the soil (gypsum). The plain beyond the river (east), broken by a series of sandhills and watered by a small stream, extends to Ram-Hormuz, 50 miles from Ahwaz. Ram-Hormuz is three stages from Shustar, i.e .— Deh-i-Bid Bani Dsiwud ... Shustar 6 farsakhs of 3‘8 miles each. 6 8 Total ... 19 Naphtha. On this road occur naphtha wells producing naptha o a fairly good quality {see Appendix, panes 78, 334, 35, and Part III, page 157 ). The authority, of the Shaikh of Ram-Hormuz extends half way to Shus tar in one direction, and almost to Behbahan in the other. To KaFa-i-Tul is two long stages. Hie passage of the plain of Ram-Hormuz between the village of tha name and the Shur river, a tributary of the Alai, is difficult after lain, whel flooded ditches and deep nee fields have in places to be crossed The streams soon run down.45 (Vo The plain to the eastward of Rustamabad is inhabited by the Kuhgehlu. Lurs, and extends to the sandstone hills, 1,180' high, overlooking the Behbahan plain; it is in parts well covered with camel thorn and konar* trees; its soil is fertile, but a settled population is required to cultivate it. The banks of the Jar rain are well wooded and picturesque (small shrubs and trees) ; it is from 4 to 5 miles broad. Several small streams run down from the hills into the river. To the eastward of Jaizoun (Jaizan) the plain gets drier and stony. The Kuhgehlu of the Agha Jeri section inhabit it. Between Jaizoun and Behbahan the Jarraln is forded at Chahar Asia, the plain being broken only by the sandstone hills already referred to. The road from Ahwaz to Behbahan is practically level. To Ram-Hormuz water is scarce and of bad quality. From Ahwaz to Rustamabad is 64 miles, and thence to Behbahan 57 miles : in all 121 miles. Eastward of Behbahan the plain extends to within a short distance of Du- Eastward of Behbahan. Gambazan in the low hills, 43 miles from Behbahan, elevation 2,480'. The plain is uninhabited and stony ; it is watered by the two arms of the Hindiyan river, the Khairabad river and the Shams-al-Arab, both fordable j the banks of the former are well grown over with willow and tamarisk. The extensive plain of Sahra-i-Lishter lies 4 miles to its east; it measures 12 miles by 4 miles, and is covered with konar* trees; at-times it affords good pasture to the Iliyats, who encamp upon it {Baring),—see pages 332 to 337. Hilly country, Du-Gambazdn to Shiraz {Baring and Wells). In the direction of Basht, distant 25 miles, the country is undulatino- the hills rising to a height of 3,350 feet. Ibex are plentiful. To the north lies the Kuh-i-Dil, elevated about 10,000 feet. Oaks are here seen, and to the east of Du-Gambazan the ruins of kanats and villages indicate a decadence from a former prosperity, due to Government exactions. Basht consists of a square fortress with high walls and reed huts outside ; elevation 2,730 feet; water is plentiful. In its broad valley the myrtle grows, and rice and carraway seeds are extensively cultivated. A Bawi Kuhgehlu chief usually resides in the village. ^ Between Basht and Talesbid, 18 miles, lies an undulating hilly country interspersed with wide plains and valleys. That in which the Chal-i-Moureh a small stream runs, is elevated 2,850 feet. It is joined by the Sar-Ab- i-Siah. Its valley is well cultivated. Talesbid, lying in a plain beyond it (ele vation 2,830 feet), is a small village of reed huts, surrounded by rice fields and occupied by the Mamasenni {see page 337). The descent over the Gazinjun range (2,780 feet), the first real obstacle to wheeled vehicles on the road from Ahwaz into the valley of the Chal-i- Moureh, is stony and difficult. The following are the stages between Talesbid and Mian Kotal by an alteruative route {see page 338) :— J Kurabad ... 3 farsakhs. Nodun ... 7 „ Kazran or to ... 6 „ f 3 stages from Shiraz ■).

The river generally runs in a deep o*or fr e receiving several affluents from the lofty range of mountains to its north j ft flows past Nurabad and Kazran [see page 33S ). Its hill sides are thinly wooded; its watershed is elevated 6,950 feet, and from it is obtained a view of the Kuh-i-Firuz. From the Pul-i-Murt (3,630 feet),a bridge over one of its affluents, 16 miles from Talesbid, a road leads to Ardekan, distant one stage. There are no villages between Talesbid and Tang-i-Rudiyan, elevated 5,250 feet, and 40 miles distant from it. Tang-i-Rudiyan is the head-quarters of the Dushman-Ziari Lurs [seepage 107). Between the watershed of the Shul river and Shiraz, a distance of 45 miles, lies a hilly country. The greatest elevation crossed, i.e., of 7,350 feet, lies to the east of the village of Shul. The descent from it is easy past KaFa Kasim to Giiyun. To the west of Shul oaks are abundant, vines grow on the hill sides, and with a settled government the district could become a rich one. The grapes of which the noted Shiraz wine is made come from the plains of Ardekan, Guyun, and Shiraz. The ascent out of the Tang-i-Rudiyan is by steep zigzags to a height of 6,000 feet. The road presents no great difficulties ; its worst stony and narrow parts occur within a distance of 80 miles from Shiraz. The total distance of Shiraz from Behbahan is 171 miles, and from Ahwaz 292 miles. This is the line that was taken by Alexander in his advance upon Persepolis [.tee pages 337 to 340). Rivers in South-West Persia. River Kdrun [see page 42). —This is the only navigable river in Persia. Zoreh or Tab or llindiydn river. —The Zoreh or river of Hindiyan is formed bv the united waters of the Ab-i-Shur and Ab-i-Shirin (also called the Khairabad river and Shams-al-Arab), which have their sources in the mountains of the Mamasenni. Their junction takes place in the vicinity of Chham; it contains a considerable body of water, and was with difficulty forded on the 14th June 1884 (see page 30S). After traversing the outer low range of sandstone hills (page 42), it falls into the gulf a few miles from Hindiyan, to which village it is navigable for vessels of small burden (20 tons) (pages 40, 307, 336). Hindiyan is a town of 300 to 400 inhabitants. It can be forded 9 miles above the town. In passing through the low hills south of Zeitun, its water becomes tainted and bitter, and is scarcely drinkable at Hindiyan. At the town its breadth is 80 yards in February, and unfordable. Ruhalla stream. —The Ruhalla or Rud-hillah stream or Shat-ban-i-Lemini rises in the vicinity of KaFa Safid, and traverses Shapur (see page 338). In the plains it is fordable only at times near the village of KaFa Sirhan. It is there a sluggish stream, 100 yards wide, 3 X 6 /r deep, with a firm sandy bottom, flowing between banks 12 feet high (see page 313).47 The Jandhi or Dordk river .—The river Jarralii, konwn to its junction j arr ^ lii with the Ab-i-Ramuz as the Kurdistan river, rising in the Kiihgehlu hills at Sadat, issues from them through the narrow gorge of Tang-i-Tekab (Tang-i-Teka) {see pages 301, 506‘), and, running along the foot of the low hills, receives its waters from numerous tributary streams flowing from them, viz., the Ab-i-Ramuz, Ab- i-Ali, Ab-i-Zard, &amp;c. On the banks of its feeders are numerous ruins of the Kayanian and Sasanian periods, i.e., at Sadat, Mai-Dawud, Abu-l-Abbas, Manjanik. iietwcen Jaizoun and Behbahan it is fordable in several places. At Chahar Asia its breadth from bank to bank is 70 yards ; its stream is in December swift, 3' deep and 45 yards wide. Its left bank is here covered with thick brushwood, tamarisk, and oleander. After receiving the Ab-i-Ram-Hormuz, the Jarrahi becomes a broad and deep stream, not at any period of the year fordable, and runs between steep and high mud-banks. It is navigable for boats of 5 tons to within 1 2 miles of Ram-Hormuz. The Ab-i-Ram-Hormuz or Alai river is forded near Ram-Hormuz with srreat o • ® difficulty after rain. Eight miles above Fellalnyah it divides into two branches—the Nahr Busi entering the gulf near Bandar MVshur, the other branch, continuing its course through the town, is eventually lost in irrigation, except a small artificial channel, the Dorak canal, which runs 83° E. 27£ miles from the Karun, which it enters 10 miles above Muhammerah. It passes through a marshy country, and can be traversed by boat in 15 hours. The river in its narrowest part above its branches is 55 yards in width and frequently 100 yards. Minor streams. — Having their sources in the Pusht-i-Kuh to the west of the Karkhah are several streams which water the plains at their foot occupied by wandering tribes of Arabs (Bani Lam Arabs). These either fall into the Tigris or lose themselves in marshes. In this plain several sites of ancient cities are to be found. *Khuzistax (Arabistan). The boundaries of Khuzistan are roughly the Bakhtiarf hills, the river Karkhah, a line drawn from Hawfzah to Muhammerah, and thence by the coast line to the Hindiyan river. From a point above Muhammerah generally to the Hindiyan river, to the north of Dilam, the inhabitants are of the Bani- ernmenr,! tantS ^ e ° V ' Ka'b Arabs, under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Arabistan, head-quarters Dizful. Under him are sub ordinate governors at Muhammerah, Fellalnyah, and Deh Mula. The fron tier village above Dilam is Shaikh-Abul-Shaikh or Shah-Abul-Shah. The Government of Behbahan adjoins that of the Ka^b Arabs to the south and west, and is under that of Ears, the head-quarters of which are at Shiraz {see 'page 311). The minor settlements to the southward of the Hindiyan to Bushire embrace a series of petty tribes, both Persian and Arab, living in their * * The ancient Susiana, so-called from the name of its capital city Susa, and the still more ancient Elam, originally peopled by Turanians and the descendants of Shem.

They are subordinate to the Government of Bushire. Of the settlements, three- fourths are probably Persian and one-fourth Arab. As a general rule the Arab circles of villages are farmed and adminis tered by their own Shaikhs, who arrange their own civil disputes, and pay a lump sum as revenue per annum. They are coming every year more under the local officers of the Shah. The Persian circle of villages or a Persian port comes directly under the local officers of the Shah. Subdivision of Khuzistdn.

Its inhabitants are composed of the Sadat, Aei, Kutu, and Saki tribes of Arabs : the principal dependent tribes are Ali Ards Sherif, llani I zar, Bani Hardan, Sadir, and Salamat. The Aralis came first as conquerors, afterwards as settlers and traders. The Wall could with difficulty muster 5,000 badly armed followers. The tribes are impoverished.

The territory of the Ka’b (Chab) Arabs extends from the Karun river the right bank of which river they occupy to Wais, to the Hindiyan river on the east, and irom the gulf^to the plain of Ram-Ilormuz on the north in which direction they camp on the northern slopes of the low hills stretching from Ahwaz to the Zmtun valley. They occupy the left bank of the ShatC a -Arab to Jiasra, and a small strip along its further bank. The divisions of the tribe are those of— Ali Bd Nasib Idbis (18 subdivisions) ...

The total force • Bayard, 1846.50 that the tribes could muster in 1840 amounted to 12,700 men, of whom 2,700 were horsemen, 3,000 were foot soldiers armed with muskets and match locks, and 5,700 foot soldiers armed with spears and swords. They have now in their possession a larger number of firearms. Muhammerah and Fellahiyah or Dorak are their two most important towns; the latter occupies a good defensive position by reason of the numerous canals in its vicinity. Tobacco, rice, and barley are grown along the banks of the Jarrahi. Dates grow in the lower parts of the province, and Produce. where water is plentiful [see page 42). The preceding details are extracted chiefly from Layard’s account in Yol. XVI of the Journals of the Royal Geographical Society. Colonel Telly reports in 1874 :— “ I subjoin a statement of the principal Chab (Ka*b) tribes, but the numbers of their fighting men are, I think, overstated :—” Alboogbesh ...

In 1831 the Chief of the Ka'b Arabs could muster at Fellahiyah 6,000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry, independently of the Iliyats. His revenue amounted to 60,000 tomans (£12,000) {Stocque/ar )others estimate his revenue to be £50,000, and the force that he can muster to be 5,000 horse and 20,000 foot, a rabble armed with flint-locks, match-locks, lances, &amp;c.

Of the 72 tribes which composed the Ka'b nation, some have emigrated to Turkish territory; others have died out, and of others mere fragments remain. The Ka'b tribes which are still influential are the Muhaisin of Muhammerah and the Khanafirah, Asakirah, Mujaddim, and Al-Bu-Ghubaish of Felahiyah. In the Hawizah district many of the tribes are Muntafik, which have crossed the Tigris to escape the exactions of the Muntafik Shaikhs. When the Mula of Hawizah is strong they pay him tribute, and when he is weak they decline to do so. The subdivisions or branches of tribes are innumerable. Only those which have quite separated from the parent stem and become independent of it appear in this list.54 See estimate, page 39. The above estimate gives for the territories [4), (5), (7) a population of 204,550 assuming the adult males to constitute \th of the whole. The estimate, page 39, is 199,000, a very close approxima tion. This latter table should be received in preference to the two preceding ones. They are a tall, warlike race; over the Persian tunic and drawers they throw the national abba. They wear turbans, and each Dress and arms, &amp;c. man carries a long flint-lock musket slung over his shoulder. They are said to be brave, but cruel. Patties between Arab tribes are reported to be bloodless. A battle in which 10,000 men were arrayed on each side, and which lasted for 4 days, resulted in five killed and wounded. Their tents [see page 9S) are larger than those of the Lur Iliyats, and are supported on poles, in parallel rows, lessening in height from the centre to the sides. In 1639 the KaO) Arabs were Turkish subjects, who pastured their buffaloes near Kurnah, and lived in the marshes of the Tigris, paying tribute to Bussorah (Busra) ; others came from the Arabian coast of the Gulf. A season of drought compelled them to migrate to lands watered by the Kanin. In 1750 Shaikh Selman, a popular leader of the tribe, taking advantage of troublous times in Persia and Turkey, and aided by the \\ all of Hawizah, established himself as far as the llindiyan river, and northward alon O* the Karun to Band-i-Kir, expelling the Persian tribe of Afshar, its original occu pants. From Turkey he obtained the island of Abadan, in the Shatt-al-Arab the territory of Dowasir, on tbe right bank of that river, and on the left bank a tract of country in the neighbourhood of the Hafar canal, including the present town of Muhammerah. Little by little the tribe succumbed to Persian influence. In 1812 the Montafik Arabs ousted them from their possessions on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. To resist their further inroads, Muhammerah was built by Shaikh Mardao of the Muhaisin branch (father of Ilajji Jabir Khan), lii 1837 the Waif of Baghdad plundered Muhammerah. Its Chief, Hajji Jabir, the son of the Ka'b Shaikh by a slave-mother, threw himself into the hands of the Persians, who took advantage of the feud between him and the legitimate Shaikhs of the KaT to occupy Muham merah with Persian troops. In a greater or less degree the Persian authority has since been recognised. J Hajji Jabir Khan, Nusrut-ul-Mulk, Governor of Muhammerah, died in History aud Govern- October 1881, and was succeeded by his younger and mcnt - , , . abler son Shaikh Mizal. His elder brother Muhammad resides, by order, at Ishtahan [see page 2). On the death of Shaikh Jabir. the Persian xva o territory. It now will seek occasion or find a pretext to establish a supervision over the tribe. In 1883 the Persians endeavoured to establish a custom-house under Muhammerah. Fortunately the endeavour failed. Persian custom-house established in an Arab poi t than its commerce at once falls off on account of exactions. Such was said not to be the case if the Arabs manage their own customs. more detailed55 Muhamtnerali possesses considerable advantages as a trading mart, and places in Persian hands a strategical position of the highest value in the event of war with Turkey. &gt; If held by a foreign power, that power will enjoy considerable political and commercial advantages (see Purl III). The town and its dependent districts are now governed by Shaikh Mizal (see page 5), who appears to have fairly well established his authority. He pays an annual revenue of 45,000 tomans (Administration Report, 18b3-84). Shaikh Rahmah is now Governor of Felalhyah and Mir Abdulla of Deh Mula. The former pays a revenue of 15,000 tomans and the latter of 12,000 tomans. Previously to May'1878, the FelaMvah section of the Ka’b Arabs was governed by Shaikh Sufti-bin-Imbadir, their hereditary Chief. On his mur der by his cousin he was succeeded by Shaikh Rahmah. At the same time the districts of Deh-ul-Mula, Jarrahi, Hindiyan, and Bandar Ma’shur were detached from the Felahiyah jurisdiction and placed under Amir Abdullah of Deh-Mula. The Ka’b Arabs are Shiya’ Muhammadans, and are partly Persianised both in costume and habits. They intermarry with Per- Rehgion. sians. Pure Arabs will not intermarry with them. Their women enjoy greater freedom than either the Persians or Turks; they do not veil. The Arabs of Khuzistan are intelligent, but are regarded by the Persians as dull fellows. The Arabs regard the Persians as i.iracter at oya y. cowar( j|y vogues, who have got the better of them by intrigue, and believe that, could they combine, their expulsion would be an easv matter. Internal feuds and jealousies render a combination impossible. Between the lower classes of Arabs and Persians the hostile feeling is undis guised (Robert son). The Montafik Arabs, above referred to, are a small tribe chiefly of import ance on account of the number of prosperous Fellah Munta ra s. tribes protected by it. The tribe are Sunnis, but the subordinate tribes mostly Shiyas. The Shaikh of the Montaiik has 30,000 fighting Arabs at his command (Plowden). Those of the tribe camping in Hawizah territory pay tribute to its ruler when he is strong enough to exact it. The Mamasenni. The country inhabited by the Mamasenni is known as Shulistan; to the east it is bounded by the dependencies of Pars ; to the south by Kazran ; to the west by the Kuhgehlu; to the north by the Ardekan chain (Kashkai pastures). The Mamasenni or Muhammad Husaini are divided into several tribes, numbering some 3,000 or 4,000 families. Their principal stronghold, Kal a Saf'id, a “ diz ” of size, elevated 1,500 feet above the level, and said to be 4 miles in circumference and well supplied with water, is now of no importance, the tribe being well under subjection; they are now an agricultural and pastural people, through whose territory it is fairly safe to pass (see page56 33S). Ferhad Mirza, recently Governor of Fars, brought these formerly unruly people into subjection. The roads from Belibahan to Bushire and Shiraz can be traversed without an escort, if the traveller be provided with letters from the Governors of Bushire or Shiraz, or from the Prince governing the province of Fars, whose head-quarters are at Isfahan (see png? 335). The Mamasenni have always been friendly to the British and accustomed to look to them for assistance and protection against the Persian Government. They are a fine race, with features very like the ancient Persian type. They may be assumed to be able to put 1,500 men into the field. They are Lurs, and speak the Lur dialect with local modifications. They are supposed to have migrated originally from Seistan (see paqe 339). Their subdivisions are (Baring 1882) — E ust am Bekshi Bowi Fahlioun Bushmen Ziari Allem Saleh Chief Allah Kfili Khan. „ Shavff Khan. „ Muhammed Ali Khan. „ Mirza Hath. „ Murad Kuli Khan. „ Ali Khan (son of Khusru Khan). In addition, there are the following Khans, viz .,— Baba Khan, Jan Muhammad Khan, Nasfr Khan, Ashraf Khan and Gunji Khan, son of Sharif Khan.— C.E.li. The Rustami are the most powerful, and inhabit the valley of Sar-ab-i- Siah and the adjacent hills ; also Diyar in the plains of Behram. They are reckoned to be good horsemen. The Bekeshi occupy the fort of Nurabad in the Sahra-i-Behram and Tang-i-Shapur. The Bushmen Ziari occupy Shapur and Chenoshejan in Ardekan. The Bowi encamp near Kaha Safid and in the upper valley of Ab-Shur. They are taxed to the extent of 7,000 to 8,000 tomans per annum (De Boie.) Every Mamasenni village has in it a loop-holed defensive tower. Many of them consist simply of reed huts round about the tower. The Nasir-ul-Mulk now administers the Government of Belibahan and Mamasenni districts. Ali Kathir Arabs, &amp;c. The Ali Kathir Arabs encamp along the Bizfiil river above Band-i-Kfr, and on the plain between the Dizful and Kanin; and the Anafigahs, on the right bank of the Kanin, below that place. The former possess many villages and small mud forts, and are extensively engaged in agricultural pursuits. They are divided into 19 or 20 tribes, each under its own chief, the chief of whom represents the tribe as a whole. They number 14,000 to 15,000 families, and can furnish a good body of irregular Arab cavalry. The original stock is said to have come from Nedj (see page 201). The Anafigah tribe is a dependency of Shustar; they are Iliyats, and Anafigali Arabs. possess large flocks of sheep and camels. Their head Shaikh can muster both horse and foot. Both have lost their Arab propensities, and are now given to agriculture and a quiet pastoral life. Ban! Lam Arabs. The plains to the south of the Kabir Kuh are occupied by the Bam Lam Arabs, although formerly the plain of Masen Au between Badrai and the57 Kahn* Kuli belonged to the Feili Lurs. This tribe now seldom descends into the plains. They encamp as far south as Kut-el-Amara and Amara on the left bank of the Tigris. They are a strong tribe of evil repute ; they pay tribute to the Ottoman empire, but have intimate relations with the Feili Lurs, and, being Shiyas, their religious sympathies are aw^'-Turkish. The low undulations to the south-west of the plain of Masen Au and Kongitau-Au are considered as the boundaries between the Persian and Tur kish dominions. The Kabir Kuh is here frequently called the Hamrm Kuh. [For other local names of this range, see page 204.)

Climate of Ahwdz and of the Sh/istar and Bizful districts. In the spring of the year, assumed to extend to the 15th April, the weather is agreeably pleasant and much cooler than at Muhammerah and along the coast of the gulf. During the first week in April the morning temperature, 9 a.m., will not often exceed, 60°, and the shade temperature during the mid-day 75°. The nights are cold ; no ill effects are experienced from exposure to the sun's rays during the day time, provided that the head be well covered; the clothing required is the same as that worn during an English spring. Such being the character of the spring months of the year, the autumnal Autumn months may be assumed to resemble them somewhat in character and salubrity. Towards the beginning of December, the climate is trying on account of the great difference of tempera ture between the cold of the night and morning and the heat of the mid-day. The worst months of the year for heat are June, July, and August. The heavy rains fall during the early spring of the year, but from all accounts are not excessive, and probably do not exceed 15 inches during the year. They cease at the end of February, commencing in December {seefurther on). Sir H. Rawlinson mentions that the maximum heat of an up-stair room in Dizful was in the end of May, i. e., about a fortnight after the great heat had fairly set in, l;10°, and that he, as well as the rest of the inhabitants, then retired during the day to the sardabs or subterranean caverns excavated in the solid rock 30' to 40' below the surface [see pages 5, 199, 349). The hot wind or simoon does not probably equal in intensity that of India. Emerging from these caverns at sunset, they sleep on the roof. In June, under a double awning, the thermometer rises to 113.° From Shustar and Dizful a cool climate can be reached in two days, for within the hills are the summer quarters of the Iliyats, where cattle and sheep in abundance, and other provisions in small quantities, can be obtained [see page 355). Hutting troops along the banks of the Karun during the summer months can be carried out without danger ; surrounding the huts with camel thorn screens, to be kept constantly wet, so as to produce evaporation, the temperature can be reduced to quite a bearable point, i.e., 80 w to 90 p {see page 162).

The temperature of the Kanin is in summer 20° lower than the Euphrates. With reference to the healthiness and climate of Muhammerah see Revised Gazetteer of Persia. Along the Shatt-al-Arab from Basra to Muhammerah cool weather is experienced from November till April. The summer heat is great. The most unhealthy season extends from June to October, when malignant fevers are prevalent at Basra and the river villages. Towards the end of March the day shade temperature averages 70°; the nights are cold. The alluvial deltas of all rivers are more or less unhealthy.

Kinneir states that the climate of Khuzistan is healthy, and that of Sluistar plain. Shustar is so remarkable for its salubrity as to be con sidered a sanitarium. In summer the excessive heat lasts from 9 a.m. till 9 p.m., when the air is refreshed by a gentle breeze from the north-west. The winters are mild and the springs temperate and delightful. The ground is so rich that it is only ploughed a span in depth ; two crops are yielded in the year, and there is no fruit or grain known in Persia that will not thrive in Khuzistan. The land is principally cultivated by irrigation [see page 168). Encamped near Muhammerah in the summer of 1850, Loftus found the Mubammerah. locality anything but a healthy one; continued sickness pervaded the camps, and a general state of debility ensued from the stomach refusing to retain food after a meal [see Precis of Persian Campaign, 1856-57 ; Revised Gazetteer of Persia). The heat, he found, was intense, day and night, in June, rising to 124° F. in the shade. The heat was of a moist and trying nature. Mosquitoes were most virulent. At Ahwaz the saliferous alluvium of the lower plains is quitted, their Geology. place being taken by tertiary gravels and sandstones. Tamarisk, which grows plentifully along the Karun to its south, now becomes scarce, and the Kuhnar bush more abundant {see p ig° 19-1 and Appendix C, Geology).59 Monthly Average of Barometer during five years at Bushire./ 01 Medical Report on Bushirefor the year ending 31st March 1873. Bushire. tlie cliieE seaport town of Southern Persia, lies in the 29th parallel of north latitude, and is situated at the Situation. extremity of a peninsula twelve miles in length by from four to five in breadth on the north-east shore of the Persian Gulf. It is not I should say, elevated more than 20 feet above sea level, the centre o the town being about the lowest, and the Armenian quarter, in the north corner, the highest ground. The houses are flat roofed Houses. an( ] doeely packed together, and generally not less than two stories in height; the ground floor being solely for winter residence, and the upper apartments for use in the hot months of the summer and autumn Sanitary* arrangements in Bushire are of the most primitive and meagre description, the consequence of which is a deplorable Sanitation. wan ^ 0 f cleanliness in the general aspect of the town, whilst here, there, and everywhere are sources of effluvia which make their presence painfully known to more senses than one. Hie sewage is com monly conveyed from the necessary by means of a rude conduit into a pit dug in the street, which is seldom provided with proper means of outflow, and which is sometimes emptied, but not infrequently allowed to main full, and another dug in the vicinity. The process cd emptying is most obnoxious to passers by, for the streets being, as a rule. Streets. not more than seven or eight feet wide, the pent-up focal exhalations meet the olfactories in a most concentrated form. Streets here are at best mere lanes, so that the town, though it atone time contained twenty thousand inhabitants, does not cover an area of more than half a mile square. There are, I think, twelve different places of sepulchre within the walls of the town, and some of the graves are not more than Burial grounds. three feet in depth. Moreover, each burial place has several stone and lime encasements built on the surface, wherein are stored dead bodies for eventual transmission to Karbala. The walls of these recep tacles are very slim, and now and then observed to be holed through either by the vicissitudes of the weather or by accident, the corpses in very rickety coffins thus becoming exposed. X)urine the cholera epidemic, which raged here some two years ago, mtra. mural interment was for a time prohibited by the local authorities; mt t le prohibition subsequently became a mere farce, and now there is not the eas obstacle thrown in the way of those who revert to the old custom.

This reservoir is open only during the months of April and May, which period is coincident with the annual advent of guinea- worm; but I shall have to animadvert on this subject further on when treating of the most prevalent diseases. The water so supplied is used by the natives for all purposes. But the chief supply of potable water is carried in mussacks from two wells—the one at Bahmani, the other at Bagh-i-Mula, respectively six and five miles distant from the town. This water, especially that of Bahmani, is only very slightly, if at all, brackish, but contains, nevertheless, abundance of chlorides, exhibiting a dense white cloud, and the addition of even a weak solution of silver nitrate. Still T believe it would come under the head of usable water in Dr Parkes' classification, as its chlorides are chiefly sodic; and though it perhaps causes griping, and more or less intestinal disturbance during the first month of its use, it is not in the long run, so far as I am aware, detrimental to health. The surface soil of the Bushire Peninsula generally is loose and sandy, and, when well irrigated, not unproductive; but inter- Vicmity. vening between the city and the cultivated land is a low, level, moist, barren, leafless plain, a mere trifle above sea-level on the one side, and daily more or less inundated on the other. The surface of this space, which covers an area of about one square mile, presents here and there, during wet weather, large shallow pools of water, which usually take a few days' drought to evaporate, and the plain is then so muddy almost to its entire extent as to render locomotion on foot dilficult and unpleasant, and even on horseback disagreeable. The first two hundred yards or so of this plain from the city gate being near the barracks is the place generally resorted to as a necessary by the Per sian troops, and is consequently pretty well covered with ordure, with which is occasionally interspersed the dead bodies of donkeys, mules, horses, dogs, and others animals that may have recently paid the debt of nature. But 1 shall again refer to this circumstance in considering the causes to which I ascribe the prevalence of the sickness that invariably heads the list of diseases met with at the Bushire Residency Dispensary [see foot note ante). The subsoil for the first 20 feet or so is composed of very porous con- glomerate rock, a prominent ingredient of which is a 01 an su 801 ‘ quantity of small shells. Beneath this is found a thick bed of firm moist clay. This soil, both subsoil and surface, is, by the way, exactly what is found in districts where malarious fever is endemic, and may be the chief factor in generating the poison that seems always to lurk about Bushire. Strange it would at first appear, yet it is no less true, that Bushire, in spite „ ... A , of the abovementioned unfavourable circumstances, can- ea 11 y si ua ei . no t be called very unhealthy. An explanation of this seems to be found in its singularly good natural position, and the fact of the prevailing wind coming from the north-west, whence, crossing the gulf, it strikes right on the city situated almost insularly at the extremity of a peninsula ; and the breeze thus enriched with ozone, tempered by moisture, and deprived by oxidation of most, if not all, of the deleterious organic sub stances, vegetable and animal, which it may have previously contained, neu tralizes in turn, rendering comparatively innocuous the otherwise injurious eman ations from the innumerable dust-bins, sewage-pits, and cess-pools of Bushire. Sickness, chiefly malarious fever, is increased during the south, and parti cularly during the south-east winds, doubtless owing to the malaria being63 carried from what is called the Mashila, a marsh upwards of three miles in length, which connects the peninsula with the country proper. The rain-fall of an average year is about nine inches (? see page 58), and falls almost exclusively during two separate periods. Ram-fall. rp| ie October, November, December, and January ; and the second or latter rain in the end of February, March, and the begin ning of April. Probably January is the rainiest month of the year, whilst in June, July, and August it is rare to have even a few drops. The cloudy days more than double those on which rain falls. Although during the colder months the hills in the distance are almost always covered with snow, only a few showers have been seen to fall in Bushire in the recollection of the oldest inhabitants, and even a hail-shower does not occur more than once in the course of a year. The maximum temperature seldom exceeds 95° Fahr., in the shade, and the minimum rarely falls below 47°. In town the 'Wind, weather and we t bulb thermometer often registers within four de- tunpera me. grees of the dry, so great is the relative humidity of the atmosphere. Six miles inland the atmosphere is less moist, and to most people more agreeable than in town. July and August are the hottest months of the year, and December, January, and February the coldest; the hottest period being from the 1st to the 24th of August, and the coldest the month beginning on or about the middle of January. The diurnal range of temperature seems greatest in October and least in July and August. April, on the whole, represents the mean temperature for the year more closely than any other month. During the night in summer and autumn electrical phenomena are com mon, shooting stars being sometimes witnessed singularly vivid and strik ing, and during the same period mild and very transient shocks of earthquake are also occasionally experienced. The month of March is about the beginning of the transition from cold to hot weather, but the heat is still so moderate as hardly to necessitate the use of a ^wn-topee even when riding out in the open plain at mid-day. Dur ing the month of April the weather is very agreeable, especially aboard ship in the gulf. But in the first half of May a few hot calm days occur, wdiile on or about the 25th of this month what is called in local phrase the hurra shumdl begins to blow, and from this date onward till about the 12th of July a fresh north-west breeze is kept up with very little intermission. Then there is a lull for a few days, and the chota shumdl commences, and lasts for ten days or more. The remainder of July, August, and the first week of September is the period of greatest heat and discomfort. Now and again throughout the year the shumdl blows with increased intensity, bringing with it a large quantity of finely divided dust, causing much convenience to the inhabitants, and generally increasing the list of ophthalmic cases. A strong south-east wind, for the same reason, we find equally productive of ocular lesions. About the 9th of September a very remarkable change takes place in the weather. The sky becomes suddenly overcast, and the horizon blurred and brought apparently very near. Shortly afterwards come a few gusts of wind, each time increasing in force. Then there is a slight but noticeable lull. Meanwhile a small roundish dark cloud is seen in the Dust storms. distance gradually approaching and seemingly increasing in size. In a few minutes this cloud shrouds and obscures everything in64 the direction from which it comes, and a few seconds more the observer finds himself in the midst of a hurricane of wind charged with very finely divided dust, which insinuates itself at every little chink in door and window, covering books, paper, &amp;c., and, in short, rendering everything most disagree able to touch. This lasts from twenty minutes to two hours or more, and is followed by a few drops or a shower of rain. It may be repeated twice or three times in the course of a day, or only occur once. From this may be dated the commencement of the cold weather. In the course of a few hours the temperature is reduced from six to ten degrees, and the atmosphere rendered clear and fresh, the lowering of the tem perature having considerably diminished evaporation from the ground, which formerly kept” up a haze. The glare also is most appreciably and agreeably modified. But the nocturnal thermometric difference is still more marked; for, while during the remainder of September and up to the middle of Octo ber the heat at mid-day is yet considerable, the nights are cool and refresh inhabitants. ing. The inhabitants of Bushire, like Persians in general, area fine, tall, muscu lar race. Formerly they were more Arab than Persian, and the customs of the people, as well as the patois used colloquially, can be explained by this circumstance, though at present the Persian element largely predominates. The male population, singularly enough, have generally a stronger relative claim to being considered hand some than the female. But I understand this is not the case in Persia pro per, where the latter are said fully to deserve, as regards complexion, face, and figure, the praises so lavishly bestowed on their ancestors by the poets Hafiz and Sadi. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants. The Shiya' form of Islamism is the prevailing and almost sole religion of the inhabitants of Bushire, there being only a very Kehgion. small number of Armenians and Muhammadans of the Suni sect in the place. To the Shiya* tenets the Persians adhere with enthu siastic bigotry, and in some parts of the country with an unwilling tolerance of any other form of religion. In their more recent wars the Persians have not distinguished themselves as soldiers, but this, it is believed, is more due to want of proper organizing skill and to ignorance of the art of war on the part of the leaders than either to deficiency in patriotism or lack of personal courage in the men; those who have travelled much through Per sia being always ready to testify to the individual daring and bravery, both of their attendants, and those by whom they have been attacked on the road. The people of Bushire are keen of intellect, shrewd in business, in man ner graceful, in intercourse with others and among themselves pleasing and polite, but at the same time very unreliable, lax in morals, and ungrateful. As regards the latter quali ties, however, it would appear that misrule, prolonged and aggravated, has had much to do with the degradation of the people; for we know, if history can be relied upon, that meanness, gross immorality, and ingratitude did not always characterize the inhabitants of Iran [see page 100). Prior to my assuming charge of the medical department of the British Re sidency in Bushire, the dispensary belonging to that establishment was only open once, and occasionaly twice a week, and sometimes closed by order of the Residentfor three months in succession,—as,for instance, Prevalent diseases. during an epidemic, or when, from political or other Courao-e. Character.05 9 motives, tlie whole, or nearly so, of the Residency staff happened to be removed from town. Hardly any particulars of value were, under these circumstance?, recorded. The medicines, or whatever treatment was deemed advisable, was administered to each patient on examination, and no memoranda of cases kept; so that I have not been, until very recently, in a position to speak with any degree of confidence on the nature and probable causes of the diseases most prevalent in the place, or the relative frequency of their occurrence. The only affection always prevalent in Bushire is fever of the intermittent type, which stands far ahead of other diseases in the Intermittent fever. number of admissions on our sick list, and there is no period of the year when this is not the case. During the months of April and May of the year under consideration a malignant malarious fever* raged both in town and M.ilanous fe\er. country with grave fatality. It assumed the bilious remittent type, but the remissions were so slight that without careful observ ation the disease might be mistaken for ardent continued fever. The symp toms were so severe as to prevent the sufferers from coming to the dispensary, death frequently following four days from the commencement of the attack. In the worst cases the symptoms were increased by the appearance of a pinkish rash all over the body, accompanied generally by congestion of the lungs, cough, and intense muscular pain. As regards treatment, attention to the bowels, calming the nervous excitement by administering the sedatives most indicated by the symptoms, and the copious exhibition of quinine was the plan found most serviceable. The chief sequelae of this disease were hepatitis and perihepatitis; but these affections were seldom serious, convalescence with a keen appetite follow ing rapidly on the subsidence of the high temperature. Whether this malignant fever was due to the presence of a concentrated form of malarial poison in the atmosphere at the time, or to the less resistance offered to the operation of the ordinary proportion of this virus by tbe reduc ed and prostrate bodily condition of the people from starvation, consequent on the existence of famine in the land for the two previous years, it would be difficult to decide. Possibly, and indeed probably, it was the result of a combination of both circumstances. For the then over-crowded and more than ordinarily dirty condition of the town, caused by the flocking in of the famishing inhabitants of the surrounding country, would certainly intensify the virulence of any contamination afloat in the atmosphere. Moreover, the fever was most prevalent and fatal among the weak and emaciated, while the strong and well-to-do either escaped altogether or suffered slightly when attacked. The ordinary intermittent fever of Bushire is never serious, though a few paroxysms coming on year after year, with every little change in the temperature, and almost every time the wind is southerly, have the effect of inducing a pathological condition of the liver and spleen ; enlargement of the latter being rather common among the inhabitants, not excepting those who are of tender years. A peculiarity of the Bushire intermittent fever is the great amount of discomfort often experienced by those who suffer from it while an actual * The malarial poison is of a cumulative nature. Fresh arrivals at Bushire escape fever during their first year’s residence. Once it is accumulated in the system, the proximate causes of an attack of fever are—(1) exposure to draughts, wet chills, differences of temperature; (2) unsuitable clothing; (3) breathing a noxious effluvia. Intermittent fever.66 paroxysm of fever is not apparent. The symptoms which are thus seen co-existent with a subfebrilc state are pallor, if not yellowness of skin and conjunctiva, nausea, loss of appetite, severe headache, lassitude, nervous irri tability, pain over the whole body, high-colored urine, with copious deposit, and not unfrequently slight cough, all of which disappear quickly by the use of a few doses of quinine. . . T i. v This prevalence of a mild type of malarious fever is due, I believe, to the operation of the balance of malarial virus left after the pure north-west breeze has exerted its benign influence in the neutralization of the quantity of poison engendered by the action of heat on the organic matter on and in the surface of the plain immediately beyond the walls of the city. Of course this balance is increased during southerly winds; but fortunately these do not We find the greatest prevalence of this sickness in the months of March and April before the hot weather, and October and November at the begin ning of the cold. This is, as might be expected, the greatest diurnal thermo metric range occurring at these periods. ^ I imagine the coincidence of an increase of intermittents with the greatest diurnal range of temperature to be brought about as follows. Wherever malarial poison exists, every one in the vicinity must inhale more or less, and are affected with fever or not just as the individual is starving with cold or hunger, or well fed and properly clothed, and in a relative degree. But when the temperature is for some time subject only to an ordinary and re gular variation, the skin and lungs (especially the former), by virtue of their excretory function, are enabled to throw off nearly, if not all, the poison. When, however, a marked thermometric subsidence takes place, the cutane ous muscles are forced to contract, closing the orifices of the sudoriparous glands, the exit of the poison from the body thus becoming suppressed, necessitating an effort on the part of nature to get rid of it. This effort takes the shape of a paroxysm of fever, and the increased transpiration consequent thereon seems to be the medium of the expulsion of the poison. The enlarged spleens which results from repeated attacks of this fever I have treated with strong mercurial inunction in accordance with the practice and teaching of Dr. Maclean of Netley, but not hitherto, for some reason or other, with the success I had been led to anticipate as regards the reduction of the enlargement. Of eye diseases,* there have been upwards of three hundred in attendance. Conjunctivities heads the list, and calls for no remark. Eye diseases. except that I have found snipping out a minute portion of the injected conjunctiva a speedy means of arresting and causing a rapid resolution of the inflammation. Opacities of the cornea have been rather numerous. About one-half of this class required no operative interference. Of the remainder 50 per cent, or thereabout were beyond benefit from the making of an artificial pupil owing to the extent of the opacity. Of the rest, twenty-two underwent the operation for artificial pupil, a satisfactory result following each, with the exception of one, the case of an old pauper, where, from the debility of the patient, a haze surrounded the resultant cicatrix of the wound made by the entrance of the keratome at the sclero-corneal junction. # Ophthalmia is very prevalent in Shustar and Dizful. Causes of eye diseases are—(1) want of cleanliness; (2) insufficient protection from the sun’s rays; (3) contagion; (4) overcrowding; (5) duststorma (see page 38).67 Notwithstanding the frequency of eye complaints in this place, cataract is not common ; one only was removed. This was a case of capsular cataract in a girl, sixteen years of age, who had had the affection from childhood. I withdrew altogether the opaque screen from one eye and made an opening in the opaque lens capsule of the other with a needle; but although recovery was uninterruptedly satisfactory, hardly any vision resulted, the deeper seated structures of both eyes being in a pathological condition. The number of cases of ulcer in the return does not represent the one- t fifth of those who suffered at the time in Bushire from ^ lt0rs ' this complaint. The only treatment demanded was the use of some simple local application and nourishing food, debility being in nine cases out of ten the predisposing cause. The return of syphilis does not show more than an ordinary prevalence of that disease, of cases shown of rheumatism, dyspepsia, and bronchitis is, Syphilis. The number Various. Guinea-worm. I imagine, a good deal exaggerated from error in diag nosis, and can be traced to those periods when I have been absent on duty elsewhere. I fancy not a few of these cases might with more accuracy have been entered as fever. Although a very small attendance from dracunculus is shown (as the people know how to manage the egress of the parasite B themselves, and do not think it necessary to visit the dispensary except when the symptoms are very severe), yet guinea-worm is very prevalent amongst Persians and Indians. The parasite makes its exit in spring, and this period corresponds with that when the water of the tank already alluded to is available to the community. Europeans here do not use the water of this tank for any purpose, and guinea-worm is very rare among them ; except at the period named, the egress of the worm is almost unknown. These circum stances I consider corroborative of Dr. Aitken’s surmise that the impregnated lilariated female enters the body through the sudoroparous pores into the sub cutaneous tissue, and there imbeds itself, gradually becoming larger by the development of its uterine contents; and when the young filaria are fit for an independent existence (which takes a period of one year), the parent parasite by its weight gravitates to the lower extremities or some other pendent part (if the body, according to where it may be situated, and there breaks the skin, rarely escaping entire. The small number of cases of diarrhoea and dysentery* is very striking in Diarrhoea and dysen- a place where the circumstances favourable to the origin tery. and spread of these affections are apparently so obvious. But, as I have already observed, these conditions are rendered comparatively harmless by other counteracting circumstances. In the treatment of dysen tery I have invariably found large doses of ipecacuanha administered under proper precautions produce an effect that might almost be called magical. Scorbutus is not at all common in Bushire, and deserves notice only from the fact that 1 have found a few instances of it where Scorbutus. |.j le 0 f .j.] ie su ff erers ^ so f ar as j could learn, contained a sufficiency both of fresh vegetables and every other ordinary ingredient. Bushire does not afford ample scope for the study of dermatology, the chief skin affection amongst its inhabitants being that caused by the intra- cutaneous peregrinations of the acarus scabei. Are most prevalent during the summer and early autumn months.68 Surgical operations (simply from want of accommodation) have been few, and with three or four exceptions comparatively unimportant. Lithotomy was performed once, and lithotrity once, success following each operation. This was the more gratifying to me seeing I had never previously performed either. The stone extracted was of uric acid composition and enormously large, the size being three inches by two-half and by two, and weighed a little over five ounces. Lyrnes amputation of the foot was performed once, and the patient made an excellent recovery, the resulting stump being well cushioned, and the cica trix altogether free from the line of pressure. The general features of the hilly country between Karmanshah and Shiraz, by Lurs known as the Feili, Bakhtiari, Kuhgehlu, and Mamasenni, may be described in a few words. A lofty chain of mountains running south-east forms a kind of nucleus. Their summits are frequently within the range of perpetual snow. They are interspersed with fertile valleys, which are well watered, and tribes. In them are found the sources of those important rivers, the Karun, Karkhah, the river of Dizful, the Jarrahi or Kurdistan river, the Zoreh, &amp;c. To the east and west of these, and at a considerable elevation above the Elevated valley a„d ^a, are found highly fertile valleys and spacious plains. Mal-Amir, Till, KaFa-Reza, Saimarrah, &amp;c. These valleys and plains are either watered by rivers and streams, or owe their fertility to the accumula tion of winter torrents, which, rushing down from the mountains and finding no outlet, form a lake or reservoir, which lasts till the middle of the summer. Their soil is extremely rich, producing corn and barley, and forming excellent pasture lands for sheep and cattle. Those to the west of the mountains are the winter encamping grounds of the Lur Iliyats. To the south and westward of them there occurs a range of hills varying from 2,000 to 5,000 feet in height, bounding the gulf plains, running parallel Ihey contain but few springs of fresh water, and abound with pools of naptha oi petroleum, bitumen, and sulphureous or brackish water, and frequently, as at the naptha springs near Ram-Hormuz, have a burnt and volcanic appearance, ihe soil also is generally covered with a large deposit of saline matter.

The geological notee are given in the Appendix, pages 344 to 366.69 summits of these hills are usually tabular; their sides furrowed by innumer able torrents, which sweep down with irresistible violence during the rainy season. They are consequently precipitous, and frequently inaccessible to heavily laden-animals (see pages 42 8f 43). The country rising from the coast in a succession of tablelands, it follows that the southern and western slopes of these hills are longer than the northern and eastern. They are seldom inhabited to any considerable extent, except during the winter, when rain water accumulates in the bottoms, and the hills are then clothed with grass and flowers. The soil is favourable to the growth of corn and barley. To the south and west of the low hills are those vast plains known by the Persians as Arabistan, stretching in one almost c»ul plains. interrupted flat to the Tigris, the Shatt-al-Arab, and the sea (see pages 40, 48 ). Detailed descriptions of the inhabitants of the above hilly country, of their villages, productions, cultivation, &amp;c., are given later on. The coast plains and their inhabitants have already been described. Irak Ajami* To the north of Luristan lies Irak Ajami, on the line traversed between Hilly country north Khoramabad and Kum, a more or less mountainous prov- of Luristan. ince consisting generally of huge rounded undulations, reaching to heights of 700' to 1,000'above the general elevation of the plateau (5,800 to 6,000'). The Roswand range is an exception to this rule. Pew of the peaks are within the range of perpetual snow. In the valley the soil is often a rich clay or a shaly clay ; the chief rock met with is shale. The range extending from Khonsar to Mount Alwand is granitic; that to its south from Karmanshah, by the Shuturun-Kuh, Kuh-Zard, Kuh-Sabz, to Kuh- Dina is cretaceous. The mule tracks across the undulations present few difficulties (see Road Reports No. 1, 2, 3, and 3a). The general run of the hills is north-west and south-east. To the north of the fertile valleys described on page 14 as stretch ing between Burujud and Isfahan lies a mountainous but fertile region composed of the huge rounded undulations of shale and clay above described, and beyond them to the north lies the Roswand range (see pages 226 to 233)\ To the north of this lower and barren range are spacious and fertile valleys, bounded in their turn by other mountains of lesser altitude, and separated from each other by spurs of hills which shoot from the Roswand across the valleys. These latter, taken in succession form north-west to south-east, form the districts of Kazzos, Kamarah, and Gulpaigan; while to the north of them, beyond the third range of hills, are Malair, Chaharru, Sultanabad, Faraghan, and MahaNut (see pages 233 to 245). This'successive lowering of the moun tain chains northwards is repeated southwards between the main kernel, i.e., Shuturun Kuh, Sabz-Kuh, Kuh-i-Dina, and the Gulf.

For eight months the climate of the districts about Hamadan, Burujird, and Karmanshah is delightful. The cold of the winter months is severe and firewood is scarce. Hamadan was the favourite summer residence of the Persian monarchs [sec page* 13, IS, 22h ). The large towns of Irak are surrounded by mud walls of no thickness, „ „ . and generally in a bad state of repair, flanked at close owns, we mgs, c. i n t erva ] s . They are probably not meant for defence, as banquettes, loopholes, &amp;c., do not exist, but simply as a means of keeping out Bakhtfan raiders, who, within recent years, carried their forays thus far. In both towns and villages the streets are narrow and dirty; wood is so scarce to the south of Kum that the roof of the houses are generally domed (see pages 15, 239, 246). The houses are low and are constructed of mud; a few are built of brick or stone. Stone abounds everywhere, but is not used (see page 15). To each house is attached a small courtyard surrounded by a blank wall. A few of the better class of houses are two-storied with handsome recep tion-rooms, the sides of which, facing the court-yard, are closed in with large sash windows of painted glass. Their walls and ceilings are adorned with paintings, rich patterns in plaster, and are inlaid with small looking glasses. Such a house will cover considerable area, and be divided off into its pub lic and private apartments, each with its separate court-yard ornamented with jets d’eau and parterres, generally wanting in flowers. As this report only touches upon Irak Ajami in so far as it borders South- West Persia to the north, and in that the roads travelled between Burujfrd and Kum, Kum and Gulpaigan, Gulpaigan and Burujird and Isfahan traverse it, no further mention will be made of it. Luristan. Details. The great range, distant thirty miles from the Shustar-Dizful road, the hills of Luristan, attain an elevation of eight or twelve thousand feet above the Geology seaj an d bear in a general direction towards the north-west and south-east. Its rocky masses belong entirely to the cretaceous and lower tertiary series, rising in huge, elongated saddles of compact, altered limestone parallel to each other. At intervals, where the elevating force, which produced the present configuration of this region, has acted with extreme intensity, the continuity of the beds became broken, and masses of rock were left standing isolated, with precipitous escarpments, presenting retreats accessible only to its inhabitants. “ Diz ” is the name applied to natural fortresses of this kind, which frequently bear on their j) iz summits acres of rich grass, and springs of delicious * water, whither a native chief with his adherents can retire in safety in times of need, and defend their difficult passes with a hand ful of men against the whole power of the Persian Government itself. Superimposed on the harder limestone rocks are beds of a softer nature—marls, rivalling the coloured sands of our own Isle of Wight in their brilliant and variegated aspect,—vast piles of amorphous gypsum dazzling the eye with its excessive whiteness,—and successive layers of red sands alternating with gravel. These formations follow the contortions of the harder crystalline limestones, lie at extraordinary angles on the slopes of the saddles, and fill up the hot, feverish valleys between them.71 Wherever the high lands of Persia are approached from the plains of Mesopotamia, the same formidable barrier of mountains presents itself. To attain the high level of that garden of roses, which the Persian poet loves to descant on, it is necessary to climb the successive ridges by roads scarcely better than goat tracks, which regular gradation of ascents is appropri ately described by the Greek historians as ladders. All the great rivers which flow from the east into the Tigris have their sources in these mountains, crossing diagonally through the intricacies of the chain. Instead of flowing in a south-east direction along the trough which separates two parallel limestone saddles, and by this means working out its channel in the soft rocks of the gypsiferous and marly series, and rounding the extremity of the saddle where it dips under the overlying deposits, each of these rivers takes a direction at right angles to its former course, and passes direct- Taiig ly through the limestone range by means of a “ tang ” or gorge apparently formed for this express purpose. On reaching the next succeeding gypsum trough, it flows in its original south east course for a short distance, and again crosses the next chain in the same manner, until it attains the verdant plains of Assyria or Susiana. Many of these tangs expose a perpendicular section of one thousand feet and up wards, and were formed, not by the scooping process which attends river action, but by natural rents produced by the tension of the crystalline mass at the period of its elevation. Of these fissures the rivers have taken advantage and shortened their otherwise circuitous channel (Loftus), — see pages 25, 360. For a full description of the Geology of Luristan, see Appendix C, pages 344 to 366. Rivers, Of the rivers of Luristan, the most important is the Karun rising in the Zard Kiih. Fed by numerous springs and rivulets, caused K&amp;run. the melting of the snow of this elevated and moun tainous region, from its source it is a large river. Forcing its way through the Bakhtiari hills, it receives near Bors or Bars the Ab-i-Bors {Darid-i-Gandum) Ab-i-Bors or Darla-i- a broad and rapid stream itself equal in size to the Ka- Gandum. run, and having its sources in the hills to the north and north-east of the Kuh-i-Dina, and receiving as tributaries the Khersun and Malburr {see pages 293, 298), both hill torrents having 3 feet of water at their fords below the Kuh-i-Dina during the melting of the snows. The Khersun is said to be roughly bridged on the road between Pelart or ' Felat, a Bakhtiari camping ground and Khurra, a camp Khersun. q £ Kuhgehlu. If not bridged, its passage should not be attempted during the melting of the snows unless the party is provided with a kalak raft (raft of inflated sheep skins). From July to March it is generally fordable {see pages 159, 293). The Ab-i-Lurdagan, rising in the Janiki Sard-Sir, is generally fordable. Bazuft stream is crossed by the Isfahan-Shustar road about 15 miles from Hillisat; it is there 55 yards wide; altitude of its bed 2,800 feet (about) {Wells). In the autumn of the year it is fordable; in the spring it must be crossed on the road Dupulan and Shilil, where it is bridged {see page 321). The Karun at Dupulan is crossed by a solid brick bridge, of one large and one small arch (length 20 yards). The altitude of the village is 4,800 feet {Wells). Ab-i-Lurdagan. The Rudbar or Bazuft river.n Kanin. Kanin. Its affluent here from the Kuh-i-Sabz is roughly bridged by a wicker bridge. The Karun is bridged about 20 miles below God-i-Balutak ; at the latter place, altitude 2,480 feet, it can be crossed by means of kalaks or rafts of reeds and inflated goat’s skins; mules and horses swim across; goats, sheep, and donkeys are swum over in pairs, aided by a man supported by a mussuk or inflated skin. Tim river is here 40 yards wide with a s\\ ift current. Its banks show a rise of 10 feet to 12 feet during spring floods, when its breadth would be 60 yards. The river is here admirably adapted for a flying bridge (H ells),—see page 322. From the Susan valley the Karun winds amongst lofty hills, receiving many minor tributaries, mountain torrents, all fordable except after heavy rain, and enters the plain of Akflf by a narrow gorge, the hills on either side of which are crowned by the Kal’a-i- Rustum (right bank) and the Kal’a-i-Dukhtar (left bank), ruins of castles of the Sasanian epoch. The shortest road to Isfahan from Shustar leads through this gorge [see page 197). For 10 miles, a broad and tranquil stream, it traverses the plain of Akflf. Receiving as tributary the large salt stream of Baitawand, (Shur-zan-i-murda), it shortly afterwards forces its way through the Kuh-i- Fedelak, the outer range of limestone and sandstoue hills, running parallel to the main ranges [see page 327). A road has with great labour been excavated through the gorge on its left bank. The course of the river after it enters the plains of Arabistan is fully described later on [see pages 41, 185, 194). For description of the Dizful river, see pages 187, 196, 199, 201, 223, 255. Its tributaries are the Kemendab (see page 255); the Shawuror Shapur, which, rising near Kala Flajji Ali springs in the plains, after flowing parallel to the Karkhah for some miles, falls into the Dizful river, about 8 miles above Band-i-Kir. Its waters are largely drawn off for irrigation ; its bordering lands are rich and fertile, Gr;isg growing excellent cereals. In the spring, the grazing along its course is good. Its bed is deep and narrow ; it is generally fordable; current, moderate. In winter it frequently forms small marshes. The country between the rivers Dizful and Karkhah appears to have been once densely populated, and detached mounds and ruins abound. The former importance, both politically and commercially, of the country through which the river Kanin flows, as evidenced by the extensive ruins of towns and cities of the Kayanian, Sasanian, and ante-Muhammadan eras at Shustar and its vicinity, Band-i-KiT, Wais, Ahwaz, &amp;c., &amp;c., is referred to on page 73. The importance of the ruins along its course in the mountains, as indicating also that a once practicable caravan road existed between Shus tar and Ispahan, has there also been hinted at. Lurdigan is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient capital of the Bakhtiari mountains. The most important of these, however, are those of Susan, a small valley surrounded by lofty and precipitous hills. The river Karun enters and leaves it by difficult and deep gorges. The right bank of the river as it enters the valley from the north-east is strewn with ruins known by the Lurs as the Mal-i-Wiran (wealth in ruins), who preserve a tradition as to the existence of a large and celebrated city in this place. They are probably of the Sasanian Dizful river. Shawur river. from S73 epoch. Belo'.v them the valley narrows^ and paved roads of great antiquity are carried along each bank. Still descending the river, the valley again widens, and artificial mounds and ruins again occur; and on the right bank is the tomb of Daniel, held in much veneration by the Lurs (a mean mud hut). Beyond these the river is again confined between tremendous precipices. A paved road,* * * § very slippery and bad going for horses, is carried along its banks, and ruins of roughly hewn stone, called by the Lurs Masjid-i-Suleiman, occur. Below these are the ruins of a very fine bridge (the bridge of Jirzad), the arches of which must have spanned the river at an elevation of 1 Ou feet. The kiln-burnt bricks of which it was constructed resemble those found in ruins of the Kayanian era. On leaving Susan, the Karun approaches Susan Surkh-Ab and Andaku, both ancient sites. On the Talak, which falls into the river below Andaku, are the remains of a city called Boneiwar, probably of the time of the Atabegs, and inhabited, according to Lur tradition, 250 years ago. Tim remains of the Sasanian Castle at Akili, protecting the road as it enters the mountains, have already been referred to on page 72. For descriptions of the— Ab-i-Zal, see page 204.

From time immemorial the hills of Luristan have been inhabited by war like and hardy tribes of hillmen, who have set at defiance the strength of the successive ancient empires of the Old World. Yet the memorial remains of cities and cemeteries, such as those existing at Mal-Amir, Susan, Sad'at, within their intricate mountains, and at Patek, Tashun, Ahwaz, Shustar, &amp;c., in the plains at their feet, as well as at Tang-i-Saulek, Deh-dasht, &amp;c., at or near the mouths of the gorges leading into them, seem to point to the facts that not only have they been conquered, but that their hills have been the favoured residences of monarchs, and the centres of civilization and prosperity of such extent and magnitude as to lead to the conclusion that they, as well as the plains to their south, were occupied by a teeming population, producing in abundance both agriculturists and artisans. In its mountain fastnesses it is conjectured lay the strength of the Elamites, and in the plains below Abraham pastured his flocks [see page 47). Its architectural remains refer back to the age of Alexander the Great;f the Sasanianj: era; that of the Ata begs, who flourished here in the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, and who are supposed to be Salgurian§ Turkomans. Ahwaz and Shustar were then centres of commerce, merchandise being brought up to them by the Karun. Now the rout # e is closed not only to com merce, but to travellers from preventable causes. A ruined commerce and ruined cities point to the inferiority of the Persian monarchy to its enlightened predecessors. * This ancient road is now called the Jadah-i-Atabeg, see page 77. t Alexander the (.ireat ended the Kaianian dynasty, and lived in the 4th century b. c. I The Saeanidoe, a dynasty of Persian kings founded by Ardeshir (Artaxerxes), flourished between 125 and 650. Ainonsrst its kings were Shapur, Khusru, and Yezdegerd. § The Salur Turkomans are from Mangishlak, now a district of the Russian Trans-Caspian region. 1074 stone hills. Details of the hills of Luristdn (Bakhtiari and Kuhgehiu hills). To the east of Ram-Hormuz is a range of sandstone and limestone Outer range of sand- hills, abounding in gypsum * and containing the cele- id limestone brated white naptha springs and the bitumen pits of Mai- Dawud. Their western face is broken and precipi tous. To the east they gradually subside into small plains and valleys. Their forms are frequently picturesque, and they are much more serrated and irre gular than the great range. To the south of the Ab-Ala, and between that river and the plain of Behbahan, they are chiefly tabular. In these hills there are numerous ruins of villages, castles, and mountain strongholds, all of the Sasanian epoch (see page 329). Crossing them, and following the Ab-Ala, we enter the rich valley of Mai- , ,, Dawud.f Here are numerous remains of ancient villages, and the country seems to have been once thickly peo pled. Ascending the Ab-Ala, where it is closed in by the mountains of the great chain, we come to the small village of Kalat-Ala; beyond is the lofty range of Mungasht, whose face is without a particle of soil or vegetation. Cross ing the low hills to the east of Mai-Dawud, we enter the small but fertile plain of Mongenu, which is situated immediately at the foot of Mungasht. Kuh-i-Mungasht and To the north-west of Mongenu, following the course vicinity. of a small stream which falls into the Ab-i-Zard, is the plain of Bagh-i-Malik, a beautiful and fertile district, grown over with camel thorn and pistachio. Its chief produce is tobacco. To the east of the village of Bagh-i-Malik are the ruins of Manjinik. Descending the Ab-i-Zard, on either hand lies a rough waterless country, until a series of low sandhills is met and Sarasia reached. The sandhills are rough and stony with exposed slabs of slippery rock. Myrtle and tamarisk grow near the river. Where the road fords the river, its altitude is 2,UoO' (Baring). It is 20 feet wide and 3 feet deep. To the south-south-west of Mai-Dawud are the plains of Baiza and Patek, ^ . , , „ ^ , , . watered by the Alai or Teseng and the Allar or Ab-i- aizaan a t - p am. falkh, from 14 to 15 miles long and 4 to 7 miles broad. They are considered to be very productive, and grow both wheat and barley. In this direction the Janiki Bakhtfans occupy the villages of Patek and Daltin, and the Zangana family (originally a Kurdish tribe from Karmanshah, now numbering about 300 families) the reed village of Sarila (l)e Bode). Ascending the Ab-i-Zard, which passes through a narrow gorge formed by the great range, we enter the pleasant valley of Malaga!, thickly wooded with gigantic walnut trees. Beyond it is the vast barrier of Mungasht. Leaving Bagh-i-Malik to the north-west, a small ridge of hills, branchin g from the low limestone chain, is crossed to the plain of Tub The plain is of Maidan-i-Tul. a ^ uv i a ^ s °il&gt; fit for the cultivation of corn and barley % It is covered with brushwood. The kaba is built on an eminence, and is capable of holding 300 men. The walls are solidly built and provided with towers; the entrance, recessed, is well protected. The Chief of the Chahar Lang, holding jurisdiction under the Ilkhani, resides here. Bricks are burnt near the fort (Baring). Two roads lead from the plain to Shustar, one via Gurgir, the other via Kuh Khar-i-Shutur (see Revised (Jazetleer of Persia ; Routes and Appendix page 326). * Many parts cf these hills have distinct names, but the hills themselves from Behbahan to the Kanin are called by the Bakhtxarfs giyuch, and distinguished by the names of the places to which they are near, as Giyach-i-Ilamuz, Giyach-i-Mai-Uawud. f David’s wine.75 Belibalian is distant 3 long or 4&lt; short stages (see Appendix, page 39.9). It is bounded to the north and north-west by Mungasht, and by a low range of hills dividing it from Hallagan. Returning to Ram Hormuz, and starting from the naptha springs, we Maidan-i-Taulah. cross the low hills, and enter upon the plain of Taulah, which runs in almost an uninterrupted line to the vici nity of Shustar, receiving, however, various names in different districts. Small ridges frequently branch from the principal chain and form separations between different pasture grounds. To the north-west of Taulah is the small plain of Khar-i-Shutur-Zar (place of camel thorn), beyond which is Gulgfr (see page 363). Between Gulgir and Sarasia lies an undulating country, mostly dry, 'water less, and stony, watered by two marshy streams. There are no villages; fuel is scarce; the lliyats camp upon it. The village of Gulgir or Gurgir, altitude 1,430', lies in a very barren valley, with the Kuh-i-Asmari to the east; it is inhabited by Saiyids, and is the site of two Imamzadas (Baring). There is a road to Shustar via the Khar-i-Shutur-Zar (see Appmdi.r, page 396), From the ruined village of Taulah, situated at the extreme south-east point Kal’a-i-Mangasht. ^ ie Kuh-i-Asmari range, the hill fort of Mungasht bears S. 30° E., an isolated mass of rock standing out detached from the southern face of the range. The summit of the rock is scarped all round to a depth of about 150 feet, the only means of access being along a narrow and rocky shoulder to a point where the scarp lowers to about 50’, and where it is to be climbed with some difficulty. The summit measures half a mile in circumference, and contains two perennial springs. There are natural caverns upon the summit capable of holding 1,000 men. It was the stronghold of the Atabegs during the 12th, 13th, 14th centuries, and is a maiden fortress (Rawlinson). Kaba-i-Tul is distant 6 farsakhs, the road lying along the skirts of the range. The fort lies above the source of the Ab-i-Bagh-i-Malek, 4 farsakhs from Bagh i-Malek. To the east of the fort two other rivers, known after this junction as the Du-Rudiwan or Durun, have their source ; they flow into the Ram-Hormuz river (Schindler). To the east of the fort is the Rahdar-i-Darwaza-i-Gach, the ruins of a toll- gate on the old commercial route between Elymais and Central Persia (Be Bode),—see wap. Behind the fort, as seen from the toll-gate, somewhat to the right in the mountains, are Chahar Rustam and KaPa Mula, the chief fort of the Teibi Kuhgehlu (Be Bode),—see page 108. To the west of Gulgfr is the small plain of Shakar-Ab; beyond which Maidan-i-Shakar-Ab. is Lawari, a district abounding in Konar trees. This plain is divided from that of Biatawand by a low ridge of sandhills. The Lawari valley is entered from the Shustar side by the Gardan-i-Zan-i-Murda. Watered by the Shur-Ab (salt stream), it is Ifl to 17 miles long, its soil is fertile, but is not cultivated. Drinking water is scarce. The ruins of cemeteries and tanks points to the valley having been formerly inhabited (Schindler). From the summit of the mountains of Mungasht, this country has the appearance of a vast sea of broken hills. The plains are in general too small to be distinctly distinguished. Beyond this confused mass the plain of Ram- Ho rmuz appears to stretch in one uninterrupted line to the Shatt-al-Arab. There are few prospects more sublime than the view from that elevated position.4 76 The hills and plains described contain numerous ruins of villages and towns, all of the same epoch. Few of them are known by any distinct name, and they are generally too insignificant to require particular notice. The buildings which are of stone, united with the usual cement, are all low and vaulted. Between Gurgir and Shakar-Ab lies an uninteresting barren, undulating country; the water in its streams is bitter, notwithstanding which rice flourishes in places along their banks. At Tembih there is a small village and a spring of good water and a little cultivation. Between Tembih and Shakar- Ab the country is most desolate; fuel is scarce; in fact, the country is nowhere cultivated between Tembih and Shustar. The water of the Shakar-Ab is only just drinkable and tastes of naptha (Wells). Konar trees are scattered over the plain. Leaving Taulah, we cross a small ridge of sandhills, and, tra versing a narrow slip of land, reach the limestone hill of Asmari, which rises Kuh i Asmari considerably above the surrounding country and forms the outer barrier of the great chain. It is celebrated as the abode of wild animals and game, and is well wooded with the bellut. Crossing Asmari, a narrow broken valley is reached, which is usually known by the same name as the hill. This is an encamping ground for the Chahar Lang tribe of Suhuni. It is well known for the number of its ruined vallages of the Sasanian period. The Lurs pretend that there are above 300 in this valley alone. Numerous excavations in the rock also exist, and it is stated that there are sculptures and an inscription near the sulphur spring, which rises from the western extremity of Asmari (see Appendix, page 327). Beyond this valley there rises a confused mass of hills wooded with the belut. Crossing them to the north-east, we enter ITaidan-i-Hallagan . tlie P lains o£ Hallagan. An ancient paved road leads across these hills. Passing through the picturesque valley of Murda-fil, and leaving Ilallagan by a small tang or gorge, the road enters the plain of Mai Amir. The entrance to this pass was once guarded by two forts of ,, ... . the most solid construction, the remains of which now Amir# iif*-** exist. Around are numerous mounds and foundations marking the site of a town. Near Hallagan are many ruins of a later period, which are assigned by the Lurs to the Atabegs. We have here the KaPa-i- Atabegan, where one of those princes is said to have sustained a siege and to have perished, the Chashmah Atabegan, and the Pul-f-Atabegf. The whole of this country abounds with traditions of the Atabegs. The hills which separate Hallagan from Mai Amir are a continuation of a small ridge which runs parallel with the great chain to the north-east of KaFa-i-Tul (Kuh-i-Ka.nar-i- dardz.) Mal-Amir is perhaps the most remarkable spot in the whole of the Bakhtian mountains. On all sides the most precipitous mountains rise almost perpendicularly from the plain. To the east it is divided into two parts, Ruins. which are separated by a range of limestone hills branch ing out from Mungasht. Towards its eastern extremity are the ruins of a very ancient city. They consist of a large tappeh (mound) rising upon the summit of a vast irregular mountain. This appears to have been the castle, and to have been surrounded by numerous smaller mounds. Foundations of brick are exposed after rain. Near these ruins there are no stones similar to those used in the Sasanian buildings. Doubtless they are of the77 earliest. Kayanian epoch. There is a tradition that this was the site of a most ancient and extensive city, which occupied the whole of the plain, and was the residence of the monarch of the mountains ; hence its name of the Prince's house. There are many stories of subterraneous passages among the Lurs, and they have wonderful traditions respecting different mounds. Gold and silver coins are frequently found. They are of course immediately melted down and converted into ornaments. It is said that Hasan Khan, the last chief of the Chahar Lang, found a large treasure here. Sculptures occur in four distinct places in the plain—three are Kayanian, and the fourth Sasanian. The most remarkable are those in the Kill Taraun, a small tang or gorge to the north of the ruins. In the plain of Mai Amir there are several Sasanian ruins with remains of small canals and water-courses. This plain is badly irrigated. A few springs rise at the foot of the hills, and a stream of brackish water flows through the midst of the principal group of mounds. The eastern extremity of the plain in the winter and spring is converted into a marsh. Indeed, the whole after winter rains is sometimes inundated, as the torrents that rush down the mountain sides have no outlet. There is a small stream running from Mai Amir through a narrow tang to Halhlgan, but it is frequently dry. Four to six farsakhs to the north-west of Mai Amir are the remains of the city of Susan on the right bank of the Karun. The road conducting from Mai Amir traverses the chain of Gilgird by a narrow pass at the south-east corner of the city {see further on). It can he reached in one day on horseback. On the smallest disturbance in the mountains, this plain is verv difficult of access, as it lies on the frontiers of the Dinamnls. Indeed, at all times this wild and lawless tribe has rendered this part of the country very insecure. A paved high road was once carried through this plain {see page 72). A Paved road, Slnistar- caravanserai in ruins exists at the western extremity of Isfahan. Ma,l Amir. The next station, for the stations between Shustar and the eastern side of the great chain can still be traced, is at the foot of the mountains near Bors, where there are the ruins of a large caravan serai. The Lurs attribute this road to the Atabegs; it is evidently a very ancient work. Traces of this old Atabeg road are numerous. Leaving Sliustar it travers ed the Lawari valley and by Pul-i-buvlda, Manjinnik (Bagh-i-Malik), Hela- figan (Hallagan), Idedj (Mal-Armr), by the Rah-i-Sultani to KaPa Medrassa, over the old bridge near God-i-Balutak, Pul-i-Amarat, and Dupulan to Ardal; over the Sdiedjan viaduct and the Gardan-i-Zarra to Kahv-i-Rukh. From Pul-i-Amaret it appears to have branched by Armen, Lurdagan Felat, Simaran, Kari or Korl to Kumesheh, and again from Felat to Shiraz {see pages 291, 292, 295,325). The descent on to the Mai Amir plain from Deh-diz is difficult and ston}\ The plain, at first narrow, soon widens; at one end it is overgrown with camel thorn, but the centre is well cultivated with wheat and barley; rice is grown at the western extremity, where irrigation is possible; the rest of the plain is dependent on rainfall {Baring). This plain is the most western of the “Garmsin” or winter stations, and marks the change in the character of the mountains which now rise to great heights and in close proximity to each other. Conglomerates and limestones now take the place of gypsums and marls. The height of the plain is 2,930 feet. Two roads lead from the village, a group of reed huts with two Imamza- das, to Shustar; the direct road keeps to the north; the better road via78 KalVi-Tul traverses the spur separating it from Mai Amir. There is no water along the hitter till the fort is reached {see Appendix A, page 326). Crossing the range of mountains called Gilgird or Chiliwir, we find the valley of Susan already described {see page 72). From Mai Amir these mountains are traversed by three passes, all of which are most precipitous and difficult. , r. , To the east of Susan is the lofty mountain of Tauwah Doverah, where there are said to be sculptures. Rors To the east of Tauwah Doverah is Bors or Bars, which is behind the great range of Mungasht. Beturning to the plain of Itam-Hormuz, towards the western extremity, . cn , , „ which is usually called Mazehbenan, we find the conti- itawand, and Akfli. nuation ot the low lulls, winch run parallel to the great chain from Behbahan and terminate in the hills near Shustar. Here, however, they are of greater elevation than at the north-east extremity of Ram-Hormuz, and frequently rise into peaks of considerable height, such as Tal Khayyat (Tul-Keyat). These hills are only to be crossed by very difficult footpaths, scarcely practicable for horsemen. To the east of this chain we have the plain of Gurgir, in which are the ruins of an ancient Susanian city. To the north-west of Gurgir is the plain of Baitawand. The extensive plain of Baitawand contains some fresh water rivulets, and is one of the few cultivated districts in this part of the country. Through it flows the salt stream named Shurish, which falls into the Karun, 0 miles north of Shustar. In the spring the whole tract of country east of Shustar is carpeted with wild flowers and presents the most beautiful appearance that it is possible to conceive {Rawlinson). To the north-east of Baitawand is another branch of the sandstone and gypsum hills, which, leaving the principal range near Gurgir, unites with the hills of Shustar near Akili. Crossing these hills, which are usually known by the name of Turk-i-Uiz, we come to a small plain abounding with the Masj id-i- Suleiman. honar (jujube tree), in which are the ruins called Mas- jid-i-Suleiman. They consist of a lofty platform, on the summit of which are the founda tions and ruins of a building. Several broad and spacious flights of steps, built of large and roughly hewn stones, lead to them. The steps are still in good preservation, although the stones have not been united with cement. Such are the ruins of the Masjid-i-Suleiman. It is remarkable, however, that there are no remains in the province of Khuzistan, to which so many traditions attach, as those respecting this mosque of Solomon. The Bakhtfans relate the most singular stories in which the names of Solomon, Ali, Rustam, and Shapur are jumbled together in an extraordinary manner. To the south of the Masjid there are ruins, evidently Sasanian, in a valley called Kalga. Near Kalga are bitumen pits {see pages 44,334, 353). To the north of The masjid is a small valley called Ab-Garmayeh and Chashmah Ali. To the north-east the country is the most mountainous, scarcely inhabited, and extending to the river Kanin. lo the noith-north-east of Shustar is Kuh Fedelak, a continuation of Kuh-Fedelak. ^&lt;3 same low limestone range. Through these moun tains the river forces its way into the jflain, leaving the hills. To the vest of the Karun this chain abruptly ends in a limestone hill overhanging the town. Beyond it is the extensive plain between Shustar and Dizful.79 Aki'h' plain. To the north-east of Kuh Fedelak is the fertile plain of Akili, with a rich alluvial soil, about 10 miles in breadth, to the north-east of which we find the low sandstone hills, a continuation of the Turk-i-Diz. Beyond them, and at the foot of the higher limestone range, is Jungeri, where there are the ruins of a village, aud, it is said, an inscription and sculptures. Crossing the limestone range, we come to the Kanin, beyond which is a vast plain stretching to the hills of Ahvvaz and Hawizah. Due north there is a low hill forming the termination of the Kuh Fedelak. Beyond it is a plain divided from x\kiii by the Kanin, on the right bank of which we have Jallakan, about 8 miles from Shustar, and 5 from Gotwand. Two The vicinity of the ^ ie north of Gotwand, where the river issues gorge of the Kanin. from the hills, is the continuation of the great chain. Beyond* it there is an uninterrupted series of fountains to Zarda Kuh. Before entering the plain, the Kanin comes from S. 80° E. To the north of KalVRustam it is joined by a small salt stream, along the banks of which, for a short distance, runs the road to Diz Malakan (61 miles from Dizful) and Isfahan. The hills to the north-east contain many kishlaks of the Diirakis and Baidarwand Iliyats. They are usually known as the Giyach. Each portion, and indeed every valley and ravine, have a peculiar name. Proceeding north-east we descend into a narrow ravine formed by the Ziweh Ab, a small stream, frequently, however, swelling into a rapid and impassable torrent. Ascending precipitous hills, we come to Loll, a small plain (?Lali). Beyond it, in the same direction, a large stream, Sur or Shuwer-Ab (prob ably Shur, salt) falls into the Kanin. Low hills separate this river from the pleasant valley of Dara-i-Shah. To the south-east of Dara-i-Shah is the Diz of Jafer Kuli Khan or Diz-i-Malakan. Dara-i-Shah is separated from the valley of the Diz by a steep range of hills called Haftrahan-Kuh (Kuh-i-haft-Tanan) and the river Tallak. To the south of the Diz is Kuh-Sen; to the north Kuh-Odein and Maidan-i-Andaku and Kuh-Girwah. To the north of the Diz, about 3 vicinity. miles distant, are the ruins of Bonawar. To the north east we have the plain of Andaku. There is a tradition among the Lurs that a city once stood in this plain. Still continuing in a north-east direction, Kuh-i Dalian and Kuk- wo P ass through the tang or defile of Shilla (Shulbar?), i-Monar. and ascend the lofty and precipitous mountain of Dalian. Beyond them is the small and interesting plain of Shimbar. To the north-west the continuation of Kuh-Dallan is called Monar. The plain of Shimbar is nearly of a triangular shape, about 4 miles in at 'K ’Si' h' length from north to south, and about the same from east to west. It is a rich alluvial deposit, washed down from the declivities of the mountains which rise precipitously to a stupendous eight on all sides, almost perpendicularly from the plain. It can easily Ab-i Sur. Dara-i-Shah. Haftrahan-Kuh. *• The description of the country to the north of the Karun, between its gorge and Bazuft, is given as described by Sir A. Layard in Vol. XVI of the Journals of the Boyal Geographical Society, although it cannot be made to agree, in so far as geographical position is concerned, with accounts received of it from Persian information and given in Part IV, Koad Report No. 4. The general .^direction which he gives, i.e., north-east, seems to be very far out. If it had been south- south-cast or still nearer to east, the discrepancies would have been less. As far as description of localities is concerned, it may be taken as correct.80 be imagined tliat a place of this description would be soon converted into a lake or marsh, unless an outlet were formed for the water, which in winter and spring descends in torrents from the surrounding mountains. There is a tradition that Shimbar was in fact a lake, and that Filomars, aware of the security of this position and of the richness of the land, determined to cut through the mountain and drain the plain. r ihe channel was accordingly commenced at the southern extreme angle, where the moun tains suddenly subside, and are comparatively low. It is sometimes carried completely through the hill, and sometimes forms a subterraneous passage, about 20 feet in height, and almost the same in breadth, and one quarter of mile in length. The Lurs call the place the Pul-i-Nigin (the bridge of the ring), and have many traditions relating to it. To the north of Pul-i-Nigm, but on the western side of the plain, is a gorge called Tang-i-Butan, or Idols' Gorge. The idols are twelve figures in a large tablet and one in a smaller tablet, all of the Sasanian epoch. They are situated almost at the summit of a lofty mountain, and are most diflicult to reach. The plain of Shimbar is of a rich alluvial deposit. The thicket there is at present (181G) so dense that it is diflicult to pass through it. It is the abode of numerous bears and boars, and abounds with pomegranates, fig trees, and vines. The tendrils of the latter entwine round lofty trees, and during a certain season of the year the Iliyats collect a large supply of fruit. The Lurs pretend that these trees grew in a garden belonging to a city built in the plain; and as they are not found wild in the mountains, there may be some truth in the tradition. Remains of foundations and buildings are visible in several parts of the plain. They appear to be Susanian. The Lurs state that there is a long inscription near the Pul-i-Nigin. To the north of Shimbar is Lalar Kotek, a lofty mountain, where there is a village, near which a sculpture was found about two years ago. To the north-east of Lalar is Chilian. To the north and east of Chilian is the lofty and precipitous mountain of Keinu, from whence you descend into Bazuft, a well wooded plain, abounding in the ruins of Sasanian villages. Bazuft is divided Maidan-i-Bazuft. from the d i str icts of Chahar-Mahal and Isfahan by the Zarda-Kuh and Kuh-i-Rang, in which are the sources of the Karun (see Appendix A, and pages 260, 279, 280). Returning to the place where the Karun issues from the mountains into ,, , the plains, we find to the north the celebrated Diz of Goigc of t.ie karun. Mendizan (Mian-Dizan), behind which rises the lofty peak of Salenj and the peaks of Dara-Zard and Sagniyan. Between them and the plain is the hilly district of Sar-Dasht (seepage 260). Where the Karun emerges into the Shustar plain, it is 100 yards broad and unfordable. It is also unfordable at the point at which it enters the Akili plain (see page 71), and even to its source. The country, which, as a rule, is peculiarly barren of trees and brushwood Timber, &amp;c. ^ ie n0rt - 1 &gt; north-east, and north-west of the hills, and generally within the hills themselves, as well as to the south and west of them, becomes gradually more and more wooded to the south of Ardal on the line of Hilisat, where oak, ash, planes, elms, poplars, willows, hawthorn, and wild almond grow plentifully ; the timber, as a rule, is of no size; charcoal is burnt and transported for sale to the Chahar Mahal and Isfahan. No trees are planted (see page 299), and the flocks of81 11 the Iliyats destroy most of the young trees. Oaks cease to grow a few miles to the eastward of Mai Amir. In a few years the timber within the hills must be exhausted as forest operations are unknown {see pages 12, 297 ). Between Dupulan, elevated 5,030 feet, and Hilisat the mountains are Dupulan to Hi lei sat. s 5 ee P an&lt; l mugged and consist of a succession of parallel ridges (3) having a general north-west and south-east direction, spurs of the Arman and Gerah mountains; the separating valleys are deep and narrow {see page 318) : the highest ridge crossed, the water- parting, a saddle between the Gerah and Arman mountains, of an altitude of about 12,000 feet, is 7,850 feet high and the deepest valley 1,800 feet deep. The scenery is picturesque; the lofty peak of the Kuh-i-Kellar lies to the north-west; the oaks are the finest to be found in the hills, being 40 feet high Bird and animal life. and H yards in girth ; jays swarm in the oak woods, otherwise bird and animal life may be said to be non- existant; it is so rare {see pages 214, 256). Ibex and red legged partridge are found about Deh-diz. Captain Wells remarks : Hilisat to the Kanin at God Balatak. At Mai Armr (i e., nearing the plains and in the low hills) we began to see birds such as black and white kingfishers, francolin, spur winged plovers,—common Western Asian and Levantine birds, straggling as far as India; the Haft-bhai, Ctntttarhcea Huttoni, &amp;c., &amp;.C. Among the Bakhtiari hills, though birds are not plentiful, we found choughs, ravens, crows, magpies, jays, with more white in their wings than the English variety ; the &lt;m'pn and the St. Johan nis woodpeckers, nuthatches, the grey smoky-coloured thrush, larks, chaffinches, and common buntings. Ibex, markhor and bears, as well as wild sheep, are found in the mountains. Wol vcs, hyenas, foxes, jackals are also found. Bice is grown at Hilisat. Tine plane trees grow in the valley. The alti tude of its stream is 4,801) feet. The acorns are of remarkable size, some 3| inches long;, they are col lected and ground into flour. Between Hilisat and Deh-diz the mountains retain their rugged and steep character as far as the Bazuft stream, their average elevation being 6,750 feet; their separating valleys are, however, less deep. The altitude of the bed of the Bazuft stream is 3,080 feet. The descent into its bed is exceedingly rough and practicable only to mules and led Persian ho rses. Between the Bazuft stream and the crossing of the Karun (altitude 2,480 feet) the hill to the eastward of Deh-diz is from 6,000 to 7,000 feet high.— {Baring and Wells.) Thus it will be seen that the highest ranges of mountains are massed to gether between the plain or basin of Ardal on the east and that of Mai Amir on the west, a distance of 117 miles, and that the nucleus of this mass is formed by the Kuh-i-Kalah, Kuh-i-Sabz, Kuh-i-Mungasht on the east and the Kuh-i-Zerah, Kuh-i-Dinar, and Kuh-i-Gerah on the west. The continuation of the same backbone is met with on the line from Ardal to Behbahan and is formed by the Kuh-i-Dina, Kuh-i-Nil and intervening hills, a width of 50 miles on a bee-line. For a description of the mountainous country lying to the north of that just described, page 68 to page 81, i.e., north of the Kabir-Kuh, Kuh-i-haft- Tandn, Zarda-Kuh, to the high level valleys of the Biz, the Kernenddb, and the Zaindarud, bounding the main range on the north, see Part IV, Road Report No. 1 Bizful, Burujtrd ; Road Report No. 3, Ali Gudar to Imdmzddd Ishmail, and pages 14, 69, 226.82 For a description of that lying to the south and east of the line Isfahan* Shu star, see Part IV, Road Report No. 4, Isfahan to Behhahdn via Arddl, Feldt, Sadat and the Tekdb-pass, and Appendix A for further notes on the country between Isfahan and Shustar and that between Shustar and Shiraz. The geological characteristics of South-IVest Persia are fully described in Appendix C. The Iliydls of South-West Persia. The peoples inhabiting the south-west of Persia are ehieflyThyats or nomads of foreign origin, the residue of the overflowings from both the W est and^Kast ; of the Saracen conquerors and of the followers of Jengiz Khan and iaiinur {see pages 73,81). They constitute, perhaps, rather more than one-fourth of the inhabitants of Persia and are now both Shahr and Deh-Nishins (settleis in tow ns and villages) and Sahra-Nishins or Iliyats (nomads) ; the former are despised by the latter and considered by them to be degenerate and fallers-oft from the simplicity and hardihood of nomad life and recurrers to^ city protection. This sentiment is but one of envy; the life of the dehnishms would attract all did not the counterbalancing fear of exactions and increased taxation serve to force them to a mode of life less under government control. A foreign race, they are prone ,to rebellion, and if assisted from abroad would not submit to Persia. The Sahrd-Nishvns are taxed, kept dispersed, and their chiefs kept as hostages at Tehran ; they are made to contribute to the military power of the State, hut are less molested than the Shahr-Nishins ; the limits of their pastures are defined by government. Their flocks are taxed; and if they cultivate the soil, they are taxed as cultivators. A moderate fortune for an Iliyat consists in the possession of 100 sheep, 3 or4 mares, 10 asses, yielding a revenue of from 40 to 50 tomans. A rich Khan will possess ten times the above. As a rule they break up their winter camps one month after the Nau-ruz (new-year's day or spring equinox) and then travel from the Garmnr or Kishldk to the Sar-hadd or boundary of the hot and cold regions; staying there one month, they wander on to the “ laildk or Sardsir and remain there 70days. Returning to the they again stay there 1 month before returning to the Kishldk for the winter [see pages 257, 263).-—Morier. They possess a line race of dogs ; sheep constitute their chief wealth {see pages 3, 98). They arrange that the ewes shall bear about naw-ruz. They sheer twice a year. They are good raw material for troops, but difficult to discipline. The Persian irregular cavalry is chieHy recruited from the Iliyats. In- dividually they are excellent horsemen, expert in the use liy.it .naiy. of carbine, sword and lance, but they cannot act in unison {see page 136). Their oflicers are no better trained in tactical knowledge than the rank and file, and the troops, being commanded by their own local chief, family jealousies prevent a unity of feeling and aim. The cavalry horses (when a force of Iliyats is embodied) are sent out under a small guard to graze whenever possible; in quarters their food consists of chopped straw and barley; an average daily ration is 7 lbs. barley and from 14 to 20 lbs. of chopped straw.83 This is also the ration given by the charwaddm to their mules on the Hue of march. Although the Iliyats furnish to Persia the greater part of her cavalry, an arm on which she almost wholly relied in past times, llijdt Infantry. y e t their infantry has often been called into the field ; the Bakhtian infantry was renowned as the best in the kingdom [we pages 95, 98). Numbers,power, occu- The Iliyats, scattered over Persia, have been esti- pations, &amp;c. mated to number 2,700,000 {see page 39). They are brought up in ignorance of everything except tending their Hocks, weaving, and martial exercises. They are taught to despise peaceful occupations. The Shah can call upon them to furnish for service one horseman and two foot soldiers for every ten families, or about 130,000 men if a universal levee were made. The advantage of military service consists in the protection which it affords to the soldier’s family; of the pay, they see little, as it passes through the hands of the Khan, the Sultan, the Mirza, &amp;e., of the regiment to which the soldier belongs, and each appropriates a share. They are inured to danger and fatigue, and tenacious of the honour of their tribes ) hitherto they have been the prop and glory of Persia {see gyage 149). They were ubiquitous, and, hovering round about an enemy, never allowed him to rest. Jealousy of their power now causes them to be less drawn upon than formerly for recruits; many of their number are kept at Tehran as hostages for their loyal behaviour. At best such troops are but lawless and savage marauders and dangerous to a weak government. The cavalry are more highly esteemed than the infantry, simply because every man thinks it degrading to walk and dignified to ride; every Persian is a good horseman, being accustomed to bestride some animal, donkey, mule or horse from early childhood. Until good legislation shall turn them into peaceable and industrious communities, the fertile regions over which they wander must be vast pasturages adapted solely to armed shepherds and lawless freebooters {see l ol. III of Journal of the Royal Geographical Society). It has at times been the policy of the Persian government to split up Persian policy towards unruly and dangerous tribes and to transport them to the Iliyats. distant parts of the empire; thus the inhabitants of Dez-i-kurd, Deh-i-kurd, &amp;c. {seepages 295 and 96), are of Kurdish origin. Mr. Schindler considers that the proportion of souls per family among the nomads is smaller than that of residents in towns and villages. Of the Mus sulman population, 5O'5 per cent, are females and 49‘5 per cent males. The Lurs of Lur-i-Kuchak are under the jurisdiction of the Governor resid ent at Khoramabad. The Lurs of Lur-i-Buzurg are under that of the Governor of Arabistan, resident at Burujird and of that of Isfahan. The Kahgehlu and Mamasseili are under the government of Behbahan (Shiraz). The Kashkai are under that of Pars (Shiraz). All are under the Zil-ul- Sultan, residing at Isfahan. Of themselves they have no power to combine ; although the chiefs of the Lur families are closely connected together by marriage where all are equally faithless, blood relations cannot be trusted. Were combination possible, a weak despotism, such as the Government of Persia is, would be unable to demand more than a fair amount of Loyalty. revenue. Under the guidance of a powerful, trusted, and84 disinterested agency, capable of suppressing all petty jealousies, alone can combination be looked for to work out a common aim. A foreign power alone amongst Asiatics can play the part of a trusted agency. The most complete account of the Mamasseniand Kuhgehlu Lurs and of the Kashkai as well as of the other dwellers in Fars will Iliyats of Fars, &amp;c. be £ oun(1 in the w0r hs or Dr. Andrea’s. All these tribes were reduced to order by Prince Firhad Mirza by a ruthless shedding of blood (since 1S77). i r* • Besides the policy of scattering all dangerous elements and ot in triguing to keep up domestic feuds, already referred to, the only policy of the Persian*rulers is to accumulate wealth during their precarious terms of office ; notions of patriotism, of desire for the welfare of the subject, all beliefs in high aims, must be set on one side. The rule resulting from such policy is one of blood and gold. The Iliyat tribes along the border of Turkey and Persia have ever been noted for their predatory habits; the Turk being Border Iliyats. regarded by the Persian as an intruder on the limits of the ancient Persian Empire; the former, the orthodox believer in Omar and the omnipotent Allah; the latter the disciple of the martyred ’Ali,—the one a Sunni, the other a Shiya. The Feili Lurs occupy the Persian border from Dizful to Karmanshah. It is difficult to treat with the Border Iliyats diplomatically, they occupy ing Turkish territory at one time and Persian at another. The Lurs. De Bode considers that the Lurs are the kernel of the original Zend speaking race, settled in the mountains of Luristan from time immemorial, before the country was overrun by the Tatar hordes from the one side and the Arabs from the other; the Scythians or the Turani from the northern and central parts of Asia, from whence the Zend tribes themselves originally came, and the Semitic races from the south. The race came from the ancient Bactria or the modern Bokhara, Balkh, and Khunduz. The Lurs, using the name as an ethnological one, are inhabitants of the following districts, viz .,— (I) Lur-i-Kuchak and (II) Lur-i-Buzurg. (I) Lur-i-KuchaJc occupied hj the Feili Lurs. The tribes occupying the Lur-i-Kuchak are generally {see page 93) known as the Feili, and are subdivided into the Pish-Kuh (north of the Kabfr Kiih) and Pusht-i-Kuh (south of the Kabir Kuh). The Pish-Kuh are divided into 4 principal tribes—the Dilfan of 15,000 families; the Silah-silah of 10,000 families; the Bala Giriwa of 0000 families ; the ’Amalah of 2,000 families ; i.e., 33,000 families ,—see detailed tables. The total assessment is 40,000 tomans.— {Layard, 1346) {see Revised Gazetteer of Fersia). Each tribe has its chief who exercises unlimited authority over its mem bers; under him are tushmals or chiefs of families who are responsible for the collection of the revenue and for Government.'85 tlie good order and allegiance o£ those placed under their care. The chief himself accounts with the government. The members of a tribe hold their chiefs in great respect and are, as a rule, observant of his wishes. He in turn considers their welfare and their tushmaals have considerable influence in the general government. The tribe must, when the occasion demands it, arm and follow their chief in his wars. The inferior members of a tribe show their allegiance by kissing the hand of their chief. The chief will embrace men of influence. When a darbar is held men of a certain standing sit; those of inferior quality stand round about; all freely give their opinions and advice, but in a quiet, orderly and respectful manner, prefacing their remarks by “ May I be allowed to say/' &amp;c. The district has no supreme Chief, and is under a local Governor, who resides at Khoramabad and is, at present, within the jurisdiction of the govern ment of Isfahan. The four tribes are generally at enmity with each other, and are noted plunderers, * particularly the Dilfan and Silah-Silah. Caravans seldom pass through their hills, and then only strongly guarded. Widely speaking, they inhabit the hills to the south of the line Karman- shah, Khoramabad, Tang-i-Bahrein to the KabiT Kith, and have as east and west boundaries the rivers Dizful and Karkhah. They graze their flocks on both banks of the latter river and on the plains bordering the foot of the Kahn- Kuh (see page 56, Bani Lam Arabs). Through these hills runs the main commercial artery of the country, riz., th^ road Muhammerah, Dizful, Khoramabad, Burujird, Sultanabad, Kum, Tehran and along their front, an important transverse line, by the valleys of the Dizful (Burujird branch), Kemender-Ab, andZaindarud (Afhus branch), connects Karmanshah with Isfahan (see Part IV, Road Report No. S). The tribe of Dilfan furnishes the Luristan regiment. The Amalahs are Deh-Nishins and cultivate the crown lanus above Khoramabad. The Pusht-i-Kuh ( Lapard 1846) are divided into the Kurd of d,000 families; the Mehaki, 5,000 families; the Shahan, 400 families; luoit-i- m. Panj-Sitiin, 200 ; Dinarwand, 200 ; Lort 150; Hande- meni, 150; in all 10,100 families, and the Bajilan, 900 ; Bairanwand, 2,500; Hulilani, 1,500 families, numbering in all 15,000 families, assessed at 20,000 tomans. The three latter are dependencies or tribes not originally occupiers of the mountains. # ^ These numbers give the total numbers of Lurs in Lur-i-Kuchak to be 48,000 families (see detailed tables); and the total assessment to be 60,000 tomans. The tribe is under the chieftainship of the descendants of Hasan Khan, their last powerful Wall. They are at enmity amongst themselves and in- tri&lt;&gt;-ues to gain precedence have lead to many blood feuds. The government does not desire that there should be union amongst the tribes nor does it exert itself to bring them into proper subjection. Several of them are generally in open rebellion, and small parties of Lurs even cannot pass through their terri tory with impunity. Of the three sons of Hasan Khan mentioned by Layard as having divided the tribes amongst them on the death of their father, Hajji Chiefs. novv enjoys the chief authority, his principal adherents being the Sagwand subdivision of the Bajilan tribe; the pretensions86 of Haidar Khan, the 3rd son, to inherit the title of his father were upheld by the Persian Governor of Luristan, whereupon the elder brothers, Ali Khan and Ahmad Khan, took refuge with the Assyrian Arabs on the Turkish frontier [De Bode). Eventually, 2 or 3 years'’ back, such is the instability of all things Lur, Sartip Haidar Khan of the Bairanwand was put to death by the Governor of the district after having been invited to Khoramabad to receive favours of the Shah; his sons follow in the wake of Ali Khan, but are in no way attached to him, and consider that their misfortunes have been his opportunity. Of these young men the elder is by no means a prepossessing youth; the younger, quite a boy, has a face which attracts by reason of its look of quiet melancholy and resignation. They frequently visited Major Bell and related to him their misfortunes under the idea that he was a Sartip in the service of the Shah whose good offices at Tehran might have served to bring them again into favour [see pages 9 to 11). At the time when the party were treated with little consideration by Hajji Ali thej r offered tent room and hospitality. The Agent of the Zil-ul-Sultan with the tribe, not much liked by Hajji Ali, advocated their rights, so it is quite possible that a turn of the wheel of fortune may yet bring these lads into prominence. Ahmad Khan, the second* sou, has a considerable following and is at enmity with his brother, for like reasons, and in rebellion against the government. The chief of the Lurs about Kar- manshah is Husain Kuli Khan, a lawless chief; in fact anarchy reigns at the present time throughout Lur-i-Khuehak {see page 170). r-- i Rawlinson (183ti) gave the composition of the tribes of the Pish-Kuh to be— The Dilfan of The Sila-Sila of The Bala Giriwa The Amalak 15,000 families. 15,000 „ 6,000 2,000 i.e., in all 38,000 families, assessed at 40,000 tomans.

Mr. Schindler was in the service of the Shah and had good opportuni ties of gaining information. He states that there are 36 villages in Luristan; that the total assessment of the Pusht-i-Kuh and Pish-i-Kuh is Cd,000 tomans, and the total number of families of the Pfsh-Kuh to be 39,550 families, lie does not estimate the strength of the Pusht-i-Kuh. The boundaries of the Pish-i-Kuh are the Silakhar valley, the Bakhtiari country, the Dizful river, the Karkhah river, the Province of Karmanshah and the districts of Kangawar and Nahawand. The Pfsh-Kuh are divided ac cording to their summer quarters, as below :— The Dilfan Familips 4,900 Sfia-Sfla • •• • •• 5,000 Bala-Giriwa • •• ... 12,700 Horad • •• * • %% 8,050 Terhan • •• • •• 8,000 ’Amalah 820 in all 39,550 families. Their two great divisions are the Gulek, subdivided'into *Amalah and Bala Giriwa and the Selewerzi, subdivided into Sila-Sda and Dilfan. The ^Amalah (workmen) live chiefly in villages and are again subdivided into 30 families. The Bala Giriwa those who live in the mountains) inhabit the wild est and most inaccessible parts of Luristan ; their southern frontier is the Dizful river, their northern boundary the river Kishgan; the subdivisions are:— 1. Dirikwand, 30 branches, 2,000 families; inhabit the mountains on the borders of Arabistan. 2. Sakf, extinct; massacred by the Dirikwand. 3. Jiidekf, 500 families; inhabit the valleys between the Bowi moun tains and the Kialun. 4. Papf, 1,000 families, live near the Dizful river. 5. Reshnuwand, 200 families; live near Khoramabad. The above number in all 3,700 families; in 1836, Rawlinson estimated them at 6,000 families, and Layard in 1816 at the same figure. The following are also classed as Bala Giriwa, viz .,— 6. Makan Ali, have joined the Sagwand. 7. Bajilan, 8 branches; one of the largest of the Lur tribes. 8. Bairanawand; 18 branches and 7,000 families. They are classed by Rawlinson and Layard as dependencies. The Sfla-Sfla 1. Ghijaswand, nearl}’' extinct. 2. Kasanawand, 18 branches and 2,500 families: winter quarters in the Jaidar plain; summer quarters in the Alishter plain. 3. Kulfwand, 3 branches; 2,500 families inhabit the Khawah plain. 4. Yusafawand, 16 families; inhabit Alishter; or, in all, 5,016 families. RawlinsorPs estimate (1836) was 15,000 families, and Layard’s (1843) 10,000 families. 1290 The Dilfan :— 1. Muminawand . . . 12 branches, 2,100 families; inhabit Tang-i- Badawar. 2. Kakawand, 5 branches, 2,000 families; inhabit Darem Rud, south of Karmanshah. 3. Imetivand (Yiwetiwand ?), 10 branches, 500 families; inhabit south of Karmanshah. 4. Ainewand, 4 branches, 80 families, inhabit Tang-i-Peri; in all 4,190 families. RawlinsoiYs estimate was (1836) 15,000 fami lies and Layard’s (1846) the same. Schindler gives no estimate of the Pusht-i-Kuh, and his enumeration of the Pfsh-Kuh would seem to be imperfect. There is no doubt however that intestine wars and famines, an extortionate government, &amp;c., have caused them to diminish in numbers and not to increase. In 1884 Hajji Ali Khan estimated that the Lurs numbered in all about 150,000 men. His estimate is valueless. Assuming that the Lurs in Lur-i- Kuchak number 50,000 families, and allowing five souls per family, its population would number 250,000. This fairly coincides with the estimate made on page 39. The assessment of the tribes is fixed, as in the case of the Bakhtian, at £ certain number of Katirs, a sum of money of varying Assessment. i / irtn\ value [see page 102). The tribes cultivating the crown lands about Khoramabad, Saimarrah, Jaidar, Alishtar, Kuh-dasht, Tehran, Kir-ab are taxed in both money and kind. There are also indirect means of raising revenue by systems of fees and fines for robberies, murders and such like offences. The amount at which a Lur district is assessed being fixed, it is duly dis tributed over the tribes and their subdivisions; in a general council, and to the satisfaction of all, each subdivision determines the quota to be paid by its lesser subdivisions, camps and villages, and then the Katkhuda, Rishsaffd, or Tushmal of each collects from the different families under his rule accord ing to his knowledge of their individual ability to contribute. At Sadat in the Kuhgehlu hills Major Bell was present at an assem blage of the worthies of that village and encampment, presided over by its Rfshsaffd, and had evidence of the difficulties of the task of raising the revenue demanded of him, each man in turn pleading poverty and lack of funds. In all casts a compromise appeared to have been effected after many and loud altercations, the Rishsafid being aided by the opinions of the other members of the assembly. There is always a considerable difference between the government assess ment and the amount actually collected from the people ; thus in many districts in Iars, 20 per ceut. extra is collected by the authorities; in other districts Exactions. 40 per cent, extra is taken, and it is said that as much as 100 per cent, has been known to have been extorted. {Baring). All depends on the caprice of the local Governors, who in their turn are themselves called periodically to Isfahan, Tehran, to be fleeced by the Shah and the Zil-ul-Sultan, &amp;c. The Prince Governors during their tenure of office lay in for themselves wealth for future days, and it is rumoured that they, believing that Persia must sooner or later be ruled by aliens, have made full provision for this contingency [xeepages 4, 9, 100, 122, 174, 199).Attached to the Governors of towns, districts and tribes and others re- Intriguing agents. sponsible for the collection of revenue are, as a rule, agents of the Prince Governor, who aid in its collection ; these men seem to be also confidential agents who keep the Prince informed of the dissensions and dispositions of the tribes and who intrigue amongst them in the interests of their masters. • Ihe mules bred by the Feilis are considered to be superior to all others in Uuies.

There are few or none of pure Arab breed. Religion ; former and present. Some of the tribes of the Lur-i-Kuchak are still of a religion founded on, Ali-Ilahi religion. that of the Ali-llaln persuasion; and although the ma jority . , now are Muhammadans, they are not at all strict in their religious observances; the Ali-Ualns are chiefly confined to the Lurs in the Meinity ot Karmanshah where their lands border those of the Kurds. . . IS iar faith bears evident marks of Judaism singulariy combined with fcabaan, Christian and Muhammadan legends. It is thus referred to by * r “T1 aW A 1 r S TiV' 1 ^ °/ t* 16 Royal Geographical Society's journal :— p i, \ e 1 . i® believe in a series of successive incarnations of the Uodtiead, amounting to a thousand and one.

As above remarked, judging by the religion of the Sagwand tribe formed dur ing an intercourse of three weeks with them, the religion now professed by the Fedi Lurs is Muhammadanism {see page 10). The chief of the tribe is a ILajji ; all his sons are, by profession, devout followers of the false prophet. All the chiefs of the Bakhtiarfs and Kuhgehlu met with were of the same persuasion a^id all were anxious to make pilgrimages to'the 5/5 shrine at Karbala and to Mecca. All regarded the unholy pig with the greatest detestation and the young of the wild boar, wherever met, were stoned to death. A Mula, a noted man known as the Sherif-ul-din, travelled with the Sagwand tribe and at the camp of Mula Ali Khan at Bassaki {see page 23 ) were several mendicant Muhamma dan preachers and reciters of the Koran. Intermarriage between the Lui families is general {see pages 22, 95, 105.) Saiyids are, throughout Luristan, held in the greatest respect, and, wand ering amongst the tribe, live upon their charity. Vol. IX, Journal of Sir H. Rawlinson thus recounts the early history of the jff. G. Society, 1«39. Malis of Luristan :— History. Between the 12th and 17th centuries the province of Lur-i-Kuchak was governed by a race of independent princes, who were named Atabegs. The last prince of this royal race, Shahwerdi Khan, was removed by Shah Abbas the . Great, and the government was granted to the chief of a rival tribe, Husain Khan, with almost unlimited authority, and with the title of M ali in exchange for that of Atabeg. His de scendants have retained the title, which in Persia is almost equivalent to royalty,* and, though their power is now greatly weakened, they still affect a royal style in their manners and establishment. Owing to the intestine divisions of the family, Pish-Kuh, which is by far the fairest portion of Lur-i- Kuchak, has been wrested from them and placed under the direct control of the Karmanshah government. Pusht-i-Kiih, however, still acknowledges the sway of the Waif, and since the death of Mahammed AH Mfrza, Hasan Khan,t who had enjoyed this dignity, had yielded a mere nominal allegiance to the crown of Persia. Shortly before my visit, however, a breach had taken place in the family between Hasan Khan and his two eldest sons, and the tribes being divided, the Karmanshah government hud taken advantage of the moment to interfere, by supporting the sons against the father, and thus to establish a partial influence over the country. Hasan Khan therefore had been formally deposed, and Ah Khan and Ahmad Khan appointed joint * The title of Shahinshah, or King of Kings, was assumed by the Persian monarch as lord paramount over four tributaiy princes, the Waifs of Gurjistan (Georgia), Ardelan, Luristan, and Hawlzah. f Husain Khan.93 'Walls in liis place. The old man, for he is now upwards of ninety years of age, took refuge with a small body of adherents among the Arabs of the Assyrian plains, where, for some time, he baffled all the attacks of his enemies, and lately the Il yats, finding that they alone were the party likely to suffer in the struggle between their rulers, and the consequent extension of the Persian authority over them, have obliged the father and sons to be reconciled ; and Hasan Khan now again governs the territory of Pusht-i-Kuh with the power and energy of an independent prince (see page So). When the whole of Lur-i-Kuchak was under the dominion of the Waifs, all the tribes were included under the general denomination of Feili, the peculiar title of Husain Khan's clan! At present, however, the inhabitants of Pish-Kuh do not acknowledge the name in any way; they have a distinct classilication of their own, and the title of Feili is applied $done to the tribes of Pusht-i-Kuh, who are under the sway of the Wall. The maps therefore are incorrect when they describe the whole of Lur-i-Kuchak as “a mountainous country, inhabited by the Failf tribes.' I found Ahmad Khan a man of agreeable manners, and far better acquainted with the general state of Eastern politics than I could possibly have expected. There was a tincture of bigotry, however, in his conversation, which forcibly reminded me of his being the representative, both in family and station, of the infamous Kalb Ali Khan, who murdered for a conscientious refusal to pronounce the kalemah of Islam,* my unfortunate countrymen, Captains Grant and Fotheringham.f The family of the Wall indeed are notorious for their intolerant spirit; and I should recommend any European traveller visiting the province of Pusht-i-Kuh, in order to examine itsremark- p,, , .,, tj i . a ^ e antiquities, to appear in the meanest guise, and i-Kuh tribes. Jive entire )y among the wandering Ihyat, who are mostly Ali Ilalns, and are equally ignorant and indif ferent on all matters of religion. In my own case, of course, I had nothing to apprehend, as I was marching at the head of a regiment, and the rulers of the province were anxious to propitiate the favour of the prince of Karmanshah, in whose service I was known to be; but I saw enough on this journey, and upon subsequent occasions, of the extreme jealousy and intolerance of the Waifs' family, to feel assured that the attempt of an European to explore the country in an open and undisguised character, with any less efficient support, would be attended with the greatest danger (see pages 9 to 11 and below). The Feilis are considered by the Bakhtfans to be less civilized than themselves ; certainly their chiefs are so, and moreover they are more worthy of trust and have their tribes in better subjection (see ‘page 22). Loftus thus travesties the SagwandJ tribe :—■ Methkur's (chief of the Beni Lam) protection was valid among the insurgent Segwendis, whose camp lay on my next day's journey. Ali Khan (chief of the Sagwand) at first seemed disposed to be inhospitable, and perhaps thought what a diversion it would be to his respected followers if he gave the order for an onslaught on the party. His fears, or better feelings, however, prevailed, and he feasted me that night on good wheaten bread and national lamb. If any truth is to be placed in physiognomy, that of Ali Khan # There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his prophet. t See Malcolm’s 'ersia, Vol. II, page 138. + It is quite a mistake to call the Lursof this or any other of the tribes savages; each man in dividually is far advanced in the scale of civilization. That they are lawless is admitted {see Character, pig e 100).94 fully justified the character he received; his tribe, too, was the most extraor dinary assemblage of animals bearing the human form that I ever set eyes upon. They had high shoulders, long legs, pucker faces, and (if the Lamarck ian theory of transmutation of species be true) perhaps also long tails, although I will not vouch for this fact, not having had an opportunity of mak ing a minute zoological examination. They could not, however, have been so far advanced in the scale of progression as those men with tails, whom it is said the French naturalist, M. Castleman, heard of in Abyssinia, because the latter possessed benches with holes in them, through which they passed their tails; the Segwendis were not so civilized as even to construct a bench ! PI: d we encountered the strange race in this desert without Methkur's protection, our safety would not have been valued at a straw. As it was, however, All Khan provided a guide, in addition to the Arab sent by the Shaikh, and by his assistance we crossed the river Kerkha at a dangerous ford, and ultimately arrived in safety at Dizful (see pages 100, 105). Sir A. Layard estimates the total force that might be raised in Lur-i-Kuchak Fighting strength. as 4,000 to 5,000 horsemen and 20,000 matchlockmen, (assuming that every two families can send one man to join a field force). The quota that the Shah can demand of them is 5,000 horse and 10,000 foot soldiers. He remarks In calculating the actual force of an Ilyat tribe, like the Bakhtiaris, it may be presumed that each family can produce at least one armed man, and, indeed, each family may be called upon by the chief for the services of one person in his wars; but it must be remembered that, both for the internal defence of the country and for the actual cultivation of the soil and other necessary labours, a large portion of the male population will be unable to leave the tents. In the event of an external war, three-fourths of the males between the ages of 16 and 60, would probably join the chief (see pages 136, 137). 1 hey speak a dialect of Persian easily understood Language. a nd understand Persian.

The Haft Lang formerly doubted the number of the Chahar Lang. _ The original enmity that existed between the Haft Lang and Chahar Lang is losing its intensity with time and the two tribes are becoming more95 % and more a homogenous people under the Ilkhani. With time also the possi bility of revenging a blood feud with impunity is lessening, and such lawless acts are being confined more and more to the representative of the Shah, who may rule at Isfahan and under whose jurisdiction the tribes come. At the present time apparent peace and amity reign throughout their hills, and good relations exist between their chiefs the llkham and Jlbegi and the Zil-ul- Sultan ; bloodshed is punished and feuds repressed [see page 321). r lhe Chahar Lang occupy the south-east valley of the Zagros range from Lizful and Shustartothe territory of Behbahan. To thei r north and north-east lie the Haft Lang (see ?nap). They are under the jurisdiction of the Haft Lang {pnge 74). The Haft Lang are partly under the government of Burujird {tee pnge 103). We read in Hanway that at the time of the Afghan invasion of Persia, in Military Histor * le ^ ie bast century, the Bakhtfari chief, Kasim Khan, put 12,()&lt;i() horse into the field. Moving towards Isfahan he was met and defeated by the invaders with a loss of 2,000 men. Later on the Pasha of Mosul, notwithstanding a first success, was unable to permanently hold the country. 'fhe Bakhtians who accompained Nadir Shah to Herat distinguished themselves greatly during its siege. The Bakhtians in former years often disturbed the peace of Persia; they History.* wpre conquered by Nadir Shah, but not subdued. In the reign of Maharnmad Shah, they were first brought under subjection. Still they are not conquered. In the time of Nadir Shah, Reshid, second son of Zaman Khan, in whose family the chieftainship of the Chahar Lang has been vested for centuries, held an important post at the Shah’s Court. On the death of the monarch he fied from the Court to his native moun tains with a considerable sum of money, by the aid of which his eldest brother, AH Mardan, became a competitor for the throne. Muhammad Taki, who recently enjoyed the chief power among the Bakh tians, was descended from Reshid. During the time of his greatest prosperity the tribes acknowledging his authority numbered from lb,000 to 19,000 men, the chief of whom were Janniki Garmsir, 4,000 men; Janniki Sardsir, 2,500 men ; Diuaruni, 3,000 men, &amp;c. The Bahmehis and Teibis, the largest of the Kuhgehlu tribes, whose chiefs were related to him by marriage, were more under his control than that of the Governor of Behbahan, and when able joined him in his wars. The chiefs of the Bakhtfari, Kuhgehlu, Kashgai and Feili, intermarry and thus relations are kept up amongst the whole family of Lurs, adding much to their political power and their powers of cohesion and making common cause (see page 83 ). Muhammad Taki could perhaps have collected 15,000 men, of whom 3,000 to 4,000 were horsemen, if engaged in wars with other tribes or with Shustar, Behbahan or the Ka’b Arabs; if opposed to the Government, he could scarcely have collected |rds of that number; some would be unable to leave their vil lages and others would be too[much occupied with their own intestine broils. He relied chiefly on the Janniki Garmsir, whose matchloekmen are noted for their personal courage and efficiency. They are also the most peaceable of the Bakh tians. * Layard.96 The villages of Fendan are partly inhabited by Armenians. Here Muhammad Takf purchased vflla^es and acquired others and endeavoured tu encourage agriculture and to settle his Iliyats on its fertile soil. Opposed by the Persian government, his attempt was but partially successful. Its inhabitants are inoffensive, with a fair reputation for courage. They and a large body of men from Gulpaigan form the Fendan regiment [see page 20). The actual personal property of Muhammad Takf was estimated at 1,500 buffaloes, 50 excellent Arab mares, some valued at £250, 50 good Ka J b stallions, 500 brood mares, 500 horses of Lur breeds, and about 10,000 sheep and goats; of cash, he possessed little. Jealous of his authority over the tribes and his supposed great wealth, the Persian government broke his power, split up the tribes under various chiefs, and forfeited to the crown the villages of Fendan. Lured by the most sacred oaths on the Koran, he imprudently gave himself up to the Persians and never afterwards returned to his hills. After his downfall Jafer Kiili Khan, of the Haft Lang tribe of Bakhtfariwand, rose to chief power. At times he was able to assemble 5,000 .well armed and desperate men. His main stronghold is the Diz, 2 days* march from Shustar in a north-east direction, a natural stronghold, 3 miles in circumference, with perpendicular, inaccessible sides, well supplied with water and with a few acres of arable land and good pasture. He raised himself to power by a series of most atrocious murders and acts of treachery. AVith the most determined bravery he defied the Persian power and carried his plundering expeditions to the neighbourhoods of Karman, Yazd, Shiraz and even Tehran; the name of a Bakhtiari suthced to put to flight the boldest of the peasantry; his followers, the bravest and most barbarous of the tribes, adhered to him so long as he led them to plunder. His following, the Baidarwand and part of the Duraki tribes, en camped during the winter near the Diz, in Shimbar and Andakau, among the hills of Lali and about Gotwand on the Kanin. Their summer quarters were in the plains of Bazuft and Chahar-mahal and the neighbouring mountains. Jafer Kuli Khan built a small fort in Jella- khan. He eventually obtained the support of the Persian government. Next in political importance to Muhammad Taki was Kalb Ali Khan of the Haft Lang tribe of Duraki, and considered to be the legitimate chief of the Haft Lang. A few subdivisions of the Dfnarunis adhered to him. He waged continuous war against Muhammad Taki and Jafer Kuli. His Diz or fortress, the Diz-Shahi, near the river Dizful, a day’s journey north east of the town (18 miles) is considered to be impregnable. It is a plain, 15 miles in circumference, the summit of a lofty hill with inaccessible sides ; water is abundant, the soil fertile and grazing good; villages have been built upon it {see page 201). His followers were brave and warlike and noted marauders. The Haft Lang are reported to be more cruel than the Chahar Lang and have frequently been known to cut off the breasts of women taken prisoners, and even to proceed to acts of more revolting and gross barbarity. Wars between Bakhtiaris have always been wars of extermination, quarter being seldom received or offered. He, himself, was a peaceable and trustworthy chief. The anarchy that followed the fall of Muhammad Taki Khan led to Present history and the rise of Husain Kuli Khan, the son of Jafer administration. Kuli Khan, who began to make his power felt about 1 BAS during the reign of the present Shah. His chief opponents, the sons13 97 and son-in-law of Kalb AH Khan, he contrived to remove from the scene and obtained almost universal supremacy over the tribes. He ruled the tribes with a strong hand and his name was respected and feared throughout the hills. He completed the good work commenced by Muhammad Tab sternly repressed brigandage, and rendered the passage of caravans possible through his hills, a clemency much regretted by his subjects who would readily have returned to their old predatory habits {see pages 167, 319). J His power excited the jealousy of the Persians, and being suspected of holding ambitious views he was called to Isfahan by the Zil-ul-Sultan and was there murdered. His eldest son is a captive in Isfahan. It is commonly supposed that he is kept in prison bound with chains. His younger sons were, I am told, under charge of the present Ilkham, Imam Kuli Khan? brother ot the late Husain Kuli Khan.

Roth the Hicham and Ilbegi have several sons; Hajji Ibrahim Kuli Khan son of the latter, is Sirhing of the Bakhtiari horse, and has influence with the tribes {see pages 5, 22). I nlike the leili Lurs, Kuhgehlu and the Mamasseni they are united the majority acknowledging the authority of the Ilkhani. The section living in the vicinity of Burujird does not owe him allegiance. The Ilkhani is subject to the Prince Governor of Isfahan, and receives 1,000 tomans per annum as salary; the Ilbegi receives a salary of 500 tomans The district of Chahar Mahal is farmed by the Ilkhani, who pays an annual rent for it of 20,000 tomans. ^ ^ The present Ilkhani Imam Kuli Khan seems to be beloved by his sub- Ilkluud Imam-Kuli- jects and to govern them justly. He sits in darbar ia ?’ . daily and is accessible to all. His countenance and genial manner indicate a man of a kindly disposition ; his manners are simple yet courteous, and the members of his suite, although rough looking, are not without a certain polish and refinement of manners [seepages 5, 85,’ 100). His family are held in respect. . The chiefs of the great Lur families are, no doubt, from more frequent intercourse with Persians at the courts of Tehran and Isfahan, assimulatino- their manners to those of Persians and imitating their modes of life. Tea is now held in great estimation throughout Luristan, and no chief of'any note will fail to serve it after the Persian manner, when visited, with imported loaf sugar and lemons. Many travellers carry a charcoal brazier and brass kettle suspended from the crupper of the saddle as well as the universal kalyan. Population and armed Assuming that the Chahar Lang number 12 000 8t^eIlgth • families, the Haft Lang 11,000 families, and the depend encies 15,000 families, there are in all 38,000 families of Bakhtiaris. Reckoning each family at 5 members, a moderate estimate, the population of the Bakhtiari hills number 190,000 souls or eleven per square mile, taking the area over which they are scattered to be 17,000 square miles (see Estimate page 39). Assuming that in every two families one man is capable of bearing arms, the number of men that can be raised is 19,000. The Shah can call upon every Iliyat tribe to furnish him with one horse man and two foot soldiers per ten families, i.e., he can raise amongst the Bakhtians about 3,800 horse and 7,600 foot soldiers (see Fart III. naqes 136, 137, and ante).98 The arms of the Bakhtiaris and of the Lars generally consist of long smooth bore guns of Persian manufacture. Besides the above, slung across his left shoulder, the Lur horseman carries in his holsters a pair of pistols. They are excellent horsemen and skilled in the use of their arms. They are eager sportsmen, and shoot remark ably well from horseback (seepages 4,5). ^ They are particularly fond of training their horses to turn sharply . . from side to side at full speed; a skilled horseman will Cavalry training. fi re to the rear at full gallop and resting on one stirrup to shelter himself, fire to a flank, or hurl a dart or spear. No bows and arrows were seen in their possession in 1884. The chiefs carry sporting rifles, guns, and revolvers of the best London make. The harness in their use is serviceable; their bits, in the form of the letter H, with a circular piece of metal attached to the cross Horse accoutremen s. are particularly narrow and severe ; their saddles are padded frameworks of wood, serviceable but uncomfortable to those not accustomed to them. They ride with very short stirrups; the paces preferred are a quick walk (four to five miles an hour) and the gallop. The Bakhtiaris pay a tribute of 20,000 tomans to Isfahan and equip a force of 200 horse. The tribute is collected by the Tribute. Ilkhani, who himself receives from the tribe a tax in money and kind on animal and agricultural produce. At KaPa-i-Tul, Mirza Ao-ha Khan, the chief of the Chahar Lang and son-in-law of the late Ilkhani, holds jurisdiction under Imam Kuli Khan (see pages 286, 325 ). It may be assumed that a nomad family pays annually a tax of about two tomans. ... The chief wealth of the tribe consists in sheep, goats, cows, donkeys and mules; they have only a sufficient number of horses to supply their own wants.

(ghi)&gt; an d skins are also articles of export. They trap the fox and musooreh (kind of martin) in winter; the skin of the former sells for 2 and the latter for 6 to 8 krans each. Wheat and barley are not grown in sufficient quantities to meet home requirements. Acorn-flour in places takes the place of other flours. A good sheep is valued at one to one and a half tomans and a lamb at half its price; goats and kids are cheaper, costing 4 to 5 and 3 krans according to size. Their women and the Lur women generally weave carpets and yarn; Tentg the latter of both sheep and goats' hair; goats' hair is used in the manufacture of their tents (also the work of the women), which are generally of a black colour (chaclar) . They are readily pitched, struck and packed and so arranged in strips and lengths as to be carried by their cows which are of a small size and sure-footed hill climbers. These tents are of all sizes; they are high (8' to 10' in the centre) and long tentes d’abri, their length depending on the number of poles, generally placed at distances of 10 feet to 12 feet apart. The sides and ends are Availed in by wicker-work made of reeds ; by reed screens, the long blanket shed is partitioned off into any number of apartments desired; as a rule, each Avife, if a man has everal, provides herself with a tent, carpets, &amp;c., &amp;c. A chief, who has many99 wives, will pitch his camp in the form of an oval, into the centre of which the flocks of sheep, goats, &amp;c., will he driven. In the centre of each is dug a hole for the fire. Beds are unknown ; quilts are in general use (see page 54). These tents are poor winter residences, the wind blows through them; the rain pours through them, and except in fair sunny weather, their inhabit ants have no pleasant time of it. There are but few Arab horses in the country, possessed by the chiefs ; IIors(ig the hill horses are of mixed breed; they average 1-1 hands in height, are sure-footed, and capable of under going considerable fatigue; the rate of their walk averages 4 miles an hour ; they are ill-shaped ; but few, if any, horses are so suited for the hilly country in which they are bred and the stony and uneven country over which they are worked. A fair price for a good horse of Lur breed is 120 to 150 rupees. The Lurs are ignorant of horse breeding, of the good points of a horse, of their treatment in sickness, &amp;c., &amp;c.; the Kashgai breed of horses is no longer famous; breeders no sooner reared a good foal than they were com pelled to present it to any superior who took a fancy to it (see page 109). Good mares are kept for breeding mules, and in each encampment there is generally one good donkey stallion. Mares are generally ridden, fillies kept, and colts sold. The mules are of excellent quality and carry loads of 300 lbs., exclusive Mulos of the pad and trappings. The pad in use cannot be surpassed for excellence; it is 6 inches to 8 inches thick, stuffed with straw and cotton, and worked to fit the shape of the animal. It is Pack-animal equip- raised both in front and rear and kept in place by breast- raent - piece and breeching, both about 6 inches wide, of stout leather. The loads are fastened together by ropes made of camels’ hair and balanced on either side, care being taken to bring the loads to bear high up on the animal’s back. Over the load and under the belly is passed a broad surcingle to keep the whole tight and compact. It is made of leather and hair, with iron eyes at both ends, by means of which the ends are fastened together by a rope. The weight of the mule equipment, including the above, and saddle cloth or jhool, head stall, ropes, nose bag, &amp;c., &amp;c., is 60 lbs., and its cost 37 to 40 krans (15 to 16 rupees) (see page 143). The female mule is preferred to the male, she being considered the stronger and more enduring. Mules are bred from mares ; those Mulcs • bred from female donkeys are small and inferior. At the age of two years* the males are castrated. The young mule is allowed to graze with the herd until three years of age; it is then either sold or trained to work; the training occupies one year, after which the mule is fit for service. Their stamina and endurance are remarkable, and their sure-footedness extraor dinary. When required, they may be taken 60 miles at a stretch. Tor numbers, see page 138. A good mule costs from 100 to 150 rupees; they are not numerous. The best mules are of a short build, small, and well proportioned. An average load for a Persian mule is 260 to 320 lbs. This load he will carry daily a stage of 20 to 25 miles without halts. Tor rations, see page 83. Donkeys are numerous, each village or encampment of any size possessing from 50 to 100. Every villager has his donkey. They Donkeys. are m ore numerous in the valleys and plains than in the hills, where their place amongst the Iliyats is taken by cows. They carry loads of 200 lbs., 15 miles daily, for days consecutively, and form the chief100 minor transport of the country. They also supply its chief military trans port when on the move, each regiment being followed by a train of them. The cost of a good donkey is from 16 to 24) rupees. The pad and its trappings resemble those of the mule. The shoe in universal use consists of a thin plate of iron about 1^ to 1| g j ioe . n inches wide, hammered to the shape of the hoof, which it nearly covers, and is fastened on by four or six large headed nails; they last for about ten weeks. The breed of cows amongst the Feilis and Bakhtiarfs is small; the breed Oxen and cows. improves eastwards. Amongst the Kuhgehlu some good oxen were seen; the largest and best are bred by the Kashgai. This difference in size is accounted for by the better pasture found in the hills of the latter. Sir H. Rawlinson considers the Bakhtfans to be individually brave, but Character. a crue ^ an d savage character. They pursue their blood feuds with the most inveterate and exterminating spirit, and they consider no oath or obligation in any way binding when it interferes with their thirst of revenge; indeed, the dreadful stories of domestic tragedy which are related, in which whole families have fallen by each other’s hands, are enough to freeze the blood with horror (a son, for instance, having slain his father to obtain the chiefship; another brother having avenged the mur der, and so on, till only one individual was left). It is proverbial in Persia that the Bakhtiaris have been obliged to forego altogether the reading of the Fatihah, or prayer for the dead, for otherwise they would have no other occu pation. They are most dexterous and notorious thieves. Altogether they may be considered the most wild and barbarous of all the inhabitants of Persia (see jwge 93). Judging from the ready alacrity with which the Lurs render obedience to their lushmals or headmen and chiefs, the deference with which they approach such, their quiet and respectful demeanour in durbar and in putting forward a statement or complaint, the general decorum and seemliness observ ed in their encampments, their general modest behaviour and simplicity when not^ incited to behave otherwise by those whose authority they obey, it is conjectured that at heart they are not a bloodthirsty, thieving, or rebellious race, but, on the contrary, that their cruelty and blood-shedding is due to ambition unrestrained by fear of retributive judgment; their thievish pro pensities to a like want of fear and to petty exactions ; and their rebellions to oppression, Government exactions, and mis-rule, or rather a total neglect of all rule and of all justice; in fact, to Oriental despotism has been due their law lessness. It is the cause capable of producing but one effect; it gives no pro tection to private property, and offers no encouragement to industry. Integrity in Persia leads to ruin. &amp; J L nder a firm and just government there is every reason to believe that they would become tractable and loyal citizens. Contact with the race that rules them causes their general character to resemble that of the Persian, who is notorious for his total disregard ot truth, the fraud with which he conducts ordinary business, his thorough hypocrisy, and his avarice, at the shrine of which detestable vice all feel ings or honour and friendship are sacrificed. Although the enemies of eoch chief are to be found generally amongst those of his own household, yet t le majonty of the tribesmen have hitherto been remarkably loyal to their tribal representative (seepages 64, 163),101 (oTv BakhtiarI Lurs.

Returning to Persia, the former settled near Felat. SaLAk.— 2,000 families, with summer residence near Gulpaigan and Khonsar, and winter residence at Jopalag and Silakhor. They are chiefly engaged in agriculture. The Haft-Lang are chiefly iliyats; the Chahar Lang are now, many of them, settled, in villages j the former are poorer and worse clad, as a rule, than the latter ; they are less civilized.— [Layard). Now, under the Ilkham and a more settled rule, they are becoming less barbarous in character, and caravans can pass in safety through their hills. The chief tribes of the Chahar Lang are— Kiyunubzi.— 1,000 families, occupying in the summer Feridan, part of Japalak (Jopalag), and Bazuft, Zarda Kuh and the mountains of Mangasht; and in the ChahAr Lang. winter Hallagan and plain of Tul. They are chiefly ilayats, and are brave and expert horsemen. Sch6ni.— 1,500 families, occupying during the summer Bazuft and Zarda Kuh, and in ' the winter Gulgir, Asman, Shimbar, and Andaku. They are iliyats, and have both good horsemen and matchlockmen. They cultivate corn and barley, for the growth of which their lands are very favourable. Mahmud SAlih.— 1,000 families, occupying during the summer Chahal Cheshma and Fendan, and in the winter Miandizan and hills above the plain. It is one of the original tribes of the Chahar Lang.

Jamali.— 500 families. The chief dependencies of the Bakhtiari Lurs are the— Di'nAbunL —6,000 families, occupying during the summer Towah Doverah and other mountains above Susan and Bazuft, and in the winter Susan and Mai Amir. They originally came from Isfahan, and are as barbarous and ignorant as any tribe of the mountains, and are only kept in subjection by fear of severe punishment or death. They muster h few good horsemen, Jiud £ire 3dmir&lt;ible msitchlockmen. They cultivate corn, barley, and rice, and possess large flocks of sheep and goats. JANNiKi GABMSfB.— 5,000 families, chiefly Deh-Nishins, residing in Bagh-i-Malik Mai-Dawud, Malaga, and Kal’a Tul. They were originally included in the Kuhgehlii.102 Janniki Saedsib —.3,000 families, occupying in summer Gandaman and Lurdagan and neighbouring mountains—Gird-i-Bisher, Khana-Mirza, and Malamfr ; and in the winter Bors and its head-waters and Lurdagan. They were ori&lt;nn- ally included in the Kuhgehlu. They are for the most part Deh-NisMns. The Janniki Sardsir are not celebrated for courage or skill as matchlock- men; they have between 500 and 600 good horsemen. Their valleys are not ill-cultivated; rice, corn, and barley are raised in abundance; gardens and vineyards surround their villages, and the hills are thickly wooded with the bellut or dwarf oak and other trees. *Gunduzlu. —1,500 families, occupying during the summer the banks of the Ab-i-Gar- gar and the plain of Mosibena, and in the winter the village of Boleiti, Baitawand, Turk-i-diz, Mosibena. They originally belonged to the Af- shars, a Persian tribe inhabiting the greater part of Khuzistan, and even that now occupied by the Kab Arabs, the Bakhtiaris being at that time confined to the mountains. They have amongst them a considerable num ber of expert horsemen, and were in the time of Muhammad Taki very useful in rencounters with the Arabs, to whom they are superior in gallantry. And seven minor tribes chiefly scattered amongst the others. The foregoing estimate is that by Layard, 1846. Sir H. Rawlinson, in 1836, estimated the Bakhtians to number 28,000 families only. Their assess ment was then 100 katirs (mules), a conventional term denotioo* a sum of money which is increased or diminished according to the prosperous state of the tribes and the power of the Persian Government to exercise authority over them. The value of the katir was then 100 tomans. His table is here given in detail. Layard, estimating the katir or mule to equal 120 tomans, gives the total assessment to the Bakhtians to equal 12-634) tomans (1816), In 1884 the assessment was stated to be 20,000 tomans; in addition they were called upon to furnish and equip a force of 200 horse. Mr. Baring of the Tehran legation estimated the Bakhtian tribe, includ ing the Burujird section, to number 30,000 families, or in all 150,000 souls (1882). * It is assumed that 15,000 given in Yol. XVI, E. O. S. Journal, should be 1,500.14 105 General Remarks. Schools do not exist amongst the Lurs. The sons of the chiefs are taught Education. 1,0 rea( ^ auc ^ ' Vl 'ite and to repeat tales from the Gulistan and other favourite works, by niunxhis and mulds ; but the masses are totally uneducated. With each chief resides a munshi. livery man who has occasion to sign his name is provided with a signet ring. A few of the boys of the chiefs are sent to Isfahan to learn English and French. There also they receive a Persian nobleman’s education, which consists in being taught to read and write Persian and Arabic, arithmetic, metaphysics, and the principles of their religion (Shiya’ Muhammadans). Persian poetry and romance treat largely of the glory of warfare. The enervating education of the andarun has apparently not yet thrown its enshrouding folds over the boys of the iliyat nobility. They are as a rule manly boys; they treat their fathers with great respect. Medicine, &amp;c. 0f P h y s ic and surgery they are grossly ignorant. Dissection is contrary to their religion. Lur women go unveiled; they are good looking when young, but soon age and the fashion of dressing the hair in ringlets gives Lur women. their old women a weird appearance. The usual dress consists of pantaloons, generally of a red colour, and a long flowing ungainly dress without shape and hanging loosely about the person, from the neck downwards. Many of them go shoeless. The rich wear silks of a gay colour, and dress more in the Persian style, but without veils. They cover their bosoms with silver ornaments when they can afford to do so. Many cut their eyebrows to shape. When young, they are fair complexioned, with rosy cheeks, and hair either black or of a dark auburn or black with a reddish tinge—a colour perhaps not seen out of Persia. The hair of many of the men is of the same colour. The poorest class of men wear cotton shirts reaching to the knee under L U r 8 . a l° n g coat and skull cap of the same. They are well made, full bearded, with long shaggy hair and regu lar features; straight noses and foreheads. They are not at all as described by Loftu*) page 9d. They are not given to overmuch washing. A man marries as many wives as he can afford to keep. The chief wife and Domestic customs. ^ ie favourite wives dress in silks of bright colours, which their innate Oriental taste blends together harmoniously ; the other wives are poorly clad. Hajji Ali Khan, Chief of the Sagwand tribe of Lurs {see pa ye 85), has 25 wives. A chief’s influence with the tribes increases with the number of his wives, and his sons and daughters intermarry with those of the chiefs of other tribes, both distant and near. Except for their indulgence in the pleasures of the Harem, they are frugal livers. They never asked for wine or spirits, and were never seen to drink any. The life of the women of the Lur tribes is a hard one; they perform all household duties, tend the flocks, milk the sheep, weave yarn and carpets, help to strike, pack, and pitch their tents, clarify the butter, &amp;c., &amp;c.; the latter, a most wearying task, carried on in the very early morning or at midnight. The milk is churned in skins, suspended from the pole of the tent or beam of thereof; they are worked by the arms, in pairs, backwards and forwards, bv a woman seated on the ground between them. This hard work, sleeping and sitting on the damp ground, and insufficient clothing, account for their prema ture aged appearance. The winter is their slack time. They cannot be said to be over-modest. The Feili mother will sell her daughter to a man of an alien reli gion ; and stud operations are carried on in front of the tents {see page 10).106 Hoises. They believe in amulets and charms ; the former they will solicit for them selves and their children, and the latter to induce child birth, to bring 1 back the lost love of a husband, &amp;c. The amulets are chiefly sown into the head dress, and take the form of coins and ornaments of gold and silver. It is believed that the child to whom the amulet is given becomes the recipient of the fortune of its giver (seepage 10). The men content themselves with sowing and reaping, cutting wood for charcoal, defending their property, and seem to consider robbery and war their proper occupation, and are never so well pleased as when engaged on a foray (Rawlinson) (see pages 95,97). To a European it is an unaccustomed sight to see, those he would esteem to be ladies, j.i?., the wives of a chief, packing their tents and loading their baggage animals unassisted. Their villages are collections of poor mud or reed huts with flat roofs. Villages. Each hut or series of huts is connected with a yard into which the cattle are driven nightly. But few houses of a better class are met with ; these consist of several courts, surrounded by a blank wall. The only furniture consists of carpets, often valu able ; rugs, candle lamps, and brass trays for serving food. Flower gardens are not cultivated ; fruit gardens are laid out with no care, and are no better than orchards overgrown with shrubs and often weeds. The inhabitants of south-west Persia are frugal eaters; the food of Food. the poor consists of “ van, i.e., a leavened cake of wheaten, barley, acorn or other flour baked in an oven and mast or curdled milk. Buttermilk forms their chief drink. Cheese, butter, clarified butter, eggs, onions, rice, cucumbers, lettuce, and fruit are sufficiently cheap to be afforded by all. Meat is not generally eaten. Kabobs can be procured in the cook shops of towns and large villages. Upon such a diet they can undergo long and continuous fatigue. The repasts of the rich are more varied. Their chief meal is made after dark, about 9 or 10 P.M., and consists of curds, cheese, salads, &amp;c., following bv rich stews eaten with nee or rice and peas and pillans. Mutton stewed with plums is a very favourite dish. They drink buttermilk, sherbets of 1 imejuice, or of a syrup composed of vinegar and barley sugar. Tea served with limejuice and sugar is drunk several times during the day. The tea is made in a tea kettle which is kept boiling, and is of excellent quality. Coffee is drunk, black, by thimblefuls. It has quite given place to tea. the morning meal, served about noon, consists of fried eggs, salads, mast, cheese, van and sherbet, and perhaps a pillau of fowl or mutton or roast fowl. Ice when piocurable is in general use. Sweetmeats and cakes are largely consumed. Ihe Lui dialect, much akin to the Kurdish spoken about Karmanshah, is Language. generally intelligible to those who know Persian. It is ,. m i • • spoken by the whole family of Lurs with local modifica tions. I urki is generally understood by all Lurs. Sir H. Rawlinson considers the dialect to be derived from the old Farsi, . v y as co-^xistent with, but distinct from, the Pehlevi. The Kasghai is a lurkish-speaking family. So are all Lurs more or less. Religion. The Bakhtfans and the Lurs generally profess to be Shiva' J . l l amrnat ans ‘ ^ lf T seem to be in no way fanatical; their chiefs, in a patro nizing v ay,aic ond of observing that their religion assimulates to the Christian .(H i up 0 ie irn e of the birth of Muhammad and that his coming was foretold in the i\ew testament (seepages 10, 92, 93).107 The Kuhgehl(j Lurs. The hills occupied by the Kuhgehlu Lurs lie to the south of those of the Bakhtians, from the valley of Mai-i-Dawud as far as Bashta, village on the road between Behbahan and Shiraz. They hnre adjoin the Mamasenm. Part of the tribe is under the government of Arabistan, but by far the greater portion is under that of Pars. Their language, customs, and religion do not differ in any material respect from those of the Bakhtiaiis. They are divided into many tribes (20), the chief of which are the Chahar Banichah (divided into Bah-i-Rahmet, Nuwi, JUushmen-Ziari, Charumi), the Teibi, and the Bahmehi. The Bahmehi numbers about 3,000 families. Kala Ali, near the source of one of the branches of the Jerrahi, is the residence of its chief {seepage 10S). The tribe can muster 2,000 excellent matchlockmen and a small but efficient body of horsemen. They have the character of being great robbers {seepage 24 ). The Teibis may probably muster about 2,000 families. Their “ garmsirs ” and “ sarsirs ” are little more than a transition from the foot to the summit of their mountains, and a traveller who travels through their country along the road Isfahan-Behbahan in June encounters but few of their camps {see part lf r , Road Report No. 4). The Kuhgehlu tribe numbers from 15,000 to 20,000 families, and is cap able of putting into the field about 10,000 well-armed Strencth. / , men. Layard. They are bound to their Persian governors by no ties of patriotism or friendship; in fact, the reverse is the case. The same 0i ‘ l remark applies to the whole of the Arab and iliyat tribes inhabiting the coast plains between the Karun and Bushire and the mountains of Luristan stretching from Karmanshah to Shiraz. To a Persian the name of Lur is synonymous with that of robber, and under it are included the Feili, Bakhtiari, Kuhgehlu, Kashgai, Mamasenni, &amp;c. These brave aud warlike tribes, as already stated, have their own chiefs, by whom they are governed, and who are responsible to their Persian Government for the annual tribute at which they are assessed. So long as this tribute is paid, and the tribes do not harass their Persian neighbours or engage in serious hostilities amongst themselves, their internal government is not greatly interfered with {see page 137).. The governor of these tribes, occupying the provinces of Arabistan, Khuzistan, Luristan, and parts of Pars, is the Zil-ul-Sultan, whose seat of govern ment is at Isfahan, the southern capital of Persia. Under him are deputy governors, who reside at Shiraz, JDizful, and Burujird. The Kuhgehlu {Baring, 1832). The Kuhgehlu are divided into two great sections, viz., the Pusht-i-Kuh and the Zer-i-Kuh. The former are subdivided as follows :— PuSHT-I-KfjH. Chief*. Bawi Bah-i-Rahmet | Pehdasht Chavum Nowi Dushmen Ziari Sarhuddi .. Garmsm .. Teibi Bahmei Sai'huddi .. Garmsin .. Sarhuddi .. Garmsm ..

'rhe Nowi or Nui number about 2,000 families and are reckoned the best of the Kuhgehlu horsemen. They inhabit the hilly country to the north-east of Behbahan. The 'beibi number 3,000 families and occupy the mountainous region of Bors or Bars and Dina, the KalVi-Mula being their chief fort. The Bahmei are reckoned amongst the most unruly of the mountaineers of Fars ; they number 2,000 families and occupy the mountains to the north-west of Behbahan, from the Tang-i-Saulek to the Maidan-i-Patek .—[DeB de.)

Those tribes are constantly described as fighting amongst themselves, usually about pasture. They also have bitter blood feuds, and their not being amenable to the authority of any one single chief makes them ditiicult to manage. The Kashkat Lues. The Kashgai or Kashkai, Turkish iliyats, are considered to be of the Lur family, and in manners, customs, features, &amp;e., resemble the Bakhtfans and the Kuhgehlu, whose territory they border to the east. Their pastures reach to the neighbourhood of Shiraz, Persepolis, Yazdikhast, and Kumesheh. The winter pastures of the Kashkai extend to the south and south-east of Shi raz to Firuzabad and on the road to Lar. Like the other Lurs they commence their migrations thence soon after Nau-ruz (the spring equinox). The western Kashkai number some 8,000 households, some say ] 2,000, and could possibly equip for the field 3,000 to 4,000 men, of whom 1,500 could be mounted. The famine, prior to 1873, greatly diminished their numbers ; their chief families are the Ader Bav, Chardeh, Chink and Lashm. They are ruled by an Ukhani and Ilbegi; the office of the former is practically in abeyance. Living in the vicinity of Shiraz and the main SMraz-Isfahan road, they are more under Persian control than any other of the Lur family, and in consequence are heavily taxed, their lands being farmed out to that one of their chiefs who may happen to be the most unscrupulous, most exacting, and most ready in promises of enhanced revenue. The present Ilbegi is Darab Khan; he succeeded Hajji Xasirulla Khan as Ilbegi, who had himself succeeded Ali Kuli Khan. r lhese three families own the greater part of the Kashkai temtory. Ali Kuli Khan, at one time semi-independent, was through the instrumentality of the then Ilkhani, his relation, captured by treachery and his possessions confiscated. Darab Khan is popular amongst the nomads and is considered a good administrator. 1.0 be such a man must be energetic and himself visit his scattered following. The life of an Ilbegi who is practically, in the case of the Kashkai, the Ilkhani is not one of repose, but rather of incessant labour, both physical and mental (see pages 295, 296 ). 1 he Kashkai are wealthier than the Bakhtiari. For additional information, see Gazetteer of Persia. Mr. Baring, of the Tehran Legation, considers that the Kashkai out- nuuiber the Bakhtfans. In all they number 25,001) to 30,000 families.109 Kashlcai Khans, 1885. 1. Saltan Muhammad Khan, Ilkhanf (resides at Shiraz as a hostage for the good behaviour of his clan). 2.

The Cattlc ' Bakhtiaris and Kuhgehlu consider that the pasture of the Kashkai hills is superior to their own. Such, however, did not seem to be the case along the line passed over; to the south-east of Shiraz it may be otherwise. The Kashkai were nottd for their breed of horses; they now consider that they are inferior to those of the Bakhtiari hills. The horses now in the country are of a mixed blood; the Arab strain is still perceptible, but the beauty of their rounded proportions has been lost. Hidden early and over a ditlicult country, and fed chiefly on fodder, they soon age. Although their appearance is jaded, they possess muscle and endurance. An average height is 14 hands, and price 100 to 150 rupees, A good horse will fetch 300 to 400 rupees. There are very few good Arab stallions now left in the country. The Gulf Arab, the cross between large Persian mares and Arab stallions, are free from vice and sure-footed; their heads are small; u . rtt)S ’ their barrels and chests large; their bodies short and compact; their hoofs are large and healthy; shoulders, good ; they are wil ling and full of bottom and spirit.

It is therefore impossible for the Lurs, even when, ordered to improve their roads, to do so. A reference is made to the attempts made by the Kuhgehlu to improve the road between Isfahan and Behbahan on page 2 i. Such attempts must always be equally futile and unproductive of any good results, for all difficult passages over rock must be left untouched. When travelling through the settled districts of Persia no guides are required, the muleteers themselves being generally well acquainted with the roads. In Khuzistan, Arabistan, Luristan, and portions of Pars guides are very necessary ; they should always be procured from the khans of districts ; they alone can be relied on to remain with the party, and to supply their place by others. Where the want of a bridge is very greatly felt, and when the difficulty ., a to be overcome is not very excessive, bridges are built; when built, they are allowed to fall into disrepair, and when distant from a large town, to fall into ruins. Off the main lines of communication and within the hills and bordering them, numerous deep and rapid streams have to be forded; these obstacles are most formidable during the melting of the snow, March to June, and during the spring and winter rains, December and January {seepage 161 — Fords). A ready means of crossing the rivers, when in flood, is by means of rafts llaftg of inflated sheep skins covered with fascines {kalak). In few parts of South-West Persia is timber plentiful enough for their construction {see page 163). The river Zaindarud was crossed at the end of May on a timber raft at Bagh-i-Wargarum {see page 277), the bridge there having been washed away. In 1830 Major Rawlinson crossed troops and guns over the Kaiun at Shustar by means of u kulaks.” P ^ Ferry boats are almost unknown except on large rivers such as the Karum ; they are of small size {see page 40). Ferries are few and far between, andean muster but one boat as a rule. Horses and baggage animals are driven into the river and left to swim across by themselves. Donkeys, sheep, &amp;c., are bound and laden as merchand ise, or are crossed over as described on page 72. Persians dwelling on the banks of rivers are generally strong swimmers and expert at manoeuvring rafts. The rivers are generally well suited for working flying bridges. None, however, were seen, unless the raft at Bagh-i-Wargarun may be considered to have been one. The only regular post in South-West Persia is that between Bushire p t8 and Tehran via Shiraz, Isfahan, and Kum. The only other means of communication to the south of the line of Khoramabad-Isfahan is by special messengers. Chapperor express horsemen will travel at the rate of 5 miles an hour, and kossid or foot messengers will, at times '-o 60 miles in one day. Merchants combine and amongst themselves keepupastaff of kossids. Khans keep their own sowars. Northward of Buru- jird bi-weekly posts exist between the chief towns. The postal route is also the telegraph route. Attempts were made to connect Shustar and Dizful with Khoramabad by a Telegraphs. carr ^ e q through the Lur hills via KaPa Rezza, Jaidar Ab-i-Sard, &amp;c., but it failed, as the Feili Lurs pulled it down and destroyed the post and telegraph offices as soon as they were built.112 There is telegraphic communication between Khoramabad and Burujnd, and thence with the rest of Persia (.ve&lt;? pnge 110). A telegram is said to take, at times, longer in its transit than a letter. Persians do not value time and with them procrastination is a virtue. No more unsatisfactory measure of distance obtains anywhere than that „ x * ,• of the farsakh, which seems to vary according to the JJr“ caprice of the estimator alone! _ It was defined to he the distance that a fast-walking horse could cover in one hour. Wealthy Persians train their horses to a fast road pace, which may be estimated at 5 miles an hour; others, untrained, will walk to 4 miles an hour, and hence no doubt arises the great discrepancies in estimating distances in Persia. In Arabistan, Mr. Schindler estimates the farsakh to be 3'82 miles ; in Persia generally it may be assumed to be 4 miles. Experience alone can teach whether it should be given a value of 3, 4, or 5 miles. It is most diiiicult to get trustworthy information from Arabs and — . Persians. Thev think little, know little, and desire to Information. J in\ t? ^ a e know no more [see page Iz). itven the word ot a gov ernor should not be believed; they never hesitate to speak falsely and to exaggerate; promises will be given, but never carried out. To give a man the lie in Persia is no offence. For instance, Schif, opposite to Bushire, was described to Major Bell by the son of Muhammad Khan of Mohrezi, Zabiter-i-Ruhilla, to be a large town, amply supplied with provisions of all kinds, transport and water. He found it to consist of one hut, and that neither water nor provisions of any descrip tion could be obtained. Fortunately this propensity to lie, in order to shift the burden of sup ply, which every Arab or Persian host of position feels bounds to provide gratis, being known, full supplies of food and water had been laid in at the ex pense of his hospitable (?) host regardless of his assurances that such a pre caution was quite unnecessary. This is one instance only out of a thousand. Neither muleteers, guides, khans, governors, nor princes should he believed, for each will speak only what he wishes you to believe, and that which accords with his own indolent Hospitality habits, or what will relieve him of responsibility and ease his purse of the self-constituted burden of hospitality, which he often most grudgingly performs, even against a thousand remonstran ces that he should perform it at all [xee pages 6, 9, 5, 20). The only two ports from which South-West Persia can be entered are Travelling, South-West Muhammerah and Bushire. There is a large commu- Persia - nity of Europeans at Bushire, merchants and telegraph officials, and there are the head-quarters of the Political Agency of the Gulf ; consequently it makes a good starting point for the land journey and carriage can be obtained without great delay. If the country is entered from Muhammerah, Basra is the best port at which to outfit. If land carriage cannot be readily obtained at Muham merah, the Karun river can be ascended by boat to Ahwaz. Land carriage is not plentiful at Ahwaz or anywhere to the south of Shustar. A traveller in Persia should be provided with a stock of presents and Presents. medicines; of the former, those most appreciated are, arms and ammunition, binoculars, silks, broad cloth (black, blue, red, and drab), cutlery, silver cigarette-holders and cigarettes, silver pocket compasses. Of the latter, the most useful are eye medicines, quinine, pills, lint, sticking plaster, caustic for sores, and stomach and liver medicines. The traveller is often asked to supply a set of false teeth. As15 113 Persians are ignorant of medical matters and of all sciences, and believe that Europeans must know everything and especially the properties of drugs, the traveller need fear no detection should he desire to pass off as a physician. Broadcloth is highly esteemed, and no Persian gentleman would degrade himself by wearing a dress of cotton. Care should be taken to take saddlery for all servants requiring to be Hints to travellers. mounted, as it is difficult to procure in the Gulf. Arab saddles are simply thick pads without any wooden frame work, and Persian saddles are short in the seat. All packages should be of a small size and suited for both mule and donkey or bullock carriage. Bullock trunks of leather of a size not exceeding 2' long x l'4' deep x 1' wide meet this requirement. When filled each will weigh under 90 lbs. A mule will carry three and a donkey or bullock two of them. Besides the above packages of small size, a pair of yek-dans, or light but strong wooden trussed boxes, will be required. Those in use along the line Bushire-Shiraz measure 3' long x 2' deep x 1' 9' broad. They are difficult to obtain in the bazars. The following provisions can be obtained in plenty throughout Persia :— Nd/i or bread of wheaten flour [see page 103), wholesome and digestible; fowls, mutton, eggs, mast (curd), cheese, dokh (buttermilk), butter, rice, vegetables, fruits, sugar, salt, pepper. The Iliyats can supply all the above except the six latter, which are onlv to be obtained in bazars. All provisions are cheap. At Ishafan, in May 1384, mutton was selling at Id. to 2d. per lb.; beef at a less price ; bread under \d. the lb.; eggs, 8 the Id. ; fowls, 4d. to 8d. each, &amp;c., and other provisions at a like cheap rate. There are very few villages in which barley and chopped straw cannot be obtained for horses and baggage animals. The total cost of a horse per day including the groom's pay is Is. In the season grapes are given to horses as food. Bazars are only to be found in the towns or large villages; here alone tradesmen, such as blacksmiths, carpenters, leather workers, frc., congregate. There are very few of them, and they are very bad handicraftsmen. In all towns are serais in which travellers can take up their quarters and where they can obtain provisions from the serai-bd.shi. In all villages along a frequented route a building with a yard is set apart for the convenience of travellers. Provisions can be obtained from the villagers through the interposi tion of a “ rtth-safid.” Where bazars do not exist, it is the custom of the coun try for some household to bake bread for the party at a settled rate per pound. In villages off the frequented route the katkhudd will arrange for quar ters either in his own house or in that of one of the villagers; but to be quite independent, the party should carry tents. The chddar or black tent of the Iliyats is convenient if the weather is not too cold or wet. Good white canvas tents can likewise be procured in Persia at times; but as nothing is forthcoming when required, and even chudars are difficult to procure, small light Kabal tents should be carried. Spare horse shoes and means of shoeing a horse should be carried in the hills. Persians are foul water drinkers and are careless of its pollution by sewage [see page 232). Yabus should never be entertained as carriage, if mules can be procured.114 The most that a traveller iu Persia, unconnected officially with the Gov- Record of route ernraent, can do towards surveying the country that he passes through is to keep a traverse of the road, and to take angles to a few of the most conspicuous points, noting all angles in a pocket book, and the hour at which they are taken. The average rates at which a mule travels are fairly uniform over plains and over hills. Such a traverse, checked by latitudes and longitudes, oives very fair results, especially if the rate of the chronometer can be checked frequently. In the present case the half chronometer watch was checked at Muham- merah, Kum, Isfahan, Bandar-Dilam, and Bushire. Its error thus determin ed enabled a daily rate to be struck between Muhammerah and Kum, Kum and Isfahan, Isfahan and Bandar Dilam. This gives approximate results only, for it was found that the daily error varied with the temperature and length of the stajxe made. Chronometers and half-chronometer watches and aneroids are rated and checked before issue under conditions of absolute rest, whereas when in use the traveller subjects them to conditions of unrest and jerk. The error result ing from such usage, which is inseparable from that of travel, can be best determined by striking rates as often as possible and by working relatively to each known point as met with in succession. The chronometer should be a good one to begin with and a steady goer and be tested before issue for one month under conditions similar to those under which they ivill be used, i.e., by being carried about on foot and on horseback. The same remark applies to the aneroid barometer, which should be likewise tested in a similar manner. For the corrections allowed for in determining the heights of the points given in this report, see page 2S. The variation of the compass is so small that it may be neglected iu rapid compass work. The following were taken as the positions of the above-mentioned places :— Muhammerah K lira Isfahan Bandar Dilam Bushire Latitude. ... 30° 26' ... 34° 41' 30* ... 32° 35' 30' ... 30° 0' (P ... 28° 59' 7' Longitude. ... 48° 13' C/' ... 50° 53' 54' ... 51° 39' 0' ... 50° 10' 0' ... 60° 49' 24' dhe instruments used were, for the road traverse, pocket compass, watch pattern, large size, 2 inches diameter; an aneroid barometer, 4 ,/ inches diame ter; and for astronomical observations a silver half chronometer watch, a 6-inch Hadley's sextant and a George's artificial horizon. The use of the pocket compass attracts little attention, as it is held to the breast and not to the eye, and the results that it gives are astonishingly accurate. So long as you explain that the sextant is a watch, by means of which you regulate, by observing the sun and stars, the one that you wear, great interest will be taken in seeing the tamashd, and the purity of your intentions will not be doubted. J If possible, a swung ship's chronometer should be taken.0 III. STRATEGICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS. N.B.—Pages 115 to 164, which treat of Strategical considerations, are printed) separately as a Secret paper.167 Commercial considerations. Concessions are continuously being made by the Shall to construct rail ways and cart roads, to re-open canals, &amp;c., but are as often rescinded. The chief public works projects that have been constantly before the Persian Government, and which are of the greatest consequence to Great Britain, are— I. —The opening of the Karun to navigation to Shustar. II. —The rendering secure the present caravan route through the hills via the Chul and DaKch passes to Khoramabad. HI.—Improving the road Shustar, Khoramabad, Sultanabad, Kum both in width and gradient to enable carts to traverse it. IV. —Reopening the Karun canals and irrigating the plains of Arabis- tan, known as the Ahwaz irrigation scheme ; and V. —Finally, the construction of a line of railway from Shustar and eventually Muhammerah to Tehran. Nos. I, II, III, and IV are projects that can at once be taken in hand with the promise of a handsome commercial return. Besides the above, a French Engineer has conceived a scheme of water communication between Karmanshah and Muhammerah by canals connecting the rivers Kasaru, Karkha, and Kanin. The construction of a railway across a country presenting such topograph- Railroads difficulties cannot be undertaken lightly, and must follow in the wake of the cart-road. As no materials, tools, &amp;c., exist on the spot, a cart-road is a primary necessity to its construction. The greater pi-oportion of the labour required to form it will have to be brought from afar or imported. The commencement of a railway from Mu hammerah or Shustar has the great advantage of affording carriage for the material required to construct it as it advances. Once the above line is in working order, either as a mule track, a cart-road, or rail-road, like feeding roads from Isfahan, Yazd, Hamadan, &amp;c., will not be long wanting ; and these are the most fertile parts of Persia, exporting grains, wool, and luxuries,— i.e., opium, tobacco, cotton, wines, fruits, &amp;c. This line is as important to Great Britain in a military as in a commercial sense {see Strategical Considerations ). In considering the advisability of at once constructing a railway from Muhammerah to Tehran, it has not been overlooked that our colonists push pioneer railways almost in advance of their roads. In one the people, however, possess, as a rule, a much less mountainous country, carts, a fine breed of cart horses, enterprise, and a secure government; whilst in Persia the country pre sents great engineering difficulties, and no carts, no fine cart horses or bullocks, no labourers or artizans, no increasing or enterprising people exist. The Government is an Oriental despotism and the Asiatic system ; i.e., corruption and false dealing is in full force. The possibility of opening up the Kanin river (I) has been considered in Tr . , . Part IV {see paces 182, 193). Alone, and unaccompani- arun concession. ed by the security of the road to Khoramabad (II), its being opened to traffic would be barren of results, except in so far as the Isfa han trade is affected. The late Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris was most anxious to open up this route and the road to Isfahan through his hills, offering to Mr. Mackenzie, of the firm of well-known Gulf merchants, the inaugurator of the scheme, to take one-third share in the cost of the steamers (paying money down); to provide 100 mules for land transport from Shustar; to give a bond for the safety of caravans ; and to repay losses caused by robbers. The present Ilkhani would seem to take no lively interest in the matter; he avoided the subject, and hinted that the British, under the garb of the108 merchant, often concealed the dress of the warrior; indeed, the sad fate of his predecessor, Husain Khan, would naturally cause him to let alone all manner of schemes, whether commercial or political [see page 97). The opening 1 of the Karun would not af first interfere with the Tigris route into Persia via Baghdad to Karmanshah, this part of Persia not being readily reached by it ; eventually it would supersede it. A steamer for the navigation of the river has been purchased at Bre men; it remains to be seen what use the Persian Government will make of it. The concession opening the Karun to traffic should also permit the reopening of the Karun canals; (IV) the latter is not incompatible with the former, provided the river obstructions are turned by a canal, and irrigation is required to develop the resources of the plains of Arabistan. It is most essential to success that both these commercial enterprises be worked by individuals of the same nationality. Land is productive in Persia in propor tion to the facilities of irrigating it. To sow other lands, and to trust to the rain to germinate the seed, is a lottery, and looked upon by devout Mussulmans as a gambling transaction prohibited by the Koran. That this irrigation scheme is practicable is certain. By means of a turf dam constructed about 8 miles above where Muhammerah now stands, the Ka'b Arab turned the waters of the Karun towards the Kaban district, which, thus irrigated, produced abundance of sugar, cotton, indigo, sessame, dates, wheat, rice. The dam being allowed to fall into decay and the Karun to renew its old course, the Kaban became the parched desert it now is, and had to be abandoned altogether, and the capital town removed to Dorak or Fela- yiyah [Robertson). The cultivation of Persian Arabia now alone depends on rain, or the accidental overflowing of the river. If I, II, and IV are assured, the improving the road Shustar, Khoramabad, Kum (HI) into a cart-road is not of the first importance; for, as it exists, it is a caravan road, and not very difficult to pack-mules, bullocks, and donkeys. The first requirement is to improve it as a mule track. Even were the cart-road constructed, many years must elapse before an impoverished people could provide themselves with carts, harness, draught cattle, &amp;c., and before artizans could be formed to construct and repair them, &amp;c. Best commercial route from the Gulf to Tehran. Putting on one side the expediency or necessity of constructing a railway or even cart-road from the Gulf to Tehran, a consideration of the first import ance is the opening up that route by which goods can be delivered at the cheapest late fiom tlie Guif in the Tehran markets, using the means of transport already existing in the country. The three main routes from the Gulf on Tehran are: (1) Iiom Bandar Abbas via Karman, Yazd, and Kashan a fairly level road neatly the whole way, and 280 farsakhs or 920 miles Ion 0 *. To render it sufficiently wide and level to enable carts to pass over it, es ^ ma ^ es 1^0 miles will have to be made at a cost of In,000 tomans (Rs. 60,000). (2) From Bushire via Firuzabad, Shiraz, and Isfahan, 200 farsakhs or 800 miles long, ot which 80 miles require to be made to render it passable to carts ; ami the alternative roads vid Kazran and Shiraz, 717 miles long, ot which 44 miles require to be made to render it passable to carts (Captain Wells). 1 The former route, passing over a less difficult country, is that which would be selected tor a cart-road. The above routes cross desert tracts, and are liable to complete stoppage in inTsTl-Ta) “ y amon S stthe P»&lt;*-ammals (this occurred/ 22 169 (3) From Muhamraorah via Shustar, the Chul Pass, Khoramabad, Sul- tanabad, Kum, a distance of 622 miles, of which 137 miles can be traversed by river, and of the remaining 485 miles, of which 1 75 miles require to be widened, more or less, and improved in gradient to allow of carts to pass over it. Mr. Schindler estimates this road to be 130 farsakhs or 520 miles to Tlizful, and therefore 093 miles to Muhammerah, and that 240 miles will have to be made, as above, at a cost of 50,000 tomans (Rs. 2,00,000). W ith reference to the above estimates of the cost of improving Persian communications to suit them to cart traffic (road 15' wide), the following are put forward by Major Bell (see Road Report Nos. 1, 2, and 4.) Road Muhammerah to Kum. Aluhammerah to Bala-Rud Miles. 183 Rs. 3,660 Bala-Rud to Khoramabad 147 26,940 Khoramabad to Burujird 63 6,700 Bdrujml to Sultanabad 60 8,000 Sultiinabad to Kum 82 5,800 Total 535 51,100 Increase in length caused by diminished gradient, say 100 50,000 or at an average of Rs. 160 per mile. 1,01,100 Kum to Gulpaig&amp;n 112 8,800 Increase of length caused by diminished gradient ... 18 9,000 or at an average of Rs. 135 per mile.

Rs. ... 102 21,520 ... 173 46,000 ... 275 ... 25 12,000 79,520 A reference to Road Report No. 1, page 13, will prove incontestably that the routes from Bandar Abbas and Bushire cannot, as commercial routes, compare with that from Muhammerah. The latter is shorter by 178 miles than that from Bushire; (2) passes over no very difficult country; taps the most fertile districts of Persia, i.e., the plains of Arabistan, Shustar and Dizful, Hamadan, Karmanshah, Burujird, Sultanabad, as well as that of170 Isfahan via the fertile districts of Gulpaigan and Khonsar. From Mnham- merah, Isfahan is, via Burujml, distant O'ZS miles, i. &lt;?.,85 miles longer than the Bushire route via Ffruzabadand Shiraz. Tid Shustar, across the Bakhtiari hills, it is 126 miles shorter. f lhe advantageous commercial position of Burujml has been referred to on page 13. There is a fourth route leading from Bandar-Dilam through the Kuhgehlu hills on Isfahan {see Route Report No. TV, page 25). Taking the shortest line, its distance is 315 miles, performed in 15 stages. This route is said to be used by caravans; but such is not the case. The exer tions of FerhadMirza and of his son, the Ihtisham-ul-Daulat, have rendered it secure, and they are supposed to have improved it. Practically it has not been improved {see pages 22,23, 25). It is very difficult as it exists; and although 103 miles shorter than the road via Finizabad and 112 miles shorter than that via Kazran from Bushire, it remains unused. There are no caravanserais along it. Want of these, of villages, and supplies, combined with its bad name for robbers, are the causes which prevent traffic along it {see page 26). I he only route that compares at all favourably with the Muhammerah route to Tehran is that from Baghdad accessible to steamers drawing 3 to 4)' by the Tigris. Its trade, passing through foreign custom-houses (Turkish), is always liable to be checked by imposts imposed at will, and to restrictive quarantine regulations. The distance of Baghdad from Tehran is by the great caravan route via Hamadan and Karmanshah 500 miles, performed in 30 stages. \\ hen the Shah visited the Karbala shrine, he drove in a carriage from Karmanshah to Baghdad, a distance of 210 miles. Phe passage of the hills presents no great difficulties, and a railway fol lowing this line would meet with no insurmountable obstacles. When the time shall come for railways to be constructed in Persia, the commercial merits of these two lines can be more nicely balanced. Politically, the former hue is to be preferred, as it passes wholly through Persian territory, and is more under the control of Great Britain {see Strategical Consideration). Very probably both will be required, the section Karmanshah-Baghdad forming part of the Grand Trunk line running from the shores of Syria, via Baghdad, Karmanshah Isfahan, Yazd, Karman, Seistan, to Quetta, and the hue Muhammerah, DiziPul, Tehran as a main feeder to it {see page 176 and map) urks and Persians keep as much aloof from each other as possible. Heavv custom dues are levied upon all goods passing from Turkish territory into Persia, and Persians pay double quarantine rates. I he objection raised against the Shustar-Khoramabad route is that it Objection to the Mu. passes through the district of Lur-i-Kuchak, and that route! 0111 0rama J ^ 10 k ,lr robbers would, as heretofore, plunder the cara- it. and pwvn tb* . , ?' an ;b destroy the caravanserais and bridges built along in the Kuho-pbl/rn 1 J self - [he «™nner in which robbery has been put down ln YT hlu llllls 1 has already been referred to {see page 24). succession o/wS 8 *T* n0W rei =' s throu S 1 ““t Lur-i- Kuchak is due to a a small hod v of V. a,U - l ' l l &gt; ' u '!. ous £g ernors * A just and firm governor, aided by pacifv the district °b 0 e| r° rc e lus authority, would, within a few months, camvanselal a„ i tl T' 8 this e “ d &lt; tho construction of the road and road is now unite t 'I T ' C‘ C| 'C' UC| °f caravans along it, are required.

Stationing* in each 100 infantry and 10 cavalrymen to guard the caravan serais and to furnish guards for the road, and keeping in hand a mobile force of 100 infantry and 100 cavalry to move on any required point within a few months, it may be confidently assumed that this small force of 800 infantry and 170 cavalry will have completely pacified the district, and the scandal of a people in the very centre of Persia refusing to acknowledge the authority of the Shah will be done away with. The Bakhtians smile at the state of affairs in Lur-i-Kuchak, and the Ilkhanf, if allowed, would soon reduce it to order. It is very doubtful, however, whether this anarchy is not connived at for PerBi.vn exclusiveness, political leasons, lo open the I^arun to navig*ation^ and the roads through Luristan to commerce, is, to the mind of the Shah, to give the foreigner a footing in Shustar and Dizful, to enrich the Lurs and Arabs, and to strengthen a part of the country still unsubdued and occupied by alien races and but scantily by Persians. In commercial enterprise time is an important factor, influencing the cost of delivery. The average time that a caravan from Bushire takes to reach Tehran is 40 days. Muhammerah takes on an average 31 days, and from Allowing three days for the passage of goods by steamers from Muhammerah to Shustar—two will probably suffice (see pages 193-194 )—the journey can the effected in 27 days : thus, in the first ins tance, a saving of 9 days results; and in the second of 13 days. from Shustar a caravan can reach Isfahan by the Bakhtiari route in In days, and from Muhammerah in 2 l days—a saving of 7 days on the Bushire route. Combining the land route from Shustar with the river route from Muhammerah, the number of days required to land goods in Isfahan is 18 a saving of 10 days on the Bushire route. Caravans from Bushire require 13 days to reach Shiraz and 15 days more to reach Isfahan—/.&lt;?., a total of 28 days. From Bandar-Dilam caravans could reach Isfahan, 345 miles, in 15 days through the Kuhgehlu hills, or a saving of 13 days over the Bushire route; yet it is not used {see page 26 ). It must be remembered that the two roads leading directly through the mass of the mountain range are closed in winter by snow drifts, and In the spring by torrents. The road Shustar to Isfahan through the Bakhtiari hills may be assumed to be closed during the months of January and February, and that from Bandar-' Diiam through the Kuhgehlu hills during the months of December to April. ‘ Should the worst of the streams be bridged or arrangements made to cross them by rafts, the danger of being stopped by torrents would be obviated. Along these hill roads are no caravanserais. It would be necessary to build and stock them with provisions, including fodder, in the manner that the wants of troops in India are supplied at camping grounds by bardashtkhanas, in order to meet the exigencies of the country caused by the custom of the nomads migrating at certain times. The demand would soon cause small colonies to spring 'p round about the caravanserais if their sites be well selected. British commercial enterprise in the interior of Persia would seem not' British commercial to have been great. The chief trade of Isfahan is in the euteiprise. hands of Ilotz ic Co., a Dutch firm. The agents of Ziegler &amp; Co., another Dutch firm, with chief seat of business at Tehran, are found in Sdltauabad and throughout the carpet manufacturing districts. This apparent want of interprise is due to losses caused by inability to recover debts. Caravanserais supplies and172 To put trade on a secure footing, a British Consul is required at Isfahan to regu late its trade and that of Shiraz, &amp;c. An Armenian agency ill meets this want.

What the road would cost if Persian labour were employed it is impossi ble to say, as they are altogether ignorant of road-making,—probably five times that amount. To widen the above into a cart track (unmetalled) should not cost over 15,000 tomans more, or in all 30,000 tomans— i.e., under 90 tomans per mile. This estimate does not include the cost of masonry bridges or of caravanserais where they do not exist. A like estimate, *.(?., 45 tomans per mile, applies to the cost of rapidly im proving the road Shustar to Isfahan across the Bakhtian hills, with reference to the formation of the pack-animal, but not to that of the cart-road. The letter would be more expensive. The country passed through is well wooded, well watered, and generally fertile. The pasture al. ng it is excellent and abundant. average^ expenditure of 45 tomans per mile on the Bandar-Pilam, Behbalian, Sadat, Isfahan road should sullice to turn it into a good road for pack transport as above. It is considered that to attempt to improve these two latter pack-animal roads into cart-roads, until the exigencies of commerce shall require it, would be to spend money most unprofitably. It will suffice, in the first instance, to improve the roads Muhammerah-Dizful-Kum and Shustar-Isfahan. A sort of cart-road exists between Tehran and Kum. Along both roads caravans can pass unmolested. The above estimates are for rapid work by gangs of imported labourers, and consequently exceed those already given on page 169, in which work is supposed to be leisurely carried out by contract.

Were British interests once firmly placed in South-West Persia by the opening up of the Karan to Shustar, our just rule would work its own accept ance and gain the confidence of all Persians, with the exception of their rulers, whose interests lie in fostering the present untenable state of affairs. To put off sowing the seed of prosperity and reform under the idea that when we find it necessary to do so we can plant the grown tree and at once reap its fruit is a policy that will not bear a deep investigation, for that it will succeed is as likely as that the fruit will be plucked. Considering now generally the necessity of developing railway enterprise in Persia, such projects only should be supported as shall Railway projeets t° be £ orm either part of the future line of railway communi cation between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, or serve as branches to it. The projects advocated are— (i) Euphrates Valley route. (ii) From Constantinople via Tabriz, Tehran, Mashad, and Herat, or via Isfahan and Karman and along the shore of the Gulf. The course of events appears to indicate that it may run through Nushki, Seistan, Karman,* Isfahan, Burujird, Karmanshah, Baghdad, and thence by one or other of the proposed Euphrates Valley routes, to that point on the Syrian coast affording the most commodious harbour, and at the same time accessible Overland route to from the east. For strategic reasons a line to the south India. of the Euphrates is to be preferred. The physical fea tures of Baluchistan, Persia, and Turkish Arabia are favourable to the cons truction of the line as above projected ; and this is the line, it is submitted, the British Government should favour, it being capable of being controlled throughout. Any line passing through Tehran would be completely under Russian influence, her territory to the north, north-east, and even east of Persia altogether commanding it. Such a Grand Trunk system at Quetta communicates with the net-work of Indian railways, and with branch lines to Kandahar and Kabul, to Tehran and Muhammerah, it would tap the trade of Central Asia and Persia, and immensely develop the resources of the latter country and of Baluchistan. To carry the line further north would be to unnecessarily subject it to both greater physical difficulties of country and to insurmountable political ones; to take it further south would be a commercial blunder, and gain nothing in cost of construction or in point of security, for it has been shown that that power will command it who holds the greater influence in South-West Persia. Persia, taken as a whole, is the most sparcely populated country in the world, and its inhabitants moye little ; it is, however, capable of immense development, and a central line, uniting tlie populous and commercial centres of Mid Persia, is better calculated to develop the greatest area than one running along either its northern or southern extremities, even if the physical features of* the country did not point to it as the natural line to be adopted. The scheme to construct a line from Muhammerah via Shustar to Tehran falls in with this general requirement, and enables Persia to trade in the mean time with the whole world independently of foreign control, and agreeably to her own idiosyncrasies. * Isfahan, Yazd, Karman, Pars, and Karmanshah are the chief opium-growing districts. The Khurasan opium is sent to Yazd to be prepared for the China market {see page 225). Yazd contains 40,000 inhabitants ; Karajan, 41,000 Kurmanshah, 30,000 ; Hamadan, 30,000; Isfahan, 60,000 to 70,000.m That trade from the Gulf with Tehran, Khurasan, and North Persia &lt;*en- Possibility of k ayMe of developing in proportion as the goods hig the Gulf trade. transported by the southern routes are delivered at a cheaper rate than those imported by other roads was shown during' the last Russo-Turkish war, when the northern routes being closed trade by the southern routes largely increased. The routes that enjoyed the major portion of the increased traffic were those of Bushire, Isfahan, Tehran, and Bandar Abbas, Khurasan. The time occupied in the transit of goods from Eng land via Tabriz to Tehran, and of those rid Bushire and Isfahan, is about the same. Consequently any improvement in the latter, or the substitution for it of a shorter route, such as that from Muhammerah via Shustar, is to the advantage of the Gulf trade. In fact, in order that the Gulf trade should even success fully compete with Russian trade in Central Persia, an improvement of the southern trade routes is imperatively demanded. England cannot afford to be second to any in the Gulf either commercially or politically. The firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. estimate that, were the Karun open to Shustar they could deliver goods at Isfahan at 35 krans per load of 350lbs. as a-ainst 00 krans per bad sent from Bushire rid Shiraz; and that, under such condl toms, tlie southern trade could beat that by the north completely out of the held and force back that of Russia to its natural limits. Mr. Mackenzie con siders that the limits of our trade by the southern routes should be Selina Hamadan, hum, \azd, and Birjan. ' Steamers abound in the Guif, but at present little or nothing is carried, the difficulties of carrying on trade with Persia are many. Defective Hiuderances to trade, ‘. l&lt; m ^ n ^riation, want of sympathy between the o , overn- i p , . object races, extortion, absence of all security and of courts in which commercial cases can be decided, &amp;c &amp;c restrict the development of the resources of the country.

B.—The roads enumerated in this report must not be considered to be the only ones traversing the mountains of Luristan; the Iliyat Lurs move in all directions across them, at favourable seasons of the year, accompanied by their flocks. The only roads practicable to an army accompanied by mule carriage are fully described in the body of the work or Appendix A. The routes given in detail were traversed by means of a pocket compass for direction. Distances were determined by time (by watch) and rate of speed and checked by enquiries, and by latitudes and longitudes worked out relatively to Muhammerah, Kum, Isfahan, and Bandar-Dilam [seepage 114). r I ( he Road Reports are copies of the field book kept, written on the spot and on horseback. Times are in all cases given as they serve to indicate the difficulties of the road. Persian mules, over a good track, travel at the rate of three miles an hour. As regards the value of information given by Persians {see page 112). That contained in the following report has been, as far as possible, verified:— For descriptions of the tribes met with en route, see Part II. For a description of the geology of the country to the south of the line Burujird-Isfahan, see Appendix C. This appendix should be read in conjunction with the road reports, as it very fully describes the characters of the strata passed over.

The importance of Muhammerah ceased with the decadence of Shustar and Dizful and the disuse of the Kanin as a trade route. It is still the mart for dates, gin, grain, and wool pro duced in the neighbourhood, and supplies the Arabs with calico, coffee, sugar, &amp;c. Its houses are built of sun-burnt bricks ; its streets are narrow and filthy [see page 199). Its population is about 2,000 (300 families). The best and driest encamping ground is the vacant space within the walls. The town occupies but a small part of the walled enclosure, which is from f to 1 mile long each way; the wall, 10 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base, is surrounded by a narrow and shallow moat. Flanks project at every 100 yards ; at each angle are flanks of considerable size. A mile up the Shatt-al-Arab lives Shaikh Mizal Khan, younger son of the late Hajji Jabir Khan, Chief of Muhammerah and of the Arab tribes in the vicinity. He is well affected towards the British, a partiality which is known to his Persian masters. His elder brother lives at Isfahan, and there intrigues against him. His residence is a commodious one, built on the left bank of the river at a point where a creek runs inland. It is the object of every man in Persia to attract little or no observation to his power and wealth. On this account Shaikh Mizal is said to look with disfavour on the opening of the Kanin to traffic, it being likely to largely increase the wealth of himself and his Arab tribes, and to develop the resources of the country over which he rules—a prosperity likely to produce envy and his downfall. Lieutenant Selby, after a careful survey of the river, pointed out that the advantages of the situation of Muhammerah are that the Kanin lies to its north-east; the Shatt-al-Arab to its north-west; its inhabitants (Arabs) are more active and less bigoted than the Turks ; its situ ation is more salubrious than that of Basra; and its waters (Kanin) cool and invigorating. In our hands he considered that it would become the emporium of trade between Armenia, Arabia, Persia, and India. 1 ersia derives no benefit from the port; political reasons cause her prac tically to close it to commerce (see Part III).

Several ponds to tbe east; pass several mounds 20' high and skirt the river. Tertiary gravels and sandstones now take tbe place of the saliferous alluvium of the lower plains. (See (Revised Gazetteer of Persia.) General Remarks. —The Arab encamp ments met with along the right bank of tbe Kanin were those of Shaikh Mizal of Muhammerah and Mullah (Mula) of Hawizah. The llyats grow corn and barley sufficient for their own require ments alone ; the capabilities of the soil are great, and the land on both hanks of the river for 40 miles below Ahwiiz, and for the same distance inland, is able to grow luxuriant crops of cereals. Mr. Robertson, in a report dated May 1876, remarks :—“At the beginning of winter the Mahaisen and other Arabs, who usually inhabit the date groves about Muhammerah, repair to the Kanin, and, having scratched the surface of the soil with a wooden instrument made for the purpose, sow grain. In the spring they return to reap the result, which may be a hundred fold or nothing, according to the rainfall ” (see pacfe 16S). The wealth of the wandering tribes consists in their flocks of sheep, which are numerous ; of goats (less numerous), and of their herds of donkeys, very numerous; horses and marea (not very plentiful). Cows are few; they and sheep are the most esteemed of their possessions on account of the value of their wool and milk. The milk is churned into raughan or ghf, and in this form exported. Throughout Luristan, Khuzistan, and Ears sheep’s milk is the most highly prized of all milk as being the richest. Lurs cannot understand an European’s preference for cow’s milk. The village is a poor one, of about 300 to 400 inhabitants ; its houses, about 12 feet high, are built of stone or mud, and surrounded by stone walls 5 feet to 10 feet high; the floors are low and damp ; its roads or passages are narrow. The ferry here musters one small boat. The Bauwi tribe of Arabs encamp on the right bank, and the Zengam on the left bank. It is 120 miles from Behbahan ( see page 332). Supplies of grain and live-stock are procurable in small quantities ; the escort of tbe prince, here encamped, say 500 men, drew their supplies of grain from Shustar (seepage 196). Fire-wood is very scarce ; water obtained from the river is of excellent quality, but muddy at times ; grazing good. Three boats, each carrying from 60 to 80 tons, were moored below the river obstructions and laden with grain. Yery little traffic was seen on the river, which, at this season of the year, carries a depth sufficient to take gunboats ; current rapid (March).182 Ahwaz, destroyed towards the end of the Utli century by Timurluk, ceded its place as chief town of Khuzistan to Slmstaij which continued to hold it till 1831-32, when the plague depopulated it. Dizful then came into importance, trade taking the line Amarah on the Tigris via Dizful to Khoram- abad, the neighbourhood of Shustar being infested by Lur robber Captain Wells, r.e., made a careful survey of the river obstructions in 1881, and reports as follows :— “ It will be seen by referring to the sketch that, as the Karun approaches Ahwaz, its course is divided into two parts by an island marked I 1 . “ 1. The branch to the west carries about one-third of the stream, whilst that to the east takes the other two-thirds. The latter is deep and navigable for boats or flats of from -1 feet to 4 feet 6 inches draught, and this is the case with the river up stream as far as Band-i-Kfr.* “ 2. Below the island mentioned above, the river only unites in a stream to be immediately confronted by the obstruction which I will now describe in detail, f “3. A ridge of sandstone, which emerges from the Ram-Hormuz plain some 20 miles east by south of Ahwaz, here approaches the river, and apparent ly it is greatly due to this ridge of rock that the river presents the navigable aspect it does for so many miles above Ahwaz. The rocks form a complete weir across the stream, which, flowing as best it can over the numerous out crops, falls at least 6 feet in three-fourths of a mile of its course. Were it not for this weir, it is doubtful if the nature of the river would not be entirely different. “4. The weir or series of weirs at Ahwaz comprise five principal outcrops of sandstone. “5. No. 1 group is perhaps the most formidable; appearing 25 yards below the island, it narrows the river to 300 yards in width, presenting a double ridge of rock, over which the water roars in times of flood. There are, however, two openings, each of 50 yards in width, in the low wall of rock, and through these the water pours at ordinary times, having a fall of, say, 2 feet 6 inches in a length of 30 yards. a 6. No. 2 group crosses the river 1,100 yards below No. 1, the river having turned 15 degrees to the west to avoid the numerous rocks which crop out from the left bank, but do not extend right across its bed. Considerable accumulations of silt have collected on the rocks on the left, but they do not join the bank; water channels have been cut in rock between them and the bank for the purpose of turning mills {vide plan), and their direction marks the course of a considerable flow of water in flood time. It was along the ridge of group 2 that the ancient band was built, for irrigation purposes, by the Sasanians (?). Remains of this massive structure are still visible, but only high and dry, far out of the present course of the water, which is in a rapid stream between depressions in the rock, and impassable for boats. The ancient band was adapted to the configuration of the rock to the left bank, where the sandstone is high above the river. A loop in the band took in these high rocks, which are pierced by tunnels and sluice channels, for divert ing probably the water into canals for irrigating the country4 * See further on for a modification of this statement. f Pixtracts only are given. + Ifc would se eia that the irrigation canal was not taken out of the river here, but higher up, and that the line marked ‘ c’ on the map represents it. Captain Wells describes the band when the river is at its lowest, i.e., November. In March 1884 the band was scarcely visible, and No. 5 rapid, as remarked further on, was barely recognized.183 The band is about 900 yards across. The cement used is of excellent quality. “ 7. Between group 1 and group 2 a small ferry boat now plies, but has difficulty in avoiding the shallows and rocks. “ 8. No. 3 group is 200 yards below group 2. It is of low flattish rock, and causes rapids. By below is meant down-stream. “ 9. No. 4 group is 200 yards below No. 3; it is of the same character as No. 3. Below this group an island has been formed of silt (marked I 2 on plan), and it divides the river. This island extends down-stream over and beyond group 5. “ 10. No. 6 group causes rapids in the two branches, formed by the island above mentioned, throughout their whole width. “11. Below group 5 the river is narrowed by rocks to a width of 165 yards. Here it becomes deep, and from this point to its mouth is easily navigable by large boats.* “ 12. It would, no doubt, not be difficult to blow out passages in the above- named ridges of sandstone, and leave an uninterrupted way for the river; but it is impossible to predict what effect thus letting loose the pent up water of the Upper Karun would have on the whole bed of the river. “ 13. I calculate roughly that from the narrows down-stream to the island above group No. 1, the river falls from 8 to 10 feet. It may be conceived what a torrent would flow from No. 1 were a free channel cut for the water from it to the narrows. “ 14. The whole of the rocks, &amp;c., within the present limits of the river banks are liable to be swept by floods. Therefore, supposing a canal were cut in the rock in the direction shown in dotted lines on plan, which w^ould bedhe least expensive way as regards excavation, yet the difficulty of protecting the lock gates from damage at the up-stream end, and the difficulty and cost of protecting the canal with masonry from being silted up by the spill of the river in flood time, would, I think, make this plan inadmissible; besides more than two locks would be required. “ 15. The best plan, in my opinion, would be to dig a canal from the nar rows at (A) to the pool above Ahwaz at (B), following the double firm line on plan. Two locks would be required— viz., one at A and one at B ; and, no doubt, sandstone would be met with for the greater part of the length (2,350 yards), vet, once the work executed, these same sandstone w r alls to the canal w r ould be of the greatest benefit, and would never be a cause of expense, like the banks of most navigable waterways. Again, the sandstone would form excellent w r alls to the locks, and greatly lessen the cost of their construction, as the locks could be placed wherever the rock was best, and need not necessarily be at A or B. “ 16. Between A and B, along the double firm line shown on plan, there would probably never be more than 35 feet of excavation required, even if the canal were to be S feet deep {see farther on). “17. As a temporary measure, a wharf might be constructed on piles in the pool at A and in the still water below the narrows at B, where native boats are now in the habit of lying; and these two points be connected by means of a tramway, which could be laid with very little labour, the ground being nearly level, and goods transhipped thus from the lower to the upper river, or vice versa. With this tramway irrigation canals would not be inter fered with, if led from either side of the river above No. 1 group; but, even with the locks at work, there would be a very small waste of water, unless the # See further on for a modification of this statement.184 traffic became very great. However, there is enough good ground about Shustar to be developed without irrigating that below the band for many a year.” With reference to Captain Well’s report, it should be noted that the high ground on which Ahwaz stands is elevated from 10' ana piojic . ^ ] 5 ' above the country to its eastward, and runs from the point B on plan, round the village and mosque, to rapid No. 3, above the ancient tunnel through the rock. To the eastward of the tunnel runs a low ridge of sandstone. In excavating the canal proposed, the deepest cutting required is to the south of point B, and it is judged that to construct it, so that it shall have a 10' depth throughout, below points A and B, the average cutting would not exceed 20' in depth (cutting below B 25'). It is difficult to estimate the amount of sandstone that would be met with in its excavation ; in places it seemed to have a considerable covering of sand and clay, and that these alternated with it in layers. To the eastward of Captain Well’s proposed line of canal, not a difficult or costly project, lies, abreast of Ahwaz, a gently undulating and open fertile plain, slopes of 2° and 3°; and below the low sandstone ridge, abreast of No. 3 rapid, a level plain of sand and clay covered with loose stones. Without doubt a canal about lOO' wide did at one time exist to the eastward of Ahwaz, and perhaps connecting the river below the rapids, near the point A, with the river some distance above the point B; for by the indentation of the ground, the luxuriance of the crops grown in it, &amp;c., its line can be clearly traced, and where it cut through the ridge of sandstone, abreast of No. 1 falls, there is still the remains of a bridge of two arches. The low ground, between the ruined bridge and the river to the north-westward, no doubt taken advantage of or caused by the canal, pnables the lower northern slopes of the hills to be seen from the opposite bank of the river. r Ihis line of old canal is marked ‘ C ’ on plan. If * right in the above conjecture, it might prove less expensive to re-open tins old line of canal to excavating a new one j its line on the accompanying plain shows it to lie a few hundred yards to the eastward of the Ahwaz ridge. Again, it would seem that the tunnel, or rather cut, through the rock near No. 3 rapid was in some way connected with a canal either for navigation or irrigation. Rapid iN o. 5 is no formidable obstacle, and in IVIarch, when the river was moderately full, was scarcely perceptible. A cheap and feasible project would therefore seem to be to run the canal from B, under the high ground on which the village stands, by the cut through the rock south of obstacle No. 2, to a point C, below rapid No. 4, cutting an in-shore channel round No. 5 rapid. This diversion from Captain Well’s line is marked ( A ’ on plan. This channel would in no way affect the river up-stream. The lock at C would be well protected, and the length of canal be but 1,600 yards, with an average depth of cutting estimated at 20 feet, by no means altogether through rock, lo cheaply avoid transhipment is far preferable to a tramway, or the use of transport animals.

II. —The crest of this ridge, rising 50' to 100', faced on the south by low, open undulations, with slopes of 2° and 3°, forms a strong position facing in that direction. The hills, however, have no depth, and their northern slopes are steep, and beyond them lies a flat cultivated plain, both of which can be taken in reverse by fire from the right bank. The hills break off on the left bank of the river, and do not again rise until about 4 or 5 miles beyond its right bank. III. —The fort occupies the high ground abreast of No. 1 falls. It is a rect angular work of no strength, and practically unflanked, of 200' side, and com- p ort mandof 15' to 18'. Its walls are of stone and mud, and constitute the front walls of a series of barracks built round an open courtyard. The total depth of the barracks is 20' ; their roofs are flat, and round them runs a low parapet wall capable of being manned by infantry. The entrance is to the north, and is closed by gates of no strength. For remai’ks on the political and commercial value of the Karun river, see Part III. The river at this season between Ahwaz and Muhammerah is said to carry Karun river. nothing under 12/ In the dry season it does not carry in places over 3' or 4', the minimum depth of 3' being met with in the autumn at Ismailiyah. Beilams (ballams),small boats, 15' to 20' long, 3' wide, and flat bottomed, carrying one to two tons of merchandise, can be tracked up stream in March from Muhammerah to Ahwaz in four or five days ; provided with a large sail, they ply down-streaki. From the Karun, below Shustar, to the Bahmeh-Slur, its mouth, numerous canals and water-courses have been drawn. Their beds are now elevated above the river, even when the stream is highest. All seen were dry. The principal part of the waters of the Karun (three-fourths) discharge into the Shat-ahArab by the Haffar canal, 3 miles long, 300 to 400 yards broad, with a depth of 20 to 30'. Both banks are lined with date trees. Muhammerah stands on its right bank, half a mile up it {see pages 41,178). The Bahmeh-Shir carries 7' over its worst shallows at low tide, and is about liahmeh-Slnr half a mile wide. It is now little used, and appears to be becoming shallower yearly. The rise of tide varies between 8' and 10'. A couple of miles above Gisbah or Kusbeh, on the left bank, is the entrance to the Dorak canal, connecting the rivers Karun and Jarrahi, now navigable only by beilams {see page 47). Dorak or Felahiyahis oneof the chief towns of the Shaikhs of the Chab Arabs (Ka’b). At Idnsiyah is a small town and fort on the left bank. Ismailiyah carries on a small trade.

The Riid-i-Buzurg-i- Shustar is, at its mouth, about 400 yards wide, narrowing a few miles up-stream to 200 yards ; it was said to carry the greater volume of water to Shustar, where it again unites with the Ab-i-Boleiti, but not to be used for navigation on account of the obstructions in its bed. The Rud-i-Dizful is about 100 yards wide, and was said to be partially navigable {see page 196.)

The ground south of the town is uneven ; the poppy is extensively cultivated on either bank. Above the bridge the banks of the Ab-i- Khurd are also well wooded, and the ground along its left bank well cultivated, and slopes upwards to the city. To the northward the ground slopes down ward towards the Ab-i-Shateit. The timber is suited for bridging purposes (crib piers). Three gates give access to the city on either side. The town walls are in ruins, and its outskirts are in ruins; an enclosed enceinte could readily be formed out of its debris, stone being plentiful every where. The town occupies a space not exceeding one mile square, and, as above described, is situated on a slightly elevated site. The Ab-i-Gargar, a canal whose water is drawn from the Karun, and across the mouth of which runs the Band-i-Kaisar, washes it on the east, flowing in a bed 120' to 200' wide, between perpendicular clilfs 50'to 100'high, consisting of clay with embedded masses of soft limestone [see page 349). To the north the hills, miles distant, and the rising ground beyond the river command the town ; to the east of the Gargar rising ground also com mands it; yet the ruined outskirts are so deep and the streets so narrow that bombardment by light artillery would cause little damage. To the west, round by south, the Ab-i-Khurd, a canal taken out of the Ab-i-Shateit at Valerian's bridge, and falling into the Gargar below the Pul-i-Lashkar, completes the water defence on that side. Again, to its west, lies the Ab-i-Shateit itself. The streets of the town are 8' to 10' wide; worn into deep ruts, they are Town most difficult to traverse, and are quite impassable to wheels; they are the city drains (see Dizful, page 199 ). The walls of the houses are high for those of the east, 15' to 25' and 30', and are solidly constructed of stone and lime or mud. The roofs are mostly flat, of mud over wooden rafters; some are arched; the bricks in use are about l^' thick. Numerous arcades exist in the town, many of which are in ruins. The fort, 350 to 400 yards long x 150 yards wide, stands on high ground F irt 200 yards above Valerian's bridge; the citadel occu pies its north-east angle, and dominates its interior. Its outer walls, 15' to 20' high, are of mud, 6' thick, and backed by casemates with pointed arched doorways opening into the interior, now a poppy garden. The roofs of the casemates are flat. A canal from the Ab-i-Shateit flows into a tunnel under the fort, from which water is drawn by wells. Branches from this tunnel supply the city with water. Arms and ammunition were said to be stored in the fort. It mounts no artillery. The Ab-i-Gargar washes its northern face; houses crowd upon its other faces.

Kaisar „ Band-i-Shahzadah, and below the fort. It is built on the Band-i-Mizan. The spans of the arches are small, generally under 15'; some may equal 20'. It holds up the water of the Karun, and forces a considerable volume of it into the Ab-i-Khurd or Ab-i-Miyandab or Nahr-i-Dariyan, a canal whose mouth is just above the left bank abutments of the bridge. This canal is said to be ford able everywhere after it issues from its excavated bed. Its channel, immediately192 under the ruined walls of the west face of the town, seems to have been built wit h the greatest care. When full, this canal irrigates the district of Miyandab t 0 the extent of 10 or 12 miles south of Shustar. The Ab-i-Khurd forms a ditch on the southern side of the town. When seen, there was a difference of level of 8 to 10' between the waters above and below the bridge. Bp. tween the Band-i-Kaisar and the Band-i-Mizan the bed of the river is said to be paved with hewn stone joined by metal clamps. Water was flowing over the Band-i-Kaisar (concave up stream) when visited. At times the band is dry, and may be traversed on foot, six narrow openings being left for the passage of the water. The Pul or Band-i-Gargar is an embankment thrown across the Ab-i- Garg ir, about 800 yards below the Band-i-Kaisar, connecting the town with its suburb, the village of Boleiti. The water of the canal is carried round the band through four tunnels, two under either bank, excavated in the sandstone rock, and turns numerous small mills, the mechanical construction of which are most defective. Below the band the canal is 120' wide, and its bed 50' deep. A few hundred yards below the Pul-i-Gargar is a second band, over which water was flowing when visited. The final band across the canal, and over which water was also flowing, is situated about 4 miles down-stream, below the Pul-i-Shah Ali. Shustar, once the capital town of Khuzistan, is now second in import* ance to Dizful. The number of its inhabitants, from 45,000, has dwindled within the last century to 0,000; its trade is now insignificant and its bazar untenanted—a decadence attri buted by the inhabitants themselves to oflicial exactions and a total want of all government (xecpage* 4, 6, 7, 90). Selby considers the character of the Shustaries to be far superior to that of! he Persians generally {■seepage 100) , and remarked that, “ although oppressed, yet they themselves did not oppress, nor did they fawn when in your power; they hate the Persians.^ Other travellers have painted them in less favourable colours. So far as could be judged, the bigotry assigned to them formerly does not now exist. The race is the result of the intercourse between Arabians ard Persians. Shustar is so isolated from Persia Proper by the Zagros range, that, did the opportunity offer, they would doubtless join the Lur and Arab tribes, living within and to the south of those mountains, in revolt against their Persian masters {^ee page 154, and Part, III, Strategical considerations). The plague and cholera morbus in 1881-32 depopulated Shustar; the Health general salubrity of the district is good {see page 67). b rom the foregoing description it will be seen that Shustar ofccupies a Importance of Shustar. s ^ e important, both politically and commercially :— J; Politically, on account of its natural military strength ; its geographic?! position with reference to the tribes of Arabs occupying the coast plains to the foot of the hills, and the Iliyat tribes of Lurs, Bakhtfaris, Kashkai, Kiihgehlu, &amp;c., occupying the mountainous country extending to the line Burujird-Isfahan, all more or less disaffected towards their extortionate Persian masters; the pressure which the possibility of its occupation by troops could not fail to bring on the Tehran Court; and the paramount influence over South-\\ est Persia, which would follow of the establishment firm relations there.25 .193 (%&gt; IT.—Commercially, because its position on the Karun river, with water com munication with India, lessens the land route to Tehran by 137 miles, and brings it within 485 miles and Isfahan within 27r miles ofa port, and must lead to the attraction of much trade from the fertile districts of Hamadan and Karmanshah, and to a successful competition with Russian trade from the north. In the hands of a mercantile nation, Shustar could not fail to become the first commercial town of Persia {see Part TII). The present governor 0 f the town is Mirza Asadulla Khan, and the revenue of the town and district 23,000 tomans. In 1810 it amounted to 20,000 tomans—10,000 from the town, and 10,000 from outlying villages and nomads. For Oeolorj// of the district, see p &gt;ge 349, Appe-udijc C . Many opinions have been given upon the practicability of opening up the navigation of the Karun river, some favourable, Navigation of the Karun. othe r S unfavourable, all of which will be found fully recorded in the Karen river precis 1879-83 (Indian Foreign Department, Confidential Paper). From viewing the river in March and April 1884, Major Bell concluded that its navigation would be feasible at all seasons for Hat-bottomed boats of a burden up to 50 tons provided with expansive sails similar to those navigating the Indus at Sukkur, and for flat-bottomed steamers drawing 3' to 4', similar to those navigating the Tigris to Baghdad, of 400 tons burden and 100 horse-power {see page 109). The boats navigating the Karun vary in burden from 5 to 70 tons; in form they are wedge-shaped with a raking prow, flat bottoms, and a raised open poop for the accommoda tion of the crew. The mast, placed somewhat forward, leans considerably to the front, and carries one expansivesail. A boat, 90 / long, 20 / wide, carries 70 tons and draws 7' 3 // {Chesney). The steamer Kanin, in the possession of Shaikh Mizal, is of 120 tons, and draws about 3 feet. It has done the journey from Muhammerah to Ahwaz, travelling all night, in 23 hours, in charge of her Arab captain. It may therefore be assumed that, allowing 5 hours for detention at Ahwaz for the steamer to pass through the canal, or for the transhipment of cargo, and 12 hours for the passage between Ahwaz and Shiistar, a steamer from Mu hammerah, when the current is not at its swiftest (June to December), could reach the latter place in 40 hours, or say 2 days {see next page). The possibility of cheaply and effectively turning the river obstructions at Ahwaz has already been considered {see page 1S2). That there is little or no trallic on the river is due to Shustar and Dizful being cut off fr &gt;m communi cation with the large towns of the north by the Lurs refusing to allow caravans to pass between the latter place and Khoramabad. The Zil-ul-Sultan, the ruler of Luristan, is quite able, by the exercise of his legitimate power, to bring the few rebellious tribes, through whose pastures the road passes, to reason, and to render it perfectly secure {see page 170). Were this done, a canal with locks constructed at Ahwaz, and stimulus given to the boat traffic which has fallen out of use, much might be done towards the revival of trade along this route, even without the introduction of a single steamer, upon the waters of the Karun. Were trade revived, Shustar and Dizful, once important commercial centres, but now unimportant towns, would regain their*former importance, and with it would of necessity follow the improvement of the mule roads between * The fact of the Atabegs of Luristan having in the 13th century constructed a good road across the Hakhtfari hills to Isfahan, adds force to this conjecture, and doubtless the decay of the r ad was coeval with the decadence of Shustar and Dizful as commercial centres. Remains of extensive cities at Band-i-Kir, Ahwaz, also point to the ancient commercial value of the Karun river (.ves ante ).194 Shustar ami Isfahan, Khoramabad and Gulpaigan, as well as Ali-Gddar and (see page 259) Akhora-Ba!a. Beyond the construction, in the first instance, of roads fit for laden mules and mule litters through the hills nothing is required.; such roads would cost little, but it is questionable whether the Persians themselves can construct them, as they have no proper hill road-making tools, and are almost ignorant of blasting (see page 110). Nor would the opening of the Kanin be viewed with indifference by the Shaikh of Muhammerah, if what was reported be true; it would increase his wealth, but it would at the same time draw down upon him the cupidity of his Persian masters, and even tually lead to his fall ; and he is said not to favour the idea, much as he leans towards the British (see page 178). Mr. Mackenzie is of opinion that steam vessels towing rafts could make the ascent to Ahwaz in 50 hours and the descent in 20. The steam launch of Shaikh Mizal made the ascent in five days and the descent in 12 hours in April 1884. The whole question of the advantage of opening the Karun to navigation depends wholly on the security of the road between Dizful and Khoramabad, for the road itself, even unimproved, is better than any other of the kali la roads leading to the central plateau of Persia between Bushire and Muham merah (see Part 111, Commercial considerations). That the river is capable of being navigated in the early spring by steam ers is shown by the following notes abstracted from Yol. XIV of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society :— N.B. —It should be noted that the firewood which grew so plentifully along the banks of the rivers Karun, Dizful, and Gargar in 1842 had almost dis appeared in 1884. Lieutenant Selby, who carefully explored in 1842 both the branches of the Karun as far as Shustar and the Ab-i-Dizful to within a few miles of it, con siders them to be well suited to navigation—an opinion in which most travel lers have since concurred. These are the high roads into the very heart of Persia, and the civilization of the country demands that they should be opened up to trathc. The country they traverse is healthy and fertile; friendly tribes inhabit it. All considera tions point to them as a means whereby our political and commercial interests may be increased. The seasons during which rain falls, followed by that of the melting of the snow, i.e.^ from December to June, are the months during which the waters of the Karun and its alfiuents are at the highest; their rise and fall is irregu lar. In 1842, the highest rise was in February, and equalled 12'. They are not fordable between the sea and Shustar. Ihe Assyria took 5 days to reach Shustar from Muhammerah by the main river, including delays in cutting wood* and a detention of 10 hours. She anchored every evening. The navigation presented no ditficulties. By the Ab-i-Gargar, and after the establishment of fuel depots, Lieutenant Selby was of opinion that the Assyria could have reached Shustar in 2| days. The fittest stations above Muhammerah are— Kal’a Idrisiyah, left bank Ahwaz, left bank Band-i-Kir, right bank Shustar, by main river „ by Ab-i-Gargar Hours. 18 16 10 10 8 * i * ^ a j or Bell saw no nearer approach to wo id than the tamarisk bush, a very poor ue or eating the boilers of a steamer.

When the water is high, 'the shoals at Rubein-ibn-Yakub and Ismailiyah, the chief obstructions in its course, offer no difficulties. The two lower bands at Ahwaz were crossed, and the third or principal band was passed, by aid of a hawser, towards the right bank, by the opening there, 40 yards broad, through which the stream rushed with a velocity of between 5 and 6 miles an hour, the river at the time being at its ordinary spring level. The fourth band was S 7 or 9' under water, and was easily passed. In the preceding June, when the stream was comparatively low, the Assyria had reached Ahwaz with much greater ease. Between Ahwaz and the natural band, 7 miles below Shustar, the river offered no difficulties to the passage of the Assy ria ; the lowest water met with was 4 7 ; its current was 3 miles an hour. Ihe river has here worked a bed, through which it rushes with violence, not sufficient, however to prevent the passage of a steamer, which at this time of the year could ascend to Valerian’s bridge. This branch, the Ab-i-Shateit, is more rapid, shal low, and winding than the Ab-i-Gargar. Its banks are fringed with stout poplars, and are well covered with grass in April. The soil is a rich alluvium. The Ab-i-Gargar carried generally 3 fathoms (February), and was ascended bv the Assyria to the Matff-Bazan Band. Its current Ab-i-Gargar. was sluggish. It carries 12/ at the lowest season. Its average width is 60 to 120 yards. Nearing Shustar, its current increases to 5 miles an hour. Its former bed was considerably higher than its present one; it falls suddenly at Shustar about 20 7 . The present depth of its bed and width of its channel in places is due to the Band-i-Mizan having given way, and the major portion of the waters of the Ka*run having forced their way down it—a natural occurrence if the relative positions of its proper bed and Ab-i-Gargar be considered [see plait). The Assyria stopped only one mile short of Shustar, where a natural ledge of rocks bars the river, and through which there is an opening, 10 yards wide, affording a passage to boats of 20 tons’ burden ; wood abounded along the banks. In October 1876, Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, then Officiating Political Resident, Persian Gulf, went 50 miles up the Kanin river in the steam launch of Hajji Jabir Khan, Gov- Navigated in October 1876 e vnor of Muhammerah. The river appeared to him (partial). shallow in proportion to its breadth, and the steam launch, which drew 3' of water, several times bumped on sand banks. He doubted whether the river could be navigable, at any season, for any vessel unless of very light draft. His impression, which was based on the informa tion he received, as well as on actual observation, was that the river was but ill-adapted for a commercial highway. In October the river is at its lowest. The Ab-i-Gargar was originally a canal, dug by Muhammad AliMfrza, son Ab-i-Gar ar Fateh Ali Shah, for irrigation purposes. Mr. Robertson, who passed up it early in April 1876, thus reports : “ It now winds excessively, and is difficult to ascend by boat at this season, owing to its depth, strong current, and the overhanging trees which cover its banks. We progressed slowly by dragging the boats from branch to branch of the trees, where other modes of proceeding were impracticable. The journey took three days from Band-i-Kir. Boats cannot be obtained at Shustar.196 By raft, the down journey from Shustar to Band-i-Kir, via the Ab-i-Sha- teit, was made in 20 hours. The risks of being 1 plundered when journeying on this arm of the river, or on the Dizfiil river, are great. The journey down the Karun from Band-i-Kfr to Muhammerah took between 4 and 5 days in a ballam. The Assyria ascended (February) the Ab-i-Dizfiil to the vicinity of KaFa Ab-i-Dizful. Bandar, the soundings averaging 3 fathoms; nothing under 6' was met with. Here obstructions were encoun tered; and although at this season the river can be ascended several miles higher, the current becomes very rapid, and the pebbly bottom increases the difficulty of disengaging a vessel which has run aground. At KaPa Bandar, the natural band running half across the river increases its current. The river is tortuous and its current sluggish. The Arabs occupying its banks, the Anafigah (see page o6) and Al Hadhar, are well disposed, but great robbers. Lieutenant Selby considered that vessels of the Indus Steam Vessel Navigation Company could traverse it all the year round. Its banks were well wooded. In April the current of all the above rivers is rapid, and tracking up them a work of labour. Little is known of the Ab-i-Dizful from the point at which it enters the Bakhtiari hills, at the Tang-i-Bahrein {see pages 201, 255), to the point of its exit out of them, 10 miles to the north-east of Dizful. The plains about Shustar become covered with grass on the cessation Shustar plain. ^ ie ra i ns ( en d of February); the grass increases until May; after May it disappears as quickly as it comes, and the whole country becomes a parched and barren desert. The grass Grass. along the banks of the Kharkha and Shawur or Shaour rivers becomes so thick in April and May that it is difficult to ride through it. The plains below Shustar are capable of producing almost everything; Cultivation and produce. the country enclosed by the two arms of the Kanin , ^s south, grows sugarcane, opium, indigo, cereals, and cotton. Strabo records that the Shustar dependencies yielded to the husbandman one hundred to two hundred fold. I he autumn sowings of wheat and barlev, the “ shatwL” takes place in the end of November. “ 1 -the “saifi” or spring sowings consist of cotton, rice, maize, sesame, tobacco, vegetables, &amp;c. Shustar is considered by Sir H. Bawlinson to be one of the best supplied districts in Asia. Barley sells in the spring at 45 lbs. the kran (8^.), and wheat at lbs. A _ sheep weighing 30 lbs. will cost 4 krans. The culti vation ol grains requires to be encouraged to ensure a large export trade in i resu ting. leavy contributions levied upon the peasants have driven them from this fertile district [see pages 4, 6‘, 7, 174).

There is no activity in the bazar of either town from remediable causes already explained (seepage 7 ), and the extortion and want of security inseparable from an Oriental despotism (seepages 90,100). In my presence, and the presence of the Naib Vizier and Deputy Governor, it was openly stated that no government, or justice, or rule of any sort existed ; that exactions and insecurity of property had ruined all trade, and that any invader, who could change the existing order of things, would be welcomed with joy. The alternative road from Shustar passes through the village of Kaounek (6 farsakhs from Dizful), where Darab Khan, a Bakhtiari of Kal’a-i-Tul, with a section of the tribe, resided in 1882. Along it the line of telegraph runs. Between this road and the hills lies the low sandstone ridge referred to as bordering the plain traversed between Ab-i-Bid and Dizful; to its west lies a vast level plain as far as the eye can reach. The soil is rich, but uncultivated ; it was formerly watered by a canal drawn from the Kanin. Vicinity of Dizful- Dizful stands on the left bank of the Ab-i-Dizful in a well cultivated plain, sloping very gradually upwards to the hills, which are 15 miles distant from it in a northerly direction. The Ab-i-Dizful, here unfordable, flows in a well defined bed, 500 yards wide, Rlver between conglomerate cliffs, those of the right bank, above stream, rising to a height of 40'; the cliffs on the left bank are of less height and commanded, but the plain beyond them slop ing gradually upwards, the command is soon lost, and the town stands out in bold relief, both when viewed from the north as well as the south. See pages olo, 349, for geology of the district and the road traversed to Khoramdbdd. The houses of the town are well built of stone or mud, chiefly the former; Town roofs flat; the rooms are fairly lofty and spacious, and built round a courtyard surrounded by high walls. The majority of the houses are provided with “ sardabs ” [see page 345). The outskirts of the town are in ruins ; the centre portion is well preserved ; the streets are narrow and dirty, with a deep narrow centre rut adding to their impassability. Carts could not traverse them; laden mules and donkeys with difficulty pass each other. There is a sanitary feature of the towns of Muham merah, Shustar, and Dizful worthy of note. It is that the streets are also open Insanitary condition. d L raius and cess-pits. The latrines consist of openings in the roofs of the houses communicating directly by ducts through the outer walls with the streets. Persians seem not to object to this insanitary state of affairs and to be unconscious of the odours arising from it; for no less than three such outlets face the apartments of the palace200 occupied daily by the Prince. During the Prince's absence. Major Bell was offered the use of his apartments, but was compelled to excuse himself the honour. If it were not for this unsanitary arrangement, Dizfiil would furnish excellent billets. The number of its houses is said to be between 3,500 and 4,000. Ophthalmia seems prevalent at both Shustar and Dizful [seepages 61 to 68). Owing to the narrowness of the streets and the solid nature of the houses, a j) efcnce defensible enceinte could readily be constructed on the sides exposed to a land attack, and for the same reasons a bombardment would occasion little or no loss. The river water is of excellent quality ; supplies plentiful; population about 10,000 (said to be between Supplies, &amp;c. 10,000 and 20,000). Camp. The best camping ground for troops lies to the north of the bridge near the Prince's pleasure-house. Its inhabitants are mostly Persians. The Persian dress consists of a shirt T , of cotton or silk and loose pyjamah like trousers Inhabitants, and dress. &lt;_• i i .1 • t r 1 .... r\ .1 tied round the waist, or cloth or cotton. Over these is worn a tight, collarless garment, of chintz, with sleeves loose from the elbow [the alkaluk). Over the latter is worn a cloth tunic (or of cotton) with a stand- up coll ir, buttoning down the front, and pleated at the waist. The tunics worn by officials reach to the knee ; those worn by merchants are much longer; merchants much affect the aba [see page 190). The peasants wear blue cottons, and for warmth felt cloaks half an inch thick. The kamarband is almost universally worn out of doors. Turbans are worn by priests and merchants. Saiyids wear green puggeries. The usual head-dress is the hat of black cloth or sheep skin on a frame work of paste-board of various heights. It was said that the chief supply of cotton and coloured piece-goods came Tratle from Bombay via Muhammerah, and thence by land; but that broadcloth was chiefly received from Russia. Russian broadcloth was said to be cheaper and better than English. Their cottons are also said to be stronger. No opium is grown in the neighbourhood, the principal product being indigo. Opium. There are 120 indigo factories in Dizful, which turn out on an average maunds a day each, the yearly produce being estimated at between 700 to S00 kharwars, the kharwar Indigo. containing 100 Tabriz maunds, or about 650 lbs. It is said that both soil and climate are extremely favoura ble to the production of indigo, and did the people only understand the preparation better, a considerable trade would spring up. As it is, lime and other ingredients are used in its preparation, and the quality is thus greatly deteriorated [Baring). Asad Khan is at present Governor of the Dizful district. The revenue of the town and district amounts to 40,000 tomans. Tomb of David and mounds of Shush or Susa [ancient capital of Susiana). The tomb of David, situated on the river Shaour or Shawur, is one stage of 15 miles from Dizful. Crossing the bridge a well cultivated plain, inter sected by numerous water-courses, is crossed, till the Arab village of Shouhour is reached. Rice is largely grown in the vicinity, and the road is in places deep in mud. After passing an affluent of the Ab-i-Diz (iialarud), the201 26 ground gets drier. Passing an imamzada set in trees, and crossing another stream, the tomb is reached. The country is well covered with shrubs of tama risk and aspen and the Salix Babylovica, half willow, half poplar; it abounds in game, francolin, hares, geese, quail, rock partridge, and wild boar, being plentiful. There are also said to be lions in the forest that here skirts the banks of the Karkha stream. The Arabs are of the AH Ketlnr or Kessir tribe ; they are not nomads, and do not enjoy a good reputation. An escort is always necessary from Dizful, and at times the country cannot be traversed without great risks. There is a small Arab village near the tomb [seepage 56). The surrounding country is noted for its beautiful ^ iass ' herbage. The mounds of Shush are overgrown with brushwood and thistles. From them Dizful is visible, bearing N. bb° E.; they are 6 4 miles from the river; the country becomes very difficult after rain. The Shaour river, although only 10 yards wide, when swollen, must be forded at Amm-el-Timmen or Ammat-ul- Zimmen, 16 miles below the tomb. Account of a journey to KaV a-i-Diz by Mr. Bobertson, Consul, in 1876 (April). “On the 18th April, I went to see KaFa Diz, a natural stronghold of the Bakhtian in the hills, about IS miles from Dizful. Hussain Kuli Khan’s agent in that part of the country accompanied me to prevent annoyance from the Lur inhabitants, who treat all strangers found off the caravan routes as intru ders and enemies. For live miles the road led over the plain parallel with the river. Then we crossed the almost dry bed of a tributary stream and began to ascend the hills, which are here entirely composed of gravel, and tremen dously cut up by the action of rain. Bitter almond bushes are plentiful, and pools of excellent water occur frequently at this season. The road was good until we neared the KaPa, when we descended into a gully and climbed the other side of it by unpleasantly abrupt paths. Then we descended into a broad green valley, intersected by streams, and dotted with Lur encampments, near one of which we pitched our tents. ” “On the 20th I climbed to the top of the Kal’a, or stronghold of Diz, which is an elevated table-land of considerable extent with perpendicular sides, nowhere less than 150 feet in height. The top is reached by a single arti ficial path, partly dug into the face of the cliff, and partly consisting of brush wood supported on trunks of trees, which can easily be thrown down and burnt, after which there is no way up. On the table-land are some huts and habitable caves, several springs of water, and a few square miles of cultivated land. To this stronghold the Bakhtian chiefs used in former times, when pressed by the Persians, to z-etire. It was often invested for years together, but never taken. ” The above description of a “ diz, ” a hill formation, so common in the Bakh- tfarihills,applies to all jotfye 70). It is reckoned Dlz ‘ to be the strongest hill fort in the kingdom. From the Tang-i-Bahrein, the point at which the two western arms of the river, after junction, enter the Luristan hills, the Dizful Dizful mer. river forces its way through a succession of chasms and gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly impracticable; indeed, this part of the range of Zagros is so very precipitious, that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird ; it is followed by Iliyats on foot ; it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is consideied tl e20*2 most difficult of all the mountain pathways [seepages 196,256).

Kubbed or Kuh-i-Kabir, a range of barren steep bills, much cut up by deep crevices ; the range is said to extend to the vicinity of Baghdad. The dip of the hill strata is great. A mile south of the camp the Ab-i-Zal falls into the Saimarrah stream, which Hows from „ . the westward on a general bearing of 305°, and here breaking arknah river. through the Kuh-i-Kubbed finds its way, as the Karkhah river, past Hawizah into the Tigris. After leaving the Kal’a-ltezza valley, it winds for many miles amongst the low conglomer ate bills, running parallel with the Kuh-i-Kabir. At its entrance into the plain, 20 to 30 miles, to the north-west of Dizful, are the remains of a bridge known as the Pai-Pul. During the summer months the river is fordable below the bridge. On account of the rapidity of the stream caravans prefer to cross it at the Twan-i-Karkhah, where the river divides into several branches. Near Daniel’s tomb it flows within 5 miles of the Ab-i-Di/.fiil. The river formerly flowed through Hawizah into the Shatt-al-Arab, and was navigable for boats of some size as far as that town. In 1837, owing to the giving way of the band above Hawizah, the river deserted its old course and divided into innumerable small streams, which collected together again only 8 miles from its mouth. The river is only navigated now by beilams (see page 49). — (Layard). Several remains of masonry bridges mark the attempts made to bridge the Ab-i-Zal. The Lurs have hitherto destroyed all bridges, caravanserais, &amp;c., &amp;c., constructed on this line through their hills (see page 170). The valley is destitute of trees and firewood. By bringing trees from long distances, after two days’ labour the tribe contrived to throw a rough bridge across the stream, at a point where rocks contracted it to a width of from 15 to 20 feet. General Remarks .—A forced march was made from Dizful to the Ab-i-Zal to avoid the Lur robbers who infested the country. After dark to 2-30 a.m. the light of the moon sufficed to enable the near surrounding country to be seen. After the moon set to dawn, a succession of difficult ravines were crossed, which were, however, traversed by the laden mules with ease in the dark. Caravans could halt either at the Balarud or on any of the ridges crossed. Water and pasture is plentiful everywhere. Reeds grow in the ravines and furnish firewood. The plateau selected as stage No. 10 is the best suited for an encampment of any size being a mile or more broad. The amount of road-making to be done (zigzagging into and out of ravines) between a few miles to the south of Kal’a Hussaineh and the Bidruge plain will exceed that in any other equal distance on the line of this passage through the hills. The remaining por tions of the road present no great difficulties.

Jai(lar The fertile plain of Jaidar lies 8 miles to the north. Its pas tures are described as most excellent. The plain of Saimarrah stretches north-west about 40 miles, and varies in breadth from 5 Saimarrah plain. to 10 miles between Kabir Kuh and the Karkhah. It is cultivated by the Amalah division of Pish-Kuh, and also affords pasturage to at least 1,000 families from the other tribes of Luristan. The direct roads to Zohab and to Harunabad and Kaiunanshah leads over the plain and that of .Jaidar [see Revised Gazetteer of Persia, Routes). Neither presents any insur mountable difficulties to the passage of artillery. The ascent over the pass is winding and stony, generally of good width.

At times it carries a large volume of water (See Revised Gazetteer of Persia.) . , 'the Bala-Hisar is built on the summit of a solitary steep rock, near the centre of the gorge, and close to the right bank of the river. Near its summit is a copious stream. Round about its base are line gardens, well irrigated, and dwelling houses, &amp;c., enclosed by walls of no strength, about 15'high. It contains about 2,000 inhabitants, and is the residence of the ruler of the Luristan district, extending southward across the Lur hills to Dizful. The town is rapidly falling into ruins. Trade was most inactive owing to the insecurity of the Dizful road (1884). There is here a Persian Post and telegraph office {see page 110). _ . Its roads are narrow and difficult to traverse; its houses, said to number j.,000, are chietty of mud ; roofs flat; bazar of insignificant size. The camping ground, suited for one brigade, lies to the west of the town. The river here breaks through a range of rocky hills stretching across the plain in the usual north-west direction, leaving standing the solitary rock, nearly 1,000 yards in circumference, upon which the fort is built. There are two roads from Khoramabiid to Bdrujird. The route taken by De Bode is the most direct, but tents are met with along it only during the summer months. Caravans, &amp;c., prefer that taken and now described. N.B.— With reference to the practicability of constructing a cart-road from 3fuhdim mer ah to Khoramdbdd, it may be here convenient to note Cart road to Khoramibad. that from Muhammerah to Dizful, 178 miles, the conn- try is practically a level alluvial flat, to construct a road across which raising and ditching only is required; road metal can be obtained from the hills about Ahwdz, Shustar, and Dizful. From Dizful to Khoramdbdd, a distance of 157 miles, with reference to the facilities of constructing a cart-road, the tract has been classed as good, fair and bad ; the good, 57 miles, is level and requires nothing to be done to it beyond the removal of loose boulders to the existence of which Lurs are quite callous ; the fair, 60 miles, requires to be widened and cleared of stones ; the bad, 40 miles, requires to be widened and to be zigzagged in places to lessen the gradients; in the ravines or passes large boulders will require to be blasted, otherwise there is little rock-cutting required and picks, croio bars, levers, sledge hammers and gun-cotton will do all that is required (see page 238 for estimate of cost of construc tion).

Horses have to be led up the ascent of the Kuh-i-Gird, which is not, however, so steep as that of the Kuh-i-Be-Ab. A low range separates the Tayin valley from that of theKayun, distant 5 miles. From the Kayun valley the Kuh-i-Haftad-Pehlu (seventy-sided hill) is crossed, here consisting of two ridges, between Third chain. which is an open tableland, the Yailaks of the Dirikawand tribe. The descent of its northern slope through a forest of oak takes three hours, and from its foot Khoramabad is distant 5 miles.— {Rawlinson.)

The river is forded with great difficulty after rain. Two miles north-north-west, beyond the river, oaks commence to grow and the tents of the Yusuf wand, a branch of the Silasila, are met with. Second stage.—Yrom this point the road follows the right bank of the Kashgan river for one hour in a north-north-east direction till the Kuh-i-Peru- Periz is reached, whence a road runs north to the Madian-rud by the Tang-i- Tul-i-Kesh. The road taking a north-west and north-north-west direction soon loses sight of the Kashgan river which in its upper course flows south-west and after an hour and one quarter by a zigzag path a steep hill covered with oaks is ascended; a further journey of H hours leads to the Biala valley through which runs a stream. Leaving this valley and the Wezenior-kuh to the left, after an hour’s journey the descent is made to the spacious valley of Madian-rud, in Kuh-i-Dasht, a district inhabited by the Dilfan tribe and the Azad-Bakti. The pastures of this district and that of Jaidar are excellent. Third stage .—Half an hour’s ride leads to the Madian-rud, 2 miles, after crossing which a bill is ascended and the road takes a direction due east along heights covered with oak.

Burujird is a town of importance, from whence branch caravan roads to all the fertile agricultural and commercial districts of Persia, viz .:— I.—-lo Karmanshah, Hamadan, and North-West Persia. To Sultanabad, Tehran, and North and North-East Persia. HI* To Isfahan, ^ azd, and East and South-East Persia. IV.—To Dizful and South-West Persia. It is distant from Hamadan 4 stages, or 95 miles; from Karmanshah, 6 stages, or 120 to 1G5 miles ; from Tehran, 14 to 16 stages, or 283 miles, via Ramadan, and 11 or 12 stages, or 230 miles, via Sultanabad ; and from Isfahan, 10 stages, or 230 miles. In 1883 wheat sold in Karmanshah at 20 and barley at 10 krans per kbarwar (675lbs); in 1884 the prices were 15 and 10 krans respectively. In its vicinity the cultivation of opium is largely increasing. Situated in a fertile valley, extending more or less in a north-west and south-east direc tion to Karmanshah and Isfahan, and but three marches distant from Khoramabad, at the head of the only practicable pass leading from Shustar, Dizful, and Muhammerah through the hills of Luristan (including the Bakhtiari hills extending to Isfahan), its great commercial and military importance to a naval power is very great. The line Muhammerah-Dizful-Khoramabad- Burujird-Sultanabad-Kiim-Tehran may be considered to be the natural commercial artery of Persia.^ A line of railway, when the country is ripe for such, should doubtless approximately follow it, for the country is more favourable to its construction on this line than on others ; the physical features of the country also favour the construction of feeders to it from Karmanshah, Hamadan, Isfahan, Ac. In the latter direction the valley of the Ab-i-Burujird extends to the Tan g-i-Bah rein, and the valley of the Kemenderab to Ali Gudar. Between AH Gudar and Mian Dasht is the watershed between the latter, the eastern tributary of the Dizful river and the A fhus river, the northern branch of the Zaindarud {see pages 263, 27S, 288). _ The town is said to contain from 15 to 20,000 inhabitants (4,000 houses). It is noted for its^ manufacture of printed chintzes: the cotton used comes chiefly from the rich district of Tusurkan to its north-west. It occupies, together with its outskirts, an area of about 4 square miles, filling up more or less the valley between the hills bordering the Dizful river, which here n&amp;rrows to a width of about 3 to 4 miles. The hills to the east here sink into comparatively low undulations ; those to the west retain their elevation and are snow-topped. The latterm for the Alwand range.2:20 Route No. 1 — could.

There are here Persiar telegraph and post offices; neither very efficient (see pages 110, 111) ; the post is a bi-weekly one. It is the seat of the ruler of the district, a fertile and important one comprising the Mahals of Silakhor (Silahur), Sarlek, Ashnahur (Ashnakhor), Harbarud, and Jopalag ; to the south-east it touches Feridan, under the Isfahan Government. The annual tribute of the district is about 60,000 to 70,000 tomans. The two main mountain chains traversing Luristan proceed from the Tauk-i-Gfrrah, i.e., the Kabir Xuh, the Keolah or ancient Zagros, and from the vicinity of Karmanshah, i.e., the Ushturun Kuh, Zarda Kuh, Sabz Kuh, Kuh-i-Dina to Ardekan in Pars. The great rivers of Luristan bike their rise in the latter, the main chain of hills. Its run is north-west and south-east (see pages 68, 69, 344, and map) ; the succession of chains running parallel to the spinal and main chain gradually lower as they recede to the north and south. Burujfrd lies to the north of both main chains. To the north of the Burujfrd-Isfahau trough lies the granitic range extending from Khonsar to the Alwand (page 69) (see Appendix C, Geology, fur sections across them). Water is plentiful and good from the Dizful river, the Ab-i-Burujird, and other hill streams; it is conveyed through the city by kanats and canals (see pages 113, 158, 232). The bazar is of some size, and here tradesmen and artisans of all denominations are to be found; an active trade appeared to be carried on. The streets of the town are narrow and dirty, often mere f iot-paths, and much out of repair. The houses, chiefly of mud, are in bad repair, and less spacious than those of Dizful and Shustar. A large stagnant pond within the city walls must add to the unsanitary condition of the town? The city is enteied by gates ; its walls are of mud, fronted by a narrow shallow ditch, roughly biidged at the gateways, and of no military or other importance. It contains several serais ; foreigners rarely visit this town, and the curiosity of its inhabitants to see strangers is very great. Vineyards are numerous in the neighbourhood (see page 13). Iiom this to the Gulf throughout the country of the Iliviits the horses and bag^a^e animals had been fed upon green pasture only. To the north of the valley of the ufzfui river, chopped straw only can be procured, and, together with barley, is the common food of all cattle ; firewood very scarce ; provisions plentiful; transport animals very scarce, but could be collected with time in some numbers from the villages. Donkeys are everywhere more common than mules (see pages 138 to 141, 254, 231). For the pack transport to be obtained from 'the Iliyat tribes to the southward of •Durujird, see pages 1.38 to 141.

Si ow falls for three months, and at times lies 2' deep; the road is said never to be closed by it. General litmartcu .—The good and broad track, with gentle gradients, to the foot of the Kuh-i-Mahallat, could be readily made into a cart-road. To zigzag a cart track over the Godar-i-Nar would present few difficulties ; the hill side is shaly, and rock is met with near its summit onlv. No bridges are required. From Alaliallat an alternative road runs to Gulpaigan via, Kaidu, distant 5 farsakhs; itself distant4 farsakhs from Gulpaigan. This road descend.- into Alternative roa . the bed of the river Korn, and, following it for some distance passes together with it through a gorge in the hills into the Kamara plain in which Kaidu lies. The streams of the vicinity are slightly brackish. From Kaidu the road passes over the rocky heights on the right bank of the river by a difficult road, beyond which crossing the stream twice it passes through the river defile and traverses the populous Gulpaigan valley in a south-west direction. ) 5-20 !

General Remarks. —With the exception of the difficulties met with in crossing the valley and which are caused by the irrigation channels carried along and across it, few were encountered, and the track could easily be converted into a cart-road. No bridges are required, the bottoms of all the small rills or streams crossed being sandy ; all gradients are gentle. Lntil thi valley of the river is reached, the track, of a hard surface and good breadth, 12' to 30', passes over and amongst undulations and low hills, separated by flat and often broad valleys; the detached hills ax - e steep ; all are barren ; the valleys, except near the streams, are uncultivated, and afford a poor sheep grazing only thistles, weeds, &amp;c.).

The town fills the hollow of the valley under the snowy range; it is from 3 to 4 miles long, and consists of, besides the actual cluster of huts at the head of the valley, detached mud huts, surrounded by orchards and fruit trees ; its stream, rapid and 10' to 15' wide, has its source in several springs of crystal water issuing from the hill-side to the south of the town ; they are considered sacred, and there is an imamzada there. They are said to fail after drought. It runs in a deep valley through the town turning mills in its course. The valley varies in width from 300 yards to one mile. The serai consists of a series of dens surround ing a cess pit (its yard) ; its streets are narrow and dirty ; its small bazar contains several carpenter’s shops ; many of its houses are two storied ; several are built of stone. It is said to contain 2,500families. This number may be scattered throughout the valley. In the depth of winter snow is said to lie 6' deep; its depth does not probably ex ceed 2' to 3' at any time. Barley and corn are harvested towards the end of June. Firewood more plentiful than usual. Provisions are plentiful; transport, chiefly donkeys, can be procured in some numbers ; mules are scarce every where ; it may be assumed that in each of the villages north ward of the Burujird-1sfahan road from 50 to 100 donkeys can be procured, each capable of carrying from 150 to 200 lbs. weight; compact load. The contrast between the greenness of the vegetation in the valley and the barrenness of the surrounding hills is very striking.

The district of Feridan (pronounced Feridun) is said to be considerably peopled by Georgians and Armenians brought there by Shah Abbas the Great. The former are Muham madans, but do not intermarry with Persians. ^ It is divided into five subdivisions; Armenians occupy nine villages or one subdivision, pay- in' annually a tribute of 2,400 tomans. The other four subdivisions contain 143 villages and pay a tribute of 6,900 tomans : the Armenians are considered to be more thrifty and better agri culturists than Persians; in all there are 17 Armenian villages in Feridun, mostly well to do. Danin, its chief town, contains 300 families [Schindler). The villages between Isfahan and Burujird are generally larger than those met with between Kboramabad and Ktim [see Kum).

They are separated by fertile valleys, well watered by abundant streams, and grow plenti fully rice, wheat, barley, maize, vetches, cotton, &amp;c. ; vines grow luxuriantly on the hill slopes, which are also plentifully clothed with stunted oaks; the belt of tree growth is of the nature of that described as passed through between Sisakht and Kurrah and follows the line Sisakht, Tang-i-Borak, Tang-i-Shul, Kuh-i-Siah. Mulberry, willow, and walnut trees are found in the valleys. The poorer classes here, as well as throughout Luristan, collect acorns and grind them into flour. Vines are met with most plentifully about Dalkhun, Ardakun, Dalin, Shul, Khullar, and Goyum. For a description of the Kashkai country to the north-east see page 289. The hills are of conglomerate, sandstone and coloured clays and marls. An idea of the amount of revenue to be derived from Kashkai villages can be formed from the following extracts from a report made by Captain Durand, 1st Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1878 :— The mal-i-diwani of all Shul (8 villages) is 800 tomans, but 1,200 good is extracted from /T ,, , ,, the ryots. Besides this, five tomans are taken for every 1,000 (I presume they count the r smallest hamlet as a village.) vinos, % ki&lt;m 101 eveiy walnut tree, 1 kran for every four appl^ or apricot trees, cows are taxed 2| krans and sheep 1 kran, but other beasts are untaxed. The poll-tax varies from 1 toman to 35 krans, being imposed in accordance with the supposed wealth of the sufferer ; the balance that is not paid is made use of by the Khadkhuda in khushamad (presents) to ferrashes and others and on his own maintenance. All these villages belong to Nasirulla Khan. In Dalkhun, which also belongs to him, the imposts differ slightly : mal-i-diwani 4 tomans, poll-tax as for Shul, gardens as for Shul, but large trees untaxed ; cows 2|, animals 1 kran, except horses or donkeys, which are untaxed. If the Khan gives the seed he only gets half (instead of the usual £); if not, he only gets one quarter of outcome. In all these villages, whether ground be cultivated or not, the diwani remains the same. The best ground in these villages will be taxed at as much as 7 tomans a gau, the worst as low as 3 brans. A gau is a space large enough to receive 30 or 40 maunds of seeds. In speaking of maunds, the Tabreez maund is meant each manf 14 kyas Sang-i- . ^ , Hashabasi; 14 kyas equal 40 miscals : the Sang-i-Manabasi is also t 71. lbs.. English.

The pul-i-diwani is said to be 1,5(X) tomans, but as an agent and a Khadkhuda both live here, a considerably larger sum must be collected, probably two-thirds more, or 2,000 at least.

The Hindiyan stream is navigable for light boats and canoes to within a short distance of Behbahan. Trade from the two entrepots converges at Zeitun. Goods go up by land, passing through Deh-Miila and Arab to Zeitun by a level road. Behbahan was governed during 1877-78-79-80 by the Ihtisham-nl-Daulat, son of Ferhad Mirza, who, till the spring of 1882, was Prince Governor of Pars. During his administration the turbulent tribes in the neighbourhood were subdued, and the i - oad to Isfahan was improved and rendered safe. He was rapacious and ruthless, and held in great fear. Whenever the Persians allude to the present insecurity of the road between Dizful and Khoramabad, they allude to the services of the Ihtisham-ul-Daulat in suppressing the Kiihgehlu tribes, and recommend that he should be sent to carry out a like worx in Luristan. There is no doubt that such a man would soon render the country perfectly safe. He ruth lessly exacted life for robbery as well as life, caring little whether the proper life were taken— a method of procedure well calculated to cause the tribes themselves to suppress lawlessness {see page 170).

Judging from the account given of the road beticeen Ardal and Shustar, 173 miles, it is considered that this section of it could be converted into a cart-road at a cost of Its. 58,000 or at a total cost from Isfahan to Shustar of Ps. 79,500, an average of Its. 265 per mile, allowing for an increase in its length of 25 miles on account of diminished gradient. Between Ardal and Bandar-Bildm, 313 miles, the road has been classed as 146 miles good, 97 miles fair and 70 miles bad ; the cost to convert it into a cart-road as above is Ps. 82,620, allowing for an increase in its length of 70 miles, at a cost of Ps. 500 per mile, on account of diminished gradient, i.e., at a total cost from Isfahan to Bandar-Bildm of about Ps. 104,000 or Ps. 215 per mile on the average. For general remarks on the advisability, or present necessity of cart roads in Persia, see page 172. None of the estimates given include the cost of building caravanserais. It is assumed the cost of ferries over rivers, where it is necessary to establish such, will be defrayed by tolls levied on passengers, animals and goods, passed over by them. By throwing wire ropes across the rivers most difficult to ford their-passage by rafts would be a simple matter. The construction of bridges with road bearers of trees resting on rough timber crib piers and a flooring of fascines would cost next to nothing and yet be an inestimable boon to all travellers. All the rivers and streams met with on the line just described between Isfahan and Bandar-Dilam could be so spanned. But no governor interests himself in the matter, custom has blunted the people’s sense of the want of them, and moreover they are most ignorant in all such matters. These remarks upon the ease with which rough bridges can be thrown over Persian rivers is of very general application. Method of bridging sian rivers. Per-Route No. 4 A. From Bandar-Dilam to Bushire.

November 9th. —Still in Ardal plain.—The plateau of Ardal is devoid of trees, though the lower spurs of the Kuh-i-Sabz are covered with oaks. The level part of the plateau showed marks of cultivation, but now, of course, was deserted, as all the Iliyats had marched south for the winter. The huts clus tered under the hills looked dismal and deserted. The snowfall here in win ter is described as tremendous {seepage 320). N.ll .—Between Ardal and Shustar the Bakhtiarx villages situated in the valleys are deserted during the summer months, i.e., June to October, the neighbouring high lands being then resorted to on account of the superior pasture there afforded. For a description of the road from Dupulan to Chigakhor {see page 285). Stage 1, November 10th. —We left Ardal where Abbas Kuli Khan, son of Reza , , , ,, Kuli Khan, the Elbegi of the Bakhtians, had hospitably received us. this man is a great admirer ot English men, and had learnt a few words of our language. He possesses a double-barrelled hammerless fowling piece and an English express rifle, which have been sent out to him by Mr. Mackenzie, of Gray, Paul &amp; Company, who has twice travelled through this country. Abbas KulPs one idea is to visit England. Crossing the plateau of Ardal to the south, we descended into the deep cut gorge of the Tang-i-S{ah river, which flows at a depth of 1,000 feet below. The plateau lies between perpendicular cliffs of fine limestone and conglom erate. At the foot of the cliffs, and wherever there is holding ground, oaks, ash trees, and pistachios are plentiful. A vine with leaves like a grape vine, but fruit like the elder berry, climbs over the rocks; wild almond, clematis, and willow, as well as planes, are common. The mules come rather to grief over the descent, which is very narrow and had broken away, and one fell into the water and drenched all our books. After meandering for some two miles at the bottom of the gorge, we reached *Two bridge place, picturesquely situated village of Dupulau* on the Altitude 4,950 feet; 50 left of the river, houses. The sun in the valley was hot and the atmosphere close. We amused ourselves shooting at a mark despite the piteous wailings Layard says the Bakh- proceeding from a house hard by, one of the inmates of which had died. Abbas Kuli thinks nothing of this sorrow of his serfs, and cracks jokes and tells stories with great gusto of the trouble he got into on his way to Mecca, of his quarrelling with the English captain, and getting put on shore for his pains. He asked many questions about the Afghan war, and recounted his experi ences in raids against the Arab tribes of the south. He boasts very much, but is not a bad fellow. Just 7 miles, very bad road; at one place, a des cent of 1,000 feet almost precipitous, remainder 4 miles along river very bad. Direction south. Very poor village. tiaris dance at their fu nerals, but certainly they mourned here with a will, and we saw the corpse carried to the grave with no demonstra tion but of grief. This was the case too at Mal- 1-Mfr, where a Bakhfcian died the day we arrived.318 below Dupulan the river of the Tang-i-Siah falls into the Kuh-i-Rang river forming, as before stated, the second tributary on its left bank. The former is spanned by a wicker bridge; the latter by one of brick lately built by the Ilkhani, at the point where the river emerges from a deep gloomy gorge. The bridge is narrow but serviceable, and spans the stream in one large and one small arch; length, say 20 yards. Stage 2, November 11th .—Leaving Dupulan, where, by the way, the Dfipnlan to Hillisat, P 00 ? 1 ® seera wretchedly poor and supplies, except firewood, are very scarce, we cross first the wicker and then the brick bridge, and ascend the side of the mountain which is a north-west spur of the Oarreh mountain. Our road is rough in places, though, as a rule, good, and leads through thickish oak forest, with a steady ascent to an elevation of 7,850 feet, where we cross the water shed, a saddle back between the Garreh and Arman mountains, and descend by a steep track to some cultivated ground. The forest here is of oaks, 4.0 feet high, and one and a half yards girth. Altitude 6,350 feet. From the patch of cultivation the descent is through a narrow gorge with precipitous sides, which could easily be turned into a nasty obstacle to an enemy. The road is rocky and goes downwards, but only to again rise steeply to 6,600 feet, to again descend to 6,400, when it once more rises to 6,750; then, crossing the saddle of a spur from the Arman mountain, it * Altitude here 5,000 descends in to a gorge which leads down into the valley of feet - the Hillisat'” stream, which we followed to where the UkhanPs camp was pitched on the left bank.

The Hillisat stream reminded me of Cashmere with its little terraces of rice fields on either side, its fine plane trees and forest-clad mountains rising steeply from the valley. The Ilkhaui received us very hospitably and talked much of his friend Mr. Mackenzie of Gray, Paul &amp; Company. The Ilkhaui is a tall, powerful man with a reddish face, hook nose, and restless brown eyes, about 64 years of age, somewhat stout, yet capable of hard work. He had a restless sort of manner, aud, sitting on his carpet, puffed dining the pauses of conversation, and twirled a crooked stick ashe perpetually repealed his phrases of welcome in our honour. The subject Afghanistan is discussed. The Ilkhaui had just received a letter from Khurasan announcing the victory of Ayub at Kandahar. Fortunately Air. Baring was able to tell of his defeat and flight. The Ilkhaui had heard that I was mapping the country, aud he did not seem at all pleased at the no tion. \\ hen 1 said it was being done in the cause of science he did not quite understand, and evidently thought that [ was seeing if a road could he made. He snowed some temper, aud said that the road from Isfahan was his business and nobody else s, and it was by assuring him that I did not think a road was practicable that be was appeased. However, he talked freely of bis country, describing its configuration, aud of bis people, of whom he evidently has a mean opinion, and whom he rules with a rod of iron. I think the Ilkhani would like to open a route through the hills, provided that he had sole com mand of it. He would only, of course, construct a very rough mule track and a tew caravanserais, and it is doubtful if on his death the whole traffic would not be stopped, as the Bakktians looked with evident dissatisfaction at our319 passing through their country, and were overheard saying “the Ilkhani is letting us go to the dogs, bringing foreigners with fat caravans through our hills, and not letting us take anything from them.” No doubt many of the mountaineers did not understand that we were not Persians and Mussul mans. Frequently Mr. Baring and myself were addressed as“hajji” or “ mirza,” or even as “Ambassador of the Shah.” Mr. Baring's companion on a shooting expedition found fault with him for not saying his prayers, &amp;c. 2 (a) Dupulan, 5,672 feet, lies at the junction of the Ab-i-Kaj or Ab-f- Rang and the Ab-i-Sabz, both bridged. There are here the ruins of the masonry bridges that formerly spanned the stream and give the name to the village. The river banks are thickly covered with tamarisk bushes. The Ab-f-Kaj or Rang is the Karun (see map); a few miles from Dupulan it is joined by the Beshtabad stream from Kahv-i-Rukh. The Ab-i-Sabz flows through the Nau- gun valley, breaking through the Tang-i-Ardal. Crossing the Ab-i-Sabz and the Ab-i-Kaj, 5,442 feet, the road undulates to the Ab-i-Sard, and thence rises gently to the Gandum Kal Pass, 7,940 feet. Descending beyond it Gandum Kal is reached, at a distance of 102 miles; road difficult (Schindler). For description of the road by Mr. Schindler to Hillisat, see paragraph 3 («)• Stage 3, November 12th .—The Ilkhani presses us politely to stay with him Hillisat to Rudbar for a at saying that afterwards he will river, 15 miles, not diffi- accompany us to Mal-i-Mir ; but, apart from the loss of cult till about Rudbar the time that would be incurred, I am not anxious to river wbere a prce^itous excite his anger by letting him see me surveying, and bluff has to be scrambled J „ ..Jo*, down. Direction west already my map has suftered from my having to work by south. Supplies very more or less cautiously. At our farewell visit we sit scarce, except tirewood. around a blazing fire under a camel hair tent, any one who likes listening to the conversation. The Ilkhani talks much in a loud voice to Mr. Baring on the state of Europe. Then concerning Russia and the murder of the Czar, of her doings with China in Kuldja, which leads to the subject of our war with China, and a discussion with regard to our sepoys, of whom he has a very erroneous opinion, and evidently was astonished when I described their prowess and daring, and was amused at my excitement when speaking of Sikhs and Gurkhas. Ayub is again brought under discus sion; and “ what are you going to do when Russia comes to Herat?” is the leading question. The Ilkhani is wonderfully well up in contemporary poli tics, and undoubtedly a shrewd man, covering under his bluff patriarchal exterior a considerable amount of common sense. He renews the invitation of his nephew Abbas Kuli that I should come and stay with them next summer. At 8-30 we leave camp accompanied by two retainers charged to see to our being properly treated whilst in the Bakhtiari country; and well they executed their duty. About a mile from camp we were overtaken by a horseman, who proves to be one of the servants to whom we had given a pre sent. He said he was in danger of the “ sticks ” for having taken our money, insisted on returning it, and begged for a note from us stating that he had done so. From Hillisat a steep mountain is ascended, altitude 6,900 feet, another offshoot from the mighty Garreh. It has to be crossed, and its southern slope descended to the valley of the Rudbar stream. The top of this offshoot was of rolling country covered with fine oaks. The road good and open. Here and there the nomads were tilling the ground under the forest trees, or shaking down the acorns which they pound and mix with flour to eke outtheir bread. The springs here were brackish. The view looking south and west was very fine. On the left the Kamn, deep down in precipitous gorges; here and there are seen tributaries coming into it from the east, from the Kashkai country, which country showed more open vales than that we were in. Far away north-east is a snow-capped mountain, which it seems to me must be the Kuh-i-Dina of the Kashkais. Looking south, the Kuh-i-Mangasht, with its long ridge, snow-capped and rugged, shows us yet no way out for us to the plains. On the right is Garreh, with its massive head frowning on the E-udbar, which flows along its southern base. A few miles farther and we are on the top of the almost precipitous cliff that forms the left bank of the Altitude 6 725 feet Eudbar stream. Here the view is very extraordinary. The ridge or cliff on which we stand is of grey limestone, which is set off by buff-coloured dead grass, and a peculiar kind of thistle which fills every corner where the rock does not come to the surface, giving the appearance of a buff plush carpet crumpled over the irregularities of the mountain side. But the right bank is the most peculiar, consisting of a grey limestone, and a hard rock with delicate hues of purple, violet, and grey blended over its surface, deepening in the ravines, and set off in the most charming way by the yellowish thistles which follow the lesser depres sions. In the valley are masses of violet bluish marl which have apparently slid down the smooth surface of the rock, and at their feet is the deep blue river fringed with trees of lighter green than the oaks that hold every cleft above. The whole scene is the most remarkable piece of nature's colouring that I have ever seen. In the gorge we saw an oak 7 feet 4 inches in girth, bearing acorns 3 inches in length (see pages 361, 362). The descent into the Eudbar valley was abominable, nothing but mules and carefully led Persian horses could accomplish it without accident. It is quite as bad as the Kamaraj Kotal on the Bushire road, but fully twice as long. A road here would indeed be difficult, and for wheel traffic impossible; it remains to be seen whether such a road could be made further up the Eudbar at Shalil, where there is said to be a bridge. The Eudbar was easily fordable, 150 feet in width and feet deep; it is a rapid and picturesque stream. We encamped on its banks. Altitude about 3,080 feet. 3 (a) The Gandum Kal valley is elevated 6,744 feet. Even in July the nights are cold, and at 4 a.m. the thermometer reads 54°.* Heavy snow falls in the winter and blocks the road for four or five months, rendering it impassable to man and beast. The road descends to an elevation of 6,364 feet; then ascends to 6,934 feet; crossing a valley it again ascends to 6,687 feet. The next descent is to the Sarkun stream, elevated 5,566 feet, growing rice and wheat. From this valley the road ascends steeply over the Gerrah-Kuh, which it crosses at an elevation of 7,333 feet. The last 4 miles into Shalil undulates over ridges respectively elevated 6,972 feet, 6,706 feet, and 6,668 feet. The whole distance of 11-J miles presents considerable difficulties. For Mr. Schindler's description of the road to the Eudbar or Ab-f-Bazuft, see paragraph 4 (a ). * This does not agree with what Major Bell heard (see page 130). I)e Bode as late as February (1841) met the Governor-in-(.hief at Kal’a-f-Madrasa, who with alibis following had penetrated thus far from Isfahan without inconvenience. The passes behind him had become closed early in February, after he had passed throimh. He marched with 1 regi ment of infantry, 1,000 well armed cavalry, and 3 field pieces (6-pounders)—in all 2,500 men and 3,000 horses and mules. At Mal-x-Mir the Bakhtian Chief had collected 5,000 men, with a numerous train of horse men, well armed and mounted. Each man had three pistols, a matchlock, and a sabre.41 321 Stage 4, November 13lh .—Our road lay up between the marl masses; it is rough, steep, and slippery. We avoided the Shalil road, which must be better than the one we traversed, as Mr. Mackenzie, who followed it, writes thus : “ ShaKlto Deh- Diz, altitude about 5,150 feet, easy and gradual descent to a main feeder of the Karun at about 3,250 feet; cross ed by a wicker bridge across a fissure in the rocks; for animals; old bridge above in ruins; thence ascend to From Rudbar river to Reh-Diz, 12 miles; di rection west ; terrible ascent, but descent into Deh-Dfz easy. Supplies scarce, except firewood. dangerous crossing 3,850 feet.” Now although Mr. Mackenzie’s description of roads are, for the most part, , too covleur de rose, still evidently the route via Shalil This must be the - - • must bridge mentioned by Schindler, as above the present “ Pul-t-Amaret ” and the Htidbar must be bis •‘Bazuft” river,— vide notes on a journey in South-West Persia, 1877- 78—R. A. Society papers for 1880, page 14. * Altitude we made 6,400 feet. f Altitude 5,221 feet. is the beaten track, and is much better than the one we took via Rudbar. On the high* ground the road is good and decends by an easy gradient to Deh-Diz.f At Deh-Diz there is an old fort roughly built of unhewn stone with mortar; around it are nomad huts and a few houses, about 100, of poor people. The village is sur rounded by a square wall surmounted by five towers; a large open upland is in front of the village, dotted as usual with oaks and patches of cultivation. A party of Saiyids were here awaiting to welcome the Ilkhani who was to arrive the next day. They were by no means friendly, and expressed a desire to shoot us in the hearing of my Mirza, who showed much pluck, and seizing one threatened to report him to the Ilkhani on his arrival. Ihe ordinary people were friendly enough and very unsophisticated; they ask curious questions of Mr. Baring—for instance, how many wives he had, whether he and I were brothers, what present the Ilkhani had given us, &amp;c., &amp;c. Red-legged partridges and ibex are to be shot in the vicinity. 4 (a). From the village of Shalil, 6,058 feet, prettily situated on a small 5tb Jul stream flowing amsidt the shade of fine plane, elm, Uy ' mulberry, willow, fig, walnut, and poplar trees amidst a thick undergrowth of bramble and rose bushes into the Ab-i-Bazuft, the road descends to the Ab-i-Bazuft, 4,220 feet, and crosses it by a rough and narrow bridge thrown over it at a point where its steep and precipitous rocky banks approach to 10 feet distance of each other. For a few steps the road is but 2 feet wide and cut out of the rock; here wide loads must be unladen. Ascending the road gains the top of a ridge elevated 6,266 feet. During the ascent the remains of the old road, the Rah-i-Sullani, are seen. A series of ridges are now passed in succession as below :— Feet. 6,215 6,46)2 Valley Ridge Valley Ridge ... Valley Ridge Valley Kul-i-Muzarm Ridge Deh-Dfz ... 5,9&lt;i0 6.742 6.350 6,970 Kuh-i-Saffd. ] 6,000 6,902 5,780 The total distance from Shalil to Deh-Diz is 15 miles; the first three ridges are crossed in its first 10 miles; the road is very difficult; the last 5 miles is through a thick oak forest. O322 Deh-Dfz to God-i-Bula- tak, 1(H miles. Easy road, descending the whole way. Direction west. Supplies very scarce, ex cept water and firewood. Down stream are the ruins of an old bridge (vide Schindler’s notes quoted 6(a) ). We did not see them, but heard of them. It would not be difficult to rebuild this ? Staffe 5, November 14th .—From Deh-Di'z we descend steadily down a water. course to the banks of the Karun, a distance of three farsakhs, through wooded country. The road not bad for mules. The guides had preceded us, and got a raft of inflated skins covered with fascines of sticks and reeds ready to ferry our baggage across. The river here was deep, and flowing say 5 miles an hour, and at this season it is 40 yards in width. Its banks showed marks of a rise of 10 or 12 feet during spring floods, when the width would be 60 yards. Our houses and baggage animals had to be unloaded, and their saddles taken off and then swum across. Donkeys and sheep are swum over in pairs by a man with the aid of a mussack. The situation of God-i-Bulatak is admirably adapted for a flying bridge, and there is nothing to prevent the working of such a bridge if a good stout boat were built for the purpose. Laden mules could then make fhe passage in a few minutes. The left bank requires a road made to the water's edge, as it is precipitous for a height of 50 feet. Our 13 mules, with 10 men and 3 horses, took one and a half hours' crossing. The Ilkham was building a brick bridge 20 miles further down tbe river. There is a small village near the crossing, where the six or eight men employed on the ferry live. 5 [a). Deh-Diz contains a fort, a mosque, good stabling, and several guest 6th Jul houses. The road at 3^ miles from the village passes through another of 50 houses, elevati &gt;n 5,080 feet. One and a half miles beyond the village it crosses the Riket stream, elevation 4,360 feet. At 8| miles a garden of wild apricot, fig, and other trees is passed, and at 10 miles the Kuh-i-Gil is crossed, and at 10^ miles the ferry over the Kanin at God-i-13ulatak is reached, elevation 2,860 feet. The road is generally easy throughout. Schindler says Mal-f- Mir was anciently named Idej or Izej. God-I-Bulatak to Mal- f-Mir, 24 miles, road capable of improvement, but would be costly. Direction west by north. Supplies plentiful. Here we saw ruins apparently of a caravan serai. Can this be the Kal’a-i-Madrasa of Schindler, and does the road go from here to the ruined bridge over the Kanin ? * Altitude here 2,980 feet. Staffe 6, November 15th. — Left camp 7-15 a.m., and did not get into camp on the “teppe' in the Mal-i-Mir plain till 5-30 p. m. The road rises gently from the river bank and is good; it makes for a gorge, and passes through it, following a valley between the south-east end of the Mangasht Range and an outlying spur of that mountain. The Karun river is here left for good. The road soon descends again, and is rough for 4 miles to where it enters a water-course, which is now nearly dry, though pools in it contain fish 9 inches in length. The course* is little better than a cleft in the grey cherty compressed clay rocks, which are here almost vertical. Some fine oaks were passed. The acorns of the country reach a length of 3| inches {see page 320). Some way up this gorge a side gully is followed to the left, and a curious Altitude 3,930'. P ave d way, the Rah-i-Sultani, leads to the open plain above. Then a very difficult piece of road is encountered, as a descent has to be made over the face of a limestone hill rounded in form, and to all appearance smooth until reached, when the terrible rifts and rubble stones that break up its surface prove to form oue of the worst bits of road we have yet encountered. A way would have to be built up this face, and for wheeltraffic this would cost a large sum of money. There is no avoiding this hill, nor any of the gorges we have traversed to-day. The Mai f-Mir plain once reached all is easy to the “ teppe.” Altitude of plain 2,930 feet. The village is a small one, of reed huts and two Imamzadas. 6 (a). At God-i-Bulatak in July the Karim is 60 feet wide and 20 feet water is very cold. Three farsakhs (12 miles) to the east the three arms of the river unite to form the Karun, i.e., the Ab-i-13ors, the Ab-i-Rang or Ab-i- Karun, and the {see map). In the spring and autumn a temporary bridge is at times thrown over the narrowest part of the river; to avoid the expense of crossing over their flocks, the lliyats often take the road to the north of the river [nee page 284). The road goes north-west from an elevation of 2,860 feet at the crossing, through the Tang-f-KaT), rising to 4,800 feet, and thence undulating consider ably to KaTa-i-Madrasa, where are the ruins of a solidly built masonry caravan serai of the time of the Atabegs, surrounded by oaks, willows, walnut, almond, pomegranate, and fig trees. The old paved road is here seen running in an easterly direction to the old bridge over the river (ruined), hrom the ruins the road goes west to the Chashma-i-Kaki and the Deli-Thala. Crossing the Kuh-f-Sar-i-Rak at an elevation of 3,660 feet, at 6 miles beyond it Mal-f- Amfr is reached (3,500 feet). The total distance from God-f-Bulatak is 244 miles over a very difficult road. The mountains are thickly covered with oaks. November 16th .—Yesterday on the Mal-i-Mir plain 1 was met by Sultan Khan, cousin of the Ilkhani, a fine-looking pleasant fellow, who took me across to his tents pitched at the site of some ancient sculptures on the north side of the plain. One huge block of] stone stands 40 yards from the foot of the hill, and the image of an ancient Persian in the act of supplication, standing. Behind him are tiers of small figures backing him up. The relief is so low and the rock so grey that the figures cannot be seen unless caught in the right light and at the right distance. In the bay another block has rows of small figures in tiers as in Egyptian sculptures; the third blocK has a single figure. Further up into the bay, and on the left hand side as you face its end, cut in the side of the rocky hill, is a tablet with figures in has relief. It is about 2 feet 6 inches square. On it appears the figure of a man evidently offering up a sacrifice, as before him is a pile of three sheep without heads. Underneath him are smaller figures leading fresh victims. The back ground of the figuie is covered with cuneiform inscriptions in letters of elements 4 an inch long. I saw on this tablet, written in pencil, the names of &lt;f A. Layard, 1841,” “ W. K. Loftus, 1852,” and therefore did not take impressions of the inscrip tions, thinking they must be well known. A galop of 4 miles across the plain brought me to the teppe, past the remains of an old earthwork. The Teppe is formed by the accumulation of ruins of ancient buildings. Stage 7, November 16th .—We are njw at Mal-i-Mir and fairly out of the Direction soutli by east, marl, or c&lt; gatch-match,” as the Persians say.

Though there is still some hilly country to encounter, yet it is all of one description, viz., gypsum and i cc ; r j. i » __ _ t&gt; : rr:n we have come on a rather varied geological formation.324 so common in Persia. Mortar was burnt just wherever it was wanted. I n places the limestones were very close-grained and took a polish like marble Geology Dupulan were cliffs of conglomerate and of fine grain limestone like that of Persepolis. After Hillisat more conglomerate. The rocks almost all have outcrops to the south, though this is notably not the case at Dupulan and the left bank of the Rudbar. We saw but one lake, viz., that to the east of the two shown on the map. The other may be visible after heavy rains, but did not exist in December 1881. We have here, at Mal-i-Mir, come on the regular Indian fauna, black and Fauna. kingfishers, francolin, spur-winged plovers, the baft bhai, &amp;c., &amp;c. Among the Bakhtiarf hills, though birds were not plentiful, we found choughs, ravens, crows, magpies, jays with more white in their wings than the English variety, long-tailed tits, and lesser tits, and cole tits, pied wagtails, and the yellow variety, green woodpeckers, and the St. Johannis nut-hatches, grey smoky-coloured thrush, larks, chaffinches, and common buntings. Ibex, markhor, and bears are found on the mountains, as well as the wild sheep {see page 81). On the morning of the 16th we went to the south side of the plain to a Sculptures. break in the mountain somewhat similar to the one I visited yesterday on the north, except that the bay ended in a cavern. Above the cavern are some tablets of sculptures in bas relief; the one to the right or north has three figures in the attitude of making a petition. They have a turban of peculiar shape; the next panel contains people in the attitude of attentive servants, and they have hats some what m shape resembling our English helmets. The people here have remarked this, and thought we should be able to read the cuneiform inscriptions at sight, which they call khat-i-faringhi or European writing; they were much disappointed to find we knew nothing about the writing, and' to hear that the people who wrote them were the Persians, not our forefathers. The kins or potentaie, the central figure of the group, has doubtless been washed away, as his position is now occupied by a water-course spilling over the face of the rock m time of rain. In the entrance to a sort of cave, not the main cave, aie wo gures, both much worn and defaced, and over and around one of them are cuneiform inscriptions in letters of elements, the same size as those ° yeS ., er Af a ^. ? re muc k defaced by age. Leaving the ancient cavern, we qui a * 1 ' 1 11 P^in at its south-east corner by a valley with many tall i^n &amp; sca erec about, then sharp to the south of the valley between rocky n s, ju or which rocky hills and the absence of a stream down it it would be like an English park. Pall grass, now somewhat dry, surround the stately oaks which are dotted here and there. Cattle grazing under some of them add to the effect, though tlie marks of porcupine recall the east to our mind. The road emerges from ns \a ey on to a barren stony plain, in the centre of which is seen a barrow or leppe crowned by the fort of KaPa-f-Tul. This is the stronghold of a cei am i nza * ga Ivhan, who looks on the Ilkhani as his suzerain, though he is more or less independent of that chief. This Khan's subjects, on the left a ''? Ir e .. va * ur b are ca lled Chaharlang, and were formerly at deadly feud with the Haft-Lang, or those who dwell on the right bank ; but the Ilkhani has altered all this [see page 95). Bricks are made at Kal’a-i'-Tdl. For road to Behbahan (,ee page 329), It is distant three long or five short stages From the north at a distance, the fort of KalVf-Tul reminded me of a ' JU 10111 ^ 10 S(,u th side it looked like an unfinished church.

He is a sullen, cruel-looking young fellow, and evidently a great savage. • lie has a villanous cut-throat of an execu tioner, who has cut off the head of a man and put out the eyes of another at the bidding of his master within the last year. However, the gloomy chief is polite, and wishes us to stay with him; his secretary, a terrible scamp, a Shirazi, was at one time in the Shah's artillery, and had seen an English gun boat. All the people of this place go up into the hills for the hot weather. 7 [a) . In the hills bordering the well-watered and triangular-shaped plain of Mal-i-Aimr, both to the west and east are caves with sculptures [see above) ; the caves are such as are ordinarily met with in tertiary limestones. r lhat to the west is known as the Shakaf-i-Salmad. In the palmy days of Mal-i-Mir, when the Atabegs held sway (11th century) and noble bridges spanned the rivers and the road to Shustar was in good order (see page 77), caravans made the journey there in four days. The ruins of the old city of Idedj or Izedj are elevated 3,102 feet; the lake under the Kuh-i-Tanaush, 3,3G2 feet, and the spring, 3,182 feet. The road leaves the Mal-f-Mir plain by a narrow pass to its south-west leading to the Hallagan plains (see page 76). Heaving the small village of Hallagan to the right, the road winds through the skirts of the Kuh-i-Kamar-f-Daraz to the village of Barangird inhabited by the Ushkui tribe; the i’oad thence runs south across the plain to Kal a-i-lul; throughout the road is generally good; the total distance is 18 miles. Near the Kuh-i-Kamar-i-Daraz the tertiary rocks give place to the second ary. The hills are thickly clothed with oaks. KaTa-i-Tul is the residence of the Khan of the Jamki tribe (see page 98). The plain in which it stands, like all the basins within these hills, is well watered and fertile; it is elevated 3,5d2 feet; the castle occupies the summit of a height 100 feet high. The following tribes and families inhabit the Tril)e? ' district, i.e., the Jamki, Zangana, Ushkui, Makafa, Mambim, Bagdali, and Gunarsi. The Jamki tribe counts now about 5,000 dwellers in the following eleven villages, viz., KaTa-i-Tul, Join, Sarla, Kal'a-i-Dalan, Abu-ul-Abbas, Hallagan, Barangird, Mai-Dawud, Bagh-i-Malik, Bona-i-Bagh-i-Malek, Derwishan. The tribute it pays to the province of Arabistan is 5,000 tomans (see page 286). The tribe reared many horses in former days; in 1876 the cattle-disease killed 70 per cent, of them; cows, mules, and donkeys died in a like proportion ; the disease spread in a south-east direction to Ears and in a north-west direc tion to Luristan, being contined to a breadth of 10 to 12 miles along a length of 100 miles. The Jamki manufacture felts, carpets, and cottons; they are grossly igno rant and fanatical without understanding their religion. Stage 8, November 17th. —We leave the fort KaTa-i-Tul and go south-west . . . over the barren plain. Crossing a low spur, we descend into a a-i- u o aiasia an0 ^ iei , p ()r tion of the plain still with no signs of culti vation. On the far side we come to a poor small village, where there is rice cultivation on the banks of a stream, and where the wild myrtle clumps look fresh and hand some. We leave the ruins of Bagh-i-Malik or Man- Zanik on our left, and, following the course of the Ab-i- Zard and crossing it, we go through a pass in some low gatch (gypsum) hills, or Kud-Zard, 13 miles, level road, except one difficult bit over gatch hills; this could be made good. Direction south. Supplies scarce, except rice.326 and then south for 3 farsakhs over a vile road to Sarasfa or Rud-Zard. J ug t before reaching this Iliyat village we recrossed the Ab-i-Zard. It is here 20 feet wide and 3 feet deep, and turns several mills. There are some patches of rice cultivation on its banks. 8 (a). Schindler performed the journey from KaTa-i-Tul to Kalgaor Rud- Zard or Tund-Ab in two stages, i.e .— (1) Kal’a-i-Tul to Bagh-i-Malik, 7^ miles; road good; direction south; and (2) Bagh-i-Malik to Kiilga, 11 miles; road very bad; direction west, i.e., in all he makes the stage to be 18£ miles. (1) The road crosses the Shakaf-i-Rashta, 3 miles from Bagh-i-Malik. To its east lies the Ab-i-Jelal, bordering which are several rice fields. (2) The Bagh-i-Malik valley is fertile and grows excellent rice and wheat. To the east of the valley oaks cease to clothe the hill sides, and firewood is most scarce. The village contains 100 families. The ancient name of Bagh-i-Malik is said to have been Kal’a-i-Kamis, and to have been built by the Kamis Arabs now occupying the vicinity of Ram-Hormuz. The ruins of Manjinik and Orwa lie in the valley. The inhabitants of Bagh-i-Malik are descended from the family of Lur-i-Buzurg living about Karmanshah, i.e., the Zangana. This family has nine branches—the Gar- rawand (of these 100 families, living southward from Burujird, are united with the Chahar Lang), Hazarwand, Salman wand, Abbaswand, 'Amwand, Gulabwand, Taduwi, Al-i-Kurshid (from this family sprung the Kurshidi Atabegs who ruled Liristan from 1,155 to 1,600), and the Gijwanr 1 . From Bagh-i-Malik (2,530 feet) to Kalga (1,910 fe-t) the Zard-Ab or Tund-Ab flows in a narrow valley for 11 miles and falls 620 feet, or, allowing for the windings of the stream, about 4-1 feet in a mile. The Ab-i-Tund-Ab or Zard-Ab has three sources, i.e., (1) that from Kal’a- i-Tul, the Ab-i-Jelal, (2) the Ab-i-Bagh i-Malik, and (3) the Talk-Ab-Al-b Kurshid. The road keeps to the valley of the Tund-Ab or skirts it, rising to an elevation of 2,500 feet. It is very difficult for laden animals which have to be unladen here and there ; it passes the villages of Derweshan (9 families) and a village of five or six huts of the Garrawand family who here cultivate rice. The Pul-i-Burida, on the old Isfahan-Shustar road, is passed two miles before reaching Kalga; this latter part of the road is very stony. From Mdl-i-Mir to Shmtar via Baitaicand [Be Rude). First stage. —De Bode, crossing the Mal-f-Amir plain in a southerly direc tion for | hour, then turned west-south-west by west for | hour as far as Shah-Ruben-Ab. On the left bank he found what he considered to be the remains of the bridge of Jirzad. Close to it are the ruins of Hallagan. I he [ valley in which the river flowed appeared green and fertile (February). Thence the road turns first west-north-west and then west.

An hour sufficed to reach the valley of Murda-Fil, where the Janiki cultivate some patches of ground. At three hours from start another valley was reached with a spring of fresh water, and also a mineral spring. There are the remains of a cemetery here. The road kept to the right of the Kuh-i-Asmari, crossing the Dunio or Murda-Fil river, a brackish stream, several times. Two hours more lead to its north-west extremity, where is a hot sulphurous spring. The Kuh-i-Asmari is of slate, and 22 miles long. To its north lies a plain bounded by lofty moun tains. On turning the angle of the Kuh-i-Asmari, the plain of Gugird or Gurgir is reached, where are the remains of freestone buildings and a small town. The soil of the plain is clayey; wheat is sown in December and reaped in March. At the extremity of the plain, 7 miles broad, the road from Taulah joins in. Crossing the Kuh-i-Gach, a continuation of the range to the south of Manjanik, the plain of Khar-i-Shutar-Zar is reached. Third stage .—From Khar-i-Shutar-Zar, 22 miles north-west of Taulah, the road to Baitawand, distant 2fi miles, goes at first west and then north-west. An hour’s ride leads to the Shustar country. To the right of the road lies a chain of gypsum hills, and to its left the Kuh-i-Siah. Behind the latter dwell the Arabs. Passing the cultivation of Shakar-Ab, the Ab-i-Shurish is forded several times. The country is undulating. The road thence goes along an elevated ground covered with kuh-nar. Baitawand lies at the foot of gypsum hills, surrounded by green meadows watered by a brackish stream. It consists of 100 houses. Fourth stage .—From Baitawand to Shustar is 15 miles. For the first hour the road runs south-west by west through cultivation. After crossing the Slnirish-Ab, the road goes west over broken hills of sandstone. After another hour the road takes a west-north-west course to Shustar. passing ruined villages and dykes. Nearing Shustar, the country becomes more level and better cultivated. After a journey of four hours, the Karun is seen issuing from the hills to the right and taking a south-south-west course to Shustar. The Ab-i-Shurish, flowing north-north-west, joins it at the village of Akili. At 6^ hours Shustar is entered after passing the river at the band. Stage 9, November 18th .—From Rud-Zard to Gurgir, about G farsakhs, Rud Zavd to Gur^ir, there is a slight rise through the low hills of roughish 20 miles of easy country ; gatch, through which we are now marching, somewhat which makes it a landmark all over the southern country. Fuel is very scarce along the road, and no villages were met with. The streams are sluggish with deep pools cut in their gypsum beds, in which are fish IT inches long. The road was not bad to the highest point, but beyond this to Gurgir it is stony and terribly rough. Altitude 1,480 poisonous oleander grows in the vicinity. 9 (a). The road taken by Schindler from Rud-Zard or Tund-Ab (Kalga) to Shakar-Ab passed south of that taken by Captain Wells. The river takes a south west direction to Ram-Hormuz. At Kalga, a poor village of 19 huts, are the several streams draining down from the watershed of the Kuh-i-Asmari, which from Gurgir extends to Rud- Zard, though it is only near the former place that the hill gains the elevation, feet. From Kalga there is a choice of two roads to Shakar-Ab [see map). The328 remains of an aqueduct over the river Tund-Ab. The rocks here belong to (he older tertiary formation. Lions are said to be found about the Barm-i-Shur. The Kuh-i-Sar-Tal is crossed at an elevation of 2,300 feet. The water of the Beluk-Ab is bitter; the pass leading into the Taulah plain is very difficult, if not impassable, to laden mules. The Sar-i-Tijuk is a small spring. The road throughout is a difficult one to Joru, 17£ miles, a village of 70 reed houses inhabited by the Janiki tribe, who here cultivate rice, wheat, and barley. Stage 10, November 19th. —Gurgir is a wretched place in an open patch Qunnr to the open amon £ st the gatch hills, and at the foot of the bare valley at a place named Kuh-i-Asmari; its people are Saiyids, and consequently Shakar- A.b, 14 miles, i of course inhospitable.

Shaking the dust off our feet we crossed a sulphurous stream, which, apparent ly coming from the direction of Mal-f-Mir, passes to the north-east of Gurgir | ('ee page 327). Despite tl e nox : ous taste of the water, rice fields flourish on its banks, which we follow to Tembi, where, not being Saiyids, the people are civil, and at length supply us with a guide. A small stream of fresh water falls into the sulphurous river, and by its banks we had breakfast. There was some delay in getting a guide, as the Khatkhuda's son and another young man were wounded, having shot one another in a duel. There is some cultivated ground about Tembi, after leaving which we see no cultivation till Shustar. Our road re-crossed the sulphur river, and turned due south for two miles ; then quitting the neighbourhood of the river j east by south, we are in gypsum hills for the remainder of the day’s inarch, only descending at nightfall by a very bad zig-zag into a broad open valley, through which a tributary of the Kanin flows. This is also brackish, but some just drinkable water is reached at a spot named Shakar-Ab, “sweet water”—I suppose with the idea of comparison, for, as I have said, the water is only just drinkable and tastes of naptha. Before reaching the spring, the man supplied from KaTa-i-Tul, seeing that his reputation was at a low ebb, tried to enhance it by challenging in a tremendous voice some peaceable folk en camped by the road, shouting “ If you don’t tell me who you are, you are all dead men,” and letting off a gun. We slept in the open under a kuh-nar tree, the night being warm and balmy. There were of course no supplies, but fire wood was plentiful owing to the numerous kuh-nar trees dotted about in a most picturesque manner. 10 (a). From Joru the road gees north, crosses the Ab-Shur-i-Joru, here ele vated 1,050 feet above the sea, and then turinng north-west, traverses the table land, across which flows the Ab-i-Shur-i-Mishwand, and along which run several low parallel ridges of limestone. Wild pig inhabit the reedy country to the north-east, and ruins of buildings occur here and there. Near the turning of the road is the point from which the old caravan road to Kam-Hormuz diverged. The waters of the Shur-i-Joni, Shur-i-Mishwand, and Talk-Ab-i- Gaomesh are bitter and salt; those of the Barm-i-Gandu and Ab-i-Bulachi are drinkable. At a distance of 7 miles from the Shakar-Ab, the Kuh-i-Khar-i- i Shutar-Zar, elevation 600 feet over the plain, is skii'ted, and at 3 miles from it, at the sweet spring of Kaluseg, the Lawari table land,is entered. From Joru, a distance of 35 miles, the road is fair and presents no difficulties.329 The old caravan road above referred to leads to the Rahdar-i-Darwaza-i- Gach (see page 75). Thence the road takes a general south-west direction over a hilly country, partly barren and partly covered with the wild almond tree, crossing at 1^ hours' journey from the toll-gate, the Tesengor Alai river, here a broad stream with a gravelly bottom, 2’ 6 ,/ to 3'deep. A Janikf village stands on either bank. Taking a general direction of south-south-east, the road traverses the districts of Baiza and Patek, passing to the east of the village of Mai-Dawud, celebrated for its rice, and by Sarila and Dalun. In the vicinity of KaPa Gabr are ruins and ancient sculptures. From Sarila an hour's ride leads to the Allar or Ab-i-Talk, and another hour to the village of Patek (a Jamki village), and the borders of the Kuhgehlu hills are now entered. From this point to Mai-Dawud is Id or 15 miles. The road now winds amongst high mountains on either hand, the Kuh-i- Nauzer bearing south-east. To the north-east the hills slope gradually down to the plain, having Mangasht behind them covered with snow. A journey of five hours' duration from the time of entering the hills leads to Baba-Ahmad, where there is an Imamzada and several springs surrounded by high reeds. It lies west of the entrance to the Tang-i-Saulek (Salak) at a distance of 5£ miles overan uneven country. The road from Patek is very undulating, and passes midway the village of Bu-ul-Feriz and the rivulets shown on the map, all overgrown with high reeds (Kamish). A tedious ride of three hours' duration between the main range and low limestone hills to the south, over a barren and rugged country, leads to Tashun, a poor village. To its south-south east, distant an hour's ride, lies the village of Ohahar-Ru. Crossing a low calcareous ridge, an hour and three quarters'ride leads to Kai-Kaus, 8 miles north-north-west of Behbahan, over a plain. Ruins are numerous in the district. The river is forded half way near the villages of Kasim, Husainabad, and Kur distan. Stage 11, November 20th. —We start before daylight as we have a 30-mile Shakar-Abto Shustar, stage into Shustar. All the morning we are marching 30 miles; good road, level, down the open vale bounded on the north by the plateau Direction south-west. 0 f gypsum we crossed yesterday, and on the south by a ridge of sandstone, which, running east and west, divides this valley from the plain of Ram-Hormuz. Every now and then the road crosses the brack ish stream, and the junction of the Gurgir stream is seen to the north-east. There are ruins showing that this valley was formerly peopled. We halted for breakfast as our road entered the sandstone hills on the south; the spring water still brackish and barely drinkable. The “ Tetnbi' guide, thinking he had gone far enough, deserted. However, people carrying firewood into Shustar were to be met with now and then, and by them we were directed along the ridge, which dies out as it approaches Shustar only to crop out in a bold bluff of sandstone. It presents the most remarkable instances of false bedding I have ever seen. Amongst these hills were well-built masonry retaining walls, evidently in tended either for the storage of water or to terrace the hill side. The earth at present is level with the tops of the retaining walls, which show skill and labour far in advance of those of the present inhabitants, who now entirely neglect their country. Darkness had set in before we reached the town, and we had to flounder about amongst the way-worn slabs of rock, making for the lights that twinkled in the distance. At last we found ourselves on the banks of a rapid stream, with the roar of a cascade sounding in our ears. We discover a native in a hut, who conducts us by a built road across the flood and through the narrow streets of Shustar to the castle, where rooms are placed at our disposal. Altitude given by Mr. Mackenzie 550 feet. 42330 From Isfahan to Shustar supplies such as mutton, fowls, rice, milk, bread, barley, and straw are obtainable or can be collected by Supplies. g U i ( ]e furnished by the Ilkhani. Fuel is scarce from Isfahan to Ardal; thence to Kaha-f-Tul it is plentiful; on to Shustar it is again very scarce. Water is good up to Sarasia, but scarce and bad after that to Shustar (see page 828 and helow ). . 11 (a). Schindler estimates this stage to be 32 miles^ Leaving Shakar-Ab the road traverses the waste valley of Lawari (see page /5), crossing tin ice the salt stream, which waters it before it crosses the Gardan-i-Zan-i-Murda. Cha- har-Taki is the name of one of the several cemeteries met with in this once inha bited plain. The spring at Tihuyek is bitter; that at Bard-i-Amir is of drink able water. The Tul-i-Kejat, the apex of the Kuh-i-Sija (Siah), is a good land mark. Near the Gao-Sawar pass the hills rise 250 feet ovei the plain. Ihence the road passes between parallel hills of limestone, rising 100 feet to 150 feet, and belonging to the later tertiary formation, to iuf-i-Bagheli. Iheie is heie a spring of good water. From this point tracks diverge to Wais and Ahwaz and Ram-Hormuz. This road is taken to avoid the crossing at Band-i-Kir (see page 180). Four miles from Shustar is the spring known as that of Shah Muhammad Hussain. From Tuf-i-Bagheli the road is very dilhcult on account of its furrowed surface. Comparison of routes from Isfahan to the Sea (Captain Wells, R.E.). The ordinary route from Isfahan to the sea now followed by kafilas is via Shiraz to Bushire. Along this route caravanserais are built at convenient distances, and supplies are forthcoming. From Isfahan to Shiraz there is little or no engineering difficulty, anl with a small (comparatively) expenditure of capital a good carriage road coul 1 be made. Distance from Isfahan to Shiraz 323 miles. Beyond Shiraz the road is in places execrable and scarcely passable for laden mules, but is capable of vast improvement, and a carriage road could follow its general direction. Toe distance from Shiraz to Bushire is 196 miles. Along the Bakhtiari route via Ardal and Mal-i-Mir there are no cara vanserais of any sort; no bridges over several of the rivers, and in winter, when the nomad population moves bodily to the Shustar plains, there would be no supplies. However, supposing the Karun river were opened for navigation to Shustar, and the necessary canal dug out at Ahwaz, goods could be unshipped within 275 miles of Isfahan, that is, 244 miles nearer than via Bushire. from Bushire to Isfahan is 519 miles; still the difficulties to be met with in these 275 miles are very great. It has been suggested that a light railway might run over them; but this is, in my opinion, out of the question, as the cost or the undertaking would be enormous. The valley of the Karun audits tribu taries have such precipitous sides, that it would often be necessary to carry the road in galleries cut in the hill sides for miles ; the bridging, too, would be tremendous; and if the line were carried out at right angles to the series o ridges that lie between the plateau of Chahar Mahal and Mal-i-Mir, the line would be little better than an alternation of tunnels and viaducts. I thin' the Railway Engineer would prefer to take his line from Shustar via Behbahan to the Ardakan valley; he would find no stupendous obstacles this way, an would have wormed himself to thereof of Central Persia without crossing one331 of the ridges that guard it. He would tap, too, its most fertile plains and include Shiraz. The 7,200 feet kotal that lies between Ardakan and Shiraz has no difficulties or gradients that a “ FairlieV' engine such as is used between Poti and Titiis could not negotiate. Or I should recommend the trial of the valley of the Shapur river from Bushire to Nodun, where a tunnel would lead through to the river Shur which runs from Ardakan. But to return to roads. The difficulties of the Bakhtiari route are consi dered so great at Dizful that all kafilas for Isfahan go via Burujird, and it might be best to take them from Shustar, via Dizful and Burujird, to Isfahan, ably 380. Unfortunately 1 have not seen this route, so cannot speak of its merits; however, water is said to be plentiful and the road not bad. 1, 3, SfaJ fy pages 198, 22o). The difficulties of the Shiraz-Bushire road are all within a distance of 93 miles, viz., from Daliki to the Kara-Gatch river. Those of the Bakhtiari route are within the distance of 117 miles from the plain of Mal-i-Mir to the borders of C hah dr Mahal. (1) The Shiraz road is certainly villanous from Daliki to the Kona Takta plain, a distance of 11 miles. (2) Again the Kama raj Kotal is abominable, 6 miles. (3) To avoid the Kara-Gatch, heavy work would be required for 4 miles. (4) To avoid the Kotal Dukhtar and curve a road out of the hill side to the south of it, 5 miles. (5) To turn the Kotal Pir-i-Zan and make a carriage road to Dasht- i-Arjan, 12 miles. To turn the Sena Safid Kotal, 6 miles. These 41 miles allow for gradients and comprise all the heavy works. I think the five miles for the Kotal Dukhtar might be saved by entering the Dasht-i-Ber from the Shapur valley; but of this 1 am not positive [see page It would be necessary to add at least 25 per cent, to these, the bate distances from point to point, in order to allow foi decent gia ion s, so la we have OS’b + 103*1 miles of difficult hill road-making. though the distance this way must be at least 35U miles from Shustar—prob- Certainly this is the case from Burujird to Isfahan [see Read Reports Nos.

The Bakhtiari route is, in my opinion, out of the question for wheeled ffic. # , But suppose it were tried, caravanserais built, and the Kaiun budged, traffic. we should have— From the Mal-C-Mir plain to the Karun river, From the river to Deh-Diz Deh-Diz to Rudbar river Rudbar to Hillisat ...

( I a d altitudes below is seen.832 From the river to Deh-Diz the present track is too steep for wheels. From Deh-Diz, which has an altitude of 5,221 feet, the road rises to an altitude of 6,400 feet in 4 miles. Descending to the Rudbar stream in 6 miles to altitude 3,080 feet. Ascending above Ilillisat 6,900 feet, and descending to Hillisat to altitude 4,850 feet in 4 miles. From Ilillisat it has to rise over altitude 7,850 feet, to descend to Dupulan altitude 4,950 feet. Here at Dupulan a 1,000 feet gorge has to be managed, and the road carried thence over the ravine-cut plateau of Ardal through the mountain Chokahor, and thence down into Chahar Mahal, altitude 6,700 feet. Mr. Mackenzie crossed from Ardal vid Chokahor, and made the altitude of the pass 8,350 feet. To follow the Kanin would be twice as long and just as difficult. These altitudes are relatively, though not absolutely, correct [see Part III anti page 309). Comparison of the routes Shustar-Khoramdbdd and Shustar-Isfahan via Mdl-i-Mir [Schindler) The journey from Burujird via Khoramabad to Dizful was made by Mr. Schindler at the command of the Shah with the object of discover ing the best line for a system of telegraphs to follow. Finding it a diffi cult route, and hearing that a line could be more easily laid between Shustar and Isfahan, he made the latter journey in 1877, but found it to be much more difficult than the former. Eventually the line was constructed along the former route (Road Report No. 1). Report ly Captain Wells of a journey made by him from Ahwdz to Shiraz, 1SS1. Refer to pages 44 to 46. Stage 1, December 3rd .—We left Ahwaz, population 300, elevation 200 Ahwaz to east side a.m. The weather was bitterly cold, and a of Shaihkhe marsh, 27 dank fog lay over the country. There is a marked coolness miles. Level plain with in the climate at Ahwaz as compared with that of the no road, east by south. surrounding country. This is remarked by the natives, who, like ourselves, are at a loss to account for it. We travelled across the trackless plain of Ram-Hormuz in a direction a little south of east, and fol lowed for many miles the base of the sandstone hills that trend away in that direction, as described in my Ahwaz report [see page 182). The country here is very fertile. No artificial irrigation is required. The Arabs till soil enough for their own wants and no more. Sugar was grown here at one time, though, I believe, with doubtful success. Millstones for crushing the sugar are shown at Ahwaz to this day, and a strange story is told to account for the disappearance of the trade. It is this. The sugar trade was doing wonders at Ahwaz, and the sound of busy mills was heard on all sides, when two wicked faringhis arrived from India. They saw the thriving place, and with their knowledge of magic determined, in the interests of India, to de stroy this rival business. They bought up all the sugar, stored it in a vast warehouse in Ahwaz, and then sailed away. Strange to say, people were more trustworthy in those days at Ahwaz than they are now, for, despite the con tinued absence of the faringhis, the store of sugar was untouched for a year; but when it was opened, terrible to relate, all the sugar was gone, and in its place were crawling crowds of scorpions.These rushing out so terribly afflicted Ahwaz and its vicinity that the people fled, and thus was destroyed the sugar trade. YVe were told to keep together, as the Arabs of these parts are notorious robbers, and a well there is in the hills is a noted trap of theirs. We saw lar^e flocks of gazelles and an occasional houbara. As the sun rose we turned off first our ulsters, then our thick jackets, and would fain have stripped to oar shirt sleeves, such is the terribly trying changeableness of tempera ture in this part of Persia, which vies with that of Afghanistan and Peshawar, and, combined with the muddy or brackish water which forms the drink in these parts, tends to affect the strongest stomach Just as the sandstone hills are “ hull down” on the south-west horizon, we come in sight of a large marsh with fine cattle and buffaloes amongst its reeds. Some care has to be taken to find a fordable track across it, and an abominable smell rises from the ooze as it is trampled by our animals. There are plenty of snipe and ducks. The water is brackish and tastes a little of naptha. The name of the place is Shah-Khi, or rather this is the name of the district. On the sandhills to the east the long black line of tents shows the situation of the encampment of the ‘‘Bowie” Arab tribe, which is our destination. As we emerge from the marsh, we see a great commotion in the camp,—men moving in masses, firing guns, and flashing sabres. Our guide and senants arealarm ed, especially the former, who has a bad conscience, having once taken part in a raid against this identical clan. He has to keep a strict incognito or risk the loss of his ears. Old campaigners, however, at a glance would see that there was no fear; for are not the women here, at the margin of the marsh, under our horses' noses, carrying the brackish fluid in their goat skins ? The fun, for such it proves to be,‘ goes on fast and furious, and no notice is taken of us as we make our way to the bhaik i s tent and commence pitching camp in its neighbourhood. It appears that the Shaikh has just returned from a journey, and all this fuss was to welcome him home. His brother comes and' introduces himself gradually;, a knot of the old men gather round us, and then, as interest increases, the whole company ot‘ braves dances past for our special edification; the Chiefs brother, caia- coling his mare backwards and forwards in front of the line, waving ns body in graceful attitudes. The braves were all dressed in long white c ot ies&gt;, and danced a springy sort of step as they advanced in seined mass, waving their swords and pieces, and chanting a wild refrain to the onour o ^ ie Shaikh. After nearly stampeding all our horses, the youths subsided into their ordinary ways. The soil is alluvial and impassable after rains. . Stage 2, December 4 ^.—The Bowie camp at Shah-Khi comprised 700 families; they were hospitable enough, and were com fortably housed in tents walled off with reeds from the marsh. They spoke hardly any Persian. The d rawhack was the brackish water, the salt taste seemed to pervade the milk of the flocks and herds that drink it. Appa rently, however, the pasturage on and near the marsh is too good to be abandoned, so salt drinking water must be submitted to. ie large flocks of beautiful sheep testified to the goo net-s o 16 . , j ,. have done with the level plain. To the north and east the ground is i n hi ^ Our way (there is no track) soon meets the Gopal river as it meande slowly between mud banks 18 feet in height.

General direction east. On the334 banks of the stream are the “Bowie” tribe's summer grounds. There are signs of cultivation and jars of unburnt clay made for the purpose of hold ing grain. The (xopal showed marks of flood 6 feet higher than its present ornormal level. It was 30 feet broad and 3 feet deep when we crossed it. The road, for a track has commenced, leads through marly and gypsum hills to a raised plain, and the head waters of one of the branches of the Gopal is crossed. Our way is along the plain to the village of Mir Bachcha, which is situated on a “teppe”; thence the plain slopes gently down to Ram-Hormuz. We halt half way down at the tents of Shaikh Jabir Khan, who receives us in durbar surrounded by the men of this tribe. They are a fine-looking lot, well behaved, show much more breed than any Arabs we have yet seen. I hey have good horses too, and their coffee is the best I have ever tasted. Samples of the naptha from the well on the road to Shustar, shown on St. John s map, was examined and proved to be excellent. There is not much of it they say, and the spring has been known to fail entirely after catching fire. Ihe water here is slightly brackish. Around Ram-IIormuz is much cultivation, and plentiful rains bring crops to perfection {see pages 353,44). Stage 3, December 5th .—Rainy morning, but decide to start. Tremen- n t -tu t ous tropical thunderstorm comes on, and we are drenched lir to RusUmaMd to the skin; have great difficulty in crossing swollen across level country, 14 streams of the Alai, into which our old friend the Zard- miles,east by south. ^ fl ow . s&lt; There is no road as we are avoiding Ram- Hormuz. Two mules washed off their feet; we waded along through flooded paddy fields, past a village named Pilih to another named Rustamabad. Luckily, the sun came out at 3 p.m., and we were able to get a few clothes dried. The people here are a wonderful change from the aquiline nosed Arabs we have left. They are a colony of Kuhgehlu Lurs who have migrated hither from Behbahan. The Khatkhuda of Rustamabad is a jolly old fellow, in face resembling the bust of Socrates. He is a warrior too, and killed the father of Daurab Khan of Grownek, with whom he had a feud. The people are flat nosed and big-headed, their broad foreheads being rendered preternaturally high by shaving. This night there was a total eclipse of the moon, and all the villagers turned out to fire at the demon that was supposed to be devour ing the Queen of Heaven. Stage 4, December 6th. —The Socratic Khatkhuda evidently thinks we are made of money, and disdains accepting the gold RustamBbad to camp piece offered in payment for the small amount of gram near Jaizun, lb! miles, an q bread and a diseased sheep he supplied us with. e v y S ° U ‘ The sheep made us all ill, though now that we have got into a sweet water country we can eat most things. We have hit off the track, and just outside Rustamabad we cross a stream named the Shurab, insignificant except in flood time. Our road going slight- * Thl ® &gt; be tbe lv south by east, enters the broad open valley of the ai ot t. o m s map. Xurdistdn river, bounded on the south by a low range of hills not shown on St. John's map, and on the north by a lofty range. We are marching up stream, and two miles parallel to and north of it, so have to cross the deep cut courses of many mountain torrents. Luckily we did not try these yesterday, or we should have been brought up on the bank of the first one. Their sides could be ramped for the passage of wheeled vehicles. Six and one quarter miles (two farsakhs) from Rustamabad is Sultanabad, a small village with a few date palms and some bean cultivation. Prom Sul tanabad the upper road should be taken when the river is in flood; as it335 Camp near Jaizun to Deh-Koreyseh, 25 miles.

The valley is here about 4 | miles broad and the river only miles to south. A few miles further on the road comes right to its bank. There are large quantities of kuh-nar trees in the plain and aspens along the river side. This would he a fertile spot if it had a settled population. After passing the fourth torrent at right angles to our road, we come on some cultivated ground, and see the Arab encamp ment we are to halt at. We got some black francolins to-day. The night bitterly cold with sharp frost, Arab children crying with cold; we badly off with half wet bedding. Stage 5, December 7th .—Slowly our frozen people pack up. We warm ourselves w r alking after francolin or black partridge, which were plentiful in a grove of palms, with an undergrowth of wild vines and figs. We are handy to our caravan as it passes the village of Jaizun in habited by liurs. Our Arab guides disappear into the vil lage. When we get 200 yards beyond it, w r e see several men running for the caravan. They commence to struggle with our people to carry off a mule, and demand black-mail. We dismount and lay on with sticks, drive them off well thrashed, send on the caravan, and then cover the retreat with drawn revolvers. Knives were being drawn and guns shouted for by the villagers, but by the time the guns arrived we were out of range; the distance was tried by firing at us. bortunately the ground was open, and they did not think fit to run forward and hold the rough country we were now approaching. r lhe Blunts experienced annoyance here at Jaizun. This nest of robbers ought to be done away with. It is beyond the limits of Behbahan territory, and Shaikh Jabir seems to have no power. His men, our guides, were doubtless in collusion with the vil lagers. These worthies lost the present they were to have received from us notwithstanding that they protested ignorance, and declared they heard nothing of the row. Leaving Jaizun the plain gets drier and stony. About four miles east of Jaizun the valley has narrowed considerably, and the road, no longer able to follow the river, strikes across the spur from the mountains, which spur here closes the valley. The road, though rough, cou easi y e knocked into shape, having no steep gradients, and the rocks mostly jeing conglomerate. From the north-east side of the spur a fine view of the Behba han plain is gained. The town is in the middle-distance, with a fine range of mountains to the north, with their snowy caps bounding tie view m ia direction. A low range of hills to the south divides the plain of Behbahan from that which runs down to the Persian Gulf, and turns the nvei Jana n west into the valley up which we have been travelling. n re e road from Patek is seen, with the plain on that side a deep green ro kuh-nar clumps.

It is a rapid stream, and even now,’when only 45 yards wide, is only fordable by strong men, being up to the horses' girths. In spring it would be a nasty flood to pass. Fine cover of tamarisk and oleander marks its course, whilst beyond palm groves, villages, and cultivated ground present an unwonted scene of prosperity and security for this part of Persia. Wild cabbage is the ordinary weed of the plain. The Governor of Behbahan, the “ Nasir-ul-Mulk,' welcomed us most kindly through his young commandant of horse, a Shirazi gentleman, who spoke' a little English. We were comfortably housed in a garden worthy of Shiraz itself. However, palms, which are here plentiful, are great rarities in the capital of Ears. The Nasir-ul-Mulk is fond of gardening and building; the narcissuses are m full bloom ; castor oil plants, orange trees, and a tew sickly plantains, with jessamine in bloom, are amongst the rarities. The town has practically no walls; the population is between four and five thousand; it seems thinly peopled and tumble-down, yet delightfully clean compared with Dizful and Shustar. The water-supply is poor; water has to be stored in ab-umbars or subterranean chambers for summer use. There is a regiment of infantry and a few guns here.

Good francolin shooting here, and lions are occasionally found. No supplies obtainable. On the banks of the river is a thick cover of willow and tamarisk, &amp;c. Stage 8, December 12th. — From Khairabad river to Dugumbazan, direction south by east, the road commences well, gradually ascends to the plain of Lishter, 4 miles wide by 10 miles long, a grand place for pasturing mares. Even at this season there is grass, and the evergreen kuh-nars give shade, whilst the Shams-al-Arab stream, which bounds it on the south east, supplies good water. The above-named stream is small except in time of flood. After crossing it we enter rounded gypsum hills, and are amongst them for 4 miles of road, after which, crossing the water parting between Shams-al-Arab and the Dugumbazan steam (altitude 2,480 feet), the road becomes level with hills on either side; that of Shah-Ru on the right front^ is remarkable in shape. The mountain on the left, marked on the map as Kuli- f-Huma, but known as Kuh-i-Dil, must be at least 10,000 feet in height, and looks well from the plain on which Dugumbazan stands. They say the stream from this plain is lost in a marsh. The water from the snows of Kuh-i-Du mostly goes down the Shams-al-Arab ($&lt;?&lt;?^b’). At Dugumbazan is a ruined caravanserai and a small village, the first we have seen since Behbahan. It possesses a much ruined fort with two towers. During the whole march fuel was plentiful, but water scarce. Lions are said to be numerous in the vicinity.

Direction east plain showing marks of once having been well peopled, by north. Basht to I el- though now a few tents only are seen and a little cultiva- Espid, 18 miles, east y tion. Great slabs of almost perpendicular limestone rise from it and form the south of the Kuh-i-Dil. The road runs to the north-east, and turns the east end of the mountain without much difficulty by threading between the knife edges of the remarkable limestone for mation, and ascending a slight kotal called the Tang-i-Narik (altitude 3,230 feet). To the east of the mountain the country is quite park-like with the oaks which have again appeared. On nearing Basht the road was so bad, following a zigzag for miles, that we had often to dismount; but we had evidently missed the way, for a better track was necessary for the rickety gun carriage we have been tracing from Behbahan. The gun, it seems, reached the small stone fort of Basht only to be sent back again to Behbahan. The fort would hold 70 men. Its walls are high, and round it are grouped the reed huts constitu ting the village. There is a permanent garrison of government people, but very weak. At Basht is a fine open valley running west by north to east by south with a small stream capable of becoming an awkward flood. This in its normal condition trickles over a stony bed down the centre of the valley. The people (there are only about J 00 ) are at feud with all their neighbours, and never dare wander out of sight of home. Large clumps of wild myrtle dot the plain ; carraway seeds are cultivated, and an oil extracted for sale. Rice is also cultivated. A road goes from here to Mian Kotal, and is reported to be good. The snowy peaks above Dasht-i-Arjan were visible from Dugumbazau. From Basht the road leads down and across the valley, past mounds, evidently sites of ancient fortified places, and enters the low hills coming from the north-west; it ascends only to descend again so as to hit off a water course, which must be occupied by a considerable torrent at times. Thence we go through a park-like valley with fine oaks. At the head of this is the first serious obstacle to wheeled vehicles hat we have met with since Behbahan, viz., the Guzinjun ridge, which is of limestone rocks. The ascent, coming from the west, is nothing, but the descent of half a mile into the Chal-i-Moreh plain is steep, rough, and difficult. The view from the Guzinjun ridge (altitude 2,7b0 feet) is fine. The Chal-i-Moreh valley, almost perfectly flat, has its alluvial soil standing level up against the stony hills. A narrow gorge admits the river which meanders from the north-east, escaping by an equally narrow gorge to the west. The plain extends to the east, like an arm of the sea, the sluggish stream of the Sar-Ab-i-Siah draining this arm and falling into the main stream two miles from the ridge. The fords of the main river and that of the Sar-Ab-i-Siah are easy ; that of the latter is just above where a remarkable mound, evidently artificial, is now crowned by a ruined mosque. The mound is circular in shape, has 40 feet of steep scarp, and 70 feet diame ter. The Sar-Ab-i-Siah evidently was formerly led round the east side of the mound as well as the west, and a wet ditch was thus secured ; but now there is only water on the west. This river “is said to rise at one burst from a huge spring half way up the valley, which has been likened to an arm of the sea. Certainly we saw nothing of the sources at the head of the valley, or rather at the narrow neck of level called the Pul-i-Safid, where it emerges into the Tel-Espfd plain inhabited by the Mamasseni. Moreover, there was an irrigation channel from Tel-Espid, formed evidently to water this upper portion of the arm/'’ above the sources of the bar-Ab-i-Siah. bo the tale of 4*3338 the spring' is probably true (altitude of Tel-Espid 2,830 feet). 1 el- bspid plain is similar to that of ChaU-Moreh in character, only more circular than oblong, which is the shape of the former. One’s attention is attracted by the square mud towers of the Lur inhabitants, all placed on artificial mounds command- in- the tents or huts at their feet. These Lur people stay here all the year round but prefer not to build houses for fear ot the tax-gatherer getting a firmer hold of them by means of their fixed residences. The road all day had been stony, but by no means bad. From Te 1 -Espid to Kazran there is a road down the valley of the Shapur river (he Mow). This Tel-Espid plain is watered by the Fahhaa river, as I prefer to call it (after the principal village and tribe of the Lel-Fspnl plain). It is shown as Ab-i-Shur on St. John’s map, and as the Endian river and Tan-.i-Khast or Shashpir on my sketch. Itice fields seem to absorb the whole of the rapid stream, for not a drop could we see in the water-course which leads from the plain to the south-west; but numerous irrigatron channels were to be traced, notably the one leading to the head o£ the Sar-Ab-i-Siah valley. Ftihlidn to Kdzrdn. Fabliau is situated at the northern base of the range of hills beyond which lies Nurabad. The soil is here very fertile and water abundant Uee lieviaed Gazetteer of Perdu ). Irrigated fields yield from 25 to 40 fold of the winter crops. The yield of rice is' 1 50 fold, and of sesamum fkunjud) 100 fold. In the winter months the narcissus grows in wild luxuriance. The road to Kazran takes a southerly direction along the heights separat ing the Sha’b-Bevan valley, in which lies Fabliau, from Sahra-1-Bahrain, and then over the plain to Nurdbad. The plain is 12 miles long, east and west, by 8 miles br&lt; ad. The Kal’a-l-Safid lies 8 miles to its north-east [»ee Rerued Gazetteer of Persia). Passing Nurahad with its small fort flanked by four bastions and the ruins of ISlaubenjan, Naksh-i-Bahram, surrounded by trees, water, and verdur 0 , is reached. Crossing the Muna-Nahl, the boundary be tween the districts of Kazran and Fabliau, Chenoshejan, a plain of some extent, is reached. Oak trees abound here. This plain communicates with the Dasht-i-Ber, below the PiT-i-Zan and the Shapur plain, forming a part of the vale of Kazran; and if this horse-shoe line diversion be followed, the difficult pass of the Kotal-i-Dukhtar is avoided. Crossing the valley of the Dasht-i-Ber or Kuhmarah, the Shapur river is forded, and the Maidan-i- Kazian, 12 miles long and 3 broad, traversed to Kazran (DeBmle). btage 10, December 14th. —We followed the Tel-Espid plain to north-east, and went straight to a steep rugged kotal (altitude If l-Espi l to Piil-i- g ggQ f e(; t). Obviously there must be a better line for a road where the river enters the plain. Having descended the other side of the kotal, we are by the river side again; and two miles fur ther up stream, we are at the foot of the precipitous hill named Kal a-i-Safid, from the white colour of its rocks, and its being used as a stronghold in time of disturbance. There is only one way to the top, and that no easy one. The sides are scarps of perpendicular rock. This hill should be on the left hank, it is marked on the wrong side of the river in St. John’s map. Just by Kal’a-Safid the Fabliau river is joined by the Sul stream from the north, the main stream from the east bein— here called the Taug-i-Khast river. It is 18 yards wide and three feet deep, flowing very rapidly. It gets the name of the Tang-i-Khast stream from a narrow gorge, through which it flows. Ibisgorge would lie tlie natural direction of the road to Shiraz , but for some reason the Sul is followed in its north-easterly direction, and along- it a very rouffh bit of country is encountered. The road crosses the Sul stream no less than four times in three miles, and is bridged at the fifth crossing by the Pul-f-Murt (“ Bridge of the Myr tle ”). At this Pul we rested for the night, there being an old caravanserai. The Pul-i-Murt is named after the extraordinary fine myrtle that flourishes in groves near at hand. Blackbirds and robins delight to hide in these thickets, and remind one of Devonshire by their notes at sundown (altitude of Pul-f-Murt 3,680 feet). Oleander and wild almond too flourish in this narrow valley, shut in and protected as it is from winter blasts. Our servants and muleteers are all falling sick, owing to the cold we are experiencing and the long continued marching. The people on this side of Behbahan, the Mamasenni, are totally different in appearance from the Bakhtfari, the fine drawn Arab, or the flat-faced Kuhgehlu Lurs we have been accustomed to. Here the Mamasenni Lurs are the finest looking men I have seen in Persia. They have a handsome Jewish cast of countenance, with very aquiline noses and long beards; the moustaches drooping and lighter coloured ; the hair also light brown; the eyes often are black, but sometimes grey (see page 55). They wear the tall brown felt hat of the ancient Persians, much more imposing than the round-headed cap of the Bakhtfans and Kuhgehlu Lurs. One of the guides to-day amused us much. He was a good-natured fellow with weak eyes. He was always shouting at his horse or asking absurd questions about Faringistan, such as whether we raided omone another’s vil lages? How he would be received if he went to London? &amp;c., &amp;c. dhis lad had no idea of distance, and did not even pretend to know the length of a farsakh. Another guide was a Bakhtfan, who was always making disparaging remarks on the country we were passing through, and singing the praises of his own, which is not, in my opinion, to be compared to this. Guide is a misnomer for the people supplied by Persian authorities, as most of the men who come pretending to show the way have never travelled the road they are now acting as pilots for. No supplies are to be had here; all must be brought from Tel-Espid. A road leads from this point to Ardakan, distant h farsakhs, or 20 miles. Stage 11, December ioCA—From Pul-f-Murt we follow the main stream of , the Sul river along its left bank, having crossed to that Side. The valley is pretty and well wooded though narrow and stoop banked. T-he road could be made very good, as the gradients are not very difficult. Rice cultivation L seen near the water wherever the valley widens, and now and then clumps of myrtle appear. A solitary mill is the only habitation we see duiing the day. The track, leaving the head-waters of the Sal or Sul, turns east through a narrow gorge capable of carrying a good road, and by easy g’.adients the watershed that divides us from the pleateau of Tang-f-Rudian is reached. M e saw many marks of bears and of a panther here, also of wi d pig an b mep (altitude 6,950 feet). Having crossed this, the descent to the banks of tlie Tang-f-Khast or Fahlian river, which here is called the fang-i- cu lan mtl &gt; is easy and gentle. We are now on an extensive plateau, bounded on the north by the Kuh-i-Kum-Firuz, on the south by the lofty range that runs west from Dasht-f-Arjan, and on the east by the Kuh-f-Barafi of Shiraz and the Khan-i- Zinian hill, known as Kuh-f-Kelat; on the west, the plateau dies out in the hills that bound the Sul river.340 At night we reach the village of Tang-i-Rudian, situated at the bottom of a narrow valley carved out of the plateau by the Fabliau river, which is here as at KalVi-Safid, perfectly sweet (altitude 5,400 feet). How it came to be called the Shur or “ salt river ” was explained by a man here who told us that between this and Kal’a-i-Safid salt is manufactured on the banks of a tributary of the main stream, the waters of the tributary being highly impreg nated with chloride of sodium. Stage 12, December 17ih .—We leave the fort and valley of Tang-i-Rudiau, , ,, ^ the head-quarters of the Dushman-Ziari Lurs. A steep ymu! n li miles' south- climb of 600 feet and we are on the level of the plateau; west. 200 feet more and we cross a ridge that, running from the direction of Shiraz, divides the plateau in two, but dies out here at Tang-i-Rudian. From the summit of this ridge Adah ban is visible, and a plain dotted very sparsely with villages. With a settled government this would be a rich place indeed ; vines are grown along the hill sides, as we follow the northern slope of the ridge to where the plain dies out at a village named Shul (altitude 6,725 feet). The people are not the men that the Tel-Espid plain produced, though they belong to the same clan. The women, however, are remarkably pretty, and do not cover their faces. A gentle ascent from Shul takes you to the watershed dividing the basin of the Fahlian river from that which drains into the Shiraz valley. This watershed is at altitude 7,35U feet. We camp at Goyum (altitude 5,750 feet), a Saiyid village, and experi ence extreme cold. The country is now the regular central Persian hill and barren valley. Fuel is abundant. Vines are very numerous. Stage 13. Descending gently to Shiraz, now and then passing a walled Goyum to Shfraz, 21 Vllla ^ re and re g ular gardens at Masjid-i- Bardi, we reach miles) south-east. our haven after 20 miles ride, and get news of the world after six weeks and a day's absence from it.APPENDIX C. GEOLOGY OF SOUTH-WEST PERSIA. Extracts from a 'paper on the Geology of the TurJco-Persian Frontier and of tie districts adjoining, by W. K. Loft us, Esq., F.G.S., June 1854. N.B .—This account should he read with Road Reports No. 1, 3, 3(a), 4, Appendix A and Part II —“ Details of the hills of Luristan.” If a traveller approach the dominions of the Shah from the Persian Gulf or frrm Lower Mesopotamia,—that is, between the parallels of latitude of Shiraz and Suieimania (29^ 3^' and 35° 16' N.),—he must cross the vast range of the ancient Zagros, and invariably meet with the greater portion of the section as exhibited in fig. 1 . Further northwards, however, the igneous eruptions alter and contort the sedimentary rocks in such a manner as to render their recognition no very easy task. I therefore deem it advisable to describe, in the first place, the least complicated and best developed sections in the south, extending as far northward as the Ab-f-Shirwan (lat. 35 ° 8 ' N.); and, in the second place, to describe certain sections in the north, which throw light on the age of the disturbing forces, and present some interestino- phenomena connected with the deposits of travertin. Although contrary to the usual course, I propose describing the various formations in descending order, because they so present themselves to the traveller going eastward, and because this plan is more likely to be serviceable to such European travellers as may feel desirous of adding to our scanty knowledge of the geology of those little visited regions. 1. Alluvium. This term has usually, with regard to the Mesopotamian plains, been applied to the soil composing the basins of all tiie oreat rivers falling into the Persian Gulf. The alluvium may be clearly divided into—(A) fluviatile and (B) marine. (A) The fluviatile alluvium, now in process of deposition,Hs limited to the banks of the rivers, with the adjoining marshes and canals. It consists of a stiff blue, or fine arenaceous grey cky, and fine sand or gravel. These deposits are dried and cracked in every direction by the intense heat of the PART I. I.—Recent Deposits. al : e ont , Ms MMwdinifly difficult for a horseman to traverse, ley a or a ne i soil fertile cultivation of maize, rice, water-melons, cucum- bers, and the ordmary vegetables of the A rfhs; and they frequently contain imhpnrion cho c nP ^-vPirv/^f 4 - 1 .~ ^ _ V .collection, made by the late Captain Newbold, E.I.C.S., from the beach of Bushire (identified specimens are marked with an asterisk) Fossil shells from Muhammerah, Sdhlah, and Basrah. Venus. Neritina crepidularia, Purpura (Rapana) Area. Lamlc. Cerithium. Melanopsis. Purpura. Cjprsa. An examin ation of the fossils of this marine deposit [the Jezireh, or land between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates) proves that at a comparatively recent period the littoral margin of the Persian Gulf extended certainly 250 miles further to the north-west than the present embouchure of the Shatt-al- Arab, the combined stream of the Tigris and Euphrates, and 150 miles beyond the junction of these two great rivers at Korna. ’ The actual extent of this marine deposit to the north-west it is impossible to define, as, from the nntme of its formation in the shallow estuary, it probably passes upwards gradually into the more recent fluviatile beds. Mr. Ainsworth, in his ‘ Researches/and Colonel Rawlinson in a paper read before the Geographical Society in 1850, have both shown the rapid accumula tion of this alluvial deposit, which is represented to increase a mile in thirty years at the head of the Persian Gulf. It is therefore needless here to repeat the investigation, especially as I have no new matter to add upon the subject. 3. Limestone gravel .—In many localities (especially in the neighbour hood of Dizful, see fig. 3) on the outskirts of the great chain, an enormous accumulation of gravel reposes nearly horizontally on the upturned edges of the tertiary strata, or dips at a slight angle towards the plains on the south-west, in which direction it gradually thins out. Seen from the plains at sunset, these gravel masses present a very peculiar appearance, their surfaces being cut up and deeply furrowed by innumerable channels, caused by the heavy periodical rains. Towards the north-east and east, at their greatest ele vation, they frequently terminate abruptly in a perpendicular escarpment. A. very remarkable instance of this occurs about twelve miles north-east of Dizful, where, after attaining the summit of the range, the road is carried to the valley of Gilalahu by a zigzag path down the face of a cliff, which, judging by the eye, must be 200 feet in height, and is entirely composed of this limestone gravel (see also fig. 2). The escarpment bears 12° S. of E. for a distance of about 20 miles, being only interrupted by the passage of the river Diz and the Kunak stream. Magnificent sections are obtained along the course of these streams, as well as at the debouchure of the river Karkhah into the plains of Arabistan. Masses of this deposit frequently stand isolated from the main range, and, being precipitous on all sides, were formerly the strongholds of the mountain chiefs. Tangawan, at the north-west extremity of the escarpment above alluded to, is a conspicuous and fine example of an isolated gravel fortress. The town of Dizful is situated on the left bank of the river Diz, which here cuts through cliffs of this gravel 60 feet high. The actual thickness of the deposit is certainly not less than 100 feet in this locality (see fig. 3). The serdabs, or cellars, in which the natives pass the day during the scorching heat of summer, are excavated in it, and are reached by long llights of steps. Subterraneous canals called kanats, for irrigation derived from the river, have been cut by Persian perseverance for miles through the gravel at a great depth below the surface. Their course is traceable by the heaps of pebbles ■U346 thrown out at regular intervals through wells. To one of these kanats, \\ miles east of Dizful in the direction of the mountains, I descended by 60 steps of 13 inches each— i.e., 65 feet. * r/'i • • The same deposit is cut through by the Ab-i-Zal in its course from the higher ranges to its junction with the Karkhah. The section of the cliffs at the ruins of the Sassanian bridge over the Zal shows a perpendicular height of 80 feet. , Not having examined the west skirts of the rusht-i-Kuh, 1 am notable to state whether the gravel extends north-west of the Karkhah ; but from the contour of the outer range seen from a distance, it most probably does so. Eastward of the Pusht-i-Kuh, however, it occurs in the trough of the Mali Sabadan, resting, as usual, unconformably on the gravels, sands, and marls of the gypsum series. The road along this valley is exceedingly painful and difficult, as the boulders are of enormous size and obstruct the pathway. They cease, however, at the junction of the Kashgan and Hulilan streams, which constitute the Karkhah. The components of this gravel, wherever met with, are essentially the same, and prove beyond a doubt that the deposit is everywhere due to the same cause, whatever that may have been. At Dizful we have the following percentage of the component materials:— 1 . 2 . Pebbles of Compact, blue, crystalline stone. lime- 3. frag- White or cream-coloured num- mulitic limestone. Breccia of small angular ments of coloured cherts in a matrix of hard sand. 4. Fine-grained, friable, red sand stone. 5. Red, dull-green, and other coloured cherts. Quartzose yellow sandstone. Character. Generally oval or with the angles worn off, frequently 2 feet in diameter- 43 per cent. Ditto ditto, but not quite so large—38 per cent. Oval 9 inches in length—5 per cent. The largest 1 foot in diameter, cubical angles worn off—5 per cent. \ inch in diameter—5 per cent. 6 . -4 per Rounded, 3 inches in diameter- cent. White quartz. Less than 1 inch square—4 per cent. North of Shustar I observed likewise a few angular and rounded lumps bitumen; but in no instance was there a fragment of igneous rock. Kidney-shaped calcareous nodules frequently occur, having a large central cavity, lined with small crystals of calcareous spar. The matrix is of two kinds :— 7. of ( 1 ) Fine cherty sand. (2) Calcareous yellow paste. The two varieties, which are equally common, occur together. The first is, however, more frequent than the other in the plains on the eastern skirts; and the latter in the mountains. The pebbles are firmly cemented together, and are frequently covered with a thick calcareous enduit. The blue limestone-boulders are sometimes much weather-worn; numer ous regularly formed channels radiate from a slightly projecting centre, and give the boulders somewhat the appearance of the radiating concretionarynodules found in the magnesian limestone of Sunderland. This, however only occurs on the surface of the blue limestone-pebbles, and is not observed on that of any other of the components of this gravel. Throughout the whole of this vast accumulation the various pebbles are thrown together without the slightest appearance of order or stratification. They are nearly, if not all, derived from the rocks composing the mountains immediately adjacent; namely, the blue limestone from the ambiguous Lower Secondary series; the white and cream-coloured limestone and”the pebble- breccia from the nummulitic formation ; the red sandstones and variegated cherts, with probably the quartzose sandstone and white quartz, from the sands and gravels of the gypsum series, which this gravel conglomerate immediately overlies. It is remarkable that the boulders derived from the greatest distance are the most common, while a very small percentage is found of the nearer rocks. This, however, may be accounted for by the soft and friable nature of all the latter, which have been ground down and form the sandy matrix. No trace of fossils has been met with in the limestone gravel, excepting such few as occur in the pebbles themselves. II.— Tertiary Rocks. (11 Gypsiferous Series. In this series I include all the stratified deposits above the nummulitic limestone, to be hereafter described. The series consists of the following beds in descending order of stratifica tion :— ( 1 ) Fine gravel passing into ( 2 ) Friable, red, calcareous sandstone. ( 3 ) Variegated marls, frequently saliferous, with vast deposits of gypsum and thin beds of impure limestone. I have traced this formation in a north-west direction from Kazran to Jezireh-ibn-Omar (hit. 29° 4&gt;7' to 36' 3 00' N.), nearly 700 geographical miles. Ifo&gt;v much further it extends in either direction I am unable to say with certainty, though there is every reason to believe that towards the south-east it passes through Baluchistan, and is a prolongation of a similar formation described by Captain Vicary as occurring in Sind. The actual breadth of this zone varies considerably, and, in consequence of the beds passing imperceptibly under the alluvium to the westward, it is very difficult, as I have previously remarked, to define its limits in that diree- Considerable outliers of this formation extend in long lines of sandstone and gravel hills parallel to, and at a distance of twenty or thirty miles from, Striking off from it near Behbahan, in lat. 30° 14 N the Zeitun Hi Is rise into bold, rounded, and sometimes precipitous cliffs through winch tne Jarrahf river forces a passage into the plains of Dorak.^ - er con mum about fifty miles, the range sinks into the desert, and is just distingmsha de from the general level by a low, continuous, undulating me on it lonzjn thirty miles in extent. It again rises into the Ahwaz range, and, crossing the river Karun, constitutes the celebrated ledge of roc s mown as318 Band (Dam) of Ahwaz, of winch advantage has been taken for the construc tion of an artificial dam, by which the water of the river was diverted in ancient times from the original channel, for the purpose of irrigating the country to the east. About midway between Ahwaz and Nahr Hashem, on the river Karkhah, the sandstone hill called Jebel Mansur (Prospect Hill) is a very conspicuous point. On the west bank of the Karkhah the sandstone range again appears, running in the same general direction, a few miles north of Hawiza, when it again sinks into low undulations, which cross the Duwarij and Tib rivers, and joins the main chain west of Deh Luran. From actual observation of all, except the Zeitun Hills (of which, however, there can be no question), I can certify that they are composed of the two upper divisions of the gypsum series, namely, fine gravel, and friable, red, calcareous sandstone; and that the persistent character of the beds continues throughout the whole of this extended line of 500 miles. But these outliers do not indicate the extreme western limit of the gypsum formation; for I am convinced that, after forming a trough under the alluvial basin of the Tigris and Euphrates, through which it occasionally appears as islands in a shallow, the same series is continued into the deserts of the Aneiza Bedouins; and it is probably again represented in Syria. Section jrom Bizful to the Valley of Uildldhu .—Sections near Dizful (figs. 2 &amp; 3) exhibit the gypsum series in less broken succession than it occurs further to the north-west. The valley of Gilalahu presents a highly instructive section (fig. 2 ). It is a denuded valley of elevation in the sandstone series, having a central axis parallel to the main range,—namely, north-west and south-west. On descending from the gravel cliffs which I have previously described as intervening between Dizful and this valley, the axis of sandstone is seen in the form of an elongated saddle, extending in a straight line down the valley for many miles to the south-east. This axis is flanked on either side by regular parallel ridges of similar sandstone, which slope outwards, having abrupt and broken escarpments facing towards the axis. The extreme regu larity of these ridges gives the valley the appearance of a well-ploughed field on a gigantic scale. The dip near the axis is at an angle of about 25° ; but this angle increases towards the sides of the valley, and on the south-west the strata at length become almost vertical; and their denuded edges are covered unconformably by horizontal limestone gravel (see fig. 2). Several patches of gravel rest on the summit of the central axis in tabular masses ; but I had no opportunity of ascertaining whether they belong to the limestone conglo merate already described, or whether they are merely denuded portions of a bed intercalated between the layers of sandstone. Beds of fine gravel frequently alternate with the sandstones here as well as in the liamiines and at Kasr-i-Shinn. In descending, the gravels give place to variegated marls with crystals of selenite. The sandstone is of the usual type; very friable, calcareous, and reddish from the abundance of fragments of red chert. The surface of the beds is generally smooth ; but it frequently resembles a pavement of uniform diamond-shaped blocks, separated from each other by deep cracks. This appearance is probably due to rupture during elevation, the fissures being subsequently filled up with a calcareous deposit.349 A small stream flows across the valley, cutting its way through the ridors. When it comes in contact with the smooth surfaces of the beds, a thick incrustation of chloride of sodium above the level of the water-line is the result. As the water is not yet become salt, the mineral must exist in the rock itself. The oleander and the tamarisk are the usual shrubs which grow along the banks of this and other streams flowing through the sandstone rocks. I did not cross the valley sufficiently far to the north-east to be able to state whether any deposits of gypsum are there to be met with. Section at Shustar. —At Shustar are exhibited some very fine sections of the gravel and sandstone beds. The Ab-i-Gargar division outlie Karun river, after passing the Band-i-Kaisar, enters a channel between cliffs of these rocks, 70 feet in height. The stratification is horizontal, and in the lower part consists entirely of fine yellowish-red sandstone. In ascending, however, the laminae become coarser, much disturbed, and mixed with gravel; while still higher up the pebbles are larger and more common, until at the surface they cover the cliffs. Frequent and very violent currents must have been in action during the deposition of the whole upper part of the gypsum series. Upon the right bank of the Shatai’t the pebbles are large, and are cemented in a calcareous paste, with large boulders of the limestone conglomerate of Dizful. Serdabs or cellars, probably of great antiquity, are here excavated in the sands and conglomerate rock; and in the bed of the stream are huge masses of the latter, which, from being undermined, have fallen from their position. The serdabs in the town are excavated deep in the sandstone; and some little attention is paid to architectural embellishments, su has columns and pilasters. The finer sandstone is here generally used for building purposes; but when exposed to the atmosphere it peels off in flakes or rapidly disintegrates. This character pervades the whole of the gypsum sandstones. Section (fig. 3) from Dizful to Khoramdbdd. — Refer to Road Report No. 1. The road between Dizful and Khoramabad passes only a few miles to the north west of the section last described at Gilalahu ; and here we have presented a simlar order of stratification. The saddle axis has, however, sunk down ; the beds dip somewhat more irregularly, and are contorted, which appears to be owing to several undulations or folds, still bearing in the same north-west direction, but having the general dip towards the south-west. From Dizful to the Baladrud river, a distance of 17 miles, the road rises over a sand and gravel plain, without any particular order of stratification being visible. At the point where the river is crossed, near a ruined bridge, the banks are 150 feet high, and afford the following section : (1) Coarse gravel conglomerate with large boulders of nummulitic lime stone. ( 2 ) Fine gravel and reddish calcareous sandstone passing into (3) Fine gravel (chert, quartz, &amp;c.). (4) Thin layers of red calcareous marl. (5) Red sandstone (the same as No. 2 )— see page 203. A large block of the sandstone No. 5 had, from being undermined by the river, fallen a few feet from its position. The upper surface was thus exposed, and exhibited distinct ripple marks. Upon the under-surface of the overlying marl, which remained in sitiLy were the corresponding impressions strongly marked.350 From the same cliff, and from the bed of sandstone No 2, I obtained relief casts of impressions made by ram-dreps which had fallen: on the red '‘“'Between thf MadrXlv^Vand tht Bedderhu (Bidruge) stream are gravels, sand* and variegated marls, arranged in the usual order On the south-ivest the ^ravels predominate in extensive beds; proceeding north-east these alternate with calcareous red sandstones, but at length give place to considerable depo. sits of red and vandvke-coloured marks, though they still occur in connect,™ with the sandstones intercalated between the marls, but without any trace ot 'm. At llussa'ineah, where the sandstones are ot great thickness, I pro- cured natural easts of footprints, which belong to some animal ot the feline One of these foot-prints is remarkably distinct (and is now in the British Museum). The pads of the foot and of the four toes, ^ well as of the claw,, by 3 i inches wide. In form, however, there is a slight difference; the pads of the toes in the cast are somewhat more elongated. Adhering to the hollows are pieces of red clay. About an inch behind the first cast is another, probably of the hind-foot, but not very distinct. On the same slab are traces f ^Other indistinct and irregular marks are sometimes se^n on sandstones of this formation, but this is the only instance in which I have observed any indications of the existence of animal life so high up in the gypsum series. The lithological structure of the rocks, and the foot-prints which occur in them, appear to indicate some connection with the conglomerate sandstones and bone-heds of Sind and the Himalaya. They all occupy a similar position with regard to the underlying nummulitic rocks, and show that they have been deposited under similar conditions,—namely, on the shore ot a shallow estuary, frequented by land and fluviatile animals. If it be possible to found an argument from the presence of but one fossil, we might remark that a similar generic distribution of animals seems to have prevailed formerly as now in the respective regions in which they occur. Thus, while on the flanks of the Himalaya the large elephantine groups abounded and still abound, and in Sind the crocodile continues to appear as the characteristic animal, so in Luristan, where these genera aie en lie y absent at the present day, the feline tribes occupy their place, and (as tar as our evidence goes) are alone represented in the fossil stale. ^ , , The Bedderhu stream affording more moisture than is usually to oe found in this inhospitable sandstone region, the Lurs have sedulous y a\ai e( themselves of every level plot of ground for cultivation, and many are little oases seen among these otherwise desert sandstone ^ridges. On quitting the Bedderhu (Bidruge) stream for Kalah-i- Rcza, the roa c lows along the strike of the beds at that portion of the series wheie t ie gated marls are evidently preponderating over the sandstones, and ippi n » a usual to the south-east. About 10 miles to the east of the road, a fewt nnan unimportant beds of gypsum crop out from under the marls, and rest a„am the slope of the limestone chain of Tukomam, being now then c( l vr( ;\ by nearly horizontal deposits of limestone gravel and breccia in a ie yellow pasty matrix. ^ * This is doubtful.All the beds are conformable to each other; but, while the sandstones west of the Bedderhu dip to the south-west at an angle of 15° or 20°, the gypsum slopes off from the great range at an angle of 50° or 60°. Kuh-f- Tukomam is the first appearance of the nummulitie limestone north-east of Bizful. From the Bedderhu to Kal’a-f-Reza (about five miles) the same series of sandstones and marls is continued ; but from the la^er place an alluvial plain of tive miles is passed over to the Ab-i-Zal. This plain is covered over with enormous limestone boulders and gravel conglomerate, generally concealing the underlying strata; but the outcrop of the gypsum may still be observed resting against the slope of the range. I examined the junction of these rocks with great care, and there can be no doubt of the perfect conformability of the gypsum to the limestone. The beds of the former here retain the same earthy and cavernous structure throughout their total thickness, without any alteration in appearance. Proceeding north-west from the Ab-i-Zal, we enter the trough formed bv the limestone saddle of the Kabfr-Kuh on the south-west, and of the Kealun (Kheolah) range on the north-east. At first the rocks of the gypsum series, overlaid by limestone conglomerate and boulders, occupy the whole breadth of the troug (about eight miles across), and exhibit powerful beds of compact, massive, calcareous gypsum, of dirty white or grey colour, traversed by blue veins or markings {zee pages 206, 209, 214). A variety, quite white, earthy, containing crystals of selenite, very cavernous and friable, is observable where the beds are much contorted, which is often the case in the lowest portion of the series when crushed together in a trough. These beds of gypsum may be followed With the eye for an immense distance, as they strike out in long lines, or form conspicuous patches parallel to, and extending along, the base of the limestone ranges. At Pul-i-Tang, 10 miles above the Ab-f-Zal, the underlying limestone protrudes through the gypsum rocks, dividing the deposits in the trough into two parts, and throwing them up with much contortion against the skirts of the ranges which bound the valley. The two kinds of gypsum associated with variegated marls are thus largely developed at Bagh-i-Khan, on the western base of the pass over Kuh-i-Kealun, the colours of the latter—red, blue, and green—almost rivaling the brightness of our own beautiful section at Alum Bay. After descending from the Kealun Mountain, the road for 15 miles crosses an extensive tract, known par excellence as the Chul or Desert, a succession of very much contorted sands, variegated marls, and gypsum ; the coloured marls occupying the north side of the undulating plain. The scene is barren in the extreme at the end of September, and possesses neither habitations, trees, nor streams of water. In spring, however, this Chul must be very beautiful. It is then frequented by numerous tribes of the Lurs on account of the rich herbage which everywhere abounds; but the scorching heat of the summer soon converts its bright green sward into a glaring yellow grass* stubble, covering the hills and concealing the stratification. A few well-built tombs are the only signs that man ever dwells here; and these, coated with pure white plaster derived from the gypsum, are excellent land marks for the lost traveller. To the Chul succeeds a wide valley of elevation bounded on the south by the range of Tang-i-Khashow (Penawur), and on the north by that of Deh-i-Liz * By “glaring yellow grass stubble” Mr. Loftus probably means “uncut bay. The rich pastures that Major Bell passed over in April 1884 could be cut during May, and if stacked in ricks would form a most valuable supply of dry fodder.— (M. S. JB.),—See pages 8,18, 23, 301.352 (Dalfcli). These ranges are composed of the nnmmulitic formation ; hut the centre of the valley shows a thick series of bituminous blue shales (fig. 3, V), dipping conformably under the limestones, and probably of the age of the Chalk (seepage 211). The descent from Deh-f-Liz (Dalich) is covered by a thick oak-forest * growing upon limestone debris, which entirely conceals the stratification to the north of the pass; but, so«n after leaving the plain of Judikf, the marls and gypsum with soft sands appear, dipping at an angle of 30° towards the chain of Deh-i-Liz. Some of these beds afterwards attain a great development, and, rising into considerable mountains studded with oak, are traversed by several large 1 streams, which form magnificent gorges, and are bounded by high per pendicular cliffs of blue and red marl and red sand rocks, in which gypsum does not appear. ... m / This order prevails until the limestone is again thrust up at Tang-i- Chemish (Chemesk) with a dip of about 45° to the south-west. North of this chain the strata are concealed by debris as in the same position at Deh-i-Liz. As soon, however, as this debris ceases, contorted beds of sands, marls, and gypsum, the last being less abundant, occupy the trough between Tang-i-Chemish and Ruh-i-Dadavva (Dadabad), a distance of about three miles. ' The limestone then rises in high undulations, which, forming the Kuh-f-Bebbe (Bowi), finally slope down at Tang-i-Sibbur into the alluvial plain of Khoramabad. The last appearance of the gypsiSerous series to the north east in this part of the Zagros is on the southern base of the cretaceous lime stone range of Yaftah Kuh, which thrusts up the red sands and marls at an angle of 35° towards the south. It would be useless to enumerate the various sections in which the rocks composing the gypsum series present the same order of succession. It is sufficient to have shown that such order is universally preserved. To trace the numerous beds throughout their whole extent would be a work extremely minute in detail, which would require much time and labour without affording (that I can see) adequate remuneration. The absence of nearly all trace of organic life would render such an investigation in all respects unsatisfactory; and, moreover, the numerous layers of the sandstones, marls, or gypsums so exactly resemble each other as to render the discrimination of any one of them a matter of great difficulty, if not of utter impossibility. It is true that in some localities among the marls are a few bands of impure limestone containing an assemblage of crushed shells, which are probably large Cyclades or Cyrence ; but, as the characteristic features are in all cases destroyed, they would afford little or no assistance. The total thickness of these deposits must be very great, certainly not less than 2,000 feet; but, never having seen a perpendicular section through them, I can only give this as a somewhat rough approximation. An examination of the fossil contents of the gypsum series with those of the underlying nummulitic rocks does not show one form extending through both formations. As the lithological character also of these two formations is so totally dissimilar, I have thought it best to describe them separately. Still, however, when the universal and perfect conformability of the gypsiferous marls to the nummulitie limestone is considered (whether the beds of the latter lie horizontally or rise in lofty domes), we cannot by any means pro nounce them to belong to a different geological epoch, but rather consider them as a transition from the older to the newer tertiary period. * This expression gives a very false impression of the sparce growth of oaks growing seepage 212 and sketch). here353 lam disposed to think that a sudden elevation of the whole bottom of the ocean took place at the close of the period when the numrnulitic limestone was deposited, by which the species then living' were totally extinguished. This elevation must have been accompanied and succeeded by the frequent discharge of sulphuric vapours from below, which, acting upon the calcareous matter held in solution by the water, deposited it in the form of sulphate of lime. I am the moie inclined to adopt this mode of accounting for the origin of this mineral deposit, because it occupies no fixed position in the marls, but is stratified and intercalated irregularly among them, generallv however in their lowest part. Where gypsum occurs, it usually spreads over a large sur face, showing it to be the result of a widely extended cause. The*entire absence of animal life during its deposition has frequently been remarked. The order of superposition of the beds of this formation, as above de scribed, differs materially from that observed by Mr. W. J. Hamilton of the beds of the same formation in Asia Minor generally. That gentleman noticed the variegated marls and gypsum resting unconformably* upon underlying sandstones, which latter were in juxtaposition to the nummulitic limestone. On the flanks of the Zagros, however, as I have endeavoured to show, the marls and gypsums are the lower beds, and rest conformably on the limestone, while the sandstones are superimposed upon them. I do not think that this inversion of order need be of serious importance, when the great distance between the deposits (750 geographical miles) is taken into consideration. It is evident from the very numerous layers in the various beds that continual changes occurred; and therefore there need be no difficulty in supposing that, while sandstones were undergoing deposition in Asia Minor, marls and gypsums might be forming along the Zagros, and vice verm. Bituminous products .—Before quitting the subject of the gypsum forma tion, it is necessary to say a few words on the bitumen and naptha springs which abound in its lowest deposits in connection with the associated marls and gypsum. Instances occur in which bitumen springs rise from the num mulitic limestone; but these are exceedingly rare. As a general rule, however, where bituminous products appear in Meso potamia or in the Persian Zagros, we may be assured that they rise from the gypsum deposits. The only bitumen springs which I had an opportunity of closely examining were in the Bakhtian Mountains, between the curious and ancient temple called Masjid-f-Suleiman and the Mountain of Asmari; these, probably, are the most copious of any. They are situated in a wild and barren region of much-contorted and highly elevated ridges of sand stones, maids, and gypsum. Their immediate source is in a narrow ravine between lofty walls of the earthy and cavernous variety of the last-name* rock, having the strata dipping in every possible direction and furnishing abundance of sulphur, which is sold in the bazars of Dizful. A sma stream of cold water rises high up the ravine, and is increased as it descends by streamlets from a multitude of sources, most of which furms i a supp ) of liquid black bitumen and white naptha, mixed together, some o n m very abundantly. One spring yields yellow naptha alone. These 01 y su stances float upon the surface of the stream, and are conveye o an ai 1 * Quarterly Journal, Geological Society, vol. v, page 373.

Geological Society of London, 2 ser., vol. v., pages o. &gt;&gt;. - 45354 ficial dam. When the dam is nearly full, the water is drawn off at the bottom, and the bituminous mixture is left exposed to the heat of the sun, until reduced to the consistency of soft mud. It is then placed in a lar^e caldron, covered over, and submitted to a slight heat by heaping lire on the lid. \fter a^entle simmering for a short time the tire is removed, and the substance, when cold, is bitumen prepared for use. SaiyVds (or descendants of Mahamad) at Shustar enjoy the sole right and privilege of making bitumen here. The black slime floating on the surface, or settling on the white gypsum banks and detached blocks, produces a curious and striking contrast. The water contains a great quantity of sulphur in solution, which is deposited along the bed of the stream, and is collected. The stench of sulphur in the ravine is almost unbearable. From these springs are collected annually about 2,000 mauns (or 12,000 lbs. English) of liquid naphtha and prepared bitumen, which, including the expense of collecting, of manufacturing, and of carriage, are sold in Shustar at the following rate :—Liquid naphtha, 1£ kran per maun, or ^d. per lb.; bitumen, at 2 krans per maun, or per lb. There might be collected 7,000 or 8,000 mauns annually if there were sufficient demand. There are various other bitumen springs in the immediate neighbourhood, the refuse-waters of which fall into the Ab-i-Shur ( f4 Salt River ”), which is the receptacle for every species of villanous water, whether bituminous, naphthous, salty, or sulphureous, rising among the gypseous deposits of that region {see page 334). (2) Nummulitlc Series. The rocks of the nummulitic series constitute the most remarkable feature of the Zagros, and extend, to my knowledge, from Shiraz to Mount A.rarat, a distance of 800 geographical miles. They rise from beneath the beds of the gypsum formation in elongated saddles of compact crystalline limestone, running parallel to each other, and having a quaquaversal dip. Frequently, when much elevating force has been exerted, huge masses of the limestone stand isolated, with lofty precipices on all sides, bearing on their summits acres of pasturage and springs of delicious water, to which the native chiefs and their adherents can retire in safety, and, with a handful of men, defy the whole power of the Persian Government. Of the saddle-formed ridges the most remarkable is the range of Kealdn (fig. 3). It forms the eastern edge of the trough through which the Karkhab river flows before passing into the plains, and it extends 35 miles in a per fectly straight line. Seen in perspective, its outline resembles a gigantic model of the Crystal Palace, the uniform curve of the dome being very remark able and imposing {see pages 206 to 210). The Kabir Kuh, which bounds the western side of the same trough (fig. 8 ), is another example of a similar kind; but the continuity of the layers is frequently broken on the summit, and thus considerable precipices are the result, the jagged edges of which were invaluable points for the survey of the frontier. Innumerable examples of the saddle-shaped ranges might be adduced; for, in fact, this is the usual form in which the nummulitic rocks show themselves on the west of the central axis, where the elevating force has been less general ly experienced than in the interior of the chain. In the latter position, as is naturally to be expected, the strata have been forced asunder, and present mural cliffs of great height on either side of long valleys of elevation.355 Of isolated masses of the nummulitic limestone, I may refer to the im pregnable fort^ of Jaffer Kuli Khan, the notorious chief of the Bakhtian Mountain, Chaouni in Luristan (tig. 5), the Kuh-i-Safid, between Shiraz and Behbehan. The distant outline of these ranges is straight and uniform, sometimes presenting a few protuberances, but never rising into lofty and picturesque peaks.* The summit of a “ diz,” or natural fortress, is usually flat or but slightly undulating, owing to the vertical elevation of the mass, and consequent korizontality of the beds.f The great ranges composed of the limestone of this formation everywhere present a formidable barrier to access from the west. All the passes from Turkey into Persia are carried over them; and, as those in the interior are reached by gradually mounting higher and higher, step by step, they were described by the Greek histoiians by the appropriate name of ladders. In some instances the passes follow a zigzag path up the precipitous face of an escarpment, and are paved with rude blocks, but generally they are little better than goats' tracks, and almost impassable. The surfaces of these dome shaped mountains, which in the distance look smooth and easy of ascent, are upon nearer acquaintance found to be covered with huge blocks and sharp broken pieces of hard limestone, or a breccia with a yellow calcareous matrix. This breccia frequently conceals the superposition of the gypsum deposits upon the skirts of the limestone dome. From tiie base to about 6,000 feet above the sea dwarf oaks abound, but beyond that height they gradually disappear; at 8,000 feet the astragalus only grows. The nummalitic rocks attain an elevation of from 9,000 to 10,000 feet. Exposed to the weather, the limestone assumes a warm ochreous tint; but on fracture it is yellowish or grey. • r? i &lt;&gt; • In close proximity to the igneous axis of the whole chain of the fiontiei are highly' crystalline blue limestones, some of which are undoubtedly an altered^condition of the nummulitic limestone, the fossils being destroyed. this formation, and of their being when present for the most part in the state of casts, I have been unable to ascertain the newest beds. The compact and crystalline nature of the rock presents a universality of character along le In conse quence of the rarity of fossil remains throughout the whole of i ■fl-imrvcf ntirf in flip sfafp whole line of its range which does not lessen the difficulty.356 ( 2 ) valley is composed are red gravel and sandstone. Upon these rest conform ably c olid beds of limestone, which rise to the summits of the mountains around forming the sides of the basin. The dip of the whole series is 8 8 SO' The following is a section from the top of the great cliff at the foot of which our camp was situated (see fig. 5) : (1) Limestone-breccia, derived from the underlying beds, and cemented in a yellow calcareous matrix. (fig. 5, Grey compact limestone, sometimes of a light slate colour ; fracture saccharoidal, emitting a bell-sound when struck with the hammer; surface rough, weathering in deep and laige holes as if bored by gigantic lithodomous mollusca. It contains a few oslrea, pecfines, echini, casts of centhia, and univalves, which, however, it is impossible to extract, owing to the flinty hardness of the rock. In the upper layers are huge tabular masses of opaque, white, and dark-brown flint. ( 3 a) Thick bed of very hard, compact, somewhat argillaceous, light- grey limestone, with fossils similar to the above. ( 3 a) Compact greyish-yellow limestone; the lower portion in very thin layers. Fossils very rare. ( 3 &amp;) Very hard gravel conglomerate, in a deep-red argillo-calcareous matrix ; the pebbles consist of highly indurated, dark-red, and dull- green clays and cherts, mixed with a few of dark-blue limestone and yellow sandstone ; the fragments of chert and clay being small and much worn by transport. Yellowish and reddish sandstone, with thin and regular layers of the above pebbles, which are most frequent in the upper part of ( 3 ) (4) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) (: the bed. ( 7 ) ( .^) Blue, grey, or fawn-coloured limestone, exceedingly hard, com pact, and heavy, containing nummulites 'perforata (small variety), N. (AssHina) exponens, Orbitoides dispansus, Alveolina subpyre- naica, with a few spines and broken shells of Echinoderms. This bed passes into the following— ( 8 ) (gd?) Bluish-grey rock, consisting of nummulites, &amp;c., cemented in carbonate of lime, and containing the same fossils as occur in bed No. 7 : interspersed are a few layers of fragile grey marl. By barometrical measurement, our camp on the gravel conglomerate (bed No. 5) was 1,951 feet below the summit edge of the overhanging cliff. I he above section, therefore, cannot be less than 3,000 feet in height. I regret that I am unable to give the thickness of the several beds; but the nature of the cliff renders measurement quite out of the question. From the presence of an ostrea (sp. undet.) in the limestone No. '2, and also at the head of the Tauk-i-Gfrrah Pass, in connection with the gypseous deposits, there is reason to believe that the bed No. 2 lies near, if not quite at the top of the nummulitic rocks. It is just possible that it may represent the fossiliferous marls of the gypsum series discovered at Karind, since the forms of the contained fossils appear to be nearly allied, although casts such as these are always difficult to identify. The beds Nos. 7 and 8 were well exposed in the sides of a deep ravine, formed by a mountain torrent in the basin of Mungerrah, which afterwards forces its way through a difficult gorge to join the Balad-Rud river. Large blocks of this shell conglomerate, literally composed of Nummulites perforota and N. exponens with Alveolina subpyrenaica, lie in the channel of the stream t357 a few miles below the fjor^e, showing that this bed is very largely developed somewhere in the neighbourhood, though I was not so fortunate as to discover the particular locality. The last-named fossil is called by the natives “ Sang-i- Berinj,” or rice-stone, from its fancied resemblance to grains of rice. The section (lig. 5) taken from the summit of Chaoum gives a general idea of the arrangement of the beds of this formation, and of the strange dislocation which has taken place near Mungerrah by the elevation of the Be-Ab Mountain. The upper beds of the limestone, which is here white and saccharoidal, are inverted, and form a high peak, with quantities of angular debris upon the slope. This peak in the outline of the mountains as seen from Dizful* is represented by a conical protuberance. Not having had an opportunity of examining the Be-Ab, I am unable to say positively to what formation the rocks composing it belong; but I have seen fragments of ammonites which were said to have been picked up in crossing it. This, together with the conformable dip of the overlying beds, leads me to the con clusion that it is cretaceous. From the great elevation of Chaoum, the order of the Mungerrah section is seen prevailing throughout the adjoining mountains, for the deep-ied of the chert conglomerate (bed No. fi) may be distinctly traced, from its contrast with the other beds, forming a wude band wherever a cliff section is pre- sentedt {see page 210). See pages 214-, 215, where the red band is noted to be “red earth” and “red clay.” . ^ i • The orio-in of the red chert gravel, which is very widely extended, is to me a complete mystery. It is true that a bed of solid red chert is seen m the Lur mountains at Harsin, and a thin bed (of the cretaceous age) crops out in the plains of Karmanshah and Maln'dasht, and at hasley (&gt;ul near Mount Ararat ; but these are too insignificant to have been the nucleus from whence such an enormous quantity of gravel was derived. In these two localities there is no waxy green coloured chert, which is abundantly found mixed with the red chert grlvel wherever that occurs. These rocks may, however, exist in mass in some unexplored region of the Lui 01 ui i ountains. From the summit of Chaouni, the red chert gravel is traceable in a north-west direction for a distance of 20 or 30 miles, until it is shut out of view by the intervening mountains. ^ • p / \ ^CSt^^Sbout 40mi.es i^ fig. 2.)

The water flowing among these marls is scanty, and hi-hlv impregnated with iron. No traces of fossils were here observed. It is 'highly probable that these marls are a prolongation of the beds which cropout on the north side of Ghaounifrom under the Mungerrah section, and rest upon the curve of the Be-Ab (see tig. 5) It has been previously mentioned that in the centre ot the trough of the Karkhah Big. 3 ) a slight curve of limestone occurs at Pul-i-Tang, “ the Bridge of the Cleft/' through which the river fhnvs at a depth of 100 feet. At the p tint where’the river issues from the gorge, and where the limestone again dips under the gypsum and marls, upon the right bank, several large blocks hive been from* some cause or other torn from their places and overturned— perhaps by the force of the stream when very high. The under-sides of these blocks are composed of layers of scutella (sp. undesc.) with abundant casts of turritella pecten, and other shells. The same limestone probably curves upwards and surmounts the great range of the Kabir-Kuh (fig. 3). Other sections will be alluded to showing the position of the nummulitic limestones with regard to the cretaceous equivalents; and it is especially remarkable that while the former are compact and crystalline, and contain nummaliteK and allied forms of foraminifera in abundance, the latter are composed of fawn-coloured fissile layers, which are softer, though sometimes indurated, or of rotten, blue, bituminous shales. Although the beds of the two formations are conformable to each other, the characteristic fossils of each never appear together in any intermediate bed. Ammonites only exist in the fawn-coloured layers of limestone and in the blue shales; but, as soon as these rocks cease and the crystalline limestones succeed in ascending order, the fossil forms are perfectly distinct. How these changes have occurred it is exceedingly difficult to explain ; but certain it is that such is the fact, and that the crystalline is perfectly conformable to the fissile limestone.. Altered nummulitic limestone .—To the eastward of the deposits thus far described, and extending from Persepolis to near Mount Ararat, are great mountains of highly crystalline, dark-blue, and foetid limestone, in close pro ximity to the grand central axis of igneous origin, which causes the paral lelism of all the exterior ranges. The crystalline and contorted structure of these deposits is necessarily to be ascribed to the protrusion or concealed presence of the igneous mass. When stratification is apparent, it is so con torted and crushed that there is no possibility of tracing the beds. Generally all traces of stratification are absent, and the mass is of homogeneous texture throughout. The colour of the stone is usually dark blue, but it sometimes varies to light grey, and even in some cases to white. It is compact, rough to the touch, excessively hard and heavy, with a saccharoidal fracture, and a bituminous or foetid odour when struck with the hammer. It is a good buildiqg stone, assumes a fine polish, and is equally suitable for internal or external decoration, as is well shown at the deserted and ruined palaces 01 Persepolis and Susa. __When in immediate proximity to the igneous rocks, it becomes almost black, and is traversed by innumerable threads and thin veins of white car bonate of lime. Mountains of this character rise very abruptly from elevated plateaux of rich alluvial soil, and aie, as it were, pinched up at their summits into jagged and well-dehned angular peaks. Many of the beautiful plains between Ispahan and Hamadan are bounded by picturesque ranges and soli tary peaks of this limestone. The lithological character and homogeneous structure of these rocks are everywhere, however, so precisely similar as utterly to preclude the possibility of my pointing out any decided line of geological demarcation (although their western boundary is tolerably well defined); and it is to the fossil contents, therefore, that we must look for information. It may be imagined that in deposits so altered and metamorphosed as these are, the presence of organic remains is exceedingly rare. I have been so fortunate, however, as to meet with a few fossils; and, although these are very indistinct and contorted, I satisfied myself at the spots in which they occur (except in one instance) that they rather belong to the tertiary than to any earlier geological period. The really characteristic forms of nummulitcs and their allies it is true are absent, but so are also ammonites and the peculiar fossils of the secondary and older rocks. At Bisitun I observed a large buccinoid shell,—at Persepolis, near the tombs of the kings, are ostrea, cardium, turritella, fusils’?, echinites, and zooplujta more abundant than in any other observed locality of this rock. It may be objected to my supposition of these rocks chiefly belonging to the tertiary period that tlmy for the most part rise too boldly from the plain, and constitute a too well-defined north-west and south-east line invariably to the east of the undoubtedly cretaceous deposits; that, while the mountains composed of nummulitic rocks have their sides and frequently their summits clothed with rich forest trees, the blue crystalline limestone is totally devoid of trees, and generally of vegetation; and that the jagged and serrated crests of the latter form a remarkable contrast with the smooth and legular outline of the former. Tiiese differences might appear to point to a difference in the geological age of the two rocks, but they may surely be accounted for by the abrupt fracture and separation of their masses during elevation and crystallization, and by the altered state of those portions in proximity to the igneous axis. . . , I do not, however, insist upon the correctness of my assumption; it must rather be considered as a provisional arrangement, until fuit lei in oima ion is obtained to enable us to decide satisfactorily on the su &gt;jeet. piescn \\e have very insulhcient data to enable us to determine the ques ion. “ Tangs” or transverse elrfts in the limestone saddles.—Keiove quitting the subject of the nummulitic rocks 1 must not omit to mention Urn numerous and enormous clefts which pass through the elongate! imes one sa &lt;- e.. These clefts, or “ tangs ” (as they are called in Persian), are the most peculiar feature of the nummulitic rocks. All the great rivers which falHnto the Tigiis fiom the east lise interior of the Zagros ; and, as their course is geneia y (o . , • they cross the ridges of the great chain diagona y. _ , , ^ this is effected is very remarkable. Instead o flowing ^^ s out h -east dnection along the trough which separates 6 gypsiferous series, or oTthe illuvium^and aitenvards rouniling the end of the saddle at the pointwhere the extremity of its visible axis dips under the overlying deposits, each of these rivers takes a direction at right angles to its former course, and passes directly through the limestone range by means of a “ tang, ’ which appears almost to be formed expressly for the purpose. On reaching the next gypsum trough it follows its original south-east course, and again passes through the next 5 chain in the same manner, until it reaches the plains of Assyria and Susiana. The tangs are not situated at the lowest or narrowest portion of the ran^e but most frequently divide it at its highest point, and expose a perpendicular section of 1,000 feet and upwards. The width of tangs varies considerably, sometimes being exceedingly narrow, and at other times a mile or more across. ., . ., • .i i u It is quite out of the question to suppose that the rivers themselves have been in the least degree instrumental in cutting these clefts ; for, if so, we should expect to find a lacustrine deposit in each trough between the lime stone saddles. There are no such deposits. Moreover, if the rivers had been pent up in the troughs, they would certainly have forced their passage through the soft gypsiferous rocks rather than through the massive crystal line barriers. # . . . That tangs are due to the tension of the cooling mass at rurfit angles to the axis of the chains in which they occur, and have been formed during the cooling of the crystalline mass, is, I think, self-evident, the entering and re-entering angles on either side of a tang exactly corresponding with each other. The best example of this is shown in the Darband or pass between the plain of Denever and that of Chambatan, behind and east of the celebrated rock sculptures of Bisutun, near Karmanshah. This tang is no less than ten miles in length, and one and a half in breadth, and has three salient and two re-entering angles on the north-west side, with corresponding bays and pro jections on the other [nee page 71). Longitudinal f ractures. —But these chains have also been ruptured along the line of their central axis, as at Kuh-f-Bizenan. This kind of fracture is not, however, of nearly such frequent occurrence as the former; but, when it does occur, valuable sections are afforded us. Tangs have probably been produced instantaneously by the cooling of the mass, but fracture along the line of axis appears to be due to another cause, viz., to the resistance offered by the overlapping of the numerous beds during their elevation from an horizontal position. This kind of fracture is frequently observed on the summit of a limestone saddle, where the upper layers are broken, while the central mass remains entire. A very striking example of this occurs in the rock of Karind,* where the uppermost beds, acted upon by the intensity of the subterranean force, are bent down almost vertically, and broken off near the summit of the rock, presenting a strange pinnacled and drawn-out appearance of the broken edge, as if torn asunder while in a plastic state. Time and weather have of course had their effect in channeling and fashioning these pinnacles in some measure to their present forms, but their origin must be attributed to the cause assigned. Besides these clefts traversing along the axis of the saddles, there are numerous other parallel crevises upon the surface of all chains, which must be due to similar causes. They are of various lengths and depths, but usually not exceeding a few feet across. Vertical crevices are well marked on the north-western extremity of the Chenari range, upon the right bank of the Ab-f-Zal {tee page 201; sketches). * Mi’. Churchill’s drawings Nos. V and VI accompanying the manuscript Memoir illustrate tins locality.— Editor.III.— Secondary Rocks. As we proceed downwards in geological sequence, it becomes a matter of impossibility to define the precise limits of the secondary rocks. Organic remains are much more rare than in the tertiary formations, and they are in such a crushed state as almost to defy the practised eye of the palaeontologist. Sections are also more difficult to be met with, and the beds are frequently so altered by their contact with igneous rocks near the central axis as to render their determination during rapid travelling quite out of the question. In the upper part of the secondary rocks of the Zagros some portion of the cretaceous series is certainly represented, but where to draw the line of its basement is not easily determined. In one locality the blue schists of this formation appear, however, to pass downwards imperceptibly into the crystalline blue limestone which constitutes the eastern portion of the mountain ranges on the frontier. (1) Upper Secondary or Cretaceous Series. In describing the nummulitic series, I have already referred to a few sections in which the beds of the cretaceous age are apparently overlaid con formably by those of older tertiary rocks. Along the frontier no sections fell under my observation which were sufficiently well developed to place this fact beyond a doubt; and it was only in the interior of the Bakhtian Mountains that I was fortunate enough to satisfy myself completely on the subject. Section (fig. 6 ) from Mdl-i-Mir to Sar Khun, BaJchtian Mountains.— This section is on the direct road between Kalah Tul and Isfahan [see Appen dix A, pages 320 to 325). . The crystalline (cretaceous) limestone forming the rangeof Kilgird (Gilgird or Gurgxr) having been crossed from the plain of Mal-i-Mir by the Rah-i- Sultan, the Kuran river is reached in a narrow valley, flowing through a grave deposit which rests in a trough of the gypsum series.

The Merwan Pass is next crossed, in the ascent ot which the limestone beds ( 4 a) occur in ascending order. _ The cream-coloured limestone, containing marks ot fitci, appears to pass imperceptibly into the overlying nummulitic rocks ( 3 ), which are, as usual, hio-hly crystalline, and contain nummulites and pectens. &amp; The summit of the pass consists of this crystalline limestone, and the descent eastward to the Ab-i-Bazuft is over the same beds, dipping at an anode of 70°. On the right bank of this river, which Hows through a wild, confined, and deep gorge, the limestone becomes less crystalline and more marly, and an inconsiderable bed contains shark s teeth, nummulites, pectens, &amp;c., similar to those at Pul-i-Tang. . This marly bed is soon concealed by a powerful series ot the gypsiterous rocks, which rise from the Ab-i-Bazuft into high cliffs of gypsum and of red and fawn-coloured earths, mingled with gravel conglomerate and breccia, in a confused mass, as if the bed had been shot off the side of Merwari during its sudden elevation. Masses of gravel -conglomerate lie in the bed of the stream, and high up on the slopes of the mountain through which the Ab-i- Bazuft flows, t , . In this section, then, we have between the sphaerulitic limestone and the nummulitic rocks a series of blue marls and cream-coloured limestones, the latter passing imperceptibly into the nummulitic rocks. Unfortunately these marls and limestones are without characteristic fos sils; but, as I have elsewhere remarked, as soon as the nummulitic rock assumes its usual crystalline appearance, the peculiar and very characteristic remains of that series show themselves in remarkable abundance. If we had only this section, we should be at a loss whether to consider the marls and cream- coloured limestone as belonging to the cretaceous or to the nummulitic rocks. Fortunately, we have elsewhere sufficient evidence of organic remains to prove that they must be undoubtedly classed as cretaceous. It is very remarkable, however, that in no instance have I met with any admixture of chalk and nummulitic fossils, although a gradual transition certainly takes place in litho logical character. At Khoramabad the lofty and imposing range of the Yaftah-Kuh rises abruptly from the plain (fig. 3), and is, in my opinion, of the cretaceous age. It consists of light grey or bluish cherty limestone, with alterna ting and continuous layers of variously-coloured flint, chiefly black. Hie limestone is exceedingly hard and compact, breaks with a conchoidal fracture, and emits a highly bituminous odour when struck. It is unfossiliferous. A saddle is formed by the curvature of the beds, the continuity of which is, however, broken at the summit. At the centre a good deal of zigzag con tortion is perceptible in the lower beds ; but this gradually becomes less, and eventually dies out in the upper beds. The dip on the south is at an angle of 37° and on the north 25° [seepage 217). On quitting Khoramabad in a north-west direction, the stratification in the valley of the river which waters the town is concealed under loose gravel; but, about half-way to Rabat, a considerable range of gravel conglomerate is * * Unfortunately my specimens from these localities are lost. t A few miles north-east of this stream (but before reaching the left hank of the Kuran at Dupulan) I procured from a hard rock of the blue marly limestone a gigantic species of alveolina, 3 inches in length.363 •crossed, dipping to the north-north-east at an angle of 68 °. It is almost entirely composed of red and coloured chert pebbles, moderately rounded, and not exceeding six inches in diameter. The red cherts are by far the more abund ant. Limestone pebbles are rare. The matrix is a reddish calcareous sand, very hard. This conglomerate is overlaid by a thin bed of light grey crystal line limestone, in which was observed a specimen of the Pul-i-Tang species of scutella [see page 220). The chert conglomerate and grey limestone, I conceive, may represent the lowest part of 3 a and 3 b of the Mungerrah section, fig. 5 . The stratification between Rabat and Bisitun is much disturbed, and the rapidity of our march across it was not favourable to geological investiga tion. There were noticed, however, several bands of iron-stone. In describing the section fig. 3, I have hinted the probability that the blue bituminous shales and marls ( 4 r/) between Tang-i-Khashow (Penawur) and Deh- i-Liz belong to the cretaceous series. Their position with regard to the over- lying reddish sandstones ( 4 c), containing bands of iron-stone, bneath the nummulitic limestone, as well as their striking resemblance to similar beds at KaPa Kazi Zohab and the Bakhtiari section ( 4 6 , fig. 6 ), certainly favour this conclusion.* The next point in a south-east direction at which I met with cretaceous rocks is the Gilgird (Gurgir) range, on the Kuran, between Mal-i-Mir and Susan, in the Bakhtiari Mountains. This range is of a light grey, compact, and sometimes crystalline limestone, containing ammonites y a small plicated ostrea ,—a venus, and turbinated and turreted univalves. The beds are much crushed and contorted, but dip generally to the south-west, as is evident in the ascent of the pass from MH-i-Mir, where their surface is so smooth and slippery as to render it a most difficult task for either man or beast to taceous rocks, as shown in sections, gs. ^Bi^Ttpage 289); Bassaki (page 293). * The same character of rock strata was seen at Gird-i-. Khafr (page 296), and Aldchum (page 239). * The same364 At Imam Mir A'chmet, between B&amp;slit and Faylaun (Fablidn), the neighbouring range is composed as follows b (1) Hard, yellow, compact, crystalline limestone, probably belonging to ' y limpsf,onfl. In the lowest beds it becomes cream- coloured, and passes into—• (2) Hard, reddish, grey or cream-coloured lithographic limestone, very V ^ compact, but splitting into thin layers, with abundant specimens of ammonites (crushed), gryjihcea, serpula, tellina, and voluta. Interstratitied with this limestone are numerous tabular layers of a black siliceous substance giving out a remarkably strong odour of bitumen when struck. (3) Highly crystalline, blue, foetid limestone. At the pass between the plains of Sar Ab-i-Sir and laylaun (Section, fi*. 7 ), the blue limestone ( 5 ) is much contorted and surrounded by the yellow’ ( 4 ), which appears to be conformably deposited upon it. In this neighbourhood the yellow limestone constitutes the summits of many isolated l-abiilar forts, and rests on a base of blue limestone. The notorious KaFa Safid is a fine example of this. IV.— Paleozoic Rocks. The only instance in which undoubted deposits of this age were observed by me was on the east side of the Kuh-i-Kellar range, between Naugun and the plain of Cheraghur (Chigakhor ,—see page 285) in the heart of the Bakhtian Mountains. This range is composed of the ambiguous, altered, blue limestone ; but I had only an opportunity of examining an insignificant portion of it, overlooking the plain of Cheraghur, where I gained no in formation whatever. Just before entering the plain from the west, however, I stumbled upon two or three blocks of highly crystalline grey limestone, weathering rusty-yellow, filled with a species of ort/ris, which Mr. J. Morris considers as a form intermediate between the Devonian and Silurian species. Want of time during a hasty journey prevented my giving the locality the attention it deserved; but I was informed by the natives that at the summit of the range are great quantities of similar fossils. With the orthis are associated a small nucula and a few other indistinct fossil forms, V.— Metamorphic Schists. In the more disturbed portions of the blue limestone we have nothing whatever to guide us in determining the age of the underlying rocks. In immediate juxtaposition with the igneous rocks are vast deposits of dark-blue, indurated, calcareous, and fissile clay slates, which extend on the west of Kuh Elvvend (Alwand) from the district of Fendun, in the Bakhtian, through the plains of Burujird and Nehawand, to Essadabad. On the east of the same chain they continue along the skirts of the same range to Hamadan. VI.— Plutonic Rocks. Granites. Along the southern portion of the frontier no igneous rocks are exposed in its immediate vicinity; but the central axis of the chain at365 some distance to the eastward consists of granitic compounds, which there appear to the almost entire exclusion of other igneous rocks. The first point in the south at which the granite shows itself is, I believe, in the low range called Farajabad, or Khakhwah [see page 253) between Gul- paigan and Jopalag. From thence it forms the eastern boundary of the plains of Jopalag, Burujird, and Nehawand, gradually rising in elevation, until it attains the height of 13,780 feet above the sea level, according to the measurement of Colonel Rawlinson at the summit of Kuh Elwend (the ancient Orontes),—see fig. 1. Extending in a north-west direction, the granitic rocks spread over the country in the neighbourhood of Senna; but the main chain passes through the centre of the triangle formed by the three large towns of Hamadan Senna, and Karmanshah. It continues along the Avroman range, and crosses the frontier between Suleimania and Banna, from whence it may be traced in a continuous line, associated with other igneous rocks, and forming the lofty boundary chain to within a short distance of Bayazid at the foot of Mount Ararat. Throughout the whole line of its occurrence the granite of these regions, owing to the abundance of felspar in its composition, is of a very perishable nature, and therefore the ranges which it composes have a rounded and un dulating outline, not presenting any picturesque or remarkable peaks. Between the plains of Jopalag and Burujird we have an interesting sec tion (fio\ 8 ). The plain of Jopalag is a denuded valley of elevation, m which the outcrop of blue clay-slates from beneath the alluvial covering is frequently detected, the slates dipping from the central axis, and traversed by veins of coloured quartz. On the low hills east o£ AKabad village, at the northern end of the plain, the quartz suddenly assumes a great development, and is succeeded by a hne- grained and friable syenite, which is injected through in ow loun e 0 ' 5&gt; f ? s ’ elevating the slate-rocks into almost a vertical position.
