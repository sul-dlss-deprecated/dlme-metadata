No. &lt;i. A PLEA FOR A MOSLEM RUREAL 1 BY Lieut.-Colonel H. F. JACOB N.B.—Recipients of these papers should exercise the utmost discretion in communicating their contents to any other person, and, in any case, should not show them, or mention their existence, to any hut British Officials holding posts of high responsibility. 1• ) ^ / PLEA FOR A MOSLEM BUREAU. By Lieut.-Colonel H. F. Jacob. India’s Moslems are almost unanimous in their lament over the dismemberment of Turkey, not only because this is a blow to the prestige of their Caliph, but mainly because they see the decline of the Sultan’s sovereign and temporal powers. India, therefore, is reluctant to approve of King Husein’s elevation, as this is an infringement of the greatest Moslem king’s prerogative as Keeper of the two Holy Places. One of India s influential Moslem papers, the “ Ukhuwat,” is fully conscious of the growing tension between Arabs and Turks, and recognizes the necessity of making the Arabs independent, but it is strongly opposed to seeing Arabia dominated by any non-Moslem Poiver. King Husein’s latest telegram to Emir Feisal in Damascus, in which he says he is opposed to any mandate or protectorate over the country (presumably Syria), but would not object to a linking up of the Hejaz with Mesopotamia and even Nejd, can only mean that he, too, would have an independent and consolidated Arab kingdom, with, I take it, himself, or one of his progeny, as leader. It also means that King Husein is not going lightly to pass over a decision which will confine his kingly powers to the bare Hejaz. His are imperial views, and this will be our chief difficulty in dealing with him. Indian Moslem papers object to the ruler of the Holy Places having to acknowledge non-Moslem protection. So we see that both Indian Moslems and King Husein agree in wishing independence for Islamic countries : the difference lying m their respective view points—for while King Husein would be the chief of this consolidated realm, India would prefer the rehabilitation of their Sultan-Caliph as the suzerain. 2. The late Sir Mark Sykes was the mouthpiece of a move ment to make Egypt and Near East Islamism the centre of the Islam world, to which centre India should ally herself. Official India views this scheme with extreme shyness and would keep the two peoples apart, and this on political grounds. It seems that, if India and Egypt were encouraged to unite, we might be confronted with a very strong political Islam, and danger lies ahead of such an eventuality—a danger to our position m both countries—unless ourselves and Islam are more amicably disposed to each other than at present. 3. Our safest course, I submit, is to recognize tlm Caliphate of a moribund Turkey which, if placated, can do but little harm in its reduced and dismembered condition. It will propitia cm Bi 2 Indian Moslems if we discountenance the possible pretensions of any Arabian Caliph, and, secondly, it will give the deathblow to possible Afghan aspirations in this direction. Indian papers of all creeds are full of articles sympathizing with Egyptian nationalists, and we do not wish to see any solid fraternity spring up between India and Egypt when such fraternity is based upon grievances, alleged or real. By allaying Moslem India's fears on the Caliphate, and by adopting a conciliatory and lenient policy in the matter of their internees, we shall win back India’s allegiance, which is all-important to the stability and peace of our Empire. Further, we shall cut the cord which binds, politically, India’s Hindus and Moslems, who, actuated by very different motives, are now fraternizing and masking strong religious antagonisms, in the same way as are Egypt’s Moslems, Copts, and Jews, whose present cohesion is based on purely political grounds, to remove purely political disabilities. 4. Reverting to Arabia—will it not be sound to remove, as soon as possible, the. outward emblem of support we are giving King Husein qua personnel ? India is now the hub of our Moslem world, and we should take trouble to convince India that Arabia can stand alone. Arabia will require monetary support for some time to come, until her confines are fully de limited, but Arabia does not want our tutelage. Our support of King Husein is the chief obstacle in the way of outside Moslems’ acceptance of his oversight of the Holy Places of the Hejaz, and this outside attitude militates more adversely against King Husein’s chances of consolidation than these hopes of consolidation are benefited by our holding of the traces. We may not be able to give King Husein the vast kingdom he would see in Arab lands, but we should go far to placate India if Indian Moslems could see the King of the Hejaz, and Arabs generally, standing on their own legs. If King Husein can, as I have no doubt, make adequate arrangements for the next Hajj, his prestige as an independent ruler will be retained in the Moslem world outside of Arabia. 5. There is no reason why King Husein should claim the Caliphate, although Islam’s history can show the co-existence of various Caliphs in various countries. At this day Moroccans do not recognize the Turkish Caliphate, nor do the Persian Shiites, nor, again, the Ismailiyeh sects, the head of one of which is the Agha Khan. Our prime role is to encourage Arab rulers to acknowledge King Husein’s titular leadership. This can be done if we can bide our time. Men like Ibn Saud, Imam Yahya, and the Idrisi Mohamed Bin Ali, when settled o r r r ..down, each, behind his well-defined boundary, will come to re cognize that a nominal overlord is essential to the welfare of the Arab nation. It must be remembered that, in the eyes of his own people, Imam Yahya. is already an Emir el Muminin. The Turks, even, failed in their attempts to deprive him of this style. The Idrisi Seyyid has similar leanings towards this title. The Persian Shiites await the event of their “ hidden ” Imam. King Husein can do better to-day than add his name to the list of ambitious aspirants. If he elect to become Caliph, he loses caste among non-Arab Moslems who can only ascribe his ambitions to our interference—for our cause and Husein s are clearly one and the same. Others will then follow his example, and openly allege their several claims, and chaos and ill-will will result. The days of a spiritual Caliph are, I believe, past. Islam wants a temporal sovereign. King Husein at this stage cannot play this role. All we can do is to foster the several Arab states within our Empire, and to aim at their future confederation, in the hope that one day there shall emerge the strong man who shall weld them together. Let Turkey, then, keep the Caliphate for Mohammed the Sixth, and let us discourage the Arab chiefs’ ambitions in this direction. 6. Finally, do we not require a well-regulated and co ordinated system of Moslem intelligence throughout our Empire ? India has appointed from time to time officers to watch in Egypt the trend of feeling in the Indian Army here. There was a full time Glovernment of India representative in the Arab Bureau of Cairo ; he went on leave over a year ago and has never been replaced. I was asked temporarily to look after his work, but I am constantly away on tour. Two days ago I heard of the presence in 1(6), Cairo, of an Indian Army Officer, but our duties are independent and we were unbeknown to each other. Egyptian Moslem opinion is surely of incalculable interest and importance to India—and vice versa—but the methods now in vogue do not substantiate this belief. The Arab Bureau has its clearly defined duties, and has performed them admirably. This Bureau has outgrown its swaddling clothes and should give place to something more imperial. We want a Moslem Bureau, with a widely reaching interchange of ideas and aims. It is not enough to say that India’s views are widely divergent from Egypt’s. This may be so, but our aim should be a frank inter change of views, and the desideratum is co-ordination of aim. If we think differently we shall act differently, and this spells confusion. We require one common policy in dealing with Islamic questions within the Empire. While we have no one dominant principle, India is cogitating• &lt; a scheme oi her own. I quote below an extract from an Indian Moslem paper which will show how India regards the passing show. Moslems want to unite. Let us be sure they unite with our approval and the auspices of our King. It is a golden opportunity—“ For a dead opportunity there is no resurrection.” Extract from “ The Qaum.i Report, Madras,” April 7, 1919. “ The Ukhuwat (Fraternity) of Lucknow says, on the authority of Moulana Shah Abdul Bari Sahib, that some leading lights of the community have proposed to form a Moslem deputation to visit all Moslem countries and to co-opt re presentatives from Arabian Peninsula, Caucasus, Russia, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, China, and all other Moslem lands, and then proceed to Europe and place Moslem aspirations and views before the Peace Conference. “ The writer is certain that the news will be received through out India with unbounded joy. But he says : ‘ We observe with amazement and regret that the matter has not been taken up with the necessary enthusiasm.’ “ The TJkJiuwat hopes that the deputation will consist of Nawab Zulquader Jung Bahadur, Sir Fazal Bhai Karim Bhai, Doctor Ansari, and some other outstanding men, under the presidency of the said Moulana. The Deputation will be formed in Ajmir during the forthcoming Urus.” H. F. J. Arab Bureau Note. A detailed scheme for a “ Department for Mohammedan Affairs ” was submitted in January 1918, by Lieut-Commander H. Pirie Gordon and Major (then Captain) C. A. G. Mackintosh. In their proposal, the duties of such a department were enumerated as follows :— (i) To collect information and keep in touch with ail countries of the world having Mohammedan populations. (ii) To advise on the policy to be pursued towards these states, and towards Islam as a whole. (iii) To control all such political affairs in Arabia, Persia, Turkey, and Moslem Africa as have hitherto been in charge of the Consular Service, or of the Government of India, and advise as to subsidies. (iv) To supervise, facilitate, and control the Pilgrimage to Mecca as far as can be done in British Possessions and maritime countries outside Arabia—and make such arrangements as mav be possible to render it cheaper, safer, and more comfortable. r r r1 n V O '■'i i I (v) To collect information about and keep in touch with Islamic movements and movements among Moslem peoples, as, for example, the Yeni Turan Movement, so as to enable the Foreign Office to co-operate with the India Office and the Colonial Office in advising His Majesty’s Government as to policy, and to exchange views with other governments having Moslem dependencies. (vi) To study the question of Moslem education with due regard to local requirements, also to study the political effect of the missionary activity of all creeds within British Africa north of the Zambesi, and advise local administrations as to the desirability of confining the missionaries of any one creed or sub-division of a creed to specific areas, either tribal or purely geographical^ or sucli other concerted measures as may be requisite, and advise the various British administrations con cerned accordingly. It is understood that other suggestions for a department of a similar nature have been made recently, and it appears to be admitted in many quarters that more co-ordination is needed m the political work done by British officials connected with t e various Mohammedan countries, both within and without the Empire. It is important, however, that we should not introduce any innovation likely to arouse the suspicions of Mohammedans, such as, for instance, the use of offices inscribed “ Moslem Bureau but staffed and controlled by Christian officials. Further, it will be desirable to avoid inaugurating any institution wliich mffiht be regarded as an espionage or military intelligence bureau. It, therefore, seems essential that any fresh efforts we make to watch Mohammedan progress must be unostentatious and that the personnel should be carefully selected and be ot civil rather than military status. „ There is a possibility that a separate departmen 01 Mohammedan affairs would overlap existing departments, such as those of the Foreign, India, and Colonial Offices, with their political and consular services, also that it would result in duplication of research and other work already being one . various learned and missionary societies. In whatever future arrangements are made economy must inevitably be a determining factor, and it is suggested hat the duties outlined above should be undertaken, as ar as P ' by the existing staffs attached to the Ambassador, Minister High Commissioner, Consul, etc., as the case may be. thf work involved become excessive, it would be possible simply to increase the staff as required, thereby avoiding any appearanc of creating a special new office.t It may formation in London of a central bureau, headed by experts of the first order, wherein all the information collected by officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Colonial Office, at home and abroad, would be collated and published. r r m &gt;M v Si - Proposed Intelligence Service for the Middle East. (Draft Scheme prepared by War Office.) Reference attached Map... I.—1. General Deedes considers that we are not getting the full advantage which our temporary occupation of the greater part of Turkey offers from the intelligence point of view. This calls for reconsideration of our whole intelligence system in the Near East, 1 which includes the following headings :— -x v (i) Constantinople and the area at present covered by General Milne s command, including (a) Russian Mohammedans and the Islamic Centre at Kazan; (6) the Balkans. . (ii) Syria, Palestine, Egypt, the Sudan, Abyssinia and Tripolitania. (iii) Mesopotamia. (iv) Southern . Arabia and Somaliland. _ _ y (v) The Mediterranean, including Tunis, Morocco, Spain, Gibraltar, Malta and Italy. (vi) The Malay Straits and Dutch East Indies. (vii) Muscat, Zanzibar and East Africa. (viii) Switzerland. (ix) India. _ _ ' . . . (x) Liaison between other theatres, including the Intelligence Service in India and Persia. IL—L Taking Constantinople first, the question can be examined under the following three headings :— (a) Clearing up of the existing situation from the point of view of general intrigue in the Islamic world. . , (b) Laying the foundation of a permanent intelligence service for tne future. Both the above fall under the general heading “ Military-Political,^ and may be considered as in the permanent province of the Military Attache. r . (c) The purely military aspect. The Turkish Army has now been reduced to very small proportions, and normal military information can occupy but a small portion of the general intelligence work. There have been no complaints of paucity of staff on the military side, and General Milne has been given all the officers asked for ; the only point on which his wishes have not been fully met is that of grading. 2. From what can be seen in London of our intelligence system in General Milne’s command, the following criticisms may be made (i) Insufficient liaison with other theatres. Note.— This matter has already received attention, and instructions have been issued for the exchange of visits by Intelligence Staff officers between various theatres. (ii) The organisation appears to be ill-balanced ; the Brigadier-General being located at Tiflis, while Intelligence at Constantinople is co-ordinated by a General Staff Officer 1. This Is obviously an unsound arrangement, as Constantinople must be the hub of any intelligence system in General Milne’s command, and adjustment is called for at the present moment in view of our contemplated withdrawal from the Caucasus. (iii) Not sufficient is known here regarding— (a) The actual distribution of duties among the large intelligence staff at General Milne’s disposal. (b) How much and what nature of detailed information is being obtained. (c) 'Whether this information is being recorded and made available for the political side, which it most largely affects. (dj The range of secret service organisation, and how the considerable sums allotted for this purpose are expended. Bat the expression “ Mohammedan I This expression is adhered to for the purposes of this paper, world” would illustrate more properly the area to be covered. S 52 3 8/19 Am \ 1 I -m (e) What organiHation exists for tlie collection of economic intelligence. QQ What use, if any, is being made of Consular Officers. British, traders, &amp;c. (cj) What steps are ‘being taken to keep an eye on Russian Mohammedanism. 3. It must be realised that as regards Constantinople, Military-Political intelli- / gence will be a permanent service, whereas the purely Military Intelligence service can only be temporary and transitory. The current situation is in itself much more political than military, bat we are able as a military measure to maintain temporarily a much larger staff than could ever be possible as a permanent organisation. Therefore, Military Intelligence, in addition to dealing with the current- situation, should devote itself to the collection, filing and card-indexing of information for permanent records in the Office of the Military Attaches, the War Office and the Foreign Office, in addition to such other offices as may be concerned. These would include, according to occasion, the Admiralty, India Office, Board of Tiade, Butish Museum, Colonial Office and possibly the Borne Office. The question of circulation is considered hereafter. 4. Probably the best results will be obtained by forming a branch of Arbur 1 in Constantinople, which would form a common pool from which all branches of intelli gence could draw information as required. Personnel for this might for the present be drawn largely from the military staff, which could probably spare a sufficient number of officers if it was carefully reorganised, though it is not possible to say from here in detail how this can be done, vide 2 (iii) above. This branch of Arbur should for the time being work under the direction of the Brigadier-General, Intelligence, in Constantinople, and busy itself in (a) filing information for permanent records, and (b) producing considered appre ciations regarding the more permanent factors which would assist the shaping of our policy in the.Middle East. Though it would be impossible to maintain this branch when once our Army of Occupation had been withdrawn, it should be possible when the time comes to hand over to the Military Attache’s office a co-ordination of the main threads of intelligence under appropriate headings, and the nucleus of a permanent Secret r-t • o Ser [•vice. 5. To conclude as regards General Milne’s command :— Though it might be considered preferable to await a detailed report from him, the time at our disposal may be so short that the following steps are advocated for action without further delay :— (a) Transfer of the Brigadier-General from Tiflis to Constantinople with orders to—• (b) Reorganise the existing intelligence personnel with a view to allowing for the formation of a branch of Arbur in Constantinople, after providing for the maintenance of the ordinary routine service of information. The area to be worked would be the same as that at present covered by General Milne’s intelligence system, but would include the Balkans, as mentioned hereafter, and special attention should be called to Kazan. Before we withdraw from the Caucasus, General Milne should be called upon to do all that is possible to establish, via Constantinople and Tiflis, a service of agents' with the object of keeping our Government informed regarding any tendency towards an amalgamation of the Russian Tartars with the Sunnis or Shiahs of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Persia, India and China. He may have, and probably has, taken steps to do this already, but there can be no harm in drawing attention to such an important factor. 3. As regards the Balkans no special organisation would be necessary, but the various Embassies, Military Attaches, and Missions in the Balkans, in addition to reporting to London, should be encouraged to exchange information direct with Constantinople on all essential points, and for this purpose should be aw fait with whatever intelligence organisation is set up. 1 The title Arbur is adhered to throughout this paper. It might more appropriately be changed to M.I.B. (Mohammedan Intelligence Bureau). Note 1.—Intrigues regarding agitations in Great Britain may be traceable in Constantinople. 2 When the time comes to hand over it will be for consideration whether the M.A., should maintain any permanent files in his office or whether he should not be handed a precis of headings and of the situation under each heading at the time, with instructions to apply to London for any details required. f Stv 0 % III. Equpt. —1. We are now brought to a consideration of the intelligence systems in Egypt, 1 which must, of course, be in close relation to those m Constanti nople and Mesopotamia. It will, of course, be realised that under normal circum stances a military intelligence staff will always exist in Egypt independently o whatever political intelligence service is set up permanently. # . . t i ,• The military branch need not, however, be a large one; its principal duties presumably being to draw up military appreciations based on informa ion w ic could be provided from the permanent service discussed below. 2. This permanent service in Egypt could not take a better shape than a large branch of Arbur, which should deal with the following areas : Syria, . Siidan. _ Arabia (less areas dealt with by Abyssinia. Mesopotamia and Aden). Tripolitania- Egypt. „ Such a branch should be able to feed the High Commi^^^ Occunation and London with all necessary information of other than a puialy rmiita y character. As long as the administration in Egypt ^ character it should remain under the control of the Chief of Militaiy inteilige . General Allenby TattachedTs 1 Applnd'^!^ 6 'The ‘ pa^er T' 681 ' 0 ” !a we are to remain an Eastern Em P! r ® le ^ s no t adhered to there will always ' tmlfenly olily to°o“onspicuoiis at the present moment, for our Government to affairs are not so disconnected from the affairs of America, a “ stake t0 £u pp 0Se world as the paper m question suggests. i i_ f &gt;. p Mnbomnwdan world it is neces- that, because Egypt is a «-at Brutish cen i. m the ^ they enough to seek in the near future foi h ekhange agency mole remote from British interference than Cairo. r\ Here it rnav be pertinent to observe that since the reorganisation mid elaboration of the E.EJ, Intelligence last ye^Oess has been ^°wnin the Vt ai^ me than previously of the situation in the a yf ^‘ ipated b v the local recent outbreak m Egypt may, or may . ve d toLondon such as to “idl f^ of British troops. 4. It is therefore suggested that General Allenby should he called upon for detailed P™^ J ^of A^W aTthe expense of purely military branch of intelligence (a) Expansion o^A ^^ ^ the area defined m m . 2 above. (b) Proposals for liaison with other theatres. , iv tV. 3'5 WKSsrssr ttxrs&amp;rz !&gt;• f * —KlWtSXT: S&amp; the situation, can probably he dealt militarv ^side This organisation would organisation at the expense, o P^^^tTmilUary staffs, but, as in Egypt, “ lOT! ” S 52 This^ncludes the area covered by the activities of the present E.E.F. A 2arrangements for liaison in amplification of the telegraph system between Mesopotamia and India, Aden, Teheran, Egypt, Caucasus, Constantinople. Beyond this, which would tend to draw the military and political intelligence branches rather closer together, no further action is required as regards Mesopotamia, where intelligence duties appear to be carried out in an eminently efficient manner. V. —Southern Arabia and Somaliland. —Our knowledge of the situation in Asia, Yemen, and Somaliland has suffered in the pastdrom this theatre being practically no man’s child. The South Eastern shore of the Red Sea was turned over by India to the Foreign Office during the present war, and has since been considered as a sort of poor relation of Cairo. Somaliland, apart from its interest to the Colonial Office, is intimately connected with Aden, and it would be desirable that a small branch of Arbur should be established at the latter place so that material could be systematically and independently compiled in order to guide the formation of our policy in these regions. VI. Having now considered the Intelligence Services situated at the Head quarters of Armies in the Near East and at Aden, it remains to arrange for less conspicuous, but none the less important centres of information for the Mohammedan world. These may be taken conveniently in the following order : — 1. The Mediterranean, including Tunis, Morocco, Gibraltar, Malta, Italy, and Spain. No elaborate organisation is necessary for this area, and the local intelligence staffs at Gibraltar 1 and Malta 1 in liaison with the Military Attaches at Madrid, Lisbon, and Rome, should be able to do all that is required. But it is essential that this liaison should exist, and that each of the above should be au fait regarding the whole organisation, and should make full use of Consuls and traders, e.^.,the Maltese Colony in Tunis and the British Consul at Tangier. Reports should also be exchanged as freely as necessary with London and the other centres of Mohammedan information. Instructions should also be issued authorising correspondence of this nature. 2. The Malay Straits. —These connect through the Dutch East Indies with the Hadramaut, Aden, and Mokalla district, where a large Mohammedan landowning- element has emigrated. Arrangements were made fairly recently for the installation of an Intelligence Officer in Java, and an increase to the intelligence staff at Singapore 1 is now receiving attention. So here, also, all that is required is that the -equired whole organisation should be understood at these centres, and correspondence and liaison as freely exchanged as necessary without over-development. Liaison would normally take the shape of exchange of visits by officers proceeding on leave or on taking up appointments, &amp;c., and for correspondence all that is required is the issue of instructions permitting freedom of address. 3. Muscat and Zanzibar. —There is a close affinity between these two places, and though not of the highest importance, the Mohammedan current flowing between them via Socotra needs watching. Zanzibar also affords a suitable centre from which to keep independent observation on Mohammedan opinion in British East Africa. There is no reason why the service at Muscat should not remain under India as at present * no increase of personnel or even change of organisation should be necessary. It would merely be a matter of informing our representative at these places regarding the general organisation for intelligence in Mohammedan countries, and to arrange for direct inter-correspondence on behalf of the respective residents as necessary, without in the case of^ Muscat, intervention of the Indian Government, who would,'however naturally receive copies of everything that passed. ^ 7 E—1- India —The intelligence system in India calls for little comment. It is efficient and the India Office is well supplied with information. The area which it is suggested India should be responsible for is shown on the attached map, and all that 1 The diagram shows branches of Arbur at Malta, Gibraltar, and Singapore. Whether or not it would actually be necessary to form these is a subject for further consideration.5 appears necessary is that there should he knowledge of the whole organisation and freedom of correspondence. 2. Persia .—The same remarks apply to Persia, where intelligence might continue to be^co-ordinated at the Ministry and circulated from there as necessary. VII Europe.—1. In addition to the actual Mohammedan countries, it is essential to keep an eye on Mohammedan intrigues in Europe, and to ensure this it will be necessary that all our Embassies and Military Attaches in Europe should be cognisant o£ the system proposed above, so that they would know with whom to correspond direct in case of iX^point of interest to no particular intelligence centre arising. Beyond this, it may also be necessary to maintain an Intelligence Bureau m some central place in Europe, as is at present the case in Switzerland. It remains to be seen whether Switzerland will remain the most suitable centre when once peace lias been declared and Europe settles into its new shape, but this service _ should at any rate be maintained for the present. It will only be necessary to acquaint our bureau iu Switzerland with the full scheme and give them instructions to correspond freely with the various centres when necessary. VIII. London—l. Having now considered the various collecting centres of Mohammedan information, it is necessary to examine our own organisation m Loneon and see whether any reorganisation is required. The various offices which may oe affected have been considered in para. 1 (3) above. At any rate, until a Ministry oi the Near East or some such organisation is established it does not seem likely that the information received can be co-ordinated exclusively m any one of the existll kj offices and probably the present system of decentralisation, supplemented by a cent &lt;- . branch ol Arbur to circulate information received from Arbur branches to departments concerned, is the best in existing circumstances. 9 At the same time the Eastern Committee should be retained under a selected President so as to bind the whole together as at present. The Committee need only assemble when necessary, but should be endowed with executive power to deal with matters of general principle concerning the “ Near Eastern Intelligence Bureau. 3. This question involved consideration of the means of circulating information t0 ^pTobablytlie most satisfactory organisation will be the establishment m London of a central branch of Arbur under a Director and representatives of all departments. This central Arbur would receive from its branches abroad detailed information supplementary to that telegraphed direct to the head &gt; offices by the various local authorities and would be responsible for analysing this information and distributing it to all concerned. The Director might be appointed by the President of the Eastern Iffimmittee, to whom he might conveniently act as Secretary for purposes connected with proceedings of the Eastern Committee. 4 Generally speaking, tke proposed organisation’ would supplement, but not interfere withl the Listin| system, as conducted in liaison between the various offices in London; but two practical additions present themselves . (a) Liaison officers appointed by the Eastern Committee should periodically travel from one end of the organisation to the other. Ihey should have no executive power, but would merely advise and report F , (h) Officers and others should be encouraged, under, reference to the Eastern Committee, to spend their shooting, &amp;c. leave in obtaining knowledge of the countries. To recapitulate. tv 1 The proposed scheme practically amounts to the establishment of “Arbur ” branches^ throughout the Mohammedan theatres with a central branch m London. These branches would embrace all sections of intelligence work and would he complete in themselves. Their personnel would represent all services, and, e xc P where Military Administration prevailed, would normally be under the control of a Political rather than of a Military officer. But a clear understanding should b e — i _ Li-nwl previously a Near Eastern Ministry is formed, the whole question will need rloonsideratL. But tor the present the Eastern Committee practically takes the place ot a Near Eastern Ministry. it“ — 6 'i estabhslled . that when it became necessary to revert to Military Administration tKA whole intelligence organisation should again be placed at the disposal of and under control of the local Military Commander. 2. For its success it w r ould depend upon the- simple principles :— (a) That all concerned should be acquainted with the reasons for and nature of the full organisation. (b) That a certain amount of overlapping would be unavoidable, but need not be feared. (c) Freedom of correspondence. p T 7 3 'n T9 ^ 1Ve 6 ? eCt t0 if a PP roved &gt; ^ would merely be necessary to circulate to all Fimbassies and proposed centres :— (i) A diagram and map with an explanatory note on the above lines (n) Instructions regarding inter-correspondence and liaison. d. The most important step is to transfer Brigadier-General (Intelligence) from ifiis and Constantinople with instructions as to II. 5 (b) on page *. This should be done at once without prejudice to consideration of the details of the full scheme. X. In conclusion it may be remarked that in drawing np the scheme an effort has been made to upset existing organisations as little as possible and to avoid an c aborate scheme which might defeat its object by its own weight/In fact V observe this principle, that the means must not obscure the end. ’ r- w.^'^nsirTT-'T ¥ [ •S \ ] V H-1 From 5 CoxrsBwui^r in Kgv-ptian Expeditionary force To Secretary v'- &amp;r Office* 0© no ra 1 Re ad Q,ua ate rs 17th iay, 1919• Sir I mva the honour to submit for your consideration the follow in,; notes and saggeBtions regarding the permanent establishment, in the Wear tast, of some form of Central Intelligence Organisation charged ,1th the responsibility of obtaining and collating military, political, commercial and economic intelligence in that part of the ,orld, both no, and subsequent to any territorial settlement ,hich may result from the decision of the Peace Conferences- i. itie peculiar opportunities «hlch no, offer of obtaining all kinds of information regarding the countries of tne „ear East v. ill not recur after Peace conditions obtain. ] whilst trained Intelligence personnel ,ho might no, . + n continue Intelligence duties in n readily consent to continue m year Eastern organisation either at its Headquarters (presumably in CAIRO) or as correspondents in countries of tM sear But »tU eoon be lost to this form of Government Service by demobilization and dispersal to Private employment In civil life, this can na-dly be ' otherwise as long as they cannot obtain assurance of , permanent employment, on attractive terms.

The Bureau would in fact constitute a store house and clearing house for information of allkinds which is nov, dispersed in incomplete detail in various departments or temporary organisations f but mnich would be immediately available and in a more collated form* It is for the consideration of the several imperial Departments concerned whether the Bureau should be controlled by a $ear Eastern Committee in London, by the *ar Office, by the Department furnishing the Director of the Bureau or by the High Commissioner and C« in C* in gypt. Under present conditions the last alternative would seem unquestionably the best. For obvious reasons it should be independent of control by the Egyptian Government though in closest touch with British Advisers in the Ministries, with the Director General of Public Security, and th© Inspectors of the Interior in the Provinces, in this way 1% wlH be assisted materially in appreciating the political situation in Egypt. In the interests of efficiency and speed it should be able to correspond direct with the Foreign Office, ooard of Trade, British Embassies and Consulates in its sphere of activity, the Director Military Intelligence, director of Naval Intelligence, G.0,S*» Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( and subsequently with G.O.C., Army of Occupation) Governor General of the Soudan, G.G.S*, India, c.O.S., Mesopotamia, High Commissioner Constantinople, Army of the Black Sea and G.O.G., Aden. Ilia sphere of activity of tiie Bureau might at the outset be confined to Egypt and the Soudan, Abyssinia, forth Africa, Eritrea. ..ne SomaiiXande, the (pre-war)«* 4s ** Ottoman Empire (exclusive of Mesopotamia) and the Balkan btates« I'he inclusion of Mesopotamia, Persia and Central Africa might be considered advisable at a later date* the political *ork of an executive nature In connection with the Hejaz, now done by the Arab Bureau, would more properly be transf* rred to the Residency, even if this entailed tm organization of a special section in the Chancery* fhis Central bureau should near only In part a military character* Its political, economic, historical# geographical and naval aspects would te as important at least as its military aspect, the personnel composing it therefore should comprise civilians as well as military and naval officers. It might conveniently to® organised in four main branches 5 - (A) Military and Political, (including Naval ' and Aerialj ( ; v) Qoirooer© ia 1 and onomi c • (C) Historical# Kthnographieel and eographica . (D) Record office for compilation of personalities and details of suspects, and watching the activities f propagandists. A small Secretariat Staff and a well equipped Reference library would toe essential parts of the Bureau. fhe exact Staff necessary for the work can bo determined only after a few month's experience, bat the following establishment is suggested as sufficient at the outset: - 1 Director &amp; Sub-directors 5 Deputy Sub-directors 1 Librarian i csj.rtrw4t.amr to the Director1 Superintending Cltirk 9 Lady Cleris It would probably be advisable that the first Director should be a regular naval or military officer, but a civilian or a retired Officer should ; rove equally suitable when the Bureau has once been fully established and in touch with outside agencies. The Bureau will justify its existence only if constituted from first class material and if it obtains willing support from those outside departments or officials with whom it is placed in direct correspondence. Future results will depend to a considerable extent on the organising ability of the first Director nd the standard and qualifications of his sub-directors. It is therefore clear that a specially careful selection should be made in the first instance. It must be borne in mind that good Officers and Civilians with the requisite qualifications and experenee of Intelligence work will not accept employment in th Bureau unless really attractive terms (having due regard to the expense of living in Cairo) are offered to them. It seems desirab m that Officers should be permitted to hold a post in the Bureau for 7 years if found to be peculiarly fitted for the work. The following scales of pay and allowances are suggested; allowances to be Issued only during period cf dut-y uforofcd; ~*■ 1 ^ &lt;-6- Appointment Yearly pay Yearly allowances during period of duty abroad. »««&gt; rt. «. »» w&gt; m m tm xm *? *• *■•' £. 1 i s 8 f 9 ! 1 &gt; ^ 5 t i i i i 1 1 1 Director 1200 . 300 Dub-Direct or ■ 600 - BOO 240 Deputy Sub-Directors 500 - 600 160 Librarian 460 150 Secretary 400 120 Superintending Clerk 350 100 X Lady tierk 240 - 300 10O x Subject to reduction if free quarters are provided.

In scrutinizing the above scales of pay it should be borne in mind that emolusms irawn by officials in Egyptian Government employ are immune from Income tax, whereas the personnel of the Bureau will not enjoy that advantage * In view of the peculiar opportunities wnich offer in Iggypt for acquiring oriental languages it would be a wise me) sure to establish there a eehool of oriental lamraages under the control of the Director of the bureau, courses being limited to a small number of- 7 - students of high aducational attainments who would be prepared to join the Near Eastern bureau or some other Government i&gt;epartment in the uast^ if found suitable* The selection to be left to trie director.
