HB/5V797 i- r Dear Bertram* I have now reeeivad a letter from India* giving me the sequence of evente that led to our airoraft Jelene landing at Jaak with the Viceroy* a party on the 16th May. Our Manager in India* Mr. Sutherland* had been somewhat disturbed by the inaoourate weather foreoasts for the (Jwadar/Sharjah seotion* particularly in wiew of the faet that the service on the previous week had been unable to make the crossing* and to avoid the risk of damage to the airoraft on the ground, had returned to Karachi rather than spend another night at Owadar. He* therefore* got into touch with the authorities in Simla, and put the case before them* as there was not time to cable to us for advice* and the Foreign Political Department got into touch with the Persian Government and obtained the necessary authority to Isnd* if desired* mid obtained the necessary visas for the party on board. 'Helena' left Owadar westward at 08.43 G.M.T., and about that time reported that weather conditions were favourable aid that no difficulty was expected in making an uninterrupted flight to Sharjah. Sot very long after that* a succession of wireless signals commenced to reach &amp;.ar&amp;.ohi* indicating that at a height of about 1*200 feet tns ground speed was continually dropping* first to 83* then to 76* 70 and finally to 65 m.p.h.* when s south-west gale was encountered. The Pilot found himself left with fuel for 2 hours 10 minutes for a flight that would have taken 2 houre 50 mins to complete* and he therefore decided to land at Jask*'having on board with him written permission from the Persian Govern ment to do so. 'Helens' landed at Jaak at 12.50 8.M.T.* and left Ig hours later for Sharjah arriving at 16.00 hours. Yours sincerely* (Sgd.) H. BURG HALL* p.S. I have Just learned that Persian visas were not, in fact* obtained. You will probably be interested to know that according to the Persian Government regulations* British passports are not visaed for Persia if the passport bears a British visa for Bahrein. This regulation is apparently based on the Persians territorial claim to Bahrein. (Sgd.) H. Burohall. F* 0. L. Bertram* Esq., 0. B.S.* Air Ministry* Owydyr House* Whitehall* 8.

I need haraly say that we entirely share his views ae to th^ impossibility of attempting to inooroiate in this treaty any clausa enabling Imperial Airways to use Jask. The di ffioultlaa to be sursiounted in these negotiations are already unortao is, and there can be no question of intiodueing further complications. Apart from this, howevar, our views on the politleal aspect of this question P.G.L.

IMPERIAL AIRWATS LTD. zH 2547 Airway T Yiotoria Station, London, S.W*1* 13th April, 1934. Dear Bertram, I have Just recently received a letter from our Area Manager in India, who, as you know, is also Managing Director of Indian Trane-Continental Airways. Mr. Sutherland had recently met the Indian Foreign Secretary and they had apparently exchanged views about Jask, in view of the fact that negotiations are at present going on between the Governments of India and Persia in connection with a general trade Treaty. Apparently Mr. Metcalfe, the Foreign Secretary, told Mr. Sutherland that unfortunately India had less to offer the Persians than she wanted from them, and as in negotiating with Persia it is necessary to set one con cession against another, he did not see any way in which he could throw into the belting pot* our particular difficulty at Jask, without complicating other issues which were already difficult enough. As you know, the Gwadar/Sharjah bottle neck is of great importance to us, and I, therefore, bring this matter of the negotiations between India and Persia to your notice in case the appropriate Departments at home should consider that the use of Jask could be raised in these negotiations without the home Government in any way losing face with the Persians. If you consider the circumstances Justify your approaching one of your colleagues in the India Office in this matter, I should be very glad to hear in due course their views on the suggestion.
