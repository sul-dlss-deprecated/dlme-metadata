Sven if the contention set forth in paragraph 2 above is correct I would not suggest that the Trap Petroleum Company should be encouraged to apply for the unallotted area.

I recognise, however, that this is only a reasonable attitude so long as an agreement is arrived at airly soon, and that it is not desirable that procrastination should leave a potential oil area either undeveloped or exposed to the encroachment of an &amp;n$riean company in virtue of a vague concession from Jbn gaud. :1 ' J prospects for the negotiations, when they are reopened, are not encouraging. Ibn gaud has been given satisfaction on several points which he had much at heart - the manumission of slaves, the eouality of Arabic with ■ English in the treaty of Jedda, difficulties at Bahrain, and the control of the legation dispensary and medical staff: on the frontier questions it is difficult for us to go farther than we have already gone; ^uad Bey Hamza’s enquiries about a loan met with a discouraging reception in the City: in the matter of the He.jaz Railway no solution is in sight; ana in the three other major questions - Kuwait Blockade, landing facilities for aeroplanes, and the debt due to His majesty’s Government, we want something from Jbn Saud and have nothing to offer in return. The only important factor that J can find on the other side is Jbn Baud’s undoubted desire to remain on good terms with His Majesty’s Government and it maybe that having accepted aeroplanes and technical assistance l mm the Italians as a gift he may feel called upon to be accommodating towards His Majesty’s Government to emphasise his impartiality. The limitation which the doubt about the frontiers places upon the search for oil and minerals may also serve as an inducement to speed in negotiation. j would not place either on one side of the argument or on the other Gheykh Yusuf Yasin’s personal enquiry about the training of Gauai aviation personnel in the United Kingdom as J cannot believebelieve it to be a serious proposal. 6. ^uad Bey Hamza returned to Jedda on November 22nd, while this despatch was being written, and I hope to have ah opoortunity within the next few days of reopening the frontier Questions, beginning with the Hejd-Trans-Jordan frontier, which offers the best prospect of a settlement, and passing at once to the question of the eastern and south eastern frontiers, where the point of departure will be the position taken up by Sir Andrew Byan, viz. that he was given reason to expect that a compromise would be proposed by the Saudi Government and that it is for them to produce alternative proposals to those which he placed before them at Niyadh - see, for instance, paragraphs 6 and 9 of the record of his conversation with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on May 30th, a copy of which was sent to the Noreign Office in his despatch No. 160 dated June 1st.

Dear Major Longrigg, I have to thank you for your two letters Nos. P.C.44/177 and P.C.44/180 of 21st October and 22nd October. v e haye received the information contained in your letter of the 22nd October about the orea of the concession oi the Standard Oil Company of California with interest, since the version which had previously reached us of that •oncession aid not specify the area, but contained an entirely different Article 2 referring merely to an area “previously agree* upon between the parties'*. The article you quote presumably comes out of this hitherto private and confidential previous agreement; but I should be interested in anything you tell me about the source of your information on the subject. as it now seems clear that all the eastern and south eastern territories of Saudi Arabia up to the frontiers of Qatar/ S.H. LongriggQatar, Atm Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate (wherever those frontiers may ultimately be fixed) have already been allotted to the Standard Oil Comoany of California, I presume that there is no further question of your Company trying to obtain a concession from King Ibn Saud in respect of this area. It now seems in fact that the only means st .11 open to your company to obtain control over part at least of any oil deposit which may exist in the neighbourhood of the Rub'al Khali will be by means of such concessions as they may be able to obtain from the rulers of the neighbouring non-Saudi territories. Yours sincerely,r No.311. (E 6686/260/91) Confidential. 7774 I 'REIGN OPPICE, S.W.l. 29th October,, 1936*. Sir, I have to invite a reference to my printed despatch No.303 of the 23rd October enclosing a copy of a letter of 22nd October from Major Longrigg to Mr. Rendel, and to connected correspondence regarding the desire of Petroleum Concessions Limited to obtain an oil concession in the Rub'al Khali area. quotes what purports to be the text of Article 2 of an Agreement between the Standard Oil Company of California and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the area covered by the Company’s concession. Article 2 of the text of the concession, as end ted in Mr. Calvert's despatch No. 235 of the 25th July, 1933, runs 'The zone which is subject ”to the full right referred to in Article 1 of this ’’Agreement has already been agreed upon between the two “contracting parties'. Moreover Mr. Calvert drew attention in his covering despatch to the lack of information con tained in the conooasion regarding the area to be exploited and to the apparent intention of the parties to keep the precise area secret. In these circumstances I shall be interested to learn whether you have any information tending to coniirm the accuracy or otherwise of the definition quoted by Petroleum Concessions Limited. Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., You will observe that Major Longrigg’ s letter 3 .3 . At first sight, however, there seems no reason to ioubt the general accuracy of the Company's information about the area, since all the evidence hitherto available has pointed to the fact that the concession of the Standard Oil Company of California covered a very wide area in the eastern and south eastern parts of King Ibn Baud's dominions. The fact that the Company have actually been prospecting in the Jabnn oasis suggests that they are unlikely to set any arbitrary southern limit to their operations, and it may be presumed that they propose to operate right up to the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia so soon as those frontiers are definitely fixed, i.e. right up to whatever line is eventually decided upon as separating King Ibn Baud's territories from those of Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate. 4. In these circumstances it seems clear that Petroleum Concessions Limited have been forestalled by the Standard Oil Company of California as regards an oil concession in any territory in the Rub'al Khali under King Ibn Baud's sovereignty and that their only hope of obtaining an oil concession anywhere n^ar this area, lies in obtaining concessfons covering all the unrounding territories, i.e. ti ose of Qatar (where they already hold a concession) Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate. The value of these concessions will presumably now depend much more than was at first anticipated upon the distance inland at which the frontiers/frontiers of these territories are eventually drawn, iou will appreciate that this constitutes a further reason for making a renewed effort to reach a rapid settlement of the south-eastern frontiers question with King Ibn Saud, since the longer such a settlement is delayed the more risk there is of the Standard Oil Gomx^any striking oil in their south-eastern areas and of King Ibn Saud being thereby encouraged to increase his claims. Similarly, should oil be struck in any part of the Rub’al Khali, the- sheikh of hbu Dhabi, the Sultan of mluscat and the chiefs of the *-».den Protectorate may well for their part also seek to increase their terms and to put forward exaggerated demands, both in their negotiations with Petroleum Concessions Limited for the respective oil concessions involved, and - what is of more immediate political importance - in connexion with the frontier negotiations proceeding between His Majesty’s Government ana King Ibn Saud. 5. In these circumstances I shall be glad to have any observations which you may wish to offer upon the general situation, and in particular upon the prospects of re-opening successfully in the near future with the Saudi Government the negotiations regarding the south eastern boundary question, bearing in mind the increasing importance and urgency which this question may now assume. I am, with'great truth and r egurd. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.) G. W.

But it seems clear from Longrigg’s letter of the 22nd October, which we have compared with our previous papers about the California Arabian Company's Concession, that the area in which Petroleum Concessions Ltd. are interested is already given, so far as Ibn Saud can give it, to the American Company , and that so far as Petroleum Concessions Ltd. are concerned there is no more to be said_- ajr 0* K htiicaf ^ fdT/lA ^ 1 The position in regard to the boundary question does not appear to hP o-ffected bv this correspondence. ^ ^COPY (E 6686/260/91) p.c.

Dear Mr. Rendel, With further reference to our conversation of the 2Qth instant, and ray letter to you No. PC.44/177 of yesterday, 1 find that Article 2 of the Standard Oil Company of California 1 s Agreement with the Saudi Arabian Government of 1933 reads as follows;- M The area covered by the exclusive right referred to in Article 1 hereof is all of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its Eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters) westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the Northern boundary to the Southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north 30 degrees west to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end ox the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south 30 degrees east to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia. For/ G. W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G*,For convenience this area may be referred to as the exclusive area” . rt No delimitation of the western edge of the Dahana has, oi course, taken place* iitill less can one indicate exactly on a map the northern end or southern end of that edge, and this is fully admitted by the California Company themselves* As, however, their exploration parties have, with LiSadi Arabian escort, visited the Jabrin Oasis (and west and south oi this), it is evident that the southern prolongation of their 'western edge of the Dahana boundary' would give them, if no other elements came into the case, the whole of that Ruba* al Khali area about which I approached you on Tuesday. You may perhaps feel this to be an additional reason for postponing our application to Ibn Saud for that area. I have gathered in conversation with Mr. Lloyd Hamilton, the California Company , s Chief Representative in London, that this very generous interpretation of their boundary has not, in practice, been rejected by the oaudi (rovernment.
