An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 4-195; these numbers are also written in pencil, and can be found in the same position as the main sequence, but they are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence regarding negotiations between the rulers of Bahrain and Qatar, Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah and Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī respectively, concerning the disputed ownership of Zubarah on the Qatari peninsula and the strained relations between the two countries.These negotiations were mediated by Britain's Political Agent in Bahrain, Tom Hickinbotham and the majority of the correspondence is formed of letters - in English and Arabic - between him and the two leaders, as well as with Salih bin Sulaiman al-Manai, the Secretary of Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī.The file contains two copies (one in English and one in Arabic) of an agreement signed by Qatar and Bahrain in order to restore friendly relations between the two states on 24 June 1944 (ff 86-87).The file also contains a memorandum on Zubarah written by Charles Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (ff 185-190).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003ac#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003ac#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003ac#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
