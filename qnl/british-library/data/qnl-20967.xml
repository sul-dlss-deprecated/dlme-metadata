The local merchants have recently subscribed F. •50,000/- and the Shaikh has given a present of F .10 ,000/- towards the reconstruction of the pier; as you saw during your recent vi. it the worn is being iJ&amp;ry well carried out and I venture to think that a gift of this sort from us would be a fitting mark of our appreciation of the reform. The line would, l understand, need new sleepers'and plates, but these could be arranged for locally I think. If it is not possible for us to make present of the line, the Customs Administration might like to take it over at a valuation, in w ich case I could arrange to send a representative of tne Custons ever to see it.
