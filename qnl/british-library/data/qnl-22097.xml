MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. z - EPIDEMICS. Apart from the usual run of measles,chickenpox,mumps and whooping cough,there were no major epidemics. Cholera was the only potential danger from Egypt,but for- -tunately no infection occurred in Bahrain despite rumours. Large quantities of vaccine were imported as a precaution, but inoculations were only carried out for the staffs of hospitals,shipping departments and people travelling. No smallpox was reported for the second year in succession. A further 3695 vaccinations were done chiefly among schools. Enteric,during the latter half of the year,rose to a sharp short peak giving double the figures of last year. This is seasonal with a low mortality but never reaches epidemic proportions. ITEMS OF SPECIAL INTEREST . The lunatic asylum , formerly under the Manama baladya,was taken over by the medical department at the beginning of the year and established on medical lines with a trained mental nurse from India in charge. Pulmonary T.B. is being treated with greater success by long intensive courses over several months,phrenic avulsion,and artificial pneumo-thorax therapy. Pneumonia showed a 50£ increased incidence and of an un- -usually toxic nature. Mortality was not high,but delayed resolution with debility very marked. The increasing number of patients from outside Bahrain is tending to cramp the hopital accommadation. 10$ of inpat- -ients were from Saudi Arabia,the Trucial coast and Iran, particularly from the former. They come chiefly for op- -erations usually for the eyes. Those of Saudi arabia are always willing to pay high fees to be admitted but the others are usually very destitute. The Bahrain Medical Society at the end of its third year held a medical congress for Persian Gulf doctors on Novem- -ber 4th X'* This, the first of its kind, was an experiment to see in what ways different doctors,both British and American,were dealing with the problems of this are^.. At IB outside doctors attended^the meetingswere a great success^ and there is no doubt of ^ts uljrimate future va' T ‘- is hoped to make this an annual proeedure.. ■ • : ■GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. - 3 MALARIA. The Bahrain Government is now paying £ 6000 a year on control measures. The benefit from this accumulates annually. Its incidence this year reached the lowest recorded level of 6.4$ of all outpatients seen compared with 1% in 1947. VENEREAL DISEASE^ 1287 patients were seen this year and despite good and ■willing response to treatment the incidence remains high and is a menace. In November the four leading doctors of the island sent a letter to His Highness Sheikh Salman stating the bald/^ facts and requesting a discussion of the whole matter. His Highness showed a keen interest, asked for proposalsand agreed to all those put forward. The resulting decisions have been the means of formulating a scheme which will go far in controlling this disease. This takes the form of free but corngu^^C^ treatment for all patients in Bahrain. Those found infected and not complying will be reported to the police and action taken. After treatment patients will be given a certificate signed by one of the European medical heads of hospitals which they are to keep and produce when requested. The scheme has been in action five weeks with an amazing— -ly rapid response,and already there is an indication that it will be prove to be a far reaching public health measure. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR^ Good health. No epidemics. An increase in sporadic enteric. A sound anti—V.D. scheme inaugurated and in action. A rapidly cooling Autumn and cold early winter which resulted in a low incidence of malignant malaria. A marked increase in patients from surrounding countries. Dated 7.1.49.

Dear Sir, As requested in your memorandum of 3rd January, we enclose a brief report on our operations for the year 1-948. Yours faithfully, For The imperial lank of Iran Ct.H.KSAST ManagerCONFIDENTIAL Summary of the operations of The Imperial lank of Iran. Bahrain, for the year 1.948, The 3ank ! s business showed a considerable expansion compared with previous years and our turnover in facilitating and financing the importation of goods into Bahrain was more than doubled. We attribute this partly to the ''act that more goods became available for importers, particularly from the United Kingdom, and partly to the fact that more merchants are availing themselves of our faci lities, We believe that we are now receiving a larger share of the business offering than formerly. Our purchases of exchange were confined almost entireljv to sales by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, as exports from lahrainjmiainly to Saudi Arabia and the relative exchange does not pass through the banks. Our sales of exchange were mainly on India and the United Kingdom against goods imported under Documen tary Credits or bills for collection. Rates of exchange remained substantially unchanged throughout the year. During the year we repatriated Rs.1,600,000 in Indian notes to Bombay and Rs.1,000,000 in Pakistan notes to Karachi. In July, we were authorized to open credits and issue drafts in U.S. dollars against our customers own dollars, which they obtain in the free market. The source of these dollars is mainly the sale of salary and personal cheques by American employees of the oil companies in Saudi Arabia who require rupees for their local expenses. The Arabian American Oil Company have also recently been selling dollar drafts to local merchants, in exchange for Saudi Rials, and these drafts also are resold in Bahrain for rupees. The total amount of free dollar cheques handled by us exceeded /800,000 of which ^300,000 ware resold to merchants in Kuwait. In September the Bank opened a new branch in Muscat, but up to the present operations between Bahrain and Muscat have been on a small, scale. An increasing number of merchants avail themselves of the facilities we offer for banking business \Jith Kuwait and Dubai where we have branches. In November, our Chairman Lord Kennet and our Teheran Chief Manager visited Bahrain and were much impressed by the general activity of the bazaar and by the variety and quality of the goods on sale. Barly in the year our staff was augmented by the appointment of a British Accountant, but we are still handicapped by an inadequate staff. We are perse vering with our original intention of employing mainly local men, who unfortuna tely require a long period of training before they are of much use to us. Our present temporary office premises are now quite inadequate and the build ing of our new office was begfcn in October and should be completed by the end of J 1949.\ TELE EN CLAIR FROM P.R.

For the norths of Dhulqaada and Dhulhaj, 4 lbs of wheat per adult for village residents ms also issued t their ov«n request, to Manamah bakers for the purpose of broad making# It will be noted frco the above that the price of wheat gradually increased towards the end of the year# this ms due entirely to increased prices at source of supply# S imilar ly the } rice of controlled bread varied froa fts 1#4#0 per ruba of 20 gurrs Idiubas to Rs 1,6.0 per ruba of 22 gurrs khubas.

Rice supplies which had been adequate in the open market for the first six months of the year# gradually dwindled# imports failed and prices inevitably rose to as much as to 5/- per ruba of 4 lbs towards the end of the year.- 5 © Tho rise in the price of sugar had an adverse effect on the barter trade, pr oes ruling in Bahrain being the s&amp;ZLe as in hersia, thus there being no profit to be nado by I.akhudhas bringing live stock to Bahrain on barter articles, prices of meat also rose considerably.

The Victoria Memorial Hospital functioned under the auspices of the Government of India for the first 3 months or the year under review and during that period its role continued to embrace Quarantine duties, the running of a public dispensary and a 12 bedded hospital together with the medical attendance on the staffs of the Residency and Agency, the personnel of ships’ crews and the employees of certain local business firms. ist April, the hospital was taken over by His Majesty’s Government and from that date the dispensary and hospital were closed down but the other activities con tinued to function.^ Accordingly the sickness returns sut mitted in this report are for the most part in respect o: a reasonably healthy adult communlt , many of whom are non-locals and so they cannot be taken as a guide to the general health conditions in the Island and are statistically unsound lor comparison with previous year’s returns. change . 1st January to 7th June i Captain M.L.A.

There wer no epidemics and no cases of smallpox, cholera, plague, or typhus. Broadly speaking one encountered during the summer months such effects of heat as exhaustion, toils, and prickly heat and in addition Gastro* intestinal infections while during winter, the sickness rate decreased appreciably and common colds, Asthma and Influenzal condi tions were the chief complaints. A * The incidence of malaria showed a decrease on the previous year’s figures and this must be attributed to the anti- malarial measures carried by the Bahrain Govrrnment. ESiX^V r JBS* Despite the fact that during the latter part of the year, the incidence of enteric amongst the local populatioi sho ed a short peak, only 4 cases are reported. This im munity may be attributed to protective inoculation. YhlirHKAb Dl.r AGE: Syphilis and Gonorrhoea in the ratio of alout 1 to 2 were very prevalent amongst ships’ crews, the infection in all c?&lt;ses being acquired ex Bahrain. fil‘ The majority of the cases reported are in respect of the local population, a few cases of the Bacillary type were seen d ring my time. Tuberculosis2 TUBERCULOSIS ; The figures chiefly apply to the local population. I saw only 2 cases of Pulmonary T.B. amongst Chinese crews. OTHER INF!CTIOPS DISEASE : There were 34 cases of Whopping cough and no case of chickenpox, measles, mumps, etc. re corded . SURGERY : This was confined to work of a minor nature and included suturing of wounds, incision of abscesses, dental extractions etc. QUARANTINE WORK : On the 13th December a dispensary was opened at the Sitra Causeway in a building provided by BA CO on rental. In vie of the heavy traffic at this port, this dispensary will provide better facilities for quarantine supervision and the medical attendance on ships 1 crews. A part time health inspector has been appointed to carry out quarantine duties at Muharraq Airport. The work at marine airport is still being done by the Customs 0‘ f'icer. However, it is now found that practically all air passengers are in possession of valid certificates of vaccination and inoculation. The supervision of crews engaged in d; ow traffic and passengers carried by such traffic, presents the chief quarantine difficulty. Recently the Gov mment of Bahrpin has been requested to take action in the ma’ter, but I con sider that the proposed appointment of a Health Inspector to cover this work, will best solve the problem.THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED A W A L I, Bahrein Island.

Yours very truly, CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Confidential. R A h't \rj WW)THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED 1948 ANNHkL REPORT INTRODUCTION The activities of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited in the Sheikhdom of Bahrein during the year of 194-8 are reviewed in this report and brief details covering oper ations in the Producing Field, Refinery and related facilities are presented. During the year the Refinery was operated at maximum crude oil running capacity, which was appreciably higher than in any previous year as a result of alterations to existing plants. As a consequence of the increased crude running, shipments of products also increased, with the total exceeding shipments in any previous year. The new facilities for asphalt manufacture were commissioned early in the year. A new Reform ing Unit was constructed during 194-8 and was commissioned late in the year, and a Seduced Crude Vacuum Distillation Unit, a turbo-generator, and miscellaneous product tankage were under construction at year’s end. Tabulations are presented showing:- I. The status of all oil, gas, and water wells as of December 31? 194-8. II. The monthly oil and water production and daily averages during the year. III. The purpose, size and type of buildings standing as of December 31? 194-8. IV. The nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity of the Company at Bahrein on December 31? 194-8. The location of wells, camps, pump stations, pipe lines, roads, refinery and miscellaneous facilities are shown on the map included with this report.PRODUCING FIELD FIELD DEVELOPMENT AND WELL REPAIR. DEVELOPMENT One new well was drilled and completed during 1948 and another point of oil withdrawal was provided by gun per forating an existing Second Pay Siltstone well and recomplet ing it to produce selectively from Second Pay Limestone and Second Fay Siltstone. started late in 1947 have continued throughout the year and are still in pro ress. High formation pressures and other difficult drilling conditions have combined to make the rate of progress slow but valuable information is being accumulated. REPAIRS A total of ten wells have been worked on to correct unsatisfactory mechanical conditions or guard against corrosion failures; work was in progress on two of these wells at the end of the year. In addition to these repair jobs, three wells have been abandoned during the year and a fourth is in process of abandoning. irrigation requirements in Awali, and thereby reduce consump tion of Zellaq water, was carried a step further by the com pletion of two additional wells; the slow delivery of pumping Drilling operations at the deep test well which were Tabulation No. I gives the status of all gas and oil wells in the field as of December 31st, 1948. DQi.iESTIC water supply. The scheme, which was mentioned last year, for the development of a source of vater from Water Zone 'G” to meetequipment has prevented completion of this work. Further efforts to reduce the demand on Water Zone ,, B H have been made by the increased utilization of sea water in the Refinery and the drilling of a well to Water Zone 'C” to meet the increased requirements of the expanding refining facilities. Tabulation No. I-A shows the status of all Company water wells as of December 31^t, 1948.PRODUCTION The Bahrein Field produced 10,914*905 net barrels of crude oil during 1948 or at a daily average production rate of 29*822 net barrels. This total figure is approximately one and one half million barrels more than in 1947. The net oil production and daily average production rates are given by months in Tabulation No. II. The daily average rate of production was increased during the first two months of the year until the rate of 30,000 barrels per day was obtained. This increased rate of withdrawal has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in gas injection rate. GAS INJECTION The rate of gas injection to First Fay and Second Pay Siltstone through Well Nos. 66-1F (62) and 44-1F ( 78 ) has remained practically constant throughout the year. The increase in injection rates mentioned earlier in this report was taken to Second Pay Limestone through 'Well Nos. 48-17D ( 63 ) and 43-1F ( 75 ) during the earlier part of the year and latterly to Well No. 43-1F ( 75 ) only. Well No. 48-17D ( 63 ) was removed from injection service and converted to Second Pay Siltstone oil producer. Gas for injection purposes was obtained from Fourth Pay Zone ,, E H as in previous years and the supply from Well No. 74-IF ( 51 ) * which up to last year was the only Fourth Pay Zone 'E” gas producer, was augmented by gas from 'Well No. 71-5FEDGE JATEi-i ENGRQAGnkENT Water production for the year averaged 1674- barrels per day* This is a reduction over last year's average figure of 1692 barrels per day and is a direct reflection of well repairs and the effect of increased rate of gas injection. The water production expressed as a percentage of the total liquid withdrawn is 5*6?o compared with 6.2/b for 194-7• The total water production and daily average rate of water production is given by months in Tabulation No. II.CRUDE OIL h A N D L BAHREIN CRUDE. The Field oil gathering and delivery facilities underwent extensive repairs and improvemenss during the year. Two new pumps were installed to deliver oil from the Field to the Refinery and a new gathering system is under construc tion along the east flank of the producing field. The replacement of corroded sections of the manifold piping has continued at the five Tank Batteries and vapour manifolds have been installed to reduce internal corrosion of the tank roofs. The replacement of corroded tank roofs and side staves has been carried out where necessary. ARABIAN CRUDE OIL . Receipts of Saudi Arabian Crude through the Arabian- Bahrein submarine pipeline totalled 43,042,490 net barrels during the year and an additional 1,044,313 net barrels were received by tanker through Sitra Terminal, making a total of 44,086,803 barrels received in the Refinery. EX FLORA I I ON OF ADDITIONAL A RE.A Structure drilling activities have continued throughout the year in the Jarim and Hawar Island areas. Eight structure holes were drilled in waters surrounding Hawar Island and five in the waters to the north of Bahrein and Muharraq Island in the general area of Fasht al Jarim.In order to obtain greater information, plans were made early in the year to conduct a geophysical survey of the water covered areas of the Additional Area* With this end in view arran ements were made to obtain the necessary equipment and personnel and actual operations were started in December, 194-6. REFINING OPERATIONS Operation of the Refinery was at a high level of throughput during 1948 and the total crude run amounted to 54,596,690 barrels. Product shipments were as follows:- Aviation Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel Fuel Oil 114,765 barrels 12,942,732 barrels 5,460,683 barrels 9,010,394 barrels 22,179,809 barrels Total 49,708,383 barrels Of the above aviation gasoline 11,268 barris were of Bahrein manufacture and 103,497 barrels were im ported partly from the United States and partly from Abadan. The above crude running represented approximately a 19$ increase over 1947 operations, and was made possible by alterations to existing equipment, and operation on an exacting shipping schedule. REFINERY . The following major operating facilities were completed during 1948:- a) No. 3 Thermal Reformer was installed and put into operation. b) The Reformed Gasoline Lead Sulphide Sweetening plant was completed.c) Tanks 2?6 and 356 in connection with the above were completed and placed in service.

The following Refinery facilities, under con struction in 1947&gt; were completed in 1948. a) The improvements to the Power Kerosene Lead Sulphide Treating Plant were completed and the plant put into service. b) A shelter containing toilets and a shaded and paved space for meal.*time use by NCD employees was finished. Incomplete Construction started during 1948 includes:- a) No. 4 Vacuum Unit. b) No. 9 Turbo-Generator. c) No. 7 Boiler. d) Refinery Tanks 126 and 362 . e) Reformer Cooling Tower. f) New parallel 48” Salt Water line from the High Lift Pumphouse. SITRA . At Sitra Terminal, product storage facilities have been increased by constructing 11 tanks which are all in service together with a new cutter stock pump, lines and services. At the causeway pierhead, launch berthing facilities for the offshore geophysical survey work being conducted by the Producing Department were installed and are in service.MALI. Staff housing accommodations were considerably increased during 194-8. The new housing completed totalled 133 family units and 95 bachelor accommodations. The family units include 16 court apartments, 32 locally fabricated one bedroom duplex units and 16 prefabri cated one bedroom duplex un:!ts; 24 prefabricated two bed room duplex units and 45 prefabricated two bedroom detached units. Family accommodations now total 3°6* The bachelor accommodations completed in 1948 include 15 senior bachelor apartments, 14 intermediate bache lor accommodations, 48 junior bachelor accommodations, and a dormitory 25 feet by 210 feet, containing an office and 18 bachelor accommodations. An Executive Guest House was under construction at the end of the year and will be completed in 1949* Additional housing scheduled for completion during 1949 totals 74- family units and 52 junior bachelor accommodations. The Awali boundary fence has been relocated toward the South to permit extension of the new housing area to accommodate the 1949 housing. The area of Awali is now 390 acres. An extension of Awali hospital, west building, to enlarge the X-ray room and laboratory has been completed. Extensive alterations to the Awali mess-hall kitchen have been completed. Additional equipment is on order.The first room of a six classroom extension to Awali School is nearing completion and will go into service Ijth January 194-8. Construction of the five additional classrooms to be built is scheduled for completion by 15th March 194-9* A two story extension to the Main Office building Awali, has been started. Foundation work has been completed. The extension is scheduled for completion during 194-9• Extension of No. 3 A.C. Plant is almost complete. Four turbo-compressor; cooling units have been installeo. Two were in service during the summer of 194-8. A third cooling tower section has been erected. Extension of the electric substation is under construction. A distribution system of 6 n pipe mains for Zone water is being installed. Three deep well pumps recently i received will be installed as soon as possible. This system will provide fire protection and garden irrigation-water independently of the Zellaq water system. The water treating plant at Awali has been enlarged and now supplies treated water to the la undryj messhall and steam plant. An additional new facility not located at Awali, but which should be mentioned, is a Preparatory School for non- contract employees which has been in service since 1st Nov ember 1948, at Zellaq. Two classrooms, a storeroom and toilet facilities have been provided by making alterations to a twelve room building constructed to provide living quarters for non- contract employees but no longer required for that purpose.TABULATION TV LIST OF EMPLOYEES BY NATIONALITIES of THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED in SERVICE OF COMPANY AT BAHREIN AS OF DECEMBER ^1. 1948 BAHREIN ACCOUNTING: Americans 2 British 72 Canadians 2 South Africans 1 Other Europeans - Indians 1^1 Pakistanis 5 Iraqis 1 Bahreinis 97 Others 8 BAHREIN PERSONNEL: Americans 2 British 42 Canadians - South Africans - Other Europeans - Indians 106 Pakistanis 13 Iraqis 1 Bahreinis 392 Others 328 884 BAHREIN MAINTENANCE (AWALI &amp; REFINERY) Americans 32 British 20?

Money was again plentiful in the bazaar, although towards the end of 1iie year merchants were inclined to use overdraft facilities father Utofre freely. The influx of Rs .100/- notes reported last year continued and was a nuisance to the banks who could only use a small proportion of them for payment out. There seems little doubt that the Gulf generally is a loophole in the Indian Exchange Control - the very large quantities of Rs »100 notes which Banks are repatriating must have been smuggled out of Indi* - presujiably proceeds of gold mnuggled in.

Traffic accidents amounted to 146 resulting in 3 deaths. A new police post was opened at the old Sitra Pier. The police force was better equipped during the year as stores, especially uniforms^were easier to obtain* 3. Administration . Nothing to report. 4. Pearl Industry . The embargo on the entry of pearls into India was raised during the year. The season however is reported to have been one of the poorest. Fewer boats went to the banks for fishing, 5. Public yforks . The new Officer-in-Charge, P.W.D*, Mr. Stanley Hills took over charge of the department 2 /—v 3 during the year. The 10 shops on Barrett Road were completed and rented. The new Police Station and the Post Office building was also completed. Work was commenced on the new Government Offices building in the Customs Square. Progress was made in constructing a Nursing Sisters House and metalling the Manama-Rafa road. 6. Municipalities . The work of metalling the roads in Manama was continued. A mew public garden on the western side of the town was opened to the public. The Muharraq ITunicipality moved into its own building. Hitherto the municipal offices were housed in a rented building. 7. Agriculture . The Agriculturist in charge of the Budeya Experimental Garden was sent during the year to Iraq to buy seeds and fruit trees for the Government, the Shaikhs and other garden owners. A large number was imported. The prices of vegetables and lucerne continued to be very high. 8. Electricity . Report enclosed. 9. Administration of Justice . Nothing to report. 10. Education . Boys . The schools have been throughout the year filled to capacity, some overcrowding was expe rienced in the lower grades of practically all the schools. The admission of 303 new boys into the schools at the beginning of the present term did not exhaust the long list of those awaiting acceptance. In Muharraq alone, for instance, where a Kindergarten was started in 1947, the number on the waiting list has now reached 250 boys.4/— 3 Improvements in all phases of school work, academic and extra-mural, have been maintained. The standard now compares favourably with, and even higher in some cases than that of similar schools in the Arab States. As the education in Bahrain is still largiy dependent upon the recruiting of teaching staff from the other leading Arab States endeavours were made during the summer vacation to engage trained teachers from Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, a sufficient number were obtained to fill new vacancies in the schools and to replace those teachers who left the service or were recalled by their Governments at the end of the school year. The Egyptian Ministry of Education responsed favourably and was kind enough to sanction the secondment of twenty six teachers for work under the Bahrain Government Education Department. The mission, this time includes a number of senior members, both in age and experience, two have already been once or twice to Exeter and other British Universities for a course of teaching English in Arab schools. The training class for teachers, started during 1947, in the Secondary School, has been doing fairly well. Nine new scholars were recruited at the begin ning of the present term, making a total of eighteen. In addition to special training in the theory and practice of teaching which is given to them in evening classes on certain mornings of the week they take practice lessons in the Manama primary schools, under the supervision of the headmasters.Girls . Owing to the overcrowded state of Muharraq School a new school was opened, during the year for Kindergarten and Infant classes. 195 new students were admitted at the beginning of the school year. Muharraq school is now back to its original number of 300. A drill display by the students from all the schools was held during the year. This is the first time that the Girls’ schools have drilled in public and marks an advance. The usual needlework Exhibition was held in the spring. Text books are still difficult to get which makes the work a little difficult, but a certain amount of Kindergarten material was obtained from London. As well as the new school three new classrooms were built in Rafaa school. The Lady doctor made her annual examination of all students and reported an improvement in the health in all schools. It is now a rule in the Girls’ schools that no girl will be admitted unless she is or has been vaccinated. During the year the schools backed all the appeals made in Bahrain for Funds for Red Crescent and Refugees in Palestine. Technical School . Nothing to report.

BRIEF REPORT FOR THE YHUR During the year under review the operations of the department were directed by Group Gapt. Leigh'until September when Mr. G*B. Thompson took charge until the arrival of Mr. D. srammer, the new stfcfee Engineer, in November. The existing plant -was kept in service and a policy of conserving its life was adopted with the idea of maintaining a restricted electricity supply until the new machinery on order arrived. The peakload carried was the highest on record. Accurate figures however, are not available owing to the lack of efficient metering equipment in the power Station, so that tnese records are computed on a similar basis to previous years. No a 5 . Generating Set. yas installed and put into commission during the year and carried a large proportion of the load particularly during the hot weather, No;4. Generating set. which has been carrying the major portion OT 'the load for SOkie TTme continued to give satisfactory service. No. bu now of 1. &amp; 2. sets, continued to operate on their rather inefficient sis, howeveT instead of removing them as planned last year they will w be overhauled and kept in use until such time as the capacity the Power Station is sufficient to take aare of all the load connectnu Two small sets of 55 KV/ rating were purchased and installed during the year. These were used during peak load periods owing to the delayed arrival of No.6 set and had verv little running. They will be disposed of as soon as sufficient plant is in commission. No.6. Set. has now arrived and the preparation of its concrete bed on the site of NO.3 set is proceeding satisfactorily with the aid of a newly acquired Air Compressor and concrete breaking equipment. ,/ater Distillation plant;- The erection of this new, 10 ton per day 'plarit, is now alMoht completed and it will shortly be put into commission. Transmission and Distribution Mains. Maintenance of the overhead line S haS defiahCLed constant attention and no new worx of major proportions was carried out with the exception of an unaerground LT service to the new water pumping station where 3-15 Hi? electricity driven water pumps were installed by the contractors. Meter Department;- The new meter testing equipment has now arrived ana isUeing installed. No. 6. Generatii^ Set will be in opeaation early in the new year so that some of the 'outstanding load can be connected. The prospects of continuous 24 hour service are good and there is no doubfc that, with the receipt of the new plant now on order, the prospects of a satisfactory revenue return are quite bright. ooifiLderation is being given to a new tariff structure and certain reductions in charges will be made as soon as possible. Telephone Department;- The Total number of subscribers at the end Qf~~t~ire ye'aT ws' ^ery little work has been carried out to the existing system in anticipaition of the completion of the new installation now being carried out by Messrs. Cable &amp; tireless Ltd. Shaikh Hamad Bridge section . The returns of this section were satisfactory.

Well No.6 is standing closed with fish in hole at the depth of 6138 feet. Well No.8 spudded in on the 12th October was at 5335’ on the 31st December and completed on 18th January 1949. Rigging up for well No.9 has been completed and the machinery is on site. Foundations for three more wells have also been completed. About 1800 tons of oil were drawn from the producing wells for the camp needs. According to the latest instructions from our London principals, the target date for the first export of oil has been given as the beginning of 1950, and, in accordance with that, every effort is con centrated on the essential items to the export of oil which nave all priority over the Construction work at tlmm Bab and El Hamleh areas. Construction of Residential &amp; Industrial Buildings The work on rehabilitation in Dukhan Camp was continued during the year and many new buildings, both residential and industrial, were erected. Qatari contractors were used up to the end of the year working under the supervision of the Company technicians. C.A.T. Company (Contractors) have been engaged lately to erect Bellrock Buildings at Dukhan. They arrived in Qatar in the fourth quarter of 1948. Umm Bab area has been selected as the Residential area, and the Industrial area will be sited on the plateau about ^ mile East of the new El Hamleh harbour with living quarters for Monthly Paid Personnel and Daily Paid Personnel, not more than a mile North of the Industrial area. A Pilot Jetty of 400' x 20* wide was under construction at Al Hamleh, and after completing about 10$ the work has been suspended. Messrs. Holloway Bros., were engaged for the construction work at Umm Bab and Umm Said. The welding contract for Qatar tanks and pipeline has been given to Motherwells. They arrived in Qatar in the latter part of 1948. Tank Farm Foundations are expected to be completed by the end of June 1949.

Health On the whole, the general health of all classes of employees in Qatar has been as satisfactory as possible. There has been, however, the customary increase in the respiratory infections such as cold, cough and influenza during the winter months. By comparison, summer is the more healthy time of the year when the incidence of sickness is much lowered even among those working outdoors. The rigorous enforcement of the Company 1 s regulations regarding vaccination and inoculation continues to be an essential precaution, and this has contributed to the fact that there have been no cases of typhoid, smallpox, cholera or plague in the camp. It is feared, however, that an epidemic may break out due to the bedouin camps now springing up in the vicinity of the Dukhan Camp. Representations have been made to the Ruler, and it is hoped that before long the area will be evacuated of bedouins. Z. TRUCIAL COAST Geophysical survey of the area from the Abu Dhabi sabkha west wards to longitude 52° 20* E and southwards from the coast to a distance of 50 kilometers was carried out during the months of January to April by the Robert H.

A less detailed survey of the inland areas of the Abu Dhabi and Dubai sheikhdoms was also carried out until the operations were wound up in April 1948. During the months of April and May the coast at Jebel Ali and the creeks of Dubai and Umm al Quwain were surveyed by Company personnel operating from m/L ,, NASR m with a view to determining the most suitable site for landing cargo brought in by Company vessels.

BRITISH INTERESTS . (i) Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited . The months of January and April were devoted to gravityraeter, magnetometer and topographical survey. The geophysical operations were carried out by personnel of Robert Ray Company, Houston, Texas. The cartographical survey was conducted by two Company surveyors. The party also included one camp Boss and one motor mechanic, both Company employees. The area covered in the survey was from the Abu Dhabi sabkha westwards to longitude 52° 20* E and southwards from the coast to a distance of 50 Kilometers. This survey was a continuation of the work carried out in 1947. 0 Operations were carried out from two camp sites. The first A1 Mirfah, situated about 85 miles westwards along the coast from Abu Dhabi, was vacated at the end of January, when the party moved a further 50 miles westwards to Ruwais, near Jabal Dhannah. At the beginning of March the whole party returned to Sharjah. A small ba f? camp was then established at Bandar Farida, from where a less detailed survey of the inland areas of the Abu Dhabi and Dubai Sheikhdoms was carried out. This area proved extreaely difficult for Motor Transport.-3- Operations by land were wound up in early April and the party left the Trucial Coast on the 16th April. From 27th March to 10th May a marine survey was carried out by Captain A.D.Holden and his assistant Mr.Gose operating from M/L NASH. The areas surveyed were the coast at Jabal Ali, Dubai and Umm al Qaiwain. The purpose of the survey was to determine the most suitable beach for the Company's landing craft M/V JASURA. No further operations were carried out until the arrival of a seismic party on 29th November, 1948. Seismic operations started on 1st December in the Jabal Ali area and southwards. The camp site chosen lies 6 miles south west of Jabal Ali. The Company’s vessel M/V JASURA made its first voyage to the Trucial Coast and arrived at the Port of Umm al Qaiwain on 29th November with a cargo of vehicles and stores. The seismic party personnel also arrived by this vessel. The Umm al Qaiwain creek has proved to be very satisfactory for the use of this vessel.

No success was achieved and Mr.Bird left for the United Kingdom via Bahrain on the 10th June. On the 3rd November Mr.Bird arrived at Sharjah from the United Kingdom via Bahrain and left immediately for Muscat, accompanied by his Assistant Mr.E,F.Henderson, for further discussions with the Sultan.

The Royal Air Force duty aircraft continued to ca^ry the mail once a week between Dubai and Bahrain. ♦ • V-- 9 - ii/LgCAL.&amp;maas-r (u*) ( ^ (1) Dubai - Abu Dhabi Dispute. The economic sanctions imposed on Abu Dhabi continued \jytlll the 29th April when a settlement of the dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi was arrived at. On the 22nd April the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi sent a deputation to Sharjah composed of his brothers Hazza* and Zayid and his maternal uncle Hamid bin Buti, to see the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and discuss the possibilities of a settlement with Dubai over the question of Abu Dhabi allies. Negotiations took place between both sides in the Agency in the presence of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and a settlement was arrived at which was acceptable to both sides. The question of camels which the Ruler of Abu Dhabi claimed to have been on deposit with the Manasir and captured by Dubai during their raid against the Manasir last year was referred to the Ruler of Umm al Qawain for arbitration. At the end of the year this matter had not yet been finally settled. A small party of the Manasir later raided Dubai but were heavily defeated and consequently the Manasir themselves made peace with Dubai and their relations have since been friendly. After peace had been concluded large numbers of the Manasir and their chiefs visited Dubai and received lavish presents in cash and kind from Shaikh Rashid bin Sai'd. It is believed that Shaikh Rashid instigated the Manasir to dissent from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and prevent the Oil Company from working in their area. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi complained to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, against Rashid's harmful activities and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, warned Rashid against deliberate trouble-making. Dubai maae peace with the other tribes who were hostile to them. (ii) The Ras al Khaimah coup d'etat: In early February Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad bin Salim, third nephew of Sultan bin Salim, /the ex-Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, seized the town of Ras al Khaimah with the consent of the inhabitants and with the aid of the Khawatir tribe without bloodshed. Sultan bin Salim was at the time in Dubai where he has a wife and house. Sultan binSalim made no genuine effort to re-capture the town. His chief concern was to get a sufficient allowance from his nephew. Negotiations through the Shaikh of Sharjah produced no result as Sultan bin Salim had, in the meantime, been intriguing against his nephew and instigating the Khawatir and other tribes against him. Having accepted certain conditions and obligations Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad was formally recognized by H.M.G. as Ruler ol Has al Khaimah on the 16th July. A salute of three guns was later accorded to him. Sultan bin Salim who made Dubai his permanent residence intensified his intrigues against the new Shaikh and went to Dhaid several times where he collected round himself a number of robbers from various tribes in order to harass his nephew. Although he was warned by the PoliticalOfficer, Trucial Coast, to refrain from doing so, he did not actually comply but went secretly to Ras al Khaimah and occupied his garden there. He was immediately turned out by his nephew who complained against him to the Political Agent. The Political Agent called Sultan bin Salim and asked him for an explanation for this bad behaviour but he gave him no satisfactions On trying to take him to Bahrain by a sloop to spend some time there in exile, Sultan bin Salim disobeyed the order and escaped and fired on the Political Agent and the Residency Agent with a pistol which he had hidden in his clothes. He was afforded asylum by the Shaikh of Sharjah*s brother with the Shaikh of Sharjah's connivance and arrangements were made for him next morning to leave for the desert. At last he went to Manai* and took shelter there until the end of the year. All the Trucial Coast Shaikhs were asked by the Political Agent to arrest Sultan bin Salim if he entered their territory. Shaikh of Sharjah*s brother was ordered to leave for Bahrain, where he spent three weeks, as a punishment for sheltering Sultan bin Salim in his house, and economic sanctions were imposed on the Shaikh of Sharjah, which continued till the end of the year, for disobeying the orders for the arrest of Sultan bin Salim.11 Sultan bin -’-Salim went to Muscat and requested the Sultan of Muscat to intervene for him with H.M.G. The result of the Sultan^ interventions was still not apparent at the end of the year. (iii) Kalbas In early January the people of Khaur Fakkan, Zubarah and Luliyah, three dependencies under the Sheikhdom of Kalba and the Naqibyeen tribe renounced the authority of the Regent and his nephew Humaid bin Abdullah, turned out thier guards and held the fort, towers and other important positions. They then sent a representation to the Residency Agent saying that they no longer want Shaikh Khalid to be Regent and requested that another capable person be appointed. The Political Agent and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, then visited Khaur Fakkan and Kalba and personally heard the complaints of the people and their grievances. The people later chose Shaikh Humaid bin Muhammad of Ras al Khaima to be the new Regent but in early July, before the matter could finally be decided, the Regent and his nephew, with the help ofthe Shaikh of Fujairah, entered the belligerent port of Khaur Fakkan without opposition and captured the Fort and all other strategic points. One man was killed and three others wounded. The Chief of the Naqibyeen tribe fled to Sharjah but was later allowed to return to his own place. The Regent and his nephew once again established their authority over those ageas which remained quiet till the end of the year. The Agreement covering the Kalba Landing Ground which expired on the 27th August 1948 was allowed to lapse as neither the Royal Air Force nor the British Overseas Airways Corporation required air facilities in Kalba. (iv) Buraimi. In June Sayid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs to the Muscat Government, toured the Buraimi and Dhahirah areas. He met the various tribal chiefs there and conducted a series of discussions with them. His objectwas to bring those chiefs under the Sultan's influence with a view to paving the way for the Oil Company's explorations in those areas. He has, however, achieved no tangible success as the important chiefs authorized Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Nai'm, to represent them and arrange matters for them in consultation with the Sultan. Saqr was, however, very reluctant to go to Muscat and meet the Sultan and thus no result has really been achieved. Many Bureimi Chiefs visited Muscat and obtained handsome largesse from the Sultan. The Wadi el Jizzi road was repaired by the Muscat Bovernment and made passable to motor traffic. (v) Tribal fueds. During the year under report hostilities between the Beni ^itab tribe and the Sharqiyeen tribe and between the Beni QAtab and the Awamir over camel looting started but came to an end. Casualties on both sides were negligible. Hostilities between the Beni ^itab and the Nai'm over camel looting also started in December but was not settled till the end of the year • (vi) Boundaries: The Rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi signified their agreement to H.M.G.'s arbitrating in their boundary dispute. Preliminary action was taken to deal with this matter and both Shaikhs were asked to state the boundaries they claimed and produce any evidence they have in support of their claim, (viii) Slavery: During the year under report, abduction of persons into slavery from Sharjah, Dubai and other parts of the Trucial Coast and the Batinah continued on an increased scale. In spite of strong representations, the responsible Shaikhs took no effective measures to put an end to the practice. In point of fact it was the Shaikhs' relatives who indulged in this trade and encouraged it. A comprehensive report on the subject was submitted by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to the Political Agent in which certain action was recommended('till) Piracy: There has been no complaint against any of the subjects of the Trucial Shaikhdoms of their having engaged in piracy during the year. A number of Trucial Coast dhows were boarded by Iranian patrols in Iranian waters and the Persian and Indian Rupee currency found on board were confiscated. Complaints to the approp^Vte Iranian authorities were lodged but no result was achieved, (ix) Economic: irade has been depressed throught the year. Exports to Persia continued to decrease and many Trucial Coast subjects nave gone to ^atar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait in search of work. During the early part of the year there was distress on the Trucial Coast as the price of dates, which constituted the mam diet of the people, went very high and was soon followed by a scarcity of rice owing to the very strict measures taken by the Iranian authortities, - Iran being the main source of supply to the Trucial Coast - against its export. The situation was, however, considerably relieved when tre price of dates dropped to a reasonable limit and import of dates from Iran and Ir a q continued. During the latter part of the year sufficient quantities of rice arrived from Persia and Aden (the latter being Egyptian rice) and the food situation was satisfactory. The pearl trade was good - better than the previous years. The lifting of the ban by the Government of India on the entry of pearls into India was received with satisfaction. The catch of pearls obtained during the two parts of the diving season was worth about fis. 2000,000/-. (x) Communications: The motor tract between Dubai and Muscat through the Wadi el Qaur was in constant use by taxis ta.k ing passengers and goods to and fro. Most of the trucks used were unserviceable- 14 - surplus military vehicles sold by the Royal Air Force and pat to use again by the local people.

To His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, £ a hr a i n . Sir, •7 I have the honour to forward herewith, In quadruplicate, the Administration Report for Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast for the year 1948. I have the honour to be, v Sir, Your most obedient servant, NNR v FOR POLITICAL AGENT t BAHRAIN.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BAHRAIN AGENCY INCLUDING THE TRUCIAL COAST AND QATAR FOR THE YEAR 1948. 1. AL KHALIFAH . (1) Sis, Hlflhneg g. Sha lkH g l r gal man bin Hsm ad A1 Khallfah. K.C.I.E . There is little remarkable to record about Shaikh Salman during the year. He maintained his attitude of being, on the whole, co-operative with His Majesty's Government and of being aggrieved about Zubara. He, perhaps, grows in pomposity and rigidity.during the years. His health remained good. In June he suffered from a large and painful boil but refused to have it lanced. He turned down offers of trips to the United Kingdom sponsored by His Majesty's Government and to the United States of America, sponsored by 'his” oil company, on the grounds that American feeling was pro-Zionist and that therefore an Islamic ruler should not visit such a country. His real motives are more likely to have been his fears of embarrassment amongst strangers, of travel ling and of leaving the only limited world he actually knows. (11) In August the Shalkha Latlfah bint Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khalid, wife of His Highness, left by steamer for Karachi en route to the Hljaz, She was accompanied by a large retinue who were enabled by the fact that their baggage was exempted from search, to smuggle a number of gold sovereigns into Karachi, The Shalkha returned to Bahrain in November, While on pilgrimage she was presented by King Ibn Saud with 2 Ford Mercury cars. (ill) His Highness' two uncles, Shaikhs Muhammad and Abdullah bin Isa, both travelled abroad during the year, Shaikh Muhammad spending parts of the year in Egypt and the Lebanon, and Shaikh Abdullah going in November to Kuwait fo^hawking trip into the hinterland. (iv) In July, Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed al Khalifah, Superintendent of Police, Bahrain, and a cousin of His Highness, left for the United Kingdom at the in vitation of the British Council, A very full programme was made for his visit and included visits to schools, colleges, docks, municipal councils, courts and various police institutions in both England and Scotland. He returned to Bahrain in September. (v) In December, His Highness received a round robin signed by a large number of the Al-Khalifah Shaikhs asking him for increases in their allowances. He was at first Incensed at this threat to his pocket but the Shaikhs pressed their demand with such obstinacy that he became alarmed and eventually yielded. He has now increased the allowances to the Al Khalifah family by Rs.2,80,000/- per annum, this amount to be paid from his own income. Suggestions are made from time to time that the people of Bahrain are about to turn upon and pull down the oligarchy of the Al Khalifa, many of whom are lazy, ignorant and vicious and yet draw substantial allowances for doing nothing. There are no overt signs that such suggestions are true. 2. EDUCATION- 2 - ■■■■ 2. MJgATIQN. The schools are still crowded and there is a long waiting list of boys for admission. There were a number of yacancies in the teaching staff at the begin ning of the year and attempts were made to obtain more trained teachers from Egypt, Syria, and the Lebanon. They were especially successful in Egypt, the Egyptian Ministry of Education agreeing to the secondment of 26 teachers to the Bahrain Government Education Department. This mission includes a number of senior and experienced teachers* some of whom have received a teacher’s train ing at British Universities. The Bahrain Government have also been recruiting more pupils for their teachers training class which was begun in 1947. Nine pupils were recruited during the year making a total of eighteen. the girls* schools, this being the first time that girls have drilled in public. main fodder crop, were very high throughout the year. More land was put under cultivation at the Government experimental farm at Budelya and the agriculturist in charge was sent to Iraq to buy seeds and fruit trees for the farm,xf®rxsome of the Shaikhs, and other owners of gardens. ing some of the open land on the island and has asked the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an opinion of the possibility of supplying enough water to irrigate an area of 100 acres. The Company replied that there were many areas where new cultivation could be under taken without overtaxing the existing supplies of water provided it was done in accordance with a proper water conservation scheme. that the Government should set up a department to en sure that there is proper conservation of the island’s water supply. The Political Agent, together with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the General Manager of the Company, subsequently took the oppoit unity after the particularly uneconomical drilling of a well by one of the A1 Khalifah to press on the Shaikh the setting up of a proper water conservation committee, containing one or two geological experts from the Company, which would examine all applications for the drilling of new wells. This Committee has been set up and is functioning successfully.

PUBLIC WORKS . .. ^ shops (an investment of His Highness tne Shaikh) in the main street of the Manamah bazaar and a new Post Office and Police Station were completed during the year. Work was commenced on the new offices for the Bahrain Government in the square opposite the Customs House. Progress was also made in constructing new quarters for the Nursing Listers and in metalling the Manamah - Rafa road. The piped water system for Manamah which was begun by Messrs. Holloway Brothers in 1946 was completed towards the end of the year. 7. ELECTRICIT Y DEPARTMENT Group Captain Leigh was succeeded by Mr.D.J. Brammer as State Engineer, Bahrain. Two small 4 se ^ s 300 K.W. sets arrived and were Installed during the year. A new 900 K.W. set is also on order and should arrive late in 1949. The peak load carried was the highest on record and there were several shutdowns because of the strain entailed on the older generators. There are large new demands for electricity which cannot be met until the new equipment arrives and the Bahrain Government have been pressed to order more plant to meet it. The shortage of electricity was one of the causes of delay in installing the new automatic telephone system. 8. TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT . The total number of subscribers at the end of the year was 129. Very little work on the existing magneto system was carried out because it was expected that the new automatic system would be in operation during the course of the year. This had been completed but had not yet come into operation at the end of the year because of objections by subscribers to a number of clauses in the subscriber’s agreement; and parti cularly to that providing that they should pay for each individual call over a specified number allowed free ( 3 per day). The Shaikh had agreed to this provision with Messrs* Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, but the Political Agent had to intervene with him before he would enforce it. Only after this was it possible to get the new system going. 9. TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT . There were 53 Government vehicles at the end of the year. A new foreman has been engaged and further reorganisation of the department will take place in 1949. iO. PEARLING .- 4 - 10. PEARLING . In January a meeting was held at the Adviserate to consider reports that packets of Vene zuelan and Red Sea pearls had been sent to Bahrain pearl merchants for disposal. The meeting urged His Highness to take all measures possible, in conjunction with the Ruler of Saudi Arabia and other Rulers of Gulf States, to forbid the entry of foreign pearls into the Gulf. In April the Government of India lifted the ban it had imposed in 1947 on the import of foreign pearls into India. This was, however, not sufficient to revive the Bahrain pearling industry which is now moribund. The pearling fleet did not leave for the banks until after Ramadhan and the season was in consequence a very short one. There were even fewer boats than last year, only 37 large boats (boats carry ing over 100 divers) taking part, and the total catch was estimated at a value of Rupees four to five lakhs, a further drop on last year’s figure of rupees twenty- five lakhs and on the figure for the year before of rupees forty lakhs. The marketing prospects for Gulf pearls do not seem to be bright though the Export Promotion Department of the Board of Trade have from time to time forwarded irdTonnation regarding them which has been passed to the Bahrain Government. U. OJLSJL-QJLS- Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Rs.60,74,343/-, an increase of Rs.14,33,768/- over last year. The increase was due to a steady increase in the volume of imports, more goods being available for importers particularly from the United Kingdom. The total number of Bahrain boats registered by the Customs Department was 233. 4 new motor launches were built during the year. 12. FOOD CONTROL . During the year the State curtailed its activities in the field of bulk buying of foodstuffs and reduced its expenditure on this account from Rs.113,00,000/- to Rs.71,00,000/-. This reduction resulted from the Ruler’s agreeing to the request of the merchant community to leave the import of rice and sugar to private enterprise. These two commodities were then taken off the ration. Prices remained steady in the early part of the year but rose steeply in the latter half. The State intends to resume control of the import and distribution of rice and sugar in 1949 and has applied for a quota of rice from the Emergency Food Council. The State continued to import throughout the year and to ration the distri bution of wheat of which the supply was arranged by His Majesty’s Government. The ration was maintained at 4 lbs. per adult head a month throughout the year at slightly increased prices during the latter half. This local rise in price was due to an increase in the price of wheat in the supplying areas. 13. SHIPPING13. S H I P P I N_S . (i) Imports and Exports • A total of 263 freighters and 680 tankers called at Bahrain during 1948. There were 234 British, 176 Panamanian and 169 American vessels. Imports of general cargo were 103,880 tons and exports of general cargo 74,864 tons. Exports of petroleum products were 6,367,662 tons and 86,200 drums, and imports of Arabian crude 138,241 tons. (ii) Landing of Cargo . Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited, the Shipping Agents, have almost a monopoly of the landing of cargo here. There were again a number of complaints about their arrangements for landing at Sitrah and Manamah, the delay in the transhipment of cargo from the former to the latter port, and the pilferage of cargo from barges waiting to be unloaded. Several meetings of the merchant community and representatives of the Bahrain Government and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. were held during the year to consider these complaints when the Company representative stated that delay often took place at the swing bridge on the causeway between Manamah and Muharraq or at the Manamah pier where there was only one ancient hand crane to handle cargo. He also stated that his Company had discharged the less reliable of their tally staff and were attracting a better type of applicant by paying them higher wages (they are at present meeting a monthly bill of Rs.20,000/- for tally staff) and asked the Bahrain Government to provide guards on barges waiting to be unloaded. The Bahrain Government have been able to depute a number of police men for this duty and several pilferers have been caught as a result. They have also informed the Company that they have on order a new 10 ton *’Smiths'’ shunting crane which is expected to be shipped from the United Kingdom in June 1949 and which will greatly facilitate the handling of cargo at Manamah pier. Whether the expenses involved in improving the port facilities in Bahrain, particularly in building a deep water quay, would be Justified is a question. What seems certain is that Bahrain will lose some trade, at any rate, when the new ports now under construction in Saudi Arabia and Qatar are opened. 14. POST OFFICE . The administration of the Post Office at Bahrain was transferred on 1st April, 1948, from the Government of Pakistan to His Majesty’s Government and has since been conducted under the supervision of a British Postal Superintendent. New premises in Manaroah have been built expressly as a Post Office by the Bahrain Government• Number of registered articles received n n n « despatched w ' parcels received n n h despatched Amount of Money Orders issued « ' *» commission Total sale of stamps .. 38,601 .. 37,468 .. 9,982 .. 3,248 Rs.2,98,573/4/- Rs. 6,914/15/ Rs.3,88,056/4/* 15. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE15. ADUINISTRATIOH OF JUSTICE. (i) Agency Courts . 1428 Civil Suits, 298 Criminal Cases and 33 estate cases were dealt with by the Agency Courts during the year# There was one case of attempted murder, the accused, a seaman from a freighter which called at Bahrain, being sentenced to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment. In January, S#E#Yona, an Iraqi Jew, was sentenced to one year's Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs#1,000/- for embezzling a sum of Rs#4,000/- from the B0AC.#Rest House in Manamah where he was employed as a reception clerk. In November one Indian and one Persian merchant were each fined Rs.1,000/- for profiteering. (ii) Local Courts . No major crime came before the Bahrain Courts this year, their time being taken up with Civil Suits and prosecutions for intoxication, being in the possession of liquor, and traffic offences. 16.

The local police cadets have now completed their three years of training and have been appointed Assistant Sub Inspectors of Police. They form a useful adjunct to the force and have been successful in apprehending a number of pilferers of ships' cargo awaiting unloading at Manamah pier. There were 367 theft cases as against 414 last year. There were also 8 smuggling cases and one case of suicide. There were.••.5 * - 7 - There were 146 traffic accidents resulting in 3 deaths, as against 130, with 5 deaths, last year# A new police post was opened at the old Sitrah pier to check the operations of smugglers in the Oil Company's harbour area. 17. ECONOMIC . (a) Trade and Business . Trade flourished during the year but slackened somewhat in the late summer and early autumn. Many consumer goods of all types were imported from the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Holland, Australia, and India. The bazaars were well stocked and merchants did a large re-export trade to other ports in the Gulf. There was no sign, however, of any fall in prices while prices for 'luxury* articles like motor cars, bicycles, and radios increased in invoice values from the source of supply as much as 10#• The removal of controls from the prices of many articles resulted in large profits being made by many merchants. The extension of oil company operations in both Bahrain and the Arabian mainland brought a greater volume of business to banks, shipping companies, and local business men. (k) Exchange and Currenc y. The rates of exchange remained substantially unchanged throughout the year. Bahrain is still given a quota for all hard currency countries (except Germany, Japan, and the Belgian Monetary Area) within which quota it is supposed to keep. Money was again plentiful in the bazaar though Indian funds were almost non-existent. The influx of hundred rupees notes reported last year continued during 1948 and caused some inconvenience to local banks who could use only a small proportion of them for outside payments. Barge numbers of Indian and Pakistani notes were repatriated, and many of them must have been smuggled into Bahrain. Local business transactions are still in Indian currency and its retention in preference to Pakistani currency caused some unfavourable comment and most tendentious reporting in a Karachi newspaper. (c) Industry . The Bahrain Petroleum Company continued to produce and export a large volume of petroleum products but the pearling industry is moribund despite the lifting of the ban on the import of pearls into India. There are no other local industries of importance. (d) Tabour . There was a great demand for labour from the Oil Companies, the contractors engaged on the piped water scheme and automatic telephone schemes, and local British enterprises. High wages were paid all classes of labour. In Bahrain a skilled artisan was paid as much as Rs.8/- to Rs.12/- a day and he commanded even higher wages if he went to work on the mainland. Pearling operations..•.operations did not draw off as many labourers as usual as few boats went out and the pearling season was short. Complaints were made to the Bahrain Government about the number of foreigners, Indians, Persians, Pakistanis, Omanis, and Qataris, who were obtaining employment in Bahrain at the expense of local labour. They were also asked to prevent Bahrainis from going abroad to work on the mainland but replied that the ban they had imposed in 1947 on the exodus of Bahrainis from Bahrain had proved very unpopular and had to be lifted soon after it was Imposed. Most Bahrainis prefer to work in Bahrain but the high wages being paid by Araraco and Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. led many abroad. Clerks were paid as much as Rs.300/- and Rs.400/- per mensem by Aramco and those who worked for Arab contractors often received as much as Rs.600/- to Rs.900/- a month. 18. M C .A.L. (a) General . The general health of the communities has been good throughout the year. There have been no major epidemics. The incidence of malaria has been further reduced by the Anti-Malarial measures carried out by the Bahrain Government. A scheme has been implemented by the Bahrain Government to combat the alarmingly high incidence of venereal disease. This provides for free but compulsory treatment of all infected persons In Bahrain. There has been a favourable and rapid response from the public. The Bahrain Medical Society at the end of its third year held a medical congress for Persian Gulf doctors on November 4th. This, the first of its kind, was an experiment to see in what ways different doctors, both British and American, were dealing with the problems of this area. 18 outside doctors attended and the meetings were a great success. It is hoped to make this an annual feature. An increasing number of persons have visited Bahrain from Saudi Arabia, the Trucial Coast, and Iran for medical treatment. 0&gt;) Victoria Memorial Hospital . The Victorial Memorial Hospital functioned under the auspices of the Government of India for the first 3 months of the year under review and during that period its role continued to embrace quarantine duties, the running of a public dispensary and a 12 bedded hospital together with the medical attendance on the staffs of the Residency and Agency, the personnel of ships* crews and the employees of certain local business firms. On the 1st April, the hospital was taken over by His Majesty’s Government and from that date the dispensary and hospital were closed down but the other activities continued. Major J.D.Grant, I.M.S.

Pulmonary T.B. is being treated with greater success by long intensive courses over several months, phrenic avulsion, and artificial pneumo-thorax therapy. Pneumonia showed a 60^ increased incidence and was of unusually toxic nature. Mortality was not high, but delayed resolution with delility very marked. The increpsing number of patients from outside Bahrain is tending to cramp the hospital accommodation. 10# of inpatients were from Saudi Arabia, the Trucial Coast and Iran, particularly from the former. They come chiefly for operations usually for the eyes* Those of Saudi Arabia are always willing to pay high fees to be admitted, but the others are usually destitutes. MEN: OUTPATIENTS .

In view of the heavy traffic at this port, this despensary will provide better facilities for quarantine supervision and the medical attendance on ships' crews. A part time Health Inspector has been appointed to carry out quarantine duties at Muharraq Airport. The work at the marine airport is still being done by the Customs Officer. However, it is now found that practically all air passengers are in possession of valid certificates of vaccination and inoculation. The supervision of crews engaged in dhow \ traffic and passengers carried by such traffic presents the chief quarantine difficulty. Recently the Government of Bahrain has been requested to take action in the matter, but it is considered that the proposed appointment of a Health Inspector to cover this work will best solve the problem. 19. BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED - (a) Staff . Mr. R.M. Brown was the Chief Local Repre sentative throughout the year. From May to October he visited India and the United States when Mr.B. Crow, the Personal Assistant to the General Manager, acted for him. (b) Production . The total oil production during the year was 1,455,321 net tons of crude oil, an average of 3976 net tons a day. This is approximately 200,000 tons more than In 1947. The gas injection of wells was11 wells was again an appreciable cause of the increase especially in the early part of the year when the average daily production rose as high as 4,000 tons. (c) Development . One new well was completed during the year and a new point of withdrawal made in an existing well. Drilling operations on the deep test well begun in 1947 were continued throughout the year and are still in progress. Difficult drilling conditions made the rate of progress slow but valuable information is being accumulated. (d) Imports of Arabian American Crude . Receipts of Arabian American Crude through the (A-B) submarine pipeline totalled 5,738,998 tons during the year and an additional 139,241 tons were received by tanker through Sitrah marine terminal, making a total of 5,878,239 tons received in the Refinery. (®) Exploration Work . Eight structure holes were drilled in the waters surrounding Hawar Island and five in the waters to the north of Bahrain and Muharraq Islands in the general area of Fasht al Jarim. In order to obtain greater information plans were made early in the year to conduct a geophysical survey of the water covered areas of the additional area and arrangements made to obtain the necessary equipment and personnel. Actual operations were begun in December, 1948. (f) Refinery Operations . Operation of the Refinery was at a high level of throughput during 1948 and the total crude run amounted to7,279,559 tons. Product shipments were as follows Aviation Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel Fuel Oil Total 15,302 tons 1,725,698 ' 728,091 ' 1,201,386 ' ■^. 9^308 ' 6.627.785 ' Of the above aviation gasoline 1,502 tons were of Bahrain manufacture and 10,466 tons were imported partly from the United States and partly from Abadan. The above crude running represented approxi mately a 19# increase over 1947 operations, and was made possible by alterations to existing equipment and operation on an exacting shipping schedule.

His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain gave Mr.EDEN a very warm welcome and entertained him to lunch at the Qudhaibiyah Palace. Mr.EDEN also attended a cock tail party at the Political Agency and dined with the Political Resident. He and his party left for Riyadh on the 14th in an ARAMCO aircraft, accompanied by Shaikh MOUSTAPHA HAFIZ WAHBA who arrived early in the morning to meet him. There were many other visitors to Bahrain during the year most of them connected, more or less remotely with oil. 28. PAHRAIN m PALE STINI. In January the Bahrain Government informed the Agency that owing to the anti-Jewish riots of 1947 they did not wish visas for Bahrain to be issued to active Zionists, Jewish refugees, or Jews not in Bahrain on definite business. In April the Bahrain Palestine Air Committee appealed for contributions to the Bahrain Government and local European firms and asked them to bring their appeal to the notice of their employees. On the advice of the Political authorities no action was taken on the appeal and Shaikh Abdullah, the president of the Committee, was advised privately that no official contribution could be expected from any member of an European firm. Feeling against Jews and those supposed to be the active supporters of the Zionist cause often ran high and when the U.S.S. M Rendova M visited Bahrain in May a number of Arab notables refused to attend a tea party on board because 'they could not accept hospitality from the country which had recognised Israel as a Sovereign State”. Local Jews deemed it politic to associate themselves with this statement and to subscribe to Arab Funds in aid of Palestine and there were no further Anti-Jewish incidents, though both the Bahrain Government and the Persian Gulf Squadron of the Royal Navy were fully prepared at the time of the termination by the United Kingdom of the Palestine Mandate in May to prevent any recurrence of last year’s rioting. The news of the invasion of Palestine by the Arab Armies was received with jubilation but enthusiasm waned with the slow progress and the repulses suffered by these armies, and the ensuing military and political stalemate, and finally lapsed into an attitude of callous indifference towards the fate of the Palestinean Arab Refugees. Some efforts were made at the end of the yearby a committee of local merchants to collect money and wearing apparel for the Palestinean refugees who had been settled near Basrah* Local Cinemas are still collecting a 'Palestine' charge of one anna from the buyer of every ticket. His Highness contributed Rs.10,000/- in March towards the Palestine AIM Fund. 29. BAHRAIN AND PERSIA . (i) Some stir was created in the beginning of the year by the publicity given by the Haifa and Tehran broadcasting stations to the arrival in Tehran and the subsequent activities of Abdullah Az Zairah, a young Bahraini adventurer, who claimed to have been entrusted with a message from the 'Bahrain National Party' to the effect that the people of Bahrain were anxious to be reunited to Persia. His Highness promptly denied Abdullah Az Zairah 9 s claim to represent the people of Bahrain and asked that Haifa and the British Broadcasting Corporation should issue counter statements that Bahrain was and still/an independent Arab State in treaty relation with His Majesty's Government. In this His Highness was supported by the 'Union of Youth' of Bahrain who sent a telegram to Reuters expressing their resentment at Abdullah Az Zairah's impertinence. The latter was subsequently credited with writing a series of articles for the Tehran Newspaper 'Iran-i-Ma' and, still later, with the making of preparations to visit America/! and present the Persian claim to Bahrain to the United Nations Assembly. When last heard of, however, he was eking out a living in a minor post in the Saudi Embassy at Tehran and had been dropped by Abbas Iskandari and other Persian deputees concerned in pressing the Persian claim to Bahrain. (ii) The Tehran Radio continued to carry references to Persia's claim to Bahrain which often disturbed His Highness and led him to ask why no denials and counter statements were issued by the B.B.C., and in September he was further agitated by an Arab broadcast from Paris that the Shah had taken advantage of his visit to the United Kingdom to arrange with His Majesty's Government for the Bahrain Islands to be handed over to Iran. At the end of the year these various rumours had /i so worked upon the Shaikh that he asked that he be given an assurance by His Majesty's Government that it would protect Bahrain against external aggression. (iii) In March the Persian Government instructed the Bushlre Post Office not to receive or re-transmit any telegram of Bahrain origin. Of more concern was a scarcity of meat in February caused by the restrictions imposed by the Persian Government on the export of livestock and other commodities. With the payment by exporters of larger bribes to Persian Officials, the restrictions were set aside and the supply of livestock to Bahrain was resumed. 30. ITE^S OF INTEREST . (i) Visit of local merchants to British Industries fai r. In April three local merchants, Messrs. KhalM Aujan, the British and American Tobacco Company Agent)31. IMXHE&amp;j: 1 9 / 4e) / UfV Abdur Rahman Mohammed Taiiir, and Mohammed all bin Mohammed Tahir al Sharif, left for the United King dom to visit the British Industries Fair. They also visited France, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, and Egypt. Messrs. Khalid Aujan and Abdur Rahman Mohammed Tahir returned to Bahrain in August. Mohammed Ali Al Sharif had not returned at the end of fe)ie year. (ii) Bahrain Cinemas . In July the n Pearl Cinema” a modern luxry cinema, owned by one of the Gosaibi Brothers, Saudi merchants long established in Bahrain, was opened to the public. The cinema seats over 700 persons and boasts of an air-conditioning unit which, owing to the electricity shortage, could not be used in 1948. Manamah town has now three local cinema houses and one nearing completion and Muharraq one local cinema house. (Ill) 'Water Garden'. In August, the opening of a new 'Water Garden” outside Manamah town was celebrated with an aquacade arranged by Mr.Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, for which nearly every department of the Bahrain Government was pressed into service. The garden has been constructed by the reclamation and filling in of some marshy land to make two artificial lakes and the cost is said to have exceeded Rs.10,000/-. It Is now never used. (iv) Liquor . There is a large amount of liquor both imported and locally manufactured to be bought on the black market and Bahrainis of all classes are fond of Alcohol. His Highness, however, has not yet been able to oven--«ome his own and otheife rooted objection to the overt drinking of liquor by Bahrainis and his Muslim subjects still labour under total prohibition. In September one of the shops imported and was allowed to sell a consignment of apple cider to the public but it brought forth such a fulmination from the Qadhi of the Friday mosque that His Highness made haste to issue an 'Ahlan' forbidding its further sale. (v) Rents . Despite much new building, rents are still very high and the finding of good accommodation at not too exhobitant a rent is difficult. His Highness, who Is a large owner of house property, would like to deal with this situation by raising rents still higher, which he ingeniously suggests, would encourage more new building of residential quarters. In November a committee appointed by the Political Agent and presided over by the Assistant Political Agent met at the Agency to consider a 4# to 6# increase on the value of the property In the existing rent rate. They found, however, that this would make, . in fact, for increased inflation and a resultant demand for increased wages, and concluded that an increase in the rent rate was only possible if houses were to be reassessed excluding the value of the site.20 - © 31.

(D B-l3 Excellency Shaikh Abdullah Mn Qaslm A1 Thanl, C.I.E . This old man (reputed to be 84 years of age) remained surprisingly well during the year. His grip on the affairs of his barbarous Sheikdom remains unimpaired, and unyielding though, when relaxed, he lapses into a child like senility. The death of his otherwise unloved and unlovable son, Hamad, affected him deeply. to a fund for helping Arab Refugees from Palestine. His son Shaikh Hamad contributed Rs.30,000/-. apparent of the Ruler, died in the hospital at Dukhan of Messrs. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited. Shaikh Hamad who was a chronic diabetic, obese, and in poor general health, was taken ill early in May with a fever and diarrhoea. After treatment by an Indian doctor he was removed by Dr.Anderson, the Company^ Chief Medical Officer, to Dukhan where he aemed to be progressing favourably but had a relapse towards the end of the month and died on the 27th May. His death was diagonised as due to hearc failure and toxaemia following an attach of dysentery. question of choosing a successor. Shaikh Ali, his eldest son, has always been regarded as a person of weak intellect and has hitherto lived the life of a complete nonentity. Only a fortnight after Shaikh Hamad*s death, however, his eldest son Shaikh Abdul Aziz died at Karachi while on a visit there. Shaikh Abdullah was thus left to choose between Shaikh Ali and the second son of Shaikh Hamad, Shaikh Khalifah, a youth of 18 and a minor. The decision exercised his *ind for some months but in November he announced that Ali was to be his successor and Khalifah to be second in the line of succession. This decision was announced before a meeting of Qatar notables whom he got to sign a document that they approved of Shaikh Abdullah*s decision and recognised the succession as announced by him. (Ill) Progress and Development . for a time by a scarcity of technicians and proper equipment but in the year 1948 they made appreciable progress. A brief account of their activities is at paragraph 20 of this report. Being largely a British Company, Petroleum Con cessions Limited have only a limited dupply of dollars and are so compelled to concentrate their efforts and resources on essentials. While therefore their drilling programme end pipe line construction are up-to-date, they put up In May the Shaikh contributed Rs.1,00,000/ (11) The Qatar Succession . In May Shaikh Hamad, the second son and heir- Shaikh Abdullah was faced with the difficult Afther the war the oil company was handicapped21- compared with American companies, a very poor show in the way of providing living accommodation for their employees (especially for those who are married) and amenities. This comes in for criticism and results in a large turnover of discontented staff. The Company^ impact upon the State has been what one expects and as seen in other places, but accentuated in Qatar because it is so primitive. The Shaikh and what corresponds to 'Governmental circles' look to the oil company as the universal provider; his subjects, and many immigrants, rely upon it for a living and, whether originally Bedouin, fisherman pearler or porter beeome very soon oil company hands dressed in oily khaki European clothes, and carrying their lunch in cans to work, while they interlard their speech with what are or what they imagine to be English expressions. (iv) Slavery . One of the benefits that is likely to result from the further opening up of Qatar to foreign enterprise is the gradual suspension and the eventual abolition of the activities of slave traders in that territory. Qatar provided a ready market during the year under review for slaves kidnapped or sold on the Trucial Coast. Several letters of protest were addressed to the Ruler and in three instances the Political Agent was successful in effecting the restora tion of slaves who had been taken to Qatar by their captors. 33. mi CI AL C OAST.

During the year under review, Mr.E.Innes Pocock of Messrs.Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company Limited visited Abu Dhabi ©nd, after obtaining Shaikh Shakhbut*s permission, proceeded to Sir Beni Yas and Dalmah Islands for the purpose of prospecting for red oxide there. He took specimens for examination but the result is not yet known. Mr.Pocock left for the United Kingdom on the 23rd June. In early Kovember he telegraphed to Khan Sahib Husain Araad instructing him to recruit labour and recommence mining red oxide on Abu Musa and Sir Bu Nai»r Islands. Work is in progress in both places.

On the 11th February Mr.H.C.Breach,24 Superintendent, British Post Offices, Persian Gulf, arrived at Sharjah in connection with the taking over of postal services in Dubai from the Pakistan Govern ment • HfitJn effect from the 1st April, H.M.G. took over the administration of the postal services in Dubai from the Pakistan Government and British stamps of various denominations over-printed with Indian currency value were introduced. The Royal Air Force duty aircraft continued to carry the mail once a week between Dubai and Bahrain. (1) Du bai - Abu Dhabj. Disput e. The economic sanctions imposed on Abu Dhabi continued till tho 29th April when a settlement of the dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi was arrived at. On the 22nd April the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi sent a deputation to Sharjah composed of his brother liazza* and Zayid and his maternal uncle Hamid bin Buti, to see the Political Officer, TrucJLal Coast, and discuss the possibilities of a settlement v/ith Dubai over the question of Abu Dhabi allies. Negotiations took place between both sides in the Agency in the presence of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and a settlementwas arrived at which was acceptable to both sides. The question of camels which the Ruler of Abu Dhabi claimed to have been on deposit with the Maria sir and captured by Dubai during their raid against the Manasir last year was referred to the Ruler of Umra al Qawain for arbitration. At the end of the year this matter had not yet been finally settled. A small party of the wanasir later raided Dubai but were heavily defeated and consequently the Manasir themselves made peace with Dubai and their relations have since been friendly. After peace had been con cluded large numbers of the Manasir and their chief visited Dubai end received lavish presents in cash and kind from Shaikh Rashid bin Bal'd. It is believed that Shaikh Rashid instigated the Kanasir to dissent from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and prevent the Oil Company from working in their area. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi complained to the Political Officer, Truciai Coast, against Rashid*s harmful activities and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast warned Rashid against deliberate trouble-making. Dubai made peace with the other tribes who were hostile to them. (ii) The Ras al Khairaah cou p d* etat : In early February Shaikh Srqr bin Muhammad bin Salim, third nephew of Sultan bin Salim, the ex-Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, seized the town of Ras al Khaimsh with the consent of the inhabitants and with the aid of the Khawatir tribe without bloodshed. Sultan bin Salim was at the time in Dubai where he has e wife and bouse. Sultan bin Salim made no genuine effort to re-capture the town. His chief concern wis to get a sufficient allowance from his nephew. Negotiations through the Shaikh of Sharjah produced no result as Sultan bin Salim had, in the meantime, been intriguing against his nephew and instigating the- 25 - Khawatir and other tribes against hi^. Having accepted certain conditions and obligations Shaikh Saqr bin Mulia’-nmad was formally recognised by as Ruler of Ras al Khalmah on the 16th July. A salute of three guns was later accorded to him. Sultan bin Salim who made Dubai his permanent residence, intensified his intrigues against the new shaikh and went to Dhaid several times where he collec— t'-'i round in self a number of robbers from various tribes in order to harass his nephew. Although he was warned by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to refrain from doing sc, he did not actually comply but went secretly to Ras al Ehaimah and occupied his g^den there. He wcs immedi-taly turned out by his nephew who complained against him to the Political Agent. The D olitical Agent called Sultan bin Salim and asked him for an explanation for this bad behaviour but he gave him no satisfaction. On trying to take him to Bahrain by a sloop to spend some time there in exile, Sultan bin.Salim disobeyed the order and escaped and fired on the Political Agent and the Residency Agent with a pistol which he had hidden in his clothes. He was afforded asylum by the Shaikh of Sharjah 1 s brother with the Shaikh of Sharj ah * s connivance and arrange ments were made for hfm next morning to leave for the desert. At last he went to Manai* and took shelter there until the end of the year. All the Trucial Coast Shaikhs were asked by the Political Agent to arrest Sultan bin Salim if he entered their territory./ Shaikh of Sharjah's brother was ordered to leave for Jahrain, where he spent three weeks, as a punishment for sheltering Sultan bin Salim in his house, and economic sanctions were imposed on the Shaikh of Sharjah, which continued till the end of the year, for disobeying the orders for thearrest of Sultan bin Salim. Sultan bin Salim went to Muscat and requested the Sultan of Muscat tc intervene for him with H.M.G. Tho result of the Sultan^ interventions was still not apparent at the end of the year. (iii) Kalla : In early Jarm?ry the people of fthaur Fakkan, Zubarah and Luliyah, three dependencies under the Sheikhdom of Kalba and the N&amp;qlbyeen tribe renounced the authority of the Regent and his nephew Fumaid bin Abdullah, turned out their guards and held the fort, towers and other important positions. They then sent a representation to the Residency Agent saying that they no longer wantsdShaikh Khalid to be Regent and requested that another capable person be appointed. The Political Agent and the PoiitictJ. Officer, Trucial Coast, then visited Khaur Fakkan and Kalba and personally heard the complaints of the people and their grievances. The people later chose Shaikh Hurraid bin Muhammad of Ral al Khaima to be the new Regent but in early July, before the matter could finally be decided, the Regent and his nephew, with the^help of the Shaikh of Fujairah, entered the belligerent port of Khaur Fakkan without opposition and captured the Fort and all other strategic points. One man was killed and three others wounded. The Chief of the Naqibyeen tribe fled to Sharjah but was later allowed to return to his own place. The Regent and his nephew once again established their authority over those areas which remained quiet till the end of the year.26 The Agreement covering the Kalba Landing Ground which expired on the 27th August 1948 v7as allowed to lapse ns neither the Foyal Air Force nor tne British Oversees Airwnys Corporation required air facilities in Kalba. (1v) Bural ni, In June Sayid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs to the jtfuscat Government, toured the Buraimi ana Dhahlrah areas. He met the various tribal chiefs there and conducted a series of discussions with them. His object was to bring those chiefsunder the Sultan's influence with a view to paving the way for the Oil Company's explorations in those areas. He has, however, achieved no tangible success as the important chiefs authorised Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Ns I'm, to represent t-hem erd arrange matters for them in consultation with the Sultan. Saqr was, however, very reluctant to go to Muscat and meet the Sultan and thus no result has really been achieved. Many Buraimi Chiefs visited Muscat and obtained handsome largesse from the Sultan. The Wadi el Jlzsl road was repaired by the Muscat Government and made passable to motor traffic. (v) Tribal During the j^ear under report hostilities between the Jbeni Qitsb tribe and the Sharqjyeen tribe and between the Henl Qitab arid the Awamir over camel looting started but came to an end. C&amp;sualltles on both sides were negligible. Hostilities between the Beni Qitab and the NniVm ever camel looting also started in December butwere not settled till the end of the year. (^1) B ound a rles t The Rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi signified tbeir agreement to H.M.G's arbitrating in their boundary dispute. Preliminary action was taken to deal with this matter and both Shaikhs were asked to strite the boundaries they claimed and produce any evidence they have in support of their claim. (vii) Slavery &gt; During the year under report, abduction of persons into slavery from Sharjah, Dubai end other parts of the Trucial Coast and the Batinnh continued on an increased scale. Inspite of strong representations, the responsible Shaikhs took no effective measures to put an end to the practice. In point of fact it was the Shaikhs* relatives who indulged in this trade and encouraged it. A comprehensive report on the subject was submitted by the Political Officer, Crucial Coast, to the Political Agent, in which certain action was recommended. (viii) Pi racy .
