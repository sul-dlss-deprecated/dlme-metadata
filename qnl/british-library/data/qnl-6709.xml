B. 155 ! This Document is the property of the Secretary India. I Relations of the British Government with the Tribes of the Aden Hinterland. The attached Memorandum,* compiled by the Foreign Office in con sultation with this Office, gives a brief account of our treaty relations with the Aden tribes, and of the delimitation. It will be seen that a line has been laid down from a point on the sea opposite Perim to the River Bana, * B. 156. 180 miles in length,! fixing a definite | Amiri border, 42 miles. frontier between Turkish territory and Haushabi border, 36 miles. ■ i i • j a • • Subaihi border, (about) 100 miles. the Subaihi, Haushabi, and Amin tribes. Beyond the River Bana it has been recognised in the Proc&amp;s Verbal, signed by the British and Turl^sh Commissioners on the 20th April 19')5, that, in accordance with the Sultan’s Irade of the 12th February 1903, the line (demarcation of which is not at present contemplated) runs north-east to the Desert. The Proces Verbal states that the whole of the Aulaki, and all the districts of the Yaffai (including Rubeaten, Nawa, and Dhabiani) Iving to the south and east of the line to the Desert, belong to the Nine Tribes. It is silent as to Behan, with which we have a treaty, and winch we regard as Aulaki, and as to Beda, with which the Aden authorities were authorised on the 18th June 1903 to conclude a treaty which has not yet been executed. Beda is apparently neither Aulaki nor Tarfai, but lies south of the line north-east to the Desert. In the past the practical difficulties with the Turks which led to the delimitation occurred on the Subaihi, Haushabi, and Amiri borders, a\ hich have been actually defined. Beyond the River Bana our dealings with the tribes have been so slight that, in the treaties made in 1903 and 1904 (under the stress of the complications which arose during the work of demarcation) with representatives of the Tpper Vaflfai, the L pper Aulaki and Behan, we were dealing with what may be described as an unknown quantity. In this connection it may be added that the control of the delimitation proceedings passed to a great extent into the hands of Sir N. O’Conor, after the appointment to the Commission in November 1902, in accordance with his wishes, of Mr. Fitzmaurice, a Dragoman of the Embassy, in uhom he had special confidence. As regards the increase of British responsibility resulting from the demarcation, it was stated by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords, on the 30th March 1903, in reply to a question whether the delimitation extended the British sphere of influence “ With regard to the respon- «« gibilitv for these territories, I do not see why what has taken place should « ma ke any difference in those responsibilities. We have never desired to ' interfere'with the internal and domestic affairs of the tribes. On the “ other hand, we have throughout made it perfectly plain that we should “ not tolerate the interference of any other Power with them.2 As far as Turkish interference goes, it remains for experience to show whether the definition of the boundary will have diminished the constant difficulties which led in 1901 to the decision to join the Turks in delimi tation. The need for delimitation had been pointed out as far back as 1886 in the Government of India’s letter of the 6th August, discussing the question of treaties with the tribes. But though there seems no reason-why, apart from the treatment of border difficulties with the Turks, the delimitation should affect our policy towards the Subaihi and the Haushabi, our relations with the Amir of Dthala have undoubtedly been affected by the arrangements which it was necessary to make with him, after he had been placed in possession of Jalela and other portions of territory from which the Turks had to retire in accordance with the demarcation. The Treaty of 1905, the terms of which were approved by our Despatch of 23rd September 1904, promises protection to the “ territory of Dthala and all its dependencies,” and gives the Amir and his successors a subsidy of 100 dollars a month in return for undertakings on his part not to deal with foreigners or part with any territory; to keep open and protect roads; to maintain the frontier line; to preserve order in Amiri territory, and to restrain his dependents from creating disturbances in the country beyond the border or interfering with Turkish subjects. The treaty also provides that the Amir shall maintain a force, not exceeding 50 men, to the satisfaction of the Resident, in return for which the Amir is to receive a further subsidy of 100 dollars a month. In addition to the above, a Political Officer has been permanently stationed at Dthala with an escort of some 20 men. There is also stationed at present in Amiri territory * The total number in January 1906. a *° rCe men, and in view of In November and December 1905, the the healthy climate of the uplands, a figures were 945 and 885 respectively. , .i , • , i , . hospital is contemplated. It is not improbable that in time there will be a demand, in the interests of the health of the Aden garrison, for a hill station near Dthala, and also for a railway, especially if the Lahej Sultan brings to a successful issue his project for a line through Abdali territory to Nobat Dakim. Another source of difficulty in Amiri territory is that of the relation of the Amir of Dthala to the Kotaibi and other minor Sheikhs. The policy indicated in Government of India Despatch of the 31st August 1905 is that it is premature at the present stage to contemplate the grant of fixed stipends to any particular sub-tribe, though the Political Officer should be given a liberal discretionary power of making occasional or periodical presents, which would differ only from temporary stipends in that there would he no treaty engagement to pay them. The Government of India also held that no binding engagements should he made with any sub-tribe till it was clear that the Amir is unable, with the support of the Political Officer, to consolidate bis position as paramount ruler; and they recom mended that the appointment of a Political Officer at Dthala, which had been sanctioned experimentally for one year, should be made permanent This was approved by Despatch of the 10th November 1905, No. 35 (Secret) as were the views expressed as to stipends for the sub-tribes. In other respects it is not. clear why the result of the demarcation should be to alter our policy towards the tribes. The necessity for not extending our responsibilities was impressed on the Government of India in DespatchedOf the 1st April and 15th July 1904 (copies attached). In the first of these l ti WaS P° lnte d out that the “ fundamental principle upon which British „ ll n™ hafl been maintained with th e tribes around Aden, described by &lt;t ; he Governm e nt of Bombay as ‘ the principle of tribal responsibility “ ‘coupled with a minimum of British interference,’ had been vindicated by “ its success ”; and that though in consequence of the delimitation “ it may ‘‘ be necessary to impose upon the Amir of Dthala and other tribal chiefs, ‘‘ by fresh agreements, international responsibilities which they have hitherto “ evaded /’ the Secretary of State would “ view with misgiving any tendency to extend the range of our interference with the tribes themselves or to weaken the defence of Aden itself by exciting opposition in the interior and taking part in tribal disputes which do not affect external relations. Jhe inciease of tne military force at Aden is a contingency which, in “ view of Imperial obligations elsewhere, it is desirable to avoid.’’ It was fuithei laid down that “no action should be taken in the direction of establishing Agents in the interior, the introduction of the levy system, or “ the lease of land for sanatorium or railways without .... the full sanc- “ tion of His Majesty’s Government.” The Despatch of the 15th duly 1904 laised the question of the obligation imposed on the British Government by the promise of “gracious favour and protection” in connection with the recently ratified treaties with the Upper Aulaki Sultans. After reverting to the Despatch cited above, of the 1st April, the Secretary of State said— “ 2. In that Despatch, whilst I recognised the obligation incurred by “ your Government in regard to the external relations of the tribes “ recently brought under the protection of the Aden authorities, I “ expressed my misgiving as to the extension of British interference “ with the tribes themselves in their internal affairs or their relations “ with each other. I shall be glad to receive at an early date the “ report of the Government of Bombay and the views of your “ Excellency in Council on this important subject, with a view to “ removing at the outset any misunderstanding as to the extent “ of your liabilities to the tribes. It may be possible by the “ superior influence of the Sultan of Lahej, or by a clear under- “ standing with each separate tribe, to induce the tribes to come “ to a common arrangement amongst themselves. There are certain “ duties common to all of them, such as the protection of the trade “ routes, which the British Government must be prepared to “ enforce. There are others, as, for instance, those connected with “ religious and inter-tribal disputes, which it may be possible to “ leave to the settlement of the tribal Chiefs. I merely desire at “ this stage to indicate the need for a clear understanding as to the “ intentions and limitations of these protectorate agreements. It is “ unnecessary to alarm the tribes by public action or by general “ inquiry. As the Chiefs themselves visit Aden to draw their “ allowances, their views and opinions may be invited, and any “ explanations as to our intentions which it may be advisable to “ make can then be quietly given to them. But before the meaning “ of your obligations and the phrases of the treaties can be “ explained to the parties, it is desirable for your Government to “ review the whole subject carefully, and inform me as to your own S. 8. A 2“ views of the extent of your obligations and your means of “ executing them.” The views of the Government of Bombay were forwarded by the Government of India in a letter of the 9th February 1905 (copy attached). The Government of Bombay did not think it practicable either to work through any one Chief, such as the Sultan of Lahej, or to attempt to establish an inter-tribal arrangement. They were in favour, therefore, of adhering to the policy of treating each tribe as an independent factor to be dealt with direct, interference in internal or inter-tribal affairs being limited to occasions on which “ these have a bearing on their relations with “ ourselves or affect the safety of the trade routes. . . . The position of “ Government is substantially altered to this extent only that they are now “ compelled to control the actions of the tribes on the external frontier of “ the protectorate.” The Bombay Government, however, made the practical suggestion that, in view of the poverty of the tribes, generous treatment of the question of stipends “ may prove in the long run to be “ sound economy as well as good policy, and to be possibly the best means “ of enforcing inter-tribal peace.” The Government of India agreed generally in this recommendation as to the stipends, but thought that any increase should be accompanied by additional and definite obligations as in the case of the levies to be maintained by the Amir of Dthala. They preferred, however, to reserve their opinion till they saw how that experi ment worked. On the larger question of our relations with the tribes, they gave an assurance that they had no intention or desire to extend their obligations, or to depart from the fundamental principles which have regulated our connection with the tribes in the past. They recognised, however, that “ recent events have tended to develop this connection and have unavoidably widened the sphere of our responsibilities.^ But they hoped, on the other hand, that as in other parts of the Indian frontier, so at Dthala, the personal influence of the Political Officer stationed there would have a good effect on our relations with the tribes in touch with him. At present practically all our treaties with the tribes are protectorate, and, with the exception of the Amiri treaty, are limited to binding the tribes not to deal with foreigners, not to part wdth territory, and to protect the trade routes. A complete list of the treaties (30 in all) with a summary of their provisions, was forwarded with the Government of India’s letter of 9th February 1905. As regards the protectorate clause in the treaties it will be seen, from the Foreign Office Memorandum, that proposals had been made in 1885 for treaties not of a protectorate character with the tribes other than the four nearest to Aden, which were to be under our protection ; but that in 1887 it was decided to make all the treaties protective, in view of the opinion expressed by Lord Salisbury (Foreign Office letter of 19th November 1887) that “the responsibility incurred by the British Government in either case “ is much the same, while a treaty of Protectorate gives a more “ complete control, and is more efficient to counteract interference “ by Foreign Powers than the less definite Agreements previously “ suggested.” It will also be seen from the Foreign Office Memorandum that as regards the Amiri the policy suggested in 1885 w r as that “we should quietly desist from our attitude of opposition to the Turks,allowing the absorption by them of the uplands and possibly pensioning off the Amir and bis immediate successors.” In pursuance of this policy no treaty promising protection had been made with the Amir at the time of the delimitation, though we had a treaty giving a him a stipend in return for good behaviour and the maintenance of trade routes. Nevertheless, neither at the time of the delimitation nor during the period of friction preceding it, was any proposal made, so far as official records show, to ignore the virtual claims of the tribe to our protection, and to leave them to be absorbed by the Turks.
