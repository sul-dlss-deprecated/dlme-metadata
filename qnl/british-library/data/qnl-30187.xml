To us it seems, and War Office agree, that as military threat to Persia| : has receded it is hardly necessary to send away more women and children or xiXis Jews, .apart from the difficulty of finding a destination for these, it is for consideration whether we should not do better to use any available shipping space for the removal of Poles.

This problem is governed mainly by physical difficulty of finding a place where these enemy nationals can be interned. East Africa is already saturated with internees and refugees and Colonial Office are satisfied that in present circumstances reception of this additional number would be impossible, A j|possible alternative which we propose to explore is Union of 11 South Africa. If Union Government are unable to take internees, only solution appears to be to arrange for their temporary internment in area of Iraq - Persia command and to hope that Government of India will be able to take them in a few months' time, 2. I am prepared to leave to your discretion which enemy nationals should be interned and which repatriated. In view of the known difficulties, we clearly do hot want to intern more than is absolutely necessary.

Prom Tehran telegram No.303 it appears that the number of internees (as opposed to repatriates) might be in the region of 500 . I doubt whether the Government of India* s suggestion for the repatriation of all of them except Germans (presumably including Austrians) and Jews will be accepted; it would scarcely be desirable to send home the Italians, I have discussed this telegram with Mr, Pink of the Foreign Office. He tells me that the Colonial Office do not like the idea of asking any of the East African Governments to receive these people. You will no doubt know much better than we do to what extent the somewhat unco-operative attitude, which some of these Governments maintained until fairly recently, has been modified as the result of pressure from above; how many internees, refugees etc. have been sent to these territories, and whether they have now (as they claim) reached saturation point, having regard to their small white population. I have promised to let Mr. Pink have the views of the India Office on Monday next, September 14th. For this purpose I should be grateful for your views. Do you consider that (a) the 0.0. and/or the D.O. should be urged to ask the Governments concerned to receive these internees in East or South Africa; or (b) the Government of India can fairly be pressed to take them; or (c) the Foreign Office should be asked to accept the compromise/compromise solution suggested in the last sentence of the Government of India* s telegram.

Unless you have reason to suspect onen of contacts or sympathies with enemy you should^arrange for competent authorities to ascertain whether any ox these could render useful service to the Allied cause, c.g. as merchant seamen. 2. For your own information position Regarding persons of Baltic origin is that if they were not in Baltic States at time when Soviet government passed laws making inhabitants of those States Soviet citizens they do not automatically acquire Soviet citizenship hut only upon application through Soviet representatives abroad. Those who have not so applied in this country continue to obtain passports, documents etc. from Baltic representatives here and are treated on same footing as other aliens not of enemy origin.

General Officer Commanding of 10th Army is unable to arrange for internment in Persia or Iraq and has suggested India as ultimate destination for the men of military age. Detention by Persian authorities would be quite useless. I agree with General Officer Commanding and strongly recommend that all enemy nationals of military age, together with their dependents if they desire to accompany the men, and any dangerous suspects should be sent to India or some other destination putsiae the Middle East. Apart from special exceptions which it may be necessary to maKe all others should be repatriated. Following are approximate numbers of enemy nationals ’ involved: Bulgarians, 170 men and 55 women &lt; and children: &gt; Italians, 123 men and 80 women and children: Hungarians, 177 adults, number of children unknown: Germans and Austrians, 104 adults, number of children unknown: Roumanians, Esthonians and Lithuanians very few. —*- Once principle is accepted I shall endeavpur to secure more precise details m categories.
