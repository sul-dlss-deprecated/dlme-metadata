I do not imagine that any breach of maritime peace will occur, but I think that murder of a irucial Chief deserves to be taken notice of by us. There is no ship-of-war here, biit I propose to send Lawrence with Gaskin to make inquiries. This will in any case have a good effect. Do you approve ? Telegram, dated the 5th August 1900.
