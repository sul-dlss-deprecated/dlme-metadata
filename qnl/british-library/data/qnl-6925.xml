The question of the illicit traffic in arms, both within and without the Persian Gulf, is one which has continuously engaged the attention of Govern ment for some years past. The subject of the and the issues relating thereto are familiar. The trade outside the Gulf has come into special prominence, since the outbreak of the troubles in Somaliland, in connection with the supply of arms to the Mullah. The correspondence on the subject, even that portion of it which has passed through this Department, is voluminous. It may be convenient, therefore, to summarise the main conclusions which appear to be established by the papers in our possession, e.g., as to the ports of supply, the ports of entry, the various proposals which have been made for suppressing the traffic, and, as regards those which have been adopted, what measure of success has been achieved or what reasons assigned for failure. It may be premised that it seems possible to deal only with the organised or “ systematic ” traffic. There exists also a “ spasmodic ” traffic which is engaged in, as an extra venture, by masters of dhows carrying other merchandise, and which it is considered impracticable to suppress, having regard to the unceasing demand for arms of precision,— often, in times of disturbance, at prices admitting of a handsome profit,—and having regard also to the large number of arms already in the hands of the natives of the territories affected. It is of course difficult fo draw the line of distinction very clearly between die two kinds of traffic, and it will be observed that some authorities have at times displayed a tendency to absolve themselves from the responsibility of dealing with the evil, by representing that the traffic within their juris diction is of the “ spasmodic ”—and irrepressible— kind. Jibuti is the distributing centre for the trade outside the Persian Gulf. The complaint is of old standing, and is barely disputed even by the India Letter No. 112 (Secret), dated 30th trade within the Gulf has been dealt with in July 1903.

It may, however, be worth while to bring together into a brief resume some facts concerning the trade at Jibuti and its ramifi cations, and some opinions expressed on the subject by various authorities since the Brussels Convention was signed (1890). In 1891 the Government of India brought to No. 169 (Secret), dated 7th October 1891. notice the largo importation of arms from Jibuti into the (Abyssinian) territories adjacent to the French and English Somali Protectorates; they suggested that the French Government should be urged to place some restriction on such consign ments. It was not, however, practicable to address Secret Despatch to India, No. 41, dated a remonstrance to France on this occasion, as we 20th November 1891. had ourselves just granted permission for a large consignment to pass through Zeyla to Has Makunan (Sir E. Baring having telegraphed that “ he gets arms freely from Jibuti.”) In 1892 tbe Aden authorities, with reference to Brigadier-General Jopp, 17th March complaints regarding the assistance which, it was 1892 - alleged, was being given by them to the Arab insurgents against Turkish rule in Yemen, reported that a large trade in arms was carried on “ from the French ports in the Gulf of Aden ” to Y r emen generally, to the Bed Sea ports and to the open coast between Aden and Perim. In 1894 papers were sent home concerning an Letter No. 8 (Secret), dated 17th January enquiry which the Austrian Lloyds had addressed 1894. to the Besident as to the grant of a licence to tranship at Aden no less than 100 tons of empty cartridge cases deslined for Obokh. The permit had of course been refused in the absence of information as to the consignees. In 1895 the Besident, again with reference to a Importation of arms from Jibuti complaint by tbe Turks, declared that it was into Arabia. impossible for a systematic trade in arms with the (Brigadier-General Cuningham, No. 387, interior to be carried on from Aden with the dated 16th November 1895). existing police and other arrangements on sea and kind. He referred to the general belief at Aden that arms, &amp;c., were being systematically imported from to Europe to Obokh ; thence transferred to Jibuti and run over in quick-sailing “ buggalows ” to the Arabian coast (e.g., Shaikh Said and Bas-al- Arah), the Besident being unable with the means at his disposal to keep an effectual watch for dhows w hich can make the trip in a few hours and which may be flying a foreign flag. In the same year, the Italian Government, in Despatch to India, No. 17, 24th May consequence of theii troubles in Abyssinia, pressed 1895. for the prohibition of the importation of arms to Menelek through Zeyla. His Majesty’s Govern ment agreed, and the necessary instructions were sent to the Aden authorities. As the Italian Government in preferring their request had asked for those “ pledges of principle which the French Government would be prepared to give,” it was hoped that the French would follow suit. Nevertheless, in 1896 w'e received a most circum- *Dated 31st January 1896. stantial account, contained in a letter* from Lieu tenant Harrington, then Assistant Besident at3 Zeyla, as to the way in which the supply of arms to Abyssinia was bein' permitted by the French officials at Obokh and Jibuti. Despatch to Foreign Office, No. 37, dated 14th June 1897. In 1897 Mr. (now Sir It.) Eodd reported strongly on the whole question, his conclusion being that the arms clauses of the Brussels Act “ operate simply as a self-denying ordinance for the conscientious.” He explained that while, theoieti- cally, arms for Abyssinia were exported to that country from Jibuti on demand from the Emperor Menelek only,—such arms having free transit in accordance with the Brussels Act, practically “ any Abyssinian or Arab coming to Jibuti can buy a rifle.” On guns sold in the Colony a^ tax of one dollar apiece was levied; a formal notification of sale had to be given to the authorities, and “ there the control apparently begins and ends. “ There would appear to be nothing to prevent the “ buyer reselling his rifle even to a Soman. The result of inquiries addressed to French merchants and. of experiments actually made was to show that there was no difficulty even for a native to buy a rifle direct from the shops on payment of the Government tax. In conclusion Mr. Eodd adverted, in words which have been borne out by subsequent experience, to the manner in which the Jibuti traffic reacts on the trade elsewhere“ The large “ stocks now lying at Jibuti (the Abyssinian market “ h a d been glutted) are being sold in thousands to “ Arabs who cross from the opposite coast in their “ dhows. While we in Aden scrupulously forbid “ even the transhipment of arms, Arabs from all “ that neighbourhood are able to satisfy their “ requirements at Jibuti, and a French merchant “ told me that some 20,000 rifles had gone over to « Yemen during the last year.” Mr. Eodd summed up: “ We are labouring to carry out the difficult “ and elaborate provisions of the Brussels Act at “ Suakin, Zeyla, and Zanzibar, with the simple “ result that a lucrative traffic passes into the hands “ 0 f our less scrupulous neighbours.” Effect Of the traffic at jibnti: p.e.ible The next year, 1S98, representations regarding danger to Aden garrison. ppg lack of restriction on the trade at Jibuti and India Letter No. 71, dated 5th May 1898. ^ ie conS equent supply of arms to the tribes in the vicinity of Aden were made by the Government of India.

(Atiffi) tribesmen, and that there was no doubt that such importation was general and carried on without difficulty. He pointed out his own inability to check the growing trade, since the importation did not pass through British territory and the Brussels Act conferred no right of search ; and since also the Sheikhs, who profited pecuniarily and otherwise by the traffic, would not put an end to it nor could they be compelled by the terms of our treaties with them to do so. He expressed the opinion that the tribes, as they became supplied with arms of precision and proficient in their4 handling, might eventually become “ a difficulty, “ if not, indeed, a menace to the garrison at Cf. Pol. $ 69 / 04 . “ Aden.” These papers were referred to the Foreign Office, who did not see their way to address the French Government direct, as had been suggested. They communicated, however, with the Turkish Govern ment in case the Porte might wish to send a remonstrance to the French. The result was not helpful, as the Turks merely thought the occasion a suitable one for requesting that the Aden authorities should refrain from interfering with any measures they might decide to take, to check the traffic, at Ras-al-Arah, within our Protectorate. For some time after this the hulk of the papers refer to the trade in the Persian Gulf where the “ Baluchistan” seizures had just taken place ; but with the continuance of the troubles in Somaliland attention was again directed to the traffic outside the Gulf. A memorandum, dated the 24th October 1901, by Consul-General Hayes Sadler, on the subject of “ the trade in arms at Jibuti and the danger arising “ therefrom to our possessions in East Africa,” was in November 1901 made the text of proposals for concerted action by the Governments of Italy and France and His Majesty’s Government (through the Government of India, the Admiralty, and tbe Somali Coast authorities) with a view to the suppression of the traffic. Lieutenant-Colonel Sadler said “ the most effectual remedy naturally “ lies in closing the market, and this rests with the “ French themselves.” He went on to suggest measures which might be taken should the French Government decline to co-operate; but in that event, he feared, “ we shall not be able altogether “ to stop the trade, though . . . we may be able to “ check it and make it dangerous and expensive.” Proposals for concerted action (No vember 1901). North-East Africa and Soudan Print, 24 th October, Sect. 2. The Consul at Zeyla had previously (on 7th June Arms Traffic Print (Sect. No. 51). 1901) given information regarding the discharge at Jibuti of a large cargo of arms and ammunition, comprising, it was said, some 10,000 rifles, which had been distributed among the shops of the Greek merchants, a large number of them being purchased locally by Arabs, Somalis, and Abyssinians, but the majority placed in sailing boats and despatched to Has Ara, Maide, and Persian Gulf ports. The Resident, also, in a report to the Govern ment of Bombay, dated 26th September 1901, had referred to an inquiry recently made by a German firm, “whether there were any obstacles to the “ transhipment at Aden for Jibuti of guns, cart- “ ridges, and mountain cannons in large quantities 30 or 40 tons fortnightly being mentioned as probable consignments. f On the 27th August 1901 Sir E.

In October 1901 the Consul-General at Berbera reported that orders regulating the import and sale of arms and ammunition at Jibuti had recently been issued by the French Somali Protectorate authorities. The precise intention of these orders the Consul- General had been unable to ascertain, bat he thought they must be “of a strictly prohibitive nature,” judging from the effect produced by their promulgation on the local market. The merchants were hastily selling off their stock and shipping it on board dhows bound for ports on the lied Sea littoral, for Has Ara, Mokallah, and even Basra. In the meantime, they were raising a great outcry and bringing pressure to bear upon the Home Government. This resulted in some abatement from the “ strictly prohibitive ” character of the orders, which it was arranged were not to take full effect until the time allowed for disposing of existing stocks, including consignments already on the way, had elapsed. Moreover, information was given by the Italian Consul-General to the Aden authorities, to the effect that the orders had been rescinded so far as the Turkish dominions w*ere concerned, and that they had actually been in force as against Turkish Arabia for tw r o davs only. On 6th December 1901 Sir E. Monson called attention to the fact that the instructions issued to the Governor of French Somaliland to adhere strictly to the provisions of the Brussels Act did not seem to have had the desired effect. The French Government replied that they had issued instructions and did not feel called 'upon to do more ; iliat no arms could be sold in Jibuti without the Governor’s knowledge, and that they w^ere powerless to prevent the shipping of arms for ports outside the zone contemplated by the Brussels Act.* In February 1902 the Commander of H.M.S. “ Cossack,” in a report on the conditions of the traffic at the time, said: “The French authorities “ do not allow arms to he sold to Somali tribes, “ hut there is no difficulty in obtaining a permit to ship ... if the Captain declares he is “ bound to an Arabian port.” * Viz.: “The territories comprised between latitude 20 N. “ and 22 S., and extending westward to the Atlantic Ocean and “ eastward to the Indian Ocean and its dependencies.” S. 39. BFurther light is thrown on the nature of the control exercised at Jibuti by the circumstances Arms Traffic Print, Sect. 80. attending the seizure in March 1902 by H.M.S. “ Cossack ” of a fishing boat laden with arms and ammunition. Though hailing from Sur (in Oman), the crew confessed to having purchased the guns at Jibuti ; the Acting Consul-General believed that many similar cases were occurring, and that the fishermen not only invested their earnings in these goods, but were also financed by local merchants, the profits of the trade being large, since the price of a rifle with 100 rounds of ammunition was 15 dollars at Jibuti, and 45 dollars, e.g., at the Mijjertein ports. The papers found on board this dhow disclosed the fact that Arab middlemen were employed at Jibuti for conducting the traffic ; and the master of the dhow declared that he did not see a single official there, either European or Native, and that no attempt was made to verify his papers or inspect his vessel before departure. The French Ambassador, who had been ap proached on the subject in April and again in May 1902, said that his Government had already made representations to the local authorities. These seem to have produced some effect, for the Senior Naval Officer reported in June 1902 that the Governor of Jibuti was taking “very stringent measures,” the premises of arms dealers being watched by police, and a dhow seized containing a cargo of arms for the Arabian coast. The Jibuti authorities also punished, with imprisonment and confiscation of property, the owner of a boat which an armed dhow manned from H.M.S. “Perseus” had captured, Avith arms on board, in June 1902, bound for Bir Ali, a small rcarlstead in Aden waters. By July 1902 the Senior Naval Officer considered that the (jo\ r ernor’s strong measures had, for a time at least, “ paralysed the export trade.” In October 1902 tbe French \\'ere reported to have an armed dhow cruising to prevent the traffic with British and Italian ports. They were also requested to notify to the Aden authorities the departure of dhows for ports outside tbe prohibited zone* (Foreign Office Despatch to Sir E. Monson, No. 187). “ Stringent measures ” at Jibut,i 1902. Despatch to India, No. 42, of 3rd October 1902, Enclosure 9, Annex. Ditto, Enclosure 15, Annex 2. Large consignments, however, continued to pour into Jibuti. In August 1902 it was reported from Aden that 225 cases of rifles and 525 of ammunition had been landed from the steamship “ Turkestan” at Jibuti, and that a large country boat loaded with rifles, &amp;c., had left that port for the Arabian coast. Further consignments arrived in the “ Madagascar,” the “ Kor Byster,” “ Vildymeis,” and “Africander.” The Aden authorities reported the distribution of these arms by buggalows sailing to various ports on the opposite coast. Large consignments sent to Jibuti, 1902: * See French Government’s statement (page o) in December 1901.7 Enclosure of Bombay Letter No. 40, dated It was observed by the Resident at Aden, in a Hth October 1902. {Pol. 1605/02.) report dated 13th September 1902, that the major portion of the consignments for Jibuti were being carried in British-owned ships from Marseilles. Effect of the measures taken by the French. Arms Traffic Print, Sect. 102. The view taken by His Majesty’s Government at this stage is contained in a note which was com municated in December 1902 to the French Ambassador. It was there pointed out that “ the “ Jibuti fire-arms traffic is now entering on a new “ and more dangerous phase” ; that, as the over-sea traffic with the north coast ports of the Somali Protectorate was now practically dead,* and as the Abyssinians were getting their supplies direct from Europe, the surplus stock at Jibuti was finding an outlet overland to the Ogaden country. In February 1903 the French Ambassador stated Diversion of the traffic to Abyssmia. Government had made special inquiries into the matter, and had ascertained positively that no arms found their way direct from Jibuti into Somaliland. There was admitted to be a trade with Abyssinia, whence presumably came the arms of French manufacture found in Somaliland. This was also the view of the Naval Commander- in-Chief and of the Italian Government. The Naval Commander-in-Chief, reporting on 1st April 1903, said: “ I am of opinion that gun- “ running by sea is practically stopped, owing to “ patrolling by men-of-war, and that arms are “ brought into Somaliland from Jibuti to Harrar, “ and distributed . . . from the latter place by “ caravan.” The Italian Ambassador, in a note of 14th July 1903, after belittling the part played by the Pol. 2853 / 03 . Mij jertein Sheikhs in supplying arms to the Mullah, remarked: “ He has a more safe and prompt way “ of obtaining arms, viz., Harrar and Jibuti, where “ stores are known to exist, and which are the “ centre of the arms trade in the Red Sea and the • “ Gulf of Aden.” Present condition of traffic at Jibuti. Despatch to India {Secret) JYo. 2, dated 15th January Enclosure 7, Annex 3 and /+. Pol. 3155103. So the matter rests with regard to Jibuti. The result of the measures taken appears to have been the checking (for a time) of the dhow-borne traffic and its diversion to Abyssinia. Here the Abyssinian authorities are understood to have taken steps to regulate the traffic (especially with Somalis), the effect of which is said to have been to render un profitable legitimate traffic. But it is also under stood that the consignments sent out by at least one well-known English firm to their agent at Harrar have not been diminishing. Meanwhile, it is hardly safe to assume that the dhow traffic has completely ceased, while the difficulties of coping with it are represented by the naval authorities to be as formidable as ever. Moreover, in a despatch of 20th October 1903, the British Consul at Marseilles draws attention to the continued importation of * The’tmval authorities so reported.8 arms into Jibuti. “ Every steamer leaving Mar- “ seilles for Jibuti has some on board, discarded “ French rifles or weapons of Belgian make.” See also India Letter No. §3 (Secret), dated 21 st April as to traffic at Jibuti (Pol. 86 &lt;) j 01 ,). As regards the other ports of supply, what was Ports of Supply other than Jibuti, said by Consul Cordeaux in November 1901 seems still to be applicable :—“ However many channels “ there may be, they all start from Jibuti, and “ until the fountain head is closed, it will he “ difficult to check the flow to any appreciable “ extent.” Before referring to the “ channels ” alluded to (which from the Somaliland point of view are to be reckoned among “ ports of supply,”) mention may be made of two sources said to be independent of Jibuti. • Zanzibar fell under suspicion on the strength of information given by deserters from the Mullah. The authorities there, though observing all vigilance, were unable to obtain confirmation of the report, which they suggested had been spread in order to impress the Mullah’s followers with the extent of his influence and the ubiquity of his agents. Zanzibar. Pol. 2$71j03. Muscat .—As far hack as 1892 apprehensions had been expressed that arms from Muscat might find their way back to the Benadir and Somali coasts ; and in 1899 representations on the subject from the Italian Consul-General at Zanzibar were referred to the Government of India, who replied that there was ground for believing that the Italian fears were not altogether unfounded. Export from Muscat at Sur, where there was very little demand for arms, was then said to be not only permitted hut encouraged by the Sultan The Government of India hoped to enlist the Sultan’s assistance in checking the traffic both within and without the Gulf. The Political Agent at Muscat, in a report on this subject, of 29th January 1900 observes “ it is “ certain that there is no organised traffic from “ Muscat southwards,” and suggests the following explanation : — To the uninitiated “ Suri ” and “ Maskati ” as applied to Arab dhows are synonymous; but the owners of Suri dhows are only in name subjects of the Sultan of Muscat; on the other hand they often fly the French flag, and are welcome guests at Jibuti, where many of them own plots of ground. At Sur they take on board as cargo dates, from Oman and from Basra, for conveyance to East Africa; after disposing of these dates they invest the proceeds in arms at Jibuti, and ship them to the Benadir and Somali coasts. In view of the conditions of trade as described above, and taking into account the variations of the monsoon, it suited the Suri dhows better to get their arms at Jibuti, (where there was then a free market) than from Muscat itself, and Captain Cox did not think, from the informa tion he possessed, that Muscat arms were sent down to Sur.

Aden Protectorate ports. In a letter to the Naval Commander-in-Chief of 21st March 1903, Major Cox repeats his opinion that Sari dhows carrying arms for Somaliland obtain them from Jibuti, and not from Muscat. In any case it is certain that the Persian Gulf, and not the Gulf of Aden, is the main field of Muscat activity. In this connection it may be observed that the recent case of a seizure of arms in Muscat harbour and their release upon their being declared as under shipment to Sur, shows that, in spite of the “ assistance ” rendered by the Sultan (in the way of notifications &amp;c.,)* a loophole has been left. The export of arms to Sur is permitted, and this, as the naval authorities pointed out, protects a dhow until she passes “ the Quoins,’’ i.e. until “ all chance “ of identifying her as carrying arms will have “ been lost.” There remain as ports of supply the ports ol the Aden Protectorate. In view of the repeated requests preferred upon this Office to obtain assistance from the Resident, and since it is only with the ports under Aden jurisdiction that the Resident is directly concerned, it will be as well to examine closely the evidence implicating these ports. Evidence impUcating Aden ports. During 1901 the Italian Government took up the question of the arms traffic, and on the 17th July 1901 the Foreign Office sent over, to be laid before the Secretary of State, a note from the Italian Ambassador, suggesting that a stricter supervision should be exercised over Somali sam- bouks, said to be engaged in the contraband traffic between Aden and Bombay and Somaliland. On this suggestion the views of Consul-General Hayes Sadler and the Resident were obtained. Enclosure to India letter No. 166, dated Lieutenant-Colonel Hayes Sadler, in Despatch 17th October 1901. dated 12th August 1901, said My information Arms Traffic Print, Section 56. “ in no way points to the trade being carried on “ by the lines indicated by the Italian Ambas- “ sador . . . The arms are obtained at Jibuti, “ and they are taken to the Mijjertein coast, either “ direct from «1 ibuti or irom ports on the Red “ Sea, or South Arabia, by buggalows belonging to “ the Mijjertein, or to Arabs plying between the “ south coast of Arabia and the north African “ shore .... Such buggalows would have “ every reason to avoid the British ports named “ (Aden, Bombay, and Zanzibar), and the ports of “ this (the British Somali) Protectorate, where all “ possible preventive measures are taken.” India, 17th October 1901. On the strength of this the Government of India saw no advantage to be gained by stricter super- vision at Aden. The Resident, in his report of 26th September 1901, said: “ there is reason to believe that “ the importation of arms and ammunition is “ carried on at Ras-el-Arah (the extreme western S. 39. C10 “Vi mit of our protectorate), at Shukra, and at the ‘ ‘T urkish ports on the Red Sea.” They are ‘ ‘ most frequently brought from Jibuti in boats ‘ ‘with other cargo, . . . many of which fly “ the Erench flag, and could not be overhauled.” At it was supposed that measures of suppression were being taken at Jibuti, the Government of India were requested to issue instructions in the sense of the recommendations contained in Consul- General Hayes Sadler’s memorandum of 24th October 1901, so far as these referred to the Aden authorities. In his letter of 2Sth March 1902 the Resident reported the action taken. The particular places mentioned as possibly con cerned in the traffic were Mokallah, Balhaf, Shukra, Has Imran, and Ras ArhTh As regards Mokallah the Resident pointed out that, while the Sultan was very anxious to obtain arms for himself, he was very much against anyone else getting them, for possible use against himself. As regards Shukra no definite confirmation of the reports had been obtained, but they were considered possibly to have some foundation. As regards the general question:—“ It is very doubtful whether any but “ small quantities of arms are landed at Mokallah, “ or any of the Aiabian ports,” but “ dhows “ come across the Gulf, take in water and pro- “ visions at some' place not further east than “ Mokallah, and then make for one of the ports “ on the Mijjertein shore.” On 25th May 1902 the Resident explained “ the reason why dhows with “ arms come to the Arabian coast at all is because the “ Erench authorities at Jibuti will not permit the “ export of arms direct to Somaliland. The arms “ are therefore purchased by Arab agents of the “ Mulla, who ship them in dhows for some port “ on the Arabian coast. There the dhows stay a “ day or two, take in provisions and water, and “ start again for the coast of Africa.” This staterm nt, read in connection with Consul- General Sadloi’s account of the way in which road steads in Aden waters are resorted to for tranship ment of arms from Arab dhows hailing from Jibuti to Mijjertein, and other dhows, bound for the Mijjertein coast, seems fairly conclusive as to the nature of the traffic carried on within the Aden jurisdiction. It is in keeping, too, with what the Italians themselves represented. The Mijjertein Sultan, Othman Mahmoud, informed an Italian naval officer that “ the Native vessels take the arms on board at a place on the Arab coast bordering on Sheikh Osman territory ” (at the western extremity of the British Protectorate) and also at Sheikh Ghadir further west. The Native vessels are “ visited by the British authorities on their arrival 4t at, and departure from, Aden, and provided by “ these with papers regularised in due order; once ■“ in possession of these papers, they start and Despatch No. 37, dated 15th November 1901.

To return to the suspect Aden ports. In Pebruary 1902, the Commander of the “ Cossack,” on information received from “ two intelligent local Arabs,” named Mokallah and Balhaf as, in his opinion, “ the principal places for the export of arms from the Arabian coast,” the trade at the former place being “ carried on openly.” This is not inconsistent with the belief of the Resident that the Sultan of Mokallah disapproved of the trade, for, as stated by the Government of Bombay, “his influence in his own territory is “ very small as compared with that of his nephews, “ who are not so scrupulously observant of orders.” The same two places, Mokallah and Balhaf, were in April 1902 declared by the Italians (relying apparently on the statement of an emissary of the Mijjertein Sultan, himself a suspect) to be “ the places from which the arms are shipped.” On the other hand, when the “ Cossack ” visited these two ports in May 1902, 18 vessels were searched without result. The “ Perseus ” in July met with no greater success. In May 1903, the Consul at Berbera, referring to the continued importation of arms at Bosaso, in the Italian Protectorate, suggested that as that port trades principally with Mokallah the latter “ is probably an entrepot for supplies for the Mullah.” H.M.S. “ Pomone ” accordingly visited the place as well as the neighbouring Ash Sheyr. All the dhows in the harbour were boarded and nothing suspicious found. Assurances were received from the Sultan’s son and from the agent of a firm of merchants resident at Mokallah, that no arms * “At Ras Imran, . . . the Sultan of Lahej does his best to stop the trade, but there is a certain amount of transhipment to Mijjertein Somali dhows and also a number of dhows carrying arms to other ports, resorting to Ras Imram to water.” (Despatch to India, No. 13, of 11th April 1902, Enclosure 9, Annex 3).12 r. Sl were being sent to Somaliland from either port. A jemadar of police from Aden also made inquiries in the town, but was unable to obtain any infor mation of the traffic. The conclusions arrived at by the naval authorities were— (1) That no traffic could go on without the Sultan’s connivance ; (2) That very little traffic in arms takes place from Mokallah. The Resident had previously reported that he had never been able to obtain any confirmation of Pol. 529/03. Mokallah being an entrepbt of the traffic. On the whole, the evidence that Aden ports are to any great extent concerned in the arms trade to Somaliland, except indirectly, does not seem to be overwhelming. Pol. 705/02. To complete the review of possible ports of supply mention should be made of the Red Sea ports above Hodeida, to which frequent sailings from Jibuti have been reported. A long stretch of this littoral is not even nominallv under the effective control of the Turks—or was not towards Red Sea Ports. the end of 1902, when the coast between Loheya and Jeddah (within which points lie Medi, Soorer, and Revis, to all of which shipments of arms have been definitely reported), was in the hands of the Imam of Sana. The arms run on this coast, however, are probably absorbed in Yemen. Enclosure 3 of Bombay letter No. 40 dated 14th October 1902. Ports of entry call for little comment.

The chief places mentioned in connection with the traffic are Bosaso (Funder Kasim), and Has Alula. That the conditions have changed but little the following extract from a report by the Commander of H.M.S. “Fox,” dated the 14th October 1903, would seem to show : “ We have in the Italian “ sphere such large trading places as Zaida, Bunder “ Kasim, Bas Alula, Boraida on the north, and the “ splendid sheltered anchorages at Has Hufun on “ the east coast, in addition to such places as Illig, “ Obbia, &amp;c. This coast is under normal (sic ? no- “ minal) protection of Italy, hut the Italians make “ no attempt to control it, beyond obtaining cer- “ tain promises in treaties* from the various native “ chiefs; and it is not to their interest to interfere “ so long as things remain quiet within their “ protectorate.” The Italian Government have throughout dis played their readiness to adopt measures of suppression in concert with His Majesty’s Govern ment. They have seriously warned the Mijjertein Sultan and have sent men-of-war to patrol the coast. But the Italian naval officers would not admit that any considerable traffic was really carried on from their protectorate, and it is true that the dhow-searching cruisers of the “Cossack” and the “ Caprera ” in April 1903 proved practically fruitless. The Italian Government also have from time to time expressed doubts as to the existence of systematic, as distinguished from spasmodic traffic on the Mijjertein coast, perhaps relying too implicitly on the assuiances of a Mijjertein headman which Consul Cordeaux characterised as worthless. On the other hand the Italian Government have admitted, in despatches, that “ it is likely enough “ that Osman Mahmoud (the Mijjertein Sultan) “ should have yielded in some way to the pressure “ of the Mullah, of whose violence and threats he “ goes in great fear,” and, again, “ the Sultan and “ his party are unable to keep a more effective “ watch in ever so small a degree. . . . The Sultan “ has only an imaginary authority in that wild “ country.” Moreover, the Commander of H.M.S. “ Fox ” observes, “ It is immensely to these “ (Italian) Chiefs’ advantage to assist the arms “ traffic, the risk of a few 7 rifles lost making little “ diflerence compared with the profit gained by “ selling the arms and keeping on friendly terms “ with the Mullah.” Measures of Suppression. Lastly, as to the measures adopted with a view to suppressing the trade. S. 39. D14 Action taken by the Resident at Aden. It will be convenient in the first place to recount what the Resident has done and why, with the means at his disposal, he can do no more. The first step was the issue of notifications and warnings against the triffic. As regards Aden itself the strict provisions of the Indian Arms Act were already well-known and enforced. Rut the following further measures were taken. Among Lieutenant-Colonel Hayes Sadler’s recom mendations which were adopted by the Foreign Office towards the end of 1901, was one that the Resident should be empowered to order, if necessary, the stoppage of all trade between Aden and the offending Somali ports. Our despatch of the 15th November 1901 requested that t .e necessary instructions should he given; but the orders at first sent to the Resident by the Bombay Govern ment seem to have been simply that the gun-boat at Aden should stop or capture all dhows, with the exception of those flying the French flag, suspected of bringing arms to the Aden Coast. In Alarch 1902, however, the Resident expressed his willing ness to resort to the extreme measure of stopping all trade between Aden and any Somali ports which might be named by the Somali Coast authorities. Shortly afterwards, owing to a serious recrudescence of the traffic, the Resident was called upon by Colonel Swayne to fulfil this undertaking and to take steps for diverting Aden trade from the Eastern ports of Somaliland to Berbera and the more westerly ports, where more complete control could be exercised. He accordingly issued a set of rules requiring that all ships leaving Aden for ports on either side of the Gulf of Aden should take out a port-clearance and that the masters should execute a joint and several bond before leaving. Penalties, of fine or imprisonment, or both, were prescribed against vessels which migiit be found not to have proceeded direct to their destination (except under stress of weather, &amp;c.) or which should be found to have engaged in the arms traffic after clearing from Aden. These rules, which the Resident explained were intended to meet an acute, though temporary emergency and which he was subsequently autho rised lo relax at his discretion, were found to have been ultra vires, and steps were taken in India to legalise them by the issue of a notification under Cap. 3 Viet. 33. Even the amended Regulation, however, which was entitled the Aden Sea Iraific in Arms Regulation, 1902,” does not appear to have contemplated the case of the trade with the Red Sea ports; it was aRo feared that the rules were evaded by vessels sailing for the Mijjertein ports, and thence sending their cargoes overland. Steps to remedy this defect were taken by the Italian Consul-General who required that masters of such vessels should execute a bond first to touch at r Notifications at Aden itself.

It should be added that the Resident represented that his hands would be considerably strengthened by the issue of a proclamation warning^Eritish subjects against giving help to the Iving*s enemies. The issue of such a proclamation in regard to the operations in Somaliland was not. however, con sidered expedient. Outside Aden the Resident can, under present conditions, only act through the Maritime Chiefs, these have been repeatedly warned against con niving at the arms traffic; but for these warnings to be effective several conditions must he fulfilled. Ihe chiefs and the tribes under them are often interested in the traffic pecuniarily or otherwise. The Resident can urge the chiefs to put a stop to if on pain of the displeasure of Government, and can employ the threat of withholding subsidies and closing the ports concerned ; but the latter is an extreme measure and the former of doubtful expediency, since it is considered absolutely neces- sary to enlist the aid of the chiefs. Attitude of the Chiefs towards the arms traffic. Enclosure .5 of India letter 135, of 7th August 1902. Po/. 705/02. See also Pol. 989 /O',. India Letter No. 135 (Secret), dated 7th August 1902. (Pol. 111,3/02.) 1 he success, therefore, of the measures taken outside Aden itself depends on the Chiefs’ will and power to co-operate. Some of the more important Chiefs are allowed to indent on Government for a limited number of arms each year. This policy, it was hoped, would not only enable Government to control the supply of arms at any time, but would also render it to the interest of these chiefs to discourage the illicit trade ; but, as the Government of Bombay have pointed out, “ So long as the * disturbances in Yemen and Somaliland continue “ the trade is extremely profitable, and the small Arab chiefs are as a rule needy, and, of course, avaricious. ’ In spite of the temptation which thus exists to connive at the smuggling of arms, the Sultan of Eahej, on the west, has been reported, even by the naval authorities, to be doing his best to suppress it; and the Sultan of Mokallah, in the east, (who has special reasons for wishing to stand well with Government) is believed to be of the same mind. On leaving for India in 1902 he gave strict orders that all dhows at Mokallah should be searched and that all arms found should be con fiscated. The Resident was satisfied that these orders would be carried out; and the reception given by the Mokallah authorities to the officers of the “ Cossack ” in 1903 seems to confirm this view. As to the power of the chiefs, it has been the policy of the Government of India to consolidate the authority of the Sultan of Lahej on the west, and of the Sultan of Shehr and Mokallah on the east, in order that they may be able to put down the traffic more effectually. For this, however.16 time is required, and such a state of affairs as prevailed in Mokallah during 1902 (when Sultan Awadth’s nephews were in revolt against him) was all in favour of a brisk trade in arms being carried on. The other means at the disposal of the Resident are what may be called “ preventive measures. At Aden itself these are very rigorous. The Arms Act is strictly administered, and Colonel Abud, reporting on 13th September 1902 as to the alleged shipments of ammunition by count ry boats leaving Aden for Red Sea ports, said . n y “ very small quantities of ammunition are evei “ imported into Aden, and . • . as none is “ manufactured at Aden, none can be exported. “ ]\ T o ammunition can, moreover, be exported trom “ Aden without a license, and no licenses have “been issued for the export of ammunition iy “ country craft.’’ As regards illicit import and export, he was convinced that it could not possibly exist, owing to the safe-guards employed. Country craft especially are subjected to close supervision, both on arrival and departure, and the trade registration officials, as well as the haroour police have instructions to keep a special look out oi arms and ammunition. _ . The seizures of ammunition, &amp;c., at Aden m July and October 1903, and Major Pilleau s successful capture of arms in Socotra last \eai, show that the Aden authorities are not relaxing Preventive measures. At Aden itself. Enclosure to letter from Government of Bombay, No. 40, dated 14th October 1902. {Pol 1605/02.) Pol. 10$8, 1/,66/03, Q65/03. their vigilance. Along the coast of the Protectorate, “uith its innumerable small ports and watering places, no such thorough measures are possible. 1 he uaval authorities have advocated the establishment of police posts at Eas Imran and other places an expedient which seems open to objection on political grounds, and one which is not likely to prove effective, as fixed posts, while difficult to establish, are easy to evade. On one occasion the Eesident suggested that a small hut well-paid force of coast police, under European supervision as in the British Somali Protectorate, should he instituted. This suggestion, the Government of Bombay observed, required consideration. In the absence of some such service, however, very little can be done by means of a few police agents, for, as the Resident has pointed out, “the moment a man “ known to he in our ^employ leaves Aden the tact “ is widely published.” Under existing conditions, therefore, it is clear that the work of suppressing the traffic on tne Aden coast must fall in the mam on the Royal Navy. Periodical patrols by men-of-war or armed dhows seem likely to prove more ell'ective than any action which can be taken on land, and par ticularly as regards that transhipment of arms from Arab to Mijjertein Somali dhows in Aden waters which has been described above.

A general warning against participation in the traffic was given in 1901 by the Acting Consul* General, who visited all the small ports from Berhera eastwards for the purpose. Agents were placed in all the flag ports ; it was found possible to establish ports of control into which the buggalow trade was more or less directed. In addition to patrolling by British and Italian ships, armed dhows have been employed as revenue cutlers for the Protectorate and King’s Regulations issued to legalise their action within the territorial waters. These dhows appear to have proved a success. Despatch to India, No. 13, dated 11th April 1902, Enclosnre 8, Annex 4. North-East Africa and Soudan Print, Section 2, dated 24th October 1901.

The action taken by the Italians has been confined for the most part to warnings addressed to the Chiefs and patrolling by sea. It has been pointed out that they have the buggalow traffic in their power ; they themselves recognised that they can threaten to suspend subsidies and to bombard the offending ports. But the measures suggested by Colonel Swayne in August 1902 (viz., the blockade of Othman Mahmud’s coasts and the seizure of his buggalows) were too drastic for the Italian Government, and since the affair at Baraida, the Commander of H.M.S. “ Fox ” reports, the Italian naval officers have had strict orders not to land any men for the purposes of search. Italian Somaliland is thus much less completely controlled than is the British protectorate; and the more stringent the measures taken by the British authorities the more important will this fact become. Naval Measures. Arms Traffic Print, Section 89/1902. Naval Difficulties. Despatch to India, No. 2, dated 15th January 1904, Enclosure 7, Annex 6. * Unfortunately, this assumption would hardly hold good in a court of law. British men-of-war have been specially employed in patrolling the coast since 1901, and Italian vessels have acted in conjunction with them. Dhows have been seized from time to time, and many more subjected to examination, with the result tfat the arms traffic was “at a standstill” in May 1902; “recent measures have exercised a depressing effect ” (June 1902); “ gun-running by sea has been practically stopped ” (April 1903). But the naval authorities are of opinion that the illicit traffic cannot be completely stopped by ships alone, short of a regular blockade, “ which would “ necessitate more ships than are ever likely to be “ authorised for the purpose.” They h ive advocated the adoption of a system of Cusioms-police super vision on land and the bringing to justice of British firms shipping arms to Jibuti, “ which they “ must* know r are being used against our authority “ in those parts, and in contravention of the “ Brussels Convention.” S. 39. E18 The naval difficulties are: the great extent of coast to be watched (to do this effectively Admiral ■VYilles estimated that nine vessels would be required, six for patrolling and three for reliefs); the readiness with which, in the last resort, arms can be thrown overboard, and the fact that when once a cargo of arms has been run “ it is the “ simplest thing in the world to hide them, so that “ search by landing parties is fruitless.” In many respects, too, men-of-war (besides being expensive) are unsuited for chasing light boats drawing little water. Moreover, naA^al action is confined to the territorial waters ; to enable His Majesty’s ships to exercise the right of search on the high seas, legislation in respect of British ships and treaties with the Foreign Powers concerned would be required. (The Sultan of Muscat has already given the requisite authority to both British and Italian men-of-war to search Muscat vessels on the high seas, as well as within the territorial waters.)

The extension of the system of employing armed dhows seems to promise better results; those equipped by the Somali Coast authorities as revenue cutters are said to be patrolling some 240 miles of coast. The Italian Government employ similar craft on the coast of their Protectorate. The only seizure in Aden waters which has been reported was effected by an armed dhow from the “ Perseus.” At one time or another patrolling by armed dhows has been advocated by the naval authorities, the Viceroy and the Resident, who says, in his letter of 25th May 1902, “ apparently the only way of capturing dhows is to employ dhows.” « Admiral IVilles, dated 16 th October 1Q03 (Annex 1, Enclosure 7&gt; Despatch to India, (Secret), No. 2, dated 15th January 1&lt;)olj).

Specifically, the document discusses what it refers to as the 'spasmodic' illicit traffic of arms (as opposed to 'systematic' traffic) which has been carried out by masters of dhows carrying other merchandise. Most of the file is concerned with the traffic of arms from Jibuti [Djibouti] – which is referred to as '
                           thedistributing centre [original italics]' for the arms trade outside of the Persian Gulf – to ports in the Gulf of Aden.The document provides a brief history (from a British perspective) of traffic from Jibuti in the years since the signing of the Brussels Convention in 1890. It summarises, and provides references to, letters and despatches from a number of British authorities, which discuss various issues relating to the arms trade out of Jibuti, including: the extent to which traffic at Jibuti has been regulated; the possible threat that the traffic poses to the Aden garrison; the effects of measures taken by the French to curtail the traffic from Jibuti; other possible ports of supply, such as Zanzibar, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate ports.Also discussed are the attitudes of the maritime chiefs to the arms traffic, the various preventive measures available to the Resident at Aden for dealing with the effects of the traffic at Aden, an account of measures taken both by the British Somaliland authorities and by the Italian authorities, and an evaluation of the naval measures taken by the British since 1901. The file concludes by noting that one possible solution to the problem could be the deployment of armed dhows, a measure which previously has been advocated by the naval authorities, the Viceroy and the Resident at Aden.The document is attributed to P H D [P H Dumbell, Reading Clerk to the Council, India Office].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Jibuti</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gulf of Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>British Somaliland</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arms control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><subject><topic>Dhows</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000311#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
