GOLDEN. ^/Station Superlrt* ij *'itCOPI FOniilGfc OFFlCiii, S.W. 1. 2nd March, 1950. C OlMlIDGiM'TIii L Sir, In my despatch ho. (Ah 3998/39970) of 6 th iipril, 1948, I drew attention to the necessity for establishing harmonious and constructive colleboration with your United States colleague with a view to progressive achievement of the joint objectives of His Majesty’s Government and the United states Government in the Middle Hast area. This question was also referred to in the course of the conference ol His Majesty's Representatives in the Middle Hast held in London in the summer of 1949. 2. The subject was again raised in the course of the discussions which Mr. Wright had with members of the ntate Department in Washington in November, 1949, and as a result it has been agreed with the State Department that the attention of His Majesty's Representatives and of the United States Representatives in the area should again be called to the importance of the maintenance of the closest United Kingdom/United btates collaboration in all these countries. It is therefore desirable that there shall be a continuing exchange of information and views between you and your United States colleague, and your respective staffs. 3. It has also been considered whether these views could usefully be expressed to prominent members of the British and American communities in these countries. The view of the State Department, with which I am in general agreement is that while it must be our aim that the relations between these communities should be made as close and harmonious as possible, it should be left to the discretion of His Majesty's and the united otates Representatives to decide to what extent it is possible or desirable to advise their communities in this sense, as it is felt that any general exhortation might possibly give grounds for misunderstanding.
