Dated 7th September 1928 , Your telegram No* T-313 (No* C-11 to London)* I have no information to confirm this* I have seen Shaikh Ahmad this morning, and he thinks that the rumour current at Bahrain is in all probability the exaggeration of a report which he has received that Ibn Sa ! ud has sent strict orders to his tribes to keep quiet and under no olrcuastances to go raiding before his return* He is said to have made use of the phrase 'Please God, our paths will be one again”, which has most likely given rise to the rumour, but which the Shaikh interprets as the merest platitude. The Shaikh is convinced that Ibn Sa’ud is striving for peace, and that he did not come to an agreement at the recent Conference merely because he could not have enforced such an agreement on his tribes* The trade agent of Ibn 3 a'ud at Kuwait has received a telegram from Mecca saying that Ibn Sa’dd has left for Riyadh - presumably on the 4th September*Telegram (F).

All the tribal leaders who had been summoned had been there for some time with the exception of him and Daw£sh. At first Ibn Sa'ud had tried everything in his power to induce both of them to come in. Later on however he accepted Dawfsh’s excuse that he could not come himself owing to ill health, and concentrated on Ibn Humaid. The latter's influence over his own tribe has apparently waned considerably, and the other 'Utaibah shaikhs offered to go and bring him by force. It is even said that Dawlsh, once his own excuse had been accepted, wrote and advised hi* to go ( the explanation being that it is only fear for personal safety that makes either unwilling to go)* In any case it was certain that Ibn Humaid was coming in, and that as soon as he arrived the business of the confer ence would be begun. If the conference proved satisfactory, as ib was now hoped it would* Ibn Sa'ud would then proceed to Hasa, and after wards to 'Uqair, where he had arranged to meet a representa tive of His Majesty's Government.

The real trouble was over the ’Iraq Desert posts, which are viewed by the Ikhwan as the thin end of the wedge in a systematic en croachment on Najd.

After much discussion with the _* ill am a it was decided that both were lawful.

He further said that, before the 'uwieh «t irteri niding * Iraq regularly, the ritieh Government had baen of great value to the uellmin, giving them weapons md money, «.ueh of which hee been parked on by ibn a’ud to the Hhaikhe. Xhe 'uwi«h» r act* had firet caueed the Govern ment to cut off hie pay, and had then forced Govern; ent to send force* and to build po?t* in the denert. Xhe 'uwieh himrelf was therefore responsible for the eylstance of ti*e poets* \n long ae the latter maintained his old altitude, Ibn a*ud could not demand the destruction of the posts, and h id not done so yet. lut if the Duwieh repented, openly made eufc;.i*aion and signed an undertaking to be obedient in future, Xbn So *ud might then approach the Government on the sub ject of the &gt;orte at the forthcoming conference at U &gt;nir. ibn Ba'ud ex 1 ained that he had no lining for infi Jeie or Christiana nor for the British, but that their friendship wae of value to the uell:- in, and that his rolicy war to get as much out of them in he could for the benefit of the true Muslims. The Government aid he had long worked on a policy of ^ive and take, but the uwieh hid up^et the whole situation. if he persist ad, Government would become more angry ntill, and could easily overthrow himself (IhriCsdud) and the Tuwifsh, md ruin the ^ueliioin, who after all were only be due. if, on the other band, the uwisib wanted to destroy the posts himself, he could 1 o so. Perhaps he would defeat the Government. If so, ibn Ta’ud wished his* joy, but he would not hi. seif have -any part or lot in the matter. (Tote. The 'above is probably the 4 let of Ibn Ga’ud 1 • replies to the 'Duwieh, aid of hie public pronouncements. ) A.s the correspondence continued, ibn BVud bec-arne firmerthe )uwiah toa&lt; t* M climb ’own'** Eventually tiie letter sent his seal to tiyadh, telling Ibn tin* d to affix it to any documents he 1 i &lt; a d j that he, ^ il p il, should obey all hi* order*, but that he oould not cothn to xiyedh because he wa» afraid. it is generally conjectured that, if ibn Sa’ud could seize the person of Faisal, he rrould ^et ^in him in hi* suite personally, mu ch as he ha* done s?ith Ibn Hash id On receiving the ywish's last subiri*«iv# letter, accompanied by the seal, (Ibn Jiallaf allege*) Ibn Sa’ud turned hi* attention from the * , uwish to Ibn Humaid* he had written to him that, if he did not come to hiyadh, he 3a*ud. It is stated that Ibn rumaid replied that he could not come, and that he had no mudhif in which to receive Ibn r.a»ud. Ibn Hallaf thought that Ibn Ba*ud was probably pretending to be temporarily satisfied with the uwish 1 * letter in order to turn hi* attention to Ibn rum aid. Ihe great object was to separate them. It was believed that Ibn hum a id was already angered with the huwi *h, for sub mitting so far. bhaidan Ibn iithlain has also refi.sed to reportto Riyadh, but nobody eeemv to be attaching much importance to him either way. Having sworn a foint oath with the Tuwish and Ibn uumaid before, he is deterred from visiting ibn 3a«ud for fear o*' punishment, rather than from insubordinat ion. 2 . vi air -: cf thi vh4^.vt. ihe administrative Inspector asked Ibn hallaf whether it was his opinion that, should the tatwieh and ibn Hum a id persist in their refusal to meet ibn Ha’ud, the latter would march against them. he replied that he had better tidy up his mudhif and prepare dinner thought•» 4 ■* thought this very unliKely. in hit vie**, Ibn 3e*ud had no forces to put againot there oreopt the townmnen of Nafd, who were not oufficiently numerous. Had ibn Sa'ud unfurled hie barmor la»t January, iarb r ha m ir, \wa 2 iro, Qahtan and many other tribee would have joined him against utair and Ibn humaid. in fact they were daily expecting eiiCh xn order. Instead of this, however, ibn Sa’ud did nothing, and the newish proceeded to raid Ibn &gt;a*ud *« own tribes. Ibn .uraaid then moved up, and c vnped at \jibba, on top of * ahain al Fix», who© he terrorized into agreement with hire, although M firm had, until then, been looked up at ibn Sa’ud* e especial rean* Finally at Buraidsua, ibn Sa'ud had poured out gold and gift* to the very people who had been disobeying hie orders and raiding hi* tublaote. *here had, however, been no compensation for the victim*, As a result, nobody would now declare openly for ibn i-a’ud against the fuwish or Ibn -umaid, lest they be raided by them. Xbn Hallaf said that he found that, when he broached the subject cautiously to Hald hoikhe in Riyadh, they hastily said •’we follow the road of islais' 1 , and changed the subject. Mahein al V'ina, when MMHMIMMl to UplA six ws oks ago, was afraid to proceed, lest the Ikiwish be annoyed and raid him, withj Ibn Sa*ud impassive far away in Riyadh. ^ahoin is one of the principal Akhwan chisfs, and was previously a firm supuortsr of Ibn ’a 1 ud. ::*ut he was afraid to visit iiyadh, until \*aiyi* al ruwish went.

It seems from Colonel Barrett’s letter to be extremely doubtful -wliffther any blocade of the Hasa Ports could be really effective unless it became in A' practice a blockade of the ports from Kuwait down the whole length of the Coast, as it would seem to be practically impossible to control the despatch into the interior of supplies from these ports. Such a blocade would inflict permanent financial loss on Bahrain and alienate the Shaiidi, ana Colonel Barrett has, I thinks rightly estimated its effect on the other Shaikhs on the Coast. Further, ^ing to the ability of the King of Bejd to bring up supplies from his reserves in the in* terior, i t is these Shaikhs ana their people who will be the 1.

M. S. 'TKIAU'*. To The Commander-in-chief, East indies Station* Dated 7th November 1928. No. 41. The Senior Naval Officer has consulted the High Commissioner for Iraq, the Political Resident in tfce Persian Gulf and the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain. g 8 There are two methods of preventing imports into Arabia through Nejd Portsi (a) Prevention of exports from India (b) Blodade of the Nejd ports. All authorities consulted advise that the first of these alternatives would be impolitic. 3. Trade from India to Arabia proceeds, in the main, through three ports: Debai, Bahrain and Kuwait. Bahrain is the distributing centre for Qatif, Ojair and Bohah. It may be accepted as certain that most of the trade for Nejd goes via Bahrain. 4. On the institution of a Blonde with Bahrain as centre and effective control established over vessels making for Qatif, Ojair and Dohah merchants would consider alternative routes through Debai and Kuwait; the latter could be controlled locally with the assistance of the Hoyai Air Porce; goods passing through the former would probably be very costly when delivered in Arabia and as a result the quantities supplied would not be large enough to defeat the purpose of the Blocade. 5. There muld be three main routes by which goods would go into Nejd (a) Dhow from Trucial to Nejd Ports (b) Re-exports from Bahrain to Nejd Ports (c) Smuggling from Persia. This would quite likely be assisted and encouraged by the Persian authorities as retaliation for the amount of smuggling now carried out from Bahrain into Per si a.2 e* The positions of the .Ports for hejd are: C-atif 26 34 H 50 2 E no chart Oj air 25 39 h 50 14 E no chart Do hah 25 17 N 51 32 E Chart unreliable. 7 ,, To enforce an effective blodade the following A would be required; One sloop atationed at .Bahrain One sloop on patrol One slopp as relief.

The ports which His Excellency the High Commission \ -ce in Iraq intended by this term are presumably Jubail, Oat if and Uqair, although the trade of the first named is more with the north than with Hasa itself. it is an artificial creation of Bin tiaud intend.ed to divert trade from. Kuwait. if the hejd trade of Kuwait revived that of Jubail would sink into insignificance. The three ports are mainly served through Bahrain, though each may have a small direct trade with Persia and with other Arab ports. Jubail's trade with Kuwait probably equals that which it carries on with Bahrain. This is due to the settlement in the port of several Kuwaiti merchants, who turn for supplies to their mother town rather than the more proximate Bahrain. rhe proportion of the sea borne trade of the other two ports which doe snot pass through Bail rain must be very small. A reference to the Bahrain Customs House returns ior the year ending 30 th Sep tember 1928 shows that the value of trade with Arabia was Ks. 73,00,000. Of this total, exports amounted to approximately Kw. 63,00,000 and imports Hs. 10 , 00 , 000 . The main items of export aere - (a) Rice ks . 27,00,000 (b) Riece goods « 16^50,000 (cj Sugar « 12,00,000 On the import siae there appear - (a) Ghee •• 3,60 ,000 (bj Dated 3,00,000 (c) Tobacco » 2,28,000 (d) Livestock 56,000 (e) Household goods •* 28,000 [i) Skins .♦ 22,000Tke import of tobacco is mainly from Uman cind its re-export amounting to about its, 50,000 in value is in- cons iderable. The export of sugar, though mail? manifested for Arabia, probably finds its way mainly to non Arab ports. On the other hand the Customs returns make no mention of kerosene oil, as this is shipped by Yusuf Kanoo, agent of the Anglo-Persi an Oil Company, direct from the Company’s steamer to diupws which carry it to the Arab ports without landing at Bahrain. Jr'iece goods and rice are brought from England and Japan via Bombay. Bugar comes from the East and Antwerp largely through Bombay. Both are shipped to the Hasa and to the other Arab ports approximately in the proportion of 2 to 1 . Rice and piece goods are occasionally shipped between Bahrain, Kuwait and Dubai to balance the market, but the total value of such transactions is small. 1 consider it would be a fair rough estimate to value Bahrain’s export to Jubail, Q,atif ana uqair at Rs, 45,00,000 odt of which Rs. 42,00,000 would be staple articles^- of food and clothing. The total imports of the three ports from all sources should approximate ks, 50,000,000. 4* A. blockade of these ports should at first have a considerable effect on the Bedouins living in the east ern districts of Bejd, who would find their wonted supplies of rice and cloth cut off. The effect woula however be considerably mitigated if, as i believe, there are reserves in store on the mainland. Bahrain itself is overstocked with rice and prices are very low. If the Hasa blockade were(long continued I anti cipate that Kuwait,and even Iraq merchants, woula see an opportunity for enriching themselves that they could not resist. in addition to Dubai and Abu Dhabi about which 1 have no details , Dohah and Wakrah under C^atar would derive considerable benefit at the expense of Bahrain.5. - 3 - K The takings of the Dohah Customs House at 5% ad valorem, amount to about Rs. 1 , 20,000 annually. rhe total value of goods imported should therefoi’e be Rs. 24,u0,000. The other small ports of Qatar would bring the total to Rs, 25,00,000. As the Qatar peninsula contains a very small population a considerable quantity ci these inraorts must find its way to Hasa and the border tribes such as the AHL MUKKAH, who now obey iiin jiiawi. 1 am informed that a monthly caravaA leaves Dohah for Hofuf. l have as yet been able to get no estimate of the amount and nature of the goods imported into Hasa by this route. What eve I'jthe quantity may be, a very considerable increase may be expected if the direct route, via the Hasa ports, v^ere cut off. in order effectively to blockade Hasa it would be necessary therefore to include ps supervision over Qqtar, and probably over Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in the organisation. The merchandise from Dubai would probably go to Abu Dhabi by dhow owing to the difficulties and length of the land route. The blockade would deal a very severe blow at the main trade of Bahrain, which, excluding pearls, is in rice and piece goods. This trade is still vei'y largely in the hands of Sindhi Banniahs, who would thus be the chief suiferers financially. The order of exclusion of Hindus from Qatif, which apx)ears/to be imperfectly enforced, as 1 was two Banniahs in Qatif during my recent visit, has favoured the Arab and especially the nejdi merchant; at the expense of the Hindus, but the main portion of the import of rice and piece goods into Q^tif and Uqair still passes through their hands. The trade between Bahrain and .Tubail seems to be largely in the hands of Abdul Aziz Qusaibi and Company, who are Bin Baud’s agents in Bahrain, 7 * ,rhe Bali rain is both Sunni#' and Shiah, who depend on the pearl fisheries for their livelihood would not be very badly hit by the blockade, but it might have the effect4 of driving out the hannialis » ’ihese men have no permanent stake in the islands. If they saw their trade suffering they might move en bloc to Dubai in the hope of carrying on operations from there, as Shaikh Abdullah will mot admit them to Qatar. if once established in Dubai, many of them might prefer to remain there rather than make a second move. Their presence might divert to Dubai a portion of the trade now coming to Bahrain and thus give a fillip to a tendency^ already discernible, of the qatar ports to receive their goods via Dubai instead of by the Bahrain route. i estimate that the blockade of the hasa ports would bring an immediate less of Customs revenue amounting to rapees two lakhs out of an annual income of rupees ten lakhs accruing to the Bahrain State from this source. If one effect of the blockade were to be the diversion of trade, to however small an e_xtent, to other ports the injury done to the State would be permanent. This in itself would antagonise the ruling family, who are dependent on the state revenues for their livdihood. 99 The large Shiah population whose interests are mainly confined to pearl Sing and date growing and who have no reason to be grateful for Wahabi rule, owing to its treat ment of their co-religionists in Hasa and Qatif, would pro bably be passive. They might even welcome bad relations between Bahrain and hejd. Their Sunni confreres, although suffering little economically would be drawn towards nejd by religious tie* Yusuf Kanoo an influential man among them, would be an actual sufferer from the blockade. ” Bin Baud, although disliked by many and frared toy more, is the one big Arab of Arabia* As such, when opposed to foreigners, he makes4. strong call on the national and religious feelings of the Gulf Arab.

Ibn Sa'ud apparently ur L ed that he at the present moment negotiating with His Majesty’s Government and tliat any riding now would greatly damage his chances of bringing the negotiations to a aatis« factory conclusion. If he failed to do so,it would be a different matter and he would then be with them, and he hoped to know one /fay or the other by the end of Raaadhan.

He had not disclosed this point in Riyadh either, but had talked openly about the Desert Posts, King, Faisal’s Intrigues etc., se if to give the idea that he was going, to attack Iraq, There was little doubt however tha$ his real intention was to try and bring Ibn Humald into subjection. Ibn Humald was then in camp between Zllfi and Buraidah and had eleven standards with him. It was thought that his inten- tlon was to raid Salman by way of Lfnah, and that Firm, who was then at Ajiobah, was to &amp;© with him.

Lastly Minister for Foreign Affairs added that if H.K.G. wished to put an end to difficulty they should institute the Blockade. Bin Baud on his part can inflict no effective punishment if those under influence of Kuwait dont do their share. I am sending Arabic copy letter in question to Baghdad, Kuwait for examination.

Bin Bauds arguments specious but incorrect. Of course recent rebellion was biggest concerted effort yet made break his power. As regards Bin Bauds three requests - -—— First seems quite unnecessary as Sheikh has undertaken expell rebels himself, failing which he prepared ask for immediate help from R.A.F. Second strikes me as very high handed request. Sheikh has gone out of his way meet Bin Baud only yesterday he again categorically assured me that rebels forbidden set foot across border much less could they send for supplies, nor could townspeople send out anything, as only gate available under strict guard. Sheikh suggests following possible source leakage. B. S', h Awazim allies in Kassa and other loyal Akhwan were by B.S&amp; permission purchasing food Kuwait and taking out by boat, sheikh could not guarrantee eventual destination such supplies. Third request will be resisted by Sheikh as Infringing his soverign rights. If there is expelling to be done, he wants R.A.F. not B.S'. to do job. Finally sheikh indignatfej denies all accusations of complicity which he describes as impudent efforts of anti Kuwait propoganda factory. Re greatly regrets his old friend B.S. so ready sieze upon such obviously prejudiced tales as proof.TFLEPRAM. FROf.T Resident Bush ire TO. political powait. Dated 10 /C/ 2 &amp;.

Gulf /COHFIPEBTIAL Copy of letter Bo* S.O. 1031, dated the 13th May 1929, from the Political Secretary to Hie Kxcellency the High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad, to the Secretary to the Political Resident in the .Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge jdnjs receipt of your letter Bo. 144-S., dated the 1st of May 1929, enclosing a copy of letter Bo. 2&amp;0-S., dated the 29th of March 1929, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, which had in advertently been omitted from your letter bo. 103-S., dated the 8 th of April 1929. 2 . Before discussing the question of the attitude of the Shaikh of Kuwait in regard to the Akhwan, His Excellency the Acting High Commissioner desired me to refer to the remark made in the second paragraph of your letter dated the 8 th of April 1929, to the effect that the Political Resident would have appreciated being asked for his own views instead of those of one of his sub ordinate officers. Sir Gilbert Clayton had naturally no intention at any time of asking for the views of a subordinate officer upon any question of principle or policy, and he fears that my letter bo* S.O* 673, dated the 21st Iff March 1989, may habe been misunderstood. The position was this. His Excellency had received from Captain Glubb a report which indicated that the Shaikh of Kuwait’s attitude in respect of the Bajd and Iraq tribes respectively was, to say the least of it, unsatisfactory. It appeared to him that if this report was accurate, it would be necessary to consider measures with a view to inducing the Shaikh of Kuwait to alter his attitude. But before putting forward any suggestions or recommenda tions for (he consideration of His Majesty’s Government ^subject, of course, to consultation with the political Resident; he wished to ascertain how far Captain Gikubb’s accountaccount of the state of affairs was correct* he, therefore, asked that he might be furnished with the opinion of the Political Agent at Kuwait, not as to the policy which should be pursued in the matter, but merely as to whether the Shaikh of Kuwait could give a satis- factory answer to the accusations levelled at him by Captain Glubb. it appeared obvious that the Political Resident would accept the views of the political Agent at Kuwait on this matter and it did not, and still does not, appear to His Excellency that he was taking an unusual course in requesting that, in wiew of the comparative urgency of the matter, the political Agent should be authorised to repeat his opinion to him direct. He regrets that this request of his should have given offence, but desire^ me to point out that had it been found possible to comply with it, he would have receiged Colonel More’s interesting and valuable letter of the 29th March early in April, instead of only on the 8 th May. 3 , His Excellency, when forwarding Captain Glubb’s report, realised that Captain Glubb’s information came from biased sources, and for that very reason was anxious to submit it to the criticism of the political Resident and the Political Officer, Kuwait. He would, in fact, have preferred not to have forwarded the report in original, but to have sent the gist of it to the political Resident couched in more moderate language. The report was, however, received in his Secretariat on mail day and as the question was urgent, it was forwarded in original as received. 4 . sir Gilbert Clayton has read with interest Colonel More’s letter of the 29th March which sets forth the Shaikh’s position very clearly. At the same time it does not offer a very satisfactory explanation of ibn Subah’s attitude in regard to the raid on the Hani Malik. On the 1st of March, Colonel More telegraphed asking for an4 - 3 - an escort to enable the hani Malik to rejoin the * Iraq/ tribes in northern Kuwait territory and stating that, pending a reply, he had asked the Shaikh kk to let them remain at Kuwait and to make the best possible arrange ments for thei r protection . In view of this request. His Excellency assumed that the Bani Malik would be safe from attack for a short time. It appears, however, both from Captain Glubb*# report and from Colonel More*s own account of the incident, that the Shaikh made no serious effort to protect the Bani Malik, who were massacrec within a few jnsard: yards of the walls of Kuwait without any attempt being made to render them assistance. The Bani Malik raid,is, however, a tiling of the past and recriminations levelled at the Shaikh of Kuwait are unlikely to lead to any useful result. The point that His Excellency wished to consider was, how far the policy which the Shaikh of Kuwait had adopted to his own interests was inimical to the interests, in Iraq, of His Majesty^ Government, and whether it was necessary to take steps to induce him to alter that policy. 5. The whole situation has now been changed by the defeat of the Akhwan by ibn Saud and by the fact that the Shaikh of Kwv/ait appears to be taking steps to adopt the policy suggested in the Political Resident's telegram of March 26th and to prevent recalcitrant najd tribes from taking asiilto in Kuwait territory. whether the Shaikh of Kuwait is to be pressed, and perhaps assisted by His Majesty’s Government, to adopt a firmer line in his dealings with the Akhwan appears to depend entirely the upon/measure of success which attends the efforts, which he is now reported to be making, to keep them •ut of Kuwait territory. The report tnat ibn Mashhur, while inpossession of a lafcge amount of loot taken from Iraq and iiajd tribes, was allowed not only to encamp in Kuwait territory but actually to occupy the famous fort*» 4 *® A fort at Jabrah, is disquieting and it appears not improbable that the Shaikh’s efforts to prevent the Ajman from encamping in his terrdtory will be unsuccessful. Should Ibn Mashhur and the Ajman remain in Kuwait territory in spite of the reported efforts of ibn Subah to dislodge them,,it appears probable that further siseps will have to be taken, and it is not unlikely that a request for action of some sort may be received from Ibn Baud himself. 6 . a copy of this letter is being sent to the Government of India and to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

M present I do not recommend that we should force our control of exports on unwilling Sheikh, but I am directing political Agent quietly to examine question. In spite of sweet words there is no doubt that Sheikh Kuwait dislikes Bin Baud whom he regards as ungrateful for help accorded in days of his poverty, and emasoulator of Kuwait by suborning of all tribes on whom ruler as suggested relied for protecting. &gt;e I myself consider it would decidedly detrimental our A interests if force circumstances compel us to acquiesce Bln gaud's troops entering Kuwait territory for any reason whatever, and I think every effort should be made to undertake defence ourselves, pin gaud is alitys seeking opportunities to interfere Gulf principle* openly or secretly, and news that he has with permission K.M.G. invaded Kuwait territory, because we were too weak to protect it would have extremely bad effect on our position throughout Gulf.

Please quietly examine and report on question smuggling from Kuwait, and on force which Sheikh can raise to protect his own frontiers.

Dated the 17th June 1929. from / Lieutenant-colonel H.BeF.T)ickson,C el.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Eon 9 hie the Political Besilent in the Persian Gulf, lushire* Subject:- Smuggling of supplies from Kuwait to AJm&amp;n, and Xhn Mashur # s rebels at Vafrah. Sir, I hare the honour to refer you to your telegram Eo.5 39 dated 13th June 1929 in which you reguested me to (a) examine and report on the question of smuggling (b) submit a report on the force His Excellency the Buler could raise for the protection of his frontier. 2. Smuggling (a). In dealing with this question, it should be realized from the start that in Kuwait, there are many AJmam, Mutair^, Awasim as well as other tribal elements who hare many years ago settled in the Town, and who are to-day registered and looked upon as 'Hathar* as opposed to their nomad brethren the ”ledu N . lost of these earn their llrlng by Pearl diving, and except for the old men, women and boys, all go out to the Banks by the middle of May and do not return till September. All are under the direct control of the Sheikh of Kuwait. 3. Those left behind, le^ve the precincts of the city and go into camp round the wells situated Just outside the city walls, forming small settlement du- ring th« 8UBiiB.r. T h ey 40 this, (a) because It is cooler than In the Town (b) to avoid buying water which is costly inin aummer. (c) in order to graae their sheep and goats within safe distance of the Town. (ct) '7c? ^ ^7 } 4. Other settlements inhahited similarly hy 'Hathar^ trihesmen exist in the shape of the villages scattered along the coast to the south of Kuwait* 5. The next point to note is that the 'Hathar* elements mentioned ahove as well as the richer mer chants and members of the Ruler's family, keep camels. Prom Kay onwards (the Diving Season) these are sent out to Bedouin relatives, camped about Jahara, or more often further south to the Hassa border. 6. The point I wish to bring out here is that the tribal 'Hathari** sends out his camels to be looked after, each year, by his tribal brethren^ who are paid hire for the purpose. It is impossible for the Ruler to stop this old established custom, firstly because no men are left to look after the camels, and secondly the gracing in summer is far Inland. Nor can the Ruler stop the formation of the small camps outside the city walls as goats and sheep must grase. 7. It is a well knov,n fact that the Bedouin tribes always keep in close touch with their “Hathar' con nections of the Town and villages, end normally do their shopping through them, should there be an embargo against supplies leaving the Town. 8. The way it is usually done, is as follows, and both the AJman and Awasim are experts at the game. A message comes in^say to an Ajman Hatharl,camped outside the walls, or living in a neighbouring village, asking him to send out 50 bags of rice. The latter does not go into the city to buy, but simply passes the word round, and each tent supplies one or two bags. The whole is then sent out under cover of darkness into the desert. No names areare nn&amp;ntiona4 # no Ajmi is seen, &amp;M no Ajmpn camels put In an appearance, a few donkeys or firewood camels do the needful. The inmates of the rarious tents are not eyen paid, and they normally replace their supplies when they next enter the Town to sell their wool and ghi. They are entitled to hare their own supplies - they must 11vet 9. 1 have somewhat at length described the common method by which the Bedouin can get supplies if there be a strlc t lolockade against him. And if these is any smuggling going on to-day, it, is probably by this means. The Sheikh of Kuwait, is I am firmly convinced faithfully keeping to his promise not to allow sup plies to go out to the 'fafrah* rebels, but leakage of the kind mentioned above is practically impossible to stoB. He can and does control open buying in the market, but he cannot be expected to besiege his own Town, call in his villages and force shepherds to bring their flocks into the town where they would starve, 10. As a matter of fact, I myself believe that littli actual smuggling is going on now, .yrom careful en quiries it would seem that all the supplies that the AJman required, were taken out of the town long before the Ruler was asked to prohibit the export of supplies. There is evidence also to shew that when Ibn Mashur came to Jahara, it was not to take refuge but to secretly purchase all he required for his coming struggle against Ibn Ha^d* This he did# 11. The sympathies of the people of Kuwait are of course entirely with the Ajman to-day. They look upon this tribe as belonging to Kuwait. And blood is thicker than water. This is a very important point when considering the stoppage of supplies. 12. One final point. Ibn Sa'ud in the last few years, has by force of arms maintained an extremelyextremely unpopular tlockafee against Kuwalt(xK* ■because the Sfeelkk voult not surrender a portion of Customs) and feas prevented tfee northern tribes of Nejl from visiting Kuvait iDy means of strong parties posted in the binterlsnd* Since the 'battle of Sihilla and the defeat and death of Fatoad bin Jaloui every* thing has changed. Ibn Sa 9 ud has largely lost control, and many of his loyal ikhran are pouring into the tovn in ever increasing numbers, some xii come vith Ibn T&gt;awish , s permission, some such as Harb with Ibn 3 « , ud , s sanction others come by vo ones pcrmiesioa. To-day it in a case of “go an you please**, rnd one cannot blame the people of Kuwait from taking full advantage of the state of affairs. The Sheikh docs not hinder these men coming in, but ns ho emphasised to me he cannot guarantee that the loyal Hutair. for instance, do not supply the Ajtmn round the corner, as soon as they have crossed the border. 13. Kuwait Forces (b) For the purpose of actually watching the frontier to-day, I am of opinion the Sheikh of Kuwait cannot muster more than 400 mounted men, of these some *00 (called fid&amp;wiyeh or Araibdar) are permanently kept at Jahara. If the pearl season were not on, he could possibly raise about 700 men but this is an out side estimate. These must not be confused with the lx* force he could muster for the defence of the Town walls For this latter a 'levee ea masse' would be enforced, am probably 8,000 indifferently armed mem could be raised. These vould be footmen only,«iJii would &amp;an the walls, nothing more. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Dated 9th (received 10th ) June 19 29. 1 think we are bound to meet Ibn hand*8 request either by allowing Ibn Baud to pursue over the frontier or by keeping Mashhur and rebellious Ajman out oi Kuwait. Ab ihey will ourely be a source of trouble in future as were refugees of the Mutair and rharamar in tixe past, it is also in our interest that xtasx they should not be allowed refuge. Presumably the Ruler of Kuwait is unable to hold hia frontier by force unless ass in ted by us, and it 1b also doubtful whether we could now prevent further leakage of supplies, which he lias been furnishing during past few months to rebel Akhwan. Question is whether we should leave Ruler to allow the King's forces to pursue into Kuwait or hold his (Ruler’s ) frontier for him. ihis raiises the whole question of extending our commitments in regard to Kuwait. Situation has been discussed by me with the Air Officer Commanding: we see considerable difficulty in adequately protecting Iraq as well an frontier with forces at our disposal and at present ti re of year. We should be akwardly placed vis a vis bin l aud if we fail to discharge die responsibility undertaken by us in full measure. On the whole it appears that the best course is to agree to bin i aud’s pursuing across Kuwait border if the Ruler oi Kuwait is unable to keep out rebel tribesmen and to undertake only to prevent them from enter* ing Iraq. It xt obviously unde Arable to agree to Hin w/Suad*s forces entering Iraq proper, but it might be permitted to both arties to pursue into neutral zone, which is likely pkace for refugees: this would con siderably lighten task of H.A.k# but would require the be urged and assisted also to form a force for the protection of his nut own country both now and hereafter, although control of any kxiqpdae leakage of supplies from Kuwait is first essential.

His Majesty will appreciate however, that there would,in any case, have been serious politcal objections to such a course. As regards other points^ you should inform Bin Saud that Sheikh indignantly denies allegations and suggests that possible source of leakage of supplies is Bin Saudis Awazim allies in Hasa and lojal Akhwan who purchase food in Kuwait with Bin Saudis permission,and remove (it ? ) by sea.

Political Agent, Kuwait, British Agent, Jeddah. Dated and received 22nd June 1929. As intimated in my telegram No. 299 (? 199) of 18th June and Foreign Officer telegram to British Agent Jeddah, repeated to you under No. 198, His Majesty # s Government recognise their obligation to assist Ibn Saud by co-operating with the Shaikh of Kuwait in preventing the improper use of the latter's territory by Nejdi refugees. In discharging that obligation they are prepared to auth- -oris© you in the event of Faisal ad Dawlsh's entry into Kuwait territory, to take action a gainst him as proposed in your telegram No. 237. His Majesty's Government consider however that the frontier should not be crossed except in hot pursuit and unless contact has been maintain- -ed with the raiders. They could not agree to aero- -planes crossing the frontier merely to search for rebels or to initiate operations in Nejd,as appears to be con- -templated in your telegram No. 242. In any event it appears very undesirable that ground forces should exist on the frontier. From your telegram No. 239 I note that air action is not proposed unless either aircraft are fired upon or rebels are definitely located. I agree that these conditions should be strictly observed and that every precaution should be taken to ensure against any possibility of air actionbeing taken against innocent tribesmen. To this I attach the greatest importance. You should request Air Officer Gommanding to instruct officers concerned to exercise every precaution and in no circumstances to attack rebels unless they are defin- -itely identified as such. &gt;&gt;f S. for Colonies,Tel3 gram p. ■ ICl yrom ~ B©Piti©nti at Kuwait.

He claims that in addition to aid granted to Bin g*ud by the lata sheiich j^ubara^he himself loaned sixty thousand dollars end sent fifteen hundred bags of rice to fciisist Bin S ud during the siege of Kail. The money has never been repaid and instead of showing gratitude for favours received Bin Baud first rendered Kuwait defenceless by obtaining, with the help apparently of Sir peroy cox, transfer of allegianoe of its tribes, then bloo&amp;aded the town anti ruined its trade for the s ft ke of a difference about Customs which could have oeen adjusted without difficulty. He now calls on the Btate which he lias bereft of its strength and ruined financially to repel from its frontiers its own subjects whom he first seduced from their allegiance and then by hir treachery goaded to rebellion. ShaiKh Ahmad cons iders that the attacks on Kuwait during 1927/29 were all mode by direct order of Bin saud. Shaikh says th fe t If left to his own devices he would not assist malcontents with arms but he would certainly not work against interests of his own merchants by forbidding export of food in exchange for money. While holding these sentiments Shaikh considers tnat he is bound in honour to carry out British policy conse quently he has forbidden the rebel to enter his territoryand iiap prohibited, trade with theai, X reoooiaiend that I nay be authoriaed to inform the Shaikh that if he aota in loyal oo-operation with Hi® HaJe^ty *b Government at the prepent junotore they will msice every effort to peoure for him an honourable Bettie- the ment with Bin Baud of Ixkx dispute, whereby the merchants of Kuwait may be enable to resume their former trade with northern Nejd.

Dated the 1st July 1929. To The Hon*hie the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Memorandum In continuation of my telegram No.405 dated the 30th June 1929. The following points of interest are submitted, in connection with my talk with Faisal al-Shihlan Shaikh of the Jihlan section of the Mutair. (a). Shaikh # Faisal I found to he a tall, dark man aged about 45 years, fie wore the large white Akhwan Turhan over a red Kaffiyah. He was friendly, shook hands cordially, and generally was the reverse of the fanatic. (h). His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad told me Faisal was one of the 'cream' of the Mutair as regards family &amp;n&lt;i was connected with the 'Dushan' family of Faisal al-nuwish. (c) . According to Shaikh Ahmad, he Faisal al-Shihlan is the right hand man or wazir of al-Duwish today, fie accompanied Abdul Afciz al-nuwish (Assaiyiss) in the capa city of Adviser. (d) . In the course of my conversation Faisal al-Shihlan stated:- (i)that they, the Akhwan were out a gains* Bin Saud because he was trying to restrict the Bedouins’ freedom to an unheard of extent. (ti)That Bin Saud had filled them with Religious Zeal and preached that all infidels were fair game, and the • a 'Sheria' was the only law. But when they interpreted the former literallv.2 literally; Bin Saud had rounded on them and punished them, and when they asked that their differences ( i.e* that 'between the Akhwan and Bin Baud) he settled hy M 8heria Law**, he Bin Saud had treacherously attacked them. (iii) That al-T&gt;uwish*s plans were all going well, and they had heard definitely that the Ataiha had started active operations in the Heja&amp; which was what they had been waiting for. (iv) That al-nuwish was anxious to camp at Subaihiyeh, purely because the Hassa wells were overcrowded by the many Arabs concentrated in H&amp;ssa today, and no one was at Subaihiyeh. (v) That he accepted on behalf of al- Tnxwish, Governments orders not to enter Kuwait territory but trusted such order was only to be enforced for the time being, as the Mutair were a Kuwait tribe of old and one of their first acts on recovering their freedom from Bin Saud would be to ask Ibn Subah to take them under his protection once more. (vi) He expected the Braih sections of the Mutair now camped at Hafar would shortly throw in their lot with the Akhwan and join them. That Ibn Busaad was moving to Hafar to try and pre vent this, but if he did not look to himself he would be attacked for interference, (vii) That al-rmwish in his quarrel withwith Bin Saud desired it to he understood that he had no further quarrel with * Iraq or Kuwait and wojLld guarantee that no further raids took place* Bin Saud had deceived them all through in this matter, and having discovered his deceit, they the Akhwan intended to fight him: no longer had they a quarrel with the Hakuma (English)* Whether they were forbidden entry into British protected territories or not, he ai-mi wish would still not quarrel with the w Hakuma H . (e) When I asked Faisal al-Shiblan why the mrbair so persistently attacked ’Iraq the last few years. He replied in these words* 'How could we help it when our grazing grounds and well$had been taken from us and seeing that we were persistently encouraged to do so** • (1)* When I told him that he must definitely understand and convey to Faisal al-wwish Government’s orders forbidding him to cross the Kuwait or ’Iraq boundaries on pain of being bombed, he replied, 'Where is the boundary, we don’t know any boundary, we have never been told anything. If you mean ’Iraq or Kuwait tribes we understand, and I tell you they are safe”• (f) * H.E.Shaikh Ahmad informed me that he had given no tents to shelter Azaiziz’s party who had arrived without any impediments. He had however sent them 5 bags of rice, half a bag of sugar, some tea and butter He mentioned this he said lest later he be accused of sending supplies to al-T)uwish* Azaiyiz and his 100 me^ had arrived with no supplies hoping to have found shelter in Kuwait, but as they had not been allowed to enter the city he the Shaikh of Kuwait couldn’t dodo otherwise than sent them some fool. (g) My own opinion is that in spite of the rather hrav© face that Faisal al-Shi*blan was putting on things, he am his master are alarmed at the preparations Bin Saud is making and their sending Assaifcifc to Kuwait was to try and get the Shaikh of Kuwait to use his influence with His Majesty's Government and if possible arrange for the Mutair to he interned in Kuwait much as iA 1914-15 the Ajman who were in rebellion against Bin Baud, were settled at Safwan through the medium of Shaikh Mubarak. ix Lieut-ool. # Political Agent, Kuwait.

B. I* 1C-Confi dentlal . 'C'* The Residenoy, Baghdad, dated 24th Tune, 1929» Sir, I have the honour to request a reference to teleeran Ho. 119 dated the 14th of .Tune, 1929, from the British \gent and Consul at Uddah to the Foreign Office and to suhinit the following observa- tions on the alleg-d ootiTitiae of Faisal, eouein of Naif ibn Huraaid. 2, Kaif ibn Humoid is a pretender to the chief tainship of the » Vtaibah tribe '^hich is at present held by his first cousin Sultaru in 1923 Half and a minor relation Ubaid got into trouble in Na.jd and writh a number of other Najdi tribeamen took refuge in ’Iraq. In 1925 on account of their raids from 'Iraq into Najd all these refugees were removed from the southern desert and brought up into the Dulaim Liws. Since then Saif and Ubaid have been living on a small piece of land not far from 3-unarra to ths. north of Baghdad, 3 0 on the 3rd Tune I received a telegram from the Honourable the Resident at Bushire informing me that lib a id ibn Humaid had arrived in Kuwait from Baghdad The Right Hon*ble Sidney Webb, P.C. , Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, o.-2- Baghdad a few days earlier and had gone on to ’’/afrah with letters for the AJchwan insurgents there,, This report no doubt concerned the sasie man as the Tiddah telegram to which X have referred in the first para graph of this despatch, in which Ubaid was erroneously called Faisal, 4 # From the enquiries which I made I ascertained that, on the strength of a recoromendation given to him by the Royal Diwan, Ubaid ibn Humaid was issued with a travel permit to Kuwait by the Passport Bureau Baghdad on the 23rd May. On the 30th May he arrived in Kuwait and at once went on to Wafrah where, it is reported, he delivered letters to Ibn Mashhur, one of the Najdi insurgents there. Ke returned to Kiuwiit on the 1st June and travelled via Basrah to Baghdad where he arrived on the 3rd Tune. 5. There was therefore strong circumstantial evidence to confirm the suspicions which the Hajd Government had exposed to the British \gent at Tiddah. I accordingly wrote a personal and private letter to King Faisal acquainting him with the reports which had been made concerning his use of Ubaid as a messenger to the insurgent Ha.jd is and asked His Ma jesty to enlighten me as to the real facts. 6. His Majesty’s reply, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy in translation, provid s an erplmation of TJbaid’s movements which, while it may still leave a suspicion that perhaps the whole truth has\ . I. Sr* &gt; mm has not bs*m told, fits tha facts as thsy are known to us and, in a measure, His Malesty* s story is confirmed by the fact that once previously early in 1927 Ubaid ibn Humaid, at the invitation of Xbn 3a»ud himself went from ’Iraq to Hajd to discuss the possibility of h T aif»s re-assuming the paramountcy of the 1 \taibah tribe* ^aif however in spite of attractive promisee from Ibn Sa’ud, refused the chance and preferred to remain in ’Iraq where he is undoubtedly treated well by the King* 7 e ’Whatever may be the truth the purpose of Ubaid 1 a visit to Wafrah I believe that the King was perturbed by the revelation of my knowledge of his movements and I trust that the publicity which has been given to this incident, may deter him from attempting any form of direct interference in Hajdi tribal affairs. I would suggest that this matter be allowed to drop by His Majesty's \gent in Tiddah, unless the Hijaai minister for Foreign fairs refers to it Again* in which case he might bo given such of the information contained in this despatch and enclosure as His Majesty’s ^gent in Tiddah may deem suitable and sufficient. 3 . i sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's \gent and Consul, Tiddah.

No. 16 ^Yao The Royal Court, The Diwan, Baghdad, 20th Tune, 1929 Bear Sir Gilbert, I thank Your ^xoollancy for your private and personal letter which you have so kindly sent to me on the 16th Tuna and in which you allude to the recent protest hy ion Sa'ud. Your excellency may feel personally assured and may assure His Majesty Xhn Sa’ud that it has never occurred to me to under take any action against him at present, in the same way as 1 had done nothing of the sort at the most critical time for him when he was confronted with the greatest trouble such as that with Ibn Hmid and the Danish. X believe that the report which has reached Ibn Sa'ud is distorted and exaggerated, and it is Important that I should acquaint you with the course of events in order to allay all doubts. Shaikh Naif ibn Hamid, who is the legal heir to the Sheikhdom of the • Uaibah Tribe, came to Baghdad 6 years ago, ■ought refuge with us and has been in -Iraq since then. He was compelled to emigrate from hie country owing to the oppression he was subjected to by hi. cousin Sultan ibn Bujad who had usurped hie Shaikhdom with the assistance of His iiajesty Ibn Sa'ud. t month or more ago Shaikh Naif received a telegraphic message emanating from Kuwait and signed by laq'ad U-Duhainah. asking him to go over to Kuwait to see him. following the receipt of this telegram Shaikh Naif came to me and asked for my advice in the matter. I told him in reply that, while not desirous of interfering in such matters and of bringing pressure to bear upon his personal liberty after the disappearance of his antaronist (rivall\ m (riyal ?)in a case relating to the recovery of a right which he had lost, I did not consider it advisable, having regard to recerfc events in Najd, that he should proceed forthwith before receiving sufficient details and ascertaining the true facts about the situation^ In pursuance of this (advice) he decided to send a person on his behalf to ascertain facts from the sender of the telegram* He eventually sent »Ubaid ibn Hamid(or Humaiyid),one of his followers and family connections. did not know at the time that the sender of the telegram was with Ibn Uashhur, as it never occurred to any body that Ibn Mashhur would remain a rebel against His Majesty Ibn Sa'ud after the latter’s great victory over his opponents. ’Ubaid went to Kuwait and it was there that he came to know that Uaq’ad was with Ibn Maenhuro Having*already suffered the fatigues of the journey to Kuwait, ’Ubaid saw no objection to his proceeding by car, just as any other person and without any secrecy, to meet haq* ad. On return from his journey ’Ubaid told Naif that the latter’s tribe were awaiting him. %en Naif reported the news to me I told him that I was prepared to give him an opportunity (or leave) to return to his tribe, as I could not see that I had any right to restrict the liberty of a guest of mine, but that I considered his departure in the existing circumstances to be prejudicial to my interests, for if I allowed him to go I must bestow upon him such mark of honour as was due to him in accordance with \rab customs, which, if done, might be interpreted by the other party in a manner inconsistent with the original intention, while if I let him go without such mark of honour it would be derogatory to ray position and his in the eyes of \rab tribes. In view of these considera tions and as I wish to aWoid anything calculated to give rise to ■* misunderstanding, i•3- mlsundsrstmding, I advised Saif to deolins their (his tribes ?) invitation temporarily until the situation has stabilised end the atmosphere is cleared up, adding that he might, if he so wished, send a messenger to them to infora them of the facts of the case and that he (Naif) has, of his own choice and in order not to lose his position among the tribes, declined to go over for the time being« Shaikh Naif accepted my advice and resolved to remain in ’Iraq with his people in the vicinity of Samar rahc Such are the facts of the case which I give in detail above (or in advance) in order that Your Ixcellancy may learn how the case progressed.

Reference your letters Bos. 406 and 412, dated 1st and 7th July respectively. 1 do not consider that Shaikh Ahmad has the force of character ever to fill the role of his grandfather Mubarak, which Faisal bin Dawish, for his own temporary convenience, in trying to persuade him to adopt. Shaikh Ahmad appears to be tempted but he must realise his own shortcomings and the fact tint he would be a mere puppet in the hands of the astute Faisal. In his own interest he should be unwavering in his loyalty to the policy of co-operation with his Majesty*s Wcc Government which he has adopted. Gifts o:^sugar and tea such as he made to Abdul Aziz as reported in your letter , Bo. 406 of the 1st July 19 29, appear to be misplaced. They are so small that they will do nothing to secxire Mutair friendship, whilC- they are Sure to be reported to Bin Saud as further examples of Kuwait double-dealing. 1/t • -Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.His Majesty’s Agent and Consul at Jedda presents his compliments to the Political Agent, Honeit, and has the honour to transmit to him the undermentioned documents.

Specifically, the correspondence concerns hostilities between the forces of Ibn Sa'ud and the Ikhwan during the rebellion led by Faisal al-Duwaish [Faysal al-Duwaysh], a conference of Nejd tribal chiefs that was held in Riyadh by Ibn Sa'ud, and Ikhwan raids into Southern Iraq.Much of this correspondence is between British officials at the Political Agency in Kuwait, the Political Residency in Bushire and the High Commission in Iraq, but the file also contains copies of correspondence, in Arabic with English translations, that were sent by al-Duwaish to the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber, in which al-Duwaish offered leadership of the Ikhwan to Shaikh Ahmad (folios 208-212).It also contains an account of a visit made by al-Duwaish and other Ikhwan leaders to Kuwait in July 1929 in which they proposed an alliance with the British Government against Ibn Sa'ud (folios 262-267).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Ikhwan revolt (1927-1930)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003ba#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
