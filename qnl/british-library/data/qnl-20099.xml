CQItfiDEtlTUl R£GGilOo^ J B. \7itli reference to your D.O.lTo 407-S dated 14th Nov. 1928, My letter No 132 was written because I gathered from Sir Lionel Haworth,when I met him at Dibba,that the rrhole question of our relations ^-ith the Arab side of the Persian Gulf was now under consideration and that the question of a Proteetorate over Oman was being considered.. In fact,in his report No 382-S dated 25th October, Sir Lionel has recommended such a course. What is it we are going to protect ? A. A protectorate which embraces a narrow and vulner able coast line,exposed to raids from the interior, seems to me an unsatisfactory solution to the situat ion. (A) It would not alter our present position in the very least. We are Already under moral obligations to protect this area. (a3) It would not satisfy the Sultan who would not relin quish his shadowy authority over the parts where it still exists, without the greatest reluctance. (C) In the event of the hinterland falling erentually into the hands of tne Wahabis,our position along the coast would become untenable. A protectorate over the portions ^here the Sultan stiU exercises shadowy sway,leaving out the Imams territory, would also seem to me to be unsatisfactory.- We would have added to A. the most difficult and wildest partsof the country , inhabited for tne raost . art by nomads .and ^ould not hare the assistance of the settled, and most amenable portion of the population,-who are nearly all under the s^ay of ihe Imam, in dealing with them. There is also the possibility of future trouble with the Imam. It seems to me tiiat,if a protectorate as to be decl ared, the inclusion of the Imams territory in tie Sultan ate is a necessary preliminary. Looking at tne subject from a military point of view, if we are to protect Muscat from any future invasion oy 'vahabis, this will have to be done at Baraimi. Baraimi is really me icey to Oman in the north. Its possession would enable the Wahabis not only to invade Oman,but also to raid the Batinah coast and the Trucial coast with impunity. Any protective measures we undertook would have to be concentrated at that place and not spread all over txie country. Inter tribal feuds and skirmishes occur constantly and. it would oe almost impossible to check t iem except oy inducing the parties to brin^ tneir cases before t Council for adjudication. It rras trie refusal of Saiyid Faisal to take the trouble to adjudicate in such disputes and tke consequent lacit of any impartial authority oeiore whom they could be brought.which ^as the main cause of the rebellions of 1895 and 1913,and which led to trie eettin fc up of another Imam in the interior. I have gathered from a study of former rebellions, tnat prior to 1913,the: were engineered invariably for the purpose of placing another member of-th^Sultan's family on the throne. Prior to that date,there doe^ not appear to have been any idea of forming a separate state. Many of these rebellions,including that of 1895,n V A\«A appear to have been engineered frem Zanzibar,wher^fthe Harth tribe,to wkicii Sheikn Isa bin Sale i belongs, is particularly strong. Until 1912,rebellions failed, owin^ to tne rapid rally of tlie Giiafiri tribes to the succour of the Sultan. Except for the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Rasib, in Jaalan,the Ghafiri tribes are not Wanabi. I doubt whether they would, welcome Ibn Saud or call for his assistance unless they are grossly mishandlesi. Any inclination on their part to join hands with the Bani Bu Ali is probably due to the fact that Isa bin Saleh is the Sheikh of a Hinawi tribe. Possibly the Ghafiris feel that a puppet Imam in his hands is not a sufficiently impartial tribunal before which they can take their disputes. The weakness of the Muscat Gorernment is due in a l^r^e measure, to Isa^ rebellion and his formation of a fresh statej including tie valuable Semail valley, which was actually pro-Sultan but which Isa succeeded in including in his area. This has un ermined the prestige of trie state. Isa himself is a strong man. He has several strong men in his administration. Their inclusion in the Muscat Council would,I think,strengthen it considerably. If we really wanted to rally the SJieiklis of the vari ous trihee to the Muscat Government,I do not think that it wouli be a difficult matter. It could be done at the price of a little entertaining and small presents, muscat cannot afford to do this at present.and it is the absence of such entertaining which has alienated the Sheikhs from ,he present Sultan. Please see my report No C.SO dated 12th Nov.1927. This report is long and somewhat cumbersome as I deemed it necessary,being some what new to the post at the time,and writinr to a — i iResident who had himself served here,to quote chapter and verse for all my stateirients{but it covers a consider able portion of the factors which will have to be consider ered if a protectorate is contemplated. It seems to me that the present state of the country is due to the absence of any authority and not to any natural propensity towards fijitin^ on the part of the population. On the whole,the Omanis are not warlike and it is really surprising how peaceful the country is considering the lack of control everywhere. I realize the matter will have to be examined fully in detail by someone in higher authority before it could be considered by H.M.Govt. but I think the question of inclusion or exclusion of Isa bin Saleh ! s territory should be decided before the declaration of any protec- orate. When once he was assured against attack from Ibn Saud, there would be no inducement for him to join. Our task of consolidating the state would be more diffi cult, also, without his assistance. I do not anticipate an immediate aggression on the part of Ibn Saud and the idea of Akwan raids did not emanate from this office, as I pointed out in my D.O. No. 152 dated ^Ist November. All I anticipated was a gradual undermining of authority through Tahabi machina tions ''hich might lead to a local conflagration in which the country ^ould become exhausted and an easy prey to subsequent annexation by Ion Saud^The suggestion put forward in my letter No. 132 was not intended as a solu tion of the Sur question which I think -ill have to be decided first. Since you have asked me to express my vie^s fully^I think it necessary to point out that I do not a^ree with the view that the Sultans of Muscat maintained their authority in Sur by playing off the Bani bu Ali and the)t1 . 1 1*. xttvJ it-sk-* \ ' a (£■ sumq^ Jenebeh against each other. I can find nothing to support this vie^ in the records, in fact para. 35 of my General Rejjort on Sur (^0.115 of 10th October) and para. 28(3/(add enda ) ^ould point to the fact that the Muscat Government ^ere anxious to prevent • ny interference by the Bani bu Ali, who are primarily a tribe of the interior, in Sur affairs. Para.58 of the same report also sho^s that X Abdulla bin Salim only intervened in the dispute at a very late sta^e, and did not attempt to interfere in it locally Thomas had an idea that it ^as possible to play off the Bani bu Ali against the Jenebeh, and tried to do so with disastrous results. I think it was a most dangerous policy to have attempted and it had not the support either of the Sultan or the Council of Ministers. As regards placing a regiment at Sur for t^o years, I a-ree that if the State do nothing'to put their house in order in that place in that time, it would lapse to its previous state as soon as w e departed. The pro posal contained in my general report IT0.115 dated 10th qotal (. r ' T as one '^hich, I was ^ell aware, Government would carry out with the greatest reluctance. At the same time it seemed to me the sole solution. Stationing a regiment at Sur for two years ''■oulvl, I think, be sufficient to enable Muscat to rat the administration of the place in order and to eradicate the influence of the Bani bu Ali Amirs. After this a levy corps of 100 men should be sufficient to keep the place in order. They would not be sufficient to meet a deter mined attack by the Bani bu Ali of the interior (the Bani bu Ali of Sur are insignificant) but I doubt whether the former -ould attack -rhen once they saw -e -ere prepared to send a reciment there. They -ould realize that if their attack; -''ere successful, it -ould mean a reoccupa- tion of the place by us. As I have stated in my report f mquoted above, I have based my vie^s on ''hat- has actually I shall be -lad of the opportunity of having a full discussion with you on the subjecj. The situation at Sur,however,is hardly likely to settle down until some action is taken ^ith regard to the Bani Bu Ali and Ibn Sauds flag. Matters have been allowed to sirrmer for so lon^,that it is almost impossible to say that the patience of the parties T 'ill not become exhausted or that further develppments will not ensue. happened at Muscat.

If no decisive step is to 'be expected from various factions in the near future and possibil ity of Wahabi interference is remote, our immediate concern is simply the safeguarding of the financed of Muscat. There seems no doubt we could ensure this if international considerations admit control of sea trade of Sur. Hecent bombardment of Abu Ali^s fort has probably been useful earnest of our intentions; we thinic that except for Political Kesident to watch situation no further action is required at present.

I'] Reference telegram Mo, 2815-8., dated the 14th December 1928 from the Government of India regarding Sur. As pointed out in paragraph 76'of India Office memorandum on Muscat there seems no doubt that main diffi culty in Muscat is financial, caused by five per cent limitation and effective control of Sur will not material*' ly better that financial position. At present Kazis, Askaris public works and other essential public services are starved and Sultan hasnot at his disposal funds necessary to Arab ruler to entertain and maintain relations with Shaikhs and their retinue. His un willingness to associate himself with public affairs may in some degree be attributed to this latter. Consequently situation in Sur would appear to be sy»4^»i of the gradual disintegration of the Muscat State which, in these infectious times, is bound to result Ik from present conditions in State and the only means to prevent its spread would seem to be the actual co-operation in Government of the ruler, whether the present Sultan or his son, with adequate meansfto entertain his subjects. 1 would therefore suggest a serious examination of the question of the removal of the five per cent limitation on customs dues at Muscat. It might be worth wMle giving some temporary assistance to enable the Sultan to recover control .and consolidateconsolidate his power if, by doing so, the btate could 'be put on proper financial and administrative footing. Otherwise any assistance so far from being temporary will only be a commitment leading to further calls if things drift on as at present. - RESIDENT.l^o. ^6/ -S. of 1928.

He summed up the requirements in two words# Power and Money# At the ^ame time,he declared himself a sick nan and stated that the constant worry which he would eyerie nee fron the tribes was more than he was prepared to undertake» He de- -clared his readiness to give over the Government to any one the British Ooverrmient ml-tit select,not necessarily to his St ATTITUDE OF BOlT^ In accordance with the instructions of the Hon^le the -ing him In the course oiT one interview,to change that attitudeBadjid fc&gt;t id and stated t!iat in ease he nsid already made up his mind to return to iiuseat tY /ice more after whicn he pro- -pesed to leave Muscat permanently* he added that of course the British Government could force him to remain in Muscat* I pre- -sume this, remark was Trith reference to the question of his alloYr- ~©nGe:» As I had no wish to allow the comrersation to take a defi- -nite line towards abdication,I did not discuss the question of auch allowance with him. nla Higjaness assured me that he would do all he could to help the administration whilst in Muscat and he eertalnly is taJcing an interest in local affairs at present* His activities include:~ (1) 'Thilst in ±5onbay^ he induced the ireneral i?jlectric Oonpany to send an engineer to work out a scheme for the supply of electadt- -ris li^ht in Muscat and Matralult is hoped to form a company for this purpose,the General Jilectric Company talcing a proportion of the shares and undertaking, the management• (2^ Fie has taken an interest in the improvement of the %msn» Same streets have 'been broadened under the direction of Saiyid Hahmood• 3ome ruined houses have been demolished and a tennis court for Saiyid Said is under construction on their site# (3j he has had ft new pas sports printed for the at ate in booic f enzu (4) he proposes making a tour of the Jsatineh Coast. The Sultan's attitude towards the Arab members of his Council also aeema to have undergone modification,and he does not now regard them as useless hut realizes that they are of material value in carrying out the administration. He contemplates adding to their numbers to make them up to their original strength. The attitude of the interior too is more favourable^SxS it has heen for many years. His Highness the Sultan has received friendly letters recently^for the first time since the rebellion,both from the Imam and from Sheikh Isa 'bin Saleh. I am hopeful that it may be possible to induce the Bui tan to ' undertake the administration at least, for a fen years until Baiyid Said is old enough to be able to assert his authority withoutbeing in the Hands of ©ttiersu It would probably be easier to achieYe this object 'by indireGt rather than by direct methods# It seems possible that by encouraging his activities in local ImjroTements and by increasing his revenuea so that he \ would be in a position to entertain yheikhs and to exercise something more than a nominal authority# his Highness may / become more interested and thereby induced to take control of' affairs. 2» Sur» \7ith the death of the Amir Mahomed bin Haser and in the absence of the Amir Ali bin Abdulla in the Hej5E2 # there is no influential SheiMi of the Bani Bu Ali present with whom nego- -tiations would serve any useful purpose and it Yfill be neeeB^ -ary in any case to postpone any discussion as contemplated in Foreign telegram r?o »3C4-S dated 22nd January 1929 &gt; until towards the end of the year# His Highness considers that if he went to Sur and ordered the Bahi Bu Ali to remove their flag and customs post and cease from interfering In Sur affairs and then was not in &amp; jo sit ion to enforce these demands^he would merely be giving an exhibition of his own weakness# Re is therefore reluctant to undertake any such discussion unless the British Government were ready to support him by placing a sloo]i at his disposal with authority to bombard Alqa should he request them to do so. The late Amir Mahomed bin uaser was a man of considerable personality and his ambitions were at the root of the recent troubles. There is therefore a possibility that his death may relieve the situation at Sur very considerably. 3. mjAmn .

Each year has seen the elimination of all items of public viorks from the budget whilst a diminution of the strength of the Muscat Infantry has had to be carried out in order to make the budget meet# The Sultan has found himself unable to entertain Sheikha and keep up friendly intercourse with them as formerly.

This has only 'been made possible 'by (i) vigilant economies in the lean periods including reduction of the original strength of the Muscat Infantry, (ii) redistribution of the .G-overnment of India Loan instalments, (iii) the starvation of public works ( a half lakh could 'be spent with advantage on Government forts up and doi/m the country) (iv) the institutior of a Dhow Hegistration Tax, (v) closer supervision of Customs revenues, and (vij alssorption 'fey the Central Treasury of Shamailiyah Zakat and customs administration.t The general economic condition of the country has not improved during this period. The reason for this is that Oman's primary source of wealth, its date crop, has declined as a result of failing rains during the past 15 years in the Interior. Drought conditions have led to sporadic emigration from the 3harq.iyah province, the chief sufferer, to the Batinah and to Zanzibar. The middle HaJar has suffered to a smaller extent while the Ja'alan and the Batinah seem to have 'feeen little affected. Other lesser iactors, through these are largely common to neighbours, are (i) a fall in the value of the country's produce since the war years: (ii) a fall, in sympathy with the silver market, of the value of the Maria Theresa Dollar, Oman's principal currency, and (iii) depressed condition in recent years of the pearl industry at-Dibai and Bahrain-this reacts on the Batinah 'because DiTiai and Bahrain besides providing a livelihood for some 400 Batinah divers constitut&lt; uhe chie^. markets for Batinah wet dates and firewood. The complaint of luscat and Tatrah merchants that the people of Shumailiyah and Batinah are not 'buying their wants from Muscat, 'but from DiMi because the iatter is a customs free port is not entirely correct: it may largely l5e accounted for 'by a natural process of exchange. But while merchant and cultivator is alike less well off than he has 'teee^ the present 5;: advalorem customs duties plus a light Zakat cannot be considered to bear oppressively on him, or place a limit to the State's taxable capacity. Any desirable reforms demanding a flourishing exchequer are conditioned by increasing State revenues. The expenditure side of the Budget is inelastic. Its scale and scope drawn up in 1922 had relation to a dollar exchange of Fs 200/ as against : 123/ today, and leave no margin to provide the Sultam with means to spend on a Shaikh's ^uest house, or by doucpnyc? nr^ + • &gt; uuuceurs and entertainment toto attract .powerful tribal personages from the remoter parts of the : such expenditure would l^e a first charge on the means of the r .uler of an Aral? State run on traditional lines. Any reorientation of policy in this direction thus involyes the increasing of revenues, and the State's only means of doing this would appear to 'be 'by increasing customs duties. Higher Customs duties, if authorised, can lie collected, though some preliminary discontent is inevitable. Any increase in the cost of living, however small, will naturally 'be unpopular with the general puMic, 'but this feeling should disappear with familiarity. Two other sources of opposition-YJithout considering Sur which has a century's reputation and practise of evasion^should however 'be anticipated. (i) 'Isa 'bin Salih (Sharqiyah) (ii)Tal Sa'ad tribe (Batinah) The Sultafci considers the difficulties would not be insurmountable for two reasons (a) both parties having suffered in recent times at the hands of British Imperial forces are not expected to persist in obstructing a measure which they would know has only been made possible by a revision of the 1891 Treaty, with its implication of British Government assent, and (b) means would avail for placating such opposition, if not of forestalling it. Mr. G. IToel Bower (Imperial Customs Service) sent to Muscat on deputation from the Government of India in larch of 1925 for the purpose of examining the State's Customs Department, addressed himself in his Report to the question of the revision of the Staters advolarem duties. He thBrein expressed three alternative views i against an increase (a) on the hypothesis that it is possible that imports would show a falling off to such an extent that no extra duty would be realised.' (b) on political grounds. ii an increase of l-^to 6:^ (plus alcohal andalcohal and cigarettes tas of 15^) iii An increase of 2i% to 7j&gt;% (-do- -do- As regards (i) Mr. Bower's apprehensions of such a considerable falling off in the value of imports would appear to 'tee unduly pessimistic in the light of a slightly increased tax. As regards his alternatiTes (ii) &lt;5: (iii) 0 - L revision either to a 6-%% or tariff, the former would cause more trouble than it is worth. Any increase will meet with some opposition on principle. To incur o. position for inadequate results is not worth while: and it is only the yield from the 7if- duties which may achieve^even partially^ the desired ends. The result of a 7-|f' duty would I anticipate increase the revenue 'by one lakh and a ouarter of rupees, ¥r. Bower's more liberal e^imate would appear to have 'been 'based on total 'customs' receipts. In arriving at my figure I have taken into consideration two factors representating together nearly a half of the total volume of taxable trade i Qwadur ii Interior exports. As regards (i) I have disregarded Gwadur as perhaps its present tariff had most profitably 'be left unaltered. Gwadur is already virtually a 7j&gt;% port ( State duties of plus Makran duties of 2i% on its 'borders) against other Makran ports having 4f duties, and in view of its size and position a further increase may divert its trade. A small Indian trading ship in 1937 had onlyt© anchor and land its cargoesa few miles up or down the coa^t to circumvent our customs authorities there^ and an application of the increased duty is calculated to encourage similar activities having for their result ends precisely opposite to those desired. As regards (ii) the 5;'' duties on dates and other produce from Interior Oman, whose yield for purposes of administrative convenience has always 'been 'brought to account as customs revenues, are not customs duties in reality, and5 , and would not 'fee liable to the increased tax. Tl:e present tax (there is no wharfage as for legitimate customs transactions) is in reality in lieu of Zakat and the Treaty of 1920 'between the Sultan and the Interior Shaikhs following Shaikh 'Isa 'bin Saleh lays down that this 5 crf shall not 'be exceeded. I have therefore excluded expiort figures, -- customarily lumped together as customs revenue^ from my calculations. The figures which provide the 'basis of incidence for the tax are the actual imports along Oman Sultanate shores from overseas. The proposed additional customs duty represents a yield to the Exchequer of l/40 of the value of such imports» The total value of overseas imports (excluding Gwadur) for 1926-27 was Rs 4905010/ and for 1927-28 Rs 5557149/ which would thus have yielded on the 'basis indicated, an additional revenue of Es 1 ,22 ,575/ and Fr l,38 f 92S/ in those respective years. The proposal of a 7i^ customs duty is calculated therefore directly to increase State revenues 'by alsout li lakhs annual] I have the honour to 'be Sir Tour obedient servant Finance Minister :uscat State- 2 - 4. I wouid therefore ask that the international aspect of the Increase in ouetozas be taken up, as in the event of no additional revenue beinij obtained there seems little doubt that the Muscat rtate will eventual ly shrink into a Musout —llut t ra enclave. 5.

I have the honour to inform Y 0 ur Bxcellency that I reached Aden from Sgypt on my way to home, and that I deem it necessary to submit to you the following Our Amirship continues to be a friend of the Govern ment of His Majesty the Kjng of Great Britain, as was detailed in our petition dated the 10th January 1923: Our friend, therefore, should be your friend, and our enemy your enemy, as was mentioned in a letter of Consul *iajor Grey. We are also friends and Allies of the Sultan of Muscat in accordance with the agreements which were explained by the Government of M u scat in their general 9 proclamation dated the 1338 issued under the signatures of the Sultan and his Minister Captain McColum. We enclose its translation for your perusal. We, in the name of friendship and respect for rights and ^quality^ entertain genuine hope that the British Political Officers will not interfere in our interior^ in connection with the aggression that took place in Jamadi al Awal and the threat made by the Consul, Muscat, to the tribes. We attach herewith a true copy of the warning issued by the Consul. The rights and privileges for our ancestors, ourselves and our tribes, In money, arms, etc. which ij Hi t# )• . m/a 3 were earned by dint of sword have been stopped by the M u sQat Government for the last 16 ye«rrs. One of the conditions was that the Muscat Government has no right to interfere in the Ghafiri country, which is under our control, and if the Muscat Government has inten tions against 3ani G^afir, we have the right to interfere in the matter and to stop the Government at the limit which was agreed upon. And it was customary for our father to receive on demand, from the Sultan of M u scat, monetary pay ments and arms. All these rights have been stopped by the Muscat Government who adopted this policy by trusting in the power of the Government of Britain so as to deprive us of our legal rights and privileges, and to achieve its certain aims and objects, which may produce results that cannot be praised as is not hidden from you. We have firm hope that your Just G 0 vernment will deal with this matter with wisdom and kindness and restore our rights just as they restored the rights of the ifaeem tribes above 3ohar # through His iSxcellency the H e sident Colonel Haworth, and Sayid Hamud bin Hamad, the late Wali of Sur, in accordance with justice and equality. Till the time of Major Haworth and Mr. Wingate, the procedure of the communication between us and the Officers of the British Government was that they reached us direct. This has changed for the last year, and now letters { of British Consul) reach us through the W a li of Sur and the Council of Ministers. Some times they come open and some times they bear an endorsement of the Ministers in red ink. T^is is against the usual custom and our sense of respect does not tolerate that others should come to know of our secrets. We have constantly been asking for the Consul to come to Sur, in accordance with the custom of Sir Percy Cox and Mr. Wingate, who never delayed their meetings in Sur, but the new Consul excuses himself from coming to Sur. whenever we ask him for a pass or a letter of~ljitro^v3 * ' he turns us to the Ministers. We do not know what is his object in doing so. In any case it is impossible for us to submit to the said conditions, as we are separate from the Muscat G 0 vernment and independent in our affairs just like the other Arab Ruling Chiefs• There do not exist between us and the Government of Muscat any relations other than those of friendship and good neighbourhood. We beseech orders of the Government of His Majesty the King of Britain, through you, to the following effect:- That the letters may be sent to us direct according to the old custom. That when circumstances require the presence of the Consul of Muscat to make acquaintance, to discuss important matters and to remove misunderstanding, he should come to us in 3ur as is customary. That agreement be accorded to the passports being issu ed by us to the travellers from our coasts, entered under our Government^ Ai) when they go ou^ without passports, they are put to difficulties and are charged at least Rs,5/- on the coasts of the Italian Somaliland, if they do not hold passportj from us• Por the sake of facilities and as a consideration for our economical interests, we see it rightful for doing so, keeping in view the fact that the Arab Kulers benefit by this procedure, Presently, our passport was endorsed during our this journey, at Aden, Jeddah, jSgypt, Mussawwa, ^tc., just like other Rulers. The permission for ten rifles and 200 rounds (mauser) cannot be sufficient to replenish our Amirship, to defend against the mischief makers and to keep peace and security in the interior. The cause of the trouble is our friendship with the British Government from old and protection of interests of its subjects as it is attributed to us that we are the helpers of the British Government, It is nothing beyond our standing for the requirement of friendship and good neighbour hood.We accompanied the Engineer of the Oil and. Petrol Company in 1926 and we expedited the journey of Mr. Thomas to ^hofar, in addition to their stay. They clamour with displeasure about the flag hoisted 'by us« Sometime they say it is a British flag and some time call it Bin Gaud's flag and similar other mischiefs are made although their efforts are frustrated. We request you to submit for orders of the British Government and to ask them in our name to permit us not less than 300 Mauser rifles with necessary quantity of rounds. On receipt of the permit we are ready to buy them with oufy 1 money^ as it is not possible for us to maintain peace in the country in the present state when we do not possess sufficient quantity of arms. As regards the ammunition which is a deposit for us with the Sultan of Muscat, about 23000 rounds,which we 't ^ purchased with our money in 1331 , we referred to him and asked for delivery. His last reply was that he will deliver to us ammunition in exchange, as the original one was used .him by ap^for his own defence. Is this reply satisfactory that he used it and that one may appropriate the right ©f other for his own interests, but to the harm of the other. We can,howeveremake it easy for him. He may find quantity of ammunition for us. He may pay the value of the last store and the balance will be paid by us. We request you to submit the matter to the Government who may settle the difference in a good way as we have no intentions except peace , conciliation and good neighbour hood. As regards the case of our tiibe Bani Bu Ali who are , - r? entered under nnr rule, pending against the Italian Govern- ment at Makdushoh since 1926, we had submitted it to the late Resident last year and handed over to him a letter of the Italian Agent, and he said that he would take necessary # ^ ste^ato recover the rights of the above mentioned. ll referred to the Italian Consul, A d e n , and he p rolnlsed&gt; 37 f rf ^ S5 The Benign Indian GoYernment had submitted the matter to London in 1926 according to the letter dated 19th October 1928 from the British Consul, Muscat. I request Your Honour to g-ive suitable importance to what we have written and what we may get written through our H e presBntative and favour us with a reply in detail. You should not believe what our enemies may write as it is without any truth# ^e are always ready for good understanding, co-opera tion and conciliation.

Inspite of the fact that at first they sought the British Government to stand as a security and aftefwards they refused. Hence their operation and their usurpation has been fully manifested and this is an i operation which is disapproved by religion and wisdom as well. And by doing so they have gave against the enjoyings up on the | commands of God and strict hidings of his prophet. In punish ment to these oppressors and the persons forming their gang we have issued an order the duties of to be exhausted at the rate of 25 per cent on dried dates and the dates from Umman on — Eastern Countries and 50 per cent on the power gratuties being exported and the issue of this notice and this increase in the : itates of duties is not a permanent one, but it is in return of the operation done by these tyrantsand their co-operators. Therefore we the forewarn.the purchasers of dates dried dates and ptomoganates to take every care and to keep it in view of the time of purchasing these foods from the foresaid sellers and to prepare an account (i.e. of sale arid purchase) according i; to this.

After Compliments» O W ^ With reference to your letter dated the 19 ; th December 1929 with regard to the letter from Ali bin Abdullah, Bheikh of Ban! Bu Ali, to the Hesident who asiced you to acquaint me with its contents, and with reference to my conversation with the Resident on the subject and the Residents request for my opinion with regard to the highhandedness and irregular actions of the Sheiichs of Bani Bu All at Sur and its suburbs# I have already discussed the matter v/ith you and confirmed it by my letter dated the IBth Muharram 1347 (6th July 1928)• I have explained what Tms necessary at the time, but the Government did not pay attention to this important affair. I now repeat my request to my friend the Government to support my State and in addition to what I have already stated I explain the transgressions and audacity of the said people (Bani Bu Ali Sheikhsj at Bur where they have not the least right to do so# As to the remark made by the said Sheikh in hie letter to the Resident about the notice issued by my Wazir in 1358 (1919) to the effect that they were our friends and allies you are aware of the reason which necessitated the issue of that notice# The reason was that I levied a temporary tax on the Omanis, my subjects, who were not obedient to my % X &amp; k Government in order to distunguish between a rebel and a loyal. As to the assistance which you mentioned in your letter to the inhabitants of Sur it was a sort of assistance which I expected.As to his statement about the rights and privelegee enjoyed 'by hie predecessors and himself, I am not aware that he has 'been deprived of any concession or privelege and as far as I know he and his leaders are enjoying them until the present time# He has a salsry which he receives it from the Treasury of lay Government every month and it has not 'been changed up to now* Also when any of hie followers or himself come for our visit they will 'be treated with hospitality as other tribes and Bheilchs^ The said Bheikh has no authority over the other sections of • Bani Ghafir who are settling in the neighbourhood of his country# There are only friendly relations and arrangements between them in connection with their affaire with the Hinawis ■ and others at Ja r alan» The relation of Bani Ghafir tribes at Ja'alau with us is the same as that of Bani Bu Ali and they would 'be treated with hospitality like them* Their status is equal and I do not make any preferance in regard to my orders and hospitality to them and you know the conditions of the tribes among the Arabs. He has remarked that we are relying on the support of the British forces* There is no doubt that we cannot do without it and he and other Bheikhs are aware about it* They undoubtedly know that the support of the British Government to my Htate is only to preserve order and peace* It is not a new thing but it is a favour which was enjoyed by my predecessors and we are enjoying same in our country up to now. He has demanded that in usages and customs he should be treated as the Sheikhs of Haim. I have not changed any usgge concerning the Bani Bu Ali tribe and even we have not treated them as we treat the Maim* He was not satisfied as the SJaim but he acted beyond his and his ancestors* limits at Bur# I undoubtedly do not agree to your corresponding with him direct# The correspondence should be done through the Council of Ministers of my Government if I am not present in the Capital* As regards the endorcenent by the repreeentativee of my3. friend the Government on the Travelling Permits which he wants as he imagines to put it into effect, I do not expect you to recognize and endorse them. You are awrre that Sheikh Isa bin Balih al Harithi and his followers do not travel from Oman without a Passport from the Muscat Government and I do not think that you and the Resident are unaware about these facts. How could these people have any superiority over others in enforcing travelling permits? Letter of introduction can be given to them like other Sheikhs who travel to foreign places* I would like that a letter of introduction may be granted if a Passport is issued by my Government and if you are asked to do so as usual* I will admit that I did not attach the cost of ammunition which was deposited with me and some time ago I ordered the Council of Ministers of my Government to pay it to them, but they themselves did not demand it. It is ready and will be paid by my Government to him as soon as they ask for it. I request you to forward this my letter to His Honour the Resident and I hope that I would be supported in suppressing them and stopping their aggressions. Iliaddition to what I have already stated I will explain their transgressions at Sur. (1) They have levied a tax on caravans and sailing crafts (2) They have erected buildings at Aiqa, a village of fcjur, where they had no such buildings before. They have done so in order to oppose the execution of the orders of ray Government in that part* (3) They had adopted a new flag other than mine and had hoisted it at Aiqa. They attempted to interfere with the traffic and highways and to disturb the peace. All their actions create disturbance and are against the orders of my official at Sur.JKHdt I may add that I have got letters from them in which they admit that they have no right to interfere in the affairs of Sur. They are ready whenever you want to see them.4. I have a sanguine hope that His Honour the Resident and my friend the Government will pay attention to this important matter which nfould result in instigating the other subjects of my Government to rebellion# They will be encouraged if the Government do not support and do not pay due attention to this matter. I have already pointed out in my previous letter that other Sheikhs are looking forward to see how the British Government is going to support my State in suppressing these people* I expert to receive help and assistance as soon as possible* I have already shown you the letters which I received 1rom bur and stated that they intend to force the inhabitants of Sur to submit to their wishes. You will observe that such mischievous action on their })^rt will create disorder in the affairs of my Government* We shall not give them any chance to attain their objects and shall stop their high handed actions at Sun 1 have already repeatedly warned you of the transgressions of tnese people. I am sending herewith a letter which I have received from the sheikhs of Bani Bu Hasan of Ja'alan who are partners oi Bani Bu Ali in Ja'alan so that you may be aware how they are making propaganda among their neighbours and what they intend to carry out in future at Bur** I do not think that my friend the Government consider Ja f alan a separate country from Oman. The history would give evidence that it is under the authority of Muscat* My Government and myself await a favourable answer from the (British) Government* Usual Binding*TratiBlation of a letter dated S9th Jawadl II, 1348 {2nd December 1929) from Sheikhs Hamud bin Humald bin Kashid and Muhamad bin .Amer bin Ali of Bani Bu Hasan to H.H.the Sulten of Muscat cmd Ctean. After Compliments. We beg to inform you that on the 84th instant (27/11/29 the Bani Ghafir held a meeting in the place of Ali bin Abdullah in Bani Bu Ali country. Ali bin Abdullah asked them to sign a paper accepting him as the Amir of Bani Ghafir of Ja'alan and promised to protect their boats at sea ana the subjects (on land). Home of them signed and some are still waiting. It was arranged between them to meet on the Coast of Sur in order to force the four sections of Janabeh to sign as Bani Ghafir did. After completion of their affairs they will submit their representations against you to the British Government* This is the information which we got and it is incumbent upon us to inform and warn you about it.

This did not mean that they were independent of the Oman Govern- ment. You state that your ancient rights and privileges have been stopped by the Muscat Government. His Highness tells me that this is not true, and that your salary is paid to you regularly by the Muscat Gov ernment, also that when you or p^S@ any of your followers visit His Highness you will be treated with hospitality as other Shaikhs and tribesmen. His Highness adds that you have no authority over the other sections of the Beni Ghafir, who are settling in the neighbourhood of your country. The relation of the Beni Ghafir tribes at Jaalan is the serae as that of the Beni Bu Ali and they will be treated with hospital ity like them. It is possible that some times communications may liave been addressed to you direct by officers of the High Govern ment. I am writing to you direct now, but it is at the request of His Highness the Sultan, and may have been the same on pre vious occasions. It i s not a ri^it that you can claim, and since you are the subject of His Highness you should in future send all letters for the Politifial Agent through the Muscat State authorities.

You have no ri^it at all to interfere in the aJfcti affairs of Sur or to levy taxes there, and I call on you to cease at once all inter ference in the affairs of Sur, which is the port of Oman, and it is only the flag of Oman which may be flown there. You make various requests regard ing arras and ammunition. His Highness in forms me that the cost of the ammunition deposited with him is ready and will be paid by the Muscat Government to you as soon as you ask for it. But as regards your request that you should be allowed to buy 300 Mauser rifles, with a suitable quantity of ammunition, I write to say that 1 am not prepared to advise His Highness the Sultan to let you have any rifles or ammunition at all until you have definitely ceased all interference at Sur. Oh, Shaikh Alijp take heed to my advice, cease your interference with Sur, ©u^ the coastof Oman.

I visited t&gt;UK between tne dates 13tJi and 22nd January 7; lie re I tayed witu J'i nam the Agent of iQiinyi Ramdas of muscat and ttie leaaing Indian Banyan mercliant tiiere, and also with the Waii,Saiyid Shahah bin Faisal a 'brother of the Sultan, at Balad es tiUH about 2 miles inland. 2. TJae to -wn of Maqrimatain on the west side of Sur creeJc is occupied by the Jenebeh^and Aiqa on isBgJt side chiefly by the j^eni an Ali tribe ( wahabis). The Arama and jj'uaris sections of the Jenebeh are at Jj'eud with the s^akhanna and Ghialin sections. The feud dates from 1913 and the split in the tribe has been sedulously encouraged and fostered by All bin Abdullah,Sheikh of the Beni an All and self-styled Amir of Jaalan who has championed the cause of the Maichanna and Ghiyalin Kwt sections of the Jenebeh. ne lives at the headquarters of his tribe at tne village of j^elad iseni Bu All i about 40 miles inland, and is represented at Aiqa by i man one Isa bin Muhammed/'of no importance. 3. Security does not exist in SUK; no man leaves his house without being armed even if it is only to cross \ the street; nor imy a man visit a quarter of the town either than his own except in company with some men of his own faction escorted by a rabi'a 1 or guarantor from the faction occupying the quarter he wants to visit. There are no lights in the town and the people are careful not to show a light ait their windows at night for fear of attracting rifle fire. Spasmodic shooting at night witnesses to the constant alarm of the inhabitants. The situation at jaelad es SUR, though similar, is very much less acute than that Just described in regard to SUR. 4. very few customs dues are taken at SUR and theserage 2 % these mainly from the Indian .banyans who live in Maqrimatain under the protection of the Arama - the most powerful section of tiie jenebeh. There are, including families, about 30 Indians in SUR, The principal exports are dried dates which are brought dov/n from the interior and shipped to Indian ports in bagalas - sea going dhows, u-oods shippo ed from Alqa, v.here the jbeni jku All influence is pre dominant, evade all customs ps.ymcnts except such as the aheilch of tiie jcseni Bu All is able to enforce for his own benefit. There is a very tall prominently- placed flag staff in Aiqa but 1 no flag flying from it during my visit. The Wall, who lives in a fort at ±5elad es Bur, has no civil or other authority whatsoever in Sur and very little in Belad es SUR. ne can do nothing and admits it, He rarely stirs out of his fort which is garisoned by 25 asicari paid and armed by the state, ne has not been considered a success and is to be transferred, on the return of the Sultan from Dhofar about the middle of February, ne ..ill be succeeded, i believe, by the 4 prsent Wall of Saham-a-man, i understand^ of firmer character. The ±5eni Bu Ali are themselves at feud with their neighbours m Jaalan, tne ^eni Bu nassan. This feud dates from 1812-13. while I was in Sur I heard that a truce of 6 months had been arranged between these two tribes to taice effect from approximately the beginning of January. tfro my conversation with various persons in SUR and from my own observations I am certain that the people of all classes are heartily weary of the constant state of insecurity t hich prevails there and would elcome effective governmental control which is at presentASV .fage - s 3 present entirely lacking. The person chiefly responsible for the present state of affairs is All bin Aodullah, BheiJch of the aeni jju All and if he and his tribe were brought under control and his pretensions to an independent Arnirate definitely and finally quashed it should be possible to find a way to heal u.e rupture which no v.' exists between the 4 sections of the Jenebeh, tnus removing another source of continued friction and preparing the way for consolidating that tribe and reducing it to order. Sujmned up, the situation at bUR is the result of deplorably weai: Government or rather the total absence of any government. The tribes in consequence are completely out of control. The situation is so out of iiand that it is certain that the resources of tne Muscat State, unaided, are quite incapable of dealing with it.35 /134. 35/135.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 274 of the 19th March 1930, X have the honour to forward herewith a letter feeelved from the Political Agent at Muscat giving details of the cost of raising, equipping and maintaining the additional strength of 350 men which it is estimated would 'be required to stabilise the situation at 3ur permanently. 2. The total expenditure involved is Rs. 6,86,000 spread over a period of three years after which it is estimated that a detachment of a hundred ei men only would 'be necessary and the cost of their aalntenance could be met from the customs receipts. It is, of course, beyond the power of the Muscat State to finance an additional force during the first three years and this expenditure would have to be borne by the Government of India. 3. The Government of India in their telegram No. 753-S, dated the 10th March 1930, stated that they felt that the measures advocated in my letter Mo.-■ ''''--^-j^bjiiiili. ^m ^mSSSSSSm^ nr - 2 - Ho. 688-S of the 28th Becemter 1929 were little more likely to secure permanent results than those uhloh had already been taken, and I fully appreciate the force of this view. It would certainly be preferable to raise an additional force to hold Sur as a permanent measure but the price to be paid is high and I am not aware whether the Government of India would be willing to incur the expenditure involved. 4 a xhe real point at issue seems to me to 'be the fighting qualities of the Bani Bu Ali and the amount of resistanoe they are in the last resort pre pared to put up. I fully agree with the estimate submitted 'by Ma^or Murphy of the force required which has been prepared in consultation with Captain Walker and Captain 0*Connor, who had himself recemtly visited Sur, if the situation is considered from a purely military point of view and I feel some diffidence in offering any alternative suggestion because I have no personal knowledge of the Bani Bu Ali, but I am inclined to doubt whether they would maintain a recalcitrant attitude if eome punishment was inflicted upon them and they were shown that it was the determi nation of the British Government to enforce the authority of the Muscat State on the coast. I agree that action by a warship alone would be entirely ineffective: past history has shown this. Due notice is always given of the intention to bombard, a fort or tower is knocked down after it has been evacuated, and no one is any the worse. We have at our disposal ^ nowadays however another weapon, namely, the aeroplane. It has never been used yet in the Persian Gulf except, of course, in the hinterland of Kuwait which is far removed from Oman, and the moral effect on the tribes would be considerable. It is quite possible that the presence11^ - 3 ~ presence of a flying boat with a ship might prove insufficient. Sur, howeTer, is only 94 miles from Muscat ifoere the Royal Air Jtorce have a small 'base and there would not I think he any difficulty in placing say a flight of Wapitis at Muscat for, if necessary, a couple of months and they could 'bomh 3ur several times if necessary should the Bani Bu Ali maintain their contumacious attitude. Under the circumstances I personally doubt whether they would resist for long. It may however be contended that as soon as the flight were withdrawn the Bani Bu Ali would reoccupy Sur and afcain reduce the local Muscat authorities to impotence. !rhis risk could be eliminated however if they were compelled to furnish hostages for good behaviour and one or two of their leading men were compelled to reside in Muscat for some years to come. jUrther, in this connection I would invite attention to paragraph 2 of the note of the situation in Sur prepared by Captain 0*Connor ♦ on Sur, a copy of which was forwarded for the informa tion of the Government of India. As Captain O'Connor therein points out Ali bin Abdulla, Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali, who is largely responsible for the present attitude of the tribe, lives himself only forty miles inland, that is within easy reach of air craft. Hitherto he has considered himeelf in com plete security because he knows that the Muscat State do not possess any military force sufficient to attack his own dwelling and that it is inaccessible from the sea. The presence of aeroplanes at Sur however would, I think, speedily make him realise that he was no longer so inaccessible as formerly and cause him to reflect, and if necessary the fact could be emphasised by sending a machine or janE two to fly overni •• &lt;4 ■&gt; over his village. For the above reasons I am disposed to think that if the authority of the Muscat State was supported 'by one of His Majesty 's ships, and some aeroplanes acting on the lines suggested ahove, it would, in all likelihood, prove effective and adequate and that by these means the tribe oould be compelled to give hostages: it would be very much cheaper than the raising of a special force to occupy Sur and would certainly seem worth trying. If the Government of India so desire I could approach the Air Officer Connmnding, Iraq Command, regarding the feasibility of the measures •which I have outlined and communicate his views to them. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Resfttent in the Persian Gulf.y 35/134. 35/135. Telegram ' ?rom Political Resident t Bushire.

Slr 9 I have the honour to inform you t^t the Govertt- ment of India have had under oonslderation for some ti»e past the question of re-establishing the authority of the Muscat State at Su^where it has heen flouted for a long tine hy a trihe known as the Bani Bu Ali,under %h9 leadership of their Shaik^Ali Bin Abdullah# This shaikh has endeavoured to iaake out tuat he is independent of Muscat. He has levied his own ousto© dues at Sur ana has hoisted bis own flag ana has in other ways refused to admit the Jurisdiction of the State of Oman* 2. In Hovember 1928 Our was bombarded by one of His Majesty's ships# and the fort was knocked town. Ho steps were however taken to impose the authority of his Highness the the Sultan peruianently and this action proved ineffective. I have bean urging upon the Government of India for some time past the desirability on political grounds of re-establishing the authority of the nultan and suggested to them the possibility of supplementing further naval action by a flyigg boat which could carry out a siiatbltaneous boiobardmant as I was inclined to think that the moral efxect of air acti which had not b en tried before in this part of the worid^would probably prove affective. the.. The AIH Officer C-ommanaing, iraq, mums*•a* Th© Government of India bowever considered that unless dafinlte steps were taken to reinforce the authority of the 3t3ltan such aotion was not likely to have any more permanent effect than the aotion already taken and they therefore asked me to submit an estimate of the cost of raising an additional force to strengthen the existing muscat Levy Corps to permit of their keeping a detach ment at 3ur after it had heen hoia^ard»#»V# The additional cost involved came to ahout Bs#7 lakhs spread over a per iod of 3 years* It is not possible for the Muscat State to meet this expenditure and I have therefore suggested to the Govemmant of India that in view of the fact that nur is only 94 miles from Muscat it might ha possible to use land machines and to carry out f if necessary^ repeated hombardments and compel the 3ani Bu All to give hostages for their good behaviour. 3. I enclose for your information a copy of my despatch No. 137 -3 dated 28th March 1930 on the suhjeot. As my proposal was purely tentative I did not consult you in the first instance hut as you will see^1 said that if the Government of India were inclined to view the suggestion favjura ly # X would then refer the matter to ^ ou. I have now received a telegram from the Govern ment of India directing me to ask for your views on my proposal and also enquiring whether in my opinion the proposed action would re-act unfavourably on the projected Arab Air route. I would explain that in my opinion thereis no great urgency about tho matter* The present situation has lasted for about 3 years and if it is considered preferable to defer aotion to the Autumn, when climatic conditions are more favourable, II do not think tUat any great harm would he done- Further^shoold you agree as to the posslhtlity of using Wapitis for this purpose I douht whether the Bani Bu Ali would in fact offer much resistance| on the other hand it would he desirable that the machines should remain at Muscat for a short period after operations have heen completed as a threat to the Bani Bu Ali should they show any signs of recalcitration* You may of course consider that it would he preferable to carry out operations with flying 'boats rather than with land machines This is a matter on which I am nut competent to express an opinion. For the reasons given in my despatch however I think it desirable that the machines should visit the village of the Shaikh of Bani Bu Ali which is situated 40 miles inland# an unfavourable reaction on the projected Arab Air route, If carefully regulated. It Is oDviously undeBiraKLe to arouse resentment among the Arahs by for instance injuring a mosque or women or children, hut if preliminary reoonnaisances were carried out and due warning given and the action ultimately taken limited to the accomplish ment of our needs, I think it would he recognised that the punishment was just. 5, i should he grateiul if you could let me have your views hy telegram as I am proceeding on tour on Uoard the •PATRICK 3TSWABT' on the 4th Kay to the Trucial Ooast and then going on to Simla where I will discuss the matter with the Government of India.

L. 0*Connor 1/9 J at P.egiment. 9tli April 1950 Possi'ble role of force reanired. 1, The role of a force despatolied to Sur would 'be primarily a defensive , one. It stionld l3e a'ble (a) to defend itself and the towns of Snr and B.elad es Snr from attack 'by possibly -superior triToal forces armed witti modern rifles. It may 'be required Cb) to supply escorts and guards for State authorities and to prevent interference with the functions of the local administration. (c) if air action is employed, to co-operate with the Boyal Air STorce as necessary: provide aerodrome guards, - Dispositions in occupation. £. (a). The water supply for Sur is obtained from Belad es Sur, a village ahout l-t miles inland; water is trans- -ported to Sur in skins 'by donkeys. The force should therefore encamp at Belad es Sur, where it can control the water supply. A suitable position for a, camp . is on the ridge called led, overlooking from the ISast the village of Belad es Svx, This'Tliia ridge is flat topped and rises a*bout 50 .feet higher than the surronnd- -ing plain• It dominates Balad es Sur and the approaahes to the-wells, which fall within effective rifle range. It flanks the main caravan road from the port of Snr through Balad es Sur to the interior, passing through the Beni Bu Ali and Beni Bu Hasan country. It would 'be necessary to hold the towers called SAMilgBA and JSBilSI on the ridge liTSD and the tower called ♦AI3 i mile Horth-mst of the palm groves of Belad es Sur. Samagha and Jerahi control approaches to Belad es Sur from South aUd last. M*- W towers are 'built on the .same principle as our 'blockhouses in the Khyher. They require repairing 'but could 'be made to accoiiimodate 8 - 10 men each. At present there are three men in each. It may also 'be necessary to occupy the small fort on the road to the interior and ahout 3|- miles from Belad es Sur. Early information of a threatened attack from the South could thus he obtained. It is at present held 'by 7 men of the Beni Bu Ali trihe and is not under the control of the ¥ali. (h) The ¥ali of Sur lives at Belad es Sur and has ahout 60 arraed trihesmen (askers) . , Their dispositions axe Wall's residence and fort 16 man Samagha tower 3 '* J erahl ' 3 ' ais ' 3• f/ Jinah Tort is a large, square, walled enclosure with towers at each angle and a large tower inside.

The Shaikh is Ali 'bin AMullah A1 Eamudah. He lives at the trihal headquarters at Belad Beni Bu Ali, a large village sit- -uated ahout 40 miles inland. This trihe might with its allies he ahle to raise 1000 - 1500 men hut it is improhahle that it could collect more than fbO or ^00. The village of Ai&lt;ia, on the sea, separated from Maoriinatain (Sur) hy a narrow creek ? is occupied hy the Beni Bu All. It could raise ahout 70 men. Jeneljeb. The Jeneheh of Sur are divided into four sections. Two of them, the Makhanna and Ghiyalin, are at feud with the other the Arama and 'Fuaris. The Makhanna and Ghiyalin axe allied to the Beni Bu All, who would use every endeavour to enlist their help. The fighting strength of the Makhanna and Ghiyalin sections is ahout 250 - 300 rifles. -That. That of the Ararna and Tu aria, who are well disposed to the Government; at present ; is a.hoiit 400 rifles. They are a seagoing trihe and a large numher ax'e at sea for long periods. During the worst of the South-East monsoon there is a lull in their seagoing The presence of a ^ force and the consequent ( activities, stronger government control, which is likely to he unpopular, makes it hot' unlikely that sai,e of the Jene/eh would he drawn into hostilities against the Muscat State. HISt their hy livelihood is from / the sea and their town is ciuite open to homhardment hy H.M's^ Ships. Beni Bu Hassan . This trihe have a long sts^nd- -ing feud with the Band Bu Ali and it is unlikely that they would assist the Latter. The village of Belad Beni Bu fririr Hasan is ahout 3-4 miles from Belad Beni Bu Ali. Recently, in March 19S0j the Beni, Bu Hassan raided the village of Belad es S-ur. Until this occurrence they had heen on good terms with the State Government. They number, with allies, ahout 700-800 fighting men and could raise ahout 550-450. Armament . The tribes of Sur and Jaalan are armed principally with Martini Henrys hut there are also a fair pro- -portion of British pattern magazine rifles and some Turkish rifles- The supply of ammunition may he taken as 100 to 150 rounds per man. Inen In addition they can and do make tbeir own rounds with lead and guni^owder, using fired cases and fresh caps. Directions' from 4. Attacks might come from any which attacks . ^ _ might he direction a.nd might he delivered from anticipated all directions at the sajne time. il cornmon method of attack of a village is for a few men to creep up hy nighty fire the r&amp;ed huts while the remainder shoot hy the light of the flames. The most likely direction from which attacks might he anticipated are the South East and East as the gflpund on those sides affords covered approaches. Gomposition 5# The estimate of the xorce of force. required to occupy Belad es Sur was given as 400, of whom 200 were to he Pim.lahis » and the rest Baluchis. But if Indians are not avallahle, as suggest- ~ed in Government of India telegram Fo. s 1327-S of 1st lia-y 1950^ I have grave douhti of the wisdom of sending a force composed entirely of Baluchis. But should this he decided on, the strength of the force should, in my opinion, he increased to 600 men.01t suil» jauuasy 1930. % Landing facilities. There are small 'bedans avail able at Sur for landing troops and oaggage 'but not mules, transport veliioles, or gnns» A large nmnber of ^horis' (open 'boats) sire available whioli could 'be used for landing small articles of 'baggage:i.e.men*s kits etc. Sblps would have to anchor in open anchorage off the tovjn in from 8 to 11 fathoms and dis tant from shore 6 cables or slightly over 1200 yds» There are no piers: all craft would have to 'be 'beached. The beach is ' mile long and is commanded on both east and west sides by high ground surmounted by towers capable of holding 10 men. On the eastern side there are 2 towers and on western 5. These are all visible from the sea. Transport. There is no wheeled transport available. About 50 camels and 100 donkeys are available in SUE, but more could be ob tained from the interior. About 300 donkeys could be obtained from Belad-es-Sur and vil-r lages around. Donkeys are used for transport of water, in skins. Oonnmnications- (a) 'Roads through the town are broad Heads. and suitable for all forms of :'.T. A broad all-weather track with hard surface and suit able for all forms of K.T.exists between SUE and BSIAD-SS-6UE about two miles inland,inland, where tbe water supply is locatea and where camping ground would need to he situated. At point where this road enters the valley of B JLAI)- ES-SUH and % mile from town some work is required to improve it. A Jlatoon of men working for 2 hours could accomplish this. This road is called SL PSJ. (h). Ho telegraph or telephone communication exists. 'Wooden poles ('bullies) are available for carrying telephone lines. There are over 80 large wells in BELAD-ES-SIIR used as a water supply for the town and for cultivation. Thres are recommended.. These are named SAILiOHA (nearest to camping ground). ESS A and SABAIKHAH and are lined with stone and cements Diameters; 11 ft.,21 ft*.23 ft. Depth to water: 15 to 13 ft. Depth of water: 2 to 3 ft. This does not decrease in summer hut rises after rain. The ahove is the average depth of all the wells. The Arahs rarely take the trouble to dig deeper than is nece ssary to give them this head of water. Majority of wells are stone lined and fitted with overhead gear made of cut palm trees supporting a pulley. Water is drawn up in large skins 'by bullocks• A few wells have reservoirs for stor age of water, capacity about 3500 gallongallons. Ttiere are 11 wells at SAKillKRAH, 1 mile from BELAJD-'SS- 3TJB• Stone lined: diameters varying from 18 to 24 f'r deptli 12 to 15 ft J deptli of water H to 2 ft. Tke water from these is slightly 'braclcisli and is used for cultivation. It could 'be used 'by troops for washing.. At SAHAXSALAH, a small village on the coast 1 mile west of SUB, there are 2 wells• These suffice only for the needs of the villagers. Sufficient water exists in BELAD 133-SUR for 2 'battalions after^ the needs of the population have 'been met. The water supply could he increased hy deepening the wells, fresh welIs could he dug y If thought necessary, anywhere in the valley. (a) Bice, wheat,dall,sugar ? matches imported from India, are available in STIR.- Oil from Abadani Anglo-Persian Gil Co.) is shipped from Muscat, (h). Local supplies are chickens, eggs,goats,milk,fish,fuel and dates. Fresh vegetables are not available hut could he grown in BSIAD-ES-SUH. Ground is available for extensive cuLtivation. The only animal food obtainable locally is lucernej donkeys are largely fed on dates, especially on a journey. There is no grazing except for camels and goats. BhoosaBtLOQsa is not available,nor 'barley, (c) The only product from the interior is dry dates called M 'besr M ( ) which are largely exported to India,. Ji Ham, an Indian Banyan and SITU representative of the firm of Khimji Ham Dass of Muscat would he a very useful man to retain as general agent 'by a force landing in SUH. He has had 10 years in the place an is widely known and highly respected hy hoth townspeople and tribes of the interior. Ho accommodation exists for housing troops. Tents would he suita le for the greater part of the year. StJH has a much better summer than'lmscat, not 'being surrounded hy rocky hills as is the latter place, and a oool wind 'blows through^out i the year. Material is available locally for hutting. The most suitable site for a camp ing ground is on the S.3.extremity of the low ridge called 'SD which rises from 50 to 100 ft. in height and runs froia S.E. to lT. T T.at a distance of 2 miles from SUE. At its S.E.extremity it dominates at close range the town of BSLiD-ES-STJE and the water supply there. There are two towers on this ridge; 3AMAGEA near the camping ground and JSRABI ahout 1000 yds. away. On another and neighbouring ridge overlooking the motor road where it enters the valley of BSLAD-ES-SUR, there is a third tower called AIS. There is a garrison of 5 to 48.
