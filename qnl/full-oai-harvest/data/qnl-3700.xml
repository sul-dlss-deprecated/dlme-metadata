However, folios 335-341, dated February 1944, are out of chronological order, as they follow papers dated 1946. Circled serial numbers in crayon and ink (red for incoming, blue for outgoing correspondence), which occur throughout the file, refer to entries in the notes.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 376; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional mixed foliation/pagination sequence is also present in parallel between ff 1-375; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the registration of documents by the Political Agency, Bahrain.The papers consist of correspondence between those applying to have documents registered and the Political Agency, Bahrain.
