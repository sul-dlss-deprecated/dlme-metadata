WILLOUGHBY, Dated 27tk July 1846. 1 Since 1 recorded the above minute, we have received a copy of the HonoraUe Court s despatch to the Government of India dated the 17th ultimo, which contains the following remark ' We entirely approve of your having declined to authorise any a ttem P s 0 0 ' tain the co-operation of Native States in measures for preventing the transit from Malwa to the sea of opium unprotected by a British pass. The evil effects of the restrictive syste which you were compelled to abandon in the year 1829, should warn us against again resorting to any proceedings for the preventing of smuggling beyond the adoption ot sm able precautions, and the exercise of due vigilance within our own territory. 2 1 was not in possession of the information contained in this extract when I recorded mv minute of the 25th. 1 would, however, still call for the information I have suggested, though of course no measures can now be adopted to induce Barnah or Oodeepoor, m the absence of actual engagements, to co-operate with us in the restrictive policy, until the ques- tiou has been specially referred for the consideration of the Honorable Court. 3 It may be, however, that the Court only refer to Native States in Malwa, and I hope this is the right construction, for 1 am satisfied that as the territory of the Guieowar an,I other petty foreign States so nearly approaches the sea, it will almost be impossi) e to pie- vent smuggling now that the inducement to do so is so much increased by the enhancemen of the price for passes, if our preventive measures are confined to our own territories. 4. The restrictive police undoubtedly exists in Kattiawar and the Mahee Kaunta, and I see no reason why it should not extend to Barriah, Oodeepoor, and Rajpeepla. The hrst place effectually commands one route by which opium is smuggled, and the second place another. Our'opium restrictions, however, have always been in force in His Highness the Guicowar's territory, though they have been imperfectly enforced. If these preventive arrangements are now to be abandoned, a great stimulus will be given to the illicit trathc in opium, and consequent diminution of the revenue we derive from this source ; and need not add this will occur at a time when the state of our finances can very ill afford the loss. 5. Copy of this correspondence, and of these minutes, should at once be foiwarded to the Governor General of India, for any orders His Lordship may see fit to issue. 6. Copy should also be transferred to the Revenue Department for information. (Signed) J. P. WILLOIGHI'A , 27f/i July 1846.MINUTE BY THE HONORABLE MR. WILLOUGHBY, Dated 28ih July 1846. * 1. I beg to refer tcf my minute dated the STth instant, for my opinion on the injurious etlect likely to be produced on the revenue we derive frorn opium, if measures of prevention are confined to British territory only. '1. 1 he reference therein suggested will probably elicit further information regarding the system which has heretofore been in force, in the districts subject to the control ol the politi cal authorities in Guzerat. I have before remarked, that this practice has usually been to regard all opium unprotected by a British pass to be liable to confiscation. 3. I still think engagements were entered into, to the above effect, by some of the Chiefs â€”for instance the Rajah of Rajpeempla, the Chief of Barriah, and I think the Rajah of Chota Oodeepoor. I should wish a careful search to be made in the Political and Revenue Depart ments for information on this subject, commencing with the year 1821. The practice either under engagement or by usage within the Guicowar territory should also be ascertained. 4. In the Mahee Kaunta, traces of prohibitory measures have been discovered, but from Captain Keily's report of the 4th April last, they never appear to have been rigidly acted on. I he recoids of the Secretariate should also be searched for information in regard to this province, for I do not suppose that I should have issued the proclamation in 1829 (alluded to in paragraph 2 of Captain Keily's report) without due authority. 5. With respect to Kattiawar, no doubt exists. Our prohibitory measures have been in force in this province since 1821. Repeated seizures and confiscations have occurred, and an annual supply of opium is forwarded to the Political Agent at Rajcote, and by him dis tributed according to a fixed scale, among the several tributaries. G. I believe also I am right in asserting that the same prohibitory system exists in the adjacent province of Cutch, under an engagement with His Highness the Rao, and no one will, I think, dispute the necessity of this outlet being closed. 7. But if the instructions issued by the Government of India have been rightly interpret ed, all these measures are opposed to the views of that authorit}^, restricting the operation of preventive measures against the illicit trade in opium, to our own territory, and these views, as stated in my minute of the 29th instant, appear to have been concurred in by the Honor able Court of Directors, in their despatch dated the 17th June last, received by the last mail. 8. I do not think, therefore, that we can reply to the Resident of Indore's letter of December last, without previous reference to the Government of India for instructions. 9. I would therefore propose, that an extract from our proceedings be immediately for warded to that authority, accompanied by a brief outline of the circumstances under which the question at issue has been raised. 10. It admits of no doubt that all opium unprotected by a British pass is liable to transit duties to the Native States through which it passes, and therefore, that irrespective of any formal engagement, any attempt clandestinely to import the drug renders it liable to seizure and confiscation. Under this view, the opium seized in Doodeea, a village belono-ino- to Barriah, being clearly smuggled, was obviously liable to seizure, whether it belonged to^he - mjheera Durbar or to merchants. I see no reason why persons employed by our Govern ment in these districts should not be empowered to seize, on behalf of the Native Govern- ment, any opium so passing ; the drug itself, or the proceeds of its sale, being divided between t ie rsative State and the captors, in the proportions prescribed in our own rules. 'We have[ 2 ] never, that I am aware of, confiscated to our own use opium seized out of British territory; we have merely aided the Chiefs in co-operating in our preventive measures for the benefit of both parties, their benefit being the value of an article declared contraband, and ours the indirect support which this check to the illicit trade in opium afforded to one ot the most lucrative sources of the public revenue. 11. In referring the question for the consideration and orders of the Government o India, it should be specially noticed that the Chiefs of the Mahee Kaunta and Rewa Kaunta can in no sense of the term be considered independant. They are either tributary and dependau^ on the British or Guicowar Governments, and bound, therefore, we consider, to attend to our requisitions on a subject of so much general fiscal importance. r lhey are liable to strict supervision by the Political Officers of the British Government, who hold Courts of criminal justice in their territories for the trial and punishment ot oilences beyond their competency to deal with. . . 12. Instead of relaxing the prohibitory measures heretofore in force in these tributary states, I should with deference advocate their extension and more rigid enforcement at all places where our influence exists, beyond the limits of Malwa. r i his is, however, a question which the Government of India can alone determine ; but I should fail in my duty were I not to point out, that if the Barriah and Oodeepore outlets are opened for the free passage of opium, the Demaum trade, with the pass fee raised to Us. 300 per chest, must largely revive , for the only risk to be incurred by the smugglers would be in travelling a few miles by land either in the Broach or Surat Collectorates; or, what is more likely, opium would be brought from Oodeepore to Tulluckwara, and there be embarked on the Nerbudda, by which river it would not be very difficult to transport it by sea direct to Demaun. 13. Before the subject is referred to Calcutta, these proceedings should be submitted to Mr. Reid, who will probably desire to record his sentiments on a subject with which he is so conversant. (Signed) J. P. WILLOUGHBY. 2Sth July 1848.V MINUTE BY THE HONORABLE MR. WILLOUGHBY, Dated 20th July 1848. ,1. In conformity with the Board's request, I now proceed to offer my remarks on the system under which the trade in opium is regulated under this Presidency, with the view ot determining- how far it is effectual, for prevention of smuggling, and the protection of this important source of revenue. The subject has become of more importance, in consequence of the pass-fee on Malwa opium having lately been raised to Rs. 400 per chest, whereby it may reasonably be expected a considerable stimulus has been given to those engaged in the illicit trade in opium. o. Considerable delay has occurred in recording my sentiments on this subject, origi- nating in causes beyond my control. The correspondence on the questions at issue were in the first instance, apparently through oversight, delayed in the Secretary's Office; and a minute which 1 recorded as far back as the 2nd July 1846 appears to have escaped notice, and has not been acted upon. To this is to be added the delay occasioned in searching for the information I required, through numerous volumes in the Political and Revenue Depart ments, and from some of these being in circulation, and not therefore immediately at my command. 3. In the mean time the Government of India has required from this Government a report on the present state of the opium trade in Guzeratand Kattiawar, where the restrictive system is still in force, and as to the nature of the system as it exists at present; and with our report we are requested to forward copy of the reply of the Political Agent in the Rewa Kaunta to our letter dated 28th July 1846, calling for information on the system now in force in respect to the opium trade within the limits of his jurisdiction. 4. I regret to find that this requisition was made as far back as the 31st October 1846, in reply to a reference, dated 1st August 1846, made by this Government in regard to the disposal of some opium seized at Chota Oodepore in Guzerat, and the adoption of measures for the prevention of the illicit trade in opium. By another oversight in the Secretariate, this letter, instead of being at once circulated, was detained with the other correspondence on the sub ject; and two further calls, dated 6th November 1847 and 18th March 1848, have since been received from the Government of India for the required information. 5. In now forwarding this information, we should express our regret that so long a delay should have occurred in replying to a reference of so much importance ; the more especially as although in part unavoidable, it cannot, for the reasons above alluded to, be considered altogether so. 6. I shall now endeavour to explain the past as well as present state of the opium trade, ls&lt;, in our own territory, and in that of foreign States, with which it is so much intermixed. 7.' And first, as regards the system in force in British territory. I find that the earliest attempt to secure a revenue from opium under this Presidency was made in 1817. In this vear the Government of India suggested (letter dated 7th February 1817) that the con sumption of opium in Guzerat and other districts might under proper regulations be made available as a source of revenue, and the inordinate use of the drug be at the same time checked. To effect these objects, the Bombay Government resolved to establish depots for the sale of opium to licensed retail venders, by which means it was expected that the regula tion of the supply for the internal consumption would become completely under control. A Regulation (No. \ 11. of 1817) was passed in this year for preventing the importation and sale[ 2 ] of tobacco, ganza, and snuff, into the island of Bombay, and for regulating the retail sale thereof, some of the provisions of which were by subsequent enactments made applicable to opium. 8. In the following year, with a view to the improvement and security of the public revenue, a Regulation (No. I. ol 1818) was passed, rendering all opium not pioduced with in the territories dependent on the Presidency of Fort William liable, on being imported into this Presidency, to a duty of Rs. 12 per Surat seer; all opium otherwise imported being . at the same time declared forfeited, in the proportion of two-thirds to Government, and one- third to the informer. The object ol this Regulation was to give effect to the plan 11 utled to in the preceding paragraph, by imposing a duty almost prohibitory on all opium imported in excess of the quantity provided by the Government itself for internal consumption. 9. The Government depots were at first supplied by the Opium Agent in Malvva (see letter to this officer, dated the 8th August 18*20) with the quantity of opium required in Guzerat and Kattiawar and Cutch, on indent from the Collector of Ahmedabad, the Political Agent in Kattiawar, and the Resident in Cutch. These officers were directed to warehouse it, and to license such number of shops as might be requisite for retailing the drug, at such rates as would check its inordinate use, and yet be within tiie reach ot those addicted to it. 10. On the recommendation of the Collector of Ahmedabad, the fee to be paid for a license to retail opium was fixed at Rs. 20. (Government Resolution, dated 12th April 1819.) This officer estimated that the quantity of opium required for the internal consumption of Guzerat and Kattiawar annually was 2,000 maunds, each maund being 51 lbs. G oz. 8 dwts. and 8 grs. Of this, 600 maunds were required for Ahmedabad, 400 for Kaira, and 1,000 for the whole of Kattiawar and Jhallawar. (Collector's letter, dated 14th July 1820.) In the Ahmedabad Collectorate alone 600 licenses were taken out, and the Collector calculated that each retail dealer must, in order to reimburse himself for the cost of his license, and to obtain a reasonable profit, dispose ot at least one maund. In the city itself, wheie only 2J licenses had been issued, the quantity sold was, in 1819, 112 mauiids, or very nearly tour times the above average assumed for each dealer. 11. In September 1818, this Government submitted to the Government of India the draft of a Regulation modifying Regulation I. of 1818, the chief object of which was to combine the means of supplying opium for internal consumption with the measures neces sary to prevent its export. In reply, the Bombay Government were informed, (letter from the Government of India, dated the 20th November 1818,) that unless it could itself furnish the requisite supply of opium, it seemed indispensably necessary to relieve opium imported for internal consumption from the heavy duty imposed by Regulation Lot 1818. Con cluding, therefore, that this Government were satisfied that measures could not be advan tageously adopted to obtain a direct supply, they proceeded to consider how a partial remission of the duty could be combined with the prevention of the export trade, lo effect this object, it was suggested that an export as well as an import duty should be imposed, so that the latter might counteract the evasion of the rules prescribed for the collection of the former, so as to admit of the same easv relaxation of those rules. But in 1818 the Govern ments of India were not empowered to impose such a duty without the previous sanction of the Honorable Court of Directors, to whom therefore the proposed Regulation must be submitted. As, however, the matters pressed, it was suggested that in the mean time, instead of any formal rescission of Regulation I. of 1818, its provisions should be condi tionally relaxed, in the form of a temporary notification, in preference to legislative enact ment, in the same manner as had been done at Calcutta in regard to the export of indigo to the United Kingdom, precautions being adopted to prevent evasion of payment of the duty imposed by Regulation I. of 1818. With respect to the retail sale of opium, it was observed that the Government was competent to impose any restrictions it deemed proper, and although free transit and export must be allowed to all opium on which the prescribed duty/JZ- [ 3 ] had been paid on importation, proof of legal import might be demanded, and on failure thereof the opium might be treated as if illicitly imported. Instructions to the above effect were issued for the guidance of the Collector of Ahmedabad. 12. The defects of Regulation I. of 1818 were at length remedied by Regulation II. of 1820, passed on the 10th of May of that year. It enacted in Section III. that all opium imported into any part of the Bombay Presidency, contrary to it, and to Regulation I. of 1818, shall be deemed smuggled, and forfeited, together with the packages containing and ^the vessels and animals conveying it. Officers of Customs and others are authorised to seize and secure it in Govertiment warehouses next to the place of seizure, until the owner proves its legal transit, if in Bombay before the Court of Petty Sessions, if in any subordinate dis trict before the Magistrate of such district, within ten days after seizure. On failure of this, the law to take effect, one-third of the value of the opium being paid to the informer, and two-thirds to the East India Company. The right of search for smuggled opium is con firmed in Section IV. on information on oath before any Collector of Customs, Collector or Magistrate, with power of detention until proof of legal import is adduced ; and on failure thereof, of confiscation in the manner above described. Any person knowingly keep ing or concealing smuggled opium, in addition to forfeiting it, is to pay double the amount of legal duty payable on it. The remainder of the Regulation prescribes the mode in which seizures of opium are to be prosecuted. 13. In 1822 a circular dated 22nd August was issued to the several Collectors of districts in which opium is chiefly consumed, calling for returns of the quantity of opium required for internal consumption, and directing them to license the requisite number of shops for retail, fixing the price at such a rate as would check the inordinate use of the drug, and yet be within the reach of those addicted to it. Ou this occasion, the retail trade was placed under further restrictions. Europeans were interdicted from engaging in it, and the Native dealers were restricted from selling more than five tolas' weight of opium at one time to the same individual, and were bound to conduct their sale according to the provisions of Regulation VII. of 1817. (Vide paragraph 7 of this minute.) 14. In 1827, the Regulations or laws of this Presidency were revised and embodied into one Code, under the Government of â€¢the Honorable Mr. Elphinstone. Regulation XXI. of this Code imposes customs on opium, and other articles therein specified, and restrictions ou the trade thereof. The duty is the same as was imposed by Regulation I. of 1818, namely Rs. 12 per Suratseer on all opium 'imported or brought into any harbour, or road, or port, or place, either by land or sea, within the Presidency of Bombay, or territories subordinate thereto.'' As regards the penalties for smuggling, and for aiding and abetting or concealing the smuggling of opium, the mode of enforcing those penalties, and the rewards to be granted to informers, the Regulation does not materially differ from Regulation II. of 1820. For the first time, however, the supply of opium for internal consumption and its transit from place to place was made the subject of legislative enactment. (Vide Chapter III. Regulation XXL of 1827.) The former was entrusted to the Collector of Land Revenue, with authority under the sanction of Government to establish depots for opium for sale to licensed dealers, and to frame rules for its sale by retail on all points not already provided for by law. in another Chapter of this Regulation (Chapter IV.) rules for the retail sale of opium and penalties for breaciies of the same are prescribed. A retailer is defined to be a person selling at one distinct sale any quantity of opium not exceeding two Surat raaunds. To obtain this privilege, he must obtain a license from the Collector, and any person retailing without such license, in addition to forfeiting the opium found in his possession, is liable to a fine of Rs. 50. Any person unlicensed to retail, in whose possession is found more than a quarter of a Surat seer of opium, not shown to have been legally obtained, is declared liable to the penalties incurred for abetting smuggling. Licensed retailers in possession of smuggled opium, in addition to forfeiting the opium, lose their license. The remainder of the[ 4 ] Regulation prescribes the conditions and restrictions under which the retail sale is to be 15 1 have accidentally discovered in the course of this inquiry, that ihe retail sale of opium is differently regulated in Gu^erat and in the Deccan. In Guzerat any Native* may obtain a license to self opium on payment of a fee of Rs. 20 for twelve months. In the Deccan however, the exclusive right of selling opium within certain limits is disposed of by public auction to the highest bidder, for a similar period-t I do not know under what autho- ^ rity this difference has arisen, and it may be as well to inquire. 16 The usual effect of imposing high duties on a valuable commedity in great demand was soon experienced. An extensive contraband trade in opium sprung up, and an entrepot for the illicit trade was established at the Portuguese settlement of Demaun, in the vicinity of Surat, at which place several thousand chests of Malwa opium were annually imported, chiefly by the circuitous route of Sciude, from whence it was exported direct to China. The continuance of this trade would have been fatal to our opium monopoly, and with the view of counteracting' it, in 1830 it was found necessary and expedient to relax the restrictive system imposed by Regulation XXI. of 1827, on the sale and purchase of opium produced beyond the limits of the Presidency of Fort \\ illiam, and to admit ol the direct passage ami importation into Bombay of opium the produce of Malwa, under permits, for ultimate ex portation by sea. Accordingly Regulation XX., dated the 17th November 1830, was passed, rescinding Sections I. and II. of Regulation XXI. of 1827, as far as related to Malwa opium, and making it lawful to import such opium into Bombay for exportation by sea by the direct route 'from Malwa, under a rowana or pass, in consideration of such amount of fee as Government may from time to time deem expedient, instead of the ordinary duties leviable under Regulation XXI. of 1827. All Malwa opium unaccompanied by a pass, or any quantity in excess 0 of that specified in the pass, is still subject to the duty imposed by Regulation XXI. of 1827, which, in fact, with the above exception, remains in lull lorce up to the present day. , . â„¢ , 17. Under Regulation XX. of 1830 no opium except that produced in Malwa can be protected by a pass. In 1841 it was decided that opium produced in Scindia's districts in Kandeish must be treated as all other opium not the produce of Malwa, that is, be liable to the duty of Rs. 12 the Surat seer. In April 1841 a Persian merchant residing in Bombay applied for permission to import opium from Bushire, on payment of the usual duty on each chest of 140 lbs. He was informed in reply that Regulation XX. of 1830 applied only to Malwa opium, and that opium imported from Bushire would be liable, uudei Schedule A of Act I. of 1838, to a duty of Rs. 24 per seer of 80 tolas' weight. In both these cases the heavy rate of duty demanded was tantamount to prohibition. 18. The Honorable Court of Directors have justly observed, (despatch to the Government of Bombay in the Revenue Department, dated the 28th February 1844,) that *' the price which we can expect to obtain on our passes must be regulated by the cost which the merchant would be compelled to incur by the selection of other routes by which our territory is avoided, as for instance that through Kattiawar to the sea coast, or that through Rajpootana and the Punjaub into China, via Leedakh' ; and the same authority have stated in the same despatch, that ' it is desirable on every account to maintain the price at the highest amount which experience may show can be levied, without forcing the trade into other channels.' Very nearlv the same principle had been enunciated by this Government in 1841, when the po litical authorities in Guzerat were required by circular dated 21st January 1^41 to report whether the pass-fee could not be increased ' without a diversion of the traffic in the drug into routes over which it is difficult to establish an effective system of control.' * Vide the petition of an inhabitant of Kaira, praying for a refund of the fee, the party licensed having died, and the Collector's report thereon, dated the 23rd March And 27th April 1841. f Vide petition from an inhabitant of Indepore, and Collector of Sholapore's report thereon, dated the 24th March and 22nd April 1841.[ 5 ] 19. The pass system for the importation of Malvva opium has remained in force from the passing of Regulation XX. of 1830 up to the present time, but the fee demanded has from time to time been raised, and reduced, according to circumstances. In the first instance, having no experience to guide us, the fee was fixed by Proclamation dated 8th November 1830 at Rs. 175 per chest; it was found, however, that this rate was not sufficiently low to check the illicit trade carried on at Demaun, which on the contrary greatly increased. In Octo ber 1835 the fee was by proclamation reduced to Rs. 125 per chest, and under this rate a ^ considerable diminution of the Demaun trade soon became apparent. In 1843, in conse quence of the occupation of Scinde having closed the chief route by which Malwa opium had been previously brought to the sea for exportation through foreign territories, the Fee was raised to Rs. 200 ; on the 13th August 1845 it was raised to Rs. 300; and on the 1st December 1846 to Rs. 400, which is the present rate. (Vide Proclamations of 1843, 1845, and 1846.) In fixing this rate the Government of India observed (letter dated 13th No vember 1846), that notwithstanding the increase from Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, they were led to believe that ' the cultivation of opium in Malvva has largely increased, and is still increasing ; and that the provision of the present season will probably not be short of 30,000 chests, of which, owing to measures adopted by the Bombay merchants to secure a better quality of the drug, some 25,000 chests will be free from adulteration, and therefore they deduced the further enhancement will not have any injurious effect upon the trade. 20. The following statement, which 1 have obtained from the Opium Agent in Bombay, of the number of chests imported, and the amount of revenue derived from the pass system from the year 1830-31, when it first came into operation, up to 1847-48, exhibits in a small compass the results of the system :â€” Years.

A few remarks may here be useful on the ascertained effects of the enhancement of the price paid for passes. Even in 1843, when the price was raised from Rs. 125 to Rs. 200 per chest, this Government was apprehensive that the effect would be to diminish the revenue, and to revive the illicit trade at Demaun. The local authorities were therefore directed (circular dated 7th September 1843, repeated in July 1844) to report the effect produced at the end of six months, and the following was the result:â€” * According to the return published in the last Bombay Government Gazette, the number of chests for which passes had been obtained up to the 20th July 1848 was 11,128, and the revenue derived therefrom, Rs. 44,48,800. We are, I believe, indebted for this to a very considerable rise in the price of opium in China, but for which, those conversant with the trade assert not more than 7,000 chests would have been imported. If, however, the produce ot Malwa was 30,000 chests, what has become of the balance of nearly 19,000 chests ?[ 6 1 Baroda. â€”(Letter dated 17th July and 23,-d August 1844.)

Malwa. â€”(Letter dated 22nd August 1841.*) The Agent in Malwa submitted in 1844 a statement exhibiting the financial results of the pass system from its first introduction in 1830. From this it appeared that during the first five years, with the fee at Rs. 175 per chest, the average number of chests exported was 1821f, and the average revenue realized at Indore Rs. 3,89,705. From 1835-36 to 1842-43, with the reduced fee of Rs. 125, the &gt; average number of chests was 15,412| and the average revenue Rs. 18,07,8311. In 1843- 44, with the fee at Ri. 200, the number of chests exported up to the date of Mr. Hamilton's report was 13,325, and the revenue collected Hs. 2,66,500; and the Agent anticipated that at the end of the season tiiese figures would be increased to 14,325 and Rs. 28,65,000. In 1839-40, in consequence of the war in China, and consequent interruption of trade, only 2,151 chests were exported, and Rs. 2,67,500 of revenue realized ; and in 1842-43, in conse quence of an intimation of the intention to raise the fee from Rs. 125 to Rs. 200, every exertion was made by the dealers in opium to bring as much of the drug as was possible to the scales before the 1st October 1843. Thus in September of that year, in which month the transactions are very limited, no less than 8,414 chests passed the scales, and the num ber of chests exported during the whole season was 24,337, and the receipts of Government Rs. 30,26,500. From these data the Agent deduced that the enhancement of the pass price had not affected the revenue, nor, as far as he could learn, had it affected the cultivation. The price, he observed, 'operates neither on the producer nor the speculator, but on the con sumer in China.' Transactions in opium, like those in stock, are governed by the price on the settling day, and the drug is bought, sold, delivered, and adjustment made, more in the spirit of gambling than straightforward mercantile enterprise. The rate of duty, therefore, is but a secondary consideration to the large speculators. 22. In 1846 a circular dated 10th June 1846 was again issued to the same officers, re quiring them to report the effect produced on the opium trade by the price of passes having been raised from Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, and whether in particular it had led to an increase of the traffic formerly carried on at Demaun, or to smuggling generally. The general result of this reference established that no increase of smuggling had occurred, or that, taking into consideration the number of passes^taken out in anticipation of the rise of price, that there had been any diminution in the quantity of opium exported generally, although the quanti ty exported by the Khandeish and Guzerat routes appeared to have undergone some change in favour of the former. The Collector of Surat, however, although he reported (letter dated the 19th September 1846) that the Demaun trade had not increased, and was at present inconsiderable, stated that an increase of smuggling was proved by the fact that the sale accounts of the retail dealers in the city had fallen off two-fifths, since as no diminu tion in the consumption had taken place, the difference must have been supplied by illicit importation from the Guicowar's and other foreign territories adjacent to his Collectorate. 23. In June 1847 the pass-fee was raised from Rs. 300 to Rs. 400, and the time has now, I think, arrived for repeating the circulars of 1843 and 1846, in order that we may ascertain whether the imposition of this high duty has not had the effect of diverting the traffic in opium into channels over which we have no effective control, especially as we were informed by the Government of India, that should it appear hereafter that special preventive measures are requisite in any particular direction to check a tendency to smuggling, they would be prepared to co-operate to any extent circumstances may warrant towards the protection of this very important branch of the public revenue. According to the latest return 1 have seen, the number of chests exported during the season of 1847-48 was 11,128, yielding a revenue of Rs. 44,48,800 (vide Bombay Government Gazette, dated the 20th July 1848); and had it not been for a sudden and unexpected rise in the price of opium in China, the * 1 or further particulars regarding the results of the pass sj'stem, see Bombay Opium Agent's report, dated l^t November 1814.[ 8 ] number would not probably have exceeded 7 or 8,000 chests. (See note to para. 20 of this minute.) Admitting that during this season the quantity of opium produced fell far short of that of the preceding season, which was estimated at 30,000 chests, (letter from the Government of India, dated the 13th November 1846,) the inference is inevitable that smug gling to a large extent must occur through some channel, which apparently yet remains to be discovered. 24. In these remarks, however, I am anticipating what may be more appropriately in cluded in the concluding observations of my minute, and I shall now proceed to the second ^ branch into which I have divided it, and explain as well as I am able* the past and present condition of the opium trade in foreign States, with whose territory our own is so much intermixed. 25. A glance at the map will show that the territory of this Presidency is so much inter mixed with that of foreign States, that the system adopted in the former for regulating the opium trade, and securing the important revenue derived from this source, could not possi bly have succeeded, unless it had been simultaneously introduced into the latter. Accord ingly, I shall now show that that system was introduced and enforced with the consent of all the States and Chiefs of Guzerat, Cutch, and Kattiawar, and even in the Deccan, although, for reasons I have not been able satisfactorily to ascertain, in some of them the restrictions imposed on the trade appear to have gradually become a dead letter. 26. I shall commence with Baroda, the capital of the Guicowar State, as being the most important. There can be no doubt that our restrictive system was, with the free consent of the Guicowar, introduced throughout his territor}^. The exportation of opium was first prohibited* in this State by an edict of that Government dated the 2nd July 1817, as fol lows :â€”' An arrangement has been made this year by this Government, in concert with the Government of the Honorable Company, that merchants are not to export for sale opium from the Guicowar districts to other territories, nor to the sea-ports. If they convey it to sea-ports, or to other countries, the property will be confiscated.' On the 24th April 1818, another proclamation was issued explanatory of the first, prohibiting the exportation of opium to foreign countries, except on payment of a duty of Rs. 12 per seer, and directing registers to be kept of all exports, and the places of exports, and declaring opium clandestine ly conveyed liable to confiscation, two-thirds of the proceeds being paid to the Government, and one-third to the seizer. By this, in fact, Regulation I. of 1818 was extended to the Gui cowar territory. On the 10th October of the same year, a third order was issued to the Ka- mavisdars of districts referring to the second, declaring, l.s^, that opium required for internal consumption in the Mahals was to pay a duty of Rs. 2 per seer; 2nd, that opium intended for exportation by sea was to pay a duty of Rs. 12 per seer; and Sn/, that opium clandestinely conveyed should be confiscated. In May 1820 (letter dated the 16th May 1820), the Collect or of Ahmedabad discovered that a very extensive trade in opium was illicitly carried on through the western ports of Kattiavvar, and effected some large seizures of the drug at Drang- dra, and other places in that province. Among other measures adopted to put a stop to this trade, the Resident at Baroda was instructed to obtain the Guicowar's assent to our local officers seizing all opium in transit through his districts intersected by ours. This was immediately given, (letter from the Resident dated the 21st June 1820), and in November of the same year our Resident forwarded (letter dated 1st November) the following order dated the 21st October, issued by His Highness the Guicowar to the Kamavisdars of districts, prohibiting the import of opium into his dominions:â€”' ; An arrangement is in progress under the authority of the Sirkar regarding opium. Therefore make known to merchants and others, that none is to be imported after the 1st of Asoo Shood (18th October 1820). If any one should introduce it, his property will be confiscated. This is to be proclaimed in * This information will be found in a letter from the Acting Resident at Baroda, dated the 21ith July 1820, reporting on a seizure of opium effected by the Collector of Ahmedabad in the Guicowar district of Kunee. 1 he proclamations are there recited at length.[ 9 ] tlie districts.'' In August 1820, the Resident at Baroda was informed, (letter to the Resi dent, dated the 16th August 1S20,) that as a relaxation from Regulations I. of 1818 and 11. of 1820 had led to the illicit export of opium, Government had resolved strictly to enforce them, and to furnish to the several Collectors the supply of opium required for internal consumption, for the purpose of being retailed by licensed venders. He was therefore directed to obtain the Guicowar's consent to the introduction of this plan into his territory; the opium required for the internal consumption of which should be furnished on indent forwarded through the Resident to the Collector of Kaira, on payment of the cost price in Malwa, and afterwards retailed at such rates as would check the inordinate use of the drug, and yet, besides yielding a profit to the retailer, be within the reach of those addicted to opium, and at the same time yield a revenue to the State. The Guicowar without demur signified his assent to the wishes of Government, (letter from the Resident at Baroda, dated the 29th September 1820,) but under certain stipulations, which were con curred in by Government on the 17th October 1820. I annex copy of this document to my minute. In the following year a circular (dated 4th September 1821) was issued, en joining the officers of Government to be vigilant in enforcing Regulations I. of 1818 and II. of 1820, with the view of checking the illicit trade in opium, and in order that all opium seized and all persons concerned in the illicit trade might be dealt with according to those Regulations. A similar notice was promulgated (letter from the Resident at Baroda, dated the 3rd October 1821) throughout his districts by His Highness the Guicowar. I am thus particular in establishing the fact that the restrictive system was introduced into the Guico war territory, because I shall in a subsequent part of my minute have to show that of late years it has from some unexplained cause been discontinued. It was likewise introduced into Cutch, into Kattiawar, the Mahee Kaunta; the petty States on the north-west frontier of Guzerat, including Pahlunpoor, in the Rewa Kaunta; the petty states of Balasinore, Chota Oodeepore, Barriah, and Rajpeempla; Cambay and Dh urumpore. In fact, it was introduced everywhere, except at the Portuguese settlements of Dieu and Damaun, where our control did not extend. Catch, â€”In 1819 our Resident, the late Captain MacMurdo, reported (letter dated the 23rd December 1819) that ' if it is any object to our interests, he was desired by the Cutch Government to state their readiness to prohibit in the strictest manner all exportation of opium from that province. 'This Â«ffer was accepted, (Mr. Secretary Parish's letter, dated the 17th January 1820,) with a suggestion that the transit of opium should be altogether prohibited in Cutch, the British Government undertaking to supply annually the quantity required for internal consumption. The Government of Cutch consented, (letter from the Resident, dated the 14th Pebruary 1820,) and issued a proclamation prohibiting the export of opium, either by sea or by land, and a penalty of confiscation and heavy fines. They, how ever, requested that their merchants might still be allowed to import the quantity required for internal consumption, which, according to estimate, was 350 maunds annually. They were, however, informed (Government letter, dated the 14th March 1820) in reply, that ' when the arrangements in progress for establishing a monopoly in this Presidency were completed, a supply of opium would be sent for the internal consumption of Cutch.' Short ly aftewards, the Resident was directed to obtain the assent of the Government of Cutch to the introduction ol the provisions of Regulation II. of 1820 into that province. Kattiawar. â€”I have already alluded (paragraph 20) to the discovery in 1820 of an exten sive illicit trade being carried on in this province. In consequence, the Political Agent was directed (resolution of Government, dated the 29th May 1820) to require the Chiefs of Kattiawar, and more especially the Jam of Nowanuggur, to empower him to extend Regu lation I. of 1818 and II. of 1820, and to seize all opium passing through their territories. A depot was about the same time established at Rajkote for supplying the internal consump tion of the province. This in 1829 was estimated at 480 maunds, (Political Agent's letter, dated the 22nd June 184C,) and in that year a statement was framed, apportioning this /r[ 10 ] quantity among the different Chiefs. This depot is supplied from Ahmedabad, and alf opium found in the province that has not been retailed from thence is contraband, and' subject to confiscation. In 1846, our Political Agent submitted four documents (dated 4th October 1821, llth June 1829, Gth December 1833, and the fourth without date) proving that the restrictive system is in full force throughout Kattiawar, and that all opium unpro tected by a pass is liable to seizure and confiscation. Mahee Kaujita.â€”As the officer now in charge of this district has reported that the re strictive system has virtually ceased to be maintained, it is necessary to enter into some detail. In the first instance, I would remark that as that system was undoubtedly introduced into the Guicowar territory, it is not likely that this province should have*been exempted from it, since it exclusively belongs to Chiefs tributary to the Guicowar, and therefore bound in such a matter to conform to his orders. Abundant proof, however, exists, that the province was not exempted. I find that when the restrictive system was, as above shown, introduced into Kattiawar, orders (dated the 2Dth May 1820) were issued for its introduction into the Mahee Kaunta. In the following year the Honorable Mr. Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, visited Guzerat, and in a minute (dated Lahaun, the 20th February 1820) detail ing the principles on which the Mahee Kaunta was to be settled, he specifies a stipulation that they should be required ' to prevent the illicit trade in opium.' 1 have disfcovered one engagement to this effect. (Letter from Captain Miles to the Resident at Baroda, dated the 20th May 1821.) It was entered into by the Chief of Petooee and his son, the 7th Article of which is as follows:â€”' I will not allow any trade in opium, except that regulated by the orders of the British Government.' 1 have no doubt that this was exacted under the orders of Mr. Elphinstone above quoted, and that this was the form in which our restrictive system was introduced generally into tlie Mahee Kaunta. The Political Agent (Major Lang) has, however, reported (letter dated the 4th April 1846) that he cannot ascertain thtit any separate arrangements were entered into with these Chiefs, rendering opium liable to confiscation, though he discovered, on renewing their security engagements, that they contained an article binding them, 'agreeably to the wish of Government, not to allow opium to pass with the mer chandize of travellers or traders, without a purwaneh or a seal, and to make efficient arrange ments within their respective limits that it is not secretly passed through them, and in all other respects to be guided by the orders they might receive from the Government.' There were also traces on his records of a prohibition of the traffic being intended during Colonel Bal- lantine's agency, as the Chiefs then bound themselves 'to attend to whatever is ordered by Government with regard to the traffic in opium.' In August 1821, I find that the Political Agent called (letter dated the 31st August, and Government reply thereto, dated the 12th October 1821) the attention of the Resident at Baroda to a proclamation he had submitted, giving effect to our Regulations regarding the transit and sale of opium, both in Kattiawar and the Mahee Kaunta. In reply he was directed to prevail on the Chiefs of both provinces to give effect to Regulations I. of 1818 and II. of 1820 in their limits. I shall presently show that these Regulations were about this time introduced into the Palhunpoor and other adjacent States by the officer who was at this time in charge of the Mahee Kaunta. In 1829 I was for a few months in charge of this district, and issued a proclamation to the Chiefs, reminding them of their engagement to prevent the traffic of opium for exportation by sea, and requiring them to prevent its illicit transport through their limits, and to seize all opium unprotected by a pass. The engagements taken from the Chiefs in 1830-, by Colonel Miles and Captain Prescott, contain a similar stipulation. It would appear, however, that no security engagement has ever been exacted from Edurand Ahmednuggur ; and although my proclamation was sent to both those Durbars, no agreement with them respecting the opium trade can be traced, and the Political Agent cannot ascertain that one was ever entered into by them. Palhunpore and the Petty States on the North-West Frontier of Guzerat. â€”The restric tive system was introduced into these districts in 1821. In the following year the Political[ 11 ] Agent was directed (letter from the Resident at Baroda, dated the 27th July 1822) to adopt further measures to ensure ' the entire suppression of the illicit traffic in opium.' He accordingly ^letter from Major Miles, dated the 21st September 1822) concluded engage ments with 1. Palhanpore, 8. Morewara, 2. Radhunpore, 9. Warye, 3. Daunta, 10. Chorwar, 4. Varue, 11. Charchut, V 5. Brump, 12. Terewara, 6. Poregaum, 13. Deodur, 7. Thuaud, 14. Babher, ln T which the Chiefs of these places bound themselves to prevent any opium passing through their limits, to use every exertion to put an entire stop to the transport of opium through their talookas, and, because merchants and others may conceal opium among other commo dities, strictly to examine all packages, and to confiscate any opium found therein. The Chiefs requested that the Mehtasof the British Government on the frontier might be directed to aid them in the detection and prevention of the transit of opium, and Major Miles recom mended that their request should be complied with. Rcica Kaunta. â€”This district is now managed by an Agent of the British Government, in the same manner as the Mahee Kaunta. It did not, however, come under our control until 1828-29. Our restrictive system was introduced, though at what period is not stated in any of the proceedings to which I have now access. I was, however, the first Agent appointed to this district, and I believe it was then introduced. But previous to this, as the district belonged to the Guicowar, it was of course included in the arrangements entered into with the Baroda State generally, for the preventing of the illicit trade in opium. The Political Agent reports (letter dated the 3rd August 1846):â€”' By the practice lately established, all opium unprotected by a pass from the Agent at Rutlam, certifying that the drug is intended for the consumption of the Native States, is made liable to confiscation wherever it may be detected.' It was made over to the Chief in whose jurisdiction the seizure is effected, a reasonable reward being granted to the informer. Loonawara, Barriah, Chota Oodeepore, and Rajpeempla, are petty States of some im portance included in the Rewa Kaunta Agency. The position of these four States, but especially the three first, being situated in the direct route of the opium trade, renders it of great importance that our arrangements for the prevention of the illicit traffic in opium by these routes should be as complete and perfect as possible. 1 have not been able to ascertain whether the restrictive system was extended to Loona wara. It most probably was, and the absence of precise information on the subject may be accounted for by the fact, that on the first adoption of that system Loonawara was superin tended from Malwa, and not from Guzerat. In March 1847 a considerable seizure (19^ maunds seers) of opium was reported by the Political Agent, (letter dated the 8th March 1847,) and the orders of Government requested for its disposal. The opium belonged to some merchants of Loonawara, who stated it to be the produce of Purtabghur, and when seized a portion of the consignment was on its way to Seerolee. On this occasion the Raja alleged that opium is frequently imported into his districts, and as it is difficult to deter mined what is contraband, he requested instructions, at the same time professing his desire to meet the wishes of Government. The Political Agent, deeming the proof insufficient for confiscation, recommended that the opium should be restored, but suggested that a procla mation should be issued ' declaring all opium unprotected by a pass from the authorities residing at the place where the purchases are made shall be deemed contraband, and liable to confiscation.' The Raja, in his letter dated the 28th January 1847, to the Political Agent, states:â€”' Agreeably to the orders of the Company's Government, proper measures will be taken that no trader can carry opium clandestinely, through my talooka, without a Government[ 12 ] pass or stamp. If any one be detected in carrying opium clandestinely, the same will be seized, and the matter be reported to Government. W liatever arrangements will be suggested by Government regarding opium, the same will be adopted by me, but measures should be taken to enable the traders to import opium without any inconvenience.' With respect to Barriah, the Resident at Baroda states (letter dated the 24th October 1846) that it is believed the restrictive system was introduced under an agreement entered into with the Political Authority in Malwa, which, however, is not now to be found in the records of the Agency. This is confirmed by the present Raja, who states (see Mr. Stewart's letter, dated the 7th November 1845, reporting the seizure of opium effected at Doodne) tliat,^ smuggled opium is seized, one-third being paid to the informer. 1 his.petty State was many years ago under my political charge, and I recollect very well that at that time the agree ment was enforced, and seizures frequently made. It was introduced into the petty State of Chota Oodeepore, under an agreement entered into through my mediation, dated Kartik Shood the 7th, Sumvut 1879, ( a. d . 21st November 1822,) by which the Chief bound himself (see Mr. Stewart's letter, dated the 9th December lS4o, reporting a seizure of opium effected at Chota Oodeepore) to prevent opium unprotected by a pass or stamp being clandestinely conveyed through his talooka, to seize and report to Government all opium so discovered, and to attend to whatever orders Government might issue on the subject of opium generally. The Raja states that all his officers of customs (Nackadars) have orders to the above effect, but that no attempts at smuggling have re cently been attempted. It will, however, be in the Board's recollection, that tlie present discussion originated in a seizure of a maund of opium imported into this talooka by a trader from Rutlam, and which was duly reported by the Raja to the Resident at Baroda. (Letter from the Resident at Baroda, dated the 16th November 1846.) An exactly similar engagement was likewise entered into through my mediation by the Rajpeempla State. It bears date the 9th Kartik Wud, Sumvut 1880, ( a. d . 12th November 1823,) and the Raja represents (letter dated the 24th October 1840) that opium is not imported in any large quantities into his districts, but that what is required for internal consumption is obtained from the neighbouring Guicowar's districts of Sinnore and Padea. The restrictive system was also introduced into the following petty States in Guzerat : â€” Balasinore. â€”By an agreement dated in August 1820, (letter from the Collector of Kaira, dated the 29th August 1820,) the Chief of that plac^ 1 agreed to regulate the opium trade in his district according to the provisions of Regulations I. of 1818 and II. of 1820 ; to permit the Officers of the Honorable Company to seize opium otherwise imported ; to obtain the supply required for internal consumption from the Government depot, and to retail it according to the rules in force in the Company's districts. Dhurruiiipore and Peinth. â€”The Chiefs of these places agreed to the restrictive system in November 1820, (letters from the Chiefs, dated the 29th November and 4th December 1820,) and their acquiescence was of the more importance from their territory being in the immediate vicinity of the settlement of Damaun, for many years the grand entrepot of the illicit trade in opium. Bhownuggur in Kattiawar was included in the arrangements made in that province gene rally; but in 1820, I find that the Thakoor specially prohibited the import of opium into his territory, except under license, and directed all opium not so imported to be seized. (Letter from the Collector of Ahmedabad, dated the 21st August 1820.) 27. Hence it appears that our restrictive system was adopted by every foreign State in Guzerat, Kattiawar, and Cutch. It was also introduced into the territory of the Sattara State in July 1820. A seizure of opium having been effected in that territory, the Resident was directed to suggest to His Highness the Raja the propriety of issuing a proclamation prohibiting the transit of opium through his territory, under the penalties in force in the Company's districts, except on payment of Rs. 12 per Surat seer. The rewards specified in Regulations I. of 1818 and 11. of 1820 were to be held out to informers, and all opium seized was to be[ 13 ] disposed of under security that It should only be used for infernal consumption, and not exported. The supply of opium required by the Sattara State was to be furnished from Bombay at its cost to Government, and be retailed by licensed venders, in the same manner as had been agreed to by the Guicowar Government. It further appears that about the same time the Commissioner in the Deccan was instructed to require the Jagheerdars in the Southern Mahratta Country to co-operate in the measures which had been adopted for preventing the illicit trade in opium. ' 28. The transit of Malwa opium was likewise prohibited in the Nizam's territories. In May 1820 the Resident at Hydrabad forwarded a note (letter from the Resident at Hydrabad, dated the 21st May, and Mr. Secretary Parish's replies, dated the 22nd May and 5th June 1820) from the Minister Chundoolall, consenting to this arrangement, notwithstanding the loss of revenue it would occasion. He received the thanks of Government for the concession, which were repeated on the Resident reporting that the Manager of the Nizam's districts of Aurungabad, and named Raja Govind Buksh, had carried the measure into effect. 29. Nothing, therefore, could be more comprehensive than the measures adopted for the protection of the opium monopoly. The restrictive system was imposed by law in British territory ; by special engagements in all foreign territory subordinate to this Presidency. 1 shall now proceed to show how far those engagements are in force at the present day. 30. Baroda Slate. â€”Here the restrictive system has in practice become almost altogether abandoned, but how or when I have not been able to discover. The Resident, however, reports (letter dated the 10th February 1844):â€”'some years ago the Guicowar was persuaded to adopt measures similar to our own, in regard to the retail sale of opium, and agreed to purchase supplies for internal consumption from our stores at Kaira. A proclamation was issued, prohibiting the importation of opium into the Guicowar territory on peril of forfei ture, the provisions of which were strictly enforced. This was in 1820 ; previous to which, however, the Guicowar Government had issued orders for the supplying of opium for internal consumption, and for a long time its sale continued fettered by restriction.' He then adds: ' A great alteration has taken place of late years in this respect. The restric tions on importation have been discontinued, and the provisions contained in the proclama tion are no longer enforced. A Sow # car may now import any quantity into His Highness territory without infringing the rules and orders of the Guicowar Government, and so relaxed has become the practice in this respect, that I am not prepared to say that even if the circumstances under which it travels should be equivocal, that we possess any authority to cause an embargo to be laid upon it out of our own territory.' The city of Baroda is now supplied by a contractor, who has obtained a monopoly for the exclusive sale of opium, in consideration of the payment of Rs. 18,000 annually. He obtains the drug from depots which exist at Bahdurva, Serolee, and Nandode, which are supplied by an Agent at Rutlam. The quantity annually consumed at Baroda is estimated to be 112 maunds. It is worthy of remark, that the Resident is not quite correct in stating that the restrictive system has been altogether abandoned iu the Guicowar territory, for I find an instance which occurred three years ago, in which it was recognized. In 1845 an extensive robbery of opium occurred at Bhewndy, and suspicion arose that the drug had been conveyed to the Guicowar district of Nowsaree. The fact was not clearly established, but His Highness the Guicowar, in the course of the discussion which ensued, informed the Resident, in a note, dated the 5th June 1845, that instructions had been issued to his Sursooba or local officer to adopt measures for the prevention of the smuggling of opium. On this occasion the Sursooba's reply ac knowledging the receipt of the order was furnished to the Resident, from which the following is an extract:â€”'Your Highness long since issued instructions forbidding the admission of smuggled opium into your districts, and the custom house officers of the Company keep a lookout. Still on the receipt of the Resident's note, dated the 23rd August 1844, a proclama tion was affixed in the Kusba of Nowsaree, warning the people, and copies thereof have been sent into the districts, and the inhabitants of Nowsaree have again been strictly warned.'[ '4 ] I allude more particularly to this recent recognition of the measures adopted in 1820, because it seems to me to strengthen the right of the British Government to require that the3 T should again be revived should this course be deemed advisable. Cutch. â€”The engagements entered into by this Government in 1819 do not appear to have been departed from, but remain in full force at the present day. The Political Agent states in a letter dated the l k 2th March 1841, that opium is not imported by land in such quantities as can supply any large export trade. Instead ot obtaining the supply required for internal consumption from the depot at Ahmedabad, it was obtained at a cheaper rate from Bombay, during the years 1840 and 1841. He does not think opium can be conveyed through Cutch in such large quantities as to be of importance, though he has heard that it is smuggled through Parkeen, direct from Marwar, and from Keraloo, a district belonging to His Highness the Guicowar, in Guzerat, where there is a depot for smuggled opium. The Cutch Durbar affords 'constant and ready co-operation ' in checking the illict trade in opium. Kaltiawar. â€”It would appear that the restrictive system in this province has very nearly fallen into abeyance, although the engagements ol 1820 have never been formally rescinded. The Political Agent reports (letter dated the 20th February 1841) that the great diminution which has of late years occurred in the quantity purchased from the Government depot at Rajcote proves that the internal consumption must be provided from other sources. The opium thus smuggled is of an inferior quality, and is therefore preferred on account of its cheapness. He does not, however, believe that it is brought into Kattiawar for ultimate exportation by sea, though he admits that there is scarcely any existing check against exportation. The following table exhibits the decrease which has occurred in the sale ol opium at the Government depot;â€” Quantity of Opium sold from the Depot at jRajcote in each year from 1824-25 to 1839-40.

He was therefore instructed to be vigilant in endeavouring to discover the means by which it was imported. The diminution in the sales at Rajcote is easily accounted for. In April 1841 the price of Malwa opium of good quality was from Rs. 4| to 5 per lb., and opium of inferior quality, rejected by the examiners as unsuited for the China Market, was obtainable for Rs. 3^ per lb. (Report from the Opium Agent, dated the 30th April 1841.) At this time the price at the Rajcote depot was Rs. 8-12-0 per lb. When such a strong temptation existed, it was impossible to prevent the illicit importation of the drug, especially in a coun try like Kattiawar, where all direct authority is vested in Chiefs, many of whom are addicted to the use of opium. The Political Agent truly states (letter dated the 3rd June 1841) our arrangements have not proved effectual, and that he is not aware of a single instance in which either the Chiefs or their Agents have aided in preventing the trade, though cases have occurred of their screening the smuggler. In 1828-29, 501^- maunds were issued from the depot; in 1840 only 6 maunds and 30 seers, although consumption has increased instead of diminishing. The inference, therefore, is inevitable, that if such a large quantity can be clandestinely introduced, it can also be exported whenever the state of the foreign market holds out a sufficient inducement. (Letter dated the 12th June 1841.) No check exists under the present system, and if this is allowed to continue, Kattiawar must be permitted to become ' a mart for the contraband trade of Malwa.' Large quantities of opium are stated to be stored up in the Guicowar towns of Veesanuggur, Kurree, and Beejapoor, but especially in[ 15 ] the latter, from whence it is conveyed into Kattiawar, chiefly through the district of Veerum- gaum. In 1844 the subject again came under discussion. The Political Agent submitted a statement (letter dated the 16th November 1844) showing that since the price of passes for Malwa opium had been raised, nearly ail the Chiefs had taken less from the depot than was allotted to them, the difference being supplied by smuggling. In 1846 the same officer stated (letter dated the 22nd June 1846) that no suspicion is entertained that opium is exported from any of the ports of Kattiawar to Demaun, but that from the small quantity c taken from the depot, it was clear that a considerable quantity is imported from Guzerat for internal consumption.* He admits, however, that no means exist except through the Chiefs for the prevention of any surplus being shipped at any of the ports, 'and more especially at Diu, for exportation to Demaun, and from thence to China.' Like his predecessor, he attributes the diminished sale of Government opium to the high price at which it is sold, and also to the inferior quality of the drug lately supplied. The monopoly of the retail sale is sold by the Chiefs to the highest bidder. The contractor adds Rs. 1 or 2 per seer to the Government prices, in order to cover his expenses, and thus, by further enhancing the price, encourages smuggling from Guzerat and Mahva. Several small seizures had been effected of better quality than that issued from the depot. From these causes combined, instead of 480 maunds* being sold for internal consumption, in 1840-41 only 6 maunds 30|- seers were disposed of; in 1841-42, 4 maunds 4 seers ; in 1842-43, 120 maunds 17 seers ; in 1843-44, 108 maun^ls 19 seers; in 1844-45, 63 maunds 29| seers; and in 1845-46, 70 maunds and 30 seers. Mahee Kaunta.â€”Yox some years past the restrictive system appears to have been altogether abandoned in this district. On the Political Agent being called upon to state what arrange ments were in force in regard to opium, and whether the system in Kattiawar had been intro duced here, he replied (letter from Government dated the 3rd November, and from the Political Agent dated the 30th November 1843) that ' opium is imported from Malwa and Meywar for retail sale, not only into the Mahee Kaunta, but also into the adjacent Guicowar's districts.' No restriction on the trade exists, unless the drug enters our districts, when if unprotected by a pass, it is liable to seizure and confiscation. The Kattiawar system there fore is not in force, and he is not aware of our possessing the right of seizing opium in the territory ot the Mahee Kaunta tributaries, more than in the neighbouring Guicowar districts. He thinks an interdict would now be unjust, unless arrangements are adopted for providing a- supply for internal consumption, and unless compensation is granted to the Chiefs for the loss they would sustain in transit duties. The Government appear to have admitted (letter dated the 10th January 1844) that so long as the trade is of a limited extent, and merely intended to supply what was wanted for local use, there might be no immediate necessity for prohibiting it. If, however, it was exported to the Coast through the Mahee Kaunta, Government must prohibit it; and the Political Agent was directed to watch the progress and course of the traffic, to report the quantity annually consumed, and the amount of duty realized by the Chiefs, with the view of deciding on the amount of compensation to be awarded to them in the event of the trade being prohibited. I have elsewhere shown Cparagraph 26, under the head Mahee Kaunta) that the Political Agent is in error in supposing that the restrictive system was not introduced into this district. At a later period this officer seems to have admitted his error, and supposes that the relaxation from that system may have been occasioned by the circumstance that no agreement (letter dated the 4th April 1846) was ever entered into by the Chiefs of Edur and Ahmed- nuggur, since as so large a portion of the Mahee Kaunta belongs to them, it would be comparatively useless to enforce the system in the smaller talookas. He adds (letter dated the 4th April 184G) that whatever the reason may be, the prohibition is now so little known, that should it be intended to revive it, the fullest information should be given to tiie Chiefs I have above stated that this is the quantity which in 1829 was estimated to be required for the internal consumption of the whole province of Kattiawar.[ 16 ] and traders before opium could with justice be seized in any part of the province.* Edur and Ahmednuggur must also be brought under restriction, and measures be adopted pro viding for the internal consumption, 40 chests or 140 maunds being, according to his estimate, required for this purpose. He repeats his opinion, that the Chiefs should be compensated for the loss they would thereby sustain. This would not probably exceed Rs. 5,000, the whole of the transit duties in the Mahee Kaunta being estimated at Rs. 25,000. They are, however, on the decrease, and he thinks he could negotiate for their total abolition for this sum, or even for less. There can be no doubt that tlie restrictive system has wholly been- abandoned in the Mahee Kaunta, though certainly without any authority. In fact, large quantities of opium are openly bought and sold at the annual fair held at Samlajee. My attention was drawn to this on the receipt of the report (dated the 10th November 184G) of this fair for 1846, which showed that no less than 400 maunds, valued at one lakh of Rupees, were disposed of. I suggested (minute dated the 8th December 1846) that the Political Agent should be called on to report from whence this opium was obtained, and under what restrictions against exportation it was sold. From that Officer's reply, dated the 28th De cember 1846, it would appear, that the opium in question is chiefly brought from Purtab- ghur and Dongurpore, that it is of inferior quality, and therefore more suited to the means of the petty Chiefs and Kolees of the Mahee Kaunta, who are much addicted to the use of opium. The retail dealers in opium provide themselves with a supply at the Samlajee fair. A large quantity also finds its way into the Guicowar districts, especially Beejapoor, ' the great mart for the sale of opium.' Some is also smuggled into the Company's districts, but it is not believed that anj^ is exported. He adds :â€”' As there are no orders against the intro duction of opium besides the amount sold at Samlajee, bullock loads of the drug are constantly imported by the Brinjarees during the fair season, and find a ready sale either in the Mahee Kaunta or Guicowar Districts.' In a subsequent letter (dated 7th July 1847) the Political Agent states, that all the opium imported into the Mahee Kaunta pays duty either to Edur or Ahmednuggur, and that there has of late years been a large increase in the quantity brought into the Edur territory, the farmer of the customs having reduced the duty. It is from thence sent to Beejapoor, and there is reason to believe that it is smuggled from that town into the Ahmedabad collectorate. A considerable portion of the opium sold at the Samlajee fair is also smuggled into that collectorate. This fair is rapidly becoming an entrepot for the drug, the assembly of merchants there facilitating the traffic. A guard is furnished for the protection of the trader, the withdrawal of which would discourage the traffic, but this would press more severely on the open and honest trader than on the smuggler. The Political Agent, however, advocates the encouragement of the trade, considering it preferable to have it carried on under certain regulations, than to attempt to suppress it, which on such a frontier would be difficult, if not impracticable. A register might be kept of the quantity sold ; the price, the name of the purchasers, and its destination, so as to guard against exportation. The following statement shows the quantity of opium transported through the Edur districts during the last nine years:â€” Years. Quantity Imported. Quantity retained. Quantity Exported. Maunds.

The present Political Agent attributes this to the fact that these Chiefs, partly from country, and partly from their rank, have been exempted from furnishing the general security bonds of 16 articles taken from all the other Chiefs, one of which relates to opium. He adds that he does not suppose they would resist any reasonable proposi* tion tor their co-operation.â€”Letter from Captain Wallace, dated the 7th July 1847, paragraph 4,/J3 69 * â–  â€¢ [ 17 ] Palhnnpore. â€”The restrictive system is still in force in this Agency. The Political Super intendent states (letter dated the 19th June 1846) that no smuggling has recently been detected by the Palee route. 'Large quantities of the drug, though ot an inferior quality, are produced in the Guicowar districts of Futtun, Sidhpore, and Beejapoor, which used to be smuggled into the Palhunpore district, where, being cheaper, it found a ready sale. To counteract this, the Devvan reduced the price of licenses for the retail sale from Rs. 100 to Rs. 10. This is paid in addition to a duty of Rs. 125 on each chest imported. By this reduction it is expected that the illicit trade from the Guicowar districts will be checked, ' as the Palee opium will ,be nearly as cheap as the inferior drug produced in those districts.' Rcum Kaunta. â€”The Political Agent states (letter dated the 16th January 1844) that opium is extensively imported by Sowcars into all the principal Guicowar towns, and into the petty states included in this Agency. The majority of the people being addicted to opium, the con sumption is considerable. It is chiefly purchased at Rutlam, and on payment there of a certain duty is allowed to be exported. The trade is free and unrestricted, no pass being required; and it can therefore be easily imported into those districts which are supplied from the Government stores,' or even with a view to exportation.' He alludes to the statement in a letter to the Government of India, dated the 24th July 1843, of the Resident at Indore, that 1.500 chests are annually taken into the Guicowar territory, and from thence exported. He cites the case of a Sowcar named Nuncelall Kissendass, who in 1843 imported 50 niaunds and 10 seers, ostensibly for internal consumption. The drug was purchased at Rutlam bv the Sowcar's agent, who paid the city duty due on it. It was conveyed in carts via Jabooa, Ragpoora, and Oodeepore, and was stopped at Sunkheira, a district belonging to the Guicowar. Not having entered British territory, it was held not to be contraband, and was released. It was valued at Rs. 25,000, and was detained within ten miles of the river Nerbudda, and was probably exported from some of the villages on its banks. 1 he Resident at Indore stated that Nuncelall was a man of questionable character; that he had reason to believe his name was made use of to screen his principal, and that it is hinted the opium was exported. ' As long as this liberty exists,' observes the Political Agent, ' under the plea of providing for internal consumption, there can be no difficulty in conveying to Baroda any quantity of opium ; and the Chiefs and their retainers being great consumers of the drug, it is not to be expected that they will impede the traffic unless constrained by treaty.' The duties levied at Rutlam are light, namely Rs. 3| on each chest protected by a British pass, and on other opium a transit duty of Rs. 6.j per maund, besides some trifling town dues. Opium purchased for the use of Native States is allowed a sort of drawback, and a premium is thus held out to the merchant for conveying opium from Malwa without a British pass to some favourable locality, when it may with facility and without much risk of detection be smuggled to the coast. A check therefore is required against the contra band trade, before the drug enters foreign territory. At present a iSowcar is merely required to produce the receipts of the authorities at the places through which the opium is conveyed, to prove that he is not engaged in the illicit trade, and so long as the importation and salo are confined to places not within British territory, it is difficult to say what constitutes smuggling, for even if duty is not paid at any naaka within a Native State, it would not necessary follow that it was intended for exportation by sea, and if not found in the posses sion of British subjects, whose identification would be difficult to establish, our right to confiscate it would be questionable. In a subsequent letter, dated the 3rd August 1846, the Political Agent reports that the quantity of opium imported for internal consumption has decreased, not, however, on account of a diminished demand, which on the contrary has increased, the majority of the population being addicted to the use of opium. The decrease is attributed by some to the enhancement of the price of passes, by others to the price in 1845 having fallen from Rs. 10 to 7 per seer, and by others to an increase of the quantity of opium produced in the territories of His Highness the Guicowar, and the Nawab of Cambay, and to the fact alleged by some that the culture of opium has since 1844 revived to some[ 18 ] extent in the Kaira zillali.* The Political Agent himself attributes the decrease, coupled Â«i,h a f.,11 of price, to increased activity in the illicit trade, though he has no proof of such trade either to a large extent, or on any organized system But Malwa op.um * douh ^ smnooled in small quantities by Gosaees.

Barriah, Chota Oodeepore, and Although, as already shown, the restrictive system exists, it does not appear to be very rigidly enforced within the limits o these pe .% ^ States, except perhaps at Oodeepore. The Karkoon at Barriah reports (letter ^ Re sident at Baroda, dated the 24th October 1846) that no measures are adopted to seue op,u and only two seizures have been made. He adds, however, that there are cliokees es a . i, led on this line, where opium illiciily imported is searched tor and seizoi. ie ai ooo a Kandodef states that no vigilance is used to seize smuggled opium ; the Karkoon at Jngeera that opium is imported from Sinnore, and is also brought by Bhats trom Malwa, annei of cloms levvim. a duty thereon. No measures are adopted to seize opium illicitly imported, but in case of seizure double duties are levied. The Karkoon stationed in the Rajpeempla hills reports very much to the same effect, but adds that the opium consumed within his charge is chiefly brought troni Nandode. 31. The preceding history of the past and present condition of the opium trade tinder this Presidency, however tedious, may perhaps facilitate a decision on what is the best pvstem to be pursued in regulating the trade for the future, and it is with this object in view tliat 1 have taken the trouble to compile it. In placing restrictions on the internal con sumption of the country, the Government chiefly desired to effect these 'hjects.- ' â€¢ repress a vicious habit; 2nd, to createa new source of revenue; and 3rd to protec ' '-'V monopoly, by preventing Malwa opium coming into competition with 'he opium of Bengal, in the China market. (Vide Mr. Pringle's report on the opium trade, dated the 9th December 1843.) Through an oversight, or the carelessness of our local Officers, our restrictive system has in the Guicowar territory and in the Mahee Kannta become a dead letter and in other foreign territory it is now only very partially enforced. It is, however, very donbtfu whe ther 'under the greatest care and vigilance, our restrictions on the opium trade could have been enforced in the full and complete manner orignClly C0,, | R 7 justly remarked by Mr. Pringle, (letter dated the 9th December 1843,) suirom y ioreion States, and not only surrounded, but having their territories projecting into and interspersed through ours in all directions, and without a preventive establishment to m.m- tain a monopoly price materially exceeding the natural and ordinary puce prevai ing m h e territories', especially in an article so valuable in proportion to its bulk as opium, the maintenance of a Monopoly is impracticable.'

In the same year the Collector of Broach obtained ten ciiests from Bombay, at an average cost of Rs. 1,365 per chest. 33. In 1843 a discussion occurred in the Revenue Department respecting the mode in which the Sural Coliectorate was supplied with opium. This originated in certain remarks contained in the Collector's annual report for 1842, to the effect that opium was illicitly imported into his districts to a large extent, and stating (letter from the Collector of Surat to the Revenue Commissioner, dated the 6th November 1843) that this was owing ' to the great difference in the price at which it was sold to the licensed venders from the Govern ment depot, and that.subsisting in the neighbouring foreign States.' To check this, the only remedy which occurred to him was to reduce the priee of the Government opium. The price is not uniform, but depends on the cost at which it is delivered into the depot, to which is added Rs. 2 per Surat seer,* equal to Rs. 4-5-10 per Indian seer. In other words, to the cost * at the place from whence the opium is obtained, the expense of transit to Surat is added, so that if it is supplied from Ahmedabad, as sometimes occurs, it would be sold at the price there and the expense of carriage to Surat, even though it had originally been obtained from Bombay. Thus the cost of transit is frequently doubled. 34. It must be obvious that opium sold under these contingencies could never compete with opium imported direct from Malwa. The Collector suggested (letter dated the 6th ^November 1843) that this erroneous system should be abandoned, and that for the future it should either be obtained by indent from the Opium Agent in Malwa, which would ensure that it should be of good quality, or that (and in his opinion this was the preferable course) the retail venders might be permitted to contract for a supply with persons engaged in the export trade to China; the opium being conveyed underpasses to be issued by the Opium Agent in Malwa, and to be delivered free of duty into the Government stores, after having been examined by a local committee. Under this plan, the Collector thought Government might expect to realize the prime cost, with a small advance to cover wastage. 35. But as has been observed by Mr. Pringle, 'it is the price in the Guicowar's districts, and not the price in Malwa, that must ultimately determine what may be imposed here, con sistently with the exclusion of illicit supplies, even though by the adoption of such a plan we should incur a loss. The anomalous effect of the present mode of fixing the price is apparent. It is not determined either by the iwtural value of the article, or the natural cost of pro duction, but at an advance on the cost incurred on it, up to the time of its reaching the Col lector's stores, and which may be enhanced by circumstances, by Government regulations, and by arrangements, so as to make the relative price of different consignments quite dispro portionate, and possibly in the inverse ratio of their respective intrinsic values. The Reve nue Commissioner illustrates this by the fact that at the time he wrote (December 1843) opium was sold from the Government depot at Surat at eight different prices, varying from Rs. 9-5-10 to Rs. 22-4-11 per seer, and, for aught that depended on the principle by which the price is fixed, the cheapest may be the best: as long as the cheap kind lasts, the dearest remains (as it has done for ten years) subject to deterioration and wastage, and occasionally the price so fixed may be below the market price. By this process the artificial price is not only disproportionate to the value of the article, and a bar to its disposal when the natural price is low, but tends to its disposal on disadvantageous terms, in the possible though more rare case of that price being comparatively high. 36. The Revenue'Commissioner, with the view of putting a stop to this anomalous state of things, recommended the abandonment of the monopoly, and the reduction of the sale price to the venders, to a standard little if at all exceeding that in the adjacent territories, though he at the same time intimates his doubts whether under this plan Government would derive any advantage from retaining the supply for retail in its own hands; and under * This is the duty levied according to the suggestion of the Government of India in 1817. I find that the Col- i lector of Kaira suggested that it should be added to the prime cost when retailed, and that Government sanctioned it.â€”Vide Collector's letter dated 31st August, and Government reply dated the 30th September 1820.[ 20 ] any circumstance Government must suffer loss, as it could not expect to obtain the drug so cheap as individuals. 37. Mr. Pringle's proposition necessarily involved the entire abandonment of two, and the partial relinquishment of the third, of the objects for which the restrictions on the opium trade were originally imposed. Instead of checking the inordinate use of the drug, consump tion was to be encouraged by a considerable reduction of price ; and instead of deriving revenue, a positive loss was to be incurred in effecting that reduction of price. With respect to the third, or the protection of our opium monopoly, by preventing Malwa opium being clandestinely exported to China, our means for accomplishing this wer^ obviously diminished by concentrating, as the Revenue Commissioner suggested, our efforts to prevent exporta tion at the outports. Nevertheless, the Government of 1843, fully appreciating the diffi culties which existed in maintaining the restrictive system, concurred in Mr. Pri ngle's views. It was observed that the attempt to restrict the retail sale of opium to what is derived from the Government Stores must fail, and that the idea of deriving a revenue from such sale must prove fallacious, and if so, ought to be abandoned ; and it was admitted that the attempt to check consumption in a country where our villages are so much intermixed with those of Native States must also be equally useless. Thus abandoning the two first objects of the restrictive system, the Government observed, that in regard to the third, and perhaps the most important, on the protection of the Bengal monopoly, it must be obvious that if Malwa opium were allowed free access to the districts in the immediate vicinity of the outports, we could not. prevent its reaching China. The attainment, of this object, therefore, was incompatible with the abolition of the restrictions on sale for internal consumption, but Government were disposed to favour the plan of allowing opium to be imported under permits from the adjacent foreign villages to he retailed by license, but with a prohibition against its transit to the coast for exportation. Under this plan the Government depots might be abolished, the licensed venders obtaining their supplies from the places where it is produced. The views of Government were communicated to the Revenue Commissioner, (letter dated the 6th May 1844.) with instructions, unless any objection occurred to him, to prepare a plan under which Government might withdraw altogether from the supply of the retail trade, means being at the same time provided against opium imported for internal consumption being afterwards exported. I have not been able to discover on the records of Government any reply from the Revenue Commissioner to this communication. 38. That Government was disappointed in its object in deriving a revenue from supply ing the retail trade in opium is established by a report, dated the 9th August 1844, from the Accountant General, exhibiting the actual result of our opium transactions for fives years, namely 1839-40, 1840-41, 1841-42,1842-43, 1843-44. During this period the Government sustained an aggregate loss in the four Collectorates of Gnzerat, (Ahmedabad, Kaira, Broach, and Surat,) and in Kattiawar, of Rs. 47,654-13-5, and to this must be added the sum of Rs. 42,948-2-6, the actual amount of loss incurred very lately in the resale of a quantity of opium of bad quality purchased by the Opium Agent in Bombay for the depot at Ahmedabad. (Vide letter from the Collector of Customs, dated the 8th May 1848.) 39. An alteration, therefore, in the present system of providing opium for internal con sumption, seems necessary on financial grounds ; and the only question which arises is, how this can be effected without giving an impetus to the illicit trade, which there is too much reason to believe is already very great? On this point a few remarks may be'useful. The existing checks against smuggling are very defective. Mr. Hamilton, the Resident at Indore, has no doubt of the existence of an extensive contraband trade. (Letter dated the 22nd August 1844.) The average quantity of opium annually produced in Malwa is estimated at 30,000 chests, of which about one-half was in 1844 exported under passes, and between 4,000* and 5,000 smuggled. To check the contraband trade, the Resident proposed to subject all opium exported from Malwa to an uniform rate of duty, and to establish a cordon to enforce the â™¦ The difference of 10,000 chests is unaccounted for. Is it consumed in Malwa?[ 21 ] measure. lie further suggested that ofiieers should be stationed at Mundesore and Oojeiu, to watch the trade; that all persons who desired to send opium to be weighed at Rutlam or Indore should give notice of the number of chests, and receive a pass specifying the number, and the names of the persons to whom they belonged, which pass was to be delivered by the proprietor when the opium was brought to the scales. Further, that all opium found in transit unprotected by a pass should be declared liable to double duties, or to confiscation, a portion of the proceeds being awarded to tlie informer. The Resident likewise proposed that ' two other officers should be stationed, one at Nolye, or Bhownuggur, the other at Kooshalghur, to watch the opium trade when in transit. He added that the Nawab of Jowra had offered to defray the expense of a weighing establishment at Jowra, and that lie had no doubt Scindia's Government would desire to have a similar establishment at Oojein and Mundesore. Extensive smuggling is carried on from Nolye, from whence the route to the coast from Rutlam, Oojein, Jabooah, Puttun, &amp;c. diverges via Kooshalghur to Baroda. Finally, for the convenience of those engaged in the trade, he recommended that the number of places for weighing opium should be augmented, and that measures should be adopted in concert with the Native States for the confiscation of contraband opium, the proceeds being equally divided between the State in whose territory the opium was seized and the British Govern ment, after deducting a reward to the informer. If the principle of this scheme was approved of by Government, he did not apprehend of any difficulty in carrying it out. 40. It appears also that the Bombay Government, with the view of cheeking the illicit trade from the Guieowar's districts, suggested (letter dated the 27th May 1844) to the Government of India, that the Government of Indore should be moved to prohibit the export of opium from Rutlam, except under pass. It was observed that under the existing system opium may without molestation be exported into the Nizam's territory, Gwalior, Nagpore, and the Saugor and Nerbudda Districts. Large quantities were also formerly exported from Pallee, but since 1838-39 it is stated that no export of the drug is entered at that place ex cept in one year, 1841-42, though it is believed exports are made annually. The export to Hyderabad is said to have latterly fallen off, in consequence of the cultivation of poppy having been partially introduced into the Nizam's territory. 41. I have not been able to ascertain from our records whether at this time auy, and if so what, reply was returned to this communication. In 1845, however, the opinion of this Government was requested, (letter dated the 26th April 184 3,) whether, in advertence to the fact that no increase of smuggling had followed the increase of the price of passes from Rs. 125 to Rs. 200, 'taken in connection with the prosperous state of the opium trade ge nerally, and the high price which Malvva opium has fetched in China, together with the fact that the possession of Scinde by the British troops has closed the circuitous route by which opium used to be taken through that country, the price of the pass might not be increased yet further with corresponding advantage to the revenue.' 42. On this occasion, the Government of India observed, with reference to the suggestion of this Government above alluded to, that it involved the establishment of a restrictive system in Malwa and in the adjoining States very similar to that which existed formerly, when Go vernment secured to itself the pre-emption of the Malwa opium. The evils of that system, the extreme reluctance with which the Native States submitted to it, and the sanguinary feuds which it occasioned, led to the abandonment of the restrictions in 1829, and are against the expediency of reviving them. It was at the same time remarked, that duty is levied on opium exported by sea, and that the Bombay Government possess the chief port for its shipment, the direct route to which from Malwa lies through British territory. The present system, by which the direct route is opened for the transit of opium on payment of a certain amount, is a fair arrangement; but to prohibit the export of all opium from Malwa, without reference to its destination, would be to lose sight of the principle on which the arrangement is based. It was never intended to interfere with opium retained for consumption in Malwa or adjoin ing States, because such opium could never interfere with the Bengal monopoly, and with[ 22 ] prices in China. If opium is smuggled from Malwa and the adjoining States, this would not seem to justify a general prohibition against its export from Malwa m whatever d.reC.on, except on payment of duty ; but rather to demand increased vigdance to prevent smngg ing into British territory. . , . 43 The Honorable Court of Directors, concurring in these views, entirely approved (letteia to the Government of India, dated the 17th June 1846) of the Government ot India having declined to authorise any attempt to obtain the co-operation of Native States in measures or preventing the transit from Malwa to the sea of opium unprotected by a pass observing, that the evil effects of the restrictive system, which rendered its abandonment in K â€” com pulsory, should operate as a warning against resorting to any proceedings for the prevention of smuggling beyond the adoption of suitable precautious, and the exercise ol due vigilance within our territory. t , 44. The principal routes by which Malwa opium is conveyed to Guzerat appeal to be the following :â€” i . i t i o j f i Mahee Kaunta. (Letter from the Political Agent at Palhunpore, dated the Srd le )- ruarv 1844.)-It is broughtâ„¢! Megraj, Bakrola, Roopaul, and Ahmednuggur,to Beejapore, where, as I have already shown, a large stock is kept in depot, and sold lor retail in the Ouicowar territory and in the Mahee Kaunta of late years ; also a considerable quantity is openlv bought and sold at the fair annually held at Samlajee, but the Political Superin tendent believes that this is chiefly obtained from Mey war, the opium of which province is inferior to that of Malwa. The opium of Meywar is likewise introduced into the Mahee Kaunta via Pole. m * a \ r\ - Baroda. (Letter from the Resident at Baroda, dated the 10th February 1844 )-Opium is imported direct from Rutlam via Dohnd, Barriah, Mulloo, and Jeynode. It is likewise imported from Indore, via Allee-Mohun, Oodeypore, and Jun-Khuna, but of late jcais this route has been quite deserted, that of Barriah being preferred. Palhunpore. (Letter from the Political Agent, dated the - ith October 1843.)â€”There are two routes by which it is imported from Rutlam, one via Banswarra, Sangwarra, and Don^urpoor, and from thence through bye-roads to Beejapore, where a great trade in smu -led opium is carried on, and from whence it is sent for sale into the Gu .cowar districts, and even into Kattiawar. The other is ciÂ« Godra, and from thence into all the districts smith of the river Mahee. By the first it is conveyed either on camels or bullocks, but eenerallv the latter, in baskets containing about 3* maunds. The Political Superintendent States that it is brought chiefly for internal consumption, ' little, if any, finding its way to the coast for export.' In former times, when the Uamaun trade flourished, the c rug was clandestinely conveyed ' by Bigarees' via Rajpeempla, Mandavee, Beara Metapore, \ ansda, and Dhurrumpore. (Letter from Mr. Langford, dated the 23rd March 1841.) I he Raj- neempla route, however, is stated to have been rarely resorted to: the difficult country to &gt;c traversed, the many Chiefs requiring to be bribed, and the expense of carriage, rendered the undertaking unprofitable. The principal route adopted was through Kattiawar, onter- ino- the province to the north of Drangdra, and proceeding by Moorvee and Joonaghur to one oflhe southern ports. The drug was conveyed on camels, often as many as 100 at a time, ,ricked in dubbers with a small quantity of ghee at the top of each, to give the semblance ot he parties in charge being traders in that article. The trade was connived at by the Chiefs 1 Kattiawar, in consideration of the douceurs they received. This traffic, however, was extiu- o-uished under the operation of Regulation XX. of 1830, and the restrictive measures adopted Tn smioort of it. In 1841, the Collector of Continental Customs stated his belief (lettei dated the 0 8th March 1841) that it had ceased chiefly from two causes: ls&lt;, from dimiuisiet demand in China ; and 2nd, from the difficulty experienced by those engaged in the illicit trade in passing the drug by the Scinde route since our occupation* of that country. I his * This refers to a period prior to the conquest of Scinde, to which the snpport of our opium monopoly lias been erroneously ascribed./&lt;// ZL t 23 ] lias deterred the smugglers incurring the hazard of late years, of frequenting the route they formerly took, which 'crossed the Runn a little to the north of Nuggur Parkur, from which the contrabandists passed by a south-west course to the Indus, and thence to Kurrachee, from which port the drug was shipped to Damaun.' At present (letter from the Collector of Continental Customs and Excise, dated the 14th August 1846) opium is sold in Damaun by five or six licensed venders, at a price very little exceeding that for which it is sold in Malwa. It is said to be brought from Nowsaree, Cambay, and Jumboosur, and perhaps rom Khandeish, where it is obtained at a less price than in Malwa. The officer from whose report this information is taken states that he cannot learn that the Damaun traffic has revived. We should, however, so shape our measures as not to incur the risk of this trade being by any means revived. 45. The information I have now furnished will probabty assist the Government of India in determining whether any, and what, modifications are expedient in the existing system under which the opium trade of this Presidency is regulated. With the view of more efficiently protecting the Bengal monopoly, and at the same time securing the considerable revenue we now derive from Malwa opium, under the pass plan, and, if possible, augmenting it, by checking still further the illicit trade, it is obvious that when the orders quoted in the 42nd paragraph of my minute were issued, the Government of India were not aware of the extreme difficulty of preventing the contraband trade, if our efforts are exclusively confined to British territory, and they do not appear to have been fully aware that our restrictions were extended to the whole of the foreign territory subordinate to this Presidency ; and that although in some parts these have of late 3 r ears fallen into abeyance, in others they are enforced up to the present day. In no case, moreover, have the original engagements entered into in support of our attempts to protect the opium monopoly been formally rescinded ; and I may add, that I am not aware that any of the evils noticed in the Govern ment of India's letter of the 26th April 1845 have been found to result here from those encasements. o O 46. On this subject the Resident at Baroda has observed :â€”' The relaxation of former Regulations being calculated to lead to the illicit export of opium, a prohibition should, I think, be issued against its entering.the country at all, on the same principles that obtained when His Highness' proclamation was in force. It ought to be enactedâ€”His Highness the Guicowar being a party to the arrangementâ€”that every purchaser of opium in Malwa be required to procure a pass from the Superintendent at Rutlam, to be produced when required at every naka, at the risk of all his goods being declared contraband. Not only the Guicowar Government, but the various Suwusthans [Native States], should also be requested to acquiesce in these measures against illicit importation, for nothing will effect its entire suppression, but a general system which shall have operation over all the country. If vigorous measures such as these be pursued, and proper vigilance exercised on the part of our local officers, the irregular sources of supply will no doubt be effectually cut off.' (Letter from Mr. Remington, Acting Resident at Baroda, dated the 10th February 1844; see also on this subject Mr. Remington's letter dated the 16th January 1844.) With respect to the Rewa Kanta, Mr. Remington remarks in the same letter:â€”' Any vigilance exercised by us with a view to prevent smuggling through their districts could scarcely be felt as a hardship.' Even as-it is, the Barriah and Oodeepore routes are watched, and seizures have been effected at Barriah without any objection on the part of that State. The Collector of Surat remarks (letter dated the 31st May 1846) on the same subject:â€”' As the Native Chiefs have a perfect right to deal as they please with smuggled goods detected within their respective jurisdictions, there seems to be no obstacle to pursuing the course proposed in regard to seizures of opium, nor are any objections to be anticipated on the part of the Chiefs themselves to the disposal of the drug in the manner recommended.' 47. The following extract from a letter from the Resident at Indore, dated the 9th December 1845, indicates the necessity of our obtaining definite instructions from the[ 24 ] Government of India:â€”'The question, what constitutes smuggling in opium, or under what circumstances opium uncovered by a British passport may be seized in a foreign State by servants of the British Government, is a question on which I confess 1 do not yet clearly understand the views of Government.' He then refers to the letter from the Government of India to this Government, (letter from Mr. Secretary Busiiby, dated the '2Gtii April 1845,) stating' that opium uncovered by a pass found in British territory is alone liable to confiscation, and that no opium in transit in independent States, for internal consumption, can be seized by a British functionary, if this be the rule, some opium which had been seized in Barriah,- he observed, was not liable to seizure, although he had supposed, for the protection of the revenue derived from passes, that all opium unprotected by a pass should be considered con traband. Mr. Hamilton therefore requested this Government to give him an exposition of its views on this subject, in order that an uniform rule might be enforced by all parties. 48. For my views on the entire abandonment of our restrictions in foreign territory, 1 beg to refer to my minutes dated the 27th and '28th* July 1846. These have been greatly strengthened, by the inducement to smuggling having been much increased, by the price of passes for Malwa opium having been intermediately raised to Rs. 400. Even in our own territory the enforcement of the restrictive policy has been rendered the more difficult by the abolition of transit duties, and the preventive establishments maintained for their collec tion, and I see no reason whatever for modifying the opinion 1 have already recorded, that extending the orders of the Honorable Court of Directors of June 1846 to foreign territory, beyond the limits of Malwa, will inevitably be followed by a large increase of the contraband trade. In fact, scarcely any obstacle will exist against the wary and adroit smuggler con- veving opium to the coast, in more than one direction. It is for superior authority to determine whether the evils likely to arise from the continuance of the restrictive system, especially on the main lines of traffic, or the diminution of our opium revenue, are worthy of most consideration. 49. With respect to providing the supply of opium for internal consumption of Guzerat and Kattiawar, I am disposed to think a change of the present system is expedient. r ihe Government depots ought to be abolished, but if they are continued, we are bound to supply a good article at a reasonable price. If we do not do this, the smuggler will, as at present, continue to compete with us. In 1846 the price at the Ilajcote depot was Rs. 9-6-0 per seer of 36 Rupees' weight, (letter from the Political Agent, dated the 22nd June 1844,) when at Beejapore it was procurable for Rs. 7 per seer of 40 Rupees' weight; supposing the depots abolished, should those who deal in opium be permitted to supply themselves in whatever way may best suit their interests, and without restrictions ? 1 should be inclined to answer in the affirmative, did I not apprehend that, if wholly unfettered, exportation by sea of opium introduced ostensibly for internal consumption would clandestinely take place. 50. It will probably, therefore, be judged expedient to retain a surveillance over the retail trade, by requiring that persons about to import opium should take out passes, specifying the quantity, and the place from whence the opium is to be imported. This would operate as some check against exportation, for the quantity really required for internal consumption must by this time have been ascertained with sufficient accuracy. r i hose who retail opium will still, I presume, be required to take out licenses, though it occurs to me that a better plan might be to adopt the system which I believe prevails in the Deccan, and which is in force at Baroda, namely, to sell the privilege of the exclusive sale of the drug annually to 'he highest bidders within certain limits, in the same manner as is adopted in the case of spirits in the interior, and in that of tobacco at the Presidency. Under this system every purchaser of the monopoly would possess an interest in co-operating with Government in checking the illicit trade in opium. Before any change, however, is effected, it will be desirable to obtain the opinion of both Revenue Commissioners on the expediency of its adoption, and they might at the same time be requested to submit a statement of the revenue * This has not yet beeu recorded, and I therefore annex it to my present Minute.which has been obtained during the last five years from the Sr Â»Ie of retail licenses in Guzeraf, and for the exclusive sale of opium in the Deccan, The circular suggested in the 23rd paragraph of my minute, to ascertain the effects resulting from raising the price of passes for Malvvu Opium from lis. 300 to Rs. 400 per chest, might at the same time be issued. 51. There is only one other point requiring notice before I conclude this minute, namely the difficulty of identifying opium as pass opium after it has been imported into Bombay. From a memorandum dated the 3rd February 1844, of the Opium Agent in Bombay, it is &lt;Hnanifest that no effectual check exists in regard to the disposal of opium after its entry into Bombay, whilst the abolition of transit under Regulation I. of 1830, and consequent abo lition of all customs stations inland, must have greatly facilitated the conveyance of opium to the coast clandestinely. In one of his reports, dated the 5th July 1844, the Collector of Surat stated that on one occasion, when the price of passes was raised, opium was not procurable on any terms; and this induced him to believe that it was all bought up for exportation, and if so, it could only have been exported to Bombay, where a large quantity clandestinely imported is believed to be always procurable. It is desirable that Government should possess the means of tracing every pound of opium imported from Malwa, and at one time, to effect this object, it was proposed to establish warehouses in which alone the drug on importation could be legally depositedâ€”reviving, in fact, Section II. Clause 1st ot Regulation XXI. of 1827, which, as far as related to Malwa opium, was rescinded by Regulation XX. of 1830. To obviate the difficulty which might arise from the necessity of opening, repacking, drying, and examining each chest previous to export to China, it was proposed to grant permits for the removal of the drug from the warehouses, to admit of these processes, as well as for transfers by sale from one party to another. The Opium Agent was required (Government letter, dated the 21st March 1844) to draft an Act, which would secure a complete control over all opium from its first entry into British territory until its export to China, or its removal for internal consumption. After some amendments, the Act prepared under these instructions was submitted to the Government of India, (letter to the Government of India, dated the 31st July 1844,) but I am informed the subject has never been noticed by that authority. The object of the Act was two-fold : to prevent smuggling, and to check the robbery of opium when in transit, by rendering it difficult to dispose of it in Bombay. (Signed) J. P. WILLOUGHBY. 20M July 1848. Translation of an A nswer from the Guicowar Government to the Memorandum regarding the prohibition of the import of Opium, dated \lth Zillay 1235 (25iA September 1820), consist ing of the following Articles:â€” A rticle of S tipulation. Article I.â€”Opium must not be supplied from the Company's warehouse, or by mer chants, subjects of the Company, to the merchants and subjects of the Guicowar: these are to be supplied with opium by the Guicowar Government. Article II.â€”Whatever opium is required for the Guicowar warehouse to be obtained from the Collector of Kaira, through the Observations. I. This seems to be equitable, but the object may be secured without regulation. The price of opium being the same in the territories of both Governments, each Go vernment will establish its depots where its subjects can be supplied most conveniently. II. On the advisability or otherwise of the first part of this Article the Honorable Board will determine. A considerations [ 20 ] agency ofa Vakeel of the Gnicowar. Should there be a deficiency of opium in the ware houses (of both Governments), and it should be necessary to procure opium from Malwa, a dustuck is to be given, permitting the purchase, and the free passage ot the articles. Article III.â€”The Guicowar Government will purchase the opium at present in the Guicowar districts, and until it is consumed will not purchase from the Company's stores. Article IV.â€”Opium is produced in some parts of the Guicowar territories, and it is requested, therefore, that no objection may be made: this continuing to be the case, when the article is ready it will be purchased by the Government, to which it is requested that no objection may be made. Article V.â€”The price of opium to be the same in the territories of the two Govern ments. Article VI.â€”It is requested that the price at which opium is sold to the merchants and ryots at Kaira, Broach, and other places where the Government warehouses will be established, and the Malwa price, may be communicated to this Government every month. Article VII.â€”Any merchants or indivi duals .introducing opium secretly lor sale into the Guicowar territories to be subject to have the property confiscated, and any opium brought secretly from the Company's districts for sale to be confiscated in like manner, without any objection on the part of the British Government, occurs, that if it were made worth the A akrel's while to attempt to evade a due execution of the arrangement, by supplying individuals, there is no security against his so doing. The latter part of the Article is unnecessary, as Government will guard against the contingency supposed, but His Highness may be assured, that the same measures willK be adopted, in the event of such an occur- ' rence taking place, lor the supply ol his subjects as for those of the Honorable Company. III. Upon this point such measures as will be pursued by Government with regard to its subjects may be communicated to the Guicowar, and recommended to be adopted by him. IV. The district of Pitlaud is said to be capable of producing opium, but I never heard of any being cultivated. The Guico war possibly looks forward to some advantage from this source, but if so, he will, I think, be disappointed, for the opium would never be equal to the Malwa opium, and the expense of preparing it would be greater. V. This seems to be equitable, and con formable, I believe, to the wishes of Govern ment. VI. The requisite arrangement in this respect will doubtless be made. VII. The first part of this Article, apply ing to persons illegally importing and selling opium not procured from the public stores, is proper. The second part of it, if meant to apply (as it probably is) to persons who have purchased opium from the Company's warehouses, is unnecessary; for if the opium be sold at the warehouses of both Govern ments at the same price, it can never be consistent with the interest of merchants to convey opium from a warehouse of the Com pany's into a Guicowar's district, which will in all probability be more conveniently sup plied by the warehouse of the Guicowar Government. Suchimportation,atleast,could not take place, supposing arrangements to be[ 27 ] Article VIII.â€”A Vakeel of the Guicowar Government to be stationed at Kaira, and wherever there is a warehouse of the British Government, and opium to be supplied for the Guicowar districts through his means. No opium to be supplied by other means to merchants and ryots. made, except on the very borders of the Guicowar territories, in small villages which might be remote from a warehouse of the Guicowar, and need not therefore be guarded against. It seems to be one great advantage o o o of the price of opium being fixed at the same standard in the British and Guicowar dis tricts, that it will supersede the necessity of attempting to prevent these importations, and afford neither motive for fraud on the part of the merchant, nor cause for restraint and severity on the part of Government. VIII. The first part of this Article is the same as the first part of Article II. The second part of it will be answered by the answer of Government to the second part of Article VII. Baroda Residency, 29M September 1820. (Signed) Charles Norris, Acting Resident. Miwfe, Mth October. â€”Re-perused the letter from Mr. Acting Secretary Brown to the Supreme Government, dated the 17th of October, recorded in the Public Depatment, under date the 19th of November 1805. Ordered, that Mr. Norris be informed that the Governor in Council is not aware of any objection to the adoption of any of the propositions brought forward by the Guicowar Go vernment connected with the object^of prohibiting the traffic in Malwa opium, nor to the manufacture of opium in the Guicowar territories to an extent sufficient fur the consumption of His Highness' territories. The seventh Article does not appear objectionable: all opium attempted to be secretly carried from the one territory to the other should be confiscated. The property purchased in either could easily be protected by dustucks, permitting the free passage of it to its destination.MINUTE BY THE HONORABLE MR. REID, D ated 21 s.t S eptember 1848. 1. The Supreme Government has called for information on the whole opium system of this Presidency, which embraces two great questions, relative to th'e regulation of the inter nal production and consumption of this drug within our districts, and to the security of our revenue, derived from the export trade to China. Mr. Willoughby's Minute of the 20th July last contains an able exposition of our present position in respect to them ; but I would beg to submit a few further remarks upon them, since they are both at the present time in a most unsatisfactory state. 2. The latter question affects that opium only which is the produce of Malwa, since that alone now enters into the China trade, the export of all other being prohibited. The former affects not only the Malwa produce, which enters to some small extent into our home consumption, but also the produce of British territory, whether in Guzerat, Khandeish or the Deccan, and that also of numerous Native States which border on, or are mixed up with, that territory. 3. The engagements which were entered into with the Guicowar and other States in O O Guzerat, Kattiawar, kc. were originally intended to be in support of the monopoly which the British Government then held of the whole produce of Malwa. This it had acquired the exclusive right of purchasing from the cultivators, and it prepared it on its own account, and despatched it to Bombay, where periodical sales were held similar to those now held in Calcutta. The inconveniences of this system, as causing an interference in the affairs of the Native Governments, and producing ill-will in the minds of the Chiefs and their subjects, induced the Government to abandon the monopoly, and to throw open the trade in Malwa, substituting the pass system, under which the drug was allowed a transit through British territory to the port of shipment, &amp;c. (Regulation XX. 1830.) 4. It is possible that the abandonment of the monopoly may in some measure have led to the neglect of the engagements with those Native States who had bound themselves to assist in its maintenance. The substitution of the pass system, by throwing open the trade from the place of production, may have been viewed as authorising a relaxation of the existing restrictions, though in reality so long as ready means existed of conveying the opium of Malwa to the rival port ofDamauu, those restrictions were almost as necessary to us under the one system as under the other. 5. It will be for the Supreme Government to determine how far it may be expedient or just to insist on the continuance of all such restrictions where they still exist; their revival where, having once existed, they have fallen into disuse; and their extension to those States with whom n&lt;o arrangements have heretofore been concluded, but whose co-operation is requisite, in order to make the system of restriction perfect. 6. The expediency of such measures is dependent on our power, without their aid, of preventing the export of the produce of Malwa to China. We now possess the control of the whole sea-board of the western coast from this side of Sonmeeanee to Cape Comorin, and if that control were efficient, there would be no possibility of that produce finding its way by sea to any port, such as Damaun or Goa, whence it could be taken to China; and we might safely leave the Native States in our neighbourhood unfettered in all matters con nected with the transit of opium through their territories, since Goa and Damaun, the only[ 2 ] two ports at which a foreign opium trade could spring up, are not approachable by land, except through British territory. 7. But we have not that complete control over the sea-board of this Presidency; we have no direct power over the ports of Kattiawar and Kutch, belonging to Native States; and if we were to admit the free passage of Malwa opium by land through those States, there would be nothing to prevent every seer of such opium travelling by a circuitous route along the skirts of British territory to their ports, and thence to Damaun. I apprehend, therefore, that it will be impossible altogether to abandon the system of restrictive arrangements in Native States, and that it will be found expedient, if it is practicable, to render them general and complete. 8. I am aware that both the Supreme Government and the Honorable Court have ex pressed themselves opposed to any attempt to obtain the co-operation of the Native States in measures for preventing the transit of Malwa opium to the sea uncovered by our passes. The principle on which this opposition is founded, if fully carried out, would oblige us not only to refrain from any new engagements, but also to cancel all now existing ; and this would soon be followed by a revival of the trade at Damaun. and the destruction of our opium pass revenue. 9. It does not appear from Mr. Willoughby's summary by what means we procured the assent of the different States to our restrictive measures. We seem not to have paid them any compensation, nor to have made to them any corresponding sacrifices. We asked them to support our monopoly, and they readily consented. But it may be doubted whether in any case such consent can be deemed perpetual, and binding for all time on the Native States. No solemn treaties or engagements based on the exchange of mutual advantage have been entered into. Evils to them or their subjects, not then contemplated by the Chieftains, may have since become apparent, and they may desire to recede from engagements entered into for the support of a system no longer existing. This may be more particularly the case where we have ourselves allowed those enofao-ements to fall into disuse. o o 10. I question whether, if we determine (which I fear we must do in order to secure our pass revenue) to prevent the transit to the coast of all Malwa opium not covered by a pass, we shall not have again t6 enter into specific engagements with all Native Chiefs through whose districts the drug can proceed, based upon the principle of mutual convenience and reciprocal profit. We have no right to expect, that in order to uphold a system from which w T e derive an enormous revenue, they will subject themselves or their people to loss or inconvenience, without receiving from us a reasonable compensation. If we require their co-operation, we must be prepared to pay them what it is worth. 11. However perfect may be our arrangements with those Native States which have ports of their own, or whose lands approacli our ports so closely that the transit across can be a matter of little difficulty, we shall have done little towards forcing the whole produce of Malwa to our emporium, Bombay, under pass, unless we have the means of preventing all opium not covered by a pass from finding its way to other places on the coast through our own territory. 12. This was a matter of comparatively easy accomplishment when we had our custom stations on the Malwa frontier, and at numerous places at short distances from each other along every route, at which all merchandize was subject to examination, and when, more over, after reaching the coast, every article of traffic was subject to a duty, if taken by sea to any other port. But the case is much altered now that not a single custom naka exists throughout the whole length and breadth of our territory, with the exception of a few on the Damaun and Goa frontiers, and that after goods have arrived at the sea side they may be exported without payment of duty, and therefore are subjected to no rigorous examination. 13. For this state of things it is most difficult to find a remedy : vigilance can do nothing, for there are no means of exerting it. There are no persons whose duty it is to be vigilant. W r e trust to the chance of informers discovering to us the passage of opium without passes,[ 3 ] and this chance experience proves to be a nullity, since I believe there is scarcely an instance on record (if indeed there is one) in which, since the abolition of internal duties, any con signment of opium has been seized as contraband within the Bombay territory. 14. The proposition of this Government in 1844, that the pass fee should be levied on all opium on leaving Malwa, for whatever destination, would have effectually secured the object desired, but it was declined by both the Supreme Government and the Honorable Court. 15. Under the present law, when opium has once reached Bombay, all distinction between Vopium under pass anxl opium without pass ceases. 1 here are no means of separating the one from the other. Once brought on the island, whether by land or sea, all surveillance over it on the part of Government ends. It may be deposited wherever the owners think fit, and transferred from one place to another at pleasure. 16. When brought to the Custom House, for export to China, it is necessary that it should be shown under what pass each chest was imported. Were we sure that no opium left the port of Bombay except what was openly shipped through the Custom House, this requirement would of itself provide against the export of any opium uncovered by a pass. But it is impossible to suppose that such is the case. It is generally believed that much opium comes here which has never paid duty, and if so, it must be clandestinely exported, since Bombay requires but a trifling quantity for its consumption. It is under the belief that opium finds its way both into Bombay without a pass, and out of Bombay without regular entry at the Custom House, that we apply for the Bonding Act. 17. If we are correct in assuming the Malwa produce at 30,000 chests annually, as stated by Mr. Hamilton, we may be assured that smuggling is carried on somewhere to a great extent. Malwa itself may consume a certain quantity, but the surrounding countries, I believe, for the most part, supply their own consumption, and yet by our latest returns (from 1st October 1847 to 1 1th September 1848) only 12,899 chests have been under pass in the season 1847-48, leaving a balance of about 17,000 chests to be accounted for. 18. The raising of the price of the passes from Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 has evidently been attended with a diminution in the number of chests covered by them, and if this be occasioned bv no decreased supply of opium in Malwa, and if the whole produce finds its way to China, though not openly, through our port?, it is a certain proof that the price is higher than we safely impose upon the trade, with reference to the measures at our command tor checking the clandestine transit and exportation of the drug. 19. I may here remark, that if an Opium Bonding Act for Bombay is passed, it may be expedient, at the same time, to vest the Government officers with a right of search at the inlets by land into the island, viz. at the causeways of Mahim and Sion. W e have now some control, through our Custom establishment, over smuggling by boat, but none over that bv land, and it is notorious that opium and tobacco, the only two articles which cannot be imported free, find their way into the island in the cotton and hay carts, which no authority has now any right to examine. 20. The question of the provision of opium for internal consumption cannot well be considered altogether separate from that of securing our revenue on exportation. If the production of opium within our territory, its importation for consumption, and its retail sale, were free, it would be next to impossible to prevent the passage of Malwa Opium to China without having paid our pass duty. 21. Our main object, therefore, in interfering with the retail sale, is the security of our pass revenue. But I think it is a fair object, also, that Government should, it possible, derive a revenue from the consumption of the drug. It is a luxury, and not a necessary of life, and so long as the exigencies of the State require the maintenance of such sources of revenue, I think a tax on the consumption of opium as legitimate and unobjectionable as any that can be imposed. 22. Our law of retail sale is found in Chapters 3 and 4 of Regulation XXI. of 1827. No opium can lawfully be retailed except that supplied from Government depots to licensed[ 4 ] venders. This law is not strictly enforced. In some districts licenses are issued, in others the monopoly of the sale is granted to a farmer. I think we should in all districts carry out the laws ; but we should direct all Collectors to issue licenses, and to conform in all respects to the existing Regulation, so long as it continues in force. 23. The question of supplying opium for consumption has been one of constant discus sion and difficulty. Were Malwa opium alone consumed within the Presidency, we could easily procure the drug from that province, and send a sufficient quantity to each depot. But in point of fact but little Malwa opium is now consumed. The drug manufactured^ within the Presidency, and in neighbouring Native States, though inferior in quality to the Malwa, is suited to the taste of the people, audits greater cheapness interferes with the con sumption of the Malwa drug wherever we have attempted to substitute it. 24. It is remarkable that our law respecting opium seems to have been framed under the impression that no opium was produced within the Presidency. It was evidently assumed that no opium could be found within our limits which had not been brought in from beyond our frontiers. 25. It is only by a doubtful, and what must be admitted to be an extremely forced, construction of the law, that we can contrive to bring our own produce under any control. Regulation XXI. of 1827, Section I. Clause 1st, declares that all opium, except that imported by Government, or from the United Kingdom, or under treaty for consignment beyond the Company's limits, or the produce of the Bengal Presidency, shall pay a duty of Rs. 12 per Surat seer, ' on being imported or brought into any harbour or roads, or port or place, either by land or sea, within the territory of Bombay.' Under this law it has been held that the removal of opium from one place to another within the Presidency brings it under the duty, and it is this interpretation alone which (however strained) has enabled us to exercise any control over the opium cultivation. We have been obliged to assume that the removal from one village to another, or even from the field to the village, is a bringing into a place by land, and that all opium so removed is liable to the duty of Rs. 12 per Surat seer, or to confiscation. 26. It is obvious that without such assumption, opium might be manufactured to any possible extent, and carried free of all duty whatever to the port of Bombay, or other places on the coast. In Khandeish, for instance, where the poppy thrives probably equally well as in the neighbouring province of Malwa, merchants might readily collect the juice from the cultivators, work it into marketable opium, and produce hundreds of chests annually. These, when once brought down to the sea side, and under no surveillance, might without difficulty be smuggled to foreign ports on the coast, or to China. Even when on their land transit, it would be quite impossible to distinguish them from the produce of Malwa, so that Malwa opium, once clandestinely brought into the province of Khandeish, might assume to be Khan deish opium, and thus claim to pass free. 27. A suit was filed against the Government in the Ahmedabad Court, some time ago, on which the validity of the interpretation which the Government had placed on the exist ing law, in prohibiting the removal of opium the produce of our districts from one place to another within them, would have been determined, but the case never came to trial on its merits, and the question of law stands as it did previously. On this occasion our Legal Remembrancer, Mr. Howard, gave a very decided opinion that the duty of Rs. 12 per Surat seer applied solely to opium imported from beyond the limits of our territory, and did not touch opium produced within them. But the Government preferred that the case should go to trial; and it seems from the minutes of the Board on that occasion to have been its intention, had its interpretation not been sustained, to have applied again to the Supreme Government, either altogether to prohibit the cultivation of the poppy within our territory, or to place it under some effectual control. 28. Ihroughout many parts of this Presidency the poppy can be grown to any extent. e have everywhere discouraged the cultivation. In some cases, perhaps, our officers have[ 5 ] altogether prohibited it, but this is clearly illegal. In others they have threatened the im position of the prohibitory duty of Rs. 12 per Surat seer, and, under this threat, have obliged the growers to deliver to Government all their produce on payment of a fair valuation. In others, the impression that Government did not wish the cultivation to take place may have â€¢sufficed altogether to prevent it. 29. On a representation from this Government in 1839, the Government of India (7th August 1839, No. 90) communicated its determination altogether to prohibit by law the culture of the poppy within the Bombay Presidency ; but in the succeeding year, 1840, (19th ^ August 1840, No. 66,) it expressed itself, though desirous of stopping this culture, to be unwilling at the time to pass such a law; and the matter has remained in this position to the present time. 30. In Khandeish the Government undertakes the preparation of opium on a somewhat large scale. The Collector, acting on the decision that the ryots cannot legally themselves prepare the drug, obliges them to deliver the juice to Government at the lowest remunerat- ing price. It is taken to the depot at Dhoolia, where it is worked up by the prisoners in the jail. The opium so made is sent to the Presidency, and issued for the supply of our internal consumption. I believe this manufactory has continued up to the present time, but 1 have of late seen no reports of its operations. 31. The cultivation in Khandeish is necessarily much affected by these restrictive measures of the Government, but there can be no doubt, that were it declared perfectly free, and the produce subject to no prohibitory duty, a great part of the province might be covered by the poppy. There are no sufficient grounds for believing that, if carefully prepared, Khandeish opium, though inferior to that of Malwa, might not find a ready sale in the China market. 32. Guzerat, also, is capable of producing large quantities of opium. Lnder our system of discouragement, the cultivation in our villages has been checked, and in some districts it was said at one time to have altogether ceased (vide Revenue Commissioner's letter No&gt; 1C18, 9th December 1840) ; but this is of little avail, since the domains of Native States are so mixed up with our's, that by prohibiting the culture of the poppy in our villages, while it is free in those contiguous to them, we effect nothing beyond depriving our ryots of a profitable cultivation, and throwing them for their supply upon foreigners, 33. I think we should call for information on the state of the poppy cultivation in all our districts, and that we should have a special report from Khandeish, detailing all proceedings since the last report, and giving a statement showing the quantity of the drug produced eacli vear since the commencement of the Government operations, and the mode and result of its disposal. 34. Opium is consumed to a large extent in Guzerat and Kattiawar, and but little in other parts of our territory.* Our sales for consumption in the former provinces have fallen off almost entirely, while there is reason to believe that the consumption has increased rather than diminished. Our mode of regulating the price at which we issue the drug from our depots is of itself sufficient to account for this. We charge the original purchaser nearly with all the expenses of transit, establishment, &amp;.c, and in the case of Malwa opium include the amount of the pass, and thus sell at prices far above those at which the drug is to be readily procured in and alLaround our territory. It is not, therefore, surprising that our depots are not resorted to, especially when it is considered that the quantity required at each purchase by a consumer is so small, and the purchasers and sellers so numerous, that it is impossible to exercise any effectual surveillance, so as to confine the sale to the shops ol licensed voftders. $5. I think, that so long as the present system exists we should regulate our sale prices * The quantity issued for retail sale in Guzerat and Kattiawar was in 1842-43 about 270 Indian maunds ; in 1847-48 it was only 16 Indian maunds. Throughout our whole territories the quantity issued in 1842-43 was .&gt; l t! Indian maunds; in 1847-48 only G8 Indian maunds. This information is from the Opium Agent's Office.' /// [ 6 ] to the retail venders, not by what the opium may have cost us, but by that at which opium of similar quality can he obtained in the neighbouring markots. I would not compel the retailers to take high-priced foreign opium, but would furnish them with that of the country, pr ocured either from our own villages, or from those of neighbouring foreign States. This may entail some pecuniary loss upon the Government; but if by this measure we can guard our pass revenue, it will be well to'bear it. .If, on the other hand, it is considered, that by continuing the present system of retail in our hands, our pass revenue is not rendered more secure, it would be better to rescind the existing law, and leave the retail sale unfettered, except by the exaction of a fee on licenses, such as is now taken from retailers of poisonous drugs. 36. The increased growth of opium beyond the province of Malwa in Berar, and other parts of the Nizam's territory, has raised the question whether the pass system might not be made to extend to such opium, as well as to that of Malwa. Should it consist with the views of the Supreme Government, in reference to the Bengal monopoly, to accede to this-sugges tion, it will be a further question whether the privilege accorded to opium the growth of foreign territory should not be conceded to that the growth of our own ; whether, in fact, the pass system now in force should not be superseded by the exaction of a duty on all opium whatever on its export. 37. This would be effectual only if we could secure that no opium should be exported except from the port of Bombay. In that case it would be needless to concern ourselves with the cultivation or the retail sale within our provinces. Opium fitted for the China market would be raised wherever the nature of the soil, or the skill of the manufacturer, could produce it. If unfit for that market, it would be grown only to such extent as to sufBcfivfcii: theJnteriial consumption. 3B. It is, however, an important question, whether the absolute freedom thus afforded to the production and transit of the drug, even though we might be able to levy our duty on every chest exported, might not give rise to unlimited production, which would interfere with the large revenue now derived from the monopoly in Bengal.
