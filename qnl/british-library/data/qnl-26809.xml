Shahzada Zahurddin of the Afghan Purchasing Mission to the U.S. forces in India informed the General Staff, Kabul, from Calcutta on 19th. February that he had purchased some of the required goods and had despatched them, but it would take another two months to complete the purchases. He asked for Rs.80,OOO to be remitted telegraphically.Bxterna^/Secretary . I attach a copy of a summary of the agreement regarding the disposal of American surpluses which the Government of India have negotiated with the American authorities in India. I suppose that in view of the dollar assets of the Afghan Government there is no objection from our point of view to the Afghans paying the Americans in dollars for what they buy in India notwithstanding Article II(c). of the agreement. There is however an idea in the air that as part of the general wind-up of Lend-Lease, the Government of India should agree to take over for a lump sum all American surpluses in India and dispose of them themselves. This would supersede the present agreement. My understanding is that such an overall settlement (which would involve a dollar payment) would cover such warlike stores as the Americans do not want to remove from Inaia. It would mean that the Afghans would have to look to tie Government of India for their requirements of American surpluses.1 INWARD TELEGRAMS 33119 Alio owed to gc &amp; Q« De partmen tc 5opie b Cx rculajTed t,’ GrPHER TSLSaRA IVl ( 0 &gt; 1 &gt; P. ) From Government of India* Supply Dept * To Repeated to Dated Received Secretary of State for India-.

I presume no action is required until Afghans make formal request, but I think we may welcome proposo.1 and I agree generally with your views about supply of arms by Americans and ourselves. It will of course be neoessary to bear in mind fact that equipment received by us under Lease/Lend arrangements connect be trans ferred without approval of United States authorities and they may well object to our transferring such equipment to Afghanistan, preferring to re-acquire and supply themselves to Afghans. They might even raise difficulties about transfer of British equipment if they had supplied us with equipment of similar type. 3. Mr. Wallace Murray was given note stating that we counted on United States Government to enter into no commitments for supply of war material to Afghanistan without prior consultation with us. He assented and added that question was not actual since United States Government were not considering supply*of any arms at present. Copy to P.0. D.M.I. A.M. W.S.
