POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, 23rd August * 1951 Please refer to the correspondence resting with Agency c.s. (C13/3/35/51) of the 14th August. 2. The Shaikh of Sharjah has agreed to accept Rs.1,420/- per month as rent for the airfield and the recent extension. 3. Regarding paragraph 6 of your letter 1389/29 of the 18th July, I quote below from a letter of Wilton to me: n In the matter of the telegrams, Shaikh Saqr accepts the figure of 2000 words, but had not understood that there was to be any restriction of the destination to Bahrain, and I can find nothing to suggest that any such qualification was included in the original letter.” Can you please confirm that Mr. Atlee’s despatch gives us authority to agree to 2000 words irrespective of destination in order to induce the Shaikh to sign? 4 . I should be grateful if you could expedite the re ceipt of the map asked for by Sir Rupert Hay in paragraph 7 of his despatch No.14 of the 1st March, 1949, to the Foreign \ P-96 9 P- /3/2S ( &gt;P^9-l=lS0) Office.

I have had the Agreement, Letters and Air Navigation Regulations translated for the benefit of the Ruler, and he has, as I reported in my telegram No.130 signified verbally his acceptance of them and his willingness to sign. He stt«d out for the maximum sums permitted in respect of the airfield extension and Rest House. For the former he demanded Rs.1000/- at first, and slowly come down to his irreducible minimum of Rs.600/-, I having started from Rs. 100/- as offered by Andrew. As he refused to come below Rs.600/- I finally disclosed the figure of Rs.420/-, and said that if he did not accept it, there would merely be further delay while the matter was referred. He then offered the extension for nothing, but finally allowed himself to be persuaded to take Rs.420/-. For the Rest House he claimed that the figure of Rs.1000/- had been agreed to, and when I said that it was clear from the papers that it had been asked for but never agreed to, he said that that was not his understanding of what had passed between his father and Jackson, and the discussion continued. I tried to suggest that he would lose more by delay than by a prompt acceptance, but this merely led him to ask the date from which the increased rent would be payable. As there was no indication to any other effect, I said from the date of signature. This he entirely refused to accept claiming that it should run from the time negotiations for the renewal of the existing Agreement opened• I said that clearly it should run from the time agreement was reached, and that no agreement had yet been reached. He then claimed that agreement had been reached substantially in his father's letter No.187 of 9th February 1949, in which he accepted all the terms of the new agreement but held out for a rent of Rs.1000/- for the Rest House and the higher rate of pay for guards which we subsequently ceded (Stobart's 119-0436 of 28th January 1950 refers). As Stobart pointed out in his letter 0436/2/26 of 13th November, 1950, delay subsequent to the granting of a power of attorney to Shaikh Mohammed, notified to you in our letter -0436 of 8th January 1950, can not fairly be held to be the Ruler's fault, and in this matter of the Rest House rent, (as was the case in the matter of back pay for the guards) the delays in London of the past 18 months are costing a considerable amount of money to which he has a reasonably claim to consider himself entitled. I should be grateful to know what is the best offer which we can make to him for the date from which the increased Rest House rent can run. 3. In the matter of the telegrams, Shaikh Saqr accepts the figure of 2000 words, but had not understood that there was to be any restriction of the destination to Bahrain, and I can find nothing to suggest that any such qualification was included in the original offer. 4.

The late Shaikh's provisional agreement to these drafts, as subsequently modified by us in certain respects and subject to our recon sideration of the payments to be made to him, was given in a letter which he addressed to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast on February 9th 194-9 (your reference C/R -63 of February 12th 194-9 )• Agreement has now been reached by the Departments concerned in London on the final t it is desired that the\Shaikh's agreement be obtained and I 'ith four copies of \ ^ (i) The Heads of Agreement. t to which close here- S -46 U/18 (ii) The exchange of letters about the use of the airfield by military aircraft. (iii) The Air Navigation Regulations and I am to request you to arrange for the Shaikh's agreement to these texts to be obtained. 2. Amendments to the Heads of Agreement have been reduced to the minimum and the following are the only ones of any substance Article 1 . The word ’’operate'' has been substituted for 'use', since we are not claiming exclusive rights of usage and the second part of the article has been deleted in view of the possibility of our wishing to extend the existing airfield or to establish a new one at some time in the future. Article 3. which is based on the corresponding article in the recently concluded Kuwait Civil Air Agreement, is self-explanatory. Its inclusion is not absolutely necessary, but there does not appear to be any ground on which the Shaikh could object to it. Article ll(i) . The rates of pay for the guards, as also those pgesawted in the exchange of letters, are those which Wilton recently offered to the Shaikh and to which the latter agreed. (Pinhey's letter C13/3/13/51 of March 27th to me refers.) They are described in terms of basic pay and cost of living allowance as proposed in paragraph 3 of Sir Rupert’s despatch No.14 of March 1st 194-9 (81/8/4-9). ^ P'46 e* P ll/tS Article 11 (ii). The figure of Rs.1420/- per month comprises the ori ginal rent of Rs. 1000/- plus an increase of Rs.420/- in respect of the recent extension. This figure has been arrived at by assessing the rent of the extension (37 acres) at the same rate as the original rent for the original airfield (Rs.1000/- for 88 acres). This increased sum may be offered to the Ruler retrospectively to July 22nd 1950, the date on which the land was handed over to the Royal Air Force (your Agency's letter C13/3/16/51 of April 16th). /Article 11(iii) C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. l3bl- ~/z V- -M-Article The figure of Rs.1000/- per month is the maximum ■which we are prepared to pay. You should offer an increased rent of Rs. 600/- per month in the first place though, if necessary, you have discretion to agree to any figure up to Rs.1000/-. Article 14 is required in order to provide for the enforcement of the Air Navigation Regulations. 3, I am to emphasise that the payments provided for in Article 11 of the draft are in all cases maximum figures which should not be exceeded. In particular you should do your best to secure the Shaikh’s agreement to smaller rents than the maxima given above for the rest-house and the extension of the airfield. if. The letters to be exchanged are substantially those to which the late Ruler agreed and the Air Navigation Regulations are based on those recently a dopted in Kuwait. 5. On the conclusion of the agreement the Shaikh is to be presented with 74 rifles and 7,400 rounds of ammunition. The rifles are at present in the custody of the Officer Coimnanding, Royal Air Force, Sharjah (Wilton’s letter forwarded to us under your reference C13/3/2i4/5l of May 7th) and Brice is seeking authority for the release of the ammunition from Royal Air Force stocks in Sharjah. If you have not been told by us that this release has been authorised when the end of the negotiations is in sight will you please warn us, and we will try to hasten it. 6. You are also, on the completion of the agreement and if the Ruler repeat/s the request made by his predecessor, authorised to offer him facilities for the despatch of telegrams, free of charge, within certain limits. The offer which you may make is described in Mr. Atlee's despatch No.63(W 1394/15/602) of August 3rd 1949 of which a copy was sent to your Agency under our reference 81/20/49 of August 13th 1949* P.m Cf pnjie Cm&amp;-s&lt;&gt;yDRAFT English text of Heads of Agreement between.

The Agreement ' f is an unconscionable time materialising, and I am disposed to accede to his request. I should be grateful for your views.

We have virtually refused the latter, and if now, when he feels his security somewhat threatened, we do nothing to meet his claims to the former, we run the risk of sourcing his present satis factory and co-operative frame of mind. The delays over the Air Agreement are in any case quite unintelligible to him, and, I must confess, to me. Yours sincerely, A.J. WAlton. C.J.

The Residency do not agree with Pinhey and yourself that the arrears should now be paid with effect from the 1st of January, 1950, as your letter (0436/9/51) of the 21st March says that the Ruler was not expecting it and that he was apparently satisfied with the amount received and the period which it covered. In these cir cumstances, Sir Rupert states that he does not see how he can authorise the payment of further arrears to the Ruler unless he asks for it. A.J.

Aircraft of maxi mum permissible weight ex ceeding 6,000 lb. l/20d. l/15d. 2. Article 9 of the Bahrain Air Agreement provides for the amendment from timfgrto time of the charges specified in Schedule II to the agreement, and when the charges were last amended (in 1946)&gt;the Bahrain Government was simply informed of the fact (Political Resident in the Persian Gulf's Express Letter No.1024-5 of November 16th 1946 to Political Agent, Bahrain and Political Agent, Bahrain's Memorandum C/33 of January 7th 1947 to the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain Vefer). Under Article 3 of the present Sharjah Agreement and Article 7 of proposed new agreement (copied to ^inhey with my latter I2Z/- 1389/13 of April 26th) our right to modify the charges at our ' / discretion is absolute. Will you please therefore infprm the Government of Bahrain of our proposal to Introduce these new scales shortly?

Their effect is to reduce the landing fees payable by the Gulf Aviation Company's Ansons and Doves from £3. 2. 6d. to £1. 16, Od. and by their D.H,86’s from £3, 15. Od. to £2. These are substantial re ductions. Will you please reply to Belgrave’s letter of March 12th pointing out that the introduction of this ne of charges appears to remove the cause of His High complaint.

I do not agree with Pinhey and Wilton that the arrears should now he paid to January 1st. Wilton’s letter 0436/9/51 of March 21st to you says that the Ruler was not expecting it and that he was apparently satisfied with the amount received and the period which it covered. In these circumstances to date the payments hack to January 1st would clearly he a breach of the discretion given to Sir Rupert.Thank you for your letter 1389/8 of the 7th April, about the payment of the Guards by the R.A.F. at Sharjah. 2.

Bell, the Commanding Officer, R.A.F., Sharjah, has 74 rifles in his custody, but there is no ammunition with them, and nothing on his files to show whether there was any delivered with them. They were delivered before he arrived, and at a time when all accounting for equipment for the R.A.F. here was done at iy. There is a letter on his liles suggesting that the rifles were originally destined for some purpose in Abu Musa, - 74 rifles are mentioned, and the fact that there was no proper place to store them there was given as a reason for keeping them at Sharjah. Apart from that, there seem to be no papers about them at all, and I am unable to find any in our files here. There was no mention of rifles in the 1949 drait, and no trace of how they came into the subsquent one. L.A.G.

On the other hand there is a qua- rantine administration run by des ajesty’s Government. .e suggest therefore the substitution for the ./ords in brackets in paragraph 4 of the draft of 'the quarantine or other authorities concerned of Sharjah”.

The title has been replaced by the form used in the Kuwait Agreement. In Article 1 'operate* has been substituted for 'u8e' f since we are not claiming exclusive rights of usage, and also *aerodrome or aerodromes' for 'an air station and an aerodrome', since there seems to be no useful distinction to be made between them. In view of the f^ct that His Majesty’s Government may wish to extend the existing aerodrome or to establish a new aerodrome in the future, it is thought advisable to delete the second part of* the old Article 1. h* Article 2 is the same as before. The insertion of the new Article 3 (which is on the same lines as the corresponding article in the Kuwait Agreement) would enable His Majesty’s Government to legislate for certain procedures and rules for the use of the aerodrome. This insertion is not absolutely essential end if you think it may raise, or contribute to, difficulties, you may omit it. article 3 is a slightly amended version of the old Article k and is on the lines of the similar provision in toe Kuwait Agreement, articles 6 to 9 are virtually unchanged. A slight drafting amendment has been made to the last sentence of article 10. 5* Article 11(1). The figures for the pay of the guards have been brought up to date (as also in the draft exchange of letters on the Royal Air Force camp). The pay is described in terms of basic pay and living allowance, as was suggested in paragraph 3 of your despatch Ho. 14 of March 1st, 1949. /Article H(U)Tula figure t^cea accDont of tue c*t*mai:&gt;n of \tk* airfield last July (Hr* Bareli*• letter Qa 5d/9 of 21at lftarcn&gt;« _J!tigle * i llii» 'ftiis figure is tfit.t wtileh y^u were given discretion to offer in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office tele raa Mo* 24»J of 6th Mey 1949* It le un;erstood that et present pay?e&lt;?nte at tae old rate of «#3 o per aonth are bein^ paid into a auapenae account sgainat the aoney advanced by Hie ltej»ftty , e aoverrwient to the Sh&amp;iich for the building of the house* v&gt;r*en tnie loan has been paid off the rent will be paid direct to the Ruler* b* article 12 haa been »uaended as was suggested by y:u in p'fll' 9 ^ idtter 13d&gt;/4 of tae 21st February* The seeoad sentence of the old article 12 (new article 13) has been omitted, This is in accordance with the Kuwait .^reeaent i nd tne seettnee fK itoer looKaflell nor ia it really consistent with modern practice.

The first is that Michell told me that the Shaikh was not expecting it, no hope having been held out to him of arrears beyond April 1950, and he being apparently satisfied with the sum he received, and the period which it covered. I have seen the Shaikh several times since my arrival, and although he has discussed a number of other money- matters, he has never mentioned this one. The second reason is that before the draft arrived, Shaikh Mohammed had written me a letter (two copies of translation enclosed) asking us to secure comparable arrears from the R.A.F. If we now pay arrears to January 1950, he will no doubt expect the same from them. ^ I do not feel that either umstances invalidates the reasons origini rd for paying him arrears to January, and I thinl Id do so, but as the Treasury authority to His I discretionary, I thought that before handing 1 , I should mention them and await your views. Aj haikh f s present claim on the R.A.F. is concern? General Department letter to the Residency G.A. 95/3 of 23rd May (forwarded with your C.S.C/TC-101 of 13th June 1950) that the Air Ministry are reported as having agreed to the increase, though that letter contained no date from which it was to be effective. The Shaikh himself included the R.A.F as well as the Civil Airport guards in the claim for an increase which he made in his letter (569/1369 of 6/10/69 (22t7-50) which you forwarded to us under your P.L. C/TC-133 of 13th August last. The Commanding Officer qf the R.A.F. here tells me that he has as yet received ^10 instructions to pay any increase on the old amounts. I should be grateful if you could bring the Shaikh’s present claim to the attention of the R.A.F. and if you decide that I should go ahead and pay the arrears in respect of the civil airport to January 1950, warn them that he will no doubt expect a similar back-payment from themTJ pM+l+ Ur V C.J.

We were authorised in General Depart ment’s letter GA 95/3 of the 23rd May, 1950 (at 308/11/50) to agree to an increased payment up to Rs.100/- per month for the head guards and Rs.80/- per month for the other guards. In our letter 308/22/50 of the 21st August, 1950 we told the Foreign Office that we proposed to offer this increase retrospectively to July 23rd, 1948. Foreign Office telegram No.435 of the 25th October, 1950 (at 308/25/50) authorised the back dating cf the increase to April 1st, 1950 on the ground that the delay in the negotiations since had been the Shaikh’s fault. Sir Rupert's letter 3Q8/31/50 of the 23rd December, 1950 to Mr. Harpham pointed out that this was not true, and sought authority to pay theincreased rates from January 1st, 1950. The present letter contains the Foreign Office reply. 2. Mr. Harpham olviously thinks that the Treasury insistence on sticking to April 1st as the date from which the increased payments may be considered 4s unreasonable, and in view of Sir Rupert's letter of December 23rd (308/31/50), I have no doubt that he would agree that it is necessary to make the offer as from January 1st, 1950.

Apart from the obvious alteration of Article 10(ii), I do not see that further changes are required.

MK Folitical Agency, Bahrain. vSee -/S'/-BRITISH RESIDENCY CONFIDENTIAL BAHRAIN (1389/1/51 ) 15th January, 1951 No.C/R- 409 Owing to some oversight we do not seem to have reported the fact that the airfield at Sharjah has been extended by 451 yards at the request of the Royal Air Force, As the mat ter was of great urgency, vide Air Staff Liaison Officer, Bahrain 1 s letter No.ASLO/107/7/0rg. of the 28th June, 1950, of which I enclose a copy, the work was taken in hand immedia tely with the approval of the Shaikh and the airfield was extended to the required length in time to take the jet planes which were being flown at the time to India and Pakis tan. 2. At the time the extension was made, we did not realise that the Sharjah airfield was the property of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and not of the Air Ministry. The cost of the extension has presumably been borne by the latter. 3. I enclose a copy of correspondence exchanged with the Ruler relating to the extension. It will be seen from this teithat the question of rent for it remains to be settled and that the acting Ruler in his letter has called attention to the delay in the execution of the new air agreement and in o the payment of the increased salaries for the guards. Actually an offer of rent for the extension of Rs.100 per month was made to the Ruler and he replied that this was negligible compared to the present day value of the land. I am strongly of opinion myself that the amount offered was inadequate. The original area rented from the Ruler under agreement with Imperial Airways is 88 acres and Rs.1000 per month is being paid for this as rent. The area of the extension is approxi mately 37 acres and the rent for this at the previous rate works out to Rs.420 per month. I do not think we can reasona offer rent at a lower rate than that agreed in 1932 ai. could well be argued that the Ruler would be justified demanding a rate in excess of this in view of the general rise in prices which has occurred since then. I would request therefore that I may be authorised to offer up to Rs.420 per month if I find this necessary. I think the Shaikh will probably be willing to accept this offer if the new air agreement is presented to him for signature at an early date. The increased payment should be made with effect from the date on which the additional land was actually taken over. I have nothing on record to show when this date was, and I am making enquiries, but I believe it to be some time in July, 1950. 4. I am afraid this extension of the airfield and increase in the rent will necessitate some further amendments of the draft air agreement. I hope it will be possible to decide what form these should take at a very early date. The whole matter has now been pending for nearly three years and I was promised in para 2 of Foreign Office telegram No.433 of the 25th Octo ber, 1950 that the new copy of the draft pir agreement and the draft air navigation regulations would be forwarded by bag as soon as possible. harpham, Esq. , O.B.K Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1COPY ASLO/1 07/7/Org. 31 OFFICE OF THE AIR STAFF LIAISON OFFICER, BAHRAIN, 28th June 1950 His Britannic Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.

Smith, the Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force Station here tells me that Brice has instructed him to make available the ammunition due to the Sheikh of Sharjah from that held on the Station if the latter is sufficient to allow of this, and that he considers that it is. I mention this because if Sir Rupert or yourself meet the Shaikh of Sharjah, which it will be difficult for you not to do during your forthcoming visit, he will almost certainly raise the matter of the agreement or the firearms or both. I do not think that the news of Shakhbut’s having been allotted the Kalba rifles has yet leaked out (he has not yet sent in for them) but when it does, you may expect the other Rulers to press forward vigorously in the ''personal approach', if it is seen to 'pay off'.

I have had further discussions with Shaikh Saqr on this point, but all that he will say is that he 'leaves it to me te be judge”, and that he will 'agree to this, or more than this, if the Government considers it fair and just”. This is merely his way of saying that he considers it unfair and unjust and dees net in fact agree at all, but that he will net break eff negotiations en the point. If we insist, he will eventually sign, but he will not 'agree”, - he will sign under pretest end consider that he has been unfairly treated. I dc not imagine that his sense of grievance would have any lasting or serious results, but the point would undoubtedly be raked up for the next fifty years whenever we wanted anything else from him, and used to bedevil negotiations then. 3. If payment were made retrospectively to April 1st 1960 the suai involved would only be Rs.12,600 approximately (E?.700 a month for 18 months) and even that would not be handed over, but set against the debt for the Fort Buildings.
