DEAN STANLEY STREET, MINISTRY OF FLEL AND POWER 1st December, 1943. (PETROLEUM DIVISION), Dear peel, . Since receiving your letter of November 26th I have looked into the question of the ”sports goods required for Bahrein* The application for Export Licence on the items mentioned in your letter was refused because we had already authorised dollars for the supply of a similar quantity of these goods from the U.S.A. in WPB forms for the second quarters of both 1943 and 1944. The request made by the Head Office for the dollars purported to be total requirements for one year. Consequently, if _ approval had been given for export also from the U.K., it would have constituted douole supply of material which is in very short supply in view of the rubber content. should the Company wish to cancel their order Yours sincerely, R.

I I wonder if I could iiivoke-the aid of somepne injEoun^ 7 ■ s' Department, t o persuade the Petroleum DepartWh^t^^f^riy^ocfi^'^^'^ pany have a licence to export to Bahrain, 96 squash balls, 600 tennis balls and 200 dozen golf balls? I understand Mr. Mason of, I think it is, the Fuel &amp; Power Section, is the gentleman concerned to recommend to the Export Section of the Board of Trade the necessary export licence. He has always been very helpful but he now, seemingly, takes the stand that these balls are not made (particularly golf balls) and therefore he cannot advise the issue of a licence. Of course, the real point is that it is not, as I see it, whether the balls are made nowadays, but as to whether they $are obtainable. I am told that some, if not the whole of this order, may well be fulfilled, if not with new articles, then with used ones. Balls have been coming in and, I suppose, still are coming in from the United States, but not in sufficient quanti ties. It is, I am told, essential that we should send as many balls as possible out from this Country. With the large number of men in B a krain looking for recreation, the recreative side is more than ever important. If you could help, I should be grateful.
