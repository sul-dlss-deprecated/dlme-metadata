The Secretary^ to the government-df India in the External Affairs Department BY FAST AIR FAIL TWO The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. Dated Simla, the May 1945. Subject:- Improvements in the pension prospects of staff of the Persian Gulf. Sir, I am directed to refer to the E: xpress Letter from the Secretary of State for India No. Ext. 7124/41, dated the 8 th November 1941, and to forward a, copy of Express Letter from Britconsul Bughire No._ 2738-64/52, dated the 9th December 1944. In the circumstances explained, the Government of India agree that the concessions sanctioned by tne Secretary of State in his letter referred to above should be made admissible to (a) all members of the Persian Gulf Residency clerical cadre including ministerial gazetted officers (b) all clerical and subordinate meabers of the Hesidency Public Works Department including clerks, draftsmen, overseers and supervisors and (c) all persons mentioned in (a) and (b) above who nay be on deputation provided the conditions specified in the Government of India, External Affairs Department letter No. F.19(1J ‘ India Office with , dated tha ^7th March 1942^ (f orwarded to Government of India, External Affairs Department letter No. 25-M, dated the 27th March 1942) are satisfied. It will •h* be seen from the letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 655. dated the 17th May 1940,(copy enclosed with the letter fromThe Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. F.19(11)-E/4Q, dated the 7th May 1941) that the revised pension rules were intended to apply to members of the clerical cadre who have to spend their whole service in the Persian Gulf area, and only the I.P.3. Officers who were not permanently posted there were to be excluded. As the ministerial gazetted officers come from the ssme clerical cadre and put in tneir entire service in the Gulf, it is reasonable to give them the benefit of the revised pension rules. The Government of India are also opposed to differentiation between members of the clerical cadre and those of the Public Works Department as the latter have to serve under similar conditions. 2. I am directed to request that approval of His Majesty’s Government to -the proposed amplification be obtained and communi cated to the Government of India as early as possible. K.B. Maqbul Hussain whose case has been mentioned by the political Residenu is being allowed to retire on completion of 25 years service in anticipation of Secretary of State’s sanction.

(He completes 25 years’ service in June, 1945). 3.The Accountant General, Central Revenues’ ruling is obviously incorrect since the whole object of the revised rules is to enable the senior members of the clerical staff under this Residency to retire at an earlier age than was previously possible. If the gazetted ministerial officers under this Residency are not to be allowed to benefit by the revised pension rules the most deserving members o'f the staff will be penalized by their promotion to gazetted rank. The revised rules are also obviously intended to apply to members of the clerical cadre who are on deputation so the attitude adopted by the Accoun tant General, Central Revenues, is entirely unjustified. 4.In order to avoid any misunderstanding in the case of Khan Bahadur Maqbul Hussain Khan and other staff I request that the existing revised pension rules be amplified so as to make quite clear that the revised pension rules apply to:- (a) all members of the Residency Clerical Cadre including ministerial gazetted officers. (b) all clerical and subordinate members of the Residency public Works Department including clerks,draftsmen,overseers and supervisors. (c) all persons mentioned in (a) and (b) above who* mav be on deputation.DRAPT EXT. W 3 / 43 &gt; E.C, Cleary Esq., H.M. Treasury, ' ,Telcombe Hotel, n \ Stratford on Avon. g[!g AUG W43 Dear Cleary, I am sorry that it has taken so long to reply to your letter to Qrist of May 7th last. No. P.45^7/87j asking for our viev/s on the question -whether Bahrein should be classed as an unhealthy place for the purpose of the British Council’s Overseas Service Pension Scheme. The extreme unhealthiness of the whole Persian Gulf area is of course a common place; and it is often said that the climate there is worse, as regards both heat and humidity, than tho&amp; of the west coast of Africa. H.I1.G. and the Government of India, ' 4 V#**' r who share the cost of the British political administration in the Gulf between them, have recognised that the exceptionally high sickness/sickness and mortality rate in this area justifjatfc * the grant of specially favourable terms to those employed there. Ihus any Government servant posted to the Gulf receives special pay on account of the exceptional hardships of life there, of -which the climate is probably the most important; and any official permanently stationed in the Gulf is entitled to somewhat more favourable -oension terms than those obtaining in other areaS. ^vfe observe moreover that the Treasury have declared Calcutta, Bombay and Rangoon unhealthy places for the purpose of the Superannuation Act of 1876. There can be no question but that Bahrein is far more unhealthy than Calcutta. Hence, since Calcutta is, by Treasury standards, unhealthy, we do not think you need feel any hesitation in declaring Bahrein unhealthy also. Yours sincerely, a. pel*-.5 Medical AavxsfrT , .

Some such evidence, however, f'is supplied by the Political Resident*s letters of January 3rd 1928 (see paragraph 4) and 17th of May 1940. The former uses the unhealthiness of the Gulf as an argument for increasing the pay of the clerical cadre of the Residency; and the latter uses it as an argument for improving their pension prospects. In each case the Resident*s proposals were, with minor modifications, sanctioned. The present position seems to be that any Government servant posted to the GTjJfj£eceive$ special pay on account of the exceptional hardshipst of which the climate is probably the most important; andrihat any official permanently stationed in the Gulf is entitled to somewhat more favourable pension terms than those obtaining in other areas. to convince the Treasury of the exceptional unrealtmness or Bahrein? Do you think it would be helpful if we were to quote meteorological data (e.g. figures of temperature, humidity etc. which we could probably dig out) in support of our contention? With regard to the 3rd paragraph of the Treasury’s letter, I do not think we can argue that sanitation at Bahrein is ' particularly bad.

Cleary *8 compliments. COPY PT 7567/87 Treasury, Welcombe Hotel, Stratford-on-Avon. 7th May, 1943- Dear Grist, I should be grateful if you could help us on the following point. The British Council have an Overseas Service Pension Scheme - on contributory lines - which provides for higher contributions by the Council in respect of periods of service in unhealthy places. Treasury consent is required for treating any country or place as unhealthy for this purpose. As you know, there are a number of places which have already been officially declared unhealthy for the purpose of the Superannuation Act 1876 , and no difficulty will arise as regards any of these places (see list on pages 26 to 28 of the Pension Digest, 1937 ). As regards other places we had contemplated consulting Foreign Office or Colonial Office if the Council wanted to treat as unhealthy any place not on our list. We have now received via the Foreign Office (who make no observations of their own) a request from the Council to declare Bahrein unhealthy; the Council say they observe that Bushire has been 'stigmatised' as unhealthy, but think that there is little or nothing to choose between the climate there and that at Bahrein. We understand that the India Office is the only Department with information as to Bahrein and should be grateful for any advice on the point you can give us. I should add that in considering applications to schedule a place as unhealthy we regard sanitation as more important than the climate itself. The nearest place to Bahrein in our list is Bushire, which the Council have grayed in aid of their request, and prima facie from such information as we have been able to gather from the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1910 edition) we rather doubt whether Bahrein is as bad and whether it is necessary to give unhealthy climate terms for service there.

In 1930, a long overdue revision of pay cane into force, which, as ft.r as the .digits h Office is cone erne is sufficient to attract a suitable typ ~ of lan. No special arrange- pnents were, ho..ever, made for pension, and this cadre is subject to exactly the same rules as one whose members never leave Inula through out their service. 2. It has lon_. been admitted chat the Persian Gulf has one: of the worst climate., in one world, and Pr. Jordan the Resident Engineer of Callenders Cable Company who installed the Bahrain electric Light scheme ana who had served in .7eet Africa, was of the considered opinion that the climate of Bahrain was worse than ttm Gold Co^st. It is not A/ . fact ala mortality rate amongst the win Gov ernnent. and their which was proved by the high siciness = Punjabi armed police employed by th_ Be families. 3. Tliw tragic deash of Sir Trenchard Fowls, only four months after his retirement, has placed vividly before our eyes the fact that where as it is difficult to live long enough in the Gulf to earn a pension, it is far harder to survive to enjoy it, an7. finding on my return to the Gulf th t many familiar faces ware missing, I have had a state- mens prepared (appendix a) showing exactly what has happened to our cadre during the last 20'years. The figures are appalling. 7/hereas in India it is a co nonplace th t clerical staff frequently serve after the age of superannuation, an~ retire with the greatest reluctance, in 4. untimely deaths of men who have served them well far from their native country, ana I therefore bring forward the following proposals, which win Gulf they are lucky to reach tha age of superannuation at all. I do not believe that the Govt, of India wish to profit by the w n 1 1 ensure that our staff have som- hope oh enjoying a well earned retirement. (i) At the present moment, unless they have thirty years’ service, they cannot retire before the age of 55 unless they are certified by a medical board. For 55 the age of 50 should be substituted; (ii) A clef]?x shoulm e rn his full ^ ansi on aft m 25 years’ service in place of the 30 years now prescribed: Sven at 25 years’ service a man is completely worked out; (iii) invalit pension in the case of those invalided after 10 years' service ana before completing 20 years* service should be calculated at n/40th of the .ion:fly average pay instead of n/60th, as at present, ('n' represent in -tha number of years counting for pension} . Tiixxxsci- r.xxxys&lt;:xxxxfcaxxn:. This already exists in the Consular Service who allow two years ' service in specially unhealthy parts (which include the Persian Gulf) to coun: three years for pension. 5. Despite th- untimely deaths of Col. Trevor. Col. Prideaux and Sir Trenchard Fowls so soon after retirement, ana Sir Hugh Biscoe and Col. Barrett while still serving officers, I do not wish to make any special proposals for th - officers of the Department serving in the-Persian 'jUx- . They are not obliged to spend their whole service here, and i e liberal scaae. their leave terms are conceived on a mo Gull clerical caore is, however, in a different position and, so far as I am aware, there is no other body of employees of the Govt. o.' -(TQ -r:hr&gt; ^n+1 '•'n.der SUCh COndltlOnS. I Fhe Persian so far . 0 .- t.her afore inaia who serve permanently abroad un strongly recommend that: (i) the age for superannuation be fixed at 50 instead of 55; (ii) the full retiring pension should be granted after 25 years’ service (iii) invalid pension in the case of those invalided after 10 years’ service and before completing 20 years should b~ calculated at n/40 of the monthly average pay instead of n/50.APPSl'IDIX - A» List of Staff in 1929 # r ^ 1* Mr. R.

The general reasons why a leave reserve, and a rather large one, is needed in the Gulf are well explained in air a. Haworth's letter of ord January 1928, at P.7879/29; paragraphs 14-15 of that letter which elaborate this point deal mainly with the obsolete issues of the pre-1928 system of temporary postings and of proposals (not adopted) for a training (as distinct from a leave) reserve. The iolitical Resident’s letter of 25tii May, 1940, does not mention any new grounds of hardship, e.g # heavier work owing to the war, and though his aim, 4 months every 5 years for everyone, is no doubt a good one, a draft letter is submitted to the Foreign Office supporting the Government of India’s less generous proposal.* Financial secretary , * This includes temporary posts and is probably a fairer measurei of needs than the increase in permanent posts given by the Government cf India as 27 to 57.

Copy to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for information with reference to his letter No .669, dated the 2oth uky 1940.( Ve) O CS r~ p.i Jopy of letter No.669., dated the 25th Hay, from the Hon'ble the Folitical Resident in t 1 ie 2 ^ersian uuii, busnire, to tne Secretary to »ne . ^^ i 'Rovernment of India, External Affairs Department^4-0 j dimla* ' I have the honour to submit for the consideration of the G-overn- nt of India the following proposal for an increase from 4 tp 6 in the number of leave reserves sanctioned for the Persian Gulf clerical establishment* % The necessity for the creation of a leave resery/a was first jii sed by Sir L. Haworth, who, in his letter Ro .5-64/149, dated the 2 . recogi 3rd January 1928, amon^ other proposals, reguested the Govern ment of India to accord their sanction to the creation of a leave and txxiHting training reserve of 4 clerks. Though Sir L. Haworth at the time admitted that this number, which was in excess of 10% of the total strength, was slightly higher than the normal percentage, he pointed out that the increase was justified owing to the greater aistances the men had to travel to their homes and the fact that their leave did not commence until after their arrival in Karachi which necessarily made their periods of absence from duty longer. That the Government of India agreed with this view is indicated by the fact that they accorded their sanction to the establishment of a leave reserve of two Upper Di lower Division clerks* ivision and two to 3. Since 1928, however, due to the additional posts for which it has from time to time been necessary to obtain the sanction of the Govern ment of India, the total strength of the Persian Gulf clerical cadre, excluding the East Persia cadre, for which separate arrangements are made has arisen from 59 to 46, and, in consequence, though it has i been acknowledged in principle that the percentage of leave reserves should be in excess of 10% it is now less than 9%. In spite, therefore, of the fact that the clerks of this Residency are deprived of that boon to Indian Agencies, casual leave, (which is valueless in consequence of their service aoroad where they have no family ties) and have to add their period of leave at least one month's joining time to cover the period*spent in travelling to and from Karachi ? the strength of leave reserves*sanctioned for this Residency is considerably less than that sanctioned for Indian iAgencies such as Rajputana. In consequence, assuming the average period of leave to be four months, plus one month's joining time, it is not possible to grant the clerks or this Residency leave more than once in every four years -- a period, which, taking into consideration the climate of the Persian Gulf and the fact that the men are serving far from their homes in a foreign country, cannot but be regarded as excessive. In order, therefore, that the clerks of this Residency may be able to avail themselves of leave at least once in every three years, which for reasons of health and efficiency, I consider to oe a minimum, I would strongly recommend for the considera tion of the Government of India tnat the total number of leave reserves sanctioned for this Residency may be raised by two Lower Division leave reserves at a total extra cost to Government of Rs.o,400/-otv* Copy of a letter No.161/64/149, dated the 24th January 1937, from the Political Residant In the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India, New Delhi. &lt; 'I'ZQU ■ v J £. O ' , Reorganisation of the Vernacular Section of the Persian Gulf Clerical Cadre. I have the honour to reconmend that (1) the post of Head Munshi at the Political Agency, Bahrain, be raised from an Upper Division to a Special Grade appointment, (2) the post of Munshi at His Majesty's Vice-Consulate, Khorramshahr, be made an Upper Division in stead of a Lower Division appointment, and (3) the post of Munshi at his Majesty's Consulate, Kerman, be reduced from Special Grade to a Lower Division appointment. 2. A proposition statement showing that the changes recommended above will involve no extra expenditure to Government is enclosed. 3. The present position is that all the three Upper Division posts of the Vernacular Section a re on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf and all the three Special Grade Dost in Iran. This has been found un satisfactory in that it places bilingual qualifications at a discount and sets a premium on a sole Knowledge of Persian, so that the Munshi who knows both Arbbic and Persian tends to be kept in the Upper Division appointments on the Arab Coast lnst o ad of being promoted on his deserts to the Special Grade posts. 4. It is therefore proposed to make the changes ' indicated in paragraph 1 above. \ 5. The increased, and increasing, importance of Bahrain is well known to the Government of India, and the desirability of attracting thither the more senior and/2 and better qualified among the Vernacular Section needs no stressing. I accordingly propose that the Upper Division post of Head Munshi be raised to a special ,**Grade appointment. 6. As regards Khorramshahr, this is probably from the point of view of vernacular work the busiest office in Iran with which the Government of India ere concerned. The Iranian naval base has added to the contacts which the Munshi has to preserve, and the spate of new and ambiguous regulations which the Iranian authorities are constantly promulgating, as for instance in respect of the estates of deceased foreigners, has considerably increased the work of the post. It is therefore proposed that the appoint ment should for the future be an Upper Division one. 7. With a view to meeting the extra expenditure on account of the higher rates of pay proposed above for the Munshis at Bahrain and Khorramshahp , I propose that the post of Munshi at Kerman be reduced from Special Grade to a Lower Division appointment. I should is ve preferred to have reduced it only to the Upper Division, and my proposal that it should in future be a Lower Division, post is made solely in order to avoid involving Government in any additional expenditure. I feel, however, that Kerman of late has lost much of its importance and with the cessation of British Indian trade and the disappearance of Russian Agents in that district it does not seem to be necessary now to keep such a highly paid Munshi there - especially when the need for a better class of Munshi is felt elsewhere. 8. I suggest that the above changes be brought inte force with effect from the 1st April 1937.From - The Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, .

Copy of letter No.412-3 of 1935 dated Bushire # the 15th June 1935, from the Hon 1 hie the Pqlltical Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. \k O il I have the honour to address the Government of India on the question of re-organization of my office with reference to the posts of Registrar, Treasury Officer and Confidential Assistant. As I have already pointed out in paragraph 3 of my letter No.283-8, dated 27th March 1933, the duties of X the Confidential Assistant are very important and more responsible than those of the Registrar or the Treasury Officer particularly as the whole responsibility for th&lt; supervision of the most important part of the Political Resident's office is on the Confidential Assistant. For example it is the Confidential Assistant who is appointed to act as Under Secretary in temporary vacancies and not either the Registrar or Treasury Officer. The present position under which the Confidential Assistant is given a pay of Es.300-10-350, which is less than the pay viz. Rs.400-20-500 of the Registrar or the Treasury Officer, is anomalous. This &amp; cfP 1935 Q^o^aly is due to the Government of India not having (ACCOUNT! GENb .'9459 / ’I) 10 4 cc '''pTr ;/r Asi ‘hj 3-v accepted the original recommendation of the Political Resident for the fixation of the Confidential Assist ant's pay. Successive Residents have emphasised the need for re tiffing this but unfortunately the situation remains unaltered. 2 . I realise at the same time that this may not be a very opportune time to put forward proposals for extra expenditure and in view of this I have carefully examined and worked out the following scheme of re distribution of duties amongst the three gazetted posts in the Residency. The scheme will ensure a more equitable distribution of work and basis of remuneratiaii' i without involving Government in any extra expense. (!) I consider that it should he possible to combine the duties of the Registrar and the Treasury Officer without any increase of the pay and allowance^ of the holder of the combined post, but it will be essential to create a new gazetted post of Assistant Registrar on a lower pay of Fs.300-10-350 plus the Gulf Allowance. Customs Compensatory Allowance House Rent Allowance Rs.75/- &amp;.25/- Rs.50/- t The new combined Registrar and Treasury Officer canno/ take over the duties of the present 2 independent posts without the aid of an Assistant. It should be remembered that there are two offices in the iMsdi Bushire Residency separated by a distance of 7 miles. (2) The pay and allowances of the post of Confidential Assistant to be increased as follows:- Pay Gulf Allowance. Customs Compensatory Allowanc e. House Rent Allowance. 88.400-20-500. Ks. 100/ - Rs. 50/- Rs. 50/- He will work as at present at Sabzabad am continue to be in charge of the Confidential Office. 3. Mr.Sequeira, the late Registrar, has retired on being invalided and there will therefore be no difficulty in giving effect to the above reorganiza tion. It will be seen that my recommendations involve only a reorganization and re-distribution of duties and posts generally without - as pointed out above - any extra expense to Government. I am prepared further to assure the Government of India that the scheme has been worked out after consider able thought and they need not apprehend that a proposal will be put forward to revive the independent post of Treasury Officer involving Government in extra cost. \Oopy of a letter No. 2596, dated the 24th November Political —— * from the Hon^le the/^esident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Reorganisation of the establishment under the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. -x-x-x- I have the honour to refer to the Government ox xnciForeign and Political Department, Memorandum No. F.25-iy'28, dated the 15th April 1930, sanctioning revised rates of pay and allowances for the Persian Gulf establish ment, and to submit for the consideration of the Government ox inoia, a proposal for a slight modification in the pay of the post of Treasury ahroff, Bushire. I fully realise that the financial situation is still sufficiently serious to render it difficult for the Government of India to consider any proposals involving increase of expenditure, but I feel that the present proposal is one which demands special consideration, and the extra expenditure involved is small. fD the year 1920, the pay of the post was raised from its. 40/- to As. 60/- per mensem. In the Revision Scheme sanctioned under the above cited Memorandum from the Government of India the pay of the post was fixed at As.80/- per mensem, (less 5% emergency cut), with effect from the 1st April 1930, but it seems obvious that future periodical revision was contemplated when this rate of pay was recommended in January 1928. In my opinion, the pay of the post should have been fixed on an incremental scale which, apart from obviating periodical revision, has the admitted advantage of providing an incentive to long and efficient service and persistent endeavour. 3. Further, the designation of the post appears to have obscured the fact that the incumbent, in addition tohis duties as a member of the Treasury Staff, is required to function as cashier for the office of the Political Resident* In the latter capacity he has to receive and disburse large sums of money and maintain the initial accounts of ail receipts, payments, advances ana recoveries pertaining to that office* The present rate of pay is, in opinion, incommensurate with these combined duties and responsibilities, more especially in view of the stesdy rise in the cost of living resulting, inter alia, from prohibitive import duties end heavy taxation. It may be mentioned here that the present incumbent, who is a Persian subject end has held the post since 1917, does not draw any Gulf Allowance or Customs Compensatory allowance, as do other Persian subordinates in the Vernacular Branch. 4. For the reasons stated above, I recommend that the pay of the post of Treasury Shroff, Bushire, be fixed at vs. 60/-4-120 per mensem, with Gulf Allowance at ts.30/~ per mensem, with effect from the 1st . pril 1934. The initial pay of the present incumbent in the new scale may be determined as if he had been started in the new scale on Re. 80/- per mensem from the 1st April 1930. The average monthly cost of proposed scale, excluding Gulf Allowance at Rs. 30/- per mensem, works out at Rs. 97/-. The average extra cost including Gulf Allowance would therefore amount to Rs. 47/- per mensem only, which is divisible. The extra expenditure during the current financial year amounting to Rs. 480/- could be met from within the sanctioned grants.From The Acdl 3 Dewty Secretary to the Goveroment of India in the Foreign and- Political Department, To - The Hon 9 ’ole the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Meraorendum No»F * 15 (19) -s/35, Dated Simla, the Jt July 1935, mmi Reference your letter Mo. 2596 dated the 24th November 1934* The Government of India are pleased to revise the pay of the post of Treasury Shroff, Bushina from Rs, 80/- per mensem to Rs a 60-4-100 per mensem.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ' IKMinute Paper. Department. On P.7879/30 below, revised scales of pay were approved for the clerical establishments under the Persian Gulf Residency, including Kerman. The present proposal is to extend the scales of pay already sanctioned to the establishments at Keshed, Seistan and Duzdap, although the original proposals of the Consul-General at reshed were rather more generous. Against the'proposed increases, the Consul-General at Meshed is prepared to dispense with the services of a stenographer, a saving of Rs.2400 a year, while the Consul for Seistan and lain considers that it is not necessary to fill the post of Persian Mirza for Jvhich sanction exists already. The extra expenditure for the first year will be Rs.1045 rising to an average figure of Rs.3975 per annum. As the actual scales have already been approved, there would seem to be no further need to examine their details and as the Government of India, who are fully alive to the need for economy, are satisfied that the revision is justified by the similarity of conditions in the Gulf, Meshed and Seistan, their proposals may I think be accepted. I’hey will have the advantage of preparing the way for a scheme which the Government of India have in contemplation for amalgamating all these establishments with those in the Gulf for facilities of posting. It is proposed that the revised scales should be introduced with effect from 1st April 1931. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted accordingly. / j/fl 'fid,I ?.8808/30. Draft Paper.

The scales of pay, etc., proposed for Sistan and Duzdap are in accordance with those sanctioned by the Secretary of State for the Gulf establishments, vide his telegram ho.859, dated the 11th March 1930, but in the case of Meshed tne rates suggested for the clerks are rather high. 3. The conditions in the Gulf, Meshed and Sistan being admittedadmitted as similar, the Government of India consider that a revision is justified hut they do not see sufficient reasons for treating fleshed differently, more particularly as they have in contemplation a scheme for amalgamating all tnese establishments with those of the Gulf for facilities of post ings. They accordingly recommend that his Majesty’s Secretary Consulate and huzdap Vice-Consulate as proposed by the Consul and those for meshed as stated below, with effect from the 1st April 1951 4* The sanction of the Secretary of State in Council is also requested to the reduction of Rs.2,400/» from the Khorasan Office Allowance Grant, due to the abolition of the non- pensionable post of Shorthand Writer referred to in paragraph 2 above. 5. The a verage extra expenditure entailed by the revision will be approximately Rs.1,035/- for meshed and Rs. 2,940/- ior £&gt;istan and huzdap, the immediate extra expenditure for the year 1931-32 being about Rs.275/- and Rs.770/- respectively. The expenditure will as usual be divisible in moities between the nome and Indian Governments. of State for India in Council may kindly be moved to accord his sanction to the revised rates of pay for the Sistan name of post.

Proposal for Revision of Scheme of Pay ior clerical Establishment of Sistan Consulate for the amalgamation of the cadre with that of the Persian Gulf Residency. 1 have the honour to refer to Foreign and Political Department letter h o.297/86-Sst of 30th January 1922, in wnich a revised Pay Scheme was brought into force xor Persian Gulf and Persia, including the Sistan and meshed Consulates. \ 7 iien it was understood that a further revision was contemplated which has since been brought into force 1 or trie Persian Gull Residency, it was believed that it woula be automatically applied to otner consulates in Persia, as had previously been the case, conditions everywhere being very similar, it appears, however, that the new Scheme has not been extended to include this consulate. 2. ms a result the Clerical Establishment 01 inis Consulate is now employed under conditions which are less favourable than those pertaining, for instance, in Kerman Consulate, whereas circumstances are practically identical, moreover, in view of tne fact tnat this Consulate has jurisdiction over tnree Vice-Consulates, one hospital and two dispensaries, it is probable that the clerical work is of a more arduous nature than that of Kerman and some otner Consulates, ms regards climatic conditions, tne oistan Consulate nas little advantage over many places in the Gulf ana none at all over Kerman, and Indian Clerks are similarly on Foreign service m this area. From trie point of view of lack of amenities, East Persia is certainly at a disadvantage^ compared with most stations in the Gulf Residency which benefit to a great extentextent from regular steamer connection with. India# Under these circumstances, x venture to request tnat the Government of India will he pleased to favourably consider the appli cation to this Consulate of the recent revision scheme inaugurated for the Persian Gulf. 3 . tfere this proposal to involve any heavy increase of expenditure, x should hesitate to put it iorward at ft time when x realize that economy is a matter of great necessity. Such, however, is not tne case, for the following reasons.* it is proposed to abolish the appointment ot a xersian Xiirza at huzdap, which was sanctioned in Government of India, foreign and Political Department telegram ho.344-E, dated the 3rd August 1929. A suitable candidate for the post has not been forthcoming and further experience has shown that the appointment, which was proposed by my predecessor at a time wnen vei*nacular correspondence was, xor temporary reasons, unduly heavy, is no longer a necessity. Ihe post of Court Clerk at Duzdap for which tnat of Persian liirza was to nave been substituted has already been abolished. As will be seen from fable 'A*, attached (In which a comparison is made between the existing scale and that now proposed, being the scale sanctioned ioi tne Persian Gulf), tne economy thus effected at Duzdap will practically balance the small extra expenditure at Sistan, the excess amounting only to xis.360/- for the year 1930-31 which it will be possible to meet by reappropriation, and no further funds will be required. (B) Por a period of five years from 1931-32, there will be no increase, owing to the introduction oi the proposed new scheme, in the pay of tne 2nd clerk or Accountant at Sistan, since botn appointments nave been but recently filled and the incumbents will not arrive at the highest salary permissible to them under the present scheme, until expiry of that period® Similarlyr ZfZ l Similarly at jJuzdap tiiere will be no increase in tiie pay of the head Clerk for two years, or in that of the Accountant for three years. The only immediate increases will therefore oe in the incremental scale of pay of the Attache and of the head Ulerk, Sistan and in the Special iray of others. As a set off to this there will be the saving of the increments, wnich would have failed, due to the Persian hirza^Duzdap, wnich post it is proposed to abolish. 4. While therefore, the immediate financial benefit to the clerical Staff is small, and the extra cost involved, for some years, is insignificant, the adoption ox the new scheme offers better prospects to the clerks in tne future and would remove any heart-burnings on the score ol the inequality of conditions of service, in the adjacent Consulates of herman and Sistan. Table 'B 1 affords a comparison of tne new scale now in force for Kerman, and that proposed for Sistan. 5. The number of clerical posts in the 3istan Consulate is small, and in consequence promotion to higher grades is extremely slow, moreover, there is no reserve oi any kind for leave or casualties and new clerks, when required, have to be recruited in the open market, and are usually entirely untrained and take some time to become efficient. The expense in enlisting a temporary clerk to fill a leave vacancy is prohibitive and suitable candidates cannot be lound. An inevitable result is that extra work has to be performed by the other clerks, whenever leave is sanctioned, in the whole of their service there is no prospect of a change, except as between i/uzdap and Bis tan. in short, the conditions are such, that stagnation has resulted, and the poor prospects of promotion blunts the keenness of the Juniors, or causes them to leave for otner spheres of employment, while the Seniors, condemned to many years*9. years* service in one post* lose entiiusiasm and. eliiciency* 6 * i'he Government of India have been pleased* on a i onner occasion to consider a remedy ior this state ox aiidirs and in paragraph 6 of their letter .wo*297/86 i!»st Ox dOth Januaiy 1922* the principle was laid down that there snould be ajfree interchange of personnel between the various Consulates and Agencies in Persia and the Persian Gulf* xn practice however, this principle has not been applied, and with the exception of the loan to this Consulate ol a nead Clerk from the Gulf at the present time, no such interchange has taken place* as long as the scale of pay varies, as between Sistan and the Gulf, and in the absence of definite amalgamation of the cadres, such interchanges are, in fact, most difficult to arrange. Purther the transfer ol a clerk direct from the Persian Gulf to sistan involves very heavy travelling expenses. 7. i would therefore, request that Government will ce pleased to consider the advisability of the Sistan cadre being definitely combined with that ol the Gulf, and v/ould luither suggest that, if such amalgation he effected, any interchange of personnel should take place, in conjunction with leave i-e a clerk proceeding on leave from Sistan, should normally be replaced by one whose leave from the Gull has expired. ihe former on expiry of leave would normally proceed to the Gulf- thus effecting fairly frequent changes of personnel, on an average once in every 5-5 years, while generally avoiding the heavy expenditure involved in direct tranoieis* 8 . With a view to regularising the conditions of service in this Consulate, vis-a-vis Kerman, as speedily as possible, i would request that the Government of India may be pleased to consider this matter apart from the proposal for amalgama tion with the Gulf Cadre, which latter scheme will douctless require reference to the hon'ble the Political Kesident and involve some delay before a final decision can be taken.Prom.

As there is no accommodation for more than two clerks with families at Subzabad a tod it is in the interests of the public service that the Confidential Assistant should live at f^CLtL Subzabad, the Camp Clerk has^to make his own housing arrangements outside. To compensate him for this, I recommend that he should be granted a house rent allowance of Rs 20 /- per mensem against the Rs 50/- provided for the Confidential Assistant.

It will, if this is so, be desirable to touch on the point and ask for covering sanction up to 1st April, 1930, in forwarding the present proposals to the Foreign Office. 2. I have been throu^i the papers forwarded in the Government of India’s letter of 21st November. On a broad view, I think that a conclusive case has been made out for the revision of pay now proposed. Sir Lionel Haworth’s original recommendations have undergone|j the scrutiny of Sir Frederick Johnston, who had great experience in these matters, and they have been furtner modified in certain directions by the Government of India themselves. It is clear, in other words, that they have been carefully examined. Apart from this, the proposals are of a nature which a Local Government would, I understand, normally be competent to sanction without reference even to the Government of India, and which the Government of India will shortly be able to approve in the case of their own Secretariat. Once this greater discretion has been given to the Government If , ! ‘ .. of/ 3818a 5000 8/29of India, a case such as the present will come home for the orders of the Secretary of State only because freasury ana Foreign Office concurrence has to be obtained to the imposition on Imperial revenues of a moiety of the additional expenditure involved. Having regard u&gt; all the circumstances, I doubt if any further very ueoaiieci examination of the Government of India's proposals is called for, and, subject to your concurrence, I suggest that we might put them to the Foreign Office as in the drait. J.G. Laithwaite, 12.XII.29. I agree. F.E. Grist. c I 13/12. It would appear that the henial establishments are not recommended for any increase, or even lor the stabilisation of the temporarily increased rates which they have now enjoyed for some years past. It may be desirable, to prevent any misunderstanding, to touch on this point in replying later to the Government of India’s proposals, and to remind them that if they wish the temporary increases maintained after 31st March, 1930, Treasury concurrence will be necessary. From a proposition statement on P. 133/1923 the establishments in question include sweepers, peons, gardeners, hospital servants, boat establishments, etc. her is any specific reference made by the Government of India to t, subordinate tt establishments. Mr. Dawson informs me that in ordinary Indian practice '’subordinate” would cover the secretarial classes below gazetted rank, but above menial, and that he would regard it as covering the clerical classes who are in fact now recommended by the Government of India for permanent increase.

The Political Resident has since represented that the cost of living in Persia has considerably increased and he has submitted the following proposals for the revision and improvement of the conditions of service of the clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency:- (1) The introduction of time-scale of pay; (2) Creation of leave and training reserve for the clerical (o) Revision of pay and improvement of status of the Confidential Clerk; ( 4 ) Increase of two Extra Assistant Residents in the English Office and corresponding reduction of one Extra ( 5 ) The grant of Gulf allowances to the ministerial establishment to compensate for the conditions of life staff; Assistant Resident (or interpreter) in the Vernacular Office; in the Gulf3* The reasons advanced 'by the Resident in support of these proposals have been fully explained in his three letters 1. I T o.5-64/149, dated the January 1923 ) cited in the margin - with proposition statement (a). ) ;.^&gt;lTo.93 of 1928*, dated the 15th January, 1923. ) copies enclosed.

At the same time senior men are always seeking for opportunities to liberate themselves from, the Gulf service without sacrificing their pension rights. This continuous struggle on the part of the establishment to get bade to India has a prejudicial efiect on the discharge of business. Its principal causes are that the terms offered are insufficient to recruit and retain tiie type of men required and that the prospects do not compare favourably with those existing for Indians in their own country. 4. The Government of India are satisfied with the necessity for the re-organiaation of the whole establishment but have suggested certain modifications as shown in the enclosed statements B. and C. It will be seen that the formation of leave reserve proposed by the Resident in paragraph 14 of his letter ho. 5-64/149, dated 3rd January 1923 but not included in his Proposition Statement has been provided for in statement B. His proposal is reasonable as it is roughly based on the 14 / ordinarily allov/ed as leave reserve for such establisliments. The Resident’s proposal in paragraph 15 of his letter just quoted regarding the formation of a training reserve does not commend itself to the Government of India, since apart from the difficulty of having such posts exclusively for training, on a fixed rate of pay» such an arrangement is unusual in itself. The proposed Gulf allowances appear to the Government of India to have been fully justiiied by the ResidentResident in vie?/ of the unhealthiness of the G-ulf and the fact that Indians serving in the Gulf are as much over-seas as British officers in India# In certain cases the principle has, in fact, been already recognised by the grant of special pay in the past to a number of posts in order to compensate for the objectionable conditions inseparable from service in Persia, such as, bad climatic conditions, exile, and isolation. The proposals aim, there fore, at the general extension of the principle to all the posts except in the case of the staff at Kerman and Lingah and the Residency Agent at Shargah and the Treasury Shroff, Bushire. The Government of India accordingly concur in the Resident's recommendation with slight modifications in respect of Gazetted officers as shown in statements B. and G# These allowances will continue to be treated as special pay# 5. It is contrary to the practice of the Government of India to agree to general revisions of establishment being made on the scale proposed, in the middle of the financial year, and it is therefore recommended that effect be given to the modified proposals, which are considered to be the minimum compatible with the maintenance of proper standards ’ of efficiency, from the 1st April 1930, the existing scales of pay to the clerical, subordinate and menial establishments being continued up to the 31st march 1930. The actual extra expenditure for the year 1930-31 which the proposal involves is Rs. 21,175/-, of which Rs. 18,997/- is divisible in moieties between His LSajesty's Government and the Indian Government# The Government of India are convinced of the urgency of the reform without further loss of time and in anticipation of the approval of the Secretary of State in Council necessary provision is being included in the budget estimates for 1930-31# It is requested that the Secretary of State in CouncilCouncil may be moved kindly to accord iiis sanction Y/hicii may be communicated by telegram.

Fr om The Hon , ble Lieut. Colonel L.B.H. Hav/orth, I.A. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To Sir Denys de S. Bray, K. C.I.E., C.S.I., C.B.E. , Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Hew Delhi. Revision Scheme for the improvement of the conditions of service of the Clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Re sidency. Sir, \ I have the honour to put forward for the consideration of the Government of India a scheme for the improvement of the conditions of service of the Clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency. 2. Upon taking over charge of this Residency I was struck by the fact that the ministerial staff were far below the standard of other 1st Class Residencies and in some respects unequal to the duties they had to perform, at the sams time the senior men were consistently desirous of, and negotiating for, appointments that would liberate them from Gulf Service without sacrificing their pensionjiights. At the present minute both my Registrar and the Indian Assistant at Bahrain and the two senior Interpreters - the four senior members of my Indian Staff - are all struggling to get back to India, a state of affairs which does not make for a satisfactory service. The primary cause of this is that the terms offered are insufficient to recruit or to retain the type of men required. The prospects do not compare favourably even with those existing for Indians in their own country.3&lt;» Upon examining the question it appears that the failure of the present system is due to overlooking four factors in the life of the Persian Gulf, namely, (1) The unhealthiness of the Gulf; (2) The fact that all Indians here are working Overseas; (3) That standards of Gulf life have changed, new enter prises have sprung up and that others T^ill give 'better wages if Government will not; (4) That, particularly in the Vernacular Office, oppor tunity for corruption on a large scale exists# 4 # I will deal with these points in order. I was astonished to find on going into the matter that out of our small cadre, in the last seven years, no less than five clerks v/ith 3-21 years 1 service have 'been bhliged to resign owing to ill-health, losing all pension rights; that two had died of heart failure; and that out of three who had lived to earn a pension only two are alive the other having died the year after his re tirement. A third man has recently died in Karachi from cerebral trouble in circumstances which must in part be traced to his service in the Gulf. It will be realised that conditions like these, which can perhaps only be equalled on the 7/est Coast of Africa demand special consideration. It is an accepted principle with other Governments that unhealthy localities demand higher pay or more favourable pension conditions. The second of these principles does not obtain here, except it may be pointed out in the case of the Vice- Consul of the Levant Service who is employed at Bushire alongside of the officers of the Foreign and Political Department and who alone counts three years towards pension for two years service in the Gulf. For our staff our Indian Fundamental Rules apply on equal terms in every way in Bushire, Bunder Abbas, khscat as in Kashmir and Quetta. 5. As regards (2) it has hitnerto not been recognised that all Indians serving in the Gulf are as much overseas as the British Officer in India, and in some cases nearly as far fromfrom their homes. They have to live under conditions more expensive than. India, far from their relations, debarred from participating in the family ceremonies which mean so much to the Indian mind, unable to take short leave, and finally and most important of all they are obliged to maintain two establishments for the sake of the education of their children. I have endeavoured to meet these points in my proposals by the provision of pay on the analogy of Overseas Pay called^ Gulf Allowance to be drawn as Special Pay. Persian employes serving in Arabia or Arabs serving in Persia, have the same difficulty though perhaps in a less degree. But besides sickness and death there are other -oices to be contended with in keeping up our strengtn. During tne same period of seven years before mentioned no less than 12 clerks have resigned to better themselves. In India it is almost unheard of for ministerial officials to leave Govern ment service, but conditions in the Gulf have undergone a radical cnange in the last fifteen years. Tme advent ox hie Anglo-Persian Oil Company has transformed standards of living. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company rates of pay for Indian clerks range from Rs. 150-790 per mensem and in addition to a liberal Provident Fund, free furnished quarters, ice, oil, gas, current, petrol and lubricating oil for those owning a car or motor bicycle are provided. 7/hat these concessions mean can be realized when it is stated tnat fiesh water costs 2 annas a tin at Auwait (a Junioi* clerx. paying on an average Rs. 20 a months 5 and tnat elec^xic curient in at Bushire is cnarged for/tne rate of 12 annas a unit - probably the highest rate in the hast. f 7 0 The Turkish Petroleum Company are now proposing to commence work on a large scale in Iraq, and will require many Indian clerks and in addition to tnis firm there aie many others prepared to pay high wages for a ole men. It is surprising to me that we are aole to x-ceep arp clerrs at all. 8.8 . Certain posts particularly in the Vernacular Office offer great scope for dishonesty. The term Vernacular Office is misleading. These men referred to are Interpreters who are present at the trial of all cases in native courts and who have a considerable say in their determination. Their work is most important. When at lie shed and Kerman I raised this question and at Bushire I have found it equally urgent. The Political Agent in a report upon the investigation of a case at Bahrain,which resulted in our having to dispense with the services of an official, confirmed my opinion that when men are under-paid - the pay of the man in question was Rs. 150 per mensem, his opportunities great - it is not to he wondered at if they reimburse themselves by 'dishonest methods. One of my Chief Interpreters himself told me he was offered Rs.3000 or 6 months pay to assist in the altering of a judgment in the Persian Courts in a single case in which British subjects were concerned. Such means are in full accord with the customs of the countries in which these officials find themselves though not in consonance with the ideals of the Government they serve and upon whom, their lapses, by a paradoxical situation, reflect discredit, xrxxxgx although there is little public opinion to condemn them. It is only by a sufficient scale of pay that a public opinion among our own staff can be formed. History in India is sufficient to prove the truth of this statement. I have, then, considerably improved the pay and prospects of the Vernacular staff in my proposals. 9. To remove these abuses and render the conditions of the Gulf service such that suitable men will be content to join it and to remain in it I have made certain proposals. They ares- (a) The introduction of a Time Scale in place of Grade Pay; (b) Upper and Loy/er Divisionsj (c) Leave and Training Reserve; (d) Increase of two Extra Assistant Residents in the English Office? at the same time reducing one Vernacular ■- Office Extra Assistant Resident. Thii•— - mm This cannot be done 'without adding to our budget but I have no hesitation in saying that the present economy is bad business on the part of the Government. 10. The model that has been followed in my suggestions is that of Rajputana with which my Secretaries have been most familiar and whose system works well and produces excellent bsx clerks. Our lowest rates proposed are considerably higher than theirs, but there is a limit/ below which an educated Indian cannot exist in the Gulf. It is essential that the Confidential Clerk who deals with our most secret files on questions of policy should be a Gazetted Officer but I am of the opinion that his appointment should be by selection and outside the cadre even if made from it. A separate representation will be made on this subject. The rates proposed for the Head Clerks are the same as Rajputana except that our Grade II Head Clerks will not get selection grade pay and that all our Head Clerks will receive Rs. 50 Gulf Allowance. 11. The system of Grade Pay by appointment has worked badly and causes endless difficulties, and its successful administration demands the skill of an international chess player. If clerks in a certain grade take leave they must be relieved by others of a similar grade, probably at the other end of the Gulf, and they in their turn by the next avail able man in the next grade. This creates further vacancies and transfers. If the next most senior clerk is not given by serving in the grade, and his claims cannot be overlooked. As the distances involved are often great, considerable cost to Government in travelling allowance is involved. I may mention that we have had 3 changes of Head Clerks in Bushire during the last 6 months owing to this system. 12 . «12. A time Scale with, say, two efficiency bars and four selection 1st Grade head Clerkships does away with this difficulty and renders it possible for any clerk to relieve another without regard being necessarily nad to tne seniority of the post, a seniority which in practice is not always essential; in considering postings more senior and oetter- paid clerks would naturally be appointed to more arduous posts, but there would not be the disheartening block in pay which occurs under the present system. Under the system now employed unless senior clerks die or resign, a man at tne top of his grade might and in fact does through no fault of his own receive no increase in pay for years. A Time Scale relieves this defect and ensures an even increase of pay . v spread over a term of years and is a much more atcractijfte proposition to likely candidates. 13. An Upper Division enables better prospects to be held out to men with special qualifications, and also as 50 ^ of the vacancies will be open to Lower Division men who pass the examination, they xiave an incentive to work which does not at present exist. It is intended to adopt tne Rajputanu rules for recruitment to a promotion in the two Divisions• 14. A Leave and Training Reserve of two Upper Division and two Lower Division clerks is essential. Our present system of recruitment would be laughable if it were not tragic. Leave vacancies usually occur for about four months. As the fare to Karachi and back is more than two months* salary it is impossible to obtain men from India for so snort a period, and it becomes necessary to engage the first out-of-work English-knowing man available in the local bazaar. When a man has acted in two or three leave vacancies he gets a lien upon a permanent appointment and unless he does some thing particularly foolish is usually automatically confirmed. By this method we cannot nope to get tne type of men i squired, and it should be noted tnat four out our last ^ive recruitsrecruits werejjbtained in tali 3 manner. Wnat is required is 3 . definite civil service idown to tiie sciiools and colleges of India • 15. It will be noticed that the number of clerics asked for is slightly in excess of that sanctioned for Rajputana, but the distances to men f s homes are much greater, and as their leave does no 0 commence till tney reach Karachi their absence from duty is longer. There will be no extra cost to Government by the insti tution of a leave reserve, for in practice it is necessary to employ temporary men to replace clerks proceeding on leave. These temporary men draw tne pay of the permanent incumbents, the pay of the men on leave being provided for under a separate budget head. In point of fact a saving may be made witn a leave reserve as it has often been found necessary to pay the temporary employe' the maximum pay of tne grade, whereas a permanent man would have to start at the bottom, thereoy causing a saving to Government. 7 /e are thus able to oifer a permanent and pensionable appointinent from the start, and so can iriport men from India who would not accept a four-months appointment for fear of being left stranded xar from tieir no me at the end of their employment. me practice already mentioned fur of employing temporary local men in our offices is also to be deprecated on other grounds whicn are self evident if men are not re-employed. • Vitn reference to the leave reserve it is proposed, should there be no objection, to post these clerks for training for six months to some Secretariat in India to obtain a 'Draining in accounts and office work Y/hich it is not possible to impart here. Ror training purposes an allotment of Rs. 1200 per annum would be necessary. 16. A state of confusion which at present exists in the Town Office 01 3ushire is principally due to a change made £n 1925 in amalgamating the post of Registrar and Treasury OfficerOfficer, a change v/hich has not worked well in practice. The work of the Treasury Officer has increased with the abolition of rupee currency and increases with every new rule enforced by the Audit Department for the greater check of accounts* It is a whole time work and cannot possibly be combined with that of Registrar. A Registrar should be a less harrassed individual who is able to view the work of the office as a whole and to see that everything functions smoothly and that nothing is forgotten or overlooked. At present tne Registrar is so overcome by his Treasury responsibilities that he is unable to give of his best and to supervise the office work in general as a Registrar should and he is too overworked to be satisfactory in either place. The Secretary is obliged to work three days a week at Sabzabad - 7 miles away - and the need for supervision by a Superintendent is therefore all the greater. I regard the re-creation of this post as so important that I am prepared to sacrifice the 2nd Interpreter ship to obtain it and I have accordingly omitted this post from my proposition statement though I would rat ler have maintained two first class interpreters of gazetted rank - one for Persian and one for Arabic work - owing to the fact that apart from the duties already named they translate important and confidential letters to and from Arab States and Persian officials. 17. The English Office with only one gazetted post as compared with the Vernacular Office four lias at present very poor prospects. I would urge therefore that the Superinten dent and Treasury Officer at Muscat should be $iven gazetted rank. As Treasy Officer his responsibilities are great specially when it is recalled that the Political Agent , \ is absent on recess during three months of the year. It is in point of fact a matter of sm surprise that the post has not already been made a gazetted one. I believe I am correct v in saying that Treasury Officers in India are always oi gazetted rank. ¥nenasm When the allowances of this post are taken into consi deration the extra cost entailed by the above proposal will be small as the proposition statement will show and I would be prepared to reduce the post of Shroff at Rs. 50 per mensem towards meeting the amount necessary. 13. The resurrection of the post of Treasury Officer at Bushire and the enhancement of the status of the Superin tendent at Muscat will much improve the prospects of the English Office and go far to render it attractive to able men. I attach proposition statements which show my scheme in detail. It will be noticed that the estimated increased average annual cost is some Rs. 13000 plus Rs. 1200 for training reserve but the saving in travelling allowance will certainly be Rs. 3000 per annum* I xadck would therefore request that, in view of the reasons I have detailed, the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the proposals put forward. It must be remembered that the policy of high tariffs on necessaries (156^ on sugar and tea) of the Persian Government has made Persia far more expensive to live in. The need for improvement in the Gulf Services cannot be denied. Such increase as may be necessary in the pay of the Residency Office will in time be covered by economies in the Public Works Department which I consider desirable and will propose, but in the meantime this re-organization which I now propose is a very urgent and immediate necessity. 19. As soon as the revision scheme is sanctioned I intend sending copies of it to the Aligarh and other Universities in India with a view to obtaining men of intelligence and education. I have, etc., Sd.

L*B.H. liawortn, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Hew Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to state that in my letter Ho. 5-64/149, dated the 3rd January 1928, in forwarding my pro posals for the re-organization of the Gk tablishine nt of the Persian Gulf, I stated in paragraph 10 that I considered the Confidential Clerk of my office should have the rank of a gazetted officer. 2. As I have said in the letter quoted, my Confidential Clerk deals with our most secret files, he knows of our intentions with regard to the air route, Banrain, Ion Saud, Persia, or any other secret subject, has access to every letter I may write on policy in the Persian Gulf and registers all confidential books. He also notes on all legal cases. 3. The present incumbent of the post is a 3.A. and an LL.B. with a first class knowledge of Englisn and drafting. 4. His pay is Rs. 250/- plus Rs. 50/- allowance and he has no prospects except by changing his appointment and enter- ing the general cadre for promotion. 5. I am very strongly of the opinion that owing to the responsible and highly confidential nature of his work the officer holding the appointment should be gazetted, but I would also point out that unless he has some prospects no one of the capacity to hold the appointment would continue in it.6 . 6. On my arrival in Busliire the first point I noted was that all continuity was lost. -To one knew what had occurred in the past or where to look for past events. Continuity is the one essential in politics and as it is difficult to get it in the two Secretaries it is essential that it should oe available in the office. But witnout prospects this continuity is impossible. It is well worth paying for. 7. I would then on both grounds i.e. responsibility and prospects entailing continuity, recommend that Hie appointment be made that of a gazetted officer and orought upon a time scale commencing at Rs. 300/- with Rs• 50/- Gulf allowance, and rising by annual increments of Rs. 20 to Rs.500/- the Gulf allowance to rise to Rs.100/- as in the case of other gazetted officers, when Rs. 400/- pay is reached. A proposition statement is attached. Trie immediate increase is only Rs. 50/r. 3. Rree.quarters are supplied but Rs. 50/- for house rent should be added with the proviso that it is only to be paid when free quarters are not available. 9. The above would make the appointment equal with the other gazetted appointments in the main proposition statement other than the Registrar. 10. The appointment is essentially one to be kept out- g ide the general cadre, appointment to oe made by special selection. 11. On the appointment being made a gazetted one the / title might with advantage be changed to ’Confidential Assis- tant’* on the analogy of the other gazetted appointments which are termed ’’Extra Assistant Residents'.’ I have, etc., 3d.

Revision scheme for the improvement of the conditions of service of the clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of hr. Mukherjee t s letter ho. F*25-j^/28, dated the 19th November 1923 on which the requisite action is being taken. 2. I am in entire agreement with what Sir Lionel Haworth has said in his letter No. 5-64/149 of the 3rd January 1928. In order to secure efficiency and content ment in the clerical service of tnis Residency it is im- parative that the conditions of service be revised. At the same time I am doubtful how far Government are de sirous at the present time, when the general question of affairs in the Gulf are under particular discussion, in pushing forward any scheme for revision of establishment and it seems possible that the decision may be delayed. Meanwhile it seems i nparative that something be done ‘to alleviate the position and to hearten the clerical staff. 3. As the simplest solution I would propose that as a temporary measure tne establishment of the Persian Gulf Residency should receive from the 1st April 1923 the Gulf allowances proposed in Sir Lionel Haworth* s letter at the following ratess- Registrarr s Registrar 2c Treasury Officer ) (400-20-500) ) InterDreter 2c Indian Asstt* ) Rs. 100 each p.m. Read Olerks (200-10-250) ' 50 -do- Glerks 8c Interpreter (150-10-200) * 35 -do- Glerka and Munshis (120-5-150) rt 30 -do- Glerks and Hunshis (100-4-120) n 25 -do- Two statements are appended showing under Divisible and ITon-divisible expenditure the cost of the concession which will amount to Rs. 7440 and Rs. 1560 annually under Divisible and ITon-divisible respectively. In the case of the appointments of Head Clerk, Bandar Abbas and 2nd Clerk, Mo hammer ah to wnich the special pay attached at present is greater than tne Gulf allowance admissible under the proposal now made I recommend that so long as the two appointments are filled by the permanent incumbents of the posts the allowances to be drawn by them should be at the rate sanctioned at present i.e. Rs. 50 p.m. I have, etc., 3d. 3V.7.
