Shaikh Hamad has had trouble with his teeth for some time past and I was given to understand that he was seriously ill and had been living on a milk diet for the last seven days. The Shaikh alluded to the unfortunate condition of his son and said that he would like him to come to Bahrain for treatment. I.pointed out to the Shaikh that the most efficacious way of achieving his object would be for him, the Shaikh, to write a personal letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain who I felt would be likely to give it reasonable consideration and Shaikh Abdullah said that he would do so, but I am happy to be able to record that up to the present no such communication has been made and Bahrain has been spared the difficulties of a visit in the immediate future of such a troublesome person as Shaikh Hamad. 2. At the Shaildi f s request I lunched with Abdullah bin Darwish who is now the right-hand man and co-partner with Shaikh Hamad in practicallyWery underhand dealing of any magnitude which takes place in Qatar. 3. The copy was completed of the draft agreement and at that moment the Shaikh stated quite correctly, for the call to prayer could be distinctly heard, that he wished to go and say the evening prayer. He left, but had gone scarcely two minutes when he send for Saleh bin Mana. The events now to be detailed did not come to light immediately but I have no doubt that they are correct. On Saleh bin Mana leaving the audience room he was instructed by the Shaikh of Qatar to go to Shaikh Hamad, show him the proposed agreement, and instruct him to affix the Shaikh of Qatari seal to the document. It is interesting to note that Shaikh 1 , Shaikh Hamad the second son and tl: ir-presumptive / Hamad2 Hamad should have succeeded in so far gaining control as to have the custody of that most precious of all the Arab emblems of sovereignty the signet ring. It appears that Saleh bin Mana went to Shaikh Hamad who read the document through, flew into a temper, it. must be remembered he had a severe tooth-ache and has had for some days previously, said that his father had sold the country to the Al Khalifah, that he would have no hand in such a proceeding and would not affix the sealr Saleh bin Mana having no alternative returned v to the Shaikh of ^atar and told him what had occurred with the result that the old man was most upset, became querulous and tore the document into pieces which he cast from him. Saleh bin Mana returned to Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and myself and stated briefly what had occurred. Naturally we were both disgusted and disappointed and when the Shaikh returned immediately prior to the evening meal I asked him whether the document had been completed. He became incoh erent and it was with difficulty that we made out that he had decided that he must make various changes in the form and words of the agreement. I protested that he as the Shaikh of Qatar had given his word, that it was impossible to do business when he changed his mind every half an hour, and that as far as I was concerned the matter was ended. We sat down to dinner, a dismal meal with our host cursing the servants, his son Shaikh Ali behaving more like an elderly ewe than ever, Saleh bin Mana and Khan Bahadur S a iyid Abdur Razaak not eating at all, and myself trying to think of some way out of the impasse. No further mention was made that evening of the subject but I decided to spend the night in Saleh bin Mana f s house in Doha and to send the launch round to Zubarah to meet me there at about mid-day on the 17th June. I informed the Shaikh that I proposed to return via Zubarah and that I would call in the next day in the morning on my way to Zubarah in order to say goodbye.Extract from Note on tour to ^atar dated the 18th June, 1944 At approx.tme.tely half past eight on the morning of the 17th I left for Zubarah via Hiyan. 0;n our arrival at Hiyan we were again most cordially received by the old Shaikh and after the interchange of compliments appropriate to the occasion one of those secret whispered converstaions which was always a feature of such discussions took place between Saleh bin Mana and our host the outcome of which was that our host turned to me and said that he wanted to speak to me about the Zubarah agreement. We started all over again and eventually he agreed to the formula of the evening before with an exception and that exception was the \A deleting of the word • This was moderately satisfactory although not as pleasant as had been the prospect of the night before, but I felt that the deletion of that particular word might be considered as advantageous to the A1 Khalifah rather than the reverse and that it was possible that Shaikh Salman could be persuaded to accept. Once again the ceremony of copying was gone through, once again came the time for signature, and at the suggestion of Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Bazaak the Shaikh of ^atar signed the document in the presence of his son Ali, Saleh bin Mana, Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razaak, and muself. He then said to Shaikh Ali 'Take this paper, show it to Hamad, and tell him to seal it”. Shaikh Ali took the paper and there was some swift thinking. I turned to the Shaikh and said ' It is really unnecessary. Your Excellency has signed which is better than any seal”. There was an immediate chorus from Khan Bahadur S a iyid Abdur Razaak and Saleh bin Mana of approval and ^haikh Ali stood in the doorway uncertain which way to go until to the relief of all of us the Shaikh of C^atar said ' It matters not u and the document passed into my keeping. Just before I left I asked the Shaikh whether there was any chance of his going back on what had now been agreed and he assured me that there was no chance whatsoever.COPY * © SECRET.

Dear Prior, Y/ill you please refer to your demi-official endorsment No. 679-S dated the 4th July 1944 ? We have read, with much interest, Hickinbotham*s note on the Bahrain-Qatar Agreement dated the 17th June, 1944. It has been suggested that one inducement, working on both Shaikhs to reach an agreement may have been the feeling that they could not afford to maintain this quarrel in face of Ibn Saud's growing power and possible agression on &lt;4atar boundaries from the South. But it is a little disturbing to note that Shaikh Hamad, who refused to affix the seal to the document ( and it never was affixed), is the heir-presumptive to ^atar; and we should be glad of your views on the possible effect of this circumstance on Bahrain-Qatar relations at a later date- I am sending a copy of this to Peel. Yours sincerely, Sd/- O.K.CAROE. The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C-I.E#, Political Resident in the Persian gulf, B U 3 H I R E. CONFIDENTIAL . D.O.No. C/138. Dear Caroe, Please refer to your demi-official No. D.9670-MS/44 dated the 3rd August, 1944. I do not think that fear of Ibn Saud had any effect on the reconciliation. I think that both sides were heartily sick of the quarrel and glad to find a solution which involved the Hast loss of face. Hickinbotham has just been over here, and I consulted him. He agrees with the view expressed above, and says that the Saudis do not seem to have taken any action at all over the frontier incident. 2. Nor do I attach any importance to the document being signed and not sealed. Hamad could not go back on his father 1 s signature and in any case he was not asked to sign it the second Rk day when it was actually executed. Once the agreement had been acted on it would be considered as binding on both parties, and Hamad could not repudiate it later. Office of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz.

The Shaikh is a strong old man who responds to treatment wonderfully, and will he need at his age. Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah, who also has diabetes, seem ed to be in good health and made his usual request for aphrodisiacs. Hamad*s second hobby is collecting drugs of ail sorts and storing them in his room, He has a fine collection of portable medicine chests including a Moroccan leather German made one. This, however, did not prevent him from purloining a bottle of haemoglobil from behind his father*s back.* Dr. Steele caught him at it, but he put his finger to his lips enjoining silence on the doctor.

He stayed the night with Mr. Dickson of P.C.L. and the following day continued by car to Dohah. There the Political Agent stayed in the house of Saleh al Man*ah. It was sc very hot and flyblown in the afternoons but the evenings were pleasant enough. The Political Agent called on Shaikh Abdullah who seemed not too well and found the climb to the third floor room a great effort, and having climbed there wexaciia^ could not sit in comfort because it was too windy. All the excitement caused a rise in the Shaikh*s temperature and his absence from the dinner which the Political Agent attended that evening. It was a good dinner at which Shaikh Hamad sat on alone stuffing himself with fat and rice long after everybody else has left the meal. The Political Agent took meals with the other leading families, the Darwish and the al Man*ah. The purpose of the visit was to discuss points in the old hardy annual case of Zubarah, the ownership of certain shoals, and assistance to P.C.L. Some progress was made.

POLITICAL58/7 Q ) P_eath of Sliaikh Hamad, Heir Apparent t o Shaikh Abdulla of Qatar. Early in' May Shaikh Hamad, a chronic diabetic, obese, and of poor general health was taken ill with - fever and diarrhoea. He was treated for some days by an Indian doctor from Doha but as his condition did not improve Dr.AAderson of the Petroleum Development, Qatar, was called in. ^ 5 ^ By that time the patient was suffering from high fever with a rapid irregular pulse and Dr. Anderson realizing the seriousness of his condition had him removed to an air-conditioned bungalow at DUKHAN and remained in constant attendance. He was diagnosed as acute dysfentery (amoebic) complicating diabetes and was treated accordingly. After some days his temperature returned to normal and * &amp; ene hal condition steadily improved. His pulse, however, a A t ^ Ugh n ? t 50 ra P id was still irregular. The condition of the patient’s heart still giving rise to anxiety, Dr. Anderson kept him under treatment in DUKHAN. About 20th May with his temperature normal and condition seemingly progressing favourably he was suddenly seized with severe intractable pains in the head and neck. i.ms was followed, a day later by a recurrence of high fever and his general condition rapidly deteriorated. On^the evening of May 26th I was asked by Mr. Lermitte of Petroleum Concessions Limited if T would go over to Qatar for a consultation with Dr. Anderson as Shaikh Hamad’s condition was considered to be grave. Unfortunately the P.C.L. plane was out of action and I had to go over next morning by P.C.L. launch. We did not arrive tilj 2.30 p.m, to find that Shaikh Hamad had died at 12.30 p.m. (May 27th). From discussing the case with Dr, Anderson and considering the case history,record card, temperature chart, laboratory findings etc. I concluded that Shaikh Hamad had died from heart failure and toxaemia following an attack of dysentery^(probably a mixed bacterial and amoebic infection). His previous general condition of Diabetes and obesity were certainly/causes of his failure to recover. P.A. Bahrain,SPNFIMNTIAL No.C/R-4Sr i s.

Sir, I here the honour to report th^t Hie Excellency Sheikh Abdullah bin Qaeim el Thant Qatar hre ©r^ointed his eldest son All ©« succeeeor in nl^cc of his second son Hemwd who died in May last. Hamad, who possessed a much stronger character' than his elder brother was reoogni r as Abdullah* e successor as long ago as 1935* end for several years before his death had been attending to most of the affairs of the State on behalf of his father Who is very old. All was at one time reported to be of a religious turn of mind and to be averse to State affairs. It is dif ficult to prophesy what sort of a ruler he will make, but he is perhaps likely to show a less bitter at itude towards the Shaikh of Bahrain than his father or his late brother. Shaikh Abdullah, although he is reputed to be over 80, and is probably about 70 , and is suffering from diabetes, h^s shown renewed vigour since Hamad*s death, and may live for several years yet. 2, It is rumoured that Shaikh Abdullah has designated Khslif&amp;h, who is the third son of the late Hamad and a boy of 18, as the second successor to the Sheikhdom. If this Is true the action is unfortunate and may lead to trouble later, as AH has a large number of sons of hie own. 3 .

Dear Sir Will you please refer to your letter dated the 15th January, 1949, regarding the transfering to Shaikh Abdullah’s account of the amount still outstanding to the credit of his son, the late Shaikh Hamad? 2. There is no objection to your making the transfer. Yours faithfully Political Agent, Bahrain2i/6 Confidential. M ($) u0 PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, W Bahrain, Slst January, 1949. .A ' Please refer to your semi-official letter No. C/R-37 of the 24th January on the subject of the recognition of Ali as heir-apparent of the Ruler of Qatar. 2. I am inclined to think that we should ajxrbde to Shaikh Abdullah's request, if received lp^*Titing, if only because in 1935 we recognised Shaikhjlaitiad as heir-apparent in return for a definite quid pr o ^qifo vide Fowle's letter C/129 of the 11th Nay, 1935,.^tp^haikh Abdullah, and even if there is no danger of the shaikh's claiming that his part of the agreement is now null and void, I feel that we are to some extent under an obligation to allow him to substitute Ali for Hamad now that the latter has died. 3. Ali is not as strong a character as Hamad, but he is not obviously disqualified from the rulership by mental deficiency or anything of that sort and might well prove a more satisfactory Ruler than his father from our point of view. The fact of our recognition would probably prevent the succession being disputed and in any case in the event of a dispute we are absolved from any obligation to interfere by paragraph 6 of Fowle's letter to the Ruler already referred to. 4. Unless therefore you have anything further to urge I am proposing to recommend to the Foreign Office that Ali should be recognised by His Majesty's Government as heir- apparent to Shaikh Abdullah provided as a minimum Ali signs an agreement to accept the Treaty of 1916 (and possibly other agreements) similar to that signed by Hamad in 1935 and the only point which I am now considering is whether we ought not to take the opportunity of endeavouring to obtain from the Ruler his written consent to the bringing into force of one or all of the Articles of the 1916 Treaty held in abeyance by Sir Percy Cox's letter of the 3rd November, 1916.. I should be grateful for your early views on this suggestion. ! C.J. Pelly, Esq., C.B.E., political Agent, Bahrain. ia No../&lt;/-.6o B A ’ a A : T ' ■ ^ 'i -rPT. 3 FES 'CONFIDENTIAL. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 17th March, 1949. S.O.No.C/R-95. Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to your semi-official letter No.(18/7/49), dated.the 31st January, 1949, on the subject of the recognition of Ali as heir-apparent of the Ruler of Qatar. 2. I think that we should recognise Ali as heir- apparent provided he signs an agreement to accept the Treaty of 1916 in full and the Ruler gives his written consent to the bringing into force forthwith of Articles 7, 8, and 9, held in abeyance by Sir Percy Cox’s letter of the 3rd November, 1916. 3. I envisage our Agent residing at Dohah. 4. I am addressing you separately about the con dition regarding the slaves. 6 . May I write to Shaikh Abdullah asking him to make a request for the recognition of Ali in writing? Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.Confidential , PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 24th March, 1949. (18/12/49) Please refer to my despatch No. 174 of the SOth December, 1948, in which I reported that the Ruler of Qatar had appointed his son All as his successor in place of Hamad who died last May. 2. Hamad, although the second and not the eldest son of the Ruler of Qatar was recognised as his successor by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in 1936 against the usual practice observed in the Gulf in return for the grant of the oil concession in the Shaikh’s territories to a British Company, and an undertaking that the Treaty of 1916 should be binding on the Shaikh’s heirs and successors. I enclose herewith a copy of the correspondence which took place with Shaikh abduilah at the time. These letters are of considerable importance and cover matters other than those discussed in this letter. They were forwarded to India Office under this Residency letter No. C/137 of the 12th May, 1936, and this reference will enable you to trace the correspondence leading up to their issue if you so desire. 5 ' V 5 3. Shaikh Abdullah has now asked that his eldest son All should be recognised by His Majesty’s Government as his successor. As we conceded the point in the case of Hamad and in view of the valuable quid pro quo then obtained, I do not think we should refuse to accede to the Shaikh’s request. I am proposing, however, to seize the occasion to endeavour to persuade the Shaikh to give his written consent to the bringing into force Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the 1916 Treaty which are held in abeyance by Sir Percy Cox’s letter of the 3rd November, 1916. I hope we may be successful in doing this but I do not want to make it a sine qua non for the recognition of All as Shaikh Abdullah’s successor. 4. From the personal point of view, I consider All who is about sixty years old suitable for the appointment. He does not possess such a strong personality as his late brother and was always kept in the back ground while the latter was alive. I had a talk with him during my visit to Qatar in February and found him very pleasant mannered and reasonably intelligent, and I think we ©re likely to find him easier to deal with than either his father or Hamad. As reported in my despatch under reference, the Shaikh's relations and the leading notables have all agreed in writing to his selection ^ as heir-apparent and I consider it very improbable that the v&gt; \&gt; succession will be disputed but we should make it clear that V $ ^ our support for him will be limited to the same extent as in the case of Hamad, c.f. paragraph 6 of Fowle’s letter C/129^of the 11th May, 1936, a copy of which forms one of the enclosures to this letter. 4. If possible, I should be grateful if you would let me know by telegram that the proposals contained in this letter are acceptable in order that negotiations may be undertaken with Shaikh Abdullah as soon as possible.
