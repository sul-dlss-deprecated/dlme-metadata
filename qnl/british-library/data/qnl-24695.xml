As regards lighting and buoyage of Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government consider that, unless there is reason to think that Persian Government will now accept proposed stipulation as to formal agreement in terms set forth in clause 2 of my telegram No. 113 of 8th March, best course will be to withdraw it altogether. When informing Persian Government that it is withdrawn, you should add that His Majesty’s Government regard themselves as possessing prescriptive right to control of lighting and buoying arrangements in the Gulf, which, if occasion arose, they would not hesitate to enforce. Arrangement arrived at regarding your supervision of expenditure is sufficient. As regards Bahreinis and trucial subjects, you should make statement in sense of last paragraph of my telegram No. 113 of 8th March. Subject to the above conditions and tender system for purchases, you may draw on Imperial Bank of Persia and may pay over first month’s instalment of Fars advance. [554—195]CONFIDENTIAL.

Acceptance of our proposal respecting control over expenditure and respecting the tender systems for purchases. 2. A written arrangement respecting the lighting and buoying of the Gulf. We would not insist on mention in this question of policing territorial waters otherwise than for necessary protection of lights and buoys provided that you had a verbal assurance that no question will be raised to our prescriptive rights in the Gulf generally. 3. If we take note of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs’ assurance not to alienate any Persian islands in the Gulf to any foreign Power it might be quoted hereafter as an admission on our part of Persian rights in Bahrein. It should therefore be made clear that His Majesty’s Government maintain their attitude in regard to the protection of Bahreinis’ trucial rights, and, in refraining from pressing their request for Persian recognition of this claim, do so only on the under standing that their rights will not be disputed in practice. |409—2irCONFIDENTIAL.

Townley, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. In my telegram No. 37-115, dated January 9th, I had the honour to suggest, Addressed to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, amongst other desiderata, the preliminary repeated to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and settlement of which by the Persian Govem- Government of India. ment was desirable, the abandonment by the latter of its empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrain, and the recognition of our protective rights in regard thereto, and our title to protect Bahrain subjects in Persia. It will be remembered that His Majesty’s Foreign Office intimated in 1909 Foreign Office, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, that it Was intended to raise the CjUestlOn No. 17, dated 16th February 1909. again when an opportunity presented itself. 2. The subject of Persian claims to Bahrain and the attitude adopted by the Persian Government in the matter of the protection of Bahrainis in Persia, is doubtless familiar to Your Excellency, and it will be sufficient for me, before mentioning such local developments as have occurred since the matter was last under discussion, to refer to the correspondence ending with Sir G. Barclay’s despatch No. 116, dated 4th June 1909, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office. 3. During 1910 an arrangement was come to with the Shaikh of Moham- . ^ c merah, in regard to the protection of Vide enclosure to His Majesty s Ministers des- &gt; i - P i e irii i •. i • patch No. 235, dated 23rd December 1910 , to His Bahrain which has tulnllea its object, in Majesty’s Foreign office. so £ ar t j iat n0 f ur ther question in this regard has arisen since then in Arabistan, where, so recently as June 1912, the interven tion of His Majesty’s Consul, in regard to a Bahrain subject, has been accepted, apparently without demur, by the Provincial Director of Customs at Mohammerah. , , , . f r, • This departmental recognition has also dency despatch No. 76-2888, dated 4th November been accorded, though With SOme hCSlta- &gt;912. tion, at Lingah.* 4. In Bahrain itself, the element of petty difficulty and intrigue arising out of the lingering fiction regarding Persia’s claim to the Islands, though for the time dormant, still survives. It will be remembered that in July 1910+ His + Legation, to Re.id.at, telegram No. ,63, dat.d Majesty’s Foreign Office agreed to the 17th July 1910. expulsion from Bahrain by the shaikh of a certain Persian merchant Abdul Nabi, who had been constructively treating Bahrain as a Persian port by issuing internal coastal tezkarah passes to Persians proceeding from Bahrain to Persian ports. When, however, authority was received for this man’s expulsion several circumstances combined to make it necessary to suspend action for the time: firstly, the Shaikh now proved un willing to act against Abdul Nabi, and secondly, it was discovered thst the British Indian Director of Bahrain Customs had innocently, in the absence of Abdul Nabi, signed some passes to the same effect, without understanding the bearing of them.As we were at the time engaged in the framing of an Order in Council which would put us in a position for dealing with foreigners effectively ourselves, it was thought prudent by the Political Agent and myself, in view of the Shaikh’s uncertain attitude and the above circumstances to postpone dealing with Abdul Nabi, until it had been brought into operation. The issue of the said Order Tias been delayed from month to month, but is on the point of issue, and meanwhile, the objectionable practice has not of late been in evidence. 5. Having regard to the fact that the Persian Government based their claim to the sovereignty of Bahrain on no better grounds than a Convention, dated 1822 which was not only never ratified but was specifically repudiated by both the Persian and British Governments, the abandonment of the claim would not appear to involve to them any real loss of prestige or amour fropre, and, by removing from the category of disputed issues a matter which has caused a vast amount of correspondence and no little diplomatic friction in the past, can only tend to improve our relations with the Persian Government and its local officials. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Foreign Office and to the Government of India. r '&gt; V I \ C82FP—44— 7 * 2 'I 3 —GCBP Simla,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] PERSIA.

Si rj Bushire, January 22, 1913. IN continuation of my preceding despatches, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch, dated the 22nd January, 1913, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister with regard to our present position vis-a-vis the Persian Government in the matter of our right to protect in Persia subjects of the trucial chiefs of Oman.

Townley. (No. 17/255.) gj r Bushire, January 22, 1913. IN my telegram dated the 19th January 1 had the honour to mention, amongst other desiderata, the recognition by the Persian Government of our protective rights over the Trucial Coast, and our right to protect in Persia subjects of the trucial chiefs of Oman. 2. Our position vis-a-vis the Persian Government in this matter differs from that in regard to the question of the protection of Bahreinis, inasmuch as it does not appear that specific representations have been ever made on the subject at Tehran. 3. The question, like many others, was first raised by the action of one of the Belgian Customs officials in the Gulf, who formally declined in 190/ to accept British intervention in two cases concerning subjects of the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Shargah, quoting in justification “ Tehran circular No. 1301, dated the 4th February, 1905,” of which, however, he declined to furnish a copy. In reply to my suggestion that we should obtain formal recognition of our position in this matter from the Persian Government, Mr. Marling replied that our right to insist on the Persian Government accepting such intervention was unassailable in view of our published treaties of 1892, and that it seemed probable that His Majesty’s Government would insist on final recognition of our rights respecting Bahrein and Bahreinis also, and that he was inclined to think that these matters would best be dealt with simultaneously. Sir G. Barclay, however, subsequently expressed the opinion that, although we could not admit any refusal on the part of the Customs or other authorities to recognise our rights to intervene on behalf of these sheikhs, he preferred not to raise the question for the present except in the event of our intervention being challenged in some more specific case than those at the time under consideration. 4. The issue has not been actively raised by the Persian Government since, and at Lingah and elsewhere the local authorities and Customs officials now accept our intervention in matters concerning Oman subjects without demur, but, in the absence | of any specific recognition of our title and the issue of instructions to local authorities by the Central Government, they are in a weak position to co-operate with us even when personally friendly and inclined to do so. For example, I would recall the action of the Turkish consul at this port, who proceeded to Lingah in 1911, and, without informing our representative, who is officially in charge of Turkish interests there, enrolled as Turkish subjects some 400 Persian, Oman, and trucial Oman subjects haphazard. Had our position with regard to the latter category been clearer, both we ourselves and the local Persian authorities would have been on stronger ground for taking prompt action on the spot [2804 p—2] 28FEB1S13 0 COPY TO ! ; ' ’ 28 FEB 1913 i SECT;k 1 A‘ Y' 1 o Nto put a term to this and similar intrigues, which, as will be noted from the Persian Gulf Residency Administration Report for 1911, reacted at the time unfavourably on the authority of the Governor of the Gulf Ports at Lingah. ^ 5. Having regard to the position as described above, it will appear that, whilst our title to protect in Persia the subjects of the trucial chiefs of Oman is unassailable, it would be distinctly advantageous to obtain formal recognition thereof from the Persian Government, who can have no reasonable grounds for withholding it.

Cox to Sir Edward Grey. -{Received January 19, 8‘30 p.m.) Bushire, January 19, 1913. (No. 115.)^ {January 19, 4 p.m.) RECENT Reuter telegrams emanating from Tehran and London seem to adumbrate that His Majesty’s Government may be giving lively consideration to the pros and cons of the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government for restoring order on the Bushire-Ispahan road and in Ears generally, and, if this is the case, it can only be in conjunction with an extensive scheme for the financing of the Governor- General by Imperial Government. Without touching on prospects of such a scheme, I venture to urge, in case anything of the sort is on the tapis, the importance of our securing from the Persian Government, in return for such forbearance, the preliminary settlement of various desiderata, regulation of which would assist towards the consolidation of our position and legitimate interests. Immediate loss both in trade and prestige which will be involved to us by further long-suffering is so considerable that it would appear gratuitously quixotic for us to refrain from requiring the Persian Government,-las a condition of it, to recompense us as far as they can for the damage their impotence brings on us. Satisfaction of our requirements in these matters involves no difficulty or loss of authority or dignity for the Persian Government, and moreover, it is not our position vis-d-vis of Persia which we seek to better thereby, but our position vis-d-vis of foreign Powers. To the strengthening of this latter position Persia should be interested little less than ourselves, for she must surely now see in Great Britain a friendly Power whose [? aim] it is to uphold her. Desiderata which occurred to me are as follows :— 1. Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control lighting, buoying, and policing of Gulf in the same way that our position has been recognised in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the position might with advantage be reaffirmed incidentally. 2. Documentary recognition as a permanency of the old prescriptive postal rights and privileges which [? wel still enjoy, and an expression of readiness to see those extended to other Persian ports of the Persian Gulf as occasion may require. 3. Undertaking to refrain from giving any lease or concession, commercial or otherwise, in Southern and South-Western Persia {i.e., in the area comprising the British and central zones under the Anglo-Russian convention), or in Persian islands of the Gulf, to any foreign subjects or Government, without the knowledge and consent of His Majesty’s Government. We have precedent for such a request in the under taking given by the Shah to the Russian Minister referred to in Mr. Marling’s telegram of 27th August, 1908, to the Foreign Office, repeated by me to India on the following day. This perhaps might be secured in the course of current negotiations for mining concessions. 4. Extension of rights of navigation to the Upper Karun. 5. Abandonment of empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and recognition of our protective rights over those islands and Trucial Coast and our title to protect their subjects in Persia. 6. Undertaking to grant option to British company when the time is ripe for formation of lighterage company in Gulf ports. 7. Acceptance of consular officer at Bampur when needed. I make no suggestion here in connection with Kishm-Henjam position, as we appear to be effectively consolidating ourselves in an unobtrusive way, and further openings are likely to offer themselves. I have expressed views on the strategical question in my telegram No. 10, dated 3rd January, to India and Tehran.

In the monthly Diary of this Residency for January 1911 it was reported in ycragraih 19(a) ,(h) and (c) that the Customs Officials newly appointed by the Turkish Government at Ojair and Katif had required the consignees of goods from Bahrein to produce a Certificate from the Ruler of Bahrein that to the effect/thay had been so exported from Bahrein. The issue of such a certificate being regarded with suspicion,the Political Agent was directed to furnish further details. He made enquiries from Sheikh Bsa who evidently did not understand the purpose or effect of the Certificates but replied that thinking that it was an ordinary Customs form ality he had authorised his Customs superintendent to give the Certificate asked for by the Katif Customs,but that as our —our Interests in the matter showed that the .practice was of doubtful expediency he had discontinued it. 3. Farther enquiries by the Political Agent elicited the feet that no duty at all was being charged on products of Bahrein origin,such as lucerne etc*, which were allowed free ' as in the case o£ good® coming from Turkish ports', but that on goods of non-Bahrein origin 11$ duty was being levied. inquiries were then made from His Majesty's Consul Busreh ©s to whether local produce,such ©s lucerne,prawns,etc., of foreign origin were admitted into Busreh and other Turkish ports duty free. He now replies th®t'on luce me, shrimps 'prawns) and such produce of foreign origin © Customs duty Busreh Consulate No.84,dated ) 5th October 1911. ) of 11% is levied, if such produce is accomj£©nied by a certificate of origin. Xn the 'absence of a certificate of origin,an additional charge of ”85^ is levied by the Public Bebt Administration'. I may mention that according to informrstion received from other sources, it is not an additional charge of 85$ that is levied but a duty of 38 $ instead of 11$. That however is a detail with which we ere not at present concerned. 4. The upshot of the foregoing is th©t the Turkish Authorities in the levy of Customs duty are treating Bahrein as®a Turkish territory,r.nd that the Sheikh's Customs either from ignorance or oomplacenoy hc?,ve been playing into their htnds by accepting favoured treatment as a Turkish port. 5. The posit ion, now that it is f ully underst ood ,vvlll be explained to Sheikh 3sa,and he will, no doubt, confirm his instructions for the abandonment of the practice of issuing certificates,bufc I think it advisable to draw the attention of government to the proceedings of the Katif Customs as affording fresh evidence of the persistent pretensions of the ports in rej&amp;rd to the Bahrein Islands.

IT will be within your recollection that one of the chief points of contention in the recent case of the arbitrary arrest of Bahrein natives by the Vali of Bussorah—see Sir Gr. Lowther’s despatch No. 385 of the 3rd ultimo and previous correspondence—was the refusal of the local Turkish authorities to admit the attendance of a British dragoman at the trial. It is therefore satisfactory to learn from His Majesty’s acting consul at Bussorah that in a trial there on the 8th instant, when a native of Bahrein was the plaintiff, the president of the court of first instance invited the British consular dragoman to attend. An objection to his presence was raised by the public prosecutor, but this was ruled out or order, and the dragoman subsequently signed the sentence of the court. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING.

Sir:- I recently reninded Rifaat Pasha that T was still awaiting a reply to my note of April 8th, transmitted to you in my despatch No. 241, of April 11th, with regard to the arrest and detention of three natives of Bahrein, and it was important that this matter should he cleared up before the general negotiations regarding the Persian Gulf proceeded. I explained to him that the under standing on which we had been working was the observance of the status quo, and this arrest of the natives of Bahrein constituted a breach of this status quo. I must therefore ask that the act of the Vali should be disowned and that it should be clearly laid down that the Bahrein passports would be recognised in the future. To this Rifaat Pasha replied that the Porte had committed no act which constituted a breach of the status quo The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.MHMB iM ■ MBBBMiaii quo, that the men in question had heen arrested on a properly formulated charge, had heen found innocent and had heen in due course released. A similar incident night take place anywhere. I replied that the Vali's note to His Majesty's Consul at Basra, which quoted the view of the Ottoman Government, constituted the breach of the status quo. Rifaat Pasha asked me to let him have a copy of this note, v/hich I did later. Hie note is as follows:- 'I have the honour to state that the Ottoman Government neither knows nor admits that the people of Bahrein are under the protection of the British Government', and T pointed out in the note that the Vali quoted his Govemment' s vlews. Pjfaat Pasha argued that an isolated act or communi cation on the part of a Vali could not modify the status quo. To this T observed that it was then easy for the Porte to reply that instructions had heen sent to the Vali not to commit any breach of the status quo and to add that Bahrein passports would he accepted in the future i is Excellency replied that he was quite prepared to send instructionsinstructions to the V&amp;li not t o raise any questions which would constitute a breach of the status quo, but he was at a loss to understand what was meant by the recognition of Bahrein passports, as passports were not asked for or controlled in those portions of the Empire and they had no knowledge of any previous recognition of passports issued in Bahrein. I explained that hy recog nition of the passports it was Implied that in the case of the arrest of a native of Bahrein he should, on seating wnence he came, be allowed to invoke tbe assis tance of the British Consular Authorities. I said that if my note remained unanswered, the nooe of the Vali and the arrest of the men in question might be in the future quoted as establishing the rights of the Porte in the matter, which met with the rejoinder from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that with equal justice might my note be held to establish the His Majesty^ Government in the matter. His Excellency remarked that he could not rights of appreciate the utility of endeavouring to arrive at a settlement of thisthis one question in the Persian Gulf when we were about to endeavour to arrive at a settlement of all of them, and he was evidently most disinclined to put anything on paper, and T gathered from His Excel lency that, if he did so, his reply would he of a con tentious nature. I reminded His Excellency that we had on more than one occasion made it quite clear to the Porte that Bahrein was under the protection of Great Britain Beferring to the question of some compensation to he given to the men in question, which I had put for ward verbally, Bifaat Pasha repudiated all liability for such. He maintained that no claim of such a nature could exist anywhere. There had heen a properly formed charge against then, which had heen examined, hut nad not been substantiated. No other course could have been followed, but because the charge had not heen upheld was no reason for granting compensation. it no uld not be granted in England or any other country he knew of. Hie Excellency promised to examine the note of the ValiVali when T should sent it him, and I will return to one subject, again with His Excellency on an early occasion. I have &amp;c., Ctq rard Lowth e r. (Signed)foreign office, May 23, 1911. /&gt;&gt;' \ 24MAY1911 Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the effect which the formal proclamation of a British protectorate over Bahrein might be expeeted to produce at the present juncture on the negotiations impending with Turkey on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and on British relations with Persia, The reasons for which Sir E. Grey would deprecate the modification of the status q uo which this step ,would involve are set forth in the letter of the 4th instant from this Office and I am to point out that the recognition by the Turkish Government of the right of His Majesty*s Government to protect Bahreinis in the Ottoman Empire forms, as Viscount Morley is aware, one The Under-Secretary of State for India,one of the conditions on which it is proposed to insist in return for British participation in the construction of the maritime section of the Bagdad Railway. This last consideration offers, in Sir E. hrey 1 s opinion, a further motive for abstaining at this moment from a modification of the status quo which could not fail to re-act unfavourably on the negotiations in progress and he would accordingly prefer to postpone, till he has received the reply of the Turkish Government to Sir G. Lowther*s demands, the decision as to what the next step in the matter should be ( assuming, for the moment thattthe nature of that reply will be, as Lord Morley anticipates, such as to necessitate action of some kind ) • In the meanwhile Sir G. Lowther will be instructed, in accordance with your suggestion, to press the Turkish Government for their answer. Sir E. Grey does not share the view expressed3. in your letter that the question of the enforcement of the right of His Majesty's Government to protect Bahreinis in Turkey is one which should be regarded from the point of view of its effect on British relations witn Germany rather than with Turkey, because he i unable to perceive what jastification the former Power could allege for interesting itself in a matter which p r does not appear to concern it at all and it would further, in his opinion, he injudicious to admit in any way the validity of such a claim. Sir S. Grey notes Lord Morley^ opinion that the only prospect of a satisfactory solution of the Bagdad Railway question lies in a preliminary agreement with Germany. As regards this point I am to observe that His Majesty’s Government are not at present discussing the Bagdad Railway with Germany, hut have before them certain proposals from the Turkish Government in regard to the Gulf section. It is clear that it is necessary4. to deal with the Turkish proposals in the fi&amp;et instance before initiating ahy discussions with Germany ; other- -wise there would he two sets of negotiations proceeding concurrently which would probably lead to confusion. Sir E. Grey considers that as soon as His Majesty’s Government are in a position definitely to formulate to the Turkish Government their requirements in connection with their participation in the last section of the Bagdad Railway, it would be well to inform the German Government that these requirements must be met before any agreement can be reached on the subject and to express to them the hope that they will use their influence at Constantinople to secure a satisfactory reply to these demands.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 241 of the 11th instant, my telegram' No. 96 of the 17th instant and other telegraphic correspondence concerning the recent arrest of three natives of Bahrein by Jelal Bey, the Vali of Bussorah, I have the honour to forward copy of Mr. Consul Crow’s despatch No. 14 of the 25th March on the subject. As will appear from the latter, the vali’s action was evidently a deliberate attempt to enforce the contention that Bahrein is Ottoman, and his action was probably the outcome of instructions from the Central Government to the Bussorah authorities. It will be noticed that in the case of* Khalil-bin-Ibrahim in 1908 the then vali informed Mr. Crow in writing that “ his orders were to treat Bahreinese in Turkey as Ottoman subjects.” The present vali’s communication (Enclosure No. 1 in Mr. Crow’s No. 14 of the 25th March, 1911) is very curt and categorical and constitutes a definite written claim which it would be imprudent to overlook. Consequently as hinted in my telegram No. 96; it would seem advisable that we should insist on an answer to my note of the o 8th* April informing us officially and in writing p 4 *! 1 instructed to accept Bahrein passports. passports. that the Vali of Bussorah has been I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 14.) Sir, Bussorah, March 25, 1911. WITH reference to my telegram No. 56 of the 22nd March and No. 61 of to-day respecting three natives of Bahrein arrested by the vali I have the honour to report that, according to passports forwarded by them to this consulate, issued by the Sheikh of Bahrein and duly legalised by the political agent in that island, Issa is the son of Haji Ali-bin-Haji Ahmed-bin-Mehdy, Haji Mohammed Hussein is the son of Haji Ahmed, and Mohammed Salih is the son of Mohammed Ali. These persons are all natives of Bahrein who have proceeded to Bussorah on business and their Bahrein passports are dated the 22nd December, 1910, the 24th December, 1910, and the 3rd March, 1911, respectively. In their letter to me the petitioners state that they are residing at Hamden and have property at Mohammerah and in Bahrein and proceeded to Bussorah on private business, that they were summoned by the Tabour Agassi to the vali’s presence on the 6th (19th) March, who ordered them to take out nufus teskeres as Ottoman subjects, that on their refusal to do so the vali took a guarantee for their appearance on the following day when they were put under arrest and have since been detained by the police. I sent my dragoman to see the commissioner of police in order to ascertain the reason of their arrest, but the commissioner of police said he had been ordered by the vali to give no reply to any person from the consulate who came to enquire about them. I then wrote officially to the vali, copy enclosed, No. 29, asking him the cause of their arrest, and pointing out that they were natives of Bahrein, and their passports were in my hands and at his disposal, if he wished to see them, and I requested him to allow me to communicate with them, and give them the usual consular assistance, as natives of Bahrein enjoyed British protection. The vali in reply, enclosed No. 1, stated that the Ottoman Government neither knew nor admitted that natives of Bahrein were under our protection. [1972 aa —2]9 m H ! The men have applied to me again to-day through their relatives, who state they have now been six days under arrest. The vali will not admit any interference on my part, and, as far as I am able to ascertain, no judicial charge has yet been made against them, and no action taken at the public prosecutors office. # Under these circumstances I have no alternative, but to report their case i(w your Excellency’s consideration, and to suggest that instructions may be telegraphed to the vali to admit our interference on their behalf, and to inform me of the charge, if any, made against them. ( . I would remind your Excellency of the case of Khalil-bm-Ibrahim, a native of Bahrein, who was taken for military service in 1908, and refer you to my despatch No. 93, of the 31st December, 1908, reporting his case. In that instance the vali in a letter No. 270 of the 24th December, 1908, informed me that his orders were to treat Bahreinese in Turkey as Ottoman subjects. I conclude therefore that the vali, in the present case, is following the instructions he has received from Constantinople. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

The said persons have passports granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein and certified by the British political agent in that island. These papers are in my hands. As your Excellency is aware the subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein enjoy British protection.

W11H reference to your despatch No. 114 of the 26th July, 1909, respecting the question of the status of Bahreinis in Persia, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, pointing out that the security and_ prosperity now existing at Mohammerah have attracted considerable numbers of immigrants from Bahrein, who demand to be registered at His Maiesty s consulate and brought under British protection. This has attracted the attention'of otner Bahremis resident in Mohammerah, who now claim similar treatment. Colonel Cox, when at Mohammerah in October last, discussed the matter with the sheikh, and the solution arrived at on that occasion is embodied in the letter from His Majesty s consul at Mohammerah to Sheikh Khazal, which forms Enclosure 3 in this despcitcli. I venture to express the opinion that the arrangement seems an eminently satis factory one, especially in vie-w of the private agreement come to by Lieutenant Wilson with the Deputy-Governor of Mohammerah, referred to in the second paragraph of Lieutenant W ilson s despatch to Colonel Cox of the 21st October. I would propose, subject to your concurrence, to approve the action of Colonel Cox and Lieutenant Wilson in this matter. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. ti Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Sir G. Barclay. (Confidential.) ^ r &gt; Bushire, October 30, 1910. I HAVE the honour to refer to the correspondence on the subject of Bahreinis dwelling or sojourning in Persia, ending with your despatch No. 116, dated the 4th June, 1909, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State. The greater measure of security and prosperity existing in Mohammerah compared attracting a gradually increasing number of to other Persian ports of late years is 0 „ o ^ m amigrant sjr om. Bahre in, and, since the location in those islands of a political agent on behalf of the Government of India (1904), these immigrants have been in the habit of arming themselves with a passport from the Sheikh of Bahrein, countersigned by the political agent, and then, on arrival at Mohammerah, demand to be registered at the British consulate and brought under protection. Jhis development naturally has attracted the attention of the numerous other families of Bahrein origin in Mohammerah who have lived there all their lives, if not for a generation or two, and v r ho came there at a time when there was no question of their having British protection, and became enrolled in the lists of the sheikh’s tribal dependents like other subjects of his. Individuals of this class have of late been importuning the consulate for registra tion, and when I recently visited Bahrein the matter was at a stage which did not admit of its being fenced with or put on one side. At the same time, I was aware that the juncture was a most inconvenient one for asking your Excellency to revive the issue with the Central Government. The subject was therefore discussed frankly with the sheikh, and the solution arrived at my present enclosures explain. It was designedly given a personal and local aspect, in order that His Majesty’s Legation might not necessarily be committed thereby, if it was not approved. On the other hand, it is hoped that it will provide a workable modus vivendi lor Mohammerah, H, [1845 q 15] I copy TO INDIA 1 .4.J*ALl0l t SEGUE TARY'S nand,Ln any case, places us in a better position in regard to Bahreinis than we have been able to achieve in other Persian ports, where we do not register Bahreinis, and whore opposition is invariably offered to the exercise of our good offices m their be I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Government of India. ^ I llcLVG &amp;C ’ P.

I have further come to a private arrangement with Agha Abdi, Deputy- Governor of Mohammerah, whereby he undertakes to refer to me informally all cases concerning Bahreinis, whether registered or not, before taking forcible action, on the understanding that I do not interfere with his legitimate rights in the last resort, to imprison recalcitrant debtors and malefactors, after I have satisfied myself by enquiry of the guilt of the accused persons. It is too soon to predict how this arrangement will work in practice, but I am not without hopes that it may gradually ripen into a full recognition of the position we occupy in regard to the people of Bahrein. 3. I estimate the number of persons entitled, under the new arrangement, to registration at about 100, out of which about 60 may be expected to avail themselves of the privilege. The number of Bahreinis in Arabistan legally entitled to our protection, i.e., born in Bahrein or of parents born in Bahrein, is probably from 1,000 to 1,500, of whom some 500 live in Mohammerah. 4. It is therefore necessary to be circumspect when offering encouragement or countenance in this locality to Bahreinis applying for British protection and good offices, and I think the present arrangement is quite as wide in its scope as is at present desirable in our own interests here. The arrangement which has been come to is an informal one between the sheikh and this consulate, involving a far fuller recognition of our rights in regard to Bahrein than has yet been conceded by the Persian Government, who would doubtless object strongly were they to hear of the arrangement. I am therefore keeping the existence of this agreement confidential, as far as possible. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A., His Britannic Majesty s Acting Consul for Arabistan.

WITH reference to the discussions of the subject which have taken place between us during the last few days on the subject of the title of Bahreinis to British protection while within your boundaries, I have the honour to confirm that it is agreed in a friendly compromise as between your Excellency and this consulate, with the con currence of Colonel Cox, as follows : — Bahreinis who have taken up their residence in Mohammerah since your accession shall be registered by His Majesty’s consul upon application by them, after verification in each case in concert with you. Should the statements of the persons themselves and of your representatives be at variance as to whether they are entitled to registration, and the title should appear to be in doubt, an enquiry will be held and the point will be decided according to thetestimony of witnesses. The children of such persons shall be entitled to registration m the same way. This arrangement with your Excellency is agreed by this consulate on the clear understanding that all Bahreinis entering or residing in your limits, whether entitled to registration or not, shall be treated with consideration, and not be subject to annoyances by your subordinates. Should this unfortunately happen it will become impossible to adhere to this agreement, and it will become necessary to seek a solution of the question on other lines. A. T.

As Viscount Morley is aware, the three men have been released unconditionally, and Sir G.

Such a step would, constitute a violation of the status quo which it is the policy of His Majesty's Government to maintain and the infringement of which by the Vali of Basra formed the ground of their complaint against that official. Moreover, the fact that the Bahreinis have been released unconditionally is in reality a recognition by the Turkish Government of the right of His Majesty's Government to protect the subjects of Bahrein a recognition which will be strengthened should the Turkish Government agree to pay the compensation demanded and to issue the desired instructions to the Vali of Basra. Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive Lord Morley's observations upon Sir G. Lowther's despatchVV7 7 [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governmpnt i (No. 241. Confidential.) Sir, Constantinople, April 11, 1911. I HAVE the honour to enclose copy of the note which, as instructed by your telegram No. 91 of the 7th April, I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, demanding the unconditional release of the three Bahreinese in question and the acceptance of their Bahrein passports. As reported in my telegram No. 86 of the 9th April, two of the Bahreinese had already been released, while the third has now r also been discharged. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was apparently somewhat embarrassed at the possibility of being obliged to solve the question of principle as to the status of Bahrein raised by the Yali of Bussorah in his official letter to His Majesty’s Consul, and seemed anxious to evade it by arranging to have the Bahreinese released without trial, as, if tried, we could have insisted on the presence of the British Dragoman, whereas, in the absence of a trial, it may be difficult to induce the Ottoman Government to admit in writing our special position in Bahrein, and, as set forth in my telegram No. 66 of the 25th March, the settlement of that question will probably be more difficult after we have parted with the leverage supplied by the present negotiations concerning the 4 per cent, customs increase. As the correspondence shows, the Turkish Government has never advanced positive arguments to sustain its claims to Bahrein, and in its note verbale No. 34 of the 4th April, 1893, merely endeavoured to read into communications from His Majesty’s Government admissions that the British claim is non-existent. The nature of the Turkish claim is apparent from the language of A’ali Pasha quoted in the Foreign Office despatch No. 40 of the 12th February, 1851, to Sir Stratford Canning, where it is stated that “ A’ali Pasha said that the Maritime Chiefs in the Persian Gulf were formerly officers of, and paid tribute to the Sublime Porte, and if, as was reported, the Governor of Bussorah had taken any steps to negotiate with those chiefs for their return to allegiance to the Sultan, the Porte could neither disapprove nor disavow his conduct in that respect.” This language would apply equally to the chiefs of the Trucial Coast and even Muscat, if not indeed to Gwadur, and the original “ allegiance” spoken of by A’ali Pasha probably refers to the fact that in 1530 or thereabouts the Egyptian, i.e., Turkish Admiral, Piri Pasha, took Aden and sailed to Gwadur, Oman and up the Gulf, pro claiming the Ottoman Caliphate and inducing the various Moslem chieftains to acknow ledge the supremacy of Solyman the Magnificent. At that time doubtless no distinction was made in those regions between the spiritual and temporal character of the Ottoman Sultan and Caliph and Turkish temporal power was certainly in abeyance in the Persian Gulf from then up to 1870-71 when Nejd (El Hassa) and El Bida’a were reoccupied. The present Young Turkey Government can scarcely officially advance purely Islamic claims while any other claim would be of equal value with that of His Majesty’s Government to South-West Africa outside Walfinch Bay or to King Bell’s Town in the Cameroons at the time of the Berlin Act of 1885. / It may then be advisable to insist on a written answer to our note of the 8th April, in which His Majesty’s Embassy’s note verbale of the 11th November, 1892, is referred to. In the latter the Porte was informed that Bahrein was “ under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen.” If the Turks have been so tenacious of their claim in the past when their position in the Gulf was very weak, it is to be expected that when they grow strong there by land and sea, we shall be confronted by a more vigorous assertion of their pretensions. It would thus seem essential that the present opportunity afforded by the incident gratuitously raised by the Turks of definitely defining our position in the matter vis-a-vis Turkey should not be let slip, and it may even be expedient to give our status at Bahrein a more definite international character. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [April 18.] » CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [14126] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 18.) I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.m M. le Ministre Constantinople, April 8, 1911 I HAVE recently had the honour to make verbal representations to your Excellency regarding the recent action of the Yah of Bussorah m arresting three natives According to the information which has reached me on the subject, the facts are the following:— Three natives of Bahrein were arrested on the 19th March by order of the vali for havino- refused to take out Ottoman passports. His Majesty’s consul sent to ascertain the reason for their arrest, but was met with a refusal, and m reply to a further communication from His Majesty’s consul to the effect that the passports of the individuals in question which were deposited at the consulate were m order, and requesting information as to the charges against them his Excellency the vali informed him officially and in writing that the Ottoman Government did not admit the right of His Majesty’s consul to afford protection to the natives of Bahrein. After being kept under detention for several days administratively and without any iudicial proceedings being taken against them, it would appear that, on orders from the vali, they were accused of “disturbing the peace” by having applied to Bahrein for papers of protection. The baselessness of this charge is obvious from the fact that the men’s passports were deposited at the consulate as His Majesty s consul had already informed the vali. # . . . ... Subsequently, warrants of arrest were issued by the juge d instruction describing these inhabitants of Bahrein as “ Ottoman subjects. On the 28th March I informed your Excellency of the above facts which constituted a flagrant violation of the status quo in the matter, and on instructions from my Government requested that orders be sent to the vali to release the three natives of Bahrein and to accept their Bahrein passports. _ Your Excellency paused me to be informed that instructions were sent to the vah on the 2nd instant to release the persons in question on bail. His Majesty’s consul, on enquiring whether these instructions had been received, was informed by the vah that, as the matter was a judicial one, he could not act on the instructions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the matter, and that it was for the Ministry of Justice to send him instructions to admit the attendance of a British dragoman at the trial. It is unnecessary for me to remind your Excellency of the previous correspondence on the question of Bahrein, including the communication made to the Sublime Porte in 1851 by Sir Stratford Canning, then Her Majesty’s ambassador, on instructions from Lord Palmerston, the notes verbales of Her Majesty’s Embassy No. 81 of the 11th November, 1892, and No. 55 of the 9th May, 1893, in which the relations between Her Majesty’s Government and Bahrein are clearly stated. Your Excellency cannot, I am convinced, approve of the attitude and language of the Ottoman Governor-General of Bussorah against which His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs directs me to protest in the strongest manner, and for which your Excellency will no doubt think fit to have him reprimanded for action which is not of a nature to facilitate the negotiations now in progress concerning questions interesting the two Governments in those regions. I have consequently, in accordance with my instructions, to request that the three natives of Bahrein in question be released unconditionally and without any further delay, and that their Bahrein passports be accepted as heretofore.

The men were accordingly accused of applying by letter to Bahrein for papers of protection. This is certainly not an indictable offence and, in any case, it would have been unnecessary for them to do so, as their Bahrein passports are with me. They deny having sent the letter but the Police persist in the charge, and -■ney were brought before the Mustantiq on the police report maae Excellency The Bight Honourable Sir G. A.

I have tlie honour to forward, for the information of the Government of No. 75-2891, dated the 30 th October 1910 . » “Py of the marginally noted letter which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, regarding an arrangement arrived at between His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, and His Excellency Sir Khazal Khan, Shaikh of Mohammerah, for the treatment of Bahrainis in the latter’s jurisdiction. No. 75 - 2891 , dated Bushire, the 30 th October 1910 . From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Excellency Sir George Barclay, K.C.M.G., C.Y.O.,» His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence on the subject of Bahrainis dwelling or sojourning in Persia, ending with your Despatch No. 116, dated June 4th, 1909, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State. The greater measure of security and prosperity existing in Mohammerah compared to other Persian Ports of late years is attracting a gradually increasing number of emigrants from Bahrain, and since the location in those Islands of a Political Agent on behalf of the Government of India (1904) these imigrants have been in the habit of arming themselves with a passport from the Shaikh of Bahrain, countersigned by the Political Agent, and then, on arrival at Mohammerah, demand to be registered at the British Consulate and brought under protection. This development naturally has attracted the attention of the numerous ' other families of Bahrain origin in Mohammerah who have lived there all their lives, if not for a generation or two, and who came there at a time when there was no question of their having British protection, and became enrolled in the lists of the Shaikh’s tribal dependents like other subjects of his. Individuals of this class have of late been importuning the Consulate for registration, and when I recently visited Mohammerah, the matter was at a stage which did not admit of its being fenced with or put on one side. At the same time, I was aware that the juncture was a mostlconvenient one for asking Your Excellency to revive the issue with the Central Government. The subject was therefore discussed frankly with the Shaikh, and the solution arrived at my present enclosures explain. It was designedly given a personal and local aspect in order that His \ Majesty’s Legation might not necessarily he committed thereby, if it was not \ approved. On the other hand, it is hoped that it will provide a workable modus vivendi for Mohammerah, and in any case, places us in a better position in regard to Bahrainis than we have been able to achieve in other Persian ports, where we do not register Bahrainis and where opposition is invariably offered to the exercise of our good offices in their behalf. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Government of India. No. 1165 , dated Mohammerah, the 21 st October 1910 . p r0 m— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, His Majesty's Acting Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter which, after consultation with you, I addressed yesterday to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan^ on the subject of the title of Bahrainis to protection whilst within his boundaries.2. I have further come to a private arrangement with Agha ’Abdi, Deputy Governor of Mohammerah, whereby he undertakes to refer to me informally all cases concerning Bahrainis, whether registered or not, before taking forcible action, on the understanding that I do not interfere with his legitimate rights in the last resort, to imprison recalcitrant debtors and malefactors, after I have satisfied myself by enquiry of the guilt of the accused persons. It is too soon to predict how this arrangement will work in practice, but I am not without hopes that it may gradually ripen into a full recognition of the position we occupy in regard to the people of Bahrain. 3. I estimate the number of persons entitled, under the new arrangement, to registration at about 100, out of which about 60 may be expected to avail themselves of the privilege. The number of Bahrainis in Arabistan legally entitled to our protection, i.e.\ born in Bahrain, or of parents born in Bahrain, is probably from 1,000 to 1,500, of whom some 500 live in Mohammerah. 4. It is, therefore, necessary to be circumspect when offering encourage ment or countenance in this locality to Bahrainis applying for British protec tion and good offices, and I think the present arrangement is quite as wide in its scope as is at present desirable in our own interests here. The arrangement which has been come to is an informal one between the Shaikh and this Consulate, involving a far fuller recognition of our rights in regard to Bahrain than has yet been conceded by the Persian Government, who would doubtless object strongly were they to hear of the arrangement. I am, therefore, keeping the existence of this agreement confidential, as far as possible. Dated Mohammerah, the 20th October 1910 . From— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, His Majesty's Consul for Arabistan, To— His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, K.C.I.E., Shaikh of Mohammerah. After compliments— With reference to the discussions of the subject which have taken place between us during the last few days on the subject of the title of Bahrainis to British protection while within your boundaries, I have the honour to confirm that it is agreed in a friendly compromise as between Your Excellency and this Consulate with the concurrence of Colonel Cox as follows Bahrainis who have taken up their residence in Mohammerah since your accession shall be registered by His Majesty’s Consul upon application by them, alter verification in each, case in concert with you. Should the statements of the persons themselves and of your representatives be at variance as to whether they are entitled to registration and the title should appear to be m doubt, an enquiry will be held and the point will be decided according to the testimony of witnesses. The children of such persons shall be entitled to registration in the same way. ° This arrangement with Your Excellency is agreed by this Consulate on i Jr ear understanding that all Bahrainis entering or residing in your limits whether entitled to registration or not, shall be treated with consideration and not be subjected to annoyances by your subordinates.

Sir Wlt/.i x efareuce to rny despatch No. 539, of September 2nd 1908, on the subject of the status of the Bahrein- ese at Basra, I ’nave the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from Mr. Crow ' reporting that the question of British protection over Bahrein has again come up between him and the Vali, who, ; » ’ 19 while inclined to deny that the British Government have any rights of supremacy there admitted that he had been ; f| instructed not to protest against 'but at the same time not accept any assertion regarding the status of Bahrein.

Sir:- In November last, at the request of the British Resident at Bushlre, I Informed the Vail that the es tate, amounting to less than 200 rupees, of a certain Hajl All bin Haji Mehdl, Ottoman subject of Bagdad, who had died at Bahrein, had been transmitted to the British Consul General at Bagdad for payment to the deceased's brother. The Vilavet of Basra had previ ously written to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the subject and the Vail's letter had been handed by the Sheikh to the British Political Agent at Bahrein for the u« necessary action. The British Resident at Bushire desired me to point out to the Vail that it would save inconvenience if, in future, similar communications were addressed direct by the Vilayet to the British Political Agent at Bahrein, that island being under British protection. c - M - Marling, Esq., C.M.G. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.I informed the Vali accordingly. His Excellency seems to have been perturbed at ray statement that Bahrein was under British protection and telegraphed to the minister of the Interior or of Foreign Affairs, ask ing him whether he should not rebut any such contention on the part of the British Government. In conversation with the Vali to-day His Excellency told me he had been instructed not to protest against but at the same time not to accept ray assertion regard ing the status of Bahrein and he emphatically stated that he could not admit that the British Government had any rights of supremacy over Bahrein. I told His Excellency that both the Turkish and Persian claims to sovereignty over Bahrein had been frequently rebutted by His Majesty’s Government for more than one hundred years and that I was instructed by the Enbassy to extend British projection to natives of Bahrein at Basra. I instanced the case of Khalil bln Ibrahim here, who was taken by the Basra Authorities for military service in 1908, and on whose behalf the Enbassy had made representations which had resulted in ordersorders being sent to the Vail's predecessor not to interfere with him. As questions regarding the protection of Bahrein- ese are not of unfrequent occurrence in this district, I miguu, if you see no objection, communicate either officially or unofficially to the Vail the substance of the Ambassador’s despatch of September 2nd, 1908, to Vir. Geary which would serve to show him that the inter vention of British Consuls in Turkey on behalf of natives of the island is well established. Before adopting this course however I should be glad to re ceive your instructions as it seems inadvisable to raise these questions unless there are matters at stake which make it worth while. / I have, , (Signed) F.E.

As you will remember Ala-es-Sul- taneh made the proposed substitution conditional on the Grand Vizier's concurrence. The matter was submitted to the Grand Vizier in Coun cil at Bagh-i-Shah on the 14th instant when His Highness pronounced against the proposed amended note in the strong est terms, declaring that Mushir-ed-Dowleh's note was an admirable one and that to change it would be giving away the Persian case. British activity in Bahrein, and British pretensions in regard to that island could not be allowed. The Sir Edward Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.The influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs,is, I fear, not strong enough to modify the refractory attitude c£ the Grand Vizier and I therefore do not propose to press further for the amended note.

In the circumstances the wisest course seems to be to return Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s objectional communication.

ASIATIC TURKEY. [May II.] CONEIUEN TIAL. Section 3. [15998] No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received May II.) (No. 101.) Sir, Tehran, April 24, 1908. I HAVE the honour to report that, in accordance with the instructions con tained in your telegram No. 67 of the 26th ultimo on the subject of the protection of Bahreinese in Persia, I addressed the ncte of which a copy is inclosed herewith to the Minister for Eoreign Affairs, and, in presenting it to his Excellency, said that I hoped the Persian Government would view the matter in a reasonable light, and refrain from again putting forward claims to the sovereignty of Bahrein based on no better grounds than the Treaty of 1822, which bad not only never been ratified, but bad also been repudiated by both the Persian and British Governments. His Majesty’s Government, I felt sure, were very much in earnest about the matter, and would not listen to frivolous arguments any longer. Mushir-ed-Dowleh promised to give the question his best attention, and to do all he could to bring about a settlement. I was therefore considerably surprised when I received his note of the 9th instant, copy inclosed, in which, after stating that the Persian Government, out of its constant regard for the peace of “ its ” subjects, had sent strong orders to the local authorities to make reparation, and do the man justice if he had been illegally treated. His Excellency reaffirms that Bahrein is a possession of Persia. Mushir-ed-Howleh’s note reached me on the same day as the telegram No. 76 of the 10th April, in which you were so good as to ask what measures I could suggest to enforce the Persian Government’s compliance with our demands, and, as I had occasion to see his Excellency that afternoon, I took the opportunity to explain to him the disappointment I felt at his written reply, and to warn him that, from the nature of the telegram that I had just received, it was evident that His Majesty’s Government intended to have the question satisfactorily and definitively settled. I pointed out to his Excellency that for more than 100 years we had had Treaty relations with Bahrein, which was strong proof at least that Bahrein was not dependent on Persia, that for at least the same period of time Persia had never made the smallest effort to assert her pretended rights, and that by our Treaty of 3 880 the Chief of Bahrein had placed his foreign relations in our hands, and that finally, within the last few years, Persian subjects who had got into trouble in the island had received protection from us. It seemed to me that the Persian Government would be singularly unwise if, by insisting on a shadowy right, they ran the risk of unnecessarily offending a friendly and powerful neighbour, on whom they were now depending for the settlement of a serious frontier question, and whose assistance in financial matters they might be driven to seek at an early date. Persia would be well-advised to yield on a point which was not of the smallest real importance to her, and it appeared to me that the simplest way out of the difficulty would be for him to address me another note, stating merely that he had given the necessary orders to the local authorities in the Gulf, and wherever else Bahreinese are likely to be found, that the representations of our Consular officers on behalf of Bahreinese are to be accepted without reserve. His Excellency said he would send me another reply to my note of the 30th March, though he would not say of what character it would be, as he must first consult his colleagues, and must also look up the history of the case. I think that Mushir-ed- Dowleh perfectly well understands that the Persian claim to Bahrein is worthless, but both he and his colleagues are too much afraid of the criticisms of the Medjliss to give way on their own responsibility, and shrink from the task of explaining the situation to them frankly. . ^ i, i , On the 20th instant I received a visit from ]Sizam-es-8ultaneli, and, altei affairs for the last fifty years, told me a long, rambling story of how, in the year a h. 1275 (a.d. 1858), two emissaries had come to Persia from Bahrein with on offer to pay tribute in return for the privilege of a Persian Resident in the islands, and how [2961 Z—3]the idea eventually ended in fiasco. (The nature of the circumstances in which this appeal to Persia was made is outlined in Whigham s « Persian Problem, pp. 33-34.) The Prime Minister, indeed, showed clearly that he only told the story to indicate how absurd in his eves the Persian claims were, and suggested that if I encountered further resistance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs I should ask his Excellency what he would do if a Persian subject got into difficulties in Bahrein; surely then he would have to ask for British assistance. T 1 • .lt ■ I mentioned this conversation to Mushir-ed-Powleh when 1 saw him on the 21st instant and his Excellency replied that, whatever Nizam-&lt;?s-Sultaneh may have said to me, he had talked in quite a different strain at the Council of Ministers, when he had strongly upheld the Persian claim, and when 1 rejoined that Mr. Chuichill had been present at the interview the Minister exclaimed : “ u’est bien ; Nizam-es- Sultaneh, on ne pent jamais croire a ce qu’il dit! . . x Mushir-ed-Dowleh said he was still preparing his reply, to which 1 rejoined that I thought he would he wasting his time, as no citing of isolated incidents such as that related^by Nizam-es-Sultaneh could possibly weigh against a series of recorded Treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the Chiefs of Bahrein. As regards the measures to be taken to enforce compliance uith oui wishes, 1 ventured to suggest the occupation of Hormuz or Ivais primarily on the giound that it is in the interests of our prestige with the protected Chiefs in the Gulf that we are now demanding the recognition of our right to protect Bahreinese fiom the Peisiau Government, and that local action, if necessary, appears to me best calculated to produce this effect, Hormuz Island appears to me to be preferable to any other, as being so close to Bunder Abbas that the maiy Bahreinese who frequent that port must carry the news of our energetic action on their behalf to theii own countiy, and for the same reason the maximum impression would be produced on the local autho rities. It is also possible that a proof of our readiness to protect our friends may induce Muin-et-Tujjar to see the wisdom of coming to terms with Messrs. Ellinger. Failing Hormuz, I suggested Kais Island as there has recently been a disagree able incident there for which I have not yet obtained more than a formal apology, when shots were fired on a boat conveying the assistant of the Agency of Eingah, who w 7 as proceeding to the island to investigate the grievances of some British Indians resident there. I have little doubt but that a formal threat to employ force will induce the Persian Government to give w r ay. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure 1 in No. 1.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 126 of the 21st May last, I have the^honour to report that the question of the protection of Bahreinis in Persia has again been raised by a robbery committed near Yezd on a party of twenty-one Bahreini pilgrims returning from Meshed. I have informed the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs of the occurrence, and requested him to cause the necessary steps to be taken for the punishment of the robbers and the recovery of the money stolen, which amounted to 5,255 krans. Meantime also, as it appeared to me to be impossible for us to allow the victims, who look to us for protection, to remain at the Vice-Consulate at Yezd in a destitute condition, I sent instructions to Mr. Blackman, through His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan, to furnish them with a sum sufficient to enable them to reach the nearest British Consulate on their way to their homes, which will, I presume, be Shiraz. The money so advanced will be recoverable from the Persian Government, but meantime I propose to request the Indian Government to allow it to be charged in the Legation accounts. I am taking this opportunity to urge again the Persian Government to send instructions to the local Imperial authorities to accept the representations of His Majesty’s Consular Representatives on behalf of the Bahreinis in Persia.

I HAVE the honour to report to your Excellency that certain subjects of the Chief of Bahrein have asked to be registered at this Consulate. They are in possession of passports from their Chief and also a document signed by Major Prideaux, Political Agent at Bahrein, recommending them to the good offices of British Consular officials. The Ottoman Government attempted to enforce military service in the Turkish army on one of these men, and this incident was the cause of an appeal for protection at this Consulate. As they would appear to have no shadow of a claim to British nationality, I naturally refused their demand, but I would request instructions as to what degree of official or semi-official protection, if any, should be afforded to such claimants. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) ARTHUR B. GEARY. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Acting Consul Geary. Therapia, September 2, 1908. I HAVE received your despatch No. 54 of the 8th ultimo respecting the protection of Bahreinese. You are in error in believing that they have no claim to British nationality. . Since the beginning of the last century His Majesty’s Government have on nine occasions repudiated Persian claims to sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein, and on nineteen occasions the claims of Turkey, while in 1871 the Grand Vizier gave a formal assurance “ that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein.” In October 1893 a question arose regarding the forced enlistment of natives or Bahrein into the Turkish army. A note was accordingly addressed to the Turkish Ambassador on the 14th April, 1894, which, after drawing his Excellency’s attention to previous communications, distinctly stated that His Majesty’s Government did not admit the claim of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Turkish Empire, and that, if natives of the island applied to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons. A question of British protection over Bahreinese in Turkey arose in 1892 over the restitutio.) of taxes levied at Bussorah, and His Majesty’s Ambassador reminded the Porte that, Bahrein being under British protection, His Majesty’s Government could not admit Turkish interference with the natives of the island. The question of British protection of Bahreinese in the Ottoman dominions again arose in 1893, and His Majesty’s Government maintained the right of British Consular [1928 g —5]Representatives to give their good offices to Bahreinese applying for them, and the Porte was subsequently informed that His Majesty’s Government would extend their protection to them whenever there was occasion. The intervention of British Consuls in Turkey on behalf of Bahreinese was again insisted upon in 1896. You should therefore extend protection to the natives of Bahrein in conformity with these precedents. * I am, &amp;c.

After Compliments. I beg to state that we arrived Lingah on the 28th Moharram 1326 (corresponding to 2nd March March 1908) and intended landing some cargo of dates v/hen all of a sudden a storm set in. I, the Nakhoda, was then asliore at Lingah and my boom contained the crew and the rudder-man. Owing to the severity of the storm the ropes in the boat were broken off and the boom sailed to get in a safe harbour at Duv/wan. On the arrival of the boat there a man came forward who purchased 92 qallas of Khanaizi dates and 5 tins of date juice. The said quantity of dates and date juice was landed at Duwan on Sunday the 5th Safar 1326 (8th March 1908) at 4 o'clock (Arabic time) in the day. Thereon the Cus toms man of Duwwan came up and demanded Custom duty, Rs.9, which sum was paid to him in the presence of Shaikh Khalfan, Chief of Duwwan, and in the presence ofof a number of other people. On the 6th Safar (9th torch 1908) the boat Bailed for Mughu and arrived there the same day. The Inspector of Customs called on the crew of the boat in the house of the Mudlr of revenue of Mughu, in the presence of Shaikh Ahmad hin Reshid al I'arzuqi and of All and Ihrahim bin Sultan, and in the presence of a number of other townspeople. He enquired of the crew what quantity of dates they had landed at Duwwan. They replied that they had landed at Duwwan 92 qallahs of dates and 5 tins of date juice and that they had paid the Customs duty as much as was demanded of them by the Customs man at Duwwan, viz: Rs.9/-. He thereupon told them that the duty would be more than what they had paid. Then he made calculations and said that they should pay Rs.il/- more, and that they should return to Duwwan and pay the money there. In obedience to the order of the Inspector of Customs the rudder-man himself returned to Duwwan to pay the money to the Customs man there. The latter v/as not found there, and the rudder- man remained there one day and one night waiting for him. But seeing that the Customs man was not there and findingfinding that he could not he delayed there more, he paid Rs.il/- to the Chief of Duwwan, Shaikh Khalfan, and got from him a letter on this particular for Shaikh Ahmad, Chief of Mughu. On Wednesday the 8th of the current month (corresponding to 11th torch) at 11.30 (Arabic time or half an hour before sunset) the gunboat (? perhaps a launch) '’Qilan’' approached fc- the boom at Mughu harbour and struck her against it and broke 4 pieces- of wood of the front side. The Coramander of the Gunboat (?) ordered the lascar to board the boom and take out all the ropes without re ferring anything about it to him. They were asked why they should do this and the Commander replied to the crew of the boom that they v/ere not to be listen ed to. Thus they took off all the ropes, tied the boom to the gunboat (?) and towed it out to Lingali. Here the boom is still with the Customs people and is kept manned by 2 armed soldiers. I beg (further) to inform you that the boom is the property of Ahmad bin Jasim bin Jodar, a Bahrein subject, and the dates and date juice are my property whichwhich still are 400 qallahs and 30 tina of date juice. Besides there is in the boom 100 qallahs of dates, sent by All bin Ibrahim az Zaiyani to the care of Hasan bu Sarniya.

After compliments. I oeg to say that I own a doom which sailed from Bahrein laden with cargo of dates and date juice, for Lingah with Ali din Addalla din Qatami as her Nakhoda. The Director of Customs, Lingah, treated the doat and the crew in a manner which is against the code of justice. It therefore became necessary to bring the matter to your notice as we are your subjects. En closed with this you will find a copy of the petition which the said Nakhoda, Ali din Qatam submitted to Aga Badr din Muhammad Amin, Residency Agent, Lingah. It contains details of the affair which G-od willing you will read and I deg of you to consider our case and to relieve us from this aggression which the Director of Customs, Lingah, meted out to us illegally. I shall wait for your action.Copy of a letter No. 1522, dated the 3rd May 1908, fiorn Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant Resi dent, to Monsieur A, Constant, Provincial Director of Customs. We have received reports fron Bahrein and Lingah regarding the seizure by the Director of Customs Lin gah of a Bahrein Boat and cargo belonging to Bahrein subjects, viz: Ahmed bin Kasim bin Jodar, All bin Abdulla Katani and others. It appears that Monsieur Warrin contends that the Nakhoda of the boat holds no jowaz from the ports where he sold dates etc., and sold them at ports where there were no Customs Bureaux, and that he, the Nakhoda, had participated with the Customs employees i in an. act of smuggling. Monsieur Warrin, further does not admit the evidence of the Nakhoda's witnes ses as to the payment of Customs duty to the Customs Mudir at Charek. The Nakhoda on the other hand pleads:- ignor ance of necessity for taking out jowaz, that the Cus toms tofangchis should have prevented him from land inglanding and selling the goods ii it was not allowed and that on the contrary they v/ere. present at the landing and that Customs duty was recovered from him hy the Kedkhuda. He adds that if he had intended to smuggle he would not have landed the goods in the day time in the presence of Customs officials. No proces verbal has been received in this Resi dency and apart from the above, I am not aware of the precise grounds on which your representative has been acting, but if it is agreed that the facts are mainly as stated as I understand them to be, the confiscation of the boat and contents valued at over 600 tomans seems a very heavy visitation, and I hope you will kindly see your way to reconsider the case, especially as it would seem that some of your own employees v/ere identified with the Nakhoda*s action. I should have communicated with you earlier but was awaiting further information from Lingah. I do not suggest that the Nakhoda should go scot free and if you could impose a light fine, say of Kranskrans 500, I would readily support It, as I quite agree that there has been at any rate a technical violation of Customs regulations. I may add that Major Cox had written to you on the above lines on the 23rd of April, but did not send you the letter as he received another report from Lingah saying that a further enquiry was being made. I have, however, now heard that the evidence of the witnesses produced by the Nakhoda has not been accepted and that the boat Is to be sold very shortly. I trust at any rate that the sale of the boat may be delayed until the matter has been thoroughly thrashedCopy of a letter No. 1526, dated 19th May 1908, from Captain A. P.

Referring to your letter of 14th May 1908, No. 861/ I have to inform you that I have now received a report from Lingah that the boom belonging to Ahmed tin Kasim bin Jodar, All bin Abdulla Katani and others of Bahrein, was sold on the 12th with all on board for Rs.1600/- to Mr. Brown of the firm of Messrs Robert Wonckhaus and Company. In view of my letter of the 3rd instant, I am very surprised to hear this, and I beg you will be so good as to cancel the sale pending further en quiry into the matter.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governroentj ASIATIC TURKEY.

W ITH reference to my despatch No. 101 of the 24th April on the question of the recognition by the Persian Government of our right to afford protection to suhiects of ■Bahrein m this country, I have the honour to report that I have constantly urged the Minister lor Foreign Affairs to send me an amended note in place of that which he addressed to me on the 9th April. His Excellency, however, pleads for more time to examine the matter from the historical point of view, and in consequence of the recurrent Ministerial crises of the past month he has not been able to prepare his case. The general tone of his conversation, however, has not led me hitherto to expect that the new note, when it does reach me, will be satisfactory; it is more likely that it will be an attempt to justify Persian claims over the islands, based chiefly on the repudiated Treaty of 1822. When I saw him on the 18th instant, I again brought the question up, and said that I believed His Majesty’s Government would be perfectly satisfied with a note simply stating that general instructions had been given to the local Persian authorities to accept the representations of the British Consular officers on behalf of Bahreinis, and I elicited the tacit admission from his Excellency that his researches in the archives of the Foreign Office had been practically fruitless, and that he had been able to find no trace of any ratification of the abortive Treaty of 1822. His Excellency at last admitted that his disinclination to comply with our demand arose really from fear of what might be said of him in the Assembly, whose patriotic susceptibilities would be outraged. I told his Excellency that I thought he would have a perfectly good reply to any such criticisms by quoting the case of the Persians who found themselves in difficulties in Bahrein in November 1904, when the Persian Government had been forced to apply to us for assistance. His Excellency pretended to acquiesce, but I am convinced that without some material pressure, or at least the threat of it, which I understand from your telegram No. TOO of the 16th May His Majesty’s Government is not at present disposed to employ, the Minister will contrive to avoid giving a satisfactory answer.^ It is unfortunate that circumstances should make it necessary for His Majesty’s Government to adopt this attitude, for I think that, were I authorized to inform Mushir-ed-Dowleh unofficially that His Majesty’s Government had decided to enforce compliance by material measures, it is more than likely that his Excellency would find means to comply with our demands and to conceal the fact of his compliance! from the Parliament.

[ 0 $ I HAVE the honour to report that, in accordance with the instructions con- 1 tained in your telegram No. 67 of the 26th ultimo on the subject of the protection of Bahreinese in Persia, I addressed the note of which a copy is inclosed herewith to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and, in presenting it to his Excellency, said that I hoped the Persian Government would view the matter in a reasonable light, and refrain from again putting forward claims to the sovereignty of Bahrein based on no better grounds than the Treaty of 1822, which had not only never been ratified, hut had also been repudiated by both the Persian and British Governments. His Majesty’s Government, I felt sure, were very much in earnest about the matter, and would not listen to frivolous arguments any longer. Mnshir-ed-X)owleh promised to give the question his best attention, and to do all he could to bring about a settlement. I was therefore considerably surprised when I received his note of the 9 th instant, copy inclosed, in which, after stating that the Persian Government, out of its constant regard for the peace of “ its ” subjects, had sent strong orders to the local authorities to make reparation, and do the man justice if he had been illegally treated. His ✓ \ Excellency reaffirms that Bahrein is a possession of Persia. ^ Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note reached me on the same day as the telegram No. 76 of the 10th April, in which you were so good as to ask what measures I could suggest to enforce the Persian Government’s compliance with our demands, and, as I had occasion to see his Excellency that afternoon, I took the opportunity to explain to him the disappointment I felt at his written reply, and to warn him that, from the nature of the telegram that I had just received, it was evident that His Majesty’s Government intended to have the question satisfactorily and definitively settled. I pointed out to his Excellency that for more than 100 years w 7 e had had Treaty relations with Bahrein, which was strong prool at least that Bahrein was not dependent on Persia, that for at least the same period of time Persia had never made the smallest effort to assert her pretended rights, and that by our Treaty of ] 880 the Chief of Bahrein had placed his foreign relations in our hands, and that finally, within the last few years, Persian subjects who had got into trouble in the island had received protection from us. It seemed to me that the Persian Government would he singularly unwise if, by insisting on a shadowy right, they ran the risk of unnecessarily offending a friendly and powerful neighbour, on whom they were now depending for the settlement of a serious frontier question, and whose assistance in financial matters they might be driven to seek at an early date. Persia would be well-advised to yield on a point which was not of the smallest real importance to her, and it appeared to me that the simplest way out of the difficulty would be for him to address me another note, stating merely that he had given the necessary orders to the local authorities in the Gulf, and wherever else Bahreinese are likely to be found, that the representations of our Consular officers on behalf of Bahreinese are to he accepted without reserve. His Excellency said he would send me another reply to my note of the 30th March, though he would not say of what character it would be, as he must first consult his colleagues, and must also look up the history of the case. I think that Mushir-ed- Dowleh perfectly well understands that the Persian claim to Bahrein is worthless, hut both he and his colleagues are too much afraid of the criticisms of the Medjliss to give way on their own responsibility, and shrink from the task of explaining the situation to them frankly. On the 20 th instant I received a visit from Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and, after explaining the situation to him, expressed the hope that he would use his influence over his colleagues to bring the question to a satisfactory solution. His Excellencv, who, from his long connection with Bushire, has a wonderful knowledge of Gulf affairs for the last fifty years, told me a long, rambling story of how, in the year a.h. 1275 (a.d. 1858), two emissaries had come to Persia from Bahrein with an offer to pay tribute in return for the privilege of a Persian Resident in the islands, and how [2961 Z—3]the idea eventually ended in fiasco. (The nature of the circumstances in which this appeal to Persia was made is outlined in Whigham’s “ Persian Problem,” pp. 32-34.) The Prime Minister, indeed, showed clearly that he only told the story to indicate how absurd in his eyes the Persian claims were, and suggested that if I encountered further resistance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs I should ask his Excellency what he would do if a Persian subject got into difficulties in Bahrein; surely then he would have to ask for British assistance. I mentioned this conversation to Mushir-ed-Dowleh when I saw him on the 21st instant, and his Excellency replied that, whatever Nizam-es-Sultaneh may have said to me, he had talked in quite a different strain at the Council of Ministers, when he had strongly upheld the Persian claim, and when I rejoined that Mr. Churchill had been present at the interview the Minister exclaimed : “ Qa, c’est bien ; Nizam-es- Sultaneh, on ne pent jamais croire a ce qu’il dit!” Mushir-ed-Dowleh said he was still preparing his reply, to which I rejoined that '1 thought he would be wasting his time, as no citing of isolated incidents such as that related by Nizam-es-Sultaneh could possibly weigh against a series of recorded Treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the Chiefs of Bahrein. As regards the measures to be taken to enforce compliance with our wishes, I ventured to suggest the occupation of Hormuz or Kais primarily on the ground that it is in the interests of our prestige with the protected Chiefs in the Gulf that we are now demanding the recognition of our right to protect Bahreinese from the Persian Government, and that local action, if necessary, appears to me best calculated to produce this effect. Hormuz Island appears to me to bo preferable to any other, as being so close to Bunder Abbas that the ma iv Bahreinese who frequent that port must carry the news of our energetic action on their behalf to their own country, and for the same reason the maximum impression would be produced on the local autho rities. It is also possible that a proof of our readiness to protect our friends may induce Muin-et-Tujjar to see the wisdom of coming to terms with Messrs. Ellinger. Failing Hormuz, I suggested Kais Island as there has recently been a disagree able incident there for which I have not yet obtained more than a formal apology, when shots were fired on a boat conveying the assistant of the Agency of Lingah, who was proceeding to the island to investigate the grievances of some British Indians resident there. I have little doubt but that a formal threat to employ force will induce the Persian Government to give way. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHAELES M. MAPPING. Inclosure 1 in No. 1 .

I have to remind your Excellency that by a note dated 19th February, 1906, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, acting under the instructions of his Government, informed the Imperial Persian Government that His Britannic Majesty’s Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and I have now received further instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to draw your Excellency’s attention to this case, and to protest against the arbitrary action of the Governor of Lingah in punishing a British- protected subject of Bahrein and in refusing to admit the good offices of the British Eesident.

With regard to the protection of Bahreinis, Mr. Secretary Morley will observe that His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire is strongly of opinion that, until the Persian Government are obliged by some public act of compulsion to recede from the position which they have adopted, cases similar to that at present under consideration The Under Secretary of State, India Office, Q , • U&gt; ho Juxa/ Pj&amp;g.consideration are likely to recur with increasing frequency, a view which is supported by Mr. Marling. I am to state that, for several reasons, it ap pears to Sir E. Grey to be inopportune to raise this question in its general aspect at the present moment / and that he is therefore disposed to avoid doing so un less the assertion by the Persian Government of their present pretension renders such a step inevitable. He therefore proposes, in the first instance, to instruct Mr. Marling to press the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to send to him without further delay the amended note which His Excellency promised to ad dress to him.and, if its terms are unobjectionable, to take no further action for the present. Fir E. Grey considers that it need not be in sisted that this note should recognize specifically the right of Hie Majesty s Government to protect Bah reinis but that it will be sufficient if it contains no expression which can be understood as disputing that right. 15n In view, however, of the categorical instructions reported to have been sent by the Persian Government to the local authority at Bushire not to allow Bahreinis to be treated otherwise than as Persian subjects. Sir B. Grey thinks that it would be well that Mr. Marling should be instructed to state that if any further case of this kind arises. His Majesty's Government will feel compelled to take steps to vindicate their posi tion. ir E. Grey would be glad to receive an express! of‘,Mr. Morley's views regarding these proposed in structions . With reference to the question of the protection of the subjects of the Trucial Chiefs, I am to state that Sir E. Grey is disposed to rest satisfied with the assurances given to Major Cox by the Governor at Bushire, that he will take severe notice of the conduct of the Deputy Governor of Linga in the case of the five subjects of the Sheikh of Sharga and I am to en-wmm (V enquire whether Mr. Morley concurs in this view.

Dated September 1907. The Ala-es-Sultan, a Bulwardi of Fars, who is understood to have been last employed at Enzeli, took up the post of Director ol» Mudir of Customs at Lingah on 1st July 1907. In a report dated 5th September the Residency Agent, Lingah, forwarded copies of correspondence with the Agent of the British India Steam Naviga tion Company, who complained that the Director had refused to take cogni zance of a requisition written to him on the Company’s business in accordance with previous custom, in English, and had sent for him and abused him as an unpatriotic Persian and bad Musulman for using the English language. On the Residency Agent interviewing in the British India Agent’s behalf the Director refused to accept his mediation and denied his right to intervene in his favour. In the same report it was stated that the Director had assembled the Persian merchants and tried to get them to form a standing Majlis for the trial of cases and discussion of matters of public importance. During August he treated with h arshness two dhows belonging to subjects of Trucial Arab Chiefs under British protection, namely, Abu Tbabi and Shargah ; one of them he is believed to have arrested on the high seas and towed into Lingah where he took all the cargo out of her notwithstanding that a correct jowaz was found with the owner of the cargo in Lingah.

You will observe that the Persian Government disregards the previous communi cations which I had made, and renews the claim to the sovereignty of the island on the ground that a subordinate British officer acknowledged the claim as valid in j822. I asked the Ala-es-Sultaneh how the Persian Government could renew a claim which, as I had explained, had been formally disavowed by a Shah of Persia. He said that he had forgotten what had happened about the question, but that recently some- one had come to him from the Assembly to say that the claim must be urged because the British themselves had acknowledged it in 1822. He asked me if I could communicate to him the Shah s deskat in order to show it to the Assembly, who were 'veiy insistent. I said I would send him a short historical Memorandum as to the status of Bahrein, which would no doubt satisfy his friend. The origin of this communication is, no doubt, the desire of certain persons connected with the*Assembly probably the Mouin-el-Tujjer, to get hold of pearl-fishing rights in order to sell them at a profit. The question will be borne in mind, and a further communication will be sent you. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-BICE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1 . Ala-es-Sultaneh to Sir C.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s note of the 23rd February last respecting the Island of Bahrein, and have to point out that even if the Agreement of 1822 has not, as your Excellency states, been put into execution, it does not affect the object of the Persian Government concerning the Agreement in question, since the responsible officials of the British Government at that time recognized the position of the island and the rights of Persia over it. If, in the meantime, an Agreement has been made by them, and even that Agreement may not have been put into force, the fact will have no bearing on the recognition by the British officers of the rights of the Persian Government over the Island of Bahrein. It is on account of this point that the Persian Government expects the justice of that friendly Power, who has from ancient times recognized her rights over that island, not to refrain from giving necessary assistance when the occasion arises.

[2633 c—22]MiMiianMM mem*'*' — : According to documents in the possession of His Majesty’s Government, not only the superior British authority, hut the Shah of Persia, expressly disavowed the action of their subordinate officials in 1822, and consequently according to the law and practice of civilized nations, those proceedings were null and void. Since 1822 the Turkish Government has raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Government, has been informed that Bahrein is under British protection. The Persian Government will, I have no doubt, acknowledge that my Govern ment will have some cause for surprise on learning that after the lapse of eighty-two years a claim is suddenly advanced, which has been formally and solemnly repudiated^ by the Shah of Persia, and will have some difficulty in reconciling such a claim either with a regard to the law and practice of nations, or with the desire, so frequently expressed, to maintain the cordial relations between the two Governments.

A copy of my reply to the present note is also enclosed. Sir E. Grey, Bart.,Grand Vizier to Sir C. Spring Rice. 5tli February 1907. In reply to your note of 5th January last re specting the Island of Bahrein I have the honour to state that the object of referring to the Agreement of 1822 between His late Highness the Firman Firma of Fare and Captain Bruce was not that the British Government should now say that it has been disavow ed. Besides the fact that the agreement is one which has been made between the officials of the two Gov ernments and abrogation of it is not at all known to the Persian Government who consider it binding, the object of my note was that an officially appointed British officer (all the British Officers have always been known for their experience and knowledge) has recognized the right of the Persian Government over the island in question and given evidence as to the status of the island at that time, testifying to i the rights of Persia as an eyewitness. Even if the agreement which had reference to certain measures had, as supposed by the British b'' /■ Government been abrogated^ that would not settle the matter and the Persian Government hopes, in view of the justice which is always expected from the British Government that the latter will not lose sight of the ancient rights of the Persian Government which had in different cases been recognized by her and will not refrain from acting in harmony on all oc casions. N.B. The Persian text of this note is very confused.1 f Translation r i r- Sir:C. Spring Rice to Grand Vizier 23rd February I nave one nonour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’s note of the 5th instant on the subject of the status of the island of Bahrein. I note with surprise that Your Highness states that the Persian Government know nothing of the abrogation of the agreement of 1322 between Captain Bruce and the Firman Fima of Fare and consider it binding. r— As you are of course aware no engagement be tween nations is binding until it has been formally ratified by the proper authorities. According to the information in my possession, and A/hich is doubtless also to be found in the ar chives of the Persian Foreign Office, not only was the Treaty disavowed by the proper representatives of His Britannic Majesty’s Government but Hie Ma jesty the Shah refused to recognize its stipulations andanci expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.I From To Major J.

On the 6th January 1907 the Vice-Consul at Karbala if reported that Sayad Bakar son of Sayad Alawi Sayad Jawad of Bahrein* had had some property stolen at Karbala and that he had applied for assistance to the Vice-Consul. The Vice-Consul was instructed to giT© Sayad Bakar all assistance. On the 14th January 1907 the Vice-Consul wrote that the Mutasarif of Karbala had informed him that the official interference of the British Vice-Consul on behalf of a subject of Bahrein was not Inadmissible : the TIutasarif said that the case ^ should be carefully investigated, but not according to the procedure followed in the case of foreigners. Sayad Bakar had not in his possession a Passport fromfroin Bahrein, hut this point has not heen raised hy the local authorities and Mr* Gaskin has seen Sayad Bakar, who was personally known to him when he was Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein. The stolen property is Yalued at about £ T. 260. 3. On the 21st February 1907 I wrote to H.E. the Vali stating the facts, and para 2 of my letter ran as follows 'The question of the status of subjects of Bahrein has in the past formed the subject of discussion between the British and the Turkish Governments, and the latest instructions which I have received from H.B.M’s Ambassador at Constantinople are that as the Chief of Bahrein is under the protection of the British Government it is quite in admissible that the natives of Bahrein should, when on Ottoman territory, be treated as Turkish subjects.' The letter was taken to His Excellency by my Native t Agent, who at the aame time showed His Excellency the Note Verbale No. 16 dated the 8th February 1896 sent by the British Embassy to the Porte on this subject. 4. His Excellency has now replied in his letter No. 120 dated the 13th March 1907 that according to a previous and special order from the Sublime Porte the natives of Bahreinare to “be treated as Turkish subjects, and that the theft case shall he carefully investigated.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 51 of the 27th February last, I have the f honour to transmit herewith a translation of a note from the Persian Government on the subject of the sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein claimed by His Majesty the Shah. Ihe Grand Vizier mentions in the inclosed note an Agreement made in 1822 between His Majesty s Government and the Persian Government, in which the former recognize the Island of Bahrein as a dependency of the Province of Ears. I presume his Highness refers to the Agreement made in that year by the British Resident at Bushire and disowned by His Majesty’s Government. * S As I informed tbe Persian Government, under the instructions contained in your (i fa/d telegram No. 28 of the 9th February last, that His Majesty’s Government decline to' entertain any further representations on the subject of the Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein, I have returned no reply to the Grand Vizier’s communication. There are a few outstanding claims at Bushire in which Bahreinis are interested, and I have heen for the last year trying to settle these cases amicably with the Persian Government. If it should be impossible to obtain justice for the parties concerned the details of these claims wall be brought to your notice in due course, / / , - according to your instructions (see your telegram No. 28 of the 9th February last). /wfffril I have, &amp;c. ^ (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUFF. Inclosure in No. 1. Grand Vizier to Mr. E. Grant Duff. (Translation.) ^ September 13, 1906. I HAVE received and submitted to His Imperial Majesty the Shah your undated letter [19th February last] respecting Bahrein. I have now the honour to state that, in view of the former proceedings, and also in view of the friendship existing between the two Governments, I did not expect to see the two following paragraphs in your note :— 1 . “ His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is, in their opinion, entirely inadmissible.” 2. “ His Majesty’s Government consider the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection.” Not to speak of the fact that the spirit of the Treaties explains and demonstrates the rights of the Persian Government over the island in question, such an answer has never been put forward in the correspondence on the subject which has passed between the high officials of the two Governments in London and Tehran, and apparently it is the first time that such an answer has been given by the British Legation. To refrain from giving a long and detailed reply to this statement, I content myself on this occasion with a reference to a distinct Agreement made between the high officials of the tw r o Governments on the 30th August, 1822, and signed by Sir William Bruce, the Special Commissioner of the British Government. In the Agreement in question the decision about the case was as follows :—• “The Island of Bahrein has always heen a dependency of Pars. The Bani Attaheh inhabitants of the island disobeyed the orders of the Fars authorities and applied to the Military Commander tor a flag. The flag will be taken back if already given, and hereafter protection will he refused to the Arabs mentioned above.”' V - 2 In view of the clear expressions used in your previous note, in which the rights the Persian Government over the island in question have not been denied, I hope y i\ will continue to follow the former opinion of the British Government in regard to t rights of the Persian Government over that island, and you will not interpret r telegram addressed to the trading classes in Bahrein to mean anything but a mark o*f friendship between the two Governments. The telegram in question does not in anv way compromise the rights of the Persian Government over the island. If the ^ any statement to be made in regard to certain difficulties about the inhabitants of t! island, it is a separate question, which must be settled according to justice. Note .—I cannot find the exact English text of the Agreement referred to, but I think the Grand Vizier refers to the Agreement made in 1822 between the British Besident at Bushire and the authorities in Ears. This Agreement was not ratified by His Majesty’s Government, and the Besident was recalled.—A. K. Annex. Memorandum by Mr. Brant on Agreement with Persia of August 30, 1822, regarding Bahrein. It is quite true that Captain William Bruce (he was not at that time Sir William) signed, on the 30th August, 1822, an Agreement with His Boyal Highness Hoosain Mr. G. Wil- Ally Mirza, Prince of Shiraz. The find Article of this Treatv was as follows :— lock, No. 1, ^ January 25, “ The Island of Bahrein, which has always been subordinate to the Province of Ears and its possessors the Beni Uttoobee Arabs, who have of late been unruly aud disobedient, and had applied to the Commanding Officer of the British forces'for a distinguishing flag ; this flag, if it has been granted, to be withdrawn, and no assistance to be rendered to the Beni Uttoobee Arabs hereafter.” The 4th section of Article V contains an undertaking to give naval assistance to a Persian expedition against Bahrein. This Agreement was entirely contrary to the views of the Government at Bombay, and letters were written to the Prince of 8 hiraz disavowing the Treaty in strong terms and announcing the recall of Captain Bruce. . .^ ot onl y did tile Indian Government disavow the Treaty, but Mr. G. Willock, British Bepresentative at Tabreez, reported that— Mirza Baugur, Anhie, who had been deputed to Court to obtain the ratification ot the Treaty, did not meet with a favourable reception; and His Majesty the Shah, w ulst let using his accordance to tim stipulations, expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Govern ment without his knowledge and injunctions.” Mr. E. Grant Duff, No. 247, Septem ber 26, 1906 This Agreement was therefore disavowed by the Indian Government in the most explicit manner, and it appears to have failed to secure the sanction of the Shah. ^ ^ 7 (Signed) B.

I HAVE received your despatch No. 4 of the 13th January last, regarding the refusal of the local authorities of Bushire to recognize the title of Persians in the employ of foreigners in Persia to the good offices of the latter’s Consular representatives. Article XII of the Treaty between Great Britain and Persia of 1857 contains the following clause:— “ Saving the provisions in the latter part of the preceding Article, the British Government will renounce the right of protecting hereafter any Persian subject not actually in the employment of the British Mission or of British Consuls-General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents, provided that no such right is accorded to or exercised by any other foreign Powers.” Cases have undoubtedly arisen in recent years in which the Russian Legation has protected Persian subjects not in the employ of the persons mentioned in Article XII. In these^ circumstances it appears to me that in cases of gross oppression by the local authorities it is legitimate for you or any other British Consular officer to intervene to protect Persians in the employ of British subjects. I should, however, recommend you only to intervene in extreme cases, and never where there is a reasonable [1923 r—5]probability that the Persian subject concerned has committed an offence punishable by Mahommedan law. I recently gave protection to the Maj id-es* Saltaneh, who was for six months in “bast” at the British Consulate-General at Tabreez, and on the refusal of the^ Shah’s Government to permit him to leave Persia, I instructed Mr. Wratislaw to appoint hi m his Mirza. He was subsequently allowed to leave the country. As regards subjects of the Sultan of Muscat—Bahreinis, Koweitis, &amp;c.—in British employment in Persia, I think it is your duty to protect them, and I request you to report to me any cases in which the local authorities decline to accept your repre sentations on behalf of such persons.

It will be observed that the Persian Government claim Bahrein and its inhabitants as the unquestion able property and subjects of the Shah, and refuse to entertain the proposal that the British Resident at Bushire should be permitted to use his good of fices on behalf of the Bahreinese. Sir E. Grey considers that the present opportu nity should be taken of informing the Persian Gov ernment that their claims to the island are entirely inadmissible The Under Secretary of State, India Office.inadmissible, and of asserting the British right to protect its inhabitants. He therefore proposes, if Mr. Secretary Morley concurs, to instruct Mr. Grant Duff to reply in the sense of the enclosed draft telegram, but he would be glad to be favoured with any observations or suggestions which Mr. Morley may have to make on the subject.

It appears that although we have never acqui esced in Persian Government’s pretensions, we have not made to them definite statement of our views and present opportunity should he taken of doing so. You should receive Persian note and reply in following terms:- Treaties of 1809,1614 and 1857 have always been scrupulously observed by His Ma jesty’s Government, but have no bearing on present question. We have never admitted ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein and such a claim is wholly inadmissible. We consider island and its inhabitants to be under British protection and must decline to entertain any further representa tions on the subject. This has been invariable re ply to Turkish Government who have on several occa sions advanced a claim to Bahrein. We must there foretherefore maintain our right to use good offices on behalf of Bahreinese in Persia; you are instruct ed to report if any cases occur of their being sub jected to molestation or injustice at hands of Persian Authorities, in which event we will consider what further action is necessary.wmmmm ^ xmar Uccument is the Property 01 ms Britannic Maj&lt; y Gove.

WITH reference to your Lordship’s telegram No. 81 of the 10th ultimo, and to my telegram No. 150 of the 16th ultimo, I have the honour to state that during the last two°years both Sir A. Hardinge and myself have repeatedly tried to induce the Persian Government to come to a reasonable understanding as regards the status of Bahreinis in this country. On receipt of the instructions contained in your Lordship’s telegram No. 81, I again discussed the question with the Mushir-ed- Dowleh, and did my best to induce his Excellency to allow His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire to exercise his good offices on behalf of the subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. In view of the Shah’s contention that Bahrein is part of his dominions, and the people of that island his subjects, it was impossible for me to come to any satisfactory settlement. In obedience to your Lordship’s instructions I declined to discuss the Shah’s claims. Mushir-ed-Dowleh eventually informed me . that the Persian Government had decided to instruct Ala-es-Sultaneh to communicate directly with your Lordship on the subject. I submit that the attitude of the Persian Government has produced a deadlock, and that further discussion of the question here is unlikely to serve any useful purpose.

August 21st, 1905 My Lord:- With reference to previous correspondence respecting the status of Bahreinis in Persia, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a note ad dressed by me to the Persian Foreign Minister recapitu lating a suggestion made by me for a provisional 'modus vivendi* as a means of terminating the present deadlock. I have been careful to explain to His Excel lency that I do not know what view would be taken of this suggestion by Your Lordship or the Government of India, but I would ask you to be so good as to in struct Mr. Grant Duff on the subject, in case the question should assume a practical form on the Shah's return. should be come to for putting an end to the deadlock The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G. &amp;c ., &amp;c ., &amp;c , fn y arises out of the obsolete claims of the Persian Gov ernment, and which prevents their obtaining any jus tice or redress, e it he r t hr ou gh His Maj e st y ’ s Resi dency at Bushire or Legation at Tehran. I have kc ., (Signed) Arthur H. Hardinge. k mcopy • GULAHEK. August 22nd, 1905 Your Excellency:- Some time ago I had the honour of having a conversation with you on the subject of the status of natives of Bahrein in Persia. I pointed out to you that the insistence of the Persian Government in treat ing these persons as Persian subjects, when as a mat ter of fact it exercised no effective authority over Bahrein, was of a nature to produce a deadlock and is might possibly lead to reprisals on the part of the Chief of Bahrein upon the Persian subjects living in his islands. I reminded Your Excellency that at the instance of His Majesty's Resident in the Persian Gulf the Government of India had quite recently sent men of war to Bahrein and compelled the Sheikh to compen sate certain Persian merchants assaulted by the Arabs and to exile and punish the leaders in the assault one of whom was his own nephew; but that it was an il logical position for us to protect Persian subjects in Bahrein and to use for this purpose the authority de rived Excellency The Mushir ed Bowleh, &amp;c ., &amp;c ., &amp;c .,derived by us from our treaties with the Sheikh, while the Persian Government persisted in ignoring on the ground of ancient claims of its own any repre sentations which His Majesty's Legation might make on behalf of Bahreinis in Persia. I accordingly suggested that, without any formal renunciation by Persia of whatever claims she might deem herself to possess in respect of Bahrein, some practical modus vivendi might be found for terminating the existing deadlock, such for instance as an exchange of notes under which the Persian Government would declare it self willing to permit His Majesty's Resident at mi shire, to exercise his good offices on behalf of Bahreinis in Persia whilst reserving if it thought necessary its rights to revive its ancient claims, should it deem the moment opportune, Your Excellency replied to this suggestion, which I should observe parenthetically was a purely personal one of my own not made under instructions from His Majesty's Government, that it was impossible tor you in the absence of the Shah to modify the ex isting1 ''\ ' VY 'C % existing practice t but that you would put the matter before His Majesty on his return with a view to the practicability of some such modus vivendi as I had proposed being considered. As I am leaving, for Meshed to-morrow, I venture to recall this question to Your Excellency’s attention J as one of those which I would ask you to submit to the i f ■ Shah Immediately on his. return. Should His Majesty fjf * be disposed in principle to view the idea with favour, . Mr. Grant Duff would then refer for instructions to His Majesty’s Government and if the latter also ap proved it, would discuss with Your Excellency the form which the arrangement contemplated should assume. So far of course the discussion has not passed beyond * the phase of a personal exchange of views between Your Excellency and myself as to a possible way out of a situation which both sides recognize as one of great practical inconvenience.
