Pakaia gatx ^ J( j L^ , J I enclose a note on Office Routine, which was compiled 'by Bajagopalan (officiating Head Clerk, Bushire j and which formed the 'basis of a lecture given to the last 'batch of recruits. All new clerks now have to study this excellent note as soon as they arrive at Bushire. 2. Although this note was written primarily for the Main Office at Bushire, much the greater part of it applies to all offices. If every clerk in the cadre followed the instructions in this note our office work would undoubtedly 'be considerably lighter and our files would 'be 'better kept. You may possibly like to circulate this note among your staff.VJJ x JLO-XH HODTXx^ I shall -irst of all cLescri'be 'briefly how correspondence, the life sorea. of an office, is dealt with, with particular reference to the Lain Office in Bushire. 2. Correspondence consists mainly of telegrams and letters, and nowadays when due to the war, surface communications involve long delays, most of the correspondence in our office is done 'by telegram. Telegrams may 'be in plain language or in code or in cypher depending on the nature, confidential or•otherwise, of the subject^ and letters may 'be in the forer of official letters, demi-official letters, express letters, printed letters, endorse ments, memoranda, etc. There is another class of communication called the :; bavIngram : , received mainly from Consular Offices and Ecf assies. bavingrams are only copies 'by post of telegraphic messages and they are classed with express letters and treated with the same urgency. 3. A letter or telegram, as soon as it is received in office, is called a ITresh Beceipt. bpeakine; of letters these come either through the local post office or 'by means of safe-hand' 'bags with Captains of Iritish vessels and pilot:; of aircraft. The mails are opened 'by an officer and passed on tc the Head of the office, ' Secretary in our- Office, who after perusal sends them 'back to the office, initialling and dating every letter. On letters reQuiring urgent action, he marks 'URQEKT' or which means that those letters should 'be given prior attention. Telegrams as soon as they are received from the Telegraph Office, aiv mecoded if in code. The fact that a telegram came enclaii or in such and such a code, ( v e have two codes in main Office, The government Telegraph Code and the Indian ord Code; there arc some confidential codes and 03^hers kept in Confidential Office) the numljer: the date ox origin; the date of receipt; the name ol the sender, and if the telegram was marked n Immediate' the time of 01igin and receipt - all these doteils are given as 'below, - .

There are separate registers for letters and telegrams ihe Register has the following columns ^ - No. and Date. I'^rom whom received. Subject Compilation or file number. 8.

Particular care should 'be taken to enter in thC ( appropriate columns a 'brief description of the subject matter o.t the letter or the telegram, and the compilation. Such entries-as 'i'inance Department Notification', ,s Am©nclment' ? 'Office . lemorandum' etc., are useless and do not help to identify th^ papers. There are hundreds of Finance Department Notifications and Office memoranda. A 'bri-ef mention of the subject, such as 'Revision of Leave Rules' , 'Borrowing rate of G-overnment' 1 , 'Amendment to General provident Fund Rules', 'Outbreak of smallpox in Gwadur', 'Wreck of Fateh Rahman' , etc., is to 'be made. Great care must also 'be taken to fill in in the correct column the compilation i.e., the file on which the paiDer is dealt with. The record keeper will give this ^ information,' 'but it is the duty of the clerk maintaining the Inward Register to see that the register is complete in every respect. 11. After registration the letters and telegrams are passed on to the record keeper to 'be put up on the relevant files. Before 'beginning to nut up the fresh Receipts the record keeper first so; -t j out the mails, as there may 'be more than one paper for a prT-'-^.eular file, and certain papers have to 'be passed on to other sections of the office for disposal in their respective files, viz., Treasury, Public Works Department, Consular Office, Publicity Section. Telegrams, express letters, bavingrams and such others as have 'been marked 'TJrgent i? or 'Early' by the officer should t&gt;e given prior attention. As a general rule, telegrams, express letters and bavingrams must be put up on the same day on vhich tho^ have been received and other papers within four days ol' their receiDt. In no circumstances should a paper be delayed for more than a week before submission to the officer concerned. If for any reason, papers cannot be put up within a week, such^papers should be submitted to the officer, with a note explaining the reason why it is not possible to put them up on the relevant files and his orders obtained. 12. After sorting out the mails, the record keeper begins to put up the papers on the relevant files. Every file consists of two parts; ' one the main body containing the correspondence and x the other the note sheets appended to the body. In the note -sheets are recorded the orders on the various papers, and a reading oi the notes will usually show how and why certain action on. a certain paper was decided upon. 13. Every letter,-memorandum, telegram, etc., which is placed in the body of the file as part of the correspondence whether*issue or receipt excluding enclosures has a serial number. This number is enclosed in a circle, written in rod ink or red pencil in the ease of receipts and in blue black ink or blue pencil in the casu of isbuus, at the top of the first page of the paper. This number in cire] e should never be written on the left hand top corner ox tne paper 3 ,s it would be difficult to see once the paper was placed m the iy of a file. 14. Each serial is entered in the note-sheet giving thie type ca paper under consideration, i.e., letter, telegrara, memorandum, etc., its nufeer and. date^ the name or title of the sender in the case ci-4- receip rn ^n ( i the name or tiule of the addressee in the case of issues, ihe numlDer o.f the serial enclosed in a circle is given lairneoj aly -.T dovc the entry in red ink and issues in mue-black ink. us 'ocess is called docketing. ^^• Sver.v letter or - tele^raio, etc., suloiuitted, i.e., the 'paper under ccm:;:u. ration (p.u.c. j has a 'Paper Under Consideration' fcS p: ^ nne(i 1:0 'the top of the first page and has the serial number i il' e ' ■ jr ? a cn it in red enclosed in a circle and the necessary docket entry is made in the note sheets ~ ~ o rr ? ^ • o • ?

The Record Keeper reads through each p.u.c'. carefully and all the references cited therein are marked in pencil giving the correct serial numher or page number. In some cases a reference cited may not have 'been received in the office in that event, the words 'Not Received''' are written in pencil against tho.t reierence. All references are to 'be entereo either on the top, 'bottom or right hand margin of the letter, and are not to he written in the left hand margin as they cannot 'be clearly seen when the paper is filed. Any other reference relevant to the p.u.c. is also put up. 17. The p.u.c. is then submitted with a concise and clear note referring to previous correspondence suggesting the action to 'be taken and wherever possible a draft is put up ror approval. The paragraphs of the note-sheets are numbered in one series and irrespective of the serial numbers. At the bottom of each note should oe written (±Yom N/para x). This indicates to the person to v,no.; the note is submitted where he should begin reading. The noto is then initialled and dated (giving the date, the month and the yearj at the right hand side, and the designation of the person to whom the note is submitted is written on the left, i.e., S~.(for Secretary) T.O. (for Treasury Officer) a.S. (for Executive Engineer) A.R.o, vior Assistant ivosidency Surgeon) etc. Every draft submitted must have a 'Draft for Approval' ( jj.i T.A . ) slip pianod to the top of the first page. If more than one draft is submitted they are marked i)ci ,A. I, 11, D.P.A. Ill, etc., to facilitate identification. to jo clearly shown in the D.x.A. whether it is a letter, memo randum, Demi-official, etc., or if a telegram in what code it is to issue. Generally speaking a letter is replied to by a letter, a demi-official by a demi-official, a telegram by a telegram, but, discretion should be used and the Question of urgency must always be considered. All references cited in the draft are oarked in pencil. 18. When a file is submitted, papers etc. are placed in the following orders- (Top) Books, maps, photographs, etc. Note sheets. Papers under consideration (in proper order) Draft(s) for approval. Current file. rile(s) for reference. (Bottom) Sometimos it happens that for the disposal of a p.u.c. in a certain file, it is necessary to link another file, which itself has some p.u.,c t s for disposal. In such cases a yellow 'Please see Linked File' slip is pinned to the file board of the too file. This indicates to the officer that some action is called for on the linked file also. . It is not necessary to pin the 'Linked Pile' slip if the other file is put up only for reference and no action is called for therein; it is just placed bole . the current file. /i9. The19. The officer records in the note-sheets his orders on the various p.u.c.'s submitted on the file, which then comes 'back to the office for taking action on the orders passed. If a draft proved for issue, it goes to the telegram clerk if a telegram, or the typist to he faired for signature if it is a letter, muinoranduia, etc 0 Registers called 'Outward Begisters'' are maintained giving full details of all outgoing correspondence from the office. Separate registers arj /i../ ained for letters and telegrams and also for letters to the ^mtassy, Tehran, and Foreign Office, Numbers for telegrams to Tehran are obtained^ from the Confidential Office, who maintain a separate series • for all telegrams issued to the Embassy, Tehran. Like the Inward Begister, the 'Outward Register' has the foliovmg columns Serial. No. Sate. Conro ila tion No . To whom sent. Subject. 20. The serial number runs consecutively frcri the 1st January each year to the 31st December. A new series is opened each year.' All letters and telegrams issuing from the of ^je have a nunTber. The Telegram clerk, who maintains th3 outward register for telegrams and the typist who maintains the outward register for letters must take care to see that all columns are correctly filled in, and that the compilation and subject matter are invariably entered. 21. After taking an outward number the typist fa*' rs the letter for signature in the correct form, viz., official letter, nemorandum, demi-official, etc. If there are any enclosures to be attached to the letter, this fact is indicated in the margin of the letter by a small line typed out againsu the particular line of the text in which a mention of the enclosure has been made. The typescript is then checked and* the ofx^ice copy markec 0/C is initialled by the person checking it. The references are marked in pencil in the office copy^cefore sending ut) to the officer concerned. In some offices, and m \case of the Political Resident the letters for signature a- _ .nt up in a signature pad, between separate sheets of blotting T)aper. The office copy with the below is placed on the first page, the fair copy in the next page, and so on. In some cases as in the Main Office jt is customary to send the file back with the office copy on the top, the D.F.A. below, the fair copy next, the note-sheets, the p=u.c. and the current file below in that order, so that the officer may, if necessary, check the letter before signing it. 22. It is proposed to introduce in this office shortly the system of using signature pads. Unless the officer asks for the file to be sent with the fair copy, letters after being faired will be,sent in the signature pad. 23. After signature, the letter is passed on to the despatch clerk for despatch. Before despatching a letter, it is his responsibility to see that the letter oears a number and dc&amp;e, bears the signature of a competent officer, and that all the enclosures mentioned in the letter are attached in the proper order. This means that the despatcher must read evury paper before despatching it. 24. I must say a few words here about our office, so that a clear Picture of the despatching procedure is obtained. The ^ Persian Gulf Besidency is a Residency as far as the Arab littora.. is concerned, and a Consulate-General in Persia. The jieadquartei is at Bushire. The Besidency is directly under the External Affairs Department of the Government of India for administration though under the India Office for matters of policy on the Arab side and the Embassy for affairs in Persia. _ Some Consular matters are disposed of direct with the foreign Office. .^herc aru six sub-offices attached to the Besidencyi. if I f -6- Eahrain under a Political Agent. Huscat -do- Kuwait -do- Khorramshahr under a Consul. Kerman -do- Bandar A^as -do- Under the jurisdiction of some of these sub-offices tL are smaller offices ? e.g., UKQEE EAimBI . .-'olitical Officer, Trueial Coast ■ n Headquarters ard in his absence Residency Agent '5 at Sharjah. mpm xn. i: JAT. British Agent, G-wadur. mnm laiio/LR iiBE^s . British Agent, Jask. rnmsn BUbKIRS . Consular Agent, Lingah. 25. . In Khorasan there is a Consulate-General wit^ its head quarters at Meshed, and under him there are the fold ing sul)- offices:- C ons ul, Zahidan. Vice-Consul, Eirjand, Za'bul hut only in matters of clerical postings is the Consulate-General for .Fars in Bushire directly concerned with the Consulate-General fc Khorasan in . eshed, in all other matters the lie shed Consulate-General is independent. Most of the correspondence from Lushire is with the External Affairs Department of the Government of India, the Accoun tant General, Central Revenues, New Delhi, the six suh-offices at . r Muscat, Bahrain, Kuwait, Khorramshahr, Kerman and Bandar Ahhas, Xiin-'-Rh and Sharjah; with the India office and the foreign C'ffice, - jc ; with the Embassies at Baghdad and r . hran, the Consulate- Ge iexal at Basra and the Consulate at Shirr.z; und also with the ■ commercial firms in India with whom frequent orders have to be placed for stores for the_office. All our correspondence for the suh-offices, Lingah, External Affairs Jep atment, Accountant General ■ antral Revenues, India Office, Boraigh Office, etc., is sen under cover of a .way 'bill. Separate way 'bill hooks are maintained for each office. The way hills are nu. ered and give particulars of the date and the route 1)3% whic, the letters are sent, the numbers of the various letters, etc., etc. The way hills are generally prepared in triplicate; two are sent with the letters, enclosed in the same cover or hag, to the addressee, one of which is returned duly receipted. some cases e.g. in the case of Tehran and other inlauu. posts and Basra, the original way 'bill is sent in the first i ice; hy the next mail is sent the duplicate, so that even ii _ e original cover is lost in transmission, the contents of the cover may he known from the duplicate way 'bill. If correctly received, the original way hill is returned duly receipted. 26. Letters (non-confidential) to Shiraz, Tehran, Kerman and East Iran are sent hy Registered Persian Post; letters for the Government of India, the Accountant General, Central Revenues, various firms and private individuals in India and mails for England, are sent hy Registered Air Mail via Bahrain. These are sent under cover of a separate way 'bill to the Political Agunt, Bahrain, for posting. The charges incurred are debited to the Bushire Residency Account. ' Iiails for Lingah and Bandar Ahhas r,re also sent to Bahrain for onward transmission. The former is addressed C/o the Political Officer, Trueial Coast /( •or o • e o-7- for 'de 1 Ap-ent, Sharjah) and sent vi;i Tabrain (if there is no ir ift:; toar'&amp;'rs'^s.-sij sa steamer -vice is availalDle.

As regards telegrams the draft after ^ clerk concemed for issue, as stated atove. In cc - telegram may te addressed to more th an one addressee. The dis trioution is shown in the preamble, Just before the text, J!rc. +h=i ontwoWl rosister for telegrams a number is talcen, aiuer filling in the relevant coluinns; first the telegraphic,address of'the' addressee is Siown. Tte number of the te^g^m is bhom just £±rH2te before the text (some offices put the number aftei signature group). For examplef.- ra0DH01.CE, CAIRO. A/4i36 AH0ED =BRITG ONSUI^ or PROHROiiCE s CAIRO.

If the telegram is marked M Imi .crtatt H or 'Lmmediate' the word 'Important' or 'Immediate' is inserted beiore tho address, as- E/IijlEDIATE PRODROME, CAIRO. 30 The requisite number of copies are taken; for all tele^ams roinp to -olaces outside Iran two copies .are to be senu to the l ^ Ig l ?aSh Offict for telegrams to places inside Iran,,one copy.is sent to the Telegraph Office; and of course ^ fl 0 ^ ic 2 h f^arLters -rp-Minpd The text is put in the code mentioned and the characu are written toldly and legilly in Mock liters and sometimes tVDed Each copy is then stamped with the office seal ana ig Tthe person isling it: entorci in —i addressee of the telegram, and sent to the lelegram umce 31, Three co-pies are then typed; one for the I He ? one (bible) for P .R. , and the other for the issue ^oible. telegrams issued are typed in the same form as receipto. 32 The telegrams issued and the office copies of letters /issuedissuad are then docketed iri 'blue-Mack ink under the correct serial number as explained a'bove, the forward reference is marked as also the referencescited in the telegram, and then filed in the 'body of the file. Before putting a file 'back in its proper place the Record Keeper reads through the notes carefully to ensure that action has 'boun taken on all the p .u.c.s, that action has teen taken on all orders passed; that the correct serial number, page number, referencing, etc., are given; and notes in his diary the date on which the file is to he resub mitted, if such an order has 'been passed, 33, The telegram and despatch clerks also maintain a reminder register. The number, date and compilation of all issues (telegrams or letters as the case may 'be) are entered in a register, and one week in the case of telegrams and approximately a month in the case of letters are allowed for a reply; 1 if no reply has 'been received a list of such files is given to the Record Keeper to enable the reminder to issue. 34. This is a rough outline of the way in which correspondence is dealt with here. It is the same in all the offices in the Gulf though perforce there are variations in details to suit local conditions. 35. Speaking individually of the different sections in the office, there are certain checks which each section must oxercise in the performance of the duties of that section. 36, . This is the most important section of the office, as the whole structure of the office is 'based on records. If the records are properly maintained, and previous papers on any par ticular subject are easily made available, it is easy for the officer concerned to decide on the proper coursu of action. Time spent on embellishing the records of an office, in perfecting the manner in which th.; records are maintained is time well and usefully spent, though the real advantage of good record keeping may not hv. apparent for several years. A proper index register of the files kept in the Record Room is/essential. The following are some of the routine checks which a record keeper must exercise when putting up a paper. (i) He must see that the paper has been registered; bears the office stamp, the'inward register number, and that it has been initialled bytte officer. (ii) He must satisfy himself that the file on which he is putting it up is the relevant file. (iii) That a p.u.c. slip has been pinned to it, (iv) That the correct serial number has been entered on it in red enclosed in a circle, (v) That ALL the references have been marked, and that all the relevant files have been put up. (vi) That in cases where a linked file also reouires some action to be taken, a slip to that effect is pinned to the top latoito file. (vii) That the pages of the file have bee 1 ' correctly numbered. (viii) That forward referencing has been made. (ix) That the note-sheet paragraphs have been correctly numbered. (x) That all the p.u.c. 9 s are entered in proper sequence in the note-sheets, and / (X3. / , , , . .xi) That an additional note-sheet has 'been tagged on to the note-sheets, if necessary. be Similarly when the file returns to him, after disposal (i (ii (iii (iv (v (vi (vii (viii 37.

That all the issues have 'been docketed in blue-hlack ink, under proper serial numbers in the note- sheets and that the serial numbers are also noted on the issues themselves in 'blue pencil. That all references have been marked and that necessary forward reference i have been made. That the N/paras have all been correctly numbered. That the papers are correctly and' neatly filed. Ensure that the file is returned to its proper place in the rack. The p.u.c. should be read carefully; read every reference before you write a word and if necessary first make out a list of points to be answered. The note should bo concise and to the point. Unneces sary and useless chit-chat in notes should be rigidly eschewed. Sometimes it may be necessary to send routine notes and slips from one clerk to another in the same office, but they should be destroyed as soon as they have served their pur pose, and should not be kept on the files. Always sum up with a clear solution or alternative solutions. If possible add a draft embodying your solution. The note should be courteously written, but should not be servile in tone. Above all read the current and connected files. Tl^s first object of a draft is to convey the exact intention of the orders. . The language used should be courteous but concise, clear and incapable of misconstruction. Lengthy sentences, abruptness, circumlocution, magniloquent phrases, superlatives and repetitions, whether of words, expressions or ideas should be avoided. Wherever possible reference to previous correspondence and a brief title should be given. When a request or a recommendation is refused, the decision should always be conveyed in the most courteous form possible.10, (ix) Whenever the notes and orders adrait or it the draft should follow them verbatim ; 'but when this is not the case, the drafter must ezercise his discrcticr in condensing or expanding the notes. ^ 'ho hanu- writing of drafts must 'be conpact, neat ana iegiDie, and abbreviations should be avoided as likely to confuse the typist. It is preferable to type lengthy notes and drafts. All notes and ^afts of more than three or four lines should be typed before submission to the Political Resident. ■ (x) The practice of transmitting with covering letters, a pass of enclosures containing unnecessary repetition of information intended to bo conveyed should be avoided. No papers should accompany a letter which are not essential to a clear and pr^cisu ■understanding of the question r of or rod,. ^ • •; - _ ^ ^ other hand care must be taken that ohe information to be conveyed is not deficient or meagre. Ordinarily drafts of letters should be self-con tained; in cases, however, which involve an important principle or which ma T be.intricate in their details^ it is proper that all papers which bear on the points at issue should accompany the letter. (xi) All the references in the draft should be marked. (xii) Clear indication should be given in th-j a raft whuther it is a letter, a memorandum, express Letter, etc., or if a telegram the code in which it should ±SoU^, and such other details. 38.

Check that the name and address are correctly shown on the outer cover and that it is properly sealed and gummed. Demi-official letters should be placed in separate covers addressed by name to the officers concerned; these are then put in another cover, along with the other mails.

Before taking delivery he must make sure that the seal and outer coverings of the letter, parcel -or bag have not been tampered with. These mail bags are frequently of a highly confidential and secret nature and he must never part with them even for a second and he must on no account give them to a third party.

Telegraphic Priorities Sir, . . . .e In order to obtain internationally recognised priority for Government telegrams over private telegrams it has been necessary since 1st January. 1949, to claim such priority by inserting the words 'ORGS WITH PRIORITY' in the space for 'Service Instructions ' in telegrams handed in for transmission by the public telegraph system. These words are inserted in all cases coming under categories (i), (ii) and (iii) in paragraph 2 below and also those in the ROUTINE category whenever Government priority is considered essential. 2. It is also necessary, however, to have a system of indicator words (or domestic precedence markings) in order to ensure the handling of telegrams in the proper order for working purposes. The precedence markings used for this purpose have hitherto been MOST IMMEDIATE, IMMEDIATE and IMPORTANT. I have to inform you that, in order to make these markings more descriptive and thus to guard against the tendency, so noticeable in the past, to give telegrams higher precedence markings than are justified by their content, classification precedences for Government telegrams have been revised with effect from 1st May, 1949, In particular, an entirely different name is now given to the top category ' MOST IMMEDIATE ' in order to distinguish it more clearly from the category immediately below. The revised standard categories are: — (i) EMERGENCY. To be strictly reserved for matters of extreme urgency requiring the highest degree of priority in transmission and instant attention on receipt, at whatever hour of the day or night, by the appropriate authority on whatever level of seniority. This marking must therefore be used on rare occasions only.1 ' (ii) IMMEDIATE. To be used only in cases of great urgency when immediate action by a responsible officer is necessary. (iii) PRIORITY. To be used for any other telegrams which require urgent treatment. This prefix is sufficient to secure priority in handling over all other classes of telegrams except ' safety of life ' telegrams and categories (i) and (ii) above. • (iv) ROUTINE, i .e., ordinary telegrams which are transmitted in turn with ordinary private telegrams, unless they are specially marked in the appropriate panel on the draft (see paragraph 10). (v) DEFERRED telegrams are those for which a period of up to 48 hours may be allowed in transmission (including encyphering and decyphering). See also paragraph 8. ' 3. The main purpose of the division into five categories is to ensure proper treatment by— {a) communications, sections and registries; {b) the British public and the Services telegraph systems; and (c) authorities to whom telegrams are addressed. The first three categories are also taken into account by Cable and Wireless, Limited, and may later be recognised by some foreign systems. 4. Originators drafting or authorising telegrams should not ask for any category of priority unless it is essential. In ordinary circumstances, the great majority of Government telegrams should be sent in the ROUTINE or DEFERRED categories, which rank for transmission with private full rate telegrams over the public telegraph system. 5. In particular, it is imperative that the utmost discretion should be used before authorising the use of ' EMERGENCY.' In the past the precedences ' MOST IMMEDIATE' and ' IMMEDIATE ' have been very largely abused. It is intended that the new categories ' EMERGENCY ' and ' IMMEDIATE ' should be regarded as definitely higher than the old, and that they should be much less freely used. 6. If some degree of precedence is essential, the marking ' PRIORITY ' should in the great majority of cases be sufficient. The tendency of originators of telegrams to over-estimate the urgency of their messages must be resisted, as must any attempt to relate urgency to the importance of a subject and the level at which it is being considered. The abuse of priority markings defeats its own object by producing congestion and false rush periods which impose unnecessary pressure at each point on the line of communication. A factor which originators often overlook is the time differences between the various parts of the world and the necessity for taking them into consideration must therefore be emphasised.7. Telegrams for transmission in the ' EMERGENCY' category require the authorisation in the Foreign Office of officers of status not lower than that of Head (or Acting Head) of Depart ment. At diplomatic missions the use of EMERGENCY must be authorised by the Head of the Mission, officers of the rank of Minister or Counsellor, or the Head of Chancery; at Consular posts this authority should not be delegated by the Head or Acting Head. 8. The word ' ROUTINE ' should not be inserted either in the address or in the Service instructions on telegraph forms; the absence of any other indicator is sufficient evidence that a telegram is in this category. The word ' DEFERRED ' should never be inserted in any telegram, but should be indicated in the panel for priority categories (see paragraph 10). 9. The fullest possible use, compatible with the proper conduct of business, should be made of the DEFERRED category. This will have the effect of spreading the telegraphic load more evenly throughout the periods of transmission and it will enable the mass of non-priority telegrams to be sorted into order for disposal. The DEFERRED category is appropriate for— (a) telegrams for which a period of up to 48 hours may be allowed for transmission (including encyphering and decyphering); (b) telegrams for which the SAVING procedure is not suitable; and (c) telegrams which have on occasion to be telegraphed by reason not of particular urgency, but of the slow means of communication otherwise available. 10. Future supplies of draft telegram forms provided for the Foreign Service will contain a panel (similar to that at present for the security gradings) giving the five priority categories. 11. I request that you will issue appropriate instructions to all those concerned in the drafting and handling of telegrams and that you will lay particular emphasis on the definitions given in paragraph 2 and on the directions laid down in paragraphs 5 and 6. 12.

Dear Adams, You are doubtless accustomed to our constant complaint that we do not have enough staff here. One partial solution of this problem would be to effect some reduction in our work. ks you are aware, we act very frequently more or less as a post office between the Agencies and the outside world. jiivery question dealing with the internal administration of any of the territories must be handled by the Agencies and this means that a very large number of letters which we receive from the Foreign Office merely have to be copied to the Agency for appropriate action. We also receive a number of letters from the administrative departments of the Foreign Office which likewise have to be copied. If all the departments of the foreign Office could be asked to send any letters likely to need passing on to the Agencies in duplicate, if the subject only applies to one territory, and in quadruplicate if it applies to all the territories under our supervision ( and therefore needing to be copied to Muscat, Kuwait and Bahrain ), this would save us a very large amount of work. bimilarly, where suitable, the repeating of a telegram to the appropriate Agency not only saves time and trouble for our cypher room, who otherwise has to send it on, but makes future reference much easier. 2. There are flso frequent cases in which letters are addressed tc us which should have gone direct to one of the Agencies, notably on minor subjects of what you might call a consular nature. For instance, Northern Department recently wrote to us about a Danish seaman in Bahrain; this letcer should have gone to tne Bahrain Agency direct, I think perhaps one reason for this is that the Agencies do not appear in the white lists of the Foreign Office posts, either in the list of consular posts or in the list of missions abroad, as a result, both in the departments of the office and in missions there may well be some doubt as to what posts really exist in the Gulf. It might be worthwhile arranging for the Agencies to be listed in the list of consular offices, I should also be most grateful if you could bring ths^R ^ato^xs to the notice of the departments of the Foreign Office generally. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to a certain number of posts in the Middle ^ast. P.G,D, Adams, Esq., Personnel Department, Foreign Office, London, Yours ever, (SGD). J.A.F.

Reference para 4, the following are routine matters which a United States consul might be author ised to handle direct with the Kuwait authorities:- trade enquiries and information, transmission of general information material, requests for interviews with Government officials other than the Ruler on behalf of nationals, visits to state institutions, requests for information on health and quarantine matters, and condolences and congratulations. To bejin with all correspondence should in my opinion be conducted with the Ruler's secretary. -/e could later ascertain whether the Ruler would be agreeable to a consul addressing some of the heads of depart ments direct.[ Q 114/IG ] ll CONFIDENTIAL AND GUARD F CIRCULAR No. 27 -&gt; F oreign O ^rjce, 5f/i April, 1950. ' GUARD ' PROCEDURE Sir, Foreign Office Circular Telegram No. 2 of 1944. describing the ' Guard' procedure which was in use at that time for 'Top Secret' cypher telegrams, stated that the 'Guard' procedure was to apply not to telegrams in the Foreign Office series, but only to messages in other series passing through the Foreign Office channel, especially on supply and economic matters. 2. In August 1948 the Cypher Security Committee approved further instructions on the subject, which extended the ' Guard ' procedure to all documents (including telegrams) and to all security classifications. These latter instructions, which are still in force, were issued to all Government Departments concerned by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Security. They contained a paragraph which reads: ' ' Guard,' applied to official documents, including telegrams and reports, means that the particular document is NOT to be shown to the Americans without the prior agreement of the originator. The fact that a document does not bear the word ' Guard ' does not necessarily mean that it may be shown to the Americans. In particular, no Cabinet or Foreign Office document may be shown to the Americans, whether marked 1 Guard ' or not, without consultation with the Cabinet Office or the Foreign Office.' 3. Since the paragraph quoted above was thought to represent the general practice already existing in the Foreign Service, no further Circulars were issued to members of the Foreign Service explaining the alterations in ' Guard ' procedure which had been introduced by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Security. 4. The present practice as regards the use of the code-word ' Guard ' is however not uniform, either in the Foreign Office or in the Foreign Service generally. Certain posts, and some individuals, make use of the procedure; others do not. Moreover, although the Foreign Office does not officially use the ' Guard ' procedure, other Government Departments do, and this has led to the compromise arrangement that documents from non-Foreign Service sources, which pass through Foreign Service posts abroad, may be marked ' Guard,' provided that in telegrams the term appears at the beginning of the text and not as a prefix-heading, and that a one-time cypher is used. His Majesty's Consular Officers 16073—2 38495—215. It has become increasingly necessary that the contents ot Foreign Office telegrams and other documents should be communi cated to United States officials in the course of daily work. Moreover it has undoubtedly become the practice in certain posts, and in certain Departments of the Foreign Office, actually to show Foreign Office telegrams and other documents to Americans, and on occasion to give them copies. This relaxation of the normal Foreign Office rule applies in varying degrees in different parts of the world. It is frequent in such places as Washington, Germany and the Middle East, less frequent though not unusual in certain Departments in London. 6. In order that practice and procedure may be uniform and uenerally known throughout the Foreign Service, 1 think it desirable To lay down the rule that Foreign Office telegrams or other documents may normally only be shown to United States officials after their contents and possible repercussions have been carefully considered by Heads of Departments in the Foreign Office, or by Heads or Acting Heads of Missions or by officers in charge of Consular posts. In large posts, however, responsibility for deciding whether documents may be shown to United States officials may be delegated to specified officers. In the great majority of cases it should be possible to give the necessary information to United States colleagues without actually showing the text of telegrams or other documents and the latter should only be done when it is really necessary, to save time or for some other reason. 7. Where other Government Departments or the Services are concerned, the final sentence of the quotation from the Inter- Departmerltal instructions (paragraph 1 above) will apply. Originators may thus be confident that their telegrams and despatches will not be seen by Americans save in exceptional circumstances, when discretion will be carefully exercised, or authority obtained. , . • . , 8 Originators may, however, in future mark their telegrams, despatches or letters with the word ' Guard,' if there are special reasons why the contents should not be passed to Americans in any form, whether orally or in writing. Alternatively, it may be possible for the originator to include a short paragraph indicating which portions of the telegram or despatch should not be disclosed. In either of these cases, the document, or alternatively the passages which have been indicated, will not be passed on to Americans in any way without reference to the originator, whose agreement must first be obtained. If the code-word ' Guard ' is used in a telegram, it must be included at the beginning of the text and encyphere circular Telegram No. 2 of 1944 is cancelled. 10.

The Hunterlan System, which Is not specifically for the trans literation of Arabic, is a systetr for waiting geographical names in a conventional alphabet developed by ^ir .A. punter in India in the sixties of last century.

Consonants Most Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, dc., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics, as the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic K, a strong guttural, has been represented by k instead of q, which is often used, Secondly it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in ^his 1 or 'thin, but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse 1 and f boathook l , Burmese Words.

Thus, ywa and pwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written yuwa and puwe. It should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable, General The names of some places - e,g, Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore - have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribedt?j) prescribed I'or others. Naiues of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spellinb has been generally adopted in iiiifclish books.10th September, 1950. ^ Political Officer, Doha.

I think it is usually unnecessary to use the x.L. form in communications between this Agency and the Resi dency. if the file concerning the initiation of memoranda (in 1900 or thereabouts) is consulted, it will be seen that they can be worded, attested, etc., in exactly the same way as express letters. Express Letters should, therefore, only be used when there is real urgency, and they should be treated as such — i.e.*, expedition should be shown in every stage of dealing with them, fairing, attestation, issue from office and actual physical carriage from here to jufair. Memoranda and letters should ordinarily reach jufair a day or so after drafting so that they are quite adequate except where real urgency is required, and, incidentally, should be displayed.
