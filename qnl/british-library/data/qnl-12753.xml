            he did not sign a treaty at Shiraz, but merely forwarded the proposals of Prince Ḥusayn
            ‘Alī Mirzā for the consideration of Government. It notes that there is no medical
            officer present at Bushire to whom he can place in charge of the Residency, and that he
            must therefore wait the arrival of Lieutenant John Macleod, his replacement, before
            returning to Bombay as instructed by Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x0000ba#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
