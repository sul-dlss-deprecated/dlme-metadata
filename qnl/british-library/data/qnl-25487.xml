It will be recalled that this company was founded in 1912 by French, Bussian and British financial interests, under the auspices of the Governments of the three countries named, in order to study a scheme for building a railway across Persia. The plans were not eventually carried into execution and in 1919 a suggestion was made that the Company be liquidated. By a letter dated 31st May 1919,were informed that His Majesty^ Government considered that such liquidation was desirable, but the proposal, although supported by the British group, did not meet with the share-holders 1 approval and the company has remained in existence. How that liquidation is again suggested, we shall be obliged if you will kindly inform us whether His Majesty's Government see any objection to the British group informing the French group that they share their views and agree that the liquidation of the company should be carried into effect. We have the honour, etc., (Sgd.) Revelstoke.

It seems to have been generally agreed, that the main line should run Paku-Resht-Teheran-Ispahan- Yezd. The Committee on the subject proposed that from there the line should touch the coast at Bunder Abbas,and follow the coast from there to Karachi. Colonel (now Sir Percy) Cox was in favour of Yezd- Regan to the coast at Pozni and so to Karachi.Branch lines were recommended from Muhamrnerah through Shiraz to Bunder Abbas,and from Pushire to Shiraz;from Bun der Abbas to Regan and Chahbar to Bampur on the second alternative main line. The only strategic railway that we have con structed so far in this part of the world is the Quetta-Nushki-Mirjawar line,and there is a nronosi- H ^ tion in the Awm* nHt ywttti papers to urolong this through Basratabad to Kerman. This,how- iLuuni— ever,does not sssssasr to have been nart of the origi nal Russian nroposals,.and appears to have been added by Sir Henry McMahon. By the original proposal,as modified by Sir Henry McMahon and Sir Percy Cox,the .line would pass through Kerman,so that this would A fit in with any proposed prolongation of our one strategic railway in those parts. Obviously^it is to our great advantage to bring the main lin . he A coast and to keen it along the coast between Bunder command it from the sea.

T have the honour to invite a reference to the papers forwarded with Foreign and Political Department endorsement No. 187-E.A., dated the 6th May 1915 regarding the possibilities of Bustaneh, a village west of Bandar Abbas, as a site for the terminus of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman Railway. I notice the matter has also beeh alluded to by Lieutenant-Colonel Orton in his telegram No G -17 dated 26th March 1917. At the request of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Major J. M. Holmes, I.M.S., who has recently been to Bandar Abbas on sanitary duty, visited Bostana and has reported on its possibilities for a cantonment from the sanitary point of view. I beg to enclose a copy of Major Holmes’ report, in which, as will be seen, he condemns Bustaneh, and pronounces (apart from nautical considerations) in favour of a site east of Bandar Abbas for the cantonment. Enclosure No. 1 of Serial No. (33). Sanitary Report on Bustaneh Area. I visited, on 30th April 1917, at the request of His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, the village of Bustaneh and inspected the immediate locality in order to report on the sanitary conditions at present existing there in view of the possibility of this neighbourhood becoming at some time a sea port town on the Persian Gulf littoral. .Bustaneh village is a collection of mud huts situated on the coast some 20 miles west of Bandar Abbas. The site of the village is about 10 or 15 feet above sea level. The terrene is dead flat and extends inland for l| miles to the foot of hills which run parallel to sea coast, that is in a direction approximately east and west. West of the village this ridge of hills curves southwards to within half a mile of the sea. East of the village there is the same dead ground but here, it is separated from high water work by dunes of drift sand rising 20 to 30 feet above water level. This dead ground is nowhere more than ij miles in breadth. In places it impressed me as being at times flooded and saturated by a high level of sub-scii water. Where the natives had attempted to dig wells on this plain water “ was struck ” at an average depth of about 3j to 4 feet. Two miles east of village Mr. Howson had pits dug for me and water was found at a depth of 4| feet. This high level of sub-soil water would constitute a serious sanitary consideration were buildings on this site to be contemplated. Drainage would be difficult as this ground is little above sea level. Trenches and “ bunds dug along foot of the hills might meet with success but, after a fall, of some inches of rain, rapid and extenive flooding from these hills seems probable. As far as I am aware the average annual rainfall is not known. Heav.y rain does, however, I believe, fall in this locality at intervals during the cold season. The sub-soil water is'brackish in taste, and is probably carried dowm on imper meable strata from the hills which are in many places of salt formation. The soil consists of loose sand except where water has percolated through and cultivation has been attempted. With the exception of scattered date palm groves no cultivation or verdure is now to be seen. The climate for greater part of the year is probably exceedingly hot and damp as winds blowing from the west, the north, and the north-east must be almost entirely cut off. It seemed to me that only breezes blowing up or down Clarence Strait can : reach the Bustaneh plain. Q230(w)FP ' •24 .. % During the period of low water (as when I was ashore) there is an expanse of some 700 yards of black semi-liquid mud, left uncovered by water. This extends for miles along the coast and would in my opinion seriously affect the climatic conditions from a health point of view. The health of local inhabitants-seemed good from the little information that I could gather. Fever does not seem to be as prevalent as at other points along the coast though i personally detected mosquitoes breeding in one of the few existing pools of water which I found. The only available water-supply for drinking purposes is that collected in s yrface reservoirs during the flood season. The so-called “ birkehs are of indescribable filthy and unsanitary nature. Towards the end of the hot season water m these birJcehs seems to fail and recourse is then had to the brackish sub-soil water to tap which pits are here and there dug. I could find no evidence of potable water in the vicinity of Bustaneh nor would the geological formation of the country lead me to expect such. As regards land conditions in this area, I do not consider there is a sufficiency of space in view of the future possibility of erecting here a British and Persian cantonment with wharves, store-houses, railway station and sidings unless such buildings were to be scattered for miles along the coast. Owing to the absence of land winds and the presence of heat radiation from the surrounding hills cantonments would not be habitable were the houses to be built in close proximity. In my opinion the one and only favourable reason why a new canton ment might be situated in the Bustaneh area is that buildings for both British and native communities could be here erected on a modern scientific and sanitary basis owing to the almost entire absence of Persian habitations. The present village could be easily demolished and rebuilt as it consists of not more than a hundred mud huts. Against this there are however the following very tangible disadvantages :— (i) Entire absence of any natural potable water-supply. (ii) Unhealthy site for buildings owing to high level of sub-soil water and liability to flooding during the rainy season. (Hi) Exceedingly hot and depressing climatic conditions due to— (a) absence of land breezes, (b) heat radiation from the surrounding semi-circle of hills, (c) extensive area of liquid mud left uncovered during low tides, (d) absence of all cultivation. The existing palm groves would have to be cut down to clear building sites. (it?) Extensive length of littoral along which buildings would have to be erected to avoid over-crowding. This factor would add very materially to cost of any artificial water-supply. (r) All waste would have to be got rid of by incineration. For this process to be a success. I am positive that an ample supply of combustible refuse must be available. Such would have to be imported. A trenching or water carriage system is out of the question in the Bustaneh area. Apart from any nautical considerations which may exist, I consider that from a sanitary point of view the country lying east of Bandar Abbas presents natural conditions suitable as a site for a new cantonment markedly superior to any to be found in the vinicity of Bustaneh. J. M. HOLMES, D.Ph., D.T.M., Major, I.M.S.(34) No. 441-a.q., dated Shiraz, the 17th May (received the 5th June) 1917. Thom —Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, To— Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordi nary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia. Among the most important questions in Southern Persia calling for speedy action is that of communications. 2. The urgency of the question is extreme as, owing to a series of bad harvests^ ( combined with a visitation of locusts for six successive years and a chronic state of anarchy which has been increasing in intensity, the harvests do not suffice for the population. As a result of this unsatisfactory state of affairs, last winter I was obliged to purchase wheat in the Bakhtiari country, the cost of which, delivered at Shiraz, was terribly high. I am now indenting on India for a part of the flour supply, with the result that the traders of Bandar Abbas complain that the ordinary com merce of the port is stifled owing to demads by the military on the limited supply of transport. 3. To approach the subject from the financial point of view, the unsatisfactory state of affairs is increased by the fact that famine conditions and demand have so increased the cost of transport that one toman per camel per diem (equivalent to nearly .Rupees 5) is the average rate. It must be remembered that military activity is essential at this juncture, apart from special forces despatched to escort German prisoners, etc., and the fringing in of equipment and stores. Moreover caravans which include arms, ammunition or treasure have to be escorted by really strong detachments ; and even caravans with supplies cannot be left to the tender mercies of the robber tribesmen. Consequently there is a very heavy call on transport and its cost is prodi gious. The laying out of supplies for escorts, including grain and forage for ani mals, is also a heavy item. Eor instance, the expenditure on transport from March 1916 to, and including April 1917, is, in round figures, Rs. 15| lakhs or £100,000. This sum represents interest at 5 per cent, on a capital sum of two million pounds. 4. From the point of view of the restoration of order in Southern Persia I have already pointed out that it is largely a matter of providing good communica tions, as the robber tribes are chiefly formidable owing to the fact that caravans can be easily held up in the difficult defiles and passes and that protection cannot be afforded with any rapidity. Once roads are made, the robbers will find the main roads dangerous and will gradually take to other forms of earning their living. The nomad tribes too, would undoubtedly be more inclined to settle down into villages with the advent of the railway which would favourably affect their economic position. Until this im proved position of affaira be obtained, Persia will be unable to pay her way. Given the restoration of order with reasonable progress in the administration and more especially in the collection of revenue there is every reason to believe that Persia will be able to pay for the cost of administration and protection, as her trade will increase enormously when security is restored and modern com munications are provided. 5. I think that I have established the necessity for pressing forward the pro vision of communications from every point of view. It now remains for a com prehensive policy to be outlined to be pushed forward as quickly as possible. Railways have proved to be the only real businesslike expedient for commerce .and may be dealt with first*t ■ The only railway approaching Southern Persia is that which has been con structed westwards from Nushki to Dalbandin. It is, I understand, intended to complete this line to the Persian frontier but I have not heard whether any further extension is contemplated. The recent journey of motor cars from the railhead to Dhana Baghi and thence across the Lut to Kerman, which was reached without encountering any physical obstacle, is of considerable importance as proving that there is an ideal line for a railway from Dalbandin to Kerman; west of Kerman a track has been cleared to Sirjan (Saiidabad not Saidabad) at small cost, and from this important centre to Shiraz a track passable for motors has also been recently cleared and is now being improved. It therefore seems that the line referred to above should be continued west wards to Kerman, Sirjan and Shiraz, from which centre it may perhaps turn north wards. ' 6. The construction of the above line is of great importance, but it is of still greater importance to settle quickly upon a railway line uniting the coast with the interior as that will be the main trade artery of Southern Persia. Many years ago I reported that the Bandar Abbas-Minab-Manujan-Rudbar- Dhana Abbas Ali line crossed the main range at a comparatively low elevation and that from Rigan there were no difficulties to Kerman and Yezd ; I understand that my views have, since that date, been confirmed by a railway expert, Mr. Johns. As however the question of communications has been recently studied by Major Rich, who is actually on his way to India, it seems worth while to ascertain his views on the subject. If the railway could be constructed at reasonable cost to Sirjan, that centre would serve Kerman, Yezd and Shiraz and commei’cially that will be the best alignment unless the estimate prove to be too heavy. Owing to the changed military position there would not appear to be any objection to this alignment. In any case the question must be taken up and decided without delay as the cost of the present primitive methods of transport would pay the interest on a large capital sum. I am aware that rails are lacking but the question of alignment could be settled and the earthwork taken in hand. Meanwhile the opening up of the country by means of a road' possible for motor cars is a step in the right direction. 7. For many years I have held the view strongly that the one port of Southern Persia is Bandar Abbas. By nature it is the meeting place of the tracks from (i) Shiraz via Lar ; (ii) Yezd and Kerman via Sirjan ; (Hi) Kerman via Baft and Daulatabad ; (iv) Kerman via Jiruft and (v) Sistan via Rudbar and Rigan. 8. It seems desirable that a marine surveyor should carefully examine Bandar Abbas with a view to the selection of a port. This may have been done but I have no knowledge of the fact. I understand that if the present Bandar Abbas is to be retained, a pier some 2| to 3 miles in length will have to be constructed, whereas further west the water is deeper. From the financial and sanitary point of view it would pay to construct a new harbour on now valueless ground if the report of the marine surveyor were favour able. Water could be brought from the Kuh-i-Ginau by pipes and the curse of malaria and guinea worm, which reduces the efficiency of the man unit to a very low standard, would be removed. I am especially interested in the speedy settlement of this question as the selection of the site for the South Persia Rifles’ barracks depends on it. We do not want to lay out 7J lakhs of rupees in barracks until it is certain that there will be no change in the harbour site. 9. I have raised these important questions after an absence of some years from Southern Persia and I hope that the Deputy Resident and other officials will be able to give valuable opinions on the questions which I have outlined above. 10. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Foreign Department, the Chie-f of the General Staff, the Deputy Resident of Bushire and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Bandar Abbas.(Received on 25th May 1917, with Political Secretary’s Utter No. 17, dated April 1917.) Persian Mining Syndicate; Winchester House, / Old Broad Street, London, E. C.; February 13th, 1917. Sir, \ I have to acikiowledge your letter* No. 6520-17 of the 13th ultimo addressed to the Chairman of the Kerman Mining ♦Serial No. (16). \ Syndicate instead of to the Pemhw Mining Syndicate. I have now had the opportunity of consulting with the principal members of the Syndicate and am authorised to say that the Syndicate would appreciate very much any steps which could be taken by His Majesty s Minister at Tehran m the direction of concluding with the Persian Government their negotiations for a mining concession in Southern Persia. The Syndicate would be quite agreeable to the exclusion from the concession of 30 kilometres on either side of the proposed TramePersian Railway, subject to the conditions of paragraphs 19 to 23 of the Foreign Office Memorandum No. 9143 of the 8th April 1914. \ An alternative to these conditions which suggests itself to the Syndicate as being possibly likely to facilitate the negotiations in the present uncertain position of the Trans-Persian Railway Syndicate’s proposal is the following : (1) That the route for the proposed Trans-Persian Railway shall not run east of a straight line djawh from Bahramabad to Bandar Abbas, (excepting for the short branch line from Bahramabad to Kerman) nor west of a straight line drawn from Yezd to Lingah. (2) That the mining rights for the 30 kilometres on each side of the pro posed route of the Trans-Persian Railway, so far as it runs through the area of the Kermah Mining Concision, be granted as a separate concession to the Persian Mining Syndicate on the understanding that it will be handed over to the Persian Railways Syndicate and/ or to the Trans-Persian Railway Syndicate when the protection for the interests of the Persian Railways Syndicate provided fox m clause (1) of paragraph 19 of the above-quoted letter has been agreed. f \ k I have, etc., C.

I have the honour to invite a reference to letterj No. 441-a.q., dated the 17th May 1917, from the Inspector-General, South tSerial No. (34). Persia Rifles, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, on the subject of the improvement of communications in Southern Persia, a copy of which was sent to you by Sir P. Sykes. 2. Before I received a copy of the above I had already sent copies of the first 3 of the marginally-noted documents to Sir P. Sykes, and I have by this mail sent him a copy of the 4th. 1. Leter No. 544-Cf., dated 6th March 1911, from Polit:cal Resident, Persian Gulf, to the Government of India. v. s, 2. Note by Captain Hopkins, R.E., dated 7th February 1912. 3.

Letter No. 1181, dated 10th March 1915, from Director, Royal Indian Marine, to Govern ment of India, and enclosures. 3. These will give Sir P. Sykes some idea of what has been done and what sug gestions made on the subject of communications in Southern Persia during the last few years. Perhaps the Government of India will consider it advisable to send him such portions of the Karachi Extension Survey report as refer to the railway from Bandar Abbas to Kerman or perhaps a precis of the report if one exists. If so it and any other particularly confidential documents should be sent care of His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, to be sent by the first safe opportunity as the postal route via Lingah is not very safe. No doubt Sir P. Sykes will receive copies of Major Rich’s reports from the Chief of the General Staff. 4. In paragraph 9 of the above mentioned letter Sir P. Sykes suggessts that I should give an opinion on the points raised, I accordingly venture to offer a few remarks on the subject. I heartily agree with Sir P. Sykes that the improvement of communications in Southern Persia is urgently necessary and that the construction of good roads and Railways would be the best means of permanently pacifying the country, apd ofpromoting trade. It seems to me doubtful, however, if it will be possible to im prove the communications so quickly as to benefit the present crisis to any great extent. To do this the great desideratum is, in my humble opinion, to open j up the Bushire-Shiraz road as quickly as possible. This would, I am sure, reduce the prices of transport to a great extent, and would besides reduce the length of the journey to Shiraz to about \ of what it is at present from Bandar Abbas via Bar, and to about J via Sirjan. ' * Serial No. (34). This would at once enormously reduce the cost of transport mentioned in para graph 3.* 5. As regards the future, the question of prolonging the line from Sistan, as suggested in paragraph 5 of Sir P. Sykes’ letter, is, I believe dependent on strategical considerations. I am under the impression that the Government of India did not in the past view with favour such an extension of the Indian Railway System, but it is possible that recent events in Persia may have modified the political and strategical aspect of the matter. 6. In any case I agree with General Sykes that a railway from the coast is of much greater importance from the point'of view of supplying the South of Persia | and the South Persia Rifles and promoting British trade in the south generally. It is obvious that all kinds of goods can be brought by sea to Bandar Abbas and carried thence to Kerman and Yezd by rail much cheaper than they could be taken to those places by an all railway route through Sistan. For this reason I venture to think that a railway from Bandar Abbas via Rigan to Kerman (which has been decided upon as the best alignment for a railway from Bandar Abbas to Kerman) would be better than an extension of the Sistan line to Kerman. 7. I do not know, however, what effect (if any) the war and recent events in Russia will have on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway to Karachi, or on the activities of the Societe des Etudes or on the policy of Russia in Persia in respect of railways. In the circumstances, therefore, I am not in a position to offer any useful opinions as to the best alignments for railways into Southern Persia. I think, however, that before deciding definitely to make Bandar Abbas the port from which all lines will rediate inland, it is necessary to make sure that nothing can be done from Bushire. If the cost of constructing a line is not prohibitive Bushire offers by far the shortest route to Shiraz and Ispahan. 8. With reference to General Sykes' remarks in paragraph 8, I have as men tioned above, sent him a copy of the report of the survey made by R. I. M. S. “ Palinurus.” It will be remembered that the “ Palinurus ” found three places suitable for the port (1) Bustaneh (2) Bandar Abbas and (3) Laft Point, and that the Officer Commanding pronounced in favour of Bustaneh. This site, however, has been unhesitatingly condemned from a sanitary point of view by Major Holmes, I.M.S., {vide report submitted tSerial No. (33). with my letterj* No. 301-S., dated 20th May 1917) It will probably be difficult to decide between the nautical advantages and the sanitary disadvantages of Bustaneh. Personally I am inclined to think that the pesent town site especially if the new portion is built to the west of the existing town, will be found the best. I venture to question, however, the necessity j of spending 7j lakhs in barracks for'the South Persia Rifles either at the present j or any future site of the port. The present town is very unhealthy and the new | one is not likely to be much better, and it appears to me from general considera tions that it would be better to keep only a few men at Bandar Abbas and station the headquarters of the regiment and the local recruiting depot (if any) somewhere up the road where the climate would be better. It is possible that there may be military considerations, of which I am ignorant and on which in any case I am not qualified to form an opinion, which make it necessary to occupy Bandar Abbas in force, but failing these I venture to think that other considerations show that such a large expenditure at Bandar Abbas would be unwise. A copy of this letter is being sent to Sir P. Sykes, and to His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas.(Received on 9th July 1917, vnlh PoUtical Secretary’s letter No. 23, dated 7th June Foreign Office, S.W. 1. May 7th, 1917. No. m-84168-17.

To Thb Eight Honourable AUSTEN CHAMBEELAIN, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 4th May 1917. il Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch No. 18, dated the 1st December 1916, enquiring whether necessary arrangements can be made, when circumstances permit, to carry out prelimi nary surveys for a railway line from the Gulf to Shiraz and Ispahan and, if so, requesting that detailed proposals with estimates of cost be submitted for your consideration. Presumably the surveys contemplated are for alignments (a) from Bushire to Shiraz, (i) from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, and (c?) from Shiraz to Ispahan. 2. Apart from local considerations, considerable difficulty would be experienced, while the war lasts, in making arrangements for the carrying out of these surveys and in furnishing the requisite staff. Should, however, condi tions in Persia permit, we should make every endeavour to provide the necessary staff to carry out the work, but our ability to do so would be contingent on no further large demands being made on India for the supply of personnel for lines overseas, and on no unforeseen circumstances arising. 3. We append a very rough estimate of the cost of a railway recon naissance from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, from Bushire to Shiraz, and from Shiraz to Ispahan. As scaled from the map, the approximate lengths of these three sections are 300, 125 and 250 miles, respectively, and the total length would, therefore, amount to 675 miles. As the country, however, is generally mountainous, and as there appear to be two main routes to be investigated in each case, it may be assumed that the aggregate length to be reconnoitred will be not less than three times the length scaled from the map, or say 2,000 miles. 4. In framing their rough estimate our Eailway Board have checked their figures by the analogy afforded by Sir William John’s surveys in Southern Persia in 1912-13. These covered 3,900 miles and cost Es. 4,02,932 in all, which works out to an average of Es. 103 a mile. Nine hundred miles, however, of the total length were subjected to a somewhat detailed survey, and if these are excluded, our Eailway Board calculate that the cost of Sir William John’s survey worked out to Es. 90 a mile. On thiscost of flie surveys in question would amount to Ks. 1,80,000 in all. Rut be understood tha ■, i.u a f on iy on the assumption that the undertook his survey. t We have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servants, / ^ l 0 /&lt;o. ?' ZlL1917 . SIMLA.

I note Sir Charles Marling’s enquiry as to ’’the sphere Jn which Copper is to be reserved' and the reply which has been given to him,, but I am not quite clear as to what this has reference to as I cannot find in correspondence any allusion to the reservation of copper in any particular sphere. With regard to the last paragraph in which it is stated that Sir Charles Marling has been informed that the littoral and all islands, should, as hitherto, be excluded from the ares of the Concession I am desired by the members of the Syndicate to request that the policy of His Majesty’s Government in re gard to this portion of the proposed Concession may be recon sidered in view of the present altered circumstances. T^e littoral and the islands in the Persian Gulf were originally excluded from the area for which we were applying for a Mining Concession because of certain claims which had been set up by the Moen-et-Tujjar who was supposed to be ne tinder Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, working S.Wworking in German interests. We were, however, advised by our representative about 12 months ago that the Moen-ut- Tujjar’s influence had become very much weakened, if not altogether destroyed, as the result of his pro-German intrigues, and that therefore it might now be practicable to induce the Persian Government to agree to the inclusion in our Concession of the littoral and all the Gulf islands. In any case it would not appear to be advisable to allow the Moen-ut-Tujjar to re-establish his influence in Southern Persia because it would almost inevitably be used to continue the German intrigues which h a ve caused the Anglo-Persian oil Company and other British interests so much loss and trouble in these regions during recent years. As you a,re of course aware he has been working hand in glove with the firm of Wonckhaus 8c Co. and with the Hamburg American Line during the whole of this period and has neglected no opportunity to further their interests at the expense of British. Should these views be in accordance with the information before His Majesty’s Government the members of the Syndicate would be very much obliged if the Secretary of State can see his way to affording them the necessary support for the in clusion of the littoral and the islands in question in the Concession for which they have been negotiating since 1910* I have etc., (SD) CHAIRMAN.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic M ajesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required tor official use.] No. 184 PNIiBIA POLITICAL Decypher.

The opinions include those of Sir G. Barclay (27, 42), Mr. C. Greenway, Managing Director of the Oil Company (43), the Government of India (46), and Lord Curzon (Appendix IX.) In March last communications passed with the Russian Government, with the result that Russia agreed to the British Government applying for an option for the construction of the railway, provided that work was proceeded with only after a friendly exchange of views between the two Governments (52, App. vii.). The Persian Government on being addressed (53, App. viii.), returned an ambiguous reply (54), but Sir G. Barclay was informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his Government would be prepared to consider proposals from a British group for general railway construction (54, 55), and negotiations are now proceeding on the basis of His Majesty’s Government (as distinct from private parties) standing entirely aside (56).

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. W. 84168/17 of the 7th May, 1917, regarding the claim of the Persian Railways Syndicate, Limited, to a refund of the expenditure incurred by them in connection with the survey of the MOhammerah-Khannabad line, and the situation likely to arise in the event of the Persian Government refusing to comply with the Syndicate’s demand. With regard to the Syndicate’s claim, Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion tha-tjunless and until th, IBhamwr.h-nK^abad »■*«» » definitely dropped, there is no strong ground for the repayment to them of the money which they have already sunk in the project. At the same time, he would see no objection to the request being placedplaced before the Persian Government for their favourable consideration. Mr. Chamberlain finds it difficult, in the present state of uncertainty as to future conditions in Persia and Mesopotamia, to offer any useful opinion on the general question. But he takes the opportunity of repeating the suggestion made in Sir A. Hirtzel’s letter of the 5th March last, No. P. 905, that the proposed interdepartmental Committee on Railways in Persia should meet at as early a date as possible, with a view to formulating some definite line of policy on the whole subject.Ill any further communication ' 'V &gt; and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

It appears to Lord Robert Cecil not improbable that the Persian Government will refuse at present to entertain this demand of the Syndicate, and in this contingency the question must needs arise whether His Majesty's Government can permit the Syndicate on this account to hold up the whole question of railway construction to Kerman.

An alternative to these conditions which suggests itself to the Syndicate as being possibly likely to facilitate the negotiations in the present uncertain position of the Trans-Persian Railway Syndicate’s proposals is the following:- (1) that the route for-the proposed Trans-Persian Railway shall not run east of a straight line drawn from BahE&amp;mabad to Bunder Abbas (excepting for the short branch line from Bahramabad to Kerman), nor west of a straight line drawn from Yezd to Lingah.

January 13th, 1917 With reference to isy letter of the 15th August last, relative to the Kerman lining Concession, I am directed by Mr. secretary Balfour to state that he has received a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reporting that certain icusalan groups are applying to the Persian Government for a concession for mining rights in northern Persia and for railway con cessions from iinzeli to Tehran and from Askabad to Meshed. 3ir C. Marling understands that in order to safeguard the contemplated rights of the Trans-Persian Bailway syndicate, the Russian groups applying for these mining concessions would give an undertaking to the Russian Govern ment that they will leave to the syndicate the mining rights for thirty kilometres on eithe: side of the future line, and he suggests that the moment has now come for proceeding with the Kerman Mining concession on similar terms. I am to enquire, therefore, whether in these circumstances your Syndicate would desire Sir C. Marling now to press your application upon The Chairman, Kerman Mining syndicate, Winchester House, Old Broad street B.C/ v k^. C. l(o 1 / KERLIAU MINING CQIin^^RTOTI , 1, This is a project of the Persian Railways Syndicate, Mr* % Greenway being the moving spirit* Though there is a 'Persian Mining Syndicate' it appears to be identical with the Railways Syndicate, many of whose projects in Southern Persia are connected with the mining area* This ares, ia a rough square; the north side being a line due west from Abadeh to the 60th parallel, which forms the east side; the west is due south from Abadeh just east of Shiraz; the south side follows the coast line some 30-40 miles inland* Thus the area is clear of the Russian sphere (on which point Russia insisted), and lies to quite half its extent in the neutral zone, and is cut off from the sea* 2* The concession which the Syndicate aims at is one drawn up in 1910 by Mr. Preace for Mrl Tarbett Flaming. It provides for the exploitation of all minerals in the specified area, for the construction of the necessary tramways, buildings and works; the construction of quays etc., on 2 points on the Gulf to be connected up by tramways with the mines. The right to buy land for the above operations; freedom from all imposts except a royalty to the Russian Government of 105o on all net profits* The concession to run for 60 years. On the conclusion of this period and that of the Railway concession the Syndicate will advance £100,000 to Persia* 3. The Persian Government has a counter-draft, the main differences being - 20 years period for research, 60 for working the concession: The exception of precious metals and stones, petroleum and naphtha, lime and building stones* A control over building plans and a limitation of each working area. 1 C$&gt; share in the capital plus 0 ?o royalty on all subsidiary companies e.g. for tramways etc., £30,000 to be deposited and paid over on signature of the concession; £7,500 forfeit if a working companycompany is not formed within ten years* 4. Mr* G-reenway wants Mr. Preece's draft accepted, and in %this the Foreign Office support him. Failing it, he will negotiate on the Persian counter-draft, if it is amended to include the use of building stone, to exclude restriction of each working area, and Persian control over building plans. Mr. Greenway agrees to a forfeitable deposit of £7,500 which would be increased to £30,000 and paid, on signature of the concession. He would prefer to keep Persian capital out, but would in the last event accept 10% share in capital and 0% royalty. 5. Negotiations proceeded on these lines. In June, 1913, however, the Russian Government intervened on behalf of the Soci£t4 d* E’tude, (the international syndicate created to examine the trans-Persian railway project,)pointing out that the concession area is that through which trans-Persian Railway would run, that all Railway concessions in the east include the mining rights on each side and that without these the Railway 1 s success would be threatened. It suggested reciprocal grant of facilities in Russian and British spheres, and equal division of interest in the neutral zone. 6 . Mr. Greenway objects to the intrusion of the Soci6t£, pointing out that the grant of the concession was to be a condition of the Syndicate’s acceptance of the option for the Moharanerah-Khorremabad Railway; that tne £100,000 his Syndicate is to advance on conclusion of tne two concessions, was in - return for a mining monopoly in the specified area. He points out that he was first on the spot, and had practically concluded the affair with Shuster in 1911. In spite of this, he is willing,if His Majesty’s Government presses it, to consider the admittance of the Soei&lt;§t&lt;§ to a 3 share in the enterprise, so far as the neutral zone is concerned.

As a favourable opportunity recently presented itself for a short visit to Transcaspia I proceeded thither cid Tabadkuh, Amirabad, Karatigan, Khwaja Bolan and Dushakh in view of the reputed scheme for the construction of a railway to Meshed by this route. (Reference—Captain Blair’s notes forwarded with M. A.’s despatch of 20th January 1913 and route sketch accompanying it.) RaiLcay construction scheme in North-East Persia. —As far back as j 1912 a line from Dushakh to Meshed was mooted and Russian engineers carried out a preliminary survey. The war no doubt caused this to fall into abeyance but during the current year, as reported in Meshed Diaries and Intelligence Summaries, 2 engineers have been carrying out investigations in the North-East corner of Persia, as far south as Kariz, and by the Sabzawar road to Astrabad. They have just returned to Russia and although consi derable secrecy is observed, from several sources it appears fairly certain that they are prepared to recommend the construction (a) of a line from Dushakh to Meshed rid Chacha, the valley of the Ab-i-Garm, and Tabadkuh. (It is evident that this alignment will involve the tunnelling of the mountain range over which passes the track between Tkbadkuh and Amirabad, and on my way I was unable to see any deviation by which this expense could be avoided. I have since heard that the tunnel has been considered practicable and that early steps towards its realisation are probable.) (6) of a line from Bandar Gaz through Astrabad and Sabzawar to Meshed. It is apparently considered that the exploitation of the Mazandaran forests will repay the outlay on this. No information is available as to when this second scheme will he seriously consi dered. 2. Prom Dushakh I proceeded by rail to Askhabad and Krasnovodsk, returning to Askhabad and thence to Meshed. Little activity was to be noted along the C. A. line and considerably less than the normal amount of rolling stock was seen. Operations against the Although not apprehending any serious trouble the Governor of Krasnovodsk considered that the Turkoman unrest in the Atrek region would take some time to suppress, and that no good result could be expected until the disaffected tribesmen had received severe castigation. The force in that region, now commanded by General Volkovnikov, has been increased by half of the 20th Horse Mountain Battery, and it is expected that a Cossack Regiment—either Pri-Amursk or Ural—will be added. If this is carried out it is probable that the portion of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks in that region will return to Khorasan. The Turkoman giving the most trouble are certain sections of the Yomut living on the Russo-Persian frontier which they cross whenever they have offend ed one or other Government. They are elusive and are continually carrying out small raids, firing on Cossack patrols, and carrying on a species of partisan warfare. It is regretted that Colonel Gabaev did not carry out a more energetic pursuit after the affair at Ak Kala. The Kirghiz in the Krasnovodsk dis trict seem perfectly quiet. Askhabad and Merv Turkomans seen fairly well disposed, but towards the end of October—almost coinciding with the passage of General Kuropatkin—Turkomans made a determined attempt by night to destroy the Teien railway bridge. At the time there were very few troops on the spot but the bridge guard opened and sustained a rapid fire which apparently was successful in deceiving the Turkomans as to their strength. They withdrew with a loss of 16 killed, two Russians only having been wounded, but they succeeded in cutting the railway telegraph line and in burning a small wooden bridge. Troops were sent from Askhabad and the locality is more strongly held. The Russian see the finger of the German agent in this as they say that the cutting of the telegraph and the interruption of the line INDIA r Letter. Dated ■ pecEiv Ho. 4 11 12 JAM 1917 2 FEB 1917would never have occurred to the Turkomans unaided. The Russian Customs officials scattered along the frontier with small detachments of Frontier Guards are living in considerable anxiety at the present time. 3 Turkistan garrisons.—1 was unable to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the total of Russian troops in Turkistan at the present moment and was informed that it was difficult for the staff to determine at any given moment as the numbers are continually changing. I should, imagine, however, that there must be at least 30,000 exclusive of Semirechia. General Narbut in formed me that the approximate principal frontier garrisons were as follows : — Askhabad . Kushk Reiki Termez 3.000 4.000 2.000 3 000 They are all militia (“ drujiny ” ) and guns are of old pattern. They are by this time fairly well trained and the majority of the men I saw about did not appear inferior in physique to the average Russian soldier. According ^ to General Narbut, General Kuropatkin is satisfied with the internal situation and it appears probable that the Russians have sufficient military strength immediately available to suppress promptly any local rising. There appears to be no undue anxiety with regard to the Afghan attitude although their measures are carefully watcned. General Narbut stated that with the small number of troops in the country a hostile movement on the part of the Afghans would seriously embarrass them at first, but that large reserves could be sent in at comparatively short notice. 4. Local supply resources. —Partly, I imagine, owing to faulty organisa tion, and partly to the depression of the ruble, some difficulty is experienced in obtaining food and other supplies for the population although no distress seems apparent. Quantities purchasable by individuals are strictly limited by the authorities, white flour is unobtainable, and it is possible that there will be a difficulty about fuel as the winter becomes more severe. A local committee of merchants has been formed to obtain and regulate the^ sale of ^ sugar and various supplies and groceries. Butter of a most inferior quality costs 3 rubles a pound and is only to be had in small quantities; potatoes are un obtainable. Forage, vegetables, etc., could be imported from Persia in sufficient quantities, but owing to the depression of the ruble and the tariff fixed by the Transcaspian authorities, the Persian importer can only sell at Askhabad at a heavy loss. Generally speaking, however, the inhabitants are no worse off possibly better—than in many parts of Russia. 5. Railway construction .—In the short time available I was unsuccessful in obtaining any information of interest regarding the construction of local lines. As far as I can ascertain the Semirechia line has been completed to Aulieata and the track prepared as far as Pishpek, but work on this section is delayed for want of rails. Presumably the unrest in Semirechia has put an end to any work on the line for the present. There seems no reason, however, why Austrian prisoners should not be utilised a little later for this work as they were for the Kaghan-Termez line. 6. The majority of prisoners have been sent from Transcaspia to Turkistan. I saw none at all at Krasnovodsk and very few at Askhabad. Those seen were carefully guarded. I called on Colonel Tsvietkov to ascertain if he had been able to complete the translation of Chaush’s Diary which I sent him some weeks ago. He informed me that all Hungarians having been sent to Tash kent, he had sent the document there for translation. 7. General Narbut, who in addition to his duties as Officer Commanding the Askhabad garrison, is in command of the 7th Frontier Guard District, has kindly furnished me with their latest information as to the khasadar posts on the northern Afghan frontier, a translation of which I append.

JOT'iiUU. V. 'u hvA r&lt;,Tir r j^y k'Ui'f &lt;Wi** !/k Hi. The totah length of the line on the route recommended by •'A Sir W.Johns is 437 mile?. The route is said to be fairly easy as far as the Gishu Kotal 228 miles' from Bunder Abbas and the r ' line could probably be made as farr as this in about a year. The works at the Gishu Kotal are heavy and Sir W.Johns estimates that they would take about two years. The rest of the line on to Kerman would be mostly a sur face track with dips at the larger streams^and could probably be completed by the time the Gishu Kotal was ready. j The total cost of the line is estimated at Rs 380 lakhs (see P.22 Vol.lll) or Rs 67,000 per mile. The ruling gradients are heavy: First section.Bunder Abbas to hinab - 62 miles - flat Second 0 Third Fourth to Masitabad Krsitabad to Bam Barn to German - 131 11 - 132 n - 112 H - rul.mrad.l in 66 for 10 miles. - rul.grad.1 in 50 for 50 miles. - rul.grao.l in 70 for 40 miles. These gradients are taken from point to point, th heights of which were estimated by Baiters trie readings only f and are thus very liable to error. All that one can bdreally justified in saying is that, a line can probably be obtained from Linab to Ke rr.nan with a ru 1 irg; gr ad lent of 1 in 50 / and that it is possible that a flatter ruling: gradient can be obtained by development. The il Ry. on the Inc Frontier has a ruling gradient of 1 in 50, aid the total working expenses in 1914-15 amounted to Rs'64 per.mile per week^with an average traffic of 1.7 trains per day in each direction The gross earnings per train were 2.aT Rs A. i: working expenses 11 H 1: 2.60 :i showing a les per train-mile of 6.15* Rs.strueted 2’6' gauge railways. It has a strong Permanent : ay (50 lbs rails) and specially heavy engines^ and the average train load (214 passengers or 55 tons of goods/in second half of 1914-15) is very high for a 2’6 si gauge line on a heavy ruling gradient. In spite of this it is worked at a loss, which goes to show that it is an extremely difficult thing to avoid a loss in working a 2’6“ gauge line on a steep gradient, unless the traffic is such as to be able to stand heavy rates and fares, as in the case of the Darjeeling him. or K.S.Ry. The explanation of this lies in the fact that the train load is so restricted by the weight and power of-/the. u Engine land by the gradient, as to make it difficult to load, tne trainssufficientiy to make trie receipts per train-mile grw'i a- exceed the working expenses. It is therefore exceedingly doubtful whether a 2’6' gauge line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman would ever ce a profitable commercial proposition,no matter to what extent the traffic developed. If the line were built on the metre gauge it would have a much better prospect of piying a dividend. Ouner things being eaual it is of course possible to build a more powerful engine on a metre gauge, an engine which coulo naul a paying load on a 1 in 50 gradient. On whichever gauge trie line is built^it would pro bably have to be worked at a loss lor a considerable time to come, and the propects of filling even one train per day \ ould seem to be rather remote. On the other hand Sir f.Johns says that the inhabit- of the country are industrious and highly intelligent antsand he thinks 'onere is no reason why high class cotton should not be grown in Persia (p27 vollll). Thereare also possibili ties in the way of minerals (Sir ■ .Johns mentions coal, mangan ese, and asbestoB, see p.l? vol.l) but there appears to be nothing definitely known about them beyond the fact of their existence. It goes without saying that the existence of a staple commodity such as cotton or minerals in sufficient quantity would insure tie fortunes of the railway, but there is nothing; of the kind, in existence at present,and it is of course doubt- ful whether any hopes in this connection are likely to materialize; If a railway is to be built there would' seem to be three courses open:- (a) to build a cheap 2 , 6‘ l gauge line and make up one’s mind to work it at a loss for the sake of the political objects attained. (b) to build a mettffc gauge line,with heavy permanent ' and rolling stocky and trust that the traffic will ultimately become sufficient to make the line pay or (c) to construct the line, as regards fdrmation f curves f etc. as if &amp; were for a, met-iK? gauge, and tnen lay a cheap lignt 2’6' gauge line on the formation,and convert to a heavy mete® gauge •when the traffic justifies it. Since the propects of heavy traffic are hopeful but somewhat remote I would venture to recommend, al u8j. native^) • In this note the Bunder Abbas-Kerman railway has been considered solely as a local commercial line, ana without * ■ any reference to the possibility oi the wiiole or part o± it- 4 - forming part of a through connection between Europe &amp; India.

C. 153. This Document is the property of the Secretar y of State for India. SECRET. BUNDER ABBAS-KERMAN RAILWAY. Memorandum by Lord Curzon. 1. I have purposely kept back these papers for a little, because, just as I was beginning to note, there came along a file with a Nushki-Seistan Railway scheme, and it seemed desirable to place the two projects in relation to each other, though each can fairly be considered on its own merits. 2. The war seems likely to have two results in the Middle East:—(1) the supersession of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 by some new arrangement, more in consonance with British interests and with the needs of the time ; (2) the enlargement of the British sphere, as hitherto defined, by the inclusion in it, whether formal or informal, of much of the present neutral zone. Any such rearrangement will amount to partition in a veiled form, and, whatever we do, it will be interpreted by Russia as giving her a right to consolidate her influence in the Russian sphere in a manner that will fall little short of a Protectorate. One of the instruments of this policy will be the construction of a number of railways in the North, designed in the political, commercial, and strategical interest of Russia, and intended to rivet her hold upon the Northern Provinces, (a) I believe that a Russian railway has already been opened to Tabriz ; (/&gt;) a line from Baku via Resht to Teheran will follow, and has already been applied for ; _ (c) railway connection will be established (from Askabad or elsewhere) with Meshed. Of these schemes the second is the most important. We cannot stop it, though I hope we shall not find any part of the money or treat it as part of a Trans-Persian scheme—a project to which I trust that we shall give less countenance than we did before the war. ... . 3. Railway communication between Europe and India is likely in the long run to come. But what will be, or ought to be, the geographical line adopted is still uncertain. It may be via Persia, it may ultimately be through Afghanistan ; whichever it be, w T e ought not, in my opinion, to go out of our way to encourage the connection. It can add nothing to the advantages, and may add a .great deal to the risk of our position in India. The Trans-Persian schemeAvith which the late Government coquetted, and. to which they went perilously near to committing His Majesty’s Government^ is for the time being in abeyance. I trust that nothing may be done from this end to revive it. When the Russians have consolidated their political and military position in Northern Persia, they will want to push railways from Teheran to Ispahan, and from Teheran to Yezd or even Kerman. But that will not be for many years, and in the meantime we should, m my judgment, abstain from compromising ourselves on these larger and spBcUativ^iasues.^ ^ ^ ving for a Bmider Abbas-Kerman railway falls into a different category and is recommended in these papers as a form of iepl., to a proposed Russian concession in the North. It should be looked at from severa ^ po^ to gatller from the papers vvhat has happened to the Mohammera-Khoremabad project, which has hitherto held the field as the British reply in the South to any Russian railroad advance in the North, but I infer that the surveys are held in abeyance because of the disturbed 8Ute d the co m,ry since the outbreak of war. I have never been very enthusiastic aboutkhis railway, because («) the en^rTIrsla i i (h) it seems to me to enter i ersia. it euters the mountains will oe giem, qv r . r i -p •, from the wrong direction, (c )it can only be effective or success! ul rf it forms a part of a scheme for bringing South-West Persia under lfe influence) a scheme which seems tome t0 q v0 Wlnchbkb.rtr l“n from the moment when Ispahan was most unhappily included the fa ssian sphere. S 322 50—8/162 6 On the other hand, if, as the result of the present war, we are to push onto and to hold Baghdad, and to consolidate our position in bouth-West Persia—in connection with the oil wells or for other reasons r then such a railway, or at any rate the earlier sections of it, may become inevitable, and it should not be dropped. T r n , n 7 These remarks are pertinent, because I see from Mr. Ureenway s letter that it is the same syndicate which has hitherto held the Mohammera concession that is now interested in the Bunder Abbas-Kerman project and that one of the conditions of proceeding with the latter is that the syndicate should be reimbursed the 100,00WTwhich they have already spent on surveys for the former. , g r ppjg seems to me a very unsatisfactory position , xoi yi) it indicates a lack of policy which is hardly to be admired; (2) it implies that we can only get one railway by dropping the other. Why should this be the case ? And if it be the case, surely there ought to be a careful balance ol the merits of the two before a decision m favour of one 01 the othei is ailived at. I can find no trace of such a discussion in these papers.. . 9. Passing to the Bunder Abbas-Kerman project on its own merits, I am not clear whether it is now advocated merely as a diplomatic rejoinder to a Russian concession from Baku to 1 eheran, or as a commercial proposition, or as a strategic move, intended in the last resort to bar the completion of a Turco-Persian line, either in the direction of Nushki or to some Gulf port to the east of Bunder Abbas, such as Ohahbar. 10. If it is put forward merely as a diplomatic rejoinder not intended to materialise at the present time, it is obviously only a piece of make-believe, with no value except the latent rights of revival which might be inherent m it, and which might have a positive value one day in the future. 11. If, on the other hand, the line possesses a commercial value such as will justify its construction as a business proposition, this ought to be demonstrated by the figures of trade. I cannot recall having seen it done. Moreover, its commercial effect has to be considered upon a possible future extension of the Nushki Railway beyond Dalbandin, for both lines would then be competing for the trade of East Persia and Khorasan, with a probable decided advantage (owing to the existence of a maritime base at Bunder Abbas) to the Kerman line. 12. If, thirdly, the line is to be viewed strategically, it possesses the unquestionable advantage of diverting the Russian spearhead (i.e., the Teheran-Yezd-Kerman railway of the future) at a spot where it would be pointed straight towards India, and twisting it round in a direction where the prolongation would be under British control, and in the last resort, at Bunder Abbas, under the guns of the British Fleet From this point of view it might be an advantage to Great Britain to anticipate the future by the construction of such a line. 13. There is the secondary strategical advantage, assuming the entire east of Persia to fall ultimately, as seems inevitable, under British protection, that we should be able to reinforce our position at Kerman by direct maritime connection with India. 14. These arguments may be held on the whole to justify a pursuance of the present proposal, though the prospect should not be lost sight of that when the Russian Government has carried, if it ever does carry, its trans-Persian line via Yezd to Kerman, resentment may be expressed at a maritime outlet so unconcerned with Russian ambitions or interests as Bunder Abbas, and pressure may be put upon the British Government of the day to agree to a more easterly prolongation from Kerman. 'Phis, however, relates to a future still remote, and belongs to the region of speculation. 15. I have said nothing about the financial aspect of the case, which is not even alluded to in these papers. How or with what resources, or subject to what guarantees, the railway would be constructed, if it is really proposed to construct it at all, has not been indicated. Curzon. 24th August 1916. Icopy.

PERSIAN RAILWAYS SYNDICATE, LIMITED, WINCHESTER HOUSE, OLD BROAD STREET, LONDON, E.C. July 28th, 1916. Sir With reference to your letter No. 124329/16 of the 11th instant and in continuation of mine of the 14th idem I beg to state that I have now consulted the Members of the Persian Railways Syndicate and of the Persian Mining Syndicate and arn desired to give the following replies to the two questions asked in the former, /*&gt; ( (1) Railway J^oncej isipn, The Board of the Railway Syndicate author ise me to say that they will he prepared to * undertake the survey and the building of a Rail way from Bunder Abbas to Kerman on the terms previously discussed, and practically arranged, with the Persian Government in respect of the Railway from Mohammerah to Khoramabad, subject to the Persian Government reimbursing them at once for the expenditure already incurred on the Mohammerah-Khoramabad survey. They would also like to have the informa tion asked for in the penultimaue paragraph of my letter of the 14th instant. (2) lp-n±np: The Members of the Mining Syndicate desire me to point out that the provision of a loan of £ 100,000 The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.i.100,000 was no part of the terms originally under dis cussion with the Persian Government and was only suggested at a late stage in the negotiations at a time when the Persian Government was in urgent need of funds; and that, inasmuch as other financial arrangements have now been made for Persia, they are of opinion that this stipula tion should not now be made as a condition of the grant ing of the Concession, particularly in view of the exist ing conditions of the Money Market. They also desire to point out that a special issue of this small amount of 5% Persian Government Bonds, on the same conditions as, and ranking next in priority to, those issued in 1911, might create a difficulty in the way of the other issue or issues of Bonds which will probably become necessary after the conclusion of the war in connection with any large scheme for the rehabilitation of Persian finances. In view of the above representations the Members of the Mining Syndicate venture to suggest that the. Mining Concession might be asked for on the basis of the terms already discussed and practically settled with the Persian Government, without the provisioh of the loan of £ 100 , 000 . If however the Secretary of State is of opinion that it would be unadvisable to adopt this course the Syndicate would be willing to provide the loan of £100,000 on the terms already indicated, subject to the condition that the money should not be payable until after the Syndicate has had an opportunity of satisfying itself as to the value of the mineral deposits supposed to exist in the area of the Concession by getting them inspected and reported upon, such inspection to be carried out as soon as the local conditions permit and in any case within the period of two years. TheThe reason for the latter stipulation is that the Members of the Syndicate have so far no knowledge as to whether or not the Concession is of any value at all, and before committing themselves to a payment for it of £20,000-£30,000 (the difference between the par and current values of the £100,000 of Bonds), over and above the large amount of money which has already been expended by the Syndicate im carrying on the negotiations during the past 6 years, and the further large sum which will need to be expended in exploratory work, they consider that they should, particularly in view of the fact that the Reports obtained by a previous Concessionaire (the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation Limited) were of anything but a promising nature, be first of all given an opportunity of sending out a Geological and Engineering expedition to report as to the prospects of working any of the supposed deposits remuneratively.

Q dt Bffbis Cedi’i /0 sir:- I am directed by Viscount Grey of Fallodon to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th , ultimo, relative to the proposed initiation of negotiations with the Persian Government with a view to obtaining a concession for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and for mining rights in the Kerman district. I am to inform you, In reply, that, since the date of my letter of the 11th ultimo, unforeseen events have occurred which have necessitated a temporary postponement of a decision in both these matters and I am to add that a further coKimmica- tion will be addressed to you so soon as events allow of a clearer estimation of the conditions and objects Miich it is desirable to obtain. With reference to the penultimate paragraph of your letter of the 14th ultimo, I am to state that His Majesty’s Government desire to obtain the concession for the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line in precedence to that for the Mohantnerah-Khoremabad Railway in view of the fact that the former dis trict is, in general, less disturbed than is the case « The Chairman, Persian Railway syndicate, Winchester House, Old Broad Street, E.C.rT his Document is the Property of 'His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless '■’i repaired for official use.] PEIvSlA ^1/iC (148266/16)o PCL ITIOA L.

Syndicate observe that loan of £100,000 was not part of the terns originally propounded and that a special issue to this small amount of 5% Persian Government bonds, ranking next in priority to those issued in 1911, may create difficulty in the way of other issues which will probably become necessary after the war. They would prefer, therefore, to apply for mining concession on the terms already discussed and to omit all reference to loan*. If, however, this appears to be an essential condition to their obtaining the concession they would agree provided that the money should not be payable until the Syndicate has satisfied itself as to the value of the mineral deposits in question, inspection of these deposits to be carried out so soon as local conditions permit and in any case no later than a period of two years. Do these terms provide reasonable basis for settlement and in view of large demands which may have to be made on the Persian Government in connection with proposals contained in your telegram No,474 of July 24th t is it still desirable now to press for mining concession?

Before replying definitively to the two questions contained in the penultimate paragraph of your letter I must consult with the Members of the two Syndicates and I am calling Meetings for this purpose at once. In the meantime, however, I may say that there is but little doubt that both questions will oe replied to affirmatively, subject to:— (1) the payment of £100,000 in respect of the Mining Concession being, as previously discussed, in the nature of a loan on the security of the same amount in 5 per cent. Persian Government Bonds, on the same conditions and ranking nest in priority to those issued in 1911.

I would add, for your own information, that we do not anticipate that the present comparative pliability of the Persian Government will suffer any marked change after the war, while we would prefer to wait until the future status of the territories througJ: which the line will pass, and of the trade regions which it will serve, can more clearly he foreseen, before proceeding further with a scheme of such extreme importance. T-OwQJUDraft Paper. Department. 'The U.S. of S. Foreign Office. India Office. 27 June 1916 IMMED IATE. \CV ib I am directed by the S. of S. for I. to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No.W.115698 of 21st June, and in reply to say that he agrees with Sir E. Grey that if the Russian Govt, desire to press for a concession for a railway from Baku to Tehran it will be difficult for H.M.G. to object; and that the opportunity should be taken to secure some corresponding &amp; substantial concession in the British sphere. Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion that in view of the value to Russia of a Russian railway to the capital, H.M.G. should expect nothing less than the grant of the Kerman Lining Concession, which has been so long under negotiation, together with a concession for a railway from Bunder- Abbas to Kerman. As regards, the latter he does hot fail to remember that in the later stages of the discussions on the Trans Persian Railway scheme, in 1913-14 it was insisted - h rightly, in his judgment-that railway con struction from the Russian frontier to Tehran and from the Gulf to the Russian sphere must proceed narijaasu But J1! . l But he apprehends that, since the Russian Govt, have themselves claimed the right to construct, or to share predominantly in the construction of a line from Kerman to Yezd the difficulty of inducing them to abandon the claim would be great, &amp; much time would probably be wasted. Moreover though a British line from Bunder-Abbas to Kerman would be less valuable than a line from Bunder- Abbas to Yezd, its importance was not only insisted on by the Imperial General Staff in its memo, of 18th Novr./13, but has since been conclusively demonstrated in connexion with the German incursion into eastern Persia. It is noted that the Russian proposal, though emanating from the Russian group of the Soci6te d’Etudes is not put forward as part of the Trans Persian Railway scheme. It would seem therefore, that H.M.G. are not under any obligation to entrust the Bunder- Abbas - Kerman Railv;ay to the British group - the less so, since that group (in Sir W.Garstin’s letter of 8th May 1914) were unable to accept the conditions laid down as essential by H.M.G., and expressly disclaimed interest in any scheme short of a Trans-Persian line. The way would therefore * hr* Go Af di-zl'u.)&gt; ^ therefore seem to be open for the Persian Railways Syndicate, who (Mr. Chamberlain would suggest) should be invited to apply for the concession. In the event of a pecuniary inducement to the Persian G-ovt. being necessary and of the Syndicate being unable to find it, it is for con sideratiohwhether should not come to its assistance. (S-) A.
