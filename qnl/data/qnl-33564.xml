It concerns Jaffer Ali Khan's mission to acquire a packet, but does not go into great detail. The Resident also explains that he has also refused to pay the cossid Esmael [Ismā’īl] for delivery of Jaffer Ali Khan's last letter, since he believes that he has taken too long to deliver it.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x0000ae#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
