Bruce states that he will comply with Keir's letters by joining the force off the Island of Khen [Qeys]. Bruce refers to Keir's letter of 2 February 1820, in which Keir directed that the vessels belonging to Rahma Bin Jauber [Rahma bin Jabir] should be destroyed. Bruce states that he has suggested to Captain William Walpole that he withhold from carrying out Keir's wishes until Keir has been informed that the vessels in question are now engaged in the service of His Royal Highness the Prince of Sheerauz [Shiraz]. Bruce reports that a copy of the General Treaty of Peace has been sent to Bahrain so that it can be signed both by Shaik Abdolla Bin Ahmed [Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah] and by his brother, according to Keir's wishes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000012#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
