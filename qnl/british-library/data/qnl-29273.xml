Datod tho 29th October 1943 I am vary glad indeed that Trego ar and Ualim, the Naval Intelligence Officer, were able to come and our discussion was certainly helpful. 2. There is, or should be, no difficulty about the locust operations provided we can avoid any question of boundary demarcation between Qwadur and Kalat State territory because the boundary has never been defined and both parties naturally have different versions. 3. I was surprised to hear from Tregear that he had not heard that the Muscat Government had given permission for Soviet aircraft operating under the auspices of the Royal Air Force to use the Gwadur landing ground and for Army troops to enter Gwadur territory in connection with the locust operations. The Sultan's consent was obtained by me on the 3rd September 1943 and submitted through the'usual channels' at once l 4. Regarding the Bo ache, I think Malira got all the informa tion he wanted. The Muscat State will co-operate in everything provided that they are not asked to do something which will lay them open to immediate retaliation e.g. arresting an enemy party with the submarine lying off shore. Their point of view is that the state is not at war but will give any facilities we require. 5. For instance, in the case quoted above, the Sultan if asked would give all facilities for conveying the information at once to the Navy or the Army and would then allow us to arrest the enemy 2 6 Major General N.G.

I explained to G.II that troops, aircraft, etc. using Gwadur territory should if they required any help or assistance report to the British Agent who would make all arrangements, thus avoiding incidents with State authorities. C dst Watching Reports. Both officers stated that wer 5. any reports w4re useful, no matter how unreliable or out of date at time of receipt. I said I would ensure they were sent in. 6. Muscat Coast Watching. (a) G.II stated that if it became essential for coast watching to be inaugurated on these coasts, Army signals would inevitably have to provide communications. He was interested to know that State had unassembled sets. (b) He asked if there would be any difficulty in obtaining permission for small posts of 2 or 3 personnel to be posted at intervals along coast. I said that small detachments without responsible persons in charge might be difficult but that I was sure there would be no difficulty in obtaining Sultan* s consent in principle and details could be arranged when required. (c) G.II said that patrols would be helpful and would probably be required. He emphasised that inauguration of any coast watching scheme had not yet been mooted, but it might arise in near future.

Copy, with copy of enclosure, forwarded with compliments to The Political Agent, Muscat ^ . R'V i with reference to his telegram No 5 ° dated 31st May, 1945,G ./ A D U R. Extent. The Gwadur District includes not only the town of that name and the coastal villages of Peshkan and 3ur but also the area knoim as Gwadur-i-Nigor and Jebel-i-liehdi and certainly the southern slopes, possibly the whole of the Koh-i-Dram range, not to mention one or two insignificant hills features to the west of Gwadur-i-Niger. It is not possible to estimate the area of the district as the boundaries have never been delineated and some difference of opinion is % known to exist on the exact extent of the area. Limits. If the question of the Gwadur boundary arose it is possible that the $ultan of Muscat would claim that the watershed of the Talar range from the Talar Pass in the east to Kandasu 1 in the west formed his northern frontier, a line drawn south from the Talar Pass passing close to Sarchib and following the Karwat torrent to its entrance into the sea as his eastern frontier, and a line running south-west from the Talar range to Gabd and from thence south south-easterly to meet the coast at Ganz as his western limit. It is probable that the Khan of Kalat would consider that the area belonging to the Sultan of Muscat was bound in the north by the Kbh-o-Dram watershed, in the east by a line from the Koh-i-Dram south to the mouth of the Drabello torrent and in the west by a line following the course of the Ankaro torrent from the Koh-i-Dram to the sea. In addition it is possible that a small isolated area bounded on the north by the Pheleiri torrent and running south to the coast to include the village of Peshkan would also be conceded as Muscat territory. The probable frontier and the one favoured by Captain Ross who was Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur for some years follows the course of the Bararabab torrent /fromfrom the sea north to the Kho-i-Dram and thence continues along the top of this range to the foot of the spur east of Gar-i-Koh and from there turns due south and passing west of Chatti strikes the coast three or four miles west of Has Peshkan. Physical Feature. The coast line is low and consists of sand dunes. The only conspicuous features are Has Sur at the eastern extremity of East Gwadur Bay, Gwadur Head a hammer headed rocky promontory some seven miles in length east and west, and about one and a half to two miles in depth north and south the highest point of which is Koh-i-3at.il an irregular mass of cliffs about four hundred and eighty feet high overlooking Gwadur town, and Has Peshkan a rocky headland. The Dram hills form part of the Kekran coast range They are barren uninviting looking hills, and the highest peaks are Barn (3,152), Dram (3,125), and Hukh (3,200).- At the base of this range lies the area known as Gwadur-i- Nigor or more often just the Nigor. The surface of this area a little distance from the foot hills is moderately flat and in extent the Nigor reaches down to within a mile or two of the coast in the easterly part of the Gwadur District while it seems to be bounded by the course of the Ankaro torrent in the west. The Nigor ^proper meets the Gwadur sands six miles north of Gwadur town and from thence westward these sands are two or three miles in depth. To lerok at, the Nigor is a moderately flat plain with numerous groups of large trees with here and there a cluster of tall date palms. The impression is received, from a distance, that it is a land of plenty and each group of trees shades a village. Closer acquaintance with the area shows how deveptive first impressions can be. There are no permanent dwellings in the whole area. In the shade of the groups of trees one or two small fields have been ploughedand a primitive form of dam or bank has been eonstructed to collect the rain water for all the agriculture in this area depends on rain either over the area itself or in the Dram hills from whence it is brought by numerous small torrents. There are no wells for purposes of cultivation and even the drinking water is brackish. The inhabitants live in rude temporary structures consisting of a wooden frame covered with palm leaf mats and move from place to place as cultivation is madd possible by rain or the grazing needs of their sheep and goats demand. The area contains no rivers; the Karwat, Barambab anc Ankaro are the most important hill torrents. The first two rise in the Dram range and passes through the Dram range while the Ankaro rises in the 3aijgrange to find its way across the western Niger into the sea through a large salt water creek twenty-three miles north-west of Gwadur town. 3ix miles north north-east of Gwadur town there is a small mud volcano. It is at sea level or only very little above and consists of a small pool of grey muddy water forty yards in circumference which is in continual movement. Occasionally it becomes active and the water is thrown up some distance into the air. There is no smell and little bubbling to be seen at the surface. There Is said to be another such volcano in East Gwadur Bay and periodical discolouration of the sea which is accompanied by the death of quantities of fish is put down to its activities. Hli-nate and A'ater Supply. The climate approximates to the climate of Karachi but has practically no rainfall during the summer and is consequently soraev/hat hotter than Karachi. In Spetember fans are unnecessary. Malaria is prevalent in the town but not to any great extent. In Gwadur town the water is brackish but near the Political Bungalow there is fresh water at a depth of ten feet. This water has no unpleasant flavour. The rainfall is light. / PopulationPo pulation . / I The total population of the area is about seven % thousand persons. Of these nearly five thousand are resident in Gwadur town, one thousand in Gwadur-i-Nigor, five hundred in Peshkan and four hundred in Gur. The figures according to communities are given in Appendix 'A'. I anufactnres. The on 1 y manufacture is salt which is sun dried in pans south of Gwadur town. The salt is used for local consumption and fish curing. There is a small salt tax. Gonir.iUnications. A motorable track runs from Gwadur town to Jiwani. fhe distance is about ninety miles and the time usually ■n taken is three and a half hours. Camel tracks run to 3ur and Peshkan and Jurbat and ^ other places in Kalat Gtate. The hiring price of a camel is Rupee one a day and the camel man's food to be provided by the hirer. It is usually found convenient to pay an extra eight annas a day per head and not have the trouble of feeding the men. Transport and indifferent trotting camels can be obtained within twenty-four hours from the Nigor. Administration. The iultan of Lius cat and Oman is represented by a -v Governor of the Gwadur area who resides in Gwadur town. He is assisted by a Deputy Governor at Peshkan and by two Kohdas or head men of the Baluchis living in Gwadur town. There is a Qadhi who hears civil cases and whose decisions are subject to the Governor's confirmation. The head man of the Nigor Baluchis receives Rs. 14 a month for advising the Governor in Nigor cases. The Governor's salary amounts to Rupees two hundred and fifty a month, the Deputy Governor and at Peshkan, an elderly Arab who has Married locally/^peaks proudly of his hundred or more descendants Rupees sixty a month and the two Kohdas Rupees ten each a month. The / Governor-5- Governor has a force of thirty Arab Askaries to help him main tain order. The majority of this force live in Gwadur town but a square stone built fort within a quarter of a mile of the Political Bungalow which commands all the approaches to the town has a garrison of ten men. Customs. There is an Amin of Customs who is assisted by a cli\eical establishment of four persons and who is subordinate to the Director of Customs at kuscat. He is responsible for the collection of all import duties and octroi. The octroi revenue is included in the Customs Revenue figures and the Customs revenue for 193S - 40 was Rs. 85,093 and the cost of maintenance of the establishment at Gwadur town and' the Customs clerk at Peshkan was in 1939 t40 Rs. 19,644. Gwadur Town. Gwadur town lies at the southern extremity of the » narrowest part of a narrow sandy promontory which terminates in Gwadur Head. It is a fortnightly port of call for ships of the British India Steam Navigation Company whose vessels anchor some four miles off shore in East Gwadur Bay. The population of the town are with very few exceptions all engaged in the fish trade. Fish and crustaceans of various sizes and kinds from prawns to sharks are plentiful and are caught both in nets and on hand lines. The catch is sold , morning and afternoon, after one tenth has been taken by the Customs officials as fish tax, to dealers from the tw^n who dry and salt the fish and after grading and sizing export it to Ceylon and the Far East. The grades, kinds and sizes are too numerous to mention, Indian shopkeepers supply the needs of the fishermen and merchants alike both in the way of food and clothes but also by stocking and selling cotton fibre for lines and nets, sail cloth, nails and the hundred and one things essential to people earning their living by and on the sea. Of recent years trade in dried fish has been very dull and consequently Gradur merchants / havei have suffered financially, lately however things have looked a little better and there is a hope of a return of prosperity. Small quantities of cotton and wool are also exported and the figures for all exports and imports for the year 1S39-40 are given in Appendix 'B'. The Post and Telegraph Sub Office is under the control of the Superintendent of Posts and Telegraphs at Hyderabad, Sind. The telegraph is a land line which is by no means reliable being often out of order. British Representative. There is a resident British Agent subordinate to the Political Agent and H.B.M*Consul at Muscat. The British Agent is a Magistrate of the 3rd Glass and hears minor criminal cases. Civil cases and major criminal cases are dealt with by the Political Agent who visits Gwadur periodically. The British Agent generally looks after the interests of the British Indian community and makes any representations in their interests that may be necessary to the Governor. Any question of major importance is referred by telegraph to the Political Agent at Muscat. 'The Aghakhani Khojas have a council and Mukhi or head man, and the Hindus have also a recognised leader of their community. YG. 00 O 00S&amp;fffiEX- No.H-33 (Camp) Karachi Dated 21st. June, 1945 From R.I. Hallows, Esquire, Political Agent, M_U_S_C_A_T. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. Subject: Gwadur - Kalat Boundary. Sir, In reply to your telegram No.1012, dated the 31st. May, 1945, I have the honour to give below my views on the proposal to restrict encroachments into Kalat territory from Gwadur outlined in letter No. 12-P1/45/S/1, dated the 12th. March, 1945, from the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department. 2. So far as Muscat is concerned, there seem to me to be a number of objections to attempting to arrive at a working arrangement on the lines suggested. In the first place, I think it unlikely that an ar rangement of this nature arrived at without the knowledge or consent of His Highness the Sultan would facilitate the settlement of boundary questions. His Highness would be as unlikely to accept unfavourable advice based on the proposed understanding, as he would be to accept any proposed boundary which did not coincide with his own claims. The position as regards the arrest and return of fugitive offenders would, I think, remain substantially as before. In the second place, it seems probable that in the course of time His Highness would deduce the existence of such an arrangement - a development which might well cause him to feel that the issue had been prejudged without due regard to his interests and lead him to intensify any efforts he may have been making to consolidate his position in the disputed area. A similar re action might also occur in Kalat with the result that a great deal of attention would be attracted to a dispute which is, at present, of com paratively minor importance. In such circumstances, the possibility can, for instance, be envisaged of the Kalat State authorities attempt ing overtly to extend the activities of their levy post at Suntsar up to the proposed boundary shown by the red pencil line on the map enclosed with the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General's letter referred to in paragraph 1 above. Any such development would be certain to produce a violent reaction in Muscat which would not abate until the Kalat Levies had discontinued their activities. 3. I have not commented on the question of principle which the pro posal for demarcation of the boundary for practical purposes appears to raise, as this is a matter for the consideration of the Government of India. In regard to the possibility, mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General's letter, of a tacit acceptance of the arrangement, my view is that the Sultan's claims will remain un altered until the matter is settled by a Boundary Commission. 4- It seems unlikely that, up to the present, His Highness has given any detailed attention to the question of his boundary with Kalat State and that, in general, he has preferred to leave his interests in this dispute, largelyon the hands of the Wall and his Minister for External Affairs. Happily the financial considerations which led to his suggestion of the sale of Gwadur are now absent^ and, as is evidenced by his recent request for an administrator, His Highness has begun to take considerable interest in Gwadur affairs. • In view of these altered circumstances there appears to be no objection to approaching His Highness at the pre sent time for a definite statement of his claims and for any documentary evidence he may possess to support them. Similar action has apparently already been taken in the case of Kalat and in this connection reference is invited to paragraph 4 of letter No.D.2511-N/39j dated the 19th. July,^ 1939, from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Exteriy'V^ Affairs Department• Once these claims together with the evidence on whidi they are based are known, it will be possible to form a clearer idea of the divergency in the view points of the two States. As was perhaps to be expected, Walls of Gwadur have taken the most extensive of the various un derstandings of the boundary as representing their jurisdiction and perusal of page 585 of the Persian Gulf Gazetteer Volume II, will show that this was considered by some to even exceed the area shown on the x map enclosed with the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan’s letter by the blue pencil line, and to extend to the vicinity of Gabd in the west. It is not unlikely that when faced with the necessity of supporting his case with evidence His Highness the Sultan will find it difficult to press such claims. 5. I have little information regarding the encroachments concerning w^ch the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan has expresses \ concern and nothing to show that the Muscat Government have gone beyond t most extensive of the boundaries described in the Gazetteer• Their objec tion to the construction of the route to Jiwani referred to in Governm nt^ of India telegram No.7907, dated the 6th. October, 1942, seems to have b£ . due to the difficulty of appreciating the exact alignment of the road from the maps available to them 'in Muscat, for, from previous correspondence it is clear that the Muscat Government make no claim to the Suntsar post. A clear statement of the boundary as understood by the Muscat Government would assist Political Officers in dealing with any such cases in the future and could be expected to end any fear of gradual infiltration. 6. There is a further aspect of this matter to which I would like to draw attention here.' Much of the bitterness now existing between the local authorities on both sides is attributable to the resentment felt by Sultan’s officials at Gwadur at the frequent reports of Muscat subjects being subjected to forced labour in Kalat. The British Agent at Gwadur receives large numbers of such complaints from camelmen returning from Tump and, from the statements he has recorded, there appears some truth in the general allegation that_ mels from Muscat caravans are not infrequently impounded for work for the Chir-^ of Makran. That this treatment is probably inflicted on Kalat, Persian t~nd Muscat Subjects alike is doubtless realised, but this does not serve to miti gate revengeful feelings in Muscat. If any action is possible to end th5.s forced labour much of the existing bitterness would be removed and with it the desire of the people of Gwadur to exaggerate frontier incidents so as to keep Kalat authority at as great a distance as possible. 7. To sum up I submit that so far as Muscat is concerned (a) it is unlikely that any practical value would be derived from attempting to arrive at a work ing arrangement which had not received the assent of the Ruler.(b) The present time is convenient for ascertaining the boundary claimed by Muscat and the extent to which their claim is supported by documentary evidence. This ap pears to be an essential preliminary to any interim arrangements for the set tlement of the boundary cases, (c) The avoidance of boundary incidents would be assisted by the suppression of forced labour in Kalat.

In view of the fact that there is a wide difference of opinion between the Muscat and Kalat authorities as to the boundary I am not in favour of laying down a ’’working' line such as that suggested by the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-Genera1, Resident and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan. As mentioned in paragraph 6 of Colonel Hay’s letter, such a line would not be acceptable either to the Sultan of Muscat or to the Khan of Kalat, and its adoption by political Officers in the Persian Gulf and in Baluchistan would be likely to lead to difficulties, particularly as reference to either or both State authorities would be unavoidable in any case of importance that might arise. 3. I agree that the question of the formal demarcation of the frontier should not be revived unless and until such demarcation becomes unavoidable for very strong reasons, such as the resumption of oil exploration.

The Government of India are of the opinion that the Agent to the G OV e.nor General’s proposal should be adopted as a working guide for the Political Officers on each side, as he suggests. There might even be advantage in letting the respective Rulers know that this was being done. Although the practice might be regarded technically as being without prejudice to any rights which might exist on either side, the development of 4 practice of observing a particular line would tend to stabilise the position and so to establish in the end an agreed boundary. Before however, deciding whether the respective Rulers should be informed of the adoption of the new practice the Government of India would be glad of your comments on the desirability of doing so.

I am unable to see that the adoption for practical purposes by the Political Officers concerned of the line proposed would lead to difficulties. ^he main purpose of my proposal was to suggest a line that might serve as a guide in considering the lengths to which they should go in pressing claims or protests put forward by the respective Rulers. ^t seems desirable that there should be the minimum conflict of opinion in such cases between the Political Officers, irrespective of the views of the States with which they are concerned. Jhe line which /I haveI have proposed lies between the boundaries claimed by Muscat and Kalat and shows no favour therefore to either. o ^ * 3. ' The instance quoted in para 2 of my letter No. 12/F1/45 of i2th March 1945 provides an example of the use which can be made of a '♦working boundary' accepted by the political authorities. In this case Kalat State have been advised to treat the murders as having been committed within their territory since there is no dispute as to the exact scene of the murder and it happens to be on the Kalat side of the working line. Had it been on the Muscat aide I should have adopted a different attitude. SECKBT No. 822-S. Persian Gulf Residency, Bushire, 5th October 1945.

In any case of importance which may occur in the future, in which Political Officers are to be guided by the new practice, it would appear that some explanation of the change in attitude towards disputes would have to be given to the Rulers concerned. On the Muscat side this would seem to be specially necessary as, in the past local authorities at Gwadur have adopted a somewhat belligerent at titude towards transgressions of their understanding of the boundary, often threatening to use force to deal with intruders. In order to prevent difficulties of this nature arising, it would seem desirable that the Rulers should be informed of the adoption of the new prac tice before any important case arises. 3. If this is accepted, it is suggested for consideration that the new procedure might, in the first instance, be put to the Rulers in the form of a suggestion for an interim arrangement to meet an obvious administrative need, rather than as a decision already taken. If the matter is put to the Sultan in the form of a decision, it is almost certain that his reaction would be unfavourable and possible that, in making a strong protest, he might reserve to himself the right to take any steps he considered necessary to protect his rights Further, it is possible that suspicion of an arrangement made with out reference to him, might affect his confidence in the Political Agent as his representative-to-be in any future boundary commission. The more gradual introduction to the idea of a working arrangement in the manner indicated would leave his amour-propre unimpaired and make easier the final introduction of the arrangement now decided upon.

Occasions requiring exercise of criminal jurisdiction in an area which is very sparsely populated are likely to be very infrequent.

I am not of opinion that the working arrangements proposed would be more advantageous than leaving matters as they are at present. It would be difficult to avoid disclosing to the two rulers concerned in any case of importance that may arise the existence of such an arrange ment and the Sultan of Muscat would certainly resent our having made it without reference to him. On the other hand, to inform him of it in advance would probably result in his pressing for recognition of the Muscat claim and reviving a question which is now, fortunately, dormant. Occasions requiring the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in this a r ® a » which is very sparsely populated, are likely to be very infrequent. 3. The Sultan h^s recently appointed Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy el Hashrai, ex-Indian Assistant at Bahrain, as Administrator at Gwadur. This appointment will, it is hoped, end any attempts at infiltration by Muscat, and will result in improved relations between officials on both sides. Sd. GEOFFREY PRIOR.

Although I have not yet received detailed reports on the incidents regarding which the poli tical Agent, Muscat, has complained I am afraid that the information he has received is largely correct and I am grateful to you for bringing it to my notice. It appears that a system of begar so far as the hiring of camels is concerned has existed in Mekran and that this is largely the fault of the Mekran Levy Corps who have insisted on the Kalat State authorities obtaining camels for them at the rate of -/14/- a day, which has been in force for many years and has never been revised in the light of present conditions. The Khan*s subjects have of course suffered as well as the Sultan of Muscats. 3. The State authorities have now been induced to pass an order forbidding the forcible hiring of camels throughout Kalat State and the rate of hire has been fixed at Rs.2/- for 20 miles, subject to a minimum of Rs.1/8/- for a journpy of 16 miles or less.t A, /V Telegram From To No. G.T.C.
