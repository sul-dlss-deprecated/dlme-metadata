If a reference is made to Mr. Fi tamaurice* s telegraphic report No . 10“0_ of 23rd March 1935 giving the approximate numbers of British Subjects it will be seen that he gave the numbers at 450. Sir Brie Teichman f s figure of 500 was 1 thinx obtained from me and at that time all reports from outlying districts had not been received. The intention of China (Kashgar) Order in Council 1920 was that British Subjects should be registered or re-registered annually. Owing to the suspicion and misrepresentation by the Chinese authorities annual registration except in the case of the British Missionaries in Urumchi was discontinued for some years before the rebellion. Please see report No. 115 a of Mar cl 31, 1932 on the operation of the China (Kashgar) Order in Council. Finding that during the disturbances many old reg is tratiop/registration papers had 'been lost and destroyed some times deliberately hy the members od temporary administrations I set about bringing the list od British Subjects up to date and did my best to provide them with up to date Be gist rat ion Papers, as those issued in the time od Sir George Macartney and other Consuls General were odten regarded with suspicion by the hew provincial Authorities. • The numbers on my lists completed in February this year comes to 605 but includes some B a jauris recently arrived who were in possession od papers drom India. I hoped that the possession od an up to date billet would provide additional security dor British Subjects. During the disturbances the knowledge that a person was a British Subject odten saved his lide, or exempted him drom dorcea labour or subscriptions. As however many persons, Turxis, ^dghans and others pretended to be British Subjects up to date Reg is tration Pape rs were essential. I have also received recent instructions drom the Government od India that they consider that the possession od a Registration Certificate in addition to the possession od a proper passport is desirable, and when in Yarxand recently, I began registration dor the current year. In all new or doubtful cases enquiries were made and id necessary referred to India before registration papers were issued. In spite of instructions received in 1955 that all descendants in the male line od the original British Indian Emigrants adindinitum who are born\ in Sinkiang wers automatioally British Subjects, tos far as registration v/as concernea 1 confined it to first and second generations.

This year 1 s report is remarkable for the increase in the number of British Subjects to whom Certificates of Registration were granted. A comparison with previous years shows that in 1931 three persons were registered as British Subjects, two in 1932, three in 1933, six in 1934 and 416 in 1935. It was stressed by Sir Eric Teichman in Report No.l of his Mission to Sinkiang that H.M.Consul General should claim to protect as British Subjects only those individuals who themselves had been born, or whose fathers had been born in a specified place in India, and that he should refrain from pressing the claims to British registration of men born in Sinkiang of whose Indian parentage there is no such documentary proof. It is therefore submitted that an enquiry might be made of the Government of India concerning the number of Registration Certificates that were apparently granted last year. 2*0 ■ ^*3^* v‘§ £&gt;odOV' SVvOpX*.

J- CLAUSON &amp;Extract from Report No. 5 on Sir E. Teichman’s mission to Smkiang. XXX 52. Another point, which struck me very forcibly during my visit to Sinkiang, is the desirability of our exercising a stricter control over British Indians m Chinese Turkestan. There are, I believe, only about 500 of these Indians registered as British subjects in His I/ajesty’s Consulate General at Kashgar. The present systen is that these men once registered are left to their own devices and are probably in many cases never heard of again unless and until they get into trouble with the Chinese Authorities. It would, I submit, be much better if every British Indian m Sinkiang were provided with a proper passoort, visa'ed by the local authorities for residence in the Province, and if it were compulsory for him to renew his consular registration annually. This is the system in force in the case of British subjects in the interior of China Proper, and its adoption m Sinkiang would, 1 am .sure, save much trouble and friction with the local authorities.* &amp; i.Z. 842/36. EXTRACT if’ROM REPORT/ ON ivESSION TO S1M.IANG, RATED XA^ROAil, DEGEMRER 4TE, 1935. 10. Registration of British Indians resident in Sinkiang. - This was a fight, with, on the face of things, a satisfactory outcome, since Mr. Ch'ea was eventually pinned down to the principle of two generations, which he was evidently out to challenge. I understand from His Majesty’s Consul-General that his latest instructions from the Government of India are also not very clear on this point, but I venture to suggest that it would be most unwise for us on our side to go back on the understanding which was, I believe, reached with the Chinese Government some ten or fifteen years ago that we would claim to protect in Sinkiang as British subjects only those Indians who had themselves come, or whose fathers had come, from India. It is true that according to the Chinese Nationality Law individuals of however remote a foreign descent, in the male line, are not Chinese citizens unless they or their ancestors have been naturalized as Chinese. But one must face the realities of the situation in Chinese Turkestan and the very delicate and difficult position arising from the continued existence of British extra-territorial rights in Sinkiang, where (as in the rest of China) a British Indian subject, but not a Russian or a German, is exempt from Chinese jurisdiction, even though he was born in the Province and mingles freely with the rest of the native Turki population; whereas in the neighbouring lands of Central Asia, e.g., in Russian Turkestan, Persia, or Afghanistan, he enjoys no such immunities. If this situation is to be preserved, the less it is emphasized the better. It will be noted/■ A. A 2. noted from the record of our discussions that Mr. Gh’en was fully alive to the theoretical position of British subjects in Chinese Turkestan, that is to say that they reside there in virtue of rights enjoyed under the cancelled Treaties between China and Tzarist Russia. I will revert to this matter in my later reports, but venture to emphasize here the importance of not stirring up these questions if we can avoid them.r.Z. 842/36 iiiXTHAGT i'HOM i^rOx-i. 1 ! 1 ' Oi'l MI881 ON TO 8IiUvlAi&gt;iG, DATED MAbriDAxt, DECEivxbEH 4TH 1935. 11. I take this opportunity of submitting, the following observations on the general question of the registration and protection of Britisn Indians in Chinese Turkestan,. If a serious attempt is now to be made to arrive at an agreed list of names with the Chinese Authorities and to settle disputed cases by means of Joint Enquiries, it seems very desirable, in such disputed cases, to produce as far as may be possible official documentary proof from India of an individual or his father having been born in a specified place in India and to refrain from pressing the claims to British registration of men born in Sinkiang of whose Indian parentage there is no such documentary proof. It would also, I think, be advantageous if some system could be introduced (as in the rest of China) by which all registered British Indians in Sinkiang were provided with passports in the prescribed form and their local consular registration annually renewed thereon. If the Chinese Authorities wished to viser these passports annually for residence in the interior of Sinkiang, there would seem to be no objection to such a requirement. I am aware that owing to local conditions, and to the fact that the Khotan area is still under rebel control, it might be difficult to introduce such a system in Chinese Turkestan at present. But if and when it is possible to introduce it, the advantages would, it seems to me, be very considerable, and cases such as that of Zarif Khan (see next paragraph) could not so easily arise. Moreover, even if the procedure for securing the/the privileges of British registration involved a certain amount of inconvenience and trouble for the individual, this would perhaps be no bad thing, since we have presumably no wish to drive into our fold such individuals who are permanently resident in Sinkiang and prefer to acquire Chinese and drop their British Indian nationality.Prom 4b* XED 9W)\Y W55 No .P .17O-X/36 • To ! 3 (j Csvy^o \^\'c S 1 The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Ilajesty’s Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London, S.W.l.

To J.G.Walton, Esquire, C.B. , M.C. , Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London. (With 2 spare copies.)Your letter P.Z. 1103/32 of the 22nd February about the Kashgar King f s Regulations, The Regulations were signed by your Secretary of State as well as by ours. As a general principle we do send all communications for Kashgar through the Government of India and we intend to continue to do so, but on this occasion we addressed Fitzmaurice by registered post via Gilgit direct as some urgency was thought to exist - indeed I think there was a general desire to get this complicated muddle put straight, and a tiresome question out of the way, as soon as possible. I am sorry that our despatch should have appeared to cast blame on your Department. This was certainly not our intention, for it is impossible to do anything of the kind when telephone messages are all that have passed, even if anyone wanted - as I am sure nobody does - to pass judgment. We in Far F.astem Department who act as the channel/ E.P. Donaldson, Esq.channel for communications about the subject which we quite frankly don’t understand, are prepared to take any 'blame' there may be, but really it is only a case of a misunderstanding on the telephone and it is neither the first, nor will it be the last, of such cases. Our chief wish was to absolve Fitzmaurice and to intimate to him that something had 'slipped up' between the Departments here. As regards future procedure, the responsible people here deprecate any change, unless it is an urgent matter. There are very few people who understand this business of King’s Regulations, and there is a danger that Regulations may not be drawn up in correct form and may not be legal, so it is preferable that we should see them in draft. Now Delhi’s letter in which they told Fitzmaurice that he was all right in issuing Regulations under the authority of Secretaries of State who had left office has I believe given rise to some forebodings! I gather that you are writing demi-officially to India and I do hope that we can all regard this question as being definitely settled at last.liiDIii QmOE, ■mikMLL, S. .• 1. 1103/52# 22nd February, 1932.

These two Hindus have openly admitted in Court thist they have been engaged in trading opium.
