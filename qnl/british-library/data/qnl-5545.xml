Skrine's emoluments while holding the post of Additional Counsellor. These are:- (axt . 4436 / 43 ) (art.393/45) pay as Second Class Resident Sterling Overseas pay Sumptuary allowance Fixed travelling allowance Rs. 3&gt;000 p.m. &lt;^3.o.o p.m. Rs. 400 p.m. Rs. 300 p.m. Rs. 400 p.m. from March 11th, 1946, to April 30th, 1946, while living in Tehran, from 1st May, 1946, while living outside Tehran up to the date he is supplied with a car at Government expense. The question of language pay was discussed in the case of Lt. Col. Macann, and appears to amount to Rs.100 p.m. Sir C. Skrine’s substantive pay is more than that of Col. Gastrell, but his sterling overseas pay is less, and he is not to receive Special fay. The proposal for an increased fixed travelling allov/ance seems reasonable in view of the fact that it is to cease once he has been supplied with a car at Government expense. (art. 4436 / 43 ) ollacjK.yUcr The Government of India have also telegraphed recomnending, after consultation with H.M. Ambassador, Tehran, that Col. Gastrell should be allowed a fixed travelling allowance of Rs.400 p.m. instead of Rs.250, and a sumptuary allowance of Rs.400 Tor the period of 17 months during which he held the appointment of Additional Counsellor. The amount involved would be £701 .10.0. (Bxt. 3532/46) The Foreign Office agreed in 1941 to bear half the cost of the emoluments of the Additional Counsellor, Tehran, as a charge on their Vote. There should be no difficulty in obtaining their agreement to the Government of India’s re cormenda t i ons for Sir C. Skrine* s emoluments. (Ext.7509/46) The question of Col. Gastrell* s restrospective allowances may prove more difficult however. In the somewhat similar case in 1944 of the Assistant Political Agent, Muscat, v/here the Government of India wished to increase the sx.&gt;ecial pay fromRs. 200 to Rs. 300 p.m. with retrospective effect from the creation of the post in 1942, the Treasury said that 'it is a cardinal principle in the administration of Imperial establishments that improvements in emoluments particularly when they are given in respect/ (Ext .4253/44 flagged on attached file)- 2 - /^ N respect of superior duties, should he given with effect from a current date only; we regard ante-dating as thoroughly ohjectionahle on grounds of principle ,, . In this particular case however, since the post was not wholly maintained by ,:xt they stretched a point and a ccxnpromise was reached, the increase being granted from the beginning of 1914 only. It seems probable that the Treasury may raise similar difficulties in this case, especially as Col. Gastrell has now vacated the post. It is for the Foreign Office to approach the Treasury, hov/ever, and a draft letter forwarding the G-overnment of India* s proposals for Sir C. Skrine’s emoluments as Additional Counsellor, and for additional alio.vances to Col. Gastrell while occupying the post, is submitted. fS i.

With regard to office and housing accommoda tion, with the best will in the world, we are not in a position to guarantee you satisfaction. To take the question of housing first as you know, it was the practice before the war for the whole Mission to move up to Gulhek in the summer and down again in the winter, and it would be unwise to assume that this arrangement will not be restored now that the war is over. Accommodation in both compounds is none too plentiful even for the normal staff of the Mission, and it is only too likely that there would be difficulty in providing suitable accommodation for an additional officer of the rank of counsellor. The actual making of/ E.P. Donaldson, Esq., India Office.* of housing arrangements naturally depends on the Ambassador, \ hut in view of the housing difficulty at Tehran,you may like to consider the possibility that a suitable house outside the compound, should be rented for the additional counsellor# 3# Office accommodation is even more difficult, since in the Tehran Embassy not only the additional but also the Oriental counsellor could well do with better accommodation; indeed the whole question of office accommodation for the Chancery needs consideration# On this point we fear that all we can do is to agree that if at any future date it should be possible to provide improved office accommodation at the Tehran Embassy, the needs of the additional counsellor would be borne in mind. 4. If you should decide to proceed with the appointment of Skrine to the post of additional counsellor we should regard'him as a very suitable choice for the post.(12/44) (6492) Wt. 18259—P241 25m. 7/45 G.S.St. Gp. 620 DEPTL.

Ex ernal Affairs Department, NEW DELHI. 'he 26th October, . We have been struck recentlv__by the importance of being adequately represented at Tehran. rj3e-fore your time in your present post there was a great deal of discussion on this subject coinciding with the period of the occupation of Persia in 1941« The leading document is'ELord Linlithgow’s telegram ' NO.2403-G of the -fce'p'Lember 1941 and you will find a considej^able amount of personal correspondence on the same stthjhsct.1 The idea at the time was that the Additional Counsellor for India should continually keep in view India’s interests in Persia and represent our point of view. The appointment was first held by Squire, who did excellently, but Pacann, who succeeded him, died shortly after taking over, and it is at present held by Gastrell. G-astrell has many qualities but we have considerable doubt here whether he is sufficiently heavy weight to fill so important a position in a country where we are so vitally interested and where we pay so much towards diplomatic and consular representation. After consulting the Viceroy, therefore, I wrote to Bullard to suggest an exchange between Skrine and G-as'trell. Skrine has energy, a wide knowledge of Persia and the weight of years, and in the Viceroy’s opinion would probably do well in Tehran. We sounded him tentatively on the suggestion when he was recently in Delhi and, as I think you know, he has just telegraphed to ask if it is being pursued. 2. Bullard’s reply is that if he were to remain in Tehran he would be very glad to have Skrine as Counsellor representing India. He expressed some doubt whether a man of Skrine’s energy would find sufficient to do in present circumstances; but there is much av/aiting a skilled hand in Persia and we feel the outcome would largely depend on the capacity of the officer himself. Bullard adds that'a wish'of ours to make‘.a posting of this kind would not be criticised by him unless there were the strongest objection, and he sees no such objection in this case. It has to be remembered of course that Bullard is about to retire but I should anticipate that whoever takes his place would find in Lkrine a wise and energetic assistant who would do much to help him appreciate the many and varied problems in this somewhat distracted■■ ■ &gt; country. Bullard^ appraisal of Skrine's capa incidentally was that he had put in three year admirable work in fleshed and that the whole Embassy thought well of him as also did the Persians. Bullard’s appraisal of Skrine’s capacity 3. The proposal was that Gastrell should then go to Meshed. This has now been made even easier in that Gastrell tells us that he wishes to take home leave early in 1946. This would make it possible for Smith, who is now acting ig^* Meshed, to stay on until Gastrell returns from England in tne- autumn of next year. 4. We suggest, therefore, that Skrine should be posted to Tehran as soon as he returns from leave, probably at the end of February next year. Skrine himself told us he welcomed* the idea but was anxious acout house and office accommoda tion to give him the necessary dignity to make his incumbency effective in Persian and other eyes. I have referred this point in some detail to Bullard, who is afraid there may be difficulties; but in any case it is a matter we shall have to leave to his successor as I understand Bullard is going at the end of the year. We should however value the support of the India Office in emphasising that the dignity and'prestige of India’s representative on the Embassy’s staff should be upheld to the greatest degree possible; he should in fact appear in Persian and. other eyes as a real Counsellor and not only as a Secretary. ^ ^ rvO * 5 . l^TOW^that India is to have Legations in the U.S.A. and ‘China it mTdr^nQt be long before there will be suggestions for parallel Leg^tt&gt;fi^in places like Tehran.

EPTHIBER. 1945. 8. I have been considering the adequate representation of India at Teheran. In 1941 we /'■ i ' were permitted to appoint an Additional Counsellor from India oo the Embassy Staff, and Squire, who is now Minister in Kabul, was selected to hold the post. Squire did very well, but the officer who succeeded him when he went to Kabul died shortly after taking over. The appointment is at present held by Gastrell who does not seem entirely adequate and, under my instructions, Caroe has suggested to the Ambassador that Skrine, now Consul General in Meshed, should relieve Gastrell. Skrine has great knowledge of Persia, and Bullard thinks highly of him. It is important that the Additional Counsellor should be given the same status, accommodation, etc, as the regular Embassy Staff of theteame standing, and I may later need your support about this. I understand that hitherto the Additional Counsellor has not been well done over house and office accommodation, and is regarded by the Persians as less important than regular members of the Staff.41* &lt;r;. 0 . 1? % PILE COPY DRAFT LETTER J.G-.

As a successor will have to be appointed, however, it might be as well to get the matter cleared up. I gather from Mr.Bewick that the whole thing turns on whether the emoluments of the Additional Counsellor at the Tehran Embassy do or do not include house rent allowance. It is clear from Ext.3AX and Ext.4436/43 that neither Squire nor Macann received this allowance. Squire lived at the summer legation at Gulhek and received travelling allowance to enable him to get in to Tehran (Ext.872/41 paragraph 5)* There is nothing on the file to show where Macann lived.

This request was put to the Viceroy in the Secretary of State's personal telegram No.734^ of April 13th.

Consul-General at Ahwaz; • ‘J (c) Lieut. Colonel Galloway, Political Adviser under P.A.I.C. The Viceroy's telegram was closely followed by a telegram from Sir R. Bullard No .434 of April 18th stating that he and Mr. Squire were agreed that 'the best man to succeed the latter was Lieut. Colonel Macann. Sir R. Bullard went on to suggest that Lieut. Colonel Macann* s successor at Ahwaz might be Lieut. Colonel Galloway whose recent illness, however, might make it impossible for him to stand the summer climate at that post# As Sir R. Bullard's telegram did not mention Mr. Skrine, the Foreign Office told him that the Viceroy had. offered this third choice and asked for his views.

He should be succeeded if possible by an Indian Political Officer of similar experience who could keep some control over our agricultural scheme there. Lt.-Col. Galloway, if he could be withdrawn from his present post of Political Adviser Paiforce, would be a good selection but he is at present recovering from dysentery and would probably be unable to stand the summar climate in Ahwaz.

In September 1941 approved isae proposal by the Viceroy that an officer of the Indian Political Service should be appointed Additional Counsellor at H.M. Legation, Tehran. In putting forward the proposal it v/as represented that the appointment 'would be a war measure and would serve a two-fold purpose (a) To ensure that the Government of India were kept promptly and fully informed of developments, or impending developments, in the Persian sphere likely to affect them politically or administratively, and wherever possible effectively consulted, and, conversely, in order that H.M. Minister might be kept apprised of the Indian view. In fact, according to the Viceroy, the Counsellor would be 'an outpost of India in Tehran'; (b) To relieve the Minister of much detailed work in regard to matters having an administrative element (and particularly those in which reliance must necessarily be placed on Indian resources), without derogating from his responsibility to il.M.G. ur\ iaar the conduct of relations with the Persian Government in regard to them. Under this heading it was considered that the Additional Counsellor might deal e.g. with the question of the degree to which the Persian administration could be utilized, and with administrative questions involving relations between the forces of occupation, the Persian authorities and the Russians, the maintenance of communications, and the supervision of certain services such as famine relief, security, etc. (Viceroy’s telegram No.2403/S of September 23rd, 1941 ? paragraphs 7(d) and 9*) was Mr. G.P. Squire, who had previoudy served as Revenue andji^tcia^. Commissioner, Baluchistan, and Consul-General at Meshed. He took up his duties at the end of October 1941. might be some opposition to his proposal from the Foreign Office. In the event, however, both the Foreign Office and Sir R. Bullard readilyaccepted L it, though they stipulated that the Cou nci lor should be responsible to the Minister forchis activities and must be regarded as an ordinary [ member of his staff; and that all official ^ communications with India from the Tehran Legation f should continue to be addressed to and be sent by pK.M. Minister. The Government of India accepted these stipulations, and v/e have every reason to believe that the arrangement has worked very smoothly. It may be surmised in fact that the establishment of this post has played an important part in the disappearance of the friction between the Government of India, H.M.G., and the Tehran Legation over Persian affairs which was so apparent in the summer of 1941* At the same time, however, owing to the removal of Persia from the sphere of the C.-in-C. India, and their preoccupations elsewhere, the Government of India's interest in Persia seems to have to some extent diminished. The Foreign Office letter below says that *r. Squire’s task 2 The officer 0 . 00 opted for this appointment 3« The Viceroy had anticipated that thereof ”advising on all matters relating to India” (by which they nresunably mean his general function of .maintaining liaison with the G-ovemment of India) ”is by no means a full time job”. 4* In these circumstances, Mr. Squire’s activities have lain principally in the administrative sphere described in paragraph l(b) above. For a time he acted as Director of the Public Relations Bureau attached to the Legation; but for the last year^nis main work has been to deal with the supply and distribution of foodstuffs, especially cereals. In this capacity he has organised the scheme whereby a number of Consular Liaison Officers are attached to H.M. Consulates in order to advise and encourage the local authorities responsible for food distribution, and to report to the Legation on local problems. For this purpose Mr. Squire has toured extensively; while in Tehran he lias been in close touch with the Persian Food Ministry and with Mr. Sheridan, their American adviser; with the Soviet Embassy; with the British and Persian authorities in control of transport; and with the British Military authorities, who have on occasion come to the rescue by lending wheat from their own stores for the Persian civil population. 5* Mr. Squire is now to be appointed H.M. Minister at Kabul, and in their letter below the Foreign Office tell us that Sir R. Bullard has asked that arrangements may be made for him to be succeeded as Additional Counsellor by another senior English member of the Indian Political Service. The Foreign Office point out that Mr. Squire was especially fitted to deal with the food problem owing to his revenue experience in India; and Sir R. Bullard has asked that his successor may be a man with similar experience. 6. The Foreign Office support Sir R. Bullard’s request. They recognise that the Government of India - who are finding it difficult owing to shortage of staff ; to fill all the posts on the normal cadre of the Indian Political Service - ma 3 r find it difficult to spare another good man; but they point out that Mr. Squire's work (*the context shows that they mean his work in connection with the food question) is ”of great importance to the Government of India, as well as to the war interests of the Allies as a whole”. Until recently the importance of this work to India lay in the fact that any shortage of wheat, etc., in Persia almost inevitably led to pressing requests to her neighbour to make up the deficiency; but now that India is herself faced with a food crisis, she lias ceased to be regarded as a possible source of supply. Nevertheless, there still remains her general interest in the maintenance of the material wellbeing of Persia and in the avoidance of conditions which might lead to political upheavals. 7 . The draft telegram below passes on to the Government of India the substance of the Foreign Office letter. It seems unnecessary for the Secretary of State to lend his support or to comment on the proposal, since all the relevant factors are well-known to the Government of India. 8. These papers are being submitted along with a submission on Collection No.29/104 about the Government of India's proposal that an Indian should be appointed as First Secretary at the Tehran Legation.V &amp; ^x:i;.17?6A3.

As you doubtless know, my Secretary of State has agreed to the proposal in your letter of the 16th March that Wylie should he released from his duties as H.M. Minister at Kabul in order to become Political Adviser in charge of relations with the Indian States, and that G.P, Squire should take his place at Kabul. In order to save time, a draft reply to the Viceroy was concerted orally between our two Departments, and has now been sent off. We are now taking steps to effect the necessary submission to The King. Bullard has been informed by telegram of the proposal, but was told that it would be better not to say anything to Squire himself at the present stage. In reply, Bullard expressed his satisfaction about Squire’s forthcoming promotion, which he felt was fully justified by his qualifications and his work at Tehran. In fact, Bullard thought Squire would make an admirable Minister at Kabul. But, Bullard added, his departure from Tehran will be a serious loss. Bullard therefore felt it neces sary to raise at once the question of filling the gap which his departure would leave in the Tehran Legation’s staff. Squire’s main work, (apart from advising on all matters relating to India, which is by no means a full time job), is to deal with the food question. Bullard originally chose him for this essential work in view of his/ E 1690/1213/34 3A | *1 \*i\o • Sir David T. Monteath, K.C.M.G., C.B., C.V.O. ! BKCb.

Bullard now requfests that, when Squire goes, arrange ments should if possible be made for him to be succeeded by another senior English member of the Indian Political Service with revenue experience. We realise that the Government of India may find it difficult to spare another good man; but the work which Squire has been doing so well is, I think, of great importance to the * * Government of India, as well as to the war interests of the Allies as a whole. It is clearly necessary in any case that the Legation should keep in the closest touch with all matters relating to Persian wheat production; and we shall have to find a man with the necessary qualifications to enable this work to be competently per formed. We therefore hope that you will agree to ask the Government of India to help us, if they possibly can, by providing an able Englishman from the Indian Political Service, with revenue experience, to handle this wheat problem at Tehran.. “b S'' cooy j CXT 360 FILE COPY 0 . £ 31 JAN 154.; ojlott- - ■ u (E 1^ 4/1 24^ 3^3 Tr easury Chambers, s.44610. 6th January, 1942.

We are interested to see from Bullard^s Ho. 843 Sept. 24th that he is thinking along the same lines and would suggest that subject to agreement on Counsellor from India 'being forthcoming our proposal should he actively pursued.(S) 6. I have again examined the whole of this matter in the closest detail in the light of Lyttelton 5 s views ( Wave11 with whom I hope you will he able to discuss will of course he able to supplement what 1 have been saying here as he participated) and of recent de^lopment in position. There is ( corrupt group) to be said in thewry for a delegation such as that proposed^ On the other hand I am very conscious of the difference which has been ( corrupt group) %o the situation by the active entry of Russia. Apart from that it is essential to preserve the constitutional position of the G-overnoivGenl* under the S. of 3. for India? and essential too that we should avoid possible unfortunate reactions on his position in India of the mistakes in the handling of Persian policy directed entirely or predominatingly by him- Finally I am ?;eli aware of attitude of) former as regards the responsibilities of an Indian Dominion if and when that stage is reached?in foreign sphere? and of objectaons to transferring to India at this stage whether in Persia? the Persian Gulf or other surrounding countries* responsibilities in sphere of external affairs which it might not be possible to allow her to retain as her constitutional development proceeds* and which equally? if they are once conceded, it would be very difficult to withdraw without giving rise to serious (? complaint)&lt;, Hor do I outlook (sic) the factor of personnel, which is one of as great importance here as it is from home point of view- 7, Conclusion I have reached in these circumstances is that it would not- be in best interests of handling of problem that I should , (? recommend) any marked transfer of control or any marked and ■^4rfirired,.1 1 iuti 1 1 ,i (o rr-t*readjustment of present method of handling this area. On the other hand it is in my judgment essential that arrangements now to b- made should ensure (a) that India should be kept fully informed of all business in Persian sphere; (b) that she should be kept •so informed direct ( X am grateful for steps that have already been (? taken) to tighten up procedure in this regard, and I have no doubt that if, as I trust, ILM.G* accept the suggestion in para. 8 of this telegram its adoption would further contribute to ensure that direct repetition covers messages y-?hich directly affect, or indeed are of interest to India, and (? exclude) s those which are not) (c) that we should be effectively consulted on all decisions of policy so far as circumstancee make that practicable. I quite recognise that there may be circumstances in which the urgency of decision may be so great that prior consultation would be impossible, I equally recognise that decision may?and no doubt frequently will, go against what we may recommend from here with our more limited horizon- But that is not the point. The point is that there must be a greater degree of consultation? and that without delay? than at present; (d) that arrangements should be made as a War measure ( and purely on that basis).for representation of India UhTtr! ttaii 6r'TehI'kli ± 'L l dguUUii, UUd 1 Uidf'ch representation should he by an officer of a sufficient standing to h| abie apesK with knowledge and experience, to express the views of ohe Govt o* India, and in those ways to assist the Minister generally and help him in reaching conclusions or in formulating recommendations on matters or ccncern from the Undian point of view. It is, in our judgement, ai ® c ? important that that officer (7 have also) authority to keep us* subject to the Ministers knowledge, in touch v/ith what is going on* to represent our uoint of view locally? and to ensure that we are consulted as may be necessary. What we are anxious to ensure is that he should be in a position to secure that India (V is) fully and promptly iniormed of aii strictly political devel-Cpments which are of interest or concern to her or are likely to entail obligations on her; and second, to secure, in association v/ith the Ministry Attach^ and under general control of the Minister, the due performance of aemi~politxcal and semi- administrative functions which folio?/:-* (a) continuance of the Persian administration, and adjusting of relations between the forces of occupation, the Persian authorities and Russian allies: (b) the securing and maintenance of facilities to which we are entitled under the settle ment. especially as regards communications: P T.Ch(3) (c) the undertaking that such supervision as is necessary of certain services e«g. famine relief ? security etc- 8„ (a) (h) and (c) are nearly all of them likely to involve India to a greater or less cfeegree in particular cases? and arguments on grounds of administrative necessity, quite apart from arguments on political grounds ( to which we attach the first importance) are in our judgment cogent- 9- As regards this last point I appreciate that arrangement we propose is novel in character and represents a modification of previous Foreign Office practice- But circumstances are quite special and, given India’s close connection with this problem and its reactions on uQ in the present circumstances, I feel no doubt that His Majesty’s G-ovt. and Foreign Office will appreciate reasons which lead us to advance it. I appreciate fully that Persians may put up some opposition* but to that I attach no importance. Persia is not in a position at moment to obstruct ue over this matter, and in my judgment any attempt at obstruction should be over-ridden without delay. From information now coming in it is obvioris how anxious Persia is to stand well with us as an insurance against tne Russians. Hew post should be appropriately additional post of Counsellor and I would ask your support in that proposal: while ( though I realise disadvantage that he has been, working under Legation for some time) I think the right man for it would jo Squire, now Consul General, Meshed, whom I would replace in that post Dy Skrine. New Counsellor would, as you will have gathered from my suggestions above, be in effect an outpost of India at Tehran, and our ^assumption would be that he would have fullest access to all correspondence, he brought into discussions, and haye the right to correspond direct with my Foreign Department ( subject of course to such comminication being seen by i* inis ter). No real difficulty ought in our view to arise over that, given goodwill on both sides. 10. It is of. course useless to erect top storey until and unless foundations are secure. It is in Persia itself that*'policy has to be implemented and no amount of organisation at top will be available without well laid arrangements in local field- As I see it the objectives in Persia itself will broadly be two (a) to see that Persian administration in occupied areas does not break down? and to adjust relations bety/een the forces of occupation, the Persian authorities and people and our Russian Allies. This may involve questions of security •and famine relief? (b) by arrangement with Persian authorities to secure and maintain the facilities, particularly in the matter of communications, which we have obtained under the settlement. In some cases, e.g. railways and ports* this will Involve a measure of direct admin i s tr at i on. Any such organisation will have to be in close touch both with His Majesty r s Legation ( owing to centralisation of Persian administration) and with Commanders in the field and much of its activity will be in the provinces. The fact that the Commander will not be located at the capital introduces special problems unlike those which have to be faced in Iraq. We are considering this problem in conjunction with General Staff and hope to telegraph our suggestions within a fdw days. xl.
