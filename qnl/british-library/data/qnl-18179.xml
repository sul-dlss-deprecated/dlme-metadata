Most letters are either followed by copies or extracts from earlier letters that were enclosed with them or, are followed by a cross-reference to other pages in the volume, to see the enclosures mentioned. The index at the front of the volume (folio 2), which continues at the back of the volume (folios 134-135) provides a chronological list of the contents, including their original page number.</extent><extent>Foliation: the contents are numbered 2 to 140, from the front to the back of the volume. The numbering is written in pencil on the recto, in the top right hand corner and encircled. Folios 42, 71, 87-133 and 136-140 are blank. The front cover of the volume and the inside back cover of the volume are unnumbered. This is the main numbering system and should be used for referencing this volume.Pagination: the contents were originally numbered 1-101, 103-167, from the front to the back of the volume. Pages 78-80 and 136-138 are blank. The number 102 has been omitted, resulting in an unnumbered page between pages 101 and 103. The numbering is written in ink in the top right or left corner of the recto and verso respectively. Unnumbered pages: the index at the front and back of the volume and the numerous blank pages towards the end of the volume.Condition: broken spine cover. Folio 26 and the unnumbered folio adjoining it have been stuck together at the corners. This does not obscure any text, since the inaccessible side of both folios is blank.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains copies of letters sent by Major Samuel Hennell, British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire, mainly to Arthur Malet, Secretary (later Chief Secretary) to the Government of Bombay in the Secret Department, at Bombay Castle.Their correspondence discusses events in the Persian Gulf between 1847 and 1849 and their significance for British foreign policy, relations and interests in the region.
