IU m. (b{., CksOUyvu^ ( (D Please refer to your telegram No.79 19th February, 1947 dated sals Officer arrive 2. The Disposals Officer arrived on the 7th and I contacted him. T did not find him very receptive of advice; but, as tactfully as I could, I made the following points: (i) that I did not wish priority to take procedure over price, but if more than one buyer bid the same figure T considered that goods should be allotted toChfcn in this order: Oil Company, Imperial Bank of Iran, local buyers, outsiders; (ii) that as much notice should be given to buyers, including the Oil Company, as possible; (iii) that lots should be kept as small as possible because big buyers were few in number and large lots would make it easy for them to form a ring; and (iv) that heavily leaded cable should not be sold here as it would only be used for bullets. He assured me that he had a good deal of experience of rings and that he could be safely left to deal with them. He also stated that the goods would be classified as fully as time and staff allowed, that tenders would be invited, that tenderers would be given a week in which to tender, and that this office would be informed and consulted when the goods had been classified and tenders were to be invited. He also volunteered to collect import duties from the buyers as had been done in Bahrain, if required to do so. I undertook to let him know what was required. 4. Yesterday morning - the 13th - the Reside ency Agent informed me that he had heard from the Lieut-Colonel A.C.Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E. , Confidential Political Agent, receipt, Bahrain. Jj'v 7- 2 - Fort that the vehicles were to be sold that day# He added that the Shaikh of Sharjah and Rashid of Dubai (who bought them all last time) wanted to see them. I was surprised as this was not in accordance with what Jones had told me. However, that morning I wrote to him about the customs duty (my letter No.286 attached A) and this brought him ho1&gt;-fodt round to the Agency to say that he would not collect duty at two different rates and'odemand arrogantly that one rate of 5^ be charged.His grounds for this were that the buyers would not understand the different rates and that he was too busy to calculate the duty at Z'fo and 12^. To satisfy him on the first point I had prepared typed notices in Arabic for the buyers explain ing the position, and on the second I said that I was complying with the Shaikh of Sharjah's request, that he was entitled to import duty on R,A.F.goods if sold to the public, and that he was bound by agreements with the neighbouring Shaikhs not to charge more than 2^ from their subjects, i got the impression that the difficulties ment ioned were not the real reason for Jones* objections. 5. T added that it would be most inconvenient for him, for the buyers, and for the R.A.F. if the Shaikh of Sharjah had to collect the duty himself because he would post his guards on the exits from the camp to collect it. He accepted this and promised also to show the vehicles for sale to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and to Rashid, who then followed him back to the Camp. There he tackled Shar jah and asked him why he could not take duty at a single rate of 5^. Sharjah gave him no encouragement, 6. Sharjah and Rashid then returned and complained that they were handled very rudely, were shown only vehicles, and were asked to bid above Rs.50,000/- fur 21 vehicles (one of them a motor-cycle and one a trailer) which are reported to be only shells from which all valuable parts have been^emoTTe d. They have lain in the open unused since the last sale, many with their engines open. They are valued locally at not more than Rs.20,000/- They complained that they had not been shown any spares. 7. Accordingly, I wrote my letter No.291 (attached B ) and got exhibit C in reply. T immediately wrote my letter No.294 (attached D). Jones did not answer this in writing but spoke to me in the Cinema (in spite of strenuous efforts on my part to avoid him so that he would have to write) and said that the spares had been sold with the vehicles to the same buyers for an additional Rs.20,000/-; that there were only ten tons of spares and that Rs.2,000/- per ton was a very good price for them. He added that the Shaikhs showed so little interest in the vehicles at Rs.50,000/- that he did not think it worthshowing them the spares. I said that I understood the spares were worth locally a good deal more than the vehicles; and that, had they been given the chance,local buyers might have bid more than Rs.70,000/- for both lots. 8. It is no good asking Tones for details of the spares because he has already impressed upon me that he is far too busy to make out schedules, and the R.A.F. have already refused to state what they have for sale (Exhibit E ). 9. The vehicles have been bought in one lot by Yusuf Ubaidly and Muhammad al Chirawi of Bahrain. They came down from Bahrain for this purpose. /h .Qopy* No.286.0430.

I appreciate that selling the spares with the vehicles is likely to get a better price for the latter 'but apparently it was not made clear to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai that they were invited to bid more than Rs.50,000/- for the vehicles and the spares together in one lot. They state that they were only shown the vehicles and not the spares, and were invited to bid for the former only. If the lot includes both spares and vehicles it is possible that they might like to bid more than Rs.50,000/-, and I would enquire urgently whether the sale has been finally concluded. It dis possible that the Oil Coy. P.D.(T.O.) Ltd., may like to bid, and I would enquire whether they have been notified of the sale. Sd.

Shaikh of Sharjah has forbidden UBAIDLI and his partner Mohammed Chirawi to export vehicles and spares from Sharjah. Disposals Officer made representations to me on behalf of UbaidlJ: and threatened to report to his head quarters that fair sale impossible here and that surplus stores should be shipped from Sharjah by R.A.F. for sale elsewhere. Sheikh says that he has no objection to the export of R.A.F. stores if sold to the public here provided that local buyers are given same opportunities as outsiders to inspect stores i N and to bid or tender for them in free competition with outsiders. He complains that vehicles and spares were sold in haste and secrecy to Bahrainis brought here by Disposals Officer and that highly relevant information about spares was withheld from him and Shaikh Rashid of Dubai. 3. In my view there should be no difficulty in getting good prices here if fair competition allowed. Sharjah would compete with Dubai, and both with Bahraini buyers 4.

It is reliably reported here that Tjbaidl^ was involved in R.A.F. inquiry into irregular disposal of sales in Bahrain last year, and was refused visa for United Kingdom. 6. It is rumoured that (a) vehicles have been sold for Rs.23,000 and not Rs.50,000 and for Rs.15,000 and not Rs.20,000 as reported to me by Disposals Officer; (b) that clothing and all other most saleable surplus stores have been sold to Ubaidli and partner together with vehicles and spares for total Rs.150,000 without tenders or bids being invited in competition; and (c) that remaining unsaleable stores will be offered to local buyers. 7.

A copy of a letter received from the Deputy Disposals Officer is enclosed for your perusal. 3. T had always understood that the Shaikhs were invited to bid over Rs.50,000/- for the vehicles because that sum had already been bid by another. I mentioned this in my letter No.291 of the 13th March to the Deputy Disposals Officer and he did not correct this impression in his reply to me of the same day. T always suspected that this was not the case, and the Deputy Disposals Officer has now admitted in paragraph 6 of the enclosure that they were sold for Rs.44,000/-. 4. Tn the same paragraph the Deputy Disposals Officer accuses the Shaikh of Sharjah of demanding three vehicles from the purchasers. Actually the original Bahraini purchasers offered him the vehicles and he refused them. He only permitted export when a Dubai merchant bought the vehicles from TTbaidli and secured their release. 5. The Deputv Disposals Officer appears to be going beyond his functions in deciding - vide para.3 of the onclosure - to withhod the customs duty which he offered to collect and, in respect of the vehicles only, actually at the rate of 12^ collected/from outsiders on behalf of the Shaikh. Certain other goods were, T understand, sold to outsiders; but the Deputy Disposals Officer collected customs duty at the rate of/-- 2 - of 2 P ! o only, T have twice asked the Deputy Disposals Officer to give me details of the sales made so that T can satisfy the Shaikh of Shar f 1ah if he later queries the amount of duty collected. So far T have not received the schedules, without knowing who has bought the goods the Shaikh is himself unable to collect the additional 10^ from outsiders while they are still here; and I fear this will later lead-to claims through us because the Deputy Disposals Officer originally offered to collect the duty and later confirmed that he would do so. Copies of my letters Nos. 308.0430 and 354.0450 dated the 16th and 24th Tarch respectively to the Deputy Disposals Officer and his replies are enclosed. It is requested that the question of the release of the duty collected on the vehicles may be taken up with Air Headquarters now. 6. To conclude 1 my own view of the affair is that the vehicles were sold to Muhammad al Chirawi of Bahrain acting on behalf of Yusuf Ubaidli - perhaps because the latter is suspect or has been blacklisted - before they were ever shown to the Shaikhs, who would not have been allowed to see them at all had I not specifically asked the Deputy Disposals Officer to show them to them when he called to protest on behalf of TJbaidli against a duty of 12^ to be collected from outsiders. HJverything possible was then done to discourage the Shaikhs from bidding in a sale that had, T believe, already been concluded. I should be the last to suggest that the Shaikh of Sharjah would not try to confine the sales to his own buyers if he could; but in this case competition from Dubai and Bahrain effectively prevented him from doing so. The restrictions on free bidding appear to me rather to have arisen from an arrangement between the Deputy Disposals Officer and the two buyers who accompanied him from Bahrain. IA a ^ Political Officer,Trueial Coast Sharjah./8 Copy of letter TTo.gHAR/l dated 22nd mrch 1947 from the British Stores 'Disposals Officer, Sharjah, to the Political officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. 1. T would refer you to our first neeting on the 8th March, ^hen T explained to you the procedure under which this dept # , intended to effect the sales of surplus R.A.F.stores. 2. During that neeting T raised with you the question of customs duties and pointed out to you that we would if necessary collect same on behalf of the local Sheikh. 3. On 15 March, I received from you a memorandum to the effect that a customs duty had been agreed, and the rates laid down by the Sheikh would be 2^ on all goods purchased by sub.lec-s of the Trucial Coast and 12^ on all goods purchased by persons not subjects. These rates were agreed and you had several letters printed advertising these details. 4. In spite of the foregoing the very first sale that was made on this station was disputed by the Sheikh, your letters Nos.291 and 294 refer. T would like to make it quite clear here that there was no question of the Sheikh's minister not seeing the spare parts. T arranged for the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Dubai to come to the station and view all goods for sale, but in the first instance they sent the Sheikh of Sharjah's representative who was personally conducted round all sites and viewed all stores for sale. The position of vehicles and spares was clearly explained to him and I requested that he brought the Sheikhs as soon as possible in order that T could get on with the sale, 5. When the Shaikhs came on the next day they only expressed interest in the vehicles and these they examined again. They asked me what price I was asking and T- 2 - informed them T v/anted. Hs # 50,000 for the lot - 21 vehicles. They quickly replied that the figure was too high as they had only paid Rs.1,000 each for the 55 vehicles they had bought at the last sale* X told them the spares v/ere a Separate lot, but would be sold to the buyer of the vehicles. They refused to offer more than Rs.1,000 per I vehicle and at this figure T refused to do business with them. The vehicles and the spares v/ere eventually sold as two separate lots to the merchants from Bahrein at Rs.44,000 for the vehicles, and the spares at Rs.20,000. % Tramediately the Sheikh heard this news he wrote to the Bahrein merchants threatening that action would be taken if they tried to remove the vehicles and spares from the station, and as you already know the Sheikh posted his guards outside the main gate to stop any goods being removed. This seemed a strange attitude to adopt after having agreed an export duty. At this stage I appealed to you, but ~he matter was finally straightened out by the Merchants themselves who met the Sheikh and agreed to give him free, three trucks and the necessary sparefe. Since this sale the sheikh has made further demands for sums of money from the Bahrein Merchants. 7. ■ 'Wery sale this week has been attended by the Sheikh s sons and his ministers, it has been very obvious to all concerned that the Sheikh^ minister has had the ruling bid on all sales. In other words he has made the price, and no one subject dare over bid. This of course in many cases has kept the price down to a minimum and has spoilt thfe element of competition. During one sale one of the Sheikh f s sons was found to have stolen nine clasp knives, but no action appears to have been taken by the minister. 8. The sales are now concluded and I have instructedhave instructed the 0.0. P.A.F., not to pay over to you for onward transmission to the Sheikh, the customs duty, until all the goods have been removed from the station and the various sites left tidy. Also I would point out that interference with the outside 'buyers will result in the 12^? customs duties being withheld. 9. My object in writing to you on the above is to place on record the true facts, and the position we find ourselves in, when trying to conduct sales in an orderly and business like manner. - 3 -Copy of memorpndum No,308.0430 dated 16th !Tarch,1947 from the Politics 1 Officer, Crucial Coast, Sharjah, to the Disposals Officer, HVA.F.Sharjah.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast (Gordon Noel Jackson), the Political Agent in Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway until March 1947, Cornelius James Pelly thereafter) and an unnamed British Stores Disposal Officer based at Sharjah. The complaints relate to allegations that the purchase of equipment was secured by two Bahraini merchants in agreement with the Disposal Officer, prior to Shaikh Sultan and others having the opportunity to bid. This in turn led to a dispute over the level of customs duty payable on the sold equipment, which would have to be released from Sharjah for transport to Bahrain. An example of a ‘British Disposal Mission Sales Voucher’, dated 8 April 1947, is included in the file (folio 29).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000bf#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
