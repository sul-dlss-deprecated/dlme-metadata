I should be grateful therefore if you would kindly let me know whether the approach to Northfield vide Commonwealth fc&lt;C. Relations Office telegram No 19, dated the 18th January has met with any success. 3* I imagine the main difficulty in finding a suitable candidate is the Sultan's insistence on a knowledge of Arabic. I am asking Stewart to speak to the Sultan when he returns to Muscat and see whether he cannot persuade him to modify his attitude on this point. ■Bf* i &gt; v\, v-'. r\\i \£ ••Infantry, arrived in the Gulf in October he brought with him a man who describes himself a£ Major P.T.Fforde of the Baluch Regiment. Pforde went to Muscat with Greenwood in October, stayed with him there for some months and eventually in January went with him to see the Sultan in Dhofar. 2. I have now had a letter from fforde to the effect that the Sultan has interviewed him with reference to the appointment of a 'civil administrative officer' and premised to let him have a decision regarding the appointment early in March. 5. Fforde is very young and the son of a Burmese mother and neither Stewart nor I consider him suitable for a responsible appointment under the Sultan in Muscat. Incidentally he never informed Stewart that he was a can didate for such an appointment. 4. All I can find about him in the Indian Army List is that he was given an emergency commission as a Second Lieutenant on the 16th April 1944. I should be very grateful for any information you may be able to obtain about his record in the Indian Army from the Military authorities.''as for at and to say that the Secretary of State sees no objection to the issue of His Majesty’s Exequatur.
