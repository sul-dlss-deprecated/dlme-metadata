An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-66; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled.Condition: folio 34, a photograph negative, has been damaged and as a result some of the image is missing.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file is comprised of notes, reports, memoranda, and correspondence received and compiled by George Nathaniel Curzon, on the subject of Persia. The file is largely concerned with possible routes for a proposed overland telegraph line between India and Europe.Also discussed is Russia's interest in Persia, in some handwritten notes (author unknown) entitled 'The Antidote to Russian Advance Toward Persia and Herat'.Notable correspondents include Arthur James Balfour (Lord Balfour), Prime Minister Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil (Lord Salisbury), and Charles Edward Pitman, Superintendent of Government Telegraphs, Bombay Division.In addition to correspondence, notes and reports, the file contains seven photograph negatives (ff 30-36), which may have originated from Curzon's travels in Persia. Three of the negatives are blank; the remaining four show images of figures, and in one negative, a landscape, although none of the images is very clear.Although the date range covers 1876-1892, most of the material dates from 1890-1891.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Edward Pitman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Arthur James Balfour</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>3rd Marquess of Salisbury Robert Arthur Talbot Cecil Gascoyne-</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Telegraph lines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a9#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a9#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
