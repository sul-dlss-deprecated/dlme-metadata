Sir, I have the honour to state that payment of bills for stores Durchasjd by you through the Indian Stores Depertmont is required to be made by the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, ard in no circumstsnces should such payments be made direct to the suppliers except when the value of the article purchased is less than Rel. You are simple required to pass through the Inspecting Office:, two copies of the bill accepted by you to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, who will raise a debit for the cost n f the supplies as well as the necessary departmental /Charges against this office. The object of th^s procedure is to ensure tTaat ^departmental charges due to the Indian Stores Department are duly realised fnd m that the* bills of suppliers are audited by the « Audit Officer, Irdian St^res. Department in accord- * # ance with the terms of the contract ,eto. entered into with the suppliers. 2. Instances have c^me t*o notice in which i the procedure indicated ab o ve has not beer strictly oA // '^bsefved and payments have been made by indenting ♦ « . officers direct*, eitflfer ou\of their imprS-st or ♦ ' by drawing contingent bills on treasuries supported by the suppl iors,bills. The non-observance of oha. prescribed procedure h?.s resulted in loss of departmental charges to the Indian Stores I)epartia#nt and it has been decided by the Auditor General in India that such charges should not be paid by this .office n r passed in audit Unless the debits for them are passed on through the exchange account by the Audit Officer 9 Indian Stores Department.

The Director General, Posts and Telegraphs, in his Memo dated the 24th January 1933 has intimated that the intention of the orders of the Government of India referred to above was that only those Telephone Operators who on or before the 8th July 1919, the date of issue of those orders had actually been given pensionary status should be allowed to retain that status. Any orders issued after 8th July 1919, purporting to confer pensionary status on Telephone Operators who did not actually possess such status on or before that date,were, therefore, ultra vires and should be cancelled. With a view to verify that no irregular payment on account of pension is being made to any Telephone Operator, retired during the period from 6th July 1919 onwards under the authority issued by the Deputy Acctt,General, Telegraphs(now defunct) I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know the names of the Telephone Operators,if any,who are drawing their pensions at present from the Treasuries under your control on the authori ties cf sanctions issued by the authorities noted in the margin.

The earlier publication of the Finance and Revenue Accounts involving as it does the earlier closing of the March Final and subsequent accounts enhances very considerably the need for expedition on the part of departmental cfiioers in dealing with accounts matters and it is eesential, if the desired acceleration is to bo achieved, that they should extend their fullest co-operation. 3 6 It is desirable that all errors in accounts should be detected inin time to be rectified before the March final accounts are closed. To facilitate this correspondence from this office re lating to reconciliation of accounts figures with departmental figures will, beginning from the accounts of January, be con- 1 ducted by Express letters and it is roquostod that such corres pondence may invariably bo immediately disposed of.

In this regard please see Mr, Hashim* s suggestion No. 6 of his note, a copy of which was received with your letter No. TEi-16-1941, dated the 25th ieptember 1934. The use of a seal as advocated by Mr. Hashim does not seem feasible in view'of the very limited staff of the Motor Tax Office. The sealing of tokens as they are issued would involve a considerable amount of extra work, which, unless extra staff was available, v/ould considerably delay work and inconvenience the public. To make the present system as fool-proof as possible, the Register ing Author it y has {suggested that a system of checking what passes from the public to the ^ Counter-clerks is necessary. At present-what goes from the Counter-clerks into the office can be accounted for; but there is no means of&gt; checking what comes to the Counter-clerks from the public. The Registering Authority has experimented with a system under which the Count er-clerks enter up in a Receipt Register details of every application received by th0&amp;u Under this system as each application is disposed of and entered up in the rough registers, the entry relating there^to /(12) Pay as now fixed in the prescribed scale on 1.1.1947 ^ ,16,8.1947 (a) at the stage next above the present pay plus one increment for every 3 completed years of service in the corresponding scale ( vide Rule 8(l)(a) ) (b) Present pay plus the ad Imc addition admissible and the next higher stag© in the prescribed scale (Rule 8(l)(b) ) (c) (l) Pay calculated on the basis completed years of service in the corresponding scale, or (2) if he is not a holder of a non-pemanent post,the pay in the prescribed scale at the stage next above the present pay, whichever is higher Vide Rule 8(l)(c).
