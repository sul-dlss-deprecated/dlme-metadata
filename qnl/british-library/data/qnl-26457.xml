Sir, In continuation of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No. 85 E m of the 2nd May, I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd. now appear to have overcome the difficulties of supplying water to the Madh-adh-Dhahab mine. It has been reported that an adequate supply of water has been discovered some forty miles from the mine, whither it is proposed to conduct it by pioeline: as the levels are not such that the water can descend to the mine by gravity, a good deal of pumping will have to be done. This reoort would seem to be confirmed by the departure for England, towards the end of May, of Mr. J.P. Park, who represents the interests of a prospective operating company. It was also announced in the London press that the formation of an operating company was foreshadowed at a meeting of the Mining Trust on the 18th May. 2. Meanwhile, prospecting parties continue their activities. Some old workings were discovered near Madain S alih , some thirty miles north of A1 Ula on the Hejaz railway. It is not clear if these workings are the same as those mentioned in paragraph two of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch under Right Honourable3 under reference. In any case, the Syndicate appear to he pessimistic as to the prospects of obtaining gold in commercial quantities in that area and the local press reports that the prospectors have 'finished their operations at Madain Salih'. The Umm Qariyat mine near We,jh has now been finally abandoned; but another mine has been located at Maraikib , near Yaribu ’ , which is stated to give promise of being a rich one . 3.

In continuation of my despatch No.327 of Dec^mh^r 21st last, I have the honour to inform you that th^ Saudi Arabian Lining Syndicate (Ltd) have not as yet b^en successful in discovering a supply of water adequate for the purposes of the Ladh-adh-Dhahab mine. However, they appear to be confident of ultimate success for they have been accelerating the work on the Jedda 'terminal”, and also on the jetty which now projects some distance into the sea. I'oreover a member of the Syndicate's staff stated in conversation that Lr. John Park, who holds a watching brief for the operating company, has a staff engaged on full pay in the United States of America ready to take over. According to another informant, however, the Syndicate cannot hope to produce gold for some three years yet. No public transactions in shares of the Syndicate have t been h^ard of, but Mr. Twitchell says that he has sold some shares 'at a good profit'. 2. In March a prospector went off to explore the area towards the Transjordan frontier in the vicinity of the Hejaz Railway. He stated before leaving that he would, in any case probably find coal, which would suit the company very well. His The Right Honourable Anthony Uden, N.C., M.P. , &lt;?cC • » dec. , &amp;c.His hopes, however, appear to have been over modest as at the end of April the Legation were credibly informed that the workings of an old mine, rich in ore, had been discovered at Araiq, north of Teima, where a nugget was found yielding seven ounces of gold. 3.

Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received January 11, 1937.) (No. 327. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, December 21, 1936. THE operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) in thi:-. country have, it is believed, progressed steadily since the last reports on the subject were rendered by Mr. Calvert in his despatches No. 225 and No. 267 ot the 28th July and the 12th September respectively. Little has been neard of the developments in the operations at Wejh, and as regards the progress at the Maod-ad-Dhahab, information has not so far indicated that any successful outcome to their operations is yet in sight. It is understood, however, that a water supply, inadequate for all the purposes of the mine, but nevertheless in a useful quantity, has been discovered, but it would appear that the syndicate are still sanguine of the ultimate success of their operations from their activity in completing their “ terminal headquarters at Jedda, which are expected to be ready for occupation by the end of February next, and in pushing forward the work on the projected jetty, to which a reference was made in paragraph 371 of Jedda report for November last. .... 2. Mr. Twitchell has, during the past few weeks, been otherwise engaged than in directing the present operations of the syndicate, for, according to a reliable report, he has recently visited Riyadh, accompanied by one of his principal geologists, Mr. Larken, and by Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer in charge of the syndicate’s transport organisation. At Riyadh Mr. Twitchell, who is expected to return to Jedda shortly, is stated to have been negotiating an extension of the area of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate's present concession. It may be presumed that the new area is that for which Colonel Etherton and Colonel Micklem unsuccessfully sought a mining concession last month (see my despatch No. 315 of the 7th December), an area in which may lie the legendary Najadeh gold mine, of which mention has been made in previous reports, and the promising Jebel Hilit district, which lies just outside the limits of the piesent concessionary area of the syndicate. My informant said that, as part of the price of a new concession, Mr. Twitchell was prepared to offer to build a first- class motor road from Riyadh to the Hejaz, for which undertaking the syndicate already have the necessary road-making machinery in the country. 3. ’ It is now possible to confirm that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate made a loan, of an unknown amount, to the Saudi Arab Government during the summer of 1936. as reported in Jedda despatch No. 268 of the 12th September last A member of the syndicate’s staff recently stated that the Saudi Arab Government were finding it difficult to fulfil the condition to liquidate this loan in monthly payments. 4.

Subject. oCCOPY (E 5.052/4552/25) Lord Castle Stewart called irdon ne by appointment on k August 5th bringing v/ith him Mr. K. 3. Tv/itchell the American who is managing the affairs of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited. I had understood that Mr. Twitchell had certain definite information which he wanted an opportunity of giving us but when the interview started it appeared tiiat he was simply prepared to answer any question which I liked to ask him about general conditions in Saudi-Arabia. \7e had a certain amount of desultory conversation about the progress which the Mining Syndicate was making but, beyond the fact that the Syndicate found all the Saudi-Arabian authorities well disposed, with the possible exception of Yusuf Yasin, and that, apart from a regrettable tendency on the part of the local population to put boulders in the paths of motor cars, they had no particular difficulties, nothing much emerged. The Syndicate are apparently well satisfied with their progress and hope the mining will prove valuable. It soon became apparent that what Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. Twitchell really wanted to talk about was Italian influence in Saudi-Arabia. They were both rather disturbed by the efforts which the Italian Minister was making to impress the Saudi Government and by the possible consequences of the recent gift of aeroplanes from the Italian Government to the Saudi Government. Mr. Twitchell volunteered the opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians and were not likely to facilitate the task of Italian penetration but he evidently thought that in practice it might be difficult to resist such penetration. In his view the United States and Great Britain were the only countries whom the Saudis were likely to trust. The United States though quite interested in the operations of American companies in Saudi-Arabia were not likely to take any active stops andthe • • • he for his part would like to see His Majesty’s Government increasing their oxm influence in Saudi-Arahia. Both he and Lord Castle Stewart agreed that it probably would not do to give any appearance of running after the Saudis and they disclaimed any suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should enter into competition with the Italians and the French in presenting aeroplanes to the Saudis. What they were really afraid of I think was that the Italians might at some future stage try to get hold of the landing grounds which the Saudi- Arabian Mining Syndicate is making for its own use within its concession area. They suggested that it would be well worth while for His Majesty’s Government to consider whether the Saudis could not be attracted to this country more by an offer of facilities for training air pilots in the United Kingdom. I said that I thought there might be difficulties about this as His Majesty’s Government's own hands were pretty full at present with air force expansion. However, I said that we would certainly consider whether anything on the lines suggested was feasible. Lord Castle Stewart said that the company had met with a certain amount of difficulty from the health point of view. A number of their employees had suffered from undefined illnesses and one or two had died. The company were therefore taking steps to engage the services of an expert from the London School of Tropical Medicine to make a special study which vould last for some months. They would propose to present the results of this study to the Saudi Government and it occurred to Lord Castle Stewart that one way of extending our influence would be in the field of medicine in Saudi Arabia. He seemed to have some idea of establishing a permanent medical adviser to the company who would also give the benefit of his advice tothe Saudi authorities. I said that the idea of communicating to the Saudi Government the results of any expert investigation vhich the company might undertake seemed to me a useful one. As to the establishment of any permanent medical advisers I advised Lord Castle Stewart to keep in the closest touch with His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda in viev; of the difficulties which the Saudis seemed inclined to place in the way of foreign practitioners at the moment. I auvised him to look very closely into the regulations vhich had recently been issued in regard to medical practitioners and foreign dispensaries and to make quite sure of keeping within the law of such regulations. (Signed) J. C. Sterndale Bennett. 10th August 1936.r\ copy (E 6289/4552/25) No.267. (1662/83/26) rS British Legation, Jedda. 12th September, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your printed despatch No.215 of the 20th August transmitting the record of Mr. Sterndale-Bennett’s interview with Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. K. S. Twitchell of the 5th August, and in accordance with your instructions to furnish my observations on the various questions touched on during the conversation. 2. It is interesting to observe that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s London officials were arjparently well-satisfied with the progress made so far in this country ana that they had hitherto encountered no serious difficulties. The claim thht the prospects at X/cjh are encouraging is made here with some confidence, but as regards the Mahd ad Dhahab I have for some time derived the impression from certain members of the Syndicate’s personnel that the future of these workings depends entirely on whether an adequate water supply can be assured. That the London Board regard the question as one of great importance would appear from the fact that since I reported on this subject in my despatch No.225 of the 28th July last, they have sent out, at this somewhat unpleasant season of the year, two water specialists of different qualifications, one a Swedish geo-physicist (at a salary of £.300 a month) and the other a British water- diviner. The latter has now left again for the United Kingdom ... The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc*, etc., etc.Kingdom and I have recently heard that both experts have pronounced unfavourably on the prospects of finding water at the Mahd. This, if true (for it is as yet unconfirmed), might well dissipate dreams of an Eldorado in that particular area. 3. As regard Italian influence in Saudi Arabia, Mr.*. Tvitchell’s opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians is of considerable interest. For my own part, I am impressed by the volume and unanimity of reports current in Jedda that the Italian Legation here is au mieux \ ( ; ith the Saudi authorities, as I have reported in my despatch No.259 of the 5th September, but I am unable to dismiss from my mind the impression created by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, only two months ago, when he spoke to me, with a sincerity I found difficult to question, of his Government’s resolve not to grant the oil concession for the Farsan Islands to the Italians. The Saudi Government at that time resisted the pressure that was brought to bear on them here by the Italian Minister, a resistance which might well have caused them some embarrassment as they had not long before accepted at the hands of the Italians, the gift of three aeroplanes. Perhaps the fact that, as far as I am aware, the remaining three aeroplanes have not yet arrived, may be attributed to Italian disappointment over the oil concession. I therefore am inclined to share Mr.Twitchell’s opinion. I would certainly agree with the view that it would be impolitic to enter into any competition with the Italians for the favours of King Abdul Aziz, either in the supply of aeroplanes gratis or in the training of Saudi pilots.4* It is somevhat difficult to express an opinion on the fears of the Syndicate that Italians might at some future stage attempt to get hold of their 1anding-grounds. These, I understand, are nov; fairly numerous and have been established at Jedda, Mahd ad Dhahab, Vejh, Yanbu, Dhiba and Taif, by special arrangement with the Saudi Government from \diom they are leased. It does not appear that at Jedda, at least, there is any such menace, for the Saudi authorities, with, it is believed, Italian advice, are now engaged in laying out a large landing ground north-east of Jedda, in the vicinioy of the Government’s Kandara villa, which, reports say, is also to be brought into use for the pilots and other personnel. if it is true, as reported in Jedda Report for June, paragraph 207, that the establishment of a chain of landing-grounds across Saudi Arabia is in contemplation (and in this connection it will be recollected that last year Ibn Saud was reported to considering a postal service by air across his kingdom, upon the return of his pilots from Italy), this would not seem to threaten the Syndicate’s landing grounds in such centres acD bejh, Yanbu and jhiba. Their ground at Taif, moreover, is distinct from that of the Government at that place. 5. The foreign personnel of the Syndicate have had an unfortunate record of ill-health since the commencement of operations. X am reporting by this bag by my despatch No. 264, of the 10th September the death of Mr. \.. D . Thomas Liout. Royal Navy (Set.) from the effects of heat, vhilst on his \;ay to the Mahd, I h- ve been informed here thatthe prevalence of sickness has been giving the London ^ office much concern, and I understand that considerable expendj.ture has already been incurred in medical fees, &amp;c. The Syndicate already maintain a full time medical officer, an Indian, at the Kahd, but elsewhere uhey are at present dependent on local resources. These are more or less non existent at Vejh, where they have a foreign personnel of about twelve, and are exiguous in Jedda, where there are two or three doctors attached tc foreign missions. I had heard, therefore, that the Syndicate had arranged to send out a Col.-, Mackie of the Ross Institute of Tropical Medicine in order to study health conditions at Jedda, Taif, Vejh and the Mahd. He has not yet arrived here. 6, I fully agree with the suggestion to present the results of any such investigation to the Saudi Government, although I fear that the present Director-General of Public Health would regard himself as too conversant with the conditions in this country to pay much attention to outside advice. I also agree with yr. Sterndale-Bennett’s cautionary suggestion that the Syndicate should look very closely into Saudi regulations before committing themselves to maintaining a permanent medical staff here. But I feel that the idea is to be recommended, both from the Syndj-cate’s ovn point of view, and for the more general reasons mentioned by Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. Twitchell. The Italians, again, are reported to have in view the establishment of an up-to-date dispensary here and the Italian Legation doctor, who is nov T away in Italy, is credited w-i-tn uhc intention of blunging st^ff and material backHere, however, there v.ould be back to Jedda v;ith him. less of the element of competition as between a commercial company and a Legation, than there would be in the case of the gift of aeroplanes. Moreover, there would be less opposition, I believe, on the part of the Saudi authorities to a non-Government dispensary or medical institution of the sort than to those conducted in this country under the auspices of foreign governments. There would, too, be no question of their operations extending to Mecca. I should therefore, on the whole be favourably disposed towards a proposal of this nature, vie. , the establishment of a permanent medical staff here, more particularly as Jeddct is badly off in its resources for medical treatment at present and may be even more so before long, with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. bringing a new influx of Europeans to this country.

Reociveu 1 9 OCT. 1936THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. August 10, 1936. Section 1. E 5039/271/25 Copy No. Mr. Calvert to Mr. Eden.—(Received August 10.) (No. 225.) Sir. Jedda, July 28, 1936. I HAVE the honour to refer to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 21 of the 13th January last, in which he described the developments up to that date in the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), and to submit a further brief report on the subsequent progress of this concern, in order to supplement the brief references to the subject that have been made from time to time in Jedda reports. 2. The four prospecting parties referred to in the enclosure to the despatch under reference left Jedda early in January in various directions. Little was heard of their subsequent progress, except that at the end of that month reports reached the Jedda office of the syndicate that trouble had befallen certain members of the parties. This was probably not more serious than mechanical breakdowns of their motor vehicles, but for a time alarmist rumours were rife locally, according to which difficulties had been encountered both at the hands of local tribesmen and of local officials. These were either entirely false or grossly exaggerated. Indeed, Mr. T. P. Larken returned towards the end of June from Taif after a period of several months of prospecting, during which time he travelled extensively, mainly in an area south of Taif, and reported that he had met with no interference. He had equally met with no success in his quest, and it was understood from him that the syndicate’s operations in the Taif area would now be definitely abandoned. 3. Much more promising results were reported from the Wejh area, where the remains of old gold mines had been discovered at a number of places in and around Umm-al-Qarriyat, some 10 or 12 miles north of Wejh. It appears as though the syndicate propose to go rapidly ahead in this new area, for they have now about a dozen of their European and American staff stationed there. These include the personnel of their own aeroplane, a Bellanca monoplane, which arrived at the end of April and is based on Wejh, wdience it has several times made its appearance in Jedda. The pilot, an American, is accompanied by his wife, who acts as wireless operator, and by a mechanic. 4. Work continues at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab, or Cot of Gold. The road, of which mention is made in the despatch under reference, was completed in June and is reported to be a very serviceable affair for most seasons of the year over most of its length. A useful report on the major part of the road w T as drawn up by a member of the Legation shortly before the work was completed. Other wise, the main interest in regard to the Mahd-adh-Dhahab centres round the problem of water. For some time drilling for water has been in progress and has been in the hands of American drillers, using American drilling machines. Progress has been slow and little or no water has been found. More recently, the Jedda manager of the syndicate relates, the London office, becoming impatient at the apparent lack of success, despatched tw r o British drillers to this country, with British drilling machinery. The latter had just arrived when Mr. Dunekley spoke on the subject, but the two drillers had been here a week or two longer and had already considerably improved on the efforts of the Americans. Water, however, is still to seek, and the matter is apparently a serious one, for, in the words of Mr. Dunckley : “No water, no mine.' The syndicate,-he added, were prepared to drill to a depth of 2,000 feet, whereas at the moment they have not gone deeper than 100 feet. 5. I observe from Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 7th May last to Sir Andrew Ryan that a concern named the Mining Trust (Limited) now holds a controlling interest in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), and assume that, since the flotation of the syndicate, the component interests concerned (as given [781 k—1]. in the enclosure to Foreign Offive printed despatch No. 313 of the 14th August, 1934) have changed somewhat. In this connexion, i was ^recently struck by a statement made by the Jedda manager of the syndicate that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate was owned by the American Smelting Company, “ lock, stock and barrel.” 6. In Jedda work on the terminal compound has progressed very consider ably, but the various premises are not yet at a stage when they can be occupied * by the staff. No signs of work on a jetty are apparent, but a landing ground for^ the syndicate s aeroplane has been established in the immediate vicinity of the compound. Mr. K. S. Twitched, the general manager in Saudi Arabia of the syndicate’s operations, left on the 24th June for the United Kingdom, and his place has been taken by another American. Mr. Park. 7.

PKftSONAL and 28th February, 1930. CONFi^hN^ni . My dear Fuad Bey, When we met at the Palace yesterday I said that I hoped to complete in the very near future my information regarding the Indian society mentioned in Your Excellency^ letter No. 5/1/14 of the 26th. Shawwal 1354 (21st January 1936) and my provisional reply of 6th February 1936. I am now able to give you the following particulars. The society in which you were interested would appear to be identical with the Anjuman-i-Ahrar-i-Islam, whose headquarters are at Lahore. Their movement was started in 1931 by a group of Indian nationalists of the Moslem faith, who had found it unpalatable to work with the 'Congress” party. The Ahrar movement at one time achieved much publicity in Kashmir and later became notorious for its attacks on the Ahmadiya Community. Still more recently the promoters of the movement have turned their attention to the Hejaz and appear to have interested themselves in certain affairs of internal concern to this country, including, I believe, the concession granted by your Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd. The activities of the Ahrar in India seem to be confined almost exclusively to the Punjab and even there they have recently lost ground owing to their refusal to co-operate with those concerned in another movement known as Shahidganj, of whom, however, I know very little. As/ His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza, Mecca.As I told Your Axcelienoy yesterday, I have heard something of a proposal by the Ahrar to send a deputation to this country but I am not aware of the movements of this deputation, if it was finally deoided to send it. While giving you the foregoing information in the hope that it may be useful, I need hardly emphasise its confidential character. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) ANDREW RYAN.•- 4 Your telegram No r 1C dated 6th February. Ref^rerce is to .Ihrar movement. Movement was started in 1931 by e! rou P c -^ nationalist Muslims who finding association with Hinduised Con-j gress uncomfortable sought to rehabilitate themselves by emerging as champions of Muslim interests wherever fh‘evened Movement attained wide publicity in Kashmir agitation of that year, and subsequently gained notoriety by attacking Ahmadiy : community. Recently Ahrars have turned attention to where they have taken line of condemning setmn of Bin Saw in granting mining contract to British fir:-.. On 2Cth Dee.rUi 1935 they staged observance of Hejaz day, which, he 1 .eve;. r as a failure, and followed this up by decision to send deputation to Hejaz. This phase of agitation may possibly be inspired by personal hostilities to Ismail G-haznavi. OR 2. Ahrar agitation is practically confined to Punjab, and has recently lost much ground by decision of party to refrain from engaging in Shahidganj agitat or. in Lahore with apparent object of appearing nationalist and not communal in sentiment. 3. Fuller report will follow by mail, and G-overnmons of India have no objection to gist of this information being communicated at your discretion to Saudi Government.

In the suraaer of 1931, a group of nationalist Muslims, finding that their position as memhers of the Indian National Congress, which was becoming more and more Hindu, was becoming uncomfortable, sought to rehablll tate themselves in the eyes of their follow Muslims by making a complete volte-face and emerging as champions of Muslim Interests wherever they were threatened. This was the origin of the in.jlls-i-Ahrar-1-1slam (The Inde pendent Muslims), Lahore. In the course of tine the movement gained support and branches of the Majlis were established In almost all the big cities of the Punjab and also In the North-west Frontier Province, Delhi, Bombay and the United Provinces. 2. This Majlis lost no opportunity to advertise Itself and it was fortunate In securing an ideal stage in the Kashmir agitation of 1931-32. When this died down the i.hrars found their Importance diminishing and there fore they turned their attention to fresh fields find at the close of 1933 they embarked on an attack on the Ahmadlya com,unity. For nearly two years they maintained their Influence but their failure to take part in the Jtiahlcigunj agitation (August and September 1935) resulted In a considerable loss of their prestige among their co religionists. Their indifference ms attributed partly to the ’nationalist’ views of their leaders and partly to a desire on their part not to alienate the olkhs and Hindus who had been supporting than in their campaign against the Kadianls and whose sympathy they hoped to retain in future. 3. The Ahrars have recently been making efforts to regain thel lost influence by diverting the attention of the Muslim masses to other avenues of agitation (e.g. the Hejaz). The first move in this direction was madet&gt;y the Jamiat-ul-Uloraa-1-Hind, Cavmpore, which In the Conference held at Budaon in October last passed a resolution, presumably Inspired by the Ahrars, condemning the action of King Ibn-l-oaud in granting a mining contract in the Hejaz to a British firm, and appealing to various bodies of the Muslims to protest against the c can tract. This afforded the Ahrars with a valuable opportunity to pursue the matter. Accordingly they held a Conference, which proved successful beyond expec tations, in November last at Biallcot in which inter alia % they passed a resolution urging upon King ibn-i-Baud to cancel immediately all contracts made with British firms and directing the Working Committee of the Majlis to make arran.pmcnts for the despatch of a deputation to the llejaz in order to acquaint the Bultan with the wishes of the Majlis, To give greater impetus to the agitation the Ahrars decided to observe the 20th of December 1935 as the 'Hejaz Day' but this somewhat misfired as the Day seems to have attracted very little Muslim attention, except in Mardan, Ludhiana and possibly a few other cities. The Ahrars, however, to some extent, succeeded in winning over a number of Muslim Journals and newspapers belonging mostly to the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province, who have been publishing articles voicing their views. 4. In pursuance of the second part of the resolution passed at the Ahrar conference at Bialkot, the Ahrars have decided to send a deputation to the Hejaz. It was originally reported that the deputation would consist of 5 men (viz. 1. baud Ghaznavl, 2. i.azhar All Azhar, 3. K. HaMb-ur-Rahmn, 4. M. MolnuMln ot Ajmer and 5. Syed Fall-ul-Hasan of Alornohar) but accord- _ ing to latest reports it will be limiteu to 3 or 4men (viz. Jaud Ghaznavl, President; M. Iviazhar All Azhar, secretary: and M. Aahur vUmed Bagol, of Bhera, district Shahpur). According to a rumour, one Ghulaia Nabi of Lahore v/ho has already gone on liaj. Is likely to he another meriSber. The deputation!sts are expected to sail from Karachi on or about the 15th February. 5. In this connection It will be interesting to note that the Hub Punjab Criminal Investigation Depart ment have recently intercepted a letter In arable addressed to King Ibn-l-daud, and uspected to have been written at the instance of isaJlls-1-^hrar-1-1slan by Tewfik Shari? Bey. The latter Is^ell-knowi oaudi national who was expelled from Slnklang the year before last and since then had been wandering In the Pamirs. It is reported that ho has recently come to the Punjab secretly. The local Criminal Investigation Department have been asked to arrest him but he has since disappeared and it Is now reported that he intended to proceed to the Hodjaz. Efforts are being made to locate him. 6. In the said letter (a translation of which has been placed on this file) the writer, whoever he may be, has explained to the Sultan that the .Jaralst-1-Ahrar has never h»d any hostile intentions towards him and would not have brought the matter to the notice of the public and the press but for the machinations of one of his own people who had deceived them. The reference, it is surmised. Is either to I.'oM. Khan Ghazi Khan of Karachi or more probably to syed Ismail Ghaznavi, the well-known agent in India of King Ibn-l-Daud. 7. To sum up briefly, the agitation has not yet assumed wide proportions and Is not likely to do so, so long as the dhahidgunj agitation continues to engage primarilyThe Ahrar l^arty. prlnKirily the attention of the public, despite the loss of its prestige and Influence, is still a well organised party in the inn jab, though outside this province, except perhaps in the North-feest Frontier Province, its influence ia almost negligible. In the circumstances it 'would perhaps be inadvisable to withhold passports from the members of the deputation for it will amount to an obstacle in the performance of their religious duty. At any rate, even if passports are refused it will be difficult to refuse the grant of pilgri: i passes which also will enable them to proceed to the Hedjaz. Personally, I do not see any great harm in allowing these men to proceed to the Hejaz. Once they partake of the proverbial usual hospitality I am sure they will come back to India with a different tale and a changed outlook.A A running: translation or the intercepted letter To all 1 His Majesty King Abn-l-oaud. | I have delayed my travels on account of paucity of funds. I have not received i.y money and other necessaries as yet nor I can reach the place where my money lies.

The Jamalt-i-Airar has never had any bad inten tions towards Your Majesty. They have always stood for your assistance and help.

The secret in this affair can be enquired from Kaulana baud Ghaanavl who is coming to you as the head of the deputation. This should, however, be enquired from him separately ?md not in the presence of the deputation. They would not have brought this matter to the public and in the press but for the machinations of one of your own people who deceived them in your name. They have therefore decided to see you personally and find out means by which they can both protect the interest of the Hedjaz as well as Your Majesty’s person. f&amp;iulana baud Ghaznavi will be able to explain, whan enquired, how this man cheated them about you.

For the moment, however, the main operations of the Company are concentrated/concentrated upon selecting the areas for which the leases will be given. One area seems already to be settled: the mine at Mahd-adh-Dhahab, where there seems every prospect of finding gold. This area lies on the eastern extremity of the concessional area, and apparently there may be some difficulty in eventually fixing the limits of the area to be leased as there is some difference of opinion as to the exact alignment of the boundary of the prospecting area laid down in the original concession^ Other prospecting parties are working in the neighbourhood of Yanbu and Wejh, but no other hopeful areas seem as yet to have been discovered. ^ 'r E. &amp; 0.

Ryan to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 3.) (No. 21.) Sir, Jedda, January 13, 1936. WITH reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No 339 o f the 26th November, I have the honour to state that, in view of the great development of the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) during my absence from Jedda last year, I requested Mr. Calvert to prepare a general memorandum on the position reached by the end of 1935. Although this memorandum includes certain information which has already been reported to your Department, it adds a good deal that has come to the knowledge of the Legation since the date of the despatch under reference and gives a useful comprehensive picture of what has become the most important industrial enterprise in the west of Saudi Arabia. I therefore enclose a copy of it. 2. Most of the information collected hy Mr. Calvert is fairly generally known here, but I would ask that section (c) should be regarded as confidential, especially as the map mentioned in the third sentence was shown privately to the member of my staff concerned by a subordinate employee of the syndicate, who thought afterwards that he had committed an indiscretion. The Legation has to reckon with the fact that Mr. Twitched, the general manager, is a somewhat secretive person, who might easily make it more difficult to obtain information, if he thought it were likely to be made public. 3. Work on the road from Jedda to the Mahd is still in progress, and i understand that as far as approximately 72 miles from Jedda the road may be described, from the point of view of light motor transport, as good. The central portion of the total distance still presents difficulty, but the syndicate are now equipped with modern road-making machinery. Activity also continues at the Jedda “ terminal ” of the road, where the construction of the compound referred to in paragraph 4 of the despatch under reference, on an area now stated to be 300 by 150 yards, is proceeding steadily. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Transjordan. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure. Memorandum respecting the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, {Limited), Mining Concession. (Confidential.) (a) Areas being worked, or about to be worked {or prospected in the near future). THE operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate commenced in March 1935 at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab (position according to latest estimates at 23 degrees 30 minutes north by 41 degrees east) and near Yanbu’. The latter workings, where Mr. Shanks was engaged, were abandoned in the early summer, but the former have continued and have been developed with considerable prospects of success. Under the terms of the original concession reported to the Foreign Office by Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 56 of the 24th February, 1935, by which areas which it is desired to prospect further should be designated within one year, and areas for exploitation must be fixed and subsidiary exploitation companies [631 c—2]formed within two years of the date of the concession, it is becoming a matter of urgency to determine the areas which can be worked profitably. Mr. Shanks has been away prospecting for the past two months or more (he returned on the 21st December, 1935), but had not had much success. His prospecting trip is believed to have taken him in an easterly and north-easterly direction, well into Nejd, almost but not quite as far as the Jebel Hilit (see below). At the end of 1935 arrangements were stated to be under way for four separate prospecting parties to go out into the concessionary area, the districts to be explored being, it is said, Yanbu' (in spite of previous failure in that neighbour hood), Wejh and two others not at present definitely known. M. Van de Poll left for Wejh about the end of December in this connexion. (b) Facts known as regards handing over the Mahd to an Exploitation Company. The little we know on this subject may be summarised as follows. The first mention, I believe, was by a member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to a member of the Legation early in August, 1935. This was reported to the Foreign Office in our despatch No. 227 of the 6th August, 1935. Towards the end of October, 1935, another member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate stated that the syndicate had given “the new company” one square mile to survey, a conversation which was reported in our despatch No. 339 of the 26th November, 1935, paragraph 5. It is difficult to determine from these brief references whether the Mahd itself is to be turned over to the subsidiary (it seems most probable), or whether an adjacent area is being made over to it, or both. (c) Facts known or surmised regarding Difficulties with the Saudi Arab Government. Difficulties are believed to have arisen with the Saudi Arab Government over the definition of the boundaries to the original concession. These boundaries are given at paragraph 2 of the enclosure to Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch to the Foreign Office No. 56 of the 24th February, 1935, and were published in the Umm-al-Q,ura of the 12th February, 1935. In December 1935 a member of the Legation staff had access for a short time to a map in possession of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, on which a boundary line was traced. This was observed to run as follows : Birk-Raghdan-Barq Samuda (not on Hunter's map, but about 21 degrees 30 minutes by 41 degrees 30 minutes)-Ashaira-Marran- Iqbah-Point 7 miles east of Mahd-adh-Dhahab-Amaq-Hanakiya-Hadiya-2500 mark of Hunter's map on Transjordan frontier near Itraif, thence along the de facto Hejaz-Transjordan frontier to Aqaba. The difference between this alignment and the published version relates principally to the area in the neigh bourhood of the Mahd. It would appear that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate are likely to lose, owing to miscalculation of the position of the Mahd and/or Jureysiya, a considerable slice of territory. The extent of this loss is not altogether clear although it probably forms a salient into the concessionary area, but whether of 7 miles depth or a larger area, due to an important inaccuracy in fixing the position of the Mahd, is not apparent. This is, of course, the main difficulty. Related to it, and indeed perhaps part of it, is the difficulty recorded in my minute of the 21st December, 1935, where it is described how Mr. Shanks was not permitted by an obstructive Amir of Medina to prospect as far east as the Jebel Hilit, an area, however, I should have thought would under any interpretation be well outside the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate concession. Minor difficulties have been experienced and smoothed away, e.g., over employing Nejdi as well as Hejazi labour. (d) New Recruits, with general Idea of Distribution. Staff arrivals and departures have been recorded pretty faithfully in our despatches to the Foreign Office. Since the last one (No. 339 of the 26th November, 1935), the following have arrived :— S.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 277 of the 8th October, relative to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to inform you that the operations of this concern appear to be making steady progress. Mr. Twitched recently informed me that diamond-drilling, carried out by six Swedish employees of the syndicate, was now proceeding night and day, and that a depth of some 80 feet had been attained. 2. Since my despatch under reference the personnel of the syndicate has been further increased by the arrival of two British employees, Messrs. Dunckley and McDermott, the former as manager of the Jedda office and the latter, a son of a director of the syndicate, as a surveyor; of two Americans, one Dutchman, one German and one Greek. Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer on the Jedda stafT of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), also has now taken up a similar post under the syndicate. 3. A large quantity of stores, vehicles and machinery, including the diamond drills, have arrived since my despatch under reference, and a great proportion has been successfully transported to the mine, in spite of difficulties over one stretch of the road Jedda-Asfan-al-Birka- Mahd-adh-Dhahab, on which work is still proceeding. 4. Work is also going on in the construction of houses, built of local stone, at the mine, whilst at Jedda it is reliably stated that the syndicate have acquired an area of some 300 or 400 yards square, about 1 mile north of the town close to the shore, where it is proposed to erect houses for the staff, workshops, store rooms and garages, and it is also projected in due course to construct a pier out to deep water to facilitate the loading and unloading of their materials. 5. According to revised estimates, I should now be disposed to place the mine at roughly 23° 30' N. by 41° E. An unconfirmed statement has reached me that an area of 1 square mile has been granted by the syndicate to a company, perhaps a subsidiary company, formed to prospect and exploit that area. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to Transjordan and the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. [581 q—2]f E 6397/602/25] (No. 277.) Sir, Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received October 28.) Jedda, October 8, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 227 of the 6th August last, relative to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to report that Mr. K. S. Twitchell returned to Jedda on the 6th October, after his visit to England, during which he paid a flying visit to New York. He was accompanied by two Englishmen, Messrs. T. P. Larken and D. L. Gibbs, and six Swedes, the latter having engaged as expert diamond drillers. He informed me. shortly after his arrival, that he expects two Americans to join him within the next few days, and hoped that his machinery would not be long in arriving. 2. Mr. Twitchell and his party have taken up their quarters in a house in the “ Legation quarter ” of the town, which he leased just before leaving here last July. He intends to make the premises his head office in this country. 3. He stated that he would be leaving for the 1 ‘ Cot of Gold ’ in about two or three weeks, and expressed his satisfaction at the preliminary work already accomplished. One of their chief difficulties, he added, would be the question of water supply, and he anticipated that he might have to go some distance to obtain adequate supplies. . 4. During Mr. Twitchell’s absence, M. Van de Poll, who has been in general charge, and Mr. Shanks, the Australian, with other members of the personnel, have been active. Mr. Shanks, in particular, has been in charge of road-making operations, along the alignment Jedda-Asfan-Al Birka-Maha-Adh Dhahab, to which a reference was made in my despatch under reference at paragraph 8, and in regard to which it is believed considerable progress has been made. 5.

CONFIDENTIAL. August 19, 1935. Section 4. [E 5014/602/25] Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received August 19.) (No. 227.) Si r &gt; Jedda, August 6, 1935. WITH reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 80 of the 18th March, concerning the concession granted by the Saudi Arab Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to submit a general report on the activities in the Hejaz of the syndicate since the ratification of the concession by King Abdul Aziz on the 12th February last. 2. It will be recollected that the concession allowed the syndicate three months in which to get to work, a year for general prospecting and another year for further research in selected areas, after which leases were to be granted to subsidiary companies formed to work the individual property. Mr. Twitched seems at present to be well ahead of this schedule. He set to work, with great energy, immediately after his return to Jedda on the 17th February. The Australian, a Mr. Shanks, mentioned by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 56 of the 24th February, arrived with a British clerical assistant on the 27th February, and the whole party set out early in March for Yanbu and the Northern Hejaz. 3. After four months prospecting and assay work Mr. Twitched seems to have decided to concentrate, for the moment, his attentions on the gold workings at Mahd-adh-Dhahab (“ Cot of Gold ”), and has withdrawn Mr. Shanks from Yanbu-an-Nakhl where he has been working without successful results. 4. Mahd-adh-Dhahab was visited for three weeks in June by Mr. E. D. McDermott, one of the directors of the syndicate. On his return to England early in July, followed on the 24th July by Mr. Twitched, who hoped to travel from Egypt by air, it was reliably reported that a subsidiary company had been formed to work the area containing this mine. 5. The Mahd-adh-Dhahab gold mine, which is situated at 24° 15' N. and 41° 10' E. at a height of 3,550 feet above sea level, is said to have been worked by Harun-ar-Rashid and perhaps even earlier in the times of the Jahilfya. The extensive workings and the large area covered by ruined buildings show that a great number of workmen were employed in those times. Mr. Twitched is now seeking to prove that the workings were not exhausted of their gold, but were abandoned either through the lack of engineering equipment and the knowledge how to mine deeper, or through the failure of the water supply or from political reasons. 6. Mr. Twitched has been working at this mine himself and says he is very gratified with the results so far obtained in the mining of gold. There are, I believe, also subsidiary metals. He foreshadowed early 'developments and hoped to start diamond drilling, the machinery for which was on its way. Mr. Twitched is, however, faced with many problems. I am not competent to judge the scheme from a technical mining point of view, but engineering problems may wed be small compared with other factors such as the supply of water and communications with Medina and the coast. 7. Mr. Twitched confessed to me in conversation that the water supply was indeed a problem and said it might be necessary to sink a wed. At present water is found in the surrounding districts at Maden (3 kilom.), Jiraisiya (10 kilom.), and Suwaijiya (50 kilom.), while at the mine itself Mr. Twitched has discovered a shaft containing water, estimated at about 7,000 gallons, which he intends to reserve for use in connexion with the diamond drilling. 8. With his usual energy and with Mr. van de Pod’s local knowledge in support, Mr. Twitched has set to work to solve the problem of communications. Mahd-adh-Dhahab lies, as the crow flies, some 100 miles from Medina and 240 from Jedda. The original plan was to use Yanbu as a base, being only 200 miles [481 t—4]from the mine, but during these four months* the road has been found very difficult. Non-Moslems have to leave the’beaten track from Yanbu to Medina and circle the forbidden area to the north, making the road distance about 315 miles, and mostly over abominable ground of Harat lava, where in the winter the trucks were once or twice held up by rain floods. This combined with the abandonment of the workings at Yanbu-an-Nakhl have induced the syndicate to consider the possibility of a road from Jedda, which will be a little longer than the Yanbu road, and which would give the advantages of quicker external communication through the larger port. They are accordingly now occupied in prospecting three alternate routes :— (1) Jedda-Asfan-Al Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahab. (2) Jedda-Rabigh-Madh-adh-Dhahab. (3) A route between these two. None of these routes is at all practical at the moment; to quote Mr. van de Poll, who made a preliminary prospecting journey through to the mine on the Rabigh route, he only went forward because he knew he could not go back. It remains to be seen which, if any, of these three routes are chosen. 9. Well sinking, road making and the provision of food and medical treat ment in the middle of unknown desert can only be a costly affair; it argues a wealth of optimism in the promoters in the possibilities of the undertaking. 10.

The Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate is registered as a British Company, though Mr.Twitchell, an American citizen, was primarily responsible for its formation. The Syndicate has obtained exclusive rights for prospecting and digging for metallic substances in an area which comprises roughly the whole of the Hejaz and Asir ■f as far south as Birk. This concession is to run for two years and provision has been made for leases of 58 years of the areas finally selected for mining operations by the Syndicate. The details of the Agreement will be found at P.Z.2511/35. 2. The Syndicate is of course entirely a private enterprise and from the report now submitted it appears unlikely that it will obtain/obtain the active support of the British Government. 3. Mr.Twitchell has so far been chiefly interested in the prospects of gold, but the present shortage of silver in the country may induce him to pay more attention to the baser metal, though the existence of large scale silver deposits in Saudi Arabia is by no means established.

If thure was to he any question of financial assistance, it must therefore oe on a purely commercial basis and it was for the private interests concerned to decide whether it was worth their while to run the obviously serious financial risks involved. Nor would it help ibn oaud to maintain his position if he had to rely on our, or on any other foreign assistance. We had some further conversation on the above lines, and I think Lord Castlestewart realised that we could not commit ourselves in any way or give him any kind oi lead.

Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate state that they have been asked by Saudi Government for loan of one million silver riyals, to be minted by the Syndicate, owing to alleged shortage of silver coinage in Saudi Arabia. Syndicate have no intention of complying Yvith this request, but are contemplating possibility of minting £2,000 worth of silver riyals a month, to be used in paying their employees and meeting their other expenses in Arabia. 2 6 They have been informed by Mr, Twitchell that, owing to shortage of silver, riyal exchange has recently risen from 12 to 10 riyals to the pound and may rise further. This presumably refers to pounds sterling and not to pounds gold (cih Eastern Department's letter of April 4th to Chancery about currency of Saudi claim for assistance in searching for lost aircraft) 0 They are anxious to obtain confirmation of Twitchell's statemento 5.

Twitchell's associate of Van Der Poll also recently mentioned he had experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient silver r.iyals here for Company's purposes. I had a conversation with fwitchell the night before he left, reported by despatch No. 227 August 6th, which left by bag yesterday, but he made no reference to the proposal of Saudi Government. He saw Minister of finance on July 22nd. 2. Rates show keen appreciation of thepiyal; vide Jedda report for June, paragraph 192. In terms of Egyptian pounds rate rose after the pilgrimage (when normally it should fall, below the usual figure oi 14 to 15) to 11 r.iyals,then for one day July 30th (?) to 8i riyals falling to 10 riyals and 8 piastres, subsequently steadied to 10 riyals one piastre at the end of July where it still remains. So Reasons for shortage are obscure. No reports have been received of export of silver coinage ana stories of hoarding (by Banque ol Misr inter alia) for sale at a profit during next pilgrimage are difficult to accept. Rates are likely to rise as usual when pilgrimage season commences in Jedda and do not for other reas uis before then.6? Notes. Register No. P. Z.4656/35 SECRET. Minute Paper.

Anti Ibn Saud propaganda in the Indian Muslim Press. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. , i 'T Previous papers 3330 1000 12.34 This propaganda in Muslim papers in the Punjab and the United Provinces is extremely fantastic. It is alleged that Ibn Saud, by granting a concession to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, 'has sold away the holy lands to Christians' and that 'the British Raj is positively established in the Hejaz'. Although the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate is registered as a British Company, the prime mover in its formation was an American, Mr. Twitchell, and it has of course received no sort of support from His Majesty’s Government. For the formation of the syndicate and the terms of its concession please see the Minutes at P.Z.5289/34 ana 2511/35. The comparison2. drawn between the syndicate and the East India Company, and the reference to 'an English officer I named Philby at present at Mecca and ruling over the I Hejaz in the guise of Ibn Saud^are rather amusing. If these newspaper articles are any guide to I Muslim opinion in general on the subject of Ibn Saud it looks as if the delegation which the Saudis are proposing to send to India to enquire into the . question of Haramein waqfs will receive a somewhat I cool reception. The suggestion on page 4 that the only way to restore the sanctity and purity of the He J‘ az wil l be to diminish the number of pilgrims visiting the holy lands and thus tell upon the j • r ©sources of Ibn Saud is of interest.

(Laho re) • 21.5.35. J 0 f gold! Yerily thou ar f nt God* but by God 'Hie veiler of sins and judge of needy souls. Taking for granted the unconditional injunction of the prophet of Islam to turn out the Je*6 and Christians from the Holy Lands* the editor* while illustrating the recent expulsion of the Jews from Germany* expresses his opinion that it is always politic on the part of a nation to check the foreigners from making their permanent abode in her country. He remarks that it was an unfortunate incident for the Muslims to have lost the Islamic Caliphate (vicegerency) on a mere undertaking given by the British Government that their Holy Lands shall be duly protected against the encroachments of foreigners* but this was not done and the history of Jerusalem* Transjordan and other cities is sufficient to show that the promise was not fulfilled. Referring to an Arab idiom, A1 Harbo Khada (War is deceit), the writer narrates how* at the instigation of the British Government* Ibn Saud ana Sharif Hussain revolted against their Caliph and fought against the Turkish army in the hope that they shall be made rulers of some principalities of Arabia* and how Sharif Hussain* who was promised through Colonel Lawrence that he would be declared as the first King of Arabia* was badly disappointed and consequently had to go against the wishes of the British Government. The writer continues to relate how Ibn Saud was strongly supported by the British Government in chastising Sharif Hussain for his disloyalty towards his masters (Snglish) ana thereby acheiving for himself the throne of Hejaz. TheThe writer* charging Ibn Saud with the desecration of the holy tombs and sacred buildings, pulling down the mosques, interfering with the Shariat Laws and injunctions and bringing about seTeral other such charges against him, concludes that Ibn Saud, as compared to Sharif hussain for his treachery, proved a greater foe of Islam in many respec ts. ‘•Siyasat' 1 , (Lahore) 22.5 • 35. British Ra.i is positively established in Hejaa. Ibn Saud has sold away the Holy Lands to the Christians , 0* gold! verily thou ar*nt God, but by God, The veiler of sins and judge of needy souls. \ Referring to the conclusion of the previous article that Ibn Saud proved a greater foe of Islam than Sharif Hussain, the writer vehemently remarks that contrary to the expectations of the Muslims for the general uplift and progress of the Arabs, the recent agreement made between the Saudi Government and the British Mining Company of London has altogether frustrated the hopes of the Muslims, who are greatly apprehended at this agreement, which recalls to their minds the formation of the 3ast India Company in India. Commenting adversely upon the clauses of the agreement and the concessions, which the Saudi Government have granted to the Mining Company, and further tracing the history and subsequent advance of the East India Company in India, the writer arrives at a conclusion that Ibn Saud has not only entered into an agreement with a commercial Company for purposes of some monetary gain to the country, but by doing so he has shown a way to the British Government for their permanent occupation of Hejaz in the near future. The writer supports this viewTl~ with a remark that it is a general practice among the »iropean powers that on the very outset they enter into a country on mere commercial basis* but in the course of time they settle down there and eventually become the masters of that country. Concluding* the writer remarks that unlike Afghanistan* Iran and Turkey the inefficient Government of Ibn Saud could not make uee of the Internal resources in Arabia and by giving a contract to a foreign mining Company Ibn Saud has clearly acted against the injunctions of the prophet of Islam and thus afforded every possible opportunity for the foreigners to occupy Hejaz, which is undoubtedly a matter of great concern for the Muslim world in general. British Raj is positively established in Heiaz . Ion Saud has sold awa/ the Holy Lands to Christians . Commencing the article with a comparative statement about the political motives of Sharif Hussain and Ibn S a ud* the writer emphasizes that the latter is more culpable for his treachery as he is still committing it in transferring Hejaz into the hands of foreigners. He grievously feels for the attitude of the Wahabis for their not only supporting the policy of Ibn Saud in respect of his alliance with the Ctoriatians but also opposing the Hanafis and other Muslim sections, who protested against Ibn Saud and further feels surprised how the Wahaois could remain silent and inactive when Ion Saud pulled down the mosques* oppressed the Musllms- irrespective of their age or sex and handed over Aqba 0* gold! verily thou ar*nt God, but by God, The veiler of sins and judge of needy souls and1 $ ^ ’ '^4^ - “'.1 ^ and Oman to the British OoTerntsent. Referring to Ihn Baud’s statement relating to his contract with the British Mining Company, which,in the words of the writer, clearly furnishes prool of British supremacy in Hejaz, he fervently remarks th&amp;t this contract would certainly lead to the introduction of railways and tramways, construction of roads and bridges and ststioning of military forces in Hejaz and believes that Just as Iran has become helpless in respect oi the Persian Oil contract, Hejaz too would finally come under the permanent control of the British Government, He further comments that exception of Mecca and Medina from the mining operations is quite meaningless as an English officer, named Philby, is present at Mecca and ruling over Hejaz in the guise of Ibn Baud and it is very sad to notice that the holy places of both the Christians and Muslims have come under the sway of Christians and the Arabs are feeling satisfied over these conditions in Hejaz and do not.rise up for any action to protect even their own holy places, Exhorting to invite the attention of the Indian Muslims to the present state of affairs in Hejaz, the writer suggests that the only alternative for restoring the sanctity and purity of Hejaz will be to diminish the number of pilgrims visiting the Holy Lands as it will greatly tell upon the resources of Ibn Baud and also lessen opportunities for his propaganda work in India* In conclusion he remarks that Hejaz h^s now fallen a prey into the hands of the money-makers and foreigners and the days are not far off when the British rule will be completely established in Hejaz,*Wahdat* (Delhi). 28.5.36. I bn 3aud and Contract an ISng lish Coapany. Does not this Contract amount to religious intervention. In this article the clauses of the contract f which fea^published as a Mining Contract in the Unm-al-qura, a semi-official paper of the Saudi GoTernment, haye been 0 enumerated and details of the concessions which Ibn Saud has granted to the Company are given in full. Public attention has been invited to this contract v^ith spec ini reference to the establishment of the Sast India Company# which primarily did not enjoy so many concessions as Ibn Saud has granted to the British Mining Company in Hejas. •Ihe writer believes that this contract is a clear intervention in the religious and political affairs of Hejaz and is quite opposed to the religious injunction *\ that 'the Jews and Christians should be turned out of Arabia 11 . He questions Ibn Saud on behalf oi the Muslims if he is really fulfiling his promise of protecting and purifying the Holy Lands which he had made on his first entering Hejaz as a King. He atlirms that since the cessation of the Caliphate most of the Arab chiefs have been playing to the tunes of the European powers and particularly this contract is the result of Ion Jteud's loyalty towards his English masters. Apprehending that just as Indian employees of the Bast India Company had won and handed over India to their masters# the Arab employees of the British Mining Company may not do the same# the writer invites the attention of Ibn Saud*s supporters and well-wishers to carefully study the nature of the contract in question and then remark how they hold Ibn Saud.The signing of a contract with British Company is a 'Si, asat' (Lahore), 24,5•3&amp;» dangerous step taken by the hejaz Government Maulana Hasrat kohani^ statement on his return from signing of the contract, the writer remarics that Ibn 3aud has undoubtedly taken a dangerous step in haying entered into an agreement with the British Mining Company, as under certain clauses of the agreement the Company enjoys the rights of forming colonies for c*rgues that religious activities and maintenance ct the Holy Lands may have nothing to do with the contract, but the mere existence of a British Company in Hejaz is in itself a clear intervention in the religious and political affairs of the country. Consequently, Ibn Saud, who entered Hejaz with an idea of protecting and purifying the Holy Lands, has, instead of carrying out the orders of the prophet of Islam that the Jews and Christians should be turned out of Hejaz, become a source of creating opportunities and affording facilities for the settlement of foreigners in the Holy Lands, cared nothing for the demands of the Islamic world and secretly conducted the contract negotiations with the British firm only because no public voice could be raised against him. Observing Ibn Baud's presumption that the concessions, which he has granted to the British Company, might tend to secure and safeguard his position in Hejaz and Asir for a period of a t Cawn^re), (Reproduced from ' the 'Mustaqil', the Ha.j Introducing the article with a comment on the for the protection of their goods and materials.

Bntry of the Bnglish peaple in Hej az Referring to the article appeared in the •Mustaqil*, Cawnpore, the writer strongly supports the viewpoint of Maulana Basrat Mohani in respect of the contract recently made between Ibn Baud and the British Mining Company, he believes that Ibn Baud has, no doubt, to overcome financial difficulties, but such an action on his part will never be appreciated by the Muslims, who will protest against the policy of Ibn Baud.In any further communication on this subject, please quote i No ^~ o&amp;/* and address —not to any person ly/fiame, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. /V'C THE Under-Secretary of State^ for Affajrs presents his compliments to ^ an ^’ by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop--«-*P’Of the under-mentioned paper.

Jedda, March 18, 1935. • WITH reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 27th February relative to the concession recently granted by the Saudi Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to state that the Royal decree sanctioning the concession referred to an agreement and contract as having been signed by the Minister of Finance and the representative of the syndicate. It now appears that these were two separate instruments as, after the agreement summarised in the enclosure to my despatch under reference had been published, the Umm-al-Qura proceeded to publish, in instalments, an even lengthier document described as a contract concluded on the same date as the main agreement. 2. Although the further document is described as above, it is clear from internal evidence that it is a form of mining lease for fifty-eight years, in respect of areas to be finally selected for definite mining operations in accordance with article 3 of the main agreement. The procedure contemplated would appear to be that the Government will lease these areas to the syndicate on the conditions laid down in the “contract.” and that the syndicate will form subsidiary companies to work the individual properties. As the general conditions are stated in the main agreement, I do not think it necessary to report at length on the “ contract,” the detailed stipulations of which appear to follow normal lines. The following points, however, may be noted :— (a) The Government are to receive during the period of the lease a rent of £1 per feddan of the leased area plus the excess, if any, of 5 per cent, of the product of the mine over the rental so fixed. (h) The special arrangement for payment of customs duty on imported supplies, &amp;c., at a flat rate of 10 per cent, will operate throughout the period of the lease. (c) The Government are not only to receive gratis 15 per cent, of the share capital of the eventual subsidiary companies, fully paid up, but they are to have the right to nominate a director to serve on the board of each company, the total membership of which shall not exceed six persons. 3.

EN0L08URE IN WEEKLY LETTER No. 15 11 APR 1935 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL SECRET DEPT. INDIA •i. . :THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 4^of the 7th January, I have the honour to state that the text of the agreement between the Saudi Government and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 15th February, together with a Royal decree dated the 12th February sanctioning the agreement. It may be assumed that the syndicate had already ratified it. 2. The agreement is a fairly lengthy document, and I consider it unnecessary to trouble you with all the details. I enclose a synopsis showing the principal conditions. In the absence of the annexed map it is difficult to trace the exact boundaries of the assigned area on the south and east, but a very fair idea of them can be formed with the aid of the ordinary maps and the Handbook for Arabia. You will observe that the northern boundary is the de facto frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan, starting from “Point E,” the position of which is defined as in the Hadda Agreement. 3. Mr. Twitchell duly visited Egypt and Syria as foreshadowed in my despatch under reference and travelled as far east as Rutba, whence he went to see the alleged gold mine at Gaara. He then proceeded for a short time to England. He returned to Jedda on the 17th February and is now making active preparations to start his prospecting campaign at four places, all of which are in the northern part of the assigned area and the most important of which is the “Cot of Gold,” where he has previously done some preliminary work. He has collected two mining engineers, a British subject named George, who has had much experience in India, and a United States citizen named Ballard, besides a clerical assistant named Bisshopp. He expects a third mining engineer from Australia. M. van de Poll, who was mentioned in my despatch under reference, has already been busy up Medina way and Mr. Twitchell describes him as having done magnificent work. I gather that the general headquarters of the prospectors will be in the first instance at Yanbu’, where a house has already been rented. Mr. Twitchell is certainly tackling his enterprise with great energy. 4.

Similar letter sent to I4—6130 10950(2)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT (No. 4. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, January 7, 1935. I HAVE the honour to refer to my confidential despatch No. 204 of the 2nd July last, relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitched, representative of the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate (Limited), and to Jedda report for December 1934, paragraph 304, and preceding reports, where the varying fortunes of Mr. Twitched, engaged over a period of some six months in negotiating with the Saudi Arab Government a concession to exploit minerals in this country, have been periodically recorded. The successful conclusion of these negotiations was noticed in the report under reference and was announced in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 28th December in a short article, which described the concession, signed on the 23rd December, 1934, as one for the exploitation of the gold and other mineral resources of the country, with the exception of oil and other liquids, over a restricted area. The agreement, the article stated, would shortly be ratified, and thereafter the text would be published. 2. Pending the publication of the text of the concession, the following particulars, partly disclosed in conversation by Mr. Twitchell himself, and partly received from other sources, are of interest: (a) The Government are to be assigned 15 per cent, of the shares in any companies to be formed to work particular concessions, a provision which, it is gathered, proved unpalatable to Mr. Twitchell, who favoured the assignment of 15 per cent, of the initial nominal capital rather than 15 per cent, of shares actually issued, as and when issued, a point on which he found himself obliged to yield. Mr. Twitchell stated that he successfully resisted the desire of the Saudi Government to participate, to the extent of 15 per cent, of the shares, in the existing syndicate, a holding for which the Government were even prepared to pay. {b) The Government is to receive 5 per cent, of any gold eventually extracted, (c) Customs duty is to be paid at a flat rate of 10 per cent, on all material, &amp;c., imported, {d) The area finally agreed on under the concession is, roughly, the whole of the Hejaz and Asir as far south as Birk, with the exception of certain reserved areas, notably about the Holy Cities. This general description was given by Mr. Philby, who said that the area first approved by the King extended as far as meridian 44 degrees, thus including a considerable slice of Nejd, but that it was later decided to set the eastern limits much more to the west. Mr. Twitchell, who did not allude in any detail to this point, expressed himself generally as quite satisfied with the area actually allotted, (e) The agreement, according to Mr. Twitchell, must be ratified by the syndicate, after which it will be published. 3. It is gathered that Mr. Twitchell is to be joined by M. Van de Poll, the Dutch Moslem who has for some years resided in this country, where formerly he had commercial interests in work connected with the concession, although presumably in some non-technical capacity. Mr. Twitchell left Jedda for Egypt and Syria on the 26th December and is understood to be actively engaged in making arrangements for prospecting, and, if a report from Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. that a large consignment of pit-props has been ordered through them by Mr. Twitchell is to be believed, for early mining operations as w T ell. 4 .

Sip, I have the honour to report that an announoeraent appeared In the Mecoa newsp^e r 'Umm-al-Qura' on May 6 th to the effect that an 'AMblan Steam Navigation Company' had been established In Jedda and had purchased two steamers which would run between Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports. One of these steamers, a vessel of some three hundred tons from Beirut formerly named 'Andree Edde' but now renamed 'El Path' arrived off Jedda on the 21st May and sailed for Jtaftn two da;,s later. ne other, also from Beirut and to be named 'El Nasr', lias not yet arrived. 2. It would appear that this Company, like the 'Arabian Export • lo:apany described In my despatch No.O.T.ll of the 4th April last originated In the fertile brain of the Minister of Finance, who Intended at first to use the ships for military transport, but has now ooncelve J the Idea of using them for commerce and possibly for the transport of pilgrims In the future. Sheykh Muhammad Serflr as-Sabbdn mtmagsr of the Export Co. fills the same position In the Steam Navigation Jo., and the Amir Fe sal, Fuad Bey Hamza, Sheykh Yfisuf If tttn • and othep notabl8g are 8 ha re holder a. The firm of Huseyn 'Awaynl, a Syrian well-known connexion with the Lancashire trade and through ~ his association with the projects of Mr. A. 0 . Ydltbt, are to act as shipping agents. The steamers themselves are said to have been bought from or through a certain Hajl Khalil Tabbara, described as the pilgrim j agent of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd. of Beirut. 3. It is clear that the new company, while ostensibly a private concern. Is In fact primarily a Government enterprise, representing the first attempt of the Saudi Government to enter the realms of commercial navigation, indeed Sheykh Ytlmxf yfistn, while stressing the commercial character of the Company In conversation with me a few day, ago, said that the Government had undertaken to guarantee any loss on The principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, working/ y Department of Overseas Trade.working. The Government may be encouraged in this venture by the success of the motor-our companies # which fora a parcel instance of ami-private. Government-controlled concerns and which were originally intended for Government transport but now carry the bulk of the pilgrim-traffic within the country. 4. It may be recalled in this connexion that in the latter part of Xing Hussein’s reign, the Hashimite Government acquired at least four small vessels of this type and employed them either for coastal work or for transport of pilgrims, whom they sometimes forced to travel by them. Two or three of these vessels were attached in Egypt, I believe b. order of a court, in satisfaction of claims against them and efforts made by the Saudi Government to retrieve them after the fall of Jedda were unsuccessful. Another had been mortgaged to members of the Al-Fadhl family in Jedda and passed into their hands. It subsequently became more or less derelict and I do not kno* what has happened to it. 5.

HIS Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him copy of a note to the Government of India, dated the 20th February, 1934, respecting the Jedda water supply. Jedda, February 20, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to the Government of India. Sir, Jedda, February 20, 1934. IN your despatch of the 25th January you were good enough to inform me of the action taken in India to bring to the notice of intending pilgrims the medical advice recommended for observance during their stay in the Hejaz by the Indian medical officer attached to this Legation. I have the honour to inform you that one of the questions dealt with by Dr. Abdul Hamid, that of drinking- water in Jedda, has recently reached a stage which makes it of special interest in this connexion. 2. Jedda has, previous to this year, been supplied with water from three main sources : (a) By the Government sea-water condenser; (b) by “ saharij,” or rain-water from reservoirs; (c) by well-water from wells close round Jedda. A series of attempts have recently been made to supplement these supplies by bringing into the town the water from wells at Waziriya, a place some 7 miles inland from which water was brought to the town in Turkish days. In August of last year the committee engaged in the work succeeded in making this water again reach the town through the old Turkish conduit. 3. The subject, although mentioned in the annual pilgrimage report and in Jedda monthly reports, has hitherto been considered more particularly from „/ the economic point of view, and the principal recent despatch on it was &gt;2 Mr. Calvert’s No. 355 of the 9th December to the Foreign Office, which was ' , t distributed to theHJepaTttnmtT^rf Overseas'Trade only in addition. In that G ' despatch Mr. Calvert stated that the prospects of a satisfactory flow of water appeared good, but that the committee was said to be lethargic and had to contend with the hostility of vested interests, notably that attributed to the powerful Minister of Finance, who looks to the sales of water from the present sea-water condensers as a small but certain source of revenue. The position as regards the water actually arriving in Jedda from Waziriya was less satisfactory. “ They have, however,” said Mr. Calvert, speaking of the committee, “ done nothing towards the renewal of the conduit near the town; and it has now been established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated filth of ages that the water, which is reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of germ. Europeans here consequently eschew it and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considera tions of price a great deal more than by those of hygiene, fights shy.” 4. I am glad to be able to say that this disquieting verdict on the water arriving in Jedda can now be revised. I enclose a portion of a memorandum by Mr. G. W. Furlonge.O who has recently collaborated with the Indian medical officer in conducting an analysis of the water, summarising the results and their probable effect on pilgrims. This analysis showed that from a bacteriological point of view, the water is reasonably innocuous even when it reaches the central P) Not printed. [56 n—1]cistern from which it is distributed in the town after coming through the Turkish conduit. The latter is in two parts, a stretch of some 4 miles consisting of an underground conduit, partly cemented, and a further stretch of 3 miles consisting of earthenware pipes near the town. It is uncertain, on the other hand, whether a supply of really fresh water can be maintained, as the wells or pits sunk at Waziriya, where it seems to be possible to get water at almost any point in ^ largish area, appear to be fed by a seepage through the soil, and even though the first water may be fresh, the flow tends as it comes from a greater distance, to become more saline. 5. You will see that Mr. Furlonge’s conclusions are reassuring, as regards the probable effect of the new supplies in regard to pilgrims. At the same time it is certainly not of such a kind as to do away with the necessity for encouraging them by all possible means to take the precaution of boiling all water they use, or alternatively mixing a few grains of potassium permanganate with each bucketful and leaving it to stand for some time, before use, as recommended by Dr. Adbul Hamid. 6. I will bring this subject up to date in my pilgrimage report for this year. As in the meantime it is of general interest, I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the principal posts concerned with British and British-protected pilgrims, other than India, viz., Singapore, Jerusalem and Khartum. I am also sending copies to the Foreign Office and the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.r ’7K- In any further communication on this subject, please quote no.

WITH reference to my despatch No . 285 of the 9th September regarding the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that the day of cheap and plentiful water for Jedda now seems as far off as ever. 2. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziria Committee are still at work at Waziria extending the old Turkish conduit farther back into the foothills in order to increase the head of water, which seeps into it from the subsoil, and a satisfactory flow of water into the town continues. They have, however, done nothing towards the renewal of the conduit near the town ; and it has now been established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated filth of ages that the water* which is reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of germ. Europeans here consequently eschew it, and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considerations of price a great deal more than by those of hygiene, fights shy. 3. It is estimated that an expenditure of T5,000 would suffice to repair the whole conduit, renewing the piping where necessary, and thus relieve Jedda of any future anxiety as regards water. The water runs from these wells to the town by gravity, and no pumping apparatus, not even the now derelict windmill pump introduced by Mr. Twitchell, is needed. An enterprising municipality would whole-heartedly support the scheme. But the Waziria Committee is lethargic. The all-powerful Minister of Finance is believed to be hostile to the scheme because its fruition would necessitate the closing down of the condensers which at present supply the town and would thus deprive him of one small but certain source of revenue. The local merchants on the committee are far too much in awe of him to act effectively. Whilst, therefore, the yield of certain municipal taxes has been voted for furthering the scheme and there is some talk of a future levy on pilgrims, no efforts are being made to raise an adequate sum for the purpose, and the labours of the well-meaning Dehlavi seem doomed to be stifled through lack of funds. 4.

With further reference to paragraph 2 (b) of Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No.31 O.T. of the 27th June transmitting your revised ”K” lists for Jedda, I have to inform you that Sir Andrew Ryan called at the Department of Overseas Trade on October 2nd and discussed the question of a report which he proposes to prepare on general lines on the trade of Arabia as a whole. 2* While this proposal was welcomed by the Department of Overseas ^rade it was explained that, under a scheme agreed upon with the relevant Departments of State for the co-ordination of commercial intelligence in the Persian Gulf, the Department of Overseas Trade would in future correspond direct with the Resident at Bushire on certain matters touching the Arabian side of the Gulf. 3. It follows that such specific questions as ”K' lists of firms in the Bahrein, Kowait and Muscat districts will automatically fall to be dealt with direct by officers stationed in the Persian Gulf posts concerned, though more general economic questions concerning Arabia as a whole are within the province of His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. * I am, with great truth, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (for the Secretary of State), (Signed) J.

[E 5726/1494/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 27.) (No. 285.) Sir, Jedda, September 9, 1933. WITH reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 160 of the 31st March, 1932, paragraph 4, relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitched in regard to the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that water has again been brought to Jedda from the wells at Waziriya, and the event was ceremonially inaugurated on the 26th August in the presence of the Minister of Finance, local notables, and a large gathering of townspeople. As the result of the discovery of a fresh spring, to the soutn-east of the wells themselves, work has been in progress for some months past, under the direction of Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and experts of the Mecca water supply of Ain Zubeyda. The water has been led through the old pipes, put down in Turkish times, and now falls into the Idarus reservoir, situated on the outskirts of one of the poorer quarters of the town. The present rate of flow, according to Mr. Twitched, who still shows active interest in this undertaking, is 40 gallons per minute, and this, he says, it will shortly be possible to increase to as much as three times that amount on the completion of work on a second conduit which runs alongside the first, but which is not yet connected over its entire length. 2. Mr. Twitched points out that here there is an ample and cheap water supply sufficient for the needs of the town, whose present rate of consumption he places at 38 gallons per minute. Although other local experts would estimate the local rate of consumption at probably not more than 24 gallons per minute, it may be conceded that the new source of supply is more than sufficient, is cheap (for it costs nothing at the Idarus reservoir), and at present is reasonably safe at source. The Indian Medical Officer attached to this Legation recently conducted an analysis of the water, chemically and bacteriologicady, and pronounced it to be fit for consumption. The total water consumption of Jedda, therefore, may be expected to increase, particularly as the poorer classes are able to draw as much as they require for the mere trouble of carrying it away. 3. From past experience, however, considerable doubt is expressed as to the prospects of Waziriya water becoming a permanent factor in the town’s water supply. The doubt is not diminished by reports that, although from Waziriya to Ras Qaim (a place 5 kilom. from Jedda) the conduit has been cemented and is at present fairly sound, over the remaining distance the pipes are old and rotten and require constant care to prevent leakage. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi has unsuccessfully approached the Jedda municipality in an endeavour to get the pipe-line thoroughly repaired, and has now placed the matter before Ibn Saud, stating his preference for a cement conduit over iron piping. 4. In the meantime, the sea-water distillery, or condenser plant, continues to supply the town with drinking water of a kind at the rate of about 8^ gallons per minute, and the English engineer in charge anticipates no great reduction in demand for his product, in spite of its greater cost, on account of the lack of confidence in Waziriya water on the part of those who are able to afford the other. 5.

Twitchell and Hamilton, representing American mining and oil interests, needed some public explanation. 4.

Thence believed to have gone to Basrah by train for business and on to Karachi by air. Appeared to be well informed and not crude. Stated to fellow passengers that American oil interests had concession along coast line of mainl and of Arabia and in desert , but were not taking steps to develop them as yet. He mentioned that Mellon connected. This may signify nothing but I report it as it may just possibly be due to wider concession-hunting than we kn ow.

Political.(if @ I Jedda, Hijaz, Hofuf# Haaa, (Arabia January 9th, 1952. K1 Hassa Investigation^ Report * 10 «2. Hofuf - Qjair - atir » Juball - Bahrain To Hie Majesty, Abdul Aziz Itm Saoud, 'ing of the Hejaz, Sejd and Dependencies, Riyadh, (Nejd)* Greetin e, Again I wish to congratulate you on having such resources and possibilities for future prosperity in the country I have traversed from Hofuf to Jubail. I am glad to submit to you here with a report on my observations and opinions. On my return to Jidda I shall make you a complete report including these two pre liminary ones. I shall discuss first the water and agriculture in the sequence of the trip and then the question of the harbour at Rib Tanura and after that the subject of the petroleum and finally trans portation including roads. 1 . ater and agriculture. 1) On route from Hofuf to Ojair. At 27 Kilometres Easterly from Hofuf on the motor car route there is a group of palms and so it is likely that by digging here water can be found - if so it would be beneficial to caravans. 2) At el Muthar which is 65 kilometres from Hofuf and 16 ilometres West from OJair the water is so close to the surface that it can be scooped up in the hand. Here a large well might be sunk and a light hand diaphragm pump installed to fill troughs lor watering caravans as well as to irrigate dates and gardens if they were planted. 3) At 6.4 Kilometres West from OJair there is quite a ; r\*r&lt; 9 sectionsection of date groves which is being destroyed by sand. If this were removed and palia fences made to stop the drifting sand this place might provide a living for a family or two. 4) At Ojair I can see no reason why drilling might not develop artesian water. Oiair to atjf. 6 ) From 6 kilometres to 12 kilometres north of Ojair along the coast and road are many palms indicating that water is close. This might be developed and date palms plantea to good advantage. It is probable that the water developed would be brac&lt;ish and only suitable for dates. If it is found in large quantities then rice might be established. Rice should be tried at Ojair if artesian water is obtained. 6 ) Llnla. There is a series of springs from 6 kilometres ^est from here at Aine Sihat or 96 kilometres north from jair to this station. T) oiair - Xatlf road . By digging out these springs and cleaning them out well it is very probable that increased amounts of water would be obtained. The land ^eejis suitable both in topography and quality for growing dates and rice. There is a considerable area available in this district which might give homes and work to a number oi famillOa. 8 ) For 9 kilometres north to lobar there are many palm* bo there must be considerable water. As it was dark when I travelled along here I could not see details uut tnink that this section and all the way to Dammam could be made to yield dates, rice and alfalfa in many localities. 9 ) Dammam. 1&amp; kilometres from Ojair is devoted to sea faringfaring tout west of it are areas where water can toe found and used for cultivation. Of course the size of acreage will deoend on the amount of water developed. In many places southerly to otoar (24 kilometres) I toelieve gardens can toe established and water developed. The vegetation along the road gives me reason to toelieve this though I could see but little as it was dark during this part of the Journey. 10) From Dammam to Anek there are seven ditches carrying drainage and waste water fro® the date groves to the sea. It is said that these ditches carry water during the four months of the year only, tout this is sufficient time to raise grains like wheat. There are many hectare of land available between the road and the date groves, where very high tides flood the land occasionally small dykes of earth could toe easily and cheaply built and sluice gates of wood put across the ditches to prevent the sea water entering. This would toe tout a very few hours, so during this time the fresh water could toe used in irrigation. Careful surveys would show the exact levels to where water could toe backed up and diverted toy the sluice gates. No harm would toe done to the existing palm groves. In some places it might toe necessary to raise the water about one metre toy low lift pumps, (diaphragm or centrifugal pumps, windmill or engines would toe suitable, tout much could toe done toy sluice gates only. 11) From Anek to the boundary of el Katif date groves there are three large ditches conveying waste ireen water into the sea. Ac noted in item No.10 the water flows tout four months per year. The same remarks as made in No.10 apply toto this area. My rough measurement a showed a flow of 2,310 gallons (if.s) or 462 tins per minute or .145 cubic i etres per second, in one of these citches. Gates of 1.2 metres width by 1.4 metres high approximately would back up the water raising it sufficiently to irrigate the fields adjoining it to the North and South. I strongly recommend the Eucalyptus (rostrata and globulus) and japanese bamboo trees be cultivated and planted along ir rigation. These would supply timber for both house and ship building. 12 ) Vicinity of A 1 ^atlf. At Umm Dailage about seven kilometres south of al Katif an old spring about 6 metres by 6 metres is being cleared out At present there is no flow but the work is not completed. There are hundred of hectares around here which can be irrigated if enough water is developed. Low lift diaphragm or centrifugal pumps would augment the amount. The soil is fine and shows considerable salt but is said to have been productive xormerly. 13) From our house (Sharalfa) in Al ‘fotlf on the sea coast front to the north west it is 8 kilometres to the boundary of the date groves. Among the productive ones there are several patches of abandoned ground which need only a little work to make them produce rice or dates. 14) Safwa , at 14 kilometres north west from Al ntif. There are three very large springs here, the largest being Alnej Danish, the second Aine el Ifoosta and the third Aine al Janubia. Aine Danish has five outlets and I estimated it© discharge at 10,000 U.S. gallons or 2,000 tins per minute. To the north and east and south east there are hundreds of hectares of idle land between the Safwa date groves and the sea. iuch of this an a is suitable for *he cultivation of rice, alfalfa, wheat, sorghums and possiblypossibly cotton. Although aaoet of the soil shows evidence of salt it ie said that after a few irrigations this salt disappears. It is Quite probable that the xresh water can do this talcing the salt into solution ana carry it away to the sea if suitably drained. There are three ditches which run throughout the year carrying drainage and surplus inter from Safwa to the sea. A rough (measurement I made of one oitch showed a ilow oi 3,976 U.S. gallons or 796 tins per minute. The ameer stated that this ditch was the average of all four, if this is the case there are 16,900 gallons or 3,180 tins per minute available for irrigation. Much of the land would require very little grading, only ploughing, harrowing, seeding and ditc iing to make it productive, alter washing out as much salt as possible. X would strongly recommend that donkeys, mules or camels be trained to haul pOcughs, ditchers, harrowers, cultivators, drags and s eders. Aitei the people understand these implements tractors may be used but they are much more complicated and expensive as ere also the implements which they haul. I consider this large area of land with its big water supply extremely important and believe can be made to pro duce a considerable income. Food and clothing are the prime necessities, both might be grown - at least should be tested. II cotton is suc cessful its picking, ginning and weaving would give employ ment to many people as well as keeping in the country the money spent on foreign cotton gooes. The same i; true ol rice and wheat. Careful surveys should first be made in laying out ditches and plots. It might be mutually profitable for the Government to givegive perpetual leasee on all such of ite lands contingent on the continual cultivation of them and payment of say one tenth of the produce either in fcind or cash, also with the right to stipulate what crops should be planted on, say, one half of each leasehold. 15) Abu Maan at 23 kilometres north west of Al Katif. On the road out to . bu Maan at 11 to 14 kilometres distant from Al .Xatif there are many palms nd at least one unused spring. Dates and gardens could be established along here. At Abu &amp;aan there arc three springs, No.l Abu Maan is to the north west. No.2 Aine al Wasta is south of it, and No.3 Aine al Fogma is to the east of No.2. At present each has an estimated flow of about 50 gallons (J.S) or 10 tins per minute. Aine al Fogma shows ancient walls lining it. All springs are much overgrown by weeds, pampas grass and reecs The amounts of water can be increased by cleaning out these springs also by windmill or engine operated low lilt pumos. The land all seems to be of good quality but the areas round Aine al Waeta and Aine Al Fogma are the more favour able for the first clearing and cultivation. An area roughly 2 x l£ kilometres is immediately available. This is another very important area. As in all other new areas I would recommend that small experimental gardens be planted first in order to see what plants and crops thrive best and what are likely to give the best profits. Also as timber and fuel are such two important items tree seeds and seedlings should be includes in all such gardens* If much work is done here, good roads should be laid out to expedite j nd economise transportation. 15 ) Raheemm. At 41 kilometres northerly from al Katif an 16 kilometres northwest from Has Tannura. This spring is on/II on a slight rise on the sedimentary rock at 1.3 metres above the surrounding country. The How I estiioated at about 100 gallons (U.S) 20 tins per minute. The area about here shows evidences of previous cultivation, and the vegetation shows there is water near. The spring water is good but warm. Should water unexpectedly not be developed at Has Tanura, sufficient for drinking purposes could be hauled in tan&lt; wagons from here. The area suitable for cultivation round here is large and good use can be ifiade of all water which can be found. Dates and rice should do well in this locality. 17) Has Tannura ^ell. The 7* casing of this well was seen and salt water has filled it to about 1 ntetre from the collar. I was informed that this was c.rilled but 22 feet and four pieces of casing were used. I do not see any reason lor not resuming the drilling of this well to test to a depth of say 600 feet to prove whether or not this lies in the belt of artesian water. I can see no geological reason against hopes for success. I would recommend that it be cased as long as salty water is obtained, that water be tasted as obtained and all brackish water be sealed by casing or cementing. 18) Jezeirat T ahreen . 10 llometres south west of Has Tannura - 8 kilometres of A1 katif. On the road at Pahreen two wells were drilled. No.l reached 280 feet when water earn# up for about five minutes, it was said then sand came up also, and another length of casing was added which sank out of eight and all was covered with sand and water. I have been told that 17 strings of casing have been lost in drilling in Bahrain. Ho .8 well was drilled it 20 feet (6 Metres) south of here to a reported depths of 160 feet. Halil Canoo at Bahrain was the drill owner. He stated that somebody dropped a large2*. large piece of iron into this so stopped this work. He has several drills and would he glad to do other drilling. Abdul Aziz al Goseihi and Company also have a water well drilling outfit. I would not recoai&amp;end drilling wells s ialler than 6* diauietre at the collar. I can see no geological reasons against finding water at Dahreen. Only drilling will deteriaine whether or not the artesian belt extends to this area. I have strong hopes that it does. 19) I'arut . There are two springs here. I sew the flow of the larger one should say it would amount to at leat 3*000 II.S. gallons or 600 tins per minute. There are many fine date groves hut I saw some areas which seemed to be abandoned. These could be made productive. 20) Aine Sabeel . At 16 kilometres south from Al Xatlf end 15 kilometres west from Dammam. This spring was buried but is now being reopened* it is down to four metres in depth and is now discharging an estimated quantity of 75 tf.S gallons or 15 tins per minute. After rauiadhan this work will be resumed. Between here and Dammam there is a large area suitable for cultivation. 21) Je bel hadra. 24 kilometres south of Al Katif and about 22 kilometres south west of Dammam. This hill shows that it was formed very many thousands of years ago by hot springs holding much calcite (like lime/ in solution. hen this hot water came to the surface the calcite was precipitated so forming gradually layers upon layers and eventually this mountain. The summit as registered by my Aneroid barometer is 450 feet above sea level. I could see other smaller formations in this vicinity. There appears to be nothing of practical value about here. ^oakib (plural of Aokab,. Three springs - road at Katif to Jubail. a)a) Kofcato ABhoaham at 28 Icilometres north of al atif. This spring does not flow* the nater is orackish and the *&lt;oil iB very thin. It does not seem to hare attractive possibilities. b) Bir okab Arrafia - at 29 Kilometres north of al atii. Although called a well it is a true spring. It ic situated at the summit of a conical hill oO feet tuove the surrounding country. It is quite possible th£.t ii a tunnel were driven in near the base of this hill to tap this water quite a flow might develop. The surrounding country is suited for cultivation though salty in places. There may be quite an important flow of water as it ahowo . a pressure of 12 lbs per square inch in order to reach ltd present level. The water is fresh and good to drinK. There is no flow from it. o) nhrt'b iiafcaich.. At SO kilonetr. b north of al Katif. This is on a flat. It does not flow but the water is ; fresh and cold. Digging might develop additional fter. There are palms and grass here as at Koleab Aral la indi cating water. The area about here is suitable lor As all these springs are on the direct route between Katif and Jubail a few laalllee algit gain a good living by having gardens and supplying food and water to north of Jubail and about 8 kilometres e; st of the coast. Very appropriately the King has had a pole with a sign on it indicating this spring so fishing boats and Other. •an get fresh drinking water here. A aiaeonary or concrete station her# would make this water more easily obtained but such a place would cost a good aeal of cultivation. 23) i frkab lhailB. (to dip) in the sea at about 9 kilometres moneyf money and is not necessary at present* 24) Bahrain . The largest spring Is Aine Ithari and has an estimated How of 1/4 of Aine el hodoud at Hofuf. Much water seeps through the sides and nine to waste In the sea neartiy. There Is much unused land around here which coulc be cultivated and Irrigated by this surolue water. Vh* extraordinary high tides could be kept out by dikes and sluice gatea. Artesian wells have their maxlauu flow at from 880 feet to 520 feet but the average seers to be at 295 feet Judging from what was told me. Major Holmes said that there are five different flows of water *io.l at 160 feet being the sweetest but small in amount, No.4 is the one in general use. He said that he was sure that Artesian water could be obtained at lair. Mohamad Yatee.-i stated that in hia biggest well the stratuu overlaying the water bearing one was bo hard that drillinj was abandoned on striking it, but he had it penetrated after hie second well had produced water. his No.l well ie said to be the largest producer in the island, ben welle are drilled above 20 feet above the sea level sulphurous water is obtained I was told. This is cer tainly the cose at the Government proposed experimental garden. This water carries so much Hydrogen that it is useless for irrigation. The Geological formation at Bahrain is identical with that I have seen along the Hassa coast. I can see no reason why both oil ^nd artesian water cannot be found i this district if located on the proper structure. he sone of artesian water would see* to point towards Llng« Harbour site ■ae Tarmura^ By road this is b6 kilometres and is north east from Al Katlf measuring ub 18 kilometres in a straight line from Al Ketii. ae la as I can see this locality gives an excellent deep watt harbour/ ^ ^ v-v- harbour for ships of many size a, tout before stating up to what si as the beat charts should be obtained and studied, also a certain amount of surreys with soundings should be done to rerify the aoouraey of the charts. The strongest winds are said to blow from the north# This harbour is well protected from the north and east, less so from the west and still leas from the south# High winds from the latter direction are stated to last but one or two days# The pier so far completed extends into one metre of water with the deok at 1#3 metres above the water# Is some of the surface is washed out \&gt;y the sea it prove a that the eier should be made higher# It should also be iaade much longer extending into ample water for deep sea going vessels to tie up alongside. Before deciding cm a structure accurate surveys should be made# Also the matter of concrete niles and concrete construction should be investigated# There is a big flat area to the east and north of the pier sufficient to construct warehouses, store:;, shops, re sidents etc# The required amount of drinking water can be obtained by hauling It in tank waggons or trailers, from line aheena, only 15 kilometres distant, but it is to be hoped that amnle water may be obtained by drilling wells# I can see no adverse indications# A good road must be constructed along the point to the mainland - a total distance of 7 kms but only 4 kms are in deep sand# The best method if ohean crude oil is available Is to sprinkle the sandy road with it# If oil is too expensive clay should be repeatedly mixed with the sand# A foundation of stones is preferable, but if too expensive mlm branches will serve for a time, if actively repaired and maintained# if/If a port Is to be constructed, the surreys in the harbor, the drilling of the wells, and the construction of the road should be rigorously prosecuted, the buildings can be done later. The transhipment duty of Zjfa ad valorem would be saved for this country and government revenue would be obtained by l harbor dues, quarantine taws etc. as well as employment supervision or restraint of any material ordered by your Government. I can see only advantages resulting from the establishment of a deep water port at Has Tanura, but of course, it will cost a considerable amount of money depending on the nature and size of worlcs and equipment. At Bahrain there is only one derrick, it has a capacity of six tons and is operated by hand - it has been installed only one year but has given great benefit. Such a crane is not very expensive and would be suitable for here. Light oars and tracks would be the only other equipment necessary at first. Oil Seeps. At Has Tannura I found oil seeps in the shape of tar at the southwest end of the point. Halid Bey el Gargani found more at about five tons north along the coast. At Sokab 15 tons coast for E tons. Inland this sand stone was hidden and over- lain by a thin layer of sandstone, probably of aeolian origin. On the east ooast of Jezirat Abu All we saw similar oil seeps for a distance of about 8 tons to El Baida but only the rook was identical with that seen to the south - a porous sandstone. I found similar seeps on the south ooast of this island. Altogether the total distance over which we have seen | given to a seaport personnel. Furthermore there could be no in. south of Jubail we followed similar seeps south along the last was in the rook, the rest being on the shore sand. The these/(g) these seeps measure 3 95 tana on the map. There le no doubt about there beirwr tar - or petroleum - bearing formation - but whether strata can be found ©arrylqf ooni^ereial quantities and qualities only drilling can demon strate* In order to find the most farourable places for oil concentration, the proper structure, or shape of the strata must be looated and drilling done there* 3 o far I hare not seen the right structure, all the strata lying very flat and level. The work being done at Bahrain le very important in some way* It has proved there is a tar stratum at 1,020 ft. but it Is not of value. The depth of the drill hole was 1,247 ft. on January 9th, 1932 and the fori|atlon still favorable* If oil in commercial quantities is struck, there is good reason to expeot it here, as geologioal conditions are similar* The depth determine the slse and expense of drilling equipment* The equipment at Bahrain is of very heavy type suitable for 6000 ft. The work is being done by experts of the Standard Oil Company of California, all are Americans. However if oil is not struck at Bahrain it does not prove it oannot be found here* It may simply mean that the oorreei structure was not found where drilling was done* I would not advise any expenditure on oil drilling here till the hole at Bahrain is completed* furthermore on account of the world’s present overproduction of oil and resultant low prices I think it would be unlikely to get as favourable and profitable terras from an oil company taking a concession now as might be negotiated in the future* Again I wish to congratulate you in having such attractive potential resources in your great kindgom* (Signed ) X. 3 . T vl TCHJ LL*A Rtport Ho* ft* Part IV» UliDerala &amp;nd OcolOfor* 1. At 6 taa south of Kahelra on th« road to Tftif th«r« are some large veins of quarts outcropping. When there is an assay office in Hia&amp;z samples should be taken from here and as s wed to see whether or hot these veins contain gold. g. There is a good deal of quarts in the gravel plain east of Esheira, this should be tested by canning. Some of the men who are with Mr. Mosley can do this and nan in z&amp;ny other places to test for placer gold after Mr. Mosley and I leave. 3. At about 20 km west of 11 Muwaih there are big quartz veins which should be saraoled and assayed for gold when there ~ a local assay office. 4. At 168 to 174 km east of El 1 uwaih fhere are large fields of quartz pebbles, fhis gravel should be canned to test it for placer gold. 6 . At 13 km ea.it of Afeef there are schist and quartz outoroos. These should also eventually be sampled. 6 . At 50 km east from camp at F«L Kaeya and 3 km from .*aais Hisha there are wide distributions of quartz pebble but s there are numerous rock outcrops this gravel is lively ver\ shallow and of no value, nevertheless it should be prove if there is any placer gold. 7. At 33 km easterly from the town of Daw&amp;dmi there is a red area of sedimentary rook showing a considerable iron content, but not to be considered of commercial value. This is *.t the contact of the igneous rooks which consists mostly of granites lying to the west and sedimentary rooks consisting of sandstones and lime stones lying to the east and % extending to the ^raian Gulf. The contact of these two formations/0-7 formations should be prospected to see if there are any metalliferous veins such a contact being favourable for ore deposition. At 29 km easterly fronv fcurat there is heavy iron stained sedimentary rook on the northeast side of the road. There is very little chance for a valuable deposit here but it is an interesting oocurrenoe. There are big white cliffs extending in a long line roughly north west south east back of Al Barra. The elevation on the road in the valley is 2,180 ft. The cliffs are all sedi mentary and as far as could be seen were sandstone, some of the strata being very siliolous. These cliffs are what is called 'fault scarp” and show there has been a great movement of the earth there. Along the bottom being a line of weak ness there should be found water also possibly, mineralized veins. This region should be examined. from 25 km to 45 km north easterly from Sir Rumah in the Dahna there are limestone folds. That is the limestone strata are bent in the shape of arches, drilling in the lower curved folds or through might find water, and drilling in the tops of the arched folds might find oil if the deep formations are petroliferous. from 2 a&amp; el Jidia to Hofuf there are fantastic weatherings of the sedimentary. The peculiar mushroom strata overlying softer ones which erode faster so leaving overhanging caps. The singular thatched roof appearance in most of the smaller outcrops is a very recent wind formed sandstone, which covers all shapes and dips of outcrops like a roof. It is an unusual and inter sting geological formation but of no oommer- oial importance.J«dd&amp;, Hl&amp;jaz yebruary 27 f 1932. Shawal 20 f 13&amp;0* To His Majesty Abdul Alls ibn laud King of the Hidjaz, Hejd &amp; Dependencies. Blyadh v Kedjd. Greetlngsl 1 have examined Mahad Dahab as you hare requested and I herewith sending you ray report on it# This report will not be ooniplcte until the results of the assays of the 25 sample a taksn hare been received, I have tent most of these samples in duplicate, a part to Hew York and a part to London. It will be about 8 ^ months before the results oan be reoelved so I would hope to have them on my return to Djeddah from Yemen. All sample a will then be plotted on the map so you oan see where eaoh was taken. I shall hope to explain this to you. As I shall emphasize in my report, these samples cannot give a true idea of the value of the ore mined, or of that still left in depth, they will give but suggestions of the true values. However, the re was no other alternative. The same conditions are likely to exist in most of the ancient mines, namely, that all payable, easily jined, ore has been extracted. To determine possible extensions there must be many samples taken of outcrops and adjoining veins, also sufficient work should be done to clear out the bottom of the a topes in many places so samples oan be taken of the ore left in the depth. This method should be cheaper than shaft sinking although this will be necessary if ore is to be mined and additional ore bodies proved. The great extent in the ancient workings shows that many men were employed over a considerable period of time. It is not reasonable to suppose that such extensive working would be carried on without a larse and profitable output of gold. Only well directed development work which includes the taking and assaying of hundreds of samples oan determine whether/V whether or not this property oan he made an important source of gold under present conditions* It la reasonable to expect that with ancient mines such as these, Umm Garayet and Haleet, that other unworked deposits may be found by diligent prospecting* I hope that many people will study the mineral collections I have brought - ten more hare Just arrived* Also that the iaen who have been working under Mr* Mosley will continue that work under Ahmed Pakhry* I am pleased that there are such favourable possibilities in your great country* But I wish to emphasise two faots* Men of education and standing, as well as being your subjects from Nejd, He&amp;jaz or other provinces must accompany me and my assistants in order to learn hew to carry on the works we initiate, after we leave your country, otherwise the overhead expenses of our salaries will add a high cost to production and much of our work and efforts will have been wasted as we try to explain item* Second* * I When I give instructions they should be carried out, as I only order things which are beneficial to works in hand* The Wazaria-Jedda water system is an example* I have given instructions which have been cancelled by the Mudir of the Condenser. I have installed efficient cheap windmill pumping for raising the water and have proved the water can flow into Jedda* All the repairs should have been oompleted by December 15, if work had been prosecuted vigorously* Constant delays have been made so the costs have greatly increased as well as the continued high cost of the operation of the condenser has First. been/been continued. If such interference la allowed then I am afraid I can be of no use to you or your country and little progress will be tua&amp;e* By the cooperation of all concerned a very great deal can be accomplished. If those who obstruct improvements were removed and only those eager to assist In progress of development and anxious to learn about these matters were kept, then work would proceed in a muoh more satisfactory manner. Of course an 8 * or 10 M pipe of steel or asbestos oement, would be muoh better than the present 5” terra cotta pipes but these will serve for the time perfectly if they are reasonably oared for. When money is available a new pipe line can be laid near the present one but without interfering with it. Naturally a new pipe line would mean a large capital outlay which is not necessary at present. I have proved that desert soil like that at Wasaria will produce crops when given water. I have proved water at Urana Salem at 17 ft. in depth where a windmill pump can raise water to make a garden. This is at 19.2 km from Jedoa on the road to keoca. a garden would produce vegetables for pilgrims and make a resting place for them. The Nr. 5 drill hole proved ground or subsurface water at 33 ft, depth at 14.3 km from Jedda on the Mecca road.

By developing water, gardens can produce vegetables and fruits but additional and other food supplies will have to be brought from Medina, Yen or Jedda. The gardens should be established at Jlralalya wells - 10&amp; k.m. to the west as It Is likely that all water In the Immediate vicinity of th mine would be necessary for domestic consumption and for milling of the ore Blr Maden et 3.2 k.m. north liest of the mine has furnished water tor it previously The * 1 ,The vegetation la very light hut sufficient hushes and snail trees grow along dry wadi beds to furnish fuel* Ho timber suitable for mining grows anywhere in this kingdom that I have seen* Mining methods using very little timber can be devised* 6 ) Geology* It is only necessary to state that the geology of this mine is complicated being of voleanic rocks cut by intrusive dikes which may have been the cause of the ore deposition* The veins are of quartz mixed with fragments of wall rocks in places* The quarts in many places show copper and iron minerals called aalachite* azurite and pyrlte* It is quite likely that the latter is the gold caaftier* The leaching and oxidation of much of the pyrite suggests the occurrence of gold values in depth beneath the oxidized zone* As seen by the map there are two series of veins the main series striking or extending, north-south, and the other aeries cutting across at various angles* All veins wary considerably in width which is termed 'pinching and swelling'* This condition will doubtless continue in depth* Judging from the size of the vein systems and general geological features I can see no reason for the values not to persist to greater depths than the present workings* The average depth of the workings cannot be accurately ascertained as the walls have caved in filling all stopes I have seen* back of time prevented me examining as much under ground as I had wished but from all observations, I would judge most of the at oping was above a depth of 20 metres below the surface of the flat in which most of the buildings are located* The ancients may have stopped work for any one of several reasons 1* Gold values disappeared, but as noted before, I think this is unlikely, 2* Wars drove the workers away* Perhaps historical investigations can determine this* 3* Stopped water* As water occurs in the solid rock at 3*3 metres from its surface In Ho*l Blr kaden, and at the surface of bed rook in No*2* Blr Maden this seems the most likely reason for the cessation of the mining* The dip or the inclination of the veins varies from being vertical to 30 degrees* Most of the small veins are nearly vertical, usually dipping west but with local variations to the east* The No *6 vein has s very flat dip to the west but there has been so much caving of the atopes at the surface that it is impossible to make exact statements as to dips* However all conditions are favourable for stopping without timber* It will be possible to simply leave pillars of the vein to support the walls which are well suited for this mining method* There are many evidences of faulting before and since the formation of the ore deposits* 6 ) Character o f Or* and ^aoi-yeju As noted under Ho.5 - Geology, the ore is quartz, mostly very hard carrying iron pyrates, and copper carbonates* It is likely that the pyrates carried gold values* The results of the assays will d tenaine this supposition* There are no visible ore reserves as all ore was stopsa to the surface leaving but few pillars which naturally would be of the lower grade* Twenty five samples were taken from the pillars and from fragments of ore left along the sides of the sopes at the surface, also from dumps of pill tailings and among slag heaps* The accompanying sample record describes each weenie and the sap shows its location* The values should!&gt;• recorded on both records and map as soon as received* Twenty five samples are being sent to frulaan and Picard* Londin and twenty one duplicate samples to Ledoux A Co Hew York* The results should be here within two or three months from the time of despatching the samples* I have instructed Ledoux A Co to send results in duplicate* one list being s .t to me and the other to His jSxeellency Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman* Mecca* 1 wish to emphasize the fact the results of these samples will but suggest the gold contents as they are of material which are undoubted ly been hand sorted by the ancient workers and considered of too low value to be saved* The samples from among the milling dumps and slag heaps are from ore after the values had considerably been extracted* Only be clearing out the bottom of the ancient workings in many places and sampling these places can the real value and the ore left be ascertained* 7 ) ^lant and extraction the ????“ extensive ralx a® may be seen by the map* There xxx milling of the ore was done* The ore was first broken into in hand operated horizontal disc mills made of lava* Some mortars of lave were also used for coarse breaking* The ore was crushed to sand-like fineness and then washed to obtain the free gold* Dumps of both the coarse pieces and sand tailings are scattered over all the area shown on the map* The photographs show how there are many small dumps up to 4 metres deep instead of one large dump* To the Kast of the min© hill are a number of slag dumps which prove that a part of the or© was smelted* Doubtless a certain amount of copper was obtained and the ore valued for this metal instead of the gold* The copper carbonate minerals indicate this conclusion* I picked up a typical piece of pur© copper from the slag heaps* Gold would not likely have been obtained by smelting as it would be mined with the copper and iron* and the ancients would not have the facilities and knowledge for separating it* As previously mentioned samples were taken from the coarse quartz dumps, the sand tailings and quartz lying among slag heaps. These samples should give on indication of the efficiency of the ext. &amp;ction methods* % There are but ruined walls to show where the extensive buildings were situated* There are many of these among the quartz dumps but none amonf the slag heaps* the ancient workings in as many places as possible, say at every ten meters along each vein* Then careful sampling and measuring of each place should be done* If these samples show sufficient values then a shaft should be sunk and a level turned off at, say* 30 meters below the resent lowest workings* Sach vein should be drifted on and samples taken at each 1*6 meters* But this is a development programme for the future and it would require a few thousand pounds expenditure* Tests to determine the most efficient methods of extracting the values should be made* If the sampling after clearing showed good values it is possible that an American Company might be found which would undertake further devel^ment as above^oted provided favourable terms could be obtained.9) -.stlaates for vork at ■ afaad Mining toole, Xiu 3 pa f via&amp;laaeea, Xaddara ate# t»eing 1 /S of equipment quoted ae per my report Ho#l - Ha^at) 16th 1950 or Koreaber gsth, 1931# A Explosives being £ of the estimate in above aentioned report* - Carbide for l*mg* or canulos* local suppliee of baskets, ropes, and timber and lose rail from the lie3as Hallway for making skids for hoisting* @4.60 per gold pound this would b© £910* $ 2,473*00 798.00 100.00 1 , 000*00 Vi,373.00 Total for plant £910. - gold 44,373.00 In addition an American aiaslatant engineer would be required to direct this work at a monthly salary of £ 121 * 500*00 @ / 4*00 per pound gold* Of course the quicker the work would be done the less the overhead.

The essentials for prosperity of a country are food, clothing exports and manufactures. I first not© water and agriculture which would provide food and clothing. Cotton, rice, dates, sugar, wheat, sorghums, fruits and vegetables can all be produced in your kingdom. second. Communications in the line of roads which would enable cheaper distribution and sale of products, then mines which are the foundation of nearly all industry and marxufaaturers. Due to present conditions only gold and other t&gt;recious metals are of value but the baser-metals are bound to increase in px*ice in the future, so this great counti*y should bo thoroughly examined for both precious and base metale. As stated in my report No.l of Rajab 15th 1350 (November 25th 1931) the recommendations contained therein are modified by experience and observations since that date. 1 will give my advice in the same sequence as written in that report.. I enclose a report by Ur. Moseley on the placer gold work don under his supervision. 1) vadua supoly . The water should have been flowing into Jedda by December iist 1931 as the windmill pump was operating on December 151 and the repairs to tunnel and pi © should have been completed if work ha been proceeded with as I directed. I reooffiiiend that efficient masons and labourers complete the repairs to the bottom of the tunnel near West Waziria Well. Repair the ttanel from the West to the East Well so water can flow through from East to West without loss; and the pipe line be repaired where it has been damaged. If any towers are stopped up I recoimend that 1 1 © spare Iron pipe in the condenser yard be used to pass the water by the tower. This will not be difficult. I have x&gt;reviously recommended (notes of Ramadhan 19th 21 st an 30th 1330 to H.£. Hamad Suleiman) this also, that all openings to the water systems be kept covered and locked. The lower cost and better quality of water will be a benefit to the people of Jedda. Bvery day the condensers work means unnecessary expense to the Government. I recommend that efficient man be put in charge of the water system and he should see that work is properly done. I wish it clear! understood that all I have advised has proved proctical; consumption c 38 gallons per minute is raised by the windmill in the average daily wind at no coat except for oil, depreciation of plant, and lntex*est in Investment.Ml inreitmmt* That water has flown Into Jedda proving th© tunnels and pipe line were in serviceable condition before being tampered with* I farther recommend that an 8 * diameter pipe line of steel or asbeatoa-cement pipe be laid from the end of the tunnel into the city of Jeclda when funds are available. The present pipes can be used for a yc ycwr or ^ore# If steel pipe is used It should hare two enpansion Joints in this distance. All pipe should fev&lt; laid at least 88 cm, below the ground serface so as to Insulate it from dally changes in temperature ami aa age from people 9 animals and cars passing over it. An 8 ” diameter would exceed the two present 5* diameter pipes by in area besides having leas loss of head due to friction. If more water is d sired I recommend that another windmill of the same type be erected at the West Waziria Well, , ^ f. 1 ?* Sas © n £iae driven centrifugal, or diaphragm pump can be instailed at .eat Wasiria Well to provide against a prolonged period of calm weather, A 4 h.p, engine will be ample for pumping an amount exceeding the present Jedda consumption. It will be most efficient and cost least per gallon pumped if it is installed in the well at the tu mel level with a large exhaust pipe extending above the surface, A sum of A,800,32 *111 ample to install either* windmill pump, diaphragm or centrifugal pump complete with engine, I have quotations from the Novo Sngine Company for both of the latter at less than 2500 P,A. 3 , Hew York, I recommend that the present tank capacity of 108 tons of water at Jedda city walls be enlarged to &lt;524 tons which is 1^ days supply as pres* ent maximum consumption. I recommend that No, 2 Empire drill be continued in use to develop ground water, Sayed Ahmad wh# has been working on this drill is compet ent to continue in charge of the locations are fixed for the drilling. Already two holes have been successfully in finding water near the i'ecca road at 14,3, and 19,1 kilometers from Jedda, No expenditure will be required for this work except for repairo. I recomraend that wells should be mude at the three places laentioned near Jedda and at other places along the Jedda-Riadh-Hofuf route as noted in my report No,2, Twelve 12 ft. diameter windmills on 40 ft, towers for wells of 15 ft. to 40 ft. deop were quoted lust July at #3,600,00, These would establish gardens and rest places which would benefit both the operators and travellers. Instalments or , a) Fra* tools for gardens developed by the 12 wlnd- #900,00, These could be paid for by the tenants in rented to them. b) iigricultural implements for al Hasa as noted in my No, 2 report and telegram to H,S, Abdullah duleiaan on January 28th 1932, I recommend that the following be purchased.

With cash in a Now York Bank I could obtain lowest prices for noth new and second hand material# I would not undertake to make any purchases under other conditions than these# This would be exclusive of tiie benzine required for the assay furnace and for the ouilding* An existing house could be found which could be cheaply re-arranged and adapted for this work* Mr* bos ley would be the engineer whom I would recommend to be in charge of this laboratory and work* He would require one educated assistant whom ho could train to do this kind of work also would require two good men to do the crushing and preparing of samples and who would take oare of the building* Mr* Mosley would return for one year on the following terms# Salary ^500*00 per month with all house and living expenses for himself and his wife, also naturally his first class transportation from Hew York and his return there* One other American Engineer would be required to take charge of the cleaning out and sampling the jain. B which I would iudge to be worthy of such expenditure* If the samples from bahad Dahab indicate sufficient value this would be where the first work would be done. If, say, one :aine per month were sampled then there would be twelve complete reports at the end of the year available for you and your government to judge the size and value of these mines* These reports would be the only basis on which to interest responsible American capital if you wish them to develop your iviineral resources* The engineer I have in ^aind fl&gt;r this work would require about the same conditions as br* bosley* He would need am educated man as assistant and an interpreter beaidea servants and cook* The programs!© X would advise would be as fallows X) On returning here on October I would study all available data regarding mines and decide on the location of the assay office and laboratory; also by this study I would determine my first mines trip* The location for the assay office would likely be at Yenbo or Wejh as being the most convenient place to which to send samples* 2) Mr* Mosley would arrange the building and inatal the equipment* 3) The assistant engineer would accompany mo to the Hah&amp;d Dahab where I would indicate the pra.^ramme of work to be done* The men, mining equip ment, food supplies and camp should have been arranged here while we were studying data at Jedda# 4 ) I would proceed to the other mining properties and decide on the next ones for my assistant to clean and thoroughly sample* I would also take indicative samples to be auc&amp;yed by Mr# Mosley so as to determine upon the most favourable places for the extended sampling* tty assistant would make complete reports including sample maps of each mine* 5) I would then proceed to direct road work as desired towards ill Hasaa* 6 ) Also would Instruct regarding windmills, pumps and gardens near Jedda and In ffejas and along the route to 11 Hasa if that work were afcthorlzod*?) At Haaa I would inatnaet the epx&gt;ointed officials and aen in the operation of a) The agricultural JUapleaenta and tools b) The pumps and gates for raising water ^ c) The cleaning of springs• 8 ) If desired would investigate the geology of 31 Hass more in detail re oil possibilities* 9 ) tould sake the survey for xfrr and harbour equipment a§ Rae Tonnura# 10) Return to Hejaz and gather the mining data* 11) If desired I would return to U«a#A* and present mining data with your your G^vernIa©nt , s terms for an American Company f or companies to develop your mineral resources* 12) The sets of mineral collections and booklets should be at once distributed to Ameers and director of Finances to organise and encourag prospecting in as many places as possible in your kingdom* Money or presents should be given for specimens found. I have made my recommendations amdestiraates now it is for you ff nri your government to make your decisions whether all, a part or none of my advice is to be adopted* I wish to emphasize the fact that only by efficient active- co-operation of all officials and men can the best results be obtained* Also that my terns are as noted in import Uo*l of Eajab 15th 1550 (November 35th 1931) and that all funds for all purchases authorised must be placed to the credit of my Hi^ass Account in the Guaranty Trust &gt; Company at 582 Fifth Avenue, New York, also funds for passages of personnel to and from New York with their salaries for twelve months, or the term they contract to serve# I know that responsible American capital will be interested to develop this country with you only if reliable reports are first submitted to them* I believe that great benefit to your country will result if my plans are vigorously carried out* I assure you I uith ay assistants will do everything possible to bring you success.

The six engineers who, as stated in Jedda despatch Ko.366 of September 12, were reported to be arriving wit} Mr.Twitchell, did not corns with him and there appears no immediate prospect of their appearance. Tbe party were accommodated in the Government guest-house at Jedda, which had been specially redecorated for them, and settled down for a stay of some months. The ^Umm-al-^ura’' newspaper had heralded their arrival by two long articles. The first, published in its issue of September 11, expatiated on Ibn da'tid^ preoccupation for the water supply of the Hejaz and related the history of the Hszirta wells, distant ll a kilometres from Jeddc on the Mecca hoad. These wells, it appears have been known since the time of Mustafa i’asha in 1640 and were opened up and connected to the town by a conduit by the Turkish ruler of the Hejaz, Oeman pasha, in 1882. They gave a regular supply until 1900, when they dried up. The second article, in the issue of October 2, gave a glowing account of the mineral wealth which had been known since/since ancient times to exist in the country, and a eulogy of the Xing who had conceived the idea of digging them up# -^ssages of encouragement had, it a jpeared, been received from othei XLoslem countries. After their arrival the two engineers proceeded to Taif, presumably to investigate further the traces of gold which, as reported in Appendix A to Jedda despatch No. 1565 of Sent ember 12th, were supposed to have been found in that neighbourhood. Mr. Twitchell returned after five days to Jedda, leaving ^r.Lxoseley with an interpreter at r faif, where he still remains; no information has transpired as to what success he has so far met with. At Jedda Mr .Twitchell has been chiefly concerned with the production of water from the Wazirfa wells mentioned above, Work has been proceeding since July on the old Turkish conduit under the supervision of Mr.Ousman, the British engineer in charge of the local sea-water distillery, and has recently resulted in a direct flow of water being achieved between the wells and Jedda. Mr.Twitohell had, moreover, brought with him a windmill water-pump, which he expects to be set up and working in the course of the next month. It is therefore probable th t the well-water will shortly be available for the use of the inhaoitants at a cost considerably less than that of condenser water, which will prove a very real boon, especially in the present time of economic depression. The condenser may be allowed to fall into disuse. Mr.Twitchell has also been envisaging a system of irrigation for the area immediately surrounding the town which will render it possible to lay out gardenstind thus relieve the present utter bsrrenness of the outskirts. In e nversation Mr.Twitchell has shown the greatest reticence as to his discoveries up to the present, and a disinclination to loot further than the next step ahead of him. ihe development of a mining industry, as he points out, consists of four successive stages, prospecting, sampling, setting up of plant, and organisation of transport. Of these only the lirst iu s as yet been touched ©n and no opinion can be pronounced until it has been completed. His attitude in this respect contrasts markedly with that of his hosts. The .king has shown the greatest interest in and encouragement of ur.Twitchell*activities, and the authorities concerned have extended to him assisttnce whicfy he describes as ’'prorqat, regular, and efficient', terms seldom heard of in the Hejaz. These unwonted official efforts on his behalf, combined with the tone of 3L1 the i^res ' articles which have aopeared in the 'Uram-al- ^ura'’, show the high hopes entertained by the Hejazi comment, and passed on to the people, of the results ox his investigations in providing a revenue additional to the pilgrimage for the country. It will be interest ing to see whether their disappointment at the lack of immediate outcome to his work will result in a back sliding from the standard of assistance which they have set themselves and the consequent disillusionment of the so far enthusiastic American, another former enthusiast, Ifr.philby, has gone that way.

Crane, to study water possibilities in the Hejas and apparently mining prospects as wall. My later Information confirmed my belief that the first of Mr. Twitchell’s journeys was confiBed to the immediate neighbourhood of Jedda. The second, however, was more extensive as will be seen from the enclose a translation of an article in the Umm-al- ura of May 16th. A few days after that date Mr. Twitchell returned to Jedda, submitted reporta and was, T believe, received by the King at a piece in the country between this and Mecca. He and his wife left Jedda about May 31at. 2. The inf rmation in the enclosed article regarding water was amplified by a long article in the Omm-al- ura of May 89th purportin to give the text of Mr. Twitchell'a main report on that branch of his Investigations* Mr. Twitchell came to people bemused by the blessed word Artesian, which leaps grate fully ts Arab lips, probably because it makes a perfectly beauti ful broken plural in Arabic irtiwaziya. That is doubtless why he begins his report by pointing out that an Artesian well Is one in which underground water rises under its own pressure, although not necessarily all the way to the earth's surface. He explains that this type of supply seldom or never occurs in the region he visited. He contemplate** the raising of water by ordinary His ajestyV Principal ecretary of itate for Foreign Affairs.2f7 ordinary pumping appar*tu® and suggests that tho prevalence of high winds would enable water to be pueped up from wella, which need not be very deep f at an extremely low ooat. He glvea a list of six areas or water points which he vialted and deals in some detail with two, the Wadi Umn al alam and the Iadi Fatma, in both of which he found abundant underground water which might be made available for agricultural uee. He augge&amp;ts that the plant* which might moat usefully be cultivated would be date palms, oranges, lemons, cotton of Lhe best quality, eucaly ptus, bamboo, beans, ground nuts and potatoes. He add^ that theii© are his personal suggestions but that, if it were desired to make experimental farms, the Ijepertment of Agriculture at /ashington would be pleased to $ ive advice and to supply suit able seede. 3. The report that gold end petroleum had been dis- dovered created a pleasurable flutter but details have not so far been published. Mr. ibilby told me a couple of weeks ago that the discovery of the^e minerals was merely a rediscovery of what was already known to exist. X am unable to check this with the means at my disposal here but it will doubtless be possible to do so in tondon. As regards petroleum Mr. lhilby referred vaguely to a passage in one of the wider works, he thought Hurton. In connection with gold he referred to a con- cetesion formerly granted to Midian (or Median) Ltd., a concern in which he said he had some little holding. 4* Mr. hilby added a statement of some interest. He said that not long ago the King had said in a moment of expan sion that he would grant a concession for all the minerals In the country to any one who would give him a million pounds. Mr. Philby then or later, according to his own account, asked whetherwhether the v lng aeant huelneas, in which oaae comethlng practi cal might he arranged, without plunging Into mllllona. On receiving a favour ble reply he had communicated with Hldlan Ltd., but had ateered the matter in auch a way that the further correapondenoe should be direct between the company and the Government here. 6 . /II thia tends to confirm what I bald in Para. 5 of my despatch under reference. *ven if Yr, Twltohell has only rediscovered previous discoveries, hia viait has had the effect of atlmulating interest in certain economic possibilities. I still doubt, however, whether Ibn a’ud will face up to the essential condition of any successful effort to determine what la economically exploitable and to render the exploitation a practical proposition, namely the employment of foreign experts, even trained experts of Arab blood, who might perhaps be found. All that can be said at present la that the possibility of his doing so cannot be excluded, as he la evolving rapidly under pressure of hie present difficulties. Meanwhile I understand that the question of developing new economic resources was one of those referred to the National Conference of representatives from Hejazl towns which sat in Mecca from Juns i nd to June 11th. X have reported elsewhere on this conference but do not as yet 'enow what it achieved. 6 . I am addressing this report to the Foreign Office &amp;b in the present state of this country the economic situation is even more closely connected with the general political situation than in more normal countries. I am, however, sending a copy to the department of Oreraaaa Trade. It would be useful to me to hewe any up-to-date Information In the possession of the Departaont regarding Mldlan Ltd.

(No. 162.) .ivV Sir, &gt; ' Jedda, May 4, 1931. IN paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 81 of the 6th March, relative to Mr. C. R. Crane's visit to\ledda, I mentioned an offer which he had made to Ibn Sand to arrange for the engineer whom he employs in the Yemen to visit this country to look into water possibilities. 2. The engineer in question is a United States citizen named Twitched, and is engaged on the construction of the new motor road, which is being made under Mr. Crane’s auspices from Hodeida to Sana via Hajaa. He arrived in Jedda on or about the 17th April with his wife, an Englishwoman, and was received by Ibn Saud on the 20th April. Since that date he and Mrs. Twitched have made two journeys inland. I tn have not been able to discover their range, but doubt whether thev have been far from Jedda. 3. On the 24th April the Mecca newspaper “ Umm-al-Qura ” produced a leading article headed “ Two Great Projects.” The writer, after rebutting, with the support of a citation from an Italian orientalist, the common belief in the barrenness of the Arabian Peninsula, refers to Ibn Sand’s efforts to improve the country in ad directions. He speaks, in particular, of two out of many schemes, namely, the sinking of artesian weds and prospecting for minerals, and says that for the former purposes the King has now brought an expert, who is making experiments in the vicinity of Jedda. This obviously refers to Mr. Twitched, whose visit is mentioned in the news columns of the same issue of the ‘ ‘ Umm-al-Qura. ’' 4. I have little doubt that a systematic survey for water would produce appreciable results in various parts of the country. I doubt, however, the King’s capacity for directing it with the necessary comprehension and perseverance, and still more his willingness to give any foreign expert a sufficiently free hand to achieve much. As for mining, the prospects are even more nebulous. Until the “Umm-al-Qura ” article appeared 1 had heard of no definite scheme, but when the Commissioner of Port Sudan was visiting here early in March Mr. Philby told him that the King had decided on a geological survey of the country, with a view, I gathered, to concessions being eventually given subject to suitable safeguards. 5. If Ibn Saud knows little about how to set about applying modern contrivances to the development of latent water resources, he is probably infinitely more ignorant of the difficulties surrounding the location and exploita tion of minerals in a country like this. In my opinion, the chief interest at present of the matters mentioned in this despatch is the indication they afford of an inclination on Ibn Sand's part to explore tentatively possibilities of economic development. However little grasp he may have of the conditions necessary to achieve real success in that direction, he is quite intelligent enough to realise the need for some new basis of prosperity if the country is to hold its own. So far as the Hejaz is concerned, its almost complete dependence on the pilgrimage as its sole industry is a patent source of weakness; and the weakness has never in recent years been so patent as during the present season, which has brought only some 40,000 pilgrims from overseas to Mecca. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the political resident in Aden, who is interested in Mr. Twitched, and to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c.

I discussed outstanding questions with Fuad and there v, T as no need to pursue them at this stage with the King. At long audience on June l?th he dilated on his general relations with Great Britain which Fuad had already discussed. The King intimated desire for some sort of permanent understanding. I am reporting fully by bag leaving tomorrow. Both Fuad and the King spoke about financial situation which is so bad that help must be sought in some quarter. The King put it like this. Exchange situation w r as in process of successful rehabilita tion. He needed also a bank which would serve under suitable arrangements the purpose of a state bank. He would prefer British institution though he had offers from other quarters. Could His Majesty’s Government help him to get one? If any British bank were disposed to consider the matter, would they send representative? Matter was urgent, as he must take early decision.I did not I promised to submit the question, exclude possibility of favourable answer, but hinted at difficulty. I do not in fact see on v;hat basis any British bank could undertake business except as a very risky experiment. The King may have Eastern Bank in mind as I believe it has been suggested to him. Other offers are probably nebulous but Egyptian Lutfullah Bank recently sent a representative here who may have made proposals.

His recent visit would appeal* to have X been arranged by Mr. Antonins, who was formerly employed in the Palestine 0 \\ Administration, and who assisted Sir G. Clayton here at various times from 192;) to 1928. I first heard of it from Mr. Philby’ shortly before I received a telegram ' from Sir John Chancellor on the subject. 3. Mr. Crane appears to have come specially from America to accomplish his personal visit to Ibn Saud. He arrived here on the 25th February and left on the 3rd March. He was accompanied by Mr. Antonins. He stayed, by his own request, at the house of a local notable who had entertained him in 1926. He saw a great deal of the King in one way or another, both by special arrangement and at functions. . .... 4. In 1926-27 Mr. Crane was mal vu in French and British official circles because of his association with Syrian revolutionaries. I have no full information on the subject, but my French colleague here tells me that, in his opinion, the French authorities took a rather exaggerated view. Fie seems to regard Mr. Crane as an amiable busybody, who makes oriental peoples his hobby and who* has money to burn, although he does not burn it as freely as he is sometimes expected to do. My own observation tends to confirm this. Mr. Crane called on me, and I entertained him a little during his stay without going beyond the courtesy which it is natural to show in this place to any distinguished visitor. He rode his hobby*a]l the time, caracoling from Turkey to the Far East, and he seemed to be merely an interested, though sympathetic, observer of experiments in uplift in the various countries. He dwelt greatly on the many things he had seen disappear “into history.'' 5. Mr. Crane is interested in the Yemen, and is said to be building a road 1 there from benevolent motives. His visit to Jedda was heralded by rumours that he was going to give or lend Ibn Saud a handsome sum of money. I have not yet heard what passed between them, except that, when the King drank tea at Mr. Philby’s on the 28th February, the conversation turned on artesian wells, and Mr. Crane offered to arrange for his engineer in the Yemen to call in at Jedda on his next voyage up the Red Sea to size up the possibilities of boring hereabouts. The King, who toys a good deal with the idea of finding new water in his Dominion, accepted the offer. The conversation, in which it was made and accepted and at which I was present, appeared to be quite accidental. I am sending copies of this despatch to the High Commissioner for Egypt, the High Commissioner for Transjordan and the political resident and Commander-in-chief at Aden. I have, &amp;c.

Section 1. [E 1385/93/91] No. 1. Mr. Bond to Mr A. Henderson.—[Received March 17.) (No. 57.) Sir, If ^ Jedda, March 2, 1930. WITH reference to paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 323 of the 19th December last, I have the honour to enclose a memorandum indicating the steps which have been taken up to date in connexion with a scheme for supplying Mecca and Jedda with electricity. The subject, which was first broached two or three years ago and lias occasionally been mooted since, is now being seriously canvassed. 2. The scheme is at present in its embryonic stages, and. although in its broad outlines it has received the approval of the King, its details still require royal sanction. It is, perhaps^ early yet, therefore, to consider it as a serious project. 3. I will, however, follow its development and will report again later if it shows signs of materialising. 4. It is stated that the Government intend to call for tenders in the usual way, but this may be nothing more than a stratagem to conceal the fact that the contract has already been promised or parcelled out in anticipation to interested persons. I have, &amp;c. W. L. BOND. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. Proposed Scheme for supplying Jedda and Mecca with Electricity, THERE is a movement on foot in the Hejaz, supported by the King, to establish a power-station for the purpose of supplying Mecca and Jedda with electricity. The supply of electricity for Jedda is at present dependent on a small plant of inadequate performance which works in conjunction with the condenser. The first step in the scheme was the appointment by the Government of a special committee of local notables, dubbed for this purpose “ experts,” for considering the scheme and estimating the benefits which would accrue from it. The committee met several times and decided, as a first step, that a public meeting should be held at which the decisions arrived at during its session should be announced. A general meeting was accordingly held on the 27th January at the Ministry of Finance in Mecca to which all the notables and others were invited. His Royal Highness the Emir Feisal was present and listened, with the rest of the audience, to a long, disjointed speech on the subject delivered by Sheikh Ahmed Ghazzawi, a member of the Committee for the Study of Projects of Reform. This sheikh, acting as spokesman for the committee, stated that the purpose of the meeting was to make public the decisions of the Government and of the special committee. After dwelling for some time on the interest shown by the King in this scheme in particular, and in all schemes in general tending to raise “ the prestige of this dear land to a level consistent with its holiness and purity,” the sheikh proceeded to enunciate these decisions as follows :— 1 1. A company is to be formed for the purpose of administering the scheme. Two-thirds of the shares are to be taken up by the Municipality of Mecca and the Ministry of Finance. 2. The remaining third of the shares is to be open to public subscription. 3. The price of these special shares (he., the remaining third) is to be £3 each. 4. Those who wish to subscribe must make an immediate deposit of one-third of the value of each share—£1 ; this will entitle them to effective participation in the scheme. [56 r—1]2 5. The rest of the money due on the shares is not payable until the managing committee of the company has been formed, all details of administration, &amp;c., settled, and effective measures taken to ensure a prosperous future for the company. 6. The managing committee is to be formed as soon as possible. /-*' 7. The managing committee is to be invested with the general control of the company and will watch over its interests and those of the shareholders. 8. Any proposals made by the shareholders concerning the future development of the company will be heard, and those that have the support of the majority of the shareholders will be adopted. The speech closed with an assurance that the Government will watch over the company ; and this, it was said, will necessarily ensure a golden future for it. The issue of the “ Umm-el-Qura ” of the 7th February contained a long article recapitulating what was said at the meeting and dwelling at length on the divers benefits which would accrue to the country from the scheme. The greatest, of these benefits would appear to be that the introduction of electricity would immediately cause a great reduction in the number of the various oil lamps and other lighting appliances which are at present imported into the country in great quantities, thus reducing the amount of money that leaves the country each year. The idea of reducing the amount of money which goes abroad annually is, in fact, very dear to the promoters of the scheme, and it is one of the main arguments they employ in endeavouring to enlist public support. The next step was the holding of a meeting in the Jedda Municipality, presided over by the Governor, to which all the notables and rich merchants of the town were bidden. The Minister of Finance came down from Mecca for the purpose of attending. A speech was read at this meeting in which Jedda citizens were urged to subscribe to the scheme, and were invited to follow the example of their colleagues in Mecca, who, it was stated, had made a splendid response to the call. A list was drawn up of the names of those who wished to subscribe. It is stated that lists containing names of the shareholders will soon be published. The general feeling about the scheme is that, if properly managed, it will be a success, but that the essential condition for this is European control in the engineering department. It is for this reason presumably that Bahra, which is outside the zone forbidden to non-Moslems, is suggested as the headquarters of the scheme. Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, who is, apparently, the moving spirit of the scheme, is considering also the engagement of a European as managing director to ensure the proper handling of the financial side of the concern; royal assent for this has, however, not yet been obtained. The chief drawbacks to the scheme as at present contemplated are, firstly, that the proposed capital of £60,000 will not suffice to cover the cost of any effective scheme, and, secondly, that the people have no confidence in the honesty of the Government’s intentions, and fear, for instance, that the Government will not pay for the power it uses. As the Government will probably be the largest consumer, this would be quite sufficient to wreck the scheme. The fate of the Saudieh Motor Company, a scheme which was launched in very similar circumstances, is fresh in the public memory. The public is showing little enthusiasm in taking up the shares offered and is awaiting further developments before committing itself. If the idea comes to anything, the towns of Mecca and Jedda are likely to consume an amount of current out of all proportion to their size. The population is by temperament and by custom inclined when they can to use a number of lights greatly in excess of normal requirements, and there would certainly be a strong popular demand for cheaper electricity if it became available.ISBBit Notes.

The correspondence, most of which is between Foreign Office officials and either the British Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan, succeeded by Sir Reader William Bullard) or His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires at Jedda (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill, Albert Spencer Calvert, and Alan Charles Trott), relates to the economic development of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd (later Saudi Arabia). Other correspondents include the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle) and officials of the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.The opinion expressed by British correspondents near the beginning of the file is that the unsatisfactory state of the country's finances is a result of its complete dependence on the pilgrimage for income. Much of the file is concerned with various projects (such as water and mineral surveys) sanctioned by Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] in order to explore other sources of revenue.Items of discussion include the following:News that Ibn Saud intends to establish a power station for the purpose of providing Mecca and Jedda with electricity.Ibn Saud's wish to establish a state bank, preferably a British bank, to improve the financial situation in the country.Four reports on the country's water and mineral resources, produced by American engineer and geologist Karl Saben Twitchell in 1932 (copies of three of the four reports are included).The British Minister at Jedda's thoughts on how the economic unification of the newly-formed Saudi Arabia will progress.Proposed improvements to Jedda's water supply.The establishment of an 'Arabian Steam Navigation Company' by the Saudi Government.Details of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate's concession with the Saudi Government for the exploitation of gold and other minerals, which was negotiated by Twitchell, signed in December 1934, and ratified by Ibn Saud in February 1935.Reports of anti-Ibn Saud propaganda in the Indian Muslim press.Details of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate's activities in Saudi Arabia.The history of the Ahrar movement in India, its political party, Majlis-i-Ahrar-i-Islam, and its reported condemnation of the recent Saudi mining concession.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Karl Saben Twitchell</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mining</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000267#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
