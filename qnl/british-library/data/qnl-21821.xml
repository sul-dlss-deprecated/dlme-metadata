In theory this delay will be to enable enquiries to be made but for present it is unnecessary to refer individual cases by cable to Ministry of Shipping, object being simply to assert difference of status between ships qualifying for Warrants and those not so qualified.

On receipt dT these particulars Ministry of Shipping will in each case decide after appropriate consultation where necessary whether facilities should be giver or withheld. Oeneral intention is not to withhold faci lities unless there is specific reason to discriminate against particular owner or charterer, but it in intended to involve owners or charterer, but it is intended to involve owneis and charterers in such amounts of delay as may be necessary to per suade them of advantages of possessing Ship Warrant* XX XX X X XSQMFID^Ti •!.

There is reason to believe that eaemy exports are being carried to Japan in special service ship ASAKA of Imperial Japanese Wavy, formerly merchant ship ''S/KA MAPI! which left Bilbao on March 17th. 2. Although Japanese Government have been informed by Fis Majesty's Government that they cannot agree to her calling at a British port unless -Ahe submits to examination for enemy exports, t^e Japanese Government have mentioned possibility of ship fueling at Colombo. It is also conceivable that she may call at an Indian port. If she does Captain should be informed that in view of above cnranunication to Japanese Government no facilities can be given to ship nor can we agree to her remaining in port unless she is willing to undergo examination for enemy 1 exports. An inmediate report should be made to Uommander-in- JChief, East Indies, the Flag Officer Conmanding, Royal Indian ihavy and to the Secretary oi State for India. Pending other directions no fuel or 6tner facilities should be given and per- inission should not be given for officers or crew to land nor for any communication with land even with Japanese Consular Representative. If ship calls at a port within your jurisdic tion where it is not convenient to examine her this fact should be stated in the report mentioned above. 3. Similar instructions have already been issued by Admiralty and have no doubt already been received at ports where there are Naval Officers in Charge. 4. The case is one of special importance required to be handled with particular care. () To Prin cipal Offi- 5.
