The authority of the ^ali of Khasab who is the representative of Kuscat, is acknowledged generally within the whole of this area. The ohihuh do not all acknowledge one bhaix-ch. The ohaixdi of iQiasab is probably the iaost influen- cial,. next comes Xtie ohai^h of Dibba and then follow several smaller shaiidiaoms such as Kumzar bjia Shaam. The former Shaikh of ^Cnasab was Hassan bin Ilohanjiiad bin S'.leiman of BuJcha. This man Wr-s removed in 1930 and one ohai-h. ^ihmad bin Kohammad, also of Bujcha, appointed in his ^lace. Shaikh Ahmad died in 1931 and ..as replaced by one Kilai bin Ali, also of Bukha, but not related to the late Shaikh Hassan. The Shaikh of Dibba (Shihuli) was Saleh bin .Itlobainmad who died o.ast year and ..as succeeded by Zaid bin Sman of xCumzar. The Shaiich of Dibba oasimi is Rashid bjtn Ahnad bin Sultan, related to t. e shaikh of iias al iChaimah. During the life time of uhaikh Saleh the bad characters amongst the Shihuh were kept under some control and trouble between two villages was not very serious. On the death of Saleh, however, the new Shaikh Zaid fell under the influence of bad characters amongst whom tne most prominent of four men named Qudoor bin udoor, Ali bin Salim Mulkesh, Swaid bin Salim his brother, Khadim Saleh Abdoon.RAID UW DlBBA f AS IMi.

In such a way as to have committed us to recognising him as having any overlordship over South Pi'oba , or over the South Dibba- Kalba area, that is to say, the Shamailiyah Tract to which reference is made in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer Volume I, Part I, pages 777-784. 5. I am also to request that a copy of any letters on this subject which may have passed between the Political Agent and the Council of negency ( or with^riighness the SultanJ at the time of or subsequent to the Darbar held in honour of the accession of His Highness the present Sultan may be sent (with the isnglish and irabic versions) with your reply.

Sir, With reference to your No•2136/14/221 of 19th September 1934 I have the honour to state that no corres pondence appears to have taken place between this Agency and His ^ighness the Sultan or his Government on this subject as the result of Mr. Stewart's memorandum under reference, nor is there any record of any verbal discussions having taken place committing us to recognising the Sultan as overlord of Dibba. » * V / 1P^ 2. Prior to the receipt of Mr^ Stewart's letter, Cap tain Alban had compiled a short note on the Sheikhs of Khasab and Dibba which w£s forwarded to you under cover of this office No.C/137 of 14th June 1933. This information was apparently acquired verbally by Captain Alban from the Muscat Council of Ministers. 3. I took the opportunity recently of tactfully en quiring from His Highness as to what had actually trans pired when Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad fled to Muscat early in 1932 and begged the Sultan's protection. His Hicrhnp*® S. G. P. I.—247 f. A A H. B. m. Consul Muscat—#12.11 500 # 0 ^j-gnnessstates that he refused to afford Hashid any protection unless he put it in writing to him that he definitely owed allegiance' to no one and wished to come under Muscat protection. On his doing so the Sultan afforded him the protection of his flag and Kashid from time to time has written him informal personal letters on general topics. 4. The Sultan, whilst admitting that he had written letters to Hashid (which from his description of the contents are obviously those forwarded under your above quoted number), states that he has never sought to bring Rashid under Muscat influence or to claim him as a vassal. It was Rashid on the contrary who sought 'protection' and made the overtures. 5. Dibba itself comprises in reality two villages one occupied by the Shihuh, who are His highness's subjects and the other by the Qawasimi who are dependants of Sharjah The Shihuh occupy practically the whole of the north of the Masandurn Peninsula north of Dibba, which area belongs to the Sultan. 6. His Highness actually at the moment contemplates writing a letter to Rashid telling him that as he is not his vassal nor is Rashid's protection a matter of interest to the Sultan that he (Rashid) had better apply in future for protection to his own proper overlord. 7. as there would seem to be no objection to such a proposal I have not advised the Sultan to the contrary. His action would certainly seem to afford an excellent means of clearing the atmosphere.

I crave the Alniignty to let us both have condolence over his death. I have succeeded my father in governorsnip ana pray to God to let us both enjoy the best of luck. Please do not discontinue corresponaing with me. I am prepared to do anything of which you may stand in need. Usual inaing.V Ov w\ A-M- K &lt;5. Thanics : a very helpful note. But I do not think that it is necessarily correct to say that the Sultan is de facto overlord of South Dihba. We do not know how far the bultan has moved in the matter 9 or what the P.A. written or said to him. The first thing is to find out from the P.A. whfehher he has verbally or in writinc: ed to the Sultan committiag us to stating/that South Bihha is a fief of &lt; his. Issue/ draft. 2. In case feiais no reply is received before Gol.Powle's return,! should add that apart from other considerations I have in my mind that possibly this may be the solution of the Kalba dispute - if we help Sharjah he must give us the facilities we require. Possibly the best course provided that we have not been committed to celling the Sultan that South Dibba is under him , is to apply to Sharjah for air facilities in the Shamailiyah Tract,thereby getting whatwe want and recognizing his overlordship at the same time and presenting a fait accompli to Muscat. But we must Know the actual position first. 9^ Cv 12.9.34 r&gt;p v rU, y c &gt; N * P-&amp; l&amp;u ( ' . ^ fio- 3./3/ I v</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000101_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/284</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000101</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/284</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'B Series.
