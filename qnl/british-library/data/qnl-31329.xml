I now enclose copy of a letter dated 21st January from the Foreign Office with enclosures concerning the impending visit of the Siamese Saval Transport M Angthong n to Italy for the purpose of taking- delivery of more new war vessels which have been constructed in that country for the Siamese Uavy. You will note that crews are being sent from Siam to man the new warships and that on the journey to Siam calls will be made at Cherbitat (presumably Fcas Sharbatat) and/or Murbat (a reference to the latter being made in paragraph 1 of the Siamese State Councillors letter of 26th December, 1936). 3* In connection with the earlier visit referred to in paragraph 1 above, it was stated that the vessels merely desired to take shelter at Murbat for the purpose of transferring fuel. Presumably the forthcoming visits will be of a similar nature, necessitating merely a formal notification to the Muscat Government. Unless you see any objection, please instruct the political Agent, Muscat, to take action similar to that reported in his telegram Ho.218 of the 26th December 1935, and telegraph when he has done so. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. (Sgd.) M. J.
