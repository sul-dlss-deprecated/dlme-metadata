I think there is no doubt that the Muscat Levies were, until a few days ago, the most costly body of fighting men in the world. Neither in civilised nor uncivilised countries will you find a force having every third or fourth man a K.C.O. A to xaxs serve 26 N.G.Os and 102 other ranks there were 54 followers, -t^ay . Everywhere, since the war, rates of pay have steadily come down in sympathy with the reduction in cost of living; here however each successive Levy Commander, beginning with iptam, J.R.L.oradshaw, Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bu shire.7 with Eccles and ending with. Walter, nas increased the cost of the Corps while reducing its effective strength as a fighting unit. The first added G .G.ray at Indian Army rates, the second raised the G.G.jt-ay to nearly three times Indian Army rates and raised the pay of already overpaid and pampered non combatants, the third and last while making some economies at the last moment, increased the number of menials and non-combatants and made some more promotions to an already over-crowded N.C.O.staff. Kone of these increases appear ever to have received the sanction of the Council nor does it seem as if they were even consulted# 6. In conclusion it might be observed that good 'chits' from high Naval and Military officials, smartness of drill and turn out and a good morale can just as easily be obtained for a reasonable sum as for an unreasonable one. I cannot agree with walicer when he says that the men's morale will suffer if their pay is reduced,t%c man in receipt of a good wage should lacic morale and in any case morale depends on the officer^ personal character and the way he manages the men rather than on filling their pockets# 7# The Levy Corps is now properly staffed, organised and paid# The men are more satisfied than before as they know that things are settled down and no more changes are likely. The Council is satisfied that they are now receiving value for money paid# On a full yea^s wording, the Corps as it stands, will cost the State not more than Hs#85,000. This is a fair charge at all times^and has no reference either to the prosperity or the poverty of the State# It is hoped that all new enlistments will take place at Ks.20/- per month# Please tell the Political ilesident how sorry I am to have caused him any annoyance over not obtaining his approval to the reductions in pay first. As it happened, the moment was exactly right and any delay which might have been causedcaused by reference, would have spoiled the atmosphere.

Sir, ifour most obedient servant, Captain, PelltlsaO. Acent 4 H.B.M's ConauX.Confidential Ho ,487-3 of 19 31. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the let August 1931. From - The Hon^le Meg or ^ .C.W.ffowle, C.B. j S,, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla* Sir, In continuation of my telegram Ho.357, dated the 13th June 19 31, I have the honour to attach herewith the budget of the Muscat state for the year 1931, forward ed to me by the Political Agent, Muscat. 2* The outstanding fact in this budget is that in December of this year ( the Muscat financial year runs from January to December ), the State, if the forecast is correct, will balance its expenditures with its receipts including the repayment of the Government of India loan for 1931 of Rs.43,000. This is being effected, as will be seen, by drastic economies.3 The 'budget is made up of (a) actual receipts and easpenditures for tlie first 6 months of 1931 ( Januaiy to June ) and (1)) the estimated receipts and expenditures for the second half of the year ( July to December)• 4. The second outstanding fact is that it has been prepared, as Captain Alban pointed out in his covering letter, by the Council itself, that is to say largely by Saiyid Said. Mr. Hedgcock left Muscat on 12th June, and when he was here from the 8th to 21st July informed me that before he left, the budget had not yet taken form though the material was there. Saiyid Said had of course the advantage of Mr. Hedgcocl^s figures and advice before the latter left Muscat, and I presume it embodies Mr. Hedgcock's main ideas, but much credit is, I think, due to Saiyid Said for the prompt way in which he has tackled Ghe problem. Captain Alban is silent as to his own share in the work, but I have reason to believe that Saiyid Said has had his advice, assistance and encouragement. 5. Our main concern in Muscat finances is three fold: (1) That the State should be able to pay back its debt to the Government of India; (2) That enough funds should be provided to keep up the Muscat Levy at suitable strength aoi at suitable efficiency. The principle under lying the latter is that as the Muscat state depends on naval and - in a crisis - on military .../ -3- military assiBtance from the Government of India, the latter has the right to insist that the State should make reasonable preparations in its oto defence. This right, however, covers not only the lump sum to be devoted to the upkeep of the Levy, but the headings under which it is to be spent: what is to be the pay of the men, what their rations, how much to be spent on arms and ammunition, re-armament when necessary, and so forth, since it is on items such as these that the efficiency of the Levy depends* Haturally the representations of the State, particularly in times of financial stringency, will be given due and ssmpathetic weight, but in the last resort the State must in this matter act according to the wishes of the Government of India. (3) That the State pays its way. Even after the Government of India loan has been liquidated, and even if sufficient funds are allocated for the upkeep of the Levy, we cannot afford to see the State slide into financial disintegration through Inability to meet the other claims of its administration. We cannot afford to see this for two reasons: one, because the State is of political and strategical importance to us, and sedoxnd, because amongst its debtors are sure to be a number of British Indian creditors. ^Provided, however, the State preserves its solvency, and fulfils conditions (l) and (2) above, while naturally we are interested in promoting ....II li iH&gt; ■fe. kSmBhajv .. ■ $ -4- promoting its prosperity as much as possible, 4 ( Yide for instance the action we have taken in trying to get permission from the ifrench and ikmerl cap. (jovernments for the State to raise its customs dues ), and while our views are always at its disposal, we are not - unlike as regards the Levy JSxpenditure - particularly concerned with, though still keeping an eye on, details. We may think that the State would do better to spend more in this direction or less in that, hut our interest is confined to friendly advice. 6. So much recently, inevitably of a detailed nature, has 'been written on the financial condition of Muscat, that I thought it advisahLe to take this opportunity of reiterating what I imagine to he the first principles of Muscat finances as far as we are concerned. To apply those first principles to the present budget. With regard to (1) - Government of India loan. It will 'be noticed that the State has included in its budget repayment of the two instalments for this year. This is not absolutely necessary as in regard to these instalments the State was granted a moratorium by Oovemment as well as for that due in December last ( vide S'oreign and Poli tical i vn w ^ ^Department letters Ho.3719-ir/30,dated 10th September 1930 and ]Jo.i , .55-U/31, dated the mh May 1931). However, if the State is able jut at the end of the year to pay up these instalments so much the better, and if not it can take advantageadvantage of the moratorium. 8* With regard to (3) - Government expenditure excluding that on the Levy* I have little comment to make. The most useful comment I could make would he in the nature of a detailed analysis as to whether Muscat finances for this year will in reality work out according to the budget forecast• This I confess quite frankly is beyond me, and I imagine beyond anyone else. One of the chief factors for instance is the price of commodities, since the principal revenue of the State depends on its jid valorem customs dues. Another is the dollar ( Maria Theresa ) exchange. Prices have not fallen, I believe, since last month, but whether they will again concinue to fall, or remain steady, or will rise, is beyond all prophesy. The same holds good with regard to the silver exchange. We must simply wait and see. I am. asking Captain Alban to obtain from the Council monthly s and let me have a brief statement of the working of each month, beginning with that for July, which I will forward to you on receipt. We will then automatically be kept informed of the financial progress of the State. 0ne of general expenditure may be noticed: the cut in the allowances of the Ruling family (C iyii i.ist). on this subject some correspondence has taken Place between Colonel Biscoe and aovemment ( vide paragraph 5 of Colonel Biscoe•s letter Ko.395-8, dated 1st August 1930). In the attached budget it will be noticed that a small reduction has been made. On this subject the Political Agent ...,-6« Agent says: u As regards the out of in the civil list on u those draining Hs.100 and more, this may ^e dis- M counted as of no value, it is only a gesture and M does not affect the ultimate budget by more than u a thousand rupees, u At the special desire of His Highness the Sultan M the allowance of Saiyid itedir, Saiyid Thajato ( a remittance man in JParis, forbidden ever to w return to Muscat ) and a number of others on the w list are untouched, nhile an aged relative has M been added to it at Rs,9b/- per mensem. 11 Ihe civil list is a question to be left alone u now, its members, if pressed too far could malce M things exceedingly unpleasant both for His u Highness and his son'. I think for the present we can leave it at that» 10# The explanation of the sultan^ varying allowances ( 4 months Hs. 10,000, 6 months Hs.5,000, and 2 months Hs.7,000) is as follows. J'rom January to April inclusive His Highness was in receipt of his full allowance; Hs. 10,000. iprom then on this was reduced to Rs.5,000 ( vide Government of India telegram Ho»893-S of 26th March 19 31). His Highness proposes' \1 i to return to Muscat in November ( vide Colonel Biscoe^ - ^ Express Letter lsio.256-S of 12th May 1951) and for that month, and for December, Saiyid Said has provided Hs.7,000. His Highness once in residence can of course claim his full Rs.10,000 but he may - in view of the financial straits of the State - be willing to forego Rs*3,000 per mensem, and doubtless Saiyid Said has consulted him on the subject. In any case the matter can stand over for the time being. With regard to (2) - Expenditure on the Levy. Ihis is the subject which needs most attention, and it may be as well to reriew some general considerations before comingcoming down to details. First - what is the object of tlie jj t Levy ? TJiis was indicated in paragraph 5 of Colonel Biscoe^ X letter Ho*85,T of 27th ftovmher 1930, which received the approval of the Grovermaent of India( Foreign and JPolitical Department letter Mo.dated the 9th March 1931), 5?he ohje ct of the iievy is to guard Muttrah and Muscat from attacks of Omani raiders, and to occupy temporarily head quarters of out-districts in an etaergency. It will thus be seen that the Levy is not a scattered irregular body on tribal lines uhose object is to protect roads through tribal territory, as for instance the Khassadars do on the Horth West Frontier,but a compact,, regular or semi-regular, well- trained, well-armed ( the Levy has machine guns), and disciplined force of men - the only disciplined body in the whole State. Such a body must obviously be worJced hard to Jceep up its standard of efficiency and paid well to attract a good stamp of men, which is particularly necessary as the force is only a small one. There can be no comparison between the local ♦♦askari' (state soldier), untrained arti undisciplined, and the Levy sepoy, and any arguments ( Saiyid Said mentioned them to me once or twice when I was in Muscat ) based on such a comparison are of course fallacious. As long as a semi-regular force like the Levy is considered necessary at Muscat so long the rate of pay must be adequate to keep it up to the required standard. if at any time such a force is considered unnecessary then the logical course ot action is to disband the Levy and employ askaris in its Place. what is quite out of the question is to have a force called a Levy at Muscat which by reason of low pay will degenerate.8- degenerate into a mob of *aslcari8 tt . The difflciilty is of course to strike the Jiappy mean 'between over - and under payment • ^2. Bearing these factors in mind we have to consider whether in the enthusiasm for economy too 'big cuts have - or have not - 'been made in the Levy JSxpenditure. 13. With regard to numbers. The Levy strength now stands at Commandant ... 1. Indian Officers . 3 K. C. 0s 9 • 21 Rank and file .. 106 Followers ... 12 The total fitting strength is 130,i.e. 20 ahort of vhe ir minimum ( 150 ) laid down - vide Government of India letter y Ho.j?.19-}^/31 of 9th March 1931. In your i^xprese Letter of 15th May 1931 it was laid down that f vacancies of men cutting their names should not be filled for the present, which meant that the Government of India contemplated that for a time the Levy should be under strength. According to the present budget the strength of the Levy will apparently remain as it is up to December of this year. I will ask Captain Alban to consult the Council of Ministers as to what prospect there is of the State being able to bring the Levy up to full strength before that date. 14. Ho alteration has naturally been made in the budget with regard to Headquarters Staff which consists of 0I1£&gt; ...one British Coramandant and 3 Indian Officers. former post is temporarily yaoant as a measure of economy as arranged 'by Colonel Biscoe with yon* 15» The number of H. C.

I will ask Captain Alban for his views as to whether they are sufficient as a permanent measure for the needs of the Lery original pay of the rank and file was Rs # 50/- # In March, after Colonel BiacoeU visit to Muscat, it was cut down to Hs.28/-with the proviso that if further financial stringency demitoded it, a further cut should be made later. J&gt;ay has now been reduced to Rs.2b/-,and 5 new men-10- ^ I men have, it yd 11 'be observed, been recruited on Hs,20/- The arrangement of men serving along each other, doing the same -work but drawing different rates of pay is not very satisfactory, though it has, I believe, occurred in the Indian Army, and Rs.20/- represents a very drastic cut: one-third of the original rate. It is of course ciuite possible to get men of some sort at Hs. 20/-; or less: but in view of the considerations put forward in paragraph 11 abo^e, I feel doubtful whether this pay will be adequate to attract the right stamp man, or will be sufficient to induce them to work hard if they actually enlist. I am bringing this poinu also i.o the notice of Captain Alb an, and on receipt of his views will again address you. In the meantime I am instructing him that no more men at as. 20/- are to be enlisted without reference to me. 18. Rations. The allotment for rations for the remaining 6 months in the year is only Rs. 3,000 - which is distinctly inadequate compared with the original allotment for this purpose. Rations are of course an important item fiom the point of view of a Levy sepoy. It may be, however, that there is a stock of surplus rations over from the previous 6 months. I am making enquiries on this point. 19# Arms and Armament. The Levy is at present armed with two makes of rifles - 40 modern fc.M.L.js. and the remainder old non-charger loading magazine Lee infields. Unifozmity is obviously necessary and as funds permit the Levy should be re armed with the newer weapon, and also have a sufficient reserve of anummltion for mergenoies and musketry training. The ....^ 2 Maxim guns 1 Lewis gun. The former are reported to Toe of M Tery doubtful efficiency H , and if so should presumably 'be returned to store and new ones purchased as funds permit. The amount allowed under ♦♦Aims and Ammunition M Rs-1300/- is obviously inadequate to fo pro-vide for any sort of re-armament, as well as^build up a. reserve of ammunition, but I suppose this is all that is available for the moment* 20. The other items in the Levy Expenditure do not seem to call for any comments. 21. SUMMARY . The outstanding fact of the Muscat budget is that - if the forecast is correct - it will balance by next December, which is the end of the Muscat financial year, including repayment of the Government of India instalments for this year (paragraph 2 above). To a certain extent it has been made up by the Council: i.e. Saiyid Said,( with the advice, assistance and encouragement of Captain Alb an), who deserves credit for the prompt way he has tackled the problem (paragraph 4). The first principles of our concern in Muscat finances are reiterated in paragraph 5. as the State has made out a prima facie case for fulfilling conditions (l) and (3) laid down in that paragraph^vi.e. repayment of the Oovernment of India loan and solvency by ghe end of the year - we are not much concerned with the details of non-Levy expenditure (paragra|4is 8-10) # Vk can only r•I 2~ only wait and see if the forecasts made by the state prove correct, and in the meantime the Government of India will receive monthly reports from the Political Agent, Muscat, i ) through me showing what piogress is being made (paragraph 8). we are, however, concerned in the details of the Levy Expenditure for the reasons given in paragraph 5 (3), ard the arguments for paying the Levy a good wage are set forth in paragraph 11 • It is possible that in the enthusiasm for econoiny too drastic cuts both in the matter of pay (paragraph 17), and rations (paragraph 18) may have been made. Provision of funds for arms and ammunition and re-amament must also be considered (paragraph 19). I am sending Captain Alb an a copy of this despatch and am asking for his views in detail on all the points raised in connection with Levy economies (paragrajahs 13 ai3d 15-19), On receipt of his reply I will address you again on this subject.

You will see from ay despatch what the general pr nciples are underlying our concern in Muscat finances, ana that we are of course specially concerned in the x»eTy Expenditure ( paragraph b of ay despatch )• With regard to the Levy there are - as 1 see it • ta&amp; problems: iii 10 oarr &gt;' on under the preeent clrcuaetances of acute financial atringency in the utate, eomehow or other, to the end of the year. iJU.

This standing budget will, if State finances permit, come into force from January 1932. 4. With regard to U) I hare three comments to make. One is on the subject of the rations for which only Rs^^OOO is allowed for the remainder of the year. This seems inadequate ( paragraph 18 of my despatch to the Foreign Secretary). Please explain. 5# The other comment is on the pay of the Indian Officefs # in which cats have been made as ftollows: Old Scale ( see Appendix to P.A.» Muscat^letter No.83-C of Hew scale. 25th March 1951).

( paragraph 14 of my despatch). his lias consisted up to date of 1 British officer, and 3 Indian Uifleers. Do you suggest any changes ? xhe question of the Commandant is a difficult one. on the one hand 9 uhere is no doubt that the Xievy will lie more efficient with a British officer in charge, and that the Levy has to attain a fairly high degree of efficiency is pointed out in my letter to the foreign Secretary ( paragraph 11 of my despatch). Also in ease of actual hostilities it mould cert inly be preferable to have the Levy commanded by a British Officer. on the other hand a British Commandant is undoubtedly expensive. If he holds the ranJc of Captain. which he normally does, he coats the State • with pension contribution b - close on He. 18,000 a year. Pleaue do not consult the Council, or anybody else, on this point. orTthe awrt (Indian officers). as to the other points you aay use your diseretlon. i 9 ' iSiiiMof.acerB.( paragraph 14 of ay despatch).

The sum of KS.3J00 allotted for ralions for the luscat Infantry in ttie revised Budget, is not for the remainder of the year, as you have stated, 'but for the whole year® The Muscat Infantry Rations consist^ of 1-g lbs of atta per diexa, the cost of which per man is about Rs.i/14 monthly# The Budget ration strength stands at 124* Allowing Rs. 2/- monthly for rations, the yearly expenditure will be as follows - 124 x 2 x 12 s Rs. 2,976 or, in round figures Rs.3000 per annum# This amount will be sufficient, as, although the strength of the State Infantry was a little greater before the re-organization than after owing to the unusual number of IT.C.Os., yet, during the year all the men have enjoyed 24- months leave during which time no rations were drawn# There is a sufficient balance of the budget allotment remaining to meet the cost of rations for the remainder of the year. 3. Your paragraph 5. The cuts made in the ^ay of the Subadar Major and Jemadar Adjutant are in order.(a) oubadar Lajor Fatah IQian, was promoted Subadar Kajor by me in 1922, previously to that he had been Jeniadar Adjutant at a salary of* Rs»200 per mensem which, as he arrived from Siatan Holding that post, is presumably also his contract rate of pay. fou will thus see that even after the revision of pay he is still in receipt of Rs.llS over and above his contract rate# (b) The Jemadar Adjutant, Mohamed Ibrahim, is not seconded from the Indian Army as stated in your para 5, he was discharged before talcing service here, and accepted his cut in the same way as all other State servants* 4. Your paragraph 6 (para 13 of your despatch)# The Council of Ministers are definitelyopposed to any increase m expenditu re during the currency of the present budgets 5. Your paragraph 7 (para 11 of your despatch)• The future of the Corp s, its qdj ec t and composition .vmich are the most important points of all ; appear te have been de» cided by you. I venture to remark though that i do not consider the Huscat Infantry to be the most advantageous or economical form of defence force for a State lilce this&gt; nor does the Council appear to have been consulted on these most important points. With regard to the details enumerated in para 11 of your despatch, I may remark that the Muscat Infantry is by no standard a well trained force of men. During the period of command by Captain *7alker I am informed that no field training of any sort w^s carried out and as this is the only sort of training which is reaily necessary, it appears that they are now untrained. Again the Corps, is said to be 11 we 11 armed (the Levy has machine guns)' 1 , on enquiry it is discovered that during the whole tenures of Captain Stephens and his successor^Captain Walker, a period of 5 years, the machine guns were fired once during Captain Stephens 1 time, during Captain talker's time they were not fired at all. From this the value of the training which the Huscat Infantryacquired during ui.e a'bcve period can be accurately guaged. The Subadar iv.ajor is now engaged in ma icing good these deficiencies. 6. Your paragraph The ansv/er to this question must, I thinic, depend upon the character of the Fina ncial Advise r, some people migiit not 'be prepared to take ever both duties while others might feel that the Command of the Defence force gave them an added authority in carrying out their finance duties. If, however, it is ever decided to obtain a separate Oommandant, then, I would like to record my opinion, based upon the recent investigations with the administration of the Corps by the late Commandant and his predecjBsssr, that seconded Army Officers do not meet the requirements of 'the State, per obvious reasons an officer is required who knows Arabic, Captain Walker did not knew any Arabic, the Commandant should also be able to administer the Corps economically, he should Know the country and the market rates of pay for suitable men. He should be a man who has experience of Levy Corps and police in other Arab countries, Iraq, Transjordania, Palestine, etc and lastly^ he should not cost the State as much as Hs.1,800 per month which is the average cost of an Indian Army Officer® I think a man on the same rates of pay as Captain Parke, Commandant of Police at Bahrain, would be the most suitable. Captain Parke's salary, as far as I remember, commences at Hs.800 p.m. and rises by increments of Rs.30/- per annum. 7. Your paragraph y. I agree with you that three Indian Officers are necessary at present, the new Command ant, however, should be allowed full discretion in this. 6. Your paragraph 10. The scale of h.C.Os . is correct for the present organization and sufficient for a strength of 150 men, the proportion is the same as in the Indian Army. As long as the organization of the corps remains unchanged the scale of K.C.Qs. should not vary y a decrease4* would mean under staffing and an increase would mean extra vagance. 9• Jour paragraph. 12« As the Corps may quite possibly change its formation and character in the future one cannot lay dovm permanent measures, as long, however, as the Corps retains its present formation, the number of followers will be adequate. Should a large garrison •f 100 rifles or so x be kept for long period in an out station it may be neces- A sary to engage an extra Bhisti temperarily. 10. Your paragraph 13 (para 17 of the despatch), ray. For suggested pay of Commandant , if he is not the financial Adviser, please see my para 6 above. as regards 2T.a,0s» and men . The^e are men who, normally, if they did not go into the Kuacat Infantry, would see^s; employment ©.s labourers, sailors, pearl fishers, camel drivers etc. These various employments orfer no permanence, a great deal of unemployment exists and the wages are very low. To quote some instances • Juma, a Mcit^rah Baluch, who was Havildar Major in the Muscat Infantry, drawing, with G.G.pay Rs. 75/- p.m. (old rate) plus free rations, has, for ti.e last 2 years, been glad of several days coolie work a month at 45-^0 Baizas a day that is as 2-1-5 approximately per diem or about Rs.S per monthjif employed 30 days. Swede Nasib, the Havildar in charge machine guns tooic his discharge about a year ago and has been seen in I letter ah carrying mud for building at 5 annas per day, his pay in the Muscat Infantry having been Rs•50 per mensem plus rations. A third man called Juma, who is a good bugler, is a Customs coolie at annas 2-%~5 per day, having been drawing Ks.30 p.m* plus rations with the JJuscat A niantry. A fourth by name, Shahmurad, who drew Rs.30 p.m. plus rations has, after months of unemployment, obtained work carrying mud at Baizas 80 p.d® (As.5). A Havildar from Gwadur, who was rash enough to resign at5. the first cut in the pay of the Muscat Infantry ha» 'been out of work ever since and has repeatedly applied to the Subadar ].aj or to be tai-cen 'baclc at Rs.20 p.m. The Subadar Jajor and myself have both been ap^rcached by these men and others for employment, the last named haviidar, who I understand r was the only man rash enough to resign, has now asked to come bacic as a jaruwala at J'uma, the ex haolldar major, mentioned first above, and another ex lluscat Infantry man^ I have engaged as boatmen at the Agency, under a misapprehension I engaged them at Rb , IS p.m» instead of Hs*20 v/ithout allowances, rations or clothes* The offer, needless to say, was accepted with the greatest eagerness, their hours are just at present, longer and the work harder than with the Muscat Infantry, The Subadar Major informs me that he has turned away upY /ords of 50 applicants for employment at Rs.20,mostly ex Muscat Infantry men who have been discharged at some period or I '^G.Os. who were discharged lately on reorganization^ You will now see that, at the present moment, rupees twenty per month, without rat i xSiJ.«, clothes or G.G.Pay, is considered a very good wage indeed# When, to this is added, another Rs.2 p.m. Good Conduct Pay, free rations ; which if bought by the man himself would cost about Rs*2 p.mo^and free uniforms and shoes which saves the man's clothes a good deal of wear, the pay at Rs*20 p.m* is really equal to a pay of nearly Rs.30 p.m. without these perquisites. The stamp of man, as has been shown, is the identical stamp that always takes service in the Corps, they work according to their capacity and if any one is found unsatis« factory he can be discharged and a new hand engaged in his plac e• If the pay were to be raised, the same stamp of men would still be enlisted and the State would merely pay more for the same thing^which is uneconomic. Paragraph 17 of your despatch to the Government of Indiaf) o does not make it quite clear that the Lien are in enjey... ment of theae perquisites which as has been said above, raises their pay nearly half as much again© C.Os * The j-ay of a Kaik at present is Rs.34 plus Rs.3 G• G• Pay and rations (equalling x^s.5 / market rate) plus free uniform or say Rs.40,that of a Havildar R6.40 plus Rs.6 G.G.Pay, plus rations plus free uniform or say Rs»49 p.m.. Other r, C.Cs, in proportion . This is considered still too high and I also agree and think the rises from the pay of a sepoy ajL^saoc upwards should be much smaller, more in seeping with those of the Indian Army which enlists a superior type of m«n. A fail* basic rate of pay and good conduct pay for the rank and file and N,C,0s. for the present would bet— Sepoys Rs.20 plus G.C.Pay Rs. 1-1-1 - Rs,3 total xis.23 L/H.Ks 24 do Hs.3 '• 27 Naiks 2b do 3 H 31 L/I^aiige hieur. 32 do 3 M 35 Havildars 36 do Rs.2-2-2 - 6 '• 42 Hav/Maj or 43 do do *■ 6 ' 4» This is so calculated tixat basic rate of pay of each rank is one rupee above the pay plus maximuja G.C.Pay of the pay next rank below, thus a sepoy receives Hs.23/plus G.C.Pay and a l/Naik receives Hs.24 basic pay i.e. He.l above, this preventing any chance of a higher rank securing a smaller total rate of pay than the rank below him. At present the rates of pay and G.G.Pay are;- Sepoys Rs .25 plus G.C.Pay Rs. 3 Total Rs. 28 1/lTaik 28 do % M 31 Naiks 34 do 3 •1 37 l/Havildars 38 do 3 II 41 Havildars 40 do 6 H 46 Hav/lala j or 50 do 6 )l 56 which is more than it is necessary to pay for their services. I would not, however, recommend any change until the Hew Year. followers . The present rates of pay are very fair for the present* Good Conduc t Pay . The present rates of Re,l~l -1 - R s .3 and Ks.2-2-2 = Rs.6 should not be reduced any further as things are at present, in any case the sum involved issmall as a Ljan only draws the full rate in his 6th year in that r^nic* Your paragraph 14* After consultation, I thinic that the present ration of 1^- lbs of atta should remain as it is for the present# Later it may 'be considered v/hether it is worth while abolxshing the ^resent ration and issuing a full ratien when the men leave headquarters# 11» Your paragraph 15, I agree that, as funds permit, the lus cat Ixifan try ahould be re ^a rn.e d wxth a newer type of weapon^. The three Iwlaxim guns should be replaced by four new Vickers Machine guns. The Maxim Guns, I am told, are not out of order, they have only been fired cnce in the last 5 years, but as they are old and have done good service, it is time they were replaced, (in this connection please see Captain V/allcer ! s final report on the Muscat Infantry 1928-31 forwarded to Bushire under covering mem© ITo.iyK dated May 7 ^ 9th, 1931, the number of Kaxim Guns is three and not tv/o as stated)» The Lewis^ Gun is practically new# At present stocKs of ammunition are as follows;« Mk.YII 41,000 rounds Kk# VI 72,000 M Res erves of arrm.unition .

The Reserves of ax.munition shown above are am^le, it is in any case undesirable to order large consignments as in this climate ammunition deteriorates very rapidly , it is better to keep small stocics and to be able to replenish tx.em rapidly with small orders. To this end some organization is necessary thereby om . despatch of a telegram to , say, ^uetta Arsenal, ammunition can be despatched immediately and formalities completed later. It is interesting to note the infinitesmal amount of practice carried out by the H'axim Guns, Lewis Gun and the 40 S.L.L.E. charger loading rifles. In 1926 the stocic of Mark VII ammunition was 47,000 rounds, m 1928 it was 41,000 rounds and in 1931 it is still 41,000 rounds. As no other ammunition was bought, this confirms my enquiries paras 5 and 11 above that, during Captain Walker's tenure neither machine guns, Lewis gun nor charger loading rifle* were practiced* The cost of 10,000 rounds Mk.VII ammunition will amount to about Rs. 1,060, I would recommend, however, for financial reasons, that it be obtained next year and not thi s. 12. In conclusion, and with reference to your para 3 note (a), I would li^e to remark that the Muscat Infantryis now far from'carrying on somehow or otherj although this is just what it has 'been doing during the tenures of Captains Stephens and Walker* Last week the XTaxim Guns were lired xor the first time in three years and yesterday some field training was carried out for the first time in five. Their and turn out is excellent while ti.,eir efficiency is increasing^ With regard to ('b) I regard any perman ent 1 ixilib the 'budget as a mistake, permanent af arrangements of this sort lead to extravagance, the Commander 01 tue iorce ¥/ill do his utmust to s^end his whole budget every year anu resist any suggestions for econoxiiy» It is also certain uhat, i*, the /A event of Arms Subsidy 'being lost, a further /ctj considerai le A reduction will have to take place in the Levy Corps and in addition it is always possible x-hat revenue may arojj still further.

As replacement he sug gests 4 Yickers Maxims. On grounds of economy, portability, and uniformity of armament necessary in such a small Corps, I would suggest an equivalent number of Lewis guns instead of the Vickers Maxims. I suggest that the raison d'etre, etc. of the Corps might be explained to the General Staff, who perhaps would be good enough to gire the benefit of their advice on this point, which of course is a technical one. (b) Rifles. Captain Alban also agrees that the Corps should be rearmed with the Mark VII rifle as funds permit. ( c) Amu unit ion.

I concur. i the ^lAHK VI. As already noted/balance is 73,000. Captain Alban states that the average consumption per annum on Range Practice will be 7,000, and so no further stock is required, nor is it advisable to try to obtain more of this ammunition as it is old and the proportion of misfires is high. I concur. (d) On the general subject of the supply of ammunition Captain Alban points out that it is better to keep small stocks and replenish often, than to keep large ones, as local climatic conditions lead to rapid deterioration. He suggests that s omesome organization is necessary whereby on despatch of a telegram, say, to ^uetta Arsenal, ammunition could in an emergency be despatched imiaediately and |crmalities completed later. Supplies would reach Muscat still quicker from Karachi, and if Government approve the military authorities might be approached. strength of the jorps will regain as at present - about 120 - at all events to the end of the year, and vacancies will not be filled up (paragraph 4), There is no change in the nominal scale of the Headquarters Staff, 1 Commandant, and 3 Indian Of f i cers, (par agraph 5) # A suggestion for making an econon^y in the pay of the uommandant has been suggested to Government (para graph 8(a)}. Captain Alban is of opinion that the reduction in the scale of l^.C^Os. (paragraph 6) and of followers (paragraph 7), and the reduction in pay (paragraph 8(b)), can stand as permanent measures. Subject to Colonel Biscoe^ approval on his return I concur. Captain Alban, however, suggests that a further reduction in pay might be made. I am of opinion that consideration of this might be postponed (paragraph 8(b)). The question of Kations is dealt with in paragraph 8, while arms and ammunition will be renewed and fresh stocks laid in as funds permit (paragraph 10). 11 To sum up..

Firstly&gt; I mast congratulate you on the good work you have accomplished at Muscat, and I am delighted to hear that Salyid Oaid is doing so well under your advice and guidance. I have sent him a message through l ^aj or Fowle, which I hope will please him. 2 have decided to defer a decision regard ing measures to be taken at 3ur until I have heard the result of Saiyld Said's third visit, in 'Penzance*. the mere fact that on three occasions he travelled in a sloop must enhance his prestige enormously and show the Arabs that we are behind him; I trust that no more drastic measures, to which It is very difficult to get the assent of the Government of India, will be necessary. X must comment briefly cm some of the views expressed by yoa in your private letters to me and in your of 3rd October. I do not think the latter gave such a fair picture of exactly what happ«n«d regarding the retrench ment scheme which you refer to as being 'baulked* by Captain ^Ucer backed by the Political Agent# This Is not correct* Walker had agreed to Hedgeock* s out though very reluctantly and subject to certain reservations* Major Fowle had also agreed* I then arrived on the scene* Hedgcock had been In the place exactly a month, and the figures that he produced were largely based on hypotheses* I therefore decided that it * * * W.Alban,-2- it would fce preferable to go slow until we had eome more definite data to go on and reduced the cut in the first iiietance 9 but promised that consideration would be giTen to a further cut should the necessity for it be evident. After this and up to the time I left we could not ^et anything out of the Financial Adviser in the way of figures. That is exactly what happened and if anybody interfered with the retrenchment scheme it was iqyself and neither Captain alker nor Major Fowle, and In view of the fact that Hedgoock had only just arrived and knew nothing about the State my action was obviously a reasonable one* 1 am recomraending to Government that you should stay on as Financial Adviser and Commandant of the Levies, and that at an act of courtesy the State should be informed that this arrangement is provisional until i have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with them, which I hope to have in a^out a months time. Saiyid caid must have some one to guide him at the present Juncture and I am quite sure that you are the man to do it, so I hope you will accept the appointment, at any rate for about a year, and I am confident that you will find lajor Fowle very easy to get on with. You mention that you have been writing privately to 4yiie about Muscat affairs. Please do not do so again. On certain occasions In order to save time the Government of India send copies of official despatches addressed to the Resident direct to Muscat, and he Is If there le a real hurry told to send a copy of his reply direct to ^ndia. And of course officers sometimes write privately to the Foreign and Political Department regarding purely Matters, postings, etc. But I do not like officers serving under me writing ...•3- writing privately to India on offioiaX matters^ and official matters best dealt with through ti^e ordinary channels*35/138 and 35/108 Telegram From B.

If, however, owing to present bad trade conditions men can be ^ot for less it might be worth while trying the experiment# It was therefore decided to offer new recruits the basic rate of Hs.20 with present rations, and fill vacancies to make the Cox^ps up to the full strength of 150? it is now 121. Recruiting will commence on Captain Aloan ! s arrival here. when trie lull complement has been reached the further question can be con sidered whether the basic pay of the whole Corps should be reduced to Rs.20/-. 3. V/ith regard to the expansion of the Corps. It was decided that there was no objection in principle to trie expansion, vide para 5 of my letter quoted aoove, out tn&amp;f progress would have to be slow and no expansion would actually-be begun without reference to you.

Thus at th&amp;f moat favourable interpretation the State has to look forward, and try to prepare for, a rainy day when its revenue will abruptly fall by a lakh of rupees* 3^ Our policy all along in the difficult matter2. ot a reduction irj pay of the Corx-'s, the only regulsr armed force in the State, has been to proceed cautiously step 'by step. Cur latest move was to consent, as an experiment, to the enlistment of some 30 new recruits on the reduced pay of Rs•20/-, This experiment has now proved a success, and the men - so Captain Alban reports - seem contented with their lot. As Captain Alban, the officer most concerned, after consultation with his staff, recommends a further reduction in the pay of the remainder of the men I am of opinion that this can 'be done» Captain Alban, (paras § and 10 of his memo) would be glad of early approval of his suggestion, and of course the sooner the reduction is made the more money will be saved. Perhaps therefore you would be so good | as to let me have a reply by telegram. 4. I may add that Captain Alban is also exploring other avenues of economy: education for example (vide k / iii para 11 of my memorandum ^Tc«G-283 of 10-12-1931). When fh i these materialise I will inform you. -^' c ' Lieut.Colonel, Political Agent &lt;k f s Consul, Muscat.' ; jj H Copy of a memorandum H o .177/ b /10, dated the 4th Kay 1932 from Captain R.G*Alban, Commandant, Muscat Infantry, to the political Agent &amp; Ti.B.M # s Consul, Muscat. Subject:- Pay of Muscat Infantry. On the occasion of the Hon'tle the Political Resident's last visit to I.uscat, the question of bringing the basic pay of men still serving on the old rate of Rs.25 per mensem, into line with the pay of those now serving on the new rate of Rs.20 p .m. was discussed, and left pending on the understanding that, if the new rate was found satisfactory or the financial conditions of the State showed signs of further deterioration, the matter would be brought up agein* 2. The financial working of the 3tate at the end of the first three months of the current year shewed a small surplus balance of about Rs.S,000. The receipts for April however, which have just come to hand, show a falling off of Rs.12,859/12 as compared with the month of April of last year. This loss more than cancels out the small surplus mentioned above as having accrued during the first three months of the year, and calls for a further reduction in the expenditure of the State if the Budget lor 1932 is to be maintained in a balanced state. 3 0 The necessity for retrenchment of State expenditure which, standing at a figure of Rs.60,000 a monuh, is still unduly high will continue as l on ^| as (a) the slump in the date trade continues and (b) the question of the Arms Traffic Subsidy remains unsettled. With regard to (a) it is obvious that unless the export of dates from Euscat increases there can be no increase in imports and therefore of Custom s it.vt-uue. TTith regard to (b) consideration has to be taken of the possibility of the Arms Traffic Subsidy coming to an end in the near future, when we may find ourselves faced with a drop of Rs. 1,00,000 per annum in the State revenue. 5. as a result of the present trade depression ^great 4 &lt; V: i; \ i \deal of unemployruent exists among the coolie^ class, who are mostly Ealuohis, and wcges are very low, No temptation therefore exist for men at present serving in the levy Corps to take their discharge on the chance of finding other employmento 6. The position now is, that 94 men are in receipt of the old rate of pay of Hs»25 p.m. and 35 men are in receipt of the new rate of Hs.20 p.nu 7. Of these 35 men, 29 were enlisted at the 'beginning of February this year and the remaining 6 had joined in July and August last year. No difficulty has been experienced in obtaining recruits and the men seem tc be quite contented. Fay at the rate of Rs»20 appe&amp;rs to be quite suitable and is in conformity with general standard of living. So To myself and my staff, therefore, there appears to be no reasonable objection to the reduction to the naw rate of pay i .e. pws .2C , of those 94 men still m receipt of the old rate of Hs.25/-. c 9 in view of the fact that there now exists no margin of safety to allow for the smallest further drop in revenue, and in order that we may not be caugnt unprepared, I would recommend , subject to jour approval, tnct tne change of pay should take effect from June 15th. 1952. 10. in case my suggestion has your appro™! I v /ould request to he informed of this as early as possitle m order to enable me to warn the individuals affected on the 15th of Mpy. The annual savins which may he expeeted to accrue from this reduction will be Rs .5,640/-.flnttfidential # Ho.SO5-3 of 1932. British Residency &amp; Consulate^General, Bushire, the 17th May 1932. From - The Hon'ble Lt.Colonel H.V.Biscoe,!.^., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, SIMLA. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to Mr. ^ wylie's letter No.F.35-K/31 of the 17th November 1931 inviting my coairaents on certain proposals submitted by Colonel Fowle regarding the Muscat Levy Corps. 2. I would tender ny sincere apologies for my failure to reply to this letter earlier. I can but plead that I have been almost continuously on tour throughout the past cold weather and have had many pre-occupations, and the matter was therefore overlooked. Moreover various caases combined to divest the question of the Levy Corps of some of the importance that it had previously assumed. I regret to say that I also .overlooked the orders contained in Government of India , 8 a, tn ^ / Express Letter Ho.F. 19-.H/31 of the 15th May 1931^, |! it was directed that until further orders vacancies arising in the Levy Corps should remain unfilled pro\ide; the strength of the Corps was not reduced below 100. 3, In this connection, however, I would invite a reference to Colonel Fowled despatch l!lo.487«»S of 1st August 1931, paragraphs 13 and 17, in which he reported that s ome •..2~ some men had been recruited to replace casualties and the strength of the Corps brought up to about 130, The Goyernment of India have been informed^ thereforep that some recruitment was going on and .Ixat the possibility of bringing the Corps up to its noraal strength*of 150 was under consideration* By the end of the year the financial position of the State had considerably improved owing to various measures of economy that ifiul had been effected, and the State succeeded in repaying to the A Government of India its instalment of Rs.43,000, and had a balance of about R8 .30,000 in the Treasury. Per the current year provision was accordingly made in the budget for the Corps to be brought up to its normal strength of 150 and steps have now been taken to enlist the additional men required# 4* In his letter H0.638-S of 2nd October 1931, the Officiating Political Resident submitted very detailed proposals regarding the future composition and rates of pay of the Corps* Into these details I do not think it is necessary to follow him, nor would it seem necessary to trouble the Government c£ India with the minor details of administration* Last year special attention was attracted to the administration of the Corps by three causest firstly, it was made a test case by the late Financial Adviser; secondly, the financial position of the State was precarious and measures of econoisy essential, and thirdly, irregularities had been discovered on the part of the late Coioraandant in the administration of the Corps and investigation was ordered* The circumstances have now changed; the finances of the State have been put on a tolerably satis factory footing and the irregularities discovered have been eliminated* The State can now afford to wsintain the Corps at its proper strength of 150, and this is considered by myself and the local officers the minimum number that is of any practical military value* I trust therefore the Government of India* **-3- India will be pleased to approve of the Corps being maintained at this figure. 6. How, as regards the pay of the Corps. The basic pay of the sepoy was originally Rs»30/-», and last June it was reduced toRs.25/-. Subsequently Captain Alban reported that owing to the scute economic distress prevailing in the Persian Gulf, recruits were forthcoming at Rs*20/» per mensem, and therefore entrants to replace wastage were engaged at this rate. There are, there- fore, at the present moment, as reported by Colonel Fowle, two rates of pay prevailing in the Corps, namely, R8«25/« and Rs «20A for men enlisted since last July* Actually at the present time 94 are in receipt of the old rate of pay and 35 of the new rate. Captain Alban has now suggested that the basic rate of pay of all the sepoys should be reduced to Hs.SOA Per mensem# They will, of course, get in addition, rations, good-conduct pay, etc. Captain Alban assures me that this reduction of pay will not occasion discontent and there will be no breach of contract, since any man unwilling to accept the new rate will be permitted to terminate his contract and then go. 6. How, under normal conditions I would hesitate to reoommend so drastic a reduction, but for two reasons I now support it. Firstly, the economic condition of the population In the Persian Gulf is at the present time deplorable and they are suffering from most acute economic distress, many of t..hem being on the brink of starvation. On the Arab side the pearl aarket, on which the bulk of the populace depends, is lifeless, ^hile prices of such commodities as dates, etc. which they export, bave fallen. It is doubtful if this year even 50^ of the Oak- /etc. * pearling boats will be fitted out and 1B&lt;3tbMu Merchants and nakhudas have not the capital to fit out boats, while the former have many lakhs worth of pearls on their hands. In(py In oonaequence unemployment is rife. On the Peraian side, awing to the total absence of rain - a fact unprecedented in the memory of the oldest inhabitants, famine conditions prevail orer a Tery large portion of the Persian coastal area, and inany i'ersiaiiS fire migrating to the Arab side to seeic employment as porters# labourers, etc# » thereby adding to the unemployment already existing* In these circumstances wages in the ordinary labour market have naturally fallen enormously, and men are now obtainable on much lower wages than formerly, Por this reason I agtee with Captain Alban in thinking that it is possible to obtain recruits of a satisfactory stamp for the Muscat Levy Corps on a basic pay of Rs#20/- per mensem, and that the existing members of the Corps *a4i&amp;£ think very seriously before usUi cutting their names^ and wofctM accept the cut with a good grace. It must be borne in mind that the cost of living has also fallen considerably, 7, Secondly, the Muscat State is confronted with a possibility of the loss of the Arms Traffic Subdidy of 1 lakh a year in three years' time - vide Foreign and Political department Express Letter i !io ,D ,891&lt;»il/3l of the 21st March 1932 to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, In these circumstances it is clear that the State will have to take every possible measure to effect economies and to increase its revenues, Should trade revive and wages in the ordinary labour market go up and prices of primary commodities increase# it may be neceseaxy to reconsider the matter, but I think that a reduction of the basic pay of the sepoy to He*20/- per mensem will not at present lead to serious discontent or lack of efficiency, I trust therefore the Gove nment of India will be pleased to approve of it, 8, As regards the other detai Is of administration I do not think it is necessary to trouble the (jrovernment oi i .ndia, &amp;nd I submit that they can be left to the discretion of lis Highness ,•••I ffl i J f -5- Highnese tm bultan^ acting on the advice of Captain Alban, who, as he combines the posts of Coiamandant and of Financial AdTiser, is likely to hold the scales evenly between the necessities of the State and the interests of the Corps. His Highness is well aware that the Government of India attach much importance to the efficiency of the ^oipc, and that it is always regarded as a matter on which their representatives should be consulted before any material changes are made* 9# Captain Alban some time ago submitted some interesting euggeetlons regarding the manner in which the Corps should be organised and utilised, and prima facie many of them seem to me to be very sound* Their practical application, however, will require both time and the expenditure of some money, and I consider it desirable that before reporting them to the Grovernment of India the views of His Highness the Sultan should be ascertained regarding them, since they were submitted before His Highness had ascended the throne* I consider it most desirable that every effort should be made to get His Highness to interest himself in the Corps and to feel that they are his troops rather than the forces of the Government of India imposed upon a reluctant State, as did Said Taimur. I am therefore instructing the Political Agent to obtain the views of His Highness the Sultan in due oouree and will then submit a further report to the Government of India* At present all that I would solicit is that the Government of India should accord their approval to the strength of the Corps being maintained at 150 and the basic pay of the •epoy beigg reduced to Hs* 20/- per mensem. iO* In conclusion i would observe that the arrangement under which the posts of Commandant of the Levy Corps and financial Adviser are held by one officer is working quite satisfactorily6- gatisf&amp;ctorily at present, and is an economical one for the State# I hi?.ve the honour to be, 3ir # Your most obedient aerrant, 7/ v SSTED.

You will receive by this xna.il copy of a deapatch I have written to the Oovernrnent of India, regarding the Muscat Levy Corps. As you will see I have not dealt with the matter in so detailed a manner as it ban been dealt with in the past for reasons given therein, and have contented myself with asking that the Corps should be maintained at its normal strength of 150 and the basic pay of the seapoy reduced to K b . 20 per mensem. Other details I think can be left to us, and after all officers of the Government of India have hardly the time to go into the minor details of administration of one particularly small Levy Corps, or to consider such a matter as the possible necessity for engaging an extra bhisti. As you will see, I have said that Alban has submitted proposals regarding the employment and orgajnisafion of the Corps, regarding which I have promised a further report. I had in mind his letter Ho.

Priraa facie x think it would probably be a good thing to change the name of the Corps and, when roads have been built, have detachments at Sbhar and Sur, and then probably take in the coast guards. Kven if financial exigencies do not permit of these proposals being introduced in the near future it is not a bad idea to map out a scheme and pi'ess it forward as occasion offers.i ■ p- r IC A/ /%, !&gt;% t M. i6th June iy32.

It will have the further advantage that spare parts are and will be for considerable period easily available in India.

Report on the condition of the Muscat Levy Corps Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith a report on the above subject for your information. 2, This report has been compiled after careful personal observation extending over a period of eighteen 0 months' observation which has been necessarily rendered closer by the prolonged absence of the oultan and the British Commandant from Muscat during the last ten months of the period quoted. 3, Before proceeding further and at the cost of repttijOn. it seems essential to quote the raisons d 'etre • the Corps. 4, These were set forth, prior to the inception of the Corps, in the Government of India's letter no*12^2 aa^ed 12th ..larch 1914 to the address of the Political Resident and are as follows 'It is understood that the primary object of the Levy Corps is to enable the withdrawal of the Indian troops at present garrisoning the towns ot Muscat and ^attr^h, to place at the aominal disposal of the oultan a locally raised force sufficient to assert his authority, defend his I capital against rebelious tribesmen and to furnish a-2- lOJS' reseirve from //hich detachments ma^/ be dravm to garison ' such af ^is Highness^ inland -forts as he my hereafter recover' » 5, -^he first object has been accomplished, the last eliminated by circumstance^but the remainder still hold good. 6, The 'essentials for a ^evy Corps in an Arab State' have been very correctly summed kjr up by &lt;&gt; Wingate. the then Political Agent Muscat in his letter No *942 dated 30th April 1920 to the Civil Commissioner Baghdad and are:- (i) That it should not be Arab (ii) That it should be very highly paid (iii) That it should be small and mobile (iv) That the otate should be able to afford its 10% Wingate's views have been so repeatedly endorsed by higher authorities, better oualifi -- to give an opinion, that further comment on them is not here required# ^ # now therefore se^.ms essential to limine whether {A) the present Corps ful'^iJ s t-e object of its inception (B) Circumstances have i^ anyway just le-i a departure from the essentials as originally laia down oy Mr. Wingate and endorsed both by experts and gen^^rfi. experience, (A) goes the Co rps fu.lf il„ the„ob &lt; i^_oOts ^inception? 8. Force of financial circumstances has reduced the original strength of the Corps from X ro to 160 at which figure it now nominally stams# 9. With this wholly inadequate force the defence of Muscat and katrah would be impossible even were the troops in an highly efficient state of training and discipline, health and contentment, Prom a perusal o to. saboequent paragraphs it will be seen none of these essential factors are present and that the Levy Corps can in no single way be regarded as fit to fulfil its proper role.icu Training and discipline go hand in hand and where the former is lacking the latter will be absent. 11*, Captain Alban in his Confidential memorandum i\io. ^'C/202 dated 15th September 1931 to the address of the iion'ble the Political Resident states in paragraph 5 thereof;- 'During the period of command of Captain talker I am in formed that no field training of any sort was carried out and as this is the only sort of training that is really necessary, it appears that they are now untrained, 11 Captain ^lbanj in the same paragraph, still further emphasises the unfitness of the Levy Corps due to lack of training at the hands of his two immediate predecessors, 12, Inspite of these comments on his predecessors, the late Commandant appears to have made little effort to rectify the (2eficiencies and on the sar^e hypothesis tn.e Levy Corps mu8% certainly have still further deteriorated^ 13, During 1932 no training of any kind or description was carried outj unless the sea journey pe■• j ..ormeu by 100 rifles, to the neighbourhood of Has el Kadd during the so-called our operations can ,^be regarded as trai r 'i® For two months of the year the Corps were engaged on road making in the mtineh and for two months, split up into small parties, they furnished escorts for date assess ors in the same area, 14. In 1933 from 27th oanuary till well into Junej the Muscat levies were employed as a cooly Corps, blasting a hill-side and attempting to build a Customs quai *ith the resultant debris. The conditions under which the men were cabled upon to work all day, on a rockface almost too hot to touch, during the blazing heat of the summer sun, proved too great a strain on the temperament and discipline of even ****** 4* -in A minor mutiny' the meek local Baluchi oulitiinate. /N which will be referred 'to later, 15. -s a relaxation, on relief to aait el Falaj, the men were turned or j in some cases under most dangerousnV conditions } to clear out a felag and to dig 'on spec' a series of wells, one of which was some 60 feet in depth to irrigate the Commandant's garden and its vicinity. In this case, as in the attempt to 'build a Customs quai. no expert opinion was sought and the toils and labour^ of the mwn were in vain and merely incurred the derision of the local inhabitants. 16. After the departure of the late Commandant in June, each platoon was put through 16 days platoon training by the 1.0s. Neither company training nor night work were carried out. This comprised the entire training of the Corps for the year. Discipline has suffered, but to a lesser extent than might have been expected due partially to the meek an^. mild nature of the locally recruited man, and considerably to the tact of the senior 1.0s. 17. «s regards Musketry, the annual course Is a very much modified edition of that laid down for j-ndian »roy. Insrnte of this more than half the total strength of the Corps are only third class shots. 13. The marching powers and march discipline of the Corps, so conspicuous in Captain Walkers time, are now equally conspicuous by their absence. xvs recently as last month a body of picked men fo- a Guard of honour at the Palace streamed back to Matrah like an armed mob, and eventually had to be transported driblets to Bait el -fr'alaj J*-j - 19. Turning to the health of the Co-. * medical inspection carried out by the medical Officer charge of the muscat bevies it was found xhat two out of the a . orv nf the rank and file were unf it three Indian Officers ana 20* ol tne ra for active service. i r.'hQprvation of sick askaris in Constant personal obseivax,i. m + - TT-»cf for minor abrasions etc shows hospital and those atten mg v. r\-p thp men are weak and debilitated that a very large number o^.and have absolutely no powers of resistance in them. The general health of the Corps is described only as 'Fair', How some of these 'cases' ever came to be enlisted in the Corps is a point that could perhaps be better explained by the late Commandant, ^s askaris they are useless» 20« Regarding the state of contentment or rather discon tent of the Corps, it is useless to blink the definite fact that the second reduction in pay has been a grave cause of discontent among the ranks* It is useless to cir cumvent the truth by saying that if the men were not content with the new rates of pay they were at liberty to take their discharge, but that few availed themselves of the offer. It was a case of HobsoVs choice with the men. 21. ^s the senior I.Os have represented to me in confi dential conversations 'The men say they stayed on because they thought they would be employed in the normal duties of an askari. When it came to forced labour, without rest, on useless quais and wells, they said they would be better off as ordinary coolies. Then at any rate they could work when they wanted to, have periods of respite, and to their homes after their day^ ?cabour' • 22» These circumstances, combined with the abrupt and unsympathetic way the reductions were introduced, caused, the utmost resentment and discontent, which culminated in the emeute of last summer when the men in a body loomed tools'. The fact that this demonstration was as severely dealt with, as information of it was suppressed, did eliminate, but rather enhanced, the discontents 23. ^ timely change of regime ± n m ia suirmer 1923, combined with the loyal endeavours of the l.Os, (ir spite cf the acute chagrin they felt at the treatment meted out to themselves) has since gone far to alleviate the situation. 24. None the less the Muscat Levy Corps can in no waybe regarded as a contented body of meno They feel undoubt edly that they are 'nobody's children', and are merely there to perforr. cooly work and guards, or to be trotted out on 'show days' for the delection of visiting officials. 25. That the Corps is as smart as it is and has retained t certair amount of its old discipline reflects the greatest credit or the late Subedar Major Fat eh Khan and on Subedar Mohammad Ibrahim. (B) Have cir cumstances in anyway justified a de oartur* from t he esse ntials originally laid down . (1) That the Corps should be non-Arab . 26o In spite of the panegyric contained in paragraph 17 (page S) of Captain A^bar 1 s jj . O .imc-,0-240 of 2Cth October 1931 to 'the address of the Hon'ble the ^olitJcal Resident, there seems to exist no justificatior for abandoning the opinion of experts that Arabs should rot be enlisted ir the Corps. Of the four Arab N.C.Os held to eulogy in that letterj one has beer discharged as mad, one is hopelessly in debt and of bad character, whilst the remaining two are unfit to be N.C.Os acccrring to my personal observat'oi and to the reports of the 1.0s. The ren airing six askeris arej according to the 1 .0s quite useless, and personal' y I should prefer their room to their company in a t .ght corner. 27. If the Corps is to be employed in Arab country against Arabs it is obvious that it should stiil continue to be non-Arab in composition and that no further departure from this essential should be allowed. (ii) That it should be v e ry^. Mghly^ pa id • 28. In view of financial circumstances this essenticil might perhaps be modified to 'well paid'. The necessity of a well paid force has been i e- iterated times without number by both experts and higher authorities, but it appears to be only Major towle, in his capacity as Acting Resident in 1931, who has drawnllA attention to the partlcul- r and salient reason of this ' v ^ necessity. 29. In his letter Ho.487-3 dated 1st August 1931 to the Governruent of India he states 'Such a body must obviously be paid well to attract a good stamp of man, which is PARTICULARLY NECESSARY AS THE FORCE IS ONLY A SMALL ONE'. 30. Later in the same letter he states 'I fee] doubtful v/hether this pay (Rs 20/- p.m.) will be adequate to attract the right stamp of man, or v/ill be sufficient to induce them to work hard if they actually enlist. 11 31. These doubts have unfortunately beer only too well confirmed-, The Corps is now full of the sweepings of Muscat and Matrah bazaars, of a type that Captain Alban rightly says 'These are men who normally seek employment as labourers, sailors, pearl fishers (i.e.slaves), came' 1 , drivers', but whom he none the less entertained the idea of receiving in the Levy Corps. 32o If the object is -is suggested in Captain Alban's D.O. 0? Ho.C-241 cf 20th October 1931(paragraph 13) to the address of the Hor'ble the Political Resident to make the Corps into 'a maid-of-all-work body' and to perform tasks (as lcst summer) which are normally the lot of coolies, then the necessity of paying it well no longer exists, but it would be as well to alter the nomenclature of the Levy to that of the Muscat Cooly Corps or some &gt;uch appropriate name. 33c If on the other hand it is to be maintained as a compact, highly trained anc. disciplined fighting force then it is high time that command of the Corps be (a) entruoted to well-balanced, practical soldier of tne type usually recommaj ded for Irregular Militias and (b) that the pay of the askari be raised to a level that will attract something more than the scum of local bazaars. (iii) That the Cor ps shoul d be small_and mobile. 34* The Corps is perforce small. It should therefore be-8- ■ 77/ correspondingly mobile to serve any useful purpose. In its present condition, incapable of marching and with a much worp lorry as its only transport, the Corps can merely be as an immobile body of armed men# The I.Os are at present engaged in endeavouring to rectify this defect but the approach of the long hot weather is ar. impediment to progress. (iv) That t he otate should be abl e to afford it . 35, This is now comfortably possible in view of the greatly improved, finances of the State. It is however essential that a suitable B.O* be appointed as Commandant at a very early elate. Failing this the Corps is likely to be used as an 'Arms,Clothing and Equipment' depot for his own slave-askaris by the Sultan, whilst its personnel will be employed by all and sundry in odd jobs to save their own respective departments expense,, 36« To sum up it will be seer that from long and contmuec lack of proper attention the kuscat Levy Corps has detc^ir.j a^ed into a body of armed , but almost completely untrameo, L en* 37, It io therefore unable to fulfil the object with which it was formed# It is 2C% physically unfit, discoiiterted and under paid. 38, only one of the four essentials have been adhered toj the remainder having been wholly or partic-xly ignored# 39, The remedy for the majority of these i&lt;- in the early appointment of a young^ well-balcmceo, d.n^ c-bove all sympathetic, officer v/ho preferably has had. previous recent experience of Irregular i^orps in eithe- I . 0 - Ira&lt;i # and one who is open to consultation and has bent for languages, if he is not already versed in both Arabic ana Baluchi, 40, The appointment of an Officer of this type will go far to remove the disabilities of the Muscat Levy Corps and to restore it to its former position Oi prestig , ut' ' .

His Highness quite agreed and you are, with His Highness^ approval, going to draw up a hot weather programme of training for the Corps* tfith regard to the reduction in the pay of the men which has, in your opinion, led to deterioration In the quality of the material elements from which the Corps is recruited* The basic rate of pay for an askari still remains at Hs»20/- per mensem which is I believe something more than the Indian seapoy gets, and compares I think not unfavourably with vdhat the men night be earning in civil life. In addition to this the askari is housed and receives uniform and rationst though the letter are certainly not nearly as ample es those provided to the Indian seapoy. A q 1 told you 1 am definitely against raising the b&amp;sic pay of the Corps but perhaps something might be done in the &lt;va.y of/of increasing their rations and housing. On my reoent Tisit to Muscat we suggested this tentatiyely to the Sultan, who said he would consider it.

Memoran duin Reference your memorandum Ho. 576-S of 23rd June 1934* In accordance with our discussion regarding the training of the Muscat Levy Corps, an hot weather programme of progressive training has been drawn up. 2. This programme is based on methods of training pre vailing in the indian Army considerably modified to suit both local requirements and the great deficiency of training that at present exists in the Corps. 3. During my absence on recess the acting Commandant will submit a weekly progress report to me of training carried out 4. It must however be realised that eliminating men on X leave, duties in Beit-el-Felaj, and the detachment at Muscat, there remains available for such training but d6-40 rank and file. It is none the less hoped that by October the rucii- mentary training will have reached a sufficiently satisfac tory stage to permit of elementary field exercises being carried out. Further progress will depend on the results obtained up till then. 5. Before being able to draw up an adequate local Defence scheme for Muscat, and in the complete absence of any useful maps of the terrain, a complete reconnaissance on foot of the area involved is essential. The climatic con ditions prevailing at the moment ^render this physically impossible, and after two pre-fen attempts in -une, I have abandoned further action till &amp; heat of the sunder abates.

Apparently on my departure for Karachi the late Subedar Mohammad Ibrahim quite openly announced that as 'the Consul' had now departed he was in supreme charge and that whatever he decreed was law, irrespective of what any one (and he included the Muscat Government I ) said, 3. From then on he seems to have organised a sort of campaign of tyranny against all and sundry except his minion, Havr. Major Lala, whose disreputable reputation I had already mentioned in my demi-official letter No.C/86 dated 10th March 1934 to Gastrell.' ! • 4. Humours of the state of affairs apparently got to Saiyid ^amad, (through the latter r s brother-in-law, a young Baluch askari) who on two occasions went to Bait- el-Falaj and warned the Subedar. The Sultan knew of this, I believe, and apparently Saiyid Hamad's action was guided by him. 5. Saiyid Hamad personally told me, and I have heard it from other quarters, that to such an extent were the men oppressed that there was a definite intention to shoot uae Subedar when a suitable chance ottered# Saiyid hamad wao specifically warned of this, informed the Sultan, and tooK necessary steps to present it. Hie Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel T»C.Fowle, C.B.h.j Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e. ASNI ^ J 6. Mohammad. Ibrahim's next step was to get rid of ^ Jemadar Mehr ^han and he definitely approached both N.C.Os and men to give false evidence of the temadar being in subordinate, disobedient and immoral. All refused and were promptly punished on various pretexts* This fact has been told me by the late Corps clerk (on probation) who had resigned and whom I met in Karachi. The latter had no axe to grina in telling me this since he had only done t^o months vvito. Corps and had no further connection with it. • • When the Subedar could get no one to back, him,he took the law into his own hands, placed the Jemadar vir- &lt;j tially under close arrest, and deported him with the (faJoifvOJrti9 greatest ignominy by the next mail without' so much as A. referring to the Sultan. He published a most scurrilous Corps Order on the subject, which I have since expunged. 8. As already reported to you, Mohammad Ibrahim's services have since been dispensed with, whilst Havr. Major Lala has also been got rid of. Meanwhile Jemadar Y^usuf Khan, late of the 5/10th Baluch Regiment has been appointed to the Corps and d emadar Mehr Khan has rejoined on re-appointment, 9. Yusuf Khan is an ^kora Khattak with an excellent record and of decent family - (I understand that Mohammad Ibrahim was a Mirassi, at least that is what is commonly said in his old Regiment). He has 25 years service to his credit, and is an I.O. of experience. He plays a good game of hockey and the men have so far taken to him well. 10. Stow that these two 1.0s are present things will be easier, but I found on taking over that apart from ceremonial, occasional route marching, range, and guard mounting, the men had had no training whatsoever. No N.C.O, other than Platoon Commanders, had ever had charge on parade of even a squad. 11. I have had to start right at the beginning and have instituted both practical and lecture classes for tne N.C.Os whilst the men are being put through their paces by theI.Os. Promising askaris are also being given a chance^ of taking charge of squads and sections. 12. All are tumbling to it marvellously well, and though the brain of the average man is not conspicuous, they are all being brought up to think quick and to act on tneir own initiative instead of each being a mSiUber of a dumt) herd as hi'ther't-o* 13• My own xack of modern military 'training is a bit of a handicap but all I am attempting to do is to inspire the Corps with the idea of thinking quick and how to act in case of emergency, so that when a pukha Commandant is appointed he will find some material ready to work on. 14, Another handicap is the complete absence of a Corps Clerk and as nobody knows where any records, orders or anything else is kept it is a little difficult to com plete. However there is much humour to be derived in delving amongst the chaos 1 16. Without any prior intimation I was planted last week with a Brahmin doctor rt who will be medically in charge of the Corps'. The fiat was signed by Dull Chand 'on His Highness^ instruction'. As the doctor comes from a neighbouring village to the Rai Sahib there may be something more than meets the eye in the appoint ment. He has done three years with military from which he resigned owing to 'inconvenience over family'. 16. A Hindu clerk of bannia origin was also about to be planted on me by order of the Director of Customs but I have gently, but firmly&gt; declined to entertain him till I hear from the Sultan. 17. Meanwhile I have written very tactfully to His Highness and told him that if he wants me to be respon- of sible (as he asked) for the efficiency and training/his Corps I must be consulted as to who^a the important per sonnel are to be. That the best person to be a clerk in a Muslim Corps is a Mussalman of soldierly up-bringing, with a previous knowledge of a Hegimental Office\ l f\ ana not a bannia nominated by the Director of Customs. ^ have put it very nicely to him and I trust he will agree. Saiyid Shahab was furious when he heard about the proposal and told Duli Chand to telegraph to his nominee in Karachi to stop there till His Highness's orders were received i 19♦ There are some fairly useless men in the Corps, just of slave origin, and I propose to replace these gradually, if I can do so, with good types of Mekrani or other decent Baluch. It will take a long tiiae to get a really decent machine going but,God willing, I hope to do so before landing over. 20% I personally attend parades twice a week and generally superintend everything to do with the Corps. The men appreciate the interest taken in them very much and are wonderfully responsive to the changed regime.

Suh,iect: - The Muscat Infantry» Sir, I have the honour to address you on the uov.-; ao^Got, which in view of your approaching visit to iiuscat you may wish to discuss with His Highness the Sultan. in October last, requested me 'to he good enough to look after his Corps till such time as a suitable Commandant was appointed' • Ithcugl sufficient duties. I agreed to do so and have thus been afforded a signal opportunity of observing the difficulties which normally confront the Commandant. t TA/-»in+R the following come 3. Amongst many lesser points, % strikingly to notice. (a) The Corps, as a fighting unit, is of little or no value. (b) Its present composition militates -gainst it nv efficient as a fighting unit, ever becoming really ellicienu . . v&lt;&lt;*»or» + inn thot appears to exist ci • ng (c) The misconception 01 i - J -t- 1 . -- )r5r , nr fTnpnts as to what the Corps vnd various Government Department . ond consenuentlv the demands that its machinery exist - or ana cons^ d j are mrde on the Corps. 4. 'Regarding (a) Tra ining. ' 'active' as opposed to 'supervisory' On taking over aouchorge of the Corps it was quickly apparent that the military training hitherto reoeived by the Corps had heen of a most perfunctory fcature# tbcr than on guard duty apparently no } T . 3. l ♦ ■ been given charge of as much as a souad to handle on parade, and not a single H.C.O. was cognisant of the simplest drill parade exercises or orders, let alone field work. This necessitated a commencement ab inititio of a ike for JT.C.C , instructors and with the material at one's disposal, this has been found exceedingly difficult* 'Without going into detail, it will suffice to say that classes have been instituted for F.G.Os and every endeavour has been made to inculnte some idea of elementary training into the men. A small beginning has been made with f-j/ield work, but the ^orps as a whole is not yet fit to leave the square. 5. As regards (b ) Oompcsiti on. The Corps at present consists of 37 Mekranis and 107 locally enlisted men (some S Arabs and the remainder 'Saluchis' ). 6. Close scrutiny of the former element reveals that the men belong mostly to fighting classes, but only some half dozen can be classified tribally a&lt;- r r - rlucnio. 7. Hone the less the ^ekrani is infinitely superior in every way to the local Baluch. ^e shows an aptitude for militarv training, his musketry is rroodj nd ^hxlst his general conduct and disc pi .ne it e. Co. u it, ■- ^ * * superior in intellect to the local ' n. 8. Of the local 'Baluch' element a large number are 'c-hidis' - i.e. of slave origin. t hat? 'been Impossible to trace the clans of the majority of the remainder as the -j irmo^nnt of their ancestrial tribes, men themselves are igno'. uo Suffice it to say that they are all townsmen, born end bredin Muscat and MotrDh, neither of 'which ore producti've of 'fighting classes' or true tribesmen. They ore consequently devoid ott the inborn instincts of the fighting man. 9. ^omTDine' with on extremely low standcri of intelligence the proximity of their homes and the sordid environments from which they originate does not tend to convert the local elements into suitable material for a fighting Corps. 10. As a consequence their training is exceedingly difficult and what the men learn one day, they forget the next ♦ What has often been told me quietly by locally enlisted men themselves would appear to hove a certain semblance of truth - i.e, 'those that haven 1 1 the wit to get a better 'living elsewhere join the Levy Corps to do a minimum of 'work and to live at home'. Whatever may be the facts, certain it is that the local element is the despair of the 7.0b of the Corps. 11. With a view to improving these defects tentative- efforts have been made to search ox,'i bettex local ^ypes but no success has been met with. 12. The only other alternative to effect improvement would appear to be an increase in the ivekroni element, here however several obstacles present themselves the chief of which ore (!) additional expense (n) the aixiiculty o i, obtaining good typos on the present r-tes of pay end the entire lack of any tribal system in the Corps. 13. Assuming that It might eventually ho possible to moot (i) above, opportunity was taken of his presence in Muscat to consult Mir Mahmud Khan Oltchlci son of 3.p. Kir Mehrab Khan, late Sarhadedar of Mekran, as to the possibility of obtaining good types of Baluchi tribesmen for the Corps. His reply, a copy of which is attached herewith is self explanatory. The matter has accordingly been held in abeyance for-o /I 4, the time beings 1 ^' Regarding (c ) .The mis - use of the C o rps» Hitherto the training of the Corps for Military purposes has purely 'been secondary to its other functions, and it would appear that in practice the various Departments of the local Government regard the Corps as merely being for general utility purposes, whilst the Sultan appears to regard it as a useful supply Arsenal for obtaining modern rifles for distribution to his slaves and other Civil personnel» 15 Thus the motor lorry and driver, without the consulta tion of the Commandant, are suddenly commandeered by telephonic orders received from the Ministry of Revenue or the Municipality, and when required for Corps use are nowhere to be found* the Po3 demanding the supply of clothing, sandals etc. ' iTnmediately ,, . 5ultan 1 to himself''of large numbers of the latest rifles&gt; which have been expressly ordered for the I uscat Infantry to replace obsolete patterns* A fa11 ue party is required - apply ^ . • 16* ITot only is the training of the ^or^s intori &gt;-r&gt;-d .vith, to know under whoso orders they ore to act.

If on the other hand they corry an order out and subsequently something miscarriee, they, and not the person who telephoned the order, are held respons ible* 17. /part from this, the expenses incurred in such v, in -r' rarjh 15 are all debited to the items as appear ^ ■ - * , T^irip-pt instead of being borne already greatly reduced Corps uaget4000) 5 • J \SO e pro- 'by the DeportiriGnts concerned or, in the cose of arms, 'being . e d Tttid- for paid 'by the Bui tan himself* 5 shows ijjther On the other hand any small item required for the uction er the benefit of the -orps or its personnel is queried or d of cot rejected, principally at the instigation of the Director entry qome Revenues. 18. Opportunity has not afforded of 'bringing these matters to the Sultan 's notice since his return from India on the 6th February but, in ^iew of what has been brought to your notice elsewhere in a separate report, it is doubtful if he will take any steps to ameliorate the present state of affairs* T have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant• Major, Political Agent &amp; Consul,ruscat»\s\ of y letter 2?Sth January 1^36 from Hir *«haud Ehan Kechgi to 7a.j or r..i;.' t .Br«rars«r i K.G, f i oiitical ^ent and n*B.H*s C vnz'ix, Muscat# ^•C # I jsiav^ r^cei¥5d your vir # d favour and i will consider it an honour and incumbent i, on cie to reocler service to ^ou* jl deem it my duty to briu*. to tour 'oiiour*» tioti.ce tke fact that c«ch ssin of «e.&lt;ran ^vy orp® %et» He* IS yln$ 50 seers of flour per meuKem# icnsion is -il&amp;o .v ranted to him after a service of i3 years# Xt is then vary difficult to obtain at the rate of *8.20 and the ration .aich iu ^iven to the Muscat inlantry for such m cista^t place aa ^u^c^t -here foodstuffs are much «5ore dearer than in any r art of Baluchistan men of good fat ily aio in my opinion are fit for military service and remain ilm in critical times.

With regard to a Commandant for the Corps please see a recent letter which Iwote to Laithwaite (with a copy to you) asking him if lie would very kindly approach some oi the Home Departments with a view to getting a suitable officer. (I cannot quote the number and date of the letter as I have not got the file with me on toui) • 3. Briefly Bremer 's views are (vide paragraph 3 ol his letter) that the Corps is of little value owing to its ccmpositlon. But th. „ot .„11« lor rate ot pay ^ «&gt;. Stat, offer., (par.- graphs 6 -13 of his leuoex)* 4. It would certainly have been possible up to now for the State, which has only recently been savea from bankruptcy, to have offered higher rates of pay. If thmga improve, this may be possible in the future, and a better * ^ + n the Corps. In the meantime the class of men attracted to the to.ps e (3a i p to make the best of the present obvious thing to do is to -w. material. / Hon'ble Mr.H.A.F.Metcalfe, ^ 0.3.I.,C.I .3., • v * *' the Government Foreign SecreLf.i} - India, Simla.7. / -2- material. / h 6f Bremner lias undoubtedly worked hard in looking after the Corps, but I found a somewhat unhealthy spirit of defeatism amongst the three Indian Officers, who apparently took the attitude that their men were not worth bothering about. One of them in the course of conversation g -we his opinion that the Corps was a 'Jfatim Khana &lt;f (orphanage). I took the opportunity during my visit to give the Indian Officers a lecture - at which Bremner was present. I said that doubtless the present material in the ^Corps might not be all that was desired, and if circumstances permitted it might be improved in the future, but that in the meantime their obvious duty was to make the best of it. That several instances had occurred in military history (I instanced one) where unpromising material had been turned uy capable oxficers into serviceable soldiers, and X expecteu them to do likewise. That I wanted to hear no more nonsense about Yatim Khanas, and that if three Indian Officers could not turn 160 men (which was all the Levy consisted of) into a fairly res pectable force the fault would not lie with the men but with the officers. My audience took my homily in good part, and I think I left a better atmosphere behind me. . ^T.ccrrv-;oh 14 (c) of Bremrier 1 s letter. 6# With regard to paragr-ipa ^ vw Misuse of toe Corps. I discussed this with the Sultan, whose attitude contrary to Bremer 's prognostication in paragraph 18 of his letter was quite helpful. He said that hpar that the Corps had been harassed by he was sorry to hear 'wiau .- r -u-?o absence, and that he would at his subordinates dhring his aoseiu, , tint no reouisition on the Corps should once issue an order that no r^ be made without his personal authority.(\^&gt;y -3- ?• Viith regard 'to the mat-ter of the rifles mentioned in paragraph 15 of Bremner's letter. The Sultan said that he meant that the rifles which he took over from the Levies should be replaced, and paid for, by the Muscat Government not out of the Levy Budget® I left the matter to be settled in detail between the Sultan and Bremner. 8. It seems to me that in this matter of misuse of the Corps Bremer, instead of merely reporting the matter to me3 might well have tackled the local authorities himself, if necessary writing to the Sultan* 9 # With regard to the general attitude of the Sultan towards the Levy Corps, Owing to his minority, and the absentee rule of his lather, the Corps - as well as the other departments of the State - nad inevitably to oe .ran uy us • The Sultan therefore, not unnaturally, came to look on We Corps aa ours - though M Pai d far it ' Wlat we liave t0 dc now, as I impressed on Brenner, Is to make the Sultan feel that the Corps is his , and get him interested in it. It this can he achieved the Sultan will -« all out to help ai*.. tv «e„ that his subordinates do likewise, and will he much more likely - for example - to consider the Important question of raising the Sepoy's pay (see paragraph 4 above). 10. As a slight step to this direction X suggested to Bremner that the Corps should do a small tactical exercise , - thoush of course he had seen them for the Sultan^ bene- it ^ 'hsi(i not yet seen them off .it* ihe on the parade grounct he ha • j ■ ' * , t ,- to or Place, and went off quite well, (it was exercise duly to ok ? ^ « fiet~*t)iece I) s sultan \as well something in the nature of a set .-le w . e ir) -' oh •'» o» conclusion of '» opcnrtlcn. a » «». &lt;•«'' in /(1^ in which lie gave two days holiday.

By the orders of His Highnegs he was shot at dawn to-day# rt is believed, however, that other Harami spies have succeeded in entering Mutt rah and Muscat.

To attack and destroy shaikh H .HA]'T• s Force before his junction with reinforcements. Affecting the attainment of the object. First Force is from the BSNI KAT&gt;lfr &gt; TT ABIN Tribe which is warlike held in rreat fear by many otiier tribes of the land on account of i^s reputation as a swift md ruthless raider ,nd is commanded by one shaikh HAHAMI, a man of considerable experience in war. Second Force is from the B13NI AFFAKIN under shaikh FALATI who has just returned from a successful raid in other parts. Both these leaders have a considerable amount of influence. A junction between these two Forces would be highly undesirable. Our own Forces are in readiness, well equipped and of good Morale and strong in numbers, with a ^reat advantage in having a Man -o'-.var of H.B.JI. present for co-operation. It is possible for the hjnemy Forces to aifect junction on 26th April and the second Force may be considerably swelled in numbers by time oi its arrival in ,) ATAIYA• Loyal tribes to His Hii^h2i ess a3: * e -olio ;intt this latter Force up but may not make contact before possible junction.

(b) Appears to be the better course. It would be possible by a surprise raid to surround him and attack and destroy him before junction is. made. In view of the considerations (&amp;) appears to be the better course. This may be achieved by two methods s- 1. isy an approach through the B .ITALA J - /AT aIYA pass and attack, supported and covered by armaments 2. By moving a striking Force by sea and landing it at a suitable point and delivering the attack under cover of KO / ^s armaments. The latter has the advantage of the element of 3U iPRISS whereas the former may be anticipated, as it is the more obvious. i propose to adopt the latter method and give ray plans for approval below;~ To form a column of Troops composed of 2 platoons Infantry embark it under co ver of darkness in FO / and land it before dawn on V/ATAIYA Beach.

Among the many points raised, the following appear to be the most important r- laces of jrjmbarkation must be surveyed, if time permits| to ensure sufficient depth of water for Boats when laden. Boats laden jith troops supplied with a few paddles each side being towed by a vhaler manned by a seamen crew, appears to be an efficient and quiet method of disembarking, provided diDUmce is not too great. Best for slooy to keep underway during disembarkation and until daylight, to avoid noise of anchoring. As far as is conpatible with safety and secrecy as much information as possioie must be given to all ranks to ensure successful cooperation. Careful attention must be jiven to the order in which Troops ind material isre embarked in order to facilitat. order of disembark'ition. S.fore disembarkation troo s should ba detuiled for their respective dutija on landin; and Ivan, ii* possible, their oraers and necessary information to enable them to carry them out. orders must be given them as to procedure xn case the landin ; is opposed, and boats loaded in such manner as will enable oraers to be carried out. , i vi»ic'+ Hd ni lotted for uJTats on 1 indin,?^ joints of assemoly must be axxou^eu and -uides appointed.
