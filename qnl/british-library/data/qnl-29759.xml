There were present Ur. Laithwaite (in the Chair), Lieutenant Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, end Ur. K.R.Johnstone, Forei^m Office. Ur. Laithwaite said that the meeting arose out of Bushire despatch No.847 S of 20tii July to the Government of India on the subject of foreign consular representation in Bahrein. he Government of India had since intimated that they saw no objection to the discussion of the points in issue by the Political Resident during his leave in this country, but that they wished to be informed of what took place at the discussion and consulted before any decision was taken. 2. The question had arisen in connection with the possibility of an American request to be allowed consular representation in Bahrein; but it seemed desirable not merely to deal with this specific point, but also so far as possible to endeavour to reach agreement on certain broad principles as regards foreign consular representation in the Gulf States. The question was probably a live one in Bahrein and Koweit only, (the position of Muscat being of course special) though it might arise in Qatar in the event of oil being developed in that principality/2 . 2 principality. There was no likelihood at this stage of the question of foreign consular representation arising in the Trucial area. 3. The meeting first discussed the question of the action to be taken in the event of the American Vice-Consul at Bushire repeating his visit to Bahrein/showing signs of consular activity or raising the question whether there would be any objection to his performing consular a«cts in that Principality. The Acting Political Resident had suggested that it might be sufficient on the first occasion, if the Consul were to show signs of such activity, for the Political Agent to draw his attention to the Exclusive Agreement of 1892, between the Sheikh of Bahrein and H.M.G* If the question were then to arise of the Consul performing some specific act at Bahrein, such as the solemnisation of marriage, which was not within the powers of the Political Agent, the Political Agent mi^it reply that as a matter of courtesy he would raise no objection on that particular occasion provided that a request for the act was made by the person concerned through the Political Agent. The Political Agent might add, should circumstances appear to necessitate this, that the question of future procedure would be referred to H.1A.G. 4. The general sense of the meeting was in favour of action on the lines suggested by the Acting Political Resident, with the modification however that it would be undesirable that the American Consul should be allowed to perform in his consul ax . capacity any special act even as a matter of courtesy. 5 ./5. The meeting then turned to consider the possi bility of laying down general principles applicable in the case of Koweit and Bahrein and possibly Qatar, The India Office suggested these might be as foliows:- (a) that we should oppose any attempt to establish foreign consular representatives;. (b) that we should if necessary arrange for the ruler concerned to inform us that he was strongly opposed to their establishment; (c) that if any foreign Power were to raise thepoint we should explain our special Treaty relation with the States in question, and the objections of the local ruler adding that we were not prepared to bring pressure to bear upon the ruler in the matter, but that we would gladly give our fullest good offices to any of the citizens of the interested Foreigi Powers who might find themselves in the Sheikhdoms concerned and would instruct our representative to look after their interests; (d) that in the events referred to in (c) above it might be possible by friendly arrangement with the foreign Power concerned to agree, ihat should that Power consider a mere offer of good offices in general that insufficient^cts which are normally consular acts such as the solemnisation of marriage should be performed as a matter of courtesy (but not as Consular Acts) by the Political Agent, whose action in the matter would be recognised by the interested foreign Powers. 6. Ur._,&gt;aithwaite referred to the previous history of this question. The position of Pus cat was special. It was an independent State with foreign treaties of its own and it would not be possible for us to take exception to a request by an interested foreign Power to establish a consulate at Muscat. The meeting agreed. 7. The Sheikh of Moweit was precluded by his Treaty engagements from receiving the representatives of any foreign power save with the approval of H.M.G. There had been considerable correspondence between 1924/4. 1924 and 1932 as to the possibility ox appointing Persian, Iraqi, or Saudi consular representatives in the Sheikhdom. The Sheikh had taken the strongest exception to any such proposal and it had been necessary to overrule him beiore we could undertake even to oiler our goou offices to Persian subjects in Koweit. (We had in this connection infonnea the Persian Government in 1924 that the appointment of a Persian representative even in an honorary capacity would be contrary to the Agreement of 1899 between the Sheikh and H.M.G. and that any departure from this agreement in f avour of Persia would create a precedent which would prove embarrassing in the event of any other Powers proposing to appoint representatives.) When a suggestion was made at the beginning of 1930 that an Iraqi Vice Consul should be appointed at Koweit, Sir Francis Humphrys was similarly instructed to reply that H.l-.G. were not prepared, having regard to the Agreement of 1899, to sanction the appointment of foreign consular representatives and the natter was not pursued by the Iraqi Government. The Sa udi Go vernment had raised the question in 1932 with Sir Hugh Biscoe, but had dropped it on their attention being drawn to the fact that the grant of consular status/status to their representatives would make it difficult for us to refuse a consular concession to the Persians. 8. In the case of Bahrein the political Resident and the Government of India had been definitely opposed in 1928 to a proposal, made with the object of reconciling Persia to the abandonment of her claims to the Islands, to establish a Persian Agent in the island for face-saving purposes 'and had reported that such a proposal would have to be forced on the ^ ' Sheikh with baa reactions a long the Arab littoral. The appointment of any foreign consular representative would make it difficult to refuse a similar concession to the Persians and the Saudi Government aid it seemed probable that the objections of the sheiKh of Bahrein to any such propose] would be no less definite than those of trie sheikh oi Koweit. 9. GoIonel Fowle expressedh is general agreement with the suggested principles and with the course of action outlined above. He saia that the sheikh of Koweit had*in the past and would still be very strongly ^ opposed to any foreign representation in his State. The same was true of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Apart from any general political objections to the establishment of foreign representation such representation would have to be forced on the/* r the sheikh. If tiie Sheikh was definitely obstinate, while we might overrule him as we had in Kov/eit, as regards the grant of good offices to foreign subjects, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, for us to oblige him to accept foreign rep re sentative s. • mr. Johnstone said that he thought the Foreign Office would not, in the light oi the Resident's remarks, be disposed to dissent from the principles under discussion. It could not, however, be overlooked that while we might shelter behind the Sheikhs in refusing to accept foreign representatives, we should be quite unable to convince foreign Powers that the sheikh was not in fact acting under our instructions. This night lead to some difficulties. 11. Colonel Fowle admitted that this might be the case. But e ven so it made no difference to the facts. Tne objection of the local rulers was real and sincere. In any event foreign Powers could not get behind our statement. 12 regards principle (u) above ifr. Johnstone stated that there appeared to be three particular consular acts in regard to which difficulty was most likely to arise between the Political .Agents at Bahrein or Koweit and foreign nationals, namely the solemnisation of marriages, the/tne registration of births and deaths and the granting of extensions to visas. As regards the first and second - apart from any exceptions which foreign Governments might be inclined to make in the case of marriages, similar to the recognition accorded in English common law to marriages in uncivilised countries contracted in any solemn form - it would in any case be necessary to obtain the consent of the foreign Government concerned to the opening of registers of marriages, births ana deaths recognised by them. And as i^gaicis tiic e xoension oi visas, this function also coula clearly only be delegated to British Political Officers with the consent of the foreign Government concerned. 13. The general sense of the meeting was that it would be best, subject to acceptance t lajJL U&gt;wOLV 'A CU . , of the general principles suggested above by higher authority in the departments concerned and by the Government of India, to seal /»ith speci±ic incidents as they might arise.

Sir, With reference to Mr. Lai thYfal te ’ a letter 6349/33 of the 14th October to TTr.Johnston e, encloainp* the proYlalonal mlrmtea of a neetlnfr held at the India Office on Monday, the 9th October, to consider the question of forelfm consular representation in the Persian Oulf, 1 am direc+ed by Secretary Sir TTohn Simon to request you + o inform Secretarv Sir Samuel Foare, 4 ‘tha + , vfith the reservations set out below, he con curs both in the particular course of action which is recommended in paragraph 4 of those minutes in the event of a visit of the United States Tr ice~Coneul at Push!re to Pahraih, and also in the general principles to be followed in dealinp with the question of foreipn consular representa tion in this region, which are enumerated in Paragraph 5 of the minutes. 2 . ''here nre, however, two points to which I am to request vou to invite Sir Samuel Hoare’s attention, 'Thile concurring in the view expressed in paragraph 4 of the minutes that the Uni+ed Spates Tr i ce-Consul should not be allowed, even as a matter of courtesy, to perform any special acts in his consular capacity. Sir J. Simon considers that in practice, clren if the v ice-Corsul is allowed to perform such acts on the express understanding that they are not to be remanded as done in his consular capacity, it may subseouertlv be found difficult to refute tbe contention that they were in fact con sular/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.eopnulft? acts. It vrill, therefore, “be better rot to allow hin to carry on any of^ici^l acti^rlty whatever in Bahrain or Kuwai t. 3. Secondly, in connection with concl-iision (d) in paraffrach f5 of the minutes of the meeting, consiflerati on has been frlven in this denar+ment to the question what measures would have to be taken in orde-^ to establish on a proper leyal basis the services to be performed by British political officers for foreirners in the \rab b&gt;+a'es of the T’ersien &lt;lulf, supposing that, as Postulated in conclusion (d) , any foreign Power were not content with a general o^fer of the good offices of His Majesty’s Government and it 'became necessary to make some detailed arrangement on that subject with the Power in question. 4. '•'VkiW the different classes of consular services in order; the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction in so far as Hah rain is concerned is already sufficiently provided for, in principle, by Article 8 (p) of the Bahrain O-der in Council. 'Tie position will he the same in Kuwait, if and when the Proposed revised Kuwait Order in Council is issued. 5. As regards ordinary consular assistance and Protection, the legalisation of documents and the registration of births, deaths and marriages, it will be sufficient if instructions are issued by the Secretary of 3t a 'e to the officers concerned empowering them to perform the services in question. 'Hie recognition, however, by foreign courts or authorities of any registers which may bp opened under these instructions mus + of course depend upon the local law of the foreign country con cem ed.6 . ''here remains the question of the celebration of marriages. Sir . T ohr Simon considers it undesirable that the Political Agents R t Bahrain and Kuwait should perform marriages between foreigners. r lie celebration of marriages hy British officers is under the fbreipn I^arriaire Act and that Act only applies where one of the parties is a British subject. Although it mav be legally possible to provide, by Order in Council under the 'oreign Jurisdiction Ac+, for formalities of marriage r °r fo-ejgners subject to British jurisdiction, Sir John Simon ^oes not consider it necessary or desirable to endeavour to legislate suecially for the nurpose of marriages bv these officers between foreigners, to whom the Bahrain (or Kuwait) Order in Council applies. In the first nlace, it is doubtful whether, for instance, such a marriage celebrated by the Political Agent at Bahrain between two Knifed Crates citizens would -oops ess Increased validitv in Knifed Stages law owing to provisions for ouch marriages having been made by Order in Council. Again, Knifed States law, and indeed the laws of most countries, contain principles similar to the Kngli sh common law marriage, under which marriages celebrated by a minister of religion or ner„ verbe..de^praesentl in countries where there is no local form available are recognised aa valid. Since, therefore, in all probability no special leaal provision by Fis Majesty’s Oovemment for such narriayes would increase their validitv in the eves of foreisn governments, it seems best + o leave them to be celebrated in one of the forms referred t o abo ve. 7 * finally, as regards the reyi strati or of marriages, the Secretary of State sees no objection to the ’’olitical Anent been in y a reyister for the narriayes of fbreipners in Bahrain, in which he will record the oarticulars of marriayes reported“by the -narties to have 'beer} celebrated between then and the manner of •’■heir celebration. ^e^intratior of this bind is merely a record of what has + aken place and is in no a celebration of marriage. TTor, a* stated in -narapranh 4 above, would such a register add any validity to the narriape or our- nort to do so, but it mipht assist in the proof of a marriape if the question whether it had been celebrated arose at a later date.
