The amount of detail for each entry therefore varies.The despatches from the Governor General (folios 9-10) discuss the matter of instructions to be issued to the Government of Bombay authorising that government to deploy forces against Persia if authorised to do by the Secret Committee; the Government of India's opposition to the use of Herat as a justification for conflict with Persia is outlined. They also report on the signing of a peace treaty between Nepal and Thibet [Tibet].The section from Bombay (folios 11-12) includes measures to be taken to remove the Al Ali from Demaun, naval deployments against the slave trade, the submission of the Murree [Marri Baloch] tribe to the Khan of Kelat [Kalat], and a telegraphic report that the Persians are besieging Herat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Nepalese-Tibetan War (1855-1856)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Herāt</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Thibet</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049910343.0x000011#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
