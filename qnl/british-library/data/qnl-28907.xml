No. XXIU (ASIA). ILL A ^ 3'^ The main report calls for no special comment. The military situation in Hejaz is not yet clear, as it is impossible to estimate whether the Arabs of the Syrian desert are taking any definite part in the revolt. Should the railway be liable to interruption between Damascus and Ma’an owing to the activities of the Bedawin, the Sherif’s position at Mecca will be fairly secure; but should the Turks establish easy access to Medina, the situation to the south will be precarious. Special attention is drawn to the appendices. Appendix A gives a Christian Arab’s view of his own race, and his appreciation of the Arab situation in America. Both papers show considerable insight. It must be observed that the writer has very little bias, and does not endeavour to describe things other than as they are. The Arab situation in America is more symptomatic of the state of affairs in Arab countries before the war than at present, the repressive measures of the Turks having now brought Moslems and Christians together in Egypt and (so far as can be ascertained) in Syria to a greater extent than heretofore. Appendix B is an instructive communication. It was sent through a second party to this office, and the author desired to remain anonymous. The curious mixture of Islamic fanaticism wrapped in the jargon of the English political journalist is an excellent example of the impact of Western education on Oriental tradition. The writer has evidently been well inoculated with the Committee of Union and Progress bacillus, and obviously prefers a Teuto-Turk who can meet and beat the British in the field to an Arab of undoubted orthodoxy, who will not count as a military power in the future. MARK SYKES. 1 8th July, 1916 (B411) 40 7/10 H&amp;S 85 22 woSECRET. ARABIAN REPORT. (No. XXII a. ASIA.) i5th July, 1916. THE SHERIF OF MECCA. Recent Military Events. In Southern Hejaz the Sherif of Mecca has met with continued success. On 4th July the fort of Mecca that had been holding out surrendered. A few days later the last Turkish garrison in the region, viz. a force of 800 in the barracks, also gave in. The Turkish element has now been eliminated from Mecca. The fort which was holding out against Abdulla at Taif has not yet been taken. In all his sieges the Sherif has pre ferred reducing garrisons slowly by thirst to a rapid decision necessitating bloodshed. The crux of the situation lies in the north. The news from Medina is less favourable than that from Mecca. It appears that the Arabs under Feisal and Ali number about 9,000 and are opposed by 7,000 Turkish regulars. At the outset they attempted to reduce the Turks by cutting off their water; but the water supply was restored, owing to a protest from the townspeople, according to one account, or to religious scruples, according to another. The Turks have been able to break the Arab first line, and from the latest reports it appears that the town is no longer invested. It also seems that only 20 miles or so of the Hejaz railway have been rendered useless instead of the 125 originally reported. The blockade of the Hejaz ports has now been raised. The Sherif has asked that his flag, which is provisionally a dark-red one, shall be respected in the Red Sea. Military Prospects. The military prospects of the Sherif while generally favourable are not altogether so. First. The Turks will clearly make determined attempts to quash the revolt. A telegram from Constantinople confirms the rumour previously reported that Ali Haidar has been officially appointed as Turkish nominee for the Caliphate in place of the Sherif, and there is reason to think that considerable forces will back him up. Further, the Sherif himself has complicated matters by trying to assume too much responsibility. He has endeavoured to take every decision himself, which, in view of the initial lack of organisation and the accumula-ej.jj-lit.1 &lt; ! tion of detail common to any campaign, has proved an impossibility for any one man. Further, he has no one with any experience of administration to help him. There is evidence of intrigue, especially among the Ashraf, who in view of their relationship with the Sherif have assumed most of the commands in his army. Again, the Sherifs hold is not as strong as he himself appears to believe. On the coast, particularly at Rabegh and Yembo, there are Arab parties definitely opposed to him, while Jeddah is split into two factions. His chief need is of efficient assistance in both civil and military spheres. There is not a single trained officer in his army at present, a deficiency which will, it is hoped, be removed by the arrival of the Arab officer prisoners from Egypt* Faruki has suggested that as a start Aziz-el-Masri should be made Commander-in-Chief and Rak Bey Asm a Minister. The Sherif may at any moment find himself in a critical position, unless it be found possible to destroy the Hejaz railway effectively and to cut off the advance of Turkish reinforcements. The Idrisi of Asir and I bn Saud have both written the Sherif friendly letters, placing their services at his disposal. Policy of the British Government. Egypt has been supplying the Sherif steadily with money, arms, and ammunition; but his demands are increasing, not unnaturally, and will con tinue to do so. At the beginning of July he requested another 1,000 rifles with 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition for the Arabs at Medina, whose condition he de scribes as serious. He also wished to have dynamite, presumably for damaging the railway, 500 bombs, and 200 tents. Lastly, he gave an account of the food-stuffs that he would require monthly in future. This last item was absurd, since he asked for enough rations for an army of 2,000,000 men. In connection with these demands Egypt is preparing an estimate of the supplies that could reasonably be given. Inquiries are also being made with a view to ensuring the proper use of the explosives. On 9th July Faruki (who has, at the Sherif’s request, been appointed his official representative) brought a further message to the effect that he wished Allied recognition given to a standing army of 40,000, composed partly of his Hejaz tribesmen and partly of the Arab prisoners from India. This army, he said, would have to be supported by Great Britain, and he would want for it howitzers, machine-guns, Maxims, ambulances, and the loan of aeroplanes. His demands for material are extravagant, and Egypt is allowing most of them to stand over for the present. With regard to men, however, it is hoped to dispatch the Arab prisoners and volunteers soon, together with some Moslem doctors, medical stores, and technical experts. The supply of money presents problems; another ^50,000 was for warded to the Sherif early in July, as sanctioned; but his demands were G3 for ^125,000 per month. On Cairo’s recommendation His Majesty’s Government have authorised the advance of this sum for four months. | The reasons given by Cairo were as follows :— First. To ensure success or even the prospect of success the Sherif must largely increase his army. His own suggestion to raise it to 40,000 has already been mentioned. Secondly. He was definitely encouraged to revolt by Great Britain. Thirdly. At present, owing to the disorganisation of Hejaz, he cannot institute proper taxation and derive a normal income. Fourthly. For the last two years events have precluded the Arabs in Hejaz from storing adequate reserves of food, and there is now practically none left for them to fall back upon in case of emergency. Fifthly. It will be advisable, apart from military consideration, to make up to the Sherif at least as much as he received in regular subsidies from the Turks. , Sixthly. The failure of the rising at such a juncture would have a very serious effect upon British prestige in India, for Great Britain’s hand in the revolt would become public knowledge. Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, there is the question of the Pilgrimage, which involves two expensive items. First, if the Sherif has not enough money to carry on he will inevitably make extortions from the pilgrims. Secondly, Great Britain has announced that all facilities for the Haj are now restored, and to put British reputation above reproach it will be necessary to reorganise J eddah completely: the sanitary conditions there are at present very bad, and everything is in confusion and chaos ; unless this be remedied it will be very hard to provide the pilgrims with proper food and accommodation. This will need a large sum. Incidentally, Cairo is of the opinion that expenses in connection with the Hejaz should be paid from a separate fund, coming nominally from Moslem sources; and the British Government have endorsed this view by directing that in giving subsidies to the Sherif no public reference shall be made to the fact that any of the money is intended for the upkeep of the H oly Places. * The problem of Jeddah is a difficult one in the circumstances. The townspeople are divided in their feelings. The majority are strongly anti-Sherif and have refused the rebels entrance into the city; they profess to desire English occupation, but any Englishman in an “ official ” capacity would be suspected and resented by the Arabs. At the same time it is essential for the pilgrimage that Jeddah should be properly administered and kept in a sanitary condition, and that tele phonic and other communications with Mecca should be maintained. Zeid, the Sherifs son, is too young and has proved useless. Sheikh Mohsin is a good man but ignorant of administration, and there is no other Arab available. Outside control must therefore be brought in. It is suggested by Cairo that some English officer with the necessary qualifications should be given some innocuous title such as “ pilgrim ” officer, and should be supported by Egyptian Moslem subordinates. The Arabs appear to dislike the Egyptian artillerymen intensely; but Cairo ismmmammmmmmrnm ih i confident that they would not resent Egyptians of high degree as temporary organisers of Jeddah. Colonel Wilson, Governor of Port Sudan, is put forward by Cairo for the post. And it is suggested that, if circumstances require it, it will be possible for him to go on leave at the time of the Haj, leaving his subordinates, who would be Moslems, to carry the details through. T/ie Sheriffs Proclamation. A copy of the Sherif’s proclamation to his brother Moslems has just reached Cairo. It appears to be an unpublished rough proof, admitting of revision; it is not yet in Fetwah form. It is, however, a remarkable document; the outline of it is as fo lows. The Sherif recounts his services to the Turks and emphasises the previous unity of Islam. The Committee of Union and Progress, he points out, have treated Hejaz tyrannically, and have violated Islam by allowing the Tomb of the Prophet to be treated irreverently, by giving women the same rights as men, by ordering their soldiery to neglect Ramadan, by changing the customs of the Sacred Court, by submitting the Sultan to the in dignities of degradation, by executing Moslem intellectuals and expel ing their families, by desecrating Abdul Kadir’s grave, and finally by firing three shells into the Kaaba, one of which struck the Black Stone, another fell on Abraham’s Sepulchre, while the third set fire to the Kiswa. Finally, the Sherif declares himself independent of the Committee of Union and Progress, and states that he intends to adhere strictly to the law of Islam, and promote education for all classes. The proclamation is embellished by copious quotations from the Koran. ASIR. The I dr isi. The Idrisi has been as good as his word, and has taken Kunfida; his flag now flies over it, and he has sent 8 officers and 190 men as prisoners to Suez, where they are expected shortly. According to one account the Turkish garrison surrendered direct to British men-of-war. On 9th July a telegram was received from the Resident at Aden to the following effect. The Idrisi is a striking person, and appears to be trustworthy. He would not tolerate any encroachment by the Sherif into Asir; but, at the same time, he told Commander Turton that if the Sherif got to Kunfida or Ibha before him he would not attack him, trusting to our promise to settle the problem when the Turks had been driven out. We are under a treaty obligation to give Idrisi munitions of war, and he cannot be expected to deal with the Turks without them. Guarantees are not needed, because if he were to behave badly he could be easily reduced by blockade of his coasts. Apart from that, however, his feud with the Imam is due to the fact that he cannot forgive the latter for breaking his promise to him in 1910 &gt; und as he himself has now given the Sherif a written declaration of his friendship it is thought that he can be trusted.Aden accordingly urges that he should be given all assistance possible ; and this view is endorsed by a telegram from the Viceroy dated 12th June, who points out that Idrisi has consistently done what his limited resources permitted, and has proved of great political value to us. His first needs are mountain-guns and ammunition. Some 5-inch howitzers and 15-pounders may be available in Egypt, but they would not be so immediately useful. It is apparently not possible to get ammunition for his old Turkish and Italian batteries. In pursuance of his general plan he has left enough troops on his southern borders for defensive but not for offensive purposes. He hopes to attack Loheijah later on, but at the moment he does not wish to rouse the Imam. Aden thinks that it would be well to instruct the Idrisi to come to definite terms with the Hashid and Bakil, and to find out what financial support they need. India supports this, on condition that they prove to be definitely friendly to us and independent of the Imam. The Idrisi has agreed that no movement shall be made with regard to them without orders from us. Aden also recommends that a decision should be arrived at with regard to the status of the various chiefs in the event of the expulsion of the Turks. The Idrisi possibly expects to get the land between Kunfida and Hodeidah, including both, and also the Zaranik tribesmen, some of whom have always been his supporters. His ambitions to the East are unknown, but it is felt that unless something definite is said he may be found later to have expected more than his share, which may cause friction against which it would be well to guard. The Viceroy, however, disapproves of the laying down of post-bellum divisions for any one; because he believes that in the event of success our position will be strong enough to allow us to take the expedient course without any such difficulties. In advocating the opposite course Aden is of the opinion that by con firming Idrisi’s position on the west coast and that of Kaiti, Sultan of Mokalla, on the south, it will be possible to ensure the security of South west Arabia, especially if we make a Protectorate of the south-west corner on a line from Hodeidah to Aden through Taiz. To this India answers that while undoubtedly such an extension of British influence would be of paramount importance, military consideration must take precedence at present of all else. YEMEN. The Imam, The Imam of Yemen is still for all practical purposes sitting on the fence. Aden reports that his assistance to the Turks has not been very considerable, a few thousand men at most. The troops which he sent to threaten Hadramaut have now been withdrawn. It is thought by Aden that if he were convinced that the Turks were in a weak position he might turn round, though probably he will not. Aden6 has written to ask him to join the Arab movement and the Abdali Sultan has done likewise. The wisest course appears to be to leave him to make up his mind for the present. Aden doubts whether it would be wise to offer him any big inducements. The Turks have been giving him ^1,200 a year; and whether he joins in or not he will (unless he be told to the contrary) probably expect to take over the country now politically occupied by the Turks, with Lahej and Sheikh Said. It may happen, therefore, that we shall either have to pay a bigger price for his neutrality than it is worth, or take another line altogether, i. e., by controlling his trade-routes to the coast both east and west, reduce him to a position of economic dependence. India, agreeing with Aden, disapproves of any territorial promises to him, but thinks that if he be willing to help us actively at any time, we should at least ensure him the same amount as he has been receiving from the Turks. NEJD AND JEBEL SHAMMAR. Ibn Sated and Ibn Rashid. An answer has been received from the General Officer Commanding at Basra to the telegram of 30th June which suggested the possibility of a reconciliation between Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid. Ibn Baud’s attitude appears to have been correct throughout. It will be remembered that he recently announced his intention of effecting a recon ciliation with Ibn Rashid if the latter made overtures. Events precluded this possibility; for on his return to Riadh, Ibn Saud was compelled to go on a punitive expedition against the A 1 Morra tribe in the south, while Ibn Rashid went north towards Nasiriyeh. Ibn Rashid’s truculent behaviour near Shaiba and his punishment have already been recorded. It appears that the British force from Shaiba co-operated with the Russlam section of the Shammar and the Dhafir, who are financed by us. In the engagement which took place near Khamsieh 400 of Ibn Rashid’s camels were captured and about 20 of his men were killed. At the present moment Ibn Rashid is still near Khamsieh, but his following and prestige are now so small that his presence is no longer regarded with serious misgivings. There is some chance that the difficulty which he will soon have in getting provisions may induce him to make overtures to us, but Basra thinks it unlikely. For two reasons, however, based on reports, as yet seemingly unconfirmed, it appears probable that he will soon withdraw: first, it is said that he has had a telegram from Constantinople telling him to retire to Hail and await orders; secondly, the son and brother of Ibn Saud have been operating against certain &gt; sections of the Shammar near Hail with success in his absence.7 SYRIA. Turkish Activities. It appears that on 9th April the Turkish Decree condemning to death (by default) the Sultan of Egypt was promulgated in Syria. Jemal Pasha, after hanging and deporting the Syrian Arab leaders who sympathised with the Entente, started an equally drastic campaign against the Pan-Arab movement and has been busying himself with ruthless methods for exter minating the Lebanese Christians by starvation. By the end of May some 25,000 troops had left Syria for the Caucasus. By hanging recalcitrants and suchlike means Jemal Pasha has been forcing paper money on the country and collecting the gold, ,4X50,000 of which was destined for the purchase of transport camels from Ibn-el- Rashid. Condition of the People. The health conditions in this country are deplorable. Drugs are no longer to be had. The death-rate from infectious diseases is appalling. The Maronite Patriarch returned to the Lebanon with 30 tons of flour, and other consignments have subsequently been allowed to pass in. Possibility of Revolt. If it is true that the Anazeh and the Druses are already actively sup porting the Arab movement in the district east of the line Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Damascus, Deraa, it is possible that the tribes in the polygon Meskene — Deir-zer-tel-Afar — Jeziret-ibn-Omar — Mardin — Ras-ul-Ain — Haraan—Meskene may follow their lead at any moment. If the situation develops on these lines the operations of the Grand Duke between Sairt and Rowanduz would be materially assisted. The French Government. Captain Picart suggested unofficially at Cairo on 4th July that the French should make a demonstration in Syria in order to assist the Sherif. Captain Picart thought that native troops with French equipment and a French technical detachment would be the first move, followed probably by a body of Allied troops in support. A non-committal attitude was adopted in answer, and the question has been referred to London. It is thought in some quarters that until the Sherif changes his attitude towards the French any such steps might involve unpleasant complications, and that it is therefore better for him to endeavour to consolidate his position in Hejaz for the present independently of Allied intervention in Syria. SINAI. Enemy Activities. Down to the end of June all was reported quiet. The progress of the railway appears slow; the rail-head is now if miles north-east of Kossaima. There have been no military activities of any significance on either side.MESOPOTAMIA. The situation on tho Tigris is unchanged, and the available news centres round the activities of the tribes. From the report of an agent it appears that the Arabs at Kerbela are now against the Turks, and would assist the British in the event of an advance in that direction. The same agent states that the Turks at Ersingjan are very short of munitions, and would collapse if attacked. On the other hand, certain hostile Arabs have been moving in boats through the western marshes, led, it is said, by Turkish officers. Already one convoy has been attacked on Lake Hamar. The necessary precautions are being taken; two gunboats and three armoured launches are being sent to guard the Tigris lines of communication between Qalat and Qurnah. CAUCASUS. Military Events. The Russian force in the Kermanshah region has been gradually retiring before a numerically superior Turkish force. The German pressure at Kovel prevented the dispatch of troops from General Alexieff to General Baratoff. In view of the consequences that might follow the fall of Kermanshah the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that the Russian Government would be grateful if Indian troops could be sent to reinforce General Baratoff, but this was apparently found im practicable. It appears that on 30th June a strong Turkish force, supported by Kurds and with 16 guns, advanced from Mahidasht against the Russian positions west of Kermanshah. Severe fighting took place, as a result of which the Russian forces were compelled to evacuate Kermanshah on 1st July. They retired in good order to a point between Kermanshah and Bisitun. On 2nd July the Turks resumed their offensive, and General Baratoff’s rearguard was forced to retire to Hajiabad. At the present moment the Turks have halted midway between Kermanshah and Bisitun and the Russians are facing them. The general opinion in Teheran is that if the Turks mean to advance further the Russians will not be able to hold them owing to their inferiority in numbers. The Turkish objective is thought to be Teheran ; according to the latest news, however, the Turks are entrenching opposite Bisitun, and are at present not attempting to advance further. Effects of the Russian Retirement. The effects of the Russian withdrawal from Kermanshah may be con siderable. One thousand hostile Kelbag Kurds have been reported as moving between Sihna and Bijar. There seems to have been an outburst of feeling throughout Kurdistan, instigated by agitators preaching a Jehad.Shiraz. In Persia it has not yet been possible to gauge the full effect of the news, but the political situation is far from stable. In Shiraz, for instance, Soulet had been amenable before the news of Kermanshah (chiefly owing to a movement among his relations against him), but he was discontented and known to be in touch with the German prisoners in the hands of the Kawam, who seemed to be under his influence. The Kawam appeared loyal, and wished to leave Shiraz for his summer quarters. But as it is thought possible that Soulet may seduce him, anxiety is felt as to the result of the news of Kermanshah. Teheran has suggested that Colonel Gough should go to Shiraz from Ispahan to strengthen the hands of the Deputy-Governor. This has been sanctioned provided that Colonel Gough can travel with safety. Teheran. In Teheran the news of the Russian reverse was received with satis faction ; and it is thought that if the Russians retire again the Cabinet will be unable to maintain itself. Its popularity has been rapidly waning. The Bakhtiaris in Teheran hold the view that the Turkish advance will not last, and it is thought that their support could be gained. The Russian Minister has been approached with a view to sending Jang and Bahadur to Bakhtiaristan, and he has agreed to this provided that the Russian forces now in Ispahan be withdrawn. If this were done Teheran suggests that Jang should be appointed Governor of Ispahan; for though his appointment would not be liked by the Russians or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it would help to gain the loyalty of the tribe. It is urged that unless the support of the Bakhtiaris be gained, trouble might ensue in other parts of Persia; the defection of the Pars tribesmen would, in particular, be a severe blow to us. EFFECT OF THE NEWS OF THE REVOLT. Egypt. The revolt seems to have had little effect on Egypt. The news has excited little comment. No parties have committed themselves to any decisive expressions of opinion. The prevalent belief is that if the Sherif succeeds he will have many sympathisers there ; but that if he fails he will be blamed for his rashness. The Anglophobe party call the Sherif alternately a rebel against the Caliph or a slavish tool of Great Britain. The Islamic Press in general have said little, but seem to think that the Turks will easily deal with what to them appears no more than one more phase in the Arabs’ struggle against Turkey. The lower classes do not disbelieve the news. Some of the Fellaheen and the artisan classes, with a proportion of the Alazhar University students, express pleasure at the thought that the Arabs may have a chance of civilisation and progress if they throw off Turkish control. Enlightened circles agree that the failure of the Sherif would be disastrous to the cause of Islam.10 Morocco. In Morocco the rising has made a profound stir. The people are satisfied with the Sherif’s action, but apparently are apprehensive of the Holy Places being controlled by a single Christian Power for the future The French Government thinks that the danger of this impression could be removed by concerted action between France and Great Britain so far as outward official dealings are concerned. A Igeria. The Bedouins have welcomed the revolt, and the French position in Algeria has been improved by the news. Tunis. In Tunis, where Turkish control has always been admired, regret at its failure will continue to be felt until the Sherif has shown his sincerity and power of organising the pilgrimage on proper lines. In Tunis, Morocco, and Algeria the French have been careful to give no more information than was transmitted by the British Government. Zanzibar. The Sultan has sent the Sherif a telegram, on behalf of himself and his subjects, congratulating him on his attempt to free the Holy Places from Turkish oppression. Mesopotamia. Basra finds that the minds of the Arabs move so slowly that it is not yet possible to gauge the effect of the news. The Shiah Arabs appear pleased. The few really enlightened Sunni Arabs are openly delighted. The lower classes either cannot grasp its significance properly or discredit it altogether. N.B .—The Kerbela incidents will have more effect in Persia than in Irak, where the majority are Shiah and anti-Persian. OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT TO MOSLEMS IN THE BRITISH DOMINIONS. The following is a paraphrase of a telegram which was dispatched by His Majesty’s Government to Egypt on nth July for publication to British Moslem subjects:— “ For a long time the Arabs, resentful of Turkish oppression, have been awaiting a chance of regaining their liberty; they have often risen against Turkish misrule in the past. The wrongs committed by the present Government in Constantinople and its servility to Germany have brought Turkey into a terrible war and have brought Arabian matters to a head. The Sherif of Mecca and other chiefs have resolved to cast off the fetters of Turkey and declare themselves independent.11 In the past, Great Britain, though sympathising with the ideals of the Arabs, has done nothing because of her historical goodwill towards Turkey. ^ Turkey has now joined the enemy, so Great Britain can now show her sympathy with the Arabs in a practical form. Great Britain, as before, will in no way interfere in religious matters, and will endeavour by all the means in her power to keep the Holy Places safe from intrusion. Great Britain is as firmly determined as ever that the Holy Places shall remain under the free Moslem rule. In spite of the peril and confusion caused by the war Great Britain hopes that, as a result of the Sherif’s action, pilgrims will for the future be able to visit the Holy Shrines again without trouble or danger.” MOSLEM FEELING IN INDIA. General Situation. The condition of Moslem opinion in India continues to give the Government much cause for anxiety. The general tendency amongst Moslems is to regard the Arab revolt impartially but to say that it is a misfortune on the ground that it threatens the immunity from sacrilege of the Holy Places. The publication of the fact that the Turks have shelled the Kaaba is on this account to be deprecated. Anti-Arab feeling however, is also apparent, educated Indian Moslems sympathising in the main with the Turks. The Sherif is considered to have behaved with ingratitude towards the Porte; and the severity of his immediate adminis tration is contrasted with the mildness of Turkish suzerainty. No advantage to pilgrims is consequently anticipated from his establishing his independence. Also, the idea of any invasion of Arabia by non-Moslem troops is repugnant to Moslem feeling, and any measure of this sort, unless balanced by decisive success, would be ill justified. There is, besides, considerable apprehension that a non-Moslem suzerainty in the Hejaz may be established, and a declaration to the contrary would be received with relief. Districts Chiefly Afl r ected. The districts principally affected are the North-west Frontier Provinces and the neighbourhood of Cawnpore and Lucknow, and there are indica tions of trouble in Delhi, Bombay, and Bengal. By far the greatest alarm is felt, however, with respect to Afghanistan, where the anti-Arab movement, if successful, might drive the Amir to abandon his policy of neutrality. In India an anti-Sherif agitation has met with support from the All India Moslem League, the Punjab Moslem League, the Khuddam-I-Kaaba and the Council of Madras Presidency Moslem League, the Paisa Akbar newspaper at Lahore, which was formerly loyal, and the Sadaqat newspaper at Calcutta. Amongst Indian Princes the Begum of Bhopal appears to be indifferent; the Nizam of Hyderabad to be waiting to see what fortune the revolt meets with; and the Nawab of Tonk to be friendly with the Sherif but sceptical as to his success.12 Policy of British Government. The policy of the British Government is to separate as clearly as possible the religious and political aspects of the Arab revolt. The Indian Moslems are to be assured on the one hand that the choice or recognition of a Caliph is acknowledged by England to be a matter for the decision of Moslems alone, and that the decision when made will be treated with respect by the British Government, and on the other hand to be reminded that the Turks have chosen to force hostilities upon the British Empire, and that pro- Turk propaganda cannot therefore be tolerated. The Viceroy has been advised to take steps in this sense. Exception was taken by the Indian Government to the circular telegram, sent from Teheran by Mr. Marling, under instructions from the Foreign Office, which made public the fact that British ships had bombarded the Red Sea coast. Arrangements are accordingly being made that In future nothing should be published in Persia by the British representative without consulting the Indian Government. The Viceroy has at the same time been advised to issue a clear statement denying that the British Fleet shelled the Holy Places. The Viceroy has also made representations that it is most desirable that the British connection with the Arab revolt should be, so far as possible, suppressed; and that, unless a Syrian expedition can be arranged, the only assistance given to the Sherif should be in money, arms, and equipment. With regard to the first point he has received satisfactory assurances from the Foreign Office. fAPPENDIX A. THREE ARTICLES BY AN ARAB, A. P. ALBINA. (i) THE FUTURE OF THE ARAB RACE. The Arab Race. Speaking of the Arab race in the present instance, I refer exclusively to the Arabs inhabiting Syria, Palestine, the Irak, Mesopotamia, and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula at present under Turkish rule. The Arabs have very often been described in books and articles published by occasional travellers as a decadent, greedy, and lazy race. This impression was gathered by superficial observation and not through deep and sound study. The real Arab is noble, intelligent, and chivalrous, and possesses many qualities that are capable of development and improve ment under a just and beneficent rule. Even the unruly nomad tribes have redeeming features, and, although naturally inclined to raid and plunder, are of a frank and generous disposition. They take pride in hospitality and while a guest is under their roof they will protect him at the risk of their own lives. Centuries of servitude under Turkish rule have not demoralised the race or deprived it of its innate qualities. A very large percentage of Arabs have been denied the benefits of civilisation and elementary education; yet they have kept intact their literature and traditions and thwarted the endeavour of the Turks to crush and Ottomanise their race. The Turks have always realised that only through religion could they strengthen their power and make their rule absolute. To this end they usurped the Caliphate and proclaimed themselves the protectors of Islam all over the world. They knew that religion was the only bond that would keep Arab Moslems under their control and, as their motto has always been “ Divide et impera ”, they made unlimited use of it for fostering their own ends by keeping dissension rife between Moslem and Christian Arabs, and by creating a feeling of diffidence towards European Powers. Educated Arabs, however, have laid bare the schemes of the Turks, and have been endeavouring to obtain the emancipation of their country from Turkish rule. Unfortunately, owing to Turkish intrigues, it has not been possible yet to form a close and compact union amongst the Arabs themselves, although they all, without exception, abhor the Turk. For religious fanaticism is still too deeply rooted in the hearts of the ignorant masses to be easily eradicated. Only time and a wise rule will be able to annul the effects of Turkish intrigue. This mutual diffidence amongst the tribes is one of the principal factors that must be considered when deciding the future form of government to be granted to the Arabs.ill K ■ « 14 European Influence in Arabia. French Influence. France has always claimed Syria and Palestine as her zone of influence and her share in the spoils of the Turkish Empire on its dissolution. She was indeed admitted to be the protector of the Christians in Turkey, but this was only a nominal privilege, as, except perhaps in Mount Lebanon, the Turkish Government never permitted France to interfere. French protection in practice confined itself to the Sanctuaries and to Catholic missionaries and clergy. At one time French influence was so supreme in Turkey that all Europeans and even Catholic natives were indiscriminately called Franzi French. But this supremacy has waned since the fall of Napoleon III and the instauration of the Republic. It received a severe blow at the time when the French Government legislated for the separation of Church and State and renounced the Concordat with the Pope. Italy, Germany, and Spain, who had been trying to undermine French influence, seized their opportunity and claimed for themselves the right of protecting their missionaries and priests; while Turkey, for her own purposes, worked secretly to stimulate the dissension. France then woke up, but while she was engaged in a diplomatic struggle to recover her vanishing influence in the Near East, the present war broke out. French authority with the Turkish Government had suffered a hard blow: but her influence with the Christian populations is nevertheless still strong, founded as it is on education. French institutions such as hospitals, schools, and orphanages under the direction of French missionaries are very numerous and are given generous assistance by the Government. France obtained most of the railway concessions in Syria and Palestine. French missionaries and teachers in Turkey enjoy the same privileges as Government officials and are exempted from military service. Their principal task is to spread French influence amongst the populations and to instil a love for France into the young. To the J esuit university in Beyrout the French Government extended the same privileges as to Government schools and universities in France. There is no doubt that propaganda of this kind has had a great influence, and accounts for the attachment of Syrians and Arab Christians to France. British Influence. British influence has never had any great sway amongst the Arabs. Although England enjoys great prestige in the Near East, and especially in Mesopotamia and with certain Arab tribes, and has always been considered the mightiest nation in the world, she has been looked at by the Arabs with awe and respect rather than affection and sympathy. English diplo matic and consular agents, with few exceptions, have kept aloof from the natives and have made no efforts to secure their sympathy. I must own that England’s prestige with the Arabs has been appreciably shaken during the present war for many reasons, chiefly the failure of the Gallipoli expedition and the fall of Kut. English influence, not being based on *sound educational propaganda, was dealt a heavy blow. There are, it is true, a great number of English schools, hospitals, and missions in Turkey, but not one of these is purely educational. They are either sectarian or instituted exclusively for the benefit of the Jews. They only draw a certain class of people who are on the look-out for personal benefits, and are not animated by zeal or sympathy for England. I believe that Syrians who had emigrated to Egypt and British colonies did more to foster British influence amongst their fellow countrymen in Turkey than all the English Missions and Schools. They have been the most valuable asset to British rule in Egypt, and always upheld it against the intrigues and machinations of Egyptian nationalists and Turkish emissaries. German Influence. In dealing with German influence in Turkey it will not be necessary to give any account of all the German intrigues during the reign of Abdul Hamid and the dictatorship of the Young Turks. The facts are too recent and too vivid to have been forgotten. Germany has always aimed at monopolising Turkish trade and controlling the Turkish Army. Ihe Emperor himself laid the foundation-stone of this policy when he visited Turkey in 1897. It was then pursued steadfastly by Marshal von Bieber- stein and von Wagenheim, aided by von der Goltz. We have had a striking proof of their success in the present war. Germany not only in duced Turkey to join her against the Allies, but actually became the despotic ruler of the Turkish Empire. As a consequence, however, she had no influence or sympathy with the Arabs. The Germans are classed with the Turks as brutal aggressors, and not unnaturally, since German consular agents and German colonists in Syria and Palestine treated the natives as an inferior race. Their insolent behaviour gave rise to bitter dislike, which often led to quarrels, and even on one or two occasions to the murder of Germans by Arab peasants. In a word, the Arab feeling for Germany and the Germans is one of intense hatred. Russian Influence. Turkey has always regarded Russia as her hereditary enemy and the Turkish Government have always tried to instil a hatred of Russia into the masses. Russia’s influence with the Arabs is limited to those of a common religion, i.e. the Greek Orthodox. The Best Rule for the Arabs. The Arabs, whatever their religion, look upon England and France for their emancipation from Turkish tyranny. The following is an attempt to state fairly and clearly what, in the writer’s opinion, would be the best form of rule for the Arabs in the future. There are three courses worthy of consideration : (1) complete inde dependence j (2) some form of Protectorate under the Powers interested, (3) autonomy under European control. Complete independence is advocated by a small number of Arabs16 only, i. e. by the irresponsible and unscrupulous self-seekers. No intelligent and sane-minded Arab can, at the present moment, wish for complete independence, since he knows that it would spell disaster and throw Arabia into the throes of chaos and anarchy worse even than the Turkish rule. For centuries past the Arabs have been ruled by the Turks, who always managed, for their own aims, to keep alive the spirit of hatred and intolerance amongst the various religious denominations, not only by inciting Moslems against Christians, but also by sowing dissension amongst the different Christian sects. It will take years of wise and impartial rule to undo the evil wrought by the Turks and restore goodwill and union. To grant the Arabs self-government at present would mean discontent and trouble, a renewed interference of European Powers, and an open gate for German intrigues. A Protectorate, under England and France in their respective zones of influence, would be very welcome and, in my opinion, the best solution of the Arab question. The examples of Tunis and Morocco under the French, and Egypt under the British prove to us the suitability of this form of government in Arab countries, Such a Protectorate would promote education and bring prosperity combined with moral and material progress. It would also enable the protecting Powers to grasp the situation and deal with it properly. If a Protectorate is not adopted, some form of autonomy under close European control remains the only means of settling the Arab question. To make this effective, close control and supervision by the interested Powers would be essential, for the same reasons as have been advanced in dealing with the alternative of complete independence. The Arab is vigorous and intelligent but is not yet ready for self-rule. He needs advice and guidance, and must learn to shake off old prejudices and dis sensions. Under the tutorship of a just and strong nation alone can he hope to effect a regeneration. Christian Element. \\ hatever be the future of Arabia, the Arab Christians must not be overlooked. They are entitled to a proper share in the administration of their country. For some reason the Moslems have always had first consideration so far, although the Christians have always proved themselves the staunch supporters of France and England. 'The Necessity of a Prompt Settlement. An immediate settlement of the question is desirable in any case, for evera reasons. First and most important is the necessity of restoring t le prestige of the Allies, which has suffered a heavy blow after the checks m the Balkans, at Gallipoli, and in Mesopotamia. Secondly, for months past persecution has been rife in Syria and Palestine. The Turks have taken everything they could lay hands on, and a famine has resulted. i&lt;or about two years Syria and Palestine have been shut off from the rest o the world and no food has entered the country; the little that the landproduced has been requisitioned by the Turco-Germans for themselves and the Army^ The people have been literally starved. Even before the war the country, as a result of extortion and robbery, had to depend mainly on Europe for food-supplies. Great Britain entered the war to protect small nationalities. The Arab nation has been for centuries under a hard tyranny. But in any case, if the Allies wish to crush Turkey, it is probable that the simplest way would be the occupation of Syria and Palestine. The Syrian Coast is the most vulnerable part of the Turkish Empire, and the masses of the people are favourable to the Allies. Once the Turkish armies in Syria and Mesopo tamia are cut from Constantinople they will be demoralised. The effect of their surrender on the whole Eastern front from the Balkans to Baghdad would be very great. The Allies would regain their prestige, and England would remain in the eyes of the Arabs the greatest Power in the world. (2) THE ARAB EMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. General Remarks. The number of Arab and Syrian emigrants in the United States is about 300,000. Over two-thirds are Christians of different denominations and the rest Moslems and Druses. They are distributed all over the United States and dwell especially in large cities and manufacturing centres. There are, for instance, about 15,000 in New York, about 4,000 in Boston, 3,000 in Cleveland, 5,000 in Chicago, and 3,000 in Philadelphia. The chief line of business that they follow is the import and sale of cheap cotton fabrics, lace, and embroideries. In Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Illinois several thousands are employed as factory hands, earning from six to ten shillings per day. A large number earn their living by peddling in the large cities and suburbs, going from house to house and selling lace, &amp;c. A few have prospered and made money, but the majority of them are in humble circumstances. Unlike other nationalities, the Arabs, and Syrians in the United States have never raised themselves into promi nence or ever had any influence in American public life. They do not seem to have great ambitions or to aspire to any distinction, but generally live and trade in the poorer quarters of the cities. They are not bound together by any link or tie of solidarity, and apart from local societies and clubs of very little importance they have no national organisation whatever. They seem to have brought with them and kept the traditional spirit of dissension and diffidence. In the United States, as in Turkey, Christians shun Mohammedans and vice versa, and, further, there is no love lost between the different Christian denominations. This apathy, which has become a second nature to them, is undoubtedly the outcome of centuries of Turkish rule. From the Americans too they seem to have acquired greed and a love of money but none of the18 nobler and higher qualities. 1 They are patriotic enough and well-wishers for the future welfare of their country, but they do not try to bring their cause before the public. Further, each one is interested in the province only from which he came; and none of them seem to have any conception of a national Arab cause. Even the leading Arabic newspapers published in America concern themselves principally with questions affecting the present conditions and future sorts of Mount Lebanon and Syria and very seldom deal with the broader issues of a national cause. Apart from a natural apathy I know that the principal reason for the inaction of the Arabs in the United States is the fear of reprisals on the part of the Turks against their relatives in Turkey. Every time a man has made bold to denounce Turkish misdeeds his relatives in Turkey have been severely dealt with and his property confiscated. The majority of the Mohammedan Arabs in the United States boast of their loyalty and attachment to the Turkish rule. They inwardly hate the Turks, but consider that they must rally to them for the defence of the Mohammedan religion and in order to thwart the aspirations of the Christians. As long as Turkey is not crushed they will stick to her, if only for fear of revenge, but they will welcome any sort of government that will liberate them from Turkish tyranny. What both Christian and Mohammedan Arabs need is a leader of great energy and influence who could arouse their better feelings and bring forth the union of all Arabs, forming an Arab national league both in Northern and Southern America. This will be a very great asset to the future welfare of the Arab race and will greatly help its development both in tellectually and commercially. Emigration has proved to be a great boon to other nations, and there is no reason why it should not benefit the Arabs if they could only be drawn closer together and unite. The above scheme, however, can only be realised when Turkey is made powerless to strike, as at present too great is the fear of reprisals and revenge. Interviews. In my different interviews with Arabs during my visit to the United States I found that they were reticent and diffident, being afraid to express an opinion. However, I managed to draw from them all the information I wanted. My first interview in New York was with Suleiman Baddour, a Druse from Mount Lebanon, editor of the newspaper A l Bay an, which is a kind of semi-official paper inspired by Turkish officials and the only Arabic newspaper published in America that can be introduced into Turkey. Baddour is considered to be a shrewd and intelligent man. The policy of his newspaper is naturally pro-Turkish and pro-German. Baddour W a s ^ffi^nt at first and tried to be non-committal, but I allayed his suspicions by representing myself as the correspondent of an (imaginary) i ne eastern mind has an unequalled aptitude for assimilating the bad and reiectinn good m any system it meets.”-Stanley Lane-Poole, ^ a Mos q ue.neutral review to be published at Zurich. I asked Baddour what his opinion was about the future of Turkey after this war. He said that the future of Turkey depended on the outcome of the war. If Germany, as he firmly believed, wins the war, then Turkey will become a great Power and will reap the benefits of her alliance with the Central Empires. She will not be, as she has been in the past, subservient to England, France, and Russia, who abused her of weakness and actually deprived her of her sovereign rights. Germany, he said, being the ally of Turkey, will safeguard the latter’s independence and dispense to the populations of Turkey the advantages of education and culture. She will, besides, help her materially and financially, and with the help of Germany the Turkish Empire will thrive and attain a great prosperity. “ But supposing”, I said, “that Germany was beaten, what would happen to Turkey?” He raised his hands as to avert a calamity and said, “ Germany cannot be beaten; her Fleet has just inflicted a crushing defeat on the British Fleet, and she is growing stronger every day/ But if she is defeated, then Turkey, of course, will be doomed to ruin, as her lot is intimately connected with Germany.” I asked Baddour what he thought of the Arab question. He said that there was no such question. The bulk of the Arabs were very loyal to the Sultan and would not dissociate themselves from his rule. Only a small number, he said, of hot-headed Christian Arabs, lured by England, were foolishly raising the question of independence. The Arab Mohammedans in Turkey and all over the world are staunch supporters of the Caliph. The Moslems in Egypt, he said, are all ready for a general uprising against England as soon as the Turco-Germans land in Egypt. The seventy million Indian Mohammedans would have answered the call of Holy War and risen against England : but they are powerless; the English are ruling them with an iron grip and watches that no arms or ammunition reach them. I asked Baddour if he knew of any pamphlets of Turkish propaganda in New York, as I wished to study the Turkish point of view thoroughly. He said that they did not have any in America, as the Americans had very little interest in Turkey, but he said, “You can get them at Zurich, which is the centre of Turkish propaganda.” From the general trend of my conversation with Baddour I gathered that the man was rather shaky in his convictions about the future greatness of Turkey. His hopes are founded on Germany, of whom he is a great admirer. Baddour asked me not to mention his name if I published our interview in the review: I promised him that I would not mention his name in any review. Naoum Mokarzal is a Maronite from Lebanon, and a man of certain education and good standing amongst his fellow countrymen. He is the editor in New York of the Arabic newspaper Al Houda, whose policy is chiefly anti-Turkish and prepense to the Allies, especially France. Mokarzal does not deal in his newspaper with the general Arab question, but confines himself almost exclusively to the present condition and future asset of Mount Lebanon. When I saw Mr. Mokarzal in his office in Washington20 Street he was wailing over the present conditions of Mount Lebanon. He said to me that if the Allies did not come soon to the rescue there will not be any one left in Mount Lebanon. The Turks, he said, were systematic ally starving the population to death by cutting all food-supplies from reaching the Lebanese. When Enver Pasha was last in Syria, and noticed the ferment of the Christians of Lebanon against the Turks and their sympathy for the Allies, in order to punish them he gave orders that no food-supplies be introduced into Lebanon. Enver thought that he could exterminate the Christians by starvation and justify his action by claiming that the distress was due to the Allies, who put an embargo on food-stuffs being shipped into Turkey. Mokarzal said that Djevad Pasha, who seemed formerly to be friendly to the Christians, had become very hostile. He is responsible for several executions of notable Syrians that took place of late. Mokarzal concerns himself almost exclusively in the future of Mount Lebanon, for which he advocates independence, with the guarantee of the Allies and under French protection. He would not make a statement regarding the future settle ment of the Arabian Peninsula; he only said that any form of government would be welcome to the Arabs so long as they are rid of Turkish tyranny. I must say that this is the opinion of the majority of the Arabs I came in contact with during my visit to the United States. Dr. Ayoub Tabet, from Beyrout, is a very influential member of the Syrian colony in New York. He is an implacable and sworn enemy of the Young Turks. Owing to his political activities he had to leave Syria some years ago and seek refuge in America, where he resumed his battle-cry against Turkey and exposed the misdeeds of her rulers. He is fearless. He has been sentenced to death in Turkey as a traitor. Dr. Tabet considers the policy of England and France towards Turkey in the course of this war as weak and vacillating. He thinks that if the Allies had landed troops on the Syrian coast, where the population in their majority are in their favour, a fatal blow could have been dealt to Turkey. The Irak disaster might have been averted, the Turco-German expedition against Egypt would have fallen through, and a large contingent of the troops concentrated in Egypt for the defence of the Suez Canal could have been used on other fronts. Furthermore, the population of Syria would have been spared the great distress, starvation, persecutions, and hangings. “ However,’’ he said, “ I do not pretend to judge the Allies as they must have had sound strategical reasons that influenced their actions.” Dr. Tabet had lately received information from a reliable source in Egypt that the American Consul in Beyrout delivered to the Turkish authorities there the archives of the French Consulate that had been left in his charge. The information was published a few days later in American newspapers with a scathing remark by Dr. Tabet on American breach of faith to France. Dr. Tabet believes that autonomy, under effective control of the interested Powers, would be the best form of government for Syria. As for the rest of the Arabian Peninsula the Allies would have to devise the best means of government.21 Emir Said Arslan, a Lebanon Druse of a very prominent family, is the editor of the Arabic newspaper^/ Ikhaa (The Fraternity), of a doubtful pro-Turkish tendency and apparently as bitter against England and the Allies as its contemporary A l Bay an. A brother of Emir Arslan was for some time Consul-General of Turkey in Brazil, but on account of his anti- Young Turk proclivities he was relieved of his post. I was introduced to the Emir by a young Syrian, Saleem Hatem, as a friend of the latter. Emir Arslan surprised me by saying that his personal ideas were diagonally opposed to the policy of his newspaper, but as he was catering to the Mohammedan immigrants in America he had to follow a policy favourable to Turkey. He personally thinks that the Young Turks have led the Empire to the brink of ruin, and that whatever the issue of this war may be the Turkish Empire was doomed. Whatever Power assumed control of Turkey would be better than the Turks, and the population of the Empire, indistinctly of race and religion, would derive large benefits from a change of government. In spite of the anti-British attitude of his newspaper he is personally inclined to England, and is in favour of the annexation of Syria and the Arabian Peninsula to Egypt. This he told me in confidence. From a private reliable source I found out that Emir Arslan is not &amp; persona grata to Turkish officials in America, and is regarded with suspicion owing to his and his brother’s antecedents. His newspaper is not allowed to be introduced into Turkey. I asked Emir Arslan what he thought of the information received from Egypt of wholesale starvation in Lebanon. He said he could not believe that the population of Lebanon was being purposely starved by the Turks, but he admitted that there was a great distress and shortage of food in Syria and Lebanon. The Turks were illtreating the populations, and several notables, both Christians and Mohammedans, had been deported to the interior and some executed. On my return from Chicago I called again on Emir Arslan, and asked him what he thought of the latest report in the papers of an uprising in the Hejaz headed by the Sherif of Mecca. He said that the report was not official, but it might be true, in which case it would be very serious. Then he said, “ The uprising has surely been engineered by England.” I personally believe that Emir Arslan, if properly handled, can be a valuable asset in the future government of Syria, owing to his intelligence, personality, influence with the Druses, and the prominence of his family. Zia Diab, a Greek Catholic from Beyrout, is the editor of the Arabic newspaper Miraat-el-Gharb (Mirror of the West). Mr. Diab has spent several years in Egypt and is greatly in favour of the English. He is broad-minded and very intelligent, and is known as one of the staunchest opponents of the Young Turks. In his newspaper he is the exponent of an anti-Turkish policy. I asked Mr. Diab what he thought the attitude was of the Arabs in the United States towards the future settlement of the Arab race. He said that there was no such thing in America as a national Arab movement, and no unity of purpose between the emigrant Arabs. Their ambitions and aspirations were limited to each individual’s district or province. The one thing that the Arab Christian almost unani-22 1 : mously agreed to was a longing for the freedom of their country and its emancipation from Turkey. The Mohammedans, he said, in their hearts wish it as much as the Christians, only they dare not express their views; Those who boasted of their attachment to the Turkish Government and their loyalty to the Sultan did it simply in order to antagonise the Christians. Other Mohammedans believe that it is their duty to uphold the Caliph. I asked him which, in his opinion, was the European Power that claimed the sympathy of the Arabs. He said the Maronites and Catholics were in their majority in favour of France, other Christian denominations and Moslems were generally inclined towards England. Russia claimed the sympathy of a small number of Greek Orthodox. Mr. Diab himself, having lived in Egypt and seen the beneficial results of English occupation, would personally welcome an English protectorate over Syria. I asked him, “Ifthe Arabs were granted their independence would they be able to rule themselves ? ” He emphatically said that it was an impossibility, and it would be more disastrous to the country than Turkish rule. He pointed out the condition of the Arabs in the United States, where, in spite of the liberal laws, freedom and justice, the Arabs still stuck to the spirit of dissension and discord amongst themselves. Other interviews I had in New York with Shukri Baccash, editor of the Arabic newspaper^/ Fatal\ Joseph Khouri, editor of the Arabic news paper El Shaab. Both publications pursue an anti-Turkish policy, their chief object being the emancipation of Syria from the Turks. The influence of the Arabic Press in America would be far greater and more efficient if the editors cast aside their petty jealousies and dissensions, united together, and strove for the future well-being of the Arab race. I have also had conversations while in New York with Michael Haddad, clerk in the offices of the New York Evening Mail\ Saleem Hatem, a bright and intelligent youth ; Abbas Abou Chakra and Emin Saad-Eddin Abdullah, co-editors of the Al Akhaa, and several others. I have mingled with the Arabs, both Christians and Mohammedans, and from the trend of my conversation with them I can safely say that an ideal for a national Arab cause does not exist. Their aspirations are limited to their own province and district. Sympathies are almost equally divided between France and England. Several Christians dare not voice their opinions for fear of being reported to the Turkish officials and punishment dealt to their relatives in Turkey and their properties confiscated. The Mohammedan element outwardly supports Turkey, believing it to be its religious duty. It cannot hide the fact, however, that Turkey is on the brink of ruin, but it founds its hopes on Germany for the reconstitution and $he future prosperity of Turkey. In Boston I interviewed Abraham Khoury, editor of the newspaper Fatal Boston (The Damsel of Boston). He had a very vague idea of Arab ideals and is pursuing exclusively a pro-Syrian policy. I asked him what his opinion was about the future of the Arab race. He said he could only speak of Syria and Lebanon, which ought to be granted their inde pendence. I asked him if the Syrians would be able to rule themselveswithout the supervision of some European Power. He said that of course they would require the advice and financial help of the Powers, who, however, should not interfere in the internal affairs of the country. In a conversation of some importance I had with the Rev. A. M. Rihbany, a Syrian Protestant clergyman in Brookline, near Boston, a man of great culture and influential amongst the Syrians, I asked him if the informa tion that 80,000 people had died of starvation in Lebanon was correct. He said that the report was not confirmed, and he thought it was exaggerated. The United States Government, he said, undertook to make inquiries, and he was waiting for the result of the inquiry before joining in any action. Then I worked the conversation round to the future of the Arab race. The Rev. Rihbany and Dr. Tabet are the only two people I met that have a broad view of a national Arab cause. The former said that the Arabian Peninsula, excepting, perhaps, Yemen and Hejaz, should be annexed to Egypt, forming thus a vast Arab kingdom, with the Sultan of Egypt at its head, under the protectorate of Great Britain. This would prove in my opinion, he said, the most satisfactory and natural solution of the Arab problem and would ensure a beneficial and permanent settlement. Arabia incorporated to Egypt will reap the same benefits of civilisation and prosperity that the latter country has been enjoying under British tuition I asked the Rev. Rihbany how would this solution affect the Caliphate He said that was an exclusively religious matter and should be left entirely to Mohammedans to decide. In his opinion the Sherif of Mecca would be the most appropriate person to be nominated a Caliph—being an Arab, a man of great influence, and a descendant of the Prophet, which gives him a right to the Caliphate. He should be given some temporal power, which, however, should not extend beyond certain limits : say, Hejaz and Yemen, which are inhabited solely by Mohammedans. He should be afforded complete liberty in the exercise of his religious prerogatives and ample protection by the Powers against any interference or undue influence. At Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago I met and interviewed several Arabs, both Christians and Mohammedans, and I found them even less eager and concerned about the Arab cause than what Arabs are in New York and Boston. Some of them are not even trying to keep in touch with events in the Orient. Those who have emigrated to America years ago and prospered and settled down have become Americanised, and do not care much what happens to their country of origin. I found, however, that many are looking forward to seeing their country freed from the Turks. The poorer Arabs are struggling to earn their living and make the two ends meet. There is not in the Middle West any organisation between the Arabs, and only a few local societies of any importance. No Arabic newspapers are published in Cleveland, Detroit, or Chicago.24 M TURKS, ARMENIANS, HELLENES, AND GERMANS IN AMERICA. Turkish Propaganda in America. t | i i! r i I The Turks are not carrying on in the United States a regular system of propaganda as they are in Switzerland. They are letting Germany deal with the main issues of their cause. I presume that the reason for Turkish inaction is principally that the Turkish Government cannot afford the expense of a well-organised propaganda. Besides, they know that the American public is very little interested in the fate of Turkey and their work would be of no avail. The Turkish authorities keep a few local agents and spies to report on the doings of Syrians, especially those that are known for their antagonism to Turkey. As they cannot, however, deal any punishment to them in America they wreak their revenge on their relatives in Turkey and confiscate their properties. There have been cases when a man having been praised by a Syrian newspaper had his relatives in Turkey subjected to oppression and reprisals. The local German Press and the Arabic newspaper A l Bay an are the only organs in America that support the Turkish Government. German Propaganda. German propaganda in America has failed disastrously. Even persons who were formerly prepense to Germany and inclined to sympathise with her against the Allies have been disillusioned. They had formed a high ideal of German “ kultur ” and civilisation, and were shocked by the brutal and aggressive behaviour of German agents. The plots and intrigues engineered by Germany’s official representatives and the outrages com mitted by German agents alienated from them the sympathies of true Americans, and dealt a very severe blow to German influence in the United States. On the other hand, Americans could not but admire the sober and dignified attitude of the British Government and the scrupulous correctness of England’s representatives. Germany has tried to plead her cause before the American public by slinging at England the most villainous insults and base accusations of treachery and aggressiveness. German methods of propaganda are too well known to be gone into. Millions of libellous pamphlets in English and German were distributed broadcast all over the United States. But the publication that was intended to make a hit and strike at the root of British influence is a book in English by Rudolf Cornau, bearing the title of The Black Book of England, by an American. A perusal of this book will give an idea of the extraordinary aberration of German mentality. Events in the history of England are twisted in such a manner, and argu ments are so childish and groundless, that only an ignorant or a fool could be deceived by them. In a conversation I had with a Mr. Stortz, a very prominent man in Chicago, ex-President of the American Tobacco Trust and himself of German descent, he said, “ For Germans to swamp thecountry with such trash they must be either fools or must think that Americans are fools.” German propaganda is still carried on in German papers published in America. Having failed in their intent to injure English prestige, they are heralding at present the Irish cause with tales of woe of English atrocities in Ireland, in order to stir the hatred of the American people against England, but apart from the German element and a small number of American sympathisers the general public remains unmoved. In order to have a clear statement of real German opinion regarding this war I visited a Mr. Dolge, who was born in Germany but had become a naturalised American citizen. He is a prominent business-man of good standing. Although a true German, he is not a rabid one. Mr. Dolge firmly believes that England prepared and brought on this war against Germany. She was attacked by the Allies, but Germans, he said, had no ill feelings against France or Russia, who had been hoodwinked and deceived by England. Even the United States Government, he said are subservient to England, who rules America through her Ambassador. President Wilson was only an instrument in the hands of England and an agent paid to do her bidding. He has a financial interest in the supply of arms and ammunition. He let England break all international laws, blockade Germany and starve her women and children, seize American and neutral mails, and menaced Germany when she was trying to protect herself by submarine warfare. He was certain, he said, that if Germany had had the means of exporting food-stuffs and ammunitions from America, President Wilson would at once put an embargo on them. I have related this interview just to show the cardinal points that German propaganda is based upon and by what means it endeavours to ensnare and deceive the people. Mr. Dolge was quite in earnest and seemed convinced of the truth of the statements he made to me. Famine in Mount Lebanon. The news received in New York from Egypt that Mount Lebanon was in the throes of famine and that 80,000 people had died there of starvation created a very painful sensation amongst the Syrians all over the United States. It was rumoured that the Young Turks, in order to punish the inhabitants of Mount Lebanon for their sympathy to the Allies, had decided to exterminate them by cutting off all food-supplies from Mount Lebanon and starving them to death. This report is probably exaggerated, but there is no doubt that great distress and suffering reign in the whole of Syria and Palestine as no supplies of food of any kind have entered Syria since Turkey joined in the war, and whatever the soil produced was re quisitioned by the Turco-Germans for themselves and the Army. As soon as the news of famine was received in New York the Syrians organised meetings to discuss the situation. Telegrams signed by the leading Syrians were sent to President Wilson, Senator Gorman, and other members of Congress, accusing the Turkish Government of cruelties and requesting that the American Government should interfere and save the Syrians from26 destruction. The fact that no direct appeals were made by the Syrians to the Turkish Ambassador is very significative and tends to show that they have severed their relations of citizenship with the Turkish Government. A commission, composed of Mr. Mokarzal, editor of A/Houda, Mr. Diab, editor of Miraat-el-Gharb, and Mr. Khalil Assouaduas, was delegated by the Syrians in New York to see Mr. Wilson in Washington and expose the situation to him. The President told them that he had not received any confirmation of the report, but he would ask the Secretary of State to attend to the matter. Relief committees were organised amongst the Syrians throughout the United States, and before I left New York I learnt that about £2,000 had been collected. A request was made to the United States Government to obtain from the Turkish Government that food-supplies be sent to Syria and Lebanon and that an American commission be allowed to superintend the distribution of the supplies to the stricken populations. I understood that the American Consul-General in Cairo was interesting himself in the matter. I do not know whether the United States Government had com municated with the Turkish Government on the subject. No definite arrangement had been arrived at at the time I left New York. A Maronite priest in New York received a letter from Monsignor Derian, Maronite Bishop of Egypt, describing the appalling distress and sufferings of the Lebanese and urging the collection of funds for the relief of the stricken population. Uprising in Hejaz. The news received via London on 22nd June that the Arabs, headed by the Sherif of Mecca, had risen against the Turks and taken possession of Mecca, Jeddah, and later of Medina, caused the greatest sensation amongst the Arabs in the United States. They realised the great religious and political importance of this move, and were awaiting eagerly an official con firmation and further developments. The Mohammedans apparently do not give credence to the report, but they cannot hide their anxiety. They avoid as much as they can any discussion on the subject and simply say that it is an English intrigue. The two pro-Turkish newspapers A l Bay an and Al Ikhaa did not even publish the report, while the other Syrian news papers gave it pre-eminence in their columns, but did not make any com ments as they were awaiting official confirmation. The Armenians in the United States. L nlike the Arabs, the Armenians in America are a very active body and wonderfully organised. Since the outbreak of war, and specially after the Armenian massacres, the two leading societies buried their differences, joined hands and combined their efforts in exposing the Turkish atrocities against their race. They have published documents in their own organs and in the American Press proving beyond doubt the culpability of the Turkish Government and also the moral responsibility of Germany in the Armenian massacres.I had a long interview in New York with Mr. Arshay Mahdesian, the editor of New Armenia. I asked him what he thought of the future of the Armenian nation. He said he did not believe that Armenians would be granted their complete independence, but they ought to be given a wide autonomy under Russia s control and protection. Armenians, he said, had great sympathy for a liberal Russia, but he did not think that the latter had yet gained their full confidence. When the Russians took Erzeroum they appointed as mayor of the city a Mohammedan of Abdul Hamids party and at that time a sworn enemy of the Armenians. This appoint ment created a very painful impression. Armenians, he said, were a peaceful and law-abiding nation, and only asked for a just and liberal treatment in order to attend to their industries and cultivate their lands. Mr. Mahdesian says that the American Government had not afforded any protection to the Armenians, and only very mildly protested against Turkish atrocities. Mr. Morgenthau, the ex-Ambassador, never raised a finger to protect the Armenians or stop the massacres. Mr. Morgenthau’s chief object in Turkey, he said, seemed to be to help the Zionist movement, and at the time that the Armenians were being massacred in their tens of thousands Morgenthau was dealing with the Young Turks for the cession of Palestine to the Jews. Under the circumstances, he said, Morgenthau, who was endeavouring to cap tivate the sympathies of the Young Turks for the Jewish cause, would not possibly displease them by protesting against Armenian massacres. “ But surely,” I said, “ if that was Morgenthau’s attitude, his Government would not approve of it?” Mr. Morgenthau smiled sadly and said, “You surely know what American politics are.” Mr. Morgenthau is a personal friend of President Wilson, to whose first election he has concurred in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars. Morgenthau’s reward was the Ambassadorship to Turkey. Wilson being under obligation could not certainly dispute his actions, also in view of the future presidential election. But Mr. Mahdesian thinks that Morgenthau carried his anti-Russian and pro-German policy so far that England protested to the United States Government, and that may be the reason why Morgenthau was advised to take a leave of absence. Mahdesian said that Morgenthau was such persona grata to the Turco-Germans that he was offered to take part in the government of Turkey as Minister of Finance, which he declined. N.B .—During my visit to the United States I have noticed that Mr. Morgenthau was taking a very active part in the Zionist movement and also did not hide his sympathies for Turkey. In an address delivered by him to the Chamber of Commerce of New York he spoke of the great vitality of Turkey and the brilliant future that was reserved to that country. The Hellenes in America. The attitude of the Greek element in the United States is, like every thing Greek, very puzzling. Although the great majority sympathise with the Allies, they blame them, however, for the supposed wrongs28 committed by them against the Greek nation. They deprecate the violation of Greek neutrality by landing troops at Salonica and other places and instituting the blockade against Greece. They say that all Greece wanted was to be allowed to keep a strict neutrality. In their opinion the Greek Government have played fair and did not deserve the vexatious treatment of the Allies. These opinions I have heard from several Greeks with whom I came into contact in New York and Chicago, and were also expressed to me by no less a person than the Rt. Hon. Solon Hylien J. Vlasto, ex-Arch-General of the Greek Orthodox Church and editor in New York of the leading Greek newspaper Atlantes. I asked the hon. Vlasto if he cared to make a statement regarding the attitude of the Greeks residing in the United States towards the policy followed by the Greek Government with regard to the present war. He said that the Greeks in the United States were convinced that their Government had followed a purely national policy, and had only in view the interest of the country. There is no doubt, he said, that the great majority of the Greeks in America and elsewhere sympathise with the Allies, and I am in the number. We realise that we owe our independence and prosperity to England and France, but during the present war, he said, the Allies have abused their power and not only violated the neutrality of Greece but also subjected her to vexations and the danger of famine. I asked him whether the Allies had not been forced to show some severity on account of Greece playing into the hands of Germany, supplying fuel to German submarines, breaking her pledge to send troops for the defence of Salonica and, last, by tacitly ceding Fort Rupel to the Bulgarians. The hon. Vlasto said that Greece was never subservient to Germany and it was not true that Greeks had supplied U boats. I admit, he said, that the Greek Government had promised to send troops to Salonica, but on condition that the Allies should concentrate there 150,000 troops. Instead of that they only send 13,000 men, and Greece was not going to send her troops to Salonica to be massacred by the Bulgarians. As to the occupation of Fort Rupel by the Bulgars, he said that the Greek troops being inferior in number had to withdraw, but the Greek Government protested against the Bulgarian occupation. The hon. Vlasto concluded by saying that Greece was follow ing the same policy of neutrality as Roumania, meaning, I suppose, that Roumania and Greece had concluded a secret agreement together. A Few Words about America and Americans. In a former paragraph I mentioned that German propaganda in America had failed almost completely, and this was principally due to German aggressiveness^ and brutal deeds. I also said that England’s correct but at the same time firm attitude had won for her the respect and esteem of the Amsterdam people. I will add here that while a large number of Americans have a genuine admiration and sincere sympathy for England, others, and perhaps the majority, lean towards England only because it serves their interests. We can safely consider the almighty dollar as the #standard of American sympathy. Thanks to England and her Allies the American nation has been having a spell of great prosperity. Millions of dollars are pouring into the country from the supply of war materials and ammunition. American exports have more than doubled. American manufacturers, being rid of the competition of German cheap goods, are making huge profits. Notwithstanding the above advantages, due mainly to England, as soon as the blockade against Germany was tightened and restrictions made against the export of certain articles to neutral countries, Americans became indignant and began to question the right of England to interfere with their trade. We know that they have protested officially against the seizure of neutral and enemy mails. They refuse to realise that the struggle of England and her Allies is one of life and death and that they are bound to protect themselves by all means at their disposal. This proves the selfishness and unstability of American sympathy, based exclusively on material gains and financial interests. The Mexican war scare and the campaign for presidential election are absorbing at present the whole attention of the American people; the European war being relegated to a place of secondary importance. I can safely state that the majority of the American people do not want war with Mexico. They realise that if war is declared, it is going to be a dreary and extenuating guerilla warfare which may last for years. They are having a spell of great prosperity, and why should they waste the energies of the country in a war against Mexico ? Wilson’s enemies blame the whole trouble on the President for his interference, first with Mexican internal affairs, and for pursuing afterwards a weak and cavillating policy. Wilson’s friends, on the other hand, hope that General Carranza will yield, and accept the President’s demands. Thus, war will be averted and Wilson will score another success by saving the country once more from being dragged into war: a very valuable asset towards Wilson’s re- election. The scenic amenities of a presidential campaign in America are too well known to be gone into. Hughes and Wilson stand an almost equal chance to-day. Both of them pledge themselves to follow an undiluted and all-in- all American policy. What that exactly means we have not been able to discover yet. Wilson’s stand in international policy is known and there is every reason to believe that if he is re-elected he will follow it up. Hughes has not pronounced himself yet regarding his intended international policy. When he spoke of the sinking of the Lusitania he called it a tragedy, and said that it might have been averted by a stronger policy. The statement is ambiguous. What did Hughes mean by a stronger policy, and against whom should it have been exercised ? Why should he call the sinking of the Lusitania a tragedy and not a crime and an outrage ? These are mysteries. The most puzzling feature of Hughes’ campaign is that he has the whole support of Colonel Roosvelt, known for his firm stand against Germany and her barbarous methods of war. On the other hand, the German-Americans have pledged themselves to cast their votes for Hughes. Future developments may unravel the intricacies of American politics.f APPENDIX B. VIEWS OF AN INDIAN RESIDENT IN LONDON. Since that sensational news of the “ Revolt of the Arabs ” I have been thinking of writing you, but didn’t feel well enough. You know I have always endeavoured to bring to the notice of the Authorities any policy or steps on their part which may be likely to cause misunderstanding and unrest in the mind of Muslims. My best efforts were also directed to a rapprochement between the Moslim domains and Great Britain. Before this unfortunate war between Turkey and Great Britain was declared, I approached, through an M.P. friend, responsible people in the Government advising them to issue a declaration, in case the war between Turkey and England did break out, that Great Britain would do nothing, even under provocation from the Turks, to create any change in the native guard at the Holy Places in Islam. I impressed my friend that it would he to the interest of the Turks to compel Great Britain to show some sort of design on the Holy Places, either of a Protectorate, or of a conquest, just to arouse the invincible fanaticism of the Muslim world. A few days before the outbreak of the war between Turkey and England I wrote to H.H. the Aga Khan also to the same effect, a personal correspondence of some length. I was very glad to see that the Authorities did adopt the same course as was suggested by me, with the result that although a Holy War was declared by Turkish Ministers, it did not arouse Muslim fanaticism, because the Holy Places and religious questions as to the Khalifat, &amp;c., were wisely left absolutely and assuredly alone by Great Britain and its Allies. Now a sensational news has been spread broadcast concerning those very Holy Places. The Times leading article announcing the news was well written, insomuch that it reproduced the declaration made by Great Britain and its Allies as to its inviolability of the Holy Places and their Port, Jeddah, and that it plainly said that the incident was domestic, and only temporal, concerning none but the Muslims themselves. But the next day a news from Constantinople was published to the effect that a British man-of-war had bombarded the Hedjaz Coast, and this news was never contradicted. With your experience of India you know that for some time—a good long time, in fact—Indian Muslims have felt suspicious of the policy of Great Britain towards the Holy Plages. They have been led to believe that it was the object of Great Britain to have Arabia and the Holy Places of Islam under its Protectorate, or under its influence. As you know, one of the commands in the Holy Quran itself forbids the ruling of all non-Muslims in Kaaba and it is essential that the Khalifa should be an independent Muslim ruler. Since this war broke out, Mussulmans have been watching with anxious interest the attitude of Great Britain towards these Holy Places, and because so far British Statesmen were very wise indeed to give no occasion whatsoever for Mussulmans to feel suspicious, everything has run smoothly in that respect. The Servants of Kaaba Society, which is solemnly pledged to see that the Holy Places do not get into the control or protectorate of any non-Muslim power, has expressed its thanks for the declaration made by Great Britain for itself and its Allies. The Mussulmans have expressed their gratitude for the wise step taken of announcing that Pilgrimage to Hedjaz shall not be hindered and stopped by Great Britain. When this policy of leaving the Holy Places alone has proved so successful, I do not think the British Statesmen will feel inclined to alter it. But then the news from Constantinople that British men-of-war had bombarded and approached Hedjaz Coast ought to have been at once contradicted. In to-day’s Times ( 26 th June) there is absurd news sent from Bombay by the correspondent of The Times that the Muslims of India are delighted at the revolt of the Arabs. If there are any Mussulmans who say that they are delighted, they are hypocrites and scoundrels. They are not the well- wishers of Great Britain. They are just like those so-called Moslim trustees of the Cawnpore Mosque who deceived the English Magistrates as to the real character of a portion of the Mosque which under the wrong impression thus created was demolished, and caused a widespread unrest from one side of India to the other, and ended in a dismal and horrible tragedy—you know all about that sad tragedy, and you know of such “ Mussulmans ”, and also how they are despised by the Muslim public. In fact their support of any step is considered sufficient reason by the general Muslim public to get suspicious of it, even if it is good on the face of it, and to oppose it if there is anything unsavoury about it. By the comments of English papers on the subject of this “ Revolt of the Arabs”, I gather that even the educated people here have failed to realise the true aspect of the incident, and I don’t blame them for it. It requires intimate knowledge of the sentiments and feelings, as well as of the religious metaphysical currents in the minds of Muslims, to understand such important problems concerning their religion. You are in a far better position to understand them as you have been for such a long time in touch with Muslims. Now Muslims having been commanded by the Holy Quran not to revolt against the established authority of their co-religionists, cannot look down but with contempt on any efforts on the part of the Arabs to revolt against the Turks. The Moslem masses, uneducated as they are, and favourably attached to Islam as they are, themselves they will never believe that the Arabs have arisen againt the Khalifa of their own accord. And if they have risen they deserve every punishment, as did those Moslems even in early Moslem Arabian Turkey who rose against their Khalifa. As you32 J\ i j-4 know, Ayesha, the beloved wife of the Prophet himself, rose against the then Khalifa—Ali—as she thought Osman s martyrdom was not revenged by Ali. Ayesha lost the battle in the battle of the Camel (as it was called) because ^Moslem opinion in general condemned the rising. There is not a single Mussulman to-day who blames the Khalifa Ali for his vigorous actions against the rebellion, led by Ayesha herself. In fact no rebellion is alluded to by Islam. So you see the general Moslem public will never have any sympathy with the revolt. As far as the educated Moslems are concerned, they know the Arabs, their character and their want of military organisation too well to take the rebellion to be serious, unless some non-Muslim power is inclined to abuse the fanaticism of the whole Moslem world by helping the Arabs and using them as its own tool for its own pur pose of creating a division among Moslems or breaking their temporal power. I do not think any sane non-Moslem Government would consider it even worth while to do so on the present occasion. The Mussulmans themselves would much sooner see the whole edifice of the Holy Kaaba to be razed to the ground than its being protected by any non-Moslem. As far as a non-Moslem prince with any sinister ambitions against the Holy Places is concerned, she (England) can see, if she is not blinded completely, that she can hurt neither the military nor the ecclesi astical power and influence of Turkey and the Khalifa by helping the Arab revolt in Mecca. In this war Turkey has not gained much from that portion of the Hedjaz being under her control. Obviously they have not got many recruits from either Mecca or Jeddah, because Great Britain and its Allies were wise enough to announce that they would not interfere with the Holy Places and Jeddah and with any religious affairs of Moslems, and the Turks could not gain any advantage from their Sovereign being the Khalifa of the Moslem world. Now, if the revolt of the Arabs is really serious, the Turks will gain a great moral advantage, and also perhaps a military advantage. Beside the fact that the whole Moslem world will get into a condition of great excitement, and will, as a matter of course, begin to feel suspicious of non- Moslem designs against the temporal and spiritual domains of Islam, the Moslems within the Ottoman Empire will then take this war to be a really religious Holy War, threatening the control of the Holy Places. It is absurd to think that once the question of the Holy Places of Islam is involved the war will continue to remain only temporal. Mecca and Jeddah are isolated places, and even if they were allowed by Turkish military experts to drift from their hands for the time being that would not hurt the military situation. The Turks would, on the contrary, get great support because every Turk would be forced to believe that not only his temporal domains, but also the spiritual domains of his Sovereign, depended upon how he fought in this war. Even the Arabs themselves who do not belong to the clan of Mecca Arabs would feel it their religious duty to keep the Holy Places in a position which would keep them free from non-Moslem interference. In short, every statesman who can fully appreciate the psychology of the r fsituation will see that the revolt instead of weakening the power of the Turks will solidify it both materially and morally. I have written to you in such detail in the hope that you will do a great service to Great Britain by putting before its statesmen the correct view of the situation and also save Moslems from a great internal commo tion and agitation which may end in a great catastrophe. Moslims are really very touchy in religious matters. You know that my own love for my faith is almost fanatical. So far Mussulmans have shown remarkable self-control under very critical circumstances. So far British Statesmen have acted judiciously. I would beg you for the sake of Great Britain itself to do all you can not to let the British Statesmen be now led astray even if it be by certain so-called Moslems themselves. These are anxious days as they are, and matters must not be made worse by immature politicians’ clumsy intrigues and sycophantic selfish title-hunters. I have no doubt that H.H. the Aga Khan and Mr. Amir Ali both will agree with what I have said. The only wise course for Great Britain and its Allies will be to persist in its wisely declared policy of leaving the Holy Places of Islam and religious questions alone—strictly and vigorously, in spite of temptations and even provocations. To take any part in the troubles in Hedjaz, nay even to show sympathy with the rebellious people in Mecca or Jeddah, will be playing into the hands of Germans. If you can, warn British Statesmen against itSECRET. i ut away with 1 1 nL 1 ^ o */ ' j t o % To be Read APPRECIATION OF ARAB REPORT XXI a. ^ Ge ^ S re ^ )0^ ^ , tias been compiled in great baste, gives some idea of the want of cohesion which has marked our attitude to the Arabian problem, and the necessity of a defined and organised political policy. The Sherif, as far_ as he is concerned, appears to be holding his own, and, indeed, to be making some progress. We are supplying him with guns, rifles, munitions, and money, and are assisting him in the administration of Jeddah , both schemes emanated from Egypt. Elsewhere matters seem to have been Jeft to take their chance, and there has been little co-operation. In England the pi ess continues to produce pro--Turkish paragraphs, such as the references to General Townshend’s school friendship with Halil Pasha, and a picture of General Townshend being motored about Constantinople. Little reference of a friendly kind has been made about the Arabs. From Muscat, Aden, Bahrein, and Hofuf we have no reports, which, a month after the Sherif’s rising, points to little interest being taken in the matter by the directing authorities. In Algiers, Tunis, and Morocco the French have been pushing and advertising the Sherif’s action through native channels, while General Baratoff, in Persia, has done his best to spread the news and make capital out of it. In our own sphere we remain apparently apathetic. The contrast between ourselves and our Allies is particularly striking in the case of General Baratoff, who makes suggestions of action which he presumes we have taken. From India we have (in the Viceroy’s telegram No. 330) a report of the natural reflex of the Arab rising on the organisations known respectively as the All Indian Moslem League and the Khudan-i-Ka’aba Society, whiclf were both in close touch with the Committee of Union and Progress before the war, and are still in complete sympathy with its aims. The satisfactory report from Singapore is of interest as showing the effect of the rising on a Moslem community in a settlement where, apparently, little official deference is paid to pro-Turkism. The delay in sending the Arab prisoners to Egypt from India (reported in telegram No. 347 s) is worthy of special attention as an example of the vicissitudes to which official correspondence exposes matters of urgency. Briefly the circumlocution was as follows : Egypt asked India for the prisoners, India asked London whether the prisoners might be sent, London replied to India in the affirmative, India set the machinery in motion, and the prisoners will, with good luck, reach Egypt thirty days late, and then have to be examined as there had been no time to investigate their antecedents or views in India during the past twelve months. Allowing ten days to investigate in Egypt, and another five to send the men to Jeddah, it may be estimated that fifty-three days have been [791—1]occupied in doing something that with businesslike arrangements could have been done in twenty at the outside. Excellent reasons can be found for each halt in this complicated and correct pilgrimage, but the fact remains that men who might have been of immense value have been eating rations and doing nothing, while the official wheels revolved in their appointed grooves. Captain Bray’s notes, observations, and proposals are worthy of consideration as indicating the existence among Indian Moslems of certain ideas and sentiments which might be worth fostering as a counterpoise to the views of the members of the All India Moslem League and the Khudan-i-Ka aba Similar suggestions have been received from Major-General lowell and Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander, two Indian officers of considerable experience. If anything is to be done in this matter it requires early attention and action. The “Tanin” article needs careful attention. It is bitter and contemptuous, and designed to foster hatred and scorn of England in the minds of its readers; it should be observed that this article is a part of the Committee of Union and Progress propaganda in Turkey. In Europe and on the battle fronts the propaganda of the Committee of Union and Progress takes t e form of showing the Turk as a “good fellow ” and fighting “ more m sorrow than in anger ” against Great Britain. This is a form of policy much to be admired ; for to mollify your enemy and inflame your supporters is equally advantageous in the event of either victory or defeat. The German officer’s observations made to our secret agent are illuminating, as showing the importance which Germans attach to Turkey, and their keen appreciation of the political, strategic, colonial, and economic potentialities of the Ottoman provinces. The news from Syria still continues vague, but there seems to be grounds for hope that the movement will spread. For the movement to be a success it will require all* the brains, energy, and enthusiasm we can put into it. The three essentials on our part are uniformity of plan, policy, and control. (Signed) MARK SYKES. July 4, 1916. p g,—ppe I.G. 822 arrived after the report was prepared for the press. The scheme sketched by the Sherif is of interest, and makes the loss of time in getting the Arab prisoners from India more regrettable. Not too much importance need be attributed to the hostility of the Arabs at Rabej ; probably they were wild, suspicious, and excited, and did not know whether there was not some plan to conquer the country. The incident is an excellent example of the difficulties with which we shall have to contend in dealing with what a well-known writer described as a “ fox- hearted elfin people.” M. S.[This Document is the Propert y, of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] SECRET. Reprinted for reference only. l ARABIAN (No. XXI a. ASIA.) Week ending July 4, 1916. THE SHERIF OF MECCA. Military Action. There is now some information as to the exact military situation in Hejaz. It appears that the fort of Taif is still holding out, though Abdulla has captured a gun, 200 men, and has breached one side of the enemy’s defences. The two forts at Mecca are still holding out, but it is anticipated that they will succumb to thirst shortly ; one of them has a stone barrack and a garrison of 800, while the other, a redoubt, has a small garrison and three or four guns. Humours continue to come in as to the Turkish preparations for dealing with the revolt. Faruki, from Jeddah, has estimated that there are in Syria 10,000 Germans, 15,000 Turks, and 12,000 Syrians. The Sherif estimates the Syrian army at 35,000, mostly Syrians. The Syrians are known to be disaffected, but the Turks have taken precautionary measures, and the Syrian soldiery are officered mainly by Turks ; they cannot rebel, but cannot be relied upon as first-class troops. There is a report that 300 machine guns have been sent into Syria from Constantinople. It is also said that the Turks are repairing the Hejaz Hailway. The latest information comes from a letter intercepted between Jemal Pasha and Fakhri Pasha from Medina, in which Jemal Pasha said that regular troops were assembling for the purpose of dealing with the Sherif; that the first contingent was about to leave Damascus, and that a squadron of Turkish aeroplanes was leaving Constantinople. The reported revolt in Syria, which might help to account for such concentration,, is dealt with elsewhere. All Haidar, the Turkish nominee for the Caliphate, who was reported near Medina at the outbreak of the Hejaz revolt, is now said to be in Constantinople. British Assistance to the Sherif. As foreshadowed in the last report, the Sheriffs demands have grown, and he now requires 125,0001. per month to carry on the campaign. The Sheikh’s son Zaid took the arms and ammunition with him to Mecca on the 30th June, consisting of the mountain batteries, 3,000 rifles, and explosives. The batteries were manned by Moslem crews. It is not yet possible to send any aeroplanes, since the Sherif has not yet given assent to Christian pilots ; no Moslems are available. The Sheikh of Mohsin was due at Jeddah on the 2nd July in place of Zaid. He is well spoken of. Faruki is going to Cairo at an early date on a special mission from the Sherif of Mecca to the High Commissioner. The General Officer Commanding in Egypt, after a long conference with the High Commissioner, has sent a telegram to the Chief of the Imperial Staff stating that in his opinion every effort should be made to assist the Sherif in his revolt, in view of the important bearing that it has upon the future not only of Egypt but of the whole East. With regard to the cutting of the railway, the Sherif objects to cutting the railway presumably north of Ola’au, apparently on the ground that there is a revolt in Syria. Although the Turks are reported to be rebuilding the railway, the Sherif reports (on reliable authority) that he captured two trains. The Sherif s Policy. The Sherif has been uneasy about the possible fate of his relations in Constantinople,, and has consequently asked that a message should be transmitted from the American Embassy in Egypt to Enver Pasha to the effect that he is keeping the civil and military [791] B2 prisoners who have fallen into his hands, and m order to guarantee the good tieatment of his brother Sherif Nasir Ibn Adi and the rest of his house who are now in Egypt. He says that if any harm befall them, like punishment will fall upon the prisoners in his hands. . . . The Sherif has been impressed with the importance of being judicious m his handling f of the Holy Pilgrimage. He has produced a manifesto to the world, but a copy has not yet been received here. P.S.—At the moment of going to press the following telegram was received :— “ Sherif s first desire politically is Allied recognition; his object militarily is to collect as many Arab officers and men as possible from the camp of our prisoners of war; he hoped with this stiffening of trained troops to get together a regular army Hejaz Arabs of about 80,000 men. As soon as situation allows the'intention is to invade Syria; meanwhile Sherif relies on British Government to keep the irregular Arab bands now operating against the lurks fully supplied. According to Faruki, his suzerainty accepted by both Imam and Idrisi. He wants ilahmal to be at Jeddah usual time.” Following from Cornwallis, at Jeddah :— “ Public security being well maintained, there having been only one case of looting ; but merchants with whom I have talked had hoped for some form of British control. Great need of organisation in Jeddah town; doctor badly required ; sanitary arrangements hopeless. “ It was impossible to land battery at’Rabej owing to Arab hostile attitude : Wilson ordered return to Jeddah, where they arrive to-night. Trouble was chiefly due to Sherif neglecting to warn Arabs of their approach and Arab dislike of Egyptians. This morning we spoke to Sherif on telephone, arranging for battery supplies, &amp;c., to be landed at Jeddah.” (Ends.) About 5th July Cornwallis returns to Suez with Faruki and Jamil. SYPIA. So far as can be ascertained there are indications of widespread unrest in Syria, due probably to racial excitement, shortage of food, and growing fear of Turkish and German oppression. The only facts that can be ascertained are that there has been fighting in the Hauran and that there is a famine in Lebanon, but persistent reports from Mecca, Berue, and Alexandria, based it is true on rumours point to a something approaching, either organised rebellion or a breakdown of administration. The latest news of enemy dispositions in Syria is contained in the following telegram “ From General Officer Commanding Force £ D ’ to the Director of Military Intelligence. “ (Repeated to India and Egypt.) “ LG. 3117. “ June 28, 191(5, &lt;£ An agent reports that large numbers of troops are camped at Damascus, but only including four battalions and one cavalry regiment of properly trained troops. The remainder were all raw recruits, drafts of whom are constantly arriving from Beirut, Homs, Hama, &amp;c., and are sent off to the Egyptian front after a little training. At Aleppo there were some Mosul troops, but only three trained battalions. Fakhri Pasha is commanding there. Some drafts from Aleppo are sent to Damascus, but the majority to Rasulain where large concentration is said to be taking place. Agent heard that an Army Corps accompanied Enver as far as Rasulain when he was on his way to Baghdad, and this may refer to the 9th Division, and the one following it. The agent is considered to be fairly reliable. He states that at Hail and all along the route thence to Damascus he heard that Damascus was bristling with troops, guns, and aeroplanes, but on arrival there he found no guns and no aeroplanes nor any troops in excess of those quoted above.” A8IB. The following letter was sent to the Idrisi by Aden on the 8th June “ To Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Ali-bin-Muhammad-bin-Akmed-bin-Idris. C-541. “After greetings, “Aden Residency, 8th June, 1916. “ 1 acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your Excellency’s letter, in which you say that the bheriff is not able to move against the common enemy because the latter has too many troops, and the Imam cannot move on account of his agreement and the profit derived therefrom. “You say that these two were formerly your friends, but have since only been friendly to your enemy the Turks. In the first case I must tell you that I have received information, considered reliable, that your Excellency ia mistaken in thinking that the Sheriff will not rise.lhat he is now rising, and it is of great importance that you, oh! iny friend, should make a simultaneous attack. You will see that this to your own advantage for the following reasons : — “(a.) I he enemy, being^ attacked simultaneously in various places, cannot move troops from nne to the other, and his position is made more difficult. ' • ^ t ^ !e P re ®® nt moment the attention and the troops of the Turks are entirely engaged m the Caucasus and Mesopotamia, and they are unable to send reinforcements to their local forces, who can therefore most easily be dealt with. In short, if you cannot now throw off the Turkish yoke, it is time, oh . mj friend, to lay down your arms and cease from all pretence of finhtina;, because such an opportunity may never again occur. ? ( c ‘) ^.7 rising at this time, you will gain the goodwill of the British Government, who will certainly not forget your conduct at the present time of trial. ‘You, oh my friend, are a friendly sea-power, and our mutual interests are concerned in this matter. In the second case, if the Imam cannot move on account of his agreement, it is well known that his tribesmen aie not equally bound. If we make it profitable for them to join in this rising,^ they will hereafter be attached to your cause, and will thus strengthen your position when the lurks are finally disposed of. If you will kindly communicate your financial requirements in this respect, I have no doubt that the matter can be arranged, “ In the third case, you will realise that friendship arises from common aims and common interests; and if the aims and interests of the Sheriff are now in harmony with yours, that the memory of bye-gone feuds may profitably be abandoned. “ On all sides I hear reports that your Minister, Ba Sahi, is acting for his personal and pecuniary interests, rather than for the advantage of your Excellency and your State. I do not know whether this report is true or not. But I feel sure that, if he is such as he is reported to be, he will give the same advice as he would give were he, as I hope he is, a true servant of the State, viz., he will advise at this time that a combined attack against the Turks is to your profit, since he must be well aware that his pecuniary interests would suffer equally with that of the State but for the indulgence granted to Djezan—traffic and commerce. “ Moreover, it will be a satisfaction to all Arabs when the present necessity for sea blockade is removed. The Sheriff has asked for the co-operation of your forces, and I hear that you have sent him no reply. Now is the time to move. Now is the time to secure the expulsion of a harsh and tyrannical intruder who masquerades under the title of Moslem, and appeals to religious prejudices in order to obtain his worldly desires. “ I have reports that your Excellency’s troops are blocking the road from Hejaz to the Temen, and congratulate you on this success and on your past action in opposing the Turks single- handed. “ I feel confident that, by means of timely action and strong measures against those who are opposed to your interests, your Excellency will seize the present opportunity to consolidate your State and extend your dominions. “ I am sending this letter by the hand of Captain Turton, R.N., and request you will receive him with due honour, and confide to him fully your views on the present situation. Should you decide to attack Loheiya, he will arrange to assist you in the attack by fire from the ships. “(Signed) W. C. Walton, Brigadier-General, “ Political Resident, Aden.' (Secret.) No. C-542. Aden Residency, June 8, 1916. “ Copy forwarded, with compliments, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. “ (Signed) W. C. Walton, Brigadier-General, u Political Resident, Aden.” At the end of June the Idrisi announced his intention of beginning an attack upon a fixed date. He gave a written assurance to Commander Turton that on or about the 10th July he would attack Comfida and Mabail. He asserted that the general mobilisa tion of his forces was completed on the 29th June. He has written a friendly letter to the Sherif, to be forwarded through Aden. He has also seduced the Hashid and Bakil tribes from their allegiance from the Imam of Yemen; but they will only be called upon if required and subsidised by us. The Idriei’s present military position is summarised in the telegram printed below:— [From Chief of the Imperial General Staff to Commander-in-Chief, India.] [July 3, 1916, 7.25 P.M.] a [The ‘Idrisi’ has a miscellaneous collection of about 35 Turkish and Italian guns. Aden, through the India Office, is pressing for a supply of ammunition, which it is impossible to obtain. Advise replacing ‘ Idrisi’s’ guns by 15 pounders, and also by 5-inch howitzers, if he could usefully employ them. Egypt is authorised to place at your disposal for the ‘ Idrisi ’ any of the above guns and ammunition which are available. A few instructors are necessary; perhaps Egypt could help, or Turkish-trained Arab gunners might be utilised.] ”4 ADEN. It appears that the Imam of Yemen has a force of about 4,000 men and 4 guns, and that it recently marched to Shahra, west of Asir. There is evidence that the Turks in the Lahej district have heard of the revolt in Hejaz, and Said Pasha is said to btf collecting camels. It is believed that the Turks may at any moment effect a retirement from their positions at Lahej. MUSCAT. [Nil.] MESOPOT AM IA. There is very little activity reported from Mesopotamia. It appears that the disaffection among the hostile tribes in the Shattrat al Montafik region continues. The Tigris force continues to be troubled by Arab snipers. Ibn Bashid, who was last reported to have fled from the neighbourhood of Zobier, recently attacked Ibn Towalla, another Shammar Sheikh, friendly to the British, in the neighbourhood of Khamsieh. When this was reported, a British detachment of cavalry moved out from Khamsieh to assist Ibn Towalla. Ibn Bashid was defeated and fled south. During the engagement he appears to have lost a large part of his following, which originally numbered about GOO. TBANSLATION FBOM THE “ TANIN ” (THE OBGAN OF THE TUBKISH COMMITTEE OF UNION AND PBOGBESS). Surrender of Townshend’s Force of 13,000 Men at Kut-ul-Aw,ara. This time they did not succeed in scuttling. This time the English who, when they cannot achieve success, consider it the greatest honour to run away, have been unable to do as they did at Gallipoli. The English forces at Kut-ul-Amara, with their five generals and 500 officers, have ended by surrendering and now, while those who were shut up in Kut-ul-Amara have surrendered, what is left of the English forces in Lower Mesopotamia are seeking some means of scuttling. In tlm degree in which the fall of Kut-ul-Amara was a success for us (Turks), it is a smashing blow to the enemy. For we are quite convinced that it is not only that loss of Kut-ul-Amara, but the beginning of the loss of all the forces, munitions, Ac., they have during the last year and a half accumulated in Lower Mesopotamia, as also of their good name and prestige m the East. The history of mankind, in recording the wars between nations, awards the palm of victory to the winners, but does not withhold a mead of appreciation from those who have fought honourably and displayed martial qualities. If we look at matters from this standpoint, the English (who are unable to gain a victory by force of arms, far from deserving a mead of praise are justly deserving of ridicule, owing to the laughable attitude they assumed in presence of the menace of defeat. The defenders of Kut-ul- Amara, despairing of being relieved and seeing that surrender was inevitable, sought to save themselves by the offer of a ransom. They proposed that they should be let to go free on condition of paying one million sterling to our Commandant in Mesopotamia and handing over to him all their guns and ammunition. The English, on a previous occasion, secretly offered bakshish to Bahmi Bey, the Governor-General of Smyrna. They demanded the surrender of Smyrna as a bit of English bluff. The English, who then learnt what the Turk was, ought to have realised that they could not on this occasion save themselves by bribery, lhat they could not learn such an obvious truth would seem to show that the English, who were thought to be a serious people, are really stupid when confronted with a military situation. As is well known, the English at the outset of the war effected a landing in the Basra region. Since then, i.e&gt;, during the last year and a half, profiting by our military preoccupations elsewhere, e.g., at the Dardanelles, and by the resulting fact that we had insufficient forces in Lowei Mesopotamia, they penetrated into that district and slowly advanced to near Bagdad. ^ In fact, imagining that their entry into Bagdad was a matter of a few days, their papers and official organs could not restrain themselves from announcing5 the coming victory. Then, when on the eve of this imaginary victory, they heard that the Turkish forces, which had been retiring slowly and in compact Then, when on the eve of this imaginary victory, they order, had suddenly swung round and had begun to advance, the English com mand, realising that they could not hold their ground against the gallant ^ attacks of the Turks, gave the order to retreat. This was the first stage of their discomfiture in Lower Mesopotamia. By toning down, from a feeling of delicacy, the expression used by the British press concerning us, Turks, during the Balkan War, we may say that these defeated troops “ hung their heads and returned in a dazed condition to the spot whence they had come ” (the original English expression is doubtful), and, though the} T struggled hard to recover themselves, Turkish traditional prowess displayed itself in Lower Mesopotamia as elsewhere and whenever the enemy tried to raise his head, he wms made to reel under the descending blows. And now, these “ proud ” English who consider it an honour to scuttle, did not succeed in getting away and have surrendered their arms to us. And it is an honour for these arms strength to save themselves. They began the campaign with unfortunate natives raised in India, but later consented to add some pure English blood. For some time back we have been fighting in Lower Mesopotamia not the unfortunate slaves whom England drives to the slaughter, but with the real English themselves. In fact the people who have been defeated by us on the banks of the Tigris are not the Italians, the Russians, the Belgians, or French, but haughty Albion with all her pomp, majesty, and pride. The same paper of the 30th April gives in heavy type an official announcement of the proposal of General Townshend that he should be allowed to march away with his troops on condition of paying 1,000,000L and handing over all his guns. The proposal is characterised as “ contemptible.” 5 “ r t J have spoken to many Mohammedans in India on the subject of the declaration W 1 of war against Turkey, asking them their real opinions, and I have reason to believe t that my visit to Syria during 1913-14 and my superficial knowledge of the Koran rf induced them to speak more freely to me than they otherwise would have done. W must first of all be remembered that the masses in India are uneducated, and Ti f' therefore at the mercy of the intellectualist agitators. Being often well-informed men, r h°f they have been able to take advantage of the ignorance of the masses and have tried to rs ie instil pro-Turkish sentiments, which unscrupulous priests have often supported by irn)S&gt; nnrvtaLrYns from the Koran. The masses, not knowing Arabic, are easily t’tet tif which have been dripping with blood of hundreds of thousands of innocents, to be es. b surrendered to gallant troops like ours. The fall of Kut-el-Amara is not simply the fall of a fortified position or the fZolfi inevitable sequel of a vagabond raid. General Townshend is at the same time a symbol of the staggering blow dealt to British prestige and influence in the East. The enemy have for some time back quite realised this, and, seeing that their campaign in Lower Mes &gt;potamia was about to end in a tragic disaster, they put forth all their MOHAMMEDAN FEELING IN INDIA. Extracts from a Letter by Captain Bray, l&amp;th K.G.O. Lancers, I.A. irces® to ^ to destroy their religion, we were would, I am convinced, settle all that the feudal system exists in doubts once and for all. We must remember, too, India, and what the head of the clan thinks the clan 0&lt;M [791] 06 itself will think. The agitator and pro-Turk has maintained all through that Turkey has been fighting to protect the Mohammedan religion from harm, and the Holy Places from the infidel. The opportunity has now come to prove the opposite. Before they were fighting for the Sircar ; if we use the present opportunity to the full we shall be able to make them realise they are fighting for their own interests. My proposal. C therefore, is as follows : As soon as possible to send a deputation of Indian Moslem native officers now serving in France to the Sheriff of Mecca, bearing an autograph letter, congratulating him on his success, assuring him of our fullest^ support, or the support of the Mohammedans of India. It would be the object of this deputation to get him to ask for the services of Mahommedan troops (or, at least, officers) and obtain from him an appeal to Mahommedans m Inciia, Persia, and Afghanistan, to come to his assistance in driving out the Turk, who has violated his trust bv introducing foreigners to the Holy Places, and by threatening the whole of Islam with calamity. We could then concentrate detachments of specially selected men from France at Port Sudan, including machine-gun crews, and armed with this direct appeal from the Sherif declare ourselves willing to support him, and say we will allow volunteers to come forward in India, and transport them to Jeddah. I therefore suggest that Eisaldar Major Gul Nawaz Khan, 18th K. G. 0. Lancers, Meerut Cavalry Brigade, be immediately sent for as leader of the deputation. Exceedingly loyal, of very good family, and of great influence, I think he would be the very man to entrust with this Mission. He is the Senior Risaldar Major in France, and is completely au fait with everything that goes on among the Indian cavalry. He can be absolutely trusted^ to give his real opinion. If he were made the head of such a deputation and could bring us back a letter from the Sherif on the basis suggested, we should have a far-reaching weapon in our hands, and it would knock the bottom out of the whole pro-Turk propaganda, which rests on very insecure foundations. Meantime, to give confidence and backbone to the Arab revolt, s'elected men from France could be sent over to assist the Sherif. I suggest that a hundred to a hundred and fifty picked men, including machine gun detachments, could be profitably spared from France for this purpose. We could then proclaim it as a fact accomplished, and as a sign of our benevolence to Islam. GERMANY AND. TURKEY. The following information was communicated in strict confidence to a British agent by a German staff officer recently :— The German Government entertain very bitter feelings towards the Turks, and are quite prepared to take a part of Turkey if she be dismembered at the end of the war. The German Government have always used Turkey as a means to an end : in the Dardanelles Germany’s prestige in the Balkans was menaced, and she helped Turkey in order to keep Greece quiet and to secure Bulgarian co-operation. The position is now changed ; but German capitalists still have large sums bound up in Asia Minor (the Deutsche Bank, for instance, having 300,000,000 marks tied up in the Baghdad Railway), and the German Government are determined to save all they can. Therefore, though wretched communications in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia, coupled with the impossibility of sparing first-class troops from Europe, make a decent campaign in Asia Minor impracticable, Germany means to supply the Turks with all the material which they need for the prosecution of the war. For she sees that she will lose her money if Turkey makes a separate peace; but that if she can bolster up the Turks and keep them going she will at the end of the war have room for colonisation in Asia Minor in exact proportion to their exhaustion. In furtherance of this policy the Germans regard the Armenian massacres and the Arabian murders with equanimity, since in the depopulation of the districts concerned they see future chances for their emigrants. Asia Minor, they hope, will be a new outlet for the surplus population which would normally have gone to their lost overseas dominions. INDIA. The Indian Government, K The policy of the Indian Gouernment with regard to the Arab revolt is epitomisep in the following telegrams :—[P 2078] ' ^ rom SecrGtai T State to Yiceror, Foreign Department, 27th June, 1916. “Foreign Secret. Arabia. From correspondence forwarded with my Political Secretary’s letter, dated 1st June, your Government will have learned exact nature of agreements entered into with France and Russia regarding future Arab State, You are also aware of communications Itbat have passed with Grand Shereef. The three Allied Governments are now committed to Arab independence and a pro-Arab policy. The far-reaching consequences of this policy, if it succeeds, in regard to 1 urkish claims to Empire and to the spiritual allegiance of Sunnis are obvious. 1 suggest you should impress on your officers, both those in Mesopotamia and those responsible for handling Moslem opinion in India, the importance of correctly understanding and promoting this policy, and should explain and commend it as may seem suitable in such Indian quarters as you may wish to influence.” “From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 29th June, 1916. (Repeated to Cairo as No. 330.) “ Secret. Arab revolt. It is too early to gauge full effect of anuouucement, but there is on doubt that profound sensation has been caused among Mohammedans. Arab revolt under Sherif had not been foreseen and came as bombshell. Many doubt correctness of communique, while others suspect British participation in revolt. Opinions are still fluctuating, but following is brief appreciation of situation In internal India the most prominent pandslamic institutions, Khudan- i-Kaaba, and largely composed of Committee of All India Moslem League, have announced through their officials wholesale condemnation of Sherif and his sympathisers. This was not altogether unexpected, as since war there has been strong pro-Turkish element in both bodies, but it will possibly give (? unfortunate) lead to considerable body of Mohammedan opinion. If facts transpire which may seem to justify charge of breach of faith against British Government, and if Sherif cannot maintain his position, there may ensue period of excitement and demonstra tions during which bitterness, hitherto partially concealed, may find opeu vent. Even loyal and reasonable Mohammedans hesitate to applaud Sherif, but say that it is too early to judge. “As regards North-West Frontier, Roos-Kepper reports that effect has been bad in the extreme, and the Sherif’s action is universally condemned. He has been publicly cursed at services in mosques, and our connivance and assistance are assumed by all. xAs regards Afghanistan we have no definite information yet, but we view situation with anxiety. This new development may render Amir’s position more difficult, and will be used by War Party to make capital out of danger to Holy Places. It is possible that Amir himself may personally resent Sherif’s action, and 1 feel it right to bring this to your notice. “ This development is all the more deplorable in that both in internal India and on our frontier we had secured a condition of extraordinary quiet, and the prospects of peace were very favourable. “ We have had no news of events in Hejaz for over a week, and would be glad to be informed of progress of events. Wb shall also be glad of a clearer idea of future policy in that direction. The bombardment of Turkish positions at Jeddah was an unpleasant surprise to us, and we should be glad to know what, if any, further military or naval action is contemplated. Oui ignorance of this makes it difficult for us to deal with questions that must undoubtedly arise. “We have been considering desirability of issuing communique to allay Mohammedon excitement, and to define as far as possible the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in this matter, but matter is fraught with obvious difficulty, and we are very doubtful of committing ourselves. At the same time, it will be difficult for us, in view of our undoubted instigation of Sherif, which is already subject of bazaar rumour, to maintain prolonged silence. But for present we shall do nothing beyond encouraging Haj. _We do, of _ course, loyally accept His Majesty s Government’s policy, and shall endeavour to carry it Amt in spirit as well as m fetter. To this the following answer was sent:— “ From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 30th June, 1916. “Foreign Secret. Your telegram dated 29th June. Arab revolt. Surprise with which Sherif’s rising appears to have been received m India suggests that ground has not been prepared forTresult highly probable fromithe known policy of His Majesty’s Government, and from the information supplied to you from time to time as received here.

The Arab Prisoners in India. On the 2nd July the Arab artillery personnel left India for Egypt. The party consisted of 4 captains, 1 lieutenant, 6 second lieutenants, 1 sergeant-major, 23 sergeants, 26 corporals, and 71 privates —making a total of 132. BRITISH PROPAGANDA. The “ Daily Express” of the 1st July published an article in connection with General Townshend in which it called attention to the fact that Halil Pasha, wlm has been frequently seen with him in Constantinople, was an old school-fellow of his at Eton. The general tone of the article was sympathetic with the Turks. On the same day the “ Daily Mail” published a photograph of General Townshend goino’ through Constantinople with various Turkish officials in a motor car. This tendency to sympathise with the Turks, illustrated by the above, is pievalent, and is doubtless welcomed by the Committee of Union and Progress, whose external propaganda it furthers, for to the outside world they desire to appear as a nation more sinned against than sinning, their real attitude is illustrated by the article translated from the “ Tanin.” In view of this Egypt has taken steps to prevent the circulation of such articles and photographs as are instanced above. India has found it impossible to do so. RECEPTION OF THE NEWS OF THE REVOLT. News of the Hejaz revolt, discreetly published by the French, has been received well in Algeria, Tunis, and Morocco. The Russians have also made good use of it. Chief of Staff, Caucasus, sends the following :— “ The news of recent Arab rising against the Turkish Government has been widely circulated by General Baratoff throughout Persian occupied territory, but he thinks that the British commander in Mesopotamia is in a better position than he to disseminate the news in Baghdad Province by aircraft or otherwise. Please inform me whether such measures have been taken. An account of its effect upon British Moslems has been received from Singapore, where feelings have been varied. The intelligent Moslems have received the new T s with incredulity ; the Conservative classes have received it with some suspicion ; and the Malayans, who form the majority, are in sympathy with it. It was not entirely unexpected, for it seems to have been generally believed that the Arabs would sooner or later try to throw off the Turkish yoke. It is even thought that the Malayans would give moral and material support to the British Government, if Great Britain were openly to assist the revolt; but they do not expect Great Britain to do so for fear of the accusation that the revolt was engineered by British influence. All Moslems are -awaiting a Fetwah from the Sherif, and, now that rumours of British co-operation with the Sherif are in circulation, it is assumed that it has already been published and will reach the Straits in the immediate future. The effect of the revolt in Muscat, Aden, Bahrein, and Hofuf are still obscure. ITUNTBD AT TUB FOREIGN OFVICK BT C. R. HARRISON. 5/7/1916.&gt;' ia reluctant to leava Uonatantinoplo.

'Sheikh Bey Moao came to see mo yesterday. He askon me, rather uncomfortably, v/hat the meaning of the French declaration to Oriental Christians meant. He mantel to know if French interest was limited to Christians, or if it extended to the Syrian Mohammedans who were accustomed to look on Franco as a second native country, !i I replied that you were pointing out France's special duties towards Catholics, and 'that the friendship of France was extended to all Syrians, irrespective of sect or religion, ' It was obvius that Sherif Bey had boon much impressed by tho efforts made among Busulmon, to incline them towards England, and your words about Christians have supported these efforts powerfully. However the declarations, I made satisfied him fully, and he thanked me warmly, after asking me several times to repeat 11137 ' explanation,' He then explained the actual measures of reform desired in SYRIA; he wanted automony, tho substituting of a principality for the three Syrian privonces, and the exclusion of Turks from public affairs. He asked if Franco was ready to send an Army corps to ALEPPO, if the Ottoman Government tried to use force against SYRIA. I replied to Shefik Bey guardedly, I told him that the Ottoman Government opposed reform because it thought it would lead to separation. Assurances should be given on the point, when government officials were all Arabs, and local roveneues were spent by them, In the provinces, they would havo all the reform they wanted• Shefik Bey is going to Egypt now. He will certainly repeat to the English Government the declaration he made me, and will compare the answers he gets. All I hope Is , that they will be sincere with him.

The following are reported to be the reasons f'or the resignation of the Sheikh-ul-Islam, Hairi Effendi, and Ills replacement by the well-known Young Turk polite ician and lawyer Fussa Kiasim Bey In pursuance of their policy of taking possession of all the Turkish Departments of State, the Germane have succeeded in pushing their way into the Ministry of Public Instruction, where they now exercise a predom inant influence and control over secular education. During the last few months symtoms of strong anti- German propaganda have been manifest In the schhols for the training of Hojas and Kadis and in the schools'at Fatih (which are not State-controlled' but come under the direct supervision of the SheikJh-ul-Xelam,) The reason for this attitude is the conviction that the candidates for Government positions from these schools would not be as favourably considered as those from the non-religious schools recently established by the Young Turks under German direction. The Evkaf Ministry endeavoured to discharge and prosecute those teachers who had led the meetings of protest. The Sheikh-Ul**Islam opposed the act'ioh of the Ministry, whereupon the German officials demanded that in order to avoid a recurrence of these disorders, the teaching of the Sheikh-ul-Islam should in future be deleted from the curriculum of the higher schools for the training of officials. This was strongly opposed by Hairi Bey. 2 .- 2 ~ During the last few months several Mohameclans have been arrested and tried for High Treason for having ^preached against the Germans in the mosques. These cases had to be tried under the 'Sheri” laws in the religious courts and the accused were acquitted in each case, an the religious laws do not provide punishment for attacks on ”infidels” but only for a direct attack on the Sultan himself. The Government have now, particularly in Angora and Smyrna arrester, tried, in the civil courts, and condemned to death, a number of Hojas for preaching against the Germans in the mosques. This called forth a strong protest from the Sheikh-ul-Islam. It was then decided by the Government that in future all casws other than those in which family rights were involved should be tried by civil courts, which practically means the suppression of the power of the Sheikh-ul-Islam. Hairi Bey then resigned and was re placed by Mussa Kiassim Bey, an ignorant and half educated Kurd from the KHARPUT district, who,owing to a natural capacity for intrigue, has worked his way to the front of the Young Turk Party, and has already held the post of Sheikh-ulIslam for a short time until his arbitary and unorthodox decisions made it necessary to remove him. ARABIA. Private lettor from an Arab at ADEN, date^ May, 1916, Saoud Pasha, Turkish C.-in-C. at LAHEJ, is sending leaflets containing Fetwas of the Sheikh-ul-Islam at CONSTANTINOPLE declaring that every Moslem ought to join the Khalifate in a JEHAD and those who do not join or assist are infidels and to be treated as such. The Arabs have a story -'that the fox was once asked who was his witness to prove a certain claim of his, and he replied, that it was his tail” - so the Turks advance a Turk who is appointed by them as Sheikh-ul-Islam to support their claim. In fact the Prophet has denounced the Turks before their appearance and predicted that they would rob his nation of their wealth and possessions and* he urged on the Arabs to make a stand against the Turks on their appearance and fight them. This is written in the most approved books of the Prophet s traditions. The last hour shall not come until you fight with the Turks who are small-eyed, red-faced. flat-faced, their faces are like hammered shields, and 'The first people who will deprive them (my nation) of their possessions and what God has granted them are the children of Kantura” i.e. £he Turks, and this has actually occurred for the last Abbasside Khalifs were conquered by the Turks, one of them was put in a bag and kicked until he died by the Turks in BAGHDAD when Hulagu entered BAGHDAD and murdered about 600,000, Mohammedans mostly women and children. Another lyialif was dethroned and his eyes branded with red hot iron._ 3.^ * - 3 - The traditions in Abdel D&amp;wud clearly say that those Moslems who will copuet with the Turks or join them shall be treated as infidels and shall go to hell. The Ulemas in some countries pass over these traditions because they fear that the Islamic prestige will be destroyed, and it is better to have a head than to be without it. The Arabs in the part of Yemen up to SANA are tired of the Turks and hate them heartily but they cannot b§r themselves eject them and overcome their trained troops and artillery. I dor not think the Imam and Idrisi can do it themselves. Though the Arabs hate the Turks they are more afraid of them now in consequence of the delay in ejecting them from LAH'hJ as’ it magnifies bEeir power in their eyes and they also fear a terrible retribution from them. ADEN. Mak&amp;lla Sultan reported that early in May a Sayid who had passed through the AUDHALI and AULAKI'reported to him that the Imam had not yet come to any decision, but was contemplating a move towards the Hadhranaut. The Makalla and Audhali in such case will oppose him, and think that with the natural difficulties of their country on their side, they should be able to resist any advance of the Turks or of the Imam. H E S (0 P 0 T A M I A. To the British offloors who wore arranging tho exchange of our wounded from KUT Halil Pasha, Commander- in-Chiof of tho Turkish forcos in Irak, spoko very freely on tho question of tho Arab attitude.

I suggested to them tho case of Sami Boy, tho son of Houssa Pasha : and thoy said that t he Russian War of *60 and tho Defence of Kars fell on a different footing, v/hon tho Arabs were still loyal to tho Ottoman Empire.

The situation has now developed into certainty. The Sherif has burnt his boats, and must stand or lall by what he has done. So Lu his operations seem to have met with considerable success. The railway West of Medina has been cut * Mecca, Taif and Jedda have fallen. The main question is whether he will be able to capture Medina before the Turks can relieve it. At present it is urgent that the Sherif should be given all possible assistance in munitions, food, and money to enable him to make headway during the hot months of -1 uly and August, during which time the Arabs have a greater power of action than the Turks. 1 he Sherif’s action will probably bring Idris of Asir in with some enthusiasm, and with careful management influence the Imam of Yemen. 1 he question of introducing the French Government (see page of Report) to the Sherif is a matter which will require action within the next fortnight. As regards military operations the Sherif’s position may become, critical in September, when the weather improves and a release of Turkish troops in Armenia may be anticipated. The information regarding Ibn Rashid is somewhat regrettable. Ibn Rashid may be yet won over to our side. In any case politically it would be preferable that he should be dealt with by the Koweit Arabs rather than by us. His force of 600 men is not of much account unless it be the advance guard of a Turkish expedition. If it is, and the Turks push down a large force, it is the Turks that matter and not Ibn Rashid. The consequence of a Turkish counter-stroke in Mesopotamia along the Euphrates culminating in a second battle of Shaiba might be very serious as it menaces our base. The situation at Aden remains unchanged, but it will be noticed that events in Ilejaz have for the present isolated the Turkish Yemen command from any possible communication with Syria, and that the 1,400 Turks and 20 guns outside Aden, where they are facing 3,000 British troops with 18 guns, are morally in a worse position than they were. The fact that with the help of II.M.S. Fox and liar ding e the Sherd’s levies have obliged 1,400 Turks to surrender may, however, provoke odious comparisons with our passivity at Aden. The co-operation of the Indian Government with that of Egypt seems to lack enthusiasm, and Indian political internal policy to act as a drag oi S 311I i *rr operations. The Indian Government lias done nothing vifh its Arab prisoners, objected to the blockade of Hejaz, has no Aiab policy m Mesopotamia, and has not done much to bring about good relations between Ibn Sand, or Idris of A sir and the Sherif. The telegram from General Lake, see No. , also appears to show that there is a certain amount of friction between Cairo and Simla. The Kurdish news from the Caucasus is good, and shows that the Russians are making the best of the situation by using Kurdish rebels against the Turks. 'This may later on prove a valuable link between the Sherif and the Russians. (Signed) Mark Sykes. 19th June 1910. rr1 ) SECRET. Reprinted for Reference onbi. ARABIAN REPORT. (No. XIXa.)

He gave, however, an outline of the Sherif’s plan of action. Medina, he said, had been attacked on the 4th by Feisal and Ali, Ids brothers. Their object was to cut the Hejaz Railway and advance up it as far as Medain Salih, but communications had been severed and no reliable news was available. On LOth June the general rising was to begin. The Sherif himself would attack the Turks at Mecca, his son Abdullah those at Taif, and his nephew and Naib (representative) Abdel Mohsin El Barakati would deal with those at Jeddah. The Sherif sent an optimistic message to the effect that the Ateiba, Harb and Jeheina had already joined him, and that the Anazeh would do so when the revolt began. He said also that if the Turks surrendered he would not kill them ; and finally that he would need later all the Arab officers that could be sent to him. Mr. Storrs was favourably impressed by what Zeid told him. For, though the Sherif seemed to have made no adequate preparations and to be ignorant of modern warfare, his intentions were clearly genuine, and the numerical superiority of the Arabs, in South Hejaz at any rate, made it appear probable that they would be at least primarily successful. This confidence was justified by events. The revolt at Medina appears to have started on the date mentioned by Zeid, and to have succeeded beyond expectations. The general rising appears to have begun a day before its time. On the 9th June the Turks at Jeddah, numbering about 2,000, with (it is said) 28 guns and machine guns, were reported to be entrenched north of the town, with an Arab force of about 4,000 facing them. In anticipation of the possibility of naval co-operation, the Admiralty, having in view the promise of the Allies not to molest the Holy Places, issued orders that no bombardment was to take place without the expressed request of the Arab leaders. W hen this request was formally made, fire was directed during the evening of the 9th on the Turkish trenches outside and north of the town by H.M.S. Fox and Hardinge. The Arabs were apparently dispirited at not having had a walk-over. Areifan, the Sherif’s go-between, reported that they were complaining of shortage of food and money, and threatening to secede. On the 10th June the position was unchanged. The Turkish trenches were again shelled from the sea by request, but the Arab forces made no move, being, apparently, not ready for a decisive assault. On the same day Cairo, hearing of the revolt, sent R.I.M.S. Uufferin, with 50,000/. in cash, to the Sherif via Jeddah, and Faruki, for whom the Sherif specially asked, went with the money. He will incidentally form a valuable link between Cairo and the Sherif, and will be able to provide S 311 30 6/191(5 A IIiiitarv situation. reliable information as to the m despatched a Moslem liaison officer to ll.M.fe). Fox to lacilitate between tiie British men-of-war and the Arabs at Jeddah. On the 13th R.JM.S. Dufferin carrying Farnki money arrived off Jeddah. But before he could arrive at Jeddah the Arabs, early in the morning of 13th June, attacked the Turkish trenches at Jeddah without warning, and consequently lost the support of H.M.S, Fox and Hardinge. They were driven back by the Turkish guns. After this initial reverse at Jeddah, however, they appear to have succeeded everywhere. The exact dates of each movement are as yet difficult to ascertain but the situation, appears at present to be as follows :— Mecca, with the possible exception of two small points outside the city, is in the Sherifs hands. The Turkish Sub Vaii, the Commandant, and the Government officials have surrendered. Tail has fallen to Abdullah, with the exception of two forts. The Turks at Jedd ah surrendered on 16rh June (possibly through the influence of Faruki) ; they numbered 1,400 with 45 officers and 6 guns. At Medina the Arabs under Feisal and Ali have apparently torn up the last 150 kilometres of the Ifejaz railway, and arc closely investing the Turkish garrison. A recent rumour says that Ali Haidar, the Turkish nominee to the Shexfate, is in the vicinity with a new Turkish force, but it remains unconfirmed. The Arabs appear to have captured also two isolated Turkish forts between Jeddah and Mecca ; and all Turkish communications in Hejaz appear now to be in the Sherif’s hands. 12th Cairo co-operation The Raj Problem. Zeid, in Ids interview with the representatives of the Arab Bureau, asked especially that the llaj should not be disturbed by the blockade or by offensive action in the Jeddah region. Before Jeddah fell, the Haj raised several problems. First, the question of allowing pilgrim ships into Jeddah. It was at once decided that authorise:I ships carrying pilgrims in the regular manner should be admitted without restrictions. Secondly, the question of provisioning the pilgrims. While, on the one hand, it would have been possible for the British Government to say that when once safely landed their provisioning was their own affair, it was felt that any hardships which Indian pilgrims might incur would react upon British prestige in India. The Admiralty therefore stated that they were willing to allow a ship to take food to the Arabian coast for the pilgrims, in view of the political importance of such a measure. thirdly, the Sherif had in the past found the llaj his main source of income. 11, as seemed inevitable, fewer pilgrims decided to go to Mecca than previously, it was thought that he would turn to Great Britain to make up his deficit. In fact he had already suggested that Great Britain should pay to him the grants previously made by the Ottoman Government for the Holy Cities. I he fall of Jeddah has altered the situation, for trade and communi cation by sea con now lie opened to Ifejaz ports, Cairo have accordingly suggested that it should be made widely known at once throughout the Moslem world that the difficulties which for the last two years attended the yearly pilgrimage will now be removed. SHE RIF OF MECCA, Arms and Supplies. 1 he Sherif of Mecca has been making repeated and urgent requests for more arms and ammunition. He sent a message by Zeid to say that he needs 10,000 rifles with 4,000,000 rounds of ammunition ; six machine-guns with 150,000 rounds of Mark VI.; six 10-pounder guns and 3,000 rounds.For the machine and mountain guns—of which at present he has none—he would prefer trained Moslem crews and officers. In answer to this request, Cairo originally hoped to send the machine guns and mountain guns on 17th J une, together with 1,500 tons of stores and 20,0000 in cash for the Medina force, providing that the revolt proved genuine. When the outbreak was confirmed, steps were immediately taken. As a preliminary measure of relief, necessary owing to the shortage of food among the Arab troops North of Jeddah and the consequent danger of their becoming demoralised (as reported by Areifan), the Naval Authorities on the 18th June reopened Jeddah and the North Hejaz ports to restricted trade from Sudan. For two reasons., however, the despatch of machine and mountain guns (which are available in Egypt) seems to have been delayed ; first, the vast accumulation of other stores for the Sherif tends to monopolise the available transport; secondly, it has not been possible to provide adequate Moslem gun crews at such short notice. In view of the latter difficulty, the Sirdar has proposed that a complete Egyptian field artillery battery under a Senior Egyptian Colonel should be sent. Soudanese are not available, though semi-trained crews might be raised in six weeks, and the Sultan of Egypt believes that, if care be taken not to send anyone with religious scruples, Egyptians would prove trustworthy. This scheme awaits sanction. The Attitude of the Indian Government. The policy of doing anything that may interfere with the Ilaj has been criticised by the Indian Government, who are concerned at the effect that such action may have on Indian Moslem feeling. The Indian Government has pointed out that the policy of keeping the Holy Places of Hejaz out of the arena has had valuable results in India ; and that it was out of deference to Cairo, and with reluctance, that they agreed in the first instance to the blockade. In view of its institution the liaj Committee at Bombay felt it necessary recently to issue circulars tending to discourage intending pilgrims. , The recent naval action at Jeddah has in consequence been viewed in India with grave apprehension. It is thought there that any aggressive policy in the neighbourhood of Jeddah will be hard to reconcile primd facie with the Allies’ formal promise not to violate the Holy Places. Simla has warned the authorities of the danger of making such action public. In anticipation of these views, precaution had been taken to prevent any news from being published. Secret information has been given to the French and Russian Governments, who have been kept posted with the various phases of the movement. The attitude of the Indian Government with regard to the Arabian problem is epitomised in the telegrams reprinted below . (.4) The Blockade and the A aval Operat ions off Jedda. “ Prom Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2nd June 191b. “ (Repeated to Cairo.) “ Secret. Blockade of Hedjaz.

Aden reports that his feud with the Tdrisi is irreeuneilable, and urges an attack on the Turks at Lahej. -See under “ Aden.” A SIR. 77m Idrisi. The Idrisi was, previous to the revolt, uncertain. He was inactive, but the Sherif described his attitude as “ satisfactory.” Since then he seems to have made up his mind. On llthJune Aden announced that he was willing to take offensive action against the Turks as soon as he was convinced of the truth of the Sherif s revolt, and on the 14th that he had given a definite promise, in view of the Sherif’s offensive, to attack the Turkish posts in Asia. With the Imam of Yemen, however, he still seems irreconcilable. I Infill id and Bah d Tribes. The Hashid and llakil have remained friendly towards Aden. They are strongly anti-Turk and an attempt is being made through the Idrisi to secure their active support. llm Saud and Tim Rashid. The Sherif s last message describes Ibn Sand’s attitude as satisfactory. Since his expedition against flail lie seems to have done nothing. Ibn Rashid, on the other hand, has been on the move continually. From Arkhamish, where he was recently, he went to Abu Ghar (15 miles west of Khamsieh), thence to fvasr Birshagrah (20 miles south of Khamsieh), from there to Safwan (20 miles south of Zobeir, between Basra and Koweit). A special messenger, sent to ask him his intentions, found him at Safwan on 10th J une. 1 ie had with him 600 men, of whom half were camel sowars, and half horsemen, lie openly confessed that he was a Turkish subject, and in Turkish pay, and said that he could not, therefore, communicate with the British authorities in writing. His movements, he said, were due to Turkish orders, for they had told him to harass the British force as best he could. If Turkish troops approached Zobeir, he said, he would at once join them ; otherwise he had no intention of moving. He claimed as the price of this abstention the right to send his caravans to the British markets at Zobeir ; otherwise he would do his utmost to make a nuisance of himself whenever possible. . The answer sent to him was to the following effect: that il he would withdraw to Arkhamieh, reasonable facilities would be given him for sending caravans to Zobeir. But that no caravan would be admitted till he has actually reached Arkhamieh, and then only so long as he abstained from anv unfriendlv action against the British forces. He was advised to move as soon as possible, as otherwise British cavalry might come into contact with his fighting men. . , , 1 , On receipt of this message Ibn Rashid adopted a truculent attitude and refused to move from his camp, till a column of all arms was organised against him at Zobeir, upon which he hastily decamped westwards. JSq attempt has been made to follow him up. . . , ; It seems not impossible that the Turks may have some scheme m mmd for attacking Basra from the west, in conjunction with Ibn hashid or the bearing of this it is necessary to recall the events preceding the hast j battle of Shaiba. ADEN. The following is a precis of a reportfrom the General Officer Commanding, / Aden, dated 13th May 1916. i i • u, \ r m 71 The following four courses of action appear possible m the Aden j region :— J. To remain on the passive defence in Sheikh Otliman, as at present. Aden with a covering force atthe Tiban delile It 2. To advance to Lahej and command the outlets from 3. To occupy Dala, and reach the old frontier line. 4. To occupy Taiz, thus assuming a Protectorate over all S.\Y\ Yemen. In the case of any of the first three, it would be almost necessary to occupy Sheikh Said. With regard to these alternatives : — (1) In the future, even more than in the past, it will be found impossible to regard Aden as an isolated post disconnected with the Hinterland. (2) The Sheikh Othman position has military drawbacks, and its occupation is politically ineffective. Laiiej would be a good position to hold, offering a wide radius of action for troops, being- well placed both for controlling the coast Arabs and for blocking the approaches to Aden. Further, Lahej is closer to Aden than any other centre at which a hostile force could collect for an attack upon Aden. ^ There are convenient positions near Lahej, e.g., at A1 Anad and Tannan from which three or four battalions with guns could deny the approach to Lahej of a much superior force. The chief disadvantage of the scheme, i.e,, the presence of mosquitoes, is balanced by the fertility of the district. (o) Dala would provide a sanatorium for Aden troops; but it is o r strategical importance, and is regarded as not worth any risk. (4) The occupation of Taiz appears the most attractive proposition. Xl is a big scheme, and would require a permanent force of a division. It would necessitate too the carrying on of the railway from Aden to Taiz; and it might entail trouble with the Imam of'Yemen, but vmuld be viewed favourably by the Idrisi, to whom some coast land could be offered. The climate is very good. The place is of great strategic value, for the new frontier would be naturally defensible and any force placed there would be well placed for use in Persia’ India, East Africa, the Red Sea coast, or the West. The trade of all the Yemen would be greatly increased under a stable government. This m the opinion of the General Officer Commanding, Aden is the least advance that should be made. It is noteworthy that his decision preceded the Sheriffs revolt which has put the Lahej Turks in a difficult and isolated position. ^n e i Stl0n ° f Lalu ' J ' raises the ( l uestion Sheikh Said, for it is thomdit that it will be necessary to occupy the latter if it is decided not to advance beyond the former, for Sheikh Said dominates the Bab-Al-Mandab Straits • ^ f J ° + uld Vrovide a natural defence for Perim.

An enemy machine recently attacked Serapeom, the railhead in the vicinity, and finally some shipping in the Canal, without doing serious damage anywhere. A retaliatory raid was made on 13th June on El Arish and Bir Mazar. At El Arish a large aerodrome, capable of holding 20 machines, was located. Turks captured near Katia say that a large number of German aeroplanes are expected at El Arish in the near future. The British forces guarding the Canal have been systematically emptying the enemv’s cisterns at Moiya Harab, Gebelum, and elsewhere. MESOPOTAMIA. British Policy. There seems to be a complete ignorance in the native mind in Mesopotamia as to what British intentions may be in the event of ultimate victory. Consequently it is thought in some quarters that a decision should be taken by the British Government, and made clearly and widely known ; since it is pointless for those not really guilty to incur suspicion, and because it is felt that, unless there is a cut-and-dried policy ready, the psychological moment for solving the problem may be lost in the event of a sudden military success. 1 lll . .... .. , One solution suggested is that the matter should be simplified by the co-ordination of Britain’s Arab policy, i.e., by putting Egyptian and Mesopotamian affairs under a single control, preferably in London ; and by puttino- at the head of any such body as might be specially appointed someone intimately conversant with the conditions on either side of the desert and with British relations to Arabs of all kinds and colours. Tribes. The following is the gist of a report from the Headquarters of Force “ D,” dated 28th April. General. ('onsidering the fall of Kut, the attitude of the Mesopotamian Arabs was satisfactory during the last weeks of April. T . , , . Certain sections west and south-west of the Hammar Lake gav e iurthei Si.,,,s of hostility ; but the only recruits to the Anti-British party were some Nasiriyeh tribes and the tribes of the Shatt Al Hai, who in February joined the Khayun Al Obeid m the Butaniyah lighting.

Minor punitive operations were conducted in this region. Certain Nasiriyeh and Suk-Es-Shyukh tribes, though &lt;pdet, openly said that they would join the Turks if events went against the British. Many tribes in this region who have for years been able to avoid paying tribute to Turkey dislike the arrival of the British, because they see in anv prospect of settled government financial loss to themselves. They are as irreconcilably hostile to the Turks as to the British. delations with Sheikh Ibrahim of Zobeir and Sheikh Hamad of Khamsieh cont inued friendly.

The This si a ns and the Kurds. rhe punitive measures which the Russians were compelled to take recently against certain Kurdish tribes who treacherously attacked them seem to have succeeded in the Rowanduz region, where the concentrated attacks on the Russian rear have ceased altogether. In the Serdesht direction, however, they still continue. Between Amadia unci Neri the Kurds, on the whole, are friendly but they do not often leave the hills.

To be Read. 1 i o APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED ARAB REPORT. Considering the historical magnitude of the events taking place in Hejaz and the importance of concerted action, this week’s report is decidedly disappointing. So far as can be ascertained there is little or no co-ordination of our political policy, and from reading telegrams one gets a sense of military isolation as regards Egypt, Mesopotamia and Aden. In Mesopotamia no notice seems to be taken of events occurring- in Hejaz, and no attempt appears to have been made to ascertain the attitude of Ibn Rashid and Ibn Sand towards the Sherif, nor, so far as can be ascertained, was any attempt made to advance the Sherif’s cause in Koweit. There is no indication that the Kerbela incident is being used in a racial sense, but only as a Shia-Sunni quarrel. In Aden the predominating idea seems rather to be, to lake advantage of the movement to get control of the hinterland and to prevent the Imam’s power extending, than to push forward a general Arab rising against the Turks. As regards the Idrisi, it would appear that either our Aden political officers are still as doubtful of the Sherif as they were in November 1915, or that they have little influence with Idrisi; otherwise it is difficult to understand what doubts Idrisi can entertain as to the Sherif’s motives. The Turkish communications appear to indicate that the Turks are somewhat at a loss to know what line to take. They have made no reference to the Sherif’s attitude so far, and content themselves with charging Great Britain with bombarding sacred shrines. Either the Turkish Government is afraid or intends to keep silence until it has achieved some success. The difficulty of getting supplies to Jeddah and the shortage thereof would point to a want of material and transport which requires immediate attention. The slowness of the Government of India in despatching the Arab prisoners to Egypt, and the lack of investigation of their attitude or antecedents by the Indian Military Authorities, appears to be somewhat singular. These prisoners of war were isolated from other Turkish prisoners nearly a year ago for political reasons, in order to facilitate the Arab movement ; since then nothing has been done, and at the critical moment punctillio has caused delay, by necessitating telegrams in the following order : Cairo—Simla, Simla—London, London—Simla, with the usual lapses of time between receipt and reply.1 2 As regards propaganda, Mr. Rndyard Kipling’s remark will give the Germans an opportunity they will not he slow to miss ; its appearance in a Government publication indicates a want of knowledge of the actual attitude of the Entente Powers towards the Arabs on the part of the Press Bureau. It may be added that the usual laudatory comments on the general conduct of the Turks and their natural freindship for the British y continue to appear in British official communications. The tendency to drift and the lack of cohesive British political effort all round in Arab affairs seems to suggest that an early definition in regard to a common policy in Arabia is advisable.

Little news lias come through, about the operations m Hejaz since the Mate of the last report. The Turks seem to have grasped the seriousness of tie position at once. From a partially decipherable wireless message, which was recently intercepted, it appears that Jemal Pasha, on learning of the revolt, sent a force down the Hejaz Railway under the command of Fakhri Pasha. Abdurrhaman Yusuf accompanied him, and it seems that the Turks set to work immediately to repair the damaged line. The latest news is to the effect that Fakhri Pasha is at Medina, but the exact military situation is not clear. 1 . Faruki reports from Jedda that Pith has surrendered with a small garrison. . •There is no news of the fort at Taif, which was recently reported to be holding out against Abdullah. The Sherifs Prospects. The Turkish force in Syria is said to be between 35,000 and 40,000 men. The Sherif of Mecca has under arms at present only 15,000, though lie could raise ten times that amount. . m -p .• m He has asked for four aeroplanes to assist him m the lad regioip an would also like the Indian Government to send him all the Arab officers they can. He begs for the resumption of the Sudan postal service and lor the repairing of the cable there from Jedda. There is no doubt that his requests for supplies and ammunition will become more and more irequent as the revolt goes on. . . . , , • ,&gt; Qn QT .;-p It is generally thought that active assistance should be given the bherit in his attempts to destroy the Hejaz Railway, on the success of winch so much depends.

Though the Idrisi has given definite assurances that lie has no intention of acting against the Sheriff interests, he seems still to suspect his motives. III 1 YEMEN. The imam and the Hashid and Bak'd. It is thought in Aden that the Imam, despite his record, may yet be- brought over if the Turks fail to quell the revolt in Ilejaz. In any case, it is thought that the frankly hostile attitude to the Turks of the Hashid and Bakil, who are two of the most powerful of his tribes, may tend to discourage him from action. Aden is sending him a friendly letter, the Idrisi having expressed a hope that he would join him. fMfil ' I At IH ADEN. The following are the main points in a report from the General Officer Commanding, Aden, dated 29th May 1916, dealing with the effect of the Sherif’s revolt upon the situation at xYden. The Idrisi, aided by the Imam’s tribes of Hashid and Bakil, and assisted by supplies of ammunition from Great Britain, should be able to give the Turks trouble, even though the Imam were to join the Turks against him. I he Imam, being an inland power, is of much less consequence than the Idrisi. I he problem that may arise is this : if the Idrisi rises the Turks may detach troops from Aden to deal with him, thus giving Aden the chance of an advance. An offensive would seem advisable on two grounds :— ( 1 ) To fulfil a moral obligation to the Idrisi. ( 2 ) lo assume the right to advance to our defined frontier, which in the eyes of the Arabs would otherwise lapse. If the Imam anct the IdrEi were to combine against the Turks, they could probably easily put an end to the Turkish I emen army 5 in which case, unless British forces cooperated the Imam could justifiably claim the control of the districts previously administered by the Turks, and his ejection would be difficult. It is thought that to maintain British power 111 the Aden region it will be necessary at least to adopt a more active defensive attitude than previously. This might involve an advance in force against the Turks as far as would make it possible to cut off their retirement north of Lahej ; but probably not further because according to present orders, the Aden force must not act in such a way as to make it necessary for the Turks to bring extra reinforcements against it. • ^ would certainly be a good stroke to join with the local Arabs or even without them, in cutting off the Turks at Lahej, whether it is decided to advance further or not. To do this, two modern field batteries, two good infantry battalions, and as many mounted cavalry as could be temporarily lent from Somaliland would be necessary. The Zaranik Tribe. The Zaranik Sheikh having been asked to prove his alleged friendship to Great Britain by deeds attacked some Turks at Baital Eakih on 13th June, lour lurks were killed, their telegraph wires were cut, and telegraphic instruments seized. r It appears that his men capture.! a Turkish post-bag on 11 th June and set ftre to the Lurfash magazinoin the mosque at Marawah, capturing some V i Tv, Y a . m TT 10 “' 1 ! ley , are beln s supplied with food stuffs from Aden and intend to make a further attack.THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT. (1) The Arab Prisoners of War. The Indian Government have, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s. Government, agreed to send the Arab artillery officer prisoners to Egypt, with a view to their being used to aid the Sherif of Mecca. The difficulty, however, that has arisen, is that the Indian Government cannot identify accurately any of them, not knowing their antecedents. They therefore suggest that the whole of the personnel should be despatched to- Egypt for selection. There are in India 16 commissioned officers, 39 non commissioned officers, and 86 men. 2. —fa) The Arab Bureau. “ From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 20th .June 191(5. “ (Addressed to Secretary of State, and. repeated to General Officer Commanding Force “ D ” and Cairo as 804 S.) “ Secret.

The details of the recent disturbances at Kerbela are now available. It ppears that on 22nd April a quarrel began between the inhabitants of verbela and the local Turkish garrison, which usually numbers lot) .endarmes but had recently been swelled by 400 Turkish cavalry from l a drab. On the first day the conflict was undecided, but 0(H) 1 urkish roops were sent from Bagdad in driblets. On 14th Mav the Turks who occupied the new part of the town v ere- 1 coded out by a sudden rise of the river. They made a sortie, using bombs md supported by artillery. i • ■ i + n They killed about 130 of the inhabitants of both sexes and incidentally jombarded the minarets and sacred domes, doing them much damage.4 Their attack was unsuccessful, however, and retired from the town with casualties of about 200 . Documents protesting against the violation of the holy places are being allowed to be circulated from Persian sources amongst the Moslems of Persia and elsewhere. A circular letter signed by 200 of the chief inhabitants of Kerbela and endorsed by two of the Uluma has been sent to the British authorities at Bazrah for the Persian Government and people. Baghdad. Severe dissensions between the Shia and the JPunni communities in Baghdad appear to have broken out as a result of the Turkish action in Kerbela. Reception of the News of the Arab Revolt. Satisfactory articles have appeared in the leading British papers, showing a proper appreciation of the forces behind the Pan-Arab movement/ The news has, broadly speaking, been well received by the Moslems of Java, Egypt, Algeria, Bombay, and Tunis. In unfortunate contrast is a sentence from a recent article by Ru dvard a leading daily paper. Speaking of the Turks, he saysT “ One cannot rejoice over dead Mohammedans unless they are Arabs’’—a statement which the Central Powers will not be slow to use as propaganda/ The Turks have been publishing the following false statement in connection with the British naval activity in the Red Sea “ British ships continue from time to time to bombard undefended places on the shore of the Red Sea, and without military reasons to direct their fire mainly against the holy places, mausoleums, and mosques. “ According to the last report received, a British ship bombarded the mausoleum of Sheikh Hamid on the coast near Medina ; another ship bombarded the harbour of Jeddah on the coast near Mecca ” Reuter. i ^ir^^^/the-is stl11 510 information from Turkish sources about the Sherif’s rebellion.• Musi t* estdbliehed; end beer&gt; created for i eh'iraied in Kj that it W 9 t be divided into regions, eooh under the rule of a excluded.

Cozens-Hardy.I A perusal of the accompanying Report will show that the Sherif seems on the verge of action and that Idris is loyal, from which it may be inferred that the Arab movement is progressing better than circumstances would lead us to expect. If we look at the situation from an Arab point of view this will be apparent. An Arab sees (1) that we have no decided political policy as such towards Arabs in Mesopotamia ; (2) that small forces of Turks can hang about unmolested within a few miles of Aden, and can quell Arab revolts taking place in their area ; (3) that a large area of the Egyptian territory is still occupied by the Turks, who can occasionally capture small bodies of British troops, while we can only “ drive out ” small bodies of Turkish troops who return when we have gone. The Sherif who has hitherto regarded us as an unfailing source of bakhshish and rifles, has probably committed himself further than he intended in his negotiations, and now owing to the Turks finding him out, has to rise whether he will or no. If the Sherif does rise, it will not only redound to our further discredit, but, if we allow him to be smashed up by the Turks at leisure as was the Sultan of Lahej, will naturally increase our disc omfort. When the Turks have dealt a blow at the Grand Duke in the Caucasus they will probably despatch a couple of divisions to the Hejaz and make short work of the Sherif. This would mean henceforth a Turkish nominee as Sherif and the final squashing of any hopes of a weakened Turkey or of a non-Ottoman Caliphate, and would prepare the way for a real pan- Islamic rising. I am of opinion that if a rising takes place in Hejaz, which the enemy is given leisure to quell in Turco-Teutonic style, the middle East will become a source of greater danger than ever it was before, and a serious drag on operations in the West. The Lahej episode will be repeated on a grand scale. It is further to be observed that the extermination of the Syrian Christians has begun, as I anticipated in my report to the War Council in December. The form it is taking is one I had not foreseen, viz., artificial famine in place of massacre. Recourse to this means of destruction appears to indicate that the Germans fear the odium of massacre, and that the Turks have not yet got complete control of the minds of the Syrian Moslem masses. s 309—1 30—6/1916■ With regard to the reports from the Caucasus, the Russians are eager to co-operate in the Arab policy and the Kurdo-Arab policy, but unfortunately their staff is unacquainted with the’ mentality and local conditions of the Southern Kurds and the Kurdo-Arabs of Mosul and Diarbekir who form the connecting link with the Arabs. I suggested the despatch of an officer who could have assisted them, and the Grand Duke welcomed such a course, but owing to various delays no one was sent. The Russians are for want of men forced to use Armenian militia in Southern Kurdistan, which means, I fear, resistance d outrance, the influx of Moslem refugees to Mosul, and the spread of rumours which will tend to consolidate all Ottoman parties in those regions. It is impossible to ameliorate matters from London by telegrams, and, as Colonel Marsh and Captain Napier know nothing of Southern Kurdistan or Mosul, it is impossible for them to sift such meagre information as they obtain or make suggestions on this head of any value to the Russian staff. 1 recommend the despatch to Colonel Marsh of Mr. Matthews, to assist him with the intelligence work, and to enable Colonel Marsh to understand the bearing of such information as he receives from Egypt. It will be observed that in this report there is no political news from Mesopotamia ; the reason for this is that it is not supplied. I think, in view of the Sheriffs position, an early decision by His Majesty’s Government with regard to our political policy in Mesopotamia is required. 1 believe that the faults lie not with the Arab situation, which is good, but with the want of a vital policy on our part, which we never can have until we are decided about Mesopotamian Arabs. We must anticipate that the Turkish plan will be to stun the Russians, then deal with General Gorringe and the Sherif, and if the war continues make a concentrated effort against Egypt with a united Empire behind them. N.B-.—In the past week the following work has been done at this branch of the C.I.D. :— (1) Memorandum on Arab policy in Mesopotamia. (2) Recommendation that Mr. Albina proceed to U.S.A. to report on Arab situation there. Mr. Albina left on Friday. {■&gt;) Suggested that Captain Hon. Aubrey Herbert should visit Turkish prisoners of war in India and in Burma. I do not know whether any decision has been come to with regard to this.SECRET. 3 apJ i Reprinted for Reference onhj. A R A B I A I X A S I A. (No. XVIIIa.) Week ending, 5tli June 1916. Part I. SHE RIF OF MECCA. Arabian events liave, on the whole, been moving steadily on favourable lines, but a critical stage has now been reached. The Sherifs determination appears to have survived both the fall of Kut and the letter from the British Government sent on 8th May (in which it was made clear by implication that Great Britain could not fall in with his Syrian project). The gist of the letter of the 8th May was as follows :— “ The supplies and arms promised in the last letter are at Port Soudan, and the blockade has been ordered. “ If your complaints of the behaviour of Russian troops in Kurdish districts are justified, the people who have committed such crimes must be local irregulars, fired by a spirit of revenge for the horrible atrocities inflicted, by Turks and Kurds on Armenians; it is impossible to think that the Russian Government approves of any such conduct. Your complaints have been communicated to the British Government. “ We have received information that the Russians have no designs upon Arab territory. “ Concentration of forces is better than division. Therefore the British Government advises you to withdraw Feisal from Syria and confine your operations to Hejaz and the South for the present. “ The Turks have abandoned their plan of attacking Egypt, and the enemy are being steadily driven from Sinai. “ The attitude of Nuri Es Shaalan and other Anazeh chiefs gives the British Government keen satisfaction. “ The British Government assures you that it will give you the utmost possible further assistance as soon as you have definitely raised the standard of revolt.” Another letter to the same effect but with a clearer warning that British co-operation in Syria was improbable was sent on the 22nd May. The Sherifs confidence in Great Britain, however, does not seem to have been shaken, either by Kut or by these letters. In fact, all the latest information points in the other direction, and he appears anxious to lose no time in starting the revolt. Cairo received independent evidence towards the end of May that both he and his son had been organizing the Harb tribe against Turkey. Many causes may contribute to the consistency of his attitude: the energy and ambition of his sons ; his fear (which he expressed recently to Cairo) that the Turks in Syria have discovered his plans, which may have made him believe that he has forfeited Turkish confidence in any event; and, probably more than all, the results of the blockade, which, from a letter dated 18th May, are proved to have been immediate and considerable. The “ strict patrol ” (a term substituted for the original name “ blockade ” to which there were political objections) came into full force on the 15th May. Preparatory measures had been taken before that date. Dhows on the sea had' been turned back with warnings ; sailings of dhows from Egypt and the S 309 2 30 - 6 1916 ASoudan had been forbidden; and, though for political reasons a formal proclamation Of a “ blockade ' was not made, informal warnings were disseminated broadcast to the following effect:— “A year ago Great Britain, always the friend of Islam, was induced by pity to raise the blockade of Jeddah and Hejaz. But she has found that by this means food has been going to the enemy. Therefore she is compelled to prevent all supplies from entering Hejaz by sea ; after loth May all dhows found on the sea will be seized or sunk. Great Britain still retains her friendship for the Arabs ; they will know who is the cause of their trouble.” In spite of this announcement great care was taken at lirst not to punish unoffending fishing craft and the like till the warning had been widely spread. To facilitate the carrying out of the patrol scheme, the French and Italian authorities were asked to substitute steamer for dhow traffic to Geiza. The only neutral country much concerned was Holland; provisional arrangements were made to allow her traffic to pass, but the naval authorities are now taking steps to find out whether there is any plan afoot to send supplies from the Dutch East Indies. On the 24th May, a message was received from the Sherif, presumably in answer to the letter of 8th May, outlined above. It came by wireless through the agent who went with the first consignment of supplies. In this message Abdullah, the Sherif’s second son, asked Mr. Storrs to meet him on the Arabian coast. 'The Sherif asked for a further remittance of 50,000L and Abdullah 10,0001. Feisal, the Sherif said, was expected shortly in Mecca, and the revolt would then begin. He also asked for Faruki, whose presence he said would be of the greatest value if he could be sent. Prompt action has been taken in answer to this message. On the 28th May Mr. Storrs, accompanied by members of the Arab Bureau, left for Port Soudan; there they have arranged to pick up the Sherif’s messenger; they will then proceed to the Hejaz coast and interview Abdullah. They have taken with them 10,0001. for Abdullah, and the British Government have approved of a further advance to the Sherif of 50,000/., preferably in instalments, provided that Mr. Storrs’report is favourable and that a real rising begins. The mission will try to give Abdullah a true conception of the military situation, to discover the exact intentions and position of the Sherif, and explain away any suspicions that may exist as to the future of Syria. Arrangements have been made to send Faruki to Port Soudan at the earliest opportunity. His military knowledge will, it is realized, be a valuable asset, and he will form a reliable channel for military intelligence. The last information from the Sherif has come through his trusted messenger Mohammed Areifan (Orayfan), who reached Port Soudan on the 27th May. Areifan brought with him cordial messages and a letter from the Sherif to the effect that everything was ready for a rising, that Feisal was expected soon, and that Faruki would, if he came, be sent to Mecca Areifan brought also a letter from Abdullah to Mr. Storrs, in which the imminence of the revolt was confirmed. And lastly he brought a verbal message from the Sherif leiteratmg lus need of money, and stating, first that he had made all arrangements for Mr. Storrs’ visit; secondly, that seven Germans had already been killed near Jeddah ; thirdly, that the Turks in Syria had discovered his plans, and that Feisal had been recalled in conse quence ; fourthly, that as a result the revolt must begin at once ; and. lastly, that he had sent a message to All Dinar, the Darfur Sultan urgmcr him to make peace with Great Britain. The crux of the whole matter will soon be reached. By the middle of May a considerable quantity of stores and ammunition had reached the Hejaz coast in safety. I he sole matter of regret was our inability to provide the Martini-Henry ammunition required, only Japanese rifles and ammunition being available. 'Ihis was unfortunate because the Sherif’s tribesmen are doubtless already armed, like most Arabs, with Martini-Henry carbines, and Aiabs, who nevei take any care of their arms, will have no hesitation in forcing any ammunition they can get into their rifles.3 In other respects the Sherif has been given all the material assistance that he has asked for in Hejaz, and if his resolve is genuine the declaration of the revolt will be a matter ot the next few weeks or even days. Accoiding to an unconfirmed report, in fact, the Sherif has already given orders lor all Turkish troops to leave Mecca immediately. Eight hundred Turkish soldiers are said to have arrived at Jeddah en route for Medina on the night of 31st May, and there is reason to think that the Arabs are meditating an attack upon Jeddah, as the Turks have prevented all food stuffs from leaving the town. IDRISI. It would seem that the Idrisi is animated by good intentions, and that his hatred of the 1 urks is genuine. Hut he is under the influence of his ministers, particularly Ba Said, and is still suspicious of the Sherif. 1 fe points out in a letter dated Oth May that for eight years he withstood the lurks, and that he wishes that the Sherif and the Imam of Yemen would join with him to drive them out. But the Turks brought both against him, the Sherif by force, the Imam by bribery. If these two could be detached from the Turks, he said, it would be a great gain. But he was doubtful. He said that he was sorry to hear of the surrender of Kut, and hoped that the British troops would take Baghdad. He had also heard, he said, that a large force of Turks had gathered at Medina against Mecca. At the time of writing the Idrisi clearly believed the Sherif to be powerless to resist the Turks, and probably in league with them, He does not forget the attack that the Sherifs eon, Abdullah, made on him in 1910 at a time when the Sherif was the representative of the Ottoman Government. He hinted in his letter that success for our arms in Mesopotamia would be an invaluable stimulant to the Arab anti-Turk organisation. But he wrote very cautiously, and made no reference to the Hashid and Bakil, whom he was recently trying to wean from the Imam, and whom bribery, he said then, would bring en masse against the Turks. Before he is likely to render any active assistance yet he needs two things : first, material military support; secondly, to be convinced that the Sherif really means to revolt against the Turks. A medical officer is being sent to Jezan to bring his cousin and messenger Mustafa Idris from Jezan (where he lies ill) to Aden. He will explain the Idrisi’s plans. At present the best policy seems to be to keep him anti- Turk in sentiment by promises of land after the war, and to aid him with arms and ammunition ; for, if not of much use now, he will be of value in case of a forward move from Aden. An unconfirmed rumour from an Italian source says that he has made peace with the Turkish Governor of Yemen, exchanged his prisoners of war, and withdrawn his garrison from the larafan Islands, leaving only the customs-officials. This is exceedingly improbable on the face of it, but it must not be forgotten that Idrisi is an Arab. It is rendered more improbable by the latest telegram from Aden, which states that the Idrisi’s attitude is satisfactory and that as much help as possible should be given him at an early date to procure his co-operation against the Turks. Some Yetterli rilles and ammunition have consequently been despatched to him. IMAM OF YEMEM. The Imam Yahya was at the end of May actively pro-Turk, but was meeting with opposition from the Beda and Kaiti Sultans, both of whom have been armed by Aden. IBN SAUD AXD IBN RASHID. Ibn Sand was reported back at Riadh on 22nd May, his expedition to Kasim having returned. Ibn Rashid was still in the north-east, and was reported to be with the Dhuffir. S 30!)— A 2Rpvn KERB EL A. Tt is reported that, as a result of a conflict Between Turks and Persians (Shiah tribesmen), Turks fired on the Shiah shrines at Kerbcla, and that in the ensuing outbreak some 300 Turks were killed. MUSCAT. Nil. Part II. ADEN. In the middle of May the Aushaki, who lie a few miles inland to the east of Mokha, were said to be in revolt against the Turks. It is now reported that the revolt has been suppressed and the tribal Sheikh captured. There seems to have been disturbance in Ilujeria also; on 13th May about 300 Turks left Lahej in a northerly direction, and were said to be going to collect taxes in Ilujeria. Rumours of unrest there have been confirmed, but no details as to its extent are yet available. The recent increase in the number of Turkish guns in the hinterland to 28 is not causing any alarm in official quarters. There are no longer 28 against Aden as a matter of fact, for one went with a party towards Mafalis early in May and later four others went north towards Hujeria on the tax collecting expedition mentioned above. This leaves 23. The British, it is true, have only 18 guns at Sheikh Othman to oppose them, but it is to be remembered that the Turks have far greater difficulty than we in supplying ammunition, that the material result of their guns has so far been small, and that every gun opposite Aden means one less against the Idrisi. About 400 500 Turks seem to have been withdrawn to Lahej from Subar and the neighbouring district at the end of May. The reason given, and believed in Aden, is that the troops would otherwise have deserted owing to the intense heat which had prevailed in the Sheikh Othman region. The Turkish forces containing Aden are given in the latest report as 1,000 Turkish infantry supported by 300 Arabs. The latest news seems to show that this force is preparing for a move northward in the near future. SINAI. Military News. The prevalent belief in Cairo since the middle of May has been that the enemy has probably abandoned his scheme of attacking the Suez Canal for the present. Pools and even wells have been drying fast, the heat on 15th May being over 100 degrees in the shade. This, though the cause of the enemy’s recent retirement from many of his advanced posts, has also protected him, since it has made pursuit difficult. In the middle of May the enemy’s advanced posts appear to have consisted of the followdng :— Bir Salmana - - -A few men. Bir El Maghara - - - 350 Bir El Mazar - 300 Bir Rodh Salem - - - 200 Jifjaffa Ain Sudr Sudr El He itan Of the garrisons further East the following statistics were reported : — El Arish - - 3,000 men, 8 guns. Kossama - - 1,000 men. Hassana - - 1,700 men, 11 guns. Nek hi - _ _ 500 men, 3 guns. East of Nekhl-Kossama-Ll Arish line there seems to have been no change. Small posts of a few men each. io These figures mark a general withdrawal of the enemy from his advanced posts, and his retirement has been encouraged by small attacks from the Canal defences. 1 7th May. The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division entered Bayud and Mageibra, causing the enemy force to withdraw, destroying the Bayud camp, and capturing 31 camels and a great quantity of Turkish ammunition. 18th May. LI Arish was bombarded from the sea and the air. 32nd May. The enemy camps parallel to the Canal were attacked by aeroplanes. The headquarters at Bir Maza were bombed, the waterworks at Rodh Salem were damaged, and some buildings at El Hamma were blown up. On the 23rd May, the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division reconnoitred Hod el Gedaidia and Bir-el-Abd. Hostile patrols were met, and a Turk was made prisoner, but little fighting took place and there were no British casualties. On the 31st May troops from the same Division assaulted, and carried the enemy’s post at Bir Salmana at dawn. The enemy retired from the camp in disorder, leaving behind them 15 dead and two prisoners. At 8 a.in. aeroplanes took up the pursuit and inflicted further losses. Despite these successes it must be remembered that the Katia action on 23rd April, where the Turks took some 500 British prisoners, is the most important one that has yet taken place on Egyptian territory to the east of the Canal, of which the Turks still occupy roughly Kp 00 square miles. The Beersheba Railway is said to have reached the Sinai frontier. SYRIA. Jemal Pasha is now fanatically pro-German. The people of Lebanon are now being systematicalW exterminated by starvation. A.grave economic situation-will be caused in Syria by the recent action of the Government in requisitioning the new harvest. THE RUSSIANS AND THE KURDS. Enquiries.have recently been made with regard to the relations between the Kurds and the Russians during the recent Caucasian operations. Owing to disquieting rumours which were having serious effects upon the Sherif of Mecca and others, the War Office on 23rd May thought it advisable to inform the Grand Duke through Colonel Marsh that British women and children from Baghdad were in Mosul, in order that no harm might befall them in the event of a Russian occupation of the town. In answer to this and other communications reports have been received to the following effect. • The Russian Government has taken punitive measures in some places against the Kurds, owing to the menace to Russian posts and garrisons occasioned by Kurdish treachery ; Sujbulak and the region between Diadin and Bayazid are instances. The Russian troops employed for such purposes have been Cossacks and other regiments composed chiefly of Armenians under the command of Armenian generals of the regular Russian army, notably Nazirbekof, Teremen, and Chernozubof, whose compatriots were massacred by the Kurds. Punitive measures are justified, witness the latest information available, which says that Kurds have been attacking Russian columns on the Serdesht-Rowanduz front under the green flag of the Jehad.

In any case, it looks as if Great Britain would be bound to help him, if need arose, against the Sherif of Mecca, so long as the latter is (nominally) an Ottoman subject; and also against any other tribes which acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty, xhe differences between this Treaty and those made previously with Gulf Chiefs lies in the geographical position of Ibn Baud’s dominions. he has relations not only with Eastern Arabia, but with Western; and a treaty with him involves this country in much more complicated and wide reaching obligations thah previous treaties in Arabia did.®W *inoe 1909, whet; the. ftr&amp;ba its the Gtfcwwn real lend IJmfc their nationality *&amp;» to obtain no adequate reoo^ •nition under too Constitution raid tiie 'ftirkiah Go»®n»i«iit «ould romia as alien and opproasiTo m before, tfeero has boon a ipwiag anti-i’urkiati and rerolution&amp;ry atorwaoni throu.|a»ut ih# &gt;jr, i U speak- •ing proviaoos.

He is capable of doing so unless Ibn irnshid gets in alien support. His loathing of the lurks and his determination to get rid rw fof them are almost obsessions with him, and are the sole reason of his leaning towards us. If we ceased to be useful to him in ihi» respect, there can be little doubt that he would throw us over• He has a Teuton!* contempt for written treaties, proved by his failure to keep his word with the Turks according to the Treaty of Koweit 1912^ and by his own frank avowal of his attitude towards such things. Our own lack of discernment seems to have driven him into the Treaty of Koweit, It seems now clear beyond doubt that liakki Pasha*s motives in his visit to London in 1913, when he made us leave ibn iaud alone, were not as generous aad unselfish as we thought at the time, Ibn baud lost faith in us and turned of necessity to the hated Turks, When war broke out Ibn baud sat on the fence. Captain Shake spear brou lit him back to oufc side; but when Captain Shake spear was killed in a skirmish, Ibn baud behaved badly md toHBHBi f ■ ' l 'Y' : S V i ^ created an impression that he was unreliable. his chief characteristic is his pride in the Feisal Dynasty, hence his hatred of the Turkish domination. To his people he ie nuite a hero; though, probably, no or^niser and no tactician, he is gallant for an Arab. At the same time he lost a considerable amount of prestige by his recent failures to punis^i ibn Hashid and suppress the Ajman tribe. The Unfavourable rumours that constantly come through about Ibn baud are explicable perhaps on the following grounds:- There ore only three lines of co &gt; tunication with Kejd, i.e. thrAu/#i hatif, Hasa, or howeit. Koweit was for many years till recently under the rule of the late Lubarak who died in November 1915. This old roan was Ibn % baud's chief adviser until he became too dictatorial. Ibn baud wto thew his indspsitdenee and poser concluded the Treaty of i.oweit behind Hub&lt;ira&gt;/ ? back. The old wan was affronted in cor sequence and fro-** that tiwe till his death last hovewber it was his ooliey to crab Ibn Seed. The avenues of information throng Hasa and Katif again meet in Bahrein. The innabitants of all thro© places are, in part at least, Bhiahs, or ^hiahitred Uamathians, whose ancestors were severely chastened by the fahabi Puritans. Ibn Baud is the present heriditary chnmpion of Wahabism; hence the malice and cunning of the Bahrein people are vented upon him, and news of him is liable to be tainted ©n route. /a-AIM S C D H Marly in February a new report was received of &amp; German having reached Ain oudr, 2b tsilee h.h.A of Suet, with four minee.

It appears that the military demonstration made from the Sheikh Otbman defences outside Aden on 13tj&gt; January took place to relieve pressure on Arabs on the Fadhli coast who are under treaty with the British. The Turks had induced the inland Arabs to threaten the friendly tribes. In the middle of January a political representative went to discover the Fadhli Sultan's policy; but he was found to have left for Labej to confer with the Turkisit leader. The Sultan,by name Hussein Ibn itamed haa had a chequered career 13^ ,1. He is now an old nan ot 7b; he was deposed by the Bombay Govern- -merit for political misconduct and his son succeeded him. His son gave Aden much trouble and when he died, about 1910, Hussein Ibn Banted was reinstated. His grandson, ruling in Abyan, was recently reported to be dealing with the Turks; but Sultan Hussein is said to have imprisoned him. In this case he is doubtless playing the game of other Arab chiefs, who realise the importance of being on the winning side, and consequently are at present keeping in touch with both theJEDDAH . It la reported that railway comunic&amp;tion exists between Medina and Jeddah, but a competent authority points out that this is almost incredible. The continuation of the Hejac Hailway to *»• South of Medina presents great engineering difficulties, and could not even be attempted without m agreement with the Herb tribesmen; an agreement which all recent information shows to be far from existing or having existed for the past year*u W K ^ 7 K H it DISKH’f There is uncertainty as to whether the Germane have or have not been landing supplies for the Senussi in the nei^ibourhood of Solium* humours from Italian sources have been plentiful* but on February 7th the Vice Mmiral reported that the position of our patrols* the state of the weather* and the dates motioned tended to discredit these reports* Since then the rumours have been growing. One submarine is reported to have landed arms and ammunition at Haraisa* about 20 mil** ft. of Uollta on 14th February. litre* days later an Italian official report states that three submarines landed arms at area Moreaa ( presumably the same place) . Whether these two reports are variations of the same story it is impoj/asible toaay• it is at least certain that the ruitours lately has# been becoming more persistent, despite the doubt thrown upon them. Though Tripolitan Arabs were still joining the Senussi, some Egyptian Arabs were them. At the beginning of February the plan for the reoccupation of Solium was that about 4,000 men should follow the line of the coast from iafcruh moving through in close co-operation with naval support The recent figit near Barani, reported at first as a small encounter # turns out to have been in reality a decisive success* Kuri Bey ( brother of Inver ), who was in command f was killed; Gaafar^his chief subordinate was wounded and made a prisoner. The enemy^s losses were far greater than ours, and Barani was occupied without opposition at midday on February 26. 'The enemy had a strong position, and it was carried with a determin* •ation and courage that must have demoralised him completely* ! i a% Details are still lacking ^because the telegraph line between Matruh and Barrani has not yet been restored; but it is certain that we hate several prisoners of importance 9 in addition to much booty. The victory must have made the way to Solium infinitely easier § and its value can hardly be overestimated. m The pure Turkish element is 9 it is to be hoped 9 now knocked out in Uie Western Deserts .ith regard to the l&gt;enu88i himself conflicting accounts are to hand. He is said, on the one hand, on 'fairly good authority' to have been on 29th February at Dakhl&amp;Jwith 3,000 men,including 12 Turkish officers^according to an unconfirmed rumour] intending to go on to Kharga presumably with a view to threatening the Kile Valley between F&amp;youm and Assuan^and^to start a persecution1 ■ of the wealthy Copts who live on the Kile banks. ineray pressure on trie wopta r.'i^.t easily incite the 1 o si etna and cause the cry of •Moslem versus Christian* which it is desirable at all costs to avoid. /kgain.a messenger, according to an official report of 1 i&amp;aroh. stated that “the Qakhla force' h«d gjns. On the other hand, in another official report of 1 March he is said to be still at Siwa with hie 3,000 Arabs, only 'intending to go through Dakhla to i Siwa is at the very least a fortni^its march from D&amp;khla so the discrepancy is a serious one. either there are two forces (and there is evidence that Tripolitan Arabs have been reaching oiwa in considerable numbers) or one of the reports is entirely wrong.&amp; A H A B I A . jha aherif »f f-n?n. A letter from the aherif of Mecca dated the I6th February marks a very important step in the Arab movement against the lijrks particularly as it .as written before the fall of Brserum. In the letter the Sherif stated that negotiations .ere complete and that he .as ready for action, which, unless unfor- seen circumstances intervened, would proceed on the following lines. One of his sons who is in Syria awaiting the arrival of the Ottoman army will try either to persuade the Arabs to oppose the I'urka, or to attack the ‘furbish army later when it approaches the Canal. Ali, his eldest son, is being despatched with a iiej&amp;z Arab force to Medina to help his brother in Syria and to occupy the railway. /2 It will b® remembered that ali was reported, at the end of last year, to have gone towards Medina at the head of an Arab force with orders to take forcible action, if necessary against Ohalib Pasha, the Pasha of Uejas. This would seem another venture in the same direction. This action of the Sherif, however, will not mature without considerable help from us. . He requires an immediate advance of -,50,U0U for expenses, chiefly in connection with his troops. He needs also fixed quantities of rice, flour, barley, coffee, and sugar, 5,000 modem rifles with the requisite ammunition, and 1,100 boxes of ammunition for his present rifles. He wants the tounitiono and supplies stored temporarily at i ort Soudan, since he has an adequate amount of both for the present. In connection with his demands 30,000 still remains of the ,00,000 previously sanctioned, and therefore only . 20,000 morelsno* required. 'i’h# cost of the supplies asked for will bo £10,000 and the Sherif has promised to furnish accounts of his expenditure. a request for £3,000 has been made by ^bdulla, the Oherif's second son, * the power behind the throne I** driving force which will carry the Serif’s venture to rtccees will necessarily come from the more civilised centres of Islam, in Syria and Western Arabia. his hope of an ar&amp;b Aspire which will unite in himself the spiritual and temporal power now exercised by the Sultan of Turkey and present an united front to the world is impossible of roalisation. hut he should be%r ’ r ~ ' 1 ’ 1BK BAUD, IS Id I K OF KKJD. Ibn Baud has racently given information as to hie relations with the furies and with Ibn Kashid during the past year. (hi June 15th 1915 &amp; treaty was concluded between Ibn Baud and ^ ibn hashid; the latter gave a written undertaking that he would have no further dealings with the lurks and that he would support Ibn Baud in any alliance he mi#t make. Their respective spheres were defined, the harb and Ateibah tribes being allotted to Ibn Baud. Soon after this a mission from tJiwer laaha reached Hail carrying gifts and the offer of the title of i ^sha for ibn Kashid. In July Ibn Baud was approached by letter from the mission but he j would not grant the mieeion an interriew. and sent the letter with unfavourable co^flents t»o I&amp;n M&amp;ehid* Ibn Kashid. a faithlees irresponsible youth, then broke his n treaty, and, seising the chance of Ibn Band's absence m tiaea ; ! «attacked U&amp;sim. ibn baud said that Ibn haahid was repulsed with less. Ibn baud said that in his opinion the lar^e mmn of money spent by Turkey in bribing the Arabs would not hate any serious effect. There is no doubt, he said on another occasion, that the Turks are making the most of the suspension of our advance to Bagdad in order to incite tribal and religious feeling against u»; but th&amp;t, as far as Irak is concerned, all unrest “ill subside as soon as we advance again. In February he was iignorant of the whereabouts ot Ion ..ishid he knew that he had moved from hail but whether to the Fast or the West h. was uncertain. He had sent hie brother to Qasim, a vulnerable point; he himself was proceeding to ttiyas to counter- -act the influence of Turkish emissaries among his tribe^en. he believed that Ibn Hashid would not gp far either towardsKoweit or ftasiriyih, for fear lest Ibn timd should cut in against hail. The prevalent tall talk would disappear if we advance' and the scarcity of rain and pasturage vould in any event make the advance of a large force impossible. he expected overtures from Ibn Mashid t and said that he would accept a reconciliation on condition that ibn Rashid either came over to us or agreed to remain absolutely neutral. if Ihn Rashid refused to accept either alternative^he vould both attack him himself and incite the Anateh to do so too. ite regarde active co-operation with us he said that he cpuld move up to hove it and Zubair but not toward, hasiriyeh. as th. graving and watering place, on that route were out of hi. triha sphere, and hie passage would arouse hostility. He said. however, that we could make use of hamud Ibn duweit, paramountchief of Urn Baffir tribe, who was ho ©tile to l\m Haehid and would hold the deeert on the imsiriyah side. Of the Sherif of llecca he said that he was a trivial and unstable character; their relations, however, ^ere friendly, there was no truth in the former rumours that the aherif’s son had moved towards hail with a large force to co-operate with Ibn ll&amp;shid and he did not credit recent reports of an active under- -.tanding betwe.n the iiherif and Ibn Baahid. The movement of the Serif's son towards Qasim was a speculation on the part oi the Sherif, who, hearing of Ibn .iaad's trouble with the njman, had sent hie eon on the chance that he mi^t be able to fish in the troubled waters. The -on. however, finding Ibn baud victor^, abandoned any hostile intentions, and merely punished a section of the Ateiba who had refused to pay tribute. /VIbn baud's prejudices against the Hherif are net unnatural« The Sharif's one sign of ambition was given in 1910 when he marched to |asia nominally to assert the rights of the Ateibah tribe, but in reality to take it from Ibn Baud and make it again dependent on ttejas. Ibn tiashid failed to support him and he retired, saving his face by making certain stipulations as, for example, that the &lt;iasim towns should pay a yearly subsidy of £4,000. Throu^iout the whole incident he posed as the close ally and representative of the Ottoman Government. The reference to the expedition of the Sherii's son must refer to the mission of abdullah in March 1915, when he went to Ibn Gaud with a large escort to collect arrears from .asim wnd Gedeir, and to negotiate peace between Ibn baud and Ibn Haahid. He was successful in his mission.Sh«i questioned about the Caliphate I bn sftjd eaid that none A of the -rab chiefs cared who was Caliph. Ko-one would gain any prestige or control over M other chiefs from the title of Caliph, because the tribes were too independent. lie believed that he voiced the general view; but it must be remembered that the bigoted puritanical Wahabi am of which Ibn baud is the official head does not represent Islam in Arabia, further, as has been shown in a previous report, Ibn baud is too far from the Turkish sphere of activity, too unpopular in hejaz ( owing to the memory of the bahabi invasion 100 years ago ) and too much harassed by the proximity of Jebel bhammar to be a decisive force. similarly Ibn Hashid is surrounded by bitter enemies. If Nejd and Jebsl Sharamar are neutral to one another and to hecca, the therif will need nothing more of them for the fulfilment of his aims.m ZT?: A K &amp; B I A . Multan of Kowoit c Jabir Ibn Mubarak, Lilian of Kowoit, was intenrioved recently; be succeeded to the title last December. his fatiier wae a $ood ruler, in treaty relations with us, and Jabir has asked for a continuance of our protection. he said that Ibn h&amp;shid was still in the neighbourhood of hail, and that if any movement took place he would hear of it immediately. i'he iiultan said he had, turned the Ajman out of Koweit in obedience to Ibn baud's request. ihe Ajswa were, however. completely broken and worn out for several months* a heir total strenf^th was about 2„000 with 2UU armed men.. * -nem&amp;mFms&amp;r tie, like Ibn Send, evinced an entire lack of interest in the possible formation of an Arab Caliphate. /AFrom another interview with the Idriei previoj.8 infomation confirmed. a mission from iiiver f&amp;aha approached him just before the war; Uat he had, he said, lost faith in furkieh promises.

The 1,000 rifles which he requires from Jibuti he is giving to the tribesmen of Hijal hi bn who inhabit his -orthern limit. The Idrisi said that he was negotiating with the tribe men of the hejran Province also. The hejran Province is inhabited by the Jemi tribes, who are of the 1 snailia persuasion, very hostile to the Imam Yahya at present, and universally feared for their savagery, and always ready to follow the biggest bribe.In I90t&gt; they helped bn* imaro; but suffered a severe defeat, which allowed the iurkB to occupy hanaa; in 1912 they changed sides and fou^it XM for the Idrisi against him.i,,C lnm 8 ® ema ^ ^ lea,t tractable of all the chiefs whoa the Sherif has approached, particularly when his old family friend- **hip with the »^herif is taken into account* he is at present not doing anything definite, but the Idrisi's at vte-H nts ih t hr. is secretly helping the lurks are undoubtedly true. his final policy will be determined by the course of the war.ii U 3 &amp; I ft 1 B ft ii A M ft D # Ualtan of the Fadhli. *%%&gt; the time of the last report there was some anxiety as to the attitude of the dultan who in January had gone to Lahej to confer with the Turks, It was reported later that the Turks had won him over* They were said to have offered him 200 acres of the cultivated land of the ikiltan of Lahej. Mo doubt the Pasha will use this land as a bait for other chiefs. The Fadhli tribes cm muster 0,000 fitting men, and thou^i the dultan has little influence over tnem, his defection mi^it have caused unrest. On the 10th February however he was report- -ed to have returned, and he is now in correspondence with Aden, Like others, he is presumably sitting on the fence and awaiting developments.Q £ N £ fi A L Hecently the Germane have been very active in their attempts to influence public opinion in Persia and have achieved a consider* •able degree of success owing to their lavish expenditure, the &lt;7 . ♦ fickle and excitive character of the Persians,always on the look out for * something new ', and the absence of any organised counter propaganda. Frobenius ( who was allowed to visit iiejas in 1915 by the Ottoman Government, under the guard of Mukhtar Bey, controller of the hejas Railway ) and Oppenheim have probably a similar cowniss- •ion in Gyria and western Arabia. If they succeed in their object the danger of a solidarity of iioslem opinion against us - from which the failure of the Jehad of 1914 appeared for a moment to have saved us - mi^t recur, thou# it is very improbable.

There was during the first week in February a considerable force at Siva under bohamfaed Saleh, with Omar Megawil as his second in command; according to one account it was 4,000 strong; according to another it included in it about 340 Siwa Muhafsia, 400 Western I uhafsia, presumably Tripolitan Arabs, and 40 coast* •guardsmen. 1 ohammed Saleh and the doast guard officers were however, said to be so dirty and dispirited as to be almost unrecognisable• During the weeki^oo '^en wiUs ca .rl b went to Farafra to moot a supply train. From another source it is a ascertained that 20 camel a laden with 1 auser rifles and six gansre tched Jarafra on 9th February, so presumably the expedition from Siva succeeded in its Quest. On 6 February the force was still at Siva; the Siva road to and including Gara was clear. a day or two later a considerable force was moved from Siwa to Gara. On 8th February a large camp, four large guns, four smaller gins and ten machine guns, were reported at Gara. Mohammed &amp;&amp;leh was expected to take command shortly, and so great was his prestige that the choice of advancing to Baharia or to Farafra. lay entirely with him. This, if true, casts doubt upon the previous assertion of his demoralisation. Mohammed Saleh seems on his arrival to have decided upon **aharia, perhaps in order to join up with another force which was expected there from liufra about the same date*\ % And also probably becauso there ia a great scarcity of food at Dakhla, while at Baharia dates, at least, are plentiful. On 11th February rumours of a large force at Baharia were confirmed by aerial recorm&amp;isance• It v&amp;a stated that an adrance upon Minia was contemplated. _ s On 22nd February another reconnaisance detected far fever sigia of enemy activity. It is suggested that the enemy has concealed hia forees in the palm groves, or that he has withdrawn them to Biva or Farafra. On 29th February an enemy force was reported at Jakhla on fairly reliable authority; an uncertain source gave its numbers as 3,000 with 12 Turkish officers. The Berms si himself was said to be with this body, but he was at Biwa all the time, a fortni^its march away. The existence of the force at Dakhla has been since confirmed.mm y It is said to haro ©ins, and raids on the Nils Valley are ezpeeted; Government officials from the Kharga oasis have been recalled. Whether this force is the same as or includes the body reported at jftur&amp;fra under ^ohamroed S&amp;leh in the middle of February remains obscure.^ li T H K COAST iteporis continue to come in of enemy submarines bringing supplies to the coast. The rumour that Dema and Tobruk are sources of supply to the benussi has been proved untrue of Tobruk # and unconfirmed of Dema. It is confirmed however that at the end of January a ship flying British colours reached Solium, hoisted a Turkish flag, and landed four Turkish officers. m M -gig . df On 6th February it is reported that a German submarine brou^it 200 bags of rice to Bagbag; and that two officers, a German and a Turk, landed and received a deputation of the Aulad Ali Beduin, who threatened to desert to the British if the promised supplies did not arrive. 2rThe Beduin in 'gypt have been coneietently ill treated by the tiuhafsia. | ' £ ihe Aul.ad ali Bedouin continue to desert us, and some 4,000 have already come into the camping ground which we have allotted to them near iiammam. Fear of starvation and a growing distrust of German promises should ensure an increasing number of desertions. It was reported from Barani on March 7th that the 4ulad Ali wished to surrender with arms if guaranteed protection from the Beduins, A suitable reply was sent. It is established that Bayed Ahmed left hurl's force early in February, after upraiding them for their lack of discipline, and vent to J&amp;rabub with his students and blacks. he has advised the Egyptian Bedouin to expel the Western Arabs. It appears that the discipline of Nur^s force, which ve1 &gt; routed near Bar an i on 2oth February, had been very bad. The Senussi had sent S&amp;yed Hillal to Nuri to endeavour to instil discipline, but disagreements seem to have resulted; and Bayed hillal left early in February to join Bayed iihraed. It would seem that Turkish influence in the Western Desert is rapidly becoming negligible* A letter was received recently from the Benussi* His attitude is now far less truculent. But before any proposals are entertained he will have to hand over all his prisoners and remove all armed uhafzia from Egyptian territory.TH£ SKNUasi. 4 delicafe© situation has arissn in connsotion with our relations with him. The Italians dsaire us to plodfgs ourselves to carry on hostilities against him till they have re-established their position in Cyrenaica, which will perhaps not be achieved for several years. If we give the Italian Government any reason to suppose that we man to make separate terms with the Uenussi behind Italy*s back - which will enable him to act against Italy with- -out fear of attack from us # it roi^it consider itself entitled to make a separate peace with the Central Powers* It is clear that we cannot undertake to continue hostilities against the Senussi indefinitely. The solution sugr^sted is^ that we should inform the Italian Government that, while actuated by the best of intentions towards Italy, we cannot engage to prosecute hostilities indefinitely against the Benussi; but that we will, before we consider any proposals from him for a definite peace, exchange views with the Italian Government. iiny terms mads with the benussi must be conditional on their maintaining good relations with Italy.Miscellaneous Information* considerable progress has been made on the railway South of Beersheba recently* For six miles the railway is being used for traffic. On Ilth February the permanent way was ready for rails from railhead to ti/adi irtaba; there was a blank space for two miles; then an embankment almost to asluj* Some camps at Beersheba had been struck* and new camps had appeared at asluj and Khal&amp;sa; presumably these were only changes in the ouarters of the men working on the lines* On 20th February railhead was reported to have reached 2 iiles bouth of imfcwj* Though Uriere are large stores of grain at Damascus* great distress is reported still from the Syrian coast* and in the Lebanon*ihe Armans are said to have eetabliahed a munition factory in the Lebanon early in the year. Provisions at Aleppo have been scarce. 4 new road is being made from Jaffa to Hishon Le 2 iion t a Jewish colony near Jaffa. From a source of uncertain value it appears that the Hoalla and Amur iirabs who failed the Turks recently escaped to fadraor; a force sent out by the Vali of byria failed to find them. ATTACK OK KOYFT, The latest information substantiates the opinion that an attack on hgypt is most unlikely, and that frak is the present &gt; objective of the available German and Turkish forces. According to a report from Constantinople of 23rd February, the value 6 f which is not stated, the attack on the Cues Canal has been postponed indefinitely. The reasons given in this latest report are three; the new hussian menace, disagreement asto the divisions of spoil, and quarrels over the composition of the forces, A report from a Smyrna a^ent, dated January 26, is to the same effect * At Ul ® a superior Turkish officer pronounced an Egyptian Expedition all bluff, and stated that it had been • . .. • • • - postponed to the end of 1916, The troops concentrated at Kechan in December 1915 were ostensibly for Kgypt, under the I command of Von der Dolts Pasha. But the 150,000 which left Keohan during the month must, if the information above,be correct, have been destined for Mesopotamia, Many other rumours hare confirmed the belief that Kgypt is safe for the present, mte recently, however, there seemed to have been some form of concentration at Ml arieh. It has been reported, on uncert- •sin authority, that there are 6,000 troops there, and that twouerman battalions are at tl Auja. The former statement was confirmed by aerial reconnaissance on 7th Marsh which reported increased numbers of enemy troops in both the hi Katia and the * fe • ' ^ £1 Arish regions. ihe i renoh havy has sunk four steamers carrying petroleum and stores off the byrian coast. Armed men were on board, and the Teasels were in all probability destined for i£l Arish. a concentration of Turkish camelry and oaralry at Libni, 85 miles h of 1 atnai 1 ia is being watched. On 6 th larch hekhl was successfully bombed, and a serious fire was seen to break out.'4;' SINAI. The news from Sinai is confined to the results of air reconn- -aissanee. The new road from Hassana to Rodh Salem has proved to be nothing but a dirt road with a rammed surface, and without foundation. It has been recently washed away in places. ft At Hassgna four oblong houses are being built, one of them seemingly a store* The reservoir has a fair depth of water. There were and men visible; the men were obviously workmen, for the most part ; and of them few seemed to be Sinai Beduin* tSYRIA Such items of information as come through from Syria all tend to show that the situation is satisfactory. ?qqd SUPPLY. The food supply is uneven, and in certain parts great distress prevails. The Canal expedition was done on the camels of the peasants of Eastern Syria; Nuri Shalan, it will be remem** ■bered, failed the Turks by sending 1,000 yearlings to Damascus, yearlings being useless for transport* The E,Syrian camels, used to wet ground and ddily drinks, died of mange in large numbers, and the Syrians have now no means of distributing their food* Corn is cheap in the interior, but at famine prices on the Coast. In Beirut particularly great distress prevails, and the ordinary commodities of life cost from double to six times their normal price. !«POSITION OF TURKS n Ihe Turks seem to be having continual trouble with the Arabs, They are making efforts to deal with the shortage of food, by allowing the Army ; on the one hand, not more than ten per cent of all local corn in bulk; on the other hand, by ordering payment at fixed prices for any extra that is wanted; and by putting aside certain wagons for the transport of food stuffs for local consumption. It is announced that this local relief will 7 hold good even during the transport of the Egyptian expedition^whenever it may take place; but severe penalties are to be exacted from any who fail to provide their contribution to the army. It is clear that Syria in general is on the side of the Allies* From a source of uncertain value it is learned that Jemal Pasha had a quarrel with German officers during last month, andthat, although reputed to be a self-seeker,^is really% more friendly to the Allies than to Germany. The same inform- -ant states that the Syrians and Arabians throughout the whole of Syisia are opposed to the Turks / and would welcome a landing by the Allies at any point on the coast. Germans, too, are in every way out of sympathy with the people, he said, and native GETnv ottv opposition has ruined many Qfcnaisft commercial undertakings* Four noted Arab Nationalists were recently arrested at Medain Salih; two were condemned to death, two to three years 1 imprisonment* MILITARY NEWS. It seems that the antagonism between the Germans and the Turks, due to the reluctance of the Germans to provide adequate troops for the Egyptian expedition, increases* The Turkish ministers desire a decisive blow at Egypt at the earliest possible moment; they suspect the Germans of wishing merely togain a firm holci of Constaii'binopl©j and th© liirkish. attitude is a proof of the absolute necessity of German help before the idea of the expedition can materialize. Other news of military interest has been received:- BEIRUT . The number of troops there is reported to be not quite 2 t Q00* There are several German officers. A telephone service has been established from Beirut along the coast to Tripoli* ALEPPO . There is typhus in Aleppo; it started among the soldiers at Raju and spread in December to Aleppo where it has attacked chiefly the Mohammedan quarters. ROADS and RAILWAY . Air reconnaisance has revealed additional ' facts in connection with the Beersheba Railway* Round Beersheba, a.t the end of January, there were camps sufficient for10,000 Eaen # A track was not laid on the embankment running S. of Beersheba towards Asluj, but the existence of the li^it construction railway alongside, mentioned in previous reports, was confirmed. Rails have been laid on a deviation to the South, but not on the main embankment* The bridge at Abu Irgeig is still unfit for use, and the stone arched bridge over the Wadi Saba is not completed* Some new bridges are reported, at El Kheimeh and Tell El Nejeiieh, The bridge at Beersheba is progressing but it will probably not be fit for traffic for three or four months. It seems that in consequence the work on the embankment to the S. is not being pushed at present. £WESTERN DESERT , More details have come to hand which throw an interesting light on the present position of the Senussi forces. other commodities were arriving from Egypt, the shortage of food at Butunis was very severe. The Arabs were depressed, the daily rations being hardly enough to keep them going. There has, however, been so much rain that the Senussi army is well supplied with water; roughly speaking, all the cisterns S. of Matruh are full to a distance of 60 miles. This has allowed a withdrawal of considerable forces from the coast-line between Solium imnL There seems in this area too to be a great shortage of food, and great dissension among the enemy. At the end of January, although sugar, tea, tobacco and Matruh, 7■■■■■■Mi It is establisned that the Aulad All tribe’s discontent has oeen due to the fact that their recruits in the Senussi force have been consistently put in the forefront of any fight; this fact, combined with lack of food, ill-treatment, .and their dis- -like of the Western Arabs (who are mostly Berbers, a different race) has caused the Egyptian Beduin to endeavour to escape further trouble. Two Sheikhs, who were notoriously fighting for the Senussi, recently reached Has El Husan with their follow- -ing, all unarmed; they intend to tempmm further East, having announced that they do not mean to fight any more; others previously hostile to us have been coming to Matruh and asking leave to proceed quietly eastwards; the camping grounds given to those Beduin who have not joined the enemy are filling up satisfactorily.Sayed Ahmed has been making strenuous efforts to cope with the situation. Arms ammunition and provisions were landed on January 23 by a steamer W. of Matruh, and were taken S. immediately by camels. A few days previously hundreds of camels had left El Abiar for Bomba to transport supplies expected by sea. About the same time a messenger from Sayed Ahmed reached Sayed Idris asking for reinforcements, but the tribes were indisposed to comply with the request, probably owing to the sowing season and to the failure of Egyptian operations. A little later^ January 21^an agent found a very large force, at Siwa, the numbers of which are not given, ready for immediate advance^probably upon Fayum ar Assiut. Sayed Bida was in command, and it was reckoned that the march' ' 42 between Baharein to Farafra would take twenty days. A week later however a reliable agent reported that this force was still in Siwa, awaiting the arrival of Mohammed Effendi Saleh to take command; he was not expected till the I8th February, and it was believed that then the column would advance either via the Baharia or the Moghara Oasis, Again,however, the plans seem to have changed. An agent who was in Siwa on I February found 3,000 armed Tripoli- -tan Arabs there; Bayed Ahmed had forbidden Arabs from the coast to enter Siwa, and had stopped all export of food. He himself •'S i'l't had been variously reported at Solium and Siwa, but at that time he announced that he was proposing to make Siwa nis headquarters, and he was going to fortify Siwa strongly against an expected English attack. f IN mTwo large gjins and two machine guns reached Siwa on I February, Bayed Ahmed is reported to ha^e said openly that both the Turks and the Arabs had been fooled and led astray by German promise possibly lack of the expected help by sea has changed his whole scheme, It is established that Bayed Hillal has taken command of the forces in the Solium district with Gaafar Pasha, Early in this month the Solium army occupied three posts; first, Samalus 800 - 900 tents at Bir Jorbi, east of Bir Adwan; secondly, El Sarathat near Bir El Mella, with 1,000 tents; thirdly, El Qataan, at Bir El Thalatha, with 1,000 tents* The El Hanani tribe were also at the Qataan post. More recent reports conflict with expectations. Reliable information was received of the presence onI February of a Senussi force 1,400 strong at Bir El Mella, Witn it were Bayed Ahmed, Gaafar, and Mohaaamed Saleh, and they expected to remain there till reinforcements arrived by sea. This further news combined with the results of aeroplane reconn- -aisance to u-ara which detected no signs of enemy movements make the projected advance from Siwa appear doubtful. The existence of a camp at Bir El Ghanawiyat is confirmed,* most of the forces engaged at Butunis on January 23rd retired there.An interesting official interview with Idriai has come to hand this week. Though not a very powerful ally, nor, in some ways, a very desirable one, he is useful to us at present as cutting off the Yemen Turks from communication with the North. It must always be remembered that he is an upstart in Arabia; that his religious pretension is African and not Arabian; and that he has not always pursued a very straightforward policy. From the interview, which took place at Jezan on 6th ' January, the following information was gained* First that the Idrisi is much influenced by his Wazir, Mohammed Bin Yahya Ba Sahi, who has in some spheres, such as maritime and shipping matters, undisputed control* He is ar w wealthy man, working lor his own ends, but his removal is not feasible* Ba Sahi welcomed the guests, Idrisi being apparently afraid lest a personal display of friendship might arouse relig- -ious ill-feeling, and perhaps cause him to lose caste* Secondly, the fact that Idrisi’s portsalone have been opened to trade from Aden, Djibouti, Massawa, and Asab, has much enhanced his prestige in the eyes of the Arab world. He wished his area of coastal trade slightly extended* He desired to allow corn to come down the coast from Jeddah, because hisour representative that no supplies were sent through his country to the Turks. Thirdly, his animus against the Turks seemed great and genuine; he expressed his confidence in the victory of the Allies. Many deserters from the enemy were in Jezan, and he seemed to have been very active in fyijd conciliating the tribesmen. Fourthly, with regard to his neighbours. He stated that bribery would bring the powerful tribes of Hashid Bakil solidly against the Turks; that, though an old enemy of the Imam of Yemen, he would possibly meet him half -way in a reconciliation. With regard to the Sherif of Mecca he affected ignorance, saying that he was afraid of finding him on the side of the Turks, but that, if he were convinced of the contrary, he would join forces with him.(jSP I He was anxious about the Senussi, with whom he is closely connected; he said that he had heard that they were hostile to the British, and that he was surprised. With regard to the military situation, he was undoubtedly playing a waiting game. He had neither guns nor rifles sufficient to take and hold Loheia. He mistrusted the Imam, thinking that the Imam would attack him when weak from an advance on Loheia, if he undertook it* His work was at the time mostly diplomatic. He realized doubtless that he must be on the winning side. Broadly speaking the Idrisi ! s attitude was one ®f cordial welcome; he was frankly determined to get favourable terms for his people’s food supply, which makes the closing of Jeddah undesirable. A strict Trade Policy was submitted tohim which indulged his interests while safeguarding ours; and he approved of all the clauses, which were discussed seriatim. It seems advisable, in view of the fact that so many Arabs are hostile to the Turks, not to insist too closely on stopping all extra commodities, excluding of course such imports as kerosine; because probably only a small portion would reach the Turks, and the Arabs might easily be estranged if we took too severe a line; in which^severity would prove rather a curse to us than a blessing at so critical a time.ARABIAN REPORT . Week ending February 16. ARABIA. page. I. MESOPOTAMIA. * 14. WESTERN DESERT. ' 17. SYRIA. '22. SINAI. '28.EnBHHHHHBHSiaHi ( 0 / A C '' O A S I A The information which has come throu^i during the last week confirms previous rumours; and throws fresh lis£t on the attitude of the Sherif of Mecca, It is now certain that a considerable force left Mecca for Medina under Ali Bey, the Sherifs eldest son, prepared to take forcible action if necessary against Ghalib Pasha, the Vali. The departure of the force was the cause of a great demonstration in Mecca. A later report states that Feisal, the Sherif's third son, is now at Medina, with orders to stop any camels or supplies from reaching the Turks. The Vali is still at Taif; I he retired there a short time agp with his troops, and built a fort. There is evidence that the Turks believe the Sherif to bein league with the British. In Turkish circles in Mecca there is a desire to stop all communication between the Hejaz and the Sudan, but none would dare to make the attempt f Another instance is given; the Turkish secret police in Mecca recently discovered the arrival of Mohawaed Ibn Arif Areifan, the Harb Sheikh, who has been the Sherif’s go-between with the War Office, Cairo. They demanded his arrest but the Sherif hid him; the Turks seemingly accepted the situation, and made no further efforts to capture him. Recently the Sherif has made no attempt to disguise his opinions, and the impunity with which he acts is a striking proof of the feebleness authority. It is said that papers have been posted on the gate at the tiaram praising the generosity of the Knglish Government inallowing food to be sent to the Hejas; that the placarding of anti-British news in the public places of Mecca is forbidden; and that the Sherif has refused to preach a Jehad. * V' ■ ' *' '■ ‘ “ *' ' ' •- • ' •- • ^ . It has been stated in earlier reports that he has for the last six months or more been trying to persuade the Imam of Yemen and the Idrisi to bury the hatchet, and unite with him against the Turk. From a trustworthy official source it is now learned that his influence is being felt further afield, and that his present aim is to reconcile all the Arab powers in Arabia by persuading them to abandon all side issues, and assist him in hinting the Turks from the country. YEMEN . There is an old friendship between the families of theSherif, at Mecca, and of the Imam, at Khanir and Sana. In 1912 the Sherif secured the treaty between the Turks and the Imam, who desired reconciliation with them because of his fear of the Idrisi. Now the pendulum has swung, and the Sherif is attempting to reconcile the Imam with the Idrisi against the Turk. Recently, when the Turks attacked Men, the Sherif advised the Imam to abstain; and more recently he dissuaded him from enrolling the tribes of the Aden Hinterland under the Zaidi flag. A S I R . Till about nine months ago Idrisi and the Sherif had been for a long time on terms of bitter hostility. Since then negotiations have produced a better feeling. The Sherif haspersuaded Idrisi to abandon his futile attacks on Yemen, for these, thouf^i in the name of an anti-Turk crusade, resulted in the plundering of the border tribes. The bherif, it seems clear, wishes eventually to turn the energies of the Asir tribe northwards against the Surkish garrison of Kxmfida and Ibha, if his present programme holds good. HUD. There is a trace between the Wahabi power and the Sherif; but if Ibn Baud become! strong enou^i to cause the Sherif any. apprehension, trouble would doubtless break out* Ibn Baud cannot help the Sherif in hunting the Turks out of Arabia, for sewered reasons; Yemen is too far away, Jebel Shammar wouldI \ sfei 4 not accept Wahabi fitting men as Allies; the Sherif would not allow them into Hejas t because their Biisdeeds a^inst the Holy Places of Islam a century ago hare not been forgotten. The Wahabi Sect is a form of extreme puritaniam, fanatically destructive, in strong contrast to the tolerant, rather comfort- •able, Islam of Mecca and Damascus. J E B S L SHAMMAH. Though not entirely successful with Ibn Hashid, the Sherif has done much in our interest. Though he has not restrained the Emir from making raids into Nejd during Ibn Baud's absence in the Kasa, his son Abdullah succeeded in defeating the counsels of the Turkophil advisers at Hail As a result Ibn Hashid found several of his supportersopposed to common action with the Turks; a split ensued, and several Ateiba Eheikhs left Hail and returned in Abdullah's train to Mecca* ihe Sherif is in touch with the Mullah, and has pressed on him the same counsel of inactivity, pending, direotione how he may best act in conformity with the general lines of Arab policy, It must be remembered that the Sherif only works in the British interests in so far as they further his own political aims. Me wishes to establish another hhalifate, and gun the independence of the Arabic speaking peoples. He is opposed therefore to the Pan-Islamic Party, and is seeking the disruptior of the Ottoman Empire. His policy consequently coincides with our inmediate aims, since we too desire that disruption. SOMALILANDHe obviously has in mind the hope of eventually superseding the Turkish power in Hejaz by himself; his support of us is only a means to this end; and, thiu^i genuinely devoted to our interesi interests at present, it is clear that the weight of the forces in Arabia waiting at his disposal will be thrown eventually on the aide which is most likely to give him what he wants* But his ultimate aims, too, are incidentally ours. For us the threat of Islam will have ceased to exist if Islam can be divided against itself; the inauguration of a Khalifa in Arabia, challenging the Khalifa in Turkey, will be the best possible safeguard for us in the future, particularly if the inauguration be a violent one. To summarise, the position is at present satisfactory; we have enlisted the sympathy of the Sherif; and there is anil ' fill —ii Qg) c) • N ’ ' V - - &lt; l H &gt; .&lt;/ striking absence of any indication of the anti-British move- -ment among the Arabs which it has long been the aim of German propoganda to promote* But there are still two factors in the situation as yet undecided, which will be of primary importance in determining the course of events. ■ First, Mesopotamia; it must be clearly recognised that it is intimately connected with Arabia and that, unless assurances of our recognition of this are given, we may lose the co-operat* -ion of the Arab party. Secondly, France; her relations with Arabia are a matter of great moment. The Arabs have a deep antipathy towards the French administration of any portion of Arab territory, but the French do not realise this. The solution is fraught with dangers on both sides; if the French insist on administering-* for er frank ajid im^ediale explaRaiier}- yliole »ituation-W i¥anoo would seem-to be lhg~besl wajf ouvof the-djrffioulty !*■ Arab territory^ we shall probably lose the support of the Arab party; if they do not realise their error, and encounter un« -expected Arab opposition, they will think that we have instigated that opposition* The French are quite mistaken in thinking that their advent into Arabia will be welcome; the exact opposite will be the case;4 UiTi , i 9 - (&lt; ^ Etidence of the effect of the Sheriff attitude is forthcoming in a report of January 6 th f which stated that the Imam, the * • Idriai, and Ibn El Heij were then at peace with one another. All were quiet; the Idrisi had made no real effort, despite his resources to capture Loheia or any other Turkish territory, The Tmmw had sent no contingent to help Sayed Pasha at Lahej. Sayed Pasha's Arabs were deserting, and, at the time of the report, only 500 remained with thw Turks at Lahej. Hamid Ibn El Heij is chief of the Zayala tribe; he is a pro-Turk and lives at Moadhat. Last summer he raided the Idrisi's country, but since then he has been quiet.- ■ # In connection with the recent doings of the Sherif two person- -alities deserve mention. i &gt; ■' Nasir Ibn Ali # the younger brother of the Sherif, who has been living in Constantinople is generally believed to be on bad terms with his brother, and to have been exiled from Hejaz # In reality, however, he is his brother’s secret agent, and handles the theological party in Constantinople at will in favour of the ruling house of Mecca. The Sherif’s real danger is Ali Haidar, the nephew of the # dismissed Grand Sherif Ali. He is supported by the Turks in ' his ambition to succeed the Sherif in Hejaz; some years ago he tried to capture the headship of the fanatical wing of the pan- .Arabs, representing the Sherif as lax and unworthy. The Turks have sworn that he shall succeed the Sherif as soon as thelatter can be removed. Several isolated facta of interest are reported this week: The Turks have stopped all war news from entering Mecca. On 1st February there were four Turkish Divisions in Arabia. The 21st was in Asir; the 22nd in Hejaz; the 39th and 40th in Yemen. There were, previous to the war, about 750,000 camels in Arabia, of which about 45,000 were exported each year. The export ceased at the Turkish mobilisation, so that there must now be a great many for sale.• -—•- .... ,«?■ ■ ... Itm / ' : '/ k&amp;J ^SOPOTAMIA. ihe latest news tends to confirm the belief that . esopotamia is likely to be the seat of big operations in the near future. _Si From further evidence it appears that Von Der Goltz a arrived in Baghdad on 10th December;and, more recently, reliabli information has been received to the effect that the Germans are in favour of a campaign in Mesopotamia rather in Egypt. A great deal depends upon the attitude of the Mesopotamian Arabs which is not pronounced in either direction at present. Some of the local sheikhs are friendly, some are hostile. The attacks on the British column which retreated recently to r Nasiriyeh show that, th4u$i the balannce may be favourable to us &amp;r ^ a reverse or the appearance of a reverse mi^it turn the scale, and put most of the Sheikhs against us. The Arab is essentially unstable. General Aylmer has entrenched himself 20 miles from Kut the Tigris. The Russian troops of Ramadan are only ten days march from Kut; and, in spite of the mountainous nature of the country, and the fitting to be done en route, they confidently expect to join the British forces before spring, and thus block the way to Southern Persia. The Turks, on the other side, are making strenuous efforts to guard against this. The route from Constantinople to Baghdad has been improved. Recently some troops arrived in 40 days, 31 being spent in actual travelling. The passenger traffic on the Asia minor railways has been stopped;—uW IQ half-trained Turks are being rushed to Angora and Baghdad to stop the Russian advance. Six t possibly seven, Turkish divisions are now in this area* one having recently arrived from the Dardanelles. The force opposing General Aylmer has, in particular been ■~~ - mi—i ' ; A Pi 7 WESTEfiK DESERT, According to the neve received recently the eituation in the Western Desert seems more satisfactory. From deserters it has been ascertained that the Senussi suffered very heavy loss on the 23rd,, The Russian rifles which they recently received have proved defective. That the Egyptian Beduin with the Senussi are deserting and returning East. Further it is officially reported that there is no truth in the rumour that in an engagement at Qfedabia the Italians lost men and gins. BUTUKIS. At the end of January Sayed Aimed, Nuri, Gaafar, Sayed Harun, and Bey Gabril and about 20 Turkish officers were at Butunis* A The Turks and Bey Gabril were on bad terms with Sayed Ahmed. A AUL/VD The rumour of a quarrel between JmnMI Ali and the Western Arabs; is confirmed* At Butunis supplies and transport were plentiful, and there were six big 0 ins, six mountain guns, and about five i machine guns. The general opinion at Butunie amongst the rank and file is that no attempt to attack Egypt proper will be made for some i- time, but that it is possible that an attack on Babaa will be made soon prior to another attempt on Matruh. From two sources it is confirmed that Turkish gold and silver is plentiful between Solium and Butunis* Both with the Senussi army, however, and with the local Beduin food is very scarce, and the Senussi's rations cannot last more than a month. This scarcity is confirmed from several sources* There is a persistent rumour that the Grand Senussi hasordered the Aulad Ali Arabs with him to hand in their rifles % because he has lost all confidence in their fitting powers. SQfcLb'M, At Solium considerable activity has been reported. First that on 26th January there were 4,000 armed men in . sead and uollum. Next tint, about the same time.Abd El Salon Abu Scata and five or six German officials appeared there and marine. Also tknfc, a few days later, 800 Muhafsia arrived.

These ships may be the same as are referred to just above, but there is no evidence connecting the two reports. The following miscellaneous information has also come to hand:* A second attempt, hs unsuccessful as the first, was recently made to blow up the line between Abd El Rahman and El Alamein. The enemy camp at Harumam has decreased much in size. A largf number of rifles were recently landed at Port Bardia and are stored in ten magazines at Bir Gfarassa. They tap* are said to be Russian and they were being distributed ti those of the Muhafzia and Arabs who had Greek rifles. There were also said to be as many as 20,000 sacks of rice and barley at Bir Garassa awaiting distribution. It is said that two Germans recently reached El Abiar, and that Sayed Idrisi was expected toUTirnm——1 1 ■iiiir I inn -1 ^ arrive there for a meeting with the chiefs and with Sayed Rida on February I # Various movements of troops are reported, * On 5th January a column left Siwa and moved N.E, to El Qara, destined possibly for El Mo^iara, On I2th January another column moved from Siwa in an Easterly direction. There is also a force at El Khor t where the water-supply is exceptionally good.SYRIA and EGYPT. A tangle of conflicting evidence has come to hand this week in connection with the advance against Egypt. First, as to its probability. From a Greek source,of uncertain value, it is reported that the Egyptian Expedition is massing at Adana; that 15 or 20 Austrian and German officers pass Turkish troops is very good as a result of the evacuation of Gallipoli; that the Turks can send 150,000 men; and that Pasha has about 60,000 men in Syria, the remnants of the expedition which returned from the Canal last year. But the report closes on another note : everybody; it says, is agreed that no offensive against Egypt will be undertaken unless the Germans provide effective help.At Beeraheba again, on January I 9 th, an agent reports that . • town-criers were sent about to inform the Arabs that they and all their possessions must be cleared away from the vicinity of all roads now being prepared for the advance of the forces on Bgypt. They were told that three armies were coming, a Turkish, a German, and another of unknown nationality. The soldiers of the last would eat all their animals, dogs, horses and camels, and would rape all their women; therefore they should be given a wide berth. An announcement of this kind may be mere terrorization (as the last clause suggests) made with a view to influencing the Arabs at a time when they are leaning towards the Allies’ side. But it is worth mentioning as a link in the chain of evidence.Secondly, as to the improbability of an advance on Egypt, A reliable source states that Von Jagow informed the Budget « Conmittee that, under existing conditions there can be no talk of a serious expedition to Egypt owing to the absence of a double railway line through Syria, It will only be possible to make a strategical demonstration in the vicinity of the Suez Canal, A later report states that the Germans have refused Pasha’s appeals for help for the expedition. The blatant announcements in Turkish and Geramn circles in Constantinople that the expedition against Egypt has alreadt commenced, with appropriate details to prove it, seems to bear no relation what- -soever to the truth. Further, reliable information has been received to the effectthat the German authorities have decide^ in favour of the campaigns in Albania and Mesopotamia rather than of action against Balonica and Kgypb, To turn to material evidence:• It must be borne in mind that the obtaining of news from Syria is Transit at present with very great difficulties; newcomers are instantly arrested; the only method available is the use of small craft, which piok up information from regular places of call along the coast; agents cannot get throu^i Sinai into Syria, and the other way, i # e* through Constantinople,is very slow and diubtful. There are people inside Syria to give the news; the difficulty is to get it out* what news is obtained is necessar* -ily disjointed and scrappy. i The following are the facts of salient interest reported during the last week:-At Aleppo f which has become the key to all troop movements, being at the point where the Syrian and Mesopotamia^ railways bifurcate, three Turkish divisions are now reported, on uncertain authority. The arrival of German officers was noted last week. The railway between Haraleh and Tul-Keram has been re connoitred by hydroplane. Normal activity was reported, and many piles of stores were seen, notably at Tul-Kerara. This accumulation is probably due to the fact that the floods have broken the railway N. of Beersheba. At Jerusalem there are not many troops, but the Turks are trying to create the impression that it is occupied by large forces. An uncertain report states that the Syrian railway was on; 't 30th January being used for important troop movements S.W. and . that passenger traffic had been suspended* It has been reported by refugees that two new roads of great importance were constructed at the end of last year:- (A)* Safed - Jauneh - Damascus , with a new telegraph line along the whole line of the road* The basalt country over which it passes provides excellent material for metalling the surface, and as a result transport can pass from Damascus to Beersheba* (B). Semakh - Tiberias - Jauneh * J£iHAt The same report states that Mflemwl Pasha was the one great power in Syria at the time; he was usually accompanied by i German officers. Desertions were frequent owing to the hard- -ships and shortage of food which prevailed* Palestine was friendly to the Allies* it v &gt;aMMMM BM MIMM' i WM 1 ill *' SINAI . . / /■ From the Sinai Peninsula a considerable amount of information has come in. Hoada 1r With regard to the roads t the scheme seems to be as follows:* (A). From Auja to near Hassana, with a branch perhaps to unite Arish and Kossaima. (B)« From Hassana 9 which is becoming an advanced base, on several lines radiating W. and S,W. The ultimate directions are not yet clear; they may be. I. Hassana - Wadi rodh Salem - Jifjaffa - Serapeum, 2. Hassana - Theraada • Mitla Pass * Kubri. 3. Hassana - Theraada * giddi - Geneffe.I Certain facts are reported concerning the activity of the enemy w on these roads:- From Hassana west to the head of Wadi Letheili the road has been finished for some time* From Wadi Letheili to Wadi Hodh Salem the rosd was being made in sections, some finished, some, at the end of January, not begin. West of Wadi Rodh Salem very ■ ;/ ■ ' _ little work, far less than early in £he month, was being done. The men seem to have been sent to work elsewhere on the rail- -way near Beersheba* The roads from Mekhl to Kossairaa and hassana arc only camel tracks, and are not being prepared for motor traffic. Motor traffic was using the road West of Anja as far as Abu Aweigla at the end of last month*‘ 1 / ■ ^ Uwav. With regard to the railway. Considerable activity has been noted in different places^ Floods have done extensive damage to the embankment South of Beersheba. To the Korth too a bridge has been broken at Abu Irgeig. Workmen have been recalled from the various roads to work on the embankment near Beersheba. It is conjectured that, after allowances are made for the bridging ef the Wadi Saba and for further damage by flood, the . railway should reach Auja by March or April, and Hassana by July or August of this year. foa-w irnona. With regard to the dispositions and numbers of enemy troops in the region it is hard to get information wnicn disting uishes between workmen and soldiers. 1 M I !JBMW ■■ i -ti-jsms*'-:- *‘7 ?? ^ ^tch evidence as there is points to about one battalion at Nekhi t one at Kossaima # one at Hassana, one at Arish, with about three at Auja. There is about a division distributed over the smaller garrisons; and another division appears to be encamped at Beersheba, which forms the main base* The increased camps at Beersheba are accounted for partly by the extra work being done on the railway; for, as was said above, men have been temp- -orarily withdrawn from work in ether quarters* It is suggested that guns and men reported on the Palestine Railway possibly formed part of a third division which has been arrested on its way down* .iRfcfir Surmlv. With regard to the water eupply. Recently there has been heavy rain in the North; much more rain has fallen North of Gebel Maghara than fell last year. But in the neighbourhood ofSS’ ' ’ Bir El Giddi there is a shortage. In this region the German surveying party mentioned last week has been working. The sites of new wells were selected near Katia; an underground store is also being built there. Five or six new wells have been dug jefefctf at Bir Gererat. Miscellaneous.
