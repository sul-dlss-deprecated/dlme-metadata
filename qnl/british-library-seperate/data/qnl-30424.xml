The first is a request to the Colonial Office from a firm of leather merchants for permission for two Arab skin selectors, nominally Turkish subjects, to proceed from Aden to Nigeria. The correspondence records that the Political Resident, Aden was authorised to issue the necessary passports. The second issue concerns the loss of a passport by one of six skin selectors, who also went from Aden to Nigeria, and who had been employed by a Mr G Schaerer of Messrs Max Klein of Aden. Minutes show that the former was a Swiss citizen, that the firm was American, and that the Political Resident, Aden was satisfied with the legitimacy of both.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><subject><topic>Passports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Leather industry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100037366739.0x000002#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100037366739.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
