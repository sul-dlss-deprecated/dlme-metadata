Matrah from the East* ThanKs to t he Kindness of certain persons in Matrah, the writer was given the opportunity of apending a few days, early last June, in the wadi Samayil. He has written these notes, not because he can speuK with any authority concerning the district, after so short a stay, but because he is aware of only a little recorded of this interesting region; and, hence, the information, however meagre, may have at least a certain value for those who are concerned with the affairs of the Uman. The Wadi Sanayil was visited in 1835 and 1836 by Lieutenants Wellcstead and whitelock of the Indian aavy, and in 1838 by tne booanists, Monsieur Aucner Kloy. Colonel b.B. Miles visited Nakhal in 1876. perhaps he also visited tne wadi bamayil* Several years ago, the Reverend Mr. Pennings, the present head of the American Mission at Bahrein, went there; and Lr. Harrison, of the same Mission, spent a few montns in the neighbourhood in 191b. There were followed last winter by ur.i&gt;uim. mt.Irow Dr. J P.Popence was tnere studying date culture in 1912; and a report | of nis investigations is available in tne Hul.Calif•Conan.Hort. for Jan. 1914. The writer is Indebted to the Kindness of nr. W.H. Lowson for the information tnat Hr. Pilgrim, if the Geological Uurvey of India, visited the wadi bamayil, “under conditions of considerable personal risK,'* while traversing Uman in 1905, and &gt;« that an account of his findings has been published in the Mein.Oeo.Sur. Ind. ,Vol.XXXIV, Part 4.

On 26/&lt; do. do. do. the wind is N.W., and On 18^ do. do. do. do. b.K. The Average Annual Relative Humidity is 3# greter than that of Basrah, and 6% less than that of Bahrein. In Basrah, however, the maximum humidity occurs in winter, in Maskat, intfuinmer. The high relative humidity combined with the high temperature make the climate of aiaskat, in the eummer» exceptionally unpleasant. The unpleasantness is agravated by the high night temper: tures, to wnich the influence of the bare, rocky hills, almost encircling the town, contrinutes* PLATifiS II AND III. Maskat from the Past. bornetimes, in the twenty-four hour period, there is a difference of only two or three degrees between the maximum and minimum temperatures. If the name of tne country of Iraq really be derived from ASt&amp;iA — 'he sweated**, then ^afckat might weil be renamed Irraq, from aR 1U(4A —'be sweated greatly.' Outside Maskat the climate is less trying in summer, though the air is always damp along tne coast. Inland, the air is dryer and less enervating. The climate of the Uabal .Ochdhar is such that, while vines and pomegranites grow to perfection, yet it is too cold for date palms. These mountains are within fifty miles of the coast. It is said that fcaskat nay be cold in winter with a biting wind. It is interesting, in view of the present discussion as to tne suitability or otherwise of the climate of the Imperial Volley in California for the growth of date palms, that the great humidity of the air of the batanah in no way interferes with the proper ripening of the date crop there. ®f the batanah be as damp as Maskat, and tnere is no reason to suppose it any less so, the average humidity for the month of August rises to 00$. The trouble with the Imperial Valley as a date growing district is, therefore, not one of excessive humidity, probably, there, the limiting factor is the cold night temperature, or the cold night temperature comhtned with a high humidity. During all tne time of the visit, the visibility was low on the coast, and less so Inland. Clouds were seen most days, and mist was common in the mornings, un the afternoon of the 9th of June, a cloud no bigger than man’s hand appeared in the western aky. by sunset, half the sky was covered with red clouds. At dawn, tne following day, the cloud had crept down the mountain* as a thick, wnlte, wet mist, and had envelpped dhallah, where it was not possible to see a hundred feet. Prom tne above table, it will be seen that most of the rain falls in winter. One-fifth of an inch, however, fAIls in the period, June to August, isormally, this rainfall does no damage; but. If it be excessive, it may ruin the date crop. This occurred in 1874 and in 1878, and in other years. t&gt;one years, there is no rainfall. Por the past nine ye:!rs, Mnfckat and Oman have been suffering from a drought, UAHAL, with the accent on the first syllable, fanny springs have diminished their output or have dried up; and large numbers of date palms have died. There has been much distr^es; the price of corn has risen greatly; and there has been emigration to Zanzibar and other places.

That is probably why he has forgotten all the little he ever knew, ue never more regretted such forgetful ness than amongst tne Oman hills; for there are only two adequate ways of describing the country, uhilds noland^ and a geologist's. There are rocks of every shade from white to black, of many k.nds of red, blue, green, und yellow. There are igneous rocks and alluvial rocks, shell rocks, shales, and conglomerates of e/er&gt; description, une greenion rock, excessively soapy to one touch, ru s as broad veins widely through the others, klints basalts, and limestones of many kinds from crumbly stones to mar le litter the wadi bee o. A curious formation noticed many tines is tnat of a heap of greyish rock composed of uneven blocks, each block made up of a great number of fine add separating laninae. The resemblance of each block to a great, partially burnt book is so strong, that each of these masses look li&amp;e nothing so much as a burnt law library. hr. M.H.Lowson was kind enough to provide the followiry extract from l)r. PUgrim^s report.'In the bed of the wadi (i.e.tho bamayil), is an abundance of hard conglomerate, contoining pebbles of limestone and of serpentine*. Mr. Lowson very kindly identified one oi the rounded pebbles, which litter the wadi bed, and which presumfcbly have been washed out of the conglomerate at the side. He states it to be a piece of^Massive crystalline limestone, with a little quarts and iron oxide as impurities. M .he Anglo—i ersian Oil Company .Limited have permission to make a geological survey of the territory of the bultan of JAaskat, and have made already a preliminary survey; but, as fiar as is known, no concession of any sort has b^ on gr;inted by the Imam of liman for a similar survey on his territory. An unusually active onaikh, acknowledging tne latter’s suzerainty, by nr.me Sulaiman al harini, is stated, on good autnority, xx tocoliect stones from tne various valieys he visits. What he does with them is not known; but it is commonly supposed that he tests them lor the precious metals. As this shaikh has visited Europe, it seems at lease posi:ibie that he nay be interested in oil equally with the precious metals; and it would be interesting to know whether he submits his specimens for examination by an expert, and if so, who the latter may be. Wo alkali land was seen in the interior; but the whole coast where it is not rocky, is somewhat so. bhero irrigation is practiced, however, that is, in the date gardens, the salt is washed down, and does not harm the crops.C01.«ilU«ICATI r &lt; N» MaeJcat ie cut off from communication with the interior by its girdle of mountaino.

Lecp sea vessels collect the cargo there for distant ports. Nowadays, the boats of the B.1.3.n.Company call .weekly at most of the Persian Lull ports; and Maskat is the collecting station only for the Uman; whereas, formerly, a large part of the PersiLin ttulf trade was transshipped at Maskat. PLATE VJII. One of the B.I.S.E.Company’s Boats, the b.S.Chakla Arrian, 2nd century, mentions Maskat. The Portugese captured it in 1508, and remained there about 150 years. The foundations of the present fortifications are said to be Portugese. It may be mentioned that, to this day, the word PAERI is understood, but not ^Af&gt;S. PLATE IX. The Matrah Gate, J»askat. PLATE X. The jhcw Hoad as it x.eaveo Maskat. PLATE XI. The nev/ Ho H ^pproacning aalbu. The first automobile ever aeon in the uman was landed at Matrah on the 14th of June; tnough a motor bicycle has been in the latter town for some time. PLATE XII. Matrah from the East. From what was seen of the present coast road, and from inquiries made, it would appear that no difficulties would be encountered in making a motor road from *aatrah to the end of the date palms at buhar. Most of the road would need nothing whatever doing to it. A motor road from bib up the Wadi bamayil would present no engineering difficulty; but stones would have to be removed from the track, some gradients would have to be improved, and sharp bends rounded. An extension of the road to the Gabal Akhdhar, making possible week-ends in the cool, would make kaskat almost an attractive residential spot. PLATE XIIIPLATE XIII, The Coast *&amp; B.E. of Maskat. The usual means of transport along the coast Is hy boat. The particular type of boat most used Is the BADAH, a light rowing, or sailing, boat, made mostly at Burp With keel at bow and stern out of water, with a long, pointed, overhanging prow, and a high stern post. The deck is composed of palm fronds. About twelve men row; but power is wasted by their habit of pulling inwards towards the boat, instead of at right angles to its long axis. PLATE Xr r . Mr.trah from the sea. These boats take passengers at a KIAL each, from Bib to rflatrah, and vice versa, as a rule, tne journies begin after sundown and end at sunrise. The departure and arrival is announced by the blowing of a conch, KyjJJI. The j^ourney is enlivened by part and chorus songs and chants by the negro crew singularly pleasing in effect in the star-spangled night. To sitj or lie, at ecu's in the stern of a BADAU is far more rest -ful than to .journey by camel or by donkey. Though one may start out fat as tne dragoman in Kothen, if he has much of th: last two kinds of transport, he returns like a toest-rack, as the late Mr. K.J•J.Mackenzie would have said. Dugouts, made on the Malabar coast, are extensively used for fishing and for carrying passengers. PLATE *V. Dugouts in maskat Harbor. PLATE XVT. Boys Diving for PAX in ^ask&amp;t Harbor. Dor the transport of produce from the interior, camels and donkies are used. Horses and mules ere not seen, a donkey load of di^tes, about 2oo lb. is token from the bamayil gardens to Matron for a HIAL. PLATE XVII. Donkey hoys near Dhaliah.. Travelling in uman, if the Wadi Bamayil last June be typical, is unexpectedly safe. Although all the world goes armed, mostly with old Martini and curved dagger, yet no one challenges the other, when figures appear on the horizon, no cartridge is slipped into the breech, so is done imparts of ’disarmed* Iraq. It was said that, a few years ago, before the tine of the present Imsim, Muhammad, when the Imam Balira was the ruler, travelling was far from safe. However, Dr.Harrison noted the cUbn of the state; and Palgrave, in 1863, also mentions how, though every man bore arms, the dagger and usually a targe, YALAB, and a javelin, HAMAH, yet highway robbery was almost unknown. Leather targes are/ now for sale in Matrah market, brt as curios, hot for use. Women and boys with leaded donkies travel alone and in salety.

The flowers are non-fragrant, yellow pom-poms, of tne familiar wattle type, ine legumes are spirally coiled, as in aedlca^o .lhe seeds are small, xhe wood is hard, and can be used in carpentry; but is actually used chiefly for firewood. A gum exudes from tne trunk in small quantities; but it was said tnat the gum chiefly eatported from matran was obtained from another tree (tne QARAT ?) This tree is perhaps tne commonest most constant and most characteristic feature of the Wadi Samayil wild vegetation. In tne bed of the wadi^ in some places, It forms minature forests. &gt;fiven on tne summits of trie driest looking, rocky hills, some IS UMAR tree often can be found, crouching to tne grounf from tne wind, doats, upright as baturs, with tnelr fore quarters well entangled four feet up in overnangmg SimAR brandies, are a common and a curious sigat.

It was probably this bush, which caused Alexander’s beast of burden, which ate of it, during the terrible march thru Makran 'to aie of epilepsy accompanied with foaming at the mouth.' LIPxAH, the word understood from the Atslantic to the Pusht-i-huh, is here unknown. Datura ,probably stramonium ,.uAJtA.KHAM, is to be found more or less wild in gardens. Its stupifying and poisonous nature is known. The colocynth, HAEDEAL, its promise of sweet refreshment as delusive as the snow on the Island of Burmuz, is to be found. The natives know of its purgative qualities, though do not appear to|use it in thair pharmacopoeia. PLATS XXIII. SIBAR on tight, SHARISB on left. A zizynhus , probably Snina-Christi , was fairly common but commoner in the Batanah, the wood is good xelkx.A mong other uses, it is employed as spindles in the water hoist wheels. SARAH is another tree, with very reduced leaves, some what after the style of a oarkinsonia . Of the additional trees, which were fo^nd at^Sib , the .most remarkable was Kidhah, which surely must have oeen Dracaena draco . Though the waiter has met this tree_before but once, the memory of the avenue at Alger, bordered with this extraordinarily dishotomous^y branching monocot is too vivid to permit of mistake. It was said that no dragon’s blood was collected; but that a perfume for the head of woman was made from the flowers. MAAvYARAH, also found at Sib, 'was a bright green, leafless, tree of tangled phylioclades* a phylanthus ? A common bush, growing wild in the hedges between the gardens of the Batanah, was SHAHAR. The large, hairy leaves are a light, sage green, the flowers star-like, mauve and white, and the broken stem exudes a white sap, like an euphorbia. On the more or less salt plain of the BataDah, HIRXL flourished. This low-growing, stinking, salt bush looks like a suaeda, perhaps S. monoica .FAUNA AnimaIs T ihrice renard, H *SAINI, was started^ and^ turning wnisicexed mask, uefore he made off, pleasantly suggested green coverts, iea.fy lanes, and home. ?wo bu#k, three doe, and one faun gazelle were seen difierent times, hounding over the black, rock country near idiaudh, surety the most lightsome things that breathe.

Dolphins are common along the coast; and may be seen often from the*shore as the puay. Birds . The hooded Crow, ffilURAB, was seen inland, but was very much Essaorax more common iii the Batanah.

Often one may be seen peacefully sitting picking insects off the back of a cow ofc bull, providing a charming instance of affectionate, though temporary, symbiosis. The house sparrows in Maskat impress the new arrival as being more brightly or more definitely colored than their brethren of the Iraq. The local name is ZAMZUR. In the Iraq, a sparrow is ZARZUR, though the latter name is given in the dictionary as 'Starling'. Crested larks were common everywhere on the hills and plains. In the Batanah, a bird, which looked like a nuthai- hatch was frequently seen, and also a bird, 'which looked j.ike a w - '* shrike. BABU was a common bird, of the Batanah. It resemblec ^ but was not the same as, the bulbul, BILBIL, of the Iraq. Wrens were seen in the Batanah, aiso warblers, perhaps reed warblers. Wheatears were seen in the dry widyan. A bee eater (Persian ?) called KHADHAIDHARU a name similar t© tne Ira^qiL'liADHAIRI, and both naturally referring to the birds colour, was commoner in the Batanah'than inuand. . The Oxford and Cambridge Bird, or roller was everywhere plentiful. It is called locally Dhadhu; in tne Iraq Shagarak. Ouly one or two kites were seen, wheeling over the town harbour of Maskat. A black and white vulture, (the Bgyptian ?) RAAHAM Pl.RAKHAM was seen folitary or in pairs on several occasions all over the country. Cormorants, which are such a feature of Bahrein, were seen nowhere along the coast.Whereas the common gulls at Basrah are white, or white with grey bacics, or white with b^Dck heads, no white ones were noticed at Muscat, The common gull there is of a smoky brown colour. A small dove HAMAMwas common. So were sand grouse, GATA. A francolin was heard calling in the Batanah. Reptiles. The shell of a turtle, GHAIIMAH, was found on the beech at Sib. One snake was seen, and one empty skin found, about two feet long. Small lizards abounded everywhere, ana one large one, two feet long, was seen impalled on a jBizyphus tree. Frogs were hardly to be found in the wadi, and oni rarely in the Batanah. / Fish . The streams of the W&amp;di gardens were full of small fish, their existence abounded at one end, presumable, ^y the springs from fchich the streams have their source, and, at the other, by the last garden, where the final drop of water is expended in irrigation. According to Major Cheesman, Dr. Jayakar sent specimens of small fresh water fish from Maskat, which were identified at the British Museum as Cyorinodon dispan Presumably, these were from hot springs. In the water from the hot spring at Misfah at Aliyah, no fish were noticed. The limpid,blue sea, along tne Maskat Coast, abounds , in fish}, and fish catching and curing are prominent coastal industries; for the dwellers in this tract, and their cattle too, nowadays deserve the title f ichthyophagi T no less than in Strabo’s day. Alexander Hamilton appears to have been fortunate enough to see fish come and be caught in the net, on the crying out to them of tne fisherman, TAAi^I (i.e. Some, come'.); but the writer fccfe did not have such good fortune, Y/hat was a curious and characteristic feature of the fishing in Masqat harbour was the practice of vigoxrously rattling a piece of wood against the stern sheets of the boat, as this floated over the space left between the two ends of the nearly complete circle of net. Presumably, the idea is to frighten the fish, which happen to be within the net’s circle, into its meshes* At all times of the day, one would hear tms insistent clatter. The shark called YARYTJ, though xA.USAG is understood, the SHIR BAHAR of the Indian export merchants, is common. It is said that sharks do not penetrate into Masqat harbour, but that, just outside, they are common. There is an export of dried, small fish, called commonly in English, sardines. Shoals of these fish can be seen •rippling the still v/aternear the chore. A fish resembling a sting ray was noticea in a fisherman’s boa.t. It was returned to the water. Insects. Perhaps the most noticeable insect of most tropical and sub-tropical places is the house fly. It was curious to observe m June how few of these there were in Maskat, and Matrah, and in the interior ana the Batanah, It is possible that contributary causes of this scarcity in Maskat are the absence of beasts of burden, and the habit of the population of using the tide-washed beach for their mornigg toilet. But these facts do not explain the comparative absence of flies in the interior, or even away from the sea, in the squalid suburbs of Maskat itself. In the Iraq,however, far from human habitation one may travel, flies are to be found. It may oe said that they are brought with one. But this x is not so, for,for, if all tuose aooux one oe collected in a net ana cnloroformed and one continue waixing, m a nundred paces, he will have as many on nis bacJc as ever oerore» ine next Insect looked for in a hot country Is the mosquito, JSA^QAn, pi, BAQ(J* Last June in uman, there were nard to find. A few non anopnellnes were seen in Maskat. In the inter ior none were seen, ana only two or three were heard altnougn no net was used to sleep beneath, in a stagnant pool of tne wadi iiaxxjci hlban, however, there was found the only mosquita breeamg place encountered in all the twelve days; and tnis contained a dew ahopneline larvae, borne of these were carefully collected, and as carefully brought to the coast, in the BADAM, the jar was over turned, and only half tne larvae were saved, inese were carried into the steamer with even greater care tnan had been bestowed on tne ori gl ial specimens. Luring trie woyage, it was noticed, one morning, that only one larvacwas left, ihe cause of fne mortality was at length discovered to be a dragon-fly larva concealed in tne algae at the bottom of tne Jar. it was removed; and elaborate attention was lavv isned on tne sole survivor, wnicn reached i^aaran safely, xhe jar was put aside to await tne formation of tne pupa. Alas, for two days the Jar was forgotten, wnen remembered, it was found tnat not nad tne larva pupated, but the pupal stage had been traversed rapidly, ana tne image nad emerged, xo tne layman, tne larva rathsr resembled tnat of a. nurse 1 .ine welter believes kajow tiill l.a.s., wno was atat oned at aasket (halt ai Xalag V) about ten years ago contributed some notes on mosquitoes and malaria eitner to tne oournai of the noyal Army medical Gorpsm ox to the Indian Jouimal oi medical nesearen; but it is so long since ne read them, ne cannot be sure wnich. it would seem certain tnat maskst is very ma larious, probably in the winter months, wnen rain would mate pools in all tne stream beds, wnicn kkxk are dry for tne rest of tne rest of tne year. Probably, the same is true for the rest of the f country, however, even so, the complete absence of mosquitoes, as tne trabeller sleepsiligntiy clad and unprotected by mosquitos net in the bed of tne Wadi hamayll is striking. une sand-fly was caught towards tne moutn of tne Wadi bamayil, and a few others were missedl but. In tne whole of tne visit, tne welter did not nave more tnan a dozen bites, it might kxk have been expected tnat tne plastered, irrigation channels would have provided ideal breeding grounds. Feasibly, tne rotation or water in tne channels prevents breeding. ine insec«t wnich brings itself most to tne notice of tne summer WsitOr to tne Wadi Samayll Is tne cicada. She noise tnis large oug makes has been likened, in otner parts of the world, to tnai o a knife-grinder, a sclssor-grinder, and even a railway whistle; but, in tne uman, wnat it is exactly like is that of a wireless mes sage being sent ofi by a gign powered sending apparatus, une caught oneself truing to read tne message, with its succession of long and snort piercing blasts above tne deeper, ground note, xnose to whom tne calling oi tne francolin is familiar will understand this description^, but it must be remembered tnat tne calling of the cicada is continuous, no one in tne valley appeated to have been made deaf by tnis noise, so it would bot be correct to describe it as daxajt deafening. It is, however, very loud; and, wnile one is passing several oi tnese insects sending out tnelr lohg distance rddio messages from a clump of SUMR trees, converaation is not possible, me insect is an inch and half long, grey and marked on the dorsal 0W b ! he com * )ound eyes are large and prominent ne probossis is half an inch long, and appressed to tne wentral surface.

What a coast for a boyI These pale crabs sit, or rather stand, n the shallow water, with their long, stalked eyes projecting into the air. Then a wave knocks them over, and they get grit into their eyes, they clean them again by means of two of their appendages. To see a crowd of these c crabs raising and lowering their eyes, one might imagine one was looking at a battalion doing arm exercises, 'Arms, above the head Raise*.' When alarmed, ana the crabs ate on the shore, they run along the sana with surprising swiftness; out in the water their progress is slow. Hermit crabs are conribon also, and are the funniest sight. Some of the shells they use are more or less rounded; but others are of more fantastic shape, with one long process and many lesser ones. Brighton beech*is uninteresting; all the shells lie inert as stones. Here, a shell, at which one might have been idly gazing, suddenly gives a jerk, like a heavy lorry getting into bottom gear, and then starts off, trailing complicated tracks behind it in the sand. It might be a soldier crawling along under an enormous pack, and with the rifle barrel pointing olrer the shoulder. vVhat do crabs eat? One was discovered browsing on a date stone. The local uame for crab is 3 BANDITS . JAMA I BAR I is not understood. The flesh is not eaten. Moluses. Cuttle fish must be common, since their bones litter the rocks near Matrah. The pearl oyster is not found close to Maskat. Some boats leave each year to join the pearl fleet; but that is in the Persian Gulf. Dome istic Animals. The camels of Uman are smaller, and daintier that those of Syria,- the Iraq, and Khuzistan. The are gazwlle colour and smell like gazelles. In fact, one feels he could easily make a pet of one; which would be difficult in the case of the northern camel. Instead of Robbing by tying the shank up to the forearm, the foreleg was seen hobbled to the kai hindleg, as though the camel had been a donkey. BAIR is not understood, ik though GAMAL is. The word uded for camel is always BAUSH. The officers of the Maskat Infantry had some horses at Bait al Palag, their barracksi and Saiyid Muhammad, the Wli of Matrah, had three at Sib. other than these, none were seen. Donkeys are the commonest transport a-hmals. They are small and grey, sometimes like the camels, almost a gazelis buff. There is none of the white, Hassawi donkeys The^valur of a donkey is anything up to 100 RIAJ*. Probably, a good one would average between 50 to 70 RIAL. HAMAR is understood, but theusual name is Masri pi. Masarah. MATTI and DIBISH ate not understood. The cattle are bery similar to the zebus of Sind. They are commonest in the Batatoah, where they are- chiefly used for hoisting water. Their rations consist of mi^t°f millet leaves, or lucerne, or a cultivated grass(Cynodon? called RASHIDIYAK, supplemented, at sundown, with a boiled mixture of fish offal, millet leaves, and unripe dates, 7HAUR is a bull. Bulls are not castrated, and some of them are savage. PLATE XXIV. Earthenware Pots containing the Bulls' cooked dinner. Sheep, CHABISH or GHAKAM, are uncommon. A few are seen with larger flocks of goats. Black is the Prevailing colour; there are no horns; the wool looks coarse and hairiike; and the general appearance is -Like that of Najdi sheep out smaller. The Umani goats a e attractive. Always goats are a attractive animals by virtue of tneir inquiring character, independence, agility, and enterprise, very noticeable along side silly sheep; but these goats, in addition to appearing to more brightly coloured than others. The herds are tiny, solemn faced, little girls, as sure-footed on their mountains as their charges, the AMAZ or MAAZ. Cats are kindly treated. Here is another point of difference with the Iraq. To see ana old man sitting under a tree, quietly stroking a cat was a small matter; but it reminded one vividly that he had travelled far from the uncivilized land of the tv/o rivers. GATTUor SAHHR is the name for cat; neither KIRD nor BAZUH are understood. A peculiar feature of the *Vadi Samayil, and of the Batanah too, is the absence of dogs. Refreshing it was anu pleasant to wander oy and thru the villages and evohe no pack of snarling, yelping curs to destroy the quiet contempuation of the loveliness of the scene. Per the Wadi Samayil was magnificiently lovely. One or two Saluki were seen. In i^atrah, on the other hand, the strip cf sandy shore, which lines the harbour, and which serves the community as Lido, Prado, Cafe de la Paix, and Cabinet d'aisances, is the haunt of a multitude of surely the wretched- est, and most filthy pack os curs the East can procuce. The keep themselves cool by sitting half in the sea.AGRIC I-xj'T The principal industry of the litoral and of the interior is date growing. ;Vherever there he water, the date palm is grown. It is the first crop to hr cultivated; the others with the possible exception of wheat and harley, follow and profit hy the palms 1 shade. Labour. Colonel Miles gives the following tribes as cultivators of dates:- 5ani Ali, hani £u Ali, Lani Lattash, A1 Rabus, Al Rajriyinat and A1 Ibriyin. More often than- not, the date gardens are tlie property of absentee landlords. In the oases, they are generally not far absent, since most of them live in ira the villages whcih form the oases centres. In winter, here also the cultivators live; though in summer they remain in the gardens. Many of the owiiers of Latanah date gardens live in Mashat of Matrah or in other of the larger coast towns. A big landlord is called KAILJUII. MALAiv is not understood, but RAI f AL MAL, is frequently spoken of. The actual cultivation, ohen not carried out by the peasant proprietor, BAREHUL, pi. BARALHIL, a word also meaning'a lazy fellow 1 , is in the hands of a paid laborer, the BIDAR, corresponding with the RAuAH of the Iraq, enjoying leas security of tenure that' that pro vided by the TAABAL tenancy of that country, or the MAURISI of the Punjab. In the Wadi Camayil, every BIBAR receives, at date harvest, one bunch of dates from each palm, irrespective of of the number of bunches borne. In the Batanah, on the other ha hand, he never receives dates, but nearly always money, sometimes, miney with food, or with food and clothes. In both districts, fruit other than dates is the exclusive property of the garden owner. There must be an immense amount of pilfering, however. Pal-^en fruit is the tenant’s right. The provision of offshoots, fruit trees, and irrigating cattle, and the food of the latter.is on the owner. Lucerne seed and that of wheat and barley are also provided by the owner, who takes four-fifths of the crop from the former and nine-tenthsof the crop of the two latter. Millet is usually grown on the same terms as lucerne but not invariably so. Truck and minor crops are sown with the tenant’s seed, and are his own property. The amount in cash which a BatanahBIDAR receives, in the cases where no flood and ex clothes are received, is about five HIA-uAT a month. This was the commonest figure given in reply to questions; but an old man at Al B-il said he got 50 RIA-u a year; and two younger fellows with him said they each got 40 RIAL. A garden, near Rumais, was looked after by a small boy and a .. oung man: the former got Rial a month, plus food, and the latter RIAnAT plus food. Radhim, a merry and well-spoken, half-negro half-Arab lad, work ing in the garden of Baiyid Muhammad, got 4 RlALA-g a month in addition to food and clothing; but he seemed to be a fovourite with the old man. Food is generally reckoned as being worth RIAL a week. If then the average wage for a Batanah BIBaR be only 60 RIA^ a year, as the other emoliments are the same as those of the Wadi Samayil, it might be supposed that o0 RIAn is the value of one bunch of dates from every palm in the average holding of a Sajnayil BIBAR. If one bunch per palm be equivalent with one-eight of the crop, the total cr©p would br wofcth, on this basis, 480 RIAL. With dates at 50 RIAxi a BAHAA, the trial production would be a little less than 10 BAKAR, or 16,320 lb. This amount of dates might be produced on 163 palms, or about three acres of garden. Actually, all the Batanah tenants appear to prefer to be paid as in the ^amayil, so it may be presumed that the rate of pay is higher there, and that the area of a Samayil holding is greater than suggested above. That this pre- sumptionis probably correct is bo&amp;rne out by other, rough ob servations, which indicate that the Samayil holding is nearer 4 or 5 acres than 3. In the Batanah, however the area is nearer 2. In the latter district, the tenant has to raise all the irrigation water from wells: In the former, the water is almostalmost entirely provided by flowing springs; and, consequently , the cultivator can manage a greater area. In a bad year, the •Samayil cultivator stands to lose. Probably here is the explana tion of the high wage rate compared with the lower, but fixed and certain, wage rate in the Batanah. Purtherm the wage rate in both districts is fixed by long custom; the drought must have caused the prices of agricultural produce, including dates, to rise. Hence, a cultivator paid in king would by likely to be, temporarily at least, setter offfhan one receiving a money wage. Cultivation and I m plements. The soil of the whole area is light sand. There is no clat, though Palgrave mentions the existence of a single bed of pottery clay near the coast not far from i~atrah. Drainage is excellent, and there is no alkali land, if the slight amount on the xiiz&amp;a surface of the sea-shore be excepted. There is nowhere a rank growth of weeds and cultivation is of the scantiest and shallowest. One who is used to and English spade smiles at the MTSKAH of the Iraq, ^e would laugh loud and long at the similarly named implement of Uman. It indeea resembles more a weed-stuober that a spade. PLATE XXV.THE MISHAH Held by a Batabah Cultivator. There is no hard clay to be turned over, no sodden, baked, iron-bound land to be broken u9, nor are any deep channels to be dug out. The chief use of the spade is to dam up the tiny, water courses, in turn, as each bed by irrigated. The plough,HISS. , FADDAH uot understood, is also absurdly small and light, and made of wood iron tipped. It is drawn by one cow or bull. If ploughing be by contract, and there be but a small piece of land to b e ploughed, containing only a few palms, the usual rate is 5 PAI a palm, the plough, plough animal, and labour being all provided by the contractor. This rate is equivalent to about a RIAn for an acre. Generally, however, if much land is to be ploughed, a bargain is struck for the whole piece. The third implement is the LiI^ASS, which is similar to the long king of MIKASHSH or MIBJAL of the Iraq; that is, it is long, only slightly curved, tootxied sickle, used in the Irac onxy for pruning palms, but, in Uman, also for cutting fodder, a.labour reserved, in the Iraq, for the smaller, nore curved MIEJAL. MIQASS is ’scissors 1 in the Iraq. A HIB, a long chisel for separating offshoots from their parents, completes the list of agricultural implements. The Tawi. In the vV'adi Samauil, the size of a man's holdin 0 is computed from the numper of palms it contains. The units of area, FI BLAH, KASHARAH, QUHAEAH, JABI3, or LAULiA-, appear unknown. In the Batanah, however, the garden unit is the TAwI, pi. TAwlAE, so called presumably in reference to the stone built well. This is the amont of date garden watered by one single or douole, watey-hoist. Three of these, at Sib, belonging to Shaikh Rashid, v/ere surveyed, with the following resuits- Bearing Offshoots Fruit Total Total Approx.

Hence the incidence of date palms might be expected to be low. On a walk from Sib towaeds Rumais, the numbers of bearing palms in various TAWIAN along the road were counted roughly. They were as foxiows:- D. Double Hoist 300 bearing palms E. Single 200 do F. do 150 do G. Double 300 do K. Single 175 do I. do 100 do J. do 4 do K. do 60 do L. do 60 do M. Double 400 do Average 135 Reckoning D,G and M as two each). Saiyid 3aifm the Wall of Sib, considered the a average number of palms in a sinle hoist TAWI as 200. But this seems an over-estimate. A figure nearer 100 would seem more likely, with the average number of acres in the TAML as two and the average spacixig eg palms 30 feet each way. The same informant considered that the irrigation of the TAWI cost the owner 100 RIAii a year, 60 for the BIDAR and 40 for the bull; but most people considered the bull as expensive as the man. Reckoning that it c sts 110 RIAn a year to water and look after 100 bearing palms, and recknning the yield per Batanak palm as 75 lb., then the cost of producing dates, without a,ny charge for supervision, interest on capital or for taxes, works out as 0.95 cents a pound. One tenth of the gross crop is supposed to be rendered as government tax. ^he net return of each Tjjalm to the grower thus becomes 67.5 lb., so the cost of producing datesm without reckoning anything for in terest on capital or for supervision, becomes 1.60 cents a pound If the average price of dates is the Batanah gardens ttz during the season be 40 RIAL a BAHAR, the price per pound is 1.4 cents,- allowing 0.34 cents between the cost and the selling price of a pound. Young, mature palms of good varieties, well bearing, cost nothing up to 100 RIAL each; so perhaps a fair average price for a TA'tfL might be 5,000 RIAL. So counting nothing for supervision, the interest on invested capitau in a Batanah date garden may be about 0.86L or 25 50L per TAWI per annum from dates. Auxilliary crops add to this return. As noted later lucerne can be profitable. Fruit bringsin something, though prices are low. llangoes at Sib were selling at 250 for a RIA-^ last June. Limes were selling at about the same price in the Wadi Samayil at the same time. The water hoist u£ed to irrigate the TA&lt;»I is of tn ordinary Arabian type. The water is about 20 feet below the ground level from A1 Hil to Ruma.is; so probably may be at this depth all along the Batanah. The vertical, supproting hoists are usually made of palm logs sawn longitudinally in two. -i-hey are strong and smooth. In other date prodicing countries the paxm logs are the worst of kx building wood, for the reason that the internal fibres are loose and tear out. io plane such a log is like trying to plane a bath lufah. ihe water is dropped from the bucket on to a masonry collecting trough, and thence ledthence led thru a subsidiary, bathing tank, into the main, storage tank. Here it remains, until the BIHAR has finished hoisting. He then unplugs a vent in the tank, and occupies himself in distribu ting the water. He is drawing water from before t e palest streak of dawn to sunrise, and from ear^y afternoon to sun-set. Perhaps he and his bull work about seven hours a day at this labcut. In all the Batanah, there must be 15,000 and more men and animals so employed, year in year out. P1ATB XXVI. A water-Hoist at Sifalah. To western ideas, the wastage of man and animal power is appalling. What, of course, is wanted is a crude oil electric power station at Khaburah to supply a high voltage line the whole strength of the Bata-ah. There might be five main reduction station and each group of fifty TAVvXAU could have a secondary reduction staticn.Each - -TAWI would have a meter, a I.H.P. motor, a rheostadt and a 1 ina.' centrifugal pump, all bailt as one unit under one cover. The BIHAR would switch on the current; the water would flow to him; all he.would have to do would be to direct the flow. Being relieved of the labour of having to raise the water, he/ could spend his time improving the cultivation of the land, and in growing cotton, ground-nuts, sesamum, and other profitable ground crops, instead of leaving the land nearly bare, as now. But, of course such a scheme will not materialise under the present reg ime. Even in the capital, haskat, a town possessing a climate considered by most visitors to be more unpleasant in summer than t that of any other town in the Rear or Par east, there are no electric lights, fans, or ice machines. However, what is feasile in the xakxxirii Batanah is the installation of either small oil engines and pumps or else mills. There is a sea breeze by day, and a land breeze by i.ight. The wells and tan s are already installed. The size of the TA//I is not too big for a wind-mill to irrigate. Y/hatever mechanical means were employed to raise the water, the stumbling block would by the capital ex penditure required. However, if some windmill firm were to estab lish itself in the Batanah, and would be patient in collecting the the instalments on its plants,probably people could be induced to b buy. Windmills are used for irrigating small area date gardens in Shaikh Utliman, near Aden, in various places in Algeria, and have been introduced recently into Bahrein and Amarah in the Iraq. How ever, farmers do not change their ways, unless compelled by econo mic pressure. And not always then. Bevertheless, if the bk bigger landlords could be brought to see that their irrigation is now costing them tentiues what it could cost tnem, they might make the change. The Argentine is buying windmills at the rate of 16,000 annually. One double water-hoist raised the level of the water in a tank, 20 feet by 24 feet, one and a ha.f inches in hald and hour. One single water-hoist may be expectea therefore to raise 375 gallons of water an hour. A half-inch, centrifugal pump, driven by a motor of one-third horsepower would raise as much.Palms are watered twice a week in the Batai.ah. Thus, in a week, each palm receives, reckoning no loss by seepage and evaporation in the channels, about 150 gallons of water. « r ere water easier to come by, the palms would probably receive more; and an increase in yield, com.arable with that of palms in the wadi bamayil, might result. The TAWI is usually fenced round with thorns and big e uphorbia !?) bushes, SrAx.AR. Sometimes, a railing is made of parrr trunks at 20 feet intervals, rather reminiscent of English split chestmut fencing. To allow a passage to pedestrians, out to k keep out cattle, as rough ga,te in the fence is often made of three cross poles and two uprights; and, once, in a bosky glade, where the acacias,(they might have been May bushes!), hid the palms, a stile was encountered.Irrigation, The water-hoist, ZIGRAH, as it is the heart, provi ding the lige blood, of the TA«I, has been described already. Throughout the Batahah, is heard the plaintive shrieking of the pullies. To a suggestion that the exiis might be oild, the reply eame that the nbisy wheel was better, AHZAIii. Major Cheesman had the same replu in HufHuf. Some of the gardens at Sib were located in the dry beds of the torrents. To provide for the rare occasions, when these are flooded, masonry dams are built across the stream beds, thru the gardens. The celocity of the water is thus diminished, and the water, instead of rushing to the sea, is held up and sinks Kfc into the ground, irrigating the land, and sugmenting the sub-soil v/ater. In the Wadi Samayil, and in the other widyan seen in the interior, with the exception of a little v/ater provided by water-hoists to the drier parts of the oases, all the irrigation water is from springs. The v/ater from these springs would axxEje fiOvV under ground, and never be seen, were it not that underground channels he.ve ^een contracted, eith gradients less than those of the wadi beds above them. At a distance from the springs, varying its depthm ad with the relative slopes of the channel and the wadi, the water is brought to the surface, At this point, the oasis begins, and continues, until.there is left no more water to irrigate the palms, •-'uch an artificial, underground, water course is called FALAG. In Morocco, such a. one is called FUGARATm in xersia, QABAT. Wells are first sunk in line, at intervals varying from ten to thirty feet;, and then the connecticns are established between them. The laoout of constru cting these channels, with a crow-bar as the onj.y implement, is considerable. The interior of the channel is cemented with a mixture of lime and plaster of Paris. Some fo the channels date from remote times probably; but new ones contini- e to be made. It may be that the channels are more numerous now than formerly; but it is more probable that the new ones do no more than take tiie place of old ones dried up or filled in. In a PA-uAG under construction at Misfah al Aliyah, a wall, about 20 feet deep, had been sunk by four men in six days. The main channel of a big spring, where it issues . from the ground, may be two feet v/ide and two fleet deep. Such channels were half full in June. Small effluents are constructed and t,j.e ultimate branches in the gardens are no more than six inches wide and four inches deep. The slpe of these smallest distrubutaries is reckoned as three fingers a hundred cubits, or rather more than I in 1000. The surface channels are constructed of the same sort of cement as those beneath the ground, that is xxxb: of a mixture of lime and plaster of x'aris. A rou^h founda tion is first made of cemented lebbles. The lime is prepared by burning the rounded, limestone' pebbles, which abound on the surface and just under the surfacr of the wadi bed and in the conglomerate of the hills. The plaster of Paris is prepared oy burning a ^eddish earth, which is widespread, aft&gt;er this has been puddled with water and dried in the sun in caxes. Such a profusion of calciam sulfat in the scxl must be particularly beneficient to agriculture, in that it neutralises t e tcxicity of much .of the harmful sh&amp;l chloride of the alkali i .eteAs. It is certainly a fact that date palms x.ever seem to do so well, as in well drained districts,where the water is plentiful, and where the soil is ruch in gypsum, given of course, the climatic conditions are suitable, In Algeria, in the hadi ^uf, ar, as the Frenchprefer to call it, the Oued Zoud, calcium sulfat and v/ater are as plentiful as in the Wadi ^amayil, anc drainage is as good; and the date palms are perhaps the only ones in the world, which approach in vigor those of the 3ama. il. Gypsum is known as SARUQ,. JUS, of. the Italian Sesso., is not understood, nor is the Persian Gach.tfater rights are inherent in the property rights. The price of a garden is alwa,; s inclusive of that amount of water to which it is entitled by custom. The customayy rotation of water to the gardens is eoLactxy ^adhered tp, ax^d disputes, which are rare, are refered to the shaikh for decision, borne gardens are watered as often as every four days, but the interval varies up to amaxiinum of eighteen days. In the gardens, which get such infrequent v^ater ings, pits are commonly dug round the palms, so that the greatest amount of water may be obtained at eacx watering, as is done injdt the drier gardens of the Algerian ^iban. LAThb Ai.X 1ATE IAlA:S. ^ histrubution and Incidence. The oases of Uman are scattered alona the oeds of the water courses. Water, as noted above,is supplied from underground channels, leading from sources, higher up in the bed of the wadi. How many oases there are in all Uman is difficult to conjecture, from the mouth of the Wadi Samayil, at Sib, as far as. and inclu ding, Hub, a distance of about 40 miles, there are about 20 oases if the big group of palms at daunayil be considered as one. The smallest ones, e.g. Miltaqah al Kadariyah, probably contain no/ more than about 800 palms: but the Samayil proup probably contaiiis over 100,000 palms; Ahaudh, Finjah, Bidbid, and Sarur prouaoly conta n something ^ike 20,000 palms eack. The remaining twelve oases may be put down, at a quess, at an average of 5,000 palms each. The total palms in the valley, as far as, and incj-udin^, Hub, therefore, may be estimated roughly as about 240,000. For purpose of comparison, it may ^e mentioned that the number of date palms, on the Iraqi pcrticn of the banx.s of the nhatt al Arah is about 'z,000,000. How many date palms there are between Hub and the Gabal Akhdhar is not xnov/n. It is probable that they are less than below Hub. But the Wadi Samayil, though it is certainly the richest in palms of any of the Uman widyan, yet it is only one of about forty such, lying between Ras Masandam and Ras al Hadd; and most of those probaoly contain some palms. It is hazardous and: to conjecture what is the total palmpjapEciatxijsHK population of Uman, excluding the coast, but 1,000,000 is a more or less intelligent guess. If the coastal region be included the number of palms might amount to 2,500,000 fordate palms u row along the Batanah in a continuous belt from Al Hil to Suhar. Only the first twelve miles of this belt, be ginning at Al Hil, were seen; but several and reliable infor: mantsstate that this portion is typical of the whole. The average width of the palm belt was generally put down at a mij.e. To allow for pardonable local pride, half a mile has been considered the width for purpose of calculation. The length of the belt of 100 miles is verifiable from the map. Thus, the conclusion appeals that the Batanah hate gardens cover 50 square miles. They conta.n probably t e third biggest palmery in the world Basrah and Tafililt being ihE bigger. In these necessarily rough calculations, the number of palms per acre is reckoned at 50. In the Wadi Samayil, the palm are so big, that,if they were closer that 30 feet e to each other the frends of xexx neighbouring palms would greatly intermingle. In the oiatanali, the palms are less vigorous; and, in the gardens wl where there are no fruit trees, they are x&amp;ss. frequently at closer intervals. However, in consideration of the xarge number of fruit trees at the southern end of the belt, of the bare clearings amongst the palms, and of the uncultivated condition of many of the TA.VIAh, 50 bearing palms per acre for the whole area is probably not too low.The date gardens of the itfadi ^amayil are reminiscent of south Morocco: the rocky, picturesque scenery, the white clo thes and li/AMAT, the plastered irrigating channels, the under?- grcund streams, and the IIAxAa ? for 'How do you do?' are common to both. And if the ^amayil be like Woroccc, then the Batanah has points of .resemblance eith the §hatt al Arab district the long, continuous strip £f palms between'water and a salty plain, and the perponderating influence of the date palm on the life of the people. But then the squeaking of the water-hoists quickly reminds one he is far from Basrah's tidal irridation. There are also pisturesque thickets of SUMAR? GHAJ?, and other trees, where palms are lost to view. One almost expects fairies to appe r. But the weather is probably too hot for them.who ever heard* of a sv/eaty fairy? Perhaps, though, there are jinu. Cultivation. On a previous page, the cultivation of a date garden has beeii Noticed, and the trapxKisfcx implements therefor. It was stated that one cf the reasons cultivation was slight was the lightness of the soil, Another is that weeds are few, there being no water to spare for them, une labout the Umani has, which the Iraqi has not, is the removal of surface stones. As in all places where date palms are grown commerc- cially, in Uman, they are grown from offshoots. They areplanted out, when still quite small, half the size usual in the Iraq. Perhaps, in the Iraq, a big shoot is necessary, so that the root may be beneath the surface salt. 50 to 75k a&amp;x are said to survive. PLATE XXVTI. Young Uffi BI-nAH uffshoots at Sib. These small shoots are sometimes planted in nursery beds. y^ALBAH, ^ALBAT. Tey are much less trapped up than t those of the Iraq, probably because winter in the Batanah and near the coast brings no frost, and because, in summer, there is no, or less, tearing regoing, scorching, blasting, dust.laden, Iraqi SHAMAL, the H.... wind from the burnt-up desert. The off shoots are planted nearly always jcqpt in pits. Perhaps this is because the pit provides shelter, perhaps because the roots get nearer the sub-soil water,but more lively, it is so that the roots are buried frrmly in the light soil, and are anchored against high v/inds. Many are the palms seen, supproted py palm buttresses. Sometimes, a palm, likely to fall, is held in ga place by a stone walj. four feet high, and six feet in diameter. The space between the boll and the wal is filled in with rammed earth. On the whole, planting is leas regular than in the Shatt al Arab district though in some gardens, the palms are set rightj.y at the corners of squares. The unevenness of the ±and may be a contributary cause of irregular planting, though the same excuse doas not hold for the Batanah. The price of offshoots of most of the common varieties is twenty or thirty PAI, or about 5/ , each; but PARAPH offshoots command twice that. PLATE XXVIII. Offshoots planted in Pits in a ffaroen of Faradh palms at Sifaiah. A seedling is known as i^ASH. In the Iraq,a seed ling is known as DI^ALAH; while in korocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, in addition to this woed, KHAjuT is also used. kanuring is practiced. Camel dung is the favour ite application. Br. Po-ence states that manuring is annual• Hiebuhr states that fish offal is used as toanure. From what the present weiter observed, affeer the goats, cows, donkeys and16 In Horth. Africa, and thru the date palm zone to Persia, the dead fronds are cut off close, and distaily, to the swollen base. In a yeat’s time the swollen base, now hard and dry, is cut off close to the trunk, and used for firewood. In Uman, the swollen base is not cut off, perhaps because the SUMAH and other trees provide everywhere abundant fuel, bimilarl^ in the Punjab, the bases are Idft on the palm. In California, also, the frond bases were not cut, until recently. Some apprehension was felt, when it was observed that roots were growing out of the trunks underneath the frondbases, and were pushing the atter off. From what appeared in the tfadi Samayil, where roots could b® found commonly pushing off the frond bases to a height of six feet from the ground, this root production is not harmful to the palm. The frond bases once pushed off, the aerial roots dry up and drop off. The trunk is called GARIDAH, when alive, but, when dead, and cut up for the carpen ter, it is called GADIiUAH. In the Iraq, SDCEKK (FADHUAH is the trunk alive or dead, while JARIDAH is the frond midrib. Cf. the district of the JARID in Tunisia. The frond, in the tfadi ^amayil, is ZUBAH, pi. The vigour of the oamayil palms is astonishing. The average height is half as high again as that of the Iraqi palmsi fronds twenty feet lond are common; and trunks were seen which looked three feet in diameter, thought thvy were not measured. And these are the palms which have been subjected to a nine years 1 drought. Many palms, in the drier parts of the oases, kx have died, but not a large proportion of the whole. PLATE XXIX. Lead palms in the Oasis of Miltqah al Aliyah, with Terraced wheat Land in Foreground. Almost all the palms in the oasis of Miltqah al Aliyah have died; a great many are dead in Al Amqat; and some are dead in Sifalsh, Ghubrah, Ahunar, Awainst, Hasas, Sarur, and Miltqah al Hadariyah. PLATS XXX. The oasis of Miltqah al Kadariyah, at the Junction of the Wadi Samayil and the '.Vadi al Gailah, where a quarter of the palms have died.of Drought. For this cause, and exodus of the people to Zanzibar is said to have occurred, their livelihood in the Uman being gone. An informant said that one male was pxanted to every ten females • From observation, males would seem much leas frequent than this. One to fifty females appeared nearer the truth. A female palm, which in any one } ; ear, may not be i bearing, is called LAI. In the Iraq, it is either so called, or else KAIL. Late of Ripening of In Matrah and Maskat on the orb/June, therewere available, and had been for some days, LAGLAL LATnS f half way between KIIALAL and RATAL. These had come from the Batanah. Unripe dates are green. When they reach fxull size, the green ei# colour of the skin changes to yellow, or red, or red and yellow. The flesh is still firm. Many varieties of dates in thi£ stage are edible, though there is still so much unappreciated tannin in others, that they cannot be eaten, until a later stage of ripening be reached. Dates, at this stage of ripening are known as XLALAL in the Iraq, but as 3ISIR in Urnan and in17 • rV* /cc?: in Horth Africa. HATAB dates are those which have developed he- yondthe KHALAL stage and the flesh has softened. The dates are now Syrupy and sticky. On further drying, the dates become TAMAR , firmer aa d darker than the RATAB. In Uman, TAiiAR are calx ed SAH. Dates picked in the HATAB stage go bad in a few days: in the TAkAR stage, they keep for ever, if protected from insects, because of the high sugar concentration. In the Samayil, on the 7th June, KHAIAL were common, and had been so for ober a week; but they had not yet begun to soften into RATAB. It was not until the first week in July that any AHADAL were seen in the Basrah market. These were EAIIAWI, selling at eight annas a HUty^AH,i.e. 6.4 / a lb. The earliest dates in the Wadi Samayil are thus six v/eeks earlier that the earliest in Basrah. In the Batanah, they a are probably two months earlier. It is stated that Uman has .JiAlkAL and RATAB dates for five months in the year, beginning with HACrKAL and i^ASH BATASH, and ending with the winter varieties of KHASAE. and HILALI. In -^asrah, the season is between four and five months long, beginning with BRAlii and ending with AIIASAB. Cooked cates. Ther is a great trade in cooked 3I3IR, in the Irac, called KIIA1AL MARBURH, in Persia RKARAX, The kABASLI variety is that which is most commonly cooked; but there are ma^y other varieties, amongst which are the RATiiT and the , The export of these cooked dates is almost all to India; ana they, and other (HRAIM ABB CHIBCHAB) from Basrah, can be found in most north Indian Bazars. PLATE XXXI. Furnace for Cooking Dates at Sifalah. The Four Pillars are Designed to Support a Roof over the Cooking Pots. To the -ueft is the Chimney. Piseases. In the Baranah, the majority of palm boils are more or less scored with borer holes and, in some cases, are half eaten away. Twt r anychus . the we it- spinning, red, spider was met ^ with rarely, most commonly in the dry, northern end of Xhubar. ^ A disease called HARAQ was well known, out no afflic ted palms were seen. It was said that a honey-like substance covers the date bunches and spoils them. Yield. The yield of palms this year in the Wadi Samayil is probaoly tweice that of those in the Shatt al Arab district. If 50 lb. a palm be the average yield J?er palm in the Ja tter loca tion, in the former, it might be put at 100 lb., and, in the ^ Batanah, at 75 lb. The commonest number of spadices, or fruit bunches, ASQA^R pl.ASAQ,, in the Iraq, ATH^AH and ATHAi^t in the Samayil, was 9. The average per palm was perhaps 8. In the Ba tanah, there were gardens where the yield appeared truly extra ordinary. In some of these particular gardens, no palm had less than 12 to 15 bunches, and each bunch would have weighed at harvest about 15 lb. In the very best gardens of Basrah also, t ther are palms, HALLAWI, which are stated to produce 1^0 lb. of f fruit annually. A hundred palms such as these would thus produce more sugar in an acre than is produced by the same area of the finest sugar cane grown under optimum conditions. What is the total yield of dates, as cooiced BISIR and as SAH, is a question for the solution of whch the data the scantiest. If the previously suggested figures for yield and numbers be procisionally accepted, the the 2,500,J00 palms,palms, bearing each 85 In. of dates, would give a total prodtro*^ tion of about 95,000 tons. But, to be on the cautious side, it would be as well to assume that the other vallies, not seen, are drier and less productive than the Samayil, that the northern end of the Batanah is less flourishing than the southern, and tha the average yield per palm over the whole country is nearer, say, 60 In. per palm than 85. On this basis, the total production would amount to 67,000 tons, but a remark is appended to show that these custom house figures represent about half the actual total export. That was before the reorganisation of the kaskat customs. There is a large export to the interior, if one may put it so; but, probab ly greater than either the land or the sea export, is the local demand. Bates enter more into the diet of the populace than they do in the Itaq, since wheat and barley are not grown on a large scale, and rice not at all. Price. The price dates were selling at last year, when the crop was considered short, varied in the gardens from 30 RIAL a BAIiAR for UML BIL1AK to 50 or 60 RIAL for PARABTI and kASAixL.1, i.e. from 1 / a lb. to 2. Last year, the high Basrah prices perhaps affected the Uman market. Packing. RrlALAL and RATAL are transported in circular protec tors made of palm frond midribs tied togeter with palm fibre twine These protectors are a, foot long and six inches in diameter, and are open at both ends. The dates are inserted and the ends plugged with palm fibre, LIP. Such a protective container is called LI3LAL About 20 inches such containers are packed in an open, long, squat basket of woven palm leaflets, KHUSS, known as a LARHALAH. The mou th is closed with palm fibre twine. The whole weighs about 14 tor 15 Maskat MAR, or about 125 lb. Twosuch baskets is a donxey load. The field Service Pocket Book gives a donkey load as 100 Ibl Pour such baskets is a camel load. PLATL XXXII% iLIASAB Bates in UiASAF at land Side Custom House, Hatrah.

These XHASAE arelnnger and flatter than those of the Iraq, and hold rather more. The common sizes are made to hold 10 Maskat Man and 20 Maskat Man. It might be thought that the Batanah, where palms are so abundant, would have provided all the containers-for its o own datesand more; but, actually, there is a laarge import of KHASAF from the Samayil, at about 8 RIA-uAT a 100 or 5 / each, beuan: cause the leaflets of the Samayil palms ae so much more long, wide and strong than those of the Batanah palms. Varieties. The BAREHI palm was seen at Samayil. The fronds are fine and graceful, the graceful, the leaflets fine, long, and feathery. The general appearance of the palm is reminiscent of the BAIRI and XHABHRAWI of the Itaq. .The fruit is somewhat spherical and juicy. The palm wao not found at A1 Hil. A small date, called BATuI, was seen as hardly ripe ^ idiA-uAL in Matrah market, 4,6.27 It is aaid to be exported to India as KRALAL MATBUKH. It is considered inferior. Bilaq is fcund in Samayil and in the Batanah. TheThe fruit stalks are orande in colour. BIRNI palms are very common in A1 Aliyah, and loss so in inthe Batanah. The fruit stdis are bright yellow. The date is long thin and was still green the girst week in June. It is considered a good quality date. BU RARIiTGI is found at Samayil and in the Batanah. The PARABH xjccfcHX palm is the commonest in the seve^i miles of the oasis of A1 Aliyah Sifalah-Ghubrab-Khubas, v/here is mg may perhaps constitute one-third of the palms. It is said to be one of the three commonest at Pinjah and Ahaudh; but, in the Batanah it is hardl to be met with. The fronds stand well up, nor bend but t&amp;ey are not numerous. The date is small and dariv reddish b brown. The stone is small, the flesh firm, and the skin not easily broken. The flavour is strong. The harvest is not very early for Uman, being in the early part of August near the coast, but at the end of that mon-th further inland. This date is the only one shipped to America in large quantities. This trade.is old estab lished, as there are records of as many as four ships calling for these dates to take tham to America in the one year 1876. In 1884, the exports to America are first shown separately by the custom authorities. The exportxyxacjqsaacxx, however, appears never to have reached 5,000 tons; and the average appears to be half that amount. The total crop, within a radius of two days{ donkey journey of Uatrali, probably does -ot exceed o,500 tons. For 1900, the price of FARADH dates was only slightly thaA that of the other dates exported. Recently, however, the average exoort price of FARADH dates has been double the average price of'the total dates exported. The American export is nowadays ±x containedin 12 lb. boxes, nine of which are packed in a case- The rejects from the packing are shipped to India. PDATI2 XXXIII. FARADH Palms near A1 Aliyah Market. ATHTRAB Tree o on Right. HATIHMI is a large palm at Samayil. HAMKI dates are small. HAXDBA1 or '^ASH HAHDBAL palms grow at Samayil and in the joatanah. xBATE XXXIV A HAHDHA1 Palm at Miefah A1 Aliyah. The untrimmed Frond Banos can be seen. On the right is a Terrace wall of this Excellently Terreaced Oasis. RASAS Palms were common to the Jadi and to the Batanah. HI-uAnl palms are common to both districts, it is an even later ripening date than HHABAD. The quality is good. JABRI WAS F0UEB AT SIB. The XHALAS is an important Uman date variety, it is common in the Jadi ^amayil, but none were seen in the Batanah. The palm has a bushy head. The excellent quality of the dates is everywhere recognized. The colour is fine, reddish brown. ELAMRI palms are the third commonest at AD HID. The dates are early and the DTADAB yellow. The KHASAB palm which is found as far north as Baghdad in the Iraq, is one of the four commonest varieties in a-i- Aliyah is common at Bhallah, and is present in the Batanah. It xc said to be the commonest variety at DAKHAL. The fronds are upstanding(Toi) upstanding. The leaflets are more at right angles to the midrfl^^/ thafv are those of KHINAILI. The whole appearance of ohe palm is more feathery that that of FARADH. The palm does not hear so heavily as the I'ARADH, although the latter dates are the more expensive. It is the latest date to ripen with the exception MfLALI. The KHALAL are a fine, dull carmine and appearing in the groves when the other dates have long been cut are striking. Last year’s TAMAK were to be obtained in lAatrah market this June. AHIHAIZI palms were found at uhallah and at A1 Hil. The red KHALAL v/ere in Matrah Market on the 4th of June. The fronds are outstanding. The leaflets are somewhat closely appressed to the mid rib. The dates are said to be excellent. There are LAZAD palms in the Wadi Samayil, but none were seen in the Batan&amp;h. The dates were greon mbl± aar.ly in June. Tie RATAL are said to be good. The UABA3LI variety is one of the four commonest in A1 Aliyah; there are a few palms at A1 Hil; and it is said to be one of the three commonest varieties of KHAUDH. It is said that it is the com monest variety in the Wadi iA&amp;awil. It can claim to be one of the lead ing varieties of Uman and for export. Almost the entire crop, if not all, is made into cooked HI SIR, and it is in that form that it is exported. It is a dearer dao© than KliASAL. The MALLUKI variety is found in the Wadi and at AL Hil; The MINZIF was seen in the Wadi, and at Sib, though not at A1 hil The palm is HALLAWI like, with long, thin fronds. The dates were still green the first ixxsbunE week in June, rather narrow and t rather long. MIZAAG palms wore seen at A1 Hil, uhallah, and many in the Wadi Samayil. There are palms called MIZJIAg AL BAHAR and others called MlZ [AG AL IMXN; but these are thought to refer to the same variety. The KHALAL are red and xmraxxx were on sale in Matrah market on the 4th of June. Yellow KHALAL, called MASRI, were on sale at the sare place on the same day. The SA'^BAL variety is one of the commonest. There are some at A1 Hil, and they are said to be common all along the Batanah. Thmy are said to be one of the commonest sorts at Finjah and Khaudh. T&amp;ey are one of the four commonest at Samayil. At Qhallah they were eommon The date presents points of resemblance with the SAYIR of the Iraq, in that it is common, the KHALAL are edible, and yellow, and the half RATAB dates show a very definite and distinctive line of demarkation between the apical RATAB half and the basel KLALAL half. On the other hand, the MABAL dates hxjs resemble the HALLAWI in size, in earliness, and by a characteristic white basal part of the TAMAn. This white base is xatexnix not noticfcble in HALLAWI dates when the palms on which they are borne have suffered from drought, and earns for them the title, Fathers of tittle ABUupstanding. The leaflets are more at right angles to the midrib thana^r^^t^se of KHIIIAILI. The whole appearance of the palm is mor • feathejry than than of FARADH. The palm does not bear so heavily as the FABALII* although the latter dates are ibhe more expensive. It is the latest date ta -rijoen with the exception MIjuAj-J . The xu-iAiAn are a fine, dull camiTre^and appearing in the groves when the other dates have long been cut^rah^triking. Last year f s TAMAR were to be obtained in Matrah marke^th^s June. A few Marghili palms in AL HIL. • RRATS XXXV. A iiaghal x alm at Misfah at Aliyah. The .bases of the Fronds are not cut. In the foreground, a small water fall of irrigation water descending from one terrace to another. LA8HU AL KEARMAH are in AJL Kin and in Samayil. QASR AHMAR is the nai e cf a Jamayil variety. The red colour of the colour of the KHA-uAx. was just beginning to show on 7th of June. c^AGH LATASH ware seen at Sama„ il but not in the Batanal In the Samayil, it is the earliest date to ripen; but it does not find its way into, the Matrah market earliest, because the nAGLAL of the coast are before it. The ALA-uAL are red. Q,ash GAHAILI ware seen at Gib. The dates were in the MLA.uA.Li stage (yellow). .^ASH LAMJMAII is the second commonest date at A1 Hil and is said to be very common all alond the Latanah. - L t was seen only occasionally in the Wadi Samayil. The dates were in the AIIALAI stage. The are alnlost as early as *A KAL. LAXYIM palms are in the Latanah and in the Wadi. The big handsome ^ASH SUMAIH pa^ms v/ere encountered at . Samayil, at A1 Hil, and at *-&gt;ib. The dates turn red straight from g] green, without any yellowing^ and this gives them a curious appearance. SARKHI dates are cooked and exported to India. Sarnak palms have red fruit stalks. They ware seen in the Wadi and in the Latanah. Like the C^ASH SAWAIH, the dates of the SHALRUT variety melt from dark green to dark red,yaking them gcppR look dull and unusual. These KHALAL are bitter; but the RATALand TAMAR are said to be good. SHAHAM dates a ere reddish brown yellow MLIAxAx* at Sib early in June. SlnAHI Mtes were yellow aIALAL at Sib. SUM are said to be sent as MRALAL MATLUiQI to India. Umani are said to be exported in a similar manner. Is this a trade synonym for MALASnl? kXXX PLATL XXXVI. Yound Umm SIxuJUI PALMS at Sib. Round each is a Circle of Millet, GfiASHMAR. UIL- SILLAII is the commonest Batanah date. If it be reckoned that one-third of all the Batanah^ palms be of this variety*^ to total varieties at Sib hold good for the whole tract, then there must be about half a million palms of UmmUMM SILiAH, Early in June, the dates were still green. E year’s prices were from 50 to 40 RIAL a 3AIIAR, i.e. 1 to ^ ~ / a pound. It is the commonest date met with in Baskets in the markets. The red i£-LA~u/Lu of UMM ZAI^AG were seen in Matrah. The ZIBID lain is common in the Jadi Bamayil, and easy to find at Sib. The general is suggestive of the KALLWAWI o fa; the Iraq. The dates are said to be of good quality. They are small and very late. OTHER CRO-S. Bruit Treeo. Of all the fruit trees to be found, more or u.ess in the shade of date palms in the oases, and nowhere else, pro bably the small, sour lime, LUMAH, of. the FUMI of the Iraq, is the commonest. The tree is bush-1ike,'and of a dense, very dark'green foliage. There is no pruning. The limes are of particularly excellent quality; and there is a great trade in them, both fresh and dry, and a considerable export of the latter. Rev/ other citrus trees are to be seen in the xiata- nah, out large numbers of many varieties in the Bamayil.

Mangoes are particularly common at Sib. It is said that the number decreases rapidly from ^ib northwards along the Batanah. They are to be found in most of the oases of the Wadi Samayil, at least, up to Hub, In the Wadi, they fruit later than on the coast. The commonest kind is the big ZABZl-attAi variety, and also a little one, red on cne side. The stately trees, the biggest in all the land, provide grateful, dense shade over the TAWIAHtanks and water-hoists. The nixt most common fruit is the Guava, here called ZAITUK, though in the Iraq, this word means * olive’ ASFARGIL, noted above as being the Cweet Hime in Uman means ’quince’ in the Iraq. Like onions, these guavas can bring tears to the eyes, for they smell £of strawberries-- England, June, and strawberries’, the flesh pink.m Cashew hut trees are fairly comm n in the -^atanah, and possibly somewhat less so in the Wadi. They, like the xi-angoes make imposing shade trees, and pppear to find the climate favourable. The Umanis adapt the Urdu word, and call the tree BIUHAM. There is a tree met with singly cr in tv/os and threes in most gardens. It is found in Basrah. It grows, as a rule, to a height of less than SOfeet; the leaves are evergreen and large; ?nd it is a good shade tree. The fruit is the size of a crab apple, yellow, soft, thin-skinned, with flesh that is like the stickiest of starch slightly flavoured with extract of fig s.nd banana. If one have much of it when thirsty, he notices the astrunhency. Saturation point is soon reached. Is this and euwsniat In Gujarat, where it is also found, it goes by the name of GAIUDAR. In the Iraq, it is BAMBAH, in Uman GAU. The remaining fruit trees are all more or less uncommon. Bananas , KAUZ, fre grown in-some gardens, and not in others, hecterines, KEAUKH, and pomegtanites, RlHAh, are not much in evidence. The latter are said to be especially common, and of wspecially good quality, sweet, succulent, and smal^seeded, on the Gabal Akhdar. There also vines, ABAB are said to flourish exceedingly. In the Wadi and the Batanah, vines were few. In Algeria, ARAB is the fruit zizyphus. It is curious how crop names are transposed in different Arabic-speaking districts. Only two or three cocoanuts, BARGIL, and papaya, FIFAI, were to be seen. These are at Sib. Ground Cro;s. wn the whole, ground crops are not an extensively grown as might have been expected. Perhaps the nine years’ drought has made water so scarce, that there is available only for the more important date palms. In those gardens, where water is plentiful, as for example, those at the southern end of A} Aliyah, lucerne covers most of the ground. '■N P-uATB XXXVII • A field of Lucerne. In the Middle distance, FARADH palms. In the Background, the Gabal as Suq, AI Aliyah. Here, the lucerne is GAT, in the Iraq, JAT. It is v/atered twice a week, is cut once a month, and xasts for five years without resowing. The prices varied in early June in the oases from 18 to 22 Maskat PAI a Mashat i.e. about -g- j6 a lb. The yield in most gardens did not look heavy. Perhaps a ton a-n acre is a fair estimate for each cutting. On this basis, an acre of lucerne would produce an annual crop worth about 160 gross, provided prices remained the same throughout the year, or over twice the average annual value of the date crop. Probably though, in winter, when water is plentiful, the price of lucerne is low. Also, the gardens which grow lucerne are the gardens where waier is plentiful, and where the palms are of more valuable varietixes and produce more heavily than the average. However, the fact is undeniable that lucerne, where a market for it is handy, is a valuable crop. Probably owing to water shartage, as in the Saharan oases, millets are more grown than lucerne. The commoner of the two grown is a dwalf Bulrush Millet, BAZARI the other adwarf common Millet, SHASHMAR. These are usually grown in small irrigation beds, like lucerne, and sometimes in fringes round the palm watering pans. BAZARI is so much the staple fodder, that it is usually called TAAM, whereas, in the Iraq this would usually denote’wheat'. The sandy soilsoil of Uman drains the water away rapidly; and the fodder crops accordingly either suffer from water shortage, or else have to he restricted to those inferior varieties, which are more drought resistant than the others. Improved irrigation methods ly produce an increase in fodder and ground crops generally. Another fodder, widely grown, is a low grass ( Cynoclon ? called vRASHILIYAH. Niebuhr mentions DURkaH and DUJifflAl^ but no one was encountered bu the weiter. who understood these terms, although these are well known in the Iraq. Wheat and barley are grown, as a rule, at the tails of the oases, on terraces labouriously levelled and freed from stoces. The winter flow of the springs is presumable greater than that of the summer, and a surplus presumably flows from the palmeries out to the g^irain. But little was grown last year; and prices, despite a bid import from India, ruled high. The word HANTAH is not understood; wheat is called HABB, BARK, ABAl, or GIF. The harvest was said to have finished in KAkALKAI^' and to ^e threshed by hand, using the flail or MI^SHA. There is everywhere a remarkable scarcity of vege tables. Colocasia, FILUAL, cf. the Iraqi RANDAL, Cow Fes, LUBIYAK, Fgg Plant, BAIDHANJAN, Onions, Busal, Vegetable Barrow AQTIN, v/ere all that were seen growing in June, and these in but small quantities. Of these, onions were by far the commonest. Fibres are represented by cotton, GUTAN, which is grown in ode corners in Batanah gardens. There is a red as well as a yellow flowered variety. The staple is half inch. The bushes are more or less perennial. The leaves are small and much in dented. The cotton is woven into the strong, coarse cloth used for the WUZAR or loin cloth. ' None of the sugar cane, which Dr. Harrison mentions were seen. would proba Castor oil plants grow here and there semi-wild, and sometimes sown. AHAH&amp;AH is understood, though ABASH is the usual woed. The oil is extracted from the seeds, but is not 'used aperient, as it is in the Iraq, but to anoint the body in cases of sickness. The leaves are put over the newly henna-ed hand. Flowers are almost absent, a few roses and a little jasmine.The population oi the wadi bazna^ril and of the hatanah is Arab but there is evident a great admixture of negro bieod, especially in the latter place. It is said also that there has been much Baluchi blood brought into tne country. In iiatrah, and, to a certain etittent, in the other to\/ne, thefe is a class of merchants, whose ancestors caj.e over from India some hundreds of years ago, and who are now known as KMAUJIAH. They are 8RIA Mohammadnns. Those who live in watrah are housed within an over crowded area, the outer houses of which make a complete circle ofj fortifications within the town. Indian baniyans are common in Matrah and kaskat. Bag t ;y trowswered and beturbaned Baluchis form also a considerable part of the population of t ese two towns. Language. The language of the country is Arabic, though .Baluchis will carry one tnru tne towns. There are various dialectical peculiarities, such as the letter JIM is pronounced GIM, so that JABAL becomes GABAL and JAMAL, GAMAL. The KAk seldom changes to CHAF, though OHALAB is an exception. For MALHA TAKU), either MA TAHlD of T7UCH T.\HID is used. Cf. the BHI TAKID of Tne Iraq. Though Uraanis speak more grammatically than the Iraqis, in some respects, as, for example, in AIN TAB^IR, instead of V/AIN KABYAH, yet, in others, xhey are less correctT as in IThNA for ’twelve*, THILATMA lor ’tnirteen* find so fortn. Most of tne differences in tne names of tne plants and animals encountered have been noted alrady. une or two other words differ in the Iraq and the Wadi Bamayil rntiy be mentioned here.

I&gt;r. Harrison states the e are special mosques for the women. • The Rev. Fr. Pennings told the writer that, to the north of the Baraayil, there rre to be found people who gives great shoul before they eat. Buch practices are condemned by the more orthodo? They are probably survivals of an older religion than that of the prophet, here, as elsewhere in Islamic, and other, countries, the Evil Kye is known and feared. Bones are tied to palms, put on garden walls, or lit into houses, just like the 'healing stoned of tne Hebredes, to guard against this over-present menace. By the way-side, were encountered often neaps of stones, presumably collected from the surrounding area. The piles might have been four or* five feet high, and twelve feet or more across at the bas The guide/, when asked the reaon for those heaps, gave conflictin stories, elike only in their improbability-. Kither they did not know the reason, or they did not wish to communicrt it. Have these heaps any superstitious meaning? Though prayer is so widely and so constantly indulged in * theine people appear fur less lanatical than In other Islamic countries. Hefreshing it was to nit down to meet end to eat out of the sjjiae dish with the STONI, and to see/ them drink out of the Westerner’s glass as readily as out of anyone else’s and much was the pleasant jesting at the refusal of the baniyan and the Brahmin to do so. But these people have seen no ifiuropeans before, nor Christians, as have the Muelimin of Borth Africa, &amp;A the Iraq, and Persia. Perhaps, had they seen as much of the Kx European as have the Syrian and the Iraqi, they also might have refused to cat with him. Appearance. The Wadi bamayil Arab is small, thin, slight, and of a color rurying from milk chocolate to ordinary chocolate. The shaikhs and merchants, living lives less exposed to the sun than the majority, are fairer, some not darker than Calabrians. The men have the proper, picture-book, Arab faces, though their chins are rather too receding, and, instead of a snail, pointed, trim ed beard, their chins are made hideous with an unkempt fringe of wiry, black beard, rather like Parmer Hayseed’s except for the color. These are not a hairy people, so perhaps they feel they have not enough board to lose any by trimming. The negroes in the Batanah are more robust; but even these appear thinner, shorter, and slighter than teir brethren elsewhere. The little boys are often pretty, witn full lips, well curved, lar t ,e, black eyes, and unprorainent chins, une is reminded of portraits of young Spanish noblemen of the XVII th and XVIII th centuries. Often on the children lies a langorous, sickly pallor, Is it malaria? The woman may be plain; but they look one straight in the face; and that alone, after the absurd esties of other ]r/tuhamiiadan women in covering up their charms, makes them --- attractive. Their demeanor is grave and decorous, save when the sight of topee, trousers, and dark glasses proves too much for them, and compels them to break down into paroxysms of helpless giggles. How describe the little girls? 'Dainty rogues in porcelain' is quite unsuitable, bay, hard-working, thin, fever- stricken, happy, little wenches. When dressed In nothing but their little red trowsers, they are, if the expression be —* allowed, a ecreojn. Clothes. ' Pull dress consists of a loin cloth, WUZAR, woven locally, either from home-grown cotton, or, more usually, from Indian yarn. The width of the looms is about eighteen inches. Consequently, two widths of ciotn are swn together to male one WIJZ^R, about tnree feet wide. The length is about six fleet. The color is usually white; but a great number of other colors are allowed. Both borders are always gaily striped. To put on the WUZAR, one holds it behind him, tne upper edge against tne waist, the lower against the ankles, then {pqqi pulls the two ends forward, keeping the middle of the WTJZ^R in the middle , of the back. The two upper corners are now drawn together, crossed over, and tucked under the folded edge drawn tightly round the waist. A thin, cot on shirt, THA1JB, is worn over the WUZAR, and also reaches the ankles, or nearly so. The front and throat ppehjiigg is held closed with studs, or, in slightly differently shaped shirts, with a single button at the neck, not quite at the centre. Often a red line is embroidered along the yoke, round the collar, and along the edge of the front opening, and in the middle of the waist. Although the commonest color for shirts in the towns is white, yet, in the country, khaki shirts &lt; are common, eapecially amongst the poorer classes. A suspicion that those ohirts also were originally white was allayed toy Inquiryinquiry. A white, openwork, high-crowned, cotton, skull cpp is worn, beneath a large Kashmiri, embroidered, colored, woollen turban, often held in place by black, woollen, binding cords. Important, and religious people usually ear white turbans; but the color of a turban appears to be as much a matter of in dividual taste as of voc-tionrl or social distinction, a belt HAZAM, more or less ornamented, holds in front a dagger —- scabbard, the apical three or four inches of which is at right angles to the rest. This holds the curbed digger, the KHANGAR* with ornamented hilt. The Iraqi KHASGAR is of the same type; but the scabbard is curved thruout its length, and avoids the curious rectangle. limani daggers vary In value from 10 RIAL for that of the camel driver to 500 RIAL and more for one inlaid wii with gold and gems for shaikhly use. Sandals may, or may not, be worn. Occasionally, a bright and richly embroidered waist coat or Zuave Jacket, ZAKJittAH or 82DAIRI, is worn, especially by tne negro servants of the weaitny. The woollen cloak, the or ijTSHIT, so characteristic a part of the dress of the Arab of the north of Arabia, or the HAIX or JUBBAH or BURiRiS typical of aorth Africa, is here unknown. Consequently, the people here nave an undressed appearance to one used to their more northerly cousins. Jt is apparently not such a breach of etiquette to uncover the head, as it is elsewhere in Arab land; and tne email scull cap is head-dress full enough for even ceremonial occasions, whereas, in the Iraq, the corresponding \RAKCHIR is only undress. Woman’s dress is composed of three pieces, kirst are the trowsers, BARWAL, tight fitting from ankle to knee, above that loose, and drawn in to the waist by a tape, TICHCHAH. Cotton cloth is the material and red the com oneet color, though blakk, is common too, and greens and blues and other colors a,re seen. The colored cloth hoc generally a snail psttern in white. Second, comes a shirt, BISHDASHAH, reaching to the knee, or a little below, more often red also with a small white pattern, but often also of other colors, frequently there is gay embroidery round the neck, and on either side of the opening at the throat. Round the head, face, and throat, is| worn a cloth, PAGHTAR, which leaves the face exposed, but coven the hair. The free end falls down the back. Red again is the commonest color. The cusceptibillities of the Umani are more easily offended than those of the shpper on 42nd Street orFifthj Avenue; and, though raenis clothes are everywhere displayed in the market, it is not so with the women's. Only the cloth, as et bearing no disturbing likeness to the female shape, is sold in the shops; and she who would have clothes muefc either take the cloth to be made up at a tailor's, or, preferably, be her own tailor. Food and that at noon, even amongst shsikhly folk. Morning and night dates are the fare. Heat is rare. Tea is hardly drunk. At Sib, a curious custom was observed, .after coffee had been handed round, in the came cups, hot milk was offered to each guest. Diseases. To a non-medical eye, the whole population Iddks as though it suffers acutely from malaria. C’ertainly the doctors report malaria as remproit in naskat town in the winter months. How frr the seemingly gentle, listless nature of the inhabitant is due to race, how far to rui atrocious, humid climate, and how far to malaria is a nice point to determine, a leper cilony was passed near Khubar, and an old leper was se&lt; n begging for alms. Lepers are not allowed in the villages, markets, or assemblies of the MUSLIMIH. Byphilis was heard of; and the hot spring of (lhallah is said to be efficacious in this disease and for skin diseases in general. Kye defects, blindness, squints, and grey films across the cornea appeared common, a man\ man was encouni*ei'eu ac Slb§ w&amp;o had twa what looked like aaalgaiD filiin&amp;s in the front surface of his two, central, upper — incisors. He said tnere was no dentist in liman, that he had never left the country, and that he had put the fillings in himself# Pernapo the man was liar. Several people asked for raedicino for fever, BAKHUNAH, and for constipation; and so did one small hoy, who for four pears had suffered from painful urination. The Indian Government supports a hospital et Maskst; and Dr. Harrison, of the American Mission, opened a temporary one at Matrnh recently. He hopes to raake it permanent; and. Judging by the thronging crowds of sick, overflowing even the verandahs, a permanent h^ppital would he of immense benefit to • the community. But hospitals are expensive to maintain. Character and Habits and Customs . Who shall attempt to describe the character of a people after a twelve days’ stay among them? Btill, despite the adage of the fools and the angels, first impressions, by force of contrast with what one is used to, have a certain value. The first thing that strikes a tripper, and probably also the enduring impression of the old resident, is the attractiveness of the people. What is the reason? is it that, as some men are supposed to love their wives as much for their faults as for their virtues, v*esterners find chorda of sympathy with traits in tne Arab character, they do not find in many other orientals, not virtuous perhaps, but skin to their own? Probably the limani Arab would be called laay. The cultivator works, of course, and works hard; but the garden owner does not. Perhaps though these people are not more lazy than English people. Perhaps the difference one notices in that Bnglisn people are actively lazy, while these are passively lazy. If they have not to wirk, i nglish people go the Riviera, play tennis, hunt, go to meetings, read novels, or shop. But, here, the richer sort like Just to sit. as for mental In; ineos, one is probably as bad as the other. These shaikhs are not interest -ed in golf. If one tries to talk economies to either, he is apt to make himself a bore. The politeness of the Umanis is remarkable. Their constant courtesy could not have been a personal matter, but moot have been typical. One of the two Europeans employed by the state is the Minister of finance. But, in Europe, if the t?ix collector w&lt; re an Arab, would Arabs be popular? This politeness is all the more surprising, when it is conoidered what uncomfortable companions the American and the Britisher must be to trie Arab. The two former are never content, to let things alone: they must always be digging for reasons. In the natter of formal compliment, the bmani appears less lengthy than the Iraqi; and he seems to come sooner to the point of a conversation. Ko says each word with a pronounced and even emphasisl and is speech is abrubt. He doeenot shout so much when talking as the Iraqi. Of the labors of the people mention has been made, of the tillage, stock raising, and fishing. To speak of their pleasures, those of the bed orobabiy take first place, as else where. Prayer, as e relaxation and comfort, must take high place with them; and, though they turn to it without the rigid fierceness of the WAHABIYAH, their constancy and regularity in this respect uhnme their uneducated cousins of the Iraq, the majority of whom have never learnt to pray. Coffee, Q,AHWAH, is the only permitted tipple. Araq and all strong waters are taboo Fo too le tobacco, TiTIH f In the town of Mntrah, the weed is sold ppenly in the shpps; but, ai Al Aliyah, one who had the teserity to dioplay it, a Baluchi, was fined end his stock confiscated. Bo f in Matrah, openly in the street persons may be scon amoking. Away from this busy haunt of vice, he who would smoke must do sop on the lonely mountain, or secure in the privacy of his inner chamber. Hegroes, especially the slaves, will generally smoke, if they can get hold of tobacco, and will drink, if they can get hold of arnq. indeed, these - blacks |blacks only require opportunity to smoke, to drink, and cheer fully to go a-whoring. In the Iraq, TTRY-AK or AXYDH are the nnme£ of opium; but neitner was understood in the tfacti Samayil. BH/vRAS was mentioned as a smokable drug, its use forbidden by the learnc -ed. ifone was seen; but, owing to the saJiilarity of none with the Indian ’charas 1 , it is probably hemp. Binging does not appear to be either more or less fairably looked upon thim elsewhere in Islam. The donkey lads and herdsmen sing to themselves; but respectable people would hesitate to be so undignified, kor some nights before the ID ADM DHAHAIYAM, the girls of each village would go out therefrom, and, collecting beneath a CHAP tree, give themselves to song. Pleasing were their voices coming thru the moonlit groves. And this is aa annual practice, so it is t:;id. Dancing is a prerogative of the males of the tribe. Kaon evening of the ID, the lads from the date gardens of the bib district, witn their tiny brothers with them, who hardly were to be seen for mighty turbans, assembled on clearings outside the larger villages, uay were the new clothes, anowy white tne shirts, brilliant with new dies t;ie turbans, and polished the silver in the dagger and sword hilts and seabbards, a brave sight. The music makers were the tom-tom oeuter.3, ana the circled spectators clapped their hands in time. In the centre, danced first Biggie lads, then lines of them, each holding his sword, krom a far * knoll, watched the women. One wife is tne rule, more only amongst the wealthiest. On the eve of the DMAHAIYAM ferstivol no sacrifice to Vonus is allowed. The following night, so it i* said, there is a curious proliminarycustom. On the death of a man, his widow takes one- # eighth of his property, and, of the remainder, the sons take two I shares each to one share of each of the daughters. Contrary to the I»aqi custom, which otherwise is the name, instead of one* third of the property be 1 ng get aside, before any sharer are taken, for religious charities, for prayers, and the prevision of the baked meats, the funeral expenses are borne collectively by tne sons. PLATTS XXX/I. The Well-built Hut of a Prosperous cultivator beneath a OHAP Tree at Bib. i'JVtn in the Wadi Snmayil, as far up as A1 Aliyah, there is never ice in winter time. The cultivators * huts are ]i:ade of palm fronds closely fastened to oue another, and from which the leaflets, have been cut almost to their bases. At Ghallah, huts were seen, which consisted of palm frond frames, against which palm frond walls were rested. These walls are^ycen down at night to allow tne air to penetrate. Kven so, the huts are too airless for most of the people to sleep within them; as the sand duns, at night, is covered with sleeping figures, the women and girls nearer the houses, the men and boys further away. The duns, in the moonlight, might be a corpse littered battlefield, in the Bamnyil too, the Wadi bed was the faborite sleeping place in June In the Batanoh, houses are sometimes raised four or five feet off the ground on palm logs. In maskat and iaatrah, the bigger houses are well built of ^tone. PLATE XXXVII. A Btree in lA&amp;skat. Graves are often neatly edged round with stones.

Very little older, they irrigate hud drive the bull in the water-heist pit. Another vivid --- impression Is of these demoerotic autoorate, the shaikhs. There is no question of disputing their authority. The equality of man is a fallacy which has no currency here. And yet the shaikh will ait and ohat with the humulest, will eat the same sort o~ food 0 ?h 0f y h « 8n “° dish, and they will 'thee' and 'thou' each other without ombarrassment. Government(lOVERlUMEJJT The coast, from Has Masandas to Has al Madd, and thence to, and including, ])hufar, is all more or less under tne effective sway of the bultan of kaekat. This potentate also owns Gwadur, on the JJaluchi coast. Me is independent; but, owing to financial difficulties into which his treasury fell, come years ago, the ^ Indian Government lent him money; and, as surety, the Bultan agreec to a British Finance Minister. Each of the more important coast towns is administered in the Sultan’s name by a governor or WALI. The country of Iftnan, to the west of iaaokat, is under the control of a quite independent Imam, by name femhammad. Me, and his powerful and vigorous adviser, Shaikh Isa, are particularly averse zo European penetration. Each oasis, or group of oases, is in charge of a shaikh responsible to the Imam. One such shokh, that of Bidbid, sulaiman al Baruni by name, is an interesting personality. Short, slightly grey, witn beard greyer on tne right side than on the left and trim ed to a blunt point and not allowed to grow as a long and ragged fringe in the fashion of the country,' his voice low, his speech easy to understand, his manner dignified and courteous, his clothes all white of the sort worn by a letter ed man if Tunis, such is this exile from Tripoli. Me came to Uman three years ago, having been refused asylum in French .north Africa i.nd in Egypt,s6 it is said. The climate and the fever of uman are said to nave aged nim much, and nia beard was jet black when he arrived. Me is credited witn writing anti-European articles for the Egyptian and other presses. French, Italians, and .British he regarded as most undesirable people. y\mericans he regarded only witn mild suspicion. Me had known baiyid Talib Pasha, when.the latter had sat with him in council in bt&amp;mbul, before trie war, and he was glad of news of nis old friend. Me was particularly —- interested in tne wnereabauts of the Minister of Finance of Maskat and tne R.A.F. officers and tneir widely advertised attempt to get to the Baralrai oasis; and rumor has it that it is al Baruni himself who has kept them out of that place. The whole subject of airplanes and Imperial Airways was one on which he was anxious for information. The question of Cyprus and a possible new king for that island he discussed for some little time. Judging by the precautions he observed, he must be in some fear of assassination. Both the Bultan and the Imam take ZAKAH, or one-tenth of the gross crop of dates, as tax. Estimators are sent round annually to judge the crop and prepare demand notes. The — cultivators of Awaibi said they paid no taxes, and gave as reason that the Gultan loved them. There is a British Political Agent and Consul nt waskat There was an American Consul there too, but not now. PLATE XXXVIII. Hoff of the British Agency and Consulate at Maskat in Freground.

PLATE AXXIX. The Prison, xiaskat. There are prisons at Makat and Matrah, but the prisoner are few. Food is provided by the relatives of the prisoners and not by the government. Passports are not used in Maskat or Uman. TRADE The money of the country consists of the silver RIAL and the copper PAI. In early June, in Matrah, 234 PAI made up~a niAL, but the humber varies with time and place. T t ,e* . \ « The RIAL fluctuates with the rupee. At the same place, blx, same time, 100 RIAL equalled 165 rupees, i.e. each RIAL was worth 59 cents and each~PAI a quarter of a cent. The market weights, wnich are slightly less than the customs weights of the some name, are as follows:- 1 KIAS equals 5.67 oz. equals 5.71 RIAL 24 KIAS do 8 lb.8 oz. do 137 do equals 1 iaAK 10 MAE do 1 FAR HAL AH, 20 FARSALAJT equals 1 BAHAR, Niebuhr states that, in his day, customs duty on goods imported or exported, belonging to Europeans, was 5 on those belonging to Muhammadans 6i %, and on those belonging to Indians and Jews 9 %• Now-a-days, a flat rate of 5 ^ is supposed to be le/ied on all articles entering and leaving tne bultan’s inryrir territory. Of the manufactures, pernaps boat building is as importan as any. The boats are made cniel'ly at Sur; and are good sea craft manned also by good seamen. The boats come alongside the steamer in a sailor-like way, not, as at Muhammarah, as if with^pleasure at tne helm and Folly ut the Prow.' Finely woven, woollen shirts, KURLUFAN, are made at Al Gajlah. Cotton cloth is woven in most villages. Of industries, agriculture is the most Important, except for the rocky parts of the coast, where the population lives chiefly by fishing. Also, all along the Ratanah, fishing is important. PLATE XL. The SWASHAH. One curious kind of cheap, fishing boat is the SHASMAH, made of palm fronds, and filled with palm frond bases. The deck floats level with the surgace of the water, and tne fisherman gets very wet. Fish flesh, including that of sharks, dolphins, and sharks fins, is dried, salted, stacked, baled, and exported to India, the Straits, and China. The presence of a fish factory is indicated for a considerable distance before it is seen. At the end of consular reports, there is usually a paragraph headed, ’’Oportunities for tne intension of British Trade.' In the cass of tne iiafckat reports, tnis paragraph is usually filled as follows, 'There are no opportunities for the exgension of .British trme'. But this is surely incorrect. Were the sports of the people catered for, quite a large trade could probably be built up. The articles required are powerful — aphrodisiacs and cneap magazine rifles and cartridges.Cartridges are dear. Whereas, in tae Kuwait factory in the Iraq, they are made for seven cents each, in the Wadi iiamayll, they cost twenty cents; so that, a man, whose pay is, perhaps, only about ten cent a day or less, has to triink twice before paying off old scores. CONCLUSION Those who go to not very well known districts usually complete their reports by lists of the underclothing and tabloid foods considered necessary to take with them. The most valuable part of the equipment it is suggested tne traveller to Uman take with him, for his solace and refreshment, is a volume of Meredith If one should have found, many years ago, in easeful cloth, he needed his fiction pre-digested, and, having tried to read a certain of the Master’s novels, had failed, and tnat not till Uman was reached, where is little food and much walking, had a proper receptiveness been developed, and he had gobbled up the tale and asked for more, why then, the journey will have been worth while, however little else the gain. One iurther remark. The aesthetic continental tourist has irequently remarked tnat German scenery is spoiled by the habit ol tne natives of^putting a Birhans on tne tpp of each of theirm their mountains. Possibly it to true that this habit spoils Germany; but fev/ things would so improve Uman ae its very wide spread adoption; and, until something of that sort is done, this country cannot really expect to develop its tourist traffic.

However, i p by any chance you are yoiny ^ome tMs ray, nlease don't fail* to come and spend some time with us. This date season has been more than ordinarily difficult for us, and though it is pre mature yet to say that we have come out with a loss 1 certainly do not think that there has been much profit in it. I peg aray telling my elders and diet tens that re ought to open up in I'askatH pray; but I fear my pearls of wisdom are wasted However, I shall he at home next year, and hope that personal interviews may have more emphasis than letters.

Thirdly, that the prices of dates are cheaper in Alaskat than in Basrah. This year, the average price in Basrah for the commonest variety^ x U V Ci J. i U . bayir^has averaged Rs. 250/ a karah , and the price of the choicest of .the big commercial varieties ■ O-VY Xj 10 ?/ a t C n 7 ourthly, steamers fwom ar ot' some and Rs it would he to Hallawij^is s. 6CC/- a karah .

Sixthly, such an a^ent could obtain an almost unlimited supply of pood quality dates for export without much difficulty. The family has now got six, or it may he seven, teeth. They have been arriving with such incredi ble rapidity that I have lost count recently. I hope you and your family are not finding Maskat too trying. Major Gerald Patrick Murphy, I.A.Huscat. 8th NoT«mb«r 1928. I Tras tflad to get your letter and hear that you and your family are flourishing. I agree with you about the possibilities of exten- -aion of the Muscat trade in dates and certainly if your firm dont do so someone else will do so eventually, As you know,the date tree ia found in all parts of the Oman Sultanate and flourishes even at an altitude of over 2000 feet. The chief areas are Batinah,^adi Semail and Sharcjiyah. The Fard is grown chiefly in Semail. The Mibsali is the principal one in Badiyah and Sharqiyah whence it is exported through Sur by dhow to Bombay. In the Batinah,the plantations form an almost cont- -inuous belt .sometimes 7 miles deep,along the coast. The belt is at least 120 miles long. There is no ques- -tion about the length but I have been unable to trace any reliable authority regarding its afrerage^depth. The great valleys on the seaward slope of Western Hajar all traverse the Batinah on their way to the sea, but their courses within the limits of the Batinah are often ill defined and in some cases their channels are so broken up and dispersed as to render uncertain the point at which they reach the sea. It is probably in the lower reaches of these wadis that the belt reaches its greatest depth. In the valleys themselves,the date palms are grown on terraces. 7/orking westward from Sib,at Barkah,which is celebrat- -ed foruits dates,there are villages 3,4 a*d 6 miles inland with date*.groves.At Masnaah.the groves belonging to the place are 2 to 3 miles deep. Muladah is 7 miles inland south west of Hasnaah. The place depends on its extensive date groves which are divided only by a narrow wadi from those of Masnaah. This gives a depth to the belt of at least 7 miles as quoted above from another authority. Behind Wadam again there are 4 villages from 5 to 6 miles inland all with extensive groves. Su^aiq is the port for the 7/adi Bani Ghafir. The upper portion of the Wadi contains at least 25,000 pains amongst other crops. The lower portion is said to con tain the same crops so I presume it also contains date palms tho'ugh I do not know the n/umber. Khaburah is the port for the Wadi Hawasinah. Quaeaf, one hour inland, contains extensive grovee,though I cannot say whether these are contiguous with those of Khaburah. At least 9 places in the Wadi Hawasinah have extensive groves. At Saham,the dates of the place are estimated at abou^* 30,000 but dates are grown in terraces in the Wadi Ahin and Wadi Dhank behind it. At Sohar,the Batinah date belt is about 3 miles deep. On the other side of the Hajar range,at Ibri,there is an extensive date grove, stated by one authority to be the most extensive in Oman with the exception of Sem- -ail.( Presumably also excluding the Batinah,which is not in Oman proper.} At Baraimi.some of the beet varieties of dates are grown.including Fard,Khalas and Mibsali but they are not held in equal estimation with those of Semail and Badiyah. The palms are said to number about 60,000. The breadth ot t/iexdate belt along the Batinah is governed by the distance inland at which it is econ omic to work wells by the primitive methods atpresent in uee. The wells are 15 to 20 feet deep. I d&amp;Be say that with more modern methods of pumpimiig water could be obtained economically at a {greater distance from the coast thereby enlarging the area. The above data wnich are from reliable sources in ray records are as near an answer as I can ^ire you to questions 1 and 2. I think personally that you hare underestimated the number of palms. Thirdly as regards prices,! enclose a list I hare i eceived from the customs which you can compare for yourself. Fourthly,you would need expert technical adrice to answer this question. Shumal storms in the latter part of the cold weather sweep this coast and I think would wash away anything but the strongest constru- -ction. However a track has been made by the Muscat Infantry from Matrah through Bosher to Sib (avoiding the pass and the soft sand on tne beach.) and I have been as far as Sib in my car. I have not tried going further as yet but a Ford car has been as far as Sohar and I understand there are no obstacles. Fifthly there would not be political difficulties if tne matter -ere approached properly by tne right kind of man but the Arab is naturally suspicious and if you started by building a pier he may think you have other motives and resent it. The track to the east of Khabura including Masnaah and Suwaik is inhabited by a troub lesome tribe the -Yal Saad' but otherwise the inhab- -itants are harmless enough. Sixthly the dates are there but I do not suppose that you could build up an enormous connection such as you cent emplate all at once. The Banias trade through Arab brokers to whom I believe they advance money before the production of the dates. I do not know.(■ irhat you could do by direct methods. As you 8e«,your (jusstioiis riuva not bean as .Asy to /• \n- \ MM answer as they seemed at first sifcht. The family are goin^ strong. Patrick has 7 teeth also and runs about the house all day.

My aear Major, &lt;- h; 29th*December 1928. Very many thanks Indeed for your long and most Interesting letter oi the 8th. Novepoer. I have been very ^ busy and delayed to answer; but a copy I sent iinmealately I | S^t it to our people In New York. 1 have not yet their ^ answer; but I have an answer to a previous letter on the subject; and 1 understand that the matter interests them, and that they are prepared to try the dates from the Batinah this next season in a small way. Probably we shall get our agents to do this for us; but, in any case, 1 should be glad, if you would keep this coniidential; at any rate, until we can complete our arrangements. Your letter is exactly what 1 was wanting. Prom the tiny scrap i saw, and from wnat 1 have been able to read up about the batinah, l was convinced that it was the second frl66©st date garden in the world. Your letter confirms my belief, but there is still a tremendous lot to find out, before we can oo anything very ueiinite. 1 oo not know; but I should imagine our people in new York would want to know very mum* him ' ' much more tnan they uo at present, oeioie they sank anyG.P.M. . 29 tn.i;ecemDer i 92 d 2 to money in Ms skat or its vicinity. 1 nave got some le^ve In April; but I have to be back again in Basrah by the end oi' August. 1 should much liKe to nave another look at the Uman ana the coast, and think that, from my point of view, the most useful time would be the end of July, when the date harvest should be begun. So I think I will visit Maskat then, after taking a trip down the Idle, to get a glimpse of Egypt and the Sudan. What I should like to do very much is to taice a Ford along the whole length of the Batinah; but I fear that might be rather expensive. If the company thoug ht it worth while to pay ray expenses, then I should try and do th^pt; but, if the company would not pay my expenses, then I should be able to afford only a donkey, and I would get as f&amp;t as I could with that. I do not think I would attempt the interior, because the dates there are more scattered, and because of the political difficulties. You, I expect, will not be in Maskat in July; but if you could leave m word with the nice old Wall of Matrah that you would be obliged, if he would give me one of his scalliwags as a guide and give me his blessing, then, I think, all would be well. I heard yesteruay that there is now a Ford Agent in Maskat. Is that so? And, if so, what is his name, that I may get into touch with him? How does one manage for petrol along the Batinah?-— carry it with one ? That should not be difficult. It. would mean lugging along about five tins, I suppose. You are no douot familiar with Major Gill's note ona.P.M 29th.Dec .1928 3 X Malaria in Maekat. I read it when it was first published; uut, when I wanted to reread it a little while ago, I found it was out of print in England. But I got a copy from India, and it has Just arrived. His description of the climate is so documented, so calm, so free from exaggeration that I feel tempted to say to inyself, 'Let the dates of Maskat steam in their own juice 1“ The accpunts of the old travellers, who reported findixig boiled gazelle lying on the desert do not so much make one^ hair rise as G-ill’s figures. What exactly are the prices in your scedule cased on ? Are they the figures used by the Customs for estimating export duty ? Or are they bazaar wholesale prices ? ur are \Jr they the average of weekly prices ? Or how are they obtained ? I presume they are not the prices actually paid to the garden owners, which, I imagine, would oe less than these. BATNI I take to be a synonym for UMM SILAL, the commonest of the Batinah dates. Would it be any more difficult to load steamers at (say) Khaburah than it is now at Matrah ? In both, native craft would have to be used as lighters. Am I right in believing that the shamal wind is rare in August and September ? We have just come back from a few days camping up river, and are feeling much refreshed. You should certainly lose no time in establishing a hill station on the Jabal Khadhar, where it is too cold for date palms. I sincerely trust that the palm trees of A1 Janna,. by a special dispensa tion, are a cold weather kind. Hoping you had a Merry Christmas, ana with best wishes for the New Year, Yours sincerely.* 29 th .Dec 4 @&gt;/^f P ' S ' 1 hav « recently finished reading an ill written^ book called ADVENTURES IN TRIPOLI by Ernest H. griffin,, in which is a considerable description of Barunl and his stand against the Italians in 1912 and 1913.
