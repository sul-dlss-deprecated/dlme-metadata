(c) We have never in any watt admitted or withdrawn 1 our original objections to the claim of the Shah's G-ovemmjent to ownership of the island. (d} It is equally clear from our records that the Jowasmi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast have never voluntarily dropped their claim to proprietary rights over Sirri Just as nuch as over Tanb and Abu I us a # As late as 1895 the said Sheikhs declared that al though the Chief of -hargah on their behalf had duly represented to tho British G-ovemrmnt that the owner ship of the island was vested in him as Chief of the Jowasims, the British Government had refrained from moving in the matter and that they themselves had consequently been unable to enforce their rights by their own unaided efforts, I venture now to suggest a meenjs by which the re-open- of the discussion of the Sir7*i case night he reason* ablyably claimed, or ratter its resumption, for it cannot be said aver to have been closed. I might he authorised to allow the Chief of Shargah to ad dress a letter to this Residency in which he will, in the first place, convey his thanks to dovemimnt for trie action taken in regard to Tanb and Abu Musa and will then take the liberty of urging once more, as Chief of the Joiuasims, that Government should again move in the matter of Sirri, the position and rights of the Jowamis in regard to which island being identically the same as in the case of Auu uscl ana ianb m .le mignt suate zn conclusion iftidv tne recenlj posting o£ a Persian guarc, on the island shows that the Persian 'Jovemraent are inclined to increase their encroach ments and ajfords him fresh cause for renewing past pro tests and for pressing for the adjustment of the question of irri as well as that of the otlier two islands 9 If the ovenz ent of India think that action is feasible on the lines suggested it is important that I should nave early instructions, as som little time will be needed to coiununicate with Shargah 9 8 m In years gone by lis ajesty's representatives at Tehe ra. appear to have considered the mr&amp; appearance of t/w Persian ilag at one of the islands in the Gulj to be an un** important matter hardly calling for diplomatic action at Teheran.

From— Sir Arthur Hardinge , K.C.M .G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have received Major Cox's despatcli No. 162 of the 11th ultimo, to whieh reference was made in the Government of India's telegram to me, No. 2273 ot the 15th instant, respecting Sirri Island, and I have the honour to otter following observations with respect to it. The Government of India will have seen from my despatch No. Ill of the 20th ultimo that I informed the Ain-ed-Dowleh that I would report to Lord Lansdowne his remarks ahout Tamb and Abu Musa, but that a controversy on the subject might re-open the question of the ownership of Sirn, m respect to which we had never explicitly admitted Persian claims. It is, therefore, open to His Majesty's Government if they deem it desirable to do so, or if a recommendation to that effect is made hj the Government of India to re-open the question of Sirri by a reply through me to the Am-ed-Dowleh s language as reported in that despatch, without the necessity of a reference to the Sheikh of Shargah. I would not wish to revive any hopes which the latter Chief may enteratin of recovering Sirri, in the loss of which he has long facto acquiesced, in case we should find it convenient to drop the question, Mons. Naus, as you are aware, has consented to strike out Sim from the list of Customs posts enumerated in the R^glement Douamer, so that we shall not commit ourselves by accepting that instrument to a recognition ot Persian sovereignty over the island and can keep this circumstance m reserve to be used by us in the event of any difficulties such as those which Major Cox anticipates arising in connection with the adjacent pearl-fisheries or ot inter ference with these by Customs or other Persian officials. I agree with Major Cox in thinking that under present circumstances any new assertion of Persian as against Arab rights in the Gulf should be vigorously resisted, hut in the case of Sirri we are face to face with a Persian occupation in which we have acquiesced for very many years, and which, though -B e are •justified in not formally recognizing it, there seems no special reason at moment to challenge unless the Persians force the question upon us. Foreign OfSca Press—Ko. 1107—8-9-04—54.i (5&gt;so *2' ♦ 3xtraet from a Despatch, ETo. 18, {Commercial) dated the 19tli July 1904 from His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Marquess of Lansdowne, The third point had reference to Sirri Island. The Government of India entertains, as Your Lordship is aware, some objection to the recognition of Persian sovereignty over Sirri, though it holds that our case against Persia is not a strong one, owing to our having allowed Arab rights to the island to \ lapse. On my explaining to !I, Haus that it was difficult for us to recognise Persian claims to it, he said he would strike Sirri out of the list of Customs posts enumerated in the tahle annexed to the Reglement Douanier, He hoped, however, that we would not press for the removal of the few Persian coast guards ^ stationed on the island, which as a fishing centre was also a smugglers resort. I said that I had no instructions from Your Lordship to insist on this, 'but we would prefer that a regular Customs station should not he established there while the - question of ownership was still uncertain. I thought it however possible that we might recognise Persia 1 s sovereignty over Sirri r- in return for an abandonment by Persia of all claims to Tamb — and Abumusa, and a pledge that the islet should never be ceded to any Foreign P 0We;r#i r^A M, ITaus says he is preparing fair copies of the Reglement for the acceptance and signature of the Russian Charge d'affaires, and hopes to complete this formality at an early date. - ■ ■ ■ - wy-Foreign Office to India Office.

Addressed Ministerjrepeated to Ind i a20 NOTO OR SSML 'LSJM / There are two pemanent# villages on 'oiie Island. They are known as (!)• Bilad Ziraiya ( (2). Bilad Ghawawis ( ) which we may render respectively the onltivated village and the 'Divers 1 village. The first named, is situated tomrds the North-east oorner of the Island and contains a do sen or more mud huts tenanted by the faxailies of 8 or 9 adult Arabs of the Abu Bastur { j} ) clan, which would be classed as A1 Paris They number about 60 souls. This settlement is stated to have been made by the JoTOsim about 80 years ago during their occupation of ohe Lingah littoral and the Arab settlers hailed from Lingah itself or the immediate vicinity. At the i/ime they settled there, a lady named Naaiai ( ) of the ruling Jowasim family was living there with a few adherents. The village now possess a small date grove containing about 500 trees, and the inhabitants cultivate for their own consumption a li'Otle wheat and oarley, melons and onions. There are traces of a wider extent of cultivation dating from a time when water was more plentiful. The ?iater for 'ohe irrigation of the crops is obtained from a collection of 12 wells, each aoout 6 fathoms deep and providing a fair supply of pood water. The wells .are known as Tooi Naami ) thQ W0llB of Naa;rii after ' (jhe Jowasmi lady above mentioned. She was the aunt of Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan of Shargah, and presumably sister of Sheikh Sultan. In addition to their cultivated ground the villagers own 12 bullocks for working the wells, 10 or 12 Cows for milk etc. , 400 Sheep and goats,20 Donkeys, _ t No boatts. They are Hanabila Sunn is by religion. The sooond or Divers* village is situated on the south- em shore of the Island opposite the anchorage shoim in the Adrairalty Charbs. It is occupied by 40 families of 'the Sudan and 30 families of the Huwala - all from the Trucial Coast. They all live by fishing and pearling, and during ohe pearling season many of the women proceed to Shargah and Khan for the date harvest. They are also Hanabila. The village ovm no cultivation or flocks but possess 15 Bajribooks for pearling and 50 small baggams.^^) They get their water from a 3inp:le well called Bu 3ur (}.) 500 or 600 jaxds away to the North-west of the village. The water of it is plentiful but. not* so good as the wells at Tooi Naarai. Sirri is believed to have been used regularly by ohe diving element of the Jowasnis from the earliest times, but this particular settlement was started about 50 years ago from the Trucial Coast, the Soudan going first from Debai and the Huwala families following 2 years later from Shargah. Sheikh Sultan bin Bagaa? was Sheikh of Shar- gah at the time and his son Khalid (the father of the pre sent Sheikh Sagar) was living there with his aunt Naami in a fortified house with a tower at a point a little south of the centre of i/he Bast shore of ohe Island. They used 'oo fly the Jowasmi flag on the top of ohe tower of which whe ruins still exist. Sheikh Khalid remained there about 5 years and then returned to Shargah. His aunt Naami remained unoil she died. Throughout this period the Island ms the undisputed property of the Jowasim, but after Naami f s death no special representative of the Jo^msim family appears to have lived onon 'the Island. 2' It was the ilalik-ut-TuJJar who first planted the Persian Flagstaff on the Island, after uhe capture of Ling ah in 18S^/ atnd 'ohe deportation of the Jowsisiiri SheiKh Ksuihib to Teherainj and fron that epooh unoil recently a Lari from Lingah used to come over to the Island after the harvest and collect Lithes from the settlers on behalf of the Linp:ah Authorities. ^ Since 19 two employes from the Persian Oustous liave been stationed on the Island. They annexed an vmoccupied nud hut in the 'Oivers 1 village and are living in it. They look after the Persian flag and take duty on all imports that arrive without an exemption pass from the Ling ah Cus toms. A British transport laden with tropps and horses is said to have gone ashore and been 'wrecked on Sirri during the Anglo Persian War of 1856.cS&gt; To Agiia Eedr. Ling ail.

Hadji Ali Akbar and Co. (Limited), of Manchester, for a Concession to extract red oxide on the Island of Sirri. I am to inform you in reply that Sir E.

Should it be decided, after consideration of the views of the Government of India, to make such a protest, it will become necessary to warn the interested Company of the action contemplated, and it therefore appears to Sir E. Grey to be undesirable now to demand their assent to conditions regarding the exploitation of a Concession which His Majesty's Government may subsequently feel obliged to prevent them from obtainiDg at all. Sir E.

He does not know of any ■ foreign applicant at present, 'but states that the Mo in is showing interest in Sirri . I do not quite understand in what manner the agent should apply for the concession. If he should obtain it and hand it over to the Manchester firm, it would be tantamount to an admission of Persian sovereignty over Sirri for us to support that firm. I therefore su suggest that before encouraging the agent to apply I should officially notify the Persian Government that we shall not object to a concession being granted to any applicant approved by us, and that, pending the settlement of the^question of ownership, half the roy- alties shall be paid to the Sheik of Shargah by the concessionaire.

With regard to revenue, the Jowasmi Sheiks who governed Lingah for the Persians up to 1887 used to col lect as revenue in kind from their tribesmen on the Is= pearl land one bag of rice per large fishing boat and one half A bag per small boat. This practice was continued after the Persians took over Lingah until recent years. An at tempt was made to establish a customs post in 1904.

It appears that the Jowasmis crossed over and took possession of Lingah more than 150 years ago, and that until 1887 members of their ruling families were Sheiks of Lingah. They were at first practically independent, but gradually came under the domination of Persia and became Governors and Deputy Governors of Lingah under § Fars, paying as much revenue to the Governor of that province as he could squeeze out of them. But it was qua Jowasmis that they ruled Sirri and collected its revenue. On the deposition of the Sheik from the Governorship of Lingah by the Persian authorities in 1887 an expedition was sent to annex Sirri to Persia. We protested, but the matter was allowed to drop. Since that time the revenue has been collected by the Deputy Governor of Lingah who is a Persian official. At first it was collected in kind and latterly in cash at about 100 Tomans per annum.

Whilst our Managing Director was in Tehran in the early part of June he had an, interview with His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'AJffaires, Mr. Marling, on this subject.

(1) The Company, while giving an assurance that they will control the concession in British interests, do not definitely state that they are a British Company as they were described in Hussein Agha's letter to Major Cox dated the 13th April 1908. (2) The Firm do not undertake positively ''not to transfer' the concession 'nor allow it to be shared in by any foreigner', but merely state that 'it is not intended' to do so.

Please instruct me as to what answer I should return.(Received on the 2'7th September igo8, under cover of a letter from His Britannic •Majest^Minister^ Tehran^ No, 16, dated the 20th August igo8) culahak; August 2oth l igoS, NCK 226. Sir, In the course of conversation some weeks ago on the subject of the acquisition of a concession for mining red oxide in the island of Sirri, Eftekhar-et-Tujjar, Tehran, representative of the firm of Haji Ali Akbar and Company, stated that the Persian Government derived an annual revenue of 100 tomans from that island. As the matter seemed to me to be of some importance as bearing upon the Persian claim to Sovereignty over Sirri island, I requested the Acting Consul General at Bushire to endeavour to verify the truth of the statement. Captain Trevor has now furnished me with the following information on the subject. More than 150 years ago the Jowasmi Sheikhs appear to have crossed over to the mainland and to have taken possession of Lingah and down to 1887 members of their ruling families were Sheikhs of Lingah. They gradually came under the domination of Persia though at first practically independent, and having become Governors, or Deputy Governors of Lingah, subordinate to the Province of Pars, paid as much revenue to the Governor of Fars as he could extort from them. During this time, however, they continued to collect revenue from Sirri island and continued to rule it in their capacity as Jowasmi Sheikhs. An expedition which occasioned a protest on the part of His Majesty's Government was sent to annex Sirri island to Persia in i887 subsequent to the deposition by the Persian Authorities of the Sheikh from the Governorship of Lingah, Since that date the Deputy Governor of Lingah, now a Persian official, has collected the revenue, at first in kind, at the rate previously exacted by the Jowasmi Sheikhs, t e., half a bag of rice for a small pearl fishing boat, and one bag for a large boat; latterly this has been converted to a cash payment of about 100 tomans {£ 20) a year. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Baronet, etc., etc., etc. □ G. c. B.

Regarding the Island of.Lesser Tanb, the Sheikh of Shargah has never flown his' flag there, but in case of necessity there appears no reason why we should not claim that its ownership follows l^fiat of the island of Greater Tanb and'tell Strick to act as indicated by the Secretary of stat e• Lesser Farour should by the s^me analogy belong to, Persia which now owns the parent island.

The Geologist could quietly exanfine these and other likely islands in the 'Lawrence', and .take samples for comparison as to quality. It is already known that oxide exists on Dalma Island under Abu Thabi and it is believed that it exists on Sir Abu imair, under Shargah. Furthermore, I found on examinafc itBjr Halool last spring that oxide was plentiful there. Kalool is not unfavourably situated and it was believed in 1906 that. Germany was endeavouring to obtain ,a lease of. it, as will be seen from the correspondence connected with Bushire letter No. 1794 dated 5th August 1906 to the Foreign Departments. .{Copy. ) C { Received on the 18th NoTemher 1908 with Pol.

As you are aware^ the territorial ownership of Sirri is disputed, the island being claimed by Persia and by the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah, who is under British protection. In 1888, it was occupied by the Persian Government. His Majesty's Government protested at the time; and although they refrained fromr taking forcible action on behalf of the Sheikh of Shargah, they have never acquiesced in the justice of the Persian claim. When, therefore, Messrs.

At all events our men say they saw ro other spots at Halul with any surface oxide indications ; - unless indeed the spot which Mr Pilgrim has referred to was not observed by our exploring party. There is just a faint possibility that Pit No. 4 if excavated horizon tally in parallel with th^ better side of the vein of oxide,may lead to a thicker and deeper vein of batter deposit of oxide, and this experiment will require much expense and trouble^and which we shall reserve for future consideration. 3. From one of the digginga at walul our men have brought a piece of mineral which appears to contain manganese, and if so a further search at Halul will be necessary. 4» ' Our men admit that their explorations at Sir Abu Nuairwere somewhat imperfect owing to the small number of coolies they were allowed to take with them. We therefore purposejWith your Kind sanction, making another trial on this island at some opportune moment, specially as we understand that the Sheikh of Sharjah had told our men that some better and larger deposits did exist there and that he would be glad to assist them should they call again. 6. As reported in one of my previous respects,our men were not allowed to visit Dalmah and Sir Beni Yas. We therefore beg to appeal to you to kindly place us in a position to explore those islands as well, specially as, besides searching for red oxide of iron, we a~e very keen and anxious to find good large deposits of black sand, which too we hear exists at Dalmah in large quantities. 6. As we believe some extensive business can be done in black sand,I shall indeed feel very grateful if you would kindly favor me with any information you may have as to where generally it is obtainable in the Gulf. I Also regret to say that our sponge diving operations so far have been equally unfortunate, but this is no proof that large fields of good sponges do not exist in the Gulf. The said operations were a good deal hampered by the unusual gales and haze then prevailing down the Gulf ports. 3. I beg to express our sincere and grateful thanks for the valuable assistance you have kindly given us in prospecting the various islands and we still entertain a hope that with further efforts in various directions we shall yet be able to attain some good practical results. Yours sincerely.Extract from Lingah Political Diary No.27 ending 28th Sep- tember 1910. 343. Monsieur Leoan-es-Sultan, Acting Director of Custome, mad© a trip in the Customs launch w Khorasan f - to the Island of Gaiz on 23rd instant x x x x x x Monsieur Lecanres-Sultan was also desirous of visiting the Island of Siri. The 'Khorasan* after leaving Gaiz, steamed for 40 hours endeavouring to find the Island of Siri but failed to do so. The possible disappearance of the Island presents itself but further evidence appears to be necessary which will be ob tained. No.28 Extract from Lingah Political Diary/for week ending 5th October 1910. With reference to News No.27 entry 343 for the week ending 28th September 1910, regarding Monsieur Lecan-es-Sultan's en- deavour to reach the island of Siri, the object of the visit was to investigate a report made by the Cuatoma Mudir of Siri to the effect that some Arabs had pulled down the Customs flag-staff. A sailing boat recently arrived at Lingah from Siri and Monsieur Lecan-es-Sultan, who was clearly unable to make any investigation of the flag-staff incident, has taken it upon himself to confis-| cate the boat's sails. The Arab boatmen from Siri protest that the Customs Mudir himself, while endeavouring to take down the -staff flag, which had stuck, pulled the flag/down. Supdt. I did not know the Customs had a flag at Siri ? Before entering please put up file. L. B. P.A. The Siri file is at Sz. There is also some correspondence regarding M. Dambrain's proceedings in hoisting the Persian Flag fcat«g on Islands including Abu Musa. That correspondence which isI eft • ■. I at Sz, may show if M.Darabrain had established post or not. Siri is not included in the list of Persian Customs posts recently supplied to us by M.Constant. We know, however, that the Persian flag is being flown on Siri. P.J.G. 25/10/10. P. R. I do not know if this is something new. If so perhaps Mr.New might enquire into.it. L. B. 25/10/10. F. A. I imagine the flagstaff has been pulled down by accident. P.Z.C.
