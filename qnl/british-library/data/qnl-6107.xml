KOWEIT LANDING AREA r i Dear Sir, As you are aware, this Company has recently decided to continue using the old aerodrome at Koweit in preference to the new area recently prepared by the Royal Air Force. This decision was taken in the interests of both economy and convenience. I should, however, be most grateful for your advice in connexion with the position that now arises in so far as payment to the Ruler of Koweit for the use of two separate aerodromes at Koweit is concerned. If in your opinion, our decision to continue use of the cld landing area is likely to result in a demand for additional rental from the Ruler, it may of course be necessary to re—consider the decision we have already taken. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Yours faithfully, For Imperial Airways Ltd. Manager, Iraq Area, Baghdad.1 6 ? Confidentl&amp;l , D«0* No. C/61.

Sir, i have the honour to refer to the recruiting of the above Force, and to invite your attention to the fact that of those so far enlisted approximately 70/« are indebtedi- (i) To the Bahrain Government in respect of amounts paid to dhow owners in discharge of obligations in respect ±x&gt; of the Tesqam (divers* advance) and/or (ii) To Nahkudas in respect of diving debts contracted prior to enlistment. 2. it is understood that in the case of personnel in similar circumstances now employed by the Bahrain Oil Company, or serving the State Police, recovery of indebtedness is being made at the rate of Bs.5 per month. 3. By the above system a precedent would appear to be established, and little doubt exists but that the Officer Comnanding, R.A.F. Levies, Persian Gulf, will be asked to conform thereto, it will be appreciated that this presents certain difficulties since under Service Law, civil debts may not be recovered from pay, nor can the Royal Air Force as such accept any liability for payment of debts contracted by personnel prior to enlistment. 4. This problem is at present being carefully examined at this Headquarters, in order to assist in arriving at a decision, it would be of great assistance if your valued opinion could be gived as tos- (i) Whether subject to deduction from pay being authorised, it is considered essential for the maintenance of satisfactory relationship with the Civilian Authorities and population, that such a procedure should be adopted, and (ii) Whether deduction by instalment is in the interest of the debtors conderned. 5. it would be much apprediated if your views under the above headings could be comminicated to this Headquarters at the earliest possible date. i have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant.

I discussed the matter with Galloway during a recent visit to Kuwait. He had not received your letter but was not willing to modify his views. Actually, I understand from him, that Lambie resides at Ahmedi at a long distance from the landing ground, and that he is not in a position to supply information of the Eind described in paragraph 4 of Heyting's letter to you of the 6th Septem ber. In any case no new airfields can be constructed in Kuwait territory without our knowledge, and we should probably be in a better position than Lambie to obtain information about any new airfields which may be construc ted in territories adjoining Kuwait. Particulars of fo reign aircraft using the Kuwait landing ground are ordi narily obtained by local officials for the purpose of the recovery of landing fees. If Lambie were by any chance to see e strange foreign aircraft passing over Kuwait terri tory, ar*d to report the matter to Galloway, I have no doubt that the latter would send the information on to the proper quar ter. 3.

Kuwait Oil Company have now reached a decision on type of air-field they are prepared to build at Kuwait, at their own expense, and adequate to their own needs. Specifications indicate bearing strength may be adequate for regular use by four engined aircraft but that length of (mut) inadequate. 2. Ministry of Civil Aviation have decided to send survey party to estimate costs of supplementary works to bring proposed air-field up to standards required for use by International aircraft and to enable an adequate review to be made of case for H.M.G bearing on these costs. 3. We should not ofcourse wish company to delay construction in the meantime, but it is hoped a decision on future air-field can be reached in time to ensure that there is no interruption of works, if it is decided to supplement company’s scheme. 4. Survey party will consist of Mr. V/.A.R Harris and Mr. G.A.(mut)ness of Ministry of Civil Aviation who/-who will travel by Solent service (mut) Kuwait July 14th. They will be joined by Group Capfc. Dormer, Chief Engineer to the Air Ministry of Works Directorate, Baghdad, and have been instructed to keep in close touch with the Politic 1 Agent Kuwait. 5. We regret the short notice but hope arrange ments are acceptable to you. Date of survey has been ad vanced to take advantage of ? frontier delimitation visit by Mr. Southwell to Kuwait. 6. In view of terms of air agreement, Kuwait Oil Company can establish and maintain our air-field only as agents of H.M.G, and company are anxious to know a) what will this involve, if H.M.G makes no contribution to cost; b) what will be division of responsibility if H.M.G decide to supplement this scheme Final answer^s on these points cannot be given until after survey, but in the meantime we are considering urgent desirability (mut) they can (omm) agency agreement to cover interim period, and hope to consult you shortly. 7. Kuwait Oil Company originally gave us to understand they intended to await formal approval embod^iying at any rate our preliminary views on (a) and (b) before starting construction. We have now heard informally however that on account of increasing diffictiikt- ies at existing air strip they may go ahead immediately ? on the assumption that fc feacfc an ? acceptable settiement will be reached. 8.

Cooper, the Assistant Managing Director of the Koweit Oil Company, in order to complete arrangements for the Survey, the latter took the opportunity to inform us that the Company had decided to make a start with the construction of the new airport and to accept whatever risks there might he in doing so before the Terms of their a ency v/ere : irmly settled. The Company felt that course to be preferable to continuing the present position which involves acceptinc considerable and growing risks at the existing airstrip vithout takin any positive action to improve the situation. 2. Mr. Cooper stressed, however, that his Board were very anxious to have some idea of the arrangements which His Majesty^ Government would propose for governing operation of the airport, and they would also like to have the position regularised by a final intimation of assent to the work proceeding, or, alternatively, if agreement could not be reached and asse &lt;t could not be given they would wish that position to be establ shed as soon as possible so that they could minimise as far as possible any abortive expenditure that might arise from l heir unilateral • action in commencing work on the new site. Mr. Coo rr make it quite clear that he realised that there was no possibility o reaching finality on a long-term agency a reement until after our Survey Party had reported and decisions had been taken in the light of their findin s. In the meantime, however, the Company hoped that an understanding could be reached on the basis of an interim a ree ent which would be capable of modification in gr.ater or less degree once it was decided whether the -airport to be constructed would be built to internat ional standards or restricted to the dimensions of the Company’s own seborae. 3 . These ideas are, of course, broadly in accord with what Y/as arranged at our Meeting herewith representatives of the Oil Company on 1st June, and in order to make progress I do not think I ctn. do better than to^encloee for your consideration a Di^ft Heads of Agreement which ft is felt might form the basis for, e mutually acceptable settlement while construction and the Survey *o ahead. h. In view of the Company's plea of urgency, I am sen ing you the Draft for preliminary consideration before the implications of some of its Terms have been finally considered here. I shall get in touch with you again in a few days time to tell you to what extent, if auy, we intend to introduce amendments or alterations. xours sincerely. Sgd.

The existing Air Navigation regulations eontain penal clauses but tha penalties prescribed can only be enforced through legal proceedings.

The Head of 0? therefore suggested that the situation would be met if agreement was reached withihe Oil Company on a minimum number of main points and said he had suggested to the Oil Company that a meeting should be held for this purpose. It was agreed that while negotiations with the Company should proceed FAB and OF Branches, consulating IR as necessary, should make early recommendations to USA concerning the terms to be included in a comprehensive agreement with the Company: such an agreement should also define the Company’s obligations in regard to the existing airfield.

We found the minutes almost unintelligible owing to use ol uni ami liar initials (a matter regarding which we have ourselves been recently admonished by the Foreign Office) but we are at least able to gather that no progress whatever is being made with the proposal for a new airfield at Kuwait. . This is most unsatislactory. The proposal has been under consideration for at least two years and the Shaikh made its implementation a condition for his acceptance of the new civil air agreement. If the use of the existing airfield in its present condition continues a serious accident will almost certainly occur and the Shaikh ana tne general public including the relatives of the unfortunate victims of the accident will rightly blame His Majesty *s Government for tneir dilatoriness and their failure to live up to their obligations under the air agreement.

It will not include anything which M.C.A. require in accordance with the proposed Clause 3 oi the Agreement,Presuming that we are going to act as the /O representative of the Ministry of Civi&amp;/ Aviation the paragraphs which would affect us are: Para 9 ( ' /c . Para 10 a) ,t&gt;) and c) Para 16 Para 1? Para 23. I do not think that# there is any thing in these to comment on. I am not sure that Para 2 would oblige the Company to erect accommodation for Kuwait Govt use — Customs.Passports, Quarantine etc; I should say not. If they do, are they entitled to rent such buildings to the Kuwaiti Goverhitient? Port Mashrif is Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak’s house. According to Israel, the airfield will be to the west of it. Some thought should be given to ensuring that a decent road 'is made connecting it with the town. I am afraid the above got so far and no further. V/e have been told that the agreement is rather hanging fire. Do you think that there is any point in trying to comment? We have already stressed the need for accommodation for the Kuwait Government services. The only point I feel concerned atftut is the provision of a decent road. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ =rz&gt;.Telegram From to Repeated OTP Political Resident, Bahrain foreign Office, London (telno 590 Dec 22) Political Agent, Kuwait Embassy Baghdad ( for CIVATTO No. 320.
