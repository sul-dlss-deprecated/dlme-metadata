The issue arose because the Company had up until that point been dependent for medical and hospital facilities on the American Mission in Kuwait, but this arrangement was deemed to be unsuitable in view of the prospective increase in the Company's staff.The papers show that the India Office and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concurred in the proposal to recruit an extra nurse.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Nurses</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000189#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000189#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000189#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
