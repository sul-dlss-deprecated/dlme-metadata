Yours everI.D. 2130/41 IMJlA QilPiaCi, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 23rd. May, 1941. Hy deiir Rushbrook, Attached are the papers about the Paris broadcast repeating a message from Baghdad SAyin£ that the Government of Afghanistan have decided to enter the war on the side of Iraq, if the British Expeditionary Force is not w^hdrawn from that country. It now appears that the Germans have also put out this message, and we have informed Aabul accordingly with reference to Sir h. Fraser-Tytler's telegram ho. 157 of the 18th. May. It seems, however, very unlikely that the Afghan-Government will be prepared to say anything publicly.. We wonder whether you would see any objection to arran^in^ for some quite inciaenti£ reference to be uade to the matter in the Arabic hews Bulletin, perhaps in terms somewhat as follows;- *'An example of the lengths to which enemy propaganda is prepared to £0 in the war of nerves in the Midale East is to be found in a message from Baghdad broadcast from Aadio Paris and repeated in the German propaganda service to the effect that the Government of Afghanistan have warned Britain that they will enter the war on the side of Iraq^ if the British Expeditionary Force is not withdrawn from that country. The short answer to this statement is that it is a deliberate lie.' Will you kindly let me know whether something of this kind could be put out without attributing it to any source? Yours ever, (Sd.)
